Madrid: Barcelona went a point clear at the top at the halfway stage of the Primera Liga season after drawing 1-1 with Real Betis on Wednesday. 

It was a far from convincing performance by the leaders, who have won only one of their last five league games and had to come from a goal down against struggling Betis. 

Brazilian striker Robert put the hosts ahead from a corner late in the first half before Mexican defender Rafael Marquez nodded the equaliser after 61 minutes. 

Barcelona have 39 points from 19 games, one ahead of Sevilla and Real Madrid, and three clear of fourth-placed Valencia. 

Barcelona again looked a shadow of the side that strolled to the title in 2005 and 2006. Betis played the brighter football in the first half with midfielder Marcos Assuncao and striker Rafael Sobis trying their luck from distance. 

Barcelona looked short of ideas in attack and shaky at the back. 

It came as little surprise when the home side took the lead eight minutes before the break, the unmarked Robert heading in after Nano nodded an Assuncao corner across goal. 

There was more urgency about Barcelona in the second period but Betis had little problem keeping them at bay until the visitors won a corner on the hour, and centre back Marquez glanced his header between keeper Toni Doblas and a defender at the near post. 

Meanwhile, Julio Baptista scored three times as Arsenal stormed back to draw 2-2 with north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur in a frenetic first leg of their League Cup semi-final at White Hart Lane on Wednesday. 

The Brazilian followed up his brilliant four-goal show in the quarter-final demolition of Liverpool to rescue Arsenal after his own goal and Dimitar Berbatovs headed opener had gifted Tottenham a 2-0 halftime lead. 

The former Real Madrid striker redeemed himself in stunning fashion after the break, beating England keeper Paul Robinson twice in a 12-minute spell to make Arsenal favourites to advance after next weeks second leg. 

Bulgarian international Berbatov only managed a 15-minute cameo before succumbing to a groin injury but lasted long enough to head Jermain Defoes cross past keeper Manuel Almunia to give Spurs a dream start after 12 minutes. 

The home side doubled their advantage after 21 minutes with a goal that Baptista will want to forget. 

There seemed little threat when Tom Huddlestone sent a low free-kick into the area but Baptista got into a terrible tangle and dragged the ball into his own net. 

Arsenal improved dramatically after the break as manager Arsene Wenger beefed up his youthful side with the introduction of Alexander Hleb and Emmanuel Eboue. 

Tottenham lost their grip on the game and Arsenal cut the deficit after 65 minutes, Baptista shooting low past Robinson after the ball broke loose in the area. 

As anxiety spread among the home crowd, Arsenal sensed their chance and it was no surprise when Baptista tapped in the equaliser from a low Justin Hoyte cross with 13 minutes remaining. (Reuters)

 Endorsements dont affect performance: Sreesanth

 Sreesanth 

Thiruvananthapuram: The Board of Control for Cricket in Indias (BCCI) decision to put a ceiling on players endorsements may have stirred a hornets nest but speedster Sreesanth insists that appearing in advertisements does not affect their on-field performance. 

Whats wrong if we do it? Cricket is a religion in India, it is not like in other countries... And it (endorsements) will not affect the performance, he said. 

For example, Sachin drinks Boost (in an advertisement). If you can sell a product why not do it? Advertisements will not affect the performance for sure, Sreesanth added. 

The BCCI didnt wish to react in a hurry with joint secretary M.P. Pandove saying he would have to look into the details. 

Interacting with students of Balasahithya Institute here last evening, Sreesanth said Indias first-round exit from the World Cup was disappointing but added cricket is not going to end with the World Cup. 

On not getting a chance to play even a single match in the World Cup, Sreesanth said, all wishes need not necessarily materialise, but I am confident that my day will come. 

He said hitting South African pacer Andre Nels delivery for a six during the India-South Africa Test in Johannesburg earlier this year was the most proud moment in his career. 

Nel was bullying me verbally throughout the match. The moment I came to the crease for batting, he provoked me saying he could smell blood... I enjoyed the moment when I hit him for six, he said. 

He said it was a glad moment in his career when he took the wicket of the West Indies star batsman Brian Lara, that too in the same ground where Lara scored 400. 

To a question on what was his greatest wish, he said: I would like to open with Sachin Tendulkar. Who knows if I will get a chance!

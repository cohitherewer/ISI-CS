The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Weve proved a point: Colaco

 Dempo coach Armando Colaco 

New Delhi: For Dempo coach Armando Colaco, the title triumph in the 11th edition of the National Football League (NFL) on Tuesday is a point proved. 

Speaking to The Telegraph from Goa minutes after winning the title for the second time in three years, Armand, as he is popularly known, sounded positively thrilled. 

I will never forget our first NFL title in 2005, as it came six months after Christiano Juniors death, said Colaco. 

This time we have proved a point. When Dempo won for the first time, everyone spoke of how Sporting Clube de Goa lost the title. Our success story, against all odds, hardly attracted any attention. This time, it is only Dempo and no one else, said the coach. 

Faith in local players, Colaco said, was the key to Dempos success. I picked up local players like John Dias, Clifford Miranda and Climax Lawrence, kept faith in them and produced results. No one knew Anthony Pereira when he switched over to Dempo. Today, he is a key figure in our scheme of things. 

Colaco, who was in a hurry to leave for the famous Bambolim Cross in Goa to pray and thank for the victory, also made a dig at Calcutta football, which he described as a haven for unscrupulous agents. 

In Calcutta they always look out for outstation players, Colaco said. They sack coaches throughout the season. Thats not the way to run football. You have to give coaches time before they start producing results. 

There was a time, according to the Dempo coach, when Goa teams were scared of playing Calcutta teams. Then we suffered from inferiority complex. But roles have reversed in the past couple of years. Bengal teams are running scared of us. We have managed to instil fear. 

Colaco is not bothered that the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has never called him up to have a try with the national team. Given a chance I can drastically improve the performance of the Indian team, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Drama over the past four weeks

 March 23: India lose a must-win game to Sri Lanka in 

 the group stage of the World Cup in the West Indies. After 

 being shocked by Bangladesh in the opening match of their 

 campaign, India are almost out, needing Bermuda to upset 

 Bangladesh to have any chance of making it to the Super 

 Eight. No such luck, Bangladesh duly beat the minnows and 

 the former champions crash out of the tournament. 

 April 4: Indias shock exit has almost sealed Greg Chappells fate as India coach, and after days of speculation, he says he is unwilling to continue. A leaked SMS and reports that players are unhappy with him dont help matters. Chappell telephones BCCI president Sharad Pawar to say he isnt available for an extension owing to family and personal reasons. 

April 6: Sanjay Jagdale submits his report to the BCCI and says that the entire team, particularly the batsmen failed. He too, concurs with Chappell (who also tables his report) that youngsters should be inducted to improve the state of cricket. About Jagdales report, the BCCI says: He too was of the opinion that the youngsters should be inducted to improve our cricket. 

April 7: The BCCIs working committee directs selectors to send a young team on the tour of Bangladesh from May 10-29. Ravi Shastri is named interim cricket manager. Rahul Dravid remains captain at Pawars behest and the selectors retains him till the tour of England, which ends in September. 

 Sachin Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh are showcaused for breaching the boards Code of Conduct by making remarks in the media. Tendulkar had criticised Chappell for questioning his attitude, while Yuvraj had backed Sachins views. 

April 8: BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah says there will be no rethink on the selection of youngsters. Unless the president (Pawar) gives a directive, there cant be any change in what has been decided upon. The only other way is for the working committee to withdraw its directive. However, no meeting is scheduled in the next few weeks. 

April 11: Vice-president Rajeev Shukla says the BCCI has not issued any directive to the national selectors to drop senior players for the tour of Bangladesh. This is rubbish, he says when asked whether Sachin or Sourav Ganguly will be ignored. How can you predict the team when the selectors are yet to meet? We cannot say who should be there in the team. It is up to the selectors to pick the right team. 

April 12: Chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar announces that the squad will be picked on April 20. He says the selectors are looking to pick a pool of around 20. I cant say anything more. The suspense over whether oldies like Sachin and Sourav will head for Bangladesh continues. 

April 14: Tendulkar and Yuvraj reply to the showcause. While Tendulkar sends his response in the morning, Yuvraj says he submitted his reply two days ago. Sources are quoted as saying that Sachin has explained his outburst against Chappell, but that there is no question of apologising. BCCI receives the replies, and Shah says they are satisfactory.

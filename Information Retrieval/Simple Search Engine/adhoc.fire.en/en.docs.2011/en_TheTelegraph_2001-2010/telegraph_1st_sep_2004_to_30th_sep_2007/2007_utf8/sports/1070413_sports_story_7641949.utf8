The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Limited extension for Gloster

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: Physio John Gloster, who took centrestage in the controversy over Munaf Patels fitness on the last tour of South Africa, will get a limited extension. His contract was till the World Cup. 

According to Board of Control for Cricket in India chief administrative officer Prof. Ratnakar Shetty, the extension (for now) is unlikely to be beyond December 31. 

Trainer (Greg) Kings contract is till the end of the year and, so, Gloster is also going to get an extension till then. Thats the think- ing at this point in time, he told The Telegraph. 

Gloster had been Bangladeshs physio before he succeeded Andrew Leipus in early 2005. And, so, he should feel at home when he lands with Team India in Dhaka on May 7. 

While Gloster and King will be there till December 31, theres uncertainty over who is going to occupy the other chairs, earmarked for the support staff, once the Bangladesh tour ends on May 29. 

Cricket manager Ravi Shastri, bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad and fielding coach Robin Singh have all been appointed till then only.

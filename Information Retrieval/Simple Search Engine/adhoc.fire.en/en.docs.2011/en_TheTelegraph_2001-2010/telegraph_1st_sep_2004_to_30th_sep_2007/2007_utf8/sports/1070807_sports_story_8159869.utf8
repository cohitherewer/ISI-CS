 Flintoffs action a worry: Donald

DEREK PRINGLE

 Allan Donald 

England will miss Andrew Flintoffs potent bowling at The Oval this week as they seek to beat India and draw the Test series with a team unchanged from the last Test. Yet being Freddie-less may be something they will have to get used to unless he heeds advice from Allan Donald and changes his bowling action. 

Donald, currently Englands bowling coach, suffered ankle problems of his own towards the end of his distinguished career, and is worried that Flintoffs troubles may continue unless he alters the landing position of his left foot. 

Freddie had a chat with me during the Old Trafford Test when he was still on crutches and asked if we should work on getting his front foot straight when he lands, Donald said. 

At the moment Freddies left foot points inwards when it lands and then it twists straight as he comes over the top. So there is a lot of counter-thrusting and bones and muscles are working against each other. Its a major issue and it could be a long-term worry. But its going to be difficult to change something that he has been used to doing for many years. 

Donald watched Flintoff during Lancashires Twenty20 Cup semi-final defeat to Gloucestershire at Edgbaston on Saturday. It was only Flintoffs third spell of bowling in a competitive match since undergoing a third operation on his left ankle at the start of June. Having monitored the allrounder from the TV gantry, Donald is cautious about making significant alterations. 

Ideally its something that we would need to work on in close season. But its up to Freddie whether he is willing to go through the process of trying to modify his action. At the moment hes just happy to be playing again... I think the selectors and coaching team are also excited to have him back and he will make a massive difference in the one-day Internationals. 

With 14 times his bodyweight going through his front ankle at delivery, the stress on the joint is huge. One potential remedy was to have special boots designed by Adidas. But creating footwear with the rigidity of a deep sea divers boot while retaining the lightness of a ballet pump is not easy and it remains a work in progress. THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

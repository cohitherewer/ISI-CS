 Ambiguities in Pak team statements

Mark Shields, the detective leading the Bob Woolmer murder inquiry, is planning to send a team of investigators to Pakistan to question the countrys cricket team about ambiguities in their statements to Jamaican police. 

Players and officials with the Pakistan squad, who were staying on the same hotel floor where Woolmer, the teams coach, was found unconscious on March 18, have already been interviewed by detectives. 

But analysis of the statements has revealed a number of inconsistencies that need to be cleared up, Shields said. Having reviewed the witness statements it is probable that we will need to clear up further ambiguities, he said. We may have to take further statements. 

Shields said it was highly probable that at some point in the investigation Jamaican officers would need to travel to other countries, including Pakistan. This inquiry has so many international dimensions it seems almost impossible to complete it in Jamaica. 

He said that it was too early to say how large the Jamaican team despatched to Pakistan would be or when it would leave. At the moment, its a question of building up any questions that we may have, Shields said. 

He refused to elaborate on what the ambiguities in the statements were but said it was possible they were innocent mistakes that occurred in the rush to question the team before they left the island. It may be those ambiguities are cleared up by the Pakistan liaison officers (arriving in Jamaica) so it may not be necessary to travel, but Im saying that its probable that at some point we may have to go and take further statements. 

One should never jump to the conclusion that because there is an ambiguity, that person is therefore a suspect. Its just that it is an ambiguity or something that needs clarification and in a murder investigation of this complexity every detail does count. 

Shields said he did not know if he would personally travel to Pakistan. Despite his detailed knowledge of the case, he said he had been stung by recent media reports accusing him of self-promotion for his vocal role in the investigation. 

Im balancing the operational advantages of me going and the knowledge that I have against the disadvantages of it being (perceived as) completely Mark Shields-centric. I dont really want that. I dont seek that. 

While in Pakistan, detectives would question any other potential witnesses who had been in Jamaica at the time of Woolmers murder, Shields said, including cricket fans and other tourists. As yet no-one outside Jamaica at the time of Woolmers death was being sought. 

His family has denied this, however. So far Jamaican detectives have taken statements from more than 60 witnesses and are currently re-interviewing all the staff at the Pegasus Hotel, where the Pakistan team was staying. Shields also revealed the investigation was being significantly broadened. 

Jamaican police are to travel throughout the Caribbean to question potential witnesses before the end of the World Cup later this month. 

Meanwhile a team of 20 officers at Scotland Yard in London is assisting the inquiry and Interpol, which this week sent two experts to the island to lend expertise, has offered to assist in any way it possibly can. 

Shields said that he foresaw no difficulties in seeking fresh statements from witnesses in Pakistan. We have had nothing but co-operation from the Pakistan government.

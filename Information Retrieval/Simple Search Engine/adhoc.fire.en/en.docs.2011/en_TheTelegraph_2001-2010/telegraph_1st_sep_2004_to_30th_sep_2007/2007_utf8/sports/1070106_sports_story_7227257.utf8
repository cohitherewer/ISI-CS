 Im relieved its over: Langer

Sydney: Justin Langer was so overcome with emotion in his Test farewell on Friday that he spurned the chance to hit the winning runs that sealed Australias first Ashes sweep in 86 years. 

Langer was batting at the SCG with fellow opener Matthew Hayden with Australia just seven runs from victory and 10 wickets in hand. 

Unbeaten on 20 and batting beautifully, Langers emotions began to get the better of him with the prospect of his retirement drawing ever closer. 

So he walked down the pitch to Hayden and asked him to finish it off as quickly as he could. Hayden obliged by thumping Sajid Mahmoods next ball over the fence for six then flicking a single off the following delivery. 

Im actually a little relieved its over, to be honest, Langer said. I said to Haydos in the last over Mate, Im getting a bit emotional here, how about a six and a one to finish it?. 

Next thing you know, bang! A six and a one and then you actually realise it was all over. Theres no denying when the national anthem was on and I saw my family up in the box and looked around for the last time before we went out to field, I knew that I was pretty upset. (REUTERS)

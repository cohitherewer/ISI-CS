 Sasikiran wins

Moscow: Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran scored his second win on the trot accounting for Sergej Dyachkov of Russia in Round IV of the Group A1 of Aeroflot International Chess Tournament here. 

After two victories and a loss, national champion Surya Sekhar Ganguly played it safe against Ni Hua of China and settled for a draw in a mere 12 moves of a French defence, while lady luck finally deserted WGM D. Harika as she was beaten by Zahar Efimenko of Ukraine. 

Former world junior champion P. Harikrishna was held to his third draw in the event when he failed to break the ice against Boris Savchenko of Russia and S. Vijayalakshmi did well to hold GM Thomas Luther of Germany. 

Worlds youngest GM Parimarjan Negi continued to struggle with his white pieces and was tamed by Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia.

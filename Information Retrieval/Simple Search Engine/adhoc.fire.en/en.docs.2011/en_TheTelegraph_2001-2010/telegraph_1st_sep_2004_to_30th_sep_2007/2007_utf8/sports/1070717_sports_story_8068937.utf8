 Muralidharan, Sangakkara on a high

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Two Sri Lankan players have made history on the LG ICC Test Player Rankings following their teams 3-0 series win over Bangladesh last week. 

Muttiah Muralidharan has become only the fourth Test bowler in history to reach 920 rating points and is the highest rated bowler for 24 years. He is now just two rating points behind Pakistan great Imran Khan and is fast catching up on Englands Sydney Barnes and George Lohmann, who are first and second, respectively, in the all-time Test bowlers list. 

Kumar Sangakkara became the first Sri Lankan batsman to pass the magic 900 rating points mark and he has moved up to 22nd in the all-time list for Test batsmen, according to an ICC release. 

Meanwhile, Zimbabwe, who have been out of Tests since January 2006, have dropped out of the ICC Test rankings list. 

Zimbabwe do not figure in the ICCs annual list released on Monday because they have played two Tests fewer than the minimum of 10 required for inclusion in the table involving only series completed after Aug. 1, 2004.

Manchester: West Indies suffered an embarrassing batting collapse to end their first innings on 229 and give England control of the third Test on the second day at Old Trafford on Friday . 

The tourists were making steady progress, in reply to Englands 370, having reached 216 for four. However, they lost their last six wickets for 13 runs in 44 balls. Their innings lasted just 52.4 overs. 

Spinner Monty Panesar took four for 50 and seamer Ryan Sidebottom three for 48 to gave England a healthy first innings lead of 141. 

England reached 34 for one before the close of play after opener Andrew Strauss barren spell continued when he was leg before to Fidel Edwards without scoring. He is without a fifty in his last 15 Test innings. 

Alastair Cook was 12 batting, and appeared to have survived a good caught behind appeal off Corey Collymore. Captain Michael Vaughan was on 10. 

England started the day brightly when they added 74 to their overnight total as Ian Bell was out for 97. 

West Indies then lost stand-in captain Daren Ganga leg before to Steve Harmison in the three overs possible before lunch. 

Harmison struggled with his line all day, and though he occasionally showed evidence of the form which brought him 11 wickets on the ground against Pakistan last year, he was largely disappointing and erratic, as was Liam Plunkett. 

Harmisons other wicket to dismiss Runako Morton (35) was a frustrating reminder of his capabilities as the batsman edged a lifter to Strauss at first slip. West Indies slumped to 157 for four when Devon Smith fell to Panesar seven balls after tea to give the left-arm spinner his 50th Test victim. 

The six-wicket burst to follow would have dented West Indies morale after what had been a promising comeback match following their record defeat in the second Test at Headingley.

 No County for Asif, Gul

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has decided not to allow fast bowlers Mohammed Asif and Umar Gul to accept contracts with English counties this year, an official said on Wednesday. 

The bowlers have faced fitness problems and it hit the performance of the team. For the moment we have told them not to accept any contracts, Zakir Khan, director of cricket operations, said. 

Gul, 24, had a contract offer from Gloucestershire while Asif, who missed the World Cup with an elbow injury, had previously played for Leicestershire. (Reuters)

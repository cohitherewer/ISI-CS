The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Murali gives himself 2-3 years

Colombo: Sri Lankan spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan has said he wont be associated with the game after retirement. 

I am not thinking about it because I have played this game since I was six or seven So when I retire, I will retire properly, Muralidharan said. 

Theres more than cricket you can do, there are so many things in life. If you get bored you can play a club match on Sunday or something to keep my mind occupied on cricket, he was quoted as saying. 

The 35-year-old said he has not yet decided about retirement, but would play till things work smoothly for him. 

Its difficult to say. Ive just turned 35, may be at 37 I could think of pushing myself for one more year. Im not thinking far ahead, just about one or two years Then if everything goes right, Ill keep on playing. If everything goes wrong, Ill say thank you very much, Muralidharan said. 

He also said the next World Cup, in Asia, was a distant dream. 

It depends on how the team does. Its a long time... This is 2007 and 2011 is too far away. I will play for another two or three years and see how things go, he reiterated.

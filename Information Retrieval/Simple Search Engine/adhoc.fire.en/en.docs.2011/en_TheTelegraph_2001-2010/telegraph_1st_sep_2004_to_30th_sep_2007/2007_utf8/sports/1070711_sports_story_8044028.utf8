 Narain: Ill be delighted

New Delhi: Narain Karthikeyan would be delighted to return as a Formula One driver after being linked with a possible move to Spyker, he said on Tuesday. 

The Indian, whos now the Williams test driver, and Austrian Christian Klien are in contention to replace Dutch driver Christijan Albers. 

Spyker Team boss Colin Kolles said Karthikeyan, who raced for him at Jordan in 2005, was on his list of options. 

Colin had a chat with me at Silverstone, the 30-year-old Karthikeyan said. Ill be delighted to get back to racing, but Im definitely enjoying my time at Williams. 

His manager Mark Perkins, who expects a decision in the next few days, said from Monaco: Spyker hope Narain can do a better job than Albers is doing at the moment. We will know by the end of the week.

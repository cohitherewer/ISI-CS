 Pakistan to leave sans pace duo

Karachi: Pakistans World Cup squad will leave without fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif from here on Thursday with little being done by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to clear the duos position about their availability for the tournament in the West Indies. 

Pakistan team media manager Pervez Mir said Asif would return from London on Thursday and Shoaib would be back on Friday. 

The Board will than carry out an assessment of their fitness and also the dope tests which they have to clear before it is known when they can join the team, he said. 

Mir also said it was not certain that allrounder Azhar Mahmood, who replaced the injured Abdul Razzaq, will leave with the squad. We are still waiting for clearance from the International Cricket Council (ICC) to include Azhar... Until we get the green signal, he cant go, he said. 

But he said that since Pakistans first match was on March 13 against the West Indies, both still had time to join the squad in the latter stages of the tournament. 

Coach Bob Woolmer said the real test for teams in the World Cup would begin from the second round onwards.

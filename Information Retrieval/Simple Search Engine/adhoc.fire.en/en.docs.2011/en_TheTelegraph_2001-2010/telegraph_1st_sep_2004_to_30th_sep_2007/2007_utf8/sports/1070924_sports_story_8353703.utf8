 Sreesanth, team fined

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: India seamer Sreesanth has been fined 25 percent of his match fee for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct during his sides semi-final against Australia in the ICC World Twenty20 championship in Durban on Saturday. 

According to an ICC media release, the Indian team has also been fined for maintaining a slow over-rate after falling one over short of its requirement when time allowances were taken into consideration. The players were docked five per cent of their match fees with Dhoni, as captain, fined double that amount, a 10 per cent punishment. 

Sreesanth pleaded guilty to a Level 1 offence in a hearing convened by Emirates Elite Panel ICC Match Referee Chris Broad after play concluded on Saturday. 

The player accepted he breached clause 1.5 of the ICC Code of Conduct which relates to excessive appealing following a delivery he bowled to Matthew Hayden during the fourth over of Australias innings. 

Explaining his decision, Broad said: When appealing for a decision a player has to realise he only needs to ask the question once and not over and over again, especially after the umpire has already turned down the appeal.

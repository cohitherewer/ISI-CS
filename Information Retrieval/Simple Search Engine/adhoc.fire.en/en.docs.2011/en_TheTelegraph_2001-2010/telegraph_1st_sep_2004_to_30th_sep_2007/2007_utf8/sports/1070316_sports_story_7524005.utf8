 Meghna in 3rd spot

Gurgaon: Indian challengers Meghna Bal and Irina Brar slipped down the leaderboard as Chinese Taipeis Tseng Ya Ni and Thailands Russamee Gulyanamitta took the top two places after the second round of the $ 100,000 DLF Womens Indian Open Golf Tournament here on Thursday. 

First round leader Meghna with a two-over 74 dropped to third position, while Irina fell victim to strong winds and had a poor round of seven-over 79 for the shared ninth spot with Chinese Taipeis Shih Huei Ju and Japans Rie Shiraki. 

Meghna, who started on the 10th tee, began well and with one birdie on 14th, she turned in one-under. But on the front stretch of the course and her second nine, she bogeyed the second, fourth and sixth holes to surrender her lead. 

I wasnt able to control my shots. My shots did not fall on the targeted areas. It affected my concentration and I sort of lost control. However, I checked my game by adopting cautious play and finished with a two-over par score. Ill try and regain something tomorrow, she said.

 Md. Sp. rally to beat E. Rly 

 - Nigerian Paul shines on debut

Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting made a mess of a comfortable position and survived several scares before overcoming Eastern Railway 3-2 in their Sahara CFL Premier Division match on Thursday. 

Bapi Haldar silenced the home crowd in the ninth minute, giving Eastern Railway the lead in the very first concrete move of the match. A. Jothi Kumar, however, negated the advantage within 11 minutes. He and his new Nigerian teammate Paul MacJames Nwachuku scored one each in the second-half to put the home team on a vantage ground. 

But a costly mistake by Mohammedan Sporting defence provided the visitors glimpse of hope when Eastern Railway earned a penalty and Santanu Bit converted it without any fuss. 

 If the rearguard function created a few wrinkles on coach Shabbir Alis forehead, Paul MacJamess performance on debut might give him some breathing space. The Nigerian, who has come from Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting, was clearly the pivot around which the teams attacks revolved. 

Mohammedan Sporting will take on Mohun Bagan on Sunday, which will bring the curtains down on the Premier Divisions first-leg. Ali may take some comfort from Pauls availability for that crucial match. The way he scored the teams second goal with a sweetly-timed side-volley, was a class act. 

 However, Basudeb Mondal in midfield and Paul upfront engineered the hosts fightback. It was a cross from the Nigerian, which found the goalkeeper Kalyan Lodh partially block a KP Muneers head and Jothi Kumar, lurking nearby, snapping up the rebound in the 25th. 

Then, eight minutes into the second session, Paul brilliantly connected a Rajib Ahmed centre from the right to make it 2-1. On the hour mark, Jothi Kumar was in action again, scoring his second goal with a back-header. 

Daniels handball inside the box gave Eastern Railway a chance of fightback. But Ali had the last laugh.

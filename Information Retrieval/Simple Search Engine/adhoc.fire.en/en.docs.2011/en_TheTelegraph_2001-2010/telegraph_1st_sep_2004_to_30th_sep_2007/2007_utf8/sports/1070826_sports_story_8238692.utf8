The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Today, the BCCI banks heavily on Sachin

 - From being asked to show cause to being used as a mascot 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sachin Tendulkar 

 Calcutta: The Indians didnt 

 play the perfect game (like England did at the picturesque 

 Rose Bowl) on Friday, but still won. Of course, had England 

 paced their innings a tad more professionally, even 329 

 wouldve been overhauled. 

 The win, though, couldnt have come at a better 

 time. 

For one, the Indians simply had to avoid going 0-2 behind in the seven-match series. Then, as significantly, in a war now being fought on many fronts, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) needed a boost from an on-field victory. 

The Indian Cricket League (ICL) may be attracting the Avishek Jhunjhunwalas, but the real business is in the safe hands of the Sachin Tendulkars. 

Ironically, the one who laid the platform for the confidence-lifting win Sachin is somebody the BCCI wanted to fix not too long ago. 

All because the mandarins were upset that Sachin (and Sourav Ganguly) had emerged as pillars of player-power and would call the shots in a bigger way once Greg Chappell returned home. 

In fact, soon after the World Cup, Sachin had even been asked to show cause why action shouldnt be taken for Chappell-specific comments in the media. 

Chappell was then the darling of hardliners in the BCCI and, on the pretext of encouraging youngsters, Sachin and Sourav werent picked for the three ODIs in Bangladesh. 

Today, the same gentlemen (who are themselves hardly accountable but hold others accountable for everything) are intending to use Sachin as their No. 1 mascot in the war against the Kapil Dev-headed ICL! 

Privately, Sachin must be quite amused that hes going to be used to score points when doing so isnt part of his approach to cricket and life. 

 Earlier in the summer, hours after 

 becoming the first to cross 15,000 runs in ODIs, Sachin 

 had spelt that out in a chat with The Telegraph 

 (from Belfast). 

 Ive never been the type to prove a point Ive never been one to try and retaliate in one form or the other I enjoy batting and try for the maximum I have a job Have a responsibility towards the team I do the best I can 

Sadly, the umpires arent doing their best. 

If the otherwise efficient Simon Taufel erred at Trent Bridge (first innings of the second Test) and denied Sachin a hundred, Ian Gould did the same in Bristol. 

According to an agency report from there, Sachin reacted rather philosophically: Theres nothing one can do about it. I used to feel bad, but now things have come to such a state, that I just laugh and carry on 

Its worth noting that hes a firm believer in destiny. 

Sachin, however, had been very upset at Trent Bridge, after being given out on 91. 

With a Code of Conduct in operation, Sachin didnt say anything publicly, but is known to have asked teammates why me all the time? 

 Exactly. Why him?

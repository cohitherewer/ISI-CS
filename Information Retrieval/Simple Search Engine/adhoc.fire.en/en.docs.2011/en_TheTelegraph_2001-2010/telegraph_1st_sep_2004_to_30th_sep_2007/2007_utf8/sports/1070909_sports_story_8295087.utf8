 Afridi denies allegations

Karachi: Pakistans flamboyant allrounder Shahid Afridi on Saturday denied provoking Shoaib Akhtar and claimed Mohammed Asif could have suffered more injuries had he not stepped in to stop the brawl in Johannesburg. 

After being recalled from the ICC World Twenty20 squad, Shoaib on Saturday alleged that Afridi was behind the brawl, which led to the Rawalpindi Express hitting Asif with a bat on his left thigh. 

Afridi was responsible for the fight. He made certain remarks about my family. It all started as a joke It wasnt serious until the comments from Afridi. 

I had no fight with Asif, he is like my younger brother. I did not hit him intentionally It was an accident, Shoaib said in a press conference on Saturday. 

Afridi, however, strongly denied the allegations and said he was surprised at Shoaibs statement. 

I cant say much because I am bound by the central contract. But it is a fact that Shoaib has been facing one problem or the other in the last two years He is frustrated, Afridi said. 

I have had a good relationship with him so I dont know why he has targeted me. But he is lying and it would be better if everyone asked Asif what happened. 

I know Asif could have suffered more injuries had I not stepped in, he said.

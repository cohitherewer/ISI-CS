Bangkok: Tim Cahill scored in stoppage time to earn Australia a 1-1 draw against Oman in their opening Asian Cup match on Sunday. 

The Everton midfielder saved Australias blushes when he slammed the ball into the back of the net after a frantic goal-mouth scramble, denying Oman an unexpected victory over the tournament favourites. 

Oman, who are 26 places below Australia in the world rankings, led for almost an hour after Badar Mubarak capitalised on some sloppy Australian defending to score in the first half. 

Oman missed another three clear chances to score again in the second half and were left to rue their poor finishing when the Socceroos equalised in torrential rain to leave all four teams level in Group A following Thailands 1-1 draw with Iraq on Saturday. 

The Australians, who are tipped to win the title because of their European-based players, struggled to impose themselves on Oman, lacking cohesion both in attack in defence. 

They created few real scoring chances despite playing most of the second half with Mark Viduka, Harry Kewell, John Aloisi and Cahill up front and were lucky to escape with a draw in their first appearance at the Asian Cup.

 Gillespie to miss tie vs England 

Gros Islet: New Zealand fast bowler Shane Bond said on Wednesday his time in the police force has made him a better player, especially given his wretched injury record. 

He was still a serving policeman during the last World Cup and had to take leave to play in the 2003 tournament. 

It was a good job. It was the making of me as a cricketer. It forced me into tricky situations, the 31-year-old told reporters. 

Bond has suffered a series of career-threatening injuries in recent years including a severe back problem but is confident he is now as fit as he can be ahead of their World Cup group C opener with England on Friday. 

Meanwhile, New Zealand fast bowler Mark Gillespie will miss Fridays group C match with England, a team spokesman said on Tuesday. 

Gillespies bowling arm became numb on his arrival in the West Indies earlier this month following a rare reaction to a throat virus.

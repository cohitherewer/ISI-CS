 Vettori to lead in Tests too

Wellington: New Zealand have appointed left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori as captain of their Test team in place of Stephen Fleming. 

Fleming is quitting one-day Internationals but plans to continue in the Test side for the time being. 

The selectors are looking to the future and have recommended that Daniel assume captaincy of the Test team as well as the one-day team, NZ Cricket chief executive Justin Vaughan said in a statement on Wednesday. 

Fleming, 34, said it was the right time to retire from one- day Internationals, and signalled that his Test career may also be coming to an end. 

I shall continue playing Tests as long as I have the desire and skills required to contribute. However, it is likely that the coming New Zealand summer will be my last home series, he said in a statement, adding that he would have liked to carry on as Test captain. 

Vettori, who already leads the one-day side and has been Flemings Test deputy, is currently leading New Zealand at the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa. 

New Zealand tour South Africa and host England this season. 

Fleming captained the New Zealand Test team to 28 wins and 25 draws in 80 matches over 10 years. 

He played 280 one-day Internationals, 218 as captain, leading New Zealand to 98 wins and scoring 8,037 runs, a national record. 

Fleming stepped down as ODI captain after the World Cup in the West Indies. He had been at the helm for more than a decade. 

He announced his decision after the 81-run defeat in the semi-final against Sri Lanka and said he took the step in a bid to provide fresh energy to himself as a batsman. 

I had made up my mind long time ago though NZC wasnt privy to it as I didnt want to hamper the preparations for the World Cup, Fleming, who was largely acclaimed as the most cerebral of contemporary captains, said after quitting. 

Im just 34 and I think Ive still got some good batting years ahead of me So I want to concentrate on that for a while, and put a lot of energy into our Test cricket. In some ways your energy levels are sapped when you captain the side, and I want to play with a fresh mind, and finish off my career with some stats that I think Im worth.

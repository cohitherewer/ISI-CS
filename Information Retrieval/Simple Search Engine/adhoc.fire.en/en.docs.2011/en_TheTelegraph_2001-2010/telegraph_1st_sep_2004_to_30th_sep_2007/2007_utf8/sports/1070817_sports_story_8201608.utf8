 IFA watchdog for derby

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The Indian Football Association (IFA) has set up a three-member committee as a watchdog of the match officials performance during Fridays derby. 

The state governing bodys move was followed by Mohun Bagans prompt climbdown from their demand of an outstation referee, clearing uncertainty over the match. The derby is scheduled to kick off at 5.30pm at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

The committee will be represented by former footballers Sukumar Samajpati, Bikramjit Debnath and Fifa referee Milan Datta. 

We are welcoming and respecting the IFA decision. Well play tomorrows match under protest, said a Mohun Bagan official after the club executive committee met on Thursday. 

Mohun Bagan were protesting over the referee Dilip Ghoshs controversial role in abandoning a CFL Premier Division match in which East Bengal were trailing 0-2 to Peerless with a little over 20 minutes to go. 

The IFA league sub-committee, looking into the matter, also met on Thursday, but deferred its decision till Monday. 

The committee received the video clippings sent by Mohun Bagan (about East Bengal-Peerless abandoned match) quite late and therefore, couldnt arrive at a decision, IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly said.

 Magny-Cours retained

Paris: Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone on Tuesday did a spectacular U-turn on his decision to wipe the French Grand Prix venue of Magny-Cours from the 2008 season, saying the circuit will be retained for next year. 

In a meeting with France prime minister Francois Fillon, Ecclestone agreed to include the circuit for next year and possibly for 2009. 

Ecclestone backtracked on a decision he made in May.

 Flintoff in race for fitness

London: England allrounder Andrew Flintoff faces a battle to be fit for the first Test against the West Indies beginning Thursday. 

Flintoff will test his injured left ankle on Wednesday before deciding whether to play in the first Test against the West Indies starting at Lords on the following day. 

He didnt bowl today, spokesman Andrew Walpole said on Tuesday. He will bowl tomorrow and we will assess his chances of playing then. 

Flintoff felt discomfort in his left ankle while bowling for Lancashire. 

Well know more after Ive run around and done what I need to do, but Im hopeful for Thursday, Flintoff said. 

When its the ankle, the alarm bells start ringing a little bit, but Im still hopeful.

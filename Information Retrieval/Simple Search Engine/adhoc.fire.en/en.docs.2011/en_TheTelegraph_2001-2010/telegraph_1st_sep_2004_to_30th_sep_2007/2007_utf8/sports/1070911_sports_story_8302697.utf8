A STAFF REPORTER 

 Yousuf was adjudged Test Player of the Year 

Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar was the only Indian to figure in either ODI or Test team, announced by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in Johannesburg on Monday. 

Sachin was named one of the openers (along with Matthew Hayden) in the World ODI Team of the Year. 

According to information received here, while no Indian was there in the Test XI, the one closest to making the cut was Zaheer Khan, who was named the 12th man, if it was any consolation. 

Australian captain Ricky Ponting was named Player of the Year. The 32-year-old also scooped up the Captain of the Year award. 

Pakistan run machine Mohammed Yousuf was adjudged the Test Player of the Year. Ponting was also named captain of both ODI and Test sides. 

The teams were picked by a specially appointed selection panel chaired by Sunil Gavaskar.

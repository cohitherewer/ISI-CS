 Younis not keen

Karachi: Pakistan vice-captain Younis Khan is reluctant to step up as captain, a PCB source said on Monday. The board will meet on Tuesday to discuss Inzamam-ul Haqs successor. In an interview to a TV channel on Monday, Inzamam said: Younis is an automatic choice. 

However, Younis is apparently unwilling. He is not comfortable leading the team as he believes he doesnt have the required support within the team, the source said. 

Imran Khan, however, felt: Younis must not refuse. If he didnt want to lead he should not have accepted to become vice-captain. (Reuters)

London: England verus Germany at Wembley is a match-up that rekindles memories of great games of the past, from the 1966 World Cup final to the semi-final match of Euro 96. Its a shame many of the stars will be missing this one. 

When the two teams take the field at the rebuilt 90,000 capacity stadium for Wednesdays friendly, Wayne Rooney, Steven Gerrard and Owen Hargreaves wont be in the line-up for England, while Germany will be without Michael Ballack, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Lukas Podolski and Miroslav Klose. 

David Beckham has a lingering ankle problem, while Michael Owen is just returning to fitness and may only play one half at best. 

The list of injuries goes on and rival coaches Steve McClaren and Joachim Loew are frustrated they wont have their first-choice line-ups for what is traditionally a full-blooded confrontation. 

We are going to be missing experience, routine and leadership, said Loew. Those missing are not easy to replace. It would have been good if we had the best possible team for this game, but we are not going to complain. Its a joy to be playing in this stadium. 

England-Germany games always have an edge and no one will be taking it easy in this game even if it is a friendly ahead of European Championship qualifiers next month. 

Like Loew, McClaren hopes to have all his stars back by the time England plays Euro 2008 home games against Israel and Russia, matches his side must win to stay in contention for the two qualification spots from each group. 

What I hope to do is by the time Israel and Russia come along, it will be an extra three weeks they will have had to train and play, the England coach said. 

McClaren said Beckham was ready to play. He trained this morning and looked very, very good, McClaren said on Tuesday, adding that he was happy to have Beckham back in the squad. 

Weve said right from the beginning hes back in the squad because of his performances, hell stay in the squad because of his performances and hell play because of his performances and thats it, McClaren said. 

Well monitor his progress in LA in the MLS and well monitor it when hes here. 

Owen, who came on as a substitute for Newcastle United on Saturday, will start with Jermain Defoe or Alan Smith likely to partner him in attack. 

Although nothing is at stake apart from pride, Wednesdays game will have a special feeling because it is the first between the two sides to be played at the new stadium. 

What weve got tomorrow night is a very important game there are no friendlies for England. Its at Wembley, 90,000 people, eight million watching on TV. Thats some friendly, said McClaren. 

Germany were the last visitors to play in the old Wembley in October 2000 and won 1-0 in a qualifying game for the 2002 World Cup. 

England coach Kevin Keegan quit only minutes after the final whistle and his replacement, Sven-Goran Eriksson, guided the team to a spectacular 5-1 victory in Munich a year later, the last time the two teams met. 

Meanwhile, Olympique Lyon forward Karim Benzema and Bolton Wanderers striker Nicolas Anelka were been named in the France squad that will face Slovakia in a friendly on Wednesday, the French federation said on Tuesday. 

Also in the squad are Patrice Evra (Manchester United), Claude Makelele and Florent Malouda (Chelsea), Thierry Henry (Barcelona) and Patrick Vieira (Inter Milan). 

Defenders Lilian Thuram and William Gallas, who were injured during training on Monday, were left out. Thuram injured his ankle, and Arsenal captain Gallas hurt his adductors while training for Wednesdays match, France coach Raymond Domenech said. (AGENCIES)

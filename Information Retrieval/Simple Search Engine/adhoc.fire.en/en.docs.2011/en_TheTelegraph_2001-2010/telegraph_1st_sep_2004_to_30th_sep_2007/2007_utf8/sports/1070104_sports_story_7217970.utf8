The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Today, theres more conviction in my decision making

 - Graeme Smith on captaincy and himself 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE

 Graeme Smith 

Cape Town: Graeme Smith, who led the World XI in the first officially sanctioned Super Test 15 months ago, is weeks away from completing four years as South Africas captain. On Monday, in the lead-up to the final Test, he took time off to speak to The Telegraph incidentally, his only one-on-one with any Indian publication during Team Indias tour. 

The following are excerpts 

On Graeme Smith the person 

(Laughs) Im actually a lot more relaxed than people think... I enjoy time with family... With friends and enjoy having a bit of fun... The normal things, you know... Im just 25 after all! In this new year, though, I would like more time for myself as one can get carried away by the job... 

On the time it took to settle down as captain 

I got the job when I was 22 (after South Africas early exit in the 2003 World Cup)... You dont, obviously, realise the enormity of what comes with the captaincy till youre in the job... Of course, I had an idea, but the demands on you as a person and as a leader are huge... I had to come to terms with things in the set-up, outside the set-up and the good thing is that teammates were superb... Being young, the pressure aspect was the most difficult to deal with... Pressure from the public, from the Media... 

On having grown as captain 

My decision making as a 22-year-old probably wasnt as good... As captain, I trust my gut feelings a lot more now... Today, theres more conviction in my decision making... Then, for example, I wasnt sure about giving Polly (Shaun Pollock) an extra over or two or getting (Jacques) Kallis into the attack... Things like that. 

On the marks he would give himself on ten 

Things have gone well, a lot of young guys have come in... Theres more direction, I think, as things had been all over the place... Weve done well as a one-day unit, but need to get better in Test cricket... Were still searching for a few answers in the longer version... One area we do need to develop is the spin department... Ive made quite a few trips to the subcontinent (as captain) and the absence of quality spinners was felt. Im pretty happy, but wouldnt like to rank or rate myself... In saying that, I accept mistakes have been made, but I dont have a regret... Mistakes have been part of my learning process and have helped make the person I am. Im comfortable with who I am and where I am. 

On support from predecessor Pollock 

He has been superb, right down to bowling extra balls to me at nets. Polly is a very special man and, today, is at ease with himself. Thats good for me and great for the team environment... (After a pause) In fact, four years ago, hes the one who picked up the phone and said I must take the captaincy... 

On whether he has looked up to any cricketer 

Ive admired Gary Kirsten and (the late) Hansie Cronje... However, while growing up, the key for me was to be myself... You may become like your hero, but then you arent you ... Even when I became captain, I wanted to retain my personality... Be myself... Being true to myself has been important... Its not that I havent taken bits from people Ive admired, though... 

On seeking help 

Frankly, its tough finding one person to bounce ideas off... I go to Jimmy Cook... I go to a couple of leading businessmen... I read biographies and autobiographies... Ive read Steve Waughs books... One can learn from other captains, but most of the stuff really is the same... My view is that you could over-complicate things... Thats the fear. 

On having worked with coach Mickey Arthur for well over a year 

Till Mickey came along, coaches did change... Its nice that Ive had some time with him...The captain-coach relationship is important and there has to be communication... Weve struck a good balance... Captains in cricket play a much bigger role than in other sport, which is why the lines of communication (with the coach) have to be very good... Mickey and I are working towards a common goal and have a similar vision... 

On his vision 

To have a team which is mature and drives itself... That if we reach the World Cup final, I have a bowler who is confident of bowling the last over... I want the players to have the freedom to express themselves... Not that theyre asked to do this, but not to do that... Expression is essential and its important to realise who stands where. For example, (Herschelle) Gibbs wont ever be a Kallis and vice-versa.. . Let me put it this way: Some things are non-negotiable, but I want every guy to be himself. Thats part of this teams environment. 

On pressure and criticism 

(Laughs again) Sometimes it gets to you... You cant get away from it and being an international sportsman, youve got to cope... You develop your own mechanisms to deal with both... If you live your life by what people say about you, then its going to be an up-and-down one... Its important to find the path you want to take and to stick to it... The Media and public tend to get very emotional... So, stick to the path and try to stay away from the rubbish... We werent the worst team when we lost the Wanderers Test and werent the best when we won at Kingsmead... I keep telling the young players that its important to put their pegs on the ground, find the level where they want to go... I dont have an issue with constructive criticism... 

On what he has learnt most in almost four years as captain 

Look, at 22, youre growing both as a person and a cricketer... Ive matured, got stronger as a person and a cricketer... Having stability as a person and a cricketer has been a challenge... Adapting to the changing circumstances... As a batsman, Ive become more powerful... Have fine-tuned shots, have begun to play more shots... Ones personality changes. 

On whether he has looked up to anybody outside cricket 

Nelson Mandela... Im passionate about my country and he has played a huge role... He was able to work towards a new South Africa, a better South Africa... Hes a mentor for everybody... In other sport, Ive admired titans like Lance Armstrong and Tiger Woods. Both are amazing and have had that extra to handle situations of immense pressure. Tigers mental strength is awesome. 

On whether hes conscious that being the South African captain hes even more of a role model 

Im conscious, but its important to have a release... To be normal... (Adds laughing) Thank goodness, Ive done the right things. Of course, one is aware that after a few drinks some may try and test you... Staying true is important. 

Finally, on everyones attention being on the soon-to-begin World Cup 

Weve been talking and planning... However, its quite relaxed here... The selection of the squad, though, will be difficult... Given the talent around, I know some guys are going to be disappointed, but that cant be avoided.

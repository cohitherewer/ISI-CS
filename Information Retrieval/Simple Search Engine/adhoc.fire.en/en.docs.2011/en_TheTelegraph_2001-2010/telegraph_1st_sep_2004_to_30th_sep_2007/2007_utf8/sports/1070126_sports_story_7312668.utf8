 Paes out of mixed doubles

Melbourne: Leander Paes and local girl Samantha Stosur bowed out of the Australian Open mixed doubles in the quarter finals here Thursday, going down in straight sets to Canadas Daniel Nestor and Elena Likhovtseva of Russia. The third seed Indo-Australian pair was outclassed 6-7 (4-7), 1-6 in an hour and 20 minutes. 

Paes and Stosur paid the price for squandering seven of their nine break points, while their opponents enjoyed more success, capitalising on five of their eight opportunities. The third seeds only won 53 per cent of points on their first serve, compared to the 76 per cent of Nestor and Likhovtseva. 

The first set, which lasted 46 minutes, could have gone either way, but Paes and Stosur ended on the receiving end in the tie-breaker and then failed to raise their game in the second set. 

Nestor and Likhovtseva ran through their opponents to reach the semi-final where they will meet Kevin Ullyett of Zimbabwe and South Africas Lizel Huber, who got the better of Australians Nathan Healey and Bryanne Stewart 6-4, 3-6, 10-7 in a thrilling contest.

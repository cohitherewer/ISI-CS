Calcutta: Inzamam-ul Haq had voiced it the other day, and now Sourav Ganguly also believes that with world champions Australias strength receding, the upcoming World Cup in the Caribbean will have no favourites. 

Yes, the World Cup is very open now, Sourav said on Monday, replying to a query on whether the Ricky Ponting-led sides recent performance offered other contenders a level-playing field in the showpiece tournament. 

The former India captain, however, didnt find much of a difference between the 2003 side which lost to Australia in the final and the current one. 

Ninety per cent of the players are the same, but we have a good addition in Mahender Singh Dhoni, remarked Sourav, who will be the brand ambassador for Chirag computers for a year. 

Are too much expectations leading to pressure on him? Sourav replied in the negative. 

Ive been handling it for the past 12 years. I know how to space it out, when to train and when to do other things. 

Later in the evening, the Cricket Association of Bengal gave Sourav a warm send-off for the World Cup. Former Bengal Ranji captain Premangshu Chatterjee handed him a trophy, which CAB called a symbol of affection. 

Among other dignitaries present on the occasion were Chuni Goswami who led Bengal in both cricket and football and Asian Games silver winning heptathlete Soma Biswas. 

The organisers were seen in poor light when Soma was invited to present a bouquet to Sourav only towards the end of the function, while Goswami was ignored. 

The way he regained his place in Team India is fairytale stuff. Every sports person should draw inspiration from him, Soma maintained. 

Sourav also spent about an hour with cancer patients at the childrens ward of Thakurpukur Cancer and Research Hospital.

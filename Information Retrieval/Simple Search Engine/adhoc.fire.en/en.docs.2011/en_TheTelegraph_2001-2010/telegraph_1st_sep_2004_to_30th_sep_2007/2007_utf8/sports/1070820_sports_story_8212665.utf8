 Anand in final with Aronian

 Viswanathan Anand 

Mainz: Viswanathan Anand beat Uzbek GM Rustam Kasimdzhanov to finish on top in the preliminary rounds and enter the final of the Grenkeleasing Rapid Championship. 

Anand warded off a threatening Kasimdzhanov (2.5) in the first game and drew the remaining two against Levon Aronian of Armenia (3.5) and Etienne Bacrot of France (2) to aggregate 4 points. 

He will meet Aronian in the final the second against the Armenian in three days. Anand, who lost to Aronian in the Chess960 on Friday, is eyeing his 10th overall title here. 

In the Ordix Open Rapid meet, GM P. Harirkishna emerged the best Indian after the first day, scoring 4.5 points out of a possible 5. Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran had 4 points, while GM Parimarjan Negi scored 3.5 points. 

With six rounds to go as many as six players, including Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine, share the lead with 5 points. 

Kasimdzhanov proved a much tougher opponent than Anand had expected. Playing white, the Uzbek GM achieved a good position and exerted pressure on both flanks . Anand defended for a long time and a lapse of concentration by Kasimdzhanov led to complexities in Anands favour. However, Kasimdzhanov hung on for a draw. 

In the second round, against Aronian, Anand followed a prepared line in which he sacrificed an exchange for a pawn and active play. But after some small inaccuracies by Anand, Aronian returned the material and the game was drawn. 

Anand then played out an easy draw with Bacrot in the final game, while Aronian worked hard to get the same result to set up the final with the Indian. (PTI)

 Churchill get Singapore invitation

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: After Mohun Bagan and Mahindra United, it might be the turn of Goas Churchill Brothers to leave the shores of the country during the National Football League. 

While Mohun Bagan and Mahindra will play the AFC Cup, Churchill, according to club sources, have been invited by the Singapore Football Association to take part in the Singapore Cup, considered one of the best tournaments in the region. The invitation has been forwarded to the club by the Singapore FAs director of competition, Quah Kimsong. 

The problem is that the tournament preliminaries will be held between April 29 and May 7. The NFL is unlikely to be over before May 10. It remains to be seen whether the AIFF gives permission to the Goan club to play in the prestigious tournament.

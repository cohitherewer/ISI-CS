 Galaxy not worried by Becks injury

Los Angeles: A fragile foundation to the American football universe was bolstered here when Los Angeles Galaxy general manager Alexi Lalas said he was not worried about David Beckhams knee injury. 

England star Beckham suffered a strained right knee ligament in Real Madrids 1-1 Spanish league draw with Getafe on Sunday, the club saying Beckham will need about four weeks to recover. 

US supporters and Major League Soccer breathed a sigh of relief that the potential high-profile poster man for the sport was not hurt worse. 

We are aware of the injury sustained by David Beckham, Alexei Lalas said on Monday. We do not expect this injury to affect his arrival in Los Angeles or his debut with the Galaxy. (AGENCIES)

 The height of the matter

New Delhi: Are hulks taking over cricket? Australian 

 captain Ricky Ponting said the other day that the era of 

 outstanding small batsmen like Sachin Tendulkar 

 and Brian Lara was over. 

 Ponting counted himself among the small, 

 although he is five feet and ten inches. Perhaps, by Aussie 

 standards, he is not tall. 

In the Australian captains view, power batsmen like Englands Kevin Pietersen and fellow-Australian Matthew Hayden will dominate henceforth. Don Bradman, the greatest of them all, was only 57, Sachin is even shorter at 55 which has earned him the tag of Little Master. The original Little Master Sunil Gavaskar is 54, but Lara is not doing all that bad at 58. 

In contrast Pietersen is 64 and another dominating batsman Hayden is 62. 

Ponting had similar views about the trend in bowling as he said taller bowlers were proving to be more dangerous and hard to deal with. If you are short, you need to be exceptional. 

But Indias own Ramakant Desai, a genuine quicky in his era, was not a tall fast bowler at 56, nor was the devastating West Indian Malcolm Marshall, who was 510 like Ponting, but took as many as 367 wickets in 81 Tests and picked 157 in 136 one-dayers at an express speed. 

On the other hand, West Indian Joel Garner is 68 and Glenn McGrath towers at 66 while Brett Lee is above 61. 

Does height matter, then? Most cricketers of the past think it doesnt. 

Former India captain Chandu Borde feels height has nothing to do with batting skills, as batsmen improvise to cope with circumstances. 

It is just Pontings observation. Now-a-days batsmen improvise a lot. They scoop the ball and play new shots. Small batsmen also hit tall bowlers. Height has nothing to do with batting skills, he said. 

Former India player and coach Madan Lal said it was true that cricket was becoming a power game but added skills and techniques would remain as important as ever. 

Javed Miandad feels cricket is a mindgame. Look, cricket is played in the mind and the basics remain the same. Obviously, you have different batsmen of different styles and physique in different eras. But the basics remain the same, Miandad said. 

He felt the reason batsmen like Pietersen, Matthew Hayden or Chris Gayle, who rely on power, were dominating was because the quality of bowling had gone down. In our days just facing the West Indies pace battery was a mighty experience. I dont think height or weight makes much of a difference, he said. 

Miandads compatriot Sadiq Mohammed echoed Miandads views, saying cricket was still a game of beauty and timing. 

You look at the history of the game. The shorter batsmen like Gavaskar or Lara have dominated and I dont think that will change in future, said the former Pakistani opener. 

Another former Pakistan captain and wicketkeeper, Rashid Latif, however was in sync with Ponting. Yes, the times are changing. I thing the big guys are dominating and will continue to dominate because they have certain advantages on the pitches that international cricket is played on these days, he said. 

 A tall and powerful player 

 like Hayden or Pietersen can negotiate the height of ball 

 better and punch it with more power, Latif said.

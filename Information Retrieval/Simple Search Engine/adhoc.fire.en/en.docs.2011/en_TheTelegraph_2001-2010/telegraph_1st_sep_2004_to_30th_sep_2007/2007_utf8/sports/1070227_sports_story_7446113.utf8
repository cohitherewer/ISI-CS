 Anand back in joint lead

Morelia (Mexico): Viswanathan Anand jumped back into joint lead with a smashing victory over Peter Leko of Hungary in the seventh round of Morelia-Linares chess tournament. The Morelia leg finished Sunday. 

With the next half slated to be held in Linares from Friday, Anand now shares the lead with 16-year-old Magnus Carlsen of Norway who played out an easy draw with Russian Peter Svidler. 

The four-draws in the sixth round between the eight participants was probably a lull before the storm as the day produced as many as three decisive games and Carlsens game was also well contested.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Biswal wish

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: National selector Ranjib Biswal feels that if India want to do well in the Twenty20 World Cup, this tournament must be used for the preparation. 

We have to take this meet as part of our preparations and I feel all the star players should play this tournament, he said Tuesday. 

Biswal said that he will ask Sourav to play in the next round. I expect him to play if Bengal qualify for the next round, the selector said.

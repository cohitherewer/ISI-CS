The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Focus on Ranadeb

Ahmedabad: The city will get a taste of relatively unknown brand of fast-paced and attacking cricket when the Gujarat-leg of All India Twenty20 tournament gets underway at nearby Motera on Sunday. 

In this form of cricket, batsmen always look to be positive and aggressive, said Subramaiam Badrinath, skipper of Tamil Nadu, who will take on Ranji Trophy runners-up Bengal in the opening match of group B on Sunday. 

There is no time to settle down. There is little time to think and one has to maintain a particular run rate right from the very first ball, Badrinath said.He felt an exciting contest was on the cards as his team had experienced batsmen in himself, Dinesh Karthik and Hemang Badani while Bengal had a good bowling attack led by Ranadeb Bose. 

Manoj Tewari felt that though the batsmen could play improvised shots, bowlers could also play a part and emerge as match-winners.

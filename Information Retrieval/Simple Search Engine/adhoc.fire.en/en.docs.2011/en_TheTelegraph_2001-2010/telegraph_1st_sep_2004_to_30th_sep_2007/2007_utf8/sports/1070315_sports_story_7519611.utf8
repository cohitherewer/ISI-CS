 Random tests on Rana, Umar 

Karachi: Pakistan pacer Rana Naved-ul Hasan and Umar Gul were summoned by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for random dope test after their opening World Cup match against the West Indies. 

ICC had summoned Umar and Rana for a random dope test after the World Cup opening match, according to a newspaper report which quoted Pakistan team management. 

The games governing body has a zero tolerance policy on doping and it has promised to take strong action against doping offenders during the showpiece event in Caribbean. 

Doping has been an issue of concern for the Pakistan team and many believed that Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif were not sent for the World Cup as their body still had traces of banned nandrolone which could have put them in trouble during random dope testing. 

Pakistan lost their inaugural match to the West Indies by 54 runs on Tuesday.

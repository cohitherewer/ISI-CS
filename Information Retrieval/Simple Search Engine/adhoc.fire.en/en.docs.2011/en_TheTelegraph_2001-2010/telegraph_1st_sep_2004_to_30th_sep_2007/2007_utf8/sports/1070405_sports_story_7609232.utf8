 How could anyone kill Bob: Houghton 

JAYDEEP BASU 

New Delhi: It was almost 10 years ago when two roly-poly men, who have a common first name, met for the first time at the Newlands ground in Cape Town. 

The formal introduction was made by an owner of a local football club and Bob Houghton was instantly impressed by Bob Woolmers personality. 

I was coaching in China at that time, Houghton, now Indias national football coach, recalled on Wednesday. 

I was in leave in South Africa and went to the Newlands ground to watch Western Province playing a cricket match. There I met Woolmer. Someone told him about my background and like all Englishmen, he made his interest in football clear to me Our relationship clicked instantly, he added. 

The chanced meeting in Cape Town started an acquaintance between the two men of different professions, which remained intact till tragedy intervened last month. 

Houghton, who also lives in Cape Town, is still in a state of shock and cannot accept the fact that anyone can murder a man as genial as Woolmer. 

Houghton, who also lives in Cape Town, found the former South Africa and Pakistan coach a highly professional man and well-natured. He was such a friendly person and deeply involved in cricket. How could anyone kill such a good person like him? wondered Houghton. 

The national football coach, who returned to India from Cape Town on Tuesday after nine weeks for medical reasons, revealed that he has a liking for cricket as well. 

I remember Woolmer would regularly come to the Newlands ground near my house and I would often drop in to watch a cricket match. There I used to have interaction with him. Surely, he was a man who was never tired of talking for hours on cricket, Houghton recalled. 

As a seasoned coach who has travelled all over the world for the past 30 years, Houghton knows how stressful a coachs job is nowadays. 

Woolmer was a huge man with a big heart and perfectly capable of carrying on with the pressure (of the job) and remaining calm, reminisced Houghton. 

But what could he do if someone entered in a secured zone like hotel and murdered him? he asked. 

Houghton hopes the murderer of Woolmer doesnt go scotfree. That would be sad. They should find out the culprit and punish him. I knew the man (Woolmer). His death is loss for the entire sporting fraternity, he said.

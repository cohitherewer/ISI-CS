 Taking stock of a failed campaign

 Simon Hughes

 Kevin Pietersen 

The fallout from Englands winter of discontent has already claimed a prominent victim. These ratings illustrate how Duncan Fletchers players fared and where they stand as the new regime takes shape. 

Michael Vaughan (3/10) 

The captain will be restored to No. 3 in the batting order for the West Indies series but, after such a long lay-off, is liable to be solid rather than spectacular. Should be discounted for one-day Internationals owing to lack of real power. 

Andrew Strauss (4) 

Should score more freely against variable West Indian attack than he did against the Australians. Ordinary World Cup but worth persevering with in the one-day side for his left-handedness, as long as he exhibits the positivity he displayed against South Africa. 

Ed Joyce (4) 

Obvious talent, but given too much responsibility by asking him to step into Trescothicks shoes and set the tone for the innings. Seems unsure of his own game, and may be too laconic to be a real star, but his eye-catching style will keep him on the fringes. 

Ian Bell (5) 

Some decent innings but still too prone to getting out playing half-hearted strokes when well established. This has to be a mental flaw, as if he doesnt really believe he is entitled to make big scores. Definite starter for the Tests, marginal for one-day matches. 

Kevin Pietersen (9) 

Easily Englands best player in both forms of the game and after some infuriatingly tame dismissals in the World Cup, Pietersen seems to have learnt to be less impetuous and to pace an innings better. His chief weakness is a tendency to clip the ball in the air on the leg side. England could utilise his brilliant ground fielding to better effect. 

Paul Collingwood (6) 

A doughty fighter whose contributions have a habit of fading through a series/tournament. Maybe teams learn to counter his leg-side bias. Will eventually be competing with Bell for a Test place, but a certainty for the one-dayers. 

Andrew Flintoff (5) 

Batting was uncertain all winter and should be dropped to No.7 in Tests. Could be tried as an opener in one-dayers, but his technique is probably not up to it. Bowling seemed to have lost its edge. 

Ravi Bopara (6) 

An exciting discovery. Nerveless, resourceful batsman, excellent fielder and better-than-average bowler. Should be groomed to bat at five in one-day matches and, if he can correct a rigid plant of the front foot, maybe in Tests. 

Jamie Dalrymple (3) 

Unable to make an impression with the bat and appeared to be trying too hard with his off spin. Has gone backwards. Needs solid county performances and to display better control with the ball to regain his place, but has potential. 

Paul Nixon (8) 

Inspired pick. Did far more than expected, especially with the bat, showing what could be achieved with a well-honed individual method and self belief. Has created a blueprint for wicketkeepers one-day role, but at his age, cannot expect to play again. 

Saj Mahmood (4) 

Has decent pace, good variety and is a genuine wicket-taker. However, he is still far too inconsistent. Must go back to county cricket for a while to hone the basics and the art of bowling. Good athlete but batting potential is limited. 

Liam Plunkett (3) 

Very fit and enthusiastic but his bowling is hit and miss owing to a kink in his action. Needs to smooth this out or his assets accuracy and movement will be surrendered. His strong character is beneficial but not a first-choice pick. 

James Anderson (5) 

Steady rather than spectacular, unlucky to be denied several close lbws. Not as dangerous as he was before his injury, but more consistent. An obvious long-term successor to Hoggard but needs to acquire more wicket-taking nous. 

Monty Panesar (7) 

Few wickets in the World Cup but never let England down and has developed more variety with some slower, loopier deliveries and a slingy, quicker one. Excellent basic game and will only improve. Should be an automatic selection for all forms of the game. 

Stuart Broad (5) 

One brief glimpse illustrated raw potential but a lot more bowling education (and physical development) required. Good agile fielder and capable batsman who handled the pressure of Saturdays climax very well. Should be ready in a year.

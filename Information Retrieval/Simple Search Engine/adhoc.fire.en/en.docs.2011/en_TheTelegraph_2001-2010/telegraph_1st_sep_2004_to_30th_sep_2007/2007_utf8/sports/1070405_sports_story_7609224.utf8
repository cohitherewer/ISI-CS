Calcutta: After the Mohammedan Sporting resurgence story, it was East Bengals turn to produce an improved performance in the National Football League for the ONGC Cup at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday. The red-and-golds logged full points from their 11th round clash against Hindustan Aeronautic Sports Club (HASC), winning by the odd goal in five. 

Edmilson Marques scored a brace and Boniface Ambani netted the other for the home team. Kutti Mani and Xavier Vijay Kumar were on target for HASC. 

East Bengal went for the kill from the word go and drew first blood in the eighth minute. Ambanis measured cross from the left was tapped in by Edmilson. 

The second goal came in the 19th minute, an Ambani pile-driver going in off the sidepost. 

HASC pulled one back eight minutes later. Mani made no mistake in guiding home a cross from Xavier. 

East Bengal, who led 2-1 at half-time, looked shaky after change of ends because of a vulnerable defence line. Syed Rahim Nabi and Cristiano Oliviera were not up to the mark, while Covan Lawrence had to be withdrawn in the 19th minute when he pulled a hamstring. And Anupan Sarkar, who replaced Lawrence, was playing after an injury-induced lay-off. 

Carlos Roberto Pereiras problems will be compounded if Lawrence doesnt recover soon. 

East Bengal went 3-1 up when Edmilson chest-trapped a Dipankar Roy cross perfectly and placed the ball precisely past the HASC custodian in the 80th minute. 

A cornered HASC launched some counter-attacks through captain Xavier, Satish Kumar and Mani. And even managed to reduce the margin in the 82nd minute. Satishs through pass was nicely slotted home by Xavier. 

East Bengal are now on 19 points from 11 matches, while HASC stay on six.

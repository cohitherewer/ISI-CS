 Yuvraj happy to pay back England

Durban: Hit for five sixes in a row by Dimitri Mascarenhas in the sixth ODI against England earlier this month, Yuvraj Singh is finally relieved the he has paid England back in their own coin. 

I was hit for five sixes by Dimitri at the Oval. The number of phone calls I got after that...I mean I dont get that many calls even after I score a century. So I said God, this is not fair. You got to give me a chance, and I guess I got the chance today, Yuvraj said after hitting Stuart Broad for six consecutive sixes en route to his 58 off 16 balls. 

Yuvraj was involved in an altercation with Andrew Flintoff and went berserk with the bat after the incident. Asked what had transpired between them, Yuvraj said: When you are playing international cricket, things like this do happen Obviously he is a great allrounder and off the field we are good friends 

It happens and its part of the game. 

In a lighter vein, Yuvraj said he was happy to prove himself to be a better slogger than his captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. 

We had just 2-3 overs to go and Dhoni told me that we should keep a left hand-right hand combination. But I said No, you go in front of me. You are a better slogger. So he went, but after the innings I said no mate, Im a better slogger. 

India captain Dhoni said: After the last match, I said that we have played well but in patches. Today, the boys really gave their 100 per cent. Yuvraj was outstanding and Veeru and Gautam provided us with a good start. The start wasnt a worry for me, as I knew, if they stayed at the wicket, they would give us a solid start. They never threw their wicket away. 

We started with 180 in mind but were fortunate to get to more than 200 Tomorrow its another do-or-die situation and we have to be positive in our approach. 

Cricket manager Lalchand Rajput was all praise for Yuvraj and felt the batsmans on-field war of words with Flintoff spurred the lefthander to unleash his fury against Broad. 

We wanted to keep him to fire in the last four overs but I think the exchange of words, that verbal thing with Flintoff, charged him up, Rajput said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 An opener 

 must have a presence

 - Former England captain Graham Gooch on opening 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL

 London: 

 For many, Graham Gooch remains a model opener. The genial 

 54-year-old former England captain, who amassed 8,900 runs 

 in Tests (20x100 including a 333 at Lords) and 4,290 

 in ODIs (8x100), spoke to The Telegraph on Friday.

 The following are excerpts

 On what keeps him busy, 

 besides media assignments

 I gave up the head coachs 

 role at Essex two years ago, but Im still coaching 

 the batsmen there Im also an ambassador for the County 

 I try and get sponsors Of course, Ive also started 

 the Graham Gooch Scholarship and intend sponsoring the Essex 

 Academy My partner, Julia, works with me to raise funds 

 for the Scholarship Among the beneficiaries have been Alastair 

 Cook and Ravinder Bopara.

 On why some teams, like 

 Pakistan, are struggling to put together an effective opening 

 partnership

 (Grins) Such things probably 

 work in cycles When I began playing for England (1975), 

 India had one of the best if not the best opener 

 of the modern times Sunil Gavaskar I dont know 

 why some teams struggle For me, the best place to bat is 

 at the very top of the order.

 On opening

 Well, youve got to face 

 the new ball It could move around quite a bit, both early 

 on and later But an opener gets all the opportunities 

 Openers get the chance to dictate terms Its an awesome 

 feeling I cant understand why some are reluctant 

 to open I backed my abilities to cope with the challenges 

 of opening As you know, Id started off (both at Essex 

 and for England) in the middle-order.

 On who made him open

 Keith Fletcher (former England 

 captain and coach) Incidentally, Id batted at No.5 

 in my maiden first-class match, against Northants (in 1973), 

 an attack which included Bishan Bedi and Mushtaq Mohammed 

 As it turned out, opening the batting improved my game 

 Improved my concentration.

 On the Indian openers, 

 Wasim Jaffer and Dinesh Karthik

 I like them Jaffer has the correct 

 technique and Karthik keeps himself and the scorers busy 

 Who knows, Jaffer could become a great opener.

 On the top openers (alphabetically) 

 at this point in time

 Cook, Matthew Hayden, Graham Smith 

 Cooks very mature, is a smart lad At 22, he can only 

 get better Its remarkable that hes got six 

 Test hundreds in just over a year Haydens the most 

 dominant opener Takes the game to the opposition In fact, 

 in the one-dayers, he frightens the opening bowlers Sees 

 the ball early and goes for his shots Smiths a tenacious 

 opener Wears his countrys badge on his heart He 

 does work the ball across the line a bit and that poses 

 problems However, he likes to get on with the job, quite 

 like Hayden An opener must have a presence Smith has it.

 On the ideal opening combination

 A left-right one Batsmen with 

 contrasting styles One should attack, the other graft 

 Id attack, while Geoffrey Boycott and later, Michael 

 Atherton, would graft You dont want too much of the 

 same.

 On whether he envied any 

 opener

 Not envied, but I loved watching 

 Barry Richards He had the model technique An upright stance 

 Had all the shots Its a pity he could play only a 

 handful of Tests (because of South Africas isolation).

 On the element of luck

 You do get slices of luck The 

 key is to capitalise on them If a batsman who averages 

 40-50 is dropped early, then he must at least score 80-100 

 I keep telling youngsters that the next ball is important, 

 not the one which has gone. I learnt it from Barry Richards.

 On whether age is a factor

 No Something tells you from within 

 Its the desire which is important The enjoyment 

 I played for England till I was 41.

 Finally, the advice he 

 gives to young openers

 Play straight and know how to 

 work your way out of tough situations Learn to enjoy the 

 challenge and learn to adapt to different conditions Obviously, 

 you cant play the same way everywhere For example, 

 if the ball is swinging, youve got to play late Keep 

 the head still, but be flexible with your game plan. If 

 you hit the ball straight and keep it down, theres 

 not a lot that could go wrong.

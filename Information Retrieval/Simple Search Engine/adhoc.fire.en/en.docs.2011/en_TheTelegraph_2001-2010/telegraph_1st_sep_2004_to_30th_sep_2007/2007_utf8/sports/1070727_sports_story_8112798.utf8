 Fleming may join ICL

Melbourne: New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming may abruptly end his international career to join the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL), according to a media report here. 

Fleming has been approached by the ICL officials and the lucrative offer might prompt the Kiwi skipper to quit international cricket and join the league, reported an Australian newspaper. 

The report quoted unnamed sources saying that Fleming had been offered a deal worth $440,000 a year to skipper any one of the six teams in the proposed league. 

Why is that awkward if you are planning retirement? asked a source close to the ICL negotiations. 

Fleming retired from ODI cricket after leading the side to the semi-finals of the World Cup in the West Indies and is expected to lead New Zealand in the tour of South Africa which, incidentally, coincides with the first ICL Twenty20 League. 

With Brian Lara, Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne likely to join the bandwagon, Flemings development will be a huge boost for the organisers. 

Chairman of the ICL, Kapil Dev said Warne, McGrath and Lara are on the verge of signing contracts. The discussions are in the final stages, he said. 

However, contrary to Kapils claims, Warne and McGraths managers have denied that the two cricketers are close to joining the ICL. 

Warnes manager, James Erksine, said Kapils claims were nonsense and the spin wizard would not be a part of it if there was going to be a conflict with the BCCI. 

Erksine said that he had spoken to Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland about the matter. 

I asked him (Sutherland) politically what the situation is, Erskine told the daily. 

He tells me that the BCCI are going to be in a situation where theyre probably going to get upset by it. We will wait and see what the political fallout is before anyone puts pen to paper. 

McGraths manager, Warren Craig, also said the pacer was no closer to signing up ICL. 

Dean Jones, one of the executive directors on ICLs board, also said Kapils claims were not correct. 

He hasnt been briefed properly. Hes firing from the hip. Everythings fine. Its just normal Indian press and a few guys not communicating. Discussions are still continuing. 

Jones also said though Damien Martyn and Justin Langer had rejected similar offer, he was in touch with some other Australian players, who are all set to join the league. 

Weve spoken to a lot of players around the world and havent had too many knock-backs, Jones said. Were not asking any players to break any contracts with their board, far from it. 

Apart from Fleming, New Zealand spearhead Shane Bond and Sri Lankas retired allrounder Russel Arnold have also been approached to join the league.

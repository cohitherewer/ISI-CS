 Dont make Dravid a scapegoat

Bangalore: Veteran leg-spinner Anil Kumble on Friday deplored attempts to make Rahul Dravid a scapegoat for Indias debacle in the World Cup and warned against any drastic action. 

At a press conference where he announced his retirement from one-day cricket two days after returning from the Caribbean, Kumble maintained that no emotional decisions should be taken in the aftermath of the debacle. 

It is unfortunate that Dravid is being made a scapegoat. Captaincy is a hard job. Its a team loss. People think that players are not disappointed after losing a match. But players and their families really feel hurt and disappointed, he said. 

We need not take any drastic steps. I feel that the World Cup squad was the best that was selected. Unfortunately, it did not go our way. 

Kumble said the batting did not live up to expectations and a lot of things needed to be discussed about the teams poor performance. 

It was one of the bad starts in the World Cup. Our batting did not live up to expectations. I dont think we need any drastic changes in the team. A lot of things need to be discussed. I am sure we will come up stronger after this World Cup defeat, the 37-year-old leg-spinner said. 

Asked about the previous World Cups he had played, Kumble said: We had a good chance in the 1996 World Cup. In 1999 we lost to Zimbabwe which cost us the World Cup. In 2003, it was a great opportunity and we reached the final but lost to Australia. 

Kumble said he was keen to finish his ODI career on a high note, but was disappointed that it did not happen the way he had wished. (PTI)

 WI fined for slow over-rate 

Georgetown: The West Indies team has been fined for slow over-rate during their 113-run defeat to Sri Lanka on Sunday. 

Match Referee Jeff Crowe imposed the fines after Brian Laras side was ruled to be two-over short of target at the scheduled finish of the Sri Lanka innings when time allowances were taken into consideration. 

In accordance with the ICC Code of Conduct regulations governing over-rate penalties, players are fined five per cent of their match fees for every over their side fails to bowl in the allotted time, with the captain fined double that amount. 

As such, Lara has been fined 20 per cent of his match fee while his players have each received 10 per cent fines, an ICC statement said.

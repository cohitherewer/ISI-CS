 Everyone has to bat well: Dravid

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Port of Spain: Rahul Dravid feels that they can handle the pressure against Sri Lanka on Friday and batting will remain the key to winning. 

Were trying to play good cricket. There is not much difference between the two teams and if we can play to potential we will beat Sri Lanka, he said on the eve of the match. 

The boys can handle pressure. Weve handled such situations in the past and can do that again. We know each other well. The concept of a neutral venue may change things a bit. But weve won previously in such circumstances. We just need to get our focus right. 

The boys have been batting well for the last one and a half years. We need to rectify what went wrong in the first match Everyone is talking about getting a good start but it is not always that a good start determines the course of the match. Everyone has to bat well. Im happy with the way we batted against Bermuda but tomorrow (Friday) will be crucial, he added. 

Dravid felt motivation would not be a problem. We always knew that the game against Sri Lanka would be crucial for us. We had prepared accordingly and knew we had to beat Sri Lanka, he said. 

Its just that weve put more pressure on ourselves by losing to Bangladesh. We always talk about tight games of the past to motivate ourselves. We are a resilient side and have the ability to perform. 

Sri Lanka coach Tom Moody said they were looking to finishing it off positively. We have the confidence and one advantage is that we have played good cricket on this wicket. Its not an easy one to adapt and weve got over some tricky hurdles. 

Moody also felt that depth and variety in the Lankans bowling will give them an added advantage.

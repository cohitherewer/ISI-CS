 Police searching for 3 Pakistani fans

Police investigating the murder of Bob Woolmer are looking for three fans who were with the Pakistan team in the days before the coach was killed. 

The three, who were close to the players and appeared with them at press conferences and after games, are believed to have left Jamaica soon after Woolmers death. 

Asked about the fans, Mark Shields, the Deputy Police Commissioner of the Jamaican police, said: We are looking for them to eliminate them [from our inquiries]. 

The latest twist came amid fevered and unsubstantiated rumours in Jamaica that closed-circuit television footage clearly shows two suspects entering the hotel corridor on Woolmers floor in the early hours of Sunday morning. 

But detectives may have to wait some time before the CCTV images can be studied in detail. One police source said on Monday that the quality was very poor, and an expert may be needed to enhance the images before police can identify who was near the room. 

In the Jamaica Pegasus hotel the cameras do not cover the door of the room where Woolmer was staying nor the corridor but they do cover the lifts and the back stairs. 

[Agencies add: Deputy commissioner of police Mark Shields, who is leading the probe, however said the claim was baseless and totally untrue. There can be nothing farther from the truth, they are telling you a load of crap, quot; Shields was quoted as saying. 

Shields has said that although the cameras only recorded activity in the corridors and the footage does not show who went into or came out of Woolmers room, CCTV footage was one of the most crucial pieces of evidence.] 

The three fans being sought by police are all Pakistanis and have been named as Hamid Malik, Jundie Khan and Irfan Chaudary, a medical technician. Malik carried a mobile phone with a British number and is believed to live in Britain. Khan was said to live in Florida and Chaudary in New York. 

Jamaican police are not singling the three out for special attention, but want to talk to them because they had ready access to the Pakistan team. Shields has said that anyone with access to the hotel needed to be interviewed and fingerprinted, if only to rule them out. 

A fourth Pakistani fan linked to the team lives in Jamaica and runs a car dealership near the hotel. Tariq Malik drove team members around the island and brought halal meat to the Pegasus for them to eat. He has not been in hiding. 

Shields all but discounted that the murder was committed by a local Jamaican but did not rule out a professional hit or that the murder was linked to match-fixing or illegal gambling.

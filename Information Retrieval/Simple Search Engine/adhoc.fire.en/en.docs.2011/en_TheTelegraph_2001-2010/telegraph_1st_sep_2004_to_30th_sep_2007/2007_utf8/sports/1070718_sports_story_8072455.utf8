 Kyrgyzstan, Syria likely to take part 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Syria and Kyrgyzstan could be the only two teams ranked higher than India to take part in the ONGC Nehru Cup in Delhi next month. 

According to the AIFF sources, the five-nation meet will have three other teams Cambodia, Bangladesh and hosts India for the round robin tournament, to be played from August 17 to 29. 

Top two teams will meet in the final again. While the winners will get $40,000, the runners-up will be richer by $30,000. 

We are still trying to make it a six-team tournament, claimed an official on Tuesday. Though Iran had earlier expressed their inability, efforts are still on to invite the Asian giants or their neighbours Iraq. 

According to sources, South American nation Bolivia, ranked 92 in the Fifa rankings, were also ready to take part but they demanded huge appearance money. 

The AIFF, in consultation with the national coach Bob Houghton, is deliberately inviting those teams, to whom India can pose some challenge. 

There is no point making it like the Nehru Cups of the 90s, said an official. In those days, top teams used to come here and beat India hands down. It had only dented our playerss confidence further.

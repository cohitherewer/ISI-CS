 Im trying to be more careful now, says Imran Nazir

Karachi: Flamboyant Pakistani opener Imran Nazir has vowed to dispense with his daredevil batting style in order to click in the long run. 

Nazir made a comeback to the Pakistan team early this year on the South Africa tour and played in the World Cup. But except for a fifty on the South Africa tour and a century against Zimbabwe in the World Cup, he kept falling to reckless shots, which prompted many critics to question the wisdom of recalling him. 

Nazir, who is attending a training camp in Lahore under the supervision of former captain Wasim Akram and Mudassar Nazar, said he was trying to be careful in shot selection. 

I know what people say about me, but I have benefited a lot from attending the coaching camp being held at the National Cricket Academy. Akram has been very helpful. 

I am now trying to be careful with my shot selection and trying to mentally prepare myself to get over the reckless approach as it doesnt pay in the long run, he said. 

Nazir said he wanted to cement a place in the Pakistan Test and ODI squads and would work hard towards this. 

On new Pakistani captain and his Sialkot team mate Shoaib Malik, Nazir said the current skipper had all the qualities to lead the national side successfully. 

I think Malik has all the requirements of a good and sensible captain. He did a good job in the recent one-day series in Abu Dhabi. 

He can last for a long time because he is a good performer and can get good performances out of the other players as well, added Nazir.

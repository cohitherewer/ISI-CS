 Lobbying for Whatmore draws Kapils flak 

New Delhi: Former captain Kapil Dev has lambasted senior cricketers for reportedly lobbying for a foreign coach. 

Kapil was apparently baffled by the fact that although the senior players had never worked with Dav Whatmore, they threw their weight behind him, after the Australian decided against an extension of his contract with Bangladesh. 

The players have never worked with Whatmore, how can they recommend his name, a miffed Kapil told a TV channel on Sunday. 

During Indias tour of Bangladesh, Sachin, Anil Kumble, Sourav, Dravid and Laxman reportedly met BCCI president Sharad Pawar and requested him to get a foreign coach. 

A seven-member special committee is going to sit in Bangalore on Tuesday to select Indias next coach. Whatmore is favoured to get the job. 

According to him, if the preference for a foreign coach continues, things will come to such a situation one day that Sachin (Tendulkar), V.V.S. Laxman, Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly will be in contention for the coachs job but would never get it. 

Kapil felt projecting Whatmore as the front-runner for the job undermined the seven-member committees authority. (PTI)

Glasgow: The 1996 World Cup-winning captain, Arjuna Ranatunga, is keen on coaching Team India. 

Im definitely keen, but sending a formal application wont look good Im available if somebody from the Indian establishment wishes to interact with me, the iconic Sri Lankan told The Telegraph on Tuesday. 

He added: My name, I understand, was raised during the first meeting of your special committee (in Bangalore) Apparently, somebody said I didnt have any experience as a coach I dont see that as a liability. In any case, can a Sachin Tendulkar be coached? Its the mental preparation thats important 

The six-member special committee has three former captains Srinivas Venkatraghavan, Sunil Gavaskar (who is close to Arjuna) and Ravi Shastri. 

As the Rahul Dravids are still without a coach, its bound to meet again, sooner rather than later. 

Arjuna, who is in his second term as a Member of Parliament, pointed out he wouldnt have a problem getting leave. Theres a protocol in place and Ill have to apply to the Speaker Leave from Parliament wont be an issue 

As his wife and children have shifted to London (for better education), Arjuna makes quite a few Colombo-London trips every year. Its from London that he drove over for what would have been an explosive Indo-Pak ODI. 

Sadly, not one ball was sent down. 

Among those Arjuna met was Dravid. Oh, I got a lot of stick in Sri Lanka for backing you in the World Cup he said in mock anger. Pretty embarrassed, Dravid replied with a sorry and thanks for supporting us. 

According to Arjuna, the World Cup format needs to be changed. 

What should be taken into account is that teams could have a bad day In my opinion, the 1992 round-robin structure, where each side played at least eight matches, was good That allowed teams to recover from one or two bad games Pakistan even took home the Cup 

Dravid indicated he, too, favoured a review.

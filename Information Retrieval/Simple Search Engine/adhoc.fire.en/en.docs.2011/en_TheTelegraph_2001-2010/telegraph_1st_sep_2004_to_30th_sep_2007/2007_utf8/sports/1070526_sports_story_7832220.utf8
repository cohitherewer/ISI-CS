 Chopra opens with two-over 72

Fortworth: Daniel Chopra opened his campaign at the Crowne Plaza Invitational at Colonial with a two-over 72 on the opening day. 

The Swede of Indian origin started the day with back to back birdies on first and second holes, but thereafter his form slipped. 

He bogeyed the sixth and seventh, birdied the eighth but again bogeyed the ninth and turned in even par 35. On the back nine, he bogeyed 13th and 15th and had no birdies for a 72. 

Among other Asians, Koreas Choi Kyung-Ju posted a 67 to lie in tied ninth spot, while Kevin Na was four under after eight holes before play was suspended owing to inclement weather in the first round. Anthony Kim took the clubhouse lead with a 63. 

The 21-year-old Kim was among 57 players exactly half of the 114-player field to finish play Thursday before an afternoon thunderstorm flooded the course. Play never resumed after the second weather delay of the day, and the round was suspended. 

Ted Purdy, at seven under before a bogey on his 16th hole, and Jeff Maggert, completed rounds of 64. (PTI)

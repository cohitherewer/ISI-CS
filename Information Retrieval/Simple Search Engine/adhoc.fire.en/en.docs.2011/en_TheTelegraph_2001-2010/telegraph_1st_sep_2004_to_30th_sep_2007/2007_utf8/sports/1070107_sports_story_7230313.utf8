 Hewitt 

doubtful

 Australian Open 

Sydney: Lleyton Hewitt has pulled out of next weeks Sydney International with a calf muscle injury and is in doubt for the Australian Open beginning January 15 in Melbourne. 

Just a day after Roger Rasheed quit as coach of the two-time Grand Slam champion, Hewitts manager Justin Cohen Saturday said the 25-year-old Australian has a torn right calf muscle that required physiotherapy and rest. 

Asked if Hewitt was in any doubt for the season-opening Grand Slam, Cohen said: Its hard to say at this stage. 

Its extremely minor, he added. Were managing it and hell have physio for the next three or four days. 

The injury is another major setback for the 2005 Australian Open runner-up and four-time Sydney champion who will fly to Melbourne without Rasheed and having played just 1-1/2 singles matches in almost four months. (AP)

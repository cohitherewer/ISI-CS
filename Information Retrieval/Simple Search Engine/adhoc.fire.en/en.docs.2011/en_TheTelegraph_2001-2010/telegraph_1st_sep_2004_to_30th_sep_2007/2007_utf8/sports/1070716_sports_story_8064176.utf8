The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ritwik hopes to return a better player

MADHUMITA GANGULY

Calcutta: Ritwik Bhattacharya has a never-say-die attitude. An attitude which has helped him overcome several odds in life, including a recent injury. 

The world No. 60 tore a cartilage in his left knee while playing a tournament in Canada in February, and had to undergo surgery which put him out of the circuit for some time. But he didnt mope over the setback, working on his weaknesses while undergoing rehab. 

Ritwik believes he will return to the circuit a stronger and better player. 

Currently in New Delhi, Ritwik will return to England on Wednesday, where he spends a lot of time training under Neil Harvey. He will return to the basics, play some practice matches and hopes to make his competitive comeback in a tournament from August 15. 

What made Ritwik take to squash in the first place? Actually, squash chose me, laughed Ritwik. 

An avid sports lover, he used to play a lot of games before squash took precedence while he was at a boarding school in Dehra Dun. Then it was the zonals and inter-states. 

A chance to play in the world juniors in Cairo, when he was barely 15, clinched it for him and there was no looking back. 

What targets has he set for himself over the next two-three years? The next couple of years are crucial for me as Im 27 now, said Ritwik, who turned pro in 1999 and was world No. 38 last year. But Im not setting myself a specific goal. I just intend to remain fully focussed, taking each match as it comes. 

Take Tiger Woods, Roger Federer or Adam Gilchrist, continued Ritwik. They take things match by match, shot by shot, putt by putt. That is the way forward. That is what I try to do, too. Putting myself under undue pressure by thinking of rankings is not something that I do. 

The sport Ritwik plays 26-27 weeks a year has taught him a lot about life. Values, diligence and the ability to think positive and to fight all odds, he said. Squash gave me the opportunity to travel the world before I turned 20, an education which cannot be replicated by any academic course. 

Ritwik became India No. 1 in 1998. At that time, the gap between Indian squash and the best in the world was yawning. Not so anymore, Ritwik was glad to point out, as a lot of youngsters are taking to the game in earnest. 

He is pretty confident that India will soon see many more Saurav Ghosals, Joshna Chinnapas and Ritwik Bhattacharyas in the near future.

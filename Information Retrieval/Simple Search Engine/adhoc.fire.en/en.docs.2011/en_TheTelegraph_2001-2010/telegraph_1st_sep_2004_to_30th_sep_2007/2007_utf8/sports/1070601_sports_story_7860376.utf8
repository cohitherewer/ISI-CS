 Anand wants to regain world title as No. 1

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Viswanathan Anands focus is on regaining the World Championship crown in Mexico later this year. 

This is one tournament which I want to win back this year as the world No. 1. The last time I won it was in 2000, but at that time I wasnt the worlds top player, Anand said during his visit to the city for an NIIT programme. 

Anand, who officially became the world No. 1 in April, didnt single out any particular player as a tough opponent. All players are dangerous and I dont want to specify anyone, he said during a question-answer session. 

Vladmir Kramnik and Veselin Topolov, among others, will be pushing Anand in the battle for the top spot in Mexico. The world meet will be held from September 11-October 1. 

The Super Grandmaster was all praise for Calcutta, where he played his first GMs tournament way back in 1986. 

I love playing in Calcutta Chess prospects look bright here, he said. 

He picked Surya Sekhar Ganguly and Sandipan Chanda for special mention. 

Both Ganguly and Chanda are doing very well Particularly Ganguly who has it in him to excel further, Anand said. 

Ganguly is ranked No. 209 in the world, while Chanda is at 310. 

Anand described his title-winning effort at the Morelia-Linares Super Grandmaster meet as his happiest moment. 

By winning the meet, I became world No. 1 and that was my best moment, he said. 

Anand, however, advised the world chess federation (Fide) to find a balance between broadening the player base and maintaining the standard of competition while deciding the criterion for title norms. 

Fide has, in recent years, lowered the Elo rating required for players to gain titles. Consequently, there has been a spurt in the number of International Masters and Grandmasters. 

For the record, India now have 15 GMs. A far cry from 2000, when there were only five Anand, Dibyendu Barua, Pravin Thipsay, Krishnan Sasikiran and P. Harikrishna. 

Anand later played simultaneously with young talents from six cities Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai, besides Calcutta. Representing the host city was Sayantan Das.

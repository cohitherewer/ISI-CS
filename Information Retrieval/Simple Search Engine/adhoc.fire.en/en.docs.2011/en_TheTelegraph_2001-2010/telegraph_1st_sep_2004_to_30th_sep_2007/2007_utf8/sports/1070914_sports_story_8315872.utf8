 Tiwary fails to impress

 Aakash Chopra is batting on 137 

New Delhi: Parthiv Patel and Aakash Chopra struck impressive centuries to help India A pile up 354 for four against South Africa A on the first day of a four-day cricket match at Feroz Shah Kotla ground here on Thursday. 

Wicketkeeper-batsman Patel joined opener Chopra at the crease when paceman F. D. Wet had sent Cheteshwar Pujara and captain Mohammed Kaif back to the pavilion in a space of three deliveries with the scorecard reading 13 for two. 

Patel and Chopra stitched together 159 for the third wicket, ensuring South Africa A did not get any benefit from the setbacks to the hosts. 

While Patel played a quick innings of 110 that came off 118 balls and contained 17 hits to the fences, Chopra batted slow and took 286 balls to remain unbeaten on 137. The Delhi batsman hit 15 boundaries and one shot over the ropes. 

Patels innings ended when he was run out by rival skipper Boeta Dippenear. Patels departure brought Bengal batsman Manoj Tiwary to the crease. 

Tiwary, who was returning to action after recovering from a shoulder injury, fell cheaply. He was caught by Hashim Amla off the bowling of R. Klieinveldt after contributing just two runs in 17 balls.

 Anand just a draw away from world title

Mexico City: Viswanathan Anand was sniffing the World Chess Championship title after drawing his 13th-round duel with Russian Alexander Grischuk here on Friday. 

Anand thus retained his one-point lead over Israels Boris Gelfand, who split the point with Russian Vladimir Kramnik in the penultimate round. 

The Indian Grandmaster took his tally to 8.5 points to move within a draw of regaining the world title. 

Anand will play with white in the final round against Peter Leko of Hungary, who was the only winner on Saturday. 

Gelfand can force a tie-breaker if two things happen simultaneously he beats Alexander Morozevich with black and Anand loses to Leko. Anand losing with white when he is in such fine form looks a remote possibility. 

The games in Round 13 were again fought very hard. 

Gelfand, playing with white, drew after a short battle. Levon Aronian failed to break the defence of the winless Peter Svidler. 

Behind Anand (8.5) and Gelfand (7.5) are Kramnik (7), Leko (6.5), Aronian (6) and the trio of Grischuk, Svidler and Morozevich (5.5 each). 

It turned out to be a tough day in office for Anand who had to survive a few anxious moments against Grischuk. For the first time in the tournament, the semi Slav led to a difficult position for Anand in the endgame and he was left fighting to salvage half a point. 

Grischuk was on top after winning a pawn with white pieces, but the Indian hung in with some awesome defence. 

Grischuks plans went awry after the first time control and Anand was back in the game by move 50. 

By the 58th move, there was no doubt about the outcome but Grischuk played on till 73 moves before signing peace. 

Gelfand could get little out of Kramniks Slav defence and went for a simple position that offered little chances for either player. 

For the record, the game lasted 26 moves. 

Leko gave a fine performance facing Morozevichs classical Sicilian. The Hungarian took the initiative in the middlegame and outplayed Morozevich in all departments. 

Aronian tried his best against Svidler but could not do and had to share the point after 46 moves. 

In Round 12, Anand had settled for an easy draw against Svidler. He went for the fashionable Marshall and Svidler had declined the gambit in the Ruy Lopez. 

There was not much left to do for both players once a few pieces and pawns changed hands in the middle game. The draw was agreed to in just 22 moves. 

It was Gelfand who kept up the pressure on Anand. On Thursday, he won with black against Aronian. 

Aronian struggled in the middle game after going for some wild complexities and had to pay a heavy price once Gelfand got his queen to do the damage on the king side.

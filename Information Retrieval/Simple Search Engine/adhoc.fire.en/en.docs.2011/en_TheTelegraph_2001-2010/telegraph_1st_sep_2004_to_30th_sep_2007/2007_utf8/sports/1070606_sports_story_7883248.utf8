 Kent okays Fords India trip 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Kent County Cricket Club on Tuesday announced that it has allowed Graham Ford prime contender for Team India coachs job the opportunity to speak to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). 

According to a press release from Kent received here, this is what both the clubs chief executive Paul Millman and Ford had to say: 

Paul Millman: Graham has a contract with Kent until the end of the 2008 season. He has been approached by the BCCI about the job with the Indias national side and we have allowed him the opportunity to travel to India to find out more about the role. 

Graham has done a fantastic job for us and needless to say, we very much hope he will stay with us. 

 Graham Ford: 

 I am really enjoying my time at Kent and particularly the 

 teams recent success. 

The BCCI has approached me in regard to the vacancy and I am grateful to the club (Kent) for allowing me the chance to talk to them.

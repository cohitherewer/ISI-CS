The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I love to be in a sari: Daniela

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Daniela Hantuchova, the second seed at the Sunfeast Open, landed in the city in the wee hours of Wednesday. In the evening, she decimated qualifier Marta Domachowska in a first-round match in the evening and decimated the Polish 6-2, 6-1. 

And then came the surprise she turned up for the post-match press conference dressed in a burnt-orange georgette sari, with a cream blouse, leaving everyone spellbound and tongue-tied. 

The reaction amused her. 

I love to be in a sari, Hantuchova said, adding that if it was possible, she would actually take to the courts in a sari. 

On her first visit to India, the world No. 11 said she is having a great time so far. 

The second seeds arrival in the city coincided with the departure of the top seed. Marion Bartoli lost to Vania King in the first round on Tuesday. 

A dejected Bartoli left the city Wednesday morning. Does that indicate that it would be a cakewalk for Hantuchova here? 

I work on my game all the time and try to improve, without expecting too much and without looking too far ahead, said the Slovak. Im also getting used to the courts. 

She is fond of grasscourts. What does she think of the courts at Indoor? Its a good surface. I enjoyed playing on it, she said. 

Asked about her loss to Lindsay Davenport, who was making a comeback almost after a year, at the Bali Classic on Sunday, the 24-year-old said: Lindsay played a well especially since shes had a baby just three months back. 

She needed medical timeout during the final because of blisters. She emphasised she needed to be careful so that it did not worsen. 

As for the match against Domachowska, Hantuchova said it certainly wasnt as easy as the scoreline suggested and that she had to come up with some real good shots. 

Her father is a scientist, mother a toxicologist and brother an architect. How come shes playing tennis? Maybe because Im stupid, laughed Hantuchova. 

I opted for tennis because I wanted to. Maybe I will continue with my studies after my playing career is over, she added on a serious note. 

At the moment, though, shes happy the way she is and wouldnt want to change it for anything.

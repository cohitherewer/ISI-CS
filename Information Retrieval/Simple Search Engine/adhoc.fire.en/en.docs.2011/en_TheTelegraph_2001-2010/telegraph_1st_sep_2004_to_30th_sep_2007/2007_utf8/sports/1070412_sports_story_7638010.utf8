 Flemings men keen to seal semis berth today

 - Ligament tear puts Lasith Malinga out

Grenada: After an unimpressive performance against minnows Ireland, New Zealand, who are just a game away from qualifying for the semi-finals, will look to put up their best performance against Sri Lanka here Thursday. 

New Zealand are unbeaten in the tournament and just need one more win to be certain of a berth in the semi-finals. 

But skipper Stephen Fleming said his team needed to work out long partnerships for success against Sri Lanka, who have been their nemesis in recent times. 

Flemings hopes received a further boost when it was learnt that Sri Lankas strike bowler Lasith Malinga will be unavailable because of an ankle injury. Malinga is suffering from a ligament tear and captain Mahela Jayawardene was not prepared to risk him. 

Vice-captain and left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori said: We can control our own destiny if we win tomorrow and thats what we hope to do. 

But Fleming and his team face their real test elsewhere. They have been unable to read Muttiah Muralidharan and thatprospect weighed heavily on their minds.

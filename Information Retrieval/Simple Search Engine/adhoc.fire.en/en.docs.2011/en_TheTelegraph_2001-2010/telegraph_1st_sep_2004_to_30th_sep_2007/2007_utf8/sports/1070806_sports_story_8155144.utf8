 Transfer rules 

London: The Premier League has tightened its transfer rules to prevent another Carlos Tevez-style contract dispute. 

Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said on Sunday that the organisation would have to be more circumspect when dealing with transfers in future. 

Weve changed the rules this summer so that the clubs are in no doubt that they must send any documentation surrounding any deal, whether they think its relevant or not, Scudamore said.

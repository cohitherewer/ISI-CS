The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Chisty is the man to watch 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Jockey Imran Chisty is back in the city and its good news for punters and, of course, for trainer Daniel David whose horses G. Ross performed pathetically last Wednesday. Chisty has rides in each of the seven-events in Tuesdays race card and it may pay to follow him.

 Chistys Active Asset, Universal Prince, Red Apache and Mr Darcy appear to be potential winners in their respective events. 

 Active Assets Leger run was good and Universal Prince has been knocking on the door. Red Apache, on the other hand, has matched strides with the best in the country while Mr Darcy has beaten Aristotle, early in the season, and on identical terms.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

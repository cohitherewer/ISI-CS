 Alvarita may relish Derby trip 

 SRIMAX

 Bangalore: Imtiaz Sait-trained Alvarita has a decisive edge over the S. Ganapathy-ward Bourbon King in the 2,000m Kingfisher Derby Bangalore, the blue riband event of the summer season here on Sunday. 

 The Jade Robbery-Shanley daughters last run, here in the Fillies Trial Stakes, was very eye-catching. She clocked an impressive timing of one minute 37.81 seconds over a mile trip. The style of her victory on that occasion also suggested that she could last the Derby quite comfortably. 

 Alvarita has been working very well since that run and she would be tough to down if she is able to produce the same turn of foot as she did in the Fillies Classic. C. Alford partners the D.Khaitan-owned filly.

 In the 12-horse field, six youngsters are running in owner MAM Ramaswamys silks. However, MAMs main hope in the Derby and the chief adversary to Alvarita will be Bourbon King. The Diffident-Queen Ann son won the Colts Trial Stakes in a facile manner when he beat Royal Ambassador in a timing of 1.38. 09 seconds. More importantly, he is unbeaten in his last five starts and boasts of having beaten Alvarita, early this year, albeit over a shorter trip. B. Prakash partners the Manjari Stud bred horse.

 Royal Ambassador is the dark one in the line-up. The Royal Gladiator-River Of Dreams progeny, who had produced a good finishing effort in the Colts Stakes, may go well over the Derby trip.

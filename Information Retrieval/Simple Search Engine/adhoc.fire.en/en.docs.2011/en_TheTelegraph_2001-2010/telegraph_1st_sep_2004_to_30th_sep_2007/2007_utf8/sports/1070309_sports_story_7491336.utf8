 Setback for East Bengal

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: It seems both East Bengal and Mohun Bagan are passing through a lean phase. East Bengal failed to qualify for the J.C. Mukherjee Trophy while their arch-rivals are fighting relegation in the CAB League. 

For East Bengal, its perhaps their worst show in a decade. After drawing their penultimate group B match against Town on Thursday, their hopes of playing in the J.C. Mukherjee Trophy were dashed as only the top three teams from each of the three groups qualify. They are also in danger of missing the P. Sen Invitation meet. 

As per CAB rules, if a team fails to finish among the top-3 in each group, they are not entitled to play the J.C. Mukherjee Trophy. For P. Sen Trophy, the working committee will take a final decision, tournament committee chairman Arun Mitra said. 

East Bengal cricket secretary Tapan Das blamed CAB for their bad show and said they will protest against poor umpiring. 

Meanwhile, in reply to East Bengals 347, Town were 263 for six at close with Amitava Roy posting an unbeaten 104. 

BRIEF SCORES 

East Bengal 374. Town Club 263/6 (Amitava Roy 104 .., Palash Bhowmick 73). Match drawn.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The game 

 isnt designed to make umpires happy

 - MCCs president-designate Mike Brearley on the laws 

 and more 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL

 London: 

 Come October 1 and Mike Brearley, arguably the best mind-reader 

 among captains, succeeds Doug Insole as the Marylebone Cricket 

 Club (MCC) president. The MCC remains the custodian of the 

 laws of the game and owns the most treasured ground Lords.

 Brearley, whod spoken exclusively 

 to The Telegraph during the Trent Bridge Test, found 

 time on Saturday evening as well. This time, the questions 

 were largely limited to the MCC.

 The following are 

 excerpts

 On whether hes excited 

 that hell be the next MCC president

 (Grins) Quite pleased

 On the first time he visited 

 Lords

 I think I was about eight when 

 my mother (Midge) took me for a Middlesex versus Hampshire 

 match Id go and see my father, Horace, play club 

 cricket all over but dont recall having made many 

 trips to Lords as a youngster.

 On whether he intends 

 bringing about changes in the MCC and at Lords

 Im going to be the president 

 for a year only I dont know Lets see.

 On MCC being the custodian 

 of the laws

 If it comes to changing anything, 

 Im sure nobody would do anything rash

 On the MCCs World 

 Cricket Committee initiative

 Im on it, as are current 

 and former cricketers like Rahul Dravid, Steve Waugh, Michael 

 Atherton, Martin Crowe, Michael Holding, Geoffrey Boycott 

 We deliberate on contentious issues and make our opinion 

 known to the International Cricket Council We dont, 

 of course, do so in an antagonistic way If you get politically 

 involved, then the decisions are politically and even financially 

 based, not so much from a cricketing point of view Weve 

 already debated the front-foot and back-foot no-balls Throwing 

 Time wasting (After a pause) The MCC, as youre 

 aware, is into research For example, the difference made 

 by balls of different colours

 On whether hes happy 

 with the existing laws

 Havent thought of something 

 which needs to be amended immediately.

 On the bowlers being peeved 

 with the soon-to-be-introduced free hit in ODIs (it already 

 exists in Twenty20) after a front-foot no-ball

 Its a gimmick. In fact, 

 its ridiculous.

 On whether he favours 

 the use of more technology in reaching decisions

 To make better decisions, why 

 not? Umpires could get upset, but the game isnt designed 

 to make them happy We must have the highest possible degree 

 of correct decisions Im not at all uncomfortable 

 at the thought that the human element could get minimised 

 Dont we all want decisions to be right?

 On Dickie Bird, for example, 

 being cut up with the push for more technology

 He has his opinions.

 On whether Test cricket 

 needs to be speeded up

 Most definitely. Today (Saturday), 

 there were many instances when the bowler was ready to bowl, 

 but the batsman wasnt ready The umpires have to be 

 strict and the tempo upped.

 On having been the first 

 to wear a helmet

 (Grins again) Dont 

 think so Ive read that Patsy Hendren wore something 

 like it against the West Indies in 1933 A discussion with 

 Tony Greig made me wear one for the first time, though it 

 was more a skull cap designed in Nottingham The manufacturer 

 would make them for children with epilepsy Greig and I 

 agreed that it didnt make much sense facing the West 

 Indies (in the latter part of the Seventies) without protection. 

 Even he was to have worn one at that time, but didnt.

 On the impact the helmet 

 and increased protective gear have made

 Made batsmen more aggressive 

 Made tailenders bat better and made the bowlers bowl better 

 at tailenders The helmet, in particular, has definitely 

 prevented a few deaths.

 On whether the boundaries 

 should be standardised across the world

 No Variety is the spice of life 

 Why must the MCG be made smaller because the other grounds 

 arent big? The charm of the MCG lies in its size

 Finally, on whether he 

 has begun preparing a speech for October 1

 (Laughs) Look, it wont 

 be a grand occasion Ill just start as president of 

 the MCC, thats it.

London: Andriy Shevchenko and Frank Lampard each scored twice and Chelsea routed Wycombe 4-0 for a place in the final of the English League Cup on Tuesday. 

Shevchenko who hadnt scored in his 10 previous appearances for Chelsea, broke a seven-week drought. He had reportedly fallen out with manager Jose Mourinho, partly because of his friendship with owner Roman Abramovich. 

Mourinho was also said to be on poor terms with Abramovich. 

The Ukraine striker scored in the 22nd and 43rd minutes in the second leg of the semi-final at Stamford Bridge, following a 1-1 draw at League Two club Wycombe. He also set up Lampard in the 69th, and the England midfielder scored his second goal in the 90th. 

When he was replaced near fulltime, Shevchenko shook hands with Mourinho, who was impressed by the players performance. 

I demand commitment, effort, being aggressive, working and playing for the team, working with the ball, working without the ball thats what I demand, Mourinho said. 

He did that, scored two goals, created some more. He was alive all the time while on the pitch. I think its a step forward in the direction of how we want him to play and perform on the pitch. 

Chelsea will face the winner of the Tottenham-Arsenal semi-final. 

The final is on February 25 at Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales. 

Shevchenkos first goal came when he intercepted a pass from Wycombes Tommy Doherty and ran through to score past goalkeeper Ricardo Batista. He then volleyed in a goal from a cross from Didier Drogba for his eighth of the season. 

Lampard took a Shevchenko cross to score his first, then netted in injury time after taking a pass from Drogba. 

Shevchenko was taken off in the 85th minute for Salomon Kalou. 

Im very happy to reach the final, Shevchenko said. Its important the team plays very, very well. The support of this team and fans has been unbelievable. 

Chelsea were again without captain John Terry, but the central defender has returned to full training after recovering from leg and back injuries. 

In the Premier League, substitute Jay DeMerit scored the winner for bottom club Watford in a 2-1 victory over Blackburn. 

Watford took a 1-0 lead in the 12th minute when Brett Emerton headed past his own goalkeeper, Brad Friedel, when trying to clear a cross. Benni McCarthy levelled the scores in the 45th before DeMerit headed in his second goal of the season. 

Watford has 15 points from 23 games and is seven points from safety. 

Blackburn midfielder Robbie Savage, meanwhile, broke his leg during the match. He was hurt early in the second half in a challenge with Watford midfielder Al Bangura and was taken to hospital. 

Blackburn are likely to be without him for the rest of the season. 

Luton advanced to the fourth round of the FA Cup with a 1-0 win over Queens Park Rangers in a third-round replay. 

Lutons win came when Zeshan Rehman scored an own-goal in the 80th minute. QPR midfielder Stefan Bailey was sent off in the 74th for a tackle on Luton midfielder Ahmet Brkovic, who had to be carried off on a stretcher.

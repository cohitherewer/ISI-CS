The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We had a great chance: Vaughan

St Johns: England captain Michael Vaughan said his side had wasted a good opportunity to put Australia under immense pressure during their World Cup Super Eight game on Sunday. 

England were 164 for two before crumbling to 247 all out. Ricky Pontings 86 tphen helped the world champions reach the target with 16 balls to spare. Vaughans men must now win their three remaining games against Bangladesh, South Africa and hosts West Indies to have a good chance of progressing to the last four. 

Its very frustrating. Ill go back to the hotel knowing that we were in a great position to put Australia under a huge amount of pressure if we had got 280-290, Vaughan told a news conference. 

On that kind of wicket, I really believe that would have been a real competitive total. When you get 247, you know youve still got a chance but you need a little bit of the rub of the green, you need to get their key players out early. 

When Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke get in, it is very difficult to restrict them on that kind of pitch. 

Kevin Pietersen hit Englands first century of the competition, something Vaughan had been calling for, but the top-ranked ODI batsman seemed to slow his pace to make sure of the hundred rather than hit out late to boost the total. 

I think the wickets were falling, he wanted to try and be there at the end, he wanted to get the hundred. His innings was fantastic and a pleasure to watch, Vaughan said. 

Pietersen was also involved in a controversial incident in the field, when he caught Andrew Symonds on the boundary before taking a number of steps to avoid falling over the ropes and then throwing the ball away. Vaughan appealed to the umpires that Pietersen had been in control of the ball, but Symonds was given not out. 

It was a difficult one. Being honest he had no control of his legs so it was a never an option. We were clutching a bit then to be honest, Vaughan said. 

Ive got no runs again. Freddy (Flintoff) will be the first to admit that he is probably struggling a bit, as I am, he added. (Reuters)

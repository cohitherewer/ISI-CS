The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Indian men out 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Jhulan Goswami is the lone Indian in contention for the annual International Cricket Council (ICC) awards, with none from the Men in Blue making it to the shortlist of their respective categories. 

Jhulan, nominated for the Womens Cricketer of the Year category, will vie with Lisa Sthalekar of Australia and Claire Taylor of England for the top honour. Jhulans teammate and fellow quick, Rumeli Dhar failed to make the next cut after being picked in the initial list. 

The original roster for the ICC awards included Zaheer Khan and Anil Kumble in the Test Player of the Year category while Yuvraj Singh made it to the ODI list. But when the 56-member ICC Academy pruned the list, Team India trio fell by the wayside. 

The awards will be presented at a function in Johannesburg on Monday, a day before the start of the inaugural ICC World Twenty20. 

Australia captain Ricky Ponting heads the short-list for the annual awards after being nominated in four categories.

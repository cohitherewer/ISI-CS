The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 An acid test for Subrata

 - Barretos experience may come in handy 

 Subratas main job will be 

to contain Barreto

Fridays blockbuster is being seen by many as a battle between two Brazilians. Barreto and Edmilson have both been prolific scorers in the league so far and the two coaches will be looking to them to score the winner. 

Both goal-getters are capable of turning the tables on any opponent, but one has to take into account the rain factor. We are in the middle of the monsoon season when the skies can open up any moment. Twenty minutes of heavy shower just before kick-off or during the match can turn the Salt Lake Stadium turf into a mess. The ball will not roll normally, underfoot conditions will be pathetic and it will require special skills to overcome those odds. 

Barreto has the advantage of having played in such conditions many times. Edmilson, a traditional striker and a dangerous finisher, is relatively new to Calcutta and will relish a drier surface. Even a light shower before or during the course of the game will suit him as the ball will travel quicker after the first drop. 

The rain factor will, indeed, be a key element in this match. Both teams have a new African in the heart of defence. Neither has settled down fully and may find the slippery conditions hard to master, if it rains. Its important for the coaches to be flexible in strategy-formulation, they have to adapt to conditions prevailing during the time of the game. 

It will be an acid test for Subrata. This is the first time ever that he will be opposing Mohun Bagan. Just as hell get encouragement from East Bengal fans, Subrata should be ready for a mouthful from the green-and-maroon stands. I think he is mature enough to handle the situation. 

Subratas most important job will be to find a way to stop Barreto from playing his natural game. The Brazilian will need special attention and I wont be surprised if Madhab Das is used as a policeman to mark him. Mohun Bagan have a set of useful midfielders. Dharamjit, James, Lalkamal and the experienced Venkatesh can penetrate the East Bengal citadel if Barreto is somehow bottled up. East Bengal will be depending on the potentially dangerous duo of Edmilson and Alvito. The success of both, however, is conditional. Edmilsons case has already been discussed. Alvito can be checked by double covering and tough tackling. He is not a one-touch player and needs to hold on to the ball to be an effective game-maker. 

Both defence lines have had their moments of crisis, more so East Bengal. An odd mistake by a Madhab or a Gurpreet could make the difference as Barreto will pounce on it. 

Mohun Bagan have made a lot of noises on the standard of local refereeing. From what they said, getting outstation referees to officiate the match will make it an error-free game. Thats far from the truth. All referees are human beings and even the best like a Collina or a Poll have made mistakes on the big stage. 

The only advantage of having outstation officials is that the Doubting Thomases will believe that the referee wont be biased against their team. Even if he makes a mistake, it will be accepted as a mistake.

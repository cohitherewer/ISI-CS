Puerto La Cruz: Argentina, helped by a brace from Juan Roman Riquelme, beat Colombia 4-2 to reach the Copa America quarter finals on Monday. Paraguay joined them with a 3-1 win over United States. 

Both teams have six points from two games in group C and impressive tallies of eight goals apiece. 

The US and Colombia are both without points and depend on a complex combination of results to have any chance of qualifying. 

The tournament produced yet another refereeing row as Colombia, who scored first, were furious with the penalty from which Argentina equalised. 

The ticketing chaos continued as thousands of fans queued in vain in Merida, where hosts Venezuela are in action. Some said they had paid in advance for their tickets but had not received them. 

Argentinas match ended amid chants of the governments going to fall and freedom echoing around the 42,000-seat stadium. 

On the field, Colombia beaten 0-5 by Paraguay in their opener took a shock 10th-minute lead via a crafty Edixon Perea backheel. 

Argentina levelled 10 minutes later when Lionel Messi went down in what appeared to be a simple 50-50 challenge, but the referee gave a penalty and Hernan Crespo converted. 

Crespo, who took his tally to three goals in two games, pulled up as he kicked the ball and was substituted by Diego Milito. Afterwards, the 31-year-old said he was unlikely to play in the tournament again. 

Riquelme then sprang into action, scoring from a nonchalant header and a trademark free-kick 11 minutes before half-time. 

Although Jaime Castrillon pulled one back for Colombia, Milito ended their fightback with a fourth Argentine goal in stoppage time. 

I think we clearly dominated the win and deserved our win, said Riquelme. 

Colombia midfielder Fabian Vargas, sent off in injury-time, said: There was no reason for the referee to give a penalty and it made Argentinas life easier. 

Earlier, Edgar Barreto gave Paraguay a 30th-minute lead in Barinas before Ricardo Clark scored from the edge of the area to make it 1-1 at half-time.

 Our best game of the Cup: Ponting

Gros Islet: Australia captain Ricky Ponting promised a World Cup final performance against Sri Lanka to match the occasion after reducing South Africa to the ranks of also-rans on Wednesday. 

The Australian bowlers dismissed their semi-final opponents for a paltry 149 then Michael Clarke, identified by Ponting as one of the players who had made the most progress during the tournament, anchored a seven-wicket win with an unbeaten 60. 

Australia will be aiming for a unique hattrick of World Cup victories when they meet the 1996 champions in Barbados on Saturday. 

Today was the best in our World Cup tournament so far, Ponting told a news conference. To bowl them out for that total on that wicket was definitely our best performance. 

I think we have maintained really high skill levels throughout the tournament. When the big teams come out we stand up and Im sure we will do that on Saturday. 

Ponting, whose team is unbeaten in the World Cup since losing to Pakistan in the 1999 edition, returned to one of his pre-match themes when he said the Australian players were still challenging themselves to perform better. 

We will be talking about winning the final, we will be talking about executing good skills and the results will take care of themselves, he said. 

South Africa, who briefly supplanted Australia as the worlds top team this year, were left playing for pride once they crashed to 27 for five after winning the toss and opting to bat. They were confronted by good pace bowling, notably from Shaun Tait (four for 39) and Glenn McGrath (three for 18). 

But their top batsmen, in particular captain Graeme Smith and senior batsman Jacques Kallis, also played indifferent strokes, raising questions again about their mental approach when they play Australia. 

Not for the first time Smith rejected suggestions that South Africa had choked on a big occasion. 

To me choking is when you get close to winning, he said. We just didnt play well, there were one or two loose shots. 

Tait as first change as a strike bowler does make life a little difficult. 

Ponting said reducing South Africa to 27 for five in the 10th over had been a tremendous start. 

We had them under pressure from the first over of the game, he said. They came out really aggressive and really positive. 

Sometimes that comes off in one-day cricket, sometimes it doesnt. I must admit we wanted them to come out hard. 

The Australia captain said there was still more to come from his team, who have not once been seriously confronted for 100 overs during the past seven weeks. 

We are doing a lot of things really well at the moment, he said. Whether what we are doing is better than last World Cup, Im not sure. 

Theres no doubt that out skills in the tournament have been exceptional. 

Ponting was proud of the efort put in by his bowlers. 

Our bowling has been terrific throughout the tournament. Having them reduced for 27 for five says about the quality of our bowlers, he said. 

Shaun Tait, Bradd Hogg, and Glenn McGrath all have been terrific. And Nathan Bracken has always got us wickets up front. 

McGrath, Man of the Match with three for 18, shared his captains opinion. 

We have bowled out every team in the tournament, except Bangladesh whom we played in a 22-over match, he said. 

The Pigeon enjoyed bowling against the wind in the morning. 

Younger fellows want to bowl into the breeze, I didnt mind it at all. I got a couple of edges, he said. 

Australia are fully aware that Sri Lanka will be a very different side. 

The final pits two clever Australian coaches against each in Moody and Buchanan and a well balanced Sri Lanka side that is just as strong as when it beat Australia in the 1996 World Cup final in Lahore. 

Ponting said the Australian team will concentrate on doing what it does best as it prepares for the final at the Kensington Oval on what promises to be a fast, seaming wicket. 

We will be talking about winning the final, we will be talking about executing good skills and the results will take care of themselves, he said. (Agencies)

 Trent counts the positives 

Georgetown: Ireland will go into Fridays World Cup Super Eight match against defending champions Australia full of optimism despite losing their last four games, skipper Trent Johnston said. 

Ireland remain rooted at the bottom of the standings after their 129-run defeat by New Zealand on Monday. 

However, having made New Zealand struggle at 83 for three and then again at 189 for seven, Ireland feel they have the ability to rattle the big guns in the tournament, even though the Black Caps recovered to take 59 runs from the last five overs to reach 263 for eight. 

It was disappointing, but a lot of positives came out of the game, Johnston said. Youve got to take all the positives and take them forward. If you cant be up for a game against Australia, you shouldnt be playing cricket. Thats all the motivation the other 14 members of the squad need. 

Ireland coach Adrian Birrell is hoping Bangladeshs shock 67-run win over South Africa will inspire his team. 

Johnston feels Irelands high standard of fielding will also help them against Ricky Pontings men. If we can execute the other two disciplines to the standards that we want, we can probably get a bit closer to these teams, Johnston said. 

In bowling, weve had great start-ups but we have got to close out the innings. These are things we are learning but its professionals against amateurs. We will just go out there and do our vest best.

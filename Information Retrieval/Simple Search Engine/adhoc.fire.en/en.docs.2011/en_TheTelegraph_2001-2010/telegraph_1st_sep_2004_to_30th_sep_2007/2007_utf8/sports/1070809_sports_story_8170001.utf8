 Hari held by Berkes

Paks (Hungary): Formerworld junior champion P. Harikrishna could not get the better of Ferenc Berkes defence and split point with the Hungarian in the third round of the 5th Marx Gyorgy Memorial International Chess tournament here. 

Slowly inching up after a disastrous first round loss, Harikrishna is now on one point and is in joint fifth spot along with Hou Yifan. 

In the Paks Cup GM tournament, organised simultaneously, national champion Tania Sachdev finally opened her account with a draw with Mihai Grunberg of Hungary. 

After two straight losses, Tania set herself on the recovery path with black pieces in the Queens Indian defence and played out a solid game to hold her opponent. (PTI)

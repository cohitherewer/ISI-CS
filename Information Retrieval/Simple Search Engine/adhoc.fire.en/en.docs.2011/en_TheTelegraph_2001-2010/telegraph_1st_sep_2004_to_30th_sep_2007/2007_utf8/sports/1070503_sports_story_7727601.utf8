 Fifa exploring new systems

Geneva: World footballs governing body is exploring controversial changes to the game including a new refereeing system and possible changes to points scoring, Fifa president Sepp Blatter said on Wednesday. A controversial refereeing system involving four linesmen will be tested during either European or World Youth tournaments this summer, Fifa confirmed. 

Its a first agreement with Michel Platini, who has just been elected president of Uefa. We said that we need to help the referee, he must be given more assistants, Blatter said. 

Blatter had indicated in an interview that the two extra linesmen would have whistles and the power to intervene directly from the touchline, although the exact configuration would depend on trials. 

Under Fifas thinking, the two additional linesman would act as back-ups for the referee, expanding his line of vision especially in the penalty area or during free-kicks, while existing linesmen would continue to guard the touchline and flag offside. 

Nonetheless, Blatter indicated here that the games top rule-making body, the international board, was not too happy with the idea of four linesmen. (AFP)

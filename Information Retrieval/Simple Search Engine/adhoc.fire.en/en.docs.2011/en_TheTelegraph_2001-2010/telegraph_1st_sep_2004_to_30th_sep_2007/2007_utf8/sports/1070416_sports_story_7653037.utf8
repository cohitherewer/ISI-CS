 Weather to blame, says Kallis

St Georges: South Africas vice-captain Jacques Kallis blamed the unpredictable Caribbean weather for his teams defeat by New Zealand in a World Cup Super Eight match on Saturday. 

New Zealand restricted South Africa to 193 for seven and replied with 196 with five wickets and 10 balls to spare. 

Kallis felt the result was almost a forgone conclusion when New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming won the toss and opted to field after early showers and overcast skies made the batting conditions challenging in the morning. 

Its frustrating when the conditions play such a big role in the game. The toss was vital, Kallis said. 

 In the first 20 overs, it was a green Test wicket and the guys did well to stick in there as well as we did and get a total we could bowl at. 

The cloud cover dissipated and circumstances were better for batting during New Zealands innings. 

However, South Africa did not help their cause by dropping four catches. Who knows, if we had hung on to one or two chances maybe we could have been in a different position, Kallis said. Credit needs to be given to the bowlers for putting in a performance like that on what was a different wicket in the afternoon. 

Kallis brushed off suggestions that the team was inconsistent even though South Africa had scored their highest World Cup tally 356 for four against West Indies at the same venue just four days ago. 

Not at all, I think its inconsistency in the wicket, he said in reply to a question.Theres no way we would have got 350 on that wicket this morning. 

If we had managed to sneak in another 10 or 15 runs it might have made it more difficult for New Zealand and anyway it did go down to the last few overs. 

Saturdays result means South Africa must beat England in their final Super Eight match in Barbados on Tuesday to reach the semis.

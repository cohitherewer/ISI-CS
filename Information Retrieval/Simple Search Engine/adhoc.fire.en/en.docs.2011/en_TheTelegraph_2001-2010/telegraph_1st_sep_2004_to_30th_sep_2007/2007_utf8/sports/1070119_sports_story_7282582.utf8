Calcutta: Every winning team is goal-oriented. The players go about their business with blinkers on, with focus firmly on specific objectives. In this sense, East Bengal were deserving 2-1 winners over Mohammedan Sporting in their third-round ONGC National Football League match at the Barasat Stadium on Thursday. 

This was a match, which fluctuated from one end to the other, rising to its billing of being the derby clash. 

Man-of-the-Match S. Malsawmtluanga scorched Mohammedan Sportings left-side with his searing run and, at the same time, was responsible for missing out on several sitters; Bibiano Fernandes held up the midfield with confidence for East Bengal; Noel Wilson led Mohammedan Sportings resurgence (in the second-half) with untiring energy and Habibur Rahman Mondal scored a goal and gave a boost to his teams fightback. 

The good thing about this win was that both forwards Ashim Biswas and Boniface Ambani were on target, providing a sense of relief to the beleaguered coach Carlos Roberto Pereira, who has long been ruing lack of goals from his strikers. It could easily have been 4-1 or 5-1 if chances were not dissipated rather casually. 

Mohammedan Sporting, on the other hand, looked for a draw perhaps in a bid to have the dust settle over their 0-5 humiliation in the previous match (against Dempo) and it was clear right from the beginning. Madhab Das man-marking the Kenyan Ambani, Jamir Ali Mondal stationing himself close to Alvito DCunha and Surojit Roy keeping a close vigil on Shylo Malsawmtluanga. 

Bhowmicks plans seemed to be heading towards a desired end till Ashim put East Bengal ahead in the 33rd minute in a controversial manner. 

The diminutive striker brilliantly met with Debabrata Roys deft cross towards the far post but when Mohammedan Sporting custodian Gopal Das parried the danger, he seemed to have crossed the line. 

Referee K. Shankar followed his assistant A. Arjunans signal for the goal. The black-and-white players protested in vain with AS Firoz ending up being booked. 

If it promised to be the beginning of an East Bengal more on the offensive, Bhowmick clearly had other plans for his team. He took the rein off his wing-backs, with Habibur and Surojit loping down the flanks to give an impetus towards his teams search for the equaliser. 

Seven minutes into the second session, Habibur eventually brought a smile to his coachs face when East Bengal defence allowed him a free-header inside the box, following a cross from the left. 

If Habibur, who played in the hole between defence and midfield, was spot-on with his run and sense of positioning, which led to the goal, he was equally responsible for making his team trail again. 

Malsawmtluanga led a two-to-one break in the 59th minute. He squared the ball for Ambani, who turned, took his time and then unleashed a powerful right-footer beating Gopal all ends up. Habibur acted no better than a mere onlooker.

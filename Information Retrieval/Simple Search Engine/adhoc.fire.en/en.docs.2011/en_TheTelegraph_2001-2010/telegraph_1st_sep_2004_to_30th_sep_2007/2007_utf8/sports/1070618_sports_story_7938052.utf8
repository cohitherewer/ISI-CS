 Kevin Pietersen promises Ashes revenge

 Pietersen 

Durham: Kevin Pietersen has said he wants to be a member of an England side that demolishes Australia in two years time after the teams 5-0 Ashes humbling during the northern winter. 

South Africa-born batsman Pietersen, 26, could not prevent Ricky Pontings men regaining the Ashes in emphatic style at the first opportunity after Englands 2-1 home success in 2005. 

But Pietersen has promised the memory of their recent thrashing will inspire the team to success when the Ashes are next up for grabs, in England, in 2009. 

People are still hurting from the winter. But I dont think it did England too much harm, this winter, Pietersen said on Sunday. 

Yes, we got hammered in Australia and the World Cup (where England failed to reach the semi-finals) wasnt good for us, but we are hurting. 

Inside, we are hurting and it is the same sort of pain we want to inflict on a lot of countries that tour England, and it is the same pain we want to inflict on the Australians in 2009, so it was not all that bad. 

The way we are playing our cricket now is the way we want to play and the way we want to demolish the Australians in 2009. 

Hampshire batsman Pietersen added, I just basically think its that killer instinct, that ruthlessness that the Australian team showed us in Australia this winter. 

They were at our throats thats what we want to do. We want to be mentally right, we want to be physically right and we just want to keep asking questions ball after ball, session after session, explained Pietersen, who said new England coach Peter Moores wanted the side to have a hard edge. 

A team has to back down at some stage and that is something Peter is very, very positive about and keen on doing. 

As soon as you turn up at the ground, you are in the right frame of mind, you have got positive energy, positive vibes chucking around the dressing room, Pietersen explained. 

Positive energy breeds positive performances, said the attacking batsman, captained at Hampshire by former Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne. 

England have won their first Test series since the Ashes, going 2-0 at home to the West Indies in a four match contest ahead of the final, ongoing Test here at Riverside. Pietersens form has been a key factor in Englands success against a struggling West Indies side. He scored a hundred in the first Test at Lords and followed that up with a Test-best 226 in Englands innings win in the second match of the campaign at Headingley. 

This series he has so far scored 438 runs at an average of nearly 88 but Pietersen said he hoped for better things to come in international cricket. 

I think this is my 27th Test match. I have played 50-odd ODIs I am still pretty young in my career. I have probably got another seven or eight, hopefully another ten, years of playing or England, playing at the highest level.

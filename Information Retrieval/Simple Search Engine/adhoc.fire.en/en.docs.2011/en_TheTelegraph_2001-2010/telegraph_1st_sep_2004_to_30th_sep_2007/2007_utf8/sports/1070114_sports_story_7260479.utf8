 Serena out to defend US reputation

Melbourne: The Australian Open will be the first Grand Slam event without a seeded American woman. Serena Williams is vowing to do what she can to end that streak at one tournament. 

I take the blame for that, Williams said Saturday as she worked on her final preparations for the years first major. Ill try to make sure it doesnt happen anymore. 

Not all the blame can be put on Williams shoulders for the American demise. The seven-time Grand Slam singles champion is coming off her third straight injury-plagued year, one in which she played in only four tournaments and saw her ranking slide to No. 140, the first time she was out of the top 100 since she made her pro debut nine years earlier. 

Sister Venus is battling a nagging wrist injury. Lindsay Davenport is out to have a baby. And no other American woman has yet to distance themselves from the current crop of youthful wannabes. 

Serena is back up to 95th and is coming off a promising effort at a warm-up tournament in Hobart that left her feeling upbeat. 

I just expect to go out there and most of all have fun, said Williams, who has won two Australian titles but is unseeded this year. 

Other players arent sure what to expect from Williams, who sets the pace with her power and rises or falls on how well she does it. 

Shell just have to play her game, said sixth-seeded Martina Hingis, who knows a little about comebacks after returning from retirement a year ago. She never depended really on anybody else. With the sisters, its always been either they are on or theyre not. Its always if they really want it and theyre hungry. 

Serena, who has been criticised in the past for not seeming to work hard enough on her preparation and fitness, showed up early in Australia this time. She played in Hobart, where she got in eight sets over three matches, and said is happy with her warm-up. The main thing is working on her mechanics. 

I think if I do that well, then Ill be fine, Williams said. But she faces a daunting road here, with the same challenges as any unseeded player. 

She faces 27th-seeded Mara Santangelo of Italy in the first round and could have to beat four of the top five seeds to win the tournament. 

Still, shes far from the only intriguing story here. 

Fourth-seeded Kim Clijsters, who won the warm-up tournament in Sydney on Friday, is planning to retire at the end of the year to start a family even though shes at the top of her game. Fellow Belgian Justine Henin-Hardenne, a finalist at all four Grand Slams last year, pulled out, citing family reasons and will lose her No. 1 ranking. 

Hingis, who once dominated the sport, is out to reclaim the top spot. Amelie Mauresmo, who once seemed destined to never win a major, is playing with confidence after winning here and at Wimbledon last year. And Maria Sharapova is aiming to prove she deserves the top seeding. 

Ive been in two semis here, said Sharapova, who won the last major, the US Open. Im just ready to take it to the next level, hopefully get to the final or win it. 

Sharapova, who lost the final in Hong Kong to Clijsters a week ago, looked relaxed and confident. I might not have that many matches under my belt, but I feel fresh, I feel healthy, which is most important, she said. 

The 19-year-old Sharapova said she could see herself putting away her rackets at 24, like Clijsters, but is focused on winning matches now. 

Im definitely enjoying what Im doing right now, Sharapova said. I love the feeling of going on the court and trying to get myself better. I still have that motivation to work hard.

 Shoaib, Asif fit, says Inzy

Karachi: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq has surprisingly claimed that the pace duo of Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif are fit to play in the World Cup, strengthening reports about the two being in London for clearing the traces of nandrolone before their dope tests. 

Inzamam disclosed that Shoaib, recovering from a knee problem, and Asif, nursing a niggle in his elbow, had not been stopped from playing by doctors. 

As the Pakistan team is leaving for the West Indies via London, Shoaib and Asif can join us from there, he was quoted as saying Wednesday. 

The Pakistan captain also said his team looked balanced and had chances to win the World Cup with the pace duo in the squad. (PTI)

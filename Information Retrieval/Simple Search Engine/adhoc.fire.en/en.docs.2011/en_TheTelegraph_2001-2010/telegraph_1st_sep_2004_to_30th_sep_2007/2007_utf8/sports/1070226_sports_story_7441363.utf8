The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 What we need is dua: Dhoni

Ranchi: Mahendra Singh Dhoni said on Sunday that the Indian team was fully geared for the World Cup and all that it needed now to succeed in the Caribbean was the fans prayers. 

We have put in a lot of practice. The World Cup is a big stage where every player, new or experienced, will like to give his best. What is needed now is dua (prayers), Dhoni told newsmen. 

I will play my best and hope to live up to the peoples expectations, Dhoni added. 

The Indian team leaves for the West Indies in the early hours of Thursday.

 Surya crushes Volokitin

 Surya Sekhar 

Moscow: Surya Sekhar Ganguly came up with an inspiring performance to defeat Ukrainian Andrei Volokitin in the opening round of A1 Group of Aeroflot International Chess Tournament here Thursday. 

The day also saw WGM Dronavalli Harika beat GM Tigran Petrosian of Armenia. IM S Vijayalakshmi also displayed top form to outwit GM Denis Khismatullin of Russia. 

Among other Indians, second seed Krishnan Sasikiran, P Harikrishna and Parimarjan Negi, played out draws in the $ 100,000 prize money meet. 

The general strength of the A1 Group could easily be gauged on the opening day itself as only 29 out of 44 games ended decisively, bringing up 29 players to share the lead together. 

And among these, Surya Sekhars victory was quite satisfying for the Indian as he gave Volokitin a taste of his own medicine. The Ukrainian is known worldwide for his deep opening preparation but for once he was caught off balance despite producing a reasonably new idea over the board. 

Much to Volokitins dismay, Surya Sekhar had prepared for everything just too deep with his black pieces and the timing of the new move was only start of his analysis. 

Even as complications remained, Surya Sekhar just did not budge and entered an endgame where his rook proved simply too powerful against two minor pieces. The rest was childs play. 

If luck had anything to do in the A1 section, it did in Harikas game against Petrosian. After an intense middle game that she fought well as black, Harika was defending an apparently drawn pawn-less rook and pawns endgame when Petrosian fell for a swindle that would have otherwise be seen by a lesser player. 

Harika took a moment to let the blunder sink in, and then played the effective manoeuvre that promoted her pawn to a queen after an elementary rook sacrifice.

Calcutta: It was just as well that Ashim Biswas was at the right place at the right time to nod home a Dipankar Roy free-kick seven minutes into the match against George Telegraph on a sultry Wednesday afternoon. The rest of the Sahara CFL Premier Division game threw up a missing-the-goal contest, which was won hands down by Edmilson Marques. 

Yes, East Bengal could have wiped away the derby disappointment with a seven or eight-goal thumping of the team which had taken a point each off Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting. Unfortunately, the Brazilian striker had left his scoring boot behind. 

To cap off a forgettable day, Edmilson was cautioned by Rathin Mukherjee two minutes from full time for play acting ruling him out of Saturdays match against Chirag United SC. He had earlier expressed his frustration for not winning a penalty after being pushed off possession inside the box. 

Alvito DCunha was missing in action due to a double booking, but Jayanta Sen and Dipankar made sure his absence was not felt. 

Jayanta, short in height but rarely found wanting in effort, operated from a little deeper than usual. He covered a substantial area and came up with some penetrating passes. One of those saw Dipankar forward charge to Edmilson, who rushed in for the kill only to see goalkeeper Arnab Das Sharma slapping the ball out. 

That was more the custodians credit than Edmilsons failure. The strikers horror story actually began in the 25th minute. As Ashto Karar failed to clear a Dipankar cross, the ball fell to an unmarked Edmilson who made a hash of the shot. 

After the change of ends, Abdul Samed who made amends for his nightmarish performance against Mohun Bagan and Marlangki Suting set up Edmilson for the kill again. This time, the Brazilian who could have notched up his second hattrick of the league on Wednesday sent the shot wide with his outstep. Then a good-looking side-volley went wide. 

A little later, the Brazilian directed his left-footed half volley into the advancing goalie Arnab Das Sharmas body. 

Then came the penalty controversy. Edmilson, headed goalward, was pushed to the ground with a shoulder charge by Karar. It was a case for penalty, but the referee thought otherwise. 

Ashim joined in the comedy of errors, failing to connect an Anupam Sarkar centre 10 yards away from goal. 

George Telegraph were a strangely subdued bunch. By and large asleep in the first session, Raghu Nandys boys showed a semblance of urgency during a 15-minute period in the final session when they came close to scoring thrice. Nurudeen Salau Olawale who didnt feature in the starting XI because of an ankle injury flicked the ball goalwards at the end of a solo run, but Samed was there to kick the ball to safety. 

Substitute Subha Kumar then got into the act. He first ballooned the ball over from close following a moment of panic in the East Bengal defence. A fine pass followed, which Olawale chased down well but placed the ball two feet wide.

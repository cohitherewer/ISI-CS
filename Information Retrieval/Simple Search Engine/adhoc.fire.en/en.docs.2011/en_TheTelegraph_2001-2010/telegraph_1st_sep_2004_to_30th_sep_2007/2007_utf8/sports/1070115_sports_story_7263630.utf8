 Difficult to look beyond Federer

Melbourne: Roger, Rafa, the rest. Roger Federer is on the cusp of a record for most consecutive weeks atop the tennis rankings, regardless of what he does at the Australian Open. 

Rafael Nadal owns the record for most weeks at No. 2. With seven of the last eight Grand Slam titles between them, its hardly surprising theyre heavily favoured to meet in the Australian Open final on January 28. 

If I didnt play so well, he would have been No. 1 a long time ago, Federer said in a small tribute to Nadal on the eve of the years first Grand Slam. Hes my No. 1 competitor. The numbers dont lie. 

Nadal missed the last Australian Open because of injuries and had a scare last week in Sydney, withdrawing from a tune-up tournament with a groin strain. 

Retiring in Sydney was just a precaution, he said. I feel 100 percent now thats the most important thing. 

Nadal is not taking anything for granted in his opening match. He faces American Robert Kendrick, who took the first two sets off him at Wimbledon last year. 

Federer made the final at all four majors last season, winning three of them. Nadals title defense at the French Open broke Federers bid for a season Grand Slam, something no player has achieved since Rod Laver in 1969. 

After a year in which the Swiss master hoisted 12 trophies, including three Grand Slam, won 92 matches and lost only five, fans and pundits alike are expecting 2007 to be a mirror image of 2006 another season of total domination by the Swiss. 

Federer, however, was having none it. 

Its going to be hard to repeat last season, Federer told reporters on Sunday. 

But seconds later, he was back on Federer mode: I had a great last few years. Just hope to keep it up, stay healthy. Thats really what my secret has been, you know, staying healthy, not being injured too much, having a good schedule. 

Obviously, Ive carried the confidence for quite some time now. 

Federer opens versus Bjorn Phau, who along with Nadal is the only player in the draw with a winning record against Federer, in the first round. Phau won their only encounter 6-2, 6-3 at Washington in 1999, the year after Federer turned pro. 

Every time I had a setback, I bounced back very strong, warned Federer. 

You cant expect yourself to be already peaking like crazy in an exhibition tournament. 

Now the first slam is around the corner. Hope I can do well here. 

Its (the Australian Open) kind of like the Happy Slam. You get here and are happy to play again, Federer said. 

No. 5 James Blake has a tough opener against former No. 1 Carlos Moya, two days after beating the veteran Spaniard in the final at the Sydney International. 

Sixth-seeded Andy Roddick will open against French wildcard entry Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Roddick also has Marat Safin, the 2005 Australian Open champion, in his quarter of the draw. 

Meanwhile, among women, Kim Clijsters has emerged as the form player going into the first Grand Slam of the season, with Maria Sharapova and Amelie Mauresmo snapping at her heels. The Belgian, who retires at the end of the year, has won the Champions Challenge in Hong Kong and the Sydney International in the lead-up to the Australian Open, signalling her intentions to go out with a bang. 

Im very happy with the way that I played, she said. Im very focused on trying to win. Defending champion Mauresmo shed her tag as the best player not to claim a major by winning here last year when Henin-Hardenne walked off centre court with a stomach complaint midway through the final. 

The Frenchwoman went on to win Wimbledon and now she has savoured Grand Slam success, she wants more. Sharapova, the US Open champion, gets Monday off before playing Camille Pin in her first-round match. 

Serena Williams is the first night match on centre court on Monday against Mara Santangelo. 

Indias Sania Mirza will open against unheralded Ukraines Olga Savchuk in the first round on Monday. The 19-year-old Ukrainian is ranked 103 on the rankings. If she reaches the second round, Sania will face winner of the match between Emma Laine of Finland and a qualifier. 

If Sania crosses the first two hurdles, she may meet Martina Hingis of Switzerland, whom she defeated in their last meeting in the quarter final of the Korea Open in Seoul. Sanias best performance in the tournament has been a third-round appearance in her maiden season in 2005. (AP)

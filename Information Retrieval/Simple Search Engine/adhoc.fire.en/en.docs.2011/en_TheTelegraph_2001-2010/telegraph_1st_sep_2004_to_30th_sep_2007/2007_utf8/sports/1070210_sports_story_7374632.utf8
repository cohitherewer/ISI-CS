 Uzbekistan 2-0 up versus India

 Davis Cup 

Namangan (Uzbekistan): India were staring at another relegation after their second string squad conceded a 2-0 lead to hosts Uzbekistan in the Davis Cup Asia-Oceania group I first round tie here on Friday. 

Karan Rastogi and Vivek Shokeen, both making their debut, offered little resistance to their more seasoned opponents, Farrukh Dustov and Denis Istomin, respectively, and went down in straight sets in the zonal mens team tennis competition. 

After Shokeen made a heap of unforced errors to go down 1-6, 3-6, 3-6 to Istomin, Rastogi lost 3-6, 3-6, 4-6 to Dustov on the indoor clay courts of the Pahlavon Sports Complex. 

In the doubles rubber on Saturday, captain Leander Paes is scheduled to partner Sunil Kumar Sipaeya, another uncapped player, against Murad Inoyatov and Istomin. 

On the only other occasion the two teams had met before, India had drubbed Uzbekistan 5-0 in Jaipur in the second round in 2005. 

Then, Dustov and Istomin had lost in straight sets to Paes and Prakash Amritraj in the singles and the doubles to Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi in a similar fashion. (Pti)

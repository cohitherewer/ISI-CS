The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Chima puts in 

his papers

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Chima Okerie added the latest chapter in Mohun Bagans story of coaches come and coaches go. 

The Nigerian, who was roped in amid much fanfare less than two months ago, said on Saturday morning that he was putting in his papers. I was finding it difficult to adjust a lack of compatibility led to my decision. 

In the evening, after an informal meeting with some officials, Chima sounded slightly less despondent. Im through with the club for the time being, hinting that the future may hold a different story. 

Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra said Chimas resignation has been accepted as it was taken in the best interest of the club and players. 

The resignation came two days after Mohun Bagan salvaged a point against Mahindra United with a stoppage-time equaliser by Bhaichung Bhutia. 

Had the coach had differences with senior players? Nothing of that sort happened, Mitra said. 

So who will be the next coach? 

For the time being, Robson Mattos will be the stopgap coach as the team is leaving on Sunday for an AFC Cup tie versus Ostopa in Thailand on April 10. 

Once they come back, a decision on who will succeed Chima will be taken at the April 12 executive committee meeting, he informed. 

The name of Subhas Bhowmick is doing the rounds. If not as coach, as the TD.

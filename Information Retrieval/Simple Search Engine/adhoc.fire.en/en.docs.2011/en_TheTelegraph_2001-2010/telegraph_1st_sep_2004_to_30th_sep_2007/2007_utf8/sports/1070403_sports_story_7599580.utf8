Calcutta: Mohun Bagan failed to exact revenge on JCT Football Club at home and, instead, suffered a 1-3 loss to make their case in the ONGC Cup National Football League even more pathetic at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. 

Mohun Bagan lost the first-round match 0-2 in Ludhiana with Sunil Chhetri scoring the brace, when the two sides met for their Round II clash. 

On Monday after some 75 days and 10 rounds Chhetri again proved to be the nemesis for Mohun Bagan as the diminutive striker put the visitors ahead in the 19th minute. 

The lead was extended five minutes later by Man-of-the-Match Chidi Edeh. Mohun Bagan pulled one back in the 57th minute through Lalkamal Bhowmick but Adebayo made it 3-1 and took the battle out of Mohun Bagans reach in the 72nd minute. 

Mohun Bagan with 12 points from 11 matches will have to work really hard to fight relegation while JCT moved to a comfortable position with 17 points from 12 outings. 

Coach Chima Okeries ploy of playing Sanjeev Maria as central midfielder backfired as the much-needed link between midfield and defence took a nosedive. Maria who plays as a defender was all at sea in the new position, exposing the area to counter-attacks from the other end. 

The midfielders also seemed to be in a dormant mode on most occasions and therefore, were ineffective in linking up with Bhaichung Bhutia and PC Lalawmpuia. 

Chima introduced Jose Ramirez Barreto early in the second half, but the Brazilian could not elevate himself to the pivot his team was awfully missing in the midfield. 

Barreto took the field for the first time since having limped off with injury against East Bengal in February. 

Chima replaced Bhaichung with Dipendu Biswas to join Barreto and Lalawmpuia upfront but JCT stood firm against their combined threat. 

The way Dipendus right footer missed the far post after meeting an immaculate cross from Barreto and Bhaichungs back-volley that went in was disallowed on the ground of dangerous play, amply suggested the fact that it was not Mohun Bagans day. 

Chhetri, who used to don Mohun Bagan colours before moving to JCT, drew the first blood, having finished a Chidi pass, which bisected Goutam Debnath and Deepak Mondal. Five minutes later, it was Chhetris turn to set up for Chidi in increasing the lead. 

Mohun Bagan then briefly came back into the contest. A Barreto through was nicely intercepted by Mehtab Hussain, who in turn sailed the ball across for the advancing Lalkamal to do the needful. 

But in the 72nd minute, Adebayo sealed Mohun Bagans fate by tapping the ball off a Rennedy Singh free-kick and scoring. 

It was for Douglas da Silva who had a good day in office the Calcutta giants were spared further humiliation.

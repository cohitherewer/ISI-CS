Calcutta: Dhanraj Pillay fulfilled a dream by winning the Beighton Cup at the Mohun Bagan ground on Tuesday afternoon. The former India star scored the only goal of the final against BSF Jalandhar to give Indian Airlines their second title. 

The Airlines team, which lifted the trophy in 1985 and were semi-finalists last year, looked really formidable on Tuesday. The BSF players had no answer to some brilliant anticipation and stickwork by Pillay, who not surprisingly won the best forwards award. 

Indian Airlines were in control for the better part of the 70-minute affair, playing a fast well-coordinated passing game. 

BSF failed to match the speed of Pillay amp; Co., but did have their moments. In the second session, the Jalandhar side pressed hard, but couldnt get the equaliser as they failed to penetrate the last line of defence. 

For six-time champions BSF, this was their second straight failure in the final, having lost to Punjab amp; Sind Bank last year. 

A sizeable crowd had turned up and was rewarded when Pillay struck a minute before half-time. The skilful striker latched on to a loose ball on top of the striking circle and kept his cool to push home, giving no chance to goalkeeper K.M. Subbaiah. 

With Vikram Pillai working tirelessly to keep the halfline moving, and Pillay playing havoc in the attacking zone, Indian Airlines established early control. 

The title was worth Indian Airlines Rs 1 lakh, while BSF earned Rs 50,000. 

An ecstatic Pillay said later he badly wanted to win this tournament, one of the few still played on grass. Its a dream come true for me, said the former India captain.

 Lanka sweep ODI series

Colombo: Sanath Jayasuriya claimed four for 14 as Sri Lanka completed a 3-0 whitewash with a 39-run victory over Bangladesh in the final weather-affected one-day International here on Wednesday. 

Earlier, Bangladesh bowlers had raised the vision of their first win on the tour after restricting Sri Lanka to a modest 196. 

They were thwarted a bit by Jehan Mubarak, who rescued the hosts with a fine 72 after Sri Lanka had slumped to 61 for four after being put in to bat in a rain-reduced 40-over contest. 

Teenage opener Tamim Iqbal kept Bangladeshs victory hopes alive with 54 from 74 balls, adding 42 with captain Mohammed Ashraful (20) and 60 with Mahmudullah (36). 

But Jayasuriya, playing in his 398th game, sealed victory for Sri Lanka by triggering a late collapse to 157 all out as Bangladeshs last five wickets fell for 28 runs.

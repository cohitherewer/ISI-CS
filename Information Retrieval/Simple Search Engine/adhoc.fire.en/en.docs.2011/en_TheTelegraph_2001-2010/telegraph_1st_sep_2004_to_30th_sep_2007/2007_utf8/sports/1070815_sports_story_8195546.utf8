 Murali seeks damages

 Muralidharan 

Colombo: Muttiah Muralidharan has demanded millions of dollars from former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi as damages for making derogatory comments on the off-spinners bowling action, an aide said Tuesday. 

Its a letter of demand that we have sent (Bedi), Muralidharans manager, Kushil Gunasekera said. 

Bedi recently commented that Muralidharan bowled with an illegal action, and called him a cheat. 

These are derogatory (remarks), and of a personal nature, Gunasekera said. 

He said Muralidharans lawyers have demanded 750 million Sri Lankan rupees ($6.7 million) from Bedi as damages. 

The controversy comes with Muralidharan just eight wickets away from highest number of Test victims. Gunasekera said that the lawyers have given Bedi 14 days to respond and will later decide whether to file court action against him.

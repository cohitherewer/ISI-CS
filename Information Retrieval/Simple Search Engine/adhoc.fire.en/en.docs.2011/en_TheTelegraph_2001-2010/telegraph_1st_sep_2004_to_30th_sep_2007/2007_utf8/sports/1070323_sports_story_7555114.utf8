 McCullum, Vincent take Canada to cleaners

Gros Islet: Brendon McCullum battered the Canada attack for a record-fast 50 and Lou Vincent added 101 to guide New Zealand to 363 for five, their highest World Cup total. 

The group C match counted for little in terms of the competition New Zealand, with two wins, had already advanced to the Super Eights and winless Canada were already out of contention. 

Put into bat, New Zealand used its innings as batting practice and surpassed its previous highest World Cup total of 331 set two days earlier against Kenya in the 48th over. 

McCullum, batting at No. 7, reached his 50 off 20 balls. He finished unbeaten on 52 from 21 balls, slogging five sixes and one four in an 85-run sixth-wicket stand with Jacob Oram (not out 35). 

Vincent failed to score in his first two innings in St. Lucia, but on Thursday he hit a six to midwicket to earn his first World Cup runs. Once off the mark, Vincent belted nine fours and a six to reach his third hundred in his 97th ODI. Two balls later, he was caught and bowled by John Davison (two for 67) for 101. 

Stephen Fleming hit eight boundaries and a six to reach 66, when he was caught low at short midwicket by Geoff Barnett. 

Peter Fulton fell three runs shy of 50 when he was trapped lbw off Kevin Sandher (two for 58) after adding 80 runs with Vincent. Scott Styris (28 off 17 balls) hit four consecutive fours off Abdool Samad before skying a ball straight in the air which wicketkeeper Ashish Bagai ran to catch.

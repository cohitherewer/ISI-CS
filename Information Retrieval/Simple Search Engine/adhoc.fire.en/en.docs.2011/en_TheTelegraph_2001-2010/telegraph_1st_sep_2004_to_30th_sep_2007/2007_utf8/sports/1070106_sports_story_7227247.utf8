 CAB gets Rays views on Dalmiya issue 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) on Friday received legal opinions from Siddhartha Shankar Ray over the expulsion of Jagmohan Dalmiya by the BCCI and the legal eagle termed the process of expelling the former president as unenforceable. 

The BCCI, after having expelled Dalmiya on December 16 in its Jaipur meeting, has asked the state association to remove him from the CAB presidents post as well. While Dalmiya has already resigned from the post, the CAB had sought legal views on the issue from Ray. 

The law (of expelling Dalmiya) is ineffective, unenforceable and cannot be invoked by the Board in any manner, a source in the CAB told The Telegraph about Rays views on the matter. 

Rays six-page letter was also placed in the working committee meeting on Friday. According to it, the source added, CAB is an autonomous affiliate governed by its own rules and regulations and its office bearers including the president are annually elected by the members of the association to hold the office for a specified term. Hence, a post is only vacated in two circumstances death and resignation. 

It has also been learnt that Dalmiya may move court but CAB will stay away from the issue at the moment. 

Meanwhile, Dalmiyas resignation was accepted in the CAB meeting on Friday and another working committee meeting has been called on Tuesday to announce the date of special general meeting to elect the new president. 

The meeting, though, started off with vice-president Russy Jeejeebhoy walking out insulted. After Jeejeebhoys name was proposed by a joint secretary to preside over the meeting, it was opposed by another member and another vice-president Nemai Charan Duttas name was put forward. The former India player immediately left the meeting. 

The working committee also passed a resolution remembering Dalmiyas contribution to the game and decided to felicitate senior Bengal team for their Ranji performance last year, under-22 for their CK Nayudu Trophy winning feat and the Calcutta University side for their performance in Australia last year.

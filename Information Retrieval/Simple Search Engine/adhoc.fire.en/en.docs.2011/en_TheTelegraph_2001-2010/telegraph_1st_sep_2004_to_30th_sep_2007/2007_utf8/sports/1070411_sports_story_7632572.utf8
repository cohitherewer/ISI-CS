 We have the spin firepower, says Fleming

Georgetown: New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming says Daniel Vettoris bowling performance against Ireland has demonstrated the firepower his team has in the spin department. 

Vettori claimed four for 23 as the Black Caps, defending 263 for eight, skittled out the Irish for 134 in 37.4 overs at the Providence Stadium here on Monday. 

Sure it has sent a message out to other teams. Unlike in the past, we dont have just one spinner now. There is also Jeetan Patel. We have enough firepower there, Fleming said after the 129-run win. Fleming also praised Peter Fulton and Brendon McCullum. 

Fulton, filling the openers spot in the absence of Lou Vincent, hit a patient 83 that saved the side the blushes as wickets kept falling regularly at the other end. 

McCullum then smashed a 37-ball 47 as 74 runs came from the last 10 overs. 

Things have not been going well for Fulton but he helped us to a competitive score. McCullum is a class batsman and he really stamped his class today (Monday). 

Man of the Match Fulton was satisfied with his knock. 

It was a different role for me and it was nice to contribute to a win, he said. 

The first 20 overs were difficult. Full credit to the Ireland bowlers, they kept the pressure on us. But I was able to provide the platform and we managed a good total. 

Ireland skipper Trent Johnston said his side was still learning to stop the runs in the closing overs. 

After the first 10 overs, we really kept them down. But the last 10 overs there were on top of us again. We have had problems in handling those overs, we are working on that. 

Fleming thinks New Zealand are primed to win the World Cup for the first time. 

We know we are capable of winning it. Its just about how we play on the day or how we let the opposition play, Fleming said. 

As we get down to the business end were in the semis or close to it by winning one more game its going to come down to two games of cricket to win the World Cup. 

Thats an exciting prospect but also a scary one as well. To get to that point, weve got three tough games where players in form have to remain in form and weve got to be smart with our assessment of conditions. 

The result moved the Black Caps to within one victory of equalling their record 10-match ODI winning streak achieved in 2005. 

The fact we got to 263 was testament to our hitting power and McCullums ability to hit the ball over the rope and into the gaps at the death.

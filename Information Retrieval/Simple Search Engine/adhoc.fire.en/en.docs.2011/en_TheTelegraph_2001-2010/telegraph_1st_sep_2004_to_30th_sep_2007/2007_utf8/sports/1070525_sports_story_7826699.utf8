 Lewis Hamilton escapes unhurt

Monte Carlo: Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso clocked the fastest times at the Monaco Grand Prixs opening practices, while his rookie teammate Lewis Hamilton suffered his first crash of the season in the second run. 

Alonso, the defending champion at Monaco, timed 1:16.973 in his McLaren-Mercedes on his first run on the twisting street circuit, then 1:15.940 in the afternoon. 

Hamilton, the current overall leader, had the second-best time with 1:17.601 in the morning, but went almost straight to the tire barriers at the first turn of the second practice, apparently because of a steering problem. 

The 22-year-old was unhurt but the car was damaged on the left side. 

Hamilton comes to this weekends race as the youngest driver ever to lead the championship, and is looking for his first victory after finishing in the top three in his first four races. (AP)

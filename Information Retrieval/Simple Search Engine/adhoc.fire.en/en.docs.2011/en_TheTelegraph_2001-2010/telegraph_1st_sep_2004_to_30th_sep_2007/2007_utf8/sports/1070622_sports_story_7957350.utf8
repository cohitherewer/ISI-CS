The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Cup final officials could be ignored

Melbourne: Officials who stood in the 2007 World Cup final, which concluded under controversial circumstances, are likely to be overlooked for the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup. 

On-field umpires Aleem Dar and Steve Bucknor, television umpire Rudi Koertzen, reserve umpire Billy Bowden and Match Referee Jeff Crowe may have to sit out of the September meet, to be hosted by South Africa, as a consequence of their blunder, a local newspaper reported on Thursday. 

However, the International Cricket Council (ICC) refused to confirm or deny the report and said a decision on who would stand in the meet would not be made until next month. 

ICC spokesman Samiul Hasan said: We are not in a position to confirm or deny this. (PTI)

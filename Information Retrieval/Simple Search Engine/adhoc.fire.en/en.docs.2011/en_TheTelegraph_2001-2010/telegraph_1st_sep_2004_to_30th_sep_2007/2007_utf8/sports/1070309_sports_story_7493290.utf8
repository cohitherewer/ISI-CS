 Gas leak just storm in a teacup, feels Arthur

Port of Spain: South Africa coach Mickey Arthur said his squad had been neither shaken nor stirred by the drama over a gas leak at the sides hotel in Port of Spain on Wednesday. 

The Trinidad Hilton was evacuated at 8.15am (12.15 GMT) after guests and staff were overcome with fumes that were later traced to a gas leak on the eighth floor of the 12-storey building. 

Fourteen were taken to hospital but none were members of the South Africa, Pakistan, Canadian or Ireland squads staying at the hotel, police said. 

Its a bit of storm in a teacup and we just want to get out there and play some cricket, Arthur said after South Africas net practice later on Wednesday. 

Im not nervous about going back there, and I think the boys will just be only too happy to get back to the hotel and get their heads on their pillows after the session weve had. 

The South Africans left the hotel shortly after the evacuation and returned some five hours later once the all-clear had been issued by emergency personnel. 

Arthur, whose room is on the eighth floor, was the only South African who felt the effects of the leak. I certainly had some tears when I walked out of my room this morning, so it could have been tear gas, he said. 

The Canada and Ireland squads, also based at the hotel, left the premises too. 

The Pakistan squad stayed in their team room, which is attached to the hotel but is not in the main building. 

Were champing at the bit for the World Cup proper to start now, Arthur said. It feels as if weve been here forever and nothing has really happened. 

Security, however, has been increased for the cricketers in Trinidad after the incident, local organisers said Thursday. Anand Daniel, head of the Trinidad and Tobago organising committee, said the government had put Wednesdays incident at the Hilton Hotel at their highest priority. (Agencies)

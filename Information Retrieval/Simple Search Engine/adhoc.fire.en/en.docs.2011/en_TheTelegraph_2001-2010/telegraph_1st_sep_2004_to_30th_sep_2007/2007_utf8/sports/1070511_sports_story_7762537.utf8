The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bangalore season from today 

 SRIMAX

 Bangalore: The Bangalore summer season, advanced by a day to accomodate the Ooty Derby, will kickstart on Friday. 

 A last-minute truce among agitating trainers, owners and the BTC has allowed the start of the season as scheduled. 

 The season promises to be an interesting one with a total of 800 horses (150 outstation included) vying for honours. A total stake of Rs. 11.5 crores is up for grabs making it the highest in the country. Local owners will get an additional incentive if their horses perform. 

 Australian jockey Aaron Spiteri has been retained by Vijay Mallya. Another Australian jockey who will ride this season for Mallya is Troy Jackman. 

 Champion trainer S. Ganapathy, back after bypass surgery, has the best three-year-olds and will be in the limelight as usual. His son, Karthik, has been given a trainers licence and he should also be in the thick of things. 

 Another trainer who has also got his licence is S. Attaollah. He will be guiding Mallyas horses. 

 S. Ganapathy-trained Classic Sky may win the Mayors Cup.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I didnt 

 call Graham Ford on Rahul Dravids behalf

 - Former captain and interim coach Shastri opens up 

 A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Ravi Shastri 

 Calcutta: Former India 

 captain Ravi Shastri was in the pool at the Taj Connemara 

 when The Telegraph caught up with him in Chennai 

 on Sunday morning. One of the seven members of the BCCIs 

 special committee, he took questions specific to South African 

 Graham Fords appointment as the Team India coach. 

 As usual, Shastri was candid. 

 The following are excerpts

 On whether hes relieved 

 that the coach has finally been selected

 Not relieved... The process was 

 about picking the right man and the committee made its decision 

 unanimously... It may have taken a bit of time, but we had 

 to do the job well. Good luck to Graham.

 On being the one to call 

 Ford and ascertaining his availability

 I did make that call, yes... Being 

 on the committee, I had to look around as to who was available... 

 Look at the track record of the ones available... I was 

 looking for somebody connected with the sport, somebody 

 hands-on... Somebody successful... Frankly, there werent 

 many around... In ODIs, for example, Graham has the best 

 record after John Buchanan.

 On whether he made that 

 call at captain Rahul Dravids behest

 I didnt call Graham on Rahuls 

 behalf... I did so as a member of the committee empowered 

 to select the coach... I made the call on my own behalf... 

 Rahul is old enough to pick up the phone and do the talking 

 himself. Im just as capable. 

On the qualities he was 

 looking for

 A good track record... Good man 

 management... The ability to carry the dressing room with 

 him... Whatever the level, one would look for these qualities 

 in any coach.

 On Fords presentation 

 before the committee late on Saturday

 He was good... (After a pause) 

 So was John Emburey...

 On what clinched it for 

 Ford

 The committee felt hes more 

 hands-on... Has a good track record and has worked with 

 some of the big players of the time...

 On the questions lobbed 

 at Ford

 Thats something which happened 

 in the dressing room and should remain there. 

 Lets just say Graham passed the test.

 On whether it was awkward 

 having to drop Emburey, somebody hed played 

 against

 Its part of the game... 

 Look, both knew only one would become the Team India coach. 

 They arent kids and, clearly, one cant have 

 two coaches. 

 On the home work he did 

 on Ford

 I spoke to some people in South 

 Africa... I wouldnt like to publicise their names...

 On whether Team India 

 needed a low profile coach

 Look, the profile is important... 

 Whats more important is the coachs track record... 

 His man management skills... Ford comes with the experience 

 of around 15 years of coaching... Thats not easily 

 sold or bought in the market.

 On the Greg Chappell era

 Please, I dont wish to comment 

 on whats past.

 On one-time frontrunner 

 Dav Whatmore not even being called for the presentation

 Ill only say weve 

 picked the most appropriate coach. Thats it.

 On Fords biggest 

 challenge

 Being new, he has to first know 

 the players... That would be the top challenge for any new 

 coach... After that, he has to identify the areas he needs 

 to work on and forge a harmonious partnership with the other 

 support staff.

 On the time Ford may require 

 to settle down

 Give him five-six months... Im 

 not going to expect immediate results.

 On whether a longer contract 

 would have been better

 But theres the option of 

 a two-year extension after the first year... Its fair 

 on Graham, too... Even he can assess things after 12 months. 

 The duration isnt an issue and dont forget one 

 year is a long time.

 On whether, having been 

 the interim coach, he intends briefing Ford

 Hes experienced enough and 

 I dont need to give tips... If he does wish to talk, 

 then Ill answer his queries.

 On whether, at any time, 

 he was tempted to continue beyond Bangladesh

 Never. I was clear about it. So 

 was the BCCI.

 On the BCCI deciding to 

 extend the contracts of specialist coaches Venkatesh Prasad 

 and Robin Singh

 Its an excellent move... 

 Theyll be working with Graham for a year, at least.

 On speculation that we 

 could also have a batting coach

 I dont wish to comment on 

 speculation. One can, of course, always get somebody who 

 is familiar with conditions in a particular country. 

 On whispers that differences 

 cropped up between him and fellow-committee member Sunil 

 Gavaskar

 People can talk and write what they want, but Sunny and 

 I have known each other for years. Thats the bottomline. 

 Finally, on his plans 

 for the immediate future

 (Laughs) To know that, 

 friend, watch ESPN more regularly!

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ready for the challenges 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Karthik 

Mumbai: With Mahendra Singh Dhoni making such an impact in ODIs, few imagined Dinesh Karthik would actually make a comeback in the shorter version. That, too, as a batsman who can keep! 

Indeed, it has been fairy tale stuff. One which began in South Africa earlier this season. 

I feel very proud... Its a big moment... Its exciting that I will soon be a World Cupper... Im ready for the challenges ahead, Karthik told The Telegraph when contacted on his cellphone some hours after he made the XV. 

Asked whether he planned to celebrate on Monday evening, Karthik laughed: Not really... Were in the midst of an important series and my focus is on the next match (Wednesday, in Goa)... Tonight, I would just like to sleep early... 

Even if Karthik was restless last night, hes certainly going to sleep well.

Calcutta: East Bengal managed full points against Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) in their Premier Division opener on Monday. East Bengal won 2-0 in their own backyard. 

The holders got two goals early in the match. Mehtab Hussain drew first blood in the ninth minute and two minutes later Brazilian Edmilson Marques made it 2-0. 

Mehtab scored easily after playing one-two with an advancing Surya Bikash Chakraborty. A couple of minutes later, Edmilson received a long ball, again from Surya, and made no mistake. However, he did miss a few gilt-edged chances later in the 90-minute affair. 

Snehasish Chakraborty and Surya deserve special mention for keeping the ball supply constant, but Edmilson, who was outnumbered by the CPT defenders, was under the strict vigil. 

CPTs Nigerian recruit Mark Dennis Asam (Figo) did pose some problem for Gurpreet Singh and M. Suresh, but ultimately the Gurpreet-Suresh pair had the last laugh in denying the Nigerian any space in the penetrating zone. 

East Bengal combined well only in patches, particularly after the lemon break. 

We played much better in the second half, East Bengal coach Subrata Bhattacharya said, after his debut match for the winners. Bhattacharya added that its quite natural for the players to be a bit rusty as this was the season opener. It will gradually get better, he added. 

Saumik Dey, Jayanta Sen, Mehtab Hussain and captain Chandan Das were seen moving quickly in the midfield. East Bengal getting the brace quite early was enough to pour water on the enthusiasm of CPTs young bunch. Coach Tarun Dey felt that his boys created four sitters after the breather, but it wasnt enough to snatch a point from the giants. We showed a better display in the last 20 minutes, but that was too late for us, Dey said.

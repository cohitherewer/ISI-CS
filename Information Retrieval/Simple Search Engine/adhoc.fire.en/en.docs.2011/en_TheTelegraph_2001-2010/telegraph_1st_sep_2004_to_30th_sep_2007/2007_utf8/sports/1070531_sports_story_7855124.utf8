 Sania breaks jinx

Paris: Sania Mirza recorded her maiden singles win at the French Open beating Italian Alberta Brianti in the first round on Wednesday. 

The 20-year-old Indian, who had stumbled at the first hurdle in her earlier two attempts, thrashed Brianti 6-1, 6-1 to storm into the second round at the Roland Garros. 

The Hyderabadi girl saved two breakpoints in the opening game but that was the only time she found herself in trouble in the match that lasted only 54 minutes. 

The first Indian to win a WTA title slammed 54 winners, as against Briantis 30, and three aces. 

Sanias win was all the more creditable as she came into the tournament with a 0-2 win-loss record since returning from a 2-1/2 months injury lay-off. 

She got her first break by hitting an on-the-run forehand winner down the line to go up 3-0. Brianti, who had a 1-0 head-to-head record against her rival before the game, held her serve then to register her name on the score sheet. But it was a while before she tasted success again. Sania was in scorching form, belting winners on both flanks and won the next seven consecutive games. 

She next faces Serbias Ana Ivanovic who beat Sofia Arvidsson of Sweden 6-2, 6-0. 

However, Sania has now found a way to deal with her stardom and the pressures that came along with it, and she is happy as ever to be an Indian. 

Everything I am today, I am because of India, Sania said after her maiden singles win on Wednesday. Of course, there are lots of times when you just want your privacy. It is hard when you are one in a billion. 

There have been champions from India before her, namely the Krishnans and the Amritrajs, and recently Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi. 

But a combination of photogenic look and being a teenage girl catapulted her into stardom two years ago. 

It is only natural that Sania understands well the enormous pressure the Indian cricketers are subjected to whenever they take the field. There is always pressure for them to do well. But I told them that there are 11 of you. There is just one of me, she said. There are always a lot of people who want you to do well. You have to learn to block it out, she said. 

Sania will partner French Grand Slam champion Fabrice Santoro, while Mahesh Bhupathi will step on to the court with Paola Saurez of Argentina in the mixed doubles. 

Leander Paes will be playing with American Meghann Shaughnessy. (Agencies)

 The jelly beans story

 Michael Vaughan at Trent Bridge on Tuesday. Is he popping a jelly bean into his mouth? 

 Jelly beans are a favourite among cricketers not only as an energy boost they also help turn saliva sugary, which makes it easier to polish the ball. 

 They were also a favourite of former US president Ronald Reagan, who made them a staple in the Oval Office and on Air Force One. 

 One maker of the sweets is said to have created blueberry flavour so Reagan could serve red, white and blue beans at parties. 

 In 1983, jelly beans were sent aboard the space shuttle Challenger as a surprise for the astronauts. 

 Most experts believe the sweets jelly centre is a descendent of the West Asian confection Turkish Delight, which is thought to date back to Biblical times. 

 On October 15, 1999, the worlds largest jar of jelly beans was unveiled. It weighed 6,050lb. 

 April 22 is National Jelly Bean Day in the US.

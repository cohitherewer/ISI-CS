 Mike Athertons volte-face

 - Former England captain now says he has great admiration for Sachin 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former England captain Michael Atherton has gone back on his words regarding Sachin Tendulkar. 

Atherton had joined the debate started by former Australian captain Ian Chappell on whether Sachin should call it a day in the aftermath of his poor showing in the World Cup. The headline of his column, back then, was: Sachin Tendulkar, now just a comic hero. 

But in his latest column published in The Sunday Telegraph, the former England captain eulogised the maestro, saying he has nothing but great admiration for the Indian. 

Watching Tendulkar bat throughout this series has been a curious business; his decline at once obvious and yet, since that decline has been accompanied by two telling innings, there comes with it a greater admiration. 

Decline is a relative term, of course. It is simply that Tendulkar is now a very fine player rather than a very great one. He can no longer play like the prince of his youth few can or could except in the kind of glorious snapshot that we witnessed so briefly on Friday afternoon. 

In his earlier column, Atherton had doubted that if sponsorship deals were among the reasons that was keeping Sachin going. 

The truth is that Tendulkar has been marketed as a brand for some time. There are many interested parties who are keen to see him wearing Indias colours for a while yet, he had said. 

Yet, in his latest column, Atherton conceded that India will take the spoils at the end of this match and the man (Sachin) who is (absurdly) criticised for not playing enough match-winning innings, has done as much as anyone to make it so. 

He was utterly impressed by the maestros approach in this three-Test series. 

Look at how he has approached each innings and the minor adjustments he has made each time. Monty Panesar trapped him lbw at Lords, and thereafter Tendulkar played him with his bat, not pad. 

At Trent Bridge, Vaughan set a successful trap at leg-gully; thereafter Tendulkar decided (with one exception) that he was not hooking nor was he fending, which meant taking blow upon blow on the body. Each innings has been carefully pre-planned and thought out which is a wonderful lesson to all those who havent always given their talent or the demands of the game due care or attention. 

Atherton, who had written off one of the greatest batsman of all time in his earlier column, now admitted that on Friday afternoon, Tendulkar rewound the clock to a time when batting came as easily and as naturally to him as the breathing of air. 

That glorious snapshot was revealed as he moved through the 70s and into the 80s. He did it with three shots a punched straight drive off the back foot, a classical on-drive off the front foot and a savage square cut and we were back briefly with the teenager whose carefree strokeplay had dazzled us all for the first time nearly two decades ago. 

The former England captain lauded the maestros humility. 

In this series he has batted entirely without ego, which is an astonishing thing given that he, along with Shane Warne, is the greatest cricketer of his age. 

And in doing so, he has shown that he is, above all else, a craftsman always prepared to give the art of batting the ultimate respect.

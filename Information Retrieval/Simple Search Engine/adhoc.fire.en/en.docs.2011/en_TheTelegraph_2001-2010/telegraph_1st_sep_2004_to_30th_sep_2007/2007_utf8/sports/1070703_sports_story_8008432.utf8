The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Now, a lot 

 of people will shut up, says Yuvraj Singh

 - After what happened in the World Cup, it was important 

 to beat one of the big teams 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL

 Glasgow: It was around 

 6.30 pm (IST) on Monday that the Indian cricketers reached 

 the Hilton. The check-in formalities didnt take time, 

 but the Rahul Dravids still looked tired. Some, like Yuvraj 

 Singh, were hungry as well. Yuvraj (MoM in the decider against 

 South Africa) promptly ordered fish-chips and spoke to The 

 Telegraph while waiting for room service to oblige.

 The following are excerpts

 On Sundays effort in Belfast

 The first three wickets had 

 fallen quite early and it was important to hold the innings 

 together The ball had been seaming Rahul and I had a good 

 partnership and, then, (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni came to the 

 wicket His presence makes me comfortable as he can strike 

 the ball hard and runs fast Its pleasing that I played 

 a hand in finishing the game. Thats what I like doing.

 On being adjudged MoM after 15 

 months (last being in Kochi, versus England)

 Such awards are merely a recognition 

 of a significant contribution The unbeaten 61 wouldnt 

 have meant anything had we not won the match and the series 

 Actually, till you reminded me, I didnt realise my 

 last award was that far back

On the celebrations

 (Grins) Continued till 

 rather late in the night We deserved to celebrate.

 On the significance of winning 

 a series against South Africa for the first time overseas

 After what happened in the 

 World Cup, it was important to beat one of the big teams 

 Only recently, the South Africans were ranked No.1 and, 

 so, the win is going to give lots of confidence Its 

 never easy coming back from a 0-1 deficit, that too in conditions 

 which suited South Africas attack.

 On just about everybody contributing 

 in the decider

 Absolutely In fact, the boys 

 did well throughout Watching Sachin (Tendulkar) was such 

 a delight He batted the way he did in his younger days 

 Then, somebody like young Piyush Chawla bowled very well 

 Cricket is a team sport and everybody has to contribute 

 in his role.

 On the outcry after Team Indias 

 first-round exit from the World Cup

 We didnt do well, but 

 the reactions were in the extreme Now, a lot of people 

 will shut up Too many things were being said but, after 

 yesterday, that should change Only those whove played 

 the game for some length of time are going to appreciate 

 the pressures faced by us cricketers Passion is fine but, 

 at the end of the day, cricket is just a sport. Those who 

 get too emotional must remember that.

 On Tuesdays ODI

 Any match versus Pakistan is 

 a big game Weve beaten South Africa and, some weeks 

 ago, they defeated Sri Lanka (in Abu Dhabi) It should be 

 very competitive, provided theres no interference 

 from the weather.

 On the remainder of what is a 

 long tour

 Theres even tougher cricket 

 coming up I havent played a Test for a year and, 

 hopefully, Ill get a chance Of course, I realise 

 theres so much competition Thats why I didnt 

 make the XI in Bangladesh

 Finally, on whether hes 

 disappointed at not getting the vice-captaincy in ODIs

 Any responsibility is an honour 

 The selectors felt Dhoni is capable of doing a better job 

 and, believe me, Im happy for him Its to Dhonis 

 advantage that he has got this responsibility so early in 

 his career Hes a wonderful cricketer Im happy 

 being an ordinary member of the team Its not an issue 

 with me Im focusing on whats there, not what 

 isnt there. I live in the present.

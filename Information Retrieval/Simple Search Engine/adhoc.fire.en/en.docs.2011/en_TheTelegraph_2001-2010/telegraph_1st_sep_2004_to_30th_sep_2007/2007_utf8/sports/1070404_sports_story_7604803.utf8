 Great effort from bowlers: Fleming

St Johns: New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming heaped praise on his bowlers for laying the foundation for a comprehensive nine-wicket win (as reported in Tuesdays Late City edition) against Bangladesh in their World Cup Super Eight match here on Monday. 

The Black Caps skittled out Bangladesh for 174 in 48.3 overs and it was even more creditable as they did it without the full services of pace duo Michael Mason and James Franklin. 

Skipper Stephen Fleming then smashed 102 not out his eighth ODI hundred help his side achieve the target in the 30th over 

Our bowling on a batting track like that was a great effort. We lost two of our strike bowlers Mason and Franklin to injury, but to get them out for 174 was a great effort. It was very impressive, Fleming said after the match. 

Mason limped off the field with a calf strain and Franklin sat out major part of the innings with a migraine. 

New Zealand lost pacer Daryl Tuffey and opener Lou Vincent to injury after the competition got underway. 

Shane (Bond) gets wickets when he comes back on, Scotty (Styris) and Jacob (Oram) also bowled well. Its all working well for us at the moment, Fleming said. 

Styris and Oram shared seven wickets between them, while Man-of-the Match Bond finished with two for 15 off 10 overs. 

Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar was left to rue that the total of 174 was just not defendable. 

This score was never going to be enough. It was a good batting track and we let ourselves down. It could have been a good match had we managed 240-250, Bashar said. 

Heavy defeats against two of the strongest World Cup contenders seem to have left Bangladesh demoralised and confused whether to go for runs or preserve wickets early on. 

I hope we dont repeat these mistakes match after match, Bashar added. 

Openers Javed Omar and Tamim Iqbal put on 55, but consumed as many as 16 overs. 

The team was then perfect candidate for a late-order collapse, which was triggered by Bond. The express strike bowler took two wickets in one over of his second spell. 

The plan was not to lose too many early wickets, Bashar said. But we became too careful. 

The wicket was very good. If one of the top four batsmen can bat until the 40 or 45 overs then we will do better. 

Coach Dav Whatmore told his batsmen after the Australia defeat that they should not throw their wickets away. 

We need to do something in between, Bashar said. It has been either too much attacking or too much blocking. 

Bangladesh, who defeated India, have only five wins against the top eight ODI sides, the last of which in the group stage saw the subcontinental giants being eliminated from the World Cup. 

Bangladesh face top-ranked South Africa in Guyana on Saturday. 

Definitely the confidence will be down, Bashar said. It is important to put up a good show to get that back.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IN THE CITY

 Mohun Bagan are planning to go international in look. If everything goes according to plans, the national club may have a theme song soon before the Professional League. The club officials have got in touch with renowned music composer Bappi Lahiri, who is currently in the US. The club is also considering having a mascot. 

 East Bengals chances of hosting the CFL Premier Division matches at home still hangs in the balance. Having earlier expressed their displeasure about the condition of East Bengal galleries, the PWD officials inspected the ground on Wednesday. However, a decision will only be known once the police make another round of inspection, most probably on Friday. 

 FOOTBALL: CFL Premier Division CPT vs George Telegraph (Howrah); E. Railway vs Peerless (Barasat). Matches from 3.30 pm.

 Tiger hot on leader Baddeleys trail

 - US OPEN 

 - Ive been there before and I know what it takes, warns 

 world No. 1 

 DAMON HACK

Oakmont: In the foothills near Pittsburgh and in the crucible of golf, a former child prodigy named Aaron Baddeley chased a glimmering sunset and tried to grasp a slippery lead in the 107th US Open. 

On his final hole on Saturday at the Oakmont Country Club, with shadows criss-crossing a lopsided green, Baddeley drew back his putter blade from 15 feet and sent his golf ball trundling into the hole. 

With a short fist pump and a wide smile, Baddeley made a birdie that increased his lead in the championship and won him a place in the final group with Tiger Woods. 

Its perfect, said Baddeley, whose par 70 gave him a total of two-over 212 and a two-stroke lead over Woods, who shot 69. If you had asked me which player in the world Id like to play with, its Tiger. Hes the best player in the world, but I feel like Im playing nicely. 

Baddeley, a 26-year-old from Australia who once tore up the amateur circuit, held a three-shot lead over Paul Casey (72), Stephen Ames (73), Justin Rose (73) and Bubba Watson (74). ngel Cabrera (76), who held the lead after 36 holes, stood four shots back, along with Jim Furyk (70) and Steve Stricker (68). David Toms (73), Stuart Appleby (71) and Niclas Fasth (75) trailed by five. 

On a third consecutive day that had Oakmont roaring, Baddeley surged into position to be the second straight Australian to win the Open, following Geoff Ogilvys feat last year at Winged Foot. 

To get there, Baddeley will have to overcome a bunched-up international leaderboard. No player is closer to him on the board than Woods, who had his best ball-striking round to move into contention for his 13th Major championship although he has never come from behind after 54 holes to win. 

Baddeley, who played with Woods in the Masters in 2000 and missed the cut, is a different and better player now. 

After seeing his career mostly fizzle after turning professional in 2000, Baddeley won his first PGA Tour event last year at the Verizon Heritage and his second in February at the FBR Open. 

Woods put together one of the best rounds of the championship, hitting 17 of 18 greens and nine of 14 fairways. 

But he knew it could have been better. 

After hitting every green in his first 17 holes, he pushed his drive into a fairway bunker on the right at No. 18, and he could advance his ball only to the fairway. Woods then hit a pitch shot to 15 feet, but he missed his putt for par. It was his only bogey of the round. 

I hit a lot of good putts that just grazed the edge, he said. You just dont want to end on a dropped shot. Id be miffed if I hit bad putts, but I hit good ones. 

Woods, who trailed Cabrera by five shots going into Saturdays round, made a quick push up the leaderboard. He easily skirted the Church Pews bunker between the third and fourth holes and ended up with birdies on both. He then ran off 13 pars in a row. 

I felt like I could control my ball all day, Woods said. This golf course does not lend itself to a lot of birdies. 

Oakmont continued to play firm and fast, but a Friday night watering of the greens by officials of the United States Golf Association kept the course under control. Ian Poulter, who shot 72 and stood at 11-over, said the greens were noticeably slower than they were Friday. 

You could see they have given them a little douse of water, he said. It is playing fair too fair, to be honest. I would have liked to have seen it extremely hard and hope guys tumbled back. 

Several players did, anyway. Cabrera seemed to come unglued after holding the overnight lead as he sprayed shots around the course and had to play several from ankle-deep rough. 

On a leaderboard stacked with newcomers and rising stars, Woods spelled out a key advantage he may have over his lesser-known competitors. 

Theyre going to deal with emotions that theyve probably never dealt with before, he said. It helps to have experience. Ive been there before, and I know what it takes. 

Other than Woods, only Furyk, Toms and Vijai Singh, who was six shots back, were players in contention who have won a Major title.

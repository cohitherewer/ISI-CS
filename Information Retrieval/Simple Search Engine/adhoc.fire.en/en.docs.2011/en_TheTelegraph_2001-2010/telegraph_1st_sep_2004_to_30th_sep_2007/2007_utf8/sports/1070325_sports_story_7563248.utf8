 Woolmer inquiry

Kingston: A local coroner has ordered that the body of murdered Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer be kept in Jamaica until an inquest is held, an official said on Friday. The body had been expected to leave Kingston on either Friday or Saturday for Cape Town, South Africa. 

The police met with the coroner (Patrick Murphy) here on Friday and it was decided that the body must be detained until the inquiry is held, said a police spokesman. 

Meanwhile, according to Pakistan team spokesman Pervez Mir, assistant manager Asad Mustafa and fitness trainer Murray Stevenson would stay back in Jamaica to assist the inquiry.

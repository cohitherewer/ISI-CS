 Harikrishna shocks Tiviakov

Montreal: Grandmaster P. Harikrishna scored a significant win over Sergei Tiviakov in the eighth round of the Montreal International chess tournament here. 

Harikrishna now occupies the second position along with Tiviakov, half-a-point behind Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine. 

It was an exciting day in the tournament as four of the five games ended decisively and Ivanchuk made the most of Tiviakovs loss by shooting into the lead with a win against GM Kamil Miton with the black pieces. 

GM Nigel Short overcame his abysmal form to register his first victory of the tournament by beating Pavel Eljanov while Gata Kamsky fell back to the fourth position when he drew his game against Pascal Chabonneau.

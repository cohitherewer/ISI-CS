 Lara offers to help probe

Antigua: Unhappy with the media speculation over his DNA test, during investigation into Pakistan coach Bob Woolmers murder case, West Indies captain Brian Lara said on Monday that he would like to help the officials probing the incident. 

You know how the media is. Unfortunately, I was staying on the same floor and hence was DNA-tested. From our side, we are prepared to help the investigations as much as we can, Lara said. 

Meanwhile, PCB chief Dr Nasim Ashraf has dismissed predecessor Shaharyar Khans suggestion that there was a power struggle between Woolmer and Inzamam-ul Haq. 

Their relationship was very cordial. Bob was a gentleman... He never said a strong word, Ashraf said.

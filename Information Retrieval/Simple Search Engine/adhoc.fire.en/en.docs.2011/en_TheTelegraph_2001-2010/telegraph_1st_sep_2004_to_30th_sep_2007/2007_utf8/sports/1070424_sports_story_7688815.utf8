 England need left-handers

DEREK PRINGLE

England leave the World Cup with a farewell win for their departing coach after beating the West Indies, the other tactically moribund team here, in a last-over thriller. Yet, they fly home knowing they are at least a Powerplay behind the four semi-finalists who fight it out this week for a place in Saturdays final. 

If you were being charitable, you may think there were some good signs for England last Saturday, as there were for the tournament which, on the back of a big Barbadian cheerio to Brian Lara, had its first sell-out crowd. 

A bold innings from captain Michael Vaughan, another hundred from Kevin Pietersen and a telling cameo from Paul Nixon, all helped England to their second win against Test-playing oppositions. But the bowling was dire England conceded 300; Vaughan only hit over the top because the pressure was off; and Pietersen and Nixon got out without seeing the job through. A marginally better team than West Indies and that includes everyone but the minnows and England would have lost. 

The next World Cup is four years away and while it is too soon to identify the names in Englands future XI, Duncan Fletchers replacement, Peter Moores, could do a lot worse than study the current semi-finalists Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and South Africa to see what kind of players are fit for purpose. 

One factor common to all four is an aggressive left-handed opening batsman Australia have two who see the opening overs as a means to print runs rather than accumulate them. Finding one even half as dominant as Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden, Sanath Jayasuriya or Graeme Smith is a priority. 

The next World Cup is held in Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, places where Powerplays must be exploited to the full. The left-handedness is important. Most pace bowlers are right-armed and find it easier to contain and set fields to their batting equivalents. Cack-handers create more angles and, therefore, more run-scoring opportunities. 

England have left-handers in Andrew Strauss and Ed Joyce, but they need the ball to be short before they can lift it over the infield. Essexs Alastair Cook has the muscles, though not yet the nerve, but that could come, though he must improve his fielding, which is ponderous at present. One right-handed possibility is Surreys James Benning, whose Twenty20 strike-rate is a massive 146.5 runs per 100 balls faced. 

The other obvious quality the semi-finalists have is the ability to take wickets at any time, and more specifically in the middle overs, a period England seem content to sit back and watch batsmen milk them for five or six runs an over. 

Muttiah Muralidharan is a one-off, so England cannot hope to find a spinner like him in four years, but a player similar to New Zealands Shane Bond or South Africas Andre Nel should not be beyond the cupboard. 

As a starter pack, Moores should look no further than New Zealand, a side with no obvious star players, except Bond, but a lot of very good ones. They possess a calm steadiness, one that reaches all the way up to the cerebellum, something England presently lack.

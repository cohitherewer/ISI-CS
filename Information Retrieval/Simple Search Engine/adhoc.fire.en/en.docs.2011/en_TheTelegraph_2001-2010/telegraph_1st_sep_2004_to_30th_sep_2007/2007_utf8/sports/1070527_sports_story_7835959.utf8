 Im trying my best to be a good opener, says Karthik

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Dhaka: Dinesh Karthik has always believed he has it in him to be an opener. He hopes those who were not sure of his ability are now convinced after his maiden Test century on Saturday. 

The Tamil Nadu batsman hit a fighting 129 one of four centuries to help India declare their first innings at 610 for three in the final Test. 

Hopefully, talk of my not being a regular opener will stop now. I am trying my best to become a very good opener, Karthik told reporters after the second days action at the Sher-e-Bangla Stadium here. 

Karthik was picked in the ODI squad in 2004, as replacement for wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel. Shortly afterwards, he made his Test debut against Australia in Mumbai, but was subsequently axed. 

He returned last year for the tour of South Africa and played the final Test as an opener because Virender Sehwag failed in the first two (Sehwag batted down the order in the final Test). 

Sehwag hasnt found a berth in the Test squad of the ongoing series. Yet, Karthik draws inspiration from Sehwags transformation from a middle-order batsman to an opener. 

Veerubhai began as a middle-order batsman before becoming an opener. If I keep getting runs, I will probably be able to cement my place as an opener, Karthik said. 

I am trying to change my batting to suit Test cricket. I know I have to work a lot on footwork... Concentration is the key to succeeding as an opener, he added. 

Karthik thanked the support staff for the efforts they put in to make him fit after he was forced to retire with cramps on Day I. 

Dedicating the knock to his family, and especially wife Nikita who constantly cheered him from the dressing room Karthik said their support helped him fight the odds. I was running a slight temperature last night, but my wife stayed up to help me out. Its nice to have the family around when you are facing a crisis. 

Karthik said this knock came under tougher conditions than his previous best effort (93 against Pakistan at the Eden three years ago). 

Conditions were extremely tough here... thanks to the heat and humidity. But that innings (against Pakistan) was special because we had won the Test. I would be happy if we win here also.

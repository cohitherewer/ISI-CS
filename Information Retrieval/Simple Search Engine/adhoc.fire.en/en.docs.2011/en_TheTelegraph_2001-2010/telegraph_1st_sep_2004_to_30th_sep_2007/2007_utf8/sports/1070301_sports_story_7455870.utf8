The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Coaches clarion call for unity 

JAYDEEP BASU

New Delhi: Football coaches in India are a worried lot these days. Stung by the unceremonious sacking of Subhas Bhowmick by Mohammedan Sporting in Calcutta recently, senior club coaches all over the country are now toying with the idea of forming an association to protect their interests in professional football. 

The idea has gained immediate interest. Top coaches feel that something should be done immediately to stop the maltreatment of soccer teachers and there should be clear rules to prevent club officials from showing coaches the door as and when they feel like. 

Mahindra United coach Derek Pereira, the most successful man last season, was also the most forthcoming. I think we should sit together and form an association before next season starts. I have been talking to a few club coaches informally for the past few months. After what happened with Bhowmick, we should treat the issue more urgently, he said. 

Pereira feels that Calcutta clubs, in particular, have a habit of turning the coachs post into a musical chair, but he appeared confident that proper contract laws would be able to buck the trend. Coaches should not take up an assignment on verbal assurance They should demand a written contract. 

For both JCT coach Sukhwinder Singh and Armando Colaco of Dempo, the Bhowmick issue has left a bad taste in the mouth. 

You win a match and overnight become a hero. You lose the next two and find yourself being thrown in a gutter. This is disgusting, said Sukhwinder, a former India coach. 

An association is the need of the hour. I shall certainly associate myself with it, he said.Colaco said this is one issue where the coaches should take a leaf out of the players book. Like them, we should also form an association. It will not only help us but also the game. 

While the All India Football Federation (AIFF) general secretary, Alberto Colaco, said that a coaches association can be formed any time in India since it has the sanction of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), Churchill Brothers Moroccan coach Karim Bencherifa is quite surprised that no such body exists in India.

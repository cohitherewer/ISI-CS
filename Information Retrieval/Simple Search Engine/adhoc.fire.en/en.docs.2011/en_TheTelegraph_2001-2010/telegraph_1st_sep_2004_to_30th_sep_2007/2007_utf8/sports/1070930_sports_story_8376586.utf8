 Hamilton pips Alonso to pole

Fuji: Lewis Hamilton snatched pole position from McLaren teammate and bitter rival Fernando Alonso with a last gasp flying lap at the end of a wet and foggy Japanese Grand Prix qualifying session on Saturday. 

The championship-leading rookie, who has accused Alonso of disloyalty and unsporting behaviour, pummelled the air in jubilation with his fists after shoving the Spaniard into second place. 

Double world champion Alonso, two points behind Hamilton with three races left, was on top at the chequered flag but Hamilton pulled out all the stops on his final run to beat him by 0.070 seconds. 

The pole position, at a track he only saw for the first time on Thursday, was the 22-year-old Britons fifth in 15 Formula One races. 

Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen, the third man in a thrilling title battle and 13 points adrift of Hamilton, qualified third with Brazilian team mate Felipe Massa fourth. 

Ferrari have already secured the constructors championship after McLaren were fined a record $100 million and stripped of all their 2007 points for having Ferrari technical information in their possession. 

Germanys Nick Heidfeld qualified fifth for BMW Sauber, with Briton Jenson Button a surprising sixth for Honda in that teams highest grid placing of the year.

 WI aim for a final flourish

Chester-le-street: Beleaguered West Indies hope fast bowler Fidel Edwards can carry on from where he left off at Old Trafford as they look to restore some pride in the final Test against England. 

Stand-in captain Daren Ganga urged his teammates to maintain self-belief despite not winning any of their last 19 Tests. 

We all have to ensure we have the right work ethic and believe strongly that we are going to win and we are going to get back to our winning ways, Ganga said on Thursday. 

Old Trafford saw the return to Test cricket of Edwards, whose extra pace gave the West Indies a physical threat theyd otherwise lacked so far this series. 

The 25-year-old Barbados round-arm paceman bowled better in Manchester than match figures of four for 148 in 32.1 overs suggest. 

However, the Australian stressed Edwards pace was part of an overall bowling strategy. 

If Fidel is making them jump around a bit, we need someone down the other end to be putting pressure on as well. Corey Collymore is very much an unsung player for us. Hes our top wicket-taker, he just keeps chipping away with a very good economy rate. 

England are set to recall Matthew Hoggard, who has missed the last two Tests with a groin injury. 

Meanwhile, Michael Vaughan, already Englands most successful captain in Tests, said on Thursday that Panesars exuberance should not be discouraged even though he was warned for excessive appealing. 

At Old Trafford, Pakistani umpire Aleem Dar politely asked him to appeal before celebrating, but did not take the matter further. 

Were in a position of maybe taking characters out of the game, Vaughan said. 

We all love Monty, he appeals, he celebrates with a high-five, hes brilliant for the game. We dont want to see that taken away.

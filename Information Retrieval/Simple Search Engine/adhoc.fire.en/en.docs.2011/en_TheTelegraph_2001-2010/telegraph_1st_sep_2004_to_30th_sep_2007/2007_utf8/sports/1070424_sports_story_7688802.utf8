 AIFF to release list of national players

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: All India Football Federation (AIFF) will soon release a list of 40 footballers who would be declared national players for the 2007-08 season. 

According to AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco, the list would be made public before the inter-club transfer period to enable the clubs to know about players who could possibly be called for national camps during the season. 

There is no bar on clubs in recruiting these players, Colaco said. A club can recruit all these 40 footballers if it desires so. But by listing these players we only want to make it known that the clubs would have to play without these footballers whenever the national team needs them. 

According to AIFF sources, a decision to this effect was taken in the executive committee meeting earlier this month to bring an end to continuous tug of war between the clubs and the federation over release of players for national camps. 

While Mohun Bagan have already written twice to the federation complaining about their key players being taken away on the eve of important matches, other clubs have expressed their resentment over such moves as well. 

We understand the problems of the clubs. So, we have decided to introduce this system, Colaco said. To make things easier for the clubs, we have also drawn up the calendar for the next season with the list of our international commitments and possible camps to this effect. 

Colaco, however, made it clear that these listed footballers wont receive any extra incentive barring the benefits entitled for representing the national team. 

There would also be no restriction on the number of matches these players would be allowed to play in the domestic season. The AIFF also reserves the right of calling up any other footballer outside the elite list for national duty. 

The federation is believed to have already drawn up an initial list of 50 players for this purpose. The final list would only be done after consultation with national coach Bob Houghton and other age-group coaches.

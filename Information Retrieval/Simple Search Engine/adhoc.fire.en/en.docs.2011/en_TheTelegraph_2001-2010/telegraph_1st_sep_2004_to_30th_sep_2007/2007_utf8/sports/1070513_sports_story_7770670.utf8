 Bengal eves lose in final

Rourkela: Manipur came from behind to pip Bengal 2-1 and lift the 15th Senior National Womens football title at the Ispat Stadium here on Saturday. 

Bengal striker Sujata Kar found the net in the second minute. But shots from Manipur striker Bem Bem Devi hit the woodwork twice as their frustration continued. 

Sakhtombi Devi restored parity with just a minute to go for the final whistle. 

NG Bala Devi, who was adjudged the best player of the tournament, headed home the winner in injury time after Chanu crossed again from the left. (PTI)

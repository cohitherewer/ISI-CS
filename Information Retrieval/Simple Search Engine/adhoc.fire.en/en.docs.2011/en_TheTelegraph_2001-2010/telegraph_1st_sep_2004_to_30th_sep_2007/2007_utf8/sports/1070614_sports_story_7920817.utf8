The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Im honoured, happy: Dhoni

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: While Chandu Borde has barely had time to take a break from interviews thrust, after all, into the limelight by a Board which has been fumbling on every issue Mahendra Singh Dhoni has opted to keep a low profile. 

Team Indias newest vice-captain (in the ODIs, that is) remained incommunicado on the day the senior national selectors gave him a promotion. It wasnt much different on the morning-after, Wednes- day. 

Dhoni, however, did send a message to The Telegraph before leaving New Delhi for Bangalore: Im honoured at being made the vice-captain... Im very happy... Im aware of the responsibilities which lie ahead and hope to justify the immense faith shown in me by the selectors... 

The 25-year-old has got the No.2 job even though his idol and senior-most pro Sachin Tendulkar is in the squad. Its an awesome step from the Dilip Vengsarkar-headed selection committee. 

Indeed, at the international level, Dhoni hasnt been around for more than two-and-a-half years. 

Vengsarkar and his colleagues (Venkatapathi Raju, Bhupinder Singh, Sanjay Jagdale and Ranjib Biswal) havent been bound by convention and Dhonis elevation is another example of being able to think boldly. 

As important, the committees agenda has been healthy, much in contrast to what was encouraged by Vengsarkars predecessor Kiran More. 

A feature of Dhonis meteoric rise is that his feet have never left the ground. Its one quality which will surely hold Ranchis favourite son in excellent stead. 

As announced on Tuesday, Dhoni is Rahul Dravids deputy in the next five ODIs one versus Ireland, three against South Africa and one versus Pakistan. 

And, as mentioned in these columns, Dhonis tipped to lead India in the forthcoming Twenty20 World Championship in South Africa.

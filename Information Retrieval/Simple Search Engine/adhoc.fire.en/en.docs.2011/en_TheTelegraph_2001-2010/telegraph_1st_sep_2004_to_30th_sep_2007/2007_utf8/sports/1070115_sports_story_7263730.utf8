The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Insult under scanner

Centurion: South African officials were on Sunday night investigating an incident during the fourth day of the first Test against Pakistan in which an unnamed South African allegedly made an insulting remark, which was heard by television viewers around the world. 

Theyre like animals, was the comment picked up by a stump microphone, which apparently had not been turned off as normally happens soon after a ball has been bowled. 

South African coach Mickey Arthur said the comment had been the subject of complaining e-mails, some from as far afield as Pakistan. He said: the comment was not aimed at any Pakistan player. 

Arthur said the incident was the subject of an internal investigation. A statement would be issued on Monday. He said as far as he was aware it had not become a matter for Match Referee Chris Broad. 

The comment was made shortly before lunch. (AFP)

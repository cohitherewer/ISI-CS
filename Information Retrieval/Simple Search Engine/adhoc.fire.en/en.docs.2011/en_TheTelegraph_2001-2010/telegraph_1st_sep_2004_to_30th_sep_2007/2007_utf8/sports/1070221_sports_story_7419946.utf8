 Harika closes in on maiden GM norm

Moscow: Woman Grandmaster Dronavalli Harika put herself in a strong position to collect her maiden GM norm as she held Sergey Volkov of Russia to a creditable draw in the sixth round of Aeroflot International Chess Tournament here on Tuesday. 

On what turned out to be an average day for the Indians in the A1 section of the festival, Grandmaster and former world junior champion P. Harikrishna turned out to be the only silver lining with his first victory of the event, at the expense of Alexander Ivanov of Russia. 

Harikrishna thus matched compatriots Krishnan Sasikiran, Surya Sekhar Ganguly and Harika in the points table with all having three points apiece with just three rounds to come in the $ 1-million event. 

Ganguly drew with Evgeny Najer of Russia while worlds youngest Grandmaster Parimarjan Negi and S. Vijayalakshmi went down to Emanuel Berg of Sweden and Yuri Drozdovskij of Ukraine, respectively. 

Stanislav Novikov of Russia maintained his slender half point lead over nearest rivals after holding compatriot Dmitry Jakovenko in a marathon game. 

Novikov moved to five points out of a possible six and is now followed by a pack of four including Jakovenko on 4.5 points. 

In the A2 section, Indian hopes suffered a setback as Abhijit Kunte was held to a draw by unheralded Ris Robert of Holland quite easily.

 Federer, Henin named top seeds

 Roger Federer 

Wimbledon: Four-time defending champion Roger Federer was seeded No. 1 for Wimbledon on Wednesday, with Justine Henin getting the top spot for the women. 

Rafael Nadal, last years runner-up, was seeded No. 2 ahead of Andy Roddick. Defending womens champion Amelie Mauresmo was seeded No. 4 in line with her world ranking. 

Wimbledon, the third Grand Slam of the year, begins on Monday. The draw will be held on Friday. 

In determining the seedings, Wimbledon takes past performances on grass into account. The seedings at other Grand Slams mirror the rankings. 

The top 18 women are seeded according to their WTA ranking, with French Open champion Henin seeded No. 1. She will attempt to improve upon her performance as losing finalist in 2001 and 2006. Maria Sharapova, who won the 2004 title at age 17, is seeded No. 2, followed by Jelena Jankovic. Two-time winner and Australian Open champion Serena Williams is No. 7. 

Below the top three men, there were mostly minor movements against the rankings. Fifth-ranked Novak Djokovic was moved up to the No. 4 seeding after winning in Estoril, Miami and Adelaide this year and losing to Nadal in the French Open semi-final. 

Eleventh-ranked Tomas Berdych was seeded No. 7, switching places with Tommy Robredo, while Marcos Baghdatis was the biggest beneficiary of the system. The Cypriot player, who lost to Nadal in straight sets in last years semi-finals, was seeded No. 10, six places above his ATP ranking. 

 Lleyton Hewitt, the 2002 champion, was No. 16, three 

 spots above his ranking.

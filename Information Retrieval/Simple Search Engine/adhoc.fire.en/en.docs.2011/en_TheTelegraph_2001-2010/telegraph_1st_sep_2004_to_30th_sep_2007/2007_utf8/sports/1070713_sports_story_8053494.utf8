 Its not easy to play in the US: Pele

 Pele in New York on Wednesday 

New York: Pele, who helped stir US interest in soccer when he joined the New York Cosmos in the 1970s, said on Wednesday that David Beckham can help promote the game, but had better be prepared to work hard. 

Beckham, the 32-year-old England midfielder who spent the last four seasons at Real Madrid, has generated a huge buzz since signing a lucrative deal to play for Major League Soccers Los Angeles Galaxy, who will formally introduce him on Friday. 

Everybody knows David Beckham is a good player. Hes very well known all over the world and I think he could help soccer in the United States, said Pele, who was promoting the Read Futbol Mundial project that encourages children to read. 

Pele, however, had a word of caution for Beckham, noting the standard of play in the US had grown considerably since his pioneering days in the North American Soccer League. 

But I advise him... it will be very difficult to play because the teams are very good. They mark very well. Be prepared, be in good condition because it is not easy to play in the United States. The football is now at a high level. 

In my time it was a little different. It was more complicated, Pele said. I came here to start (the professional game). The football here was just amateur and college. The football has grown a lot over here. 

I had the opportunity to play with great players (Franz) Beckenbauer, Carlos Alberto, Giorgio Chinaglia, (Johan) Cruyff. This motivated the kids, the people, to come into the game. 

Now Beckham has to continue the work. 

The Brazilian suggested Beckham just might bring the right mix of celebrity and skill to accomplish the mission in the US, whose national team has reached the last five World Cups. 

He is one of the few players in the last 10 years who have most promoted himself and the football, Pele said with a laugh. 

Since he left England for Real Madrid, its always like this. His wife is an entertainer This made Beckham become a showman.

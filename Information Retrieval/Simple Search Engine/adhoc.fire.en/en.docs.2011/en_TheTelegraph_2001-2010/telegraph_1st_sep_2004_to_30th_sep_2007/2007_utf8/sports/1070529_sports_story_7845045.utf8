 Vengsarkar 

Mumbai: Expressing concern over the frequent breakdown of Indian bowlers, national selection panel chief Dilip Vengsarkar on Monday put the onus on the teams physio John Gloster and trainer Gregory King to keep them in good condition. 

Vengsarkar said it was for Gloster and King to find out the reasons for the injuries as the team could ill-afford to lose the services of its strike bowlers after having played only a few games. It is a matter of great concern for all of us. There are a lot of matches to be played during the season and the frequent breakdown of bowlers is definitely not a good sign, the former India captain said, referring to the recent injuries to pace bowlers Sreesanth and Munaf Patel. 

The chief selector hinted that the best possible team would be chosen for the three one-dayers against South Africa in Ireland and the one-off ODI, for Prince Charles Charity Trust, in Scotland against Pakistan. 

I guess we will be selecting separate teams for the one-dayers in Ireland and for the Test matches in England. As far as the seven one-dayers in England and the Twenty20 World Cup are concerned, we will be selecting the team during or just before the last Test match in England, Vengsarkar said. 

Vengsarkar insisted that a third opener would be by makeshift Test opener Dinesh Karthik over the last few tours. Dinesh has the potential and the attitude to succeed at the highest level. He has showed it in South Africa as well as in Bangladesh, he said. 

Vengsarkar felt five pacers would be needed for the England tour and was pleased with the performance of Rudra Pratap Singh and Ishant Sharma. (PTI)

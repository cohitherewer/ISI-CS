 Madanlal is keen, but wont approach

New Delhi: Former allrounder Madanlal on Tuesday threw his hat in the fray, saying he is ready for a second stint as the Team India coach even though Dav Whatmore seems to have already pocketed the job. 

I would definitely love to coach India if I am offered the job. I have done it in the past and would love to have another go at it, said Madanlal. 

Madanlal, who coached India from 1996-97, admitted Whatmore had emerged the front-runner in the race for the job. 

It seems the Board has already decided on the issue, he observed. 

Madanlal, however, insisted that he would not approach the Board with his candidature. 

I am not going to approach the Board. In fact, I dont have any idea how to go about it. So if they come with the offer, I would definitely extend my service, said Madanlal. 

Madanlal, however, refused to be dragged into the Indian versus foreigner debate and said the job should go to the right person. 

He also felt that even if Whatmore gets the nod, its not going to be a bed of roses for the coach. 

He has worked with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh and had some success with both the sides. But coaching India would be a different ball altogether. You have to deal with a different system here. Handling star players and living up to the expectation of Indias highly emotional fans would be a daunting task. 

Agreed that he has earned his stripes as a coach in the sub-continent. But whether the experience would prove an advantage you have to wait and see, he added. (PTI)

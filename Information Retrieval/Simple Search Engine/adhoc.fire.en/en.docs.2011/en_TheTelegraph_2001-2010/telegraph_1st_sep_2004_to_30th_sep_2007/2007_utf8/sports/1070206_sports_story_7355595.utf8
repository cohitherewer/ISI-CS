 No regrets, says Tewari 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai: Bengal middle-order batsman Manoj Tewari didnt regret after getting out to an adventurous shot on 94. 

Theres no regret That ball (off Abhishek Nair) was there to hit and I didnt do anything wrong slashing it through the point Just couldnt keep it along the ground, Tewari said after Bengal lost the Ranji Trophy final by 132 runs. 

Captain Deep Dasgupta also defended the batsman. He is a stroke player and you cant change him to curb his shots, Deep said, adding that on his day, Manoj can destroy any bowling attack. 

More than the batting collapse on the penultimate day, Deep pointed out that the first-innings debacle had more serious impact on their prospects.

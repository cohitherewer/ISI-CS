Georgetown: Mohammed Ashraful cracked a stylish 87 from 83 balls to help Bangladesh post their highest World Cup total of 251 for eight in the Super Eight match against South Africa on Saturday. 

South Africa were struggling at 152 for eight after 43 overs with Herschelle Gibbs batting on 42 and Charl Langeveldt on 5. For Bangladesh, Syed Rasel and Saqibul Hasan bagged two wickets each. 

Bangladesh, without a win in the Super Eight unlike world No.1-ranked South Africa, who are seeking a third straight victory, fought back after being 84 for four. 

Ashraful scored 12 fours in an exciting and often improvised knock which gave his side a serious target to defend following a late-innings flurry. 

Pacer Andre Nel marked his first match in three weeks with career-best figures of five for 45 after Bangladesh, put in to bat, had blunted the threat of opening pair Shaun Pollock and Makhaya Ntini. 

Nel first dismissed Javed Omar (17) as he square cut straight to Graeme Smith at backward point. Bangladesh then slumped to 59 for two when captain Habibul Bashar was caught and bowled for five. Two balls later, in his next over, he secured an edge to the wicketkeeper from impetuous but exciting opener Tamim Iqbal, who made 38. 

Aftab Ahmed came in and attacked anything wayward, striking Justin Kemp for two sixes in three balls in the 36th over. The first was a flick over square leg and then a drive over long-on. He was eventually run out for 35. 

Ashraful, aged 22, continued the charge, reaching his half-century with a lofted drive for four off Ntini. Next ball he played a bizarre leg glance for another four after stepping a yard outside off stump. 

He completed an expensive 44th over by cutting Ntini for a third boundary, as 15 came off it.

 BCCIs double standards in dealing with agents

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: For the past week, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has repeatedly said it wont entertain players agents on the endorsements issue. 

On the face of it, the BCCI cant be faulted. However, it courts the same agents for sponsoring tournaments! 

Its no secret, for example, that the BCCI sold the rights for last Aprils two-match series against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi to Percept, the agency which handles the accounts of Sourav Ganguly, Yuvraj Singh and Sreesanth. 

Percept then roped in DLF as sponsor. 

Five months later, after two failed tenders, Percept came to the BCCIs rescue and got a sponsor DLF again for the (off-shore) tri-series in Kuala Lumpur. 

If the BCCI actually has such strong reservations, then it shouldnt be dealing with agents at all. It has exposed itself to the charge of following double standards. 

Its absurd that Im perfectly acceptable when I wear one hat and become a pariah when I wear a different one The BCCI must stop being whimsical, somebody associated with the trade told The Telegraph. 

Its a reasonable call. 

The players, meanwhile, arent just upset with the cap on endorsements the BCCI, though, has announced it will be reviewed but with the stipulation that they cant feature in sponsor related events 15 days before any tour. 

Team Indias calender in the immediate future is such that there may not be 15-day breaks between commitments. 

An example: The tour of Ireland and England ends on September 8 and the Twenty20 World Cup (in South Africa) gets underway a mere three days later. 

Besides restrictions on players (maximum of three endorsements), the BCCI has ruled that no sponsor can contract more than three players. 

The sponsors have to work through the agents. 

Captain Rahul Dravid has already called for a dialogue with the BCCI, but the impression one gets is that everybody is buying time. 

Abhi shanti hai Let everything remain quiet, remarked a senior BCCI office-bearer. 

He may want shanti, but is it the proverbial lull before the storm? 

If the players need to get their act right on the field, the administrators have to really buck up off it. 

Quickly too.

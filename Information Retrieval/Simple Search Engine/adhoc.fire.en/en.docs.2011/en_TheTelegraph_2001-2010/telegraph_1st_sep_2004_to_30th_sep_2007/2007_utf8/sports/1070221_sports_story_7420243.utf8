The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Contracts after Cup

 - Agreement almost finalised

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the players have more or less reached an agreement on the long-awaited contracts issue at a meeting in Mumbai on Tuesday. The contracts will be finalised and implemented after the World Cup. 

While Team India captain Rahul Dravid was present at the meeting on behalf of the players, the BCCI was represented by secretary Niranjan Shah, former president Inderjit Singh Bindra and chief administrative officer Prof. Ratnakar Shetty. Vice-president Lalit Modi was also present for a while. 

Dravid needs to discuss a few points with the players. The BCCI, too, will discuss some points with the members of the contracts co mmittee before giving its seal of approval. Since there is very little time left to finalise details before the teams departure for the West Indies, both sides agreed to do it after the World Cup. 

One understands that Modi, a member of the marketing committee, was present for some time as the BCCI wanted to make a few changes with regard to players earnings from TV rights. 

After a meeting between the BCCI officials and Dravid this morning, it was mutually agreed that the players contract would be implemented after the return of the team from the World Cup. At the meeting, the draft agreement was discussed in detail and the views exchanged between the BCCI and players, said Shah in a release. 

The contracts will have retrospective effect from October 1, 2006.

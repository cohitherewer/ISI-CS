 Foreign element in Woolmers system

Kingston: The toxicology report of Bob Woolmer have reportedly shown presence of a foreign chemical substance in his system. 

A foreign chemical substance has been discovered in Bob Woolmers blood and tissue samples, the toxicology results have reportedly stated, according to a newspaper report. 

According to a well-placed government official, the substance, believed to be poison, was found in samples taken from the coachs stomach, urine and blood, a Jamaican daily reported. 

Deputy commissioner of police, Mark Shields, had confirmed on Saturday the receipt of the toxicology report, but refused to comment on the contents. 

The police said they would be relying on histology and toxicology analysis of Woolmers tissue samples to give them an idea of the events leading to the coachs death. 

The histology is back. I have not seen it, but it is the toxicology that we are still working on... The toxicology is much more important, assistant commissioner of police, Les Green, said. 

The report also said that help has been sought from Scotland Yard in the analysis of the results. 

Histology results will help the pathologist to arrive at a time of death, which has not yet been established, while the toxicology will justify or rebut speculations that Woolmer was poisoned before being strangled. 

Meanwhile, some members of the Pakistan team may be asked to make their way back to Jamaica for the coroners inquest which begins on Monday. 

Green said coroner Patrick Murphy had made it clear that he wanted members of that delegation back for the inquest. 

Kent Pantry, director of public prosecutions, who will attend the inquest with two of his officers, has ruled out suggestions that some witnesses could give their testimony via video link. 

CCTV footage from the hotel has been completed in London and Shields said the results were excellent. 

I now have some of the results, which are excellent and give us a clearer picture of peoples movements within the Pegasus Hotel and elsewhere, Shields said.

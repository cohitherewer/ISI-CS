 Sheringham ready to face son

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

Teddy Sheringham is willing to show his age playing for Colchester this season by eyeing up a potential game in the Championship against his son Charlie. 

The former England international has joined Colchester United on a free transfer from West Ham, while his 19-year-old son, Charlie, is on the books of Championship rivals Crystal Palace. 

Hopefully I will play against Charlie, Sheringham said. He has to break into his team and I have to break into mine, but it would be very nice. If we did play against each other, I cant say who would kick who first. Hopefully we would be at other ends of the pitch because we are both strikers. 

Having only started four games for West Ham last term, Sheringham was upset at how his time at Upton Park ended under manager Alan Curbishley. 

The former Tottenham and Manchester United player said: Yes, I felt undervalued. They did their job, they got out of trouble. But I have had a lot of managers who have liked the way I play football, but some just dont. 

Geraint Williams (the Colchester manager) likes the way I play and to me, at this stage in my career, thats all that counts. I had one or two other offers, but this is not a comedown for me at all. I know exactly what to expect because I started [with Millwall] at this level.

 Sleuths to accompany Woolmer body 

 Bob Woolmer

Kingston: The body of Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer was set to be flown to South Africa on Thursday. A casket containing Woolmers body will be returned to his family home in a Cape Town suburb. 

Jamaican investigators will accompany the body and hope to gather information from relatives there to help identify any suspect, police said. 

Woolmer, 58, was murdered on March 18 shortly after Pakistan were eliminated from the World Cup following a shock defeat by Ireland. 

He was found unconscious in his hotel room and pronounced dead at a hospital. Police said he was strangled in a crime still shrouded in mystery. 

Senior investigator Mark Shields, Jamaicas deputy police commissioner, has said he plans to fly to South Africa in the first week of May to meet Woolmers widow, Gillian. 

It is critical for us that we speak to Gillian Woolmer in order to be better placed to solve the case, Shields told a local radio station recently. 

Media reports have said Woolmer, a former England player, was poisoned and later strangled but the police have not confirmed that a toxic substance was used in the murder. 

A pathologist who conducted Woolmers autopsy initially ruled that his cause of death was inconclusive but four days later determined he had been strangled. 

His body had been kept in Jamaica pending a coroners investigation. But an inquest into his death was postponed indefinitely because of recent and significant developments in the case, the Jamaican government said last week. 

Jamaicas Justice Ministry did not give details on the developments that led to the interruption of the inquest. 

The postponement came days after police announced they had received toxicology test results but decided not to release them pending further analysis. 

A British newspaper also said that Jamaican police has identified a male suspect from CCTV footage analysis but police have refused to comment on the claims.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Prasun praises his team

 - Proposal for a Twenty20 match was under consideration, says CAB chief 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Even as there was disappointment over the rain-induced abandonment, CAB president Prasun Mukherjee praised the efforts put in by his team in making the match possible at such a short notice. 

Were all unhappy. We tried our level best, but the ground conditions werent conducive. A lot of hard work had gone into the preparation of the match Everyone was impressed that we made it possible in only 12 days. We worked as a team and the match had brought us all together, Mukherjee said. 

Mukherjee informed that at one stage there was also a proposal to play a Twenty20 match. The umpires were even willing to extend playing time by one hour to 11.15 pm. But the ground conditions werent conducive With the World Cup so near, it wont be proper to put the players at risk of injury, he pointed out. 

Asked whether the CAB should have pressed into service a second super sopper which was away at the Jadavpur University campus ground at Salt Lake, Mukherjee said: I have taken over only a week back. I know things can be improved. But time was too short. 

The players had left the field even as the final inspection was underway. Well, they are not fools. They are experienced players. Discussions were going on in between. They knew that the match was not possible. It just proved that the umpires tried to get the match underway till the end, Mukherjee remarked. 

Mukherjee also informed that the players, too, praised the arrangements and the crowd. It was faultless. The crowd was also very appreciative. It was great to see the full house. Pity, the weather gods thought otherwise.

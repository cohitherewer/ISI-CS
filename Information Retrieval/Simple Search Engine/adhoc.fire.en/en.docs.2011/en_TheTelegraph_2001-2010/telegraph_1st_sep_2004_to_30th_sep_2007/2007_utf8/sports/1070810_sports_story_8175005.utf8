 Rahul Dravid gets things done quietly: Gatting

 - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 

 Ashes-winning captain on leadership 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

London: An Ashes-winning captain (1986-87, in Australia), Mike Gatting knows a few things about being at the helm. On Thursday, Gatting (now 50) spoke to The Telegraph on captaincy and also shared his thoughts on the ones currently leading the top eight Test-playing nations. 

The following are excerpts 

On the qualities a captain should possess 

No. 1 is the ability to understand players and to understand their needs... He has to get their respect and, obviously, has to be strong on tactics... 

On judging captains 

It has to be done on two counts: The tactics he employs and the manner in which players execute them. Largely, youre a good captain if you have a good team... No captain can perform either for his bowlers or his batters... Theyve got to take responsibility and do their job... Of course, the element of luck is there as well. At the end of the day, captains are judged by results. 

On his style of captaincy 

I didnt run a one-man show, but its not that I captained by committee either... I was a captain who solicited ideas... On the field, I could seek the views of anybody from among the ten teammates Id made it clear that if somebody had an idea, he was welcome to bring it up... That I didnt have a problem chatting about something which emanated from some other quarter... (After a pause) I inculcated a bit of stubbornness... That one had to fight it out in demanding situations... 

On whether he read the Riot Act 

(Laughs) At times... Its not a tactic to employ all the time... The better way is having one-on-ones. 

On having worked with the one and only Mike Brearley both in the England team and at Middlesex 

It was a wonderful apprenticeship... Learnt about the game, about tactics... Dealing with people... Helped enormously... Helped me grow as a captain... 

On Brearley 

As captain, he relied on instincts... Hed say that if you sensed something could happen, go ahead and make that move... He wasnt the one to pass the buck... One afternoon during one of my earliest games for Middlesex, Brearley asked Mike, what do you think we should be doing? That took me by surprise... The England and Middlesex captain wanting my views... Left me embarrassed too as I hadnt really been thinking about the game... It was a wake-up call... Brearley, I think, realised Id been slipping in the field... Thats why the question... I became more focused, more involved... In getting players to respond, Brearley was brilliant. 

On whether captains have a shelf life 

Its probably determined by form... Some people did ask whether Brearley was worth his place as a batsman, well, the players wouldve said they wanted him as the captain... I suppose things are slightly more political in India... Theres always another side to the story, isnt it? 

On the present-day captains (alphabetically) of the top eight Test-playing nations 

RAHUL DRAVID (India): I think he tries to work with his players... Dont think hes hesitant to take advice... And, because Dravids such a fine batsman, hes respected in the dressing room. He gets things done quietly, while Sourav Ganguly had the Ill do things my way image... 

STEPHEN FLEMING (New Zealand): Leads from the front... Hes a forthright captain... Hes an honest captain... He lets the players know whats expected of them and I dont think theres any New Zealand player who doesnt know whats expected of him. What I like about Fleming is that hes quietly assertive. 

MAHELA JAYAWARDENE (Sri Lanka): Hes a calm man, is good with his team... He understands whats going on and seems happy to talk to mates like (Kumar) Sangakkara... From what Ive made out, Jayawardene is happy to accept advice... Hes tough when he needs to be tough... Hes fortunate to have two very good strike bowlers Muttiah Muralidharan and Lasith Malinga... 

SHOAIB MALIK (Pakistan): Havent seen him captain, but hes landed arguably the most difficult job in cricket... His advantage is that hes got talented cricketers around him... The captain and coach need to work together very closely and Im sure Malik and Geoff Lawson are going to have a good partnership. Pakistan have to rebuild. 

RICKY PONTING (Australia): At times, Ive found him to be an arrogant captain... Like the other Australian captains in the last 15 years or so, hes been lucky to have had good players at his disposal... He leads from the front and that makes captaincy easier... That he has had such quality players has enabled him to concentrate on his own game... Pontings real test will be now when theres no Shane Warne and no Glenn McGrath... His handling of the bowling resources is going to be watched with interest. 

RAMNARESH SARWAN (West Indies): Frankly, I dont think hes got enough drive... Is pretty laidback... Some teams, like the West Indies, need strong leaders... Given the way (Chris) Gayle led in the recent ODIs, the West Indies selectors could look at him as captain... He has the spunk... Has the energy... Clearly, some players need to be given more responsibility. 

GRAEME SMITH (South Africa): Hes been captain for a long time (over four years)... A captain needs ammunition and while he has had good seam bowlers, he hasnt had quality spinners... He can improve... 

MICHAEL VAUGHAN (England): Hes quite like Dravid... Is respected in the dressing room and understands his players very well... The message he sends out is be calm and stay relaxed... I dont think he puts his players under pressure (in tight situations)... Michael has nice merchandise to work with, particularly with Monty Panesar coming so good. 

Finally, his message to young captains 

Keep your ears and eyes open... If good advice is to be had, listen.

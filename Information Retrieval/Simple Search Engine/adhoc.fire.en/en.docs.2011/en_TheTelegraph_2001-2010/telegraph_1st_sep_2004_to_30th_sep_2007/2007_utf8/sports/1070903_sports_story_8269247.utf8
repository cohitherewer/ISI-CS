 Kapil in China

Beijing: Former India captain Kapil Dev has advised the Chinese government to promote cricket in schools to popularise the game. 

My recommendation is that they should start from middle school if they want to develop cricket in the country, Kapil said. 

We are here (in China) to see for ourselves and explore the possibilities of a tie-up, he said.

Boston: Brazil struck twice inside the last 10 minutes to record a come-from-behind 3-1 win over Mexico in a lively friendly on Wednesday. Mexico went ahead in the 43rd minute with Juan Carlos Cachos first goal for his country, only for Brazil to draw level two minutes later through Klebers first strike in national colours. 

Mexico keeper Guillermo Ochoa produced a series of saves to keep his side level, but Kaka put the Brazilians 2-1 up in the 80th minute. Despite being down to 10 men following the dismissal of Elano, Brazil substitute Afonso added a third goal four minutes from time to complete a successful pair of friendlies after their 4-2 victory over the United States on Sunday. 

Brazil, who had coach Dunga sent off in the final stages after arguing with the fourth official, begin their World Cup qualification campaign away to Colombia on October 13. 

Mexico keeper Ochoa twice saved his side early on through his speed off the line in the ninth minute he was out quickly at the feet of a goal-bound Vagner Love and then was sharp and brave again to deny Kaka. 

Brazil keeper Julio Cesar showed similar speed of reaction when Cacho fed Fernando Arce but the custodian was out quickly at the feet of the Mexico forward to keep the scores level. 

Mexico took the lead through a superbly worked goal Andres Guardado crossing low to Nery Castillo, who showed great control and alertness to set up Cacho to slot home. 

But five-time World Cup winners Brazil drew level just two minutes later when Kleber met a Ronaldinho corner at the near post and his shot beat the diving Ochoa. (Reuters)

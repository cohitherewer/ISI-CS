 Copter crash kills three

Nevera: A helicopter carrying people involved with the French Grand Prix crashed in central France on Saturday night, killing three and seriously injuring two. 

The rented helicopter was ferrying people from the Magny-Cours racetrack to their hotel when it crashed shortly after 10 pm (local time) Saturday in the Raveau forest near Chariti-Sur-Loire, police said. 

The injured were taken to a nearby hospital and an investigation opened. 

Police have not disclosed the names of those killed or injured in the crash. 

However, Bridgestone, the Japanese tyre makers who supply all the Formula One teams, said in a statement on Sunday that one of their employees and a relative had survived the accident. 

Circuit chief medical officer Alain Chantegret said the helicopter had left Magny-Cours for Castel Donzy at around 19.15 (local time) but crashed before reaching the destination. 

He said the injured passengers were receiving medical attention. (AGENCIES)

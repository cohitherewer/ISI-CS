The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Shukla to decide today

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Laxmi Ratan Shukla will give his final word on Friday. 

In a dilemma over whether to join the Indian Cricket League or remain with the CAB, the Bengal allrounder said he would decide about this on Friday. Ill let you know about my decision tomorrow, Shukla said on the sidelines of a function. 

Shukla having second thoughts about joining ICL came to the fore on Thursday after the CAB claimed that the Howrah boy would continue representing Bengal this season. 

The buzz in the Maidan is that Shukla has been lured to stay with the captaincy offer. 

Shukla, it may be recalled, had lamented not given the chance to lead Bengal in Deep Dasguptas absence. 

The ICL on Monday unveiled a pool of 44 Indian recruits with seven Bengal cricketers. 

Shukla, who was present during the parade of the players, did not sign on the dotted line. He has objected to a few clauses in the contract, according to sources. 

Having seen the ICL contract, Shukla apparently had a change of mind. Shukla, it seemed, told one of his close confidantes that he was not getting the payment offered by the ICL.

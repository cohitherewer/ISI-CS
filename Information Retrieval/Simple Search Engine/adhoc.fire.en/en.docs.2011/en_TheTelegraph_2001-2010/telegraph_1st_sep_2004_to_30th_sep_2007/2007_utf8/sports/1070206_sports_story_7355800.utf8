 Uthappa oozes confidence

Bangalore: Two blazing knocks in the home series against the West Indies may have catapulted Robin Uthappa into serious contention for a World Cup berth, but the Karnataka opener says its only the beginning and he has more to offer. 

Uthappa says he worked hard on his batting last year and there was a lot more to his game than what people have witnessed. 

I think you need to wait and watch how I play and deliver. Ive just played two games after coming back into the side. There is a lot more to my game than what people have just seen. God willing it will all go according to plan, Uthappa said on Monday. 

The 21-year-old, who gave ample display of his stroke-making ability in two matches against the visiting West Indies, is now looking forward to the two matches against Sri Lanka to cement a place in the 15-member World Cup squad. 

Although the squad would be announced after these two matches, Uthappa wants to take one game at a time and not worry much about the future. 

I think its important to just worry about the present. When you think ahead too much you invite unnecessary pressure. Im just thinking of the next two games against Sri Lanka, he said. The Coorgi is in the list of 30 and will have to wait till February 12 to know whether he would board the plane to the West Indies.

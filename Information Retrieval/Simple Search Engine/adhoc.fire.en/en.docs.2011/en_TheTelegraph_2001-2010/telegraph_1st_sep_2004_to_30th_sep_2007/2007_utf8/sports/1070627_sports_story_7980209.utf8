 British football finally has a friend and a fan in power

HENRY WINTER

 Gordon Brown 

The men of the moment, Gordon Brown and Thierry Henry, met at a charity function recently. The Scottish politician and French attacker share much in common. Both are famed for starting on the left, and then shifting into the centre. Both have just made moves that have made front-page news. 

A few nights after encountering Henry, Brown was chatting to a gaggle of football hacks at Downing Street, wanting to know more about the inspiring Frenchman, and particularly whether he would leave Arsenal. 

Brown was genuinely interested, chipping in with intelligent questions and observations about these transfers, whether completed or mooted. Yet with respect to Henry, Nani, Bale and Torres, the summer move with the most significance to the Premiership is Browns from No.11 to No.10. British football finally has a friend, and a fan, in power. 

He certainly knows his football, possibly a first for a Prime Minister. He talked passionately about boyhood idols like Slim Jim Baxter, as well as about his beloved Raith Rovers. 

Three things were immediately clear about the new PM. Firstly, Brown is far more convincing talking to small groups than holding the attention of a large gathering. Secondly, he has that old Liverpool Boot Room trick of listening intently, searching for nuggets of information which can help him. 

Thirdly, and most encouragingly, Brown seems to be assisted by advisors who are all football nuts, an assortment of fans from West Ham United to Liverpool. One Upton Park regular got very prickly when the Carlos Tevez affair was broached. Another laughed at the Brown-Henry left-to-centre analogy. 

As well as the whos buying who chit-chat at No.11 that night, conversation also touched on three of the issues bedevilling the Premiership: financial irregularities in transfer dealings, foreign ownership of clubs, and technical deficiencies of youngsters. 

The new regime in Downing Street has already indicated that government will take heightened interest in the first two matters, in the wake of the Stevens Inquiry and now the controversy-riddled take-over of Manchester City by former Thailand Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. 

The most pressing concern for those who want to see England end 41 years of hurt is the need to develop better players. 

A handful emerged from the recent U-21 tournament in Holland, prospects like Scott Carson, Steven Taylor, Nedum Onuoha, Mark Noble, and Leroy Lita, yet their technique was significantly inferior to the Dutch side who defeated them in the semi-final and then gave the Serbs a deserved whacking in the final. 

By providing all schools and grassroots clubs with more (and better) coaches, the new PM would take a massive stride towards lowering obesity levels and raising technical standards. 

Brown talks a good game; now he has to deliver for football, nurturing British versions of Thierry Henry.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Hes getting up too soon

 - Farokh-Dhoni 2nd session 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Engineer 

Calcutta: Farokh Engineer, one of the first glamour boys of Indian cricket, has had another wicketkeeping-specific session with the current pin-up hero Mahendra Singh Dhoni. 

We tried to keep it a quiet affair I didnt want TV cameramen and photographers around It wasnt for publicity, Engineer told The Telegraph on Wednesday evening. 

Speaking from his Cheshire residence, he added: Our interaction took place at Old Trafford in the afternoon On the field and, later, in the dressing room when I was invited to share home-cooked biryani brought by one of the fans. 

Engineer, who wore the big gloves for India in the Sixties and Seventies, had a few words with Team Indias No.2 keeper Dinesh Karthik as well. 

His first one-on-one with Dhoni had been in Chelmsford, in the lead-up to the three-Test series which preceded the ongoing ODIs. 

Dhoni has improved from the time he landed in England, but still needs to work on a few things Hes getting up too soon and is often snatching the ball One of the basics is that you stay as low for as long as possible 

Of course, its not that Dhoni isnt aware of what needs to be done. Moreover, hes such a sincere cricketer He adds so much value as a batsman that youve got to have him in the XI, Engineer said. 

Now senior vice-president of the Lancashire County Cricket Club (the first Indian in that position), Engineer is praying that Rahul Dravid and Co. make it 2-2 on his adopted home ground. 

Look bhai, if we win the toss, we should bat first I dont understand this business of giving England first strike As important, weve got to improve our fielding And do so appreciably. 

Engineer added: Fielding is one aspect of the game which has definitely changed for the better from my time. However, when I see this team, I cant but make the point that there were better fielders in my days Tiger Pataudi, (Ajit) Wadekar, Abid Ali and (the late Eknath) Solkar to name just a few 

Ironically, the present bunch hasnt shown any improvement even though Robin Singh has been the fielding coach for four months.

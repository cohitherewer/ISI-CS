 Shock exit for Hewitt

 Rainer Schuettler in action against Lleyton Hewitt in Mumbai on Friday. Schuettler won 6-3, 7-5 

Mumbai: Former world No. 1 and second seed Lleyton Hewitt was bundled out of the $416,000 Kingfisher Airlines Open by unseeded Rainer Schuettler on Friday night. 

The 26-year-old two-time Grand Slam winner, ranked No. 21 in the world, struggled through the 96-minute match to eventually lose 3-6, 5-7 in the quarter final. 

Schuettler will take on eighth seed Olivier Rochus (Belgium), who booked his place in the last four when German wild card Nicholas Kiefer retired due to a bout of gastro-enteritis. The Belgian was 4-1 in the first set at that stage. 

Kiefer had on Thursday withdrawn from doubles in which he had teamed up with Schuettler. 

I was feeling tired today and decided that I had nothing to lose so I decided to take my chances and go for broke. It worked well, the 31-year-old Schuettler said after scalping Hewitt. 

Schuettler fired winners at will off both flanks and caught Hewitt napping whenever the latter tried coming to the net in the battle of baseliners. He also returned well to neutralise Hewitts powerful serve, which didnt quite click (the Aussie served six double-faults). 

Hewitt had two set-points when Schuettler was serving at 2-5 in set 2, but couldnt take either. The strapping five-foot-11 German was allowed to claw way back into a winning position. 

After playing four sets yesterday (and two matches) I felt a bit flat today. He (Schuettler) played some great tennis, I didnt. I struggled on my serve and he returned very well which is his strength, Hewitt said. 

In another upset, the 34-year-old Fabrice Santoro, seeded fifth, shocked No. 4 Jarkko Nieminen 6-3, 6-4 in an hour and 21 minutes. It was the third time the Frenchman triumphed the Finn in as many meetings. 

Santoro will meet top seed Richard Gasquet in an all-French semi-final. Gasquet, the 21-year-old world No. 14, demolished last years semi-finalist and sixth seed Stefan Koubek (Austria) 6-2, 6-4. 

Were great friends and we practise together quite a lot and we will again practise tomorrow (Saturday) before the match. I respect him but hes not my idol. He has a special game and you have to be careful when you play against him, Gasquet said.

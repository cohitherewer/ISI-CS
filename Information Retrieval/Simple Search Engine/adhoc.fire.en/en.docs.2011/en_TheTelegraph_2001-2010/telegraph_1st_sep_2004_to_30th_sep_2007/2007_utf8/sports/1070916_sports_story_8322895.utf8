 United plan for India

JAYDEEP BASU

Ludhiana: Every week football fans in India wake up to late night alarms to catch up on some fascinating overseas action on television, especially the magic of Manchester United, renowned for spectacular and technically perfect football. 

Soon, budding footballers in India would get chance to learn the game the Manchester United way. 

According to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources, India is the latest addition to world territories hosting Manchester United Soccer Schools (MUSS), whose programme has produced stars like David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Wes Brown, John Shea and Darren Fletcher. 

The sources also said that Manchester United, in all probability, are planning a football academy in India with the MUSS programme testing the waters. 

Manchester Uniteds first stop in India will be Goa next month, before the English football giants move over to Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai. 

A high-profile 17-member Manchester United delegation, including Head of Operations Dale Hobson, Steve Jones, Ian McDonald, Nick Webborn, a coach educator and five coaches, will arrive in Goa on October 19 to conduct the fortnight long programme between October 21 and November 4 at the Nehru Stadium. 

A total of 5,000 players aged between eight and 15 will be covered under the programme all over the country that will be monitored by some MU officials, said an AIFF official. At present, 1,500 students have been called for the Goa programme. 

Indian football would receive a huge boost when talented youngsters take lessons from the likes of Manchester Uniteds former greats like Eric Cantona, Roy Keane and Bobby Charlton, all of whom are associated with the MUSS programme. 

MUSS have developed a programme which is focused on all the positive aspects of the game; it is exciting, challenging and great fun, Manchester United coach Alex Fergusson had been quoted recently. 

The coaching programme that will be implemented in India has been adopted from the Manchester Uniteds Youth Academy manual. 

According to AIFF sources, the deal has been brokered by International Management Group, which conducts Manchesters pre-season tours to Asia.

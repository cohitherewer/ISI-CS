 Disappointed Razzaq quits

 Abdul Razzaq 

Karachi: Miffed with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), for dropping him from the Pakistan squad for the forthcoming ICC World Twenty20 tournament, all-rounder Abdul Razzaq on Monday, has quit international cricket in protest. 

I have decided to retire because I am hurt and disappointed at the way the authorities have treated me for the last few weeks, Razzaq said. 

Razzaq, who has played in 231 one-day Internationals and 46 Tests for Pakistan, was omitted from the Pakistan Twenty20 World Cup squad earlier this month. 

I was very disappointed at being dropped. A senior player expects to be treated with respect and I thought someone would call me up and take me into confidence why they dropped me. But no one bothered to call me up. I think I deserved a call from the PCB, Razzaq said. 

The all-rounder along with former skipper Inzamam-ul Haq, Mohammed Yousuf, Imran Farhat and Azhar Mahmood has reportedly signed up to play in the Indian Cricket League (ICL). 

No PCB official was available for immediate comments. 

Meanwhile, discarded Test opener Imran Farhat has become the first Pakistani player to sign up for the ICL series. 

Yes I have formally signed a contract with the organisers of the Indian league but I would still love to play for my country, the 25-year-old Farhat said on Monday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Flop in Calcutta, a hit in Goa

 Odafa Okoli 

Nigerian striker Odafa Okoli emerged top scorer in the NFL with 18 goals. He scored two in the last match against Air India to overtake Ranty Martins of Dempo, who had 16. 

Like Edeh Chidi, Odafa joined Mohammedan Sporting when he first came to India. 

His talent didnt flourish in the eastern metropolis club as he scored only one goal for the black-and-white brigade. 

He then joined Peerless, flopping again before joining Bangladeshs Muktijodhdha Club. 

 A good dribbler of the ball and a graceful footballer, Odafa now is the most sought after player on the inter-state transfer market. 

So much so, that he might even pip Sunil Chhetri (JCT) to the NFLs best player award. An opportunist and a good finisher, Odafas only problem is that he needs constant guidance during the match, something he received plenty of from Churchill coach Benchrifa.

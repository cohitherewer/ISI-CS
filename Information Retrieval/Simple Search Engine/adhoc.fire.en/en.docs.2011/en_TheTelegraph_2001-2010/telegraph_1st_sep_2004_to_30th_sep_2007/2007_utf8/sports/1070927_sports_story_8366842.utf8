 CRICKET BRIEFS 

 Virus bugs England players

 London: England rsquo;s build-up to their ODI series in Sri Lanka has been hit by a stomach virus sweeping through the squad.

 Captain Paul Collingwood, fast bowler Stuart Broad, Luke Wright and Alastair Cook have all been hit by the bug and are doubtful for England rsquo;s only warm-up match in Colombo against a Sri Lanka President rsquo;s XI on Friday.

 ldquo;A few of the lads have gone down with some sort of stomach illness, rdquo; coach Peter Moores said on the ECB website.

 Pak selectors in a fix

 Karachi: In a fix over the availability of Inzamam-ul Haq, Mohammed Yousuf and Shoaib Akhtar for the first Test against South Africa, Pakistan rsquo;s national selectors have assembled in Lahore to seek clarification before announcing team for the match starting Monday.

 Prolific batsman Yousuf and former captain Inzamam have joined the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL).

 One-dayer abandoned

 Ahmedabad: The first one-dayer between India A and South Africa A was abandoned because of a soggy outfield caused by heavy rainfall during the past few days. The umpires inspected the ground at 10.30 am and decided to call off play then only.

 Pak inspection

 Jaipur: A two-member security delegation from Pakistan inspected the Sawai Man Singh Stadium which will host the India-Pakistan ODI on November 18. The delegation expressed satisfaction with the facilities. (Agencies)

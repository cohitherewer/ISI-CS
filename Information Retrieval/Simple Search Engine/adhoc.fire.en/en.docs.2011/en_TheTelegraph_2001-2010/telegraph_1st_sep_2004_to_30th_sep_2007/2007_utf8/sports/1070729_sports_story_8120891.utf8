 Champion boxer dead

London: James Oyebola, a former British heavyweight boxing champion who was shot in the head at a London nightclub this week, died after his life support system was turned off, police said. 

The Nigerian-born sportsmans family and friends had gathered at his bedside to pay their last respects on Friday. He was 46. 

Oyebola, a Commonwealth Games medal winner, had been at Londons New Charing Cross Hospital since the close-range attack in the early hours of Monday morning which followed a dispute over smoking.

Stuttgart: World number two Rafael Nadal survived an injury scare to make the quarter finals at Stuttgarts ATP tournament with a straight sets win over local hero Philipp Kohlschreiber. 

Nadal, the tournament favourite, had to be treated for a knee injury early in his 6-3, 6-3 win over the German and admitted he was worried whether he could play on and stay on course for his sixth ATP tournament win of the year. 

The Spaniard said it was a similar pain to the one he suffered in the final at Wimbledon this month, where he was beaten over five sets by Roger Federer. 

It was the same as in the Wimbledon final, I had a piercing pain in the knee and when it started, I really began to doubt if I could play on, said Nadal, who needed one hour and 40 minutes to record his 90th win in 91 claycourt matches. (AFP)

 Federer draws Gabashvili

 - Mauresmo to begin title defence vs Jackson 

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES

Roger Federer will begin his quest for a record-equalling fifth consecutive Wimbledon title against Russian Teimuraz Gabashvili, the world No. 85. 

The draw for the grasscourt Grand Slam, which starts on Monday, also paired Spanish second seed Rafael Nadal against American Mardy Fish. Third seed Andy Roddick, who landed in the same half of the draw as Federer, faces an all-American encounter against Justin Gimelstob. 

Top seed Justine Henin will begin her campaign to win the one Major that has eluded her against Argentine qualifier Jorgelina Cravero. 

Second seed Maria Sharapova has been drawn against Chinas Yung-Jan Chan, while No. 7 seed Serena Williams faces Lourdes Dominguez Lino of Spain. 

Amelie Mauresmo will begin the defence of her title on Tuesday against American Jamea Jackson. Mauresmo and Henin could meet in the final again, as they did last year. 

British No. 1 Andy Murray will face Ecuadors Nicolas Lapentti if he recovers from his wrist injury. 

Murray will leave it until Monday, when the Championship begins, before making a final decision on his fitness after damaging tendons in his right wrist in Hamburg last month. 

Federer, who can emulate Bjorn Borgs five-in-a-row at Wimbledon, should not be unduly troubled against Gabashvili although things could get tougher in the third round where he could meet another Russian, former world No. 1 Marat Safin. 

American ninth seed James Blake could be Federers opponent in the quarter finals, although powerhouse Russian Dmitry Tursunov and Chilean fifth seed Fernando Gonzalez are also lurking in that section of the draw. 

Nadal, who captured a hattrick of French titles earlier this month, looks to have a slightly easier path to the latter stages, although 36th-ranked Fish is a tricky opener. 

With Serbian Novak Djokovic in his half of the draw, the duo could face a repeat of their Roland Garros semi-final.

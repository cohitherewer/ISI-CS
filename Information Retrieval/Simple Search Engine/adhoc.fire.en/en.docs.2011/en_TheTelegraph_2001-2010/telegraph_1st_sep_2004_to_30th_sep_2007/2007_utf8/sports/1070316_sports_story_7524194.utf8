 Mushtaq lands in hospital

Kingston: Assistant Pakistan coach Mushtaq Ahmed was taken to hospital on Thursday after he suffered a bloody nose during a training session at the Kensington Cricket Club. 

We were conducting fielding practice and Mushtaq took a blow on the nose after an uneven bounce. There was a lot of blood, the teams media manager Pervez Mir said. It seems to have settled down but we will take him to hospital for an X-ray as a precaution.

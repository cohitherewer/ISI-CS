The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Nothing special, for now 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Dhaka: The Sheraton hotel wasnt swarming with security personnel when the Indian cricketers arrived around noon on Monday. There was, indeed, nothing exceptional about the bandobast. 

Things were quite different on Team Indias last visit, in December 2004. Then, the Rahul Dravids had even been joined by an IPS officer, Tapan Deka, to oversee arrangements. 

That became necessary after a specific threat from an extremist organisation, Harkut-ul-Jihad. 

Obviously, things have changed... There are no concerns and theres no special list of donts, the Indian high commissions protocol officer, P. P. Singh, told The Telegraph. 

Bangladesh is under a state of emergency.

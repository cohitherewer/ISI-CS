Marana: Tiger Woods came close to pulling off a Houdini-like escape against Australias Nick Hern before his run of seven consecutive PGA Tour titles ended at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship Friday. 

Left-hander Hern, who beat Woods 3 amp;1 in the second round in 2005 when the pair first met in the event, rolled in a 13-foot par putt on the 20th hole to seal a dramatic win. 

World number one Woods, who trailed by four after seven holes, mounted a stirring fightback with three consecutive birdies from the 10th before missing a four-foot birdie putt for victory on the 19th green. 

Champion in 2003 and 2004 when the event was held at La Costa Resort, Woods took the match into extra holes after powering a massive drive off the 18th tee and setting up another birdie with an approach to five feet. 

The back nine was pretty stomach-churning, Hern told reporters after reaching the last eight for the third time in four appearances. 

I knew he was going to make birdie on 18 and then he let me off the hook on the 19th, so things went my way. 

I forced him to make a lot of birdies, which he did. Hes the number one player in the world for a reason and it was a heck of a match in the end. 

Herns next opponent will be Swede Henrik Stenson, who came from one down after six holes to beat Australian Aaron Baddeley 4 amp;3. 

Britains Justin Rose was the first player to reach the quarter finals with a 3 amp;2 win over American Charles Howell III. 

Also going through to the last eight were holder Geoff Ogilvy of Australia, Canadas Stephen Ames, South Africas Trevor Immelman, American Chad Campbell and Britains Paul Casey. 

This is the best Ive played so far this year, said US Open champion Ogilvy, who won 2 amp;1 against Swedens Niclas Fasth on a cold and windy day at Dove Mountains Gallery Golf Club. 

I didnt play quite as good today but I think thats probably the nature of the weather. I played fantastic the first two days. (Reuters)

 Pak shock Aussies

Johannesburg: Shoaib Malik and Misbah-ul Haq shared a record partnership to lead Pakistan to a memorable victory over Australia in their ICC World Twenty20 Super Eight match on Tuesday. 

Captain Malik, who shared a fourth-wicket stand of 101 with Younis Khan in Pakistans win over Sri Lanka on Monday, bettered that record in Twenty20 internationals with Misbah in an unbroken fifth-wicket partnership of 119. 

That carried Pakistan to 165 for four and victory by six wickets with five balls to spare. 

Australia, who had trounced Bangladesh by nine wickets in their opening Super Eight clash on Sunday, had looked on course for victory when seamer Stuart Clark claimed three quick wickets to help reduce Pakistan to 46 for four. 

However, the rest of the Australian bowling was ineffective as Malik and Misbah turned the match round to secure a rousing win. 

Malik came in at the fall of the third wicket but it was 23-year-old Misbah who reached his half-century first, off 35 balls. Misbah finished on 66 not out with seven fours and a six. 

Malik was content to play second fiddle to his big-hitting partner and ended with 52 not out off 38 deliveries. 

Clark was the best of the Australian bowlers, taking three for 27 in his four overs, but he lacked support as Australia failed to capture wickets when the run-chase was on.

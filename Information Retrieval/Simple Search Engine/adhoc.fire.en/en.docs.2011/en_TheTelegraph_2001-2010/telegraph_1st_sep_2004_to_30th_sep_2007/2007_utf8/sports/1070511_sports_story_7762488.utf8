Calcutta: His teammates were getting ready for the first ODI against Bangladesh on Thursday morning when Manoj Tiwary had to board a flight from Dhaka to return home. 

A shoulder injury had ruled him out of the three-match series. So, instead of being in the thick of action at the Sher-e-Bangla Stadium, Tiwary was left facing a volley of questions from curious fans and friends at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport. 

He looked composed and relaxed as he spoke to newspersons. 

Its a minor injury and I hope to recover soon. Every sportsperson has injury problems, you have to live with it, said the mature Tiwary. 

The stylish right-hander is determined to recover soon and come back strongly. I have to start practising as soon as possible to attain the fitness level required for competing at the highest level, said Tiwary, whose right arm was in a sling. 

The Bengal player, who sustained the injury in his right shoulder during practice in Dhaka on Tuesday, has been advised to take the opinion of Dr Anant Joshi. 

Tiwary will be travelling to Mumbai on Saturday to see Dr Joshi. 

I have spoken to Professor Ratnakar Shetty and fixed up an appointment on Saturday. Tiwary will take the 9.30 am flight on Saturday, CAB joint secretary Saradindu Pal said.

 Sania faces Brianti

New Delhi: Sania Mirza will take on Italys Alberta Brianti in her opening singles match of the French Open which starts on Sunday. 

The Indian, who returned to action a fortnight ago from an injury-induced lay-off, may run into seventh seed Ana Ivanovic of Serbia if she clears the first hurdle. 

The 20-year-old is in the third quarter of the draw, which also features Russias Svetlana Kuznetsova as the third seed, Slovakian Daniela Hantuchova, seeded 12th, and former champion Anastasia Myskina. 

Sania has been struggling with her singles form and was knocked out in the first round of two WTA Tour events after returning to court. (PTI)

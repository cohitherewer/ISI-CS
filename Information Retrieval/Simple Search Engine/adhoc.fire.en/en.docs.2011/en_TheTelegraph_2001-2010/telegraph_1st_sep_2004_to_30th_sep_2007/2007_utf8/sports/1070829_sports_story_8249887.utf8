 Speeds backing for BCCI 

Mumbai: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Tuesday threw its weight behind the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in the latters stand-off with the Indian Cricket League (ICL), saying the BCCI was its only recognised body to administer the sport here. 

BCCI is the only recognised body by the ICC to run official cricket in India. We have not got any application from the ICL (for recognition) yet, but we have already set a five-step process to decide on such issues, said ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed here. 

Describing the first four stages of the process, Speed said: In the last stage we will be asking the applicants whether the member board of the country has approved it. If the answer is no we would not give it our recognition, Speed said at the news conference to announce the first list of the annual awardees. 

Speed said the first four steps in the process of approving a tournament by a private body were: whether its run for the development of the game or for charitable purpose; who were all playing in it and whether the players were all contracted to their parent boards; when and where they are to be played and whether anti-corruption measures were put in place to run the event. 

After all these steps only we will find out whether it has the approval of the member board, he emphasised. 

He cited the example of a tournament planned last year in the US that was shot down by the ICC for not fulfilling the mentioned criteria. 

Speed also referred to what one of ICLs talent scouts, Dean Jones, thought about the matches the ICL planned to organise. From what I gather they are seeking to run what I can call unofficial cricket. Dean Jones was criticised in Australia for joining the ICL and his reply was that it was only glorified exhibition matches, Speed said. 

We keep getting requests from private organisations for allowing them to organise events. ICC traditionally allows its members to run cricket. ICC does not interfere if a member board disciplines or does not discipline its players.

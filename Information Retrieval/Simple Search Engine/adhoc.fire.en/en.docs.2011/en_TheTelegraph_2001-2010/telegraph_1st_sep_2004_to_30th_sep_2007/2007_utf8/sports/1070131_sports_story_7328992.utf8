 No slot for TFA in NFL 2nd Division

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi: Tata Football Academy (TFA), who withdrew from the National Football League (NFL) earlier this season after refusing to build up a professional side, have not been given a slot in the Second Division NFL beginning next month. 

According to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources, TFA, who were second division champions last season, have not been considered this time after they failed to fulfill their premier division commitments this season. TFA had been playing in the second division NFL since the inception of the championships. 

From now on, TFA might not be considered for any AIFF tournament, said an AIFF official. The academy team will not be taken in the third division, too, he added. Incidentally, TFA players, for the past few years, have been a dominating force in Indias under-16 and under-19 teams. 

 Change in fixtures 

The fixtures for the second phase of the National Football League (NFL) have undergone minor changes, according to AIFF sources. While the East Bengal versus JCT match on February 19 will now be played in Ludhiana instead of Calcutta, the Sporting Clube de Goa-Mohun Bagan and Mahindra United-East Bengal matches will be played on March 10 and March 16, respectively. Earlier, the matches were fixed on March 16 and 17.

Sevilla became only the second team to defend the Uefa Cup successfully as they overcame fellow-Spanish side Espanyol after a dramatic final at Hampden Park went to a penalty shootout. The hero and villain was Domingos Jonatas, who equalised for Espanyol in extra-time but missed one of the spot-kicks. 

Adrianos first-half strike seemed to have urged Sevilla towards their target but a deflected shot from former Manchester City player Albert Riera brought Espanyol level within 10 minutes, a state of affairs that endured until extra-time. 

Walter Pandianis 11 goals did not earn him the start many had expected and Raul Tamudo and Luis Garcia were in attack for Espanyol, although it was Ivan de la Pena who caught the eye. It was his corner-kick, placed too near Andres Palop, which led to Sevilla scoring the opener after 18 minutes. 

The goalkeeper saw Adriano lurking on the halfway line and, with a colossal throw, sent the midfielder bolting forward. David Garcia, having crossed the pitch from his left-back beat for the corner, tried frantically to make up ground, but a combination of the treacherous turf plus his premature attempt to tackle, sent him skidding to the deck and Adriano sped on to draw Gorka Irazioz and curl his shot around him. 

Palop was entitled to claim an assist on the goal but it was an intervention by his own right-back, Alves, that left him beaten for the equaliser. 

Alves addiction to pushing forward repeatedly left a gap which Christian Poulsen tried to fill, but when Riera cut inside it was Alves who tried to block his shot from behind. Instead, the drive deflected off his leg high past Palop.

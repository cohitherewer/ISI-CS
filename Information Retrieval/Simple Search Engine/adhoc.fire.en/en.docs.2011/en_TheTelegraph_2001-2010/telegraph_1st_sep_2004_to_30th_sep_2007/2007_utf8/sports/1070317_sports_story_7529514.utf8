 Symonds not to play tomorrow

Basseterre: Australia have decided not to risk injured allrounder Andrew Symonds by fielding him in their next game in the World Cup against The Netherlands on Sunday. 

He is not going to play in that game. He has not done enough to be able to play in that game at this point. It represents too much of a risk, in my opinion, Australian team physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said. 

Kountouris, however, said that Symonds would be in a position to play in the big match against South Africa on March 22. He is on target for a week or so. The realistic game is South Africa, Kountouris was quoted in media. 

This may be good news for Brad Hodge. Though Hodge is aware his reprieve will be temporary, he thinks his burgeoning offspinners might just save his place in the Australian line-up. (Agencies)

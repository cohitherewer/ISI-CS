 ICC clears stand on Asif 

Karachi: The ICC has stuck to its stand of not allowing former Pakistan captain Asif Iqbal to hold any key positions in the wake of his alleged involvement in the match-fixing scandal. 

In a response to Pakistan Cricket Boards query regarding their stand on Asif, ICC has reinforced their position and reminded about their commitment to not award key positions to players against whom serious allegations have been made in the past, sources said. 

The former Pakistan captain had his name mentioned a few times in an inquiry commission finding by Justice Malik Qayyum into match-fixing and also in a report by a British tabloid, but no evidence has ever been given about his alleged involvement in fixing matches. (PTI)

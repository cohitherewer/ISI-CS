The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Gonzalez is no flash in the pan

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Fernando Gonzalez may have caught many napping with his march to the Australian Open final, but hes certainly no flash in the pan, according to the maestros The Telegraph spoke to on Saturday. 

Following are excerpts from what the Calcutta trio had to say on the Chilean who will be facing Roger Federer in Sundays final in Melbourne (alphabetically): 

AKHTAR ALI: We have seen the birth of a star. Hes got a good serve and fine temperament. He moves well and plays solid, producing fine shots match after match. Hes definitely not a flash in the pan. Its a big match coming up for him on Sunday, his first Grand Slam final. I think Federers experience will see him through. 

 NARESH KUMAR: What has 

 surprised me is the consistency with which he (Gonzalez) 

 is producing great shots at such a high speed. Havent 

 seen anyone play like this. To beat Nadal and Haas the way 

 he did, was quite amazing. He is a trend-setter, not a flash 

 in the pan. He has been producing sound performances in 

 Grand Slams and Tour events regularly. Its difficult 

 to say whether he can beat Federer, but I think it will 

 be a major test for the world No.1. If Gonzalez can handle 

 Federers serve, the Swiss could be in trouble. 

 JAIDIP MUKERJEA: He 

 is a very talented player, with a great forehand. He tends 

 to keep the ball going on the backhand side and goes for 

 a big forehand winner whenever he gets a chance. He has 

 beaten top players, so hes not a flash in the pan 

 I would say he has been an under-rated player. I thought 

 he was second-best player at the quarter final stage and 

 that if anyone could beat Federer, it was Gonzalez. Federer 

 will be the favourite on Sunday, but he wont have 

 a cakewalk like he did versus Andy Roddick.

 Dhoni, Karthik lack basics 

Ahmedabad: Former India wicketkeeper Syed Kirmani believes Mahendra Singh Dhonis struggle behind the stumps in England are borne out of the fact that he is not getting his basics right. 

Kirmani, considered one of countrys best keepers, said Dhoni stands flat-footed which is the major reason for his current woes. 

He said both Dhoni and Dinesh Karthik lacked the necessary technique. 

A natural wicketkeeper will always be on his toes. They should learn the right technique first, said Kirmani. 

These guys are flat-footed behind the stumps. They lack the necessary technique to succeed behind the stumps in the long run, he said. 

They (Dhoni and Karthik) are not natural wicketkeepers. Reflexes, vision and athleticism are inherent in natural keepers, said Kirmani. 

The skills of Dhoni and Karthik behind the stumps will be tested when they enter a lean phase, he said. 

They are match-winners now and so nobody is bothered about the right technique. 

Kirmani also criticised Dhoni for seeking tips from county wicketkeepers in England. 

They should have talked to English wicketkeeping greats like Alan Knott and Bob Taylor if they wished to improve their skills. 

They are in fact trying to learn skills from English club wicketkeepers and (Indian fielding coach) Robin Singh, Kirmani said. What does Robin Singh know about wicket-keeping? asked Kirmani.

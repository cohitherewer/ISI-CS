 Malik banks on Afridi

Durban: Fast bowler Shoaib Akhtars absence would not affect Pakistans approach in the ICC World Twenty20 tournament, coach Geoff Lawson and captain Shoaib Malik said on Tuesday. 

Shoaib was sent home on Friday after a dressing-room altercation with Mohammed Asif. 

It threatens to be less entertaining without Shoaib, probably, and certainly less interesting from the teams point of view, Lawson told a news conference. 

But weve got some outstanding fast bowlers in our squad. Its not going to affect how we approach the game, our tactics will be the same, he added. Pakistan will launch their campaign against Scotland on Wednesday. 

According to Malik, presence of explosive striker Shahid Afridi would hold the key for his team and provide them with some psychological advantage in the much-awaited clash against India on Friday. 

Actually, anyone can be a trump card in this version of the game. If a bowler gets two wickets in an over, or if a batsmen gets you 15 runs in an over, he could turn the game on its head. 

But having said that, we do have an advantage in having a player like Shahid Afridi in our ranks because getting a good start will be important. 

In Wednesdays another match, Australia play Zimbabwe in Cape Town.

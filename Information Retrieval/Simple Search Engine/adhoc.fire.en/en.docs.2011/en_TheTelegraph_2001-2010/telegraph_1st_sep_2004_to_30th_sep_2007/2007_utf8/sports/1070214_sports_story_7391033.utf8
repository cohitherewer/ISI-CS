 Shoaib, Asif, Gul named

A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES

Calcutta/Karachi: Pakistan selectors have named unfit fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Asif and Umar Gul in their 15-member World Cup squad, according to a PCB press release received by The Telegraph. 

There were no major surprises in the squad but the composition indicates the lack of faith in back-up players. Shoaib is struggling with a knee injury, and also has to pass a dope test, while Gul has not played since December due to an ankle injury. Gul and Shoaib were recalled from South Africa during the recent Test series due to their injury problems. Asif is also not fully fit. 

A PCB official said Shoaib had also gone to London on a private visit to seek medical opinion about his knee injury. 

He has been advised rest for two to three weeks and wanted to get a second opinion as he is keen to play in the World Cup, he said. 

Selector Iqbal Qasim said the committee had drawn up a shortlist of reserve players which would be released soon. Its learnt that the list includes Mohammed Sami, who is struggling with a back problem, Shabbir Ahmed (groin injury) and Shahid Nazir. The selectors were also forced to include leg-spinner Danish Kaneria.

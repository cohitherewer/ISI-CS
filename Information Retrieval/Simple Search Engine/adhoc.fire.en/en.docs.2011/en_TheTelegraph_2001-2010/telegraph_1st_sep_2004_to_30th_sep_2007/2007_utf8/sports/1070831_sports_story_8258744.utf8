The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Wild nights are a thing of the past

 - Andrew Flintoff is off liquor nowadays 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Andrew Flintoff 

Calcutta: Andrew Freddie Flintoff, of the pedalo affair fame during this years World Cup, is actually a much changed man. On Wednesday night, he even stumped former India wicketkeeper Farokh Engineer! 

I couldnt believe it when Freddie didnt touch wine and said hed been off every kind of liquor for at least eight weeks, Engineer told The Telegraph on the morning-after. 

The stumping-act occurred at The Players Bar and Restaurant (part-owned among others by Ernie Els, Michael Vaughan and Flintoff himself) in Cheshire. Thats where the duo hosted a Mumbai-based family, the highest bidders when Dinner with Freddie and Farokh was auctioned on Englands 2006 tour of India. 

Flintoffs wife Rachel was present at the dinner. Engineers family wife Julie and daughter Roxanne was there as well. 

That auction was part of Freddies Benefit Year and the Indian family, if Im not wrong, bid 25,000. Besides the dinner, theyve got seats for Thursdays ODI and are being looked after by the Benefit committee, Engineer pointed out. 

According to Engineer, the Benefit Year raised around 4 million for one of the truly outstanding allrounders of the present times. One-fourth of that sum has been donated to charities. 

The 29-year-old Flintoff has, of course, just made a comeback after surgery on his left ankle. Earlier in the summer, he missed the entire home series against the West Indies and wasnt available for the three Tests versus India either. 

The pedalo affair, when Flintoff almost drowned in the Atlantic, occured in St Lucia after the match against New Zealand. The then vice-captain and five teammates, whod been drinking for eight hours, had to be rescued from the ocean at the unearthly hour of 4.00 am. 

That misdemeanour cost Flintoff the vice-captaincy. He was also dropped for Englands next match, versus Canada. Teammates James Anderson, Ian Bell, John Lewis, Paul Nixon and Liam Plunkett were fined. 

Perhaps impressed by the change in Flintoff (Englands No.1 hero during the 2005 Ashes win), the powers-that-be asked him to be ready to lead if Paul Collingwood was forced to miss the fourth ODI (at Old Trafford) of the ongoing series. 

Collingwood, as it turned out, quickly recovered from his illness.

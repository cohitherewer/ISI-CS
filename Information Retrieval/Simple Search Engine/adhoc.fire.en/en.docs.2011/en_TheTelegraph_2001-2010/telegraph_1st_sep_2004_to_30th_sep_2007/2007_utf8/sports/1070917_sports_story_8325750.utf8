The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 All dressed up and ready to roll

SREEMOY TALUKDAR

 Marion Bartoli in the city on Sunday. A Telegraph picture 

Calcutta: She has written 80 detective novels and created unforgettable characters such as Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple. Agatha Christie has been called by the Guinness Book of World Records among others the best-selling author of all time, second only to William Shakespeare! 

Now, at last, the Queen of Crime has a worthy challenger. 

If the hush-hush regarding her arrival, mystery surrounding her injury and question mark over her participation is anything to go by, Sania Mirza may well give the Grand Dame of Intrigue a run for her money. 

The 21-year-old finally stepped into the city late on Sunday and wont take a decision on her participation until after practice on Monday. 

But for this drama, the limelight could have been more on the Sunfeast Open that gets underway in the city from Monday. 

The tournament suffered another body blow on Sunday with sixth-seeded Frenchwoman Alize Cornet withdrawing with back pain. With Sania a likely dropout and an injured Tamarine Tanasugarn pulling out, its fast turning into a qualifiers paradise. 

With Sachins arrival on Tuesday still uncertain and Sourav Gangulys presence during the opening ceremony on Monday cancelled, the build-up, too, has taken a beating. 

However, unlike the previous years when there was always a clear favourite, this years field is in no way a one-horse race despite the pullouts and uncertainties. 

The title is likely to be a toss up between top Frenchwoman Marion Bartoli and World No. 12 Daniela Hantuchova, who recently swapped places on the WTA rankings list. 

About $175,000 is up for grabs at this Tier III event, arguably South East Asias biggest tennis spectacle, but more than the money it is the prospect of some crucial points that has drawn the likes of World No.10 Bartoli and sleek Slovak Hantuchova here. 

For Bartoli, 2007 has been a breakthrough year. Though she hasnt won a title yet, she at last did justice to her talent by reaching the Wimbledon final for the first time and made her maiden fourth round appearance at the US Open. It took the Williams sisters, Venus and then Serena, to stop her run in both majors. 

Interestingly, she now must overtake the Williams sisters in the WTA Champions Race if she wants to qualify for the season-ending Tour Championships in Madrid. With 1802 points so far and five spots still left, Bartoli will go all out to garner a few more points and secure a ticket to Spain. 

That leaves us with No. 2 seed Hantuchova. She has made it to the hot list of worlds sexiest tennis players twice, but the Slovak surely has an eye on a spot in the WTA Tour Championships. She did her chances no harm by making the Bali Open final (losing to Lindsay Davenport on Sunday) and with a little bit of luck in her maiden Calcutta appearance, that Madrid berth may become a possibility. 

With the withdrawal of Cornet, Hantuchova will now be facing Marta Domachowska, a qualifier, instead of Yaroslava Shvedova the Russian who bagged the WTA Bangalore Open this year. 

If Sania fails to make it, the scene looks pretty bleak for the host nation. Except for Sunitha Rao, who will be representing India this time and will face a lucky loser in case the Hyderabad girl withdraws, the other two wild card entrants have tough opening encounters. 

Tara Iyer has had a great year so far, winning three consecutive ITF events in Wrexham (England), Noida and New Delhi. But when she takes on world No. 69 Flavia Pennetta of Italy, it will be a whole new ball game. 

Former Davis Cupper and Arjuna award recipient Jaidip Mukerjea, however, feels it is not beyond Tara to spring a surprise. 

Tara has had a very good year. It will be good exposure for her and a tough match, but it will also be an interesting one Dont write off Tara. 

Though guarded on the prospects of 14-year-old Kyra Shroff, who will meet Taipeis Yung-Jan Chan, Jaidip, the tournament director, said: Sania also started her career with a wild card Kyra is a very promising player 

Rushmi Chakravarthys loss to Neha Uberoi of the US in the qualifiers has made the Indian presence even leaner. 

But since when has tennis been limited to patriotic sentiments? Top WTA players in action and a whiff of festivity in the city air will surely be a combination for tennis connoisseurs to relish. A coat of fresh paint over three-year-old carpets and the Sunfeast Open is ready to roll again. Here we go!

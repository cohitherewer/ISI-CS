The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Im not satisfied: Ambani

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Boniface Ambani scored both goals for East Bengal at Barasat stadium on Sunday, but still wasnt a satisfied man. 

I may have scored two goals, but thats my job Im not satisfied because the team didnt win, the Kenyan striker told newsmen on way to the team bus from the dressing room. 

Churchill coach wasnt too unhappy with the result. A draw in Calcutta is a good result as it fetches you an important point. So in that respect Im satisfied, said Moroccan Kakim Bencherifa. 

Our main aim was to remain undefeated after four rounds, but not play with a defensive mind-set Im happy with the way the boys reacted to situations. 

East Bengal coach Carlos Roberto Pereira said his team gifted Churchill Brothers both goals. Admitting that there were some problems with the defence and midfield, the Brazilian said: Not every day will be the same, no two matches similar, thats football It will be like this till the end of the competition. 

Pereira agreed that his team had lost a very good opportunity. 

All teams are tough, some results wont make the fans happy, said Pereira philosophically, adding that the boos and abuses from the stands didnt disappoint him. 

Theres a gap of over a month now as the players get busy with national duty, and so Pereira is in no hurry to plan for the next phase. 

Ill start thinking about the future tomorrow (Monday), Pereira said, adding there will be no respite in practice.

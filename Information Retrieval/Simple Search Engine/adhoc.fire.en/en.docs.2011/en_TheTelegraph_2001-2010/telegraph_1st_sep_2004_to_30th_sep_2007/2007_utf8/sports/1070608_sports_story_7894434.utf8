 Team Bhupathi bows out

Paris: Indian campaign at the French Open came to an end with Mahesh Bhupathi and his Czech comrade-in-arms Radek Stepanek bowing out of the mens doubles with a straight set defeat to sixth seeds Mark Knowles and Daniel Nestor in the semi-finals Thursday. 

Bhupathi and Stepanek, who had pulled off a major upset beating second seeds Jonas Bjorkman and Max Mirnyi in the quarter finals, came a cropper as Knowles and Nestor thumped the duo 6-3, 6-4 in 79 minutes. 

The Indo-Czech pair looked out of sorts against the seeded pair, known for their solid clay court game. Bhupathi and Stepanek could not break their opponent even once in the entire match. 

After losing the first set in just over half an hour, the fightback never materialised as Bhupathi and Stepanek merely delayed the inevitable before crashing out. (PTI)

 Rain threat over SA A vs India A one-dayer

Ahmedabad: Rains could play spoilsport at Motera on Wednesday where India A takes on South Africa A in the first of the three one-day cricket matches at the Sardar Patel Stadium near here. 

It has been raining since the last four days due to a low pressure zone created over Gujarat, meterological department sources here said. The downpour and cloudy atmosphere has left the out-field at Motera completely soggy. 

Due to heavy rains for the last four days, the out-field has become completely soggy, stadium curator Dhiraj Parsana said on Tuesday. We have employed about 30 labourers to soak water with sponges from some of the very wet spots on the field The super-sopper is also being used to dry out the out-field, he added. 

However, the entire square in the middle including the pitch is absolutely dry, Prasana stated. 

We are trying our best to ensure that the match starts on time tomorrow, the curator remarked. 

Though both the teams arrived a couple of days ago, intermittent rains at night have not allowed the teams any net-practice. 

If it does not rain for the rest today and later at night, then chances are bright that play will start on time tomorrow, Parsana said. 

The other two matches of the one-day series are scheduled at Vadodara (September 28) and Rajkot (September 30).

 Star Gesture may come good 

 HONKY DORY

 Star Gesture, a close second to Quest For Cash in his debut run last winter, is strongly fancied to lift the 1,400m Chantilli August Handicap, the star attraction in Pune race-card on Sunday. 

 The Karthik Ganapathy-trained three-year-old is working well and with jockey B. Prakash in the saddle, the Royal Kingdom- Housewarming son is expected to strike it rich.

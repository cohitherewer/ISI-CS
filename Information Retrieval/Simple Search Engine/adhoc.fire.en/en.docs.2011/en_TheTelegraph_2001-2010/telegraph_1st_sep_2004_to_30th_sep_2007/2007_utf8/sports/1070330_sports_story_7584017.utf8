 Inzy amp; Co. forced to play

Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) threatened the team with severe penalties and forced them to play their final tie against Zimbabwe following the death of coach Bob Woolmer, it was revealed on Thursday. 

Sources said that captain Inzamam-ul Haq had initially told the players that the team would not play the group D game against Zimbabwe which was held on March 21, three days after Woolmer died. 

Inzamam and the team, sources said, did not want to play in the wake of the death of coach Woolmer and the subsequent police investigations. 

It took a late-night telephone call from the PCB and threats of severe penalties for Inzamam and the players to finally relent, one source said. 

The manager, Talat Ali, put his foot down and told Inzamam and senior players in a meeting that they would not decide which match to play and must fulfil their commitment against Zimbabwe, the source said.

 Knives will be out for Inzy: Rameez

Karachi: Feeling of anger and disgust was prominent in Pakistans cricket fraternity after the team was stunned by minnows Ireland and tumbled out of the World Cup in a humiliating fashion. 

Here are some of the reactions in alphabetical order: 

AAQIB JAVED: We have to change this culture of allowing senior players to hang on in the team even when it is obvious they are past their best. They bring down the whole team with them. 

RASHID LATIF: It is a sorry state of affairs. But it is a fact that in Pakistan there is no culture or precedent for players and officials to accept responsibility for a bad performance and go gracefully. They have to be shunted out. 

ABDUL QADIR: They (captain Inzamam-ul Haq and coach Bob Woolmer) must accept responsibility and go. The captain has no moral ground to remain in the team as he was given all the support and authority to do what he wanted in the past few years by the PCB. 

RAMEEZ RAJA: Inzamam has an uneasy future, he was under so much pressure before the World Cup. I think the knives will be out for him and Woolmer. The coach contractually finishes his stint after the World Cup, and it has now come to a premature end. (AGENCIES)

 Jeev, Ghei tied 40th

Hamburg: Jeev Milkha Singh and Gaurav Ghei made a great effort on the back-nine to finish with two-under 70 each and were tied 40th after round I of the Deutsche Bank Players Championship of Europe on Thursday. Jyoti Randhawa and Shiv Kapur shot one-under 71 each and were tied 61st. 

While Jeev, Randhawa and Kapur hold full playing card, Ghei is starting this week on a sponsors invite. Simon Khan putted like a dream to take the first round lead at Gut Kaden. 

Jeev had a fine start with three birdies on the front nine, but he began his return journey from 10th with three successive bogeys as he dropped to par. But two late birdies on 15th and 18th saw him finish at 70. 

Ghei, playing in Europe for the first time this season, had birdies on the second and third and fifth, but a bogey on fourth meant he was still two-under after five holes. (PTI)

 Big guns move closer to finals

London: European champions Greece moved closer to a place in next years European Championship finals with a 2-1 win over Moldova in Iraklion on Wednesday (as reported in Thursdays Late City edition). 

With a year and a day to go, France beat Georgia 1-0 in Auxerre, Germany beat Slovakia 2-1 in Hamburg and Romania beat Slovenia 2-0 in Timisoara to move closer to the Euro 2008 finals in Austria-Switzerland. 

There was no joy for Poland however, who stayed five points clear at the top of group A after a shock 0-1 defeat at lowly Armenia whose Scottish boss Ian Porterfield described the victory as one of the biggest in the countrys history. 

Croatia, the leaders in group E, also failed to pick up maximum points when they were held to a 0-0 draw at home by Russia, allowing Israel, who won 2-0 in Andorra, to pull level with them at the top of the group on 17 points. 

There was a change at the top of group F with Northern Ireland, who were without a game, slipping back to third as Sweden, who beat Iceland 5-0, moved into first place. 

Spain, who won 2-0 in Liechtenstein, moved into second place. Sweden currently have 16 points, one more than Spain, but their points tally could change after Uefa decides on Friday how to allocate the points from the abandoned 3-3 draw with Denmark. 

Although they are not among the group leaders, England scored a 3-0 win over Estonia in Tallinn to keep their chances alive. David Beckham marked his return to competitive football, for the first time since the World Cup, by setting up two of the goals. 

Italy also maintained their push for the finals with an impressive 2-0 win in Lithuania with Fabio Quagliarella scoring two fine goals in his first start for his country. 

Armenias 1-0 win over Poland was the biggest shock with Hamlet Mkhitaryan scoring the only goal of the group A match in Yerevan with a 70th-minute free-kick. 

Poland have never reached the European finals. Despite the loss they remain clear at the top as Portugal and Serbia, both on 14, did not play. Finland also moved on to 14 points after beating Belgium 2-0 in Helsinki. 

France stayed top of group B with a 1-0 win over Georgia with Samir Nasri scoring his first international goal. France remain two points clear of world champions Italy and their next game, on September 8, features a re-match of the World Cup final. 

Scotland moved on to 15 points in the same group with a 2-0 win in the Faroe Islands. (REUTERS)

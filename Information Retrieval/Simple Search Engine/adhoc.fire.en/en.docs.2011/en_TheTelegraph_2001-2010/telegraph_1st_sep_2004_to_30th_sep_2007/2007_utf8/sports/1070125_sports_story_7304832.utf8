 Man held

Melbourne: A third man has been charged with taking inappropriate photos of women at the Australian Open, as police vowed to crack down on anyone wrongly using hand-held cameras. 

Victoria state police said the 34-year-old Sydney man also allegedly took several photographs of women in a bathroom at a central Melbourne backpackers hostel. 

He was arrested Tuesday after a female victim at the hostel raised the alarm. Police also allegedly found a photo on his camera he had taken up a womans skirt at the Australian Open. 

His case follows the arrest of two men, aged 32 and 35, last week for similar offences. 

Victoria state police chief commissioner Christine Nixon warned they would crack down on anyone using hand-held cameras to film and photograph people inappropriately. (AFP)

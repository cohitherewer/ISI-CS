The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Derby thrown into jeopardy 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan will not play Fridays scheduled CFL Premier Division match against East Bengal unless the IFA posts foreign or outstation match officials. 

This is to protest what Mohun Bagan officials claim to be biased refereeing by local officials favouring East Bengal, the latest instance being their abandoned match against Peerless. 

We will play only if foreign or outstation referees are brought to supervise the match, said club secretary Anjan Mitra at the end of a day of dramatic developments. If the IFA still slots the match, were ready to face the consequences for not playing. 

The IFA secretary, however, remained optimistic about the match taking place on schedule. I believe any problem can be resolved through discussions said Utpal Ganguly. 

It was at an executive meeting in the afternoon that Mohun Bagan gave shape to their protest which had been doing the rounds from Monday. Mitra then led his members to the IFA office and met the secretary. 

We urged the secretary to see video clippings of Sundays East Bengal versus Peerless match, Mitra said. The match was abandoned after 68 minutes with Peerless leading 2-0. 

The IFA ordered a replay on Tuesday, ignoring Peerless claim that they should be awarded full points. 

We also said that weve lost confidence in local referees and since this is a very important game, there should be outstation officials on Friday, Mitra said. Well be sending CDs of the East Bengal versus Peerless match to the AIFF, AFC and Fifa. 

The IFA secretary met Calcutta Referees Association officials to seek their views on Mohun Bagans demand. 

The CRA is of the view that its referees are well equipped to handle Fridays match So there will be local referees for that match, said Ganguly. But we will refer Mohun Bagans complaint (about the East Bengal-Peerless game) to the league sub-committee to check if the referee is at fault.

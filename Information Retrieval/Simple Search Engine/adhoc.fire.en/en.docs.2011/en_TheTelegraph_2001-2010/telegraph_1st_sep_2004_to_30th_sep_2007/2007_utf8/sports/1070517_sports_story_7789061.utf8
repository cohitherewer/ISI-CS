 Win in FA Cup wont erase League pain: Mourinho

Cobham: Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho said on Wednesday that beating Manchester United in the FA Cup final could not erase the memory of losing their Premier League crown to Alex Fergusons side. 

The two rivals meet at the new Wembley Stadium on Saturday with United still celebrating having ended Chelseas two-year run as English champions. 

To win it would be fantastic but I dont think we can say that this game will make us forget what has happened in the season, Mourinho told a news conference. 

This is something weve been chasing a lot from the first day we wanted to be there at the Cup final. 

Chelsea were at the last Cup final at the old Wembley, he said, referring to their victory over Aston Villa in 2000. And weve done everything to deserve to be there (again). 

We have to play this final with happiness, and not any kind of pressure. 

Mourinhos side has won two Premier League titles and a second League Cup in February since the Portuguese coach took over in 2004. Now he wants to complete his set of domestic trophies. 

Its the only title our group hasnt won in the years weve been together and its a special time because its the Cup at the new Wembley. 

Im not English, but for me it means a lot. 

Remembering my youth, there were a few trophies I always wanted to win and a few matches I wanted to participate in and the FA Cup final was one of them. And for the players its no different. 

One problem facing Chelseas preparations is what Mourinho called: Too many injuries. 

Midfielder Michael Ballack, striker Andriy Shevchenko and defender Ricardo Carvalho are all out and midfielder John Obi Mikel is a major injury doubt. 

John Obi Mikel is a big risk, said the Chelsea coach. In a final you have 90 intense minutes and then a chance of playing another 30. 

Left back Ashley Cole and winger Arjen Robben are also short of full match fitness after ankle and knee problems, respectively, and Mourinho said neither could last a full 90 minutes.

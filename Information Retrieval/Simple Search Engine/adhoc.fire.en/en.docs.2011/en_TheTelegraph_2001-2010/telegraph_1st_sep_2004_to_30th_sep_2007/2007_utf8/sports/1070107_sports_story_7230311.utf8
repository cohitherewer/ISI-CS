The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tough ask for strikerless East Bengal 

Mumbai: Former champions East Bengal would take on local favourites Air India at the Cooperage Ground in a National Football League (NFL) encounter on Sunday. 

Both teams go into their seasons opening NFL clash without anything substantial to show by way of results, though the Carlos Pereira-coached Calcutta giants, runners-up to Mumbais Mahindra United last season, have a slight edge over Air India. 

East Bengal, three-time NFL champions, have been weakened by the flight of top players, including Bhaichung Bhutia, and the lack of strike power could be a major handicap for the glamour side. The team, which won the Super Cup last season by beating Mahindra, could not make it to the semi-finals of the Federation Cup after losing 0-1 to Dempo Sports Club of Goa. 

The red and golds would once again depend on Alvito DCunha to make inroads into rival territory, but in the absence of effective strikers they could go waste. Air India, too, are not that effective up-front and their forays would depend on the speed of winger Paresh Shivalkar and the skills of foreign import Bashiru Abbas. 

Still, the Mumbai side must be nurturing hopes of putting it across their Calcutta rivals in familiar conditions in their quest to improve standing from last years poor seventh.On Monday, champions Mahindra United start off their campaign by taking on Dempo. (PTI)

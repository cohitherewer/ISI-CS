The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A side that consistently thrilled

Henry Winter

 Cristiano Ronaldo and Ryan Giggs 

In the season that Sir Alex Ferguson became entitled to ride the buses for free, on Sunday he booked himself a trip on an open-top bus surrounded by hundreds of thousands of Manchester United admirers, and hailed by millions as a master-motivator of men and an impresario of the best show in town. 

Chelseas failure to defeat Arsenal meant that the Premiership title passed to Ferguson (as reported in Mondays City edition), whose passport says 65 years old, whose face says 55, and whose lust for life and glory says 25. To think that we questioned his fire, his ability to construct teams in his own ambitious, adventurous image. 

Ferguson will stand proudly on the bus, alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and the rest of his footballing family, handing around the Premiership trophy and accepting the thrown scarves, bouquets and plaudits. 

He has been here before, and for a man celebrating his ninth league success it was surprising to see him spill the champagne on Sunday, yet those bubbles must have tasted so sweet. Chelsea pushed United all the way, staying on their coat-tails till the end. 

Like fallen warriors, Jose Mourinhos erstwhile champions were carried out on their shield, every drop of sweat expended for the cause. The sight of Chelseas inspirational leader, John Terry, pushed into emergency centre-forward action late on here, supported by Scott Sinclair and Salomon Kalou, signalled the shortage of resources. Chelsea were not so much down to the bare bones, as scraping the marrow. 

While Fergusons team maintained their momentum, Chelsea ran out of options as well as steam. Like a heavyweight, they absorbed too much punishment; the injuries to Petr Cech and, for two months, Terry, robbed them of security and drive. 

Chelsea were over-reliant on a few players, notably Terry, Ricardo Carvalho, Frank Lampard, Michael Essien and Didier Drogba. United spread the goals and the bravura displays around; Ronaldo, Uniteds top-of-the-bill performer, was mesmerising, sprinkling goals and gold-dust across all corners of the Premiership landscape, but the supporting cast was almost as accomplished. 

Rooney was all touch and commitment, an assassin with a substantial return in the assists column. Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs excelled, contributing vital goals at key moments, while Michael Carrick seemed to grow in influence the more speculation intensified about Owen Hargreaves. In defence, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra also came of age for United. Even the lesser lights, like John Shea, twinkled. 

Consistently, United were the most thrilling team to watch, a side to lift the soul far more than their machine-like rivals from London. It was poetry versus prose, a goal difference of +57 reflecting Uniteds buccaneering spirit. If one contrast can highlight the differences between United and Chelsea, it was the way in which Henrik Larsson arrived during the winter, settled immediately, scored some goals, and then left with applause ringing in his ears. 

Now look at Chelseas recruits. The champions were let down by their recent signings, Michael Ballack and Andrei Shevchenko, both hugely disappointing, both a reminder that money cant buy you love every time. Let us hope they listened to Mourinhos barbed comments about the determination on show from those in blue on Sunday. 

This was a deliberate, brutal warning to certain over-paid under-achievers. If Mourinho stays, and has his way over transfer policy, it is hard to imagine Ballack and Shevchenko remaining. 

Other newcomers also flopped. Chelseas immense defiance at the Emirates was mainly seen when Khalid Boulahrouz was dismissed. 

As Boulahrouz ambled, Julio Baptista gambled on Terry missing Jens Lehmanns long ball. Reacting too slowly, Boulahrouz eventually brought the Brazilian down. Alan Wiley pointed straight to the spot, and rightly gestured Boulahrouz towards the dressing-room. Delighted Arsenal fans punched the air as Gilberto Silva drove the penalty past Cech. 

Mourinho tapped a pencil languidly against his calf, resembling an architect waiting for the muse to strike. All around him, the local glee club chanted: Youre getting sacked in the summer. 

The apparent civil war between Mourinho and his employers needs ending swiftly. Roman Abramovich clearly loves Chelsea, but he must inform the fans of his plans for the manager. Up at Old Trafford, peace prevailed, witnessed by Fergusons skilful defusing of any possible tension between Rooney and Ronaldo following their World Cup contretemps. 

Like Rooney, Lampard and Terry also returned dejected from Germany. Like Rooney, they have made up for a summer of frustration with powerful performances throughout the autumn, winter and spring. 

What character Chelsea showed as they fought to keep their title. Terry, Kalou and Lampard went close, but the final whistle sounded like the Last Post. 

Sporting men like Terry and Lampard will doubtless be the first to salute Ferguson, Ronaldo and Rooney when the new champions stroll into the Bridge on Wednesday. As the fanfare blasts out, Terry and Lampard will tell themselves they can reclaim the pot next season. The ageless Ferguson will have other ideas.

 Fredalo incident in WI affected team morale, says Vaughan

 - England skipper confirms he backed the decision to remove Flintoff as vice-captain 

TIMES ONLINE

 IN HAPPIER TIMES: Andrew Flintoff and Michael Vaughan 

In a move that seems certain to test relationships in the England dressing-room, Michael Vaughan has laid the blame for their dismal showing at the World Cup in the Caribbean this year squarely at the door of Andrew Flintoff. 

The England captain says that Flintoffs drunken escapade on a pedalo one match into the tournament had a drastic effect on team morale. Vaughan goes on to confirm that he had backed the decision to strip Flintoff of the vice-captaincy. I was obviously asked [about the decision], Vaughan says in an interview published this morning. That was the decision. It was a tough decision, but after what went on it was bound to happen. 

Vaughan takes some of the blame by acknowledging that his captaincy was not up to its usual standard, but it is his comments on Flintoff that might be interesting if the all-rounder, who is recovering from a third operation on his left ankle, returns as hoped to the England dressing-room during the series against India that starts next month. 

We arrived at the World Cup in a positive frame of mind, but unfortunately incidents happened which affected the team. You have to be honest, the Fredalo incident did affect team morale, Vaughan said. Those incidents are bound to affect team spirit. 

Suddenly youve got players who have no freedom left. I like to see players enjoy themselves but no one would dare go out after that incident and you cant create any spirit then. 

That incident changed the whole atmosphere in the camp. We went into the New Zealand game [Englands opening World Cup fixture] with a really good attitude, but we didnt play well and after Fredalo we just started taking it all too seriously. That might sound silly but everyone was too tense and desperate. There was no escape and even on the field you have to be pretty free, especially in one-day cricket. 

Vaughan said that he was more tense than Ive ever been as captain and that Duncan Fletcher was more tense than hed ever been as coach. He adds: I didnt captain as well as I should have done because of the pressure I put myself under. Id admit that. But I couldnt switch off because away from the field there was so much going on [the death of Bob Woolmer, Pakistan coach, and the Fredalo incident]. 

Vaughan also answered criticism that he has been given preferential treatment by the England selectors. A day will come when England will be better off without me, but at the minute I think theyre a lot better off with me, he said. Theres nothing wrong in thinking youre quite good. 

Maybe Andrew Flintoff should be saying the same thing. Im hoping he is because were certainly a better team with him. Ive come back from knee injuries and hes come back from ankle injuries, so he can certainly do it again.

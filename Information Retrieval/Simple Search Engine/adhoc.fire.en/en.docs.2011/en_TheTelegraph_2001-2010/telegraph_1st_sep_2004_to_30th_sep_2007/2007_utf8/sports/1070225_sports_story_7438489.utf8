 Sourav would be a better deputy: Kapil

New Delhi: Kapil Dev has questioned the appointment of Sachin Tendulkar as vice-captain of Indias World Cup squad, saying it would have been better to give the post to someone younger, or even Sourav Ganguly. 

I feel the vice-captain should have been someone young, so that we could have groomed him for captaincy. Till the time Rahul Dravid is playing, he should remain captain, he said. 

He also said it was rather strange that Sachin accepted the offer. Sachin didnt show any interest in becoming captain again. He never said anything publicly about such a desire, Kapil was quoted as saying in a press release issued by a TV channel. 

If he wants to take up the job, he should say it openly and not merely talk to selectors. And it would be an insult to Sachin if the selectors made him the vice-captain and then named someone else captain, Kapil said. 

Indias only World Cup-winning captain said he would have preferred Sourav Ganguly, rather than Sachin, to be Dravids deputy. Once Sourav fitted into the side, he would have been a better deputy.

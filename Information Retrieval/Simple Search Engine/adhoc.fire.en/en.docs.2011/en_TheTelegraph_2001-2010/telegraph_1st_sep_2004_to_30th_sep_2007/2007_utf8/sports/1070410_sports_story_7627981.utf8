The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 How young will the young team be?

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Poor Suresh Raina is cursing his luck. Instead of looking forward to a recall, hes giving a post-surgery rehab programme the look-over. 

Ive recently had an operation on my left leg and its unlikely that Ill be available for Bangladesh, Raina told The Telegraph. 

Speaking from Lucknow on Monday afternoon, the 20-year-old added: Of course, Im getting the strength back, but I dont want to rush things Koi jaldi nahin dikhana hai 

Widely seen as former coach Greg Chappells blue-eyed boy, Raina wasnt picked for the World Cup and got injured during the National One-Dayers. 

Its that injury which forced surgery and has almost ruled him out of the May 10-29 tour featuring three ODIs and two Tests. 

Raina made his debut during the 2005-06 tri-series in Sri Lanka. He has totalled 612 runs from 36 matches. 

Incidentally, its not clear whether Dilip Vengsarkar and his colleagues (Venkatapathi Raju, Bhupinder Singh, Sanjay Jagdale and Ranjib Biswal) are going to select one squad or choose separate ones for ODIs and Tests. 

As the Boards working committee has directed the selectors to send a young team, theres speculation on who all will make it. 

Equally, whore the ones going to be rested/dropped. 

Apparently, its almost certain that Virender Sehwag and Ajit Agarkar wont be there. Then, Harbhajan Singh is under big pressure. As also Irfan Pathan, who didnt make the XI in the World Cup. 

There are whispers that Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly will be rested for the ODIs. But, right now, its nothing more than that. 

Ramesh Powar is certain to be brought back, while Dinesh Mongia probably stands a decent chance as newly-appointed cricket manager Ravi Shastri has a high opinion of him. 

Mongia is soon going to be 30, though. 

Quite a few rookies and young discards (listed in the graphic alongside) should come into he reckon ing. 

Bengals Manoj Tewari and Ranadeb Bose are among those with a pretty good chance.

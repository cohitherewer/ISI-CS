 Its hard to grasp 

 everything, says Lewis Hamilton

 - McLaren Rookie records maiden F1 win to take outright 

 lead in championship

 Tears mingled with champagne as Lewis Hamilton celebrated his entry into the Formula One winners circle (as reported in Mondays late city edition). His stunning drive ended with the embrace of an ecstatic McLaren team, who thronged Parc ferme to acclaim their rookie hero. 

An emotional Hamilton said: quot;It has been a quite fantastic day. This is history. To come here for the first time and win is unbelievable. For me, it has been a fantastic season already. Ive been ready to win for some time now. Ive had a feeling that it was just a matter of when and where. 

 quot;It is really hard to grasp everything. I feel like Im on a different planet right now. Going into this weekend I really did sense it was going to be my time. To get pole and win was a dream. It takes me to another level. quot; 

The first person Hamilton sought was his father Anthony, who has guided his sons career since the age of eight when he first put a pedal to the floor at a kart track while on holiday in Spain. 

 quot;I have to dedicate this one to my dad because without him it would not be possible, quot; Hamilton said. 

 quot;I could see him from the podium. He obviously had a tear in his eye. And I want to say hello to all my family back home, who I know were watching, the fans and the team back in Woking and Stuttgart. 

 quot;At the end I wanted to do cartwheels but I had to get the car home. It was extremely emotional driving back to the pits. The fans were unbelievable. quot; 

Hamiltons maiden win leaves him eight points clear at the top of the drivers championship, the biggest margin held by anyone this season. He expressed his sorrow for teammate Fernando Alonso, who endured a torrid afternoon, and his support for Robert Kubica, who crashed heavily, ending the afternoon in hospital with a broken leg. 

It is hard to imagine a more impressive debut in any sport, and to win on a day as chaotic as F1 experienced Sunday, underpinned the extraordinary quality Hamilton possesses. He promised to enjoy the moment before getting back to work in Indianapolis next weekend. quot;Over the last few laps I was just counting down. I usually push to the end but here it is such a tricky circuit, I took my time. One mistake here and you are in the marbles. 

 quot;The start was exciting too with Fernando flying past me at the first corner. It wasnt the best start by me. I dont know what happened. Then Fernando went wide. I didnt want that obviously. He went straight, I got a fantastic exit. After that it was a fairly smooth race for me. 

 quot;The team did a great job calling me in before the first safety car. Three times I had to build a lead. Each time the tyres and brakes get cold. It is so easy to put it into the wall in those situations. But I held it together until the end. quot;

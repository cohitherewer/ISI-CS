The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Guyanese accept 

harsh reality

Georgetown: With the local mosque decorated in the green and white of Pakistan, Wazim Karim dreamt of watching the Asian giants play in the World Cup Super Eight here. 

But like many others around the world, the 28-year-old was left devastated and angry after the early exit of Inzamam-ul Haqs men. 

Another fan, outraged by Pakistans shock departure, ripped up the 50 tickets he had bought for matches here. 

A chef by profession, Karim agreed to work as a volunteer at the tournament so that he could see the Pakistan team, who were scheduled to play three matches in Guyana, at close range. 

Instead, he had to settle for watching debutants Ireland begin their Super Eight campaign against England. 

For the Muslims of Guyana, it (Pakistans early exit) was a big wound, said Karim, sporting a Pakistan shirt. (AGENCIES)

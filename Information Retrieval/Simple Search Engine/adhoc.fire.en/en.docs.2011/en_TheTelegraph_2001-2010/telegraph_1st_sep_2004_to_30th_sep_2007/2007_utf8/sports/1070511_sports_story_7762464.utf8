 SA retain Smith and Arthur

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Despite the disappointing World Cup results, the Cricket South Africa has retained captain Graeme Smith and coach Mickey Arthur, awarding the duo new two-year contracts. 

South Africa, who went into the showpiece event as the top-ranked team, survived losing to Bangladesh to reach the semi-finals, but dismal batting saw them lose to eventual champions Australia. 

The board of directors of Cricket South Africa on Thursday decided to renew the contracts of Smith and Arthur for a further two years. Announcing this, CSA CEO Gerald Majola said the decision followed the expiration of their contracts after the World Cup. 

Smith (26) was appointed South Africa captain in March 2003 while Arthur (38) was appointed coach in May 2005. 

In a statement, Majola said: The board decided to renew the two-year contracts of Graeme Smith as captain and Mickey Arthur as coach because they spearheaded South Africas most successful season yet, despite the disappointing World Cup results. The board also decided to appoint a team manager, in addition to the logistics manager. 

Smith said: I am most grateful for the confidence shown in me by Cricket South Africa and I look forward to the challenges.

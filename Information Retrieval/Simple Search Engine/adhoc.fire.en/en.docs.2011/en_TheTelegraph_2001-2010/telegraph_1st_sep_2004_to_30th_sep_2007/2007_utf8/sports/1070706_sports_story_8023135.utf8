 Brazil, Chile in quarters 

 Robinho 

Puerto la Cruz: Defending champions Brazil beat Ecuador 1-0 to complete the quarter final line-up at the Copa America on Wednesday after Chile had also advanced to the last eight by holding Mexico to a goalless draw. 

The results mean that the US and Colombia, who each lost their opening two matches, were eliminated before meeting in their last game in Group C. 

Robinho, the only player to have scored for Brazil in the first round, notched his fourth goal of the tournament as his penalty gave his side a fortuitous win. 

Earlier, Chile and Mexico were booed off the field after opening the Group B double-header with a dismal match. 

Mexico topped Group B with seven points, followed by Brazil on six and Chile with four. Ecuador propped up the table after losing all three of their games. 

Chile qualified as the best of the two third-placed teams in the three groups and will meet Brazil again in their quarter final in Puerto La Cruz on Saturday. Hosts Venezuela will meet Uruguay, who finished as the second third-placed team, in San Cristobal the same day. The only issue to be sorted out is the order in which Paraguay and Argentina finish in Group C.

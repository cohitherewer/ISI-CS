 National A postponed after players protest

A CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES

Calcutta/Chennai: The 45th National A Chess Championship, scheduled to get underway in Chennai on Tuesday, got inaugurated but was then postponed indefinitely because of a players protest. 

The 44 players who had turned up for the meet were not happy with the accommodation provided to them. 

The players were furious that the Tamil Nadu Chess Association had arranged for their stay at St Josephs College, the venue of the meet some 30 km from the city. 

We were allotted hostel rooms in a college on the outskirts of Chennai which were not at all up to the mark, said a young Grandmaster. 

The organisers offered to shift the players to nearby hotels, which also didnt satisfy them. Then the players were offered Rs 5000 each to find alternative accommodation for 13 days. 

Even the person who had come to receive me at the airport got down on the way and asked me to proceed to the venue and pay the driver Rs 350 We certainly deserve a better deal, added the GM. 

All India Chess Federation (AICF) secretary D.V. Sundar said: The players were unhappy with the accommodation... You see the National A is no longer restricted to 15 players, we have close to 50 players now. We even offered them money to find accommodation themselves, but the players were still not happy. So we decided to postpone the meet indefin-itely. 

The AICF will have to announce fresh dates. We will have to hold the championship before January or February, said Sundar. 

Dibyendu Barua, president of the Chess Players Association of India, termed the incident unfort-unate. 

Its a loss for everyone as the players had come from different parts of the country to play, said the GM.

 Form teams making an opening statement 

 Matthew Hayden 

St Johns: The World Cup is turning into a showcase for top opening batsmen. 

Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and South Africa are being led from the front and living up to their billing as likely World Cup semi-finalists. 

The wickets in the Caribbean are, once any early moisture has evaporated from the pitch, offering batsmen a friendly track on which to hit big scores. All openers need to do, it seems, is survive the first few overs and then take advantage. 

Each of the form teams so far has a player at the top of the order capable of patiently negotiating the tricky opening spell before hitting out to up the pace and help their teams to big totals. 

Australias Matthew Hayden, South Africas Graeme Smith, Sri Lankas Sanath Jayasuriya and New Zealands Stephen Fleming have dominated attacks to fill the first four places in the run-scoring charts. 

Since ending his international retirement, the 37-year-old Jayasuriya hit his sixth century against the West Indies on Sunday. His team would almost certainly not be challenging for a place in the top four of the Super Eight without him. 

He has been amazing, Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene said. He is working harder, has a great attitude and is enjoying his cricket. 

Hayden, who has a tournament high 395 runs from five innings, was out of Australias team for about a year and had to struggle to get back his place in time for the World Cup. He hit 158 to set up victory over the West Indies and a 66-ball century against South Africa, the quickest ever at the World Cup. 

I had a lot commitment and passion to get back in the one-day squad, Hayden said. If we keep working hard, I cant see why we cant keep improving throughout this tournament. 

New Zealand captain Fleming hit an unbeaten 102 off 92 balls in Mondays nine-wicket win over Bangladesh to take his team level with Australia atop the Super Eight standings. 

It took Fleming to 280 runs for the tournament and could give the Black Caps an edge if qualification for the semi-finals has to be decided by run rate. 

I felt my form in this World Cup has been outstanding, Fleming said. Im striking the ball well, generating a good strike rate and it was good to push on from 40, 50, 60 and get something substantial. 

England are one side that has struggled to get used to conditions, their openers fulfilling their brief to start solidly but not going on to get to a big total. 

Openers Michael Vaughan and Ed Joyce scored a total seven and 76 respectively in the past two matches against Kenya and Ireland. An inability to get on top of aggressive opening bowling may be exposed further when they come up against the likes of Australia and South Africa. 

Theres always a lot of talk about power plays and being aggressive at the top of the order, captain Vaughan said. Where we have struggled, is that weve not got players to 100.

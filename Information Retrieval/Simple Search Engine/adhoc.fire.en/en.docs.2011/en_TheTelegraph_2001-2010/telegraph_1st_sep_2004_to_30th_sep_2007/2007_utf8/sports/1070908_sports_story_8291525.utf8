 Indians struggle in Round I

Crans Montana (Switzerland): The tough back nine at the Crans-sur-Sierre Golf Club was agonising for the Indian trio as all three went over-par in the first round of the Omega European Masters. 

While Shiv Kapur (72) was lying 41st, Jeev Milkha Singh was 68th with a 74 and Jyoti Randhawa (75) was tied 90th. 

Welshman Bradley Dredge began with a fine round in his attempt to defend the Omega European Masters when he soared into the lead by holing his second shot on the par four sixth. 

He ended the day at five-under 66 and opened an early two stroke advantage over second-placed Mikko Ilonen and three others, Marcus Fraser, Eduardo Romero and Oliver Wilson. 

Kapur was lying 41st after his first day effort of one-over 72. He went four-over for three holes between the 16th and 18th including a double on the latter but made up with an eagle on first and another birdie on sixth and ended the day at one-over 72. He had a total of three birdies, including back to back efforts on 14th and 15th, an eagle on first and four bogeys and one double bogey. 

Jeev had two birdies and two bogeys on front nine, and then went under par with a third birdie on 11th. But he bogeyed four times between the 13th and 17th and finished at three-over 74, which placed him 68th and close to the cut line. (PTI)

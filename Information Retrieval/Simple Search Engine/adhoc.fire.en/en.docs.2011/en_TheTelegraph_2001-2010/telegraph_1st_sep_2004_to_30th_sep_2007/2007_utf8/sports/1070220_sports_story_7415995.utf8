 Fittest team will have edge: Ian Chappell

Melbourne: Former Australian captain Ian Chappell has said the teams comprising the fittest players had a chance to win the coveted trophy in the Caribbean. 

Will we see a spectacular World Cup unfold over the next two months in the Caribbean or will it turn out to be the well cup, a trophy clinched by the team fortunate enough to have 11 men still standing? Chappell said. 

He said the ICC had yet to strike the right balance between the number of lead-up tournaments and giving players enough time to recover to ensure they were in peak physical and mental condition for the Cup. (PTI)

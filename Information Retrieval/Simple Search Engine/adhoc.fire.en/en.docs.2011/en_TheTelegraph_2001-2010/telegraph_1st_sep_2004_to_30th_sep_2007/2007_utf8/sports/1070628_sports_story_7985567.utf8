 Grin and bear it on courts

Martin Johnson

Exposure to the elements may have raised the Centre Court fur muffler count to record levels, but expressions of sympathy would have been hard to find out in the boondocks of Courts 15-17 on Tuesday. It was so cold out there that when a voice called out, New balls please, you looked around to see if the request had come from the umpire or a brass monkey. 

This is where exasperated parents threaten to take a whining child If you dont behave, Ill take you to watch Miss Ozegovic versus Miss Groenefeld and where the only bonus is, if it rains, you can rest easy in the knowledge that there is no prospect of a visit by Cliff Richard. 

Well, maybe not the only bonus. The poor souls on Centre and No. 1 are stuck with what the order of play committee have decreed for them, while out in what you might call Wimbledons back yard, youre spoiled for choice. Everywhere you go you can hear conversations along the lines of: I like the look of Miss Likhovtseva playing Miss Camerin on Court 15, but Miss Sequera versus Miss Schruff on Court 16 is pretty tempting as well. 

These courts accommodate around a couple of hundred spectators, and the fact that most of the seats are occupied is proof that people dont come to Wimbledon to watch tennis. They come here to say that theyve been. Its an I was there experience. 

In the US they call them hot dog matches, as in: Whos next on? Er, lets see now. Ah yes. Miss T Sun, of China, versus Miss E Loit, of France. OK, sounds like a good time to go and get a hot dog then. The minor court matches would be far more interesting for the spectators if they sat down to watch them with a copy of the Official Players Guide. 

The crowds began to thin as the afternoon wore on, and Court 15 is more or less deserted by the time the third game came on. There are matches for which Wimbledon spectators will willingly risk being turned into human icicles, but J. Kunitsyn, of Russia, versus Y-T Yang, of Taipei, clearly isnt one of them.

 Subcontinent players lack discipline: Donald

London: Former South African bowler Allan Donald believes that subcontinent cricketers lack discipline which often resulted in a rift with their coaches. 

Citing the fall-out between the Indians and Australian Greg Chappell who guided them for two years till the World Cup, Donald said the players might have had their share of blame. 

From what I have seen, it looked like the Indian players enjoyed Greg Chappells company but there were some issues which got blown out of proportion... It could have something to do with the role of the coach as most of the players just want to go their own way and play as they like to, Donald wrote in a website. 

At the highest level, the coachs word should be taken as final but it seems that there is a lack of discipline here. 

The Indian and Pakistani players always seem to have some issue or the other with their coaches. 

Donald, who has been appointed as a short-term bowling consultant of the England team, urged the Indians to strike a good rapport with whoever was appointed to guide them in place of Chappell. 

For the coach to function smoothly, particularly if he is from some other country, the senior players should back him, wrote the first South African to claim 300 Test scalps. 

In South Africa, too, when Bob Woolmer were the coach there were some problems initially, but the seniors backed him and soon everything was settled.

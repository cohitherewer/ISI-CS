The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Task cut out for Md. Sp. 

 Basudeb will be key for Mohammedan Sporting 

Mumbai: Absence of several key players will haunt Mohammedan Sporting coach Biswajit Bhattacharya as JCT Football Club are going to seek revenge against the Calcutta opponents in their Round X match of the ONGC Cup National Football League here on Wednesday. 

Mohammedan Sporting are now placed ninth in the 10-team table with just seven points and their only win so far came against JCT in Ludhiana. 

However, task is absolutely cut out for the black and white brigade since defender Madhab Das and Nigerian Eric Mputu will miss the match due to two yellow cards and forward Bijen Singh is out with a collar bone fracture sustained during practice. 

JCT, who went down narrowly to reigning champions Mahindra United in their last match, are currently in the seventh position with nine points. 

More importantly, JCT will be at full strength and looking to settle score with Bhattacharyas side for that first-round 1-2 setback. 

Without Madhab, Bhattacharya may adopt a 4-5-1 strategy with Jatin Bisht playing in the hole between defence and midfield. The coach also pointed out that settling for a point would be his priority but he would also rely on counter-attacks. 

In this scenario, Basudeb Mondal may figure in the starting XI and his inviting forward passes could be key to Mohammedan Sportings success. (Agencies)

 Warne reunites with Simone

Melbourne: Shane Warnes efforts at wooing back his estranged wife Simone have finally paid off as she has agreed to reunite with the Aussie spin legend and move to England with their three children. 

Quoting a source close to the couple, a British daily reported that Warne and Simone have flown to England to start life afresh. 

The couple is reportedly set to settle down in Hampshire as Warne still has a couple of years left in his contract with the County side. 

Shane and Simone have been working out their differences and you can draw your own conclusions from that, a source close to the couple said. 

Warne was last year divorced by Simone after a string of extra-marital affairs and had been trying to win her back ever since bidding adieu to international cricket. 

The couple continued to live together even after divorce and enjoyed several holidays with their children before deciding to reunite.

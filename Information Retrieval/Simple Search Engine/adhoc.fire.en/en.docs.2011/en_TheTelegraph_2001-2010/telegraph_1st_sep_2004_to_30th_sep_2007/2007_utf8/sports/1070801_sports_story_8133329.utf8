The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Icing on the cake will be series win

Guest Column

As I watched India sail to victory at Trent Bridge on Tuesday, a feeling of nostalgia overwhelmed me. The icing on the cake for Rahul Dravid and his boys would, obviously, be a series victory. 

Comparing this with the 1971 triumph at The Oval would not be proper. This team is better balanced with a superb batting line-up and intimidating seam attack. But we had an advantage in having excellent close-in fielders and spinners. 

We landed in England with our confidence sky-high, having just returned from a series victory in the West Indies. We had world class spinners, but not quality pacers to make use of the conditions. That made me a bit circumspect at the start. 

Fortunately, we had enough practice matches. Unlike this team, we played ten matches against different Counties. Mostly importantly, everyone contributed and was eager to prove themselves. 

England, then, were far superior to Michael Vaughans men. They had just beaten Australia in the Ashes and were regarded as the No.1 side. 

A draw in the opening Test at Lords gave a boost to our confidence. The Manchester Test too ended in a stalemate. The Oval game has gone down in history as Chandrasekhars match. 

After having conceded a first innings lead, we werent too confident of a positive result, but Chandras six for 38 brought us back into the match. We knew the wicket had bounce and would turn as the match wore on. 

One interesting fact about Chandra was that if he didnt get a wicket in his first couple of overs, his bowling would go haywire. Luckily, he got Edrich in his first over and never looked back. 

Chandras aggression rubbed off on the whole team and we won by four wickets. Despite losing the openers early, we managed to reach the 173-run target with ease. 

Todays win will also give Dravid and Co. the confidence to win the series. The batsmen just need to adjust a little more to the conditions. With their experience, that wont be much of a problem. 

I have also been impressed with the way Wasim Jaffer and Dinesh Karthik batted in the first innings. They laid the foundation for the victory. 

England have been left shaken by Zaheer Khan. Rudra Pratap Singh and Sreesanths aggro have also taken them by surprise. Im sure history will repeat itself at The Oval.

 Ghei moves up to joint third spot

Jakarta: Gaurav Ghei sank three birdies in the last four holes to get into tied third place, even as Shiv Kapur and S.S.P. Chowrasia slipped on the second day of the Indonesian Open here on Friday. 

On a day interrupted by lightning, storm and later suspended due to failing light, Ghei shot a two-under 69 and moved to five-under 137 and was three behind leader Australias Andrew Tampion (66). 

Kapur had three birdies in his first eight hole, besides one bogey but thereafter just could not manage another birdie and also gave in two other bogeys and ended at 73 and two-under 140 for 36 holes. 

Kapur was tied 18th with Chowrasia, who was one-over for the day through 16 holes and had two more to go. He was also at two-under and tied 18th. 

Amandeep Johl (76) went to six-over for 36 holes and Rahil Gangjee was even par after 15 holes.

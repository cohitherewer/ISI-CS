 AI host JCT today

Mumbai: Air India, who lost their last match, would obviously like to produce a much better performance against JCT in the NFL at the Cooperage on Tuesday. 

Having done reasonably well in the earlier matches to stay among the top-five of the standings with 10 points, Air Indias impressive unbeaten run at home ended last week with a reversal against holders Mahindra United. 

JCT, despite looking good with their approach play, have failed to translate the pressure into goals so far. Consequently, they are languishing second from bottom.JCT will be without defenders Narinder Singh and Harpreet Singh, both of whom have knee injuries. 

Pitted against a team which can be dangerous from set-piece situations, Air India at the heart of the defence would miss the experience and expertise of Suley Musah, who is out with two yellow cards. (PTI)

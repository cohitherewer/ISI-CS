 SHARP SINGLES 

Free for all party

 Bridgetown: The World Cups organisers finally got it right on Sunday. Faced by a game involving the two weakest teams of the Super Eight in the stadium which will be used for the final, the organisers knew thousands of seats in the 23,000 capacity Kensington Oval would be embarrassingly empty for the meeting of Bangladesh and Ireland.

So they let the locals in for nothing and the result was the noisy, colourful crowd that Caribbean cricket is famous for.

Comeback game

Decades after the countrys British colonial masters departed, taking their game with them, cricket is making a comeback.

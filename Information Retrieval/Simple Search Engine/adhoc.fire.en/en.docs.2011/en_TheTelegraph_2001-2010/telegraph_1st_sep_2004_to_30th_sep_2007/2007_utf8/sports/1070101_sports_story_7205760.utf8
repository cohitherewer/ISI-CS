Sydney: Batsman Michael Hussey wants Tom Moody to succeed John Buchanan as Australias next coach when the job becomes vacant after the World Cup in April, reports said on Sunday. 

The former Australian allrounder has been coaching Sri Lanka for 18 months and been widely credited with the sides recent good form, including 11 wins from their past 13 one-day Internationals. 

I know Tom well, Hussey told a newspaper. Hes a fantastic guy and very knowledgeable about the game of cricket. 

It would be great if he got the job. Hes got good experience in England, coaching and playing played for Australia and now coaching the Sri Lankan team and doing great things with them. 

Hussey said he spoke to Moody in India during the recent Champions Trophy. He was very focused on the Sri Lankan team, trying to get them to play well at the World Cup and wasnt looking beyond there. 

Others in line to replace Buchanan include Bennett King, now coaching the West Indies, and Tim Nielsen, who took over from King at Australian crickets Centre of Excellence. Former Australian captain Greg Chappell, currently coaching India, has also been touted among the possible replacements. 

Meanwhile, Englands Kevin Pietersen has hit back over suggestions by Buchanan that he is not a team player. 

Buchanan said on Friday he noticed Pietersen always fielded in the outfield away from his teammates and that he was one of five players who did not attend the squads Christmas Day lunch. 

Pietersen was quoted in British media on Sunday as saying: They obviously want to win 5-0 and maybe hes trying to get into my head to make me wonder if I am a lone ranger which I am not. We are a team.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Now, CAB to get BCCI grants 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: With Jagmohan Dalmiya out of the way, the BCCI has decided to lift the freeze on grants and subsidies that had been held back since last year. 

The BCCI, at its working committee meeting today (in New Delhi), decided to release the grants and assured us of all help in the future, CAB president Prasun Mukherjee said on Wednesday. 

The BCCI seems to be going all out to co-operate with the CAB following Dalmiyas resignation as CAB president. All I can say is, it was a personal issue between Mr Dalmiya and the BCCI. After he left, the BCCI has perhaps softened its stance towards the state association, Mukherjee said. 

The city police chief added that the CAB is an affiliated unit of the BCCI and is doing what a parent body should. It is unfair to victimise an association for one individual, so I had written to them in detail and they have come back with good news for the CAB as well as the sports-loving public of the state, Mukherjee stated. 

Mukherjee couldnt attend the meeting in New Delhi on Wednesday. We couldnt send anyone for the meeting owing to the match here, but we did send our suggestions on Tuesday Niranjan Shah called me up a while earlier to let us know about the decision, Mukherjee informed, adding that the release of grants has been very satisfying for him personally. 

Meanwhile, two local masseurs Pintu Basak and Gautam Adak Chowdhury may assist Team India players on a request from Sourav Ganguly. The official masseur of the team from the tour of Pakistan in January 2006 is Ramesh Mane of Mumbai.

 Shastri: Seniors are not a spent force 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Greg Chappells mantra of commitment to excellence involved a strict regime. Ravi Shastri, by contrast, has decided to incorporate the fun factor. 

According to Team Indias cricket manager, Rahul Dravid amp; Co. were doing a nine-to-five desk job over the past six months. Its time for them to enjoy the game. 

Shastri also batted for under-pressure seniors like Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Virender Sehwag, refusing to buy the suggestion that they were a spent force. 

Give them some time and you will see what they are capable of, he said on the eve of the ODI squads departure for Bangladesh. 

The media, looking for juicy quotes from Shastri during his first interaction since taking charge, had to return disappointed. 

Thats not my business, said Shastri when his opinion was sought on the contracts issue. 

He did, however, take a dig at Chappell. 

I didnt like the way the team played over the last six months, Shastri said. It was as if they were doing a desk job sitting behind a computer from nine to five, rather than enjoying what they did. It is a sport, which is played in the open. If you dont enjoy what you are doing, you can forget about winning. 

Speaking for the seniors, Shastri said: If you guys have any doubts over Sachin, or for that matter Sehwag, you will be in for a surprise. It may not come immediately... give them some time and you will see what they are capable of... Sachin is hungry. They are not finished yet by any means. 

He also dismissed talk of factionalism in the team. What do you think? You guys have been looking at the players from outside. Did the guys look unhappy? Did you see any groups? he asked. 

I have seen a lot of things being written and said over the last few days. You guys are seeing something different. 

The camaraderie out there is unbelievable. Even when I took this job, I was made to read and believe something else, but it took me an hour to find out what these guys are made of. They are a brilliant bunch and their privacy should be respected. 

Much like his playing days, he offered a straight bat to the tricky ones. 

Is he happy with the itinerary, which doesnt have any practice game before the ODIs and Tests? We know that so well go there and be ready for the game. 

On Sachin and Souravs absence from the one-day squad, he said: I have got the team that has been given to me, and we will go there and play cricket. 

He also brushed aside the issue of being on the committee to select a new coach. Cricket camp, please, was his quick retort. 

He did not forget to compliment Sourav. I have known him from a young age and we played a lot of cricket together. I know what kind of a cricketer he is and what he is capable of. Please respect the guys for what they have done over the past many years. 

He signed off with a warning to Bangladesh. 

The series against Bangladesh is a challenge. After the World Cup it is not only the people of India who are disappointed the players are more disappointed than anybody else. Make no mistake about that. They will want to prove a point now.

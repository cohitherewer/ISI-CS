 United to start title defence vs Reading 

London: Manchester United will begin the defence of their Premier League title with a home game against Reading, while Newcastle manager Sam Allardyce will return to former club Bolton on the opening day of the season. 

The Premier League on Thursday released its fixtures for 2007-08 season, which starts August 11. Of the promoted clubs, Birmingham are at Chelsea, Sunderland host Tottenham and Derby play Portsmouth at Pride Park. 

United won their ninth Premier League title and 16th overall with two games to spare. Chelsea were second, Liverpool third and Arsenal fourth. 

Reading were the surprise club last season during their first stint in the Premier League. They finished eighth, just missing qualification for the Uefa Cup. (AP)

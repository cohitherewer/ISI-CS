The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A different Aussie battle

Montego Bay: Sri Lanka coach Tom Moody has found himself part of a not-so-cosy Australian club in the World Cup Group B. 

Moody will soon be taking on fellow Aussie coaches Dav Whatmore (Bangladesh) and Greg Chappell (India) in ties later this month. 

The pool has been called the Group of Death because Bangladesh are seen as the one team who could surprise and reach the Super Eights against expectations. 

The fourth team in the group are genuine minnows Bermuda, coached by ex-West Indies batsman Gus Logie. They were bowled out for 45 against England in a warm-up match. It makes no difference who the opponents coach is to me, Moody said, before what may be his final Sri Lanka assignment unless he signs a new contract after the tournament. 

I dont know what their thoughts are but I suppose my only concern is that of the Sri Lankan team and the management that surrounds that team.The other coaches may be Australian but Im not interested in any perceived private battles like that. 

World Cup winner in 1999 Moody, Australian batting great Chappell and former Sri Lanka coach Whatmore are three of five Australian coaches tied to the nine Test teams. 

John Buchanan is with his native Australia, before he vacates the position for another Australian Tim Nielsen after the tournament. Bennett King coaches the West Indies. 

Moody is not surprised that there are so many Australian coaches in the top echelon of international cricket, who come together for the World Cup in the Caribbean. 

Its because of the success of the past decade or so of Australia, Moody said. In coaching I think the Australian approach is what a lot of people are looking for. That straight forwardness that, I suppose, Australians are renowned for and people who are making decisions and getting coaches in place tend to be attracted to that style. 

The former Worcestershire and Western Australia allrounder, though, is not so sure whether Australian coaches will always be so prevalent in the near future. 

He thinks that signs of a gradual Australia decline could change the Australian coach culture in world cricket. 

However, he did qualify such a decline by saying they may start winning 2-1 rather than 5-0, and may draw more matches. 

Who knows what will happen but there has been a huge shock and wake-up call for Australia and for the game, because no one has seen Australia lose so many consecutive games for many years, Moody said. 

Whether that will widen the trend of coaches world-wide, time will only tell. The other point is that what England have done over the past five or six years is to invest a lot of money in coaching and that may pay dividends in the next generation. (Reuters)

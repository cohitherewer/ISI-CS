The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Viva Kerala upset Air India 

Ludhiana: Viva Kerala, promoted to the top division of the National Football League, came from behind to beat Air India 2-1 to make the Federation Cup quarter finals. 

The custodians of both teams would like to forget the encounter at the Guru Nanak Stadium as their blunders led to all three goals. 

Sanju Pradhan scored for Air India in 15 minutes while Satish Kumar equalised four minutes before half-time. S. James Singh scored the winner through a free-kick in the 68th. 

Hringsolal Thomte found Pradhan, whose shot went in through the legs of embarrassed keeper Purushottaman T.G. 

Raju Ekka in the Air India goal returned the favour in the 41st minute to Viva. A hard shot from distance by Bimal Barua was spilled by Ekka and Satish slotting home the rebound. 

The goal energised Viva, the club formed just three years ago with financial contribution from football-loving non-resident Keralites. 

Air India conceded a free-kick just outside their box. James curled his free-kick over the defensive wall and into the top corner, with Ekka leaving the near post vacant. (PTI)

 Well prove were worth it: Henin

 - Top women players laud Wimbledon move to offer equal prize money 

MARK HODGKINSON

The following are what the prominent women players had to say on the All England Club offering equal prize money to women for the first time in Wimbledons history (in alphabetical order): 

JUSTINE HENIN (rank 1, seed 1): Its a very big honour to be playing at Wimbledon this year, the first year that equal prize money is being paid for women and men. Wimbledon is one of the most well-known sporting events in the world, and for the organisers to take this important step is a huge one to progress the issue of equality worldwide. I know all the players appreciate the hard work that has gone into making equality a reality and Im sure well prove why we deserve to be treated the same as the men. 

ANA IVANOVIC (rank 6, seed 6): After I reached the French Open final there was an amazing reception for Novak Djokovic, Jelena Jankovic and myself in Belgrade. There were many children there and its truly overwhelming to think that we are inspiring them in our own way to achieve their goals. When I think about this, the importance of this decision to award women equal prize money becomes clearer, because girls should not be told they deserve less than guys. 

JELENA JANKOVIC (rank 3, seed 3): I was very happy to hear about this years equal prize money on offer at Wimbledon. I am sure that it is this type of progressive approach that we need in tennis. Beyond this game, I hope other sports, too, and industries will follow this example and offer women equal opportunities as well. 

AMELIE MAURESMO (rank 4, seed4): On the eve of the historic 2007 Championships, I feel extremely honoured and proud to be defending the Wimbledon crown. Each athlete who comes to these lawn tennis courts has a story to tell. Our histories and origins cover an extensive variation of experience and culture. Still, we are all united by a common bond that makes no distinction between genders. From our early years we have trained and worked hard to earn a place at Wimbledon. The privilege of being able to compete at the highest level is one which we will treasure and never take for granted. We share the ultimate dream of making it through, match after match, so that on the final weekend we can hold up the champions trophy. 

MARIA SHARAPOVA (rank 2, seed 2): Its pretty amazing to think that for the first time in the history of Wimbledon, the women will be receiving equal prize money. It is going to be incredible for all of us playing the event this year, and who have dreamed of playing in and winning Wimbledon since we were little girls. That is what is most special about achieving equality the positive signal that it will send the world over to the next generation of girls dreaming of winning Wimbledon or becoming a scientist or going to the moon as an astronaut. 

SERENA WILLIAMS (rank 7, seed 7): Ive always said that we practice just as hard as the men and entertain the fans just as well as them, so why shouldnt we be treated the same? It is always a wonderful feeling coming back to London for the Championships every year, but its even more special to be returning this time. Wimbledon is very much about history and tradition, but its so nice to see that it is also about being dynamic and forward-thinking. 

VENUS WILLIAMS (rank 31, seed 24): Equality is an issue I feel really strongly about, which is why I am working hard with Unesco to promote gender equality and opportunities for women. Im really proud to have played a role in helping my fellow players on the WTA Tour to achieve parity at Wimbledon with the men, and Im equally proud of the All England Club for making this decision. Having won Wimbledon three times, this tournament has a very special place in my heart. It would be unbelievable to be there again on final day in such a historic year for this phenomenal event.

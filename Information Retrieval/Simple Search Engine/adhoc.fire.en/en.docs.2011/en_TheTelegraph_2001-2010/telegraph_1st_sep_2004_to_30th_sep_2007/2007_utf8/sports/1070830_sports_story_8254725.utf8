 Justine cruises into third round, Ana made to toil

 Russian Ana Ivanovic celebrates her win over Aravane Rezai of France on Wednesday 

New York: Fifth seed Ana Ivanovic recovered from a slow start to beat Aravane Rezai of France 6-3, 6-1 to reach the third round of the US Open on Wednesday. 

The 19-year-old Serb trailed 1-3 in the opening set but stormed back to set up a meeting with the winner of the all-Russian clash between Vera Dushevina and Ekaterina Bychkova. 

Also to make third round were top seed Justine Henin and Venus Williams. 

While Henin eased past Bulgarian qualifier Tsvetana Pironkova with a 6-4, 6-0 win, Venus battled past Ioana Raluca Olaru of Romania 6-4, 6-2. 

Former champion Marat Safin came through a tough opener to beat in-form Canadian qualifier Frank Dancevic 7-5, 7-6, 7-6 in their first-round match. 

The Russian, who won the title in 2000 and is seeded 25th this year, battled back from 2-5 down in the second set and saved a set point in the third-set tiebreak to advance after two hours, 25 minutes. 

World No. 69 Dancevic, who reached the quarter finals of the Montreal Masters Series this month, served for both the second and third sets but could not close out the win. 

Safin clinched victory with his 19th ace and now plays either fellow-Russian Evgeny Korolev or Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka. 

Earlier on Tuesday, Maria Sharapovas dazzling play matched her eye-catching attire as the Russian opened the defence of her crown in impeccably stylish fashion. 

Sporting a flaming red dress with over 600 Swarovski crystals on the bodice, second-seeded Sharapova needed just 50 minutes to see off Italys world No. 51 Roberta Vinci 6-0, 6-1 and move into the second round. 

Every corner I turn here I get goose bumps because of all the great memories, Sharapova said. When you come back to the place where you won your second major its incredible. 

Sharapova said she thought she did everything solid in her victory over Vinci on Arthur Ashe Stadium. 

Shes a pretty quick opponent, rushing from side to side, the Russian said. A couple of years ago, those types of opponents would have been difficult on me. 

But I feel like Im a much more patient player now. 

The diminutive Italian said she had not practised for three days prior to the match. 

Fifth seeded Andy Roddick and fellow American, sixth seed James Blake, also advanced to the second round with straight-set victories. 

Roddick swept past fellow American Justin Gimelstob 7-6, 6-3, 6-3 to reach the second round. Fifth seed Roddick, the 2003 champion and runner-up last year, belted 17 aces and 59 winners in the victory, which took just under two hours. 

Gimelstob, who had lost all eight of his matches in 2007 as he struggled to recover from back surgery last year, was two points away from taking the first-set tiebreaker when he aced Roddick for a 5-3 lead. 

Roddick roared back, however, winning the next three points on his way to capturing the tiebreaker 8-6. 

There were few upsets on the second day of the final Grand Slam of the year, played under sunny skies in the day and with a cool, comfortable breeze during the evening. 

The most notable upset of the day had ninth seed Daniela Hantuchova sent packing by Ukrainian Julia Vakulenko 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, marking the 24-year-old Slovaks earliest exit at Flushing Meadows since her 2001 debut. 

Elsewhere, 2004 Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova whipped Czech Klara Zakopalova 6-2, 6-3 while 1997 winner Martina Hingis bounced Frenchwoman Mathilde Johansson 6-0, 6-3. 

Other winners included sixth seed Anna Chakvetadze, No. 11 seed Patty Schnyder, 13th seed Nicole Vaidisova and No. 26 Sania Mirza. 

On the mens side, 2001 champion Lleyton Hewitt rolled over Amer Delic 6-2, 6-4, 6-2, while third seed Novak Djokovic looked like a legitimate threat to end Roger Federers three-year reign with a 6-2, 6-1, 6-3 victory over Robin Haase.

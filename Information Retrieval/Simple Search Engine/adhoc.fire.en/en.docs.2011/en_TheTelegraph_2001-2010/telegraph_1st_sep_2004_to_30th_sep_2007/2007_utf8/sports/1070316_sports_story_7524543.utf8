The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Australians needed this overwhelming display

 MARK NICHOLAS

Unsurprisingly, Australia gave Scotland an awful whipping in St Kitts on Wednesday. Not that the 203-run margin of victory endorsed the case against the minnows. Scotland fought magnificently, reminding everyone that there was a simple charm to the game rarely seen in the more intense atmosphere of the international merry-go-round. Only the Scots level of talent was exposed and that, against the outrageous gifts possessed by the Australians, is no disgrace. 

Having been put in to bat on a slow but true pitch, Matthew Hayden confirmed the recovery of his big toe with an occasionally brutal 60, while Adam Gilchrist was, well, Adam Gilchrist at his riveting best. 

He simply sauntered along, happy to feel bat upon ball before ambition overrode good sense and dear old Dougie Brown rejoiced in the raising of the umpires finger. 

Hayden, Gilchrists partner for so long, is some batsman when that powerful chest is out and the strut is on. 

The bullying left-handers last knock was a month ago against New Zealand in Hamilton where he made 181, so he is in reasonable touch. 

Hayden is not the sort to let a broken toe upset his rhythm, nor an Achilles heel. You know most of the strokes straight drives, pulls, whacks over mid-on, heaves over square-leg but now square cuts and drives have been added to the repertoire to counter bowlers who probe at a one-time weakness wide of his off-stump. It took a fine ball to stop his march a perfect off-break by Majid Haq and Haydens departure indicated a man who wanted much more. 

One sensed Australia needed this overwhelming display, a cathartic restoration of order in their own minds. At the toss, Ponting responded to a question about his teams slip in the rankings with a curt, yeah, well were favourites to win the World Cup, so you dont want to read too much into that. 

And then he made a sparkling hundred. He really has become a fantastic batsman, one capable of any challenge thanks to an increasingly wide range of strokes, wonderful footwork and the strongest mind. 

Of his own volition, probably since the loss of the Ashes in England, Ponting has become the fulcrum of the Australian team. Without him, the aura goes and the thinking becomes confused. He hates losing like few others and when he narrows his eyes, all hell is unleashed. 

Quite why Australia lost direction so badly in February is a mystery. Certainly, the players began to take winning for granted. John Buchanan, the coach, went as far as to suggest that the opposition England and New Zealand were not doing enough to stretch his team. Be careful what you wish for, John. 

England jumped all over the arrogance, at first without Ponting in the side and then after the injury to Andrew Symonds. Perhaps the recovery of the Ashes took more out of the Australians than they realised and by the time they were finally made to knuckle down, there was nothing left in the tank. 

The inevitability of Englands win the second final in Sydney was a sight to behold, as much because of Australias fall from the perch as of Englands sudden competence. Maybe it was the wheel of fortune that spun for England at last or maybe there is less between the teams than it had seemed when Australia were playing with such confidence. 

The beating the Aussies then suffered in New Zealand raised Pontings stock even higher for he was at home in Sydney at the time, resting an aching back. 

What became apparent was Australias vulnerability and, if not quite their dependence on Ponting and Symonds, then at least their need for one of them to be on hand. With both, the old fear factor may return but Symonds is an unknown at present and his fitness is a huge risk. If he plays too soon, he may do so as a diminished force which benefits the opponents more than the man himself. 

The obvious concern for Ponting must be the uncertainty about his best team. Shane Watson had a good enough day in St Kitts but he lacks presence. 

The Brads, Hodge and Hogg, cannot be sure how the selectors are thinking though both played with verve on Wednesday. 

Shaun Tait or Stuart Clark? What of Mitchell Johnson? When should Symonds first have an outing? Such issues prey on a team for it holds them back from becoming exactly that, a team.

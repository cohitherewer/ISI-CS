The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Indians wary of facing the music back home

 Rahul Dravid leaves for the airport in Port of Spain 

Port of Spain: Their World Cup dreams shattered and personal reputations in tatters, Team India hit the home-bound route with heavy hearts and full of apprehensions about a possible backlash from millions of dejected fans. 

It was a gloomy Tuesday noon and the team lined up outside the hotel on their way back. When a fan approached them for autographs, the grim reality hit them in the guts. 

Dont tell me you still need our autographs, said Mahendra Singh Dhoni with a sigh, reflecting on the disastrous World Cup campaign. 

Dhoni, whose under-construction house in Ranchi has come under attack, could well imagine the kind of reception awaiting the team and it was of little consolation when the fan said, you cricketers are heroes and would remain heroes. 

It only deflated Dhoni further and the stumper said, we are down, dont break us even more. 

Near him stood his good friend Irfan Pathan, who sported a different profile from the one with which he had come to the West Indies. The allrounder now has his head completely shaved. 

Somewhere down the corridor was Ajit Agarkar who made a telling, poignant remark: Its the first time when we really are in no hurry to go back home. 

Usually, we look forward to a tour finishing quickly so that we can return home. But this is different. 

Virender Sehwag, phlegmatic at best of times, was at hand encouraging his teammates to take the matter in their stride. 

He was encouraging everyone to hold their ground and face any situation which might confront them in India. 

Elsewhere, captain Rahul Dravid was looking surprisingly relaxed, a person who perhaps has come to terms with Indias debacle. A pragmatic, positive man at the best of times, Dravid, it seems, has lost little time in regaining his poise. 

Coach Greg Chappell appeared with wife Judy, the India blazer, flung carelessly across his forearm. 

Harbhajan Singh was his usual self, but clearly disappointed at how things have shaped up. He looked up at heavens and wondered what the gods had in store for them. 

As the bus began to move, one could spot Sourav Ganguly, plugged into songs on his iPod. It was as if he was preparing himself for the music his fellow cricketers, or he, could face back home. 

Meanwhile, leg-spinner Anil Kumble is expected to formally announce his retirement from one-day cricket once the team returns home.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Question mark over EB galleries

 - Big Three to start from July 29 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The CFL Premier Division fixtures are finally ready, though they will not be released before a meeting with the eight participating teams on Wednesday. 

The Premier Division will get underway on July 26, with the Big Three opening their campaigns on the last three days of July. Mohammedan Sporting, it was learnt, will be the first to take the field on July 29, followed by East Bengal and Mohun Bagan. 

IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly met police officials on Tuesday with a copy of the fixtures to seek approval. 

DC Headquarters Gyanwant Singh advised Ganguly to go ahead with the matches, but expressed deep concern over the East Bengal ground. 

Mohammedan Sporting ground is fine, even Mohun Bagan But the condition of the East Bengal galleries is not good at all. They hadnt done any work till the other day. Now they want to complete two months work in six days, said Singh. 

The next inspection was scheduled on July 31, but has been brought forward by six days on the IFAs request. 

I am confident the East Bengal ground will be cleared to host their matches, Ganguly said. 

In case East Bengal ground doesnt get the fit certificate, the IFA will have to slot the red-and-golds matches in Barasat, Howrah or Kalyani.

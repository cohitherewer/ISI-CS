 Witnesses to be quizzed directly

Kingston/London: The witnesses to be called to attend the Coroners inquest into Bob Woolmer murder will be questioned directly, according to a top legal official of Jamaica. 

Kent Pantry, director of public prosecutions, who will attend the inquest with two of his officers, has ruled out suggestions that some witnesses could give their testimony via video link. 

Production of the toxicology report prompted a flurry of discussions between chief investigator Mark Shields, Patrick Murphy, the Coroner, and Pantry. Witnesses will be required to give live evidence at the inquest. The list is likely to include members of the Pakistan team. (PTI)

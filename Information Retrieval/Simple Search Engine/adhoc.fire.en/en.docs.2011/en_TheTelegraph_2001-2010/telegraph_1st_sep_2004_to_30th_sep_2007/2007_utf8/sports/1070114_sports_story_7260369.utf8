 AIFF mulling new rule to end practice 

 - Chopping and changing of foreigners by clubs in a season

New Delhi: Upset over the manner some of the clubs, especially from Calcutta, are recruiting and rejecting foreign players throughout the season, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) is planning to change rules to put an end to this practice. 

Highly placed sources in the AIFF told The Telegraph on Saturday that a recommendation will soon be placed in the executive committee meeting for approval under which each foreign player will automatically be registered with the AIFF the moment any club registers him with the local association. Most importantly, the federation will also not allow de-registration of that foreign player till the end of the season. 

The new rule, which is likely to come into effect from the next season, will, for all practical purposes, not allow any club to register more than three foreign players in a particular season. 

At present the rule is that a club can only register three foreigners each for AIFF tournaments Federation Cup and the National Football League (NFL) and they cannot be de-registered, sources said. But for other tournaments, the clubs are frequently chopping and changing foreign players. This is not good and needs to be stopped. 

The AIFF is believed to have approached some of the state association to bring an end to this trend of de-registration, but fearing backlash from the clubs, the local bodies didnt want to take a step forward. Having found the state associations reluctant in this regard, the federation has decided to take up things in their own way. 

Among the Calcutta clubs, East Bengal have used at least half a dozen foreign players this season but are yet to finalise their list of foreigners for the NFL, which has already started. 

Two Brazilians Daniel Gil and Thiago Ferreira were flown in with much fanfare on the eve of the Durand Cup and were unceremoniously sacked after they failed to deliver the goods in that tournament, IFA Shield and the Federation Cup. The red-and-gold brigade is now set to take a test of another Brazilian Edmilson Pardal to arrest their dipping fortunes in the current season. 

Only a few days back, we saw newspaper reports where the East Bengals Brazilian coach has expressed his displeasure about a new foreign player appearing for trials every morning, said the source. He also suggested that clubs will now have to choose each foreigner carefully and make up their mind on three recruits. 

East Bengal are not the only club who could be pulled up for changing foreign players very often. While Mohammedan Sporting have virtually turned into a permanent backward for trials of foreign players, Mahindra United, too, have joined the fray off late when they discarded Canadian international Tony Menezes and Portuguese striker Felipe Vaz Azevado to recruit Ghanaian striker Andrews Pomeyie Mensah.

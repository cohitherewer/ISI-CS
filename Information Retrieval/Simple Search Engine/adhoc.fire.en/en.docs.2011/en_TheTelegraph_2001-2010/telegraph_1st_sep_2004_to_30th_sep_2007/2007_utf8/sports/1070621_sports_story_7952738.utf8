 Fatherhood shouldnt be a major problem 

PETER DIXON 

Any disappointment that Tiger Woods felt after finishing runner-up at the US Open championship on Sunday evening was dispelled the next morning when his wife, Elin, gave birth to their first child, a daughter by the name of Sam Alexis. 

If it is to be assumed that the date of the birth was unplanned, then there was the intriguing possibility that Woods might have found himself involved in a play-off for the US Open at the same time that his wife had gone into labour. 

A birdie at any of the final three holes at Oakmont in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, would have put Woods head-to-head with ngel Cabrera over 18 holes on Monday. But having said earlier this year that he would put his family above all other considerations when the time of the birth came around, what would he have done? We shall never know. 

But while it is by no means certain that Woods will play at the Open Championship in Carnoustie from July 19 to 22, the Royal amp; Ancient (R amp; A), which runs the tournament, will probably have breathed a huge sigh of relief that the events biggest draw now has almost five weeks in which to adjust to life as a father before tackling the third major of the season. 

When he was asked earlier this year if he would stay at home instead of attempting to become the first player since Peter Thomson (1954-56) to win the Claret Jug three years in succession, Woods left little doubt that family came first. 

On Tuesday, Peter Dawson, chief executive of the R amp; A, said: We are pleased for them. It is good news because this must increase the likelihood of Tiger playing the Open.

 Bangladesh batsmen delay the inevitable

 Mohammed Ashraful in action on Wednesday 

Colombo: Bangladeshs batsmen mounted a brave fightback against Sri Lanka but still faced a probable innings defeat as they closed the third day of the first Test on 233 for five on Wednesday. 

Opener Javed Omar led Bangladeshs resistance with 62 as the tourists, bundled out for a feeble 89 in the first innings, forced Sri Lankas bowlers to toil hard for their wickets on a docile pitch. 

Bangladesh started the day on three for no loss in their second innings, facing a daunting task with 485 runs required to avert an innings defeat and finished still 255 runs in arrears with two days remaining. 

The tourists prospered particularly well in the first two sessions, losing only Shahriar Nafees (38) during the morning and then Omar and Habibul Bashar (17) in the afternoon, but Sri Lankas spinners hit back in the evening session. 

Part-time spinner Tillekeratne Dilshan snared Rajin Salehs (51) four-hour resistance with a flighted delivery that was edged to slip. 

Captain Mohammed Ashraful (37) self-destructed just minutes before the close, lofting a catch straight to Chaminda Vaas at long on off Muttiah Muralidharan. 

When play was called off early due to bad light Shakib Al Hasan was batting on four and wicketkeeper Khaled Mashud was on nought.

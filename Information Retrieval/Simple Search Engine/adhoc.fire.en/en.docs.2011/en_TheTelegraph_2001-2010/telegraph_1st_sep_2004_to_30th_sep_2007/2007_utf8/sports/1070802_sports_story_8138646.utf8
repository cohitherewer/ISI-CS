The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Indias 

 opening stand made the biggest difference

 - Former England captains Gower, Gooch and Atherton look back 

 and ahead 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 

 England are capable of 

 coming back in the series... Vaughan would definitely 

 like his batsmen to be consistent...

 MICHAEL 

 ATHERTON

 London: After Team Indias 

 handsome seven-wicket win in Nottingham on Tuesday, The 

 Telegraph spoke to three former England captains David 

 Gower, Graham Gooch and Michael Atherton.

 The following are 

 excerpts from what the captains (in alphabetical order) 

 said:

 On the second Test

 Atherton: India 

 deserved to win... They outplayed England. The Indians arrived 

 with a question mark of sorts over the opening combination 

 and their ability to make early breakthroughs with the new 

 ball... They got both right at Trent Bridge... You cant 

 hope to win in England unless you get good opening partnerships... 

 I thought Zaheer Khans bowling round the wicket was 

 a revelation...

 Gooch: It was a good Test, 

 with both teams playing good cricket... Overall, India played 

 better... England effectively lost the Test when they couldnt 

 cross even 200 in the first innings... I must say Ive 

 been impressed by Indias progress in the series... 

 They were slow to start at Lords and were lucky to 

 get away with a draw... However, they improved their game 

 plan with the bat and 481 (first innings) was a very good 

 score... It was a massive percentage increase over Lords 

 and they deserve to be congratulated... It was a good toss 

 to win and, really, Indias swing bowlers were superb... 

 Zaheer made the difference.

 Gower: On balance, India 

 played the better cricket and deserved to be the winners... 

 It was a handy toss to win and the Indians took advantage...

 I wouldn rsquo;t like to 

 think it rsquo;s all over for England... The ball does 

 swing at 

 The Oval and, so, England will be hoping to make it 

 1-1...

 DAVID GOWER

 On where England went wrong

 Atherton: To be honest, 

 England didnt play that badly... The toss was reasonably 

 important, but the England batsmen didnt apply themselves 

 in the first innings... They did fine in the second... If 

 I was the England captain, I wouldnt be too upset... 

 Wouldnt be too worried either... I wouldnt beat 

 myself up.

 Gooch: The batting wasnt 

 good enough in the first innings... The discipline and application, 

 in admittedly difficult conditions, just wasnt there.

 Gower: (Grins) Id 

 rather give credit to India... Of course more runs in the 

 first innings wouldve helped England. But Im 

 not sure by how much.

 On the defining moment at Trent 

 Bridge

 Atherton: Indias 

 opening partnership (Wasim Jaffer and Dinesh Karthik) in 

 the first innings... Those 147 runs made the biggest difference.

 Gooch: Indias opening 

 stand in the first innings.

 Gower: Zaheers wickets 

 in both innings (four and five)... They were important ones... 

 Also, Indias opening partnership in the first innings... 

 England scored 198 and the Indian openers knocked off 147.

 It rsquo;s going to be 

 tough for England but they shouldn rsquo;t panic

 GRAHAM GOOCH

 On Rahul Dravid and Michael 

 Vaughans captaincy

 Atherton: I admire both... 

 Captains have good days and bad days... I think both did 

 well.

 Gooch: Dravid handled his 

 team well, but I dont think Vaughan handled his fielders 

 that well Ive certainly seen him do better with field 

 placements... Showy positions are okay when the wicket is 

 flat, not when the ball is swinging... I wouldve favoured 

 more conventional fields.

 Gower: Both are highly 

 rated and with good reasons... Yet, there were times in 

 the Test when you couldve raised questions about field 

 placements... Vaughan, in particular, likes to employ out 

 of the ordinary field placements but there were moments 

 which demanded orthodox settings.

 Finally, on what could happen 

 in the final Test (at The Oval)

 Atherton: England are capable 

 of coming back in the series... Vaughan wouldnt be 

 asking too much more from his bowlers, but would definitely 

 like his batsmen to be consistent... Having said that, the 

 wicket tends to be flat and if the conditions get drier, 

 then that would help India. In such conditions, it will 

 be difficult to knock the Indian batsmen over twice...

 Gooch: Its going 

 to be tough for England but they shouldnt panic.

 Gower: I wouldnt 

 like to think its all over for England... The ball 

 does swing at The Oval and, so, England will be hoping to 

 make it 1-1...

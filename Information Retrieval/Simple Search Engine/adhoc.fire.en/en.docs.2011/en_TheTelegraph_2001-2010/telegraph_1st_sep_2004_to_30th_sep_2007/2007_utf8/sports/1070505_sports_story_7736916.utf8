 Lee-Tait combination will be awesome, says Ponting

 Ricky Ponting 

Melbourne: Australian captain Ricky Ponting has no apprehensions about teaming Shaun Tait with Brett Lee to create the worlds fastest new ball attack. 

You can absolutely have both those guys in one team, and if you put a couple of other steadier guys around him youd have a pretty awesome attack, Ponting told an Australian daily. 

Tait, dubbed the wild thing due to his extreme pace and dodgy radar, was impressive at the World Cup with 23 wickets, joint second in tournament tally list. 

The 24-year-olds performance meant Australia did not feel the absence of Lee who was out with an ankle injury. 

Tait can do a great job for you with the new ball in Test cricket as well as one-day cricket, which is how we used him in the World Cup, Ponting said. 

He knocks batsmen over. If he gets that new ball swinging and he gets it right, there arent many batsmen in the world who are going to be able to keep him out. 

Ponting said the experienced Lee, at 30 and with 231 Test and 267 one-day wickets, can somewhat fill the vacuum created by McGrath. 

Brett is not the out and out strike bowler but Taity is at the moment, Ponting said. Brett was that a few years ago. I think hes been able to change his whole game around He is more economical now. He knows how he has to bowl to get certain players out. 

Whereas Taity is going to be that Mr Unpredictable, Ponting said. You could bowl him for just two or three overs up front in Test cricket, too, and then bring on someone steady like Stuart Clark. 

Certainly Tait is excited about the prospect of opening the bowling with Lee. That would be awesome. I remember talking to Brett about opening the bowling with him years ago and that it would be fantastic. Hopefully the time comes in near future. 

Prime Minister John Howard said on Friday that the Australian government would cover any financial penalties that may be imposed if the national team boycotts the tour of Zimbabwe. 

Cricket Australia could be hit with a $2 million fine from the ICC if they refuse to tour Zimbabwe later this year. 

We will indemnify Cricket Australia for any compensation that it may have to pay to the international body, Howard said on Friday. (Agencies)

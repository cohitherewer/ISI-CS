The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Give us more games, pleads Tikolo 

Gros Islet: It was almost mission impossible. 

Steve Tikolo was disappointed his team could not emulate their World Cup semi-final place four years ago. But while he knows just how to fix the problem and make his team more competitive again, it could be easier said than done. 

More games, Tikolo said after Kenya lost by seven wickets to England on Saturday. Ive been saying this since time immemorial. More games. You cant come here without playing at this level consistently. 

Kenya next play at the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa in September. But there will be no top-flight international cricket for Kenya in between. 

You cant compete like that, Tikolo said. 

Cricket Kenya has recovered from the infighting that blighted it after 2003, and is talking with the ICC to get Kenya playing more. 

Our board has been talking to ICC and the excuse they always get is the 10 Test-playing countries are busy with their 10-year calendar, Tikolo said. If you want the associate countries to come up, you have to give them more games. Its as simple as that. (AP)

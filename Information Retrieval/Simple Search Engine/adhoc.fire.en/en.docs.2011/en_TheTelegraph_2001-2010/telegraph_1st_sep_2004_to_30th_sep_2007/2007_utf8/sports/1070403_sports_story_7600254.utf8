 Fletcher urges England to seize control

Derek Pringle

The World Cup is held every four years and is the premier tournament in cricket, so it is alarming to find England head coach Duncan Fletcher accusing his side of complacency following their 48-run win over Ireland last Friday. 

England play Sri Lanka in Antigua on Wednesday, a game that will require their full attention if they are to have any chance of winning it. I didnt think we played as well as we could against Ireland, Fletcher admitted on Sunday. It was still an important win but we got a little bit complacent at times, something we must make sure we dont do against the better sides. 

Fletchers beef is not so much with the batsmen though there are still huge doubts over the effectiveness of the top three but with the bowlers. With net run-rate (runs scored minus runs conceded) likely to prove important, they stand accused of presuming their opponents would self-destruct once they had taken two early wickets. 

Complacency normally arises when you think you are in a winning position, Fletcher said. You can go through periods, not in a negative way but in a form where you just presume things are going to keep going your way. Its not as if they are just sitting back and thinking the games over, but theyve got to be careful to stick to the plans. 

I felt once we got those two early wickets that we sat back and thought wed bowl them out. But you cant afford to do that on these slow pitches. Even when youre in a positive position, you need to be careful. The Associate sides all have good cricketers who can turn a game. 

Mindful that Englands run-rate needs improving, captain Michael Vaughan kept attacking fields in place longer than he needed. Unfortunately, his pace bowlers (Monty Panesars figures of two for 31 were pretty faultless) failed to maintain their early intensity a problem not entirely due to Andrew Flintoff damaging an ankle. 

There are signs that the team is playing well but there are also periods where they lose concentration, Fletcher said. Theyve got to make sure when they play a top side like Sri Lanka, and get them down two or three wickets, that you maintain the pressure. 

Bowling them out isnt just going to happen, especially on pitches like these and with a Kookaburra ball thats gone soft by the 20th over. Theyve got to realise there is still a lot of hard work after we make that initial breakthrough. 

Such carelessness will surely not arise on Wednesday at the spanking new Sir Vivian Richards Stadium. Sri Lankas batsmen gave Englands bowlers such a shellacking the last time they met that lack of sleep, not lack of commitment, will be Englands biggest problem. 

That series has got to have some bearing but people forget we were missing eight first-choice players at one stage, Fletcher said. But we can go into Wednesdays game with our top side and play the cricket were capable of playing. Weve done it recently against Australia, and we can fall back on that. We can beat all the sides in this competition. quot; 

The memories will still hurt for some. The persistent power of Sanath Jayasuriya, who scored a century against the West Indies on Sunday, and his teammates turned England bowlers into nervous wrecks and was a major factor in Stephen Harmisons recent and untimely retirement from the one-day game. 

Sri Lankas potency remains a problem for England, whose top three of Vaughan, Ed Joyce and Ian Bell appear unwilling, or unable, to counter with a hitting game of their own. 

We need to play to our strengths and the players that are available to us, Fletcher said. At this stage it is dangerous to start trying to change the way people play. Partnerships are the most crucial aspect of batting and thats what the top three are trying to do, set up a platform for Pietersen and Collingwood to accelerate off.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Adjust your backlift to negotiate the yorker

 - Keep your eyes on the ball so that you dont duck into a bouncer and lose balance

Cricket online 

Ravi Shastri

I often get dismissed because of lack of footwork. How do I improve my footwork? 

 (Syed Kashif Jawed, 17, Bardhaman) 

 Work on it with your coach in the nets. 

 I am a righthanded batsman with a high backlift. I face problems playing a yorker. Please help.

 (Nabin Ghosh, 14, Dhanbad) 

 Youve got to adjust your backlift so that you have time on your hands to negotiate the yorker. 

 I am a righthanded batsman. Is it wise to take guard outside the leg stump when facing leg-spinners?

 (Rohit Roy, 19, Calcutta-84) 

 Depends on where he is bowling from. Not wise if he is bowling over the wicket and the ball is not turning that much. 

 I am a mediumpacer and would like to know the ideal length for pitching a bouncer?

 (Apurba Sharma, 21, Calcutta-42) 

 The length may alter from batsman to batsman. The idea is to make him fend it off his throat. 

 I am an off-spinner and would like to know the ideal length for bowling an off-break?

 (Sanjoy Chakraborty, 18, Jamshedpur) 

 Just outside off-stump, drawing the batsman forward. 

 I am a wicketkeeper and have problems in anticipating the ball on the leg-side. Please help.

 (Sanjay Dixit, 22, Calcutta-10) 

 Work on your footwork when you move sideways down the leg side. That will help immensely. 

 Please suggest a way by which I can keep the shine of the ball intact on one side for a longer period?

 (Bapi Sen, 23, Calcutta-17) 

 Not just you, but the fielders as well must work on the ball. And make sure the ball doesnt disappear to the boundary too often. 

 I am a righthanded batsman. Often I step onto the stumps and am out hit wicket when trying to defend a bouncer. Please help.

 (S. Mukherjee, 19, Calcutta) 

 Keep your eyes on the ball so that you dont duck into it and lose balance. 

 I am a righthanded batsman. I often get caught in the deep midwicket region when attempting the hook. Please help.

 (Puneet Sharma, 19, Calcutta) 

 Use the depth of the crease when you go back and across and make sure you try to roll your wrists at the time of contact. 

 I play first division cricket in the Calcutta league. I would like to know how useful playing in the English county league circuit would be during the off season? 

 (Tapan Goswami, 22, Rishra)

 The exposure is pretty useful if you get into a good league.

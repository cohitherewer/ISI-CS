 Ricky Ponting wary of New Zealand

St Georges: Australia captain Ricky Ponting believes New Zealands love of a scrap makes them as big a threat as anyone to his sides hopes of winning an unprecedented third straight World Cup title. 

The Trans-Tasman rivals, already through to the semi-finals, meet in Grenada on Friday for their last Super Eight game in what could be a dress rehearsal for the April 28 final in Barbados. 

In February, New Zealand bounced back from the disappointment of finishing third in the Commonwwealth Bank Series in Australia, won by England, to defeat the world champions 3-0 on home soil. 

The Black Caps, currently second in the Super Eight standings behind the title-holders, had been, until Thursdays six-wicket defeat by Sri Lanka, the only other unbeaten side in the World Cup. 

But Ponting said: New Zealand are playing as well as anyone at the moment. 

Theyve been playing pretty much one-day cricket almost 12 months now, theyve played hardly any other cricket. Theyve been focusing wholly and solely on this event. 

They didnt play very well in Australia in the Commonwealth Bank Series but we then went there and they played some unbelievable cricket, scored some big runs and chased some big totals down. 

Theres no doubt at the moment theyve got a bit of confidence and when they are actually at full strength, which they are pretty close to now, they are a very competitive side. 

New Zealand have never won the World Cup or even reached the final although they have now reached the last four for the fifth time in the tournaments nine edition history. 

They love a fight, they love a scrap, Ponting said. They are a pretty proud team and Ive got a lot of respect for them. 

New Zealand allrounder Scott Styris is averaging over 100 in the Caribbean after scoring a century and four fifties. 

Fast bowler Shane Bond has taken 12 wickets at under 25 apiece in an attack that also features experienced left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori. 

Styris has been good for them so far, Bonds obviously very good and Vettori is always good in these sorts of conditions, Ponting added. 

Bond, unusually for current players, has a better one-day record against Australia than for his career as a whole. In 11 games against Australia he has taken 34 wickets at an average of under 14 apiece. 

By contrast his 124 wickets in 66 career one-dayers have cost 19 apiece. 

At the last World Cup he took six for 23 against us in Port Elizabeth and he got a hattrick against us this year, said Ponting. 

Hes one of those guys, you have to pay the utmost attention to. Hes very dangerous with the new ball and (New Zealand captain Stephen) Fleming uses him as a strike bowler through the middle to try to break partnerships and he generally does that. 

When that New Zealand game comes around, Im sure at our team meeting well be speaking a lot about the appropriate way to play him early on. (AFP)

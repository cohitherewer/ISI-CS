 Ghei settles for sole third in Macau

 Gaurav Ghei 

Macau: Gaurav Ghei came agonisingly close to his second win in as many starts on the Asian Tour, but had to remain content with sole third at the Macau Open golf tournament here on Sunday. 

Ghei shot 65, 70, and 67 to aggregate 202 at the end of Round III. He failed to get into the play-off which was eventually won by Lu Wen-teh. The man from Taipei did well to edge out Australian Richard Moir. 

Moir picked two birdies in last three holes while the Indian managed just one at the Macau Golf and Country Club. 

Ghei was two ahead with seven holes to go when play resumed in the tournament, reduced to 54 holes because of rain interruptions. He immediately dropped a bogey on the par five 12th hole. 

After that bogey on 12, I hit a lot of solid shots. I hit every green after that and missed a birdie on 15. On 17 I had a 15-footer and missed it as well but birdied the last. Sometimes, its a matter of inches, winning or losing events, Ghei said. 

Gurbaaz Mann scored his first top-10 finish with a tied ninth placed finish with a final round of 70. He ended at seven-under 209. Digvijay Singh was the biggest mover among the Indians. He closed with a 66 that saw him at six-under 210 and in tied 14th place. (PTI)

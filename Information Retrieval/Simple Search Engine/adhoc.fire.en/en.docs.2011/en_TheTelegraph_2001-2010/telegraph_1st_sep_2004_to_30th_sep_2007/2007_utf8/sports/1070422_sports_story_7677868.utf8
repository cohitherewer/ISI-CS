 McGrath ahead in race for best player

Kingston: Australian pace ace Glenn McGrath is inching closer to bagging the player of the tournament award in the ongoing World Cup. 

Mcgrath has so far tallied 12 points, which is three more than teammate Matthew Hayden and New Zealands Scott Styris. 

With only a couple of matches left in the competition for Australia and New Zealand, McGraths competitors will find it difficult to go past him. McGrath himself stands a chance to come up with one or two good performances and secure some more points. 

Players are being evaluated in the World Cup by adding points awarded for emerging MoM (3 points), second best (2) and third best (1). 

A consistent performer for Australia over many years, the 37-year-old McGrath has so far claimed two MoM awards and been second best on three occasions.Styris has one MoM award and three second best performances for nine points. Hayden, who stormed to the top of the run-making tally with a thunderous hundred against New Zealand, is also on nine. 

Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene (8) and South African allrounder Jacques Kallis (7) are next in the queue. 

Hayden has 580 runs from nine matches at an average of 82.85, a tally that includes three centuries and one half-century. Ricky Ponting has moved to second spot with 480 runs from nine matches, at an average of 80.00 with a century and four fifties. 

Kallis has made exactly the same number of runs as Ponting, at a superior average (96.00), but has hit three half-centuries compared to four by the Australian captain. Both have a century each. 

Styris (462) and Graeme Smith (441) are the next on the list, but unlikely to displace Hayden. (PTI)

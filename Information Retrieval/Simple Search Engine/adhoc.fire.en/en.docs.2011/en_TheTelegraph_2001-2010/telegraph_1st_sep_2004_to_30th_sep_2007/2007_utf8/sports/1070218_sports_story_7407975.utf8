 RCTC lodges FIR against member 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC) lodged an FIR at the Hastings police station on Friday, against an ex-steward who was involved in mismanagement of the clubs funds. An FIR has been lodged against an ex-steward, said Cyrus Madan, a steward in the present dispensation. Madan, however, refused to talk about other details.

 RCTC members have been demanding action against fellow-member and an ex-steward, Sujit Bhattacharyya, for his handling of the clubs finances, as was divulged in the due diligence report last November.

 Bhattacharyya, who was not available for comment, has been booked under IPC sections 406 and 420 which are broadly understood to be criminal breach of trust and cheating.

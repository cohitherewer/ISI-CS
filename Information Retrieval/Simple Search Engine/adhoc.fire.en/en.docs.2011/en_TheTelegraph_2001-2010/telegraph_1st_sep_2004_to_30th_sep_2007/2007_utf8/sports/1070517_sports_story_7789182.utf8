 Kumble: I feel relaxed now 

Chittagong: Partners may come and go, but Anil Kumble goes on forever. 

I feel more relaxed now. There is no problem with focusing. I am concentrating wholly on the longer version, said Kumble, who joined the squad two days ago for the Tests against Bangladesh. 

The axing of offie Harbhajan Singh has placed a huge burden on his shoulders, that of having to shepherd the relatively inexperienced spinners Ramesh Powar and Rajesh Pawar. Kumble believes the two have it in them to deliver. 

Ramesh and Rajesh have done well in domestic circuit over the last five-six years, he said. They are a confident lot. They have done well in limited opportunities that they got and hope they do well in future.

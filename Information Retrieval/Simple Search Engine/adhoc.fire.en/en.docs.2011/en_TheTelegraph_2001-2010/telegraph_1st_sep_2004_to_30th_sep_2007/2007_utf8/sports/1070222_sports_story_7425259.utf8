 We had better balance in that team: Murali

 Muralidharan 

Colombo: Muttiah Muralidharan believes that Sri Lanka may go into the forthcoming World Cup in the Caribbean as strong contenders but the 1996 victorious team from the Island nation was a better side than the current one. 

Some experts are tipping us to surprise a few at the World Cup and maybe even win it. I think we have a good chance but I still believe the Sri Lanka team of 1996 was better, said Muralidharan who will be playing in his fourth Cup. 

When we won the World Cup in 1996, batting-wise the team was more experienced, had flair, everything was there in that team in 96, the record-breaking off-spinner wrote in a web site. 

Its difficult for people to say we are better now because I played in both eras and the batting was much stronger then. 

This team now has a better bowling attack than what we had that time but we had a better balance in the 96 World Cup because there were four spinners in the side and only two fast bowlers. 

Muralidharan said Sanath Jayasuriya was another player like him who had come a long way from the 1996 success. 

He is a different type of player now then he didnt have any pressure or fear to perform. He was told by the captain (Arjuna Ranatunga) to just put the ball out of the park, it doesnt matter if you get out for one or nought because we have experienced batsmen to come in. (PTI)

London: Manchester United moved closer to the Premier League title with a dramatic 1-0 win at Liverpool on Saturday that left them nine points clear of Chelsea. 

The defending champions, however, ground out a 2-0 victory at Portsmouth, with Didier Drogba scoring in the 33rd minute and Chelseas other Ivory Coast striker, Salomon Kalou, coming off the bench to make it sure in the 82nd. 

Substitute John Shea fired a stoppage time winner as United moved to 72 points with nine games left to play, while Chelsea are second on 63 with a game in hand. Liverpool are third on 53 points, but Arsenal closed to within a point with two games in hand after they finished a miserable week with a morale-boosting 2-1 win over Reading. 

The northeast derby finished 0-0 between Newcastle United and Middlesbrough, Wigan Athletics revival continued with a 1-0 win at Manchester City and Watford let slip a 2-0 lead to draw 2-2 with Charlton Athletic in a relegation dogfight. 

Manchester United had only 10 men when they scored after midfielder Paul Scholes was shown a straight red card four minutes from time for raising his hands at Xabi Alonso. 

Scholes will miss three domestic matches, starting with next Saturdays FA Cup quarter final at Middlesbrough. 

The United manager said England striker Wayne Rooney, who made way for Shea in the 74th minute, would be assessed on Sunday after suffering a knee injury. 

Chelsea, who will need to make the most of a home game with Fergusons men scheduled for April 15, have kept the title race alive with their win at Fratton Park. Drogba celebrated his African Footballer of the Year award in midweek by scoring his 29th goal of the season, a superb volley from a long Ashley Cole cross from the left. 

However, it needed a brilliant one-handed save from keeper Petr Cech to deny Pompey substitute Andy Cole a headed equaliser before Kalou slid home Chelseas second. 

Meanwhile in Spain, 10-man Sevilla fought back from a goal down to beat Barcelona 2-1 at home and move to the top of the Primera Liga in an explosive encounter on Saturday. 

Ronaldinho headed the Catalans in front after 13 minutes and when Sevilla defender Aitor Ocio was sent off in the 28th for bringing down the Brazilian for a penalty, the home side looked to be out of the match. 

But Ronaldinhos spot-kick was saved and Sevillas Alexander Kerzhakov levelled before the break. 

Daniel Alves put the Andalucians in front with a free-kick early in the second half, and Barcelona soon lost their numerical advantage as Ludovic Giuly and Gianluca Zambrotta were sent off. 

Sevilla are top with 50 points, one ahead of Barcelona who dropped to second. 

A Fernando Morientes goal gave third-placed Valencia a 1-0 home win over Celta Vigo and moved them on to 46 points. The former Liverpool striker volleyed home from Hugo Vianas cross after 67 minutes for his 10th goal of the season. But it was a laboured performance from Quique Sanchez Flores side, who had goalkeeper Santiago Canizares to thank for a last minute save from Celtas Fernando Baiano. 

In Italy though, Serie A leaders Inter Milan extended their advantage to 16 points by coming from behind to win 2-1 at Livorno. (REUTERS)

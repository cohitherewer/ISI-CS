 Flintoff likely to miss India test

 Christopher Martin-Jenkins 

Andrew Flintoffs arthroscopy on his injured left ankle appears to have gone according to plan but he is unlikely to be playing cricket again until this seasons seven Tests have been completed in the middle of August. Although the intention of the operation was exploratory, tissue contributing to anterior impingement in the ankle was removed and the road back is bound to be uphill. 

[The three Test series versus India concludes on August 13.] 

Andrew will require a programme of strengthening before he can start to return to training and bowling. It is anticipated that he will aim to return to playing cricket before the end of the summer, a cautious ECB statement said. 

The ECB also released the full report by the Ken Schofield Review Group, with its proposals for overcoming inadequate and inefficient communication between the England coach and the counties during the last four years of Duncan Fletchers tenure. 

The report called for a new, authoritative ECB cricket management structure, which is decisive, transparent and consistent with best business practice. 

Authority and accountability will be very clear, the report says, and it will enable Peter Moores, to be known in future as the England team director, to concentrate on the cricket with his coaching and support staff.

 Manoranjan to leave city 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Former East Bengal coach Manoranjan Bhattacharjee, who is now part of the clubs junior development programme, is set to leave the city. 

Bhattacharjee, also a former India defender, has been asked by his employers Bank of India to shift to the Giridih office. 

Though he has asked the management for a rethink, hes also mentally preparing for the transfer. 

Bhattacharjee coached the red-and-gold brigade in 2001-2002 season. 

Since then, he has been an integral part of the clubs technical committee. 

Bhattacharjee was appointed as technical manager for the Carlos Roberto Pereira-coached side last season in place of Tarun Dey. 

Even before appointing Subrata Bhattacharya this season, East Bengal management offered him the job again but he declined because he wanted to spend time with family. 

He, however, continues to help the club find talents at grassroots level.

 Coaching offer for McGrath

Sydney: Glenn McGrath might not be out of cricket for long. Cricket New South Wales has plans to offer him the state teams bowling coach. 

We have been mindful of giving him a bit of breathing space since his retirement, but we are keen to get him on board, chief executive Dave Gilbert said. 

Meanwhile, Brett Lee, is likely to take part in the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup in September after successfully completing his first running session since tearing ankle ligaments in February.

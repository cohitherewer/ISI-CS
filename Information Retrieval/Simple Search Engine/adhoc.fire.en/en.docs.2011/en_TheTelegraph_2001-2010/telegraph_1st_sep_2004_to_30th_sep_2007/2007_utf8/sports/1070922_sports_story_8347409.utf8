The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Being a regular has helped: RP

Durban: The architect of Indias win over South Africa in the ICC World Twenty20, Rudra Pratap Singh has been a revelation and the young pacer believes he was able to perform well because he had been a regular in the side. 

RP has played a key role in his teams sensational run to the semi-finals and his figures of four for 13 on Thursday were instrumental in knocking the hosts out. 

I have been in and out of the side initially and that doesnt help any bowler. However in recent months, I have been playing regularly. That has given me a lot of confidence to go out and give my best. 

When you get to play regularly, you work on your bowling, and pick up a few things along the way. I am happy to have been doing my bit for my team and I am more confident and mature now, RP said. 

He said the wicket at Kingsmead assisted fast bowlers and inspired him to go out and have a crack at the South African batsmen. RPs two-wicket burst in the second over of the innings put the hosts on the backfoot. 

I have enjoyed bowling in Ireland and England and I am also enjoying bowling at Kingsmead. The wicket here does offer some help to the pace bowlers and whenever that happens it inspires you to do well. 

The 21-year-old Uttar Pradesh boy said the young team was loving every moment. We are enjoying every moment of it. It has been an exciting tournament and the team has really come together to keep winning against the best of teams. 

It really has been very memorable and exciting and I cant really express it in words. We are living a dream and we want this to continue for two more games. 

To be playing the semi-finals of a World Cup against australia is as good as it gets. Of course beating Pakistan was the high point so far but there are two important games still to be played, he said. 

Asked to take his pick on a dream final, RP said, it will be great if its India vs Pakistan! (PTI)

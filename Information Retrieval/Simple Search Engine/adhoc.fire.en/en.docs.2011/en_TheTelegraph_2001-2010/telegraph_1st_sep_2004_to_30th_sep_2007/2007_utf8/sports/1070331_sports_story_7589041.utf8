 Riise bankrupt

Liverpool: Liverpool defender John Arne Riise was declared bankrupt by Liverpool county court on Friday for an unpaid debt of around 100,000. 

Riise, who earns an estimated 50,000 a week, is involved in a legal battle with his former agent, Einar Baardsen, whom he has accused of swindling him out of 3 million.

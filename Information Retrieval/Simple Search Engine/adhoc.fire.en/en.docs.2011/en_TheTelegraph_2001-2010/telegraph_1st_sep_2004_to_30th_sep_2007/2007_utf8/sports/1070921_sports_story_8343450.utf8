Mumbai: Chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar was all praise for Yuvraj Singh after he became the first man to hit six sixes in an over in Twenty20 cricket against England on Wednesday. 

The 25-year-old lefthander belted fast bowler Stuart Broad during the Super Eight clash in Durban on his way to scoring the fastest half-century in Twenty20 internationals, when he reached the mark off just 12 deliveries. 

It was a tremendous performance, Vengsarkar said on Thursday. It was superb, clean hitting. 

Yuvrajs innings has also left his dad, former India cricketer Yograj, happy. 

I called him up early this morning and congratulated him for his heroics. Apart from wanting to continue his fine touch which he has rediscovered now, Yuvraj is also keen to improve his bowling, Yograj said in Chandigarh. 

We have decided that we will work together on his bowling. He has got a good height and there is no reason why he should not excel, he said. 

He said that 25-year-old Yuvraj had been feeling down after being hit for five sixes in a row by Dimitri Mascarenhas in the sixth ODI against England earlier this month at the Oval. 

Just before Wednesday nights match, the left-hander had called up his father and expressed his desire to play a big innings. He telephoned me and said dad, I have been getting out to wrong shots. He also said that he was not feeling good about being hit for five sixes. 

Yograj, however, did not watch his sons innings on TV. 

I was asleep and woke up only when I started receiving phone calls and heard crackers being burst in the locality, he said, adding that Yuvraj had told him to catch his innings during the match highlights.

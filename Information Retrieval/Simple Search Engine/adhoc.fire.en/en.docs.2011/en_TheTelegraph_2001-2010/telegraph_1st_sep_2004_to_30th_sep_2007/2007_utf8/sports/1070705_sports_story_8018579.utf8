Colombo: Kumar Sangakkara scored a brilliant unbeaten double century before a dramatic late collapse on the second day on Wednesday left Bangladesh facing an innings defeat in the second Test. 

Sangakkara was the cornerstone of Sri Lankas 451 for six declared, scoring 200 not out to leave Bangladesh 389 runs in arrears. 

Bangladesh, bowled out for a record low of just 62 in the first innings, started their second innings positively before slumping to 69 for four as they lost the wickets of Shahriar Nafees, Rajin Saleh, Javed Omar and Mehrab Hossain junior. 

With three days remaining, Bangladesh are still 320 runs in arrears with Habibul Bashar on three and skipper Mohammed Ashraful on seven. 

Sangakkara began the day on 51 and progressed smoothly to a 13th Test century, reaching three figures just before lunch with a straight six before reaching 200 for the fifth time in his career in the final session. 

The 29-year-old left-hander the seventh batsman in Test history to have scored five or more double hundreds batted for just short of eight hours in an innings that spanned 325 deliveries and included 20 fours and two sixes. 

Sri Lanka declared on 451 for six as soon as Sangakkara reached his double hundred, leaving Bangladesh with a tricky 17-over session before the close. 

Chaminda Vaas grabbed the breakthrough as Nafees (20) was caught behind off an expansive cover drive. 

The innings plunged into freefall with four wickets falling for just 11 runs. Saleh (nought) fell to a stunning diving catch by Mahela Jayawardene at second slip off Dilhara Fernando, Omar (28) was trapped lbw by a Vaas inswinger and debutante Hossain Junior (eight) was bowled by Fernando. 

Bangladesh trail the three-match series 0-1 after losing the first game by an innings and 234 runs last week.

 Jeev soars to tied sixth

 Jeev Milkha Singh 

Milan: Jeev Milkha Singh soared on the wings of a first-hole eagle and added five more birdies as he moved to tied sixth in the second round of the rain-hit telecom Italian Open. 

Jeev, who had a three-under 69 in the first round, was seven-under after 16 holes in second round, taking his total to ten-under with two more holes to go. The Indian was four shots off the lead in a tournament cut to 54 holes. 

Jeev, taking full advantage of the preferred lies rule, shot an eagle three on first and then bogeyed the second. He then added birdies on fourth, fifth, ninth, 10th, 14th and 15th holes to be seven-under for 15 holes. 

The players are being allowed preferred lies rule under which they lift, clean and place the ball on the fairways. Jyoti Randhawa recovered some ground to shoot three-under 69 in the second round play on Friday. 

Randhawa, who finished second in Madrid last week, was four-under after two rounds and tied 53rd. 

Playing his back-nine first, he opened with three pars and then bogeyed the 13th. Later he birdied the 15th, 17th and 18th and added a third successive birdie by slotting the par-first in four. He bogeyed the second and then birdied his closing hole, for a 69.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Barreto delivers warning to EB

A STAFF REPORTER

 Barreto scored another brace on Saturday 

Calcutta: Jose Ramirez Barreto and Shanmugham Venkatesh are on song, East Bengal beware. That was Mohun Bagans message to their arch-rivals six days before the seasons first derby clash. 

Barreto netted a brace and looked hungry for more during the 56 minutes he was on the park in Saturdays CFL Premier Division match against Eastern Railway. Venkatesh strode the midfield like a leader and scored a beauty. Most importantly, the two of them combined well enough to give Subrata Bhattacharya a few sleepless nights. 

Of course, Mohun Bagan can still be criticised on one count: their lack of inertia for most of the second session. They scored thrice within half an hour of kick-off, missed a couple of chances to swell the tally but downed shutters after Barreto was taken off shortly after change of ends. 

Carlos Roberto Pereira cant be blamed for substituting Barreto. Though Eastern Railway showed a stomach for a fight, three points were all but in Mohun Bagans bag. There was no justification in risking an injury or a card to his trump card in the last game before the East Bengal date. But why did the others go to sleep so soon? 

Barretos first goal came in the fifth minute. Left-back Rauf Khans floater saw the Brazilian outjump his giant marker M. Ejike. The header didnt have much power but the placement was spot-on. 

A James Singh miss and two Eastern Railway sorties later, Dharamjit Singh produced a through ball which Venkatesh received flawlessly and volleyed in accurately from the top of the penalty box. 

Barreto then finished off a Venkatesh-Lalawmpuia move with a cool right-footed grounder. That was the Brazilians fifth goal, bringing him on par with countryman Edmilson of East Bengal. What a battle royale it promises to be on Friday between two gifted strikers! 

Barreto could have had a hattrick if his header, off a Dharamjit corner, had not been cleared from the goalline by Anthony Soren.

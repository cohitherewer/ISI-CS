 Samuels to replace Sarwan 

London: Marlon Samuels was called up to the West Indies squad on Thursday to replace injured batsman Ramnaresh Sarwan. 

 However, the West Indies has not yet named a replacement for Sarwan as captain. Daren Ganga took over the captaincy in the second Test at Headingley, after Sarwan fell heavily while attempting to stop a Paul Collingwood drive. 

 The West Indies batted one man short as it fell to a record Test defeat of an innings and 283 runs. 

Sarwan was then ruled out of the rest of the tour. 

Samuels, a Jamaican middle-order batsman, has played 23 Tests with an average of 28.21 runs. His last Test was a 49-run defeat to India in Jamaica in July 2006. 

 He was in the West Indies World Cup squad. He also played at the World Cup for the West Indies. 

The third Test starts on June 7 at the Old Trafford and the fourth starts June 15 at Durham. 

They are also scheduled to play two Twenty20 matches and three ODIs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Wont over-exert myself: Yuvraj

 - He batted well at nets... Now, he has to get the confidence back: Dravid 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Yuvraj Singh 

Nagpur: After his first practice session with Team India in over two-and-half months, top gun Yuvraj Singh emotionally told The Telegraph he was feeling great. 

Speaking at the team hotel on Wednesday evening, he said: It was great to again train in a team environment Its actually difficult conveying it in words Being with teammates is a very different feeling As you saw, I batted for at least 20 minutes, fielded and did the drills prescribed by (physio) John Gloster 

Yuvraj, it may be recalled, injured his left knee (playing kho-kho) on the eve of Indias October 29 Champions Trophy match against Australia in Mohali. As a result, he missed the full tour of South Africa and could be off competitive cricket till next month. 

I know many well-wishers are asking me to take it easy Not to rush back But I know my body best and wont over-exert myself I wont train if Im in pain Ive already rested for over two months, Yuvraj pointed out. 

Depending on Indian Airlines progress in a Twenty20 tournament in Calcutta, he could either join that team there on Friday or remain here till Sundays ODI versus the West Indies. 

Captain Rahul Dravid, meanwhile, expressed satisfaction at Yuvrajs recovery. The signs are good He batted well at nets Now, he has to get the confidence back 

Thats the all-important bottomline. Yuvraj, after all, is going to be a key player in the World Cup.

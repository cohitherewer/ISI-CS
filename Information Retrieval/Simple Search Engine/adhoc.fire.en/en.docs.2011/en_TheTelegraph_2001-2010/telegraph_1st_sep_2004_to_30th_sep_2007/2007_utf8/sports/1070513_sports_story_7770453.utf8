 Fletcher gets Lloyd vote for Windies job

Duncan Fletcher emerged as a contender to be the next West Indies coach when Clive Lloyd backed his credentials for one of the toughest jobs in world cricket. 

Lloyd, the cricket chairman of the West Indies Cricket Board, believes Fletchers focus and work ethic are exactly the kind of principals they need as they search for a replacement for Bennett King, who resigned after the World Cup. 

If Duncan is interested, then yes, said Lloyd. I think he still has a part to play in cricket in general. He is a strong man and strong character. Whenever I spoke with him as a Match Referee, he always enquired about things and challenged you. I got on well with him. 

He did a good job for England. We need to get someone who is strong and who will understand West Indian life. 

Quite how the disciplinarian in Fletcher would cope with this West Indies side is anyones guess. For Lloyd, sorting out the indiscipline is the top priority for the next coach and one that David Moore, the temporary incumbent, will attempt to address in England. 

We are taking too long to get back to the level we would all like, said Lloyd, who was in London on Friday to promote live coverage of the West Indies tour. There are some tough decisions to be taken. These guys have a total comfort zone and they have got to get out of that to get to the heights of other countries. We used to be very athletic and we have to get that work ethic back. 

To bowl four or five spells a day, you have to be fit and strong. If you look at our bowlers and then look at the likes of Garner and Croft, these guys today are midgets.

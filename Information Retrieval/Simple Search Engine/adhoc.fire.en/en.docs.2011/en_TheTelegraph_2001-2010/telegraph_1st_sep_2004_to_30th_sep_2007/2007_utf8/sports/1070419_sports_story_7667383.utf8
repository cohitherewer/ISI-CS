 Lloyd, Croft root for Sarwan

 Ramnaresh Sarwan 

Bridgetown: Middle-order batsman Ramnaresh Sarwan has emerged as the frontrunner to replace Brian Lara as the West Indies captain after receiving the backing of team manager and former skipper Clive Lloyd as well as former speedster Colin Croft. 

Lara has announced his retirement from one-day cricket after the men from the Caribbean failed to progress beyond the Super Eight stage at the World Cup and his departure from the longer form of the game is also not far away. 

The two names that are on every lips are Ramnaresh Sarwan and Daren Ganga... Sarwan will probably be the frontrunner because he has been the frontrunner. These are the only two names in the running at the moment, Lloyd was quoted as saying in a daily. 

Former fast bowler Croft had also come out in favour of Sarwan taking over the mantle. Sarwan must be given the job. I also think that Denesh Ramdin must be groo-med for the future, he said. 

Lloyd admitted that the West Indies have a lot of catching up to do and at present were scraping the barrel. 

We are scraping the barrel here. When you look at the other countries, they are way ahead of us in everything, technology, play... Just about everything, the Caribbean legend said. We are all disappointed (with World Cup results) and we can only hope that the team gets better as time goes on. 

I have only been with the team for a few months and we have tried to get some things right and we know we can get a few right, but it will take some time. Technology is the way to go and the board will have to keep these things in mind as we move forward, he said. 

He said the West Indies had not embraced several developments in the modern game which put the team at a disadvantage on the field. The current $ 15m debt owed by the West Indies Cricket Board meant there was a drastic need for funding. 

We need to look at what the other teams are doing. At the moment we are not fortunate. We need to have sponsors and need to explain to them why we need the money. 

WICB president admitted to the $15 million debt. The WICB has blamed its cash-strapped state for being unable to launch their long-awaited regional development plan. Financially we have had no basis on which to do it. We have just been strapped financially, Gordon told the Caribbean Media Corporation. 

We are now at a point where we are breaking even operationally but we have a $15 million deficit. Thats what we are carrying on our backs. How do you get into development? (Pti)

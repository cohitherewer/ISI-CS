Belfast: India made heavy weather of a modest target and survived a mini-collapse before inflicting a six-wicket defeat on South Africa with five balls to spare in the penultimate game of the three-match one-day series here on Friday. 

India were cruising when veteran openers Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly rolled back the years to put on 134 runs in 28 overs. 

But four wickets for eight runs injected some uncertainty before Yuvraj Singh and Dinesh Karthik helped India draw level 1-1 in the three-match series. 

Put in to bat, South Africa posted 226 for six with twin half centuries from Morne van Wyk (82) and Mark Boucher (55 not out). 

In reply, Sachin (93) and Sourav (42) laid the foundation, Yuvraj (49 not out) and Karthik (32 not out) played some smart cricket. 

South Africa had won the first match here by four wickets and the third and final match is scheduled on Sunday. 

Chasing 227, Sachin and Sourav took their time and while the maestro dominated the scene, the left-hander played the second fiddle. 

Only once did Sourav come out of his shell, stepping out to hit Thandi Tshabalala over mid-on for a six. 

Sachin grew in confidence and his pull shot was back again as he displayed a rich array of strokes. 

Sachin pulled Andre Nel for a six to reach 45 and then an overthrow helped him reach 50 and also become the first player to score 15,000 ODI runs. 

After putting up 134 for the opening stand their 17th century partnership Sourav drove Charl Langeveldt to Herschelle Gibbs at point. That triggered a mini-collapse. 

Dravid (2) looked uncomfortable against Langeveldts bounce and Mahendra Singh Dhoni was castled by Makhaya Ntini. 

In between, Sachin, who was out for 99 in the previous match and looked determined to reach three figures, dragged an innocuous Tshabalala delivery onto his stumps. His 93 came off 106 balls and included 13 delectable hits to the fence apart from two sixes.

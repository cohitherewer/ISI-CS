The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bengal, Hyderabad gear up for crucial match

 - RANJI TROPHY 

ASTAFF REPORTER

 Deep is not taking Hyderabad lightly 

Calcutta: The equations could not have been more tight. 

Bengal have one outright win, two first innings lead and one first innings deficit to garner eight points after four matches of the Ranji Super League. Hyderabad, Bengals Round V opponents, too, find them in the same boat with the equal number of points. 

With one more round to go after this, the Bengal-Hyderabad match at the latters home ground (Uppal Stadium) from Tuesday appears crucial. A result could swing the pendulum in any teams favour. 

Having logged two crucial points with a first innings win over Maharashtra in their last match, Deep Dasgupta and Co. however dont see semi-final berth as their aim. 

Instead the skipper chooses to take a cue from Australia captain Ricky Ponting to take one match at a time and perform well as a team. Performance will obviously make way to achievements, is Deeps mantra. 

But Hyderabad is one team, Deep cant take lightly. He cautions: They dont boast of any big names, yet they come out with good show, performing as a unit because everybody chips in. Obviously, they have a good batting as well as bowling line-up. 

After their first-ever victory over Mumbai in their last match, Hyderabad appear a big team by the way. 

D. Vinay Kumar (with a century in the last match against Mumbai), openers T Suman and D.B. Ravi Teja have been in good nick on the home front. Ambati Rayudu, however, would be missing this match too, and it appears that Hyderabad will retain the winning line-up. 

With openers Arindam Das and Amitava Chakraborty striking good and Rohan Gavaskar, Sourashish Lahiri, Laxmi Ratan Shukla all chipping in against Maharashtra, it is learnt that Deep too may stick to their combination. 

In that case, the three-pronged pace battery (Ranadeb Bose, Saurav Sarkar and Ashok Dinda) appear to test the new Uppal wicket, which has a decent amount of moisture in it. 

Deep however added, The pitch appears to have something for everyone it has grass, cracks on it. At the same time, it has got a good bounce.

Bengal (likely): Arindam Das, Amitava Chakraborty, Avishek Jhunjhunwala, Manoj Tewari, Rohan Gavaskar, Deep Dasgupta (captain), Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Sourashish Lahiri, Ranadeb Bose, Ashok Dinda, Sourav Sarkar.

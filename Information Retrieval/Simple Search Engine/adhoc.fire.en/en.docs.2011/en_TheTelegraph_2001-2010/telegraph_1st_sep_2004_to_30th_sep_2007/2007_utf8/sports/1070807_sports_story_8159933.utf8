 Teams likely to line up for Alonso

 - A contradiction to ask contenders to be rivals as well as teammates

 In happier times: Hamilton and Alonso 

McLaren team principal Ron Dennis can expect a knock on the door soon from rival team bosses bearing bounty. At the head of the queue will be Flavio Briatore, desperate to repatriate Fernando Alonso at Renault. 

Saturdays qualifying debacle here was all the incentive required by Formula Ones ever-ready vultures sensing a fatal breakdown in relations between Alonso and his employers. 

Events in Budapest exacerbated an already fraught set of circumstances at a team struggling to keep two championship balls in the air. Renault would take back Alonso at the drop of a crash helmet, and have suspended negotiations with Giancarlo Fisichella to facilitate that very outcome. BMW have yet to pen a deal with Nick Heidfeld and would not baulk at the cost of signing the world champion. 

Even before Alonso plunged into his own Rascasse moment, emulating the desperate play made by Michael Schumacher during qualifying for the 2006 Monaco Grand Prix, relations between Alonso and the McLaren hierarchy were frazzled. The irony in Budapest was that he actually had his bosses on his side when he took the law into own hands to rain retribution on his non-compliant teammate, Lewis Hamilton. 

In a righteous statement, McLaren Sunday rejected the stewards decision to knock Alonso five places on the grid for his part in the collusion that saw Hamiltons final qualifying lap impeded. 

Despite digging around in the evidence for more than eight hours, the race stewards could find none to support McLarens version of events. Alonso blocked Hamiltons path to pole just as assuredly as Schumacher did his by parking his Ferrari at Rascasse. 

Two things appeared certain to the officials: what happened in the pit lane when Alonso sat idle after the lollipop went skywards with Hamilton stuck behind had little to do with plotting a route through traffic or determining the legitimacy of the tyres. 

Hamilton was probably misguided in refusing to let Alonso through in qualifying as agreed, but botching his final run was no way to deal with it. So how did matters come to such a pretty pass? 

The antecedents are rooted in the difficulty of managing the structural contradiction inherent in F1, which asks championship contenders to be rivals as well as teammates. With only two points separating Hamilton and Alonso, they cant be both. 

Alonso, believes that the weight of McLarens effort should be behind him. McLaren did not expect to have a decision to make in that regard. They did not anticipate the heavyweight punch that Hamilton packs. His emergence as a genuine title contender has forced upon Dennis a need to manage a near-impossible situation. Along the way McLaren have, in the eyes of Alonso, failed him. 

Dennis heavy-handed treatment of Hamilton, who refused numerous requests to allow Alonso to resume track position during the final qualifying session, was probably as much to do with currying favour with a disgruntled champion as slapping down the precocious upstart. It was policy made on the hoof and fatally flawed. 

In the heated exchange between Hamilton and Dennis after qualifying, Dennis appeared to have achieved a rare double alienating both. 

Dennis stubbornly hangs on to the notion that it is possible to plot a course that pleases both contenders. It is extremely challenging to give both drivers equality. But that is our commitment. If the price of equality is a few bumps or even pot holes along the way, we will take that. 

The price might be greater than that. In the mind of Alonso, a decision might already have been made. F1 repairs to the beaches for the next fortnight. Like Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Dennis might find his holiday interrupted. In his case to deal with an outbreak of foot in mouth.

 Jyoti tied 7th, Jeev shares 12th spot

Versailles: Jyoti Randhawa raised visions of mounting a challenge for the title before a double bogey on the penultimate hole wrecked his chances at the Open de France Alstom meet on Sunday. 

After being five-under with four holes to play the leaders were hovering at six and seven-under Randhawa carded a final round of three-under 68, thanks to a birdie on the 18th. 

He finished tied seventh with an overall score of four-under 280, which fetched him a cheque for 110,000 euros. 

Jeev Milkha Singh started the day at tied fifth, but never really got going. He ended with a one-over 72 that saw him finish tied 12th. 

Graeme Storm played a flawless round of five-under 66 and came from five shots behind overnight to emerge champion. A first-time winner, Storm won by a shot from third-round leader, Denmarks Soren Hansen. Storm totalled seven-under par 277. 

Colin Montgomerie led with four holes to go, but two late bogeys left the Scot in a share of third with Thomas Bjorn of Denmark, Irelands Damien McGrane and Englishman Simon Kahn, two strokes behind Storm. 

Randhawa came into the frame with three birdies in a row from the second to the fourth. When he birdied the sixth, he was five-under and in contention. A dropped shot on the sixth was quickly made up for on the ninth. (PTI)

 ICL wont split game, says Dean Jones

Melbourne: Former Australian batsman Dean Jones, recently drafted into the executive board of the Indian Cricket League (ICL), has played down fears that the initiative will split the game in India. 

The cricketer-turned-commentator claimed that the new Twenty20 competition, of which he is the operations manager, will include a mixture of international stars and emerging Indians to help develop players for the Indian national squad. 

Were not trying to be a competitor to the BCCI, Jones was quoted as saying in an Australian daily on Thursday. 

Far from it. If India saw a couple of young lads playing really well in our tournament and they needed them for an India A tour or even the India team, wed welcome the BCCI with open arms and say you can have him. Thats what its all about, Jones said. (PTI)

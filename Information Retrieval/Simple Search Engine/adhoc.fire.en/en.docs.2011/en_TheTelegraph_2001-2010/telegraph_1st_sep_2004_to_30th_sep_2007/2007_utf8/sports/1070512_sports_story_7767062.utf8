The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Anger over raw deal 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Dhaka: In a departure from convention, Bangladeshi journalists reacted very strongly even getting personal with Asian Cricket Council chief executive Syed Ashraful Huq to only one desi player, left-arm spinner Mohammed Rafique, being picked in the Asia XIV for the Afro-Asia Cup. 

They first targeted the countrys nominee on the four-member selection panel, oldie A.F.M. Farooque, and one then went after Huq, who once called the shots in the Bangladesh Cricket Board. 

Huq, who had no role in Fridays selection meeting except acting as convenor for a couple of minutes before the deliberations began, was asked to give his reaction as a Bangladeshi. 

He refused. 

What irked the journalists most is that spearhead Mashrafe Mortaza didnt find a place but Shoaib Akhtar did. Shoaib, it may be recalled, has been off cricket for months. 

The point they tried making, almost violently, is that despite qualifying for the World Cups Super 8 (India, by the way, didnt), Bangladeshi players got a raw deal. 

They werent impressed that no less than four had been selected for the Twenty20 International. 

Former Pakistan opener Mohsin Khan, one of the selectors, remained unfazed. I entered the meeting to pick an Asian team... Thats what my colleagues and I did, he told The Telegraph.

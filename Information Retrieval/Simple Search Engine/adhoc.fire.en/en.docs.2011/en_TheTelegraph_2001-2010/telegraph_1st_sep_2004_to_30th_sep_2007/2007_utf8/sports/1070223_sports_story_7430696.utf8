 Im raring to go: Pathan 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Irfan Pathan in New Delhi on Thursday 

New Delhi: The loss of form in the recent months has taken its toll on Irfan Pathan, but the left-arm bowler from Baroda is relieved that it has come quite early in his career. 

Speaking during a promotional function in the capital on Thursday, the bowler said he would overcome the slump in his form to come back with a bang in the World Cup. Sudden slump in form is one thing that every cricketer in the world normally goes through at some point of his career, he said. 

Perhaps I am lucky that I experienced it at an early age. I am only 22 and it would be easier for me to come out of it at this point in time. As one grows older, it becomes more and more difficult to handle such problems, he said. 

Pathan said he was feeling extremely confident because of his fitness. I am completely fit now and raring to go, he said. When asked about his shoulder injury, the star cricketer smiled and said it had become a thing of the past.

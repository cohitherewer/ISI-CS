 Street Sense wins Kentucky Derby 

 Louisville: Street Sense produced a dramatic run to win the Kentucky Derby on Saturday and become the first Breeders Cup juvenile champion to capture Americas most celebrated race.

 Ridden by local jockey Calvin Borel, the dark bay Kentucky-bred rallied from next-to-last in the 20-horse race to wear down Hard Spun and win by 2-1/2 lengths.

 I had an awesome horse, said Borel, winning his first Derby. It was the chance of a lifetime. Hard work always pays off. Ive always dreamed of winning this race.

 Shoaib Malik likely to lead Pakistan

 Shoaib Malik 

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has decided to appoint allrounder Shoaib Malik as the new captain in case Younis Khan doesnt relent from his refusal to accept the job, sources said on Tuesday. 

The decision has been taken that Malik will be the next captain on a short term basis. But even his appointment is subject to Younis Khan not changing his position about not accepting the captaincy, a well-placed source in the PCB said. 

Former captain Imran Khan and some members of the board feel that the chairman should make one last attempt to convince Younis to change his mind. If that does not happen, Malik is then the unanimous choice, he said. 

What has been decided is that Malik should be named captain for the one-day International against India at Lords in July for the Prince Charles charity and for the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa in September, the source said. 

He will also be retained to lead the team in the home series against South Africa and then on the tour of India in November after which his performance would be reviewed, the source added. 

He said that the board had decided on Malik with an eye on the future but it was going to appoint him for a short term because the allrounder was yet to command a regular place in the Test team at No. 6. 

Only the names of Malik and Salman Butt were discussed as possible captaincy options. Mohammed Yousuf, Shahid Afridi or Abdul Razzaq were never in consideration, the source confirmed. 

He said the members had ruled against Yousuf as they felt making him captain would again raise the issue of the players giving more time to religious activities rather than just focusing on cricket, a problem which was also encountered with Inzamam-ul Haq. 

The source said the board could still stick to its policy of having the same captain for both Tests and ODIs. Malik, who is playing for Punjab in Karachi in a domestic first-class match, refused to comment on his future. 

I cant say anything at this stage. First let the board decide and then I will speak, he said. 

Younis had refused the captaincy saying he was deeply hurt and under stress after the hostile reception given to the team following the poor performance in the World Cup. 

Yousuf has, however, already said that he had no problems playing under anyone else if the board didnt appoint him as captain. 

The captaincy is not a big issue for me. I said before I would gladly accept it if offered by the board but I am not greedy for it. I am happy to continue playing for my country under anyone. The aim is to revive the respect of our team once again after the World Cup disappointment, he said. (PTI)

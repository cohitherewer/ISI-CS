 Steelers beat Shers

Chandigarh: Pakistani goalkeeper Salman Akbars brilliant effort helped Orissa Steelers beat Sher-E-Jalandhar 3-1 in the shoot-out after both the teams were locked 1-1, in a Premier Hockey League (PHL) match here on Wednesday. 

Akbar saved three goals in the shoot-out as Steelers salvaged two points and maintained their lead in PHL. 

In a high-voltage match, Sher-E-Jallandhar failed to close the gap at the top as Orissa went ahead in the sixth minute. Shers, who played attacking hockey in the second-half, equalised in the 51st minute. 

In the shoot-out, Orissa scored thrice while Shers managed only one. Dilip Tirkey, Birendra Lakra and Damandeep Singh scored for Orissa while Prabodh Tirkey missed. 

For Shers, only Santi Freixa scored. Baljit Dhillon, Tejbir Singh and Gurvinder Singhs attempts were brilliantly saved by Orissa custodian Salman Akbar. 

Prabodh Tirkey, who fell back repeatedly to assist the defence, played an excellent game thwarting many raids.

 Team India stress on fielding skills

Calcutta: Innovations like Edward Bonos thinking caps or paramilitary training seem to have gone with Greg Chappell. But the Australians stress on reaching the next level by improving physical fitness has found support in the new regime. 

The third day of the ongoing conditioning camp for the tour of Bangladesh was more about sharpening fielding skills and agility and less about traditional batting and bowling at nets, the sole distraction perhaps being the injury to a groundsman. 

There was emphasis on some key areas of concern of the previous coach. Like a good throwing technique and running between the wickets. 

If new bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad supervised the running between wickets in mock match situations, fielding coach Robin Singhs accent was on activities all around the park. 

Rifling in throws and sprinting hard to hit the single stump dominated. Players were divided into several batches and each ones fitness was tested to the hilt during these drills, orchestrated by Singh and physio John Gloster. 

The focus on specific areas followed constant discussions between cricket manager Ravi Shastri, captain Rahul Dravid and the support staff. 

Sachin Tendulkar continued to spend times in knocking the balls as Gloster was yet to let him go full blast at the nets. The batting maestro underwent a special exercise regime with yoga expert Sukhdev Kumar in the morning. 

The Singapore-based Kumar also sat with the bowlers for a 20-minute session. 

The only aberration from all this was the injury to a groundsman, Gouranga Swain. He was working on a pitch next to the one where players were practising running between the wickets. 

A run-out attempt by Vikram Rajvir Singh saw the ball strike Swain on his right knee. 

Apart from Sachin, no other player came to see him as he lay on the ground in pain. Robin Uthappa gave him a cursory look. 

Swain was taken out of the ground by fellow groundmen, to the CABs medical unit. He was released after preliminary medical attention.

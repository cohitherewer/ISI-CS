Calcutta: Fifa is contemplating a one-week seminar for Indian coaches. The refreshment course, suggested by Fifa officials David Borja and Jean Mitchel Benezet, will be preceded by the introduction of the professional league, sometime around October this year. 

Having met the club officials and bodies in Mumbai, Goa and Bangalore, Borja (development manager) and Benezet (technical advisor), on Thursday met four city clubs and IFA secretary Subrata Dutta in an assessment meeting, that lasted for about six hours. 

AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco was also present. 

Later, Dutta said: They (Fifa officials) suggested that a club should have 25 players but not more than 30 and the clubs should select players carefully Fifa and AFC have selected India as one of the 10 countries to develop the sport. 

We are hoping that the professional league will be modelled like Bundesliga, though it may take some time, Dutta said, adding Fifa may also fund the development of the professional league this is just the beginning.

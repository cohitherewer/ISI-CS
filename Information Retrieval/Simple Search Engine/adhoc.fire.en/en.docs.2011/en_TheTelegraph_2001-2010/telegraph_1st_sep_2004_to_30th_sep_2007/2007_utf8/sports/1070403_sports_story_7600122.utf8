 Cautious Md. Sporting take on Dempo

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting and Dempo SC will clash with each other with different objectives in their Round XI match of the National Football League on Tuesday. While Biswajit Bhattacharyas side, struggling in the relegation zone, will adopt a cautious approach, the second-placed Dempo are looking for full points at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

Biswajit knows its a steep mountain to climb as far as collecting a point, let alone a win, is concerned. With seven points from 10 matches and being placed ninth in the 10-team table, the former India striker is just about keeping fingers crossed. 

The selection of players was not right in the very beginning, but nothing can be done now. We can only try hard to stay afloat and hope for the best, he said on the eve of the match. 

The black-and-whites are likely to miss the services of Liberian forward Preston Papai Corporal through injury. He didnt even attend the practice session on Monday. 

Biswajit, however, spelled out his strategy clearly. We will wait and watch how the proceedings shape up in the first session.

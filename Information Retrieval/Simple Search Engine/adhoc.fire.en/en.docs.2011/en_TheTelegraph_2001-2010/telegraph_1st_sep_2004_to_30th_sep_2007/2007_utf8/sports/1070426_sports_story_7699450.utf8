 SHARP SINGLES 

Red carpet for the Irish

Dublin: Irelands giant-killing cricket team has arrived home from the World Cup to a heroes welcome,

 a diary full of celebrations and hints that a new international cricket ground

 may be built in Dublin.

The World Cup debutants were expected to play three group games but after a shock win against former champions Pakistan, they pushed through to the second round to beat Test side Bangladesh, leapfrogging to 10th in the one-day world rankings. 

Its been a dream come true, said captain Trent Johnston as he and his team made their way through several hundred cheering well-wishers at Dublin airport on Tuesday night after flying back from the West Indies. Among those waiting to congratulate the side, whose success ignited national pride in a sport largely forgotten in Ireland, was Irish sports minister John Donoghue, who described their efforts as Herculean.

Lanka President for final

 Colombo: Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse will fly to Barbados to cheer the national team in the World Cup final later this week, a senior aide said on Wednesday. 

It is almost certain that the President will leave on Thursday at the invitation of the Prime Minister of Barbados, said Chandrapala Liyanage, a senior Presidential aide. The Presidents visit is to mark the appreciation of the efforts of the cricketers in reaching the final, Liyanage said.

 Not thinking too far: Gambhir

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Dhaka: For someone who has been in and out of the team, Gautam Gambhir did not show the lack of confidence when he took guard on Saturday. Rather, he looked determined to make a mark. 

The 101 may not cement his place in the side but it certainly brings him back to the selectors spotlight post-World Cup. I just want to concentrate and thats very important. Playing each and every game for India is like a dream but I am not thinking too far, he said after the match. 

It feels good I was getting the starts and it was important to carry on from there. I thought this was the right time because we were 1-0 up and to seal the series the innings was be very important. 

How did he pace his innings? It was very important that one of the top four must continue to bat as long as possible, may be till the 40th over. Thats what I did. It was on my mind and luckily that happened, Gambhir explained. 

How would he rate his second hundred? Being on the winning side and getting a hundred always makes you feel great. When I got my first hundred (versus Sri Lanka in Ahmedabad 2005) we ended up losing the match. But today it feels great that we won the series and I got a hundred, the Man-of-the-Match said. 

Did the cramps make it tough? I had a lot of cramps but it was important from the teams point of view that I continue to play a long innings.

 Roger wants roof over showcourt

Paris: Roger Federer wants French Open organisers to follow the example of the Australian Open and Wimbledon by building a roof over a showcourt at Roland Garros. 

Rain washed away all but 14 matches on the opening two days of the claycourt Grand Slam, leaving thousands of fans drenched and frustrated. 

In Melbourne Park the two main courts have a retractable roof and Wimbledon is building a similar structure over its Centre Court in London. 

Im always for having the option, said the world No.1 after his first-round win over American Michael Russell spilled over to a second day. 

The TVs and fans come to the stadium and plan a day at Roland Garros, for instance, they would be so happy to see us play no matter what conditions. 

So thats why Australia is so good. They always have the opportunity. Other tournaments have it, too. Wimbledon is making a big step forward and I think it would be good for every tournament to have something like this. 

I know budget doesnt always allow it but I would guess this tournament has the cash so it should not be a problem. 

About the match, the top-ranked Swiss star said: I played well when I had to so it was a good opening match for me. 

The conditions are tough for everybody, Federer said after miserable weather ruined the first two days of action at the showcase claycourt tournament. 

Its kind of cool today, windy, and its been raining the last few days, so we havent had much of a chance to hit tennis balls. But I was in a comfortable position going into today and I played okay. 

Federer, whose best result here was his final defeat by Rafael Nadal last year, is bidding to become the third man to win four Grand Slams in a row after Don Budge and Rod Laver. 

The elegant allrounder, who will meet Frenchman Thierry Ascione in the next round, boosted his morale before coming to Paris by beating Spains Nadal for the first time on clay in the Hamburg final. 

Its certainly an advantage because I have defeated him on all surfaces, Federer said of his rivalry with Nadal, who has a 100 per cent French Open record, having won the title the last two years. 

It means Im able to do it. So when I play against him, Im more confident. 

The mens final everybody wants to see here would be a clash between Federer and world number two Nadal on centre court on June 10 but the Swiss said he was not focusing only on the muscular Spaniard.

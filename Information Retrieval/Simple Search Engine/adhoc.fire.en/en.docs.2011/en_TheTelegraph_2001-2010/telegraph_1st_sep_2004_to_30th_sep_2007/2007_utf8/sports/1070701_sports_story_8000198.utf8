Boom: India finally got their penalty corner drill right as they beat Japan 4-3 in their concluding league fixture to qualify for the third place play-off in the Champions Challenge hockey tournament here today. 

Goals by Sandeep Singh (7th), Prabhjot Singh (22nd, 34th) and Dilip Tirkey (48th) set up the Indian win with Kenichi Katayama (12th), Takahiko Yamamori (47th) and Kazuhiro Tsubouchi (65th) replying for japan. 

The hard-fought victory, their third in five matches, helped India finish third on nine points behind New Zealand (11) and Argentina (10) in the league phase. Japan remained on three points. 

Two goals each by Matt Daly and Simon Mantell carried England to a 6-2 win over Belgium and set up a bronze medal play-off against India 

With no hope of qualifying for Sundays final, after the 3-3 draw between New Zealand and Argentina, the Indians played far more freely and were under less pressure. 

Also, with the Japanese midfield virtually non-existent, the Indians had plenty of time to launch their attacks. They converted three of the six penalty corners that came their way. 

But then, the Indian defence, when under the infrequent attacks that the Japanese came up with, appeared rather tentative. 

India dominated the first half and launched a series of attacks to keep Japan pegged in their own half. 

However, during the few Japanese counter-attacks, the Indian defence appeared vulnerable and conceded four penalty corners. 

More significantly, the Indian teams inability to hold the ball in the final minutes was yet again highlighted and with a few more minutes on the clock, things could have gone awry for them. 

Attacking from the start, the Indians forged ahead in the seventh minute when Sandeep converted the first penalty corner with a powerful drag-flick to the roof of the net. (PTI)

London: Goals from substitute forward Simao Sabrosa and central defender Ricardo Carvalho in the final eight minutes gave Portugal a 2-0 win over Brazil in a friendly international at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday. 

Quaresma chipped over a lovely cross from the right and Simao darted in front of central defender Luisao to hit the ball first time low into the corner past keeper Helton to put Portugal in front in the 82nd minute. 

Carvalho hooked home a cross in the final minute to secure the victory that gave Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari his second win over his home country since a 2-1 victory in Porto in 2003. 

It was Dungas first defeat in six internationals as Brazil coach since taking over from Carlos Alberto Parreira after last years World Cup. It leaves the Brazilians, who have won 11 of their 17 meetings with Portugal, still looking for their first win over their old rivals since 1989. 

Brazil had the better of the first half, forcing Portugal into isolated counter-attacks and the South Americans came close to going ahead two minutes before the interval when centre back and captain Lucio hit the bar from close in following a free-kick. 

Lively midfielder Elano served notice of what to expect when he brought a save from Ricardo in the fourth minute, the keeper tipping his free-kick from the right wing over the bar. 

But Elano faded in the second half and was unable to repeat his two-goal performance against Argentina when Brazil beat their arch-rivals 3-0 at the same ground in September. 

Kaka, dominant in the first half, also faded and Brazil lost their grip on midfield after the break with Portugal gradually making more and more inroads into the defence but not before several first half scares. 

There was good quality play from end to end and no shortage of passion despite the friendly tag to the delight of a crowd of nearly 60,000. Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari later said the win meant more in terms of preparation for their next European qualifier than personal satisfaction. 

Victory over a team that has been top of the world rankings and five-time world champion gives us more self-esteem and confidence before our next Euro qualifying match against Belgium, Scolari, who led Brazil to the fifth of those world titles in 2002, told a post-match news conference. 

It was a good technical game and I think the English fans enjoyed it. It was very much from the South American school of football, but Portugal are part of the South American school. More importantly, I think they gained a lot of confidence from the victory. It was a good chance to see some new players and observe how they reacted. 

Scolari also said that Manchester United winger Cristiano Ronaldo, who was 22 on Monday, was made captain at the request of Carlos Silva, the vice-president of the Portuguese FA, who died on Sunday. 

Scolari explained: On Saturday, Mr Silva asked me to make him captain as a gesture. He thought the English fans would give him a difficult time and this was a response. He is too young to be captain, but Mr Silva asked me, and now he is no longer with us. 

A period of silence was observed before kickoff to mark his death. Ronaldo also asked the Portuguese FA not to organise any birthday celebrations as a mark of respect for Silvas death. 

Dunga braved a very cold night in north London wearing a garish shirt that looked like it would have been more at home in a 1970s disco than in the technical area of a football ground. I wore this shirt and no jacket because the adrenalin rush of the match kept me warm, he said. He added: When you lose its always hard, a complete frustration.

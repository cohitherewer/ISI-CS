 Must-win match for Bagan vs Pahang FA

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan seek to go all out in their AFC Cup Group F match against Pahang FA of Malaysia at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. 

The city club faces a must win match to book a quarter final berth but a lot will also depend on the Group E encounter between Mahindra United and New Radiant in Maldives, also slated for Tuesday. 

Mahindra have nine points from five matches and a win will help them move to the next round as the best runners-up team. 

Bagan, have eight points from as many games (two wins, two losses, one draw). 

Bagan coach Bernard Operanozie said his team had no other choice but to play an attacking game. 

Our performance at the National Football League was much below expectations. So the pressure to deliver the best will always be there, Bagan coach said. 

Pahang FA do not have a foreigner in their ranks, and Bernard felt that did not mean any advantage for them. 

Thats not an issue. I dont think its going to help us in anyway. We have to play very well and qualify for the next round, the Bagan coach said. 

The home side will find the going tough with Bhaichung Bhutia and Mehtab Hossain ruled out due to double bookings. 

Skipper Jose Ramirez Barreto and Dipendu Biswas are expected to lead the attack. Pachau Lalampuia will be used when needed. 

A lot will depend on Bagans midfielders Satyajit Bose, Suman Dutta, Mehrajudin Wadoo and Chinmoy Sarkar. 

Incidentally, the green-and-maroon brigade had defeated Pahang FA 2-1 in their away match. 

Pahang FA, who are already out of the tournament, appeared relaxed. A downpour Monday evening forced them to skip practice. Manager Zanial Abidin Hasan said: We dont have any hopes of qualifying for the next round. Its only a regulation match for us. 

We know it will not be easy. Keeping in mind the transfer season back home, I expect the players to put up a good show, Hasan said.

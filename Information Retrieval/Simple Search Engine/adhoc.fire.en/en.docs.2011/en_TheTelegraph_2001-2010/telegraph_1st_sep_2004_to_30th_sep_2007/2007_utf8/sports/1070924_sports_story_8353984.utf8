 Fitness test for Sehwag

Johannesburg: Star Indian opener Virender Sehwag will have to clear a fitness test Monday before he can play in the final of the ICC World Twenty20 against Pakistan. Sehwag picked up the injury while batting in Saturdays semi-final against Australia, after which he had to take a runner. 

India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni admitted the injury had cast a cloud of doubt over the openers prospect of playing but he exuded confidence that the Delhi batsman would clear the fitness test Monday. 

Hopefully he should be fine. His fitness will be assessed on the morning of the match, Dhoni said. 

Talking about the teams success in the ICC World Twenty20, Dhoni said its because of individuals who have played their part in building up a cohesive unit. There are no superstars in this team. 

The new skipper was all praise for Sreesanths brilliant spell and getting the key wickets of Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden. 

Dhoni revealed that Harbhajan Singh had himself volunteered to bowl the 18th over when Australia needed 30 in three overs. India may have never lost to their arch-rivals in the World Cup but Dhoni refused to be complacent. 

As far as history is concerned, it has got nothing to do with cricket. Theres always a first time. So if we start believing that just because we have never lost to Pakistan in a World Cup we are going to sail through, that is not going to happen, he said. 

Asked what Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly would be thinking back home after deciding to skip this meet, Dhoni said, I am sure if they had been here, they would have taken us to the final. If we do win the final, then I can say that they couldnt have done more than what his team has done. The way we have performed has been amazing. 

Simon Taufel and Mark Benson will officiate on Monday, while Daryl Harper and Billy Doctrove will be the third and fourth umpires, respectively. Ranjan Madugalle will be the Match Referee. (PTI)

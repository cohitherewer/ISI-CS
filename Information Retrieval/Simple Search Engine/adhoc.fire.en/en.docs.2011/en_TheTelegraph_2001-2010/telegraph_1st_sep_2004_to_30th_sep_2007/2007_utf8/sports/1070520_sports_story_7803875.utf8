The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 JCT finish second

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: It was a day that East Bengal would like to forget in the 2006-07 National Football League. Nothing went right for them be it in Barasat or Margao. 

While at Barasat Stadium they went down 2-3 to JCT, in Margao Churchill Brothers won 4-1 against Air India as they city giants, who were eyeing a third spot, finished fifth. A win here and a draw or loss by Churchill in Margao would have earned them a third spot. 

JCT had everything to celebrate after logging in 22 points in the second leg. 

Stepping up the momentum right from the start, JCT went 1-0 up in the fifth minute. East Bengal equalised through Boniface Ambani. 

A Sunil Chhetri brace (30th and 34th minutes) saw the Punjab team take an unassailable 3-1 lead. East Bengal reduced the margin through Ashim Biswas but that was not enough. 

In Margao, the win helped Churchill Brothers finish fourth. Odafa Okolie and George Ekeh scored a brace each, the former emerging top scorer with 18 goals.

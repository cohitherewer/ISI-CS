 Pain in the ear for umpires

St Georges: What was seen as an experiment

 to improve umpiring standards, is fast turning out to be a pain in the ear. 

The International Cricket Council (ICC) had announced at the start of the World Cup that umpires would be plugged to the stump microphone with an ear-piece to enable them detect the faintest of nicks. 

The feedback has started to come now, and the on-field umpires have disapproved the concept. All kind of sounds keep coming in. After we come out of a match we are stone deaf, said an Elite umpire in disgust. 

We have this asinine situation where batsmen are marking their guards, wicketkeepers thumping their gloves, close-in fielders adjusting their boxes and helmets, all types of words and encouragement to fellow fielders and it becomes a real pain. 

Indeed, there is so much sound coming from the stump microphone that you cant really pick up the so-called faint edge, remarked the umpire. 

Earlier, the situation was better. We used to rely on natural sound and our eyesight to make a decision. Now its different. 

According to this respected umpire, all kind of noises create the same sound on the microphone. 

This is the worst part. The sound from a bat is similar to the sound from the pads or gloves. You cant really tell if it was an edge or it had gone from the pads. 

Imagine standing in this heat of Grenada and being plugged in for eight hours a day. Its a bigger strain and if anything it can make umpires commit more mistakes than they normally do. 

Most of ICCs technical experiments in the past have been similar disasters. It was decided during the Super Series in Australia that umpires could even make their leg-before ruling going by the evidence of television coverage. 

That too was not fool-proof at all. For example, in Grenada, Stephen Fleming was given out leg before to Chaminda Vaas. The hawk-eye showed that the ball had swerved out on pitching and could have missed the off-stump. But the common consensus was that the ball was coming in and the batsman was plumb in front of stumps. (PTI)

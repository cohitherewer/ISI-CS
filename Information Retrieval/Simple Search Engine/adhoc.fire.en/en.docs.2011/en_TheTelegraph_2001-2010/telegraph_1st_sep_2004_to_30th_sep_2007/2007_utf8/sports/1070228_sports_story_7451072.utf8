 Greg is the 12th man in Dream Team

Sydney: Cricket Australia on Tuesday announced Australias greatest one-day International dream team since the introduction of the short form of the game. 

Steve Waugh was named captain of the 12-man team, which includes four members of the squad which will fly to the Caribbean on Wednesday to defend the World Cup. 

Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist, Andrew Symonds and Glenn McGrath have all been included, plus the injured Brett Lee, who will not travel to the Caribbean. 

They were named alongside Shane Warne, Mark Waugh, Dean Jones, Michael Bevan and Dennis Lillee with Greg Chappell the 12th man in a fairly straightforward team. 

But record-breaking captain Allan Border, who led Australia to the countrys first World Cup victory in 1987, was a surprise omission from the team. Border captained Australia a record 178 times and his 273 overall one-day appearances are second only to Steve Waugh (325). 

The side was voted on by all 163 players to have represented Australia since the inception of one-day cricket in 1971. 

There are some great players who have missed out on the side and thats always going to be the case, Steve said. Going across different eras, its almost impossible to pick the side. I think everyone here feels very privileged to be picked, especially me, for being the captain. 

There are a number of players who should have been sitting here in the side Allan Border and a number of other players. 

Waugh only named 11 players, with relative newcomer Mike Hussey earning a middle-order spot ahead of Border. 

A two-time World Cup winner, Lehmann was an honourable mention, making the shortlist of 30 but missing out on the final 12, along with fellow batsman Damien Martyn. 

Lee earned a spot due to his impressive one-day strike-rate of 28.94, but his economy rate of 4.69 runs per over leaves plenty to be desired.

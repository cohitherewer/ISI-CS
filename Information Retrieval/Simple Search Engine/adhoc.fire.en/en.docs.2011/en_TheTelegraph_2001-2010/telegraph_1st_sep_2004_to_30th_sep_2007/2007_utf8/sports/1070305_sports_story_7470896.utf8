 Experience is our strength: Jayawardene

Bridgetown: Mahela Jayawardene on Sunday said Sri Lanka have the resources and experience to replicate their 1996 success. 

Our strength lies in experience. We have quality in both batting and bowling and we boast of players who are willing to put the teams interest above everything else, the Sri Lanka captain said on the eve of his teams first practice match against Scotland. 

The Lankans second practice match is against New Zealand on Friday. 

We have been playing good cricket for the last 12 months and we are planning more of the same. 

We have a great team and I am dreaming of winning the trophy again. We won back in 1996 and the people are expecting great things from us, Jayawardene said. 

Things are going well and we are very excited to be here, the Lankan captain said. 

We are looking forward to this week here in the West Indies and we are here to play some really good cricket and look for the big prize, he said. 

The mega event, featuring 16 teams and involving 51 matches, runs from March 13 to April 28. 

Sri Lanka are in group B and play their opening match against Bermuda at Port of Spain, Trinidad, on March 15. 

India and Bangladesh are the other two teams in the group.

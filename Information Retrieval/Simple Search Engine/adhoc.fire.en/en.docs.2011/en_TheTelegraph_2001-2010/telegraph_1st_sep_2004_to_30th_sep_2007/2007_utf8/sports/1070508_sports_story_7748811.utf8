The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Highs and lows on road to glory

The following is a match-by-match analysis of Manchester Uniteds Premiership triumph: 

 Aug. 20: Vs Fulham (home) Won 5-1. Four-nil up after 20 minutes, while Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney bury their World Cup differences. A perfect start. 

 Aug. 23: Vs Charlton Athletic (away) Won 3-0. Ronaldo excels on first visit to away ground since becoming hate figure as United easily overcome suspensions of Rooney and Paul Scholes. 

 Aug. 26: Vs Watford (a) Won 2-1. United are given a few scares as Michael Carrick makes first start. 

 Sept. 9: Vs Tottenham Hotspur (h) Won 1-0. Ryan Giggss header decides it, but Tottenham deserve a draw. 

 Sept. 17: Vs Arsenal (h) Lost 0-1. Gilberto Silva misses early penalty but Emmanuel Adebayors late strike inflicts what remains Uniteds only defeat in 28 home games this season. 

 Sept. 23: Vs Reading (a) Drew 1-1. United are desperately unlucky only to draw their first meeting with Reading and thus fail to displace Chelsea at the Premierships summit. 

 Oct. 1: Vs Newcastle United (h) Won 2-0. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer scores twice and Ronaldo hits the woodwork three times as Newcastle offer pathetic resistance. 

 Oct. 14: Vs Wigan Athletic (a) Won 3-1. Giggs, who is making his first appearance for a month, arrives as a substitute with United behind at half-time and inspires their recovery. 

 Oct. 22: Vs Liverpool (h) Won 2-0. Scholes scores on his 500th appearance for the club as Liverpool slip 11 points behind United. 

 Oct. 28: Vs Bolton Wanderers (a) Won 4-0. Rooney scores a hattrick, two in an opening quarter in which United are devastating. 

 Nov. 4: Vs Portsmouth (h) Won 3-0. Two early goals set up another superb performance. 

 Nov. 11: Vs Blackburn Rovers (a) Won 1-0. Rooney misses two sitters but Louis Saha, brilliant in the first half of the season before injury intervened, scores the winner. 

 Nov. 18: Vs Sheffield United (a) Won 2-1. After falling behind, United are denied two penalties, but Rooneys double ensures win. 

 Nov. 26: Vs Chelsea (h) Drew 1-1. Saha puts United ahead, but Ricardo Carvalhos header rewards Chelseas strong second-half showing. 

 Nov. 29: Vs Everton (h) Won 3-0. United come through a scrappy game notable for Gary and Phil Neville opposing each other as captains. 

 Dec. 2: Vs Middlesbrough (a) Won 2-1. Ronaldo dives to win the penalty that gives United the lead and, after Middlesbrough equalise, Darren Fletcher quickly restores the advantage. 

 Dec. 9: Vs Manchester City (h) Won 3-1. Another outstanding display by Ronaldo as City fail to end 32-year winless run at Old Trafford. 

 Dec. 17: Vs West Ham United (a) Lost 0-1. United dominate but lose in Alan Curbishleys first match in charge of West Ham. 

 Dec. 23: Vs Aston Villa (a) Won 3-0. Ronaldo is again the inspiration, but Scholes strikes a spectacular volleyed goal. 

 Dec. 26: Vs Wigan Athletic (h) Won 3-1. United rest half the team and struggle in a goalless first half, but Ronaldos half-time introduction changes the game. 

 Dec. 30: Vs Reading (h) Won 3-2. Ronaldo scores his third successive double in a hugely one-sided affair a day before Sir Alex Fergusons 65th birthday. 

 Jan. 1: Vs Newcastle United (a) Drew 2-2. The home team prevents United moving nine points clear at the top of the table with a late equaliser by David Edgar, the teenaged defender. 

 Jan. 13: Vs Aston Villa (h) Won 3-1. An easy win as Carrick marks his continuing improvement with his first United goal. 

 Jan. 21: Vs Arsenal (a) Lost 1-2. United lose to two late goals but thanks to Arsenals inconsistency during the season, they are no title threat. 

 Jan. 31: Vs Watford (h) Won 4-0. United conclude the match with 46 successive passes, summing up the lopsided contest. 

 Feb. 4: Vs Tottenham Hotspur (a) Won 4-0. John Shea ends the game in goal after Edwin van der Sar breaks his nose, but United fans start to smell the title. 

 Feb. 10: Vs Charlton Athletic (h) Won 2-0. United fail to hit the heights in a victory sealed by Rooneys late goal. 

 Feb. 24: Vs Fulham (a) Won 2-1. Fergusons team are decidedly second best but snatch victory through Ronaldos late breakaway goal. 

 March 3: Vs Liverpool (a) Won 1-0. United have probably not been so outplayed for years in the Premiership, yet win through Sheas scrambled late goal. 

 March 17: Vs Bolton Wanderers (h) Won 4-1. Three early goals see off a weak challenge from the visitors. 

 March 31: Vs Blackburn Rovers (h) Won 4-1. United trail at the interval, but their second-half display matches the first half away to Bolton in October as their best spell of play this season. 

 April 7: Vs Portsmouth (a) Lost 1-2. United are slightly unlucky to lose at their bogey ground, but a poor performance even so. 

 April 17: Vs Sheffield United (h) Won 2-0. Another below-par showing, but still a comfortable win. 

 April 21: Vs Middlesbrough (h) Drew 1-1. United pay for leaving inform Giggs on the bench in the first half, while Middlesbrough are denied a penalty when Shea fouls Lee Dong Gook. 

 April 28: Vs Everton (a) Won 4-2. United overcome two-goal deficit with four goals in the last half-hour, including an own goal by Phil Neville. 

 May 5: Vs Manchester City (a) Won 1-0. Off-colour display, but Ronaldos penalty and Darius Vassells miss from the spot for City clinch the title for United. 

 May 9: To play Chelsea (a). 

 May 13: To play West Ham United (h).

Durham: Paul Collingwood scored 128, his fifth century, to put England in control against the West Indies in the fourth and final Test on Monday. 

England reached 400 in reply to West Indies 287 and then reduced the tourists to 83 for three at stumps when bad light stopped play to boost their chances of winning the series 3-0. West Indies trail by 30 runs. 

Chris Gayle (52 from 63 balls) and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (16) were unbeaten at close and the West Indies will be required to bat for most of the final day on Tuesday to draw the game. 

Devon Smith, opening instead of captain Daren Ganga, lasted three balls before he was adjudged leg-before to Matthew Hoggard, who also dismissed Ganga, caught behind for six. Ganga has failed to reach double figures in his last six innings of the series. 

Runako Morton then played on to spinner Monty Panesar. Gayle reached his first half-century of the series, while Chanderpaul, who was unbeaten on 136 in the first innings, has not been dismissed in 852 minutes. 

The day belonged to Collingwood, batting on his home ground, as he rescued his team from a perilous situation. England were 133 for five in the morning session after the loss of Andrew Strauss for 77 to Fidel Edwards, who finished with five for 112. 

When wicketkeeper Matt Prior (62) came to the crease they were 165 for six and still 122 runs behind the tourists. But the duo then consolidated before attacking an increasingly dispirited West Indian attack. 

Collingwood paced his innings perfectly, and though he brought up his 50 with a lucky edge through vacant third slip for four much to the frustration of Morton and Dwayne Bravo who thumped the ground in anger, he was mostly solid. 

Collingwood survived a vocal leg-before appeal when on 59 after one well-directed Powell in-swinger looked as though it would have clipped his leg stump, according to replays. 

Prior registered his half-century by coming down the wicket to seamer Corey Collymore and chipping the ball over midwicket for six. 

The runs flowed comfortably and 29 runs were scored off the first two overs with the new ball. The latter of these, bowled by Edwards, allowed three Collingwood boundaries and the second one, a pull, gave him three figures. 

Collingwood celebrated with an animated leap in the air and a roar of joy as West Indies fielders heads dropped. 

Fast bowler Edwards finally had Prior caught at deep square leg 15 minutes before team, the only wicket in the session, to give him his fifth five-wicket haul in Tests. 

West Indies, who were eyeing a first Test win in 20 matches after Sundays play, became further demoralised when number 10 Ryan Sidebottom blasted 26 not out from 19 balls and put on 31 with Panesar for the last wicket. 

Opener Strauss earlier missed the opportunity to score his first Test hundred since August. 

 Bell hung around for 49 minutes 

 for 11 but perished two balls after drinks when Powell persuaded 

 him to play a loose drive outside off stump and Morton claimed 

 a sharp chance at gully.

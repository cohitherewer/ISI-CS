The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Clay dusted off, greens beckon Roger

 Roger Federer 

London: Roger Federer will shake off his latest Roland Garros mugging, wrap himself up in his trusted All England Club security blanket and target Bjorn Borgs record of five successive Wimbledon titles when the championship starts on Monday. 

Having seen his latest bid for Grand Slam immortality shot down once again by Rafael Nadal on the French Open clay, the world No. 1 returns to the grass of Centre Court where he is the undoubted ruler. 

Victory on July 8 will place the Swiss just two titles shy of Pete Samprass record of seven Wimbledon crowns and level Borgs five-in-a-row effort from 1976-1980. 

Few will bet against the 25-year-old going on to become the both the all-time Wimbledon king and Grand Slam title collector as a win here would give Federer his 11th major. The record-holder is Sampras with 14. 

Despite Nadal again shattering his hopes of becoming just the third man in history to hold all four Grand Slam titles at the same time, Federer insists that defeat in Paris will have no bearing on his Wimbledon campaign. 

Its always easy to forget the clay season because there was so much talk about it. Once you get on the grass, great. If you lose, you kind of forget about it. Im very excited about the grass season. Everything is in the past, he said. 

This is a huge opportunity for me once again, to win Wimbledon. And hopefully win my fifth in a row, that would be absolutely incredible. 

Borg is getting used to seeing his records matched at Roland Garros, Nadal equalled his three consecutive French Open titles. 

The Swedish legend has already had reason to be grateful to Federer after the Swisss shock win over Sampras in 2001 stopped the American from also becoming a five-in-a-row Wimbledon winner. 

I have always seen an awful lot of myself in Roger, the way he approaches the game, the way he carries himself, Borg said in a magazine interview. 

He doesnt always let everything show on the surface, all of the emotion, but he cares about it strongly underneath. Off court he is very relaxed. Hes a very cool guy. 

Cool indeed. 

Last year, Federer felt so comfortable in south-west London that he dared to stroll onto court resplendent in a cream blazer with his own crest sewn into the breast pocket. 

His record meant he could get away with it. Hes on a 48-match winning streak on grass with 28 in succession coming at Wimbledon.

 Dhoni hits 37 n.o. in Jharkhand 

 win

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mahendra Singh Dhoni perhaps needed some time to get used to the conditions under the scorching heat. 

On Thursday the Team India wicketkeeper helped Jharkhand to an eight-wicket win over Assam in the National (East Zone) Twenty20 tournament at the Eden. Dhoni remained unbeaten on 37 from 21 balls. Incidentally, the first two matches he played yielded only 13 runs (one versus Orissa and 12 versus Bengal). 

Batting first on hard wicket, Assam didnt do that bad posting 141 for nine. But it was Dhoni who made all the difference scoring at a brisk pace to help his team achieve the target in 17.1 overs losing just two wickets. The Dhoni blitzkrieg was studded with four boundaries and one hit over the rope. 

Manish Vardhan led from the front with an effective 64, while Subroto Ghosh contributed with a run-a-ball 28.In another match, Orissa won against Tripura. 

 SUMMARISED SCORES 

 Assam 141/9 (N. Bordoloi 36, P. Aziz 65 ..; Nadeem 3/20). Jharkhand 143/2 (M. Vardhan 64 .., MS Dhoni 37 ..) Jharkhand won by 8 wkts.

 F1 chief set on buying Arsenal

London: Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone made it clear on Saturday he wants to buy Arsenal, but accepted the Premier League club is currently not for sale. 

Arsenals board has already opposed a widely-mooted takeover by US sports tycoon Stan Kroenke, whose 12.2 per cent shareholding in the club led to the abrupt departure of vice-chairman David Dein in April. 

In an interview to a British newspaper, the 76-year-old billionaire said: The directors at Arsenal dont want to sell and have signed a lockout agreement for a year, so we will have to wait and see what happens then, he was quoted as saying.

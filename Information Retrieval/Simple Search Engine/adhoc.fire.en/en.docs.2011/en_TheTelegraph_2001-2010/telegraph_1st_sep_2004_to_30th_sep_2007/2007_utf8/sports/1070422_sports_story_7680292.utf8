Bridgetown: Brian Lara was run out for 18 in his final appearance for the West Indies as the hosts smashed 300 against Englands hapless bowlers in their last World Cup Super Eight match on Saturday. 

Laras run out came after a mix-up with batting partner Marlon Samuels with the West Indies going strong at 173 for 2. Openers Chris Gayle (79) and Devon Smith (61) provided the ideal start and Samuels atoned for his error to score 51 before the West Indies surrendered their final six wickets for 42 runs. 

Gayle launched a clinical attack on wayward bowling, striking his first six in the fourth over and hitting Jimmy Anderson out of the attack as he scored 50 in just 29 deliveries. After 10 overs the host nation, already eliminated from the World Cup, were 68 for no loss. 

Gayles attack, which included 22 from one Liam Plunkett over, came to an end after he had top-scored with 79 in 53 balls and West Indies had rushed to 131. Gayles knock included six fours and three sixes which delighted a packed Kensington Oval crowd. 

Andrew Flintoff, one of the seven bowlers used by England in the first 11 overs, persuaded Gayle to flash at a ball outside the off stump and pace bowler Stuart Broad, making his World Cup debut, took an impressive diving catch at third man. 

The dismissal brought 37-year-old Lara to the crease for his final international match in emotional scenes. Outgoing bat Gayle hugged him on the boundary as the West Indies pavilion and the crowd rose, chanting, Lara, Lara, Lara. 

The little lefthander, the highest scorer in Test history, walked to the crease through a tunnel of applauding England players and he settled with a quickly taken single. Lara only revealed on Thursday that he was quitting all international cricket after this match. 

With Gayle gone, fellow opener Smith, who had batted slowly and hogged most of the strike, then pushed on and reached his half century in 96 balls before he was dismissed for 61 by what was probably the catch of the World Cup. 

Smith cut Flintoff hard and high. As umpire Rudi Koertzen prepared to signal a four, Paul Collingwood at gully leapt to snatch the ball out of the air one handed. 

Lara had struck three fours and was shifting into top gear when disaster struck and he was run out. Samuels played the ball to mid on and called Lara through for a single, changing his mind when he saw Kevin Pietersen sprinting in. 

Lara was not given enough time and was run out for 18 from 17 balls. Lara walked off, shaking his head at first but then waving his bat as the crowd cheered again. 

At 173 for three West Indies stuttered and soon lost another wicket when Ramnaresh Sarwan edged Plunketts delivery to wicketkeeper Paul Nixon to make the score 181 for four. 

The wicket was undeserved reward for Plunkett, who served up a rich choice of half volleys and leg side wides to the West Indies batsmen. Samuels helped himself, hitting 24 from one over before England captain Michael Vaughan ended the bowlers agony and took him off with figures of one for 71 from 7 overs.

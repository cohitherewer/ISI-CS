 CAB factions wait for Dalmiya verdict

Calcutta: Jagmohan Dalmiya is not anywhere to be seen in the CAB nowadays, but a court verdict in his favour is likely to have a huge impact on the run-up to the elections. 

Having been thrown out of the BCCI and then forced to resign as the CAB president on grounds of misappropriation of money, Dalmiya is currently engaged in a legal battle with the establishment. The high court is expected to announce the judgement on Friday. 

As of now, the B.C. Roy Club House is buzzing over several possibilities, including a mixed panel. The latest twist to the tale has come from Biswarup Dey and Amitava Banerjee, who have said that they are keen to throw their hat in the ring for the posts of joint secretaries. Both are known for their loyalty to the Dalmiya group. 

A group of officials held a meeting late Thursday evening. It has been learnt that they would wait for the verdict on Dalmiya to come out before making the next step. 

Saradindu Pal, one of the current joint secretaries, has already made his stand of not stepping down clear. 

A senior official from this group, however, said they would expect CAB chief Prasun Mukherjee to announce his list without Pal as a candidate. 

A communication in this regard has already been sent to the president, highlighting their likes and dislikes.

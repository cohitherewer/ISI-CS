 Prison uprising during match 

 SHARP SINGLE 

Basseterre: A prison riot near Warner Park passed unnoticed by the bumper crowd that watched Australia beat South Africa in their World Cup match on Saturday. ICC officials were also unaware of the revolt, which was quelled by the St Kitts and Nevis security forces with the help of a task force drawn from across the Caribbean. 

The national security ministry issued a statement on Saturday saying an uprising had erupted in the prison, which is located 400 metres from the stadium, after prisoners fought off warders who wanted to search a cell. The prisoners were eventually subdued and the search of the cell was conducted resulting in a small quantity of marijuana being seized, the statement said. 

Full fitness

Gros Islet: England paceman Simon Jones has stepped up his recovery from a serious knee injury and hopes to be fit for the start of the English County season. The England and Wales Cricket Board website (www.ecb.co.uk) said Jones, who has been out since May, is now bowling from a half run-up after returning from warm-weather training in South Africa. 

Good catch

Basseterre: There is an old cricket saying that catches win matches they can win you pints of beer as well.

Just ask Australian fan, Tony Carlon of Melbourne. He was the man who held a one-handed catch beyond the boundary after Ricky Ponting hit a giant six on Saturday against South Africa in their Group A World Cup thriller. The stroke over wide long-on took Ponting to 10,000 runs in his 266th one-day international innings. I watched from the time he hit it and when I saw it coming down I just thought Id try and grab it, said the 30-year-old electrician. 

There were a few other blokes around but I managed to beat them to it. As he spoke, he was mobbed by his mates who had given him hugs after he held the ball. The moment was beamed live on the international television broadcast. 

Shock death

Ghaziabad: Desperate to catch the action in the India-Sri Lanka match, a man here ended up electrocuting himself while trying to fix his cable TV connection during the game. Shopkeeper Arthula Ravi Kumar was declared brought dead to hospital after getting the electric shock during the match. 

After post-mortem, his body was cremated with his cricket bat.

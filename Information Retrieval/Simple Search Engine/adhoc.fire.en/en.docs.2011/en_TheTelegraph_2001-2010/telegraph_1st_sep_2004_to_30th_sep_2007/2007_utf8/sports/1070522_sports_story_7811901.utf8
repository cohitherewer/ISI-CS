 Harrington wins, Jyoti tied 21st

Adare Manor: A final-hole double bogey cost Jyoti Randhawa a top-10 finish in the Irish Open on Sunday. The Indian ace finished tied 21st after carding a two-over 75 in the final round. 

Randhawa, who was tied 12th after Round III, aggregated six-over 294 for the meet. 

Shiv Kapur returned a 75 to finish tied 69th with a total of 17-over. 

Padraig Harrington ended a 25-year wait for Ireland by winning the sudden-death play-off against Welshman Bradley Dredge. Harrington made par on the first extra hole to beat Dredge after both of them finished five-under 283, four strokes ahead of the field. 

Harringtonmade a few mistakes to card a 71. Dredge carded a 68, equalling the Adare Manor course record. 

Randhawa got off to a good start, gaining a shot on the third hole. But a bogey on the sixth saw him make the turn even-par. 

A par on the last hole would have earned him a tied 11th finish and a birdie would have got him inside the top-10, but all that Randhawa managed was a double bogey.

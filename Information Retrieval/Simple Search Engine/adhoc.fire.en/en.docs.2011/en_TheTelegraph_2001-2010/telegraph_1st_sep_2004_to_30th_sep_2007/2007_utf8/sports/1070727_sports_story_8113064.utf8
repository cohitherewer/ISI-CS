The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I respect Trescothicks decision: Vaughan

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Marcus Trescothick 

Nottingham: England captain Michael Vaughan and his opposite number, Rahul Dravid, have reacted to senior pro Marcus Trescothicks decision to not make himself available for the 2007-08 season as well. 

Vaughan was particularly sympathetic. That shouldnt surprise as The Telegraph learns hes a close buddy of the stressed out Trescothick. 

The following are excerpts from what they said on Thursday: 

VAUGHAN: Its very much an individual decision... I respect it... One can have an opinion, but only he knows what hes going through... Hes probably made the right decision as he can come back when fully ready... Ive heard that he has ambitions to play for England again and, when he does make himself available, Im sure hell get a game... Hes not getting any younger, but one does miss senior players... His experience and seniority would be helpful... 

DRAVID: Im not aware of the circumstances, but he has been a great champion and an asset for England... As a lot of cricket is played, it puts players under pressure... Youve got to devise strategies to counter that... Some years are tough for Indian cricketers, some not so tough... Because we dont know where well be in our summer one July in the West Indies, next in England managing the players is tougher in India... England and Australia dont travel out in their summers...

LINE NOT CROSSED AT LORDS

RAHUL DRAVID: The first Test was played in good spirit... I dont think the line got crossed at any time during the match... You expect a bit of needle in a close game... Its probably good... Tempers can get frayed, but nothing untoward happened.

MICHAEL VAUGHAN: We do play with intensity, but I dont think there ever was anything more than light banter... Dont think (Dinesh) Karthik said anything on the fourth evening... Dont think Sourav (Ganguly) said something (offensive) either...

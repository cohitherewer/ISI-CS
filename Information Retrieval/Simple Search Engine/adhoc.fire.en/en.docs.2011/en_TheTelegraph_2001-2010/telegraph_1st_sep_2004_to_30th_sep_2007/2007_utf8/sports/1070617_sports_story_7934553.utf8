Oakmont: Jeev Milkha Singh perfectly timed his birdie on the 17th hole in second round to make the cut at the 107th US Open at the Oakmont Country Club on Friday. 

Jeev, the Asia No.1, has never missed a cut in his four major appearances three of them in US Open. He shot a second successive five-over 75. 

With a total of 10-over 150, the Indian was at tied 51st right on the cut line as 63 players made the cut. Jeev was 10 shots off leader Angel Cabrera of Argentina. 

Jeev had a much-improved day on Friday when he found eight of the 14 fairways up from five in 14 on first day. But he dropped in terms of finding greens in regulation from 11 out of 18 to nine out of 18. He needed 32 putts as against 34 on first day. 

This is a tough course and I love playing in such courses. This is what majors are all about, said Jeev. (PTI)

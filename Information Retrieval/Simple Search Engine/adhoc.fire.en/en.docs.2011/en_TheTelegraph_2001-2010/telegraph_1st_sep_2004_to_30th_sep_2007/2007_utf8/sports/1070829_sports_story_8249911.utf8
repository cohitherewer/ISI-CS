 Sehwag to cheer Bhaichung amp; Co.

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Football fever seems to have gripped the capital ahead of Wednesdays Nehru Cup final. 

So much so that even star cricketer Virender Sehwag has decided to be present at the Ambedkar Stadium to cheer the national team against the mighty Syrians. 

I am not a huge fan of football, Sehwag confessed. But since India are in the final, I should be there to support Bhaichung and his teammates. 

Sehwag said the prospect of India winning an international football title at home has really excited him. He is confident that India would have the last laugh. 

I am sure India will repeat their last-match performance and win the cup. 

Sehwag is not the only one who is thrilled by the possibility of India winning the trophy. Suddenly there is a huge demand for tickets and a capacity crowd for the final is guaranteed. 

All of a sudden we have become the most sought after people, said a Delhi Soccer Association (DSA) official. Our mobiles have not stopped ringing since Monday. Each caller needs tickets. 

Perhaps for the first time in Delhi, school and college students in different localities are forming small groups to come to the ground with national flags, banners and drums. 

Even MNC bosses have called up the DSA office to enquire about tickets! 

We can expect a sold out Ambedkar Stadium for the first time after the 2005 Santosh Trophy, said DSA secretary NK Bhatia. 

We have already alerted the authorities that there could be a huge commotion during entry. 

The local association, however, wont gain much. While tickets are extremely low priced (Rs. 10 and Rs. 20), thousands of complimentary ones have already been distributed during the start of the tournament. 

The sponsors, ONGC, have decided to increase the prize money for the Man of the Match from $300 to $500. 

All India Football Federation general secretary Alberto Colaco said the entire prize money ($40,000), in case the home team wins, would be distributed among the players. 

There could be some more incentives. That would be announced after the match, Colaco said.

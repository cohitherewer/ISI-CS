 More security after assault incident

Melbourne: Extra security guards were deployed at the Australian Open after a boy was allegedly sexually assaulted in the toilets at the Rod Laver arena, officials said on Friday. 

Victoria state police said the boy was touched inappropriately by a man inside toilets on Monday evening, and detectives from the forces Sexual Offences and Child Abuse Unit were investigating the matter. 

The boys age and other identifying details were kept under wraps. 

Tennis Australia (TA) chief executive Steve Wood said organisers were cooperating fully with the investigators, who had initially asked the incident not to be made public. 

He said extra security staff had been added to patrol the Melbourne Park venue, and all guards had been old to be sensitive to this type of incident. 

We were deeply shocked. We are working extremely closely with the police to support them in every way we can in this investigation, Wood said. (AP)

 Coach defends shooters

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Indian shooters are facing the barrel. On Saturday night, the big Indian contingent that left the shores almost a month ago to participate in back-to-back World Cups in Sydney and Bangkok, returned home without a medal. 

So below par was Indias performance that they even failed to make any new addition to the seven quota places for Beijing Olympics. 

National coach Sunny Thomas, however, denied the charge that the shooters have failed to live up to expectations. 

Samresh Jung, however, seems to have let down the national coach, despite his score of 584 in Bangkok. Thomas felt that Jung is worrying too much about a Beijing quota and that is affecting his performance.

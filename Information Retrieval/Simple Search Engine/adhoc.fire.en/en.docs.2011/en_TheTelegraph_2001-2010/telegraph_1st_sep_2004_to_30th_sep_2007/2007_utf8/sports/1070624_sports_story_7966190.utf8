The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Wimbledon and Maria a great fit

 - The best get ready to fight it out on the hallowed big w turf from tomorrow 

MARK HODGKINSON

Naturally, when Maria Sharapova took the call on her mobile phone to inform her that Wimbledon would be paying equal prize-money to women this summer, she was out shopping. That was probably about the only news which would have dragged her from the boutiques. 

The 20-year-old Russian earns more cash than any other sportswoman on the planet, and so she had not been bothered by the money, just by the principle. It is 123 years since the first womens champion received a silver flower basket valued at 20 guineas, while the mens winner was given a gold prize worth some 10 guineas more. 

But this summer there will be full parity of pay for the first time, headlined by the 700,000 prize for both the mens and the womens champions, and the 2004 winner said this has confirmed Wimbledons status as my centre of tennis. 

It had seemed as though we had been fighting and fighting the whole time for equal pay, and we had been ready to fight for it again this year. But weve got it now, which I heard when I was shopping, so we dont have to fight for it anymore, said Sharapova, the world No. 2 for tennis, but probably the world No. 1 for shopping. Its going to make Wimbledon even more special for me. They are treating us as equals. It has definitely always been a special place for me. For me, it is the centre of tennis, and so Im especially thrilled that we will be earning the same money as the men. Its amazing. Its so exciting. Im so thrilled about it. 

Little wonder. It was Wimbledon that made her. Aged 17, she defeated Serena Williams to lift her first Grand Slam title. I love coming back to Wimbledon, as this is where my career kind of started. But it had always been my favourite Grand Slam, ever since I was a junior. The craziest thing about winning the Wimbledon title was that I never expected it to happen. After each of the early rounds, I was thinking to myself, well, okay, now Im probably supposed to go home. So, after winning the final, it really took a while for me to believe that I had done it, she said. 

When I won my second Grand Slam, at the US Open last year, I truly believed it. I knew that I had been ready to win it, that I was physically and mentally ready to win another Grand Slam. I had worked really hard for it. But when I arrived at Wimbledon in 2004, I just never thought I was ready to do that. Ive watched bits and pieces of that match on video. Every once in a while, I look back at the greatest moments in my career, and everything I have achieved, as that shows me what I am capable of doing. The innocence of 2004 has long since gone. Sharapova has done a lot of growing up since then. 

As well as her campaigning for equal pay at Wimbledon, she became an ambassador for the United Nations this year. 

This season, during a long stretch at home because of a shoulder injury, the America-based player has learned all about doing chores around the home. Im 20 and in a way Im so mature because of what my career has brought me, but in other ways Ive missed out on the normal things of life. 

 But now she is back at her centre 

 of tennis, with her flat-hit shots suited to the Wimbledon 

 grass. Wimbledon is always her best chance of winning a 

 Grand Slam. Wimbledon and Sharapova are a great fit.

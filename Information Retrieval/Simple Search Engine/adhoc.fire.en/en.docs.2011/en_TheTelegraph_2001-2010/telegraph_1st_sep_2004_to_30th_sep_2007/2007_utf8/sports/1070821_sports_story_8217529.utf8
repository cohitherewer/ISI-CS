A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Biswajit Bhattacharya-coached Chirag United Sports Club edged Mohammedan Sporting 2-1 in their CFL Premier Division tie at the Mohammedan Sporting ground on Monday. 

Theodre Sunday put the black-and-whites ahead in the 30th minute and the equaliser came eight minutes later through Nirapada Mondal. Sankar Oraon scored the winner in the 70th minute to log full three points pushing Shabbir Alis side into deep trouble, reeling at four points from five matches. 

Chirag United, who are placed third in the table with eight points from five matches, looked a better side on Monday, though Mohammedan Sporting made some valiant efforts down the middle through Basudeb Mondal. 

Dhanrajan free-kick from the left was received by Theodre Sunday in the 30th minute and the foreigner, deceiving his marker Sheikh Azim by a half-turn slotted the ball to the far post. Eight minutes later, it was Nirapada Mondal, who unleashed a firm right footer to pierce the net. 

And in the 70th minute Sankar Oraon sealed the fate after playing one-two with Theodre before making a clinical finish. 

Bottles, bricks and sleepers were hurled at the Chirag United goal and the bench consisting of coach Bhattacharya and the reserve players. 

Meanwhile, in another match at the Mohun Bagan ground, Calcutta Port Trust got the better of Eastern Railway by a Sujit Dey brace. Dey struck in 12 and 31st minutes.

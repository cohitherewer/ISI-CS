The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 FIVB: India nowhere near Olympics

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: India maybe on song remaining unbeaten so far in the ongoing second Commonwealth Volleyball Championship for men but when it comes to competing at the Olympics level, they are well below par. So feels Mohammad Habib Ali Abdullah, general secretary of the FIVBs rule-change body. 

Abdullah, who is here for the Commonwealth meet, said Indias standard is very low to compete at qualification level. Its very difficult at this level They dont even have a level to prepare for qualification round also, Abdullah said. 

Abdullah also said that the worlds governing body is mooting few simplifications in the rules so that the sport becomes more appealing. 

Among the rule changes under consideration is two liberos instead of one on the court. We want to increase the defence so that it wont be totally one-sided but there would be longer rallies. However, its at a testing stage, he said.

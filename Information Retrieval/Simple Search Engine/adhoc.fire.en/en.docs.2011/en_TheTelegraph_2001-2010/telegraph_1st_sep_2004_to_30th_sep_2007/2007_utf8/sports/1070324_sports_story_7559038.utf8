A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The AFC Cup win over Pahang in Malaysia may be a thing of the past, but Mohun Bagan coach Chima Okerie is drawing confidence from that show and looks for a new start in the ONGC Cup National Football League when they face Churchill Brothers Saturday. 

No doubt, its a tough match, but we are confident to make a new start tomorrow, Chima said after Fridays practice. 

Mohun Bagan will miss Sushil Singh, released for a two-week holidays. Bhaichung Bhutia is likely to start with PC Lalawmpuia up front in a 3-5-2 formation.

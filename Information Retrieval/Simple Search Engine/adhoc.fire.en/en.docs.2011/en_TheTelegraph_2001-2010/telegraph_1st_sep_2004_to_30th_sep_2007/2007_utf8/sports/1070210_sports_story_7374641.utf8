Pebble Beach (US): Masters champion Phil Mickelson rolled in a downhill, 18-foot eagle putt on his final hole to vault into a three-way tie for the lead at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am on Thursday. 

The world No. 6 completed a seven-under-par 65 at Poppy Hills Golf Club, one of three venues being used this week, to join fellow Americans John Mallinger and Nick Watney at the top of the first-round leaderboard. 

Tour rookie Mallinger, taking advantage of calm morning conditions, produced a blemish-free display at the hosting Pebble Beach Golf Links, while Watney birdied two of his last four holes at Poppy Hills. 

World No. 2 Jim Furyk was two strokes off the pace in a share of fourth after recovering from an erratic start to shoot an eight-birdie 67 at Spyglass Hill Golf Club. 

American Furyk picked up five shots after the turn to finish level with compatriot Jason Schultz, who also played at Spyglass Hill, and Indias Arjun Atwal, after opening at Pebble Beach. 

Atwal grabbed the first opportunity that came his way to make an excellent beginning to his 2007 season with a five-under 67. He showed good form to nail six birdies, including five on the trot. 

Atwal, who missed his card after finishing outside top-125 last season, has also suffered because of some injuries. This season he has limited starts on the Tour and will get to play around 16 or 17 events. 

Of the other big names, two-time champion Davis Love III carded a 70 at Poppy Hills, three-time major winner Vijai Singh a 73 at Spyglass Hill and Irish world No. 9 Padraig Harrington a 74, also at Poppy Hills. 

Swede of Indian descent, Daniel Chopra, shot a one-under 71 at Poppy Hills, and was tied 41st. (Agencies)

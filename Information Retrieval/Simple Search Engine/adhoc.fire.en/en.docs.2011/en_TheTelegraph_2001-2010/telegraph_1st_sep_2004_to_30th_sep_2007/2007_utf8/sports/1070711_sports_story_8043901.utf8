The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tarak Das best among U-19s

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Tarak Das has been adjudged the best under-19 district cricketer for the 2006-07 season. The Murshidabad boy had got the award for the under-17 category last year. The under-17 trophy this time will go to Basant Ranga of Purulia. 

The CAB annual awards function will be held at the Town Hall on July 22. 

The districts sub-committee, which met on Tuesday evening, decided to introduce an under-15 event from next season. Inter-district competitions have so long been held in three categories: seniors, under-19 and under-17. 

It was also decided to convert grounds at eight districts, which still use mat wickets, to turf pitches.

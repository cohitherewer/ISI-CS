 Real close in on Sevilla 

Madrid: Real Madrid ended a turbulent week with a morale-boosting 1-0 home win over Real Zaragoza to move within two points of leaders Sevilla in the Primera Liga on Sunday. 

Talk of rejuvenating the squad, David Beckhams decision to leave at the end of the season and coach Fabio Capellos decision to discard him dominated the build-up to the match. 

But a relatively young side rose to the occasion by putting in a spirited performance, with Dutchman Ruud van Nistelrooy scoring the only goal just before the break. 

There was an air of expectation at the Bernabeu as Reals new youngsters Fernando Gago and Gonzalo Higuain took centrestage. 

Dropped from the squad by Capello, Beckham could be seen watching from the stands while among the injured absentees were Ronaldo, Antonio Cassano and Roberto Carlos. Defenders Michel Salgado and Sergio Ramos were suspended but none of them seemed to be missed as Real dominated from the start. 

Real are third on 35 points, level with second-placed Barcelona who were thumped 1-3 at city rivals Espanyol on Saturday but have a game in hand. Leaders Sevilla lost their 100 per cent home record, and the chance to extend their lead at the top, when they lost 1-2 to struggling Real Mallorca. 

Meanwhile, AS Roma lost ground on Serie A leaders Inter Milan when they conceded a late penalty to draw 1-1 at Messina on Sunday. (Reuters)

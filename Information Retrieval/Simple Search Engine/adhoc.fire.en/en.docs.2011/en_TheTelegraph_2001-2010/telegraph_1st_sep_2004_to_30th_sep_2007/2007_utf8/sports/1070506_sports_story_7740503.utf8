The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The mantle of greatness almost fits Cristiano

GRAHAM TAYLOR 

 Cristiano Ronaldo 

What a change of fortune there has been for Manchester Uniteds Cristiano Ronaldo. Derided and abused throughout most of the season for his part in the sending off of clubmate Wayne Rooney during the England-Portugal game at last summers World Cup, he ends up by being voted the Football Writers Association Player of the Year. 

Having already won the same title, as well as the Young Player of the Year, at the Professional Footballers Association Awards, it has been some season for the Portuguese player. And rightly so. This young man has the qualities to become one of the greats of the game. 

Judged by his performance on Wednesday against AC Milan he has some way to go to achieve that, and to support his manager Sir Alex Fergusons opinion that he is the best player in the world. 

That should come in time, provided Ronaldo continues to listen and learn and thereby gain experience. The really great players earn that tag by having a positive effect in big games. That was not the case against Milan, where the experienced Italians put Ronaldo in his place. 

But his awards are for his performances in this country, and Ronaldos exciting and entertaining displays made him a comfortable winner. 

The number of goals he has scored and the amount he has created show there has been more of an end product to his play. If he improves in this department the word great will slip more easily around his name. 

Although the Premiership has more than its fair share of foreign players, it cannot be easy for them to adapt to a new culture, on and off the pitch, especially for a teenager, which is what Ronaldo was when joining United. 

A different language, different food, different weather, different living conditions with no family around you and, most importantly, a different style of football. That is difficult enough for mature foreign players, but for a youngster it can become impossible. 

Having recently signed a new five-year contract, will we, in this country, see Ronaldo take the next step to greatness? To do that, United will have to continue in the same vein as this season, which means being involved in winning at least the Premiership and/or the Champions League. And he has to perform at international level. 

You do not need to be an expert when watching Ronaldo play at his best to realise that he has got the lot skill, technique, physique, pace, power, dribbling, shooting and heading ability. But to be called the best player in the world you have got to play against the best teams in the world and deliver. That has yet to come. 

Will he ever rid himself of being accused of being a diver? I think he has made a tremendous improvement this season. If Ronaldo can cut this out, many supporters will applaud him for it and appreciate even more fully the wonderful talent he has. 

Next season, I hope to see him perform at his best in the Champions League away games. That is where he and his teammates have fallen short, and to be called great he, and they, have to put that right.

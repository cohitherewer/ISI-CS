 Gambhirsatisfied

Belfast: Gautam Gambhir believes improving on his consistency will help him cement a place in the Indian team. 

At this level its all about being consistent and thats what I was lacking in the past its very important for me, said the Delhi batsman who hit an unbeaten 80 to guide India to a nine-wicket win against Ireland on Saturday. 

The left-hander shared an unbroken century partnership with Sourav Ganguly who made a solid 75 not out as India comfortably overhauled the revised target of 171. 

It will be a long tour so its important to start off well. Its nice to start well and Im pleased I got the runs, said Gambhir who was also named the Man-of-the-Match. (PTI)

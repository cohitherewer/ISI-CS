 PCB names reserves

Karachi: The national selection committee of Pakistan has shortlisted five reserves to meet any eventuality in the original World Cup squad. 

The selection committee has also decided not to take chances on unfit pacer Shabbir Ahmed, who returned to international action last month after serving a 12-month ban for having an illegal bowling action and was sent back from South Africa with a groin strain after bowling just two overs. 

Other players on the list are wicketkeeper Zulqarnain Haider, opener Salman Butt (who has not played since last year) and allrounder Azhar Mahmood. (PTI)

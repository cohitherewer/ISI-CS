 Another setback for Anand

Wijk Aan Zee: Top seed Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria defeated Viswanathan Anand comprehensibly to give another jolt to the Indians hope of bagging a sixth Corus chess tournament title here. 

With his second loss inside three days in the prestigious Group A, Anand remained on four points from eight games. 

It was simply a disastrous outing for Anand as he blundered in the early middle game against Topalov. The ace Indian now has a daunting task in the remaining five games as he will have to score heavily. 

Topalov, meanwhile, shot into sole lead as overnight leader Teimour Radjabov of Ukraine finally found his nemesis in World Cup winner Levon Aronian of Armenia. The Bulgarian nudged half-a-point ahead of Radjabov who remained on 5.5 points. 

Sharing the third spot now on 5 points are Russians Vladimir Kramnik and Peter Svidler, Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine and Aronian. Anand is now in joint seventh spot on four points along with David Navara of Czech Republic. 

It was a double blow for India as worlds youngest GM Parimarjan Negi also suffered a loss at the hands of local favourite IM Manuel Bosboom in a Group C game. Playing white, Negi fell under time pressure and was slowly outdone. 

IM Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia (7.5 points) continued his demolition act and downed local IM and tail-ender Thomas Willemze in quick time. 

Nepomniachtchi took his tally to an astounding 7.5 points out of a possible 8 and remained on 1.5 points ahead of his nearest rival Emanuel Berg of Sweden.Negi is in joint sixth spot, with four points. 

In other decisive games of this round, Peter Svidler outwitted compatriot Alexander Motylev, while Sergey Karjakin scored over Navara.

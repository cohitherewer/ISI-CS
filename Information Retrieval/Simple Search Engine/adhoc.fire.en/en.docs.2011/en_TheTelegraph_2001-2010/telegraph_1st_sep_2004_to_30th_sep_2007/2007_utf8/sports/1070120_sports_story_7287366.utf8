 Sher-e-Jalandhar look in good shape

New Delhi: Three weeks into the tournament, the Premier Hockey League is interestingly poised with three teams locked in a close contest for a berth in the final. 

Though these are early days, Sher-e-Jalandhar must be drawing huge inspiration from the fact that they are leading the tally with 10 points from four matches. 

All seven teams have played four matches each and after a break of five days, action will resume next week. 

For defending champion Bangalore Lions and new entrants Orissa Steelers tied on eight points apiece the break would provide an opportunity to prepare a strategy for toppling the Jalandhar outfit. 

The start was not a smooth one for the Jalandhars, who started with a narrow 1-0 win over state rivals Chandigarh Dynamos and lost their next match to Maratha Warriors 0-1. 

However, star striker Gagan Ajit Singh struck form at the right time to put Jalandhars back on track. The Punjab Police forward hit three spectacular goals as his team thumped the Bangalore Lions 7-1. 

On Thursday, Jalandhar ended the undefeated run of Orissa Steelers 2-1 to strengthen their stake.

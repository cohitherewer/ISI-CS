The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Nowadays, theres more quantity and less quality

 - A captain has to be transparent with the decision making: Mahela 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Chennai: Mahela Jayawardene isnt just a superb batsman and imaginative leader, hes a very fine speaker. That came through during an Asian Cricket Council-organised seminar on Friday, where he gave a captains perspective. Oh, no... I didnt really prepare... Making speeches isnt my forte, he told The Telegraph. 

Jayawardene, of course, was being modest. In fact, according to the Pakistan Cricket Board chairman, Dr Nasim Ashraf, the Asia and Sri Lanka captain could become a much-in-demand management guru once hes through with cricket. 

The following are excerpts from Jayawardenes presentation: 

On captaincy 

I love challenges and, when I got the job, we werent where we are today... One has to be transparent with the decision making and thats something I can control... I dont get into things I cant (control)... In the subcontinental environment, especially, its important to be transparent... Right or wrong, a captain has to take decisions... There are reasons behind every decision and theyve got to be communicated... As Ive said, one must be transparent... That apart, one should set goals... Before our last tour of England, for example, the senior group got together and did that... Its important to involve others... Its the team which does the job for the captain, but he gets highlighted... When the team fails, he gets the axe. 

On the qualities a captain must have 

He needs to be a good communicator and a good listener... Im open to ideas... One can even pick up something while out shopping... One may not like to respond to that idea straightaway, but one will have something to think about... 

On teammates 

Certain guidelines have to be followed by all, but there are players whove got to be treated differently but within those guidelines... I mean, the rules have to be followed by everybody... Look at (Muttiah Muralidharan) Murali... Hes a character by himself... Telling him what to do is impossible, for he knows that himself... So, Ive got to build myself around him... Thats man management... If Lasith Malinga gets a two-week break, hes going to return with a new hairstyle or with different ear studs! Thats fine as long as he gives one hundred per cent on the field... Our fast bowlers have tattoos... Given the colour of our skin, you cant make them out, yet they have it... Its their style and, as captain, Ive got to help them grow... So, man management skills do come into play. 

On handling pressure 

Its best to be transparent... That way, the media wont be after you... 

On Sri Lankas last coach, Tom Moody 

He challenged us to get better... Challenged us to keep improving... Taught us to play like Sri Lankans with that extra something... He didnt try to change us, but made us mentally tougher... Its important to have a coach who complements the team... One needs him to act as the third eye. 

On domestic cricket in Sri Lanka 

Schools cricket is our strength... We encourage our young cricketers to be as natural as possible... 

On whether administrators should be former players 

It will help... The communication between the players and administrators could then become better... (After a pause) Nowadays, theres more quantity and less quality... We could, one day, have a situation where the public and the sponsors begin to ask whether were having quality or just playing (for the sake of playing)... We could run into such a wall... 

On the Twenty20 format 

Its a good vehicle to promote the sport in areas where development is needed, but we mustnt rush into it... Cricket is about developing skills... Because of Twenty20, spinners could go out of the game... Most of us on the ICCs Cricket Committee recently agreed that the Twenty20 World Cup (in September) had come too soon... Ive only played two Twenty20 Internationals and doubt if the selectors are going to pick me! 

On the cricket-specific development programmes 

Youve got to be patient... You shouldnt get on to the speed-train in a hurry... If you do, theres the risk of quickly falling off. 

Finally, on the future 

I take things year by year but, yes, when I do call it a day I would love to give something back to cricket.

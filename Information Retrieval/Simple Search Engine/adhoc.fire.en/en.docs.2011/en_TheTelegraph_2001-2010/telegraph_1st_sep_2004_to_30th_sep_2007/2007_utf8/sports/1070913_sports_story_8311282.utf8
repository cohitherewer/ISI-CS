 Mhambrey banks on Mahesh, Tiwary

 Manoj Tiwary 

New Delhi: India A coach Paras Mhambrey said he has two potent pacers in V. Yo Mahesh and Pankaj Singh who can make up for the absence of Irfan Pathan when the four-day match against South Africa A starts at the Kotla Thursday. 

After routing both Kenya and Zimbabwe in the recent twin tours, the Mohammed Kaif-led Indian side is high on confidence and though Pathan left the squad to join the Twenty20 team in South Africa, Mhambrey asserted the pace attack would not lack in firepower. 

Both Pankaj and Yo Mahesh have done well on the tours. So even though Pathan would not be there, I think they can take care of the load, Mhambrey told reporters at the Kotla. 

Lanky Delhi pacer Ishant Sharma is also part of the squad. Mhambrey said the team has been bolstered with the inclusion of Suresh Raina and Manoj Tiwary, who have returned from injuries to join the squad. 

They have recovered well. I have seen them fielding and spoken to the physio as well. It seems they are fully fit. 

Manoj had a great season last year and it was his shoulder injury that cost him his Team India debut. He seems in perfect shape now, said Mhambrey, who was Tiwarys coach in the Bengal Ranji team.

 Twenty20 practice is Uthappas secret 

London: Robin Uthappas special twenty20 cricket training did the tricks for India at the Oval on Wednesday. The dashing batsman revealed, after his match-winning knock in the sixth ODI, that the innovative shots he had been practising for the ICC World Twenty20 came in handy during the thrilling chase. 

I have been practising different shots for the ICC World Twenty20, and they came out perfectly today, said Uthappa after Indias two-wicket win with two balls to spare. 

India needed 83 off the last 10 overs when Uthappa, a regular opener, joined Mahendra Singh Dhoni at the crease. 

Uthappa went on to put on 60 runs from just 46 balls with Dhoni and, despite three wickets falling in the last two overs, kept his cool to hit two successive boundaries in the final over to guide India home. 

Most of the 21-year-olds runs were scored behind the stumps, through scoops over fine leg and other unorthodox shots. 

The fine leg was up, so I knew they were going to bowl mainly yorkers. So I decided that I was either going to hit straight down the ground or take it on the full and hit it over fine leg, Uthappa said. (PTI)

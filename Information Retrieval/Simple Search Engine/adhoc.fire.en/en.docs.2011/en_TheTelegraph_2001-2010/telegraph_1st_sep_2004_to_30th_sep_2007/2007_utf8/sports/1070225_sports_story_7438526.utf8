 Adam Gilchrist boosted by timely delivery

Sydney: Australia vice-captain Adam Gilchrist will be available for his teams first World Cup warm-up match in the West Indies after the birth of his third child. 

Gilchrist was in danger of missing Australias first practice match against Zimbabwe on March 6 after being given permission to stay at home and be present for the birth. 

Cricket Australia said in a statement on Saturday that Gilchrists wife had given birth to a son, Archie, on Friday. 

The statement said Gilchrist would not fly to the Caribbean with the rest of the squad on Wednesday but would join in time for the first warm-up game, against Scotland, on March 14. 

As planned, Adam will spend a few days with his family before travelling to the World Cup and will not depart with the main squad, the statement said.

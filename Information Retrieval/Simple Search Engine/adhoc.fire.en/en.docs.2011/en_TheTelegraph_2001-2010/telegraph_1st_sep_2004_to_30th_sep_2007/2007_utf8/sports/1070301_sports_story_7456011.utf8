 Quake hits Antigua, Trinidad

Kingston: Antigua and Trinidad, two countries that will host World Cup matches, were jolted by an earthquake early on Wednesday morning. 

An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.1 on the open-ended Richter scale hit St Johns just before 6 am local time. 

Almost around that time, Port-of-Spain was also rattled by a quake with a magnitude of 4.3. 

Disaster officials said there were no reports of injuries or damage. 

Trinidad is where India will play their first-round group B matches against Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Bermuda, preceded by warm-up games. 

Antigua are scheduled to stage Super Eight matches at the new Sir Vivian Richards Stadium.

 Germany take 2-1 lead

Moscow: Alexander Waske and Philipp Petzschner beat Dmitry Tursunov and Mikhail Youzhny 6-3, 3-6, 7-6, 7-6 in the doubles to put Germany 2-1 up on holders Russia in their Davis Cup semi-final on Saturday. 

The Germans had to overcome an elbow injury to Waske in the fourth set before prevailing in just under three hours. 

I thought the match was over, said Waske, who was forced to pair up with Cup debutant Petzschner after regular doubles partner Michael Kohlmann suffered a knee injury. I felt something just snapped in my elbow. 

In another semi-final in Gothenburg, twins Mike and Bob Bryan produced a scintillating doubles display to hand the United States a 2-1 lead over Sweden. 

The world No. 1 doubles duo survived a tough challenge in the first set before easing to a 7-6, 6-2, 6-3 win over the unaccustomed pairing of Jonas Bjorkman and Simon Aspelin. 

Meanwhile, in a World Group playoff in Prague, Roger Federer suffered a rare defeat when Radek Stepanek and Tomas Berdych won the doubles to give the Czech Republic a 2-1 lead over Switzerland. 

World No. 1 Federer and Yves Allegro squandered a match point in the third set and eventually succumbed to a 3-6, 5-7, 7-6, 6-4, 6-4 defeat. (AP)

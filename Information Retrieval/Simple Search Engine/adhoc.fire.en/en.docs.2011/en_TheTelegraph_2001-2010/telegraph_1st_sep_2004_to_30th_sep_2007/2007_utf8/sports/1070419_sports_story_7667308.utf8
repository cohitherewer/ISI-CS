 Strauss strengthens captaincy claim

Mark Nicholas in Bridgetown

Briefly, for 30 balls of Englands ill-fated day, the captain and his would-be successor were together at the crease. Keen to bat first on a temperamental pitch, Michael Vaughan had his wish though, oddly, not his chosen opening partner. He had to wait for the arrival of Andrew Strauss wait and watch the agonising lack of progress made by Ian Bell, a progress that matched his own painful inertia. 

When the South Africans put Bell out of his misery, it was a relief to us all. At the other end, Vaughan was taking 20 balls to make his first run, so you can sense the frustration. Vaughan and Bell doesnt work chalk and chalk and Vaughan has to play, or had, we should now say, because he is the captain. 

At least Strauss is left-handed, which Shaun Pollock does not much like. In fact much of Englands indifference can be identified by the way the opening pair approached Pollock, for the best sides have targeted the metronomic accuracy that comes at a greatly reduced pace these days. The Australians went to town on it. England simply played each ball on its merit, which means the scorers notched dot after dot. After five overs, England had five runs. Later in the day, South Africa had 44 at the same point. 

At the arrival of the leftie, Pollock immediately lost his line and Strauss turned him neatly off his toes for a couple. The captain then took toll of Charl Langeveldts first short ball by thrashing it to the mid-wicket boundary and then clipping sweetly off his hip for four more. This was better for the grim-faced men in red, white and blue. 

Then Graeme Smith called up his joker, Andre Nel. In place of the measured Pollock we had mad Nel, with his confrontations and animations and crazy expectation. His third ball thumped into Vaughans pads and was followed by an appeal. After an interminable delay, Steve Bucknor ruled in his favour. The King was gone, long live the King. 

Strauss hooked for six and cut for four; he drove gun-barrel straight down the ground at last, as he did during his glorious first summer as an England batsman when he feared so little and achieved so much. With calm authority, Vaughans natural successor scored at a rate befitting a one-day international cricketer. His dismissal was the saddest of the motley lot. He was one doing himself justice. 

Let us deal with this captaincy thing. Palpably, a man not making runs cannot be in the team. There were exceptional reasons for Vaughans inclusion in the World Cup party, the best of them being Andrew Flintoffs inability to lead the side with conviction, or to get the best from himself while doing so, and Strauss loss of form with the bat. 

Unfathomably, Strauss was overlooked for the leadership of a team that desperately needed his intelligence in Australia. This remains one of the great U-turns for the inside track has it that the selectors were split and Duncan Fletcher was given the cast. Fletcher was a Strauss man. Under Strauss, England had beaten Pakistan in the Test series last summer and drawn the one-day matches. The choice of Flintoff for Australia was the catalyst for the uncertainty we see now. 

Hate saying this, as one does: unless Vaughan scores a heap of runs for Yorkshire in the next month, Strauss must be given the captaincy of England and be done with it. So much nonsense is talked about the coach, who should be no more than a peripheral figure at the captains side. When England were on heat through 2004 and 2005, no one was bothered about the coach for he was busy coaching. All eyes were on the captain, who was bloody good. 

England have coped with the Ashes success of 2005 remarkably badly. This is mainly because Vaughans exceptional skills were lost to a chronic knee injury. Blame the medics if you like, blame anyone, but you wont be any good without leadership. 

Not that the England batsmen should be excused for their ineptitude against Andrew Halls gently paced in-swingers and off-cutters. Lets face it, for the facts are before our eyes, England are not much good right now and were this the football team a culling would be imminent.

 Ronaldo joins Milan

Milan: Ronaldo joined AC Milan from Real Madrid on Tuesday. The 30-year-old will stay at Milan until 2008 the same length as the remainder of his contract at Madrid, the Italian team said. 

The clubs reportedly agreed to a euro 7.5 million ($ 9.73 million) transfer fee. Milan striker Ricardo Oliveira will reportedly move to Madrid on loan as part of the deal. 

Ronaldo has arrived at the Bernabeu to sign the cancellation of his contract with Madrid. 

He agreed to personal terms with Milan and on Friday passed a medical test in the Italian city, where he spent five years with Inter Milan. 

Ronaldo has said his difficulties with coach Fabio Capello have forced him to look elsewhere. He joined Madrid in 2002, winning the Spanish League in his first season, but no major trophies since. 

He came close to joining Milan last August but the clubs failed to reach an agreement. Milan offered euro 22 million ($28.5 million) but Madrid also wanted an option on Milan midfielder Kaka. 

Milan signed 26-year-old Oliveira to a five-year contract from Real Betis on the last day of the summer transfer window, following the original failed Ronaldo bid. (AP)

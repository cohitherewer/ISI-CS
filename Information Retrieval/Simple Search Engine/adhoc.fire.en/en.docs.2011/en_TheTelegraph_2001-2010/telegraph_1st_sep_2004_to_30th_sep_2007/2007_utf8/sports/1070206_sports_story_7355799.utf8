The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Wont give easy runs this time, says Sreesanth

Kochi: Sreesanth has just two matches against Sri Lanka to tide over his poor form before Indias World Cup squad is finalised, but the aggressive Kerala seamer says he has now learnt the art of stopping the runs on flat pitches. 

Sreesanth admits that he was not up to the mark in the home series against the West Indies, and sees his selection for the first two matches against Sri Lanka as a great opportunity to secure a place in the 15-member World Cup squad. 

It was a learning curve for me. I had bowled quite a few wide-balls. I wont commit such mistakes again. Ill stop the runs and put in my very best against the Sri Lankans in the coming matches, Sreesanth said on Monday. 

Sreesanth played in only two games against the West Indies and had figures of one for 79 at Nagpur and one for 67 at Chennai. 

It is a great opportunity that I have been selected for the first two matches against Sri Lanka. I will work hard and see to it that I do not give away easy runs this time. I am still a learner. I wont take things for granted, he said. 

I am not giving any excuse for my performance. I did not lose my rhythm. It was an experience. It can happen to any cricketer. 

I am not unduly worried about criticism. I focus on my game and will put in my best, he said. 

Sreesanth, who has claimed 37 wickets in 8 Tests and 31 in 24 ODIs, feels its important to focus on the next match rather than look too far ahead. 

At the moment, I am just mentally preparing for the next match.

 SHARP SINGLES 

Unicefs turn to shun Freddie

London: His heartfelt apologies notwithstanding,

 Andrew Flintoffs drunken night out at the World Cup forced Unicef to drop the allrounder from a charity visit to school children in St Lucia as his presence may have caused discomfort to

 the kids.

According to a report in a newspaper, Unicef felt Flintoffs actions had led to intense media focus on him, which would have made the kids uncomfortable during the England players visit. 

The 2005 Ashes hero was scheduled to meet the children as an England role model but the furore that he created by being out in the sea drunk after the World Cup loss to New Zealand made the organisation replace him with Ravi Bopara for the visit. 

We took the decision that in the best interests of the children the media interest in Andrew Flintoff was too great for him to visit, Unicef spokeswoman Lara Schlotterbeck said. However, the organisation made it clear that it was keen to work with the allrounder in future charity initiatives. 

Australians are chokers

 Melbourne: Former South African spinner Pat Symcox has said the chokers tag had shifted to Australian side from Graeme Smiths men who face-off in their World Cup Group D league match on Saturday. The chokers tag applies to many teams against Australia, but one wonders if that tag is not attached to Ricky Pontings team, Symcox said. If you looked at how Australia performed against England and then again in New Zealand, maybe that tag has been shifted from South Africa, he said.

Vengsarkars visit

 New Delhi: Selection committee chairman Dilip Vengsarkar will leave for the West Indies if Team India beat Sri Lanka in Port of Spain on Friday and manage to make the Super Eights stage. BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said on Thursday: Mr Vengsarkar will join the Indian team in the West Indies. But he will go only after the Indian team qualifies for the Super Eight.

Bracewells wish

 Gros Islet: New Zealand coach John Bracewell wants England to qualify for the Super Eights at the World Cup. Purely for selfish reasons. Theres no doubt that the more upsets that happen in other pools will assist us, he said Wednesday. Wed love to take England through because that makes everyone elses job a little bit harder.Only Kenya can also advance, but New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming thinks thats unlikely. Id be surprised, Fleming said. But hey, Ive been surprised by a few results here already.

Dont call em minnows

 Port of Spain: Commentators have been told by ICC commercial rights holders Global Cricket Corp (GCC) not to question the worth of weaker nations playing in the World Cup by calling them minnows. 

GCC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Newscorp and the commercial rights for the World Cup, is said to be unhappy with television commentators, who have been denigrating the whipping boys of international cricket and describing them as minnows. 

However, commentators can take the liberty of describing the matches between heavyweights and smaller nations as a mismatch. But to say that some of the nations do not deserve to be in the tournament will not be taken very kindly, according to a report in an Australian newspaper.

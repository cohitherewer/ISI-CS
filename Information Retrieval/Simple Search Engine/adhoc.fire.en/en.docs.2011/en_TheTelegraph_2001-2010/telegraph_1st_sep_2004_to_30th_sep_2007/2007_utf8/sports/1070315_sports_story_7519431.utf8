 SHARP SINGLES 

Exploit Indias weak bowling: Aminul 

 Port of Spain: Bangladesh sought to put up a bold

 face ahead of their opening World Cup encounter against India with a former

 captain saying the minnows were capable enough to out-bat the former champions,

 who had a weak bowling attack.

Our batting will be the key against India. Bangladesh must take advantage of a slightly weak Indian bowling attack. If we can upset either India or Sri Lanka, we can progress to the second round, said Aminul Islam, Bangladeshs first Test captain. 

Aminul, though, does not forget the issues which can dog the Bangladeshis in the showpiece event. 

We do not have enough allrounders, a must in one-day cricket, and look more like a Test outfit. 

Our bowling is also weak as both spinners are left-arm tweakers, he said, while expressing doubts over Mashrafees fitness.

Sachin joins Beckham 

 Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar has joined a list of more than 30 international sports icons including the likes of David Beckham, Lionel Messi and Yelena Isinbayeva in a global campaign which will tell their Impossible is Nothing stories, using their own hand-drawn illustrations and paintings. Sports performance brand Adidas has launched the evolution of its brand philosophy and hopes that the campaign that will encourage everyone to take their first step in reaching the impossible.

Oram rues bad joke

 Gros Islet: Jacob Oram rues the day he joked about cutting off his finger so he could play in the World Cup. 

The New Zealand allrounder made the off-the-cuff remark about amputating his broken left ring finger before leaving for the Caribbean. It has embarrassed him ever since. 

It was completely a joke, Oram said after New Zealand trained in Gros Islet on Tuesday. I said it on TV in New Zealand back home before we left and I thought the smile from ear-to-ear would have shown that I was joking, but unfortunately, people took it seriously, he said.

Players stay away 

 Gros Islet: England and New Zealand skipped an official welcoming ceremony from St. Lucian officials. 

However the Kenya and Canada teams made it to the reception at the exclusive Sandals resort in Gros Islet on Monday night despite the plane containing all four teams arriving one-one and a half hours late from Jamaica.

Near miss

 Gros Islet: St Lucians nearly missed out on watching the World Cup. Local TV network needed a last-minute funding bailout from the government and local businesses to help pay for the broadcast rights. St Lucia hosts eight matches in the group stage, involving England, New Zealand, Canada and Kenya, but theyll only be telecast locally if theyre sold out. All other matches will be broadcast. There are around 45,000 TV sets in St Lucia.

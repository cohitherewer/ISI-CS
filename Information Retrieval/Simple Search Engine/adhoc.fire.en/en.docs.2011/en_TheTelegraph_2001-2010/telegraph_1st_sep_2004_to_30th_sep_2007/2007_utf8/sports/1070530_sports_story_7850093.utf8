The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dav lone candidate to approach us: Shah

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Dav Whatmore 

Darjeeling: With D-Day (or rather C-Day) getting closer by the hour, Board secretary Niranjan Shah has confirmed that Australian Dav Whatmore is the only one to have expressed his keenness for the Team India coachs job. 

Whatmore, who has coached Sri Lanka (twice) and Bangladesh, did so during the recent rain-marred Chittagong Test. 

Nobody else has come to us... Not even informally... However, nothing will happen before June 4, Shah

 told The Telegraph on Tuesday evening. 

[Around the same time, though, Madanlal who was the coach for almost a year in 1996-97 before being replaced by Aunshuman Gaekwad announced that he was keen, but wouldnt approach the Board.] 

June 4, of course, is when the seven-member special committee with president Sharad Pawar in the chair meets in Bangalore to select Greg Chappells full-time successor. 

Shah is himself on the committee, as are former captains Srinivas Venkatraghavan, Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri. The remaining members are Board joint-secretary Mohinder Pandove and treasurer N. Srinivasan. 

According to Shah, the next coachs appointment would be for one year with the contract having provision for a two-year extension. 

Right now, thats the thinking, he said.

 Red Devils sign 9-yr-old wonder kid 

London: Manchester United have signed a gifted nine-year-old after his grandfather sent the Premier League champions a DVD showcasing the boys talents which has become a YouTube sensation. 

Rhain Davis, who was born in England but has lived in Australia since the age of four, was hailed by the British press on Thursday as the next Wayne Rooney after the United striker. 

The boys dribbling and goalscoring prowess for an under-10 side in Brisbane feature in a four-minute YouTube clip, already viewed more than 800,000 times. 

United confirmed the signing but played down the hype around Davis, who has moved back to Cheshire in northern England with his father, near the clubs training ground. 

Hes a member of our academy and we dont comment on individual members, a United spokesman said. 

He added that the club sign about 40 players of Daviss age every year and, as is standard, will decide annually whether to renew his contract or release him. 

What was so unusual in Daviss case was that his skills were brought to the attention of Uniteds youth scouts by the DVD submission, which could inspire other hopefuls, the spokesman said. Were bracing ourselves for a whole series of DVDs, he added.

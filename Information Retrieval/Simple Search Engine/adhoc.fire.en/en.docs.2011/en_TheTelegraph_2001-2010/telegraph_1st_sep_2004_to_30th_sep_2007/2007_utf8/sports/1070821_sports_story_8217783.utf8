The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We are searching 

 for the right formula: Gooch

 - The captain, who took England to the 1992 Cup final, on 

 the ODIs which begin today 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 

 Graham Gooch

 Mumbai: The general belief 

 is that Englands task will be cut out when the seven-match 

 ODI series against India gets underway on Tuesday. Former 

 captain Graham Gooch, who spoke to The Telegraph 

 on Monday morning, agreed.

 The following are excerpts

 On the forthcoming 

 ODIs

 Its a big series for England 

 as we havent been playing well in the ODIs Were 

 searching for the right formula and weve been doing 

 so for a long time Weve got to get the right balance 

 That Marcus Trescothick isnt available is disappointing, 

 for were missing an aggressive opener Except Kevin 

 Pietersen, we dont have somebody in the top-four who 

 is capable of getting a hundred We dont have somebody 

 to really capitalise on the power plays The Indians, on 

 the other hand, have many with that capability.

 On the right 

 formula

 Somebody has to get a hundred 

 in the top-order and somebody has to break partnerships. 

 Of course, it cant be one-off.

 On whether Andrew 

 Flintoff could be made to open

 Thats a possibility Flintoff 

 is quite like (Sir Ian) Botham in that hes not best 

 suited for the middle-order where you need to work the ball 

 around for singles and be quick on your feet Alastair Cook 

 would be one of my openers, with either Flintoff or Matt 

 Prior being the other Its tempting to think of Pietersen, 

 but hes our best player (After a pause) But, 

 then, Sachin Tendulkar opens for India and Mark Waugh used 

 to for Australia

 On whether one of 

 the opening slots is Englands main worry

 An equally big worry is that we 

 lack wicket-taking bowlers Bowlers who can strike in the 

 middle overs Today, batsmen have less fear and are more 

 aggressive, so merely having tight line-and-length bowling 

 wont do.

 On whether the Test 

 series result (1-0 in Indias favour) is going to have 

 any bearing

 Not massively, only to the extent 

 that the momentum (on the tour) is with India Obviously, 

 its nice to win. I expect Sachin and Sourav Ganguly 

 to open Theirs is such a wonderfully successful combination 

 Then theres Rahul Dravid, Yuvraj Singh, (Mahendra 

 Singh) Dhoni In fact, I also liked the way Gautam Gambhir 

 and Robin Uthappa batted versus Scotland the other day 

 Among bowlers, Zaheer Khan and (Rudra Pratap) Singh are 

 bound to swing the ball dangerously Im not sure how 

 the specialist spinners (Ramesh Powar and Piyush Chawla) 

 will be utilised

 On India starting 

 favourites

 Definitely, but because of the 

 nature of one-day cricket, I wouldnt say by too much.

 On whether rankings 

 count the Indians are placed fifth, with England at No.8 

 (above Bangladesh, Ireland, Zimbabwe and Kenya)

 Well, if you dont win enough, 

 you wont have a high ranking However, I dont 

 think the rankings matter much.

 On England having 

 lost (1-2) to the West Indies in their last ODI series

 As Ive said, the search 

 for the right formula continues

 On whether he agrees 

 with another former captain, Nasser Hussain, that Englands 

 cricketers lack the flair necessary for ODIs

 To a degree, yes Pietersen has 

 flair, Ravi Bopara has flair Among bowlers, theres 

 somebody like James Andersen Its not that we dont 

 have talent The biggest problem, perhaps, is that we dont 

 have wicket-taking bowlers As the batters are attacking 

 a lot more, one needs bowlers whore capable of breaking 

 partnerships.

 On Paul Collingwood, 

 Englands one-day captain

 Hes led in one series (against 

 the West Indies) We must give him time to settle down 

 Its still early days for him. If I may add, hes 

 up against an experienced captain.

 On whether Test captain 

 Michael Vaughan shouldve been selected

 No Michaels one-day career 

 is over He had ample opportunities (86 matches), but couldnt 

 register even one hundred (best of 90 not out, average 27.15)

 On the little-known 

 Dimitri Mascarenhas of Hampshire

 Hes an allrounder, is a 

 medium-pacer With Flintoff back and Bopara in the squad, 

 I dont see him playing straightaway.

 Finally, on the Indians 

 Collingwood and Co. need to fear the most

 (Laughs) Starts at the 

 very top Sachin, Sourav

 Two long months of playing the fool 

Mark Nicholas

 Adam Gilchrist after completing his century in the final 

The World Cup finished much as it began, in disarray. From the very real tragedy of Bob Woolmers death to the superficial one of a final played out in pitch black to a full house that could no longer identify the players, never mind understand the revised rules, cricket has appeared as a fool too often to be funny. 

Someone, somewhere, must be accountable, but wont be. The International Cricket Council is not a federation governing the game; they are a holding company who facilitate the egos of each member nation. In time, there will be a meeting, some platitudes, even a promise about the future, but the truth is that everyone is in it for themselves, not for the greater good. 

One day this will come home to roost, for cricket is on a collision course with a world that offers myriad simpler options. For the moment, we are left to celebrate one exceptional team while reflecting on the incompetence that surrounds them. 

The Australians gave the tournament the last drop of themselves and thus received the most back. Not once were they taken to their limit by the opposition. So instead they pushed their own boundaries, improving almost daily to the point at which they exposed the South Africans, who occupied the top spot in the world rankings, as impostors. 

Only Sri Lanka had the gumption to look Ricky Pontings team in the eye and run their race. That they came second was no disgrace. A good fist was made of a daunting Cup-final target in conditions that turned on them, most particularly when the umpires took the players off in the 25th over because of the drizzle. At this point there was rhythm to the batting and the suggestion that Mahela Jayawardene had the measure of the Australian attack, but when the players returned, the theatre of the absurd kicked in. 

Nobody, not umpires on the field or off it, not the Match Referee, nor the players and spectators, commentators or officials had a clue about the revised target. Two overs were deducted but no mention was made of the runs required. Jayawardene pulled away after a ball or two, disgusted by the confusion. How could he pursue a figure that was not there? Could he, or any of us, believe this was the World Cup final? 

Suddenly, painfully, it had become the final that the ICC deserved: ill-conceived and ill-fated. Through the wet morning there was sympathy to be heard could the Barbados weather really scupper the game it so reveres? But now sympathy was overrun by ridicule. 

Eventually, Jayawardene was given the information he needed but so diverted was he that he missed a ball from Shane Watson that was missing leg stump. Steve Bucknor missed that too and upheld the lbw appeal. Game over. 

By taking the players off, the umpires had extracted any last semblance of soul from the tournament. Here was chance to throw the letter of the law aside and apply common sense. Had the show gone on, with the players slipping and sliding, the darkness descending, the run-rate fluctuating and the crowd riveted, we would have forgiven a deal of what had gone before. 

Enough! To Adam Gilchrist we must turn, the man Richie Benaud calls the cleanest striker of a cricket ball he has seen. 

On Saturday, Gilchrist took 72 balls for his first World Cup hundred, just six balls outside the World Cup record set by Matthew Hayden a month ago. From the Ashes to the World Cup final, it is clear Gilchrist is not fazed by the grand occasion. His batting is the material of dreams rarely realised, of fantasies that few sportsmen get to live out. 

From the buccaneering spirit of Gilchrist to the extraordinary disciplines applied by Glenn McGrath, Australia prove that cricket in any format is a game for all people, all styles, all temperaments. McGraths farewell robs us of a patience and subtlety not often seen among fast men. He made batsmen play his game rather than their own by examining minds and breaking hearts. 

It took seven weeks to find out Australia are the greatest one-day team on the planet. Actually, we already knew. The ICCs coup de grace was that its president Percy Sonn made a winding speech and then presented Ponting with the trophy. Sir Gary was on that podium too for goodness sake, ready and willing but not asked. Really, enough said.

 Korea third 

Palembang (Indonesia): South Korea overcame fierce rivals Japan 6-5 in a penalty shootout after a 0-0 stalemate after extra time to win a tempestuous third-place playoff at the Asian Cup on Saturday. 

Goalkeeper Lee Woon-jae blocked Japans sixth spot-kick from Naotake Hanyu to give the 2002 World Cup semi-finalists a spot in the 2011 Asian Cup finals after extra time had failed to break a goalless stalemate between the two countries which co-hosted the 2002 World Cup. 

South Korea had been reduced to 10 men when Kang Min-soo was dismissed for a second yellow card after 57 minutes. 

South Koreas Dutch coach Pim Verbeek and two of his assistants were quickly ordered to follow Kang down the tunnel for protesting furiously at the referees decision. 

Japans bid for a third successive title ended in a 3-2 defeat by Saudi Arabia in the semi-finals while South Korea were knocked out by Iraq on penalties. Iraq and Saudi Arabia will clash on Sunday. 

Fifa president Sepp Blatter flew into Jakarta on Saturday to attend the final. (Agencies)

Calcutta: Lalchand Rajput feels the Test series victory in England will have a positive bearing on the side in the ICC World Twenty20 meet. Winning always helps. It breeds confidence. This momentum will help, Rajput, newly appointed cricket manager for the inaugural meet in South Africa, told The Telegraph from Mumbai. 

The former India opener will be in the city on Thursday to conduct a Level II coaching course. 

Rajput hasnt been surprised by the appointment. The lack of experience among Indians at the games newest version shouldnt be a problem either, he felt. 

We have not played enough of Twenty20 but at the same time Indians are quick learners A lot of these guys have played Twenty20 during their stints with various counties in England. We have good strikers and the right set of youngsters to face the demand of the game, he explained. 

The cricket manager also has plans in place. Twenty20 is a fast-paced game and needs young legs. Youve got to be involved with every ball and the focus and intensity would be of great importance. There will be lot of stress on running between the wickets. Weve got to be innovative in our approach and take quick decisions. 

Will the absence of Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid prove to be a huge obstacle? 

Theres no doubt that we will miss them. They are proven matchwinners. But weve got to look at it in a positive way. It will mean an opportunity for juniors. I have had a good rapport with youngsters in my various coaching roles so that would help me blend easily with this side. 

Rajput is looking forward to working with Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who will lead the side in South Africa. 

He has matured a lot. We witnessed that during the Test series. He is shrewd tactically and has a very good work ethic He is strong-willed and prefers to lead by example. Having been with the Sachins and Dravids must have also helped him 

The cricket manager is keen on having a conditioning camp before their departure.

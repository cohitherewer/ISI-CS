 Uniteds game back on track

Kuala Lumpur: Malaysian football authorities on Monday reversed a decision to cancel the Kuala Lumpur leg of Manchester Uniteds Asian tour in July. 

The decision followed intervention from Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who gave his support to the match which was called off last week. 

The Malaysian federation faces the wrath of AFC president Mohammed bin Hammam and his Fifa counterpart Sepp Blatter, who have led efforts to have the July 27 match dumped as it clashes with the Asian Cup finals which will be co-hosted by Malaysia. (AFP)

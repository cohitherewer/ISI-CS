 Academy role for Chappell after Wright says no

Melbourne: Cricket Australia (CA) has roped in former Team India coach Greg Chappell as consultant for its Centre of Excellence in Brisbane. 

Chappell, along with former Australian pace bowler Bruce Reid, will work part-time in the academy, according to an Australian newspaper. 

Chappells Team India predecessor, John Wright was CAs first choice to fill the void, created after Tim Nielsen had left the head coachs job to succeed John Buchanan in the national side. But the New Zealander turned down the offer saying he wanted to spend time with his kids. 

Incidentally, Reid was also Indias bowling coach during their tour of Australia in 2003. 

Wright said the CA offer was tempting but he was not ready to relocate his family and hence withdrew from the race. 

It didnt quite work out. I havent been back in New Zealand for long, and I was away for four-and-a-half years. Ive got teenage kids (aged 15 and 13). Its just not the right time, he was quoted as saying by a New Zealand news agency. 

Wright, however, admitted he was impressed by the academy. 

It has an enormously impressive facility. Ive always been a great admirer of Australian cricket and the way they do things. Theyre a great example for others, he said. 

Wright, who describes himself as between jobs, did not rule out a role with New Zealand Cricket in the future. Who knows? I wouldnt rule anything out, he said. (Agencies)

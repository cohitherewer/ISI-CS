 Misbah should have taken less risk: Imran

New Delhi: Former Pakistan captain Imran Khan felt that Misbah-ul Haq should have played a more orthodox shot in the last over of the high voltage ICC World Twenty20 final against India on Monday. 

Instead of trying to scoop the ball he should have attempted an orthodox shot and minimised the risk, said Imran, who led Pakistan to a World Cup title victory in 1992. 

Imran also could not understand Pakistan team managements decision to send the in-form Misbah at the number six slot. It is hard to understand why he was sent down the order. He should have come up the order and played more overs, Imran said. (PTI)

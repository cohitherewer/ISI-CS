 Jeev confident of hitting form

Doha: Jeev Milkha Singh leads a strong Indian challenge at the Commercial Bank Qatar Masters, a co-sanctioned event between the Asian and European Tours. 

As Jeev, Jyoti Randhawa and Shiv Kapur came in from Abu Dhabi, four other Indians Rahil Gangjee, SSP Chowrasia, Amandeep Johl and Gaurav Ghei flew in from Karachi, where they played the Pakistan Open last week. 

At the Abu Dhabi Open last week, Jeev missed the cut by a shot in his first outing of the year but he is confident of regaining his form in Doha. 

I think it was too long a break! said Jeev of his year-end holiday. I took four weeks off and didnt practise much at all. 

Gangjee is also looking to a good start on the European Tour, on which he has taken up an affiliate membership. 

I am happy with the way the year has started. I did have some problems in the last round (four bogeys in a row) but the top-10 finish was satisfying, said Gangjee. (PTI)

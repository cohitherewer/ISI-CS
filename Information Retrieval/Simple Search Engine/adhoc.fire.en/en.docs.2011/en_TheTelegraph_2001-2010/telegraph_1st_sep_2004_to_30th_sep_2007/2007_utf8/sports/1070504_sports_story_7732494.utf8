 Woolmer case

Kingston: Police are trying to identify dozens of people captured by security cameras at the hotel where Pakistan cricket coach Bob Woolmer was murdered, the lead investigator said on Wednesday. 

About 80 unidentified people were filmed on Woolmers floor during the days he and his team stayed at Kingstons Jamaica Pegasus Hotel, Deputy Police Commissioner Mark Shields said. Woolmer was found strangled in his room on March 18, a day after his Pakistan squad was upset by Ireland in the World Cup. 

The (closed-circuit TV) work has been completed and were now looking at individuals on those tapes whom weve yet to identify, said Shields, a former Scotland Yard detective heading the probe into the murder. He did not say how many people police have identified so far. 

Police were interviewing witnesses but did not intend to release the images, he said. 

Shields said he was confident Woolmers killing will be solved even though police have yet to announce any breakthroughs more than six weeks into the probe.

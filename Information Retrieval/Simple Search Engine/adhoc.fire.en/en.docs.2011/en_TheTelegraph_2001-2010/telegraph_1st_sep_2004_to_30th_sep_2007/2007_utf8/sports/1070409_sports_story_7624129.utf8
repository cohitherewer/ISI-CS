 Tewari to lead in national meet

Calcutta: Bengals highest scorer in the Ranji Trophy, Manoj Tewari, will lead a 14-member Bengal squad for the National Twenty20 meet to be held in Ahmedabad and Mumbai in tandem from April 15. 

Tewari, busy playing for his employer CESC in Chandigarh, has already led Bengal in the zonal Twenty20 meet, after Deep Dasgupta had an injury problem in the first two matches. 

Manoj has led well here as well as in the under-22 and under-19 levels and we see him as the next captain so to groom him as a captain we have decided on the move, chief selector Arup Bhattacharya said. Wicketkeeper batsman Subhajit Paul has been axed from the squad figured in the zonal leg. 

Former Team India captain Sourav Gangulys participation in the national leg of the Twenty20 meet appears uncertain as he has asked for a couple of days time to decide on the matter. But sources in CAB said unless there is an instruction from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), he may not play this meet. 

Bengal will play their first match against the South Zone champions on April 15 followed by their matches versus North Zone runners-up (April 16), Central Zone runners-up (April 17) and West Zone winners (April 19). 

THE SQUAD 

Manoj Tewari (captain), Deep Dasgupta, Rohan Gavaskar, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Sourashish Lahiri, Subhamoy Das, Shib Shankar Paul, Ranadeb Bose, Avishek Jhunjhunwala, Wriddhiman Saha, Sourav Sarkar, Priyankar Mukherjee, Rana Chowdhury, Kamal Hasan Mondal. Standbye: Anustup Majumdar.

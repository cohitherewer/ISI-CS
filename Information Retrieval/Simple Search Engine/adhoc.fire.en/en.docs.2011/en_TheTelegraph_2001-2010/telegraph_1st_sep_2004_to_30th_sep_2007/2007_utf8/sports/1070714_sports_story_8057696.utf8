Kandy: Sri Lankas Kumar Sangakkara hit a second successive double century as he combined with captain Mahela Jayawardene to tear apart the Bangladesh attack in the final Test here on Friday. 

Sangakkara followed his 200 not out in the second Test with an unbeaten 222, while Jayawardene made 165 as Sri Lanka piled up 500 for four in their first innings by stumps on the third day at the Asgiriya Stadium. 

The hosts, having shot Bangladesh out for 131 on Thursday, lead by 369 runs and look certain to declare at the start of the fourth day to seek another big win for a 3-0 sweep. 

Sri Lanka, who notched up innings wins in both the first two Tests, celebrated a rain-free day with a run feast after frustrating interruptions on the previous two days restricted play to only 57.3 overs. 

Jayawardene and his deputy Sangakkara added a record 311 for the third wicket, Sri Lankas best partnership against Bangladesh for any wicket. 

The two, who came together in the first session at 74 for two, surpassed the 280 by Thilan Samaraweera and Tillekeratne Dilshan against Bangladesh in 2005. 

Left-handed Sangakkara reached his sixth double century and 14th three-figure knock by smashing Bangladesh captain Mohammed Ashraful to the mid-wicket fence for his 26th boundary shortly before stumps. 

Jayawardene, who made 127 in the first Test, survived a confident leg-before appeal on zero, went on to record his 18th Test century that was studded with 15 fours and three sixes. The third six, a spectacular cut over point off fast bowler Shahadat Hossain, brought up Jayawardenes 150. 

Jayawardene and Sangakkara punished the wayward Bangladesh bowling in a spectacular display of aggressive batting that fetched 155 runs in the two-hour afternoon session. (AFP)

 Vernon showed a lot of character, says Kallis

Belfast: South African skipper Jacques Kallis was all praise for his young side for eking out a tough four-wicket win over India in the first match of the Future Cup ODI cricket series on Tuesday. 

Kallis himself led the way for his team scoring 91 not out off 116-balls and sharing an unbeaten seventh wicket stand of 55 with debutant allrounder Vernon Philander. 

We came in very cold and for the guys to play the type of cricket they did was very impressive, said MoM Kallis. 

It was nice to get some runs and wickets again to carry on the form from the World Cup and hopefully that will continue for the rest of the week. 

Kallis acknowledged that India had put up a decent score on board and that it were his openers A.B. de Villiers and Man van Wyk who set up the game for his side. 

I thought it was a competitive score then once we got a good start that set the base for us, he said. 

The key here is getting through the new ball, the openers played pretty well then we just needed someone to bat through and guys to bat around him to get close to them. 

Vernon did extremely well to finish it off. To come in and perform the way he has shows big character. Hes done it back home in domestic cricket, finishing off a lot of games for the Cape Cobras and today he did it at the highest level. 

Hell gain a lot of confidence and hes setting himself some high standards to maintain, Kallis said. 

He also felt that the Indian spinners bowled well in the middle overs when South Africa lost wickets at regular intervals. 

It was the nature of the wicket, it just got slower and slower as the innings went on. We tried to do the same thing towards the back end of our innings but certainly the spinners did come into play and bowled pretty well to put the pressure on us.

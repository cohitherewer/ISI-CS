 Indians to go all out

New Delhi: On Monday, Bob Houghton criticised Indias football infrastructure and stressed on the need for better facilities for the progress of the national team. 

The national coach was all smiles when he arrived in Bangkok on Tuesday morning on the eve of the pre-Olympic tie between India and Thailand. The lush green pitch at the Rajmangalam National Stadium has impressed him so much that he has asked his boys for an attacking football against the hosts on Wednesday. 

We are one short here, said manager Shanto Mitra from Bangkok. Midfielder Bhola Prasad, who was to join the team along with Houghton, has missed his flight from Mumbai, Mitra said. 

Losing all their earlier matches in the group league, India are already out of contention for a place in the next round. The players, however, are determined to give their best and make an impression on Houghton. 

India have a busy international schedule ahead, said skipper Rahim Nabi. All of us want to consolidate our position in the team. 

Houghtons arrival has come as a morale booster for us. We will try to win this match, the striker added. 

The coach has told the boys to be careful at the initial stage. In the home tie at Chennai, India conceded a third minute goal against Thailand to lose the match.

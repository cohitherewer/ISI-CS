 Push to bring back Pak rebels

Karachi: A standing committee on sports has instructed Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to bring back all four Test players, who are reported to join the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL). 

The committee, which met in Islamabad on Thursday, told the PCB chairman Dr Naseem Ashraf that it was an embarrassment for the board management failing to prevent former captain Inzamam-ul Haq, Mohammed Yousuf, Abdul Razzaq and Imran Farhat from joining the ICL. 

Rai Azizullah, the chairman of the standing committee, said it was a big loss to Pakistan cricket that the four players had decided to join the ICL. 

I would ask the board to make every efforts to bring back these players for Pakistan cricket, Rai told Ashraf. Ashraf however, has assured him of talking to Yousuf and Farhat and convince them to drop their ICL contracts. 

Meanwhile, Farhat, who was sent a legal notice by the PCB for signing up for the ICL, while still under contract with the board, has responded with a letter from his lawyer. 

But while explaining a committee members inquiry about why did the board issue a legal notice to Farhat, if it wants the players back, Ashraf said that the opener had violated the central contract and made some serious allegations against board officials and selectors.

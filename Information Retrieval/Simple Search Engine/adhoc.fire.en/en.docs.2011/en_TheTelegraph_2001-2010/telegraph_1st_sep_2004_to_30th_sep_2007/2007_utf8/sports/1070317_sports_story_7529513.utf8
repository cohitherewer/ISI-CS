Kingston: Pakistan are considering playing wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal as an opener for Saturdays World Cup Group D match against Ireland, coach Bob Woolmer said. 

Pakistan are willing to experiment with their batting line-up after Imran Nazir and Mohammed Hafeez flopped as openers in Tuesdays 54-run defeat by the West Indies, scoring six and 11 respectively. 

Although Woolmer said it was not fair to judge form after one match, he admitted that other options were being considered to lengthen the batting order. 

Maybe Imran Nazir will continue to open, maybe Kamran Akmal could open and Hafeez will drop down, Woolmer told reporters. When (Shahid) Afridi comes back maybe he will open. 

We have to try and mix and match the team so we have eight batsmen and six bowlers. The point is if you play Kamran in that position we need to fit in one other opener. 

We have a few different combinations to consider, which we will discuss before the Ireland match. 

With allrounder Afridi forced to sit out one more match after being handed a four-game ICC ban, and the injured Abdul Razzaq missing, Woolmer admitted the teams resources were being stretched. 

This is where someone like Razzaq would be good but we cant deal with things we havent got, Woolmer said. Im sure Shahid would also be useful to us but he cannot play until the Zimbabwe game (on March 21). 

So we have to deal with the team we have. We are very fluid but most of all we have to make sure that we get our strategies right on the field. 

Captain Inzamam-ul Haq echoed the same feeling. We are missing them (Razzaq and Afridi), Inzamam said. 

He conceded that his team had played badly against the hosts and the batting was a big let down. 

But I can assure you we will now pick ourselves up for the remaining two games of this first round and look to qualify for the Super Eight stage. 

The captain, who is already feeling the pressure of the huge expectations of a nation passionate about their cricket, also said fast bowler Mohammed Sami might come in for the out of form Rana Naved-ul Hasan. 

They may have considered the Irish pushovers, but the ICC associate side showed great fighting qualities to tie their opening match with Zimbabwe on Thursday. 

Our game against Ireland will be a tough one as they showed that they are one of the best equipped of the associate sides and are very keen and well organised, said Woolmer. 

Pakistans practice session on Thursday was marred when assistant coach Mushtaq Ahmed, a World Cup winner in 1992, was struck by a ball on his nose, which caused a minor fracture and needed two stitches. He confirmed the injury will not stop him from his job in the Caribbean. Saturday being the St Patricks Day, Trent Johnston and his side may find it a perfect platform to cause another upset. 

If we bowl well up front against Pakistan, and if we bat well, we could be competitive, Johnson said. 

We will get out there and give it everything that weve got. If were going to beat Pakistan well have to play out of our skins, and give it 120 per cent. 

We have to play for 100 overs if were going to beat Pakistan and do the same against the West Indies. We will have to bring our A-game to all three disciplines, the Irish captain added.

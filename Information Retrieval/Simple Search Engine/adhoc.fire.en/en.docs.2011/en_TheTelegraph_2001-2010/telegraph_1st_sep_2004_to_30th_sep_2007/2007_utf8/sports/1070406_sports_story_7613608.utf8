London: AS Roma earned a 2-1 win over 10-man Manchester United on Wednesday in the first leg of the Champions League quarter finals, and Valencia held hosts Chelsea to a 1-1 draw. 

Roma got goals from Rodrigo Taddei and Mirko Vucinic at Stadio Olimpico, where Man United fans fought briefly with police after the first goal. Didier Drogba scored the equaliser for Chelsea. 

Taddei scored from inside the area in the 44th minute, sending a low shot from 12 metres (yards) past goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar after a deflection off Man United defender Wes Brown. 

After the goal, opposing fans taunted each other by banging on the partition separating the sections. One fan was seen lying with blood covering his face as police hit fans with night sticks to restore order. There was also violence before the match, with several United fans injured in clashes outside the stadium. 

Wayne Rooney equalised for United in the 60th, chesting down a cross from Ole Gunnar Solksjaer and easily shooting past Roma goalkeeper Alexander Doni. The goal was Rooneys first in the Champions League since he scored three in his debut against Fenerbahce in September 2004. 

But Vucinic put Roma ahead again in the 66th, putting in a rebound after Mancinis hard shot was stopped by Van der Sar. 

United played with 10 men after midfielder Paul Scholes received his second yellow card in the 34th for taking down Totti. In the 26th, the former England international brought down Christian Wilhelmsson. 

Drogba, who scored his 30th goal of the season, equalised for Chelsea with a header in the 53rd minute after a long, looping pass from Ashley Cole. 

David Silva gave Valencia the lead, taking a throw in on the left and dribbling toward the middle before unleashing a hard, 25-metre shot that left Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech no chance. (AP)

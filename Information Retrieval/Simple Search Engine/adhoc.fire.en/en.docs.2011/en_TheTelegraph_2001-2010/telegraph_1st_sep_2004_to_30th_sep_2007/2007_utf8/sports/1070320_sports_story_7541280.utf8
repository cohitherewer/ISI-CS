 SA will be ruthless vs Scots

 Graeme Smith in Basseterre 

Basseterre: Top-ranked South Africa would want to be as ruthless as possible against minnows Scotland before taking on bitter rivals Australia in their crunch World Cup test. 

We are focused on our match against Scotland, because this is the match to play for now, said South African captain Graeme Smith of his teams group A clash at Warner Park on Tuesday. 

Smiths men know their real challenge will come on March 24 against defending champions Australia whom they displaced as world no. 1 last month. Smith believed his teams emphatic 221-run win over The Netherlands in their first group match last week had given the players a much-needed work out. The batsmen have had good workouts and the bowlers bowled a few so I am happy with the preparations, said Smith, whose team had a poor build-up to the tournament. 

They struggled to beat debutants Ireland and went down by seven wickets to Pakistan in their warm-up matches in Trinidad, where the facilities and a tricky pitch came under criticism. But against The Netherlands in their group A opener they piled up 353 for three with Jacques Kallis hitting an unbeaten 128, while Herschelle Gibbs wrote his name in history books by slamming six sixes in an over for the first time in one-day cricket during his 40-ball 72. We know Scotland are a slightly better side so we need to improve. We have analysed some video footage of them, said Smith whose side has never played Scotland in ODI. 

Smith has, however, played alongside Scotlands acting captain Ryan Watson during his school days back home. 

 Scotlands Australian-born coach Peter Drinnen said his team relishes the challenge of playing the no. 1 team in the world. We are excited by the challenge and both Australia and South Africa in our group provide us with two real challenges, said Drinnen.

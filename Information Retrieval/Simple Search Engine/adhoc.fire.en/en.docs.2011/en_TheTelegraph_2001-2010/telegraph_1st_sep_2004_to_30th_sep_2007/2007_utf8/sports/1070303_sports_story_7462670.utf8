 2 footballers killed in Iraq

Baghdad: Gunmen killed two members of the local soccer team during training in Ramadi on Friday, police said. 

One of the victims was a leading member of the Ramadi Football Club, 27-year-old Mohammed Hamid, who was shot dead along with his 23-year-old teammate Mohammed Mishaan. 

Sportsmen, like academics and other professionals, have been targets in Iraqs sectarian violence. Last month Iraqi first division player Ihab Kareem died. (REUTERS)

 Richards, Walsh back West Indies

Port of Spain: West Indies legends Vivian Richards and Courtney Walsh believe the home team has the potential to win the World Cup. 

I have always said we have a very good chance of winning this World Cup. We have assembled a team that is good enough to compete at this level, Richards said. 

There are so many things for them to be motivated. Winning it as a West Indies unit is collectively good for the whole region and I believe we stand a very good chance, Richards was quoted as saying. 

Richards played in the World Cup winning teams in 1975 and 1979 and was the batting hero when the West Indies won the trophy for the second time. 

Walsh, the first man to take 500 wickets in Test cricket, also backed the Windies as the favourite to win the event. 

I am a true supporter of the West Indies team and I think we have picked a young, exciting crop of players who will do us proud. I dont just believe they will do well, I believe they have what it takes to win the World Cup, Walsh said.

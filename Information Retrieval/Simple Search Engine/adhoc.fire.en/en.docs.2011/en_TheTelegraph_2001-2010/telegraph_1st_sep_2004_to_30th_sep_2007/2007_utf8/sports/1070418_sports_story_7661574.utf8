 Lanka pay the price

Simon Briggs in St Georges

Often touted as a possible successor to Duncan Fletcher, Tom Moody has done a magnificent job as Sri Lankas coach. Already acknowledged to be both clear-sighted and sure-footed, he showed Monday that he can be hard-nosed by resting his two senior bowlers, Chaminda Vaas and, most controversially, Muttiah Muralidharan. 

Sri Lankas unwillingness to risk these two key players in a dead match took the edge off what should have been a compelling encounter, and certainly contributed to their seven-wicket defeat. 

Moodys supporters will say that his decision was pragmatic; his detractors will call it cynical. But then this is the stage of the tournament when real politick often takes over. New Zealand set the tone with their field placings against Sri Lanka last week, sacrificing any chance of victory in order to protect their run rate. 

If Moodys strategy helps Sri Lanka to nick the trophy, few neutrals will be complaining. There can be little doubt that Australia are the best and most deserving team. But Muralidharan is one of the few men capable of derailing them, so it made sense to keep him out of sight in a contest that could easily be repeated in the final. 

Of course, most of these Australians have played against Muralidharan enough times to know his repertoire backwards. But he is such an unique bowler, all snapping wrist and bulging eyes, that it must still feel like a shock when you face him for the first time in months. 

The bounce and turn in the Barbados pitch could make yet him a World Cup winner for the second time just so long as Sri Lanka get that far. The last time the Aussies came unstuck in a World Cup was in the 1996 final, when Muralidharan had the most economical figures on show. 

There was little at stake in Mondays match apart from bragging rights. The only thing this result has done is clarify the semi-final line-up slightly: Sri Lanka are now virtually certain to meet New Zealand in Jamaica, leaving either England or South Africa to face the yellow peril of Australia. 

Everyone keeps saying the world champions are due a bad game, but so far they seem to be playing a completely different sport from their rivals. 

It takes skilful and imaginative cricket to worry the Australians, so tight are their disciplines, but for 30 overs in the middle of Sri Lankas innings they actually produced it. Mahela Jayawardene and Chamara Silva built a delightful stand of 140 for the fourth wicket, switching smoothly between blazing pull shots, deft deflections and silky drives. Jayawardene, Sri Lankas charming captain, sometimes seems incapable of playing an ugly shot.

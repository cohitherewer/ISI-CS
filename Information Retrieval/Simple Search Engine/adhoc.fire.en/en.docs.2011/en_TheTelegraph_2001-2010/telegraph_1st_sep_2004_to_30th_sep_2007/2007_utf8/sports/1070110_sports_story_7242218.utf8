 A glaring omission

 - FIFA s World Cup report 

 Zidane's head-butt finds no mention 

London: Maybe Zinedine Zidanes head-butt in the World Cup final never happened after all! 

The unforgettable moment in soccers biggest match came when the France captain, in his final game before retiring, reacted to something Marco Materazzi said by planting his head firmly into the Italians chest. 

Because the ball was further down the field, few among the 69,000 fans in Berlins Olympic Stadium saw the incident and were amazed when Zidane was sent off. 

Fifa, it seems, didnt see it at all. Theres certainly no mention of the incident in soccer bodys official World Cup 2006 technical report. 

Even the outline of the final makes no mention of it. Its not even noted that Zidane was ejected in the final match of his career! 

Even in retirement, Zidane was suspended for three games and fined for the outburst. Before he considers suing Fifa, there may be reasons why governing body didnt include details of the incident in its report. 

Zidanes ejection for an act of blatant violence provided a shameful end to a championship that Fifa had lauded as one of the best ever. Maybe they didnt want it to take the shine off an otherwise glowing report. 

The World Cup was widely acclaimed as well-organised by the hosts Germans, despite pre-champion-ship fears about ticketing and security. There was little crowd trouble inside or outside the stadiums despite the arrival of thousands of drunken fans from England and neighbouring Netherlands. 

As the three-time Fifa Player of the Year walked past the World Cup trophy, the smiles of satisfaction disappeared from the faces of Sepp Blatter and his Fifa colleagues. 

They knew that the 2006 World Cup which has the letters Fifa at the head of its official title would forever be known as the competition where one of the greatest players the game has ever seen ended his career by head-butting an opponent. 

When the official report came out six months later, Blatter, Uefa president Lennart Johansson and local organising committee chairman Frank Beckenbauer all wrote forewords to the document without making reference to Zidanes head butt or even his ejection. 

While rightly praising the organisational skills of the Germans, the report also skipped over some glaring errors by the referees like Englands Graham Poll, who showed three yellow cards to one player before finally ejecting him. (AP)

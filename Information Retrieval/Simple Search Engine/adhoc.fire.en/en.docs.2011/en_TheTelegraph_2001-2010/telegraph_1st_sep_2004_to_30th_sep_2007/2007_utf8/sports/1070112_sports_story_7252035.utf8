New Delhi: Sania Mirzas dream run came to an end after she lost to top seed and world No. 13 Anna Chakvetadze of Russia in the semi-final of the Moorilla International Open in Hobart on Thursday. 

The 20-year-old Indian went down 4-6, 1-6 to her fancied opponent, bringing an end to her fine run in the season-opening WTA event, a lead-up to the Australian Open beginning Monday. 

Sania had a perfect start when she broke Chakvetadze in the very first game of the match. But the Russian player fought back and did not allow Sania to take the advantage and broke Sania in the next game. 

Sania was broken again in the tenth game which cost her the set 4-6. Sania had a chance to take lead in the seventh game when scores were level 3-3, but could not exploit the break-point that came her way. 

In the second set, Chakvetadze did not give any chance to Sania. She set the momentum in her favour and broke Sania twice to take a 5-0 lead. The Russain conceded just one game in the second set to take the set with a scoreline of 6-1. 

It will be an all Russian affair in the title clash on Friday with Chakvetadze taking on qualifier Vasilisa Bardina who thrashed Sybille Bammer of Austria in the first semi-final 6-3, 6-1. (PTI)

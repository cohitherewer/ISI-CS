 McGrath is irreplaceable, says Warne

Melbourne: Shane Warne has described his bowling comrade-in-arms Glenn McGrath as a champion and said Australia will find it difficult to get a suitable replacement. 

In pure bowling terms, Australia might find another like him (McGrath) but there is still a big question mark over that. Its everything else that he has brought to the table and made him the champion he is that has set McGrath apart, Warne wrote in an exclusive newspaper column. 

I dont think Glenn can be replaced. His attitude in key moments and ability to get the best players out consistently over a period of time in all conditions has been unbelievable, he said. (PTI)

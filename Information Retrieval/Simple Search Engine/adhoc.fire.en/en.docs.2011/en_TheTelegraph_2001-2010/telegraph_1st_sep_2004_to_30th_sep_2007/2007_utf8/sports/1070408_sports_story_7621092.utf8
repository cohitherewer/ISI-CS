 Pole for Massa 

Sepang: Ferraris Felipe Massa snatched pole position for the Malaysian Grand Prix with a scorching last lap in Saturdays qualifying. 

The Brazilian, with a time of one minute 35.043 seconds, was almost three-tenths of a second quicker than double world champion Fernando Alonsos McLaren. 

Massas Ferrari teammate Kimi Raikkonen, who won the season-opening race from pole position in Australia, will start in third place on the grid at the Sepang circuit on Sunday alongside McLarens British rookie Lewis Hamilton. 

Obviously tomorrow (Sunday) I want to finish the race in the same position in which I start it, said a satisfied Massa after claiming his fourth career pole position. 

I think at the end of the day, the McLarens were really competitive and it makes us work even harder to have a good race tomorrow. 

In a scintillating final lap of qualifying under dark and threatening skies, Raikkonen and Alonso briefly held pole before Massa seized it from them. 

Spaniard Alonso said he was delighted to claim a place on the front row in his McLaren for the second consecutive race. 

Champions Renault, who have won for the past two years at Sepang with Alonso in 2005 and Italian Giancarlo Fisichella last season, failed to qualify in the top-10. 

Hondas woeful season continued with both the main teams cars again slower than the Honda-backed Super Aguri of Japans Takuma Sato, who qualified 14th. 

Briton Jenson Button, a race winner in Hungary last year, was 15th and Brazilian Rubens Barrichello 19th. 

Barrichello, forced to use the spare car for qualifying and limited to one flying lap, said the team was pushing too hard in the bid to find the right package. (Reuters)

 Confident India gear up for semi-final

Ipoh: A confident India take on hosts Malaysia in the semi-finals of the 16th Sultan Azlan Shah Cup hockey tournament here on Friday. 

In the other semi-final, Olympic champions Australia are scheduled to meet Asian Games gold medallists South Korea. 

India had won a bronze in the last edition of the championship before touching a new low, including the disaster in Asian Games from where they returned empty-handed. 

The win against Argentina on Wednesday, however, has boosted the teams morale but coach Joaquim Carvalho believes his wards have a real challenge to face on Friday. 

Last nights win against Argentina was a huge boost for the team and we will go into the semis against Malaysia with a great deal of confidence and with the hope of giving another strong performance, Carvalho said. 

I will be happy if we play as well against teams like Spain, Holland Germany. That would be a good index to measure the team. After all, one swallow does not make a summer, he remarked. 

It would be a different ball game tomorrow, Caralho continued. It is a semi-final and so the pressure will be more on both teams. As for India, I would say we are very confident. After all, we played well against Australia and were unlucky to lose and then won two pressure games against China (5-4) and Argentina. Meanwhile, Pakistan avenged their Asian Games defeat with a 5-3 verdict via the tie-breaker against China in a 5-8 classification matchon Thursday. 

Fridays fixtures: Semi-Fnals Australia vs South Korea (3.35pm); India vs Malaysia (5.35pm). (PTI)

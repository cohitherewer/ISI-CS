Calcutta: There was a clamour for tickets and passes at close on the second day of the Ranji Trophy Super League match against Rajasthan. Bengal may have dictated the terms with 385 runs on Thursday, but an unbeaten Sourav Ganguly has raised expectations manifold. 

A strokeful 72 off 73 balls with 14 boundaries was all that was needed to confirm his form. This apart, there were centuries from Avishek Jhunjhunwala (115) and Manoj Tewari (152 batting). 

Subhomoy Das also chipped in with a polished 82 during a 201-run stand with Avishek. The hosts are already ahead by 272 runs against an attack that lacked sting and enthusiasm. 

Having ensured a semi-final berth, Bengal are now eyeing five points from this game which will help them top group B. They will bat on the third morning and only think about a declaration after lunch. 

We need to give the bowlers at least 150 overs in hand, Deep Dasgupta said. 

Ajay Jadeja was pragmatic. We batted poorly and there is nothing much you can do in this sort of a wicket. The bowlers just didnt have enough runs to back them But its good in the sense that the youngsters can learn from this experience. How often does a youngster get the opportunity to bowl against Sourav? the former India star tried to find a silver lining. 

Even as Manoj and Deep added 121 runs for the fourth wicket, the nearly 5,000-strong gathering grew restless as Sourav waited for his turn to bat. The second new ball had been taken and Deep was dismissed soon after. The home crowd was ecstatic as Sourav walked in. 

The first ball beat the former India captain outside the off-stump. But then as he settled down, a majestic square cut and a flowing drive followed in the same over from Pankaj Singh. There was no stopping Sourav even though he survived a confident leg before appeal. 

A pull off Pankaj, a square drive off Sumit Khatri, a straight six off Jadeja were to follow in quick succession. He completed his half-century with a single to point. 

Avishek had set the tone in the morning as he added 75 more runs off 111 balls to his overnight score. This was Avisheks third century in Ranji and second this season. 

If Avishek gets a hundred, how can Manoj stay unnoticed? Call it some strange coincidence, they always get their hundreds in tandem. It happened against Mumbai and Manoj looks set for a double hundred. 

Manoj and Sourav have added 143 for the unbroken fifth wicket partnership. Manoj, who survived once early in his innings, never seemed overawed by the presence of Sourav at the other end. None of the rival bowlers posed any problem during his 152 (227 minutes, 173 balls, 20x4, 3x6). 

It will take a huge effort from the visitors to deny Bengal an outright victory from this juncture.

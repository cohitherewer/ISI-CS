 CSA refutes Adrian le Roux charge on alcohol abuse

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Following Adrian le Rouxs accusation on Tuesday that alcohol abuse by some South African cricketers resulted in their poor performance during the World Cup in the West Indies, the countrys cricket board has issued a statement refuting the former fitness trainers charges. 

In my opinion, the use of alcohol within the national team is a problem. This does not include all, but some who play a vital role in the team, Le Roux was quoted as saying in a magazine. 

Drinking alcohol inside the 72-hour period before a match would not allow the body to function in its normal capacity a contributing factor to muscle cramping, he said. 

Captain Graeme Smith and AB de Villiers suffered from crippling cramping during World Cup matches and the team came in for criticism after some of them were seen drowning their sorrows in the early hours following a loss to New Zealand. 

Le Roux, who resigned perhaps because he felt his reputation was at stake, said it was the direct result of the use of alcohol. 

 Some players are simply not mature and responsible enough, he said. 

However, in a statement released later, Cricket South Africa (CSA) CEO Gerald Majola said: CSA refutes media reports that Le Roux resigned as physical trainer because of alcohol abuse among some of the players. 

He stated clearly in his letter of resignation that he was leaving cricket to concentrate on a new career so that he could be with his family in Bloemfontein.

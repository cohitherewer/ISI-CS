The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 He was a giant: Mani

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Boards from across the world mourned the untimely demise of ICC president Percy Sonn. Besides the organisations, individual tributes too poured in after Sonn, aged 57, died in Cape Town on Sunday after developing complications from a colon operation. The following are some of the reactions (in alphabetical order): 

Jagmohan Dalmiya (former ICC president): It is a loss not only for the cricketing fraternity, but also for me since Percy was a dear friend and a worthy colleague. I knew he was unwell. But I thought the true fighter that he was, he would come out of the crisis. I pray to the Almighty to give courage to his family to bear the irreparable loss. 

Ehsan Mani (former ICC president): As a cricket administrator and a man, Percy Sonn was a giant. He was one of the most intelligent men I have ever met. Cricket will be much the poorer for his passing away. In all the circles in which he moved, he commanded a huge amount of respect. That was never more obvious than when he was in an ICC board meeting. 

Sharad Pawar (BCCI president): Percy Sonns untimely death has come as a great shock to all of us in India. On behalf of the BCCI and myself, I extend condolences to Mrs Sonn and his family. 

Malcolm Speed (ICC chief executive): Percy was utterly committed to the game. His mantras were that the game had to be inclusive rather than exclusive and that it had to be played the right way.

 Alemao dies in accident 

Rio de Janeiro: Palmeiras striker Alemao died in a car crash early Sunday, local media reported. 

The 23-year-old player had an accident while driving his Toyota Hilux in the city of Nova Iguacu, about 50kms north-east of Rio de Janeiro. 

Accident details were not immediately available. Alemao, whose full name was Carlos Adriano de Jesus Soares, had been with the four-time Brazilian champion since January, but played only a few matches before sustaining a serious knee injury that would keep him sidelined until the end of the year. 

He also played for Japanese clubs Kyoto Purple Sanga and Yokohama FC last year. 

The striker began his career with Coritiba, moving to Japanese soccer after the 2004 season. (AP)

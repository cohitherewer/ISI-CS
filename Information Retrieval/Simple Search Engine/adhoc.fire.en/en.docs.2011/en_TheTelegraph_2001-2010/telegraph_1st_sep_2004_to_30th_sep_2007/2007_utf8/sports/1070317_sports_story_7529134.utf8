The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Md. Sporting confident versus Air India 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting may be placed at the bottom of the 11th National Football League, but new coach Biswajit Bhattacharya believes his side can turn the tide in their favour. Hes looking at Saturdays match against Air India at the Salt Lake Stadium as the starting point of a change in fortunes. 

But problems do never seem to desert the black-and-white side. Just on the eve of the match, the AIFF has made it mandatory that the dependable defender Habibur Rehman Mondal will have to join the national camp in Goa. 

Habibur will leave tomorrow and so I will miss him as well as two others Subhasish Roy Chowdhury and K. Kulothungan for injuries, Bhattacharya said. 

However, we are confident of making the most of this home match. We may adopt a wait and watch policy, but we are going to take the field on a positive note, he added. 

After Round VIII, the Mumbai outfit is on 11 points while Mohammedan Sporting are on six.

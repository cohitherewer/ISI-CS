 Nabi to lead India 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Syed Rahim Nabi of East Bengal will lead India in the pre-Olympic return match against Thailand, to be played in Bangkok next Wednesday. 

According to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources, Nabi has replaced N.S. Manju, who skippered India in the other pre-Olympic encounters. Manju, who is busy with his examinations in Bangalore, has made himself unavailable for the match. 

Goalkeeper Subrata Pal will also miss the match as he has suffered an eye injury during practice. Also on the injury list are defenders Habibur Rehman and Rakesh Masih. 

Nabi, when contacted in Goa, said he was delighted to get the captaincy. I had led Bengal once in an age group competition and after that, I never got an opportunity to captain any side. Captaining India is a godsend opportunity for me, he said. 

India, who are already out of contention for a berth in the next round, have three points. The points were awarded to India after Thailand were pulled up for fielding an ineligible player in the first leg tie in Chennai.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I think 

 Ill be able to repay their faith

 - East Bengal reception overwhelms Subrata Bhattacharya

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Subrata Bhattacharya 

 Calcutta: They numbered 

 not more than a hundred, but the noise they were making 

 could have represented thousands more.

 Much, much before Subrata Bhattacharya 

 arrived at East Bengals Maidan tent to officially 

 accept the offer to coach the red-and-golds, these die-hard 

 fans had assembled outside the club gate. Every time they 

 saw a car approaching the club, off went a roar: Hip 

 hip hooray, three cheers for Babluda.

 The moment their Babluda 

 reached his new destination, club officials and fans went 

 out of their way to extend a warm welcome. Everyone wanted 

 to shake his hand and the TV cameras wanted a good byte, 

 as he struggled through the pushing and shoving on way to 

 the secretarys room.

 I am quite overwhelmed by 

 the reception I got from the fans here, Bhattacharya 

 told the media after a 40-minute meeting with club officials.

 Having spent nearly 25 years playing 

 for and coaching Mohun Bagan, was it an easy decision accepting 

 East Bengals offer?

 There was so much warmth 

 and feeling in their approach, I couldnt say no. I 

 always want to be associated with the game but didnt 

 have a coaching assignment of late, so I decided to accept 

 this one.

 This isnt the time to either 

 analyse why it had taken him so many years to change colours 

 or think about possible repercussions of this move, said 

 Subrata.

 Now that Ive taken 

 this responsibility, Ill only look ahead and not back 

 East Bengal is my club now The officials and fans have 

 put faith in me and I want to do something for them. I think 

 Ill be able to repay their faith, Bhattacharya 

 said.

 Refusing to term this as his biggest 

 challenge, Bhattacharya said: All challenges are tough. 

 In any case, my coaching career hasnt yet taken off.

 What will his emotions be during 

 the next East Bengal versus Mohun Bagan clash? There 

 cant be any emotions involved here. Id go for 

 a win, like Ive always done. Ill instruct the 

 players accordingly. Thats it.

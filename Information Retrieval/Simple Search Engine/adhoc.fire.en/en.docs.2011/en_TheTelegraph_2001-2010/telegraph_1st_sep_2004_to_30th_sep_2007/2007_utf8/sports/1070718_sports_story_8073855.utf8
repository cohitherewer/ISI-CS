 Yuvraj Singh not out of Lords frame

 - First Test 

 RP looks set to be the third seamer 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Yuvraj Singh 

London: Yuvraj Singh, one learns, isnt

 out of the frame for a place in the XI for the first Test against England. 

According to The Telegraphs sources,

 the more experienced V.V.S. Laxman is ahead in the race for a middle-order

 berth, but Yuvraj isnt short on support. 

Hes in the picture, but Laxmans chances look much better, one of the sources pointed out on Tuesday evening. 

The Test begins on Thursday. 

Apparently, the Indians will employ a 3-1 attack. Rudra Pratap Singh looks set to be the third new-ball bowler, after Zaheer Khan and Sreesanth. Anil Kumble is going to be the lone specialist spinner. 

The XI is likely to be: Wasim Jaffer, Dinesh Karthik, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Laxman/Yuvraj, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Kumble, Zaheer, Sreesanth, RP. 

Meanwhile, ODI specialist Ajit Agarkar was seen sweating it out during the days nets. 

Wife Fatimas folks are here and Id told Rahul Id be available if they wanted me at nets... Theres nothing more to my being present, he said. 

Agarkar, it may be recalled, cracked a hundred during the last India-England Test at Lords in the summer of 2002. It was in a losing cause, though.

London: Roman Abramovich and Jose Mourinhos differences appear to have been patched up for the moment. 

An impromptu hug at the end of the FA Cup semi-final win over Blackburn hinted that the troubled relationship between the Russian owner and Portuguese manager was on the mend. 

A complete reconciliation appeared to be confirmed at the end of last week when Chelseas chief executive, Peter Kenyon, publicly vowed that Mourinho would not be sacked this summer. 

But, as in all domestic disputes, the legacy of past acrimony can be hard to escape. Chelsea may discover that when Liverpool visit Stamford Bridge on Wednesday for the first leg of a re-run of the two clubs tumultuous 2005 Champions League semi-final. 

In the bad old days (read: three months ago), when Roman and Jose were not on speaking terms, the most lavishly-resourced club on the planet somehow neglected to ensure they had adequate cover at centre-back for the remainder of a season in which they remain on track for an unprecedented quadruple. 

Boltons reported asking price of 3 million for Israeli international Talal ben Haim was judged extortionate for a player who will be a free agent come the summer. Mourinho was ordered to get by with the resources already available to him. 

By and large, that has meant regularly deploying Michael Essien as a stop-gap at the heart of the back-four. But with the injured Ricardo Carvalho doubtful for Wednesday after missing Sundays Premiership game against Newcastle and Essien suspended, that option is not open to Mourinho. 

Instead, barring a last-minute recovery by Carvalho, it seems likely that captain John Terry will be accompanied at the heart of defence by the significantly less reassuring figure of Khalid Boulharouz. 

It is not the only thing Mourinho has to worry about. Germany captain Michael Ballack limped out of Sundays goalless draw before half-time and is unlikely to be fully fit. Also, the likes of Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba looked decidedly weary at St James Park. 

Liverpool, in contrast, have in Mourinhos words been on holiday of late with the prospect of an appearance in next months final in Athens their last remaining opportunity to ensure the season ends with some more silverware to adorn the trophy room at Anfield. 

Steve Finnan, the Ireland full-back and one of the veterans of Liverpools extraordinary final triumph in Istanbul two years ago, believes history could be about to repeat itself. 

It does remind me of 2005, Finnan said of Liverpools progress to the last four. Weve knocked out Barcelona and PSV Eindhoven, and did well in the group stage, so we deserve to be here. Its our only chance of silverware this season and the lads are buzzing. 

Luis Garcia ensured Liverpool got on the plane to Istanbul with a hugely controversial second-leg winner at Anfield two years ago. This season the injured Spaniard will be obliged to watch from the stand but he is the only significant absentee from an otherwise full-strength Liverpool squad. 

We knocked them out in the semi-finals in 2005, so theres no reason why we cant do it again, he said. 

More recent history is also on Liverpools side with Rafael Benitezs side having comprehensively outplayed the Londoners when they visited Anfield in January. They had beaten us in the league too many times in recent years, so it was nice to get one over them and beat them at Anfield, said Finnan. We played well on the day and that will give us a lot of confidence for this game. 

The first leg is at their place and that is how we like it. A good result in the first leg will set us up nicely to go back to Anfield.

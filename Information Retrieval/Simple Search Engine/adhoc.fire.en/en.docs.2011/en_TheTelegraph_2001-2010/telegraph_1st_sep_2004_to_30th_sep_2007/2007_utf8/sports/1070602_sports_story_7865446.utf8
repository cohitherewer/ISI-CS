 BCCI meet on June 12

Mumbai: The BCCIs all-powerful working committee is to meet on June 12 to discuss various issues. 

The meeting of the national selection committee, slated for the same day in Bangalore, is likely to be put off by a day because of the clash of dates, according to Shah. 

Among other things, the working committee is expected to ratify the decision taken by the coach selection committee in Bangalore though Shah said the agenda for the meeting has not yet been fixed.

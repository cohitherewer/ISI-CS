 Chopra falters to end tied 8th

Palm Beach: Daniel Chopra blew away his chances at the Honda Classic with four birdies in a six-hole stretch on the front nine, as the battle for the title went into a play-off between four players. 

Chopra, just two behind the leaders, gave himself a great chance with a birdie on third, but bogeys on fourth, sixth, seventh and ninth ended his hopes. Not even two birdies on 13th and 16th could revive them as he slipped to tied eighth from overnight third position. He totalled three-under 277. 

Up ahead, four players tied at five-under 275 after 72 holes. They were Mark Wilson (71), Jose Coceres (66), Boo Weekley (70) and Camilo Villegas (66). They were still tied after the first play-off hole, which they all parred in five. 

Tripp Isenhour (67), Robert Allenby (68) and Steve Stricker (69) tied for fifth at four-under, while Chopra (71) and Brett Wetterich (67) tied for eighth. (PTI)

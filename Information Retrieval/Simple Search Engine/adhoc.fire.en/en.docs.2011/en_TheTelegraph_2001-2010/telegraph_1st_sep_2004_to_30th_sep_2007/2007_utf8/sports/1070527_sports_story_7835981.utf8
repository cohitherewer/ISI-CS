 Alonso cruises to pole in Monte Carlo

Monte Carlo: Two-time Formula One champion Fernando Alonso won the pole position on Saturday for the Monaco Grand Prix ahead of McLaren teammate Lewis Hamilton. 

Alonso completed the 3.34km twisting street circuit in 1:15.726 to win his first pole this season and the 16th of his career but the first since the Chinese GP in October. 

Hamilton was next in 1:15.905. Felipe Massa of Ferrari, who has taken the pole in the last three races, was third in 1:15.967 for Sundays 78-lap race. 

Kimi Raikkonen finished 15th after his Ferrari had suspension problems in the second 15-minute session. 

He brushed the wall and bounced hard over the kerb as he exited the Swimming Pool complex. He stopped on the next-to-last turn and struggled to get back to the pits. 

Massa nearly hit him coming around the turn, but avoided a crash by slowing past Raikkonen. (AP)

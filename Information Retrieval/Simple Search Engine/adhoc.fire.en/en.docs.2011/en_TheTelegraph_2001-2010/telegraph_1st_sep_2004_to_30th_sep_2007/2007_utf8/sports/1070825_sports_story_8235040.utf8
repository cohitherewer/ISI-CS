 We are on right track 

 - Houghton draws inspiration from Syria tie for Cup qualifiers 

JAYDEEP BASU

 Bob Houghton 

New Delhi: Soon after India went down to Syria on Thursday, coach Bob Houghton instructed his wards not to discuss the match in the next 24 hours. 

Bob doesnt believe in immediate post-mortem, said a senior member of the team on Friday. He strictly told us not to discuss the match among ourselves so that we dont get into a blame game which goes against team spirit, he added. 

Post-Syria, Houghton granted a days rest to all footballers who played a part in the match. The other players were made to work out in the evening. 

He did call the coaching staff for a meeting, said one of the coaches. But he will meet the boys on Saturday to analyse the Syria match and discuss strategy for the game against Kyrgyzstan. 

A draw in that match will take India to a clash with Syria. 

Captain Bhaichung Bhutia sounded disappointed with the teams show. India went down 2-3, missing out on a chance to earn a point. 

We played better football against Bangladesh, said the ace striker. We could create more openings in that match we should have played better against Syria. 

About his own performance, Bhaichung said he was tightly marked. The number three (Ali Dyeb) in the Syrian defence was always after me. Perhaps marking me was his only assignment that evening. 

Despite the Syria reversal, the entire Indian squad is confident of making the final. Against Kyrgyzstan, it will be a totally different ball game. We will surely reach the final, said midfielder Rennedy Singh, who had to make way for Clifford Miranda in the tie against Syria. 

The absence of Deepak Mondal in the Indian defence was badly felt against Syria. Gourmangi Singh looked nervous, while Mahesh Gawli was found wanting in speed. N.S. Manju, too, was not up to the mark as a wingback. 

The fighting show against Syria, according to Houghton, has given India some extra confidence for the World Cup qualifier against Lebanon. Syria and Lebanon play similar kind of football. Our showing on Thursday proved we are on the right track, he said. 

Mondal, who flew to Mumbai on Thursday, was examined by Dr Anant Joshi. According to AIFF sources, he would be operated upon next month.

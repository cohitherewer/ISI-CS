 Vaughan steps down as one-day captain

Chester-le-Street: Michael Vaughan stepped down as Englands one-day captain on Monday following their poor performance in the World Cup. 

The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said the new captain would be revealed on Friday. Although allrounder Paul Collingwood is the favourite to get the job, batsman Kevin Pietersens name has also been mentioned as a likely candidate. 

Since our disappointing performances in the World Cup, I have been giving careful consideration as to what is the best way forward for the England one-day team and my own role within the side, Vaughan said. 

The 32-year-old captain said he reached his decision some time ago but did not want to announce it until near the end of the Test series against the West Indies, which concludes on Tuesday. 

Owing to intense speculation in the media about my future, I feel it is important to make my intentions clear now, Vaughan said. 

Our priority is to build a one-day squad able to compete strongly at the next World Cup and I firmly believe that the interests of the team will be best served if I step down and allow another player to gain additional experience of captaincy in the one-day International arena, Vaughan said. 

Vaughan remains captain of the Test side and their 60-run victory over the West Indies at Old Trafford in the third Test made him Englands most successful captain with 21 victories in 35 games. 

Vaughan, Collingwood and Pietersen are playing in the fourth and final Test against the West Indies. 

Collingwood scored his fifth Test century on Monday while Pietersen was out without scoring. 

Vaughan has struggled with serious injuries in the past two years and is battling to regain the form that made him a world-class batsman. 

But he has not been able to strike one-day form with the bat or with his captaincy and England failed to reach the final stages of this years World Cup. 

In the Caribbean, Vaughan scored 130 runs in the first eight games before scoring 79 in the last match against the West Indies, a dead match as both teams were already eliminated. 

The 32-year-old Vaughan has been in charge of Englands one-day fortunes since Nasser Hussain stepped down after the 2003 World Cup. 

He has led the side in 60 matches, winning 32 and losing 22. But his career one-day average is only 27.15 from 86 games, and he has never made a limited-over century. 

Vaughan said he looked forward to a strong relationship with the new ODI captain. 

I will continue to play one-day cricket for Yorkshire and it is not my intention to retire from ODIs as a player, he said. I do, however, fully appreciate that the new captain will need a period of time to establish his own authority over the team. 

On Friday, England selectors will announce the squad to take on the West Indies in two Twenty20 matches and three ODIs. 

England are ranked second in the world in Tests but only seventh in one-dayers. 

A rare success came in Australia in February when they claimed a tri-series win over the hosts. (Agencies)

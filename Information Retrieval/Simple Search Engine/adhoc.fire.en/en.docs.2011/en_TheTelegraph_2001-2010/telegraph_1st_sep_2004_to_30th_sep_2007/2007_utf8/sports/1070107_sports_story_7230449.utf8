The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Playing in India turned my career around

 - Koubek determined to make up for lost time 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chennai: A career-high ranking of 20, a doping ban, a sharp drop in numbers which took him back to the Challenger level Stefan Koubek has seen it all since turning pro in 1994. To the Austrians credit, he has dared to fight the odds and is beginning to reap the rewards for showing a strong mental resolve. 

Age is not on his side, having turned 30 earlier this week. But Koubek is not one to count the years. 

I am a strong and fit guy, thats the advantage I have over most players... I dont feel my age, a confident Koubek told The Telegraph. 

Its been a dream week for Koubek, who is now a win away from the Chennai Open crown. Three months ago in Mumbai, the sports car fanatic had knocked out world No. 10 Mario Ancic en route to the last four. 

Its been really good for me in Mumbai and Chennai, the people are very friendly, nice hotels, weathers hot but not a problem for me... Playing in India has turned my career around, he remarked. 

Its with good reasons that Koubek talks of his fondness for this country. The three-month ban the ITF slapped on him after he tested positive for using a banned substance (glucocorticos-teroid) cost him precious ranking points. He missed the first quarter of 2005 and struggled to win matches on return to competitive tennis. By the end of that year, he found himself at No. 170 on the ATP list. 

That was a very difficult time. I felt hard done by because I was not at fault. I just took an injection to treat a wrist injury and even asked the doctor if it was safe. He assured me there was nothing to worry about, explained Koubek. 

I had to start 2006 from scratch, but I didnt give up, the muscular left-hander recalled. Getting into Tour events was impossible with my ranking and I had to play 12 Challengers that year where there are so many tough players. 

The key to Koubeks climb back up the ladder was making capital use of the limited opportunities he got in Tour events. Mumbai was one of them. 

I reached the final of the Zagreb event, then had some poor results in Challengers. I was thrilled to get a direct entry to Mumbai and did well there. Soon, I was back in top-100, said Koubek who ended the year at No. 81. 

An admirer of Marcelo Rios and Andre Agassi, Koubeks idol is countryman Thomas Muster. 

He was a big influence... he won a Grand Slam, became world No. 1 and like me was a left-hander. It was good to have him as Davis Cup captain, Koubek said. 

Can he emulate Musters feats? We all play to win Grand Slams, to be No. 1... Lets see what the future has in store for me. 

Winning a major may just be out of reach, but dont count out this Austrian streetfighter when it comes to popping a surprise or three.

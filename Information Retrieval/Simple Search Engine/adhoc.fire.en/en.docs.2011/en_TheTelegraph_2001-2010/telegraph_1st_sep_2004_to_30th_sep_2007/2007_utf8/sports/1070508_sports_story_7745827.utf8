 Cancel Asian tour, AFC tells United 

Kuala Lumpur: Asian Football Confederation (AFC) president Mohamed bin Hammam on Monday launched a stinging attack on Manchester United, calling them disrespectful and demanding they cancel their Asian tour. 

According to the official, Manchester Uniteds planned visit could hurt efforts to promote the July 7-29 Asian Cup, which is the AFCs flagship tournament. The English champions are also scheduled to end the tour in Malaysia on July 27, just two days before the Asian Cup final in Jakarta. 

The message is, cancel your tour, Bin Hammam said on the eve of the AFCs annual congress. 

It is disrespectful to us and shows no solidarity within the football world. Cancel your tour. That is the message from all the teams, coaches and players in Asia, he said. (Agencies)

 Shields plan 

Karachi: Jamaicas deputy police commissioner Mark Shields said Pakistani players could be called to testify at the inquest into Bob Woolmers death. He, however, declined to say which players might be called to give testimony in the inquiry. 

The inquest has now been postponed because of recent and significant developments in the case. 

But none of the PCB officials was aware of what the recent and significant developments were and denied reports that the Jamaican authorities had written a letter to the PCB asking it to send some players including Inzamam-ul Haq and Mushtaq Ahmed to Kingston for the inquest.

 Sarwan to lead Windies

Bridgetown: Seasoned middle-order batsman Ramnaresh Sarwan has been appointed the West Indies captain. He will succeed Brian Lara who quit after the World Cup. 

According to a Caribbean news agency report, Sarwan was the unanimous choice during the West Indies Cricket Boards special board meeting on Sunday. Gordon Greenidge, chairman of the selection panel, proposed Sarwans name. 

Sarwan served as Laras deputy in the World Cup. The 26-year-old Guyanese, who is reportedly in Miami, will join the selectors in Antigua to pick the squad for the tour of England. The West Indies are scheduled to play four Tests, two Twenty20 internationals and three ODIs during the May 12-July 7 tour. 

At the special meeting, the WICB also discussed issues like appointment of a coach following Bennett Kings resignation after the world cup, besides negotiations with the West Indies Players Association. (PTI)

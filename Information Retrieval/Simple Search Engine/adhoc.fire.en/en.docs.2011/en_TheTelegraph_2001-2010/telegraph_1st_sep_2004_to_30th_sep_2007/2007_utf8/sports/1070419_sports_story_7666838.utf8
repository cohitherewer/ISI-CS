 PCB appoints paid selectors

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Pakistan captain will no longer have the final say in team selection. According to the PCBs new selection policy, for home matches, the selection committee will pick the final XI after consulting the captain. 

For overseas tours, the selection committee will pick the squad after consulting the captain and the playing XI for each match will be done by a tour selection committee comprising the captain, the vice-captain, the tour manager and the coach. 

The PCB also appointed a three-member full-time paid selection committee, headed by former Test cricketer Salahuddin Ahmed, according to a release. Besides Salahuddin, the new committee includes Saleem Jaffer and Shafqat Rana. 

The previous committee, which was chaired by Wasim Bari, resigned after the teams first round exit from the World Cup. The new committee has been appointed for two years.

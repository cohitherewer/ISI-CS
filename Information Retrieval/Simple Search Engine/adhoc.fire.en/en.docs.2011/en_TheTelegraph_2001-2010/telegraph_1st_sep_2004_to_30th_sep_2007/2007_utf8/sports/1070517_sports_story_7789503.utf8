 Pak players quizzed: Report

Karachi: A new twist was added in the Bob Woolmer case on Wednesday with reports claiming that two Pakistani investigators, Mir Zubair and Kaleem Imam had questioned six players and two officials recently in Lahore. 

A TV channel reported that the players had been sent questionnaires and then questioned by the two investigators who recently returned from Kingston, Jamaica where they were sent by the Pakistan government. 

Reports said that Mushtaq Ahmed had specially come down from England to be questioned by the investigators. But, the Pakistan manager, Talat Ali said that he was not questioned by anyone. I am not sure about the others. But no such development has come to my knowledge. I will have to find out, he said. (PTI)

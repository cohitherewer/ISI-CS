 SHARP SINGLES 

McGraths revelation

Melbourne: Glenn McGrath said he kept himself

 at a distance from Brian Lara in the early days of their rivalry so as not

 to let him become too familiar with his bowling.

I didnt want to have too much to do with him because I did not want him to know me too well. I wanted to keep that a bit of a mystery. I wanted to try and get an edge over him, the

 fast bowler said. McGrath revealed he and Lara have become friendly only in

 the past three-four years. 

Bangla support 

Dhaka: Over 2 million Bangladeshis have signed a 70-foot-long cricket bat wishing their team good luck in the World Cup, an official said on Tuesday. A private firm sent the bat on a country-wide signature tour from March 14, a day after the World Cup began in the Caribbean. 

We hope more people would be interested to sign after Bangladesh qualified for the Super Eight, said an enthusiast.

ICC rights

London: The International Cricket Council has ordered online video-sharing group Youtube to remove hundreds of World Cup clips, claiming copyright infringement.

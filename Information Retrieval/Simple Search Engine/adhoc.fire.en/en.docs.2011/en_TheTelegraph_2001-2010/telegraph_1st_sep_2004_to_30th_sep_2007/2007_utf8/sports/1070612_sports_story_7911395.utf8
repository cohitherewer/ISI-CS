 Sunny: Were back to square one

A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES

Calcutta: Graham Fords decision to not accept the Team India coachs job has drawn mixed reactions. While former coach Aunshuman Gaekwad had supported the South African, Ajit Wadekar and Chetan Chauhan said Fords availability should have been checked before making the announcement. Sunil Gavaskar felt India were back to square one with Fords refusal. The following are excerpts: 

 CHETAN CHAUHAN: To 

 be very frank, I was expecting this because Ford did not 

 commit. He should have committed straightaway. Once he came 

 for the interview he should have sorted out all his problems. 

 He knew he was contracted to Kent until 2008. I think BCCI 

 has made a mistake. John Emburey can be appointed for the 

 tour of England, and in the meantime, BCCI should ask for 

 fresh applications and have a coach for a two-year period. 

 AUNSHUMAN GAEKWAD: 

 There could be various reasons for Fords decision, 

 but the one-year appointment must have been the main one. 

 No sensible person would have accepted the offer for such 

 a short tenure. 

We will be playing non-stop cricket and he will get no time to know the boys. There will be no time to rectify the mistakes and undertake damage control measures in such a short time. 

The appointment should have been for a minimum of two years, with the option for another two-year extension. Remember, we dont know what was said at the meeting. Im sure he had made up his mind in Chennai itself... Im proud that he showed the guts to say no. 

 SUNIL GAVASKAR: 

 We are back to square one, it is a fact of life I dont 

 know what the BCCIs thinking is, whether it will start 

 the process (of appointing a coach) all over again or make 

 a short-term appointment as it did for the Bangladesh tour. 

 AJIT WADEKAR: 

 I think we have made laughing stock of ourselves. Without 

 getting to know his availability, what he has in mind, or 

 whether he wanted to accept it or not, weve told the 

 world that Ford is our next coach. We should have checked 

 all that We should have given him some time before announcing 

 (his appointment) immediately. We should have given him 

 a couple of days to think it over. I think thats how 

 it should have been done.

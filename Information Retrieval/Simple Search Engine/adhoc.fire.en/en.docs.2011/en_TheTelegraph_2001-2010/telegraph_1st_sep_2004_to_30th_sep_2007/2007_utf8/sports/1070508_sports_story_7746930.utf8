 57th career win for Woods 

DAMON HACK

Charlotte: There have been tidier victories to come out of the golf bag of Tiger Woods, but he has even mastered making the stressful and dramatic look like expressions of himself. 

On Sunday at the Quail Hollow Club, his adversaries included his own whirring swing, which was just out of kilter enough to put a fine day of work in jeopardy. Woods had a double bogey and a bogey among his last six holes, but he curled in an 8-foot putt for par on the final hole to notch a two-shot victory over Steve Stricker at the Wachovia Championship. 

With a three-under-par 69, Woods finished at 13-under 275 to set the tournament scoring record by a shot. 

This game is fickle, said Woods, whose 57th victory on the PGA Tour, and first at this event, featured a little bit of everything. The game goes away and you have to get it back again. One day youre hitting it too high, and the next day youre hitting it too low. 

When Woods retrieved his ball from the cup after his final putt, he spun toward the gallery and flung his ball into the air after his third victory in six starts this year on the PGA Tour. 

Woods hit his golf ball a lot places at Quail Hollow, but he often found ways to bend the situation in his favour. 

After trailing Rory Sabbatini (74) by a shot going into the final round, Woods tied him with a birdie on the fourth hole before pushing his tee shot wide right on the 532-yard par-5 seventh. 

The ball came to rest 12 inches from a creek that runs along the hole and separates the golf course from the backyards of several palatial estates. As Woods pondered his options for an approach shot, a large brown dog scurried just across the way. Woods grabbed a 7-iron, ignored the commotion and landed his ball 55 feet from the cup. 

After studying the putt, Woods lightly tapped his ball, watched it tumble downhill over a swale, and did not turn away until it dropped into the hole for an eagle-3. 

He raised his hands, took two steps to the left and punched the air with an uppercut. Woods had a one-shot lead over Stricker (69) and Vijai Singh (74) and admitted that he was lucky that his tee shot had stayed dry. 

It should have probably been a 6 on the hole, he said. It should have been wet. 

When Woods followed the eagle with birdies on the next two holes, his lead stood at three and his competitors seemed to face long odds. Sabbatini, who had wished for a final-round pairing with Woods, opened with nine consecutive pars and fell quickly off the pace. 

They had met several times in college tournaments, but Woods has added a lot of pounds and even more trophies since.

 Kensington experience gives England the edge 

 Scyld Berry 

Only one match in town this week. A quarter final, it has been called, but England supporters are forgetting that even if England beat South Africa, they will still have to do well against West Indies on Saturday before they can be certain of qualifying for the World Cup semi-finals. 

Although South Africa have more points, England have one big advantage: they have played once before at the renovated Kensington Oval, South Africa never. 

And it was no ordinary pitch which England saw last Wednesday when they beat Bangladesh. 

It began as an old-time Barbados pitch, fast, shiny and bouncy, yet after a few hours of wear and tear and heat it had become a different surface. Like an Englishman after a few rum punches, it had loosened up, and was offering turn as well as bounce. 

Any reservations which England may have had about playing Monty Panesar were banished, if not by his three lower-order wickets then by the sight of the Bangladeshi spinners gaining so much assistance in the second half of the game. 

England have to adhere to the same team and cannot afford experiments at this late stage or might Jamie Dalrymple, as an extra spinner, replace Ravi Bopara? 

Pitches so far have been the best feature of this tournament. They have favoured both sides pretty equally, and both batsmen and bowlers. 

At 9.30 am they have helped the new-ball bowlers, and by late afternoon they have helped the slower bowlers, with batsmen indulging in between. 

It is good for cricket, and a commendation for the groundsman, when a side on winning the toss doesnt know whether to bat or bowl first. But in a quarter-final you virtually have to bat first because there is far more pressure on the side chasing.

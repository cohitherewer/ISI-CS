 Hari shocked

Paks (Hungary): Top seed P. Harikrishna suffered a shock defeat at the hands of GM Peter Acs of Hungary in the first round of Marx Gyorgy Memorial International chess tournament underway here. 

After a fine stint in Montreal where he finished third, this came as a shocker for Harikrishna as Acs is rated Elo 134 rating points behind the Indian. 

The first day spelt blood in the six-player double round robin tournament with all the three games ending decisively. 

Legendary victor Korchnoi of Switzerland who is the oldest participant here at 77 years scored a clinical victory over youngest participant Hou Yifan of China who is just 13 years old.

 Tiwary returns after check-up 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Tiwary wont be fit for the England ODIs 

Calcutta: Manoj Tiwary returned to the city on Friday after a post-surgery check-up in London. He hopes to be fit for the ICC World Twenty20 meet in South Africa next month. 

Dr Andrew Wallace was very happy with my progress. He said I was only 10 per cent away from match fitness. He has, however, advised me to stay away from international cricket for the time being, Tiwary said. 

As a result, I will not be available for the ODI series in England. I will start full-fledged practice next week and hope to be fit for the Twenty20 meet, he added. 

Tiwary also informed that Team India physio John Gloster was present during his check-up. 

The Bengal batsman had injured himself during a training session in Dhaka ahead of the ODI series against Bangladesh last May.

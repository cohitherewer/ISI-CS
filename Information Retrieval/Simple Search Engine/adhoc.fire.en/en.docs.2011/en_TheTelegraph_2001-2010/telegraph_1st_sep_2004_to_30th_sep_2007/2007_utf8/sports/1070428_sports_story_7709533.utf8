The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 CUP TRIVIA

 Saturday

 will mark Australias sixth appearance (1975, 1987, 1996, 1999,

 2003 amp; 2007) in the title round the most by any team and the

 second for Sri Lanka (1996 amp; 2007). 

 The Aussies have won the title thrice (1987, 1999 and 2003), the most by any team, while the Lankans have won it once before in 1996. 

 Australia are the only side to appear in four successive finals (1996, 1999, 2003 and 2007). England have reached the final on three occasions (in 1979, 1987 amp; 1992) but are yet to win the title. 

 Since 1992, at least one team from the subcontinent has reached the final. 

 The Kensington Oval at Bridgetown, Barbados, will became the sixth venue to host a final after Lords (1975, 1979, 1983 and 1999), Eden Gardens (1987), Melbourne Cricket Ground (1992), Gaddafi Stadium (1996) and the Wanderers (2003). 

 Australias victory margin of 125 runs against India in 2003 is the biggest in terms of runs in a World Cup final. 

 Australias 8-wicket win (179 balls to spare) over Pakistan in 1979 is the biggest in terms of wickets and balls to spare. 

 The most closely fought final so far has been Australias 7-run win over England in 1987. 

 Australias 359 for two in 50 overs against India (2003) is the highest total recorded in a final. 

 Australias 274 (in 58.4 overs) against the West Indies (1975) is the highest total yet by a losing team. Its also the highest by a team batting second. 

 Pakistans 132 (in 39 overs) against Australia in 1999 is the lowest total made by any team in final. 

 Indias 183 (in 54.4 overs) against the West Indies in 1983 is the lowest total by a winning team. 

 The 2003 final between Australia and India produced 593 runs for 12 wickets (runs/wicket: 49.42) the highest aggregate in a World Cup final. The 1999 final between Australia and Pakistan produced just 265 runs for 12 wickets (runs/wicket: 22.08). 

 If they feature in playing XI on Saturday, both Ricky Ponting and Glenn McGrath will appear in four World finals, a record. 

 If Australia claim the title, Adam Gilchrist, Ricky Ponting and Glenn McGrath will have appeared in three successful Cup-winning teams. 

 If Australia win, Ricky Ponting will emulate former West Indies captain Clive Lloyd (1983 and 1979) to lead their respective sides to World Cup titles on two occasions. 

 Englands Graham Gooch has been the member of a losing side on three occasions (1979, 1987, 1992). 

 In the eight World Cup finals so far, four centuries, 16 fifties and 14 ducks have been recorded. 

 Ricky Pontings unbeaten 140 against India (2003) is the highest individual score in a final. 

 West Indies Clive Lloyd (102 against Australia in 1975), Viv Richards (138* against England in 1979) and Sri Lankas Aravinda de Silva (107 not out against Australia in 1996) are the only others to register centuries in finals. 

 Clive Lloyd and Ponting (see above) are the only captains to do so. 

 Ricky Pontings aggregate of 209 runs across three World Cup finals is the best by any batsman. 

 Though no batsman has made a score in the 90s in a final, Damien Martyns unbeaten 88 against India in 2003 is the highest score by a batsman not making a three figure score. 

 Virender Sehwags 82 against Australia in 1996 is the highest score by a batsman for a losing side. 

 Adam Gilchrists 57 against India in 2003 is the highest by a wicket-keeper in a final. Gilchrist, incidentally, has also another fifty to his credit 54 versus Pakistan in 1999. 

 Adam Gilchrists 50 in 33 balls in 1999 is the quickest fifty by a batsman in a final, while Clive Lloyds 82-ball hundred in 1975 is the quickest century. 

 The quickest knock by a batsman in a final is 33 in 19 balls (S/R 173.68) by Wasim Akram against England in 1992. 

 The slowest innings by a batsman is 1 in 14 balls (S/R 7.14) by Wajahatullah Wasti of Pakistan against Australia in 1999. 

 Ricky Ponting (140*) has struck the most number of sixes (8) versus India in 2003 

 Aravinda de Silva (107*) has hit the most number of boundaries (13) against Australia in 1996 

 The highest partnership for any wicket in a final is the unbeaten 234-run stand for the third wicket between Ponting and Martyn against India in 2003. 

 The highest partnership for the first wicket in a final came from Geoffrey Boycott and Mike Brearley, when they put on 129 runs against the West Indies in 1979. Despite this effort, their team lost. 

 Australian left-arm pace bowler Gary Gilmour (5/48 in 12 overs against the West Indies in 1975) and West Indies Joel Garner (5/38 in 11 overs against England in 1979) are the only bowlers to claim a five-wicket haul in a final. 

 Shane Warne (4/33 against Pakistan in 1999) has the best bowling figures for a spinner in a final.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 BCCI to give Chappell a full hearing

 - Yuvraj a clear frontrunner if selectors are bold enough to appoint a young captain 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Greg Chappell

Calcutta: Greg Chappell will be given a full hearing by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president, Sharad Pawar, before a call is made on his future. 

We need to be fair to the coach Being the employer, weve got to have an open mind till such time that he has been heard out. Moreover, if we dont give a full hearing, then the market is going to get the wrong signal, a

 well-placed source told The Telegraph. 

In other words, anything less could discourage those from overseas who would otherwise be keen once its confirmed that Chappells contract wont be renewed. 

The best wont be interested if word gets around that the BCCI isnt reasonable Weve got to be conscious of that, the source added, on Tuesday evening. 

Incidentally, the BCCI may look at appointing an interim coach as theres not enough time (assuming its bye-bye Chappell) to invite CVs and interview candidates before Team Indias next engagement in Bangladesh, from May 10-29. 

If thats the immediate course of action, then the interim coach will have to be an Indian. 

Back in 2000, the BCCI returned to Aunshuman Gaekwad for the short period (ICC KnockOut in Kenya and the inaugural Test versus Bangladesh) after Kapil Devs resignation and before John Wright took charge. 

The BCCI could do just that once again. 

Other names being floated are Mohinder Jimmy Amarnath and Sandeep Patil. 

Meanwhile, former president Inderjit Singh Bindra has promised that the BCCI wont shirk responsibility and that the players must not be made to feel unwanted. 

He currently heads the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA). 

I am as angry as anyone in the country. Even as I am trying to cope with the sinking feeling, I am more concerned about the broader picture of Indian cricket. Honestly, most of my colleagues in the Board are also highly disturbed by the turn of events 

As a trained bureaucrat, I know we have to move ahead. I can only assure everyone that the Board will not shirk responsibility in addressing the issues thrown up by the Caribbean disaster and come up with measures that will invigorate Indian cricket. 

The Board has, in the past, shown that it can take tough decisions and it will not be found wanting at this critical juncture. If need be, the decisions will be harsh, howsoever unpleasant they be 

We welcome any suggestion to improve the cricket administration in the country. But the first and foremost thing is to tell our cricketers, at this hour, that we care for them. They need our support and compassion, are excerpts from Bindras column on the PCA website. 

With Pawar blowing hot-and-cold, its anybodys guess as to whats going to be done by the BCCI. 

Footnote: Should the senior national selectors take

 a gamble by appointing a youngster to succeed Rahul Dravid, then

 the clear frontrunner for the captaincy is Chandigarh da puttar Yuvraj Singh. He has already served as stand-in vice-captain.

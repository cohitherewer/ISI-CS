The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IN THE CITY

 The Football Players Association of India (FPAI) will hold a fund-raiser for the families of late Indian captains Sudip Chatterjee and V.P. Sathyan on February 10. A benefit tie will be played between Bhaichung Bhutia XI and Jose Ramirez Barreto XI at the Howrah municipality ground. We are expecting to raise Rs. 1.5 lakh for each family, Bhaichung told a press conference on Saturday. While Bhaichung XI will comprise Indian players, Barreto XI will consist of foreigners playing in India.

 Besides playing, our priority is also to help other footballers. The sad demise of these two former captains is not only a loss to their respective families, but to the football fraternity as a whole, Bhaichung added.

 When asked if FPAI wants a pension policy for players from the AIFF a la BCCI, the Indian captain said: If needed, we will approach the federation on the issue. On the match, Barreto jokingly said, its going to be a prestige tie for us and well definitely win. There may not be too many outstation players, but I.M. Vijayan is a certainty to play for Bhaichung XI, the captain said.

 Mohammedan Sporting will undergo a residential camp under the supervision of coach Subhas Bhowmick in Barasat from Monday till February 13. The coach asked for the camp to be organised and hopefully, it will help the team in the long run, a club official said. According to him, Mike Okoro has got in touch with the club management and may arrive on Tuesday.

 Meanwhile, Bhowmick on Saturday initiated the process of disciplining players who fail to turn up for practice. Debjit Ghosh and Raman Vijayan were the Day I defaulters.

 Ketan Gupta and Biju Chowdhury took four and three wickets, respectively, and helped Calcutta Customs cruise to an eight-wicket victory over CCFC on Day I of the CAB first division league on Saturday. On the opening day, Kalighat also defeated Belgachia United by 44 runs in another match.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Move may be to ensure Dalmiya is no factor at all in 2008

 - Sharad Pawar group comfortably placed to push through president-elect amendment 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Jagmohan Dalmiya 

Calcutta: The official word is that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) wants to go the International Cricket Council (ICC) way. However, theres a suggestion in some quarters that the move to install a president-elect is actually driven by a political motive. 

Specifically that the ousted Jagmohan Dalmiya, one-time czar of Indian cricket, doesnt become a factor when Sharad Pawars (three-year) term as president ends in September 2008. 

The situation can become fluid once Pawar is on the way out and, so, its best to settle the issue (of his successor) while hes still in office, a well-placed source told The Telegraph on Thursday. 

Going by the rotation policy, it will be Centrals turn for the top post and the vice-president from the zone, Vidarbhas Shashank Manohar, is expected to be nominated. 

As theres no provision in the BCCIs constitution for the post of president-elect, the Pawar group intends pushing through an amendment at a Special General Meeting in Mumbai on August 21. 

For such changes, a two-thirds majority is required. At the moment, Pawar and his men are very comfortably placed. 

The relevant amendment reads: The election to the office of the President from the next zone shall be held one year prior to the end of the three-year term of the existing zone and the person so elected would be designated as President-elect for one year... 

The following are eligible to contest for the post of president and president-elect: Past or present office-bearers of the BCCI or its vice-presidents. Moreover the candidate(s) must have represented a Full member from the same zone at two AGMs. 

The Calcutta High Court has, of course, stayed Dalmiyas suspension by the BCCI, but the Pawar group is going to challenge that interim order. It came less than a fortnight ago. 

Meanwhile, its learnt that the BCCI intends introducing a third category of members Affiliate in addition to the Full and Associate ones. 

The proposed amendment includes the following: Any State within India which is not covered by Full Member or Associate Member (status), other than a Union Territory, may be recognised as an Affiliate Member... 

The ICC has three categories.

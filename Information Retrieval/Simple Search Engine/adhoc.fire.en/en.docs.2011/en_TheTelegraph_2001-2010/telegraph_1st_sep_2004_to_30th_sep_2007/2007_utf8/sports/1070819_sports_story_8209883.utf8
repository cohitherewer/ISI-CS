 Panel sets Shoaib date

Karachi: Shoaib Akhtar was on Saturday asked to appear before an appellate committee of the Pakistan Cricket Board on Monday as it hears the appeal filed by the fast bowler against the Rs 300,000-fine imposed on him. 

The two-member committee, after its first meeting in Lahore, decided to hear Shoaib out in person. 

Shoaib was fined and docked points from his central contract for bad behaviour after he left the training camp in Karachi earlier this month without informing team manager Talat Ali. The fast bowler claims he left the camp after informing captain Shoaib Malik. 

The Rawalpindi Express was also docked points for not responding to a showcause notice issued to him by the PCB disciplinary committee. (PTI)

 ICC in a crisis

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: With Percy Sonns passing away, the International Cricket Council (ICC) is without a head, but its functioning is unlikely to be affected as the presidents post is largely an ornamental one. 

As no vice president was in place, the ball is now in the Executive Boards court. The Board members will now have to decide on who gets to act as the president till such time that Sonns successor is elected. 

Sonns term was till June 2009, but at the moment, its not clear whether the acting president will fulfil duties for a brief period or till June 2009. 

Indias Sharad Pawar and Englands David Morgan are the ones involved in a fight to become the next ICC president. As neither secured the requisite number of votes earlier this year, the matter has been left to the ICCs Nominations Committee to determine what is the best way forward. 

Pawar is intent on the top job. At this point in time, so is Morgan.

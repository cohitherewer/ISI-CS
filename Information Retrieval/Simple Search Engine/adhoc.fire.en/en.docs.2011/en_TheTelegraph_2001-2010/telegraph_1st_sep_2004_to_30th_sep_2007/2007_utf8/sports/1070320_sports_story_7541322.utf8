The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I will never forget him: Inzamam 

Kingston: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq had planned to discuss his future with coach Bob Woolmer on Sunday and was left shattered by the Englishmans sudden death following the teams shock World Cup exit. 

[In a condolence message, Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf, who is also chief patron of Pakistan Cricket Board, said: His death is a great loss to the cricketing fraternity as he was undoubtedly a top coach. His death has come as a big shock to everyone.] 

After the press conference (on Saturday) was the last time I talked to him. He asked me on the bus when we were coming back to the hotel what are your future plans? Can we discuss them tomorrow?, Inzamam was quoted as saying by a website. 

After that he was in his room and I was in my room. Tomorrow never came. 

The first time I knew of Bobs illness was when our assistant manager rang me Sunday morning and said the coach is not feeling well and maybe he is upset, Inzamam said. 

When I went to see him he was lying on the floor and it was shocking for me. 

I will never forget him. He was a very good coach and a super human being. 

After the match against Ireland he was upset but he said to me and to all the players that these things happen in cricket, said the 37-year-old, who also announced his retirement from one-day Internationals on Sunday. 

He told us about the 99 World Cup when his South African team was knocked out in the semi-final after a tie. He was brave and knew how to handle the situation when everybody was feeling down. 

Bob was very close to me because I am the captain. He was a very positive man. Whenever somebody is in trouble, not in good touch or good form, he was always helpful and his feelings were with them. He was friendly with the players. 

The following are other reactions from Pakistans past and present cricketers and officials (in alphabetical order): 

SHOAIB AKHTAR: I am very sad. Its a very big tragedy and I am completely in a shock. Before leaving for the West Indies, we met each other, we both hugged each other and we shared lots of thoughts. 

DR NASIM ASHRAF: We have lost a family member and his death is a great loss to Pakistan cricket. He was a thorough gentleman who instilled team spirit in the team. He was a very popular personality in our cricket team. 

WASIM BARI: We had a good relationship with him. He was a thorough professional, he was a wonderful person to work with. 

RASHID LATIF: His tragic death will offset some of the anger at the teams performance. But it has been a bad week for Pakistan cricket. 

JAVED MIANDAD: The sadness of the way he passed away will always remain with us. No matter what has happened in the past, I am deeply saddened to hear his death. He was a decent human being. 

HANIF MOHAMMAD: I am very sad and I think he took stress after Pakistan lost to Ireland. 

RAMEEZ RAJA: I think he knew being coach of the Pakistan team was a high pressure job and he was good at taking criticism and tolerating the extreme reactions in Pakistan cricket. The team did show improvement under him and I dont think we should judge him on the basis of one or two performances. 

WAQAR YOUNIS: He was great for the game, he worked hard all his life. Ive played with a lot of coaches, when it comes to professionalism, he was the best. Hes been a great friend to the players.

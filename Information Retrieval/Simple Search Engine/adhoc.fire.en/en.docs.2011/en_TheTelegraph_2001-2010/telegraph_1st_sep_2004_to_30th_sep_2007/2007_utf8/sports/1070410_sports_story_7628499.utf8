 Gibbs doubtful vs WI

St Georges: South Africa may have to go into their World Cup Super Eight clash against the West Indies on Tuesday without injured batsman Herschelle Gibbs. 

Gibbs strained his left calf muscle while fielding in South Africas 67-run defeat by Bangladesh on Saturday. Gibbs did not bat during a training session on Monday and coach Mickey Arthur said South Africa would delay a decision on his involvement until the last minute. 

Were leaving it until later for Herschelle, hes probably no more than 50-50 at the moment, Arthur told a news conference. If Gibbs is ruled out, Arthur said opener AB de Villiers would probably move down the order to No.4. Loots Bosman is expected to step in to the side as Gibbs replacement. 

The West Indies, however, have been thrown a lifeline by lowly Bangladeshs shock victory over South Africa. 

The West Indies players watched the South Africans lose from their Grenada hotel and have spotted a weakness. The West Indies believe that if they can post a serious target, their bowlers can apply pressure. 

We have three games left in the tournament and if we win all of them we have a great chance of making the semi-finals. That is enough motivation, captain Brain Lara said on Monday. 

The most important thing is to put the (South African) team under pressure. In the games we won in the group stage we put the opposition under pressure early on. 

Our aim is going to be to get our heads in front at the beginning of the game and that can create a lot of pressure for the other side, said Lara. 

Coach Bennett King said: Weve got another opportunity and weve just got to put our best foot forward. Obviously, we need to make more runs. The players to a man recognise they have a lot of responsibility, specially in the engine room up in the top four. 

Wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin also said the hosts want to make the most of the opportunity handed to them. As we have seen South Africa are not a good chasing side. If we go out and score 260-275 and put them under pressure and create some doubts in the batsmens minds and then pick up a couple of early wickets, we can do the job.

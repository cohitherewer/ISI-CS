 Sandeep Patil roped in by ICL

- Appointment may cost ex-India coach BCCI pension

 Sandeep Patil will coach one of the six sides 

Mumbai: The proposed Indian Cricket League (ICL) has roped in former Test batsman and national coach Sandeep Patil into its fold but the appointment may cost the ex-player the monthly pension hes entitled to receive from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). 

Yes, Sandeep Patil has joined the ICL and will be coaching one of the six teams, the leagues creative head Ajay Kapoor said. 

The 50-year-old, who played in 29 Tests and 45 ODIs for India in the 1980s, took the plunge to join the rebel league on Thursday, according to sources close to him. 

But the Mumbai stalwart, who has represented Madhya Pradesh in Ranji Trophy, may have kissed goodbye to the monthly pension hes receiving from the BCCI along with two other former India and ICL colleagues Kapil Dev and Kiran More. Patil, it may be recalled, also guided Kenya to the semi-finals of the 2003 World Cup as coach. 

The board has decided to stop all the entitlements to any current or former player, official or umpire who is connected to the ICL. A letter to this effect will soon reach all those who are receiving such remuneration from the board, according to BCCI sources. 

Former players and umpires are receiving Rs 25,000 to Rs 35,000 from the board every month as pension depending on the number of matches they have played for India or represented their state association in domestic cricket. 

Kapil, the current chairman of the National Cricket Academy, is heading the ICLs executive board while former stumper and selection panel chief More is on the same board even while holding the post of Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) secretary. 

The BCCI working committee had severely criticised both these former cricketers for associating themselves with the rebel body at its meeting in Delhi earlier this month but stopped short of giving show-cause notices to them. 

Though we did not decide to showcause them, Kapil would soon be conveyed the message, while the BCA will take up the matter with More, one member had said after the meeting on June 12. 

Essel chief Subhas Chandra launched the ICL in April promising a one million dollar prize money and names like Brian Lara, Shane Warne, Glenn McGrathare being linked to the event. (PTI)

 French Open failure will not dim Federers greatness

It is springtime and tennis players are migrating to the rich watering holes of Europe. Kicking off from the luxurious Monte Carlo, the tour weaves its way through the capitals of Europe to its summit by end May/early June at the French Open in Roland Garros. 

The slow red clay courts of the circuit provide the most searching tests of a players abilities. Strong legs, stamina, patience and an unyielding spirit threaded together by accuracy, consistency and depth of shot are some of the essentials of victory. 

After 73 consecutive victories on clay courts, Nadal reminds me of a snorting, rampaging bull pawing the red dust in the bullring of the European circuit. His lead of 7 matches to Roger Federers 3 cannot be dismissed as a mere statistic. It has much substance. Federer finds it difficult to handle the topspin, the great mobility and unyielding resolve of Nadal. 

On ATP points, Federer is a massive 2415 points ahead of Nadal, who in turn is about 1900 points ahead of the pack. Cruising high on the thermals of his great talent, Federer knows that the stakes are high and victory in the French Open will anchor him firmly among the all time greats and make him a strong contender for the Greatest-Ever title. 

With his recent losses two consecutive matches to the Argentine Canas, to Nadal and then to Volandri at Rome Federers cloak of invincibility is fraying at the edges. We all know that Federer cannot keep winning all the time and that sooner or later he may have an off day and lose a match. But four losses in a short while cannot be dismissed easily. It has an ominous ring about it. 

The question is are Federers physical and mental fuel tanks running low after more than 5 years of competitive play? It could well be. Can you imagine the strain on the bodys reserves when you have to play 5-6 tough matches per week and then travel across continents and start another tournament on Monday for most of the year? Add to this the load he carries of the highest expectations and compulsion to perform at peak level everyday. 

The intensity and frequency of combat are such that the body is unable to recover from the energy expended by the bodys normal processes. So recovery has to be hastened by artificial methods such as physiotherapy, hydrotherapy etc. Pushing forward the natural recovery time day after day to accelerate recovery, no matter what apparently benign methods you use, must ultimately take its toll. 

Sampras was a master, as was Laver, of balancing their play and energy levels so that they were at their best at the demanding Grand Slams. No wonder Federer discussed this with Laver when they met. I watched Federers match with Canas when he made an unprecedented 50 unforced errors and noticed for the first time a rare impatience and irritability in Federers normally placid temperament. At this point of time, it seems that even if Federer manages to pick up his form, the French Open with Nadal champing at the bit might be too much to ask. The defeats have baffled Federer and his confidence is shaken. 

Federers inability to win the French Open will not make him a lower ranked great. In the history of tennis there has never been a time where the levels of fitness and skills have been at such a high. In fact, a host of hungry youngsters are pushing relentlessly against the boundaries of nature. 

In a recent article Rod Laver talked about the absence of ego in Federer. And that he has no entourage or sycophants in his camp. This is most refreshing. Federer is no robot waiting for signals from the wings; he is a complete tennis player who does his own thinking. To shed your ego in the modern world, where the level of performance is hailed by many as the best ever, is a monumental task. 

This sets Federer apart from some of the modern day loud mouths. In todays sporting world, Federer is a rare gem with a treasured old world lustre.

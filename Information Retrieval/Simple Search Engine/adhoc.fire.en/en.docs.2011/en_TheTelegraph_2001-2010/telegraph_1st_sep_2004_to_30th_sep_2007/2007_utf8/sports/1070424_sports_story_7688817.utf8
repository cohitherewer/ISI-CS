 Moores requires all the help he can muster

MARK NICHOLAS

 Peter Moores 

Duncan Fletcher: the faceless coach who shed tears upon his departure. What a relief, for him and for us. 

The England cricket team appears a disparate group. The hints of cliques and factions remain and these, more than anything, corrupt. A year without an injured captain created confusion and, oddly, Fletcher was unable to reassure. 

By a margin, Fletcher has been Englands finest coach. He earned the trust of his players through consistent selection and undivided loyalty. He urged them to think outside that proverbial bubble and to challenge conventional thinking. 

He abhorred lazy minds and brought a narrow eye to the sloppy first-class structure around him. He lost only one home Test series and won abroad in places previously considered unconquerable.. 

Filling this mans boots will be no sinecure and quite why the ECB have done so in haste is a mystery. Having commissioned the Schofield report, it may have been wise to wait for its findings, which are due in mid-May. 

Michael Vaughan can handle the team perfectly adequately in the short-term and Peter Moores could have dealt with the peripherals. But Moores was signed and delivered in full before Fletchers tears had dried. It has a strange smell about it. 

The ECB should have covered the globe in their search for the right man, or men even, for the demands of modern international cricket may now call for separate coaches in the two forms of the game. 

Does Moores have clue of what is before him? Is it right to appoint a man who will be learning the job as he tiptoes through the corridors of power? Can Moores unravel Andrew Flintoffs malaise and Kevin Pietersens ego? Can he regenerate Andrew Strauss? Will Steve Harmison seduce him? Should he play a part in selecting these players or is his work made easier without that responsibility and its effect? 

Sure, he did a marvellous number at Sussex but his two years at the Academy have not had us turning to the heavens with cries of eureka. 

It may well be that Moores is exactly the right man certainly he is a good man but how do we know, or indeed, what do we know of others? The ECB do some funny things. If I were Ken Schofield, Id lob the report in the bin. David Lloyd, Fletchers predecessor, has said they could have dragged out the one he prepared in 1999, for all the difference it will make. 

The key to English cricket, perhaps to English sport at large, is getting the attitude right. Briefly, Fletcher managed this, first with Nasser Hussain as captain and then, most famously, when Vaughan took over. Vaughan was captain to Fletchers coach in other words, Vaughan led and Fletcher sat at his side. Everyone knew where they stood. 

Inherently, English cricket is selfish. The counties lead the way in this and the players follow. The good ones are spoilt and many become so full of themselves they could burst. Excuses are the norm; hunger for success and self-improvement is not trendy. It is trendy to be cool, not committed. Try that approach in Australia and you are out. 

Somehow, Duncan Fletcher transcended all this and played his part in two of the most glorious years English cricket has known. But he was rarely happy for traps lay around every corner. The more suspicious he became, the more introverted he became and with it was the intransigence that led to his downfall. 

Only the players could have saved him but they were not up to it. Moores will need all the help he can get. The place to start will be in the dressing-room.

 India not to bid

New Delhi: India have withdrawn from the race to stage the 2011 AFC Asian Cup because they would not be able to meet the huge infrastructure requirements. 

We are not making a formal bid, All India Football Federation (AIFF) secretary Albert Colaco said on Thursday. 

Qatar on Tuesday submitted their bid to stage the competition ahead of the Thursday deadline. We tried to see if it would be possible, Colaco said. (Reuters)

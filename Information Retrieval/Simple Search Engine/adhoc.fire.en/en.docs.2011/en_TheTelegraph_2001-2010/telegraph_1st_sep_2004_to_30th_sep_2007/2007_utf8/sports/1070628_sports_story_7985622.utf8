 Indian pacers need to mature: Lillee

Chennai: Pace legend Dennis Lillee on Wednesday said Indian fast bowlers have to mature and become more safe and stable if they are to match the Australians. 

Drawing comparison with the Aussies and the English bowlers, Lillee said Indians were lacking in maturity. 

The Australian and English fast bowlers are pretty safe, stable and more established in their sides, Lillee said during his visit to the MRF Pace Foundation here. 

May be they are lot matured being older in age compared to the present Indian lot. The Indians are competing against each other for their positions too. They are quite young when compared to other teams, he explained. 

Citing the example of Brett Lee, Lillee said the Aussie pacer showed tremendous grit to overcome poor form and nagging injuries to lead the Australian bowling attack. 

It took some time for him to be regular in the team. He was 12th man for a lot of time and injury problems also kept him out. The Indian attack, apart from Zaheer (Khan), is very young. It takes time to mature as well, Lillee said. 

The former Aussie pacer also said selectors have every right to drop players who do not perform. 

I guess it is because of lack of performance. If they are not performing well both in wicket-taking abilities or economy, the selectors are within their right to drop them. 

According to Lillee, Irfan Pathan still had the potential to be a successful all-rounder for the team. Incidentally, both Pathan and Munaf Patel are presently training under him at the academy. 

Lillee also cautioned Sreesanth against trying too many things and adviced to focus on his line and length. 

We do not want him to be trying too much, Lillee said. 

Meanwhile, chief coach of the MRF Pace academy, T.A. Sekhar said Pathan was 99 per cent fit to make a comeback but he would not comment on Munaf as the bowler has not been able to bowl at full throttle. 

If Munaf has been adviced a programme to follow since his back injury, I do not want to change it. I am not a qualified physio or a trainer and I do not want to interfere with his programme. 

As for Pathan, both Sekhar and Lillee said, He does not have a shoulder injury. His wrong action compelled him to use different group of muscles, which is normally used for throwing the ball. He was not using his front arm fully but now he has started using it to a greater extent.

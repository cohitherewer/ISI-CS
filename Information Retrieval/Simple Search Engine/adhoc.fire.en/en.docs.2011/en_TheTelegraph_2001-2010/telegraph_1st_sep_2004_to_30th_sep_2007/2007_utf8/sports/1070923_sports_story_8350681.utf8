 Jadeja: I like Dhonis look as captain

Kochi: Praising Mahendra Singh Dhoni for his leadership abilities, former India star Ajay Jadeja said captaincy should not be looked as a pressure job, but as an opportunity. 

I like the look of him (Dhoni). He seems to be enjoying it and is looking at it as a great job, Jadeja said. 

Jadeja said the current Indian side was a good unit. The bench strength should be there. 

On the Indian Cricket League, Jadeja said it was a good move, which would bring in more competition. 

The ICL has made many promises and there is need to wait and see how they perform. More people in the field makes it more competitive, he said. 

Jadeja, who was in Kochi to inaugurate the ticket sales for the second one-dayer between India and Australia to be played at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium on October 2, was all praise for mediumpacer Sreesanth. 

Everbody is looking at his aggression and saying he should be controlled. But that is his strength, he said.

 We want to enjoy ourselves: Whatmore

 Dav Whatmore

St Johns: Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore is dreaming of a golden future for his young side who edged out India for a place in the World Cup Super Eight. 

Bangladesh have made the second round for the first time and will face Australia, Whatmores own country, here on Saturday. Its terrific, said Whatmore of his team, whose average age is just 22. 

Weve got a couple of more experienced players, but the vast majority of them are under 25, which is absolutely perfect for an emerging team like us. 

They now have an absolutely wonderful opportunity to play against seven of the worlds best sides and they will grow enormously because of that experience. 

I understand that we are still ranked No. 9 in the world and have a long way to go before we are consistently challenging the big boys. But weve got the resources and talent to really progress and we will be going to the Super Eight to really enjoy ourselves. From a personal point of view, its great to be in a position where your team is playing well and your methods are being validated. 

Whatmore is no stranger to World Cup sensations, having been at the helm when Sri Lanka won the title in 1996. 

Bangladesh made the second round with a win over India and a nervy seven-wicket victory over Bermuda achieved in the semi-gloom of the Queens Park Oval on Sunday. 

I thought the game (against Bermuda) was an extremely difficult one and the boys did brilliantly to keep their focus, said Whatmore.

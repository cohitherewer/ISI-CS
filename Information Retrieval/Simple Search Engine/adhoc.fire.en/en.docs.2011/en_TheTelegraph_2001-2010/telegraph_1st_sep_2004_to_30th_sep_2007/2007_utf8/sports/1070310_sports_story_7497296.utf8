 East take on North today

Mumbai: Having gone out of the title hunt with an agonising defeat in the previous match, North Zone will look to end their campaign on a winning note when they take on East, in the Deodhar Trophy limited overs cricket tournament here on Saturday. 

With West Zone (14 pts) already assured of the title after Norths defeat to South in a low-scoring encounter on Thursday, the remaining matches are reduced to fight for the second place. 

Central, led by Mohammed Kaif, who have finished all their matches, are currently placed second with eight points while North (four) and South (four) will also be vying for the runners-up spot. 

On the other hand, East, who have two points, will try to move away from the bottom. 

West Zone, who have been assured of the title for the first time since 1990-91 when they won under Ravi Shastri are pitted against South in the tournaments last match scheduled for Sunday.

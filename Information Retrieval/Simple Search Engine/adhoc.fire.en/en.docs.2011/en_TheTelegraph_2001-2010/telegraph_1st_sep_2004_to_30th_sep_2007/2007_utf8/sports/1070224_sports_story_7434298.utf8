 More power for TV umpire 

Mumbai: The television umpire can indicate a batsman is not out if the replays show there was no contact between bat and ball when an appeal for caught behind is referred to him under the rules and regulations adopted for the upcoming World Cup. 

Among other interesting regulations for the March 13-April 28 event in the West Indies is the provision for moving the matches in case of a dangerous pitch. To continue a match even under a drizzle in certain situations, bowl-outs to break a tie in semi-finals and final, and vesting the Match Referee with powers to suggest suspension of play citing security concerns. 

The relevant portion about the clause over clean catches states: The third umpire has to determine whether the batsman has been caught. However, when reviewing TV replay(s) if it is clear to the third umpire that the batsman did not hit the ball, he shall indicate that the batsman is not out. 

So far, the third umpire has been called in only to indicate if the catch had been taken cleanly. 

The ICC has introduced a five-stage system to break a tie on points between two or more teams in the preliminary and Super 8 stages, and a two-stage system for the semi-finals and final, including bowl-outs.

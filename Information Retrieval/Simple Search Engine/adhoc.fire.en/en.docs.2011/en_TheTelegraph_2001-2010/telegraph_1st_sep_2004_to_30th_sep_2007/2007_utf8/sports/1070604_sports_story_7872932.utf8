 Prasad wants transparent rotation policy

New Delhi: Former India pace bowler Venkatesh Prasad believes injuries cannot be prevented and a transparent rotation policy is the best way to guard against player burnout. 

Prasad, who was Team Indias bowling coach during the recent tour of Bangladesh, said there couldnt be a watertight policy on injury management. Keeping the player well informed of the reasons behind selection decisions is key to the issue, he felt. 

I would not stick to one particular way, Prasad said from Mysore, where he will be helping the bowlers at the fitness camp starting Monday. 

A lot depends on how one is feeling. If somebody (player) is really important and it isnt a highly competitive match, then he may be rested. 

But there has to be transparency, proper communication. The player must know why he is sitting out. He should have the positive emotion to come back and do well in the next outing. 

Prasad, who bagged 96 wickets in 33 Tests and claimed 196 scalps in 161 one-day Internationals, said a specialised coach had become a basic requirement. 

In a players career, particularly a fast bowlers, you cannot prevent injuries. No matter how smooth an action you have and how fit you are, you go through injuries, the 37-year-old Bangalorean said. 

When a fast bowler lands on his back foot, the momentum created by the run-up and the jump before landing makes him bring down 10 times his body weight. Imagine doing that time and again! 

So we need to manage the bowlers correctly. We have to monitor the amount of physical fitness and the amount of bowling at the nets he does. 

It is the coachs job to keep the bowlers fresh. And this is where I think a specialised coach can be handy.

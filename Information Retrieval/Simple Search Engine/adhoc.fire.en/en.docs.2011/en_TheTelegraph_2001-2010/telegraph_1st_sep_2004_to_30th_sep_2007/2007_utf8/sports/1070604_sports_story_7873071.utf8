 Foreign coach ideal for India, Pakistan: Akram 

Lahore: Bowling legend Wasim Akram on Sunday recommended foreign coaches for both Pakistan and India, saying their players felt at ease with overseas experts. 

I think the culture in Pakistan and India is such that the players feel at ease with a foreign coach. So I feel a foreigner can help them in a better way, Akram, a former Pakistan captain, said. 

Australians Steve Rixon and Dav Whatmore would suit Pakistan and India respectively, the one-time left-arm paceman said. 

Both countries are looking for new coaches after failed campaigns in the World Cup. 

Whatmore is the front-runner in India, but Pakistan are looking at various possibilities, including Rixon, Leicestershire county coach Tim Boon and Australian Geoff Lawson. Pakistan also approached Whatmore. 

Akram praised Rixon, saying an Australian can bring much-needed aggression to the side. 

Rixon can guide this young Pakistan side well because he has the experience of taking forward a young New Zealand side and groomed Stephen Fleming, Akram said of the Australian, who coached New Zealand from 1996 to 1999. 

I have played with Boon but know little about him as coach, he added. 

According to Akram, a foreign coach needs to have adequate support, including direct contact with the top men running cricket affairs, or else people in between can create problems. 

Woolmer, who became Pakistan coach in June 2004 and whose death during the World Cup is still under investigation, was affected by such problems, felt Akram. 

Woolmer did some good things for Pakistan cricket. 

He used to experiment and introduced new things, but a lot of problems were created for him also, the Pakistani great said. 

Talking about Greg Chappells failure as India coach, Akram said: It is not necessary that a great player can prove a good coach and Chappells main weakness was that he did not remain positive and was not fully behind Indian captain Rahul Dravid. Whatmore should overcome this. (AFP)

 King 

 has it easy 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Trainer S. Ganapathys prized 

 youngster Bourbon King lived up to his brilliant form and 

 carried his short odds to an easy victory in the 1,600m 

 Colts Trial Stakes, the star attraction at the Bangalore 

 races on Sunday. B.Prakash partnered the three-year-old 

 horse by Diffident out of Queen Ann to a three-length-plus 

 victory over a less fancied runner, Royal Ambassador.

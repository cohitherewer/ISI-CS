The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Court sirens call the shots in the glamour game 

 - The sport isnt about automatons who spend their days thinking only about tennis 

MARK HODGKINSON 

Apart from Tatiana Golovin and her red knickers, the women have been wearing a uniform of predominantly white clothing at Wimbledon. But the Frenchwoman is not the only one with a bit of flair and personality in the womens game. A collection of striking photographs demonstrates that the sport is not filled with automatons who spend their days thinking only about tennis, tennis and more tennis. 

There is a reason why Ana Ivanovic did a photo-shoot wearing a dress in a swimming pool. Ivanovic, the runner-up at the French Open and the world No. 6 on the Sony Ericsson WTA Tour, learnt to play tennis on a court marked out in an emptied pool. 

Apparently, she always had to hit down the lines, as any attempt to run down a cross-court shot would lead to a collision with the walls of the pool. 

It was impossible to play, the 19-year-old said. But thats where I grew up practising and its where people still practise. 

Jelena Jankovic, another Serbian and the world No. 3, posed next to studio lights as she aspires to become a screen actress once she is finished with her tennis career. Jankovic would probably just smile and grin all the way through any film role. I was even offered a role in a movie in Serbia once, she said. 

Frenchwoman Severine Bremond was photographed with a grand piano, as she once harboured dreams of becoming a concert pianist. 

I wish I could sing and play the piano, but I only ever sing in the shower, Bremond said. A close friend of hers on the tour, Frances Camille Pin, disclosed that, between tournaments, she spends her time scuba-diving. 

Jie Zheng was the first Chinese woman to win a Grand Slam title, while Maria Kirilenko could have become a ballet dancer rather than a tennis player. 

The Russians mother sent her to ballet school when she was five. She wanted me to move around a bit more because I was fat, said Kirilenko. 

How things have changed. She is now employed as a model for a range of tennis clothes designed by Stella McCartney, the daughter of former Beatle Paul. Its nice to look good, but first and foremost I concentrate on my game.

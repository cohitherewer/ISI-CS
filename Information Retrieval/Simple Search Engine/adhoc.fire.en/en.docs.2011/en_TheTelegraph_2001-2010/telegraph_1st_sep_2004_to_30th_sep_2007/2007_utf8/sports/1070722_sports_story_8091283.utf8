 Team Indias jugular is in Englands hands

 - LORDS TEST

 - Swing is visitors undoing

London: Indias jugular is in Englands hands and only something out of the ordinary will ensure that Rahul Dravid and Co. dont take to the second npower Test, in Trent Bridge, 0-1 down. 

The weather could, of course, come to Indias rescue at Lords. However, relying on external elements for succour is risk-laden. 

At stumps on Day III, on a wicket with much for the new-ball bowlers and batsmen (those with character, that is), England had reached 77 for two, extending their lead to a massive 174. 

Despite an exceptionally late finish, no more than 221 minutes and 47.2 overs were possible on another rain-marred day, but England did well to play out the last 35 minutes. 

Thats when captain Michael Vaughan and Kevin Pietersen had everything to lose (resuming on 54 for two), but Zaheer Khan and Sreesanth were denied. Its one period which could influence the outcome in a big way. 

Earlier, the Indian batsmen just couldnt cope with the swinging ball. Its an old failing, but has come to assume embarrassing proportions. 

Such displays encourage the Ricky Pontings to talk about the Indians being poor travellers. 

Much was expected from specialists Sourav Ganguly and V.V.S. Laxman, but neither scripted anything of significance. The former captain did total 34, but only nine got added to his overnight score. 

Sourav wasnt tempted by the ones from James Anderson which left him, but was found wanting when one came in. As for Laxman, he fell to the very impressive Ryan Sidebottom. 

Anderson returned career-best figures (five for 42) and showed, yet again, that hes there to be counted. When fit, though, for he has already had a stress fracture of the back. 

The conditions were helpful for the bowlers... They were challenging... The Indians couldnt handle the movement, former England captain Graham Gooch told The Telegraph. 

Gooch, who smashed India for a triple hundred in the 1990 Test at Lords, added: Actually, our inexperienced pace attack did better than what the experienced guys had done in recent times... 

Of the specialists, Anderson is playing his 17th Test, while its Sidebottoms fifth. Chris Tremlett is a debutant. 

Clearly enjoying the responsibility of being the lead bowler, Anderson said Souravs had been the key wicket and that there were plans for all the Indian batters. 

Anderson, who turns 25 later this month, also made the point that regularly interacting with iconic bowling consultant Allan Donald was beneficial. 

Like a good team man, he praised Sidebottom and the debutant.

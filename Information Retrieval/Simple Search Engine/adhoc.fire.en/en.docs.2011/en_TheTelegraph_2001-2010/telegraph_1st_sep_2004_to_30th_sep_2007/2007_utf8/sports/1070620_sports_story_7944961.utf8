 India to take on Guam 

Mumbai: The Indian rugby team is to take on Guam in a battle between two low-ranked outfits in the world at the Bombay Gymkhana here on June 23. 

The match, which is part of a triangular series held for lower-rated squads to improve their rankings also features Philippines. 

Pramod Khanna, president of the Indian Rugby Football union, said that they have roped in English coach David Wiggins for this tie and the next clash in Manila against Philippines on July 1.

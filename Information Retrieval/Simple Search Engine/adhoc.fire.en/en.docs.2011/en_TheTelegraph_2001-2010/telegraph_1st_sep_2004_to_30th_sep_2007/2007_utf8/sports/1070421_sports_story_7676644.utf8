 No logic in persisting with Sehwag

Guest Column

Logic is a peculiar way of justifying things. When it comes to selecting the Indian squad, it turns out to be something going wrong with conviction. The bizarre thoughts behind picking the ODI and Test squads for the tour of Bangladesh could be an example in this respect. 

We have all been talking about youth policy since the World Cup debacle, but one wonders how green the squads actually are. Only Manoj Tewari (for ODIs) and Rajesh Pawar (for Tests) are the new faces and the rest are the same old ones, who have been coming in and going out in the recent past. 

I have no objection if the selectors have decided to rest Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly from the ODIs. In fact, they deserve it. But when it comes to accepting form and domestic performance, the selection defies logic. 

Why the need to persist with Virender Sehwag? He may be given a chance in the Test series, but in no way does he come into the ODI picture. Well, if you want to keep faith in Sehwag, why wont the same logic be applied to Irfan Pathan? He may be out of form, but hes young and should be encouraged and not rejected like this. 

Dinesh Mongias inclusion in the ODI side is another bizarre move. He is not a youngster and when the focus is on youth, selectors should have looked elsewhere. As far as the bowling is concerned, Im surprised to see no place for Yomahesh. It has the same old look, which has been tried out in the recent past without much success. 

Coming over to the Test side, nothing can be more illogical than excluding Ranadeb Bose. How many wickets does he need to get in a season before making the national cut? Im sorry to say I dont have any answer to this. You can recall the old VRV Singh, yet dont give the new Ranadeb a chance. Why this talk of youth policy then? 

I saw him during the Ranji Trophy match against Gujarat at the Eden and I was quite impressed. I have no doubt that he should have been in both squads. Ignoring Ranadeb may send a wrong message to youngsters who rely on domestic performances to make the national cut. 

In my opinion, the absence of Murali Kartik is shocking too. Its fine to give Rajesh international exposure. But Murali has been a consistent performer. 

My best wishes to Tewari and Pawar. What, however, seems odd to me is that Tewari has performed better in the longer version of the game, yet he hasnt found a place in the Test squad. So, this is the young nucleus we have now: just two newcomers and those familiar faces, who are on a sort of comeback trail. 

Its better to groom the likes of Uthappa, Pathan and Tewari. Give them the chance to flourish as well as the assurance that they wont be thrown out even after a few failures. Im sure these boys can brighten the face of our future if backed properly.

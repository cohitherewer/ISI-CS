 Henman has played to potential: Former coach

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Henman

Chennai: He is credited with producing a homegrown British tennis champion after aeons, one who came within realistic distance of winning the Wimbledon mens championship. He was also entrusted with the responsibility of carrying British tennis a further step forward, only to be dismissed after three years on the job. 

Meet David Felgate, the man who coached Tim Henman for nine years and guided him to seven Tour titles and two Wimbledon semi-finals. Sacked as Performance Director of the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) last year, Felgate is presently travelling with Xavier Malisse. 

I think British tennis took some strides forward during my time with the LTA, but in three years there was only this much you could do... A couple of more years would have been better, but the powers-that-be wanted a change and it was their prerogative, said the 42-year-old who is in Chennai with his Belgian ward. 

According to Felgate, Henman has played to his full potential. When he lost in the first round of junior Wimbledon, nobody believed that he would some day be in the top-10. Tim really came through the hard way, worked his way up and maintained a high level for a long time once he reached there, said Felgate who parted ways with Henman in 2001. 

A semi-finalist at Wimbledon in 1998, 1999, 2001 and 2002, Henman somehow failed to find that extra zing to cross those two final barriers. 

People keep talking about this, but they dont care to look at the players who Tim lost to. In 98 and 99 it was Pete Sampras, then Goran Ivanisevic and then Lleyton Hewitt. All those guys went on to win the championship. 

There are no ifs and buts in sport, but may be Tim would have won or at least made the final with some luck. But as his coach, I have no regrets. 

Can Andy Murray take those two missing steps and fulfil Britains Wimbledon dream, as the likes of Bjorn Borg and Ivanisevic have predicted? 

Hes got a very good coach (Brad Gilbert)... Having said that, the journey from where you are to the top-10 or even higher is never easy, you have to cross several obstacles. Andys done well so far, but hes got some way to go. I dont want to make any predictions about his winning Wimbledon and becoming No. 1, Felgate observed.

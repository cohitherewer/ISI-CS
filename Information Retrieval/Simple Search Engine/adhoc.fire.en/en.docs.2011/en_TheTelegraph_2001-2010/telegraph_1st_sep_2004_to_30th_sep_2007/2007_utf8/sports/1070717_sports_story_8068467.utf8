 Pathan blames busy calendar 

New Delhi: Irfan Pathan has blamed a packed international calendar for not being able to rectify his bowling problems, which he detected during last years tour of Pakistan. 

Pathan, who has been out of Team India for a few months now, disclosed that he had drawn attention of then-coach Greg Chappell and his assistant Ian Frazer, but could not work on it in the middle of the season. 

I showed the video (of my bowling) to Greg and Frazer in Pakistan. By the time I realised it, those little problems got complicated and became a bit complex. Also, I didnt get much time to be mentally fresh during that period, Pathan said. 

However, its only a temporary phase and I am confident of being top of the game again, Pathan told a television channel. (PTI)

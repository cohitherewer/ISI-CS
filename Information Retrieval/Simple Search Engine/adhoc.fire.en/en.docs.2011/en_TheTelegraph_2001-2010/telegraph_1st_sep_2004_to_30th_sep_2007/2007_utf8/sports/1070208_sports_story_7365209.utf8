The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Focus entirely on Eden now, says Mahela

A STAFF REPORTER

 Sanath Jayasuriya has a chat with Tom Moody at the Eden on Wednesday 

Calcutta: Sri Lanka did get royally beaten (1-6) in the ODI series the last time they toured India. But, as Mahela Jayawardene reminded newsmen for the umpteenth time, much has happened since then, including a 5-0 ODI blanking of England in England last year. 

A lot of things have changed since that ODI series (in India). Weve played about 30 one-dayers since then, and got a few things correct. The team has also grown in stature, the Lankan captain said on Wednesday, the eve of the four-match series which begins at the Eden. 

Our focus right now is on the India series on the Eden Gardens. 

With India and Sri Lanka finding themselves in group B of the World Cup, this series has a special significance as both teams would be keen to snatch the psychological edge ahead of next months mega event. 

It will be great if we can beat the Indians in their den and carry some momentum to the World Cup, said the Lankan captain. 

He informed newsmen that all players are 100 per cent fit, but refused to reveal the playing XI. 

According to Jayawardene, leading a side which has several senior players like Maravan Atapattu, Sanath Jayasuriya, Kumar Sangakkara and Muttiah Muralidharan is not a tough task. 

 In fact, leading an experienced side has made my job easier. They know their job and I get to learn a lot from them, the 29-year-old. 

The absence of key players like Muralidharan and Chaminda Vaas, who have been given a rest ahead of the World Cup, will give others a chance to prove themselves, said coach Tom Moody. It is important not to take just a strong XI, but a strong XV to the World Cup, the coach remarked. 

Asked about his future with the Lankan team now that Tim Nielsen has been named to succeed John Buchanan, Moody said: Im not making any plans for my future at this stage my main focus is the World Cup now. 

Moodys name did make the rounds as a possible Buchanan successor.

Ludhiana: JCT outplayed Banglores Hindustan Aeronautics Sports Club (HASC) 3-0 in a penultimate round match of the 11th ONGC Cup National Football League match at Guru Nanak Stadium here on Saturday evening. 

The victory propelled the hosts to the second position with 28 points. The first goal was scored in the opening minute by Sunil Chhetri while Edeh Chidi and substitute Parveen Kumar scored one goal each for the Punjab outfit. 

Meanwhile, on Sunday, Dempo Sports Club will strive hard to seal the title with a victory over Air India at the Cooperage Ground in Mumbai.

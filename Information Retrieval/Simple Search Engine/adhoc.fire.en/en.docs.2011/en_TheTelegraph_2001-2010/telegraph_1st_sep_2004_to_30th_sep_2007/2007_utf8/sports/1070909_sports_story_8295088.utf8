 Shoaib blames Afridi

Karachi: Controversial fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar, who was ousted from the Pakistan squad for the ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa after being involved in a brawl with teammate Mohammed Asif, on Saturday blamed Shahid Afridi for the incident. 

Afridi said things about my family which I could not tolerate. He made comments which cannot be called jokes, Shoaib told reporters in Lahore. 

The temperamental pacer, who was sent back after hitting Asif with a bat, said he immediately apologised to his fellow pacer. 

After the incident I went to Asifs room and apologised. He is fine now and will play in the championship next week, Shoaib said. 

Let me make it very clear, I did not hit him intentionally. I am not an idiot to hit someone with a bat just like that. It was something which happened between Asif and me and we had sorted everything out. But once the reports started coming in media, the PCB had to take some action, he added. 

The Rawalpindi Express said he was ready to face any disciplinary step that the PCB may take against him. 

I respect the PCBs decision to send me back, he said. 

Shoaib came down on the media for sensationalising the incident and said he had been made to look like a villain. 

The matter was blown out of proportion. This was actually a misunderstanding. The media has contributed to the whole controversy. I have been made a villain, he said. 

There is a lobby which has always been trying to malign me by selling negative news about me. I request you all to stop doing that. Stop spreading false propaganda against me Stop selling my name in the name of news, Shoaib said. 

Recalling the incident, Shoaib said he was called by the team management to explain his actions before being sent home. He claimed that the PCB had been supportive so far. 

The board has supported me throughout. I have been backed by board president Dr Nasim Ashraf. He supported me during the doping scandal and he is backing me in this case too, he said. 

The fast bowler said he regretted the incident all the more as it had denied him the chance to open the attack with Asif. 

It hurts that we would not be able to bowl together. I had put in a lot of hard work for this and to miss out is certainly painful. 

Meanwhile, the PCB has denied reports that Shoaib had misbehaved with three Pakistani women in Nairobi last week.

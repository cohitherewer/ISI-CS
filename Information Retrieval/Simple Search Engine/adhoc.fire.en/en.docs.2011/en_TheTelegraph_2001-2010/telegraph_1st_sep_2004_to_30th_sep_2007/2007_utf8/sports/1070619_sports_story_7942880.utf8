 Beckham: Ill remember the great things

Madrid: David Beckham and Roberto Carlos were given a victorious send-off from the Bernabeu when they made their final appearances for Real Madrid as the team grabbed the league title with a 3-1 comeback win over Real Mallorca. 

Former England captain Beckham was given a massive cheer by the 76,000 fans crammed into the stadium on Sunday when he limped off the pitch with his side down 0-1 midway through the second half. Im so happy, its incredible and great to have all the family here, Beckham said. 

It has been an incredible experience, but all Ill remember now are the great things and the good things because winning this puts to bed everything else, Beckham said. 

Beckham played 157 games for Real but his only previous trophy was the Spanish Super Cup which he won when they beat Mallorca shortly after he signed for the club from Manchester United in 2003. 

It has been possibly the toughest season of my career on and off the field. Ive gone through things that I never thought were possible, said Beckham, who was dropped from the Madrid line-up in January after signing a contract with the Los Angeles Galaxy. 

With Beckhams value at his highest since his days at Old Trafford, Madrid will regret failing to get him to sign a contract extension. 

Roberto Carlos ended 11 years at the Bernabeu with more than 500 games under his belt, four league titles and three European Cups. You have to enjoy a moment like this, but I think Ill be crying later when I speak to my family, said the 34-year-old who has signed a two-year deal with Turkish side Fenerbahce. (AGENCIES)

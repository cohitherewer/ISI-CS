 Inzamam is keen to prolong Test career

 Inzamam-ul Haq 

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq is targeting a stint in English league cricket and domestic matches in the coming months in a bid to prolong his Test career. Amid reports that he will be dropped for the home series against South Africa, Inzamam said that his agent was negotiating with clubs in England. 

South Africa will tour Pakistan from September 25 to play a Test series while we tour India for three Tests in November. Then the Australians are also coming to Pakistan early next year. I am keen to play in the Test team in these matches as they are all against good sides, Inzamam said. 

The 37-year-old batsman, who announced his retirement from one-day Internationals and stepped down from the captaincy after Pakistan were eliminated early from the World Cup, said he had every intention to continue playing Tests. 

I have retired from one-dayers because it is better if the selectors gave a younger player a chance to establish himself. But I still enjoy playing cricket and Test matches are a real challenge, he said. 

Inzamam said obviously he would try to prove his fitness and form by playing in league and domestic cricket. 

A PCB official, however, said it had almost been decided in principle not to retain Inzamam in the Test squad for the September-October series. The PCB thinktank is more or less convinced that Inzamam should not be a part of Pakistans Test squad, he was quoted as saying in a Pakistan daily. (PTI)

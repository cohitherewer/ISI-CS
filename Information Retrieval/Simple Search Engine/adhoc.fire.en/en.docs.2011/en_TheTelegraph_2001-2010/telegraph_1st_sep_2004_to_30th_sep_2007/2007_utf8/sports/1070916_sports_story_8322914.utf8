London: Arsenal continued their domination over north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday, winning 3-1 to surge top of the Premier League. 

Emmanuel Adebayor scored twice for the slick Gunners either side of a stunning effort from Cesc Fabregas after Gareth Bale had raised Tottenham hopes of a first victory over their arch-rivals since 1999. 

Liverpool slipped to second after drawing 0-0 at Portsmouth for whom Nwankwo Kanu had a penalty saved, while Manchester United moved into the top four for the first time this season with a scrappy 1-0 victory at Everton. 

Arsenal have 13 points from five games, two more than Liverpool and Manchester United. Chelsea could also go to 13 if they win at home to Blackburn Rovers in a late kick-off. 

Elsewhere, West Ham Uniteds bright start continued with a 3-0 home defeat of Middlesbrough, Sunderland ended a run of three league defeats with a 2-1 win over Reading and Bolton Wanderers stay in trouble after losing 0-1 at Birmingham City. 

United claimed their third consecutive 1-0 victory when Nemanja Vidic met Nanis corner seven minutes from the end of a forgettable match at Goodison Park.

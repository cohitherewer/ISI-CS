 Akram: Mate, you deserve it 

 Wasim Akram 

Georgetown: Wasim Akram on Sunday hailed Australian paceman Glenn McGraths feat of breaking his World Cup record of most wickets, saying he wanted to congratulate his all-time favourite. 

I just want to pass on my best wishes and say: Mate, you deserve all the records that cricket offers. I am glad that a bowler of McGraths calibre has broken my record, Akram said over telephone from Singapore. 

McGrath overhauled Akrams World Cup record of 55 during his three for 16 in Australias 10-wicket thrashing of Bangladesh on Saturday. 

Akram said: I consider McGrath and Malcolm Marshall as two of the all-time greats. McGrath is the complete bowler physically and mentally. 

The way he executes his plans is great. You become his fan once you see him bowl and I have had the privilege of playing alongside this great man. 

Akram added that players like McGrath make the Australias world beaters. Australia look miles ahead of other teams simply because they have players of McGraths calibre and, as far as Im concerned, it will take a huge effort from other teams to stop them from running away with their third World Cup title. 

Akram said Pakistan and India had both disappointed him in the current tournament. 

Both Pakistan and India played badly which led to their downfall. They need to lift themselves and both have the talent to do that, he said. 

What the PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf needs to do is to have wise advisers like Imran Khan and appoint the best possible coach, like Waqar Younis or Aaqib Javed, suggested Akram, while ruling himself out as coach. 

Coaching is a specialised field and I dont think my busy schedule on television will allow me do that. But I am ready to help the youngsters in bowling. (AFP)

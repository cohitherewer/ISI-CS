 East meet Central

Mumbai: Central Zone take on East Zone in a Deodhar Trophy League clash at the Wankhede Stadium here Wednesday with both the teams already out of the title race. Central and East have three points each. 

The table is led by West with 14 points to their credit with one match in hand, against bottom-placed South on Sunday, and they are well-poised to clinch the crown for the eighth time. (PTI)

 Early exit for Federer

Rome: World No. 1 Roger Federers dreams of winning his first Rome Masters title ended when he slumped to a 2-6, 4-6 defeat against Italian wild card Filippo Volandri in a last 16 match on Thursday. 

Third seed Andy Roddick also fell, losing 0-6, 4-6 to Argentine Juan Ignacio Chela. Fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko progressed with a 4-6, 6-2, 7-5 win over Potito Starace. 

Federer never found his rhythm against Volandri, dropping serve thrice on the way to surrendering the first set.

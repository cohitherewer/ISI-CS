The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Air India upset EB

 - National League Sporting lose to Churchill 

 Pereiras woes continue 

Mumbai: Substitutes Uttam Singh and Samson Singh conjured up a bit of magic against the run of play to power Air India to a shock 1-0 victory over former champions East Bengal in their opening ONGC National Football League clash at the Cooperage on Sunday. 

Uttam effected a deep throw-in from the right into the box for A K Martins to head the ball near Samson, who booted home the low volley just inside the left post past East Bengal goalkeeper Naseem Akhtar in the 70th minute of the match. 

The sucker punch galvanised the Calcutta giants into trying to secure the equaliser. But the Mumbai airmen, who had finished seventh in the last edition, soaked up the pressure nicely to come out triumphant. 

East Bengal have only themselves to blame as they came close to scoring on a few occasions in the opening half but poor marksmanship cost them dear. 

Their best chance came in the opening half when Boniface Ambani took a shot at goal that was blocked by Nepoleon Singh. The rebound effort by Izumi Arata was wide of the mark with only Air India custodian Raju Ekka to beat. 

East Bengal, who finished runners-up to Mumbais Mahindra United last season but later won the Super Cup, made a few substitutions in the latter half but could not breach the Air India defence. 

Sashti Duleys 25-yard right-footed volley was fisted round the left post just in time by Ekka in the 65th minute. To add to East Bengals woes substitute Fredy Mascarenhas got booked by referee P K Bose for a foul on Martins. Alex Ambrose, for whom Samson came on as substitute, was also shown the yellow card. 

In Duler, Odafa Okonji scored a brace to guide Churchill Brothers to a 2-0 win over Sporting Clube de Goa in their opening encounter. 

Churchill, who enjoyed a lion share of the exchanges and scoring chances, took the lead at the half-hour mark when Genius Zenith from the right relayed the ball to Nigerian George Ekeh whose brilliant shot was connected by his Okonji. 

After the change of ends, Ekeh and Okanji, who gave a torrid time to Sportings defence, increased the lead in the 61st minute with the latter again finding the net when he beat defender Mathew to slot the ball home off a pass by Ekeh. 

On Monday, holders Mahindra United take on Dempo Sports Club of Goa.

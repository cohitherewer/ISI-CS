 Eriksson in City on 3-yr contract

Times Online

Sven-Goran Eriksson has been announced as the new manager of Manchester City on a three-year contract. The former England coach returns to management almost 12 months after parting company with England following the 2006 World Cup. 

He has accepted an offer from Manchester City despite reported interest from a Spanish club. City have already made an approach to the man that Eriksson wants as his assistant, Roland Andersson, the assistant coach of the Sweden national team. 

An announcement was expected on Monday itself, regarding Erikssons appointment, but it didnt materialise as the 59-year-old mulled over the offer from Thaksin Shinawatra, Citys new majority shareholder. 

Andersson, whom Eriksson hired as a scout for England before Euro 2004, admitted that he has been approached about the assistant managers job. 

I talked to Sven last week and he said hed had an offer from Manchester City that he was thinking about and that he was interested in working with me, Andersson, 57, said. 

The possibility of Erikssons appointment had provoked mirth among some and disapproval among others. Neil Warnock, the former Sheffield United manager, suggested that he could do better than him, but City have reported a rise in season ticket sales since Thaksin secured a 55.9 per cent stake in the club on Thursday. 

That may have more to do with the pledge to invest 50 million on players than on Erikssons possible arrival. But the club is optimistic that he will attract exciting names to a squad in need of reinforcement. 

Thaksin offered Eriksson a package worth 2.5 million a year, including bonuses about half what he earned with England.

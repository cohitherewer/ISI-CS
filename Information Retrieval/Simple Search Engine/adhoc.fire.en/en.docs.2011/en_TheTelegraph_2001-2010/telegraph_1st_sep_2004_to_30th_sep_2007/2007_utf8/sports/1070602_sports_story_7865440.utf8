The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 ICC panel suggests a free hit for no ball

A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: 

 The International Cricket Councils newly-constituted 

 Cricket Committee concluded its two-day meeting in Dubai 

 on Thursday evening.

 According to an ICC release, a 

 no-ball in one-day cricket for overstepping the crease could 

 prove costly to bowlers in future after the committee recommended 

 giving the batsman a free hit off the next delivery.

 The rule is among several changes 

 to the one-day game suggested by the committee, which was 

 chaired by former India captain Sunil Gavaskar.

 The recommendations will have 

 to be approved by the ICCs Chief Executives 

 Committee (CEC) and then ratified by its board to become 

 law. The panels are due to meet during the ICCs annual 

 conference starting in London on June 24.

 The following were among the issues 

 covered by the committee:

 Ball tampering 

 The committee was asked by the 

 ICC board to review the Law as it relates to ball tampering. 

 This followed the events at the Oval Test in August when 

 the umpires awarded the match to England on the grounds 

 of Pakistans refusal to play after they were accused 

 of ball tampering. 

 The committee recommended that: 

 Clause 42.1 of the Standard Playing Conditions is amended 

 to clarify that when an incident of ball tampering is reported 

 to the ICC Match Referee, action shall be taken under the 

 ICC Code of Conduct as appropriate against the person/s 

 responsible for the conduct. 

 The definition of ball tampering as contained in the Laws 

 remains unchanged. 

 The guideline to the offence CC 2.9 of the Code of Conduct 

 is amended to the following:

 Any action/s likely to alter the 

 condition of the ball, which are not specifically permitted 

 under Law 42.3 (a), may be regarded as unfair. 

 The following actions shall not be permitted (this list 

 of actions is not exhaustive but included for illustrative 

 purposes): 

 Deliberately throwing the ball onto the ground for purposes 

 of roughing it up 

 Applying any artificial substance to the ball; and applying 

 any non-artificial substance for any purpose other than 

 to polish the ball 

 Lifting or otherwise interfering with any of the seams of 

 the ball 

 Scratching the surface of the ball with finger or thumb 

 nails or any implement 

 The umpires shall use their judgement 

 to apply the principle that actions taken to maintain or 

 enhance the condition of the ball, provided no artificial 

 substances are used, shall be permitted. Any actions taken 

 with the purpose of damaging the condition of the ball or 

 accelerating the deterioration of the condition of the ball 

 shall not be permitted. 

 ODI playing conditions

 The committee made the following 

 recommendations: 

 The use of power-plays should continue although it resolved 

 that an additional fielder (making three in total instead 

 of the current limit of two) should be allowed outside the 

 30-yard circle during the second or third power-play 

 That the idea of the captain of the batting side being able 

 to choose when to take one of the power-plays be tried out 

 in Australia and by any other Member who wishes to do so 

 The current required over-rate of 14.28 overs per hour be 

 continued but with a concerted effort by all parties to 

 maintain and improve over-rates wherever possible: umpires 

 should be empowered to impose time-wasting penalties as 

 allowed for under the Law if a new batsman is not ready 

 to face his first delivery within two minutes of the fall 

 of the previous wicket 

 If the last wicket in the first innings of a match falls 

 within 30 minutes of the scheduled interval then the interval 

 should be taken immediately with the second innings then 

 starting correspondingly earlier (thus removing the possibility 

 of a break of up to 75 minutes) 

 If up to 60 minutes is lost during the scheduled first innings 

 then there is no reduction in the interval; if more than 

 60 minutes is lost then the interval can be reduced to 30 

 minutes; and the minimum interval should be 20 minutes 

 There should be a mandatory change of ball after 35 overs 

 A free hit should be introduced for the delivery that follows 

 a front-foot no-ball

 On grounds where space allows, boundaries should be pushed 

 back to a maximum of 90 yards; square boundaries should 

 be a minimum of 150 yards from one side to the other with 

 a minimum of 65 yards on one side; straight boundaries should 

 be 140 yards from one side to the other 

 Glue on pitches

 The committee recommended that the use of adhesives in the 

 preparation of pitches for international matches should 

 be discontinued.

 Referrals to TV umpire

 The committee recommended the maintenance of the current 

 regulations, which allow umpires to consult TV officials 

 on the subject of clean catches only if both on-field umpires 

 have not seen it. 

 The committee also decided against recommending a trial 

 of the use of player appeals to the TV umpire at this years 

 ICC Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa. Instead, it suggested 

 that the system be tried out in as many countries as possible 

 (it is currently being used in one domestic competition 

 in the UK) so that further evidence on its effectiveness, 

 or otherwise, can be obtained. 

 International umpiring

 The committee recommended the setting up of a task force 

 with an independent chairman to look at how best to take 

 international umpiring to the next level. 

 The task forces remit would include deciding how best 

 to structure the International and Elite Panels; looking 

 at how support structures for umpires can be financed and 

 put in place; umpires remuneration; and whether or 

 not it is appropriate for umpires to be able to stand in 

 Tests and ICC events where their home country/Member is 

 involved. 

 Zimbabwe

 The committee did not support the return of Zimbabwe to 

 Test cricket until such time as the team demonstrates its 

 ability to perform at a standard that does not risk undermining 

 the integrity of Test cricket. 

 In order to be able to judge when Zimbabwes performance 

 merits a return to Test cricket, the committee felt the 

 team first needed to continue in its current practice of 

 playing a number of representative four-day matches. The 

 committee encouraged the scheduling of such matches against 

 ICC Full Member A teams and Associates with, for example, 

 the inclusion of Zimbabwe in the next ICC Intercontinental 

 Cup. 

 Volume of cricket

 The committee expressed concern about the congestion in 

 the international calendar and, in particular, the addition 

 of many ODIs which, it felt, may have a severe impact on 

 the quality, intensity and standard of international cricket 

 and may result in injuries to players and a dearth of fast 

 bowlers.

Pawar plan

 Baramati: BCCI president Sharad Pawar will seek the Speakers permission to stay away from Parliament if India were to make the semis or final. Parliament will be working on those days. The only way I will be able to watch them is if a colleague takes those questions for me, said Pawar, also a Union agriculture minister.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Highs and lows of Chappells tenure

April 2005: Team India captain Sourav Ganguly is in favour of former Australian great Greg Chappell as coach following John Wrights imminent departure. 

May 20: A committee comprising Sunil Gavaskar, Ravi Shastri and Srinivas Venkataraghavan chooses Chappell ahead of Tom Moody, Mohinder Amarnath and Desmond Haynes. Says Chappell, Ive landed the most exciting job in cricket A commitment to excellence has to be the force which propels. 

May 22: Chappell suggests that helping Sachin Tendulkar regain his form would be one of his priorities. 

Team India probables pre-season conditioning camp expected to start before mid-July. 

Incidentally, that camp will be the first supervised by the new coach and is going to be part of the build-up for the August 2-14 tri-series in Sri Lanka. 

June 2: The working committee ratifies Chappells appointment as coach. His annual remuneration will be in the region of Rs 80 lakh, about the same paid to Wright. Backing Chappells appointment as the coach, former Pakistan skipper Imran Khan feels Chappell can make a difference. 

June 4: Chappell suggests Dr Charles Krebs and biomechanist Ian Frazer as support staff for Team India. 

June 16: Chappell gets on to the job straightaway within hours of landing in Bangalore. He interacts with physio John Gloster and trainer Greg King during his one-hour session at the National Cricket Academy. 

Sourav receives a vote of confidence from the new coach. Says: From time to time, you will have players out of form. But may be a player who has been successful for a long time should get more opportunities than perhaps you would give someone else. 

July 5: Chappell supervises physical fitness and conditioning camp ahead of a triangular series in Sri Lanka. Sourav, Dinesh Mongia and Harbhajan Singh did not attend the camp as they were expected on July 13, while Irfan Pathan, playing for Middlesex in the English county, was expected on July 10. 

July 14: Sourav joins the camp and spends 15 minutes. Says Chappell: Given the amount of travelling Sourav has put in over the past couple of days, his body-clock was... He tried a few things and, in the circumstances, definitely did okay. Sourav assures full support to Chappell from all the players. 

August: First series as coach starts unpromisingly with India winning just two of the five matches in the tri-series in Sri Lanka 

September: The controversial Sourav-Chappell saga blows up. Sourav goes public with his dismay at Chappells suggestion that he steps down from the captaincy. A confidential e-mail from Chappell to the BCCI saying Sourav is no longer fit to lead the side is leaked to the media. 

November: Sans Sourav, India thrash Sri Lanka 6-1 and draw 2-2 against South Africa in one-day series at home. Television images captures Chappell making an obscene finger gesture to fans while boarding the team bus in Calcutta. This was during the India-South Africa ODI in the city. The fans were protesting at Sourav being dropped from the team. Chappell denies any wrongdoing. He is censured by the board. 

February 2006: His comments on Shoaib Akhtars bowling action later comes under the spotlight. There is something seriously different about it (Shoaibs action), he said. India win one-day series 4-1 but lose a three-match Test series 0-1 to Pakistan. 

March: Chappell tells a London-based newspaper that captaincy was utterly important to Souravs life and finances. It creates ripples in the media. Sharad Pawar, the president, announces that the BCCI wants to close the chapter on the controversial comments by Chappell on Sourav. Chappell admits during the meeting that it had been a mistake on his part to have suggested that. 

April: India notch up a record 17 consecutive one-day victories batting second; complete a 5-1 one-day series victory against England at home. 

May: The West Indies have forgotten how to win, says Chappell after Indias first ODI win in a five-match series. Ironically, the West Indies go on to win the series 4-1 and captain Brian Lara says Chappells sly remark actually spurred them on. 

July: However, later India clinch their first Test series win in the Caribbean in 35 years, beating the West Indies 1-0. 

October: India exit from the Champions Trophy after the group phase, losing to the West Indies and Australia. 

November: Selectors recall Sourav. 

December: Chappell in the wake of Souravs return to the Test side in South Africa reiterates that his face-off with Sourav was never a battle between two personalities but merely a cricketing issue that was blown out of proportion. I look at it as one of my success stories, he says. 

January 2007: Chappell is slapped on the back as complete chaos envelops the Indian teams arrival at Bhubaneshwar airport for the second ODI against the West Indies. It was allegedly done by activists of the Kalinga Kamgar Sena, a fringe political outfit in Orissa. 

February: India win back-to-back home one-day series against West Indies and Sri Lanka. Chappell says he wasnt surprised with Souravs remarkable comeback into the Indian team for the World Cup. He adds that the timing of his exclusion, when he was dropped in September 2005, had allowed Sourav to return in time for the World Cup. 

March 17: India suffer shock defeat against Bangladesh. After the first round elimination, Chappell appears in probably his most volatile press conference. In light of recent events, he said, referring to the Bob Woolmer murder, I am not going to be making any comments about whats wrong with anything or anybody Im answerable to the BCCI only. 

April 1: Speculation is rife about Chappells future. Chappell, it is reported, was unhappy with the behaviour of the seniors during the World Cup. The players, on the other hand, seem to be unhappy with Chappell for creating a sense of insecurity in the team. 

April 4: Quits as India coach. Cites family and personal reasons.

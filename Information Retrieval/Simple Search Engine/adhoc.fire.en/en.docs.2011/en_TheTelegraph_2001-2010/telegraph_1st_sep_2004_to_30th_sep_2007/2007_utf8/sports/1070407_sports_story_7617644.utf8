 Sachin should quit ODIs: Rameez

New Delhi: Rameez Raja believes Sachin Tendulkar should call it a day in one-day Internationals and concentrate on Test cricket. 

The former Pakistan captain says the Indian star has lost the fire power needed for playing the shorter version of the game. 

I would want to see him play regularly for India in Tests, maybe not so in one-day cricket. You need little more fire power in one-dayers and the youngsters can provide that, Rameez said. 

He said Tendulkar was past his pomp as could be seen from the fact that he had not played many match-winning knocks in ODIs, and as such, should focus more on Tests. 

Of late, his graph has been going down and though he is averaging around 50, he has not been winning matches for India for quite a few years. 

Tendulkar, however, still has the class to succeed in Tests, Rameez feels. 

You need bit of experience and class (in Test cricket) and certainly Sachin has that experience and class and maybe he will be of use to India in the longer version, he told a television channel. 

He also felt that Greg Chappell failed to spot the right talent and India never looked like a team in this World Cup. 

I think he could not spot the right talent to replace the old generation of cricketers. Whatever talent was on display in the World Cup was just not up to the mark. 

I also feel that his relationship with the players dwindled because of his methods. Im just speculating but maybe he was little too tough and maybe his dealing with some of the players was inappropriate. 

Meanwhile, Sachin has found an unexpected ally in Australian fast bowler Brett Lee. 

Sachin is great for the game. What he has achieved for India is absolutely amazing. I know a true champion like him will definitely turn it around, he said. 

When you play against great batsmen like Sachin and (Brian) Lara, they will play and miss for one or two balls and you think you are on top of them. 

But when you pitch one on the leg side, they drive you past midwicket for a boundary and the pressure is off.

 Taming of the Oakmont shrew

 - You never really beat a US Open course Just survive and try to play better than anyone else: Furyk

Once a year, professional golfers are faced with a course that makes them look like mortals. The US Open is the sports four-day stress test, a marathon of frayed nerves, gnashed teeth and shocking scores (just ask Phil Mickelson.) 

Mike Davis of the United States Golf Association (USGA) is charged with preparing this years Open at Oakmont, near Pittsburgh just as he was last year at Winged Foot. Playing in his 13th Open, Jim Furyk, the 2003 champion, will try to survive the ordeal. The two men discuss some peculiarities of golfs toughest tournament. 

The US Open is golf at its most counterintuitive. Though length off the tee and a willingness to take risks are the tools that win your typical PGA Tour tournament, the Open rewards accuracy and patience. A desire to take dead aim at the flagstick must be tamped down in favour of shooting for the centre of the green. The season-long quest for birdies must be replaced by a yearning for par not to mention an acceptance of bogeys. 

It took Jim Furyk a few years to come to terms with this reality. 

In the past, I let the conditions and the course set-up bother me, Furyk says. I didnt play well because of it. 

In the three Opens leading up to his victory in 2003, at Olympia Fields outside Chicago, he placed 60th, tied for 62nd and missed the cut. 

In the three championships since, he has fared much better, tying for 48th, 28th and 2nd. Most crucial to Furyks victory was his ability to grind out pars, accept bogeys and limit the costly mistake. All of which can be humbling. 

So the key, according to Furyk, is for a golfer to recognise that other competitors are making bogeys, too. I dont know if you ever really defeat a US Open course, he says. You just kind of survive and try to play better than anyone else that week. 

Oakmont members joke that the USGA actually slows down the greens for the championship. There is some truth to that. Davis, the senior director of rules and competitions, says Oakmont is such a tough course, highlighted by quirky, undulating greens, that he has to guard against letting the course become too harsh especially with players hitting long approach shots to the greens. 

The speed of the greens will run from 13 to 13.5 on the Stimpmeter (a device that measures green speed), slower than the occasional 15 the greens have been rumoured to play at for members. 

Oakmont is a trickier course to set up than Winged Foot, Davis says. Oakmonts greens are bigger, but they have more subtle undulations. They are the scariest greens we have for a US Open. 

Those undulations add speed, making it difficult to stop putts. Some of Oakmonts greens also slope away from the player as he stands on the fairway, meaning that incoming shots could bounce or roll off the back of the green. 

Furyk says that leaving yourself an uphill putt will be a must. The thing that sticks out to me more than anything else is that a lot of the greens are running away from the player, he says. He cites hole Nos. 1, 3, 6, 10 and 12 as the most prominent examples. 

Its not that you cant make putts from above the pin, but there will be times when you have to be defensive-minded, he says. If that fails, there are always drastic measures a player can take say, missing the green on purpose. 

You might try to get it over those greens and chip back uphill, Furyk says. From what I remember, Ben Hogan had a quote where he tried to knock it over No. 1 a couple of days so he could pitch back on and make par. 

In setting up his first Open last year at Winged Foot, Davis introduced a graduated system for the rough that he plans to reprise at Oakmont. Its simple and devilishly effective: the farther off the fairway a tee shot travels, the thicker the rough a golfer will have to play out of. 

A year ago, an intermediate cut of rough nearest the fairway stood about 1.5 inches high in a strip 6 feet wide. The next 20 feet of rough stood about 4 inches. Balls that veered even farther off line found a swath of deadly 6-inch grass. 

Davis says that Oakmonts rough should be almost the same but that the exact height depends on the weather a wet course means softer greens and easier play. If we anticipate soft conditions, well let the rough get a little longer, he says. If we get firm conditions, (it) will be a little less. 

Different roughs pose different problems. In the light stuff, a player can have a hard time controlling the ball and determining how high or far it will fly, whereas in thicker grass, a club can twist, spraying shots wildly off target. 

 The worst thing you can do, Furyk says, is try to hit a heroic shot and end up in the rough again.

 SA retain same squad

Johannesburg: South Africa named their World Cup squad on Thursday, retaining the same XV who were on duty during the recent one-day series against Pakistan. 

Cricket South Africa (CSA) chief executive Gerald Majola made a promise to the government two years ago that there would be a minimum seven players of colour in the squad for the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean, which starts next month. 

The selectors delivered on the promise by naming batsmen Loots Bosman, Herschelle Gibbs and Ashwell Prince, spinner Robin Peterson and pacemen Charl Langeveldt, Makhaya Ntini and Roger Telemachus.

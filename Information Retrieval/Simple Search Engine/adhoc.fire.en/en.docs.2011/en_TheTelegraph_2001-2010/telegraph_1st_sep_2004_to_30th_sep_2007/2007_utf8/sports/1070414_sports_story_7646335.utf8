 Sri Lanka-New Zealand Highlights

 Stephen Fleming, who led his side for 215th time, the most by any skipper in ODIs, set up another record by captaining New Zealand for 24th time in a World Cup match. He thus went past Indias Mohammed Azharuddins tally of 23. 

 However, Flemings joy was shortlived when Chaminda Vaas trapped him leg before for a duck the fourth time in a row since January 2006. During this period, the New Zealand captain has faced 22 balls but failed to open his account. Interestingly, Vaas also claimed Flemings wicket for 37 (he was then bowled), the last time he made runs against the Lankans. 

 By claiming the above wicket, Vaas have now dismissed Fleming on 11 occasions the most by any bowler. 

 Vaas has now claimed 72 of his victims for a duck! Though he equals the tally of Pakistani Waqar Younis, he is still way behind Wasim Akrams record of 110 duck dismissals. However, Vaas has 14 duck victims in the World Cup the most by any bowler. In this match he went past the Akrams previous record of 12. 

 Incidentally, the above duck was Flemings 14th as captain. He equals Sri Lankas Arjuna Ranatunga, who has the most ODI ducks as captain. 

 Scott Styris unbeaten 111 was his fourth ODI hundred in 130 matches. It was also his second in the World Cup and against Sri Lanka. 

 Unfortunately, both his World Cup hundreds, which have come against Sri Lanka, did not bring New Zealand victory. He made 141 against them in Bloemfontein in the 2003 edition, when his team lost by 47 runs. 

 For the record, only two batsmen South African Herschelle Gibbs and now Styris - have two World Cup centuries to their credit but in losing causes. 

 During the above knock, Styris became the tenth New Zealander to aggregate 3000 ODI runs. He now has 3038 runs. 

 Having also claimed 115 wickets, Styris became the 24th allrounder in ODIs to claim the double of 3000 runs and 100 wickets and the third New Zealander after Chris Cairns (4950 runs and 201 wickets) and Chris Harris (4379 and 203) to achieve the feat. 

 Styris 111 not out in 157 balls (strike rate 70.70) recorded the fifth slowest 100-plus score in World Cup history. The dubious distinction of scoring the slowest belongs to West Indian Gordon Greenidge when he made 106 not out in 173 balls (strike rate 61.27) against India in Birmingham, 1979. However this came in a 60-over-a-side match. For the record, the slowest-ever achieved in a 50-over-a-side World Cup match is by Pakistani Rameez Raja, who made 102 not out in 158 balls (strike rate 64.56) against the West Indies in Melbourne, 1992. 

 The unbeaten stand of 64 runs between Styris and James Franklin was New Zealands best against Sri Lanka for the 8th wicket in ODIs. It was also the best by any team for this wicket against the Lankans in the World Cup. 

 When he dismissed Mahela Jayawardene, Daniel Vettori became the third New Zealand bowler (after Chris Harris 203 and Chris Cairns 201) and the 28 th overall to capture 200 ODI wickets. He now has 202 wickets in 198 matches. 

 This defeat was New Zealands first in their last ten ODI games, after having won their last nine. Their last loss came against England in Brisbane on February 6, 2007. Incidentally, the nine wins in a row is the their most successful run in ODIs.

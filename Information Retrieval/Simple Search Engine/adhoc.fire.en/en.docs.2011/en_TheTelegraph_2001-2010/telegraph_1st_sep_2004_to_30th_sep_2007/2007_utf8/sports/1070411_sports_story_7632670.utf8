 New Pakistan coach, captain before May 7 

Karachi: The Pakistan cricket authorities delayed announcing the new captain and coach but promised selections would be finalised in a months time. 

PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf said after a meeting of the Boards ad-hoc committee in Lahore that the captain and coach would be announced before the committees next meeting scheduled for May 7. 

But the committee has decided that only that person who commands a 100 per cent place in the team and is 100 per cent fit, would be made captain. We will not compromise on these two areas, Dr Ashraf said. 

Dr Ashrafs comments were a clear indication that he is supporting Younis Khan to replace Inzamam-ul Haq who stepped down following Pakistans early exit from the World Cup and has also retired from ODIs. 

The PCB has not ruled out the possibility of hiring a foreign coach to replace the late Bob Woolmer after local candidate Aaqib Javeds name met with strong opposition during the ad-hoc committee meeting held in Lahore Tuesday. 

According to sources, some members have opposed the appointment of Javed on the grounds that he does not have the required maturity or man management skills to handle the senior team. 

It was also felt that just because he was coach of the Pakistan team that won the ICC U-19 World Cup in 2002 didnt make him an automatic choice for the senior coachs post which was a different role altogether, the source said. 

PCB director Salim Altaf, who attended the meeting as advisor to the chairman, reminded everyone that the ad-hoc committee at its last meeting had decided to pursue the appointment of some foreign coach to replace Woolmer who was alive at that time. 

It was decided today that the board will take its time in appointing the coach and review potential foreign and local candidates before taking a final decision, the source revealed. (Agencies)

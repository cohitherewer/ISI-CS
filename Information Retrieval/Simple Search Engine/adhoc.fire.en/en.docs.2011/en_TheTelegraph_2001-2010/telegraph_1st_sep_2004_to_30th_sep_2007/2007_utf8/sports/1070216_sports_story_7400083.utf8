 Orissa beat Jharkhand

Cuttack: Orissa recorded a facile four-wicket win over Jharkhand in the National One-dayers (East Zone) match in Cuttack on Thursday. 

At the Barabati Stadium, Orissa bowled out Jharkhand for 194 with one ball remaining and then rode a fine 80 by opener Bikash Swarup Pati to hit up 195 for six with more than five overs remaining. 

Orissa skipper Pravanjan Mullick won the toss and decided to field. Jharkhand made a disastrous start with openers Manish Vardhan (0) and Arun Vidyarthi (1) sent back cheaply. 

With medium-pacers Debasis Mohanty (2/30) and Pritamjit Das (3/32) making inroads into the visitors batting, Jharkhand were bowled out for 194 with just a ball to spare. (Agencies)

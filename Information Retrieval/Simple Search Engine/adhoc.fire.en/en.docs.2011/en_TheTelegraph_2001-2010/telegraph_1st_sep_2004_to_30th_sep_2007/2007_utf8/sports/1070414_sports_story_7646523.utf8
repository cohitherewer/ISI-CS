 Bari says Inzy didnt interfere in selection

A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES

Calcutta: Former chief selector Wasim Bari has denied that captain Inzamam-ul Haq interfered with selection matters and did not allow the members to function independently by overriding their decisions during his leadership. 

Bari also denied any differences with Inzamam when asked by the Pakistan Cricket Boards Performance Evaluation Committee (PEC), constituted to look into the causes for teams disappointing performance in the World Cup, according to a member of the committee. 

Chairman of the committee, Ejaz Butt, reminded Bari that he was under oath and that he had even said things like Inzamam not paying heed to selectors advice in the electronic media. 

But Bari insisted he was either misquoted or misinterpreted by the media, a committee member said. 

Bari and Inzamam quit as chief selector and captain, respectively, after the World Cup debacle. He also said Bari was grilled over the failure of the selection committee to scout new talent in the last few years and not having a consistent selection policy which led to the World Cup debacle. 

But he said the selectors avoided experimentation and only made changes where necessary. 

Besides Bari, Younis Khan, Danish Kaneria, Mohammed Sami and selector Iqbal Qasim also appeared before the committee on Friday, according to a release.

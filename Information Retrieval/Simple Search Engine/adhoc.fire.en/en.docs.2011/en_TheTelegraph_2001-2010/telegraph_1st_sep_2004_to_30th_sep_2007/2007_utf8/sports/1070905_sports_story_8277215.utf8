Chennai: Holders India shrugged off a lethargic start to post a 6-0 win over Bangladesh for their fourth straight victory in the pool B match of the BSNL Asia Cup hockey tournament here on Tuesday. 

In the inconsequential match, Raghuntath and Prabhjot Sing scored a brace each while Tushar Kandekar and Shivendra Singh netted one apiece. 

India, already into the last four after a fine 3-2 win over South Korea on Monday, played a relaxed game in the first half. 

After squandering four penalty corners, India went into the lead through Raghunath. 

In the 32nd minute Sardar Singh passed to Shivendra Singh on the right who centred it for Raghunath to shoot it home. Five minutes later, India went two-goal up, Ignace Tirkey delivering a superb 25-yard pass to Shivendra after dodging two defenders, the latter laying it for Tushar Khandekar to score. 

Shivendra made it 3-0, thanks to a combined effort by William Xalxo and Prabhjot. Prabhjot swelled the tally by two more goals in the 52nd and 60th minutes. 

Raghunath then got into the act, scoring the sixth goal, converting the seventh penalty corner. 

India will now face Thailand in their last match on Thursday.Meanwhile, Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Chak De India has touched a cord with the Pakistani players, who say the movie has inspired them to overcome the odds and do well in the ongoing tournament. 

I think the film is very inspiring. The players feel motivated after watching it and it is clear we have to play as a team to do well in this tournament and comeback from the defeat to Japan, captain Rehan Butt said. 

Malaysia overcame a fighting Japan to score an emphatic 2-0 win in a crucial group A league match and brightened their chances of qualifying for the semi-finals. 

Malaysia have now nine points from three matches and will play their last match against Pakistan on Wednesday, which will decide the semi-final line-up from this five-team group. 

In another group A tie, Hong Kong got the better of Singapore 3-2. (PTI)

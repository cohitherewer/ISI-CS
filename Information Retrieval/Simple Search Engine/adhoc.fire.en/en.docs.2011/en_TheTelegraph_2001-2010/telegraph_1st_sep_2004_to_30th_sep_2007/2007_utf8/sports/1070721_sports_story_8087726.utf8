 David Lloyd criticises short-term contracts

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 V.V.S. Laxman 

London: Former England and Lancashire stalwart David Lloyd, who has also coached England, has criticised the tendency of Counties to sign overseas players for three-week periods. 

I cant fathom how any player can understand his teammates and the Countys culture in such a short time... Equally, I dont see how his teammates can understand him, Lloyd told The Telegraph. 

Speaking on Friday, he added: (V.V.S.) Laxman is a very fine batsman and could serve Lancashire well... But, just how much can he do in three weeks? This business of short-term contracts must be reviewed... In my view, it doesnt help anybody. 

Laxman is going to replace Australian Brad Hodge after the ongoing Test series. Earlier this summer, another veteran from the subcontinent, Sanath Jayasuriya, had come on a short-term cont-ract. 

According to the England amp; Wales Cricket Board rules, the Counties cant have more than two overseas players on their rolls and in the XI. The Kolpak-arrangement is, of course, different. 

Lancashires other overseas pro is the one and only Muttiah Muralidharan. The Sri Lankan has spent many summers (or, at least, a part) with Lancashire.

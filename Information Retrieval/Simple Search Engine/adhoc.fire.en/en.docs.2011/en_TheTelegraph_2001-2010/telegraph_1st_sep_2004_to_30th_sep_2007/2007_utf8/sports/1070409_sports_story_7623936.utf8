 Shastri hints at go-young mantra for Bangla tour 

 Ravi Shastri 

New Delhi: Even though he refused to call it end of all roads for the senior cricketers, Team Indias interim manager Ravi Shastri on Sunday dropped enough hints that he would carry forward Greg Chappells go-young policy in the forthcoming Bangladesh tour. 

You need to look at youth. There is a shelf period for everything. I believe if the young guns have to be given a chance, that has to happen on the tour of Bangladesh. I think the tour would be the right opportunity to test young talents, Shastri said. 

Theres a heck of a lot of cricket thats going to be played by India in the next 12 months. So if you want to give the youngsters an opportunity, then do it early, do it on this trip to Bangladesh and see what comes out of it, the former captain told a television channel. 

Though the stress would be clearly on having youngsters, Shastri said he was not ruling out role of the seniors, especially in Test matches. 

When you play Tests, youll obviously be trying to play with your strongest side. So its not that the seniors are out of it totally. But I would like to see youngsters being given opportunities and see what happens. 

Though he advocated experiments in the Bangladesh tour, Shastri warned against underestimating the neighbours, especially after their show in the World Cup. 

Im not saying Bangladesh is weak. They have thrashed South Africa. They have laid India low in this World Cup, so you can never take them lightly. 

Shastri said he knew his stint was brief and would try his best. 

I make no promises. I want India to play happily. I would prefer taking one step at a time. I am an optimist and like to concentrate only on the positives and not the negative sense. I am very clear in my mind that I am here only for a couple of months. 

Meanwhile, the Board can think of some alternatives. The support staff chosen for the tour of England would do the rest, he said.

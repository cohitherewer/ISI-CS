Southampton: After a successful Test series, India are keen to keep the momentum going in the seven-match one-day International series against England, which is getting underway with a day-night game at the Rose Bowl Stadium on Tuesday. 

The Indians would like to emulate the effort they put in Ireland early on the tour, when they beat South Africa 2-1 for the first time in an overseas series. The seven-match series will of course be a clash of experience versus youth since India will again be relying on their seasoned campaigners. 

However, Indias bowling needs to be fine-tuned. Zaheer Khan, who had a brilliant outing in the Test series, looked far from impressive in the warm up game against England Lions and Munaf Patel looked completely out of place. Off spinner Ramesh Powar did well to peg back opposition with a fine spell of bowling. He was well assisted by Piyush Chawla. Still, it looks unlikely that India will play both their spinners with Powar looking certain to make the cut. 

Meanwhile, England have a young side short on experience but definitely not on enterprise. Yet, they are looking for inspiration from all-rounder Andrew Flintoff who, will return to action after a three-month absence. 

Aware that his team cannot brag about its rather mundane record in the shorter version of the game, Collingwood said the ODI series against India would be an ideal opportunity for the side to emerge as a better one-day squad. 

It has been raining on and off here, so fingers will be crossed for a full game.

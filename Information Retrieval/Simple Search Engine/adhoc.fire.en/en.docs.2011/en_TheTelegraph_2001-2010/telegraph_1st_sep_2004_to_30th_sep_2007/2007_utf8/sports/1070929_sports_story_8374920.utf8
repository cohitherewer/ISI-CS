Calcutta: High-spirited East Bengal fans, hoping to catch their stars in action for the first time at home since the Federation Cup triumph, were in for a shock when they reached the ground on Friday afternoon. The rains had stayed away, yet the club tent and parts of the field were flooded. 

The damage was done by a high tide in the Hooghly. The level had gone up so much that water seeped through drains and flooded areas adjoining the river. 

The players of East Bengal and Calcutta Port Trust turned up at the appointed time, as did the match officials. But how could they play with the four corners, the sidelines and parts of the pitch under water? Referee Pradip Mukherjee waited 20 minutes beyond the scheduled 3pm kick-off before calling off the match. 

A couple of thousand people had waded through ankle deep water and taken up seats in the galleries, while the less adventurous waited outside for the referees verdict. Their worst fears were soon confirmed. 

This was the second time in three days that a CFL Premier Division game was washed out by high tide at the East Bengal ground. On Wednesday, Chirag United SC and Eastern Railway players were present at the venue but didnt get to kick the ball. 

This used to happen during our playing days, said former India goalkeeper Shibaji Banerjee, who is now a CPT official. But that was a good 25-30 years ago. 

There was no such problem at the Barasat Stadium where the rescheduled United SC versus Eastern Railway match produced a 1-1 result. Theodore scored from the penalty spot to give United SC the lead. Bapi Haldar restored parity. 

Action wasnt affected elsewhere on the Maidan too. Mohammedan AC beat BNR via a Sanjib Sarkar goal in a first division group A championship round-robin league game at the Mohammedan Sporting ground. 

In a group B round-robin relegation tie at Howrah Stadium, Shabir Ali fired a hattrick to help Sporting Union draw 3-3 with Sonali Shibir. 

Sandip Datta of Kalighat Friends was sent off in their fourth division relegation clash with National SC.

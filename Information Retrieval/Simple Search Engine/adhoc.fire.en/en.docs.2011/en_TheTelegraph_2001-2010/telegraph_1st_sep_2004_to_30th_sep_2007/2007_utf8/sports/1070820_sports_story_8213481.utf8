 ICC urged to endorse ICL

Christchurch: New Zealand Cricket Players Association (NZCPA) has urged the ICC to recognise the Indian Cricket League (ICL) as not sanctioning the rebel series could lead to an exodus of top players. 

Heath Mills, chief of the NZCPA, said they are more at risk from the rebel series as the players may find the million dollar offer too lucrative. 

Theyre paying their players close to a million a year so its a no-brainer. But a guy who is near the top of the retainer list and plays most games a year is looking at $ 250,000 maximum. That makes us vulnerable, Mills said. 

Mills said while Australia, England and South Africa had the money to stop their players from joining ICL, New Zealand Cricket would not be able to retain its top players. 

What would concern me greatly was if the league was not sanctioned and it became a rebel league. Our guys would be hugely at risk, Mills told a newspaper. 

Rumours are rife that Stephen Fleming may bid adieu to his international career to play in the league, while retired Test stars Nathan Astle and Chris Cairns are also reportedly on the verge of signing up with the Twenty20 series set to take off in October. 

The ideal scenario from my point of view would be for the ICC to support it as long as it didnt impinge upon international cricket, he said.

 Indian women fail to impress

New Delhi: Indian women failed miserably as none could go beyond the third level of the individual compound elimination round at the World Archery Championships in Leipzig, Germany, on Wednesday. 

According to information received here, veteran Jhanu Hansdah lost to Eugenia Salvi of Italy by a whisker. 

Bheigyabati Chanu went down to Italian Giorgia Solato (114-106) in a third level encounter while Sumanlata Murmu meekly surrendered to Belgian Gladys Willems (112-100) in the next level.

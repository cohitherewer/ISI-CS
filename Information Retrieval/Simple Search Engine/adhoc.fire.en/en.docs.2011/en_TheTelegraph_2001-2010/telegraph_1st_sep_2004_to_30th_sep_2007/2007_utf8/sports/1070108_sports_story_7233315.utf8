 Steelers prevail 

Chennai: Orissa Steelers defeated Chennai Veerans 2-1 in a thrilling encounter to record their second victory in the Premier Hockey League Sunday. 

Steelers took an early lead with a sixth minute field goal by Sunil Ekka, who deflected a lovely pass from Prabodh Tirkey. 

Steelers doubled the lead with a powerful penalty corner conversion by Dilip Tirkey in the 25th minute. 

However, the local team came back strongly in the second half and raided the rival territory time and again, pressurising the Steelers defence. 

The Veerans forced three penalty corners in the second half and after wasting the first two, converted the third when Raghunath drove the ball powerfully past the goalkeeper. 

The last seven minutes were frenetic with Veerans leaving no stone unturned and Steelers defending superbly and counter-attacking whenever possible. 

In the first match of the day, Bangalore Lions trounced Hyderabad Sultans 3-0 with goals from Rehan Butt, Sander Van Der Weide and Len Aiyappa.

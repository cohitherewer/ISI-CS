 Beckham to be the face of 2018 bid

HENRY WINTER

David Beckham, Englands saviour on the road to Euro 2008, is now being lined up as the face of Englands bid to host the 2018 World Cup. Beckham, a natural goodwill ambassador, was hugely instrumental in Great Britain winning the rights to stage the 2012 Olympic Games and is keen to help Englands bid for 2018. 

His huge global appeal, which will be enhanced further during his imminent sojourn in the United States, would be a major weapon for the Football Association in publicising the attractions of holding a World Cup in England. One of the most recognisable faces on the planet, Beckhams presence in the campaign team would sprinkle real gold dust on Englands cause. 

You know how proud and passionate David is about his country, as he showed with the 2012 Olympic bid, said a friend of Beckhams. And if he could help to bring the World Cup home in 2018 that would be an even more fitting project for him to be involved with. 

We all know David has a global appeal, and is an ambassador for England and the UK. If there was an opportunity to be involved, he would take it very seriously indeed.

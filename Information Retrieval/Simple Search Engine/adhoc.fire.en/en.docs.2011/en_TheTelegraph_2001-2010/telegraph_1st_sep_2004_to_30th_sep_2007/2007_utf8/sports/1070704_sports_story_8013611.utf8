The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Anti-Doping Code amended by ICC

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The ICC said on Tuesday that the Shoaib Akhtar-Mohammed Asif case was a closed chapter and that it had learned a lot from the experience. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) had said on Monday it had no jurisdiction to decide the dispute between the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and the Pakistan duo. 

Following this case, we have amended the ICC Anti-Doping Code to ensure we have more powers to intervene if we feel a member is not doing all it can in the fight against drugs in cricket, acting CEO Faisal Hasnain said in a media release. ICC CEO Malcolm Speed is on leave. 

In line with the amendments, the ICC now has a right of appeal if a member that is not Wada-compliant makes a decision which is inconsistent with the Wada code. Furthermore, while such an appeal is pending, the relevant players can be target tested by the ICC up to 60 days before one of our events. 

Regarding the Shoaib-Asif case, the ICC said: We note the CAS decision of July 2 and we also note and acknowledge its regret that it could not act in this case. As far as we are concerned, the matter is now closed. 

We at the ICC, and all the other parties involved in this case, have learned a lot from this experience. The ICC remains committed to a zero-tolerance approach to the use of banned substances in cricket and we are working hard with our members to ensure a case like this does not happen again. 

Since we became a Wada signatory in 2006, we have been striving to make sure cricket does not develop a major problem in this area. I believe we are getting it right.

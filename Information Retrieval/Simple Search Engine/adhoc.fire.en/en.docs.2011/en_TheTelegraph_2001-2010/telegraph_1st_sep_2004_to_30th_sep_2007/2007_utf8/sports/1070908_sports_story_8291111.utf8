The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 For the 2002 hero, its only nets and gym

 - Kaif reflects on a special innings 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Mohammed Kaif 

Calcutta: Saturdays India-England face-off has become a virtual final, but the last time the Rahul Dravids featured in a pucca title-round clash at Lords was a shade over five years ago. 

Indeed, that 2002 NatWest showdown is remembered as a classic but the MoM that July evening, Mohammed Kaif, is today far removed from all the action. 

Im a regular at nets and dont miss the gym sessions (in Noida, New Delhi) Obviously, Id like to be with Team India and feel I should be its part, but that isnt in my hands, Kaif told The Telegraph on Friday. 

The 26-year-old Kaif, who led India A on the recent tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya, has been out of big-time cricket from last November. 

Reflecting on the 2002 final, where he scored an unbeaten 87 (75 balls, 6x4, 2x6 at No.7) and featured in a 121-run partnership with Yuvraj Singh (69) for the sixth-wicket, Kaif said: That innings will always be something special It helped India break the sequence of defeats in nine finals and, from a personal point of view, helped me cement a place in the XI 

Such knocks dont come too often and its not always that teams chase 326 Sourav (Ganguly) and John (Wright) planned everything to perfection and I remember them telling us that we must bat sensibly and not lose wickets early I think our first target was to reach 60-70 without losing any of the openers 

As it turned out, the start was much more productive: Sourav led by example, blasting 60 off 43 balls, and put on 106 with Virender Sehwag. 

That was just the start we needed and, from then on, it was all about batting calmly and pacing the innings well Wed been accused of being chokers, but we hit that label for a six, Kaif added. 

While Kaif got most of the bouquets, he recalled Yuvrajs wonderful contribution with some emotion. 

Having played together from the juniors level, wed developed a nice understanding Rotating the strike was important and, because we knew each other and each others game so well, ran the singles and twos comfortably I was lucky to have Yuvraj as my partner for close to 20 overs. 

Kaif hasnt forgotten the bindaas manner in which Sourav leapt and hugged him moments after scandalising the traditionalists with his bare-chested act on the Lords balcony. 

I landed on the ground and the others kept piling on Sourav Those were great moments I didnt change as a person, but definitely became a more confident cricketer 

Usually, a No.7 doesnt get to bat many overs but, that day, I had more than 25 at my disposal That allowed me to settle down In fact, because the team had so many seniors, I didnt have much to lose Being inexperienced, I dont think I wouldve got much stick had things not gone off well, Kaif maintained. 

Looking ahead to Saturday, Kaif said: Much as I would like India to win, you cant predict whats going to happen in a one-day game For example, if the conditions are overcast, then the toss will become crucial The weather, as you know, can play tricks in England I dont think momentum counts, what matters is how a team plays on the day in question 

Kaif hasnt watched every ball of the series, but another rollicking Sachin Tendulkar-Sourav Ganguly start or early wickets for the Zaheer Khans may tempt him into doing that a few hours from now. 

Footnote: The Indians have won only two tournaments (jointly, by the way) after that NatWest win the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy with hosts Sri Lanka and the 2003 TVS Cup in Bangladesh with South Africa.

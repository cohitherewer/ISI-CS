 England whip WI by 79 runs

London: England overcame more dogged resistance from Shivnarine Chanderpaul to bowl the West Indies out for 146 on Sunday and win the first one-day international by 79 runs at Lords. 

Chasing a modest victory target of 226, the West Indies were bowled out inside 40 overs with only Chanderpaul (53 not out) managing to test the English bowling attack. 

It gave new limited-overs captain Paul Collingwood his first one-day victory after taking over from Michael Vaughan, and England its first one-day win at Lords in seven games after five losses and a tie. 

There are two more games: at Edgbaston on Wednesday and Trent Bridge on Saturday. 

The West Indies were teetering at 13-4 when Chris Gayle mistimed a hook off Liam Plunkett. James Anderson then dismissed Runako Morton and Marlon Samuels.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We can take a lot from win: Ponting

 Adam Gilchrist congratulates Glenn McGrath on Wednesday 

Basseterre (St Kitts): Man of the Match Ricky Ponting was so focused on beating Scotland that he had no idea his 113 had moved him past four batsmen to be the second-highest scorer in World Cups. 

The Australia captain, who was dropped on 23 by wicketkeeper Colin Smith, blazed five sixes and nine boundaries Wednesday to post his fourth World Cup century in a 203-run win at Warner Park. The margin, just for record, is the second biggest in the World Cup history. 

He started his innings needing just two runs to become the sixth batsman to score 1,000 World Cup runs, but by the time he was bowled by Scotland captain Craig Wright in the 46th over, hed advanced over everyone bar one. 

Ponting moved to 1,111 runs passing Javed Miandad (1,083), Aravinda de Silva (1,064), Viv Richards (1,013) and Mark Waugh (1,004). Only Sachin Tendulkar, with a mammoth 1,732, is above Ponting not that he knew. 

Milestones are always nice, they are things I will look back on when I finish my career, he said. I dont worry too much about them now. 

Hopefully, Ive got another 10 games to play in this World Cup and if I play all of those, who knows, I might be sitting at the top of that run-chart. 

Ponting is unlikely to overhaul Tendulkar, who is playing for India here. Although he did break a record held by another Indian batsman, and equalled another. 

Pontings five sixes moved him to 24 overall at the World Cup, one ahead of Sourav Gangulys 23, while his third hundred as captain in this tournament drew him level with the former Indian skipper. 

Its all about focusing on my role in the team, Ponting said. This is my fourth World Cup, so when you play as many games as you have in a World Cup, you should end up near the top of that run list. 

About the win, Ponting said: I think we can take a lot from this 200-plus margin is a big gap in one-day cricket. 

Ponting praised their new spearhead Shaun Tait and veteran Glenn McGrath. 

He has done what was expected of him. We want to use him when we need a wicket or when a new batsman comes to the crease. 

Australia next play the Netherlands on March 18 before taking on South Africa on March 24. 

On his bowling, McGrath says there is room for improvement. It could have been better, but I will take it. We are still getting used to the wickets, hopefully I can improve on it, McGrath said after returning three for 14 from six overs. 

Losing skipper Craig Wright said Scotland lost the match in the final overs of the Australian innings and with the bat. 

Opening bowler John Blain did not bat after leaving the field during Australia innings. Wright said: Blain had strained a calf muscle and was also suffering from a viral condition.

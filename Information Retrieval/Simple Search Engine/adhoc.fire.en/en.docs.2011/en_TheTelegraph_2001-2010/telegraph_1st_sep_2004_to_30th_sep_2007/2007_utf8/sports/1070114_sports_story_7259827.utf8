The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I can make main draw: Shivika

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Shivika Burman, the first girl from the city to take part in the qualifiers for the Australian Open Juniors, has no worries. Instead, she is raring to go. 

I am not at all worried If I remain true to my current form, I can make the main draw, a confident Shivika said on Saturday. 

Shivika is here in the city for a day, after a semi-final exit from the ITF Juniors meet in New Delhi, before flying off to Australia on Monday night. 

I am well prepared for the challenges, though I know it would be tougher than what I have faced so far, the 17-year-old felt. She must cross two rounds to make the main draw. 

Shivika was seeded fifth in New Delhi grade II meet, where she lost to Aleksandra Kolesnichenko 6-1, 2-6, 2-6 in semi-finals. Incidentally, Aleksandra went on to win the title on Saturday after another Indian, Poojashree Venkatesha, withdrew 1-6, 7-5, 4-0 in the final. 

The city girl, of late, have been in pretty good form. After having shown her prowess in the two ITF Meets in Chicago and Toronto, she qualified for the Osaka Masters, but couldnt play due to injury. 

Now, not only the Australian Open, she has it in mind to improve her rankings, which is currently 175 (as on January 8). I think I will be inside 140 once it is published, she said.

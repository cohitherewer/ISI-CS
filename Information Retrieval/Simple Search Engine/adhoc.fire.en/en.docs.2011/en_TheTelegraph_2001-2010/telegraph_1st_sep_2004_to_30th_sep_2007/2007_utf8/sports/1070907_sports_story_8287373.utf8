 McLaren fined $50,000

 Monza: Formula One leaders 

 McLaren, already beset by a spying controversy, were fined 

 $50,000 on Thursday for using a gearbox that had not passed 

 a crash test. Stewards met at the Italian Grand Prix to 

 consider the infringement committed at last months 

 troubled Hungarian race. 

McLaren were barred from scoring constructors points in Budapest after Fernando Alonso impeded Lewis Hamilton in qualifying. That sanction is under appeal. After hearing from McLarens engineering director Paddy Lowe and team manager Dave Ryan in Monza, the stewards ruled that the Mercedes-powered team had broken the rules. 

 They said McLaren had informed race director Charlie 

 Whiting on the Thursday before the race in Budapest that 

 they had installed a lightweight gearbox in 

 their cars.

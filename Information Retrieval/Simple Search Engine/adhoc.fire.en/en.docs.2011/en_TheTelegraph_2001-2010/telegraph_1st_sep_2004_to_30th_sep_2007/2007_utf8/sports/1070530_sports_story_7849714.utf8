 A soccer role for Steve Waugh 

 Steve 

Melbourne: Former Australian cricket captain Steve Waugh is likely to take up a new role mentor of the national football team for its Asian Cup campaign. 

His vast experience of playing against Asian teams in high-pressure encounters could make Waugh a perfect motivator for the Socceroos. The tournament will be held in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam from July 7 to 29. 

Waugh is enthusiastic about the possibility of talking on the pressures of entering a tournament as favourites and playing a competition in Asia, according to an Australian newspaper. 

Waugh is unlikely to address the whole squad, but would instead work with some of the senior Socceroos to help them offer appropriate advice and leadership to younger players, the report said. 

A deal may be signed with Waugh, who will spend some time with the team this week before the friendly against Uruguay on Saturday.

 Hockey meet out of Pak

New Delhi: The international hockey federation (FIH) has decided to move the mens Champions Trophy tournament from Lahore on security grounds. 

FIH president Els van Breda Vriesman said the games apex body tried its best not to shift the meet out of Pakistan, but some withdrawals and growing concern among other nations forced this decision. 

It was an extremely hard decision and one that we took with many regrets for the Pakistan hockey community. During the last few months, we tried everything we could to keep the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. 

This was unfortunately impossible due to circumstances not related to hockey or sport, and completely beyond the control of the FIH and the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF), Vriesman said in a statement. 

The FIH has not yet decided on the new venue. The world body had invited bids from India and Malaysia and is likely to take a decision soon. 

Australia and Spain withdrew from the event which was originally scheduled in Lahore from December 1 to 9 while Germany, Korea and The Netherlands didnt confirm their entries. 

Furthermore, the FIH Athletes Commission was informed by a number of athletes that they would not play in the tournament.

 Carlos moves to Fenerbahce

Istanbul: Real Madrid defender Roberto Carlos has agreed to play for Turkish champions Fenerbahce next season, a move the Istanbul club said would help it reaching international success. 

The 34-year-old Brazilian left-back announced his decision in a telephone interview with Fenerbahces official TV channel. 

Roberto Carlos, who has played for Real Madrid since 1996, wanted to move to the Turkish side last season, but had to finish his contract with the Spanish team first, his agent Dino Pasalic said. 

Fenerbahce are coached by former world-class Brazilian midfielder Zico. He won the Turkish League title with Fenerbahce this year. 

The club however, did not disclose any financial details about the contract. 

Fenerbahce are pushing hard to reach international success, and have also signed big-name players such as French striker Nicolas Anelka and Argentinas Ariel Ortega in recent years. 

We have transferred a player that conforms to the traditions of Fenerbahce, team Vice President Murat Ozaydinli said.

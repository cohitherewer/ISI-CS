Kingstown: Adam Gilchrist believes aggressive batsmen like himself wont have it all their own way at the World Cup despite fellow-Australia opener Matthew Haydens prediction that a landmark score of 500 runs in a one-day International innings is now in sight. 

Australia wicketkeeper Gilchrist, one of the most dynamic batsmen in the one-day game, arrived in the West Indies only on Monday following the birth of his third child. 

But having been a spectator for world champions Australias first warm-up match, a 106-run win over Zimbabwe, Gilchrist is now set to face old rivals England in his sides second and final practice match here on Friday. 

The ground is typical of many that will be used in the tournament, proper in that its short boundaries are an open invitation to renowned hitters such as Gilchrist, who in 257 one-day International has scored 8,585 runs, including 14 hundreds, at an average of nearly 35.62 

However, the slow, low pace of the Arnos Vale pitch has made strokeplay difficult and the surface could provide a guide for things to come at this World Cup, even though the nine highest totals by a team winning after batting second in limited overs International history have all been achieved since the turn of the century. 

Scores are becomingly increasingly more and more and its mind-blowing, some of the batting thats going on, Gilchrist said during Australias net session at Sion Hill on Wednesday. 

Bowlers across the world are copping a pounding for it. I dont know where it will end. Anything is possible but I am not sure we will see 500 just yet. 

In February, New Zealand provided further evidence of the growing dominance of bat over ball when they scored 340 for five and 350 for nine in successive one-dayers against Australia. 

But Gilchrist, a World Cup winner in 1999 and 2003, insisted bowlers will have a chance at this tournament. 

Its hard to predict but, on the evidence here, bowlers will come into it, particularly slow bowlers taking the pace off, which is what weve become accustomed to over the last 10 years of one-day cricket. 

Gilchrist said he was looking forward to facing England again although he insisted too much should not be read into the result of Fridays match.

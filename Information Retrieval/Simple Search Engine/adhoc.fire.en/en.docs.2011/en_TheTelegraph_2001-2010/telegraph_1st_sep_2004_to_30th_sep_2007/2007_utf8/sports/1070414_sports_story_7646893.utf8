 Fleming has eyes set on run-rate

New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming said he was already thinking of run rates after watching his teams World Cup unbeaten record end with defeat against Sri Lanka in the Super Eight in St. Georges on Thursday. 

If several teams finished on the same number of points in the round-robin Super Eight second stage, then the net run rate would decide the pecking order for the semi-finals. 

New Zealand, who had won all six of their previous World Cup matches in the Caribbean, have eight points in the Super Eight table including two carried over from the first round. 

They are level on points with Australia and Sri Lanka but lag behind both on run rate. South Africa have six points and England four, each with two games to play. 

You could lose by 30 or 40 runs in a tight game and thats going to affect your run rate massively down the track, Fleming told a news conference after Sri Lanka won by six wickets. 

New Zealand totalled a mediocre 219 for seven and Fleming knew his sides chances of winning would depend on penetrative bowling at the start of Sri Lankas reply. 

But Sanath Jayasuriya (64) and Kumar Sangakkara (69 not out) shut the door on New Zealand by sharing an aggressive stand of 100 for the second wicket. 

Fleming, who was leading the side for 215th time, the most by any captain in ODIs, set up another record by leading New Zealand for 24th time in a World Cup match. He thus went past Indias Mohammed Azharuddins tally of 23 matches. 

The first 20 overs we just stumbled and bumbled our way through when we needed a great start, Fleming said. From then on, it was a fine balance between trying to put pressure on them and look after our run rate. 

Fleming delayed taking the third power play until what turned out to be the last over of the match, the 46th. 

The power plays were the toughest part, Fleming said. If there are two hitters in and you use your power play, you run the risk of your run rate being affected quite a lot. 

In a small game where there are only 70 runs to play with, it was important that we tried to grab a couple of wickets and still try to keep the power plays to a minimum. 

I wasnt willing to take the 10 overs of power play and lose the game in the 38th over when you could stretch it out for another eight overs. 

He brushed aside suggestions that taking first strike was a mistake. I dont think it was a mistake to take the first strike. It was simply a very poor performance by us. We couldnt put runs on the board and there was no momentum. 

Fleming believed his side would have been in with a chance had they managed to put 250 on the board. 

Scott Styris batted very well but the wickets kept falling from the other end and didnt get much support. He thus couldnt accelerate the scoring. 

Fleming blamed his side for giving Sri Lanka the opportunity throughout on a miserable day. 

Sri Lanka are good if you give them the opportunity and we kept doing that throughout the day. 

New Zealand, who need one win from their last two Super Eight matches to clinch a place in the semi-finals, play South Africa in St Georges on Saturday and Australia on Friday. 

Their defeat means only Australia, the holders, remain unbeaten in the seven-week tournament which culminates with the April 28 final in Barbados. 

We have just one day to pick ourselves up. South Africas attack is fairly orthodox and pace based. They rely on fielding and squeezing the opponents out of the game. Its different to what Sri Lanka managed to do on the day.

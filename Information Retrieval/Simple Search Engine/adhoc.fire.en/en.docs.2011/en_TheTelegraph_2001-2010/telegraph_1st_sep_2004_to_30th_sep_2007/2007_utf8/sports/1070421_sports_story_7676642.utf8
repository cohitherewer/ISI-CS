The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tewari to seek tips from Ravi, Dravid 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Keeping cool is a trait Manoj Tewari resorts to when batting under pressure. Having earned the call to the senior national side, the Bengal batsman is expectedly taking the achievement in his stride. 

I was expecting the call but didnt think too much about it, Tewari told The Telegraph from Ahmedabad on Friday. 

The 21-year-old, who started his first-class career in the 2004-05 season, has three centuries this season including one unbeaten double hundred (210 ..) against Ranji Trophy champions Mumbai at the Eden. 

Tewari hopes to shine on the tour of Bangladesh. I have seen a few Bangladesh matches in the World Cup this time and already started working on them. But I know there will be a huge scope for improvement in every department of the game, Tewari stated. 

Talking to Sachin Tendulkar during the washed-out Eden one-dayer against Sri Lanka (where he was drafted in as the 12th man) still remains his most cherished moment. 

He is expected to interact with cricket manager Ravi Shastri and captain Rahul Dravid in a bid to improve upon his batting. 

I will definitely seek tips from the captain and manager and ask them about how to survive in the international arena, Tewari remarked. 

Tewari said he would dedicate his India call-up to family, coach Manabendra Ghosh, friends and his Bengal teammates. Without them I couldnt have achieved this credit also goes to them, he said. 

Though he has batted high up the order so far, Tewari wont mind batting at any position. I have no preference, I can bat at any position where the team management wants me to, he added.

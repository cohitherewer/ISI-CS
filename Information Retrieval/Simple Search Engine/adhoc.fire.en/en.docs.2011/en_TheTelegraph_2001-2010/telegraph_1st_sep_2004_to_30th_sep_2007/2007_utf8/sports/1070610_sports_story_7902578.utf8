 Challenging task awaits Ford

 Guest Column

 Graham Ford is the new Team India coach and, under the circumstances, he was the best choice. Frankly, I know very little about both Ford and John Emburey as coaches. Ford shot into prominence during his tenure with South Africa. But, that team had some outstanding performers. It was just a matter of putting the blocks together and planning strategy. 

One good thing about Ford is that he prefers to stay in the background and does not look for publicity. He is cool and not arrogant. These qualities should go down well with our team. 

As for Emburey, he hasnt coached a national side and that, I guess, proved to be his biggest drawback. 

I would have preferred someone like Dav Whatmore, who has proved his credentials. He brought the Sri Lankans together, which resulted in their winning the 1996 World Cup. More recently, his success with Bangladesh has been exemplary. 

The new coach will have his task cut out. He will have to instil confidence in the boys and command respect from them. He will have to clear the clouds of uncertainty in the team and push the players to perform as a unit. He has to get the players to work the way he wants. He should be able to function without the egos of the seniors coming in the way. 

It will require man-management skills, which is said to be Fords forte. His experience of handling an international side in difficult times should come in handy. The technical problems are no less. Greg Chappell did little to sort out the deficiencies of a Virender Sehwag or an Irfan Pathan. Sehwag, time and again, fell prey to technical shortcomings and Pathan is out of the limelight. Both are crucial to Indias fortunes and it would require a coachs know-how to sort out their problems. Dont forget, they are matchwinners. 

In the recent past, Indias gameplan of going into a Test with seven batsmen hasnt clicked. The bowlers performance also hasnt been worth a mention. The lack in consistency has showed in the overall report card and the new coach will have to address these issues at the earliest. 

The fielding, too, hasnt matched up to international standards. Neither a John Wright nor a Chappell has paid much attention to this aspect and we have remained an average fielding side. A brilliant run out or an outstanding catch can change the complexion of a game. The fielding can only improve if the players fitness improves. 

Fitness remains Indias biggest concern. Good fielding can make bowling look good and vice-versa. In effect, it can do the bowlers confidence a world of good. Fitness, agility and sharp reflexes can change the complexion of a side. 

The BCCI leaves no stone unturned when it comes to providing facilities to the support staff. Still, there have been numerous injuries over the years. We should get the latest equipment to analyse and prevent injuries. Accountability for players injuries also lies with the coach. 

The physio and trainer can help him assess the requirements of the players, keeping in mind not to overstrain anyone. Building of a core group of 20/25 players, with no fitness worries, will be the biggest challenge. 

No doubt there will be tremendous pressure. Every move of his will be closely watched and scrutinised. I feel Fords maturity and cool temperament will see him come off well. I wish him all the luck.

 Beckham, Gerrard in squad 

London: Coach Steve McClaren has named five regular starters David Beckham, Michael Owen, Steven Gerrard, John Terry and Owen Hargreaves even though none is fully fit ahead of Wednesdays friendly against Germany. 

Beckham is yet to complete a full match for LA Galaxy, while Owen has played only two practice games for Newcastle. Steven Gerrard will play Chelsea on Sunday with a hairline toe fracture. Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez said the midfielder will play with a painkilling injection in his right foot, but will then rest for at least a week and thus miss the match at Wembley. 

McClaren also recalled David James and Sol Campbell to Englands squad on Friday for next weeks friendly against Germany at Wembley. 

James, a 37-year-old goalkeeper who has played 34 games for England, last played for as a substitute against Jamaica in June 2006. Campbells previous and 69th match for England was as a second-half substitute in Englands 2-2 draw with Sweden at the 2006 World Cup.

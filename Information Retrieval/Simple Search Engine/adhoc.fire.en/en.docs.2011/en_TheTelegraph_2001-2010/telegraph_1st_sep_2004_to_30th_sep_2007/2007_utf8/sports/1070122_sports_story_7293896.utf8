 Grandmaster-norms for Gupta, Prasad

New Delhi: Gogineni Rohit held top seed Alexei Dreev, while Abhijeet Gupta and S. Arun Prasad split points with their respective opponents to make Grandmaster-norms in the ninth round of the Parsvnath International Chess tournament here on Sunday. 

In the other top board game, G. Adhiban came within sniffing distance of making his GM-norm by upsetting GM Deepan Chakravarthy at the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium. 

Abhijeet signed a draw with GM Neelotpal Das to confirm his second GM-norm and Prasad held International Master M.R. Venkatesh. Adiban is now just a draw away from the coveted norm. 

With just a round to go, the lead is shared by four players Rohit, Dreev, GM Adly Ahmed and Adhiban. (PTI)

 Maradona in hospital 

Buenos Aires: Diego Maradona was given sedatives to curb alcohol cravings at a Buenos Aires hospital Thursday after falling ill from excessive eating, drinking and smoking, doctors said. 

The 46-year-old has battled cocaine addiction in the past and had a stomach-stapling operation in 2005. He, however, has appeared overweight in recent photographs. 

Hes out of danger and doing satisfactorily ... All the tests are routine, medical director Hector Pezzella told reporters, adding that Maradonas condition was not drug-related. Hes sedated ... due to alcohol abstinence. (Reuters)

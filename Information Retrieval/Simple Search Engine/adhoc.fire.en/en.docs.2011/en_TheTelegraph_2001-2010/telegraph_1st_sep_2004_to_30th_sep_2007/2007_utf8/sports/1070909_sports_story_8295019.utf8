 Alonso vows full support for probe

Monza: McLarens Fernando Alonso says he had a moral obligation to give Formula Ones governing body the information they were looking for in a spy probe that threatens his teams title hopes. 

I only see one option and that is to support this investigation and give them what they ask for, the double world champion was quoted as saying on Saturday. 

When the highest authority in a sport asks you to co-operate, theres nothing you can object to. Youve no choice, the 26-year-old added. 

I cant race thinking that I didnt act correctly. There are moral reasons that tie me to my sport, he told Spanish reporters at the Italian Grand Prix. 

I cant hide information that could be revealed by others and run the risk that the FIA accuses me of hiding information, and sanctioning me. 

The only thing I have done is met a moral obligation and responded to what the FIA asked of me. I wont start judging what Ive sent them. They should decide this. 

The International Automobile Federation (FIA) revealed on Friday that it had written to Alonso, championship leading teammate Lewis Hamilton and McLaren test driver Pedro de la Rosa last week seeking information in a spy saga that has gripped the glamour sport. 

McLaren suspended their chief designer Mike Coughlan in July after 780 pages of Ferrari technical information were found at his home in England. 

Ferrari suspect the information was sent to him by their now-dismissed employee Nigel Stepney, although the Briton has denied the accusation. 

The FIA letter effectively promised the McLaren drivers an amnesty from prosecution if they cooperated while threatening serious consequences if they withheld information. 

The FIA has not confirmed receiving replies from the drivers, but said on Wednesday that it had new evidence and was reconvening its World Motor Sport Council, the s ports top authority, in Paris on September 13. 

A first hearing in July decided not to impose any sanction on McLaren, who have denied incorporating any Ferrari information into their car, because of insufficient proof that they had benefited from the data. 

However, McLaren were warned then that they could be kicked out of this and next years championship if new evidence emerged to change that assessment. 

McLaren are currently 11 points clear of Ferrari, with Alonso five adrift of 22-year-old British rookie Lewis Hamilton.

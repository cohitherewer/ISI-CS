 Nadal gets the better of spirited Rastogi

 - Koubek blows Srichaphan off court in 47 minutes 

AMITAVA DAS GUPTA

 Rafael Nadal in Chennai on Thursday 

Chennai: It was Karan Rastogis initiation into the mens world. An occasion that presents itself once in a lifetime for a world No. 480. To be facing the planets second-best player was going to be the test of the Indian wild card entrants character and mind. 

An hour and 24 minutes after it all started, the scoreline read 6-4, 6-1 in favour of Rafael Nadal. Yet, there couldnt have been a single person at the packed Nungambakkam Stadium without words of rich praise for the way Rastogi performed. The scoreline simply didnt convey the spirited fight Rastogi put up to warm the hearts of 6000-strong audience, especially in the first set. 

Not in the wildest dream did any Indian think that Rastogi would topple Nadal. A straight-set verdict for the top seed would have been par for the course, but everyone wanted our boy to give it all he had. Well, he did. If he still lost, it was because the gap was unbridgeable. 

Rastogis principal achievement was bringing the best out of a man who has almost made a habit of beating Roger Federer. The Indian had promised to play his natural game without thinking about who was at the other side of the net. He came out firing strongly from the baseline, hitting the ball deep consistently and matching Nadal in almost every rally. 

He also dared to attack the net and didnt backtrack when Nadal passed him with that fearsome forehand of his. At times, in fact, the Indian was a tad too aggressive. But then how can you blame someone who has never played a world No. 100, let alone a world No. 2? As he confessed later, it wasnt a day to think of tactics and strategy, it was a day to enjoy himself. 

Nadal didnt allow his opponent a single break-point, but Rastogi did well to stay in touch by holding serve. The close first was decided in the ninth game when Rastogi lost control while returning heavily top-spun looping shots from the Spaniard. One break was enough for Nadal to go a set up. 

In the second set, Nadal willed himself to a much bigger effort. He rediscovered the sharp angles and went for the lines from every corner of the court. Rastogi was still trying, and throwing back as much as he could, but it was clear he was in a losing battle. 

Earlier on centre court, a dodgy wrist and a crafty Austrian combined to make life miserable for Paradorn Srichaphan. The No. 7 seeds agony lasted all of 47 minutes. Yes, that was the time Stefan Koubek took to pack off the Thai 6-1, 6-2 and move into the last eight. 

It was Srichaphans quickest and most inglorious exit from a tournament that had given him rich returns. A winner in 2003, runner-up in 02, 04, 05 and quarter-finalist last year, Srichaphan had developed a strong bond with the Chennai crowd. 

Not many were there to watch the first match, but even the 1,000-odd who turned up early on Day 4 shouted their guts out to lift Srichaphan. Nothing worked. 

Koubek, who turned 30 on Tuesday, is a man on a mission determined to make up for lost time after serving out a drugs-related ban three seasons ago. He looked impressive in Mumbai three months ago, when he upset Mario Ancic en route to the semis, and followed it up with some more strong results to end the year at No. 81. 

On Thursday, Koubek served with variety, hit hard and accurate two-handed backhanders and kept the errors down to bare minimum. The fact that he conceded just two points on his serve (one of them was a double-fault) in the entire first set illustrates his dominance. 

Srichaphan, who pulled out of the Asian Games individual competition because of the same right wrist problem, dropped serve again in game 6. 

He was feeling the pain and his favourite forehand was fast losing sting and direction. To add to his misery, Koubek was showing no signs of taking his foot off the pedal. 

Srichaphan took a medical time-out at the end of the first set, but couldnt prevent the second set followed a similar path. 

Frenchmen Fabrice Santoro and Julien Benneteau, the No. 4 and 6 seeds, had little trouble taking their appointed places in the last eight. Santoro dispatched German Bjorn Phau 6-4, 6-2 and Benneteau put out Russian Igor Andreev 7-6 (7-4), 6-2. 

But another seeded Frenchman, the highly touted Nicolas Mahut, fell 6-7 (6-8), 6-3, 3-6 to Italys Davide Sanguinetti. 

QUARTER-FINAL LINE-UP 

Rafael Nadal (1, Esp) vs Davide Sanguinetti (Ita); Xavier Malisse (3, Bel) vs Fabrice Santoro (6, Fra); Stefan Koubek (Aut) vs Julien Benneteau (4, Fra); Carlos Moya (5, Esp) vs Ivo Karlovic (Cro).

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I didnt expect a call: Avishek 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bengal cricket is shining. After Manoj Tiwary and Ranadeb Bose, another player from the state has come into the senior Team India fold. 

Avishek Jhunjhunwala on Saturday joined Tiwary on the 30-man probables list for the Twenty20 World Cup to be played in South Africa. 

Jhunjhunwala, who is now in England playing Division I club cricket for the Millford Hall Cricket Club in Stafford, is looking forward to make the best of the opportunity. 

I have played for India A, but this is an even better platform to perform It puts you in a more challenging situation. But I am not sure if there is any conditioning camp for the probables ahead of the Twenty20 World Cup, Jhunjhunwala told The Telegraph over phone from Stafford. 

I will try my best to get into the final squad, he added. 

The right-handed batsman will now go into his club matches with extra motivation. The call wasnt really expected. But Ill be extra charged up for the next matches in England, he pointed out. 

The news has given me immense joy, but I will be happier if my name figures on the final list.

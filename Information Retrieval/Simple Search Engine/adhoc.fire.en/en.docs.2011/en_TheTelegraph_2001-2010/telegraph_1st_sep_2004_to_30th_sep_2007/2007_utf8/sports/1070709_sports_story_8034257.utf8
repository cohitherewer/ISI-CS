Barquisimeto: Brazil and Uruguay confounded critics who had labelled them dull and unimaginative by combining to fire 10 goals past their opponents in reaching the Copa America semi-finals on Saturday. 

After managing just one goal in three group stage games, Uruguay hit four in one match as they ousted hosts Venezuela 4-1 in San Cristobal. 

Brazil coach Dunga, repeatedly criticised for over-cautious tactics which inhibit his teams creativity, jumped with delight on the touchline as his side thrashed a demoralised Chile 6-1 in Puerto La Cruz. 

Two of Brazils goals came from striker Robinho, the competitions leading scorer with six. 

Beaten 3-0 by Peru in their opening game, Uruguay were at their ruthless best as they brought Venezuelas creditable campaign grinding to a halt. 

Diego Forlan, who until now has had a negligible impact on the tournament, scored Uruguays first and last goals. 

Forlan put Uruguay ahead in the 38th minute with a breakaway effort but Juan Arango replied from a free-kick, which went through the Uruguay wall three minutes later. 

Pablo Garcia fired Uruguay back in front in the 65th minute with his second international goal, a superbly struck effort from the edge of the area. 

Cristian Rodriguez and Forlan finished off the hosts in the last five minutes to silence a 42,000 crowd that were witnessing Venezuelas first ever match in the knockout stage of the competition. 

Meanwhile, Brazil quickly took control of their game as Juan, Julio Baptista and Robinho scored in a 13-minute spell in the first half. 

Robinho, Josue and Vagner Love added three more after halftime while Humberto Suazo replied for Chile with the best goal of the game, a delicate 20-metre chip. 

Chile went into the game amid reports of indiscipline at the team hotel and seemed to have little stomach for the fight.

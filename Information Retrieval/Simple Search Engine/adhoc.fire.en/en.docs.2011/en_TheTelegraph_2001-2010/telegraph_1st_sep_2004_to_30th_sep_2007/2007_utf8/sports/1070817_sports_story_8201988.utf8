 Hope to keep up the tempo, says Gambhir

A CORRESPONDENT

Glasgow: Gautam Gambhir is confident that Thursdays victory will be a perfect warm-up for the one-day series against England. 

Its a good start Obviously Im happy to get runs in this match, said Gambhir. 

We have won a Test series in England after 21 years, and that has been a great moment for all of us. Now, we want to continue the momentum in the one-day series as well. We are on a high, and hope to continue in the same vein in the ODIs as well, he added. 

The opener felt it wasnt easy batting out there. It was a tough wicket. The new ball did move around as they bowled in the right areas. 

Gambhir said he wasnt short on motivation. Being a part of the side is itself a motivation. I want to do well in all the available opportunities and want to win matches for the country. You dont need any extra motivation.Captain Rahul Dravid said he was happy with the performance of Munaf Patel and Ajit Agrakar since they were playing after a long time. Munaf is coming back in the team after sometime and he bowled well today. Both Munaf and Ajit did a good job.

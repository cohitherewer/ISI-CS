 Gaddafi Mela cancelled

Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) cancelled a grand Basant Mela at the Gaddafi on Thursday at the last moment without giving concrete reasons. But sources said the tragic Samjautha Express accident and a controversy over whether Basant Mela should be celebrated in the country had forced Pakistan TV and the Board to change their minds. 

PCBs Saleem Altaf, however, said there were different reasons for cancellation. He also denied it was a farewell for the Cup team. (PTI)

 Upul Chandana calls it quits 

Colombo: Sri Lankan allrounder Upul Chandana has retired from international cricket amid speculation he will sign up with the breakaway Indian Cricket League, reports said on Tuesday. 

Chandana, 35, gave his decision to Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) chief executive Duleep Mendis in a letter without specifying the reason for his retirement, the reports said. 

Chandana, a leg-spinner and useful lower-order batsman, played 16 Tests and 147 one-dayers but failed to find a regular place in the Sri Lankan team. 

Sri Lanka Cricket has said it will ban any player joining the rebel Indian league. So far no cricketer from the island nation has officially signed up, although Chandana, Maravan Atapattu and Russel Arnold have been linked to it.

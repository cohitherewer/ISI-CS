The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Rajah: Smith unavailable

 Afro-Asia Cup

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Graeme Smith 

Calcutta: Its not official as yet, but South Africas Graeme Smith, who recently underwent surgery on his left knee, wont be available for next months (second) Afro-Asia Cup. 

The tournament, which features three ODIs, will be played between June 6-10. Bangalore hosts the first match, while the last two (back-to-back) are going to be in Chennai. 

The inaugural edition, hosted by South Africa in August 2005, ended 1-1. 

Graeme, Im sorry to say, wont be captaining Africa He has just come out of hospital and the Cup isnt many days away, Africa squad manager Goolam Rajah told The Telegraph on Friday. 

Rajah, also South Africas long-standing manager, added that the selectors havent decided on who will captain in Smiths absence. 

Smith, by the way, has been leading the Proteas for over four years. 

Africas selectors did name Steve Tikolo as Smiths deputy when the 15-man squad was announced, but theres no guarantee that the Kenyan is going to get the captaincy. 

Given the Big Brother-factor, it wont surprise if senior pro Shaun Pollock is given the responsibility. 

Pollock, too, has undergone (heel) surgery. Rajah, however, said he should be able to bat and bowl. 

At the moment, theres nothing to suggest that Shaun can only bat If theres a doubt, then he will obviously be guided by medical advice. 

As for Smiths replacement in the squad, theres talk that 30-year-old right-handed opener, Lungile Loots Bosman, may get the nod. 

Yes, his name is doing the rounds, Rajah confirmed. 

Bosman was a member of the South African squad which made the semi-finals of the last World Cup. 

While a Smith-specific announcement is awaited, next months tournament has already lost controversial crowd-puller Shoaib Akhtar, whod been selected for the Mahela Jayawardene-led Asia.

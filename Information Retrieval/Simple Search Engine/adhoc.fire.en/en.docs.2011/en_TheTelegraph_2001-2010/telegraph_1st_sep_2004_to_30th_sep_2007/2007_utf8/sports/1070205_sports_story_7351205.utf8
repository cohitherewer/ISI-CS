 Allrounders key to World Cup 

 - Ranadeb didnt come into picture as we were picking one-day squad: Vengsarkar

 Dilip Vengsarkar with Ranadeb Bose 

Mumbai: Even after claiming 57 wickets in one Ranji season for Bengal a record medium-pacer Ranadeb Bose failed to impress the selection committee chairman Dilip Vengsarkar. 

The reason: Ranadebs performance was in the four-day format but not in the one-dayers for which the squad was announced, according to the chairman. Since we chose the squad for one-dayers, he didnt come into picture, Vengsarkar told reporters here on Sunday. 

Perhaps Vengsarkar forgot how prolific run-getter Robin Uthappa and all-rounder Joginder Sharma made the cut following their performance in this seasons Ranji Trophy Super League. 

Ranadeb, however, did not react rather than just saying: I have also taken 73 wickets in 44 one-day matches, but yes if he thinks like this then I must improve my skills in the one-day format, Ranadeb said minutes after he became the highest wicket-taker for Bengal in a season on Sunday. 

The lanky medium-pacer was congratulated by Zaheer Khan after his five-wicket haul and 57 wickets. It was a nice gesture from Zaheer whom I consider as the best India pacer, Ranadeb said. 

Regarding the match, Ranadeb said the onus is now on the batsmen. I think I have done my part and now its up to the batsmen to do the rest, Ranadeb said. However, the Bengal pacer added that the match is still not over. 

Vengsarkar also said allrounders will hold the key in the World Cup. 

The conditions in the West Indies are similar to that of Indias and the importance of having allrounders is crucial in one-day cricket, Vengsarkar remarked. Later he clarified that India can afford to play five specialist bowlers there with Sachin Tendulkar, Yuvraj Singh and Virender Sehwag can also roll their arms. 

Vengsarkar also said Irfan Pathan (subject to his inclusion in the West Indies-bound squad) may lend solidity to the lower middle-order. 

Highlighting Indias 1983 World Cup triumph, Vengsarkar said: At that time we had medium-pacers who could bat as well as bowl effectively in those conditions. 

The former India skipper rated Indias 3-1 victory against the West Indies excellent and he reminded that the team has to focus on all aspects of the game to achieve success in the showpiece event in the Caribbean. Its the combination of batting, bowling and fielding that brings success to any team. he said.

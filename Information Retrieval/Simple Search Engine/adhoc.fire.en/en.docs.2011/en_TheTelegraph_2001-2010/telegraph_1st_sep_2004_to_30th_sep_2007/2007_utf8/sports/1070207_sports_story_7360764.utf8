 Hiddink in soup over tax evasion

 - Dutch prosecutors call for 10-month jail sentence 

 Guus Hiddink 

Amsterdam: Dutch prosecutors called for a 10-month jail sentence for Russias national soccer coach Guus Hiddink on tax fraud charges, a Dutch court said in a statement on Tuesday. 

Prosecutors say Dutchman Hiddink evaded almost 1.4 million euros ($1.81 million) in Dutch taxes while falsely claiming he was a resident of Belgium in 2002 and 2003. 

From 2000 to 2002, Hiddink was employed as the South Korean national team coach, guiding the co-hosts to the semi-finals of the 2002 World Cup. 

A prosecutor said Hiddink, on trial alongside his tax advisor for whom prosecutors are seeking a 13-month sentence, had instead stayed at his girlfriends home in Amsterdam. He called calling Hiddinks Belgium residence a joke. 

He went on to describe Hiddink as a stubborn man who had ignored the advice of his accountant to at least spend the occasional night in Belgium, according to the Dutch news agency. 

Hiddink has fallen from a high pedestal, he added. 

Hiddink admitted that he had not spent a single night at his Belgian residence at the trials opening in late January, describing himself as a sort of soccer nomad, according to a Dutch newspaper. 

I never felt comfortable there and no desire to lie there staring at the ceiling, Hiddink said. 

He said he had instead slept all over the place in hotels, at his girlfriends home, at the training ground of PSV Eindhoven, whom he was also coaching at the time, and sometimes even behind the wheel of his car. 

The Russia coach said his income from coaching South Korea had already been taxed in Asia and he has acknowledged he chose Belgium as his official residence for taxation purposes. 

In Moscow, Russian Football Union president Vitaly Mutko said he was not too concerned about the case. 

I dont think itll get to a jail sentence, Mutko, the man responsible of luring Hiddink to Moscow, said. 

We live in a civilised world, not in medieval times. Holland is a European country, so I dont think they will go to the extreme. 

Besides, this is just a prosecutors demand. Lets wait and see what the judges will actually make of it. 

Hiddink is currently in The Netherlands where his Russia team face the Dutch in an international friendly in Amsterdam on Wednesday. 

Prosecutors began legal proceedings against Hiddink last July. A verdict is due on February 27. (REUTERS)

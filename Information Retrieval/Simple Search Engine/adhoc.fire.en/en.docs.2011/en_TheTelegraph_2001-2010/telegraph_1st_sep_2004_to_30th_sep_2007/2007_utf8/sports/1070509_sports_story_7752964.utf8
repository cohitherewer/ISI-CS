 Taking a leaf out of Napoleons book

Henry Winter

 Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo 

Amid all the sounds of champagne corks popping at Old Trafford, a toast should be made to a certain Frenchman, and we are not talking about Eric Cantona, whose boldness of spirit still beats within Red hearts. Manchester United fans should raise a glass of Frances finest to Napoleon Bonaparte, whose leadership principles have stirred Sir Alex Ferguson this season. 

Napoleons maxim that a leader is a dealer in hope has echoed within Ferguson, the last emperor of English dug-outs. One of lifes natural optimists, and a master at using adversity to forge dressing-room mettle, Ferguson has again been a beacon of belief to his players. All Chelseas might and money could not live with the sense of mission Ferguson instilled in Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo and company. 

Uniteds darkest hours have come only on the rare occasions when Ferguson has questioned himself, when briefly announcing his retirement six years ago and after that traumatic loss to Benfica 17 months ago. Usually the driven Scot has been the embodiment of conviction, truly a dealer in hope. 

Cantona experienced Fergusons greatest quality when talked out of quitting Old Trafford. Prove the critics wrong. Prove yourself right. Show your class. David Beckham also received a visit from the dealer in hope as he struggled to cope with his post-France 98 vilification. Ferguson made Beckham believe again. Yet another No 7, Ronaldo, was also inspired by Ferguson in the wake of Gelsenkirchen. Rooney, too, was reinvigorated by Uniteds motivating force, such an effective mix of teacup and compassion. 

Cleverly, Ferguson applied Napoleons adage to the Rooney-Ronaldo issue, even calling his coaching staff together pre-season and telling them to use this Press-stoked storm to stiffen their resolve. When it comes to dealing in hope, Ferguson keeps laying down aces. 

An illuminating insight into Fergusons leadership can be found through his current involvement with the Collyhurst and Moston Lads Club, an inner-city dealership in hope. This Mancunian institution turns kids into champions. The boxers Robbie Reid and Michael Jennings emerged from Collyhurst and Moston, whose alumni also include Brian Kidd and Nobby Stiles. 

Such places remind Ferguson of his callow years in Glasgow, attending the Harmony Row Club with its hungry football teams. When Damien Hughes, son of Collyhurst and Mostons boxing coach Brian, asked Ferguson to support the club, the United manager invited him to Carrington, outlined his views on management, and has now written the foreword to Hughes book, Liquid Leadership, helping raise club funds. 

When I met him, he kept stressing that all setbacks were temporary, that Chelseas ascent over the past two years was temporary, that United will come again, reflected Hughes on Monday. 

He discussed the importance of optimism as a manager. He suggested that Napoleons phrase, a leader is a dealer in hope, resonated with him and stressed that he continually tries to see the best in all circumstances he faces and tries to embed this into his players. 

 He explained that despite the pressure and demands, he always seeks to remind his players of the need to have fun and enjoy the experience. 

Anyone seeking the essence of Uniteds philosophy under Ferguson could watch highlights from the Old Trafford demolition of Roma, or talk to Reading supporters stunned by Uniteds kick-in activities at the Madejski Stadium before their FA Cup meeting. 

As Scholes, Rooney and Ronaldo were on the bench, their warm-up was particularly cavalier, with the ball juggled about as if they were on the beach in Rio not on the road to Wembley. Ferguson encourages his players to express themselves, because he was urged to attack at Harmony Row. 

I believe I had a great upbringing to prepare me for my later years, writes Ferguson. I have many recollections which I fall back on from my childhood, and a lot of them helped to create the foundation of my character. 

Everybody played football and it was always a competitive environment but this healthy competition created a will to win that encourages real leadership qualities to emerge. My Manchester United players have established a reputation for being tough but also for playing fair which is a discipline that I have worked hard to instil in them. 

As for his own leadership tenets, Ferguson added that, the important thing to succeed is a real work ethos, discipline, determination and a respect for others.

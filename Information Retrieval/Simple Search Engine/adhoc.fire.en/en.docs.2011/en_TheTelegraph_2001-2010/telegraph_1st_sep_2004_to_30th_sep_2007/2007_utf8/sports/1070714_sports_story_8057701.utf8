 Dav a great coach, says Murali

London: Former Sri Lanka coach Dav Whatmore has found whole-hearted support from spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan, who described the Australian as a great coach with perfect man-management skills. 

Muralidharans praise of Whatmore came a few days after former Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga had advised Pakistan cricket auhorities to avoid appointing him as their new coach. 

Dav (Whatmore) has served Sri Lanka well. We won the World Cup and 10 Test matches in a row under him. If he is not good, how could he have achieved this? He is a great coach and I dont doubt his abilities, Muralidharan said. 

Whatmores man-management skills and handling of the (Sri Lanka) team were perfect, Muralidharan was quoted as saying in a Sri Lanka daily. (PTI)

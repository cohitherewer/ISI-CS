Calcutta: My dear friends, it is with great emotion that Ive been received in Calcutta, the city of football in India. I thank Calcutta. Well meet tomorrow at the football stadium and well play football. Football for all and all for football, was what Fifa president Joseph Sepp Blatter had to say after landing in the city on Saturday evening. 

Blatter was addressing a grand welcome function in Baguiati where he was offered a garland made of 1400 roses by state sports minister Subhas Chakraborty. The stage was football-shaped. Blatter patiently sat through the 15-minute function that included a dance performance by a local troupe. 

He was offered traditional dhoti, punjabi and rosogolla by Rajarhat and Gopalpur Muncipality chairman Tapas Chatterjee. Blatter was accompanied by AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and IFA secretary Subrata Dutta among others. 

At the airport, after his special chartered flight touched down at 8.55 pm, Blatter was given a traditional garland-and-tilak welcome, with the sound of conch shells filling the air. 

Blatters India itinerary will begin officially at 10 am on Sunday when he visits the Mohun Bagan, East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting clubs. 

Blatter will watch NFL derby between Mohun Bagan and East Bengal at Salt Lake Stadium from 5 pm. Later he is scheduled to address media before meeting ex-Olympians and Arjuna awardees in a banquet in the evening.

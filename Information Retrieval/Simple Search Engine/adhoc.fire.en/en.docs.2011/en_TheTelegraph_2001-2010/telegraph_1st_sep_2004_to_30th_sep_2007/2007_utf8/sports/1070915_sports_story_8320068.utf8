 England feel Aussie heat

Cape Town: Australia shrugged off the embarrassment of their opening match defeat against lowly Zimbabwe and thumped England by eight wickets to book their Super Eight berth in the ICC World Twenty20 meet at Newlands here on Friday. 

After skittling out Paul Collingwoods side for 135, the ODI world champions romped home in just 14.5 overs, riding on twin blitzkrieg knocks from openers Adam Gilchrist (45, 28b, 5x4, 1x6) and Matthew Hayden (67 not out, 43b, 11x4, 1x6). 

With this win, Australia not only moved to the next stage but also scuttled Kevin Pietersens ambitions to humiliate the Aussies. Despite the defeat England also advanced to the Super Eights from group B with Zimbabwe missing the cut for their inferior run-rate. 

Chasing 136 for a must-win, Australia seemed in tremendous hurry as Gilchrist and Hayden looked in murderous mood. 

They openers notched up teams 50 in the seventh over and was going great guns when Gilchrist went after Chris Schofield only to see Andrew Flintoff running from long-on to take a diving catch. Australia lost their first wicket at 78. 

Hayden retaliated by lifting Dimitri Mascarenhas for a six over long on and followed it with a reverse-swept boundary as Australia closed in on a win. 

Flintoff caught Ricky Ponting (20) off his own bowling in the 14th over but by then, the writing was clear on the wall. Hayden hit Schoefield for three successive fours to reduce the gap and then Andrew Symonds (2 not out) took a single to see the side through with 31 balls to spare. 

Brackens impressive spell of 4-0-16-3 earned him the Man-of-the-Match award. 

Earlier, opting to bat, England lost wickets at regular intervals with Bracken and Mitchell Johnson (3/22) wreaking havoc with the ball.

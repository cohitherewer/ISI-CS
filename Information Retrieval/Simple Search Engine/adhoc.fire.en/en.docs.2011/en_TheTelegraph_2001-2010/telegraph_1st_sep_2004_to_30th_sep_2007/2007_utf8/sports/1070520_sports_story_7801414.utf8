 Negi in joint lead

Kirishi: P. Negi took little time in quelling German IM Falco Bindrichs challenge to jump into joint lead after the third round of the World Youth Star Chess meet. 

Negis game was one-sided, as Bindrich did not have many ideas with his white pieces. He won in just 20 moves. 

With his second victory on the trot, Negi has taken his tally to 2.5 points out of a possible three. He shares the lead with Zaven Andriasian of Armenia. 

Andriasian conceded his first draw in the event to compatriot Avetik Grigoryan 

Grigoryan, GM Yuriy Kuzubov of Ukraine and GM Rauf Mamedov of Azerbaijan are just half a point adrift. Top seed GM Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia and his compatriot Edurad Gorovykh are not far behind on 1.5 points. (PTI)

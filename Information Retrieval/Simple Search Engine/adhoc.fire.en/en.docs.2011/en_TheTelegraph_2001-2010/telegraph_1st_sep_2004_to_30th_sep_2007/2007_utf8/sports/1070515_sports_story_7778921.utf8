 Indian angle in Wacas Moody coup

 Moody 

Melbourne/Colombo: Supported by an Indian industrialist family, Western Australian Cricket Association (Waca) have staged a major coup by roping in Tom Moody as their new coach, frustrating Sri Lankas efforts to retain the Australian. 

Moody was much in demand after his impressive stint with the Sri Lankan side which reached the World Cup final before losing to Australia. Though Sri Lanka were more than keen to retain the towering Australian, Moody decided to join Western Australia, a team he once led, for the next three seasons as manager and head coach. 

In Colombo, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) issued a statement announcing that Moody would leave at the end of his contract this month for personal and family commitments. 

SLC regrets that Moody has to leave our services and respects his decision, the statement read. 

It also quoted Moody as saying: It was a very difficult decision to make given the strong relationship that has been built between SLC and myself. But at this stage in my life it was important that I made a bigger commitment to my family. 

However, I will be more than happy to assist in whichever way I possibly can for the continuous success of SLC, the statement read. 

Interestingly, Waca also chose the occasion to announce their partnership with Indian industrialist Vikas Rambal and the Rambal family, who will be their first coach sponsor. 

Moody brings with him Trevor Penney, who has been appointed assistant coach after two years in a similar role with Sri Lanka. 

However, before his contract expires in August, Penney would be at the helm during Sri Lankas upcoming tour of Bangladesh. 

Waca chief executive officer Graeme Wood said securing the services of Moody and Penney was a major coup for them. 

This is one of the most significant appointments that we have ever made. We have been able to secure an internationally-respected mentor with an impeccable record and in the prime of his coaching career to take us forward, Wood said. 

Tom is a legend of WA cricket and has led the state to domestic first-class and one-day titles. He brings a wealth of coaching experience after his success with Sri Lanka and Worcestershire, and will command instant respect from the Retravision Warriors squad, he said. 

A statement from Waca also quoted Moody as saying that it was an honour for him to return to his home state. 

My aim as coach will be to do what I can to help the current crop of Retravision Warriors achieve that same success, he said. 

I am looking forward to working with former teammates such as Graeme Wood and Justin Langer, two men I was able to share the thrill of winning Sheffield Shield and domestic one-day titles with.

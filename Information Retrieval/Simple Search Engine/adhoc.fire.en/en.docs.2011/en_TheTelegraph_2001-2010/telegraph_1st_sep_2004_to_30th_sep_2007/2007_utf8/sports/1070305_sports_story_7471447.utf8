 1996: If you dont remember

9 march 1996, India vs Pakistan India won by 39 runs. It was only the second time the two traditional rivals were meeting in a World Cup. Pakistan were clear favourites on paper. Just hours before the game, skipper Wasim Akram pulled out unable to recover from a side strain. Batting first Navjyot Sidhu (93) and Sachin Tendulkar weathered the early storm. A muscle strain and loss of concentration cost Sidhu a century. The middle-order consisting Sanjay Manjrekar, Mohammed Azharuddin and Vinod Kambli steadied the innings, but it was Ajay Jaedjas flamboyance that lifted the Indian total to 287/8. He slammed 4 fours and 2 sixes in 27 balls and with the tail added 51 runs in the last 3 overs. Pakistan began the chase in style with Aamer Sohail (55) and Saeed Anwar (48). From 113/1 Pakistan slipped to 132/4. Javed Miandad (38), who was playing his last international game, tried to fight through the middle-overs but Pakistan could manage only 248/9. 

13 march 1996, India vs Sri Lanka Sri Lanka won by default. This day could be called the darkest day in World Cup history. The only bright spot being Sri Lanka making their first World Cup final. Around 110,000 people crammed into Eden Gardens, when everything went wrong for the hosts. India won the toss and put the visitors in, hoping to break Lankas momentum of chasing targets successfully. The visitors were soon gasping at 35/3. In walked Aravinda de Silva and played an inspired 66 off 47 balls, his 50 taking just 32 balls. Roshan Mahanama (58), Arjuna Ranatunga (35) and Hashan Tillekeratne (32) steadied the middle-order as Sri Lanka posted 251/8. At 71/1 in the 17th over, the chase seemed to be on target. Then four wickets fell in the space of 12 runs and India were 110/5 in the 29th over. Vinod Kambli (10 not out) watched in vain as wickets fell and it was soon 120/8. The crowd angered by the tame submission of the Indians pelted missiles in disgust. Television pictures of a teary eyed Kambli pleading with Match Referee Clive Lloyd have been immortalised. Efforts to start the match failed and Lloyd awarded the match to Sri Lanka. 

17 march 1996, Sri Lanka vs Australia Sri Lanka won by 7 wickets. Previous disputes and controversies between the two sides over Muttiah Muralidharans bowling action had built up the preceding months and this had all the makings of a grudge match. Sri Lanka as was their routine then put Australia in to bat. Skipper Mark Taylor (74) began well, was supported by contributions from Ricky Ponting (45) and Michael Bevan (36 not out). Aravinda de Silva claimed 3/42 in 9 overs restricting the Aussies in the middle and late overs. Australia ended up with 241/8. Just like in the semis against India, Jayasuirya and Kaluwitharana went early (23/2). But there was no stopping Aravinda deSilva (107 not out) in that World Cup. With support from Asanka Gurusinha (65) and Ranatunga (47) he took Sri Lanka to the top of cricket world. Shane Warne and the Waugh twins reportedly refused to sign the bats the Sri Lankans sent across to their dressing rooms as mementoes. The hurt would not have gone away for a long time.

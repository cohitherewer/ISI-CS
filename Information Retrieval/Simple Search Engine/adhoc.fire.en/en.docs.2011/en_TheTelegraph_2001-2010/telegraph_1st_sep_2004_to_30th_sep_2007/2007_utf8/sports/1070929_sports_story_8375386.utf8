The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Chance for India to be No. 2

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: India go into the seven-match ODI series against Australia with an opportunity to rise as high as second in the ICC rankings, while the visitors are in serious danger of surrendering their pole position. 

India are currently placed sixth. If India, on 108 points, manage to sweep the series, they would gain 10 points and move to second spot behind South Africa, with Australia dropping from 129 to 116. Australia could drop to as low as third in that case, according to an ICC statement. 

A 6-1 or 5-2 series victory for India would mean Australia losing top position to South Africa while India would move to third place.

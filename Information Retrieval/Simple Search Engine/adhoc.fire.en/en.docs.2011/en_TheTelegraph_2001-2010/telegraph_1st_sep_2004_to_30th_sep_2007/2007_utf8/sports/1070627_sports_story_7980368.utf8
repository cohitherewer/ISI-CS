Belfast: Sachin Tendulkars valiant 99-run knock went in vain as a rock-solid Jacques Kallis, a known Team India nemesis, led South Africa to a four-wicket win in the first cricket one dayer here on Tuesday. 

After Sachin (99) and Rahul Dravid (74) helped India post a modest total of 242 for eight in their allotted 50 overs, South Africa overcame occasional hiccups to reach the target with three balls to spare. Kallis was unbeaten on 91 as his side reached 245 for six wickets in 49.3 overs. 

Kallis had also claimed two wickets, besides taking two catches, to be adjudged the Man-of-the-Match. 

Chasing 243 to win, South African openers A.B. de Villiers (24) and Morne Van Wyk (44) gave the side a decent start, putting together a half-century stand in 12 overs. 

R.P. Singh drew the first blood for India, inducing an edge from De Villers and an airborne Dinesh Karthik took a spectacular catch diving to his right. 

Piyush Chawla then came up with a two-wicket burst Van Wyk was beaten by the turn and Herschelle Gibbs (5) was flummoxed by a straight one that beat his bat to hit the stumps. 

Not to be left behind, Ramesh Powar scalped Jean-Paul Duminy (11) and Zaheer, in his second spell, trapped Mark Boucher (23) to leave South Africa at 165 for five. 

Kallis, however, stood like a rock at the other end, unfazed by the series of setbacks. He saw through the Indian spin attack and went on to produce a cultured, unbeaten 116-ball knock that included six boundaries. 

Chawla was pick of the Indian bowlers, claiming three for 47 in his 10 overs. 

Earlier, Sachin came tantalisingly close to his 42nd ODI century before falling just one run short. He was run out in tragic fashion after stitching a 158-run partnership for the third wicket with Dravid to prop up the Indian innings. 

Put in to bat in breezy and chilly conditions, the Indians, struggling till Monday to find 11 fit men for the game, ran into trouble straightaway with Andre Nel dealing a double blow by removing Sourav Ganguly (13) and Gautam Gambhir (0) to leave India 36 for two inside 12 overs. 

Though Sachin and Dravid did the repair job, they could not really manage to accelerate the pace of scoring and were held on a tight leash by the all-pace South African attack. 

Down the order, Yuvraj Singh (13 off 12 balls) and Karthik (19 off 10 balls) threw their bat at everything to step up the run rate in the slog overs. 

Both Sachin and Dravid took time to get their eyes in and paced their innings well as they inched towards the 200-run mark. 

Sachin, who opened account after a claustrophobic string of 16 dot balls, shrugged off his inertia and once he had a hang of the things out there, the Mumbai batsman drove with elan and whipped anything on his pads.

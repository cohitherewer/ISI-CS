The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 AIFF move irks Bob 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Bob Houghton is not too happy with the decision of the federation to allow the national team footballers play in their respective state leagues in between the Federation Cup and the national camp for the pre-World Cup next month. 

While the Federation Cup is ending on September 15, Houghton is planning to start the camp again on September 25 in Dubai. India play Lebanon in the World Cup qualifiers on October 8 and 28. 

I dont want the players to be released for the local leagues, Houghton said. I know clubs in Calcutta and Goa want the boys to play in the local leagues but that is not accepted. 

Thats not the right attitude to build up the national team, the chief coach said. Nowhere in the world have national team footballers played in so many competitions. 

What will happen if these boys get injured? It happened to Mehrajuddin Wadao last season. 

 Bob said he had suggested the All India Football Federation (AIFF) that only under-21 players should play in the state leagues and Santosh Trophy.

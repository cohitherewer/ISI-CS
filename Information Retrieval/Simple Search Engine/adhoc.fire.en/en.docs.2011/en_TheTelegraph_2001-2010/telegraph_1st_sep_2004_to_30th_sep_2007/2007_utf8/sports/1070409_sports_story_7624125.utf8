 NZ cautious after Bangla warning 

Georgetown: New Zealand coach John Bracewell is wary of the challenge of World Cup debutants Ireland on Monday because they are a mirror image of his own team. 

Ireland, who progressed to the Super Eight after a shock win over 1992 champions Pakistan in the group stage, are expected to finish last in the second-stage round robin as they have 12 amateurs in their 15-man squad. 

Bracewells observations of Ireland came after their coach Adrian Birrell worked with him while Bracewell was employed at English County team Gloucestershire, then the leading one-day team in England. 

He spent a day with me and looked at what we were doing and they have instigated a lot of those things a darn sight better than I had at Gloucestershire, Bracewell told reporters with a smile on Sunday. 

Hes taken and upgraded the model of no stars, all passion, all team, enjoyment, no fear. They are in a place where they didnt expect to be so why fear it? And thats a dangerous beast. 

They play in the C amp;G (one-day) tournament in England so they dont fear big stars any more. They scrap well as a unit and probably play in the style of New Zealand and we have to be aware of that. 

New Zealand have won their last eight one-day matches inclusive of the two Super Eight wins over the West Indies and Bangladesh and can move a step nearer the semi-finals with a win over the Irish, who are without a win in this phase. 

The Black Caps, seeking to reach a first World Cup final, will have learnt from South Africas defeat to Bangladesh on Saturday, that you cannot afford to be complacent against the less-fancied teams. 

It was a warning note that you must respect all teams and all conditions in this competition, Bracewell said. Were taking Ireland as seriously as any team weve played. 

New Zealand and Ireland both look set to lose key players to hamstring strains for the match, with batsman Ross Taylor failing to prove his fitness for the Black Caps on Sunday and Irelands allrounder Andre Botha possibly missing the match. 

In Taylors absence, Hamish Marshall, who scored an unbeaten 50 against Bangladesh in his first tour outing, will probably remain at number three. 

Bracewell, meanwhile, believes his team has a World Cup trump card in Stephen Fleming who has entered his 11th year as captain. 

I think experience and respect under pressure counts for a lot with your players, Bracewell said. 

Stephen has what we call in New Zealand mana (a Mauri term meaning the aura of respect) and he has it in spades. Our guys will follow him anywhere and do anything for him.

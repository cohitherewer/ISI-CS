 Johl finishes in 11th place

 - MALAYSIAN OPEN 

 Amandeep Johl 

Kuala Lumpur: Amandeep Johl narrowly missed his first top-10 finish of the season and S.S.P. Chowrasia blew away a career-best card with three bogeys in the last seven holes, to mark a disappointing finish for the Indians at the Malaysian Open on Sunday. 

Despite producing the weeks best of two-under par 70 in the final round, Johl ended up at tied 11th with overall 285, while Chowrasia, tied for third at one stage, finished 16th. 

Swedens Peter Hedblom won the Asian and European Tours co-sanctioned event, after holding a two-shot lead going up the last hole. 

He secured his first European Tour title since 1996 with a bogey six at the last for a one-stroke victory over Jean-Francois Lucquin of France. 

Hedblom finished eight-under 280 and Lucquin was seven-under 281, Ignacio Garrido of Spain and Simon Dyson a shot further back tied for third place. 

Thais Prom Meesawat (73) and Chinarat Phadungsil (70) were tied for seventh. Johl had birdies on second, fourth and sixth and after starting at one-under. But he dropped bogeys on ninth and 16th, and had a birdie on tenth. 

Jeev Milkha Singh (72) and Gaurav Ghei (75) were tied 42nd and tied 53rd, respectively. Jeev had three birdies, all in his last six holes, and three bogeys in his 72. Ghei had two birdies and five bogeys. 

Ricardo Gonzales, an early leader had two doubles bogeys on 14th and 15th and a bogey on 16th. He dropped to tied 11th at three-under 285. (PTI)

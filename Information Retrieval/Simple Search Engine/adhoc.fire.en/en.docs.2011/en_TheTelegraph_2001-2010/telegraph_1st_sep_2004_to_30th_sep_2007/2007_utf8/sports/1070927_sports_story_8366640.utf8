 Mahindra miss semis berth

New Delhi: A valiant Mahindra United had to endure heart break as the Mumbai side conceded a late penalty against Al Nejmeh to bow out of the AFC Cup when they were within seconds of a semi-final berth. 

Serbian defender Milan Bugonovic converted from the spot in the stoppage time as 10-man Al Nejmeh drew 3-3 to advance to the last four for the third year in a row with a 5-4 aggregate. 

The Lebanese team will now face Jordans Shabab Al Ordun, who defeated Singapore Armed Forces FC 5-3 over the two legs. 

It was almost a miraculous comeback from Derrick Pereiras team, who came with a 1-2 deficit after the home leg at Delhis Ambedkar Stadium. 

It seemed all over bar the shouting when the home side took a 2-0 lead in the first half at the Beirut Sports City Stadium through strikes from Mohammad Ghaddar, who had scored a brace in the first leg, in the 12th minute and Croatian forward Ante Milas (23rd) for a 4-1 aggregate lead. (PTI)

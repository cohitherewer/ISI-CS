 Jeev Milkha misses cut

Hilton Head Island: Jeev Milkha Singh managed only a three-over-par 74 in the second round of the Heritage Classic here on Friday. That wasnt good enough for the Indian to make the cut. 

Jeevs two-day tally was 145, whereas the cut was applied at 143. The Indian ace had qualified for the weekend rounds of the US Masters in Augusta where he finished tied 37th. 

Ernie Els continued his post-Masters rehabilitation by storming three shots clear of the field. Two off the pace overnight, the South African birdied five of his last eight holes for a second successive six-under-par 65 at the tree-lined Harbour Town Golf Links. (Agencies)

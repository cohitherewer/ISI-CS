 Title for Subhajit

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Guwahati: Top seeds Subhajit Saha of Bengal and K. Shamini of Tamil Nadu on Sunday annexed their first National Games titles at the Deshbhakta Tarun Ram Phookan Indoor Stadium but said their best was yet to come. 

If the womens final was a cakewalk for top seed Shamini barring a lengthy last game which was finally settled at 24-22, the mens round was keenly contested. Saha won 8-11, 8-11, 11-5, 11-9, 11-8, 9-11, 11-6, 4-3, after trailing a very determined Anirban Nandi 0-2. Shamini defeated Vishaka Vijoy of Rajasthan 11-9, 5-11, 11-3, 11-7, 24-22 for the crown. 

It was the 25-year-old Sahas first singles crown in four Games outings. Saha said Nandis aggression and technique in the first two games forced him to rework his strategy. 

Bengal also won the men and womens doubles titles. The mens team gold went to Bengal . Tamil Nadu clinch womens team gold, while Bengal settled for silver.

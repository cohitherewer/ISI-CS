 Steelers win title, umpire manhandled

Chandigarh: Orissa Steelers won the Premier Hockey League title here on Monday night by defeating Sher-e-Jalandhar 4-3 in the deciding final which was marred by unsavoury incidents mainly involving the losing side. 

After being tied at 3-3 till the end of three quarters, skipper Dilip Tirkey gave Steelers the winning goal in the 56th minute through a penalty corner. 

The victory meant Steelers won the best of three finals 2-1, the Shers having won the first match, and pocketed the winners cheque of Rs 40 lakh. 

But the losers were not gracious in defeat as they created a ruckus over Tirkeys winner. 

The Shers, including skipper Kanwalpreet Singh, Harpal Singh, Baljit Dhillon and others, rushed towards international umpire Satender Sharma, whom they manhandled and pushed around after he allowed the goal by Tirkey. 

As play remained suspended on the turf, tournament director Shakeel Qureshi along with IHF secretary general K. Jyothikumaran and other officials went into a huddle to find a way out of the impasse. 

Reserve umpire Suresh Kumar, who had in the meantime replaced Sharma, took the help of the video replays and awarded the goal in favour of the Steelers.

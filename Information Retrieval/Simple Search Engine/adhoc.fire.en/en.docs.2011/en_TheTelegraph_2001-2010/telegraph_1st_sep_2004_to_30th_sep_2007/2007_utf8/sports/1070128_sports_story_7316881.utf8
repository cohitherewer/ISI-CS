 Anand held by Shirov

Wijk Aan Zee: Viswanathan Anand was held to a draw by Spaniard Alexei Shirov while top seed Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria lost to Russian Peter Svidler in the A group of the Corus International Chess tournament here. 

The draw resulted in Anand slipping to joint fourth place on four points and now he needs victories in the last two rounds for a chance at shared top slot. 

Despite the loss, Topalov maintained sole lead on 7.5 points where he is now followed by Svidler and Azerbaijans Teinour Radjabov on seven points apiece. Anand is next on 6.5 along with Kramnik. 

In the C group, Parimarjan Negi settled for a draw with Dutch GM Zhaoqin Peng to take his tally to 6 points with two games to come. 

IM Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia staked his claim for the championship in this section with a fine victory over Swede GM Stellan Brynell that took his tally to an astounding 9.5 points out of a possible 11. 

The Russian was followed by top seeded compatriot Michal Krasenkow on 8.5 points even as Negi remained on fourth spot. (PTI)

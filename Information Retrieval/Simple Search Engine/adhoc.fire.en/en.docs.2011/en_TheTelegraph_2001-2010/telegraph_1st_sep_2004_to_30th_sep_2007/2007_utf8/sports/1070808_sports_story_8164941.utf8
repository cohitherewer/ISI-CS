 Dhoni: A captain is good if the execution is right

 - A big thing for somebody who hasnt even completed 3 years of international cricket 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

London: The soft sohan papdis brought from back home by a Mahendra Singh Dhoni well-wisher, on Tuesday, couldnt have come at a better time. The day, after all, saw his elevation as the India captain for the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 meet. The man of the moment (that Dhoni was set to lead had been first reported in these columns on July 8) spoke to The Telegraph and also had a general interaction with the media soon after his appointment was announced. 

The following are excerpts 

On the Twenty20 captaincy 

Its a big thing for somebody who hasnt even completed three years of international cricket... Its big for Jharkhand, a state which hasnt been renowned for cricket... Some years ago, people wouldnt have thought it possible that somebody from Jharkhand would represent India... Today, Ive been made the Twenty20 captain... Im the states brand ambassador too... However, captaincy isnt important... Doing well is. 

On whether getting to captain India had been a dream 

Playing for India was a dream. 

On whether the selectors move came as a surprise 

Thered been talk and Id got an indication... So, no. 

[Informally, Dhoni got to know on Monday night itself when chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar sought his views on the squad.] 

On who conveyed that the announcement had been made 

One of my teammates while I was practising... Later, the manager (Rocky Rufus) told me. 

On the reaction in the dressing room 

Everybody congratulated me... Rahul (Dravid), Sachin (Tendulkar)... The rest... 

On whether, today, hes thankful to anybody in particular 

The ones who helped me become an India cricketer... I continue to have their blessings. 

On his rapport with vice-captain Yuvraj Singh 

I know hes senior to me, but our understanding is good... Actually, we complement each other and will work together closely. 

On the squad at his disposal 

Im happy... It has a nice mix of experienced and young players... I think everybody has played the domestic Twenty20 competition and, so, all are going to be aware of the requirements. But, yes, the ball will be doing quite a bit in South Africa... At the start of the season, the conditions there are more challenging. 

On whether handling Virender Sehwag, a stand-in captain in Tests and one who led in our only Twenty20 International, could be tricky 

Im confident there wont be a problem... Dont forget weve been mates in the Team India dressing room. 

On whether he intends having a one-on-one with regular captain Dravid 

At some point during the ODIs... Of course, Im going to have a chat. 

On whether he has learnt from Dravids captaincy 

One of the things is the importance of staying calm and cool... That decisions have to be taken calmly... 

On whether he admires any captain 

No comments. 

On whether not having captained even his state in national-level competitions could be a handicap 

No... But, then, I didnt have any experience as an international cricketer when I made my India debut (December 2004, in Bangladesh)... 

On the impact a captain can have 

Depends on how the players implement his decisions... A captain is good if the execution is right... Teammates determine how good or bad he is. 

On his biggest challenge as captain 

To make the right decisions... Twenty20 is very fast paced and theres little time to think... Captains look to make the perfect decision... Same for me. 

On the possibility of having to do without a coach 

If thats so, then Im sure the cricket manager will be a former player... Venkatesh Prasad and Robin Singh are definitely going to be there... The players know whats to be done... My job will be to give them a boost... Lead from the front... Its important to break matches into small segments and focus accordingly. 

Finally, on whether hes excited that the Twenty20 captaincy is being seen as a stepping stone for bigger things 

(Laughs) Thats a difficult one to answer...

 DHONI FACTBOX

 The first cricketer to have made it big from Jharkhand, Mahendra Singh Dhoni rsquo;s consistent show in the domestic circuit was rewarded when he made his debut against Bangladesh in Chittagong in December 2004. The 25-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman hasn rsquo;t looked back since. In his fifth ODI, against Pakistan in Visakhapatnam, he cracked 148, and followed it up with an unbeaten 183 in Jaipur against Sri Lanka in November, when he broke Adam Gilchrist rsquo;s record for the highest score by a wicketkeeper in ODIs.

 He had another feather added to his cap when he was named captain for the ICC World Twenty20 meet. Read on:

 ** Dhoni will be the first rsquo;keeper to lead a team in Twenty20 Internationals

 ** No wicket-keeper has ever led India in Tests

 ** Only two rsquo;keepers mdash; Syed Kirmani and Rahul Dravid mdash; have led India in ODIs 

 ** Interestingly, Dhoni has not led any side in his entire career. 

 ** So far he has played 19 Tests (891 runs) and 76 ODIs (2302 runs). He has also featured in 1 Twenty20 International.

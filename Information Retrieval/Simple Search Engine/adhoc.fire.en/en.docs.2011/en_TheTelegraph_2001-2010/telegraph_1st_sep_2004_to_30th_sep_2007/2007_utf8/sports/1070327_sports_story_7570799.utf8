 Yousuf makes a quiet return, the rest tomorrow

 Yousuf

Karachi: Pakistans senior batsman Mohammed Yousuf made a quiet return on Monday to the country while the World Cup squad is scheduled to reach here on Wednesday from London after their failed campaign in the Caribbean. 

Immigration officials at the Karachi Airport confirmed Yousuf had arrived by an Emirates flight in the afternoon from Dubai and was received at the airport by some of his colleagues of the Tableegi Jamaat. 

Vice-captain Younis Khan has also reached Dubai and is still there on a private visit. 

However, Younis Khan is already in Dubai on a private visit and some players including Azhar Mahmood, Rao Iftikhar, Shahid Afridi, Danish Kaneria might stay back for a while in London, a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official said. 

Rest of the World Cup squad was scheduled to reach home in the early hours of Wednesday on a Gulf Air flight from London, the official said dismissing speculations about the schedule of the teams arrival from London. 

He said the players had been strictly advised not to speak to the media in London or on reaching home as investigations were still continuing into the Bob Woolmer death and the PCB did not want to complicate the situation with half-baked information or unnecessary statements. 

There has been a media frenzy to know about the squads schedule to return home ever since they reached London from Kingston. 

The media is keen to catch the sort of reception the players get on their return home after a dismal World Cup performance in which they were beaten by Ireland and knocked out of the tournament after just two matches. 

I dont think we are going to see any violent reactions to the teams arrival because the murder of Woolmer has overshadowed the performance of the team. People are now more interested in knowing why and who killed Woolmer, former Test captain Rashid Latif said. 

Another player also noted that since arch-rivals India had also been knocked out of the World Cup it was some source of satisfaction for many people in the country. 

Once the mystery of Woolmers death is resolved then we will see the attention focus back on the team and what steps need to be taken for the future, he said. 

Sources said the PCB was also unhappy with the performance of media manager Pervez Mir particularly after confirming he had been giving out sensitive and inside information to some media people relating to the team and the Woolmer investigations. 

A Board official said the PCB will not send any lawyer or investigator to Jamaica for the Woolmer investigations.

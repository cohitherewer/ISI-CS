 Aperitivo whips lame challenger 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Hot-money favourite Aperitivo scored an easy victory to lift the 2,000m Indian Champion Cup, the main event in Tuesdays eight-event card. The race that was billed as a clash of titans, however, turned to be hollow as Moon Forest, the main rival of the half-money favourite, pulled up lame much before the race took a serious turn. C. Rajendra, who partnered Diffident-Dramatic Irony son from Vijay Singhs yard, also helped Flemenco Star win the Silver Cup for the stable. 

 Jackey Mallesh Narredu also contributed to the stables cause, guiding Wild Mystery and Regal Connection to victory in the Regal Star Cup and the Indian Champagne Stakes, respectively. Both horses led from the start and scored easily.

 Harvinder Singh Bath trainee Karans Choice, who lifted the Army Cup, was stretched by Robin Corners ward, Supreme Power. Apprentice Afzal Khan, however, rode a well-judged race on the winner, a six-year-old mare.

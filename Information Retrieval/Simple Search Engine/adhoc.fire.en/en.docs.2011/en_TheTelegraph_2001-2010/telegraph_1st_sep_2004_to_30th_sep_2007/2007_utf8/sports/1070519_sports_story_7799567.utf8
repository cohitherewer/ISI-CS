 Negi in joint 2nd spot

Kirishi (Russia): Grandmaster Parimarjan Negi scored a fluent victory over International Master Daniil Lintchevsky of Russia to move into joint second spot at the end of second round of world Youth Stars Chess tournament here. 

After a draw in the first round as black, 14-year-old Negi, worlds youngest Grandmaster at present, came firing with his first white in the event and scored quite easily as Lintchevsky erred in the middle game and reached a lost ending. 

Meanwhile, world junior champion Zaven Andriasian of Armenia emerged as the sole leader with perfect scoring after getting the better of Russian International Master Ivan Popov. 

With Andriasian on two points, IM Avetik Grigoryan of Armenia, GM Rauf Mamedov of Azerbaijan and Negi are in joint second spot with 1.5 points apiece. 

Top seed GM Ian Nepomniachtchi, Eduard Gorovykh (both Russia), GM Yuriy Kuzubov of Ukraine and IM Falco Bindrich of Germany shared the fifth spot with one point each. (PTI)

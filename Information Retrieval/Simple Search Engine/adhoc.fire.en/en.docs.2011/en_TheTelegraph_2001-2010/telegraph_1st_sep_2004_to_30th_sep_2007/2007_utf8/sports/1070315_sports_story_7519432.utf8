 Sharapova surprised

Indian Wells: Russias Vera Zvonareva staged a remarkable comeback to send defending champion Maria Sharapova crashing out of the Masters Series Pacific Life Open on Tuesday, completing an afternoon of major upsets in the womens draw. 

The 15th seed battled back from a set and a break down to overcome the world No. 1 4-6, 7-5, 6-1 in the all-Russian fourth round match, setting up a quarter final against Chinas Li Na, who upset Serb seventh seed Jelena Jankovic 6-3, 7-6. 

Sharapova appeared to be cruising towards a routine victory when serving for the match at 5-3 in the second set, but her opponent broke back and won the next seven games to take a commanding 4-0 lead in the deciding set. 

Its strange, Sharapova told reporters. 

When I served, I missed the first ball. That obviously gives your opponent so much confidence. She just started swinging and wasnt making a lot of errors.

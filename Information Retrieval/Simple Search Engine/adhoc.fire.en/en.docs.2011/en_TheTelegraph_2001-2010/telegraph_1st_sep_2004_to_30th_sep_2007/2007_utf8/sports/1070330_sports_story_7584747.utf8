St. Johns: The West Indies batsmen struggled for the second day in a row Thursday and were bowled out for 177 by New Zealand in a World Cup Super Eight match at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium on Thursday. 

 New Zealand 

 were cruisiing on 142 for three after 34 overs. Scott Styris 

 was batting on 51 while Craig McMillan was unbeaten on 25. 

 Stephen Fleming was run out for 45. 

Paceman Shane Bond, allrounder Jacob Oram and spinner Daniel Vettori each took three wickets after New Zealand won the toss and put the hosts in to bat. 

Only opener Chris Gayle and captain Brian Lara offered meaningful resistance to the Black Caps disciplined bowling. Other than Gayle, who made 44, and Lara (37), no one reached 20. Oram had the best return of the bowlers with three for 23. 

Having been troubled by Glenn McGrath, Nathan Bracken and Shaun Tait in losing to Australia by 103 runs on Wednesday, West Indies top-order again struggled against pace. They started slowly and lost opener Shivnarine Chanderpaul early to Bond, who finished with three for 31. 

The home team laboured to 16 for one off eight overs, before Gayle, who managed just two against Australia, rallied briefly with a second-wicket stand of 52 with Ramnaresh Sarwan. 

New Zealand opened their attack with Bond and Michael Mason in attack and the pair initially stifled the openers. Chanderpaul departed for four, caught by Scott Styris at second slip. 

Gayle and Sarwan guided the West Indies, who was playing for the third straight day after rain forced Tuesdays game against Australia to continue into Wednesday, to 66 for one off 16 overs before Sarwan was dismissed. 

He got an inside edge to a delivery from Jacob Oram and Brendon McCullum took a one-handed catch. 

The combination of Oram and McCullum got rid of Marlon Samuels for nine before Gayle was bowled by Oram, playing onto his stumps to leave his team at 81 for four. 

Lara and Dwayne Bravo added 47 for the fifth wicket to add some respectability to the score. However, Bond was brought back into the attack and Bravo nicked his first delivery to McCullum. 

With Lara at the crease, the West Indies still had a chance of passing 200 and setting a defendable target. But on 37 he inside-edged Styris to give McCullum his fourth catch of the game.

 Halls son drowns on holiday

Bridgetown: Former West Indies fast bowling great Wes Halls eldest son has drowned during a holiday in the Caribbean, local media reported on Saturday. 

John Woodroffe, 42, died on Wednesday within a few hours of arriving for a holiday in Barbados with his family from Toronto. Police told a local daily that Woodroffe was pulled out from the sea, apparently unconscious, around 5.30pm (2130 GMT). 

A life-guard on duty at the beach started cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) before he was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead, three hours after stepping off his flight. 

Im trying to be strong here, but it is difficult, Hall said on Friday. I have to deal with a wife and a son who are both distraught with grief from the shock of what happened. 

The incident occurred less than a week before the World Cup begins in the Caribbean. 

Hall, 69, was one of the finest fast bowlers in West Indian cricket and took 192 Test wickets at an average of 26.38 during his career in the late 1950s and 1960s. 

He was later a president of the West Indies Cricket Board and is now an evangelical church leader.

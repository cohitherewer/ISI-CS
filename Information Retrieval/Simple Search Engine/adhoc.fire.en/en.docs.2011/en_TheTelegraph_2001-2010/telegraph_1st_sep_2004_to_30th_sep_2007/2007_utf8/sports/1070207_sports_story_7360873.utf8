Calcutta: Mahendra Singh Dhoni hadnt made his Test debut on his last trip here with Team India. That was almost 15 months ago. 

Much has happened since: In Ranchi, the world of cricket and Dhonis own career. By now, for example, he has featured in 15 Tests. 

The canvas has changed in Calcutta as well. 

Yet, Dhoni echoed the sentiments of teammates when he told The Telegraph: I hope the Eden crowd will support us this time On the last occasion, it was as if wed been playing an away-match. 

Indias first-choice wicketkeeper was referring to the (November 25, 2005) ODI against South Africa. 

Back then, Sourav Ganguly had been dropped from the one-day side and while hed been picked for the first Test versus Sri Lanka a few days later, the locals were boiling. 

If the Dhonis felt they were in an away-match, Graeme Smith, the victorious captain, must have felt he was in Cape Town. 

Mahela Jayawardene, though, wont be made to feel hes in Colombo. Thats for sure. 

For one, Sourav is back. Then, the World Cup is weeks away and Thursdays ODI (first in a four-match series) is the Calcuttans only opportunity in the lead-up to extend support in a befitting manner. 

Dhoni, therefore, need not fear a repeat. 

That match, incidentally, had come not many days after the end of the last bilateral India-Sri Lanka series where Dhonis had been a dhamaka-like impact. 

Whatever else is lost with the passage of time, hardly anybody is going to forget his blistering unbeaten 183 in Jaipur (match No.3). 

It remains special, but I live in the present Jaipur is history I was batting in a different position (No.3) at that point in time and I assume the Sri Lankans have devised a strategy for me Not that Im not ready, he remarked. 

That was a truly stand-out performance in Team Indias whopping 6-1 success. 

We were big winners, yes, but one shouldnt forget the Sri Lankans are capable of exploiting Indian conditions Frankly, what has happened in the past wont have relevance in this series Its the now which is important, but one cant ignore that (Muttiah Muralidharan) Murali and Chaminda Vaas have been rested, Dhoni asserted on Tuesday evening. 

He added: This series is important for us and Sri Lanka as the winners will have the momentum going into the World Cup So, its going to count for much. 

The psychological factor is also there as India and Sri Lanka are in the same group B. 

On a matter concerning largely him, asked whether Dinesh Karthiks presence in the squad was keeping him more on his toes, Dhoni replied grinning: Were friends and we discuss problems Im not worrying Given that both of us are in the 15, its the specialist batsmen who need to worry! 

Do we need to ask Mohammed Kaif and Suresh Raina that?

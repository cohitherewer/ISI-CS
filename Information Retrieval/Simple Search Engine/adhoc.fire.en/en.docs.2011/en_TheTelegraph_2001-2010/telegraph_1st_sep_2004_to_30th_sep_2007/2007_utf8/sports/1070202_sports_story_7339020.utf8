Madrid: Real Zaragoza gained the upper hand in their Kings Cup quarter-final against Barcelona when defender Carlos Diogo headed in 12 minutes from time to earn his side a 1-0 win in the first leg at the Nou Camp on Wednesday. 

The former Real Madrid player broke the deadlock in an absorbing and evenly-matched encounter when he steered the ball past keeper Albert Jorquera after a corner. 

Zaragoza knocked Barcelona out of the Cup at the same stage last season and also in 2004 when they went on to win the competition with victory over Real Madrid in the final. 

Earlier, Getafe and Deportivo Coruna took a giant stride towards booking their places in the last four with emphatic home wins in their first-leg matches. 

Elsewhere, Manchester United outplayed Watford 4-0 and Chelsea beat Blackburn 3-0 on Wednesday to maintain a six-point difference at the top of the English Premier League. 

French striker Jeremie Aliadiere fired Arsenal to a 3-1 extra-time victory over arch-rivals Tottenham Hotspur and a place in next months League Cup final against Chelsea. 

Arsenal, who drew 2-2 in last weeks semi-final, first leg, completed a 5-3 aggregate win after Aliadiere struck on the stroke of halftime in extra time and a Tomas Rosicky shot found its way in off Spurs defender Pascal Chimbonda. 

The Gunners will face Chelsea in the February 25 final at the Millennium Stadium. 

Didier Drogba gave Chelsea a sixth-minute lead at Stamford Bridge when he collected a through ball from Frank Lampard and held off a challenge from Stephane Henchoz before converting. 

Rovers American goalkeeper Brad Friedel thwarted Andriy Shevchenko three times before Lampard added a second in the 67th minute. Salomon Kalou completed the scoring in the final minute. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Gangjee, Johl off 

to poor starts

Seoul: The Indian duo of Amandeep Johl and Rahil Gangjee run the risk of missing the cut at the GS Caltex Maekyung Open here after their horrible opening rounds of 76 and 77 at the $600,000 Asian Tour event on Thursday. 

With the cut likely at two-over 74, both the Indians will have to come up with something special to hang around for the weekend rounds. 

Johl was nowhere near his best and stuttered to four-over 76, while it was worst with Calcutta pro Gangjee, who finished another shot behind. 

Chinese star Liang Wen-Chong celebrated a return to Korea by grabbing the first round lead with a blistering eight-under-par 64.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 What is meant by young?

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai: Selection committee chairman Dilip Vengsarkar did consult his colleagues on the captaincy issue, but it was more of a sham as the Establishment had conveyed Rahul Dravid would keep the job. 

That he was set to was reported in these columns on Saturday. 

Dilip did call, but the impression Ive got is that there was no discussion It was made clear that Dravid would continue, a well-placed source told The Telegraph. 

He added: Its okay for the working committee to give a directive, but whats meant by young? Even a 25-year-old is young Will the selectors pick young failures and not old performers? Should one go by age or performance? 

Well, the next selection committee meeting ought to be quite interesting.

 Another set of Level II coaches to roll out

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: At a time when the conundrum over the next Team India coach be it foreign or national is yet to be sorted, the National Cricket Academy (NCA) is busy grooming home-grown talent. 

Come Monday, another group of qualified Level-II coaches from East Zones batch of 19 will graduate. With about 50 per cent expected to make the next grade from the current batch, the next and final stop for the NCA would be South Zone. The course is being conducted separately for the first time in the five zones and the NCA has already awarded Level II certificates in the West, North and Central zones. 

Earlier the course would be conducted at the NCA headquarters in Bangalore where aspiring coaches from all over the country would get together. 

After Frank Tyson left last year, the entire module has been revised This is for the first time the entire faculty, headed by Lalchand Rajput, is from India. This time more stress is given on specialisation in fields like batting, bowling, wicketkeeping, fielding and biomechanics, said NCAs wicketkeeping and fielding coach Atul Gaikwad. 

Gaikwad, who coached Indias women team before their historic tour of England last year, urged for specialist coaches. 

Having specialist coaches provides more specific attention. Other than batting, bowling and fielding, there is also a need for a separate wicketkeeping coach.

 Symonds, Haddin, Tait make the cut

Adelaide: Captain Ricky Ponting got his way when injured allrounder Andrew Symonds was included in Australias 15-man squad for next months World Cup in the West Indies. 

Symonds is likely to miss the opening rounds of the tournament while recovering from a ruptured bicep tendon, but Ponting pushed strongly for his inclusion, saying Australia will be a better team when Symonds is available. 

New South Wales wicketkeeper-batsman Brad Haddin was also included in the squad, partly as cover for veteran Adam Gilchrist who will miss warm-up matches to be with his wife, Mel, who is expecting their third child. 

Tearaway fast bowler Shaun Tait and allrounder Shane Watson also won berths despite playing minor roles in the just-concluded tri-series against England and New Zealand. 

Tait won the final seam bowling position ahead of Stuart Clark in what chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch described as an attacking move attuned to the West Indies predicted slow pitches. 

Watson, who played in the tri-series finals after missing the preliminary rounds with injury, held out Cameron White for his place. Hilditch said Clark and White were desperately unlucky to miss the cut.

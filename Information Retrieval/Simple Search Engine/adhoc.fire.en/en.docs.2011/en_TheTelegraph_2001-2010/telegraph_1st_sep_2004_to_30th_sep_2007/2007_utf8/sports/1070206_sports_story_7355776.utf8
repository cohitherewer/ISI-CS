The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Brussels: Justine Henin-Hardenne will not play for Belgium in the Fed Cup against the US, joining Kim Clijsters on the sidelines. With my advisors, we decided not to play in 2007, Henin-Hardenne said on Sunday on her website. We took the decision because of the very heavy calendar. The 24-year-old is currently second in rankings and will resume her season in Paris this week. The US and Belgium play the first round on April 21-22 at Delray Beach, Florida, and the pullout of Belgiums top two players makes the job a lot easier for the Americans. Belgiums third best player is Kirsten Flipkens, who is ranked 104th.

 Beijing: Liu Xiangs shoes keep getting more valuable. Liu, the Olympic 110m hurdle champion and world-record holder, has auctioned his autographed track shoes for 200,000 yuan ($25,800) at a charity event, Chinese news agency reported on Monday. The shoes were bought on Sunday by China Air, and the money will go toward the schooling of migrant children.

 Rome: Italys football industry urged government and sporting authorities to lift a ban on soccer matches as the nation paused for the funeral of a policeman killed by rioting fans.

Meanwhile, Filippo Racitis coffin was driven through the streets of Catania on Monday to the cathedral, with thousands of onlookers applauding in a customary sign of respect.

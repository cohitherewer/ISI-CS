The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Looking forward to the final, says Sourav

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly is all geared up for the Ranji Trophy final against Mumbai at the Wankhede Stadium, commencing on Friday. 

Of course I am playing All I can say is that this is one final I am looking forward to, Sourav told The Telegraph over the phone on Sunday. 

Sourav made his Ranji debut for Bengal against Delhi in the 1989-90 final where he scored 22 runs. That was the last time Bengal won the coveted trophy. 

I cannot compare this final appearance with that one but I feel Bengal is a good side, and are capable of winning the Ranji Trophy, Sourav said. 

The former Team India captain has informed the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) about his availability and accordingly, CAB will send a squad of 16 to Mumbai. 

We cannot leave out anyone, so we have decided to include Sourav and Shib Shankar Paul as the 15th and 16th members, respectively, CAB secretary Saradindu Pal said. 

According to him, Sourav will join the squad in Mumbai after having finished his national duty against the West Indies on Tuesday. The Bengal squad leaves on Tuesday.

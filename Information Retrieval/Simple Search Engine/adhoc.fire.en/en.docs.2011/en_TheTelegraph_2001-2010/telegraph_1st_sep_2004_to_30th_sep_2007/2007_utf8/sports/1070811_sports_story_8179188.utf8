 Becks MLS debut ends in defeat 

Washington: David Beckham made his long-awaited Major League Soccer debut Thursday. England midfielder came on as a 72nd-minute substitute in the 1-0 loss to DC United in front of a sell-out crowd at the RFK Stadium in Washington. 

Watched by England coach Steve McClaren, Beckham was glad to finally get back on the pitch after struggling with an ankle injury and was delighted with the reception he received from the 40,000-plus crowd. 

Although a little ring-rusty, Beckham showed few ill effects of his ankle injury but said the problem has still not cleared up. (AGENCIES)

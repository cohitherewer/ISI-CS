 England ready to rock Guyana 

DEREK PRINGLE IN GEORGETOWN

Within the cricket-playing West Indies, Georgetown is as far as you can get from Jamaica and the Bob Woolmer murder mystery that has rocked the World Cup. England arrived here on Sunday evening for their opening Super Eight match, a journey that according to their pace bowler Sajid Mahmood, has enabled them to put the shocking events of the past week behind them. 

Those issues have been dealt with now and are in the past, said Mahmood. Everyone is looking forward to the Super Eight. If youve still got that stuff in the back of your minds, youre not really going to do too well. I think our performances in the last two games, which we won, showed weve got over it and were looking to perform here. 

Mahmoods take is at odds with those that feel the tournament should be cancelled, but then most sportsmen tend only to get sentimental once they retire. Guyana, too, seems immune to the calls for cancellation, though in a place where nature still dominates, perhaps death lacks the shock value it has elsewhere. 

This is a wild frontier, a view apparent as you come into land at Timehri international airport amid glorious tropical jungle and swollen brown rivers as wide as the English Channel. Explorers have always been attracted to the place but there is a sense of the unknown about the cricket too, with games being played at the newly built Guyana National Stadium, a work in progress judging from the construction work still taking place there and at Buddys hotel next door. 

Most of the media, though not the teams, are staying at Buddys and we appear to be its first guests. Requests for food in the hotels Chinese restaurant are met with the kind of bemused look from staff that 19th Century missionaries must have experienced on first contact with lost Amazonian tribes. 

Fortunately, those running the cricket stadium next door are not as clueless and the playing area looks excellent, though with rain a near constant threat in Georgetown at this time of year, conditions could favour bat rather than ball. 

Of course the pitches here for the Super Eight may prove to be belters, but if they arent, it narrows the gap between strong and weak sides, a situation that helped Ireland against Pakistan, and one that could help them again against England on Friday. 

Sporty pitches place added pressure on the bowlers, the least experienced arm of Englands team. Andrew Flintoff is a Mr Consistency with the ball, on or off the beer, while Monty Panesar is becoming increasingly dependable. But the rest still alternate good days with bad depending on which swings more, the ball or their mood. 

With James Anderson taking the new ball, and Paul Collingwood using his resourceful liquorice all sorts in the middle overs, the fifth bowling spot remains unsettled. Mahmood, Liam Plunkett, Jon Lewis, Ravi Bopara and Jamie Dalrymple are all possible contenders. 

For the moment, Mahmood is the man in possession, his extra pace seen as an advantage over the associate sides like Kenya and Ireland, who rarely face anything above 83 mph. His ability to mix his pace with a good slower ball means he can also be used in the middle overs, though his floppy wrist action means he can be inaccurate in times of stress.

Calcutta: India have jumped two places in the LG ICC Test Championship table following their series win against England. 

The 1-0 success has earned five rating points for Rahul Dravids men and lifted them above both South Africa and Sri Lanka. India have the same number of points as the Lankans but now stand above them when the ratings are recalculated to three decimal places, according to a ICC media release. 

India are now just four points behind second-placed England with the home side dropping four points following their first home series loss since the 1-4 reverse against Australia in 2001. 

Zaheer Khan has risen to a career-high 10th position in the player rankings for Test bowlers after his Man of the Series performance against England. The left-arm seamer, whose 18 wickets in the series was the mainstay of Indias first series win in England in 21 years, has climbed two places in the latest table. 

Zaheer eclipsed his previous highest ranking of 11th, reached in 2003, and became the second Indian bowler alongside Anil Kumble in the top 10. Kumble maintains his seventh place but his maiden century in his 118th Test puts him back among the top 10 allrounders. 

Kumble is up six places to eighth in the allrounders list his highest listing since 2002. 

Mahendra Singh Dhoni (43), Dinesh Karthik (53) and pacer Sreesanth (25) have all achieved career-best rankings. 

However, India have no batsman in the top-10 for the first time since 1993. Rahul Dravid, who had a disappointing series, has dropped two places to 11th.

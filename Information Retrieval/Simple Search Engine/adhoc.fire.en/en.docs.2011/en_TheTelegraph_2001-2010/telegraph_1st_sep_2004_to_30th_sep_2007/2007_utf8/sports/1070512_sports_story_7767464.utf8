The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Austrian coach for lifters 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Weightlifting is a sport that has caused repeated embarrassments to the nation in the past few years. While nine lifters have been banned for consuming performance enhancing drugs, the Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWF) was even suspended twice by the international body. 

This dubious distinction, however, hasnt made any effect on the games status with the sports ministry. While hockey and football have been demoted, weightlifting still remains a priority game on the ministrys classification list. 

So much so that the government is ready to back the IWF in acquiring a foreign coach for Beijing Olympics. According to IWF secretary Balbir Bhatia, an Austrian coach is set to be appointed in the next couple of months. 

We have selected Austrian coach Magad Salama for the top job, Bhatia said. We have written to the international body for their opinion on Salama. Once we receive a positive view, a proposal will be put up with the ministry. The government will pay him a salary of $2,500. 

Asked how weightlifting could retain its priority status, a ministry official said: Lifters have been winning medals regularly in international meets. 

There has not been one major international meet since 2002 where Indian lifters have not tested positive. In 2002 and 2006 Commonwealth Games, four Indian lifters were banned, while two more were found guilty at the Athens Olympics in 2004.

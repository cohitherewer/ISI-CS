 Former Jamaica PM to assess WI board

Bridgetown: Former Jamaica Prime Minister P.J. Patterson will lead a three-member panel that will assess the West Indies Cricket Board, a WICB statement said Tuesday. 

Patterson, who stepped down last year after 14 years as Jamaicas premier, will form the committee with Alister McIntyre, former University of the West Indies vice chancellor, and Ian McDonald, a Guyanese historian and author. 

We are asking them to tell us what they think of West Indies cricket, where it should be going and whether we need to do things differently, said Ken Gordon, WICB board president. 

The committee is expected to report its recommendations to the WICB by May 31, a month after the end of the 16-nation cricket World Cup.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Kalmadi blames the M factor

New Delhi: A day after Indias failed

 bid to host 2014 Asian Games, Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president Suresh

 Kalmadi kept up his attack on sports minister Mani Shankar Aiyar who said he

 was not surprised at the event being awarded to South Korea. 

Kalmadi also said the government has to make a complete overhaul of its attitude towards modern sport if the country cherished any hopes of hosting a mega event in the future. 

Kalmadi said while the Koreans had the financial backing from their government, it was not the same case with India. 

The Koreans spent $20 million on their bid. In the last two years, they were going to all member countries canvassing their case while we were given only $1.5 million, Kalmadi said. 

Had our government committed more money, we could have got the Games. But with such an attitude, we cannot think of holding any Games in future. 

Both the Manis were prime factors Money and Mani, lamented Kalmadi. 

Aiyar, on his part, refused to engage in a verbal duel with Kalmadi but said that he was disappointed at Indias failure to win the bid. Rejecting Kalmadis barb that Indias failure was Aiyars victory, the minister told a TV channel: I heard that expression but I dont see it as my victory.

 IOA gets IOC support

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Monday came out in support of Indian Olympic Association (IOA) in its fight against the Sports Ministry to preserve autonomy. 

IOC Director Pere Miro, in a letter addressed to IOA President Suresh Kalamdi from Lausanne, has expressed fear that the new sports policy might impact the rules and principles governing the Olympic Movement, as it is defined in the Olympic Charter. 

The letter was released by the IOA on Monday. 

It may be recalled that the Government in its draft sports policy has proposed to establish a new regulatory authority to resolve the disputes in Indian sports federations. The move has been opposed by the IOA and other national sports federations. 

On Saturday, IOA and all the national sports federations unanimously decided to reject the Draft National Sports Policy 2007 which envisaged the setting up of a Sports Regulatory Body to monitor national sports bodies. 

The letter from Miro said: We have recently learned that a series of measures and a new sports policy would be currently under study in your country, which might impact the rules and principles governing the Olympic Movement, as it is defined in the Olympic Charter. 

The IOA has already received letters of support from Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) and Olympic Council of Asia (OCA). 

On September 15, the IOA would meet all state Olympic associations before coming out with a document stating their opposition to the Draft Policy.

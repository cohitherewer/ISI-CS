Calcutta: Deep Dasgupta and Co. may have joined the Indian Cricket League (ICL), but it will also mean a big opportunity for players who have been waiting in the wings. The Telegraph lists a few who could gain by this exodus. 

Here goes (alphabetically): 

AMITAVA CHAKRABORTY: With Subhamoy Das and Deep Dasgupta not in the fray, it is likely that this promising opener will get an extended opportunity this season. Along with Arindam Das, he can provide an ideal launch to the Bengal innings. A specialist close-in fielder, his services will come in handy. 

SOHAM GHOSH: This right-handed batsman has been consistent at the under-22 level and has played a big role in Bengals success last season. According to several former players, he has the talent and ambition to make it big one day. 

MURTAZA LODHGAR: With Shiv Sagar Singh out of the way and left-arm spinners hard to come by, the 31-year-old veteran is bound to play a big role in the forthcoming season. His experience and the fact that he enjoys the selectors backing will come in handy. He hasnt disappointed during the limited opportunities that have come his way. 

ANUSTUP MAJUMDAR: The talented right-handed batsman didnt get much opportunity last season. But his consistent showing at the junior level has made him a contender for a middle-order slot. 

KAMAL HASAN MONDAL: He was a regular member of the Bengal squad last season but failed to get any opportunity. His composed batting and good temperament has been much talked about during the last couple of seasons. 

WRIDDHIMAN SAHA: A window of opportunity may open up for this promising young wicketkeeper. He has been consistent at the junior level and hasnt disappointed in the limited opportunities with the senior side. That he can contribute with the bat also gives him an edge. 

MANOJ TIWARY: Bengals Twenty20 captain is likely to take charge of the Ranji team following Deep Dasguptas exit. 

His aggressive leadership has already come in for praise and it remains to be seen how he handles the new responsibility. This will be a big season for the exciting batsman.

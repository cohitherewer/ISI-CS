 Give them a chance and Bangla will pounce, warns Smith

Georgetown: Bangladeshs youthful confidence has given South African captain Graeme Smith cause for concern ahead of their World Cup Super Eight match in Georgetown on Saturday. 

If you give them a chance they will pounce on it, Smith told a news conference on Friday. Youve got to start well against them and put them on the back foot as early as you can. 

If you give them a sniff theyve got players who have, under (coach) Dav Whatmore, learnt how to win games. 

Theyre young, and they dont think about the situations that theyre in. They play with that sort of freedom. 

Bangladesh were at their most confident in their five-wicket win over India in a Group B match in Port of Spain, Trinidad on March 17. That shock reverse led to the 1983 champions first-round elimination. 

Since then they have lost momentum and they were beaten by 10 wickets and nine wickets by Australia and New Zealand respectively in their last two matches. 

Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar hoped his men would bounce back against the South Africans, who like Australia and New Zealand, are also among the favourites to win the tournament. 

I dont think we played our best cricket in our last two games and I believe we can improve, Bashar told a news conference. 

Our game plan is to keep as many wickets in hand as we can, and if we bowl first we would like to restrict them to a total we could chase. 

Bangladesh have had to prepare for the match amid speculation that Whatmore could be in line to replace Greg Chappell as Indias coach. 

However, Bashar was quick to deny that Whatmores situation was having a negative impact on the team. 

The way Dav is working with us, he really didnt show that he wants to leave us, Bashar said. Hes never given us any indication that hes not enjoying his time with us. 

We are in the middle of a very important tour and everyone is focused on that, including Dav and the players. 

Smith briefly entertained the prospect of what he said would be a dream final between Australia and South Africa. 

I guess you would want a South Africa-Australia final, Smith said. Certainly from our point of view thats what most of our young guys dream about growing up. 

But we are not mapping out where we want to be, we want to get ourselves into the semi-finals first. 

South Africas top-order batsmen, especially Jacques Kallis, looked in good nick and fast bowler Shaun Pollocks sharp two-wicket spell against Ireland came at the right time. The paceman had gone wicketless in the last two games. 

The fact that our top order is batting so well that the guys in the middle order havent had much time to bat myself, Justin Kemp and Mark Boucher have had very little time in the middle, said Prince.

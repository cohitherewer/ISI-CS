The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Records tumble in SA blitzkrieg

Basseterre: Herschelle Gibbs smashed six sixes off one over to set an international benchmark as South Africa reached 353 for three in Fridays World Cup match against Netherlands. 

The Netherlands were 48 for the loss of four wickets after 20 overs. Eric Szwarczynski and Ryan ten Doeschate were batting on 1 and 16, respectively. Shaun Pollock, Charl Langeveldt and Andrew Hall took one wicket each. 

In a group A match reduced to 40 overs-a-side due to overnight rain, Gibbs hit leg-spinner Daan van Bunges 30th over for 36 runs to force a tournament sponsor to honour its pledge to pay $1 million to a charity for the unprecedented feat. 

West Indies great Sir Garfield Sobers and Indias Ravi Shastri hit six sixes in one over during first-class matches. 

Sobers did it first, in an English county match for Nottinghamshire in 1968 when he hit six sixes in an over from Glamorgans Malcolm Nash at Swansea. Shastri did it for Bombay in a Ranji Trophy match against Baroda in 1984-85. 

Jacques Kallis, who scored his first World Cup century with an unbeaten 128 from 109 balls, shared in a second-wicket stand of 114 with Graeme Smith (67). 

Kallis also had a 105-run partnership with Gibbs, who scored 72, and put on 134 with Mark Boucher (75 off 31 balls) in just 9.1 overs. 

While Kallis built his innings, Boucher smashed his way to the fastest half-century in World Cup history, off only 21 balls. 

The Proteas hit a limited-overs record 18 sixes in the innings beating the 14 that Pakistan hit against Sri Lanka in Nairobi in 1996; and by Australia against South Africa in Johannesburg last year.

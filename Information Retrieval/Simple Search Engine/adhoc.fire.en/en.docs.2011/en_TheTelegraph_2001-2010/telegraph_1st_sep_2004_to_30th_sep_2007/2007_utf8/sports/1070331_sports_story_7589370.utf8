The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We need to take a closer look at our batting 

 Fast Track - Courtney Walsh 

In an earlier article, I had mentioned that Australia were too good to be written off just yet. Their recent performances have proved me right. In my book, Australia is still the worlds number one team, no matter what the official ICC rankings say, and therefore the team to beat. I am particularly impressed at the way they have backed themselves while batting, confident that they will put up big enough scores to reduce the workload on their bowlers. 

As for Matthew Hayden, what can one say? He has certainly made one of the best comebacks I have ever witnessed. Six-odd months ago, this man was on the verge of being dropped from the team for good, and yet has resumed duty as the backbone of Australian batting. 

The mere weight of this achievement makes any analysis of his performance redundant. Against South Africa, he batted like a man possessed and his century was like a declaration of intent. The West Indies, too, ran into him at Antigua with predictable results. 

The West Indies need to look at their batting a little more closely if they want to book a semi-final berth. It is disappointing to watch the top order batsmen throw away their wickets in an attempt to accelerate. 

In their last two encounters, against Australia and New Zealand, I noticed the tendency to go after bowlers who were perceived to be lesser threats. So against Australia, Glenn McGrath was obviously the intended target, but you cannot take the attack to a bowler of his calibre - falling speed notwithstanding - without running a fair degree of risk, a fact that the West Indies batsmen seemed unaware of. 

Against the Black Caps, on the other hand, the batsmen seemed to relax as soon as Shane Bond was out of the attack, which saw them play casual shots against Jacob Oram and thus lose wickets. 

What they obviously failed to take into account was that the New Zealand attack was a disciplined and motivated one, and therefore not to be taken lightly. 

True champion teams are those who, like Australia, force other teams to raise their games. In plain terms, if you have to beat Australia, you have to bring your best game to the park. 

Unlike the West Indies or a few other teams in world cricket right now, the Australian team rarely has a collective bad day. One or two individuals may have an off day, but there are always others to take up the slack. 

Every sport, at one time or another, has witnessed a period of dominance by a team or an individual. If it was the West Indies in the 1980s, it was golfer Greg Norman in the 1980s and 90s and tennis legend Pete Sampras in the 1990s. 

Some may say that this kind of monopoly harms sport, but I would say the reverse. You cant blame a team or a sportsperson for being head and shoulders above the rest. I would say that they do their sport a service by forcing opponents to try and be better than they are. And I would say that is the purpose that the Australians are serving at present.

 Players chief backs Gayle

London: Players chief Dinanath Ramnarine has questioned the decision of the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) to reprimand Chris Gayle for a diary published on a cricket website, saying the opening batsman had received clearance for the June 21 article from team manager Michael Findlay. 

The WICB said Tuesday it was censuring Gayle for his totally unacceptable conduct in criticising the handling of his selection as one-day captain and the late arrival of players for warm-up games ahead of the upcoming series with England. 

However, Ramnarine, chief executive of the West Indies Players Association, said Gayle had, as required, submitted his article to Findlay, who edited and approved it. 

It seems difficult to understand why Gordon and Findlay would demand an apology for comments approved by Findlay, Ramnarine said. (AFP)

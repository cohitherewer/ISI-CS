 WI have chance to rally round a new leader

Christopher Martin-Jenkins

 Ramnaresh Sarwan is the frontrunner to take over from Brian Lara 

The enforced retirement of Brian Lara has done nothing to solve the internal wrangles tormenting West Indies cricket. The tour to England is due to start in a fortnight, but on this biggest day in the distinguished history of cricket in Barbados, there has been no decision on who succeeds Lara as captain, nor on who takes over from Bennett King as coach, nor on the dispute over what an as yet unselected team will earn from the tour. 

Debate about the relative merits of Ramnaresh Sarwan, thought to be the choice of the official selection committee, and Daren Ganga, preferred by the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) chairman, Ken Gordon, will have to be resolved during a meeting of the WICB in Bridgetown on Sunday. The team for England is expected to be picked on Tuesday and announced on Wednesday. 

Ganga, a technically correct opening batsman known for his sound Christian principles and thoughtful captaincy of Trinidad amp; Tobago, the Carib Beer champions, has a Test average of only 27 and has never fully established himself in the team. Sarwan certainly has, but is thought by some to be too much in the mould of his predecessor when it comes to leading a relaxed life off the field. 

According to several former West Indies players, a lack of discipline, both on the field and off it, has plagued the West Indies team in the period leading up to the resignation of their Australian coach. 

Sarwan had one significant voice in his support on Friday: Viv Richards, not only the former captain and dominant batsman in an almost invincible team during the 1980s but also chairman of selectors in Gus Logies period as coach, said it was right that Sarwan, the vice-captain, should take over from Lara. 

When I was chairman of the selection panel [until June 2004], we did nominate Sarwan, but something took place then, I dont wish to say what, Richards said. I felt he had respect. Just like a honeycomb, all the other players felt comfortable around him. 

Richards said that Ganga would be his choice as vice-captain, but added: I hope its not other way around, Ganga and Sarwan. Why should we have to jump over Sarwans head to get someone else? Its right [that] the individual who has been in place for quite some time gets it. 

Bruce Aanensen, the WICB chief executive, said that ability and not nationality will dictate who succeeds King, the first overseas coach of West Indies, who took over from Logie in 2005. King is staying in the Caribbean until the end of May to complete the establishment of a regional cricket academy. 

Since losing all four Tests in England three seasons ago, West Indies have reached two ICC Champions Trophy finals, winning the first in England in September 2004, but Test success has remained elusive. They have won only three and lost 23 of their past 37 Test matches. 

Pay and sponsorship disputes between the players, represented by Dinanath Ramnarine, the militant former Trinidad and West Indies leg spinner, and the WICB have also been a recurring problem. 

Terms for the tour of England remain unresolved less than three weeks before the scheduled start of the first Test at Lords on May 17. Talks between the WICB and the West Indies Players Association broke down last weekend. The issue has been sent to arbitration, with a verdict expected at the end of next week. 

According to Ramnarine, the WICB, which had for many months acknowledged that the tour was outside the ICCs Future Tours Programme and as such subject to separate negotiation, suddenly changed tack and claimed that it was, after all, covered by existing agreements. 

Since a Memorandum of Understanding was signed by the two parties last year, almost every tour contract has ended up being sent to arbitration. Sad to say, there is almost as much chaos in West Indies cricket at present as there is at the check-in desk of an inter-island flight on Liat. But a return to better days is by no means beyond the reach of determined men. 

World-class cricketing facilities are widespread as a result of the World Cup, the coming academy should bring the best out of young talent and at least some performances in Laras third and last phase as captain suggested that England will have a fight in the coming weeks if a reshaped team rallies round new leadership.

 Absence of stars played down 

Karachi: The Karachi City Cricket Association (KCCA), which is hosting the four-day Nissar Trophy Challenge match between Mumbai and Karachi, has played down the absence of stars in the visiting team. 

KCCA secretary Sirajulislam Bukhari said that he could understand the problems faced by the visiting team. 

Obviously we would have liked to see some big names in their team to attract the crowds. But the main thing is the team represents Mumbai and they are playing in Karachi which is a big thing, he said. 

The team got a lukewarm response on arrival and the match begins on Satur- day. (PTI)

 Harbhajan keen to make a mark for Surrey 

 Harbhajan Singh 

London: Harbhajan Singh says he would not let his prime goal of getting back into Team India distract him from his immediate task of helping Surrey get promoted to the top division of County Championships. 

The Punjab off-spinner, overlooked by the national selectors for the tour of England, said the presence of the Indian team on the English soil made it all the more important for him to do well for Surrey. 

Its great to play my cricket over here because the Indian side are in the country too at the moment. If I do get the call from India Ill play and take some wickets for them, but at the moment Im just looking to take Surrey to the next level, he said. 

Once I found out I was not part of the Indian team touring England I made a few calls to local people over here and they were very keen to have me back, Harbhajan was quoted as saying by a local website on Saturday. 

I know its not been a great season for Surrey so far but there is still a lot of cricket to go. Im sure if we play some quality stuff we should be able to turn the table around. Weve got the team that can win games, weve done it before. 

This is a great opportunity for me. Im just going to go out and play the way that I can play and try and get lots and lots of wickets for my team, said the 27-year-old, who has taken 238 wickets and scored 986 runs in 57 Test matches. 

 Harbhajan had an immediate impact by helping the former champions to a six-wicket victory over Durham this week.

 Tirkey steals show for Steelers

Chennai: Orissa Steelers scraped past Hyderabad Sultans by a solitary Dilip Tirkey goal, but the second phase match in the 2007 Premier Hockey League failed to rise to any high standards. 

Even with six foreign stars in two teams, the match at the Mayor Radhakrishna Stadium was eventful only in the sense that three players received yellow cards for unfair play. 

With this win, Orissa Steelers have tallied eight points from four matches, while Hyderabad Sultans remain at three from as many games.

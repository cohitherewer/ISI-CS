 Buchanan salutes the perfect team

Bridgetown: Retiring Australia coach John Buchanan said it was his nations destiny to be at the cutting edge of cricket after they had won a third straight World Cup title. 

Australias 53-run victory over Sri Lanka meant his players gave the 54-year-old Buchanan a winning send-off after eight years in charge. 

Although supervising a gifted side, Buchanan has been credited with extending the teams horizons. Buchanan had challenged the rest of the world to match Australias standards after they beat India in the 2003 Cup final in Johannesburg. 

But while now reluctant to pass on tips to other nations, Buchanan was clear where the sporting future of Australia whose Institute of Sport in Canberra has been a template for many countries lay. 

I think its our role always to lead change, to lead new ideas to be right at the cutting edge of cricket or of sport in fact. Then its up to other countries to try to chase us, Buchanan added. 

India and the West Indies are among two leading sides looking for new coaches after World Cup failures. But Buchanan said he had no interest in becoming the latest Australian to take charge of another country. I suppose you can never say never, but right at the moment no. Right at the moment Im looking to venture into new territory altogether. 

Buchanan said the key to Australias enduring success began with the players. Each individual has strived for perfection all the time. From a coachs point of view, that is the perfect team. The perfect team is the one that keeps wanting to be better day in and day out. Ive been basically a passenger for the last three years or so. Ive got there (to practise), put the gear out and brought it back in again. 

But captain Ricky Ponting said: We shouldnt let the coach get away with that. Hes challenged us all the whole time hes been in charge of this team. Hes always been overlooked. 

Glenn McGrath was equally effusive in his praise of the outgoing coach. Its not easy to make a very good team still strive to better itself and while a fair credit is due to the players, much of it should go to John. He really pushed us into trying to better ourselves and that would be one of his long-standing legacy. (AFP)

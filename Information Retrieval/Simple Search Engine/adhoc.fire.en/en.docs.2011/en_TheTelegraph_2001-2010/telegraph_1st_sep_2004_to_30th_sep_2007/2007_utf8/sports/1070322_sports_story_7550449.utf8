 Coach Andy picks match vs Black Caps to bid farewell

Gros Islet: With everything going to plan so far in their World Cup campaign, New Zealands greatest problem is ensuring they dont get too carried away. 

The Black Caps 148-run win over Kenya on Tuesday sealed their berth in the Super Eight. That means they can take it easy in Thursdays final group game against Canada. 

Im really excited to qualify, Fleming said. It steps up a gear when you get to the Super Eight and to be there amongst it and taking points through is exactly how we like it. The main thing is not to get too carried away with the positives. Were ticking along nicely 

Not so for Canada. They have lost both matches and are out of contention at the World Cup. 

The New Zealand game gives Canada a chance to say farewell to coach Andy Pick, who decided to step down after a year in charge of the side because of a contracts dispute. 

Pick, a 43-year-old Englishman, has one month left of a yearlong contract with the Canadian Cricket Association, but negotiations to extend it fell through. Circumstances have conspired against us, Pick said on Tuesday. Pick is returning to his old job as Englands under-19 coach and expects to start work in April. 

The match could also be a farewell for some of the older members of the Canada squad 40-year-olds George Codrington, Anderson Cummins and 38-year-old Sunil Dhaniram. 

Despite the opportunity to take it easy, New Zealand will be keen to make it three wins from three. Fast bowler Shane Bond will be rested, and so will batsman Ross Taylor, who hit a MoM-winning 85 on Tuesday despite struggling late in his innings with a hamstring strain and needing a runner. That means batsman Peter Fulton would start against Canada. 

Daryl Tuffey is likely to replace Bond. Spinner Jeetan Patel could also return. Its a great opportunity that weve afforded ourselves by qualifying, Fleming said. 

Opener Lou Vincent will again start, hoping to get his World Cup tally off the mark after failing to score against England and Canada.

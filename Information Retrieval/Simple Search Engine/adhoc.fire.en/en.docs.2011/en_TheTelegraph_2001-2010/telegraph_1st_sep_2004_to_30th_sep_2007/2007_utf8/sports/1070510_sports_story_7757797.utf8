 Trescothick rules out immediate return

Paul Bolton

Marcus Trescothick ruled himself out of an immediate return to Englands Test team despite making his first century of the season, a superb unbeaten 185, for Somerset against Northants in the County Championship on Tuesday. 

Trescothick is still working to overcome the stress-related complaint which forced him to return home early from the Test series in India and Australia last year. 

Though Trescothick looked in fine form in front of England selector Geoff Miller at Northampton on Tuesday, he said it was too early to be considered for an international return in the Test series against West Indies, which begins at Lords next week. 

I need a few more knocks like that and for my form to continue over a good period of time, Trescothick said. 

I would play tomorrow if I thought that I was fit enough. But there are a few more hurdles for me to overcome before I am at that stage. Trescothick, who has been included in Englands 25-strong performance squad for this summers Tests and one-day Internationals, has not formally notified the selectors of his unavailability. 

I have had a few conversations on the phone, but I have not had anyone ask if I am available, he said. 

Ive stated my position a number of times in media interviews and I had a chat with Michael Vaughan last week, so I think they know what the position is.

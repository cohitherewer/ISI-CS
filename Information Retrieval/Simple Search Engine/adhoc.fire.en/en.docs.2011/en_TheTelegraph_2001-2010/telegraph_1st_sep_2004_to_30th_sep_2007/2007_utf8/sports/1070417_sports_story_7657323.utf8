 Woolmer made no difference: Razzaq 

 Bob Woolmer

Dubai: Pakistans Abdul Razzaq has criticised their late coach Bob Woolmer, saying he was only interested in keeping his job and his tenure made no difference to the team, according to a newspaper report. 

Razzaq, kept out of the World Cup by an injury, said he knew it was not right to pass remarks about a dead person, but that he did not regret speaking the truth even if it sounded unkind. 

In my opinion, Bob was a very shrewd operator. He was a coach just by nature of his job. Bob knew how to spend his time. For me, he must surely be one of the cleverest Britishers. On the surface he acted Asian but inside he was only interested in keeping his job, irrespective of victory or defeat, he was quoted as saying. Bob knew the art of how to get his way out. His main objective was to earn money and nothing else. His being coach made no difference to the team, he said. 

Razzaq was also critical of 2003 national team coach, South African Richard Pybus, under whom Pakistan had performed poorly in the last World Cup. Richard was not a coach. He was merely a trainer and got the job through manoeuvring, he said. 

He believed that Pakistan should have a local coach because the experiment of hiring foreigners have failed miserably despite spending huge sums of money. 

Razzaq admitted that the teams performance in the World Cup has caused immense damage to the game in the country and it might take sometime to regain past status as one of the best teams of the world.

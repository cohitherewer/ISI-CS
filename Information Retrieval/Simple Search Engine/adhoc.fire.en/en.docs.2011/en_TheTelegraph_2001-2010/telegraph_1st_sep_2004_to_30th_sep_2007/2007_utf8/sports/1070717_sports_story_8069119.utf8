 Argentina U-20 in semi-finals

Ottawa: Maximiliano Moralez scored the lone goal in first-half injury time as Argentina kept alive their bid for a second consecutive title at the under-20 World Cup with a 1-0 quarter final victory over Mexico. 

It was Argentinas second victory over Mexico in an international competition in five days after the senior side beat them 3-0 in the semi-finals of the Copa America on Wednesday. 

The 1.60-metre Moralezs shot from the top of the penalty area took a deflection off a defender and wrong-footed Mexico goalkeeper Alfonso Blanco just before half time in an entertaining match played before a crowd of 26,500. 

Argentina moved a step closer to adding to their record five titles at the tournament. 

 They, have conceded only one goal in five games and will face Chile in the semi-finals on Thursday. 

The Chileans beat Nigeria 4-0 in extra time earlier on Sunday in Montreal. 

Meanwhile, in the other semi-final in Edmonton, Austria and the Czech Republic face each other on Wednesday. 

Argentina played their group-stage games in Ottawa and enjoyed tremendous crowd support, however, fans turned out in equal support for the Mexicans on Sunday. Both teams were in an attacking mood from the beginning and Argentinas Angel di Maria, starting at forward in place of Mauro Zarate, tested Blanco with a drive that the keeper tipped over the bar. 

Blanco was pressed into action again on the ensuing corner, blocking a header from close range. 

 Spanish referee Alberto Undiano Mallenco ignored Mexicos appeal for a handball inside the box when a cross appeared to make contact with a defenders arm. Moments after that, Vela swivelled on a ball at the top of the box and unleashed a volley that beat Romero only to strike the post. 

Moralez finally made the breakthrough with virtually the final kick of the half. 

A minute into stoppage time, the tiny winger took a pass from Di Maria at the top of the 18-yard box and let fly with a shot that changed directions off the thigh of a Mexican defender and sent Blanco going the wrong way. (AP)

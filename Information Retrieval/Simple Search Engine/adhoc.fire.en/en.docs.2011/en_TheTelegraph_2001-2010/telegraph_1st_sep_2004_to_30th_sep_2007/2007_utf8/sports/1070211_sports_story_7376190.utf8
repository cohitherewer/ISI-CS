 Arjun Atwal in 40th place

Pebble Beach (California): A disastrous back nine by Arjun Atwal saw him return a round of three-over 75 and slip from overnight fourth to 40th after the second day of the AT amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. 

After a 67 at Pebble Beach course in first round, Atwal carded a three-over-par 75 that included three bogeys and a double bogey besides two birdies, to be two-under for 36 holes at spyglass. 

Swede of Indian origin Daniel Chopra improved with a 70 aided by a stunning eagle on 18th on his ninth hole at Pebble Beach Course after opening with a 71 to lie in 29th place. 

The event was led by Jim Furyk and Phil Mickelson, who were both at 12-under 132 after two rounds of the event that is played over three different courses. 

World No. 2 Furyk started from the tenth and closed with birdies on his last three holes to compile a seven-under 65 at Poppy Hills. Mickelson had seven birdies in his 67 at Pebble Beach. 

Among other Asian Tour players, South Koreas Charlie Wi shot a 69 for tied 71st place, while compatriot Choi Kyung-ju returned a 72. (PTI)

 Tours set to bury hatchet

Kuala Lumpur: The Asian Tour and European Tour are closer to mending ties after a bitter dispute over two tournaments but major differences remain, a leading Asian official said. 

Gerry Norquist, the Asian Tours senior vice president, said the two bodies are working towards an agreement over events in India and South Korea on next years European Tour calendar. 

Asian Tour officials had accused their rivals of colonialism after the Europeans sanctioned events on local turf without approval from the regional governing body. 

Norquist said the issue was brought up at Julys meeting of the International Federation of PGA Tours at Carnoustie. The European Tour admitted that they had breached protocol and that was satisfactory to the Asian Tour, Norquist said, during the Johor Open. 

We have been involved in dialogue and all I can say is that we are probably in a better position now than we were then, but we still havent resolved the issue. 

The Indian Masters is a $2.5 million event slated for February next year while the Korean tournament is scheduled for March in Jeju. 

Norquist said the main issue is the number of places to be allocated for players from each tour. The current nine tournaments sanctioned by both bodies allow for a 50-50 split between European and Asian-based players. 

A standard tournament features between 144 and 156 players while the proposed Indian and Korean events are reported to offer only 120 places.

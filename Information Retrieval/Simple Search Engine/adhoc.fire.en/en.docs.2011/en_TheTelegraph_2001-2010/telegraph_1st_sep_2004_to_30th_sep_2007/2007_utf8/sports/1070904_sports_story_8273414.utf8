 Bagan slap notice on Partha

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan on Monday slapped a legal notice on middle-order batsman Partha Sarathi Bhatttacharjee, alleging he had withdrawn in favour of Shambazar in the inter-club transfers despite taking money from them. 

Mohun Bagan officials also sent a copy of the legal notice to the CAB. 

Utpal Chatterjee returned to the Mohun Bagan fold following his association with Sporting Union. 

Shib Shankar Paul signed in favour of East Bengal.

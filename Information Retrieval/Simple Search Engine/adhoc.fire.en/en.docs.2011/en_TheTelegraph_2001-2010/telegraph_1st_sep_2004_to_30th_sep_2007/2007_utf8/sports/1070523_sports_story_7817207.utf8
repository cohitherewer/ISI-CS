 Dravid hits out at schedule

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Rahul Dravid 

Chittagong: Rahul Dravid has called for a better plan from the International Cricket Council (ICC) in scheduling matches so that quality of the game does not suffer. 

The Indian captains comment came close on the heels of the rain-marred first Test, which ended in a draw here on Tuesday after over two days were washed out. The third and final ODI between also suffered a similar fate. 

Lamenting over natures intervention, Dravid looked utterly disappointed and said the ICC needs to look into the cramped schedule. 

Ideally, the timing of this series could have been better. But schedules are cramped overcramped if you ask me so I dont know how we are going to fit everything in, Dravid said after the match on Tuesday. 

The solution to this problem is that we have to get the scheduling right. We should try and get a certain number of Tests and ODIs and ensure we dont exceed that number. At the end of the day, quality is important and as an international player you want to provide quality cricket to people, he added. 

On his sporting declaration, which brought life into the match on the final day, Dravid admitted it was a gamble. 

When so much time was lost due to rain, we wanted to give some a sporting target. We hoped they would play positively and play for the target. But they played sensibly in the end, he said. 

Though he defended the bowlers on a batting-friendly wicket, he said that the inability of enforcing follow-on on Bangladesh was a setback. 

We were definitely in the drivers seat on the first two days. After that it became a stop-and-start game. Probably our only chance was to make them follow on, but the ninth wicket partnership between two Bangladesh bowlers (Mashrafe Mortaza and Shahadat Hossain) denied us that opportunity, he pointed out. 

The Indian captain was all praise for Mortaza. Bangladesh are lucky to have such a cricketer. He did well in the World Cup and he is developing as a genuine allrounder. 

Dravid also ruled out handing any psychological advantage to Bangladesh after letting them off the hook. 

We will start 0-0 in the next game and thats the reality, he remarked.

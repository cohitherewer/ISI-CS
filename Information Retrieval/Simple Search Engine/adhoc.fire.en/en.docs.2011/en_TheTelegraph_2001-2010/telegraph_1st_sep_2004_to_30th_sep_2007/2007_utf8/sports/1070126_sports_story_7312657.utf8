The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Im anxious: Yuvraj

 - Left-hander heard of selection from mother 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Yuvraj Singh 

Lucknow: Yuvraj Singh was at the New Delhi airport, waiting for a flight to Mumbai, when mother Shabnam called to say hed been selected for the last two ODIs versus the West Indies. 

It ended a long wait. That the top bracket left-hander could be picked for Chennai (January 27) and Vadodara (January 31) was first reported in these columns last week. 

Yuvraj, however, confessed he was anxious about his comeback match in Chennai. Hed, of course, been targeting the last two ODIs. 

To be honest, Im anxious... I havent played competitive cricket for three months... Having said that, Im one hundred per cent fit, both in the mind and physically, Yuvraj told The Telegraph. 

Asked about the pressure-factor as no comeback is easy, he replied: Its part of the game... Pressure is always there... What matters is how you keep it within manageable limits... Despite the anxiety, Im confident of doing well. 

Yuvraj felt Team India must build on the unbeatable 2-0 lead and continue to play with the intensity seen in Nagpur and Cuttack. 

Incidentally, his last India appearance had been against the same opposition, in the Champions Trophy. The knee injury occurred a couple of days after that, during a training session in Mohali. 

Yuvraj, who was one of the nominees for the ICCs ODI Player of the Year (2005-06) award, has the status of a key member and his performances are bound to have an impact on our campaign in the forthcoming World Cup. 

Hes expected to reach Chennai on Friday morning.

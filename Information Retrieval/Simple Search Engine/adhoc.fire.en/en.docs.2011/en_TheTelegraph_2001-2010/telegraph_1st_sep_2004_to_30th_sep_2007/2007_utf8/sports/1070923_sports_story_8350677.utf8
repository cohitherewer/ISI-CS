 Shoaib Malik dreams big

Cape Town: Having led Pakistan to the final of the inaugural ICC World Twenty20, captain Shoaib Malik said he wanted to gift the nation with the trophy in the holy month of Ramazan. 

Every captain dreams of taking his team to a World Cup final and I feel the same way, Malik said. We will try to win the final and give this gift to the nation in the holy month of Ramadan which is blessed with showers from the Almighty. 

A half-century by Imran Nazir and three wickets from paceman Umar Gul helped Pakistan beat New Zealand by six wickets with seven balls to spare on Saturday. Malik (26 not out) finished the contest in style by hammering off-spinner Jeetan Patel over mid-wicket for six. 

For New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori, it was yet another taste of semi-final defeat. 

Its bitterly disappointing this is the worst Ive felt for a long time. It was yet another opportunity to reach the final of a major event and we thought we could win, he said. 

We were a lot more relaxed than before several other semi-finals but we couldnt get across the line. Unfortunately were bound to be labelled with the tag of not being able to reach finals, Vettori added. (Agencies)

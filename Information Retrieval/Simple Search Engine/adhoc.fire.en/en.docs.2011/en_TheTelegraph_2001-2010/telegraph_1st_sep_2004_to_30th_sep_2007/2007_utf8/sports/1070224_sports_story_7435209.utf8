The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Decent start by Arjun Atwal 

Playa del Carmen (Mexico): Arjun Atwal fired a three-under 67 in the first round of the Mayakoba Golf Classic to lie 14th, five shots behind leader Fred Funk. 

The Indian showed signs of returning to form after an indifferent season plagued a back injury. The tournament is being played at the 6,923-yard El Camaleon, a course Greg Norman designed as a par-72 for tourists, but is par of 70 for the pros. 

Starting on the back nine, Atwal began with a bogey on 10th but recovered with birdies on 12th and 13th to be one-under at the turn. 

Birdies on first and third improved his score further before a bogey on fourth put him back. Atwal closed with a birdie on ninth to finish at three-under 67. 

Atwal has limited starts on PGA Tour this year after finishing outside the top-125 on the money list. 

Funk, who was also eligible for the Champions Tour event opted for the PGA event, and shot five birdies in his first seven holes and finished the day at eight-under 62 to take sole lead. 

The American won the Turtle Bay championship on the Champions Tour (for players over 50 years in age) last month. 

Cameron Beckman was two shots behind at 64 along with George McNeill, John Merrick and boo weekley. Five others were three back at 65. 

This week is a good one for players to put some money in the bank as the top pros are all at the WGC-Accenture match play championship. (PTI)

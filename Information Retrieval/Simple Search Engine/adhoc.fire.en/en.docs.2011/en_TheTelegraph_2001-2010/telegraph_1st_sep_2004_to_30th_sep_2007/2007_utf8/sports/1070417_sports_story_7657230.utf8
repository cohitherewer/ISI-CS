 Ireland qualify for ICC rankings

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Irelands victory over Bangladesh have earned them a place in the ICC ODI championship rankings table. 

Ireland, who had pulled off a major upset against Pakistan in the group stage, prevailed over another Test playing nation as they beat Bangladesh by 74 runs in the Super Eight on Sunday. 

Defeating two full members gave them the right to qualify for the rankings list. 

Irelands name will appear on the official rankings table following their final game in the Super Eight stage of the event, which will take place in Grenada against Sri Lanka on Wednesday, ICC said in a press release. 

Having made up part of the ICC Associate ODI rankings, Ireland now graduate to the ICC ODI Championship after defeating two full members, in accordance with the qualification regulations. 

Once an associate has played at least 10 ODIs, it has the opportunity to be promoted to the main table. 

To gain this promotion, the associate must either achieve two wins against full members, as Ireland have done against Pakistan and Bangladesh, or achieve one win against a full member and also have won more than 60 per cent of matches against other associates.

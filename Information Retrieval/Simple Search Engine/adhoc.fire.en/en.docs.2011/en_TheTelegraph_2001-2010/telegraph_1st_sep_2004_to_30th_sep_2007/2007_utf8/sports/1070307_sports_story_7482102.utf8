The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Indias best ever Cup squad: Wadekar

A STAFF REPORTER

 Wadekar in Calcutta on Tuesday 

Calcutta: The 1983 squad may have won the World Cup and the 2003 side may have finished runners-up, but former Indian captain Ajit Wadekar feels that the West Indies-bound XV is Indias best ever World Cup squad. 

Seeing no reason why India should not clinch the World Cup 2007, Wadekar said India are favourites to win the Cup. This is our best ever World Cup squad as we have got the best batting line-up. The team composition is also perfect and, more importantly, we are peaking at the right time. Certainly, we stand favourites to win the final, Wadekar told The Telegraph on the sidelines of Calcutta Open Grandmasters Chess Tournament prize distribution ceremony at Gorky Sadan on Tuesday. He added: Forget the ICC rating, India are the No. 1 team. 

The southpaw clarified how this 2007 squad is better than the Cup-winning one in 1983. We were not doing that well until we picked up the momentum after our match against Zimbabwe. But this side is in good form even before landing in the Caribbean, Wadekar said referring to Indias back-to-back home series wins over Sri Lanka and the West Indies. 

Reacting to chief selector Dilip Vengsarkars remark that Virender Sehwag was in the squad at Rahul Dravids insistence, Wadekar supported the chairman of national selectors and said: The whole thing has been misunderstood. He (Vengsarkar) wanted to be transparent and thats how it should be. In fact, cameramen should also be allowed during the meeting.

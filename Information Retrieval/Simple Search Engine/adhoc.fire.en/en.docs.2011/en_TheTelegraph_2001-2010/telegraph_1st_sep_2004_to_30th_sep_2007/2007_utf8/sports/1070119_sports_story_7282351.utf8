The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Well have to play it by the ear: Greg

 - Yuvraj may feature in last 2 ODIs vs Windies

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Yuvraj Singh and Greg Chappell 

Nagpur: Greg Chappell hasnt ruled out the possibility of Yuvraj Singh being selected for the last two ODIs against the West Indies, in Chennai and Vadodara, later this month. 

Yuvi looked good over the two days at nets... Im happy... Now, he has to get back confidence... Thats important, the Team India coach told The Telegraph on Thursday, after Day II of the build-up towards the four-match series versus Brian Laras men. 

The key player, who injured his left knee on October 29, had his first post-injury training session with teammates on Wednesday. 

Yuvraj, obviously, straightaway did enough to get a confidence-boost from captain Rahul Dravid. The signs are good... He batted well at nets... Now, he has to get the confidence back, is what hed said. 

Confidence, therefore, is requirement No.1. 

Asked if Yuvrajs comeback could actually be sooner than expected, specifically in the latter half of the series which begins here on Sunday, Chappell paused and replied: I think well have to play it by the ear... Right now I really cant say anything with certainty... 

While the second ODI is in Cuttack on January 24, the ones in Chennai and Vadodara are on January 27 and 31, respectively. So far, the squad has only been selected till Cuttack. 

Yuvraj, of course, has already gone on record saying hes aiming to return this month itself. After two days of getting back into the team environment, hes head-ing to Calcutta for a Twenty20 tourna- ment. 

His movements after that arent clear. 

Once the West Indies return home, the Sri Lankans are going to arrive for another four-match ODI series. After that is the real big one the World Cup.

 Besides Galaxy, Becks had no other offers 

 - Hes going to be some sort of film actor: Real president

Madrid: David Beckham chose to join the Los Angeles Galaxy because no other club wanted to sign him, Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon suggested Tuesday. 

The proof that our technical staff was correct not to retain him has been borne out by every other technical staff in the world not wanting him even though he was out of contract, Calderon said on Tuesday. 

David Beckham is going to be some sort of film actor living in Hollywood, he added. 

Calderons comments, which are expected to further sour the relationship between Beckham and the club, suggested it was the clubs decision to get rid of the 31-year-old midfielder even though it had previously offered him a two-year contract extension. 

Calderon also criticised Beckhams conduct on Monday, saying his representatives had toyed with the club. 

The former England captain announced last Thursday he would join the Galaxy on a five-year deal starting in August. Madrid coach Fabio Capello responded two days later by saying Beckham would no longer play for the team now that he has committed to another club, and would only be able to train with his teammates. That has left Beckham with the prospect of no competitive soccer for six months. 

Beckhams spokesman said Monday the midfielder hopes to see out the remaining five and a half months of his contract. Spanish media has suggested that Madrid may try to rescind his contract, although Galaxy general manager Alexi Lalas said the club will wait until August. 

Major League Soccer commissioner Don Garber also denied reports on Monday that the league was trying to secure an early release for Beckham from his Real Madrid contract. 

Spanish media had quoted Garber saying Beckhams lawyers were working to get an amicable exit because the league was unable to pay the buy-out clause to bring him to the Los Angeles Galaxy before his contract ends in June. 

Beckham, who trained with the team and then attended a players lunch at a restaurant in Madrid on Tuesday, hasnt won a major trophy since joining the club from Manchester United in 2003. 

Rijkaards views 

Meanwhile, Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard said he did not agree with Capellos policy of barring Beckham from playing for Real Madrid after the midfielder decided to leave the club for Galaxy. 

In theory I wouldnt sideline the player, Rijkaard was reported as saying in a sports daily on Tuesday. You always have to look to the interests of the team. Everyone wants to win things and if a player has a contract he can still keep on working. 

Rijkaard was in a similar position to Capello when Swede Henrik Larsson agreed a move to home town club Helsingborg in February last year. Despite the striker announcing the move and donning his new teams shirt, Larsson continued to feature regularly at Barcelona and played a decisive role in their victory over Arsenal in the Champions League final.

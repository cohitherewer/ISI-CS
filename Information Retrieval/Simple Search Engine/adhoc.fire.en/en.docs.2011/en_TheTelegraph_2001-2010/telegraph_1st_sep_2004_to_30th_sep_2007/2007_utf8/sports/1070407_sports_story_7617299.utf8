The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We can win it this time: McMillan

Georgetown: New Zealand allrounder Craig McMillan is already considering retiring from the sport as he feels the hectic cricket schedule has taken a toll on his body. It can be a rollercoaster at times, the 30-year-old told reporters on Thursday. 

Im not going to put a time on anything but there is a good chance this could be my last World Cup. Ive been going since I was 20 so thats close to 10 years and it has been a long time. I would love to finish on a high at this World Cup with a very good side. 

McMillan felt that the crammed international calendar has done the players no favours and could end up shortening careers of top class athletes. 

There is a lot more cricket played these days. Its something they (the cricket boards and International Cricket Council) need to look at because combined with the Test tours it can get very tough, he said. 

Maybe you will get guys just playing one form of the game. That might be a way to sustain yourself and stay involved for the last two or three years of your career, maybe forgoing one-dayers so they can play Test cricket for the last two or three years. 

But before he sets a date for his final match, McMillan would like nothing better than to guide the Black Caps to their first world title in the Caribbean. 

From a personal point of view Ive really enjoyed this World Cup... so Im hoping to contribute to what will hopefully be a special tournament for New Zealand, McMillan said. 

In two previous World Cups, New Zealand wanted to win but I am not sure if they believed they could do it. Now there is confidence in the squad if someone gets injured others could step in equally well. 

New Zealand, along with champions Australia, remain unbeaten in the Caribbean and are expected to take one of the last four spots in the 16-team competition. 

He said it was very satisfying that they already had six points in the Super Eight and was confident the four-times semi-finalists could progress to their first final. 

 One of our strengths is that we bat low down and were strong in the last 10 overs and I think that will become prevalent in the last few games of the tournament, he said. 

McMillan still didnt want to take his eyes off tough opponents in days ahead and along with Australia, he termed Sri Lanka as equally dangerous. Sri Lanka are a very difficult side. Because of the low, slow nature of pitches similar to Sri Lankan conditions, they have the advantage. 

The strength for them has been Sanath Jayasuriya at the top of the order. He has been in great form in this tournament. In the final overs, Malinga and Murali make things very difficult. 

New Zealand had trouble negotiating Sri Lanka when they toured them last December and barely managed to save the series 2-2. Muralidharan, in particular, played a critical role, taking seven wickets in four games at a miserly average of 14.86. 

I thought I used to read Murali well. When I played against him in New Zealand, I noticed a couple of variations in doosra and he bowls a lot quicker than he used to. Earlier he used to be a lot slower, now he is more difficult, he said. 

New Zealand next play debutants Ireland on Monday. 

Meanwhile, Ireland allrounder Andre Botha is doubtful for that match after injuring his hamstring during training on Friday. 

Botha, a crucial player with his mediumpacers and useful contributions in the middle order, hurt his right hamstring while playing rugby at the Everest Cricket Club in Georgetown.

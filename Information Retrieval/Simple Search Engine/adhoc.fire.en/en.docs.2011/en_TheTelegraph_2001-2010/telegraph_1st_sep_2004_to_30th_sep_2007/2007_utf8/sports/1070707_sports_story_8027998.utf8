Calcutta/Mumbai: Bengal batsman Manoj Tiwary is hopeful of making it to the 30-member probables for the Twenty20 World Championship in South Africa in September. The selectors will announce the 30-man list on Saturday. 

Tiwary still requires few more weeks to regain full fitness. The Bengal batsman, who was operated on his injured right shoulder at a London hospital, last May, sounded optimistic about his selection for the Twenty20 cricket extravaganza. 

The 21-year old Bengal batsman injured himself during a practice session before Indias first ODI in Dhaka, in May. I am 100 percent hopeful of making a comeback, a confident Tiwary said on Friday evening. I have started weight training and shoulder exercises which have really helped me improving fast. From Monday I will start throwing the ball, informed Manoj, who is under the supervision of Bengal physio Piyush Singh. 

I am in regular touch with John Gloster and he is very happy with my progress, he said further adding, I will be fully fit by the end of this month. 

The CAB president Prasun Mukherjee however, opined that Tiwary is still not fit for selection. Nobody cant regain fitness so quickly He has only started regaining it and requires more time to be fully match-fit, Mukherjee said. As soon as he will be fit we will inform the board. But before that Gloster will be informed, Mukherjee further added. 

Meanwhile, former Indian opener Virender Sehwag and off-spinner Harbhajan Singh along with left-arm pacer Irfan Pathan and Munaf Patel are also in the running. 

Sehwag lost his spot in the one-day squad after the Bangladesh tour while Harbhajan is out of the side in both forms of the game. Harbhajan and has been replaced by Ramesh Powar after the World Cup. 

While Sehwag has tried to regain his touch in a local tournament in Delhi, Harbhajan has preferred the English county cricket route to parade his regain his lost momentum. 

Both these players have failed to find a berth in the Test squad for England as well as the preceding one-day offshore ties in Ireland and Scotland. Among others likely to be selected is young Uttar Pradesh batsman Suresh Raina. 

Selection panel chief Dilip Vengsarkar hinted that the players recovering from injuries required to prove their fitness and cited competitions like the Buchi Babu tournament in Chennai as vehicles to do so. 

Power-hitters like Barodas Yousuf Pathan and Karnatakas B. Akhil are likely to be in the 30. The list will be pruned to 15 on or before August 11, a month before the Twenty20 World Championship. 

The selectors will also pick the India A squad for Indias twin tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya starting later this month.

 Musharraf to blame: Imran

 Imran Khan in Karachi on Saturday 

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Imran Khan on Saturday held the countrys President, Pervez Musharraf, responsible for the present cricket crisis and insisted that there was an urgent need to dissociate the Presidents office from cricket affairs. 

The iconic Imran, rated as an all-time top allrounder in world cricket and one of the best captains the game has ever seen, said since Musharraf took over as President and chief patron of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), the crisis had deepened. 

In 1999, when he came into power, Pakistan were losing World Cup finalists. Since then, he has changed four chairmen of the Board and yet we have been ousted from the 2003 and 2007 World Cups in the first round itself, Imran said. 

Imran, who led Pakistan to their lone World Cup title in 1992, said Pakistan cricket would not improve unless the President stopped appointing the chairman and until it didnt revert back to a constitutional and elected system of governance. 

In no country does the President interfere in the cricket Board. Why should this happen in Pakistan? he said. 

Like the rest of the institutions in Pakistan, Musharraf is responsible for the crisis in cricket, said Imran, who is also a member of the national Assembly. 

Imran also offered his services to revive and restructure the cricket set-up in Pakistan. 

Those people who only look for positions or jobs in the Board should not be consulted in cricketing matters. I have no desire to hold any position in the PCB and I am willing to offer my expertise and advice to bring about improvement in Pakistan cricket, he said. 

Imran also advised the Board to stop thinking about choosing a foreigner to succeed coach Bob Woolmer. 

As far as the captaincy is concerned, obviously since Younis Khan has been groomed for this responsibility, he should be made the captain in place of Inzamam-ul Haq. And I would suggest the name of Aaqib Javed as coach, he said. 

Imran said Aaqib, a former Test mediumpacer who played a lead role in the 92 World Cup win, was the choice on merit as he had led Pakistan to two ICC youth World Cup titles in recent years. 

The best thing would also be to appoint a full time professional batting coach to assist him, he said. 

Imran said he was surprised to learn that Woolmer, who died in Kingston last Sunday, had been murdered. 

I thought he must have died of natural causes, but to learn he was murdered came as a shock to me. Because I dont understand why anyone would want to kill him, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Liverpool let in 6 goals

London: Brazilian forward Julio Baptista scored four goals as Arsenal thumped Liverpool 6-3 in their League Cup quarter final at Anfield on Tuesday, three days after knocking them out of the FA Cup at the same venue. 

Both teams made nine changes from Saturdays line-ups but it was the callow Arsenal side that swept into a 5-1 lead early in the second half thanks to a hattrick by Baptista. 

Steven Gerrard inspired a fightback to 5-3 with a wonderful volley but Liverpools late charge was ended by a fourth Baptista strike, who had managed only one previous goal since his August arrival from Real Madrid. 

The stunning victory earned Arsenal a semi-final meeting with north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur and left manager Arsene Wenger purring. 

It was the first time Liverpool had conceded six goals at home for 76 years and their woeful night was made worse by serious-looking injuries to Chile winger Mark Gonzalez and his replacement Luis Garcia. 

Liverpool were booed off at the break but the crowd got a lift 10 minutes after the restart when Dudek saved a Baptista penalty. (Reuters)

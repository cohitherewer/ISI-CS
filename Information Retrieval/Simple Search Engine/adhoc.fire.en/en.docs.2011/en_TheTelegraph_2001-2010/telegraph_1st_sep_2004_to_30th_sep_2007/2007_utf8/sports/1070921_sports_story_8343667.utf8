The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We find ways to lose, says Smith

Durban: South Africas poor luck in major tournaments continued as they were knocked out of the ICC World Twenty20 on Thursday. The hosts, previously unbeaten in the competition, again proved masters of the choke, falling 10 short of the 126 that would have taken them to the last four and eliminated New Zealand. 

South Africa had crashed out of the World Cup in 2003 at home on a disappointing note as well. 

Rohit Sharma was named Man of the Match, but Rudra Pratap Singh was the hero with a four-wicket haul. 

The following is what the players had to say after India won by 37 runs: 

MAHENDRA SINGH DHONI: We played professional cricket I thought we had enough runs on the board to defend What we needed was a good startThings happened according to plan as RP bowled brilliantly. No doubt, we missed Yuvraj We dont have his replacement in the side. We werent too worried about the grass as we have decent pacers in the side They have it in them to compete with the best We dont know what is going on in India and if the Twenty20 will be a hit there 

GRAEME SMITH: Its very disappointing. We have played fantastic cricket in the tournament but today India did well and were the deserving winners. We knew we had to get 126 to qualify Getting 150 was going to be tough because the wicket was doing a bit. We have got to take it in our stride and come out better from here. Its unfortunate that we seem to find ways to lose in big tournaments. 

ROHIT SHARMA (MoM): I just aimed to go out and bat according to the situation I have played in these conditions and so there was no real worry in my mind. There was a lot happening in the wicket and I was confident that our bowlers could win it for us. We have worked hard on our fielding and it showed on the field today. 

Meanwhile, a swollen left elbow prevented Yuvraj from taking the field on Thursday. He, however, will be available for the semi-final on Saturday. 

The dashing left-hander struck six sixes in a Stuart Broad over on Wednesday evening en route to the fastest 50 in Twenty20 Internationals. 

According to administrative manager Sunil Dev, Yuvraj was taken for an X-ray on Thursday afternoon. It did not reveal any damage. 

Yuvraj will be available for the semi-final, Dev said. 

Interviewed on television while the match was on, Yuvraj said as much. 

Theres a big series coming up against Australia. So we decided not to take a risk as playing (on Thursday) couldve aggravated things I will be available for the semis, he said. 

Dhoni said: He was having trouble with the sore arm, so we decided not to take a risk. 

Dinesh Karthik took Yuvrajs place in the XI. 

Fast bowler Makhaya Ntini, who missed South Africas win over New Zealand on Wednesday with a stomach virus, returned to action replacing Andre Nel.

 I didnt do anything wrong: Materazzi 

Rome: Inter Milans Marco Materazzi claims he did not provoke Gennaro Delvecchio before being head-butted by the Sampdoria midfielder in their fractious Serie A match. 

Materazzi was the man infamously butted in the chest by Zinedine Zidane in the World Cup final last year, but on that occasion he admitted to winding up the French superstar. 

This time, however, Materazzi, who reacted angrily when Delvecchio caught Inter keeper Julio Cesar with a late challenge, insisted he did nothing wrong. 

My reaction was instinctive and all I wanted to do was protect my keeper, said the 33-year-old who lay on the ground as Delvecchio was sent off. 

I went over to say to him what do you think youre doing? He then pushed me and I didnt go down. Then he head-butted me and I fell to the ground. He hurt my lip. 

I admit it when I make a mistake, but on this occasion I didnt do anything wrong. 

Sampdoria coach Walter Novellino refused to make excuses for Delvecchios assault. A professional player cannot do such a thing and I wont try to defend it, he said. Even if there was provocation his actions cannot be justified.

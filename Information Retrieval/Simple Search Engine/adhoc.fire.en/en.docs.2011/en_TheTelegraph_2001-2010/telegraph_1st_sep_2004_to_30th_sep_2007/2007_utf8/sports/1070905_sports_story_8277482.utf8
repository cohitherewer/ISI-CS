 PCB warns of long bans

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has once again called on players joining the rebel Indian Cricket League to rethink their decision or be prepared for long-term bans. 

PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf said ICL rebels Inzamam-ul Haq, Mohammed Yousuf, Imran Farhat and Abdul Razzaq could be banned, if they did not change their decision. 

I am advising them to refrain from playing in this controversial ICL or they can face long bans, Ashraf said. 

I also want to make it clear that the PCB is not toeing the line of the BCCI on ICL. We dont recognise this league, Ashraf told a daily. 

Meanwhile, a board source said that some players from Pakistan have given inflated figures of offers made to them by the ICL to get more benefits from the PCB. 

Ashraf said the board was dependent on players for revenues from television rights and could not afford to let them play in a private league. 

Farhat, meanwhile, has vowed to fight a legal notice served on him by the PCB for signing up with the ICL. 

I dont understand this notice. I have received this notice and my lawyer will now respond to it appropriately. I am not going to back down from my stand, Farhat said.

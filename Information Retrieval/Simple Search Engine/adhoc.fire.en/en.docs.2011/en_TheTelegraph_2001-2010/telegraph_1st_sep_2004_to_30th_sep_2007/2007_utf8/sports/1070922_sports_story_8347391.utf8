 Akram wants Shoaib back 

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram is willing to turn a blind eye to the disciplinary transgressions of controversial fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar and wants to see him back in the national side. 

Shoaib was sent home from the ICC World Twenty20 meet by the team management after he struck fellow pacer Mohammed Asif with a bat. 

Look, such fights take place in any team and dressing room. When I was in the team as player and captain, I had a couple of fights and arguments. It is nothing unusual so why make such a big deal out of this one incident, Akram said. 

I dont think it would be fair to keep Shoaib out of the team in the coming series just because of this one incident. He still has something to give to the team and he must be included for the South Africa series, he added. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has said that a disciplinary hearing into the incident would be completed in about two weekss time once the team returns from South Africa and all the players would be questioned. 

Akram felt Akhtar has been punished enough. 

I think this incident should be buried and forgotten and he should be back in the side. Fights even take place in a family. But in our times most of the time such things remained private and within the confines of the dressing room, he said. 

Akram, however, believes Twenty20 cricket could eventually replace one-day Internationals. 

Akram said the success of the ongoing World Twenty20 could have sparked greater interest in the format. 

Twenty20 cricket already has the potential to replace the ODIs as the most popular version of the sport, Akram said on Friday. 

For a cricket lover it is the ideal format. The match finishes in around three-and-half hours and there is plenty of excitement and tension for the spectators and viewers, he said.

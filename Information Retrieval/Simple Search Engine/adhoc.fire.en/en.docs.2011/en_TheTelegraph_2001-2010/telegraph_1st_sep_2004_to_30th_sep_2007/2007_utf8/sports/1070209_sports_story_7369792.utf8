The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We played for pride: Younis 

Durban: Pakistans Younis Khan said his team had regained their pride with an emphatic victory in the second one-day International against South Africa on Wednesday following two crushing defeats. 

We played for pride, said Khan who scored 93 as Pakistan totalled 351 for four and dismissed South Africa for 210 on Wednesday to win by 141 runs and level the five-match series. 

The win followed resounding South African victories in a Twenty20 game, by 10 wickets, and in the first one-day International, by 164 runs. 

The way we lost the Twenty20 game and the way we lost the first one-day, we were hurting, Khan told reporters. 

Its an important series coming so soon before the World Cup, and South Africa are a tough team to play against. They tried their best, but today our planning was better than South Africas. 

He added that Pakistan would not take undue confidence from their win. 

We played well, but today is over and its how we play in the rest of the series that matters now. 

South Africa coach Mickey Arthur seemed as impressed with Pakistans performance as he was disappointed in his teams display. 

Our disciplines were very poor, Arthur told a news conference. We didnt bowl our bouncer properly, and it took 11 overs to bowl the first slower ball. 

They didnt allow us into the game. All credit to them, they were better than us in all departments. 

However, Arthur was not about to lose hope in his players. 

This is probably the wake-up call we needed, he said. Weve carried the same personnel for quite a while, and the guys have delivered. Tonight we just werent up to it.

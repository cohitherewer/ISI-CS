 Karthikeyan to don A1 colours

 - Indian to replace Ebrahim in Taupo 

 Karthikeyan 

New Delhi: A1 team India received a huge boost Tuesday with ace driver Narain Karthikeyan agreeing to race for the team in Taupo, New Zealand, in the A1 GP World Cup of Motorsport event this weekend. 

Im very proud to drive for my country in A1 GP. Ive been following the teams fortunes since the start of the series, said Karthikeyan who has signed up as test driver for Williams F1 in Formula One this season. 

Karthikeyan, however, made it clear that F1 would remain his top priority. Indias first F1 driver will replace Armaan Ebrahim behind the wheels. Frank Williams has kindly agreed for me to race. My Formula 1 testing duties for Williams will always be my number 1 priority. I am very thankful for sir Franks support, he said. 

I am very privileged to be in Formula One, but like all drivers I want to race fast cars as well as drive them. In the recent months, I have had several offers to drive in America and Japan, but I chose A1 GP because the race schedule does not clash with my Formula 1 commitments and it also offers a good financial package for myself. 

I hope that I can help A1 team India improve its performance in A1 GP, as well as heighten its profile back home. 

I know that Im joining the series part way through the second season and many teams have been working with experienced drivers since the start, so we still have ground to make up. 

If I can accelerate the learning curve for the team and we can make progress, scoring some A1 GP World Cup of Motorsport points, Ill be very pleased. 

Its an exciting series with a high level of driver performance and very close, competitive racing. Im looking forward to the challenge and getting behind the wheel of the a1 car for the first time later this week.

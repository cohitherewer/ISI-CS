The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Alarico has it easy

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Alarico, the 5-4 favourite to win the 1,400m Harry The Horse Cup, Thursdays main attraction, gave a hassle-free ride to his jockey Mohammed Islam. 

 Trainer Javed Khans charge travelled in the mid-division till the final turn and Islam just needed to coax the Steinbeck-As Ever son to brush pass the leader, Body And Soul, for a three-length-plus victory over Daniel Davids topweighted runner, Retained Asset.

 Daniel, however, went on to notch up a brace of wins in the remaining races when Majestic Poet and Steal The Glory won their respective events without giving their backers any anxious moments.

 Atwal starts with 1-under

Silvis (US): Arjun Atwal fired two birdies in his last four holes to card a solid one-under 70 in the opening round of the John Deere Classic. 

Atwal, fresh from a third-place finish in a Nationwide Tour event last week, shot five birdies but also had four bogeys that placed him in tied 56th place. 

Daniel Chopra carded a 71 and was tied 76th. He had two birdies and a double bogey. 

American Neal Lancaster (64) was leading the field with a seven-under card and was one clear of Duffy Waldorf, Paul Stankowski, Kenny Perry, Scott Gutschewski and Jason Dufner. 

Atwal is 195th on the money list and is hoping a few good results would give him a shot at a top-125 spot for full PGA playing rights next season. A birdie on the final hole enabled him to finish the round under par. 

He is also 34th on the Nationwide list, from where the top-25 go to the PGA Tour next year. 

Masters champion Zach Johnson shot a 70 to be bunched with Atwal. 

Ranked 15th in the world and the only top-45 player in the field, Johnson started on the 10th hole and birdied the 15th and the 17th. 

The top-10 finishers at this meet will gain berths in the 136th British Open to be held in Carnoustie (Scotland) from July 19-22. (PTI)

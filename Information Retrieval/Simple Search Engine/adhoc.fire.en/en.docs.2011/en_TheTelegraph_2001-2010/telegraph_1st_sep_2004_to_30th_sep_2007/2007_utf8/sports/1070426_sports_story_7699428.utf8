 WI captain to be named on Sunday

Kingston: The West Indies will announce a new captain, to replace the retired Brian Lara, on Sunday. 

The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) said the squad for next months tour of England would be finalised once the new skipper had been appointed. 

Lara retired from international cricket on Saturday and his deputy the 26-year-old Guyanese Ramnaresh Sarwan is tipped to take over. 

The names of Trinidad captain Daren Ganga, who did not feature in the World Cup squad, and opening batsman Chris Gayle are also doing the rounds. 

WICB chief executive Bruce Aanensen said the selectors had already put forward their nomination to the board. 

The selectors have chosen somebody... Im not at liberty to divulge that name at the moment because we have to get the approval of the WICB for the nomination before any disclosure can be made, Aanensen said in an interview which was also published on the WICBs official website. 

The selectors said there were three people they were looking at. They had their meeting, we did not attend it we allowed them the privacy to discuss the matter. They have come up with one of the three. 

One of the things we are looking for is leadership skills... we are also looking at a guy who will command of his teammates. 

The West Indies play the first of four Tests against England at Lords from May 17. The Test series will be followed by three one-day Internationals in July.

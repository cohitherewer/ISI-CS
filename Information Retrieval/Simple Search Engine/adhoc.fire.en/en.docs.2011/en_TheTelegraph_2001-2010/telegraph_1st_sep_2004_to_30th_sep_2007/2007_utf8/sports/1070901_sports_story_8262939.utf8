 Kumble, Dravid in Warnes top 20

A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: Anil Kumble and Rahul Dravid have been ranked among the top-20 in Shane Warnes list of 50 greats in his column in The Times, London. The following are excerpts: 

20) Adam Gilchrist (Australia) 

Tests 90 

Runs 5,353 at 48.66 

Catches 344 

Stumpings 37 

That every country is trying to find an Adam Gilchrist shows his impact. He is still a batsman-keeper rather than the other way round, but his keeping is improving. 

19) Aravinda de Silva (Sri Lanka) 

Tests 93 

Runs 6,361 at 42.97 

At team meetings we would spend more time talking about Aravinda than the rest of the Sri Lanka batsmen but our plans rarely came off. He was sheer class, a lovely strokemaker. 

18) Merv Hughes (Australia) 

Tests 53 

Wickets 212 at 28.38 

Nobody will be surprised that Merv is so high. For all the clowning, the moustache and his physique, he was a thoughtful bowler. 

17) Matthew Hayden (Australia) 

Tests 89 

Runs 7,739 at 53.00 

There is something special about most of the top 20. In Haydens case it is his refusal to give up after struggling in his first go at Test cricket. 

16) Andrew Flintoff (England) 

Tests 67 

Runs 3,381 at 32.50 

Wickets 197 at 32.02 

I dont mean this in a disrespectful way to Michael Vaughan, but it was Fred who carried England through the 2005 Ashes with his batting, bowling and sheer presence. He was great for the game in Australia as well as England . 

15) Graham Gooch (England) 

Tests 118 

Runs 8,900 at 42.58 

Professional in every sense of the word, Gooch was the toughest opponent from England I faced, which is remarkable iven that he had been playing Test cricket for 18 years by the time my first Ashes series came around in 1993. Even then he was the wicket we most wanted. 

14) Rahul Dravid (India) 

Tests 112 

Runs 9,492 at 56.50 

Dravid grew in my estimation the longer I played Test cricket. He will not destroy you like a few batsmen lower in my list, but he can grind you down. As a bowler you know that once he is in, you need to produce a very good ball. That sounds obvious, but he is so strong technically that he makes fewer mistakes than other batsmen. And he should have captained India far earlier than he did. 

13) Anil Kumble (India) 

Tests 118 

Wickets 566 at 28.73 

I can empathise with Kumble as a wrist-spin bowler. He is a real fighter, a bloke who will give you nothing on the field but has always been a true gentleman off it. With his height and bounce he comes into his own when the pitch is up and down. To score a maiden Test hundred in his 118th game was amazing; I wish that Id matched that. 

12) Mark Waugh (Australia) 

Tests 128 

Runs 8,029 at 41.81 

Whether he was batting, standing at slip or in the outfield, everything about this guy was graceful. Of all our great batsmen, he was my favourite to watch 

11) Courtney Walsh (West Indies) 

Tests 132 

Wickets 519 at 24.44 

He began his career at a time when West Indies could pick from seven or eight genuinely world-class fast bowlers and ended as their stock and strike man in one.

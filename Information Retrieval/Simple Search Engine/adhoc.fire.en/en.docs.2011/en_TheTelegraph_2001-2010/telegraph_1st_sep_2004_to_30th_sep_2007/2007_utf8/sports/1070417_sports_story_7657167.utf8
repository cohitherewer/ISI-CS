The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No fresh protests 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Ahmedabad: There has been no untoward incident since Sunday afternoon when Sachin Tendulkar, Ajit Agarkar and Zaheer Khan faced angry protests on arrival to take part in the National Twenty20 meet. The hotel, where the players are staying, has been turned into a fortress with the police taking no chances. 

Nearly eight hours after the protesters shouted Sachin go back, Agarkar go back, Zaheer go back, Sourav Ganguly checked in. Though his arrival was peaceful, he must have sensed the public rage as soon as he stepped into the hotel. Heavy security has been provided to Sachin and Sourav. 

Gujarat Cricket Association president Narhari Amin said the protests were just a gimmick and an attempt to seek cheap publicity. Only a handful of people was protesting. It is not such a big number considering the citys 50 lakh population, Amin said. Playing down the protests, he claimed, everything is fine and the protests have not affected anybody. 

City police chief, J. Mahapatra, said the mob was manageable. Local police handled the situation and we did not have to deploy additional force. There is absolutely no problem and we do not apprehend any trouble for the cricketers, he added. 

George Dias, who led the protests on Sunday, wants the players responsible for Indias humiliation to quit. 

It is their moral duty to call it a day after their humiliating defeat in the World Cup.

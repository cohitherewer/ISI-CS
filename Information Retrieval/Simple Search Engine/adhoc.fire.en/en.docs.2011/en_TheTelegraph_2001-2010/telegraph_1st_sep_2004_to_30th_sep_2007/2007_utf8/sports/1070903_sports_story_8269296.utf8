The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dravid satisfied

A CORRESPONDENT

Leeds: Team India captain Rahul Dravid acknowledged Sourav Gangulys bowling effort and also also gave credit to the improved batting performance for Indias win on Sunday. 

Following are excerpts from what the captains had to say: 

Rahul Dravid: It was a perfect batting performance. We needed a big score because we knew the Duckworth/Lewis method would come into play in these conditions. Sachin (Tendulkar) and Sourav (Ganguly) gave us a strong start while Gautam Gambhir and Yuvraj (Singh) finished with a flourish 

Paul Collingwood: The Indians batted really well, putting our bowlers under a lot of pressure. It was always going to be a monumental effort chasing a 300-plus target. It was such a shame that the weather keeps coming. We are still positive, we lead the series 3-2. We still took a lot of good things from our performance today. 

A Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds: Andrew Flintoff is receiving specialist assessment on his left ankle and will rejoin the squad on Tuesday prior to the sixth ODI at the Brit Oval. According to an ECB release, mediumpacer Chris Tremlett was ruled out of the fifth ODI due to soreness in his right foot.

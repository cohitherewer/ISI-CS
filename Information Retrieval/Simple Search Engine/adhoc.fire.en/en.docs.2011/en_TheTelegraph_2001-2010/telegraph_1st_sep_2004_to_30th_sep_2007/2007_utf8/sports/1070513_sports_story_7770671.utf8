 Ferguson: Wont spare West Ham

 - Relegation battle heats up on final day 

 OLIVER KAY 

 Sir Alex Ferguson 

With the Premier League title already won and an FA Cup final on the horizon, Manchester United players may be tempted to go easy on West Ham United on Sunday not least Rio Ferdinand, whose brother Anton faces the threat of relegation with the visiting team but Sir Alex Ferguson has promised Sheffield United and Wigan Athletic that there will be no favours for his good friend Alan Curbishley. 

When Curbishley signed off as Charlton Athletic manager last season, Ferguson surprised him by presenting two first-class return tickets to visit his sister in New Zealand. 

The United manager, however, insists that there will be no charity in terms of his team selection Sunday, even if Cristiano Ronaldo or Wayne Rooney may again be left out of the starting line-up in readiness for next Saturdays showdown with Chelsea at Wembley. 

Its a difficult game for us, against a team at the bottom of the league fighting for survival, and, while one or two players wont play, in the main it will be a strong team I put out, Ferguson said. 

We will do that to represent ourselves in a proper way and to be fair to everyone. I think that everyone knows the English game is 100 per cent honest and people do their best. That is what we will do on Sunday. 

Alan (Curbishley) is a very good friend of mine, but he understands I have to respect the issues of the other managers as well. They (Wigan and Sheffield) deserve our best attention to the game and I will be picking a team to win. 

Ferguson has plenty of reasons to want his team to end their Premiership campaign on a high. He recalled Friday how West Hams supporters delighted in depriving them of the league title at Upton Park in 1995; victory would give United 92 points, equalling their record from the 1993-94 season, when they played 42 matches rather than 38; and of course there is the incentive to put on a show for the supporters before being awarded the trophy after the game. 

The trophy will be lifted by Gary Neville, but the United captain will play no part in the game and, like Louis Saha, is losing his race to be fit for the FA Cup Final. Neville has not resumed full training since damaging ankle ligaments on March 17 and Ferguson said he was doubtful that the full back will be fit to face Chelsea. 

Saha has disappointed Ferguson with a cautious approach to his rehabilitation, but the France forward said he was keen to remain at Old Trafford. I want to stay. I have just won my first title with United and I want so much to win other titles (here). I love my club and I dont want to leave it, he said. 

Any Chelsea or Manchester United player sent off Sunday will be suspended for the FA Cup Final next Saturday, but no one at the two clubs can be banned from the Wembley match because of an accumulation of yellow cards. At this stage of the season, only players who have received 15 bookings are given a suspension and no Chelsea or United player is at risk.

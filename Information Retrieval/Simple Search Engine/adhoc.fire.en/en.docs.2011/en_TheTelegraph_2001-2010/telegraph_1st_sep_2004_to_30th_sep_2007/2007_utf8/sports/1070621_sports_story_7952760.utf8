 Team Bhupathi out

London: Fourth seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and his American Partner Justin Gimelstob made a shocking first-round exit from the Nottingham Open, losing to British wildcards Joshua Goodall and Ross Hutchins. 

The Indo-American pair squandered a one-set lead to go down 7-5, 4-6, 8-10 in little over one and a half hour long match to bow out of the 353,450 Euro tournament. 

In a hard-fought contest, the fourth seeds won the opening set after breaking their rivals once but could not sustain the lead against the local favourites. 

In singles, top seed Richard Gasquet stayed on course for a hattrick of titles with a 6-4, 6-0 demolition of Czech qualifier Jan Vacek. 

Russian Dmitry Tursunov knocked out Tim Henman 7-6, 3-6, 6-2. Henman, who won just his second tour match of the year against Michael Russell on Tuesday, squandered three set points in the first set tiebreak against Tursunov but battled back to win set 2. (PTI)

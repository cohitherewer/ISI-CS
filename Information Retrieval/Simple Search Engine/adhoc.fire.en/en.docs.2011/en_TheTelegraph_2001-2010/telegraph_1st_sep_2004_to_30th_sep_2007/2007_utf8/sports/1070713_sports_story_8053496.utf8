The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 First-ever win for Thailand

Bangkok: Striker Pipat Tongkanya scored twice in eight minutes to lift hosts Thailand to a convincing 2-0 win over Oman and the top spot in Asian Cup group A on Thursday. 

Pipat combined with fellow-substitute Teerathep Winothai in the 70th and 78th minutes to give the Thais a well-earned victory. 

The goals came after 69 minutes of relentless Thai attacking, with the Omanis, who drew 1-1 with tournament favourites Australia on Sunday, rarely looking dangerous. The victory was Thailands first in the Asian Cup since they made their debut in 1972. 

This match has helped us regain our confidence, we have never won a game in the Asian Cup, Im very proud to be the first coach to do that, coach Charnwit Polcheewin told a news conference. 

Pipat and Teerathep both did a good job, but whether or not they will start in the next game depends on the tactics, and I wont give those away. 

Oman collected four bookings and few chances but could have gone ahead near the interval when Fawzi Bashir rounded Nattaporn before shooting well wide. The win put Thailand on four points, three ahead of Iraq and Australia who meet on Friday in the next group A game.

 Ruud takes Real to verge of title 

Madrid: Real Madrid were left on the verge of winning the Spanish title on Saturday after staging yet another dramatic comeback to grab a 2-2 draw at Real Zaragoza while Barcelona surrendered a lead to draw 2-2 with Espanyol. 

Reals title hopes looked to have gone up in smoke as they trailed Zaragoza 1-2 with just over a minute to go, while Barcelona led 2-1 at home against city rivals Espanyol. 

But a late scrambled goal from Ruud van Nistelrooy earned Real their 2-2 draw and at almost exactly the same moment, Raul Tamudo scored his second to equalise against Barcelona. 

The results mean that Real will win their first league title in four years if they beat mid-table Real Mallorca at home in the final game of the season next weekend or equal Barcelonas result at Gimnastic Tarragona.

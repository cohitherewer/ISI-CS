 Oram ready for amputation

Christchurch: Desperate to take part in the World Cup, New Zealand allrounder Jacob Oram has said he would seriously consider amputating his injured ring finger to make it to the Caribbean for the mega event. 

Oram, who broke his finger during the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy match, said he was not sure how his finger was healing under the protective strapping. 

The plan is get to the West Indies, whip it off and assess the inflammation... If it means cutting the finger off, if thats the worse-case scenario, if thats the last resort, Ill do that, theres no way Im missing this, he was quoted as saying in the New Zealand media. 

Oram said he would try specially designed splints and pain-killers to ease the pain. 

Weve got a couple of techniques in terms of taping and a couple of guards which are a lot thinner so they can fit into a batting glove. Im confident itll be fine, he said. 

The 29-year-old would not be able to test his finger until their first practice session in Barbados on Saturday. 

Recalling the incident, Oram said the initial impact of the high chance at Wellington did not hurt and it was not until he looked down that he knew something was wrong. 

Ive seen one replay where I look happy and then Im swearing it didnt go down well with mum, he said.

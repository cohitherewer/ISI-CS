The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Cant be swept aside by emotions: Chima

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

From 1987 to 1998, Chima Okerie played for both Mohun Bagan and East Bengal, scoring 208 goals, equally divided between the two giants. On Tuesday, he will be seen in the new role of a coach for the first time in the derby tie. He spoke to The Telegraph on his feelings about Mohun Bagan-East Bengal match. 

Q Earlier, your role in a Mohun Bagan-East Bengal match had always been of a player. How are your feelings as a coach? 

A Since the roles are different, the feelings are also not the same. As a player, I used to be very charged up, eager to do well. The atmosphere used to be electric as if the entire city was looking up to us to do well. There used to be massive hype for the big match. In such a situation, you were bound to get excited. 

As a coach, I think I am a much more level-headed person. I know NFL is a long journey and I cannot be swept aside by emotions. A coach has to be much more calculative. 

Talking of hype, do you think a derby match these days is as exciting as it used to be in your playing days? 

Well, I think it should be. I know the competition has got tougher and winning against Dempo or Mahindra these days is equally difficult and rewarding as it is in the derby tie. But then, football is a game of tradition. Without history, the game gets stale. Keeping this in mind, a Mohun Bagan-East Bengal match is bound to be the most exciting affair of the season. 

I still remember the match that I played for the losing side when East Bengal routed Mohun Bagan 4-1 in the Federation Cup semi-final in 1997. I have never seen such an electric atmosphere. 

Now both teams have foreign coaches and lot of players are from outside Bengal. Do you feel that an outstation player finds it difficult to understand the emotions involved in this particular tie? 

I completely disagree. I still believe that for every player in India it is a dream to play in any of these two clubs. So they all are aware of the importance of this tie. I came from Nigeria, yet I used to get excited to play this match. So much was my involvement those days that if the AIFF had offered me to play for India, I would have accepted. Of course, I was lucky that I got a chance to play for the Nigerian national team. 

We watched some great goals in the derby matches, some of them were scored by you. Do we lack strikers these days? 

I accept the fact there were some great strikers in my time, like Kuljit Singh, I.M. Vijayan or Bhaichung Bhutia. Even Pradeep Talukdar was so good a scorer. But I dont think the present lot should be dismissed as no good. Some of them are quite talented. Perhaps, they need to be guided in the proper manner. 

Has the standard of football in the city gone down? 

Football in India has generally improved, but mostly outside Bengal. I feel the game in Bengal has room for improvement. There are passers of the ball in India like Kuttimani in HASC or Venkatesh in Mahindra United. Its good to see that teams in Mumbai and Goa are also coming up. 

Do you feel we lack good coaches? 

Certainly not. We had good coaches during our time, but the game here those days was more individualistic. Nowadays, coaching is more scientific. Football has become a much more methodical game at present. It is no different here.

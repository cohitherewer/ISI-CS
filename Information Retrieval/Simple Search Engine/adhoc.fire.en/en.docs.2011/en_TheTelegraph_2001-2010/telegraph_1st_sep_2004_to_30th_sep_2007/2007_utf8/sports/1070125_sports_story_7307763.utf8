The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IN THE CITY

 Manoranjan Bhattacharjee has been appointed technical manager of the East Bengal team. He will replace assistant coach Tarun Dey. 

 Bhattacharjee on Wednesday had a discussion with chief coach Carlos Roberto Pereira regarding the teams performance in the ongoing National Football League. The former East Bengal and India defender will accompany the side to Siliguri, where East Bengal will kick off the Super Soccer series against Brazils Sao Paulo on Saturday.

 Meanwhile, new Brazilian import Edmilson had a brief training session under Pereira. Although the coach is yet to give his verdict on the striker, Edmilson will travel to Siliguri with the side.

 Twin unbeaten centuries by Sanjiv Pandey (150) and Uday Srivasta (110) helped Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) notch up a 10-wicket win over Mohammedan Sporting in a CAB two-day league match that concluded on Wednesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I like to play it hard... Im serious on the field

 - I dedicate this award to the team... Cant think of anybody else: Zaheer 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Zaheer Khan

Nottingham: Around this time last year, an

 out-of-favour Zaheer Khan was making headlines for Worcestershire. On Tuesday,

 having returned a match haul of nine for 134, he got adjudged the second Tests

 MoM. 

Actually, the jury didnt have to struggle in presenting Zaheer his second MoM award at the highest level. His first, in fact, had come earlier this summer the final Test against Bangladesh. 

I dedicate my performance and this award to the team... Cant think of anybody else, Zaheer

 told The Telegraph, grinning from ear to ear. Earlier, the 28-year-old spoke

 to the media. 

The following are excerpts 

Overall, this has been my best performance... I enjoyed bowling in conditions very different from the subcontinent... We had to do well in the first innings of the Test... Conditions suited fast bowling and we had to make it count... We did... 

We knew it would be much harder work in Englands second innings and were prepared... I think we bowlers paced ourselves nicely... 

Going back some years, I was a bit wayward on the tour of Bangladesh in 2004-05... After that, I started working on control... Playing County cricket helped... I got used to the conditions in England... The ball (Duke) too... I bowled a lot of overs and that helped bring about consistency in line and length... 

I did bowl a lot round the wicket (on the fourth day)... I tried something different and it worked... Im happy the ball swung throughout the (fourth) day... I didnt have a problem controlling the swing... 

Yes, there was an incident when I was batting (on the third evening) and that inspired me... I found jelly beans on the crease... I hit one away... After playing the next ball, I found more jelly beans... Obviously, somebody was throwing them from behind... 

I asked them (Englands keeper and the slips cordon) as to what it was all about... They came at me (verbally) and I reacted... I did so because I was upset... 

I didnt know where exactly the jelly beans came from, but thats not important... I couldve picked the wrong man (Kevin Pietersen)... I just found it insulting... Im here to play cricket... The team is here to play cricket... I like to play good cricket... Like to play it hard... Im serious on the field... 

At the highest level, one plays with passion... Sometimes one does lose control... I dont think Sreesanth did anything wrong intentionally... Dont think the beamer (to Pietersen) was intentional... He gets hyper, but I would back him any day...

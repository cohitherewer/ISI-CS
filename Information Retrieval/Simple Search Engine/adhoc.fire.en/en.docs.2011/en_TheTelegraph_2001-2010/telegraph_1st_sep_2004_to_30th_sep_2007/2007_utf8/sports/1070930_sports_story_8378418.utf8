 Ravi Shastri accepts NCA post 

Mumbai: Former Test captain and allrounder Ravi Shastri has accepted the BCCI offer to take up the job of chairman at the Bangalore-based National Cricket Academy (NCA). 

Shastri had accepted the offer in principle Friday, but wanted a day or two to look into his commitments before giving the final nod. 

BCCIs general body had decided that the former India captain was the man most suited for the high-profile job left vacant by the sacking of Kapil Dev for aligning with the rebel Indian Cricket League. 

BCCI sources said on Saturday that the former cricketer-turned-commentator has accepted the offer. 

NCA has two former Test cricketers associated with it in off-spinner Shivlal Yadav and Lalchand Rajput, who hold posts of directors along with a full-time manager in Col. K. R. Nair. 

Shastri visited the NCA in Bangalore and saw the facilities, according to chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty. 

Shastri visited the National Cricket Academy and took a look at the facilities available, Shetty added.

 Anirban in lead

Bangalore: Indias No. 1 amateur Anirban Lahiri continued his good run with an opening round of six-under 64 to take sole lead in the LG Southern India Amateur Golf Championship at the par-70 Bangalore Golf Club Tuesday. 

The event is the second leg of the Indian amateur golf tour. 

Bangalores Abhishek Jha shot a four-under 66 to occupy second position while Jaipurs Amanjyot Singh, Delhis Saurabh Bahuguna and Golf Foundation-trainee Rudresh Sharma shot a two-under 68 each to be tied third. 

Simarjeet Singh was in sixth place at 69 while Akhilesh Chitlangia and Samaresh Sardar shot a 70 each to tie for seventh place. Balvinder Singh Mattu, Mithun Perera, C. G. Somiah, Manav Das, Navtez Singh, Jasjeet Singh and K. Prabagaran were placed tied ninth at 71. 

Lahiri started the day with birdies on the first and second but dropped a shot on the par-3 third where he three-putted from 12 feet. However, birdies on the fourth, fifth and eighth saw him make the turn at four-under. 

On his back nine, Lahiri birdied the 10th, 14th and 15th but a bogey on the par-3 16th saw him end the day at 64. Jha had a near perfect round erring only on the par-4 13th. He birdied the second, fifth and eagled the eighth to make the turn at four-under. 

On the eight, Jha hit his second shot using a three-iron to about 12 feet from the pin and made a left-to-right uphill putt. On his return journey, Jha birdied the 17th to end the day at 66. (PTI)

 Brearley to head MCC

IVO TENNANT 

Mike Brearley, the former England and Middlesex captain who was 65 at the weekend, is to succeed Doug Insole as president of MCC in October. 

He lives in North London, not far from Lords, and is a psychoanalyst, in addition to covering Test matches for a British newspaper. He wrote the acclaimed The Art of Captaincy, but has shunned an autobiography. 

At first glance, Insoles choice is unsurprising, in that Brearley is a fellow Cambridge University and England batsman. The former scored 25,241 runs in 450 first-class matches; the latter 25,186 in 455. They were manager and captain on MCCs successful tour to Australia in 1978-79. 

On the other hand, Brearley is not a traditionalist, or, seemingly, clubby. 

Although Brearley has not been seen often at Lords since retiring as Middlesex captain in 1982, he is a life member of the MCC, has served on the clubs cricket committee and sits on its world cricket committee. His every pronouncement and article is compelling and much interest surrounds the influence he will have on what is now a progressive club in his year in office. 

The MCC made an unexpected choice in appointing Keith Bradshaw, an Australian, as its chief executive, and he will work with an unusual president, for Brearley has combined a scholarly mind with a lack of intellectual snobbery. Rodney Hogg, the Australia fast bowler, famously said: He has a degree in people.

 Kapil wants Sachin, Sourav to visit NCA

Bangalore: National Cricket Academy (NCA) chairman Kapil Dev has advised Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly to utilise their rest period from the Indian team by sharing their experience with budding talents. 

Kapil said he would request the cricket board to allow the players to work with the under-17 cricketers at the ongoing 45-day training camp here at the KSCA. 

This will certainly help players like Sachin and Sourav to have continuous practice and keep themselves fit. We will be sending a request to the BCCI in this regard and if the board considers our request favourably it will help the young boys, he said. 

We will even request for the services of Harbhajan Singh, Mohammed Kaif and Irfan Pathan, Kapil added. While Harbhajan and Pathan have been dropped from both the ODI and Test squads after the World Cup debacle, Kaif has been out of favour from much earlier. 

For a player what is needed was proper application of mind and determination to perform on the field. We have the needed potential. 

I call upon all the 25 under-17 players to fully make use of the opportunity to improve their cricket. 

NCA director (coaching) Lalchand Rajput said the BCCI was planning to do away with the appointment of foreign coaches from level I, II and III. 

So far we were influenced by coaching guidelines from other nations. But with our own coaching manual which the NCA is coming out we can prepare good coaches of our own. It has been decided to provide training to the selected coaches. 

Rajput added that former top players and trainers have been identified and it had also been decided to have physios, trainers and other supporting staff from within the country. (PTI)

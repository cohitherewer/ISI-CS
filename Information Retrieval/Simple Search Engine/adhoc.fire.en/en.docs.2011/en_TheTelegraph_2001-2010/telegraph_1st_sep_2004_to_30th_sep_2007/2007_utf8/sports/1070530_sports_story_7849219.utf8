 Kamal confident

Jaipur: Undaunted by Singapores formidable presence, ace Indian paddler Achanta Sharath Kamal on Monday oozed confidence of pulling off an upset win against them in the Commonwealth Table Tennis Championship that begins here Wednesday. 

After a gruelling practice session, Kamal accepted that beating Singapore would need an extraordinary effort but asserted that it was not impossible altogether. 

Yes, they (Singapore) are strong but it is not that we cant beat them. If we play well, there is a possibility, Kamal said. We have seen their videos and plotted our strategy. (PTI)

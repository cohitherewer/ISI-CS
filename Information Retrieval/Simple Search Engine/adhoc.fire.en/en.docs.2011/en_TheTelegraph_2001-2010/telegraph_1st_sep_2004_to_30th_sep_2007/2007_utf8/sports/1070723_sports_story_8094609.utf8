 QUOTES FROM LORDS

 Rudra Pratap Singh, who took five wickets, at Lords on Sunday 

Rudra Pratap Singh: That I got my first five-wicket haul at Lords will always be special.... Michael Vaughans wicket gave me the most satisfaction... It came at an important time (early in the first session)... We bowled to a plan in the second innings... Dinesh Karthik and Sourav Ganguly are batting well and with a couple of more experienced batsmen to come, I think we stand a good chance. 

Kevin Pietersen: This is my best hundred... Id never batted in such difficult conditions as yesterday (Saturday)... My feeling fatigued? Whenever I turn up for England, I wont be found wanting in commitment... As for the final day, weve got to keep our wits about and keep asking questions...

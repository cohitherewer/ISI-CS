 Bharat Arun new 

Bengal coach

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former India mediumpacer and Tamil Nadu captain Bharat Arun has been appointed as coach of the senior Bengal squad for the 2007-08 season. 

His presentation on Saturday afternoon was impressive, CAB president Prasun Mukherjee said on Saturday. 

Arun was associated with the National Cricket Academy (NCA) as bowling coach after a four-year stint (2002-2006) with the Tamil Nadu Ranji Trophy side. 

My biggest challenge would be to make Bengal the best team in the country, though they are currently one of the best sides, Arun said after his appointment. 

Ex-India player Arun played two Tests and four one-day Internationals. He bagged four wickets in Tests while his tally in ODIs is one. 

Arun will take charge from November 1. The CAB is still undecided on whether to appoint someone as assistant. 

We havent decided whether we will keep an assistant coach, Mukherjee said.

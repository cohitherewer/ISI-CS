Calcutta: The newly-elected Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Prasun Mukherjee, who assumed office formally on Thursday, will write to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for releasing grants and subsidies immediately. 

With the working committee meeting of the BCCI to be held on February 7, we will send our suggestions for lifting the ban, Mukherjee said on Thursday. 

Speaking to reporters, minutes after his unanimous election to the top CAB post was ratified at a seven-minute meeting, Mukherjee said it would not be possible for anyone to represent CAB in the BCCI meeting since India would take on Sri Lanka at the Eden on the very next day. 

Mukherjee, who received congratulatory messages from Sourav Ganguly among others, said his priority would be to organise the February 8 ODI well. 

Mukherjee said he would invite Dalmiya and all other past CAB office-bearers for the match. 

The new CAB president, however, denied that sports minister Subhas Chakraborty was hostile to him. Its true that he had wanted to contest. But later on, he withdrew and appealed to everyone to support me.

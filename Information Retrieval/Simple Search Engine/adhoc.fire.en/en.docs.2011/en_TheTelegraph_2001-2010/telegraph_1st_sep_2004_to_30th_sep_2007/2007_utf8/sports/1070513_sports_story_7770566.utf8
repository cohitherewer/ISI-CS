 Massa bags pole in Alonsos home race

 Felipe Massa in Barcelona on Saturday 

Barcelona: Ferraris Brazilian Felipe Massa dashed Fernando Alonsos hopes of taking pole position in his home Spanish Grand Prix on Saturday. 

The Brazilian lapped the Circuit de Catalunya three hundredths of a second quicker than McLarens double world champion to seize the top slot in the dying seconds of the final qualifying session. 

Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen was third quickest and shares the second row with Alonsos teammate, British rookie Lewis Hamilton. 

Alonso, Raikkonen and Hamilton are all level at the top of the standings on 22 points with Hamilton the first driver in Formula One history to finish the first three races of his world championship career on the podium. 

The pole position, on a bright and hot afternoon, was Massas third in a row, fourth in five races and sixth of his career. 

The Brazilian won the previous Grand Prix in Bahrain in April and, now just five points adrift of the leading trio, will be favourite in a race that has been won for the past six years by the driver on pole position. 

For sure we made a good improvement in the car from the last race to this race, but McLaren did as well, said Massa. Everybody is very close. 

Alonso, who won in Spain from pole position with Renault last year and will have an expected 140,000 record crowd behind him on Sunday, remained confident that he could send his fans home happy. 

I think as long as you are in the top three, you have a chance to fight for the victory, he said. If you start fifth or sixth I think there is no way. 

This is the first time all weekend that they are ahead of us, added the Spaniard, whose team led every practice session as well as the first part of Saturdays qualifying. So we should be okay for tomorrow (Sunday). 

Third place was a disappointment for Raikkonen, winner on his Ferrari debut at the season-opening race in Australia but still struggling to unleash all the cars performance in qualifying. 

We lost a little bit in the third sector just because I lost the rear end of the car a bit there, said the Finn. But I think I still have a good chance. 

Polands Robert Kubica, driving for BMW Sauber, and Italian Jarno Trulli in a Toyota, filled the third row with BMWs Nick Heidfeld and Renaults Heikki Kovalainen behind. 

Briton David Coulthard, the oldest driver on the starting grid at 36, gave Renault-powered Red Bull a boost with ninth place at the circuit where he made his Grand Prix debut with Williams in 1994.

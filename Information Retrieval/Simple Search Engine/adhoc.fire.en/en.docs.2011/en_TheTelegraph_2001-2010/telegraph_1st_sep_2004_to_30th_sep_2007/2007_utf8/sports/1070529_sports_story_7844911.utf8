Leeds: England handed the West Indies their biggest innings defeat as Michael Vaughans side won the second Test at Headingley by an innings and 283 runs on Monday. 

West Indies, following on after their first innings 146, were all out for 141 in the third over after tea on the fourth day and never threatened Englands 570 for seven declared. 

England required only nine wickets as West Indies captain Ramnaresh Sarwan was unable to bat because of a shoulder injury that may force him off the tour. 

West Indies heaviest Test loss previously was by an innings and 237 runs against England at The Oval 50 years ago. 

England took a 1-0 lead in the four-match series that has matches at Manchester and Chester-le-Street approaching. 

The win was set up by England captain Vaughans 103 in his first Test in 18 months and Kevin Pietersens Test best 226, which was the highest England score in 17 years. 

Left-arm seamer Ryan Sidebottom, swinging the ball in helpful conditions, then claimed eight wickets in the match (eight for 86), the second Test of his career and his first in six years after failing to take a single victim on debut. 

West Indies began the day on 22 for two and no doubt hoping more rain would come to their rescue after the whole of Sundays play was washed out. 

They lost Chris Gayle to the third over of the day when he was caught behind off Liam Plunkett. 

Sidebottom, bowling accurately in cold and gloomy conditions, then trapped Sylvester Joseph lbw for one and Devon Smith (16) edged to Andrew Strauss at first slip. 

Runako Morton resisted England briefly for his 25 until he top-edged a pull shot off Steve Harmison to the wicketkeeper. The last three wickets fell in eight balls for no runs. 

Denesh Ramdin was harshly adjudged lbw by umpire Asad Rauf off Harmison for five, spinner Monty Panesar had top scorer Dwayne Bravo caught at extra cover for 52 and then Harmison wrapped up the match by bowling Jerome Taylor for a duck. 

Harmison finished with three for 37 in the second innings though struggled with his line throughout the match. 

Two lengthy rain delays made England wait for their win but ultimately they did achieve their first Test victory since last August. It was also Vaughans first Test win since 2005. 

Its been a great week, Vaughan, who joined Peter May as the most successful England captain, said. I couldnt really have asked for much more. Im pleased to go 1-0 up. 

With the rain that was around we started to wonder whether it was going to be one of those games that cost us but in the end Im delighted. 

I thought we played to a very good standard and were ruthless for most of the match, added Vaughan, who preferred to concentrate on his own teams success rather than the deficiencies of Englands opponents. 

Ryan was exceptional from his first ball, Vaughan said. 

He certainly didnt swing the ball like that when he was at Yorkshire. I dont know what they have been doing with him at Notts, Vaughan added with a smile.

 Boucher hearing postponed

Durban: Cricket South Africa has postponed the disciplinary hearing against Mark Boucher. The disciplinary committee would decide a date for the hearing later. 

The South Africa wicket-keeper appeared before the committee for a hearing on allegations that he had breached rules and code of conduct on five occasions, including comments attributed to him in an article published in Business Day, the CSA said in a statement. 

The article contained Bouchers support for Jacques Kallis, who resigned as vice-captain after being dropped from the squad for the ICC World Twenty20 next month. 

Boucher said people who disagreed with Kallis had sidelined him. He also implied that the inclusion of more black players had led to Kallis being replaced. 

But the CSA said Kallis had just been rested for the remaining fixtures. 

Kallis and Boucher were dropped from the one-day squad due to play Zimbabwe in three one-day Internationals next week. (PTI)

 HIGHLIGHTS

 AB de Villers recorded his fourth duck in the ongoing 

 World Cup a first by anybody in a single World Cup. New 

 Zealand batsman Nathan Astle had three ducks during the 

 2003 edition. 

 De Villiers is now one short of the World Cup record 

 for most ducks by a batsman currently held by Nathan Astle 

 and Pakistani Ijaz Ahmed with five each. 

 Herschelle Gibbs during his patient knock of 60 became 

 the first South African and the 11th batsman overall to 

 aggregate 1,000-plus runs in the World Cup. He now has 1,028 

 runs (averaging 57.11) from 23 matches. 

 Gibbs meanwhile has taken his tally of sixes to 14 

 the most by any batsman in this WC. Australian Matthew 

 Hayden and Sri Lankan Sanath Jayasuriya have 13 each. Gibbs 

 is however one short of the WC record for most sixes (15) 

 in a single tournament held by Indian Sourav Ganguly in 

 2003. 

 Gibbs now has 28 World Cup sixes to his credit, which 

 equals the record held by Australian Ricky Ponting. 

 Playing in his 50th match, Ashwell Prince became 

 the 20th South African batsman to reach 1,000 runs in ODIs. 

 He now has 1018 runs. 

 Peter Fulton in his 34th match, became the 28th Black 

 Cap to reach 1,000 runs in ODIs. He now has 1004 runs. 

 Stephen Fleming became the first New Zealander and 

 the 16th batsman overall to aggregate 8,000 runs in ODIs. 

 From 278 matches he has 8,024 runs to his credit. 

 Scott Styris with 435 runs in World Cu 2007, became 

 the only second New Zealand batsman to accumulate 400 runs 

 in a single World Cup tournament after Martin Crowe, who 

 had made 456 runs in 1992. 

 Stryis also became the third batsman in this edition 

 to reach 400 runs after South African Jacques Kallis (463) 

 and Australian Matthew Hayden (436).

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 This is my 

 No. 1 achievement in one-day cricket: Sachin

 - THE MAESTRO ON THE 15000 MILESTONE AND MORE 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL

 Sachin Tendulkar 

 Glasgow: In recent months, 

 Sachin Tendulkar has gone through some really awkward moments. 

 From being compelled to bat down the order by the then-coach, 

 Greg Chappell, to being asked to show cause and, then, being 

 rested for the ODIs in Bangladesh... The past six weeks, 

 though, have been quite different. On Friday, of course, 

 the 34-year-old became the first to scale the 15,000 runs 

 peak in ODIs. 

 Its an achievement which 

 has delighted Sachin. That came through when he spoke to 

 The Telegraph (from the team hotel in Belfast) on 

 Saturday afternoon. 

 The following are excerpts

 On the morning after

 Feels great... Its doubly 

 nice that we won the match and have given ourselves a chance 

 to win the series (on Sunday) against South Africa...

On whether hed been 

 aware he needed just 50 to reach 15,000

 I knew I was close, but I wasnt 

 counting the runs... I realised Id got there when 

 the public announcement was made... Out in the middle, one 

 forgets about milestones and records... The priority is 

 to do the job.

 On rating his latest feat 

 vis--vis the earlier ones

 This is different... Its 

 not about having done well in a series... Not about having 

 had a couple of good knocks in succession... This has taken 

 almost 18 years and, along the way, Ive had injuries... 

 Ups and downs... I accept it hasnt been a smooth highway, 

 but Ive been on the road for a long time... Its 

 not about numbers alone, but more than any one hundred or 

 some truly special innings, I suppose this is my No.1 achievement 

 in one-day cricket.

 On the celebrations

 Champagne was arranged and I was 

 made to cut a cake... Everything happened in the dressing 

 room... Generally, the atmosphere in this dressing room 

 is terrific... Our cricket manager, Mr (Chandu) Borde had 

 kind words to say... Youll recall hed been the 

 manager on my first tour, to Pakistan in 1989...

 On the ones he remembered 

 first on getting to the milestone

 My parents... I dedicate this 

 achievement to my father (the late Ramesh) and mother (Rajni)... 

 Im sure my father wouldve been very proud had 

 he been alive. 

 On whether hes more 

 comfortable now that hes back to opening

 Ive mostly played as an 

 opener in ODIs... My most significant contributions, I think, 

 have come at the very top of the order... I like opening, 

 yes, but Im going to respect the teams requirements. 

 Thats important.

 On who authored this promotion

 (Laughs) Thats an 

 internal matter and it wouldnt be proper to talk about 

 it. In any case, I dont think it matters (to the public).

 On whether he has proved 

 a point by bagging the MoS award during the Tests in Bangladesh 

 and by scoring big on his one-day comeback

 Look, Ive never been the 

 type to prove a point... Ive never been one to try 

 and retaliate in one form or the other... I enjoy batting 

 and I try for the maximum... Obviously, I realise I cant 

 get a hundred each time... I have a job... Have a responsibility 

 towards the team... I do the best I can. 

 On having been asked by 

 the Board to explain his Chappell-specific comments after 

 the World Cup

 Thats done with... I wasnt 

 upset... I was asked to state my position and I did so.

 On the vice-captaincy 

 drama

 Im not sure whether everybody 

 was told that Id only agreed to be the vice-captain 

 (in ODIs) till the World Cup... The selectors were looking 

 for somebody senior and I put my hand up. However, Id 

 made it clear I wouldnt accept the post after the 

 World Cup... So, wheres the question of my being removed 

 as vice-captain? Test cricket is different.

 On back to opening with 

 another former captain, Sourav Ganguly

 As I said yesterday, hes 

 a fabulous player and its a treat to watch him... 

 Sourav and I understand each other well.

 [With 17 hundred-plus opening 

 partnerships, Sachin and Sourav have gone ahead of Matthew 

 Hayden and Adam Gilchrist. Actually, the Indian stalwarts 

 last three-figure stand had been almost six years ago.] 

 On whether wins such as 

 the one on Friday will help the fans quickly forget Team 

 Indias World Cup debacle

 (After a pause) In India, 

 the public tends to get very emotional... The fans must 

 be patient... They should always be with the team... Be 

 around us players, not go against the team.

 Finally, on whether his 

 recent performances have made him more hungry

 Like the other batsmen, even I 

 want to score big whenever I take guard... Whatever the 

 performances, that desire doesnt change. Its 

 the driving force.

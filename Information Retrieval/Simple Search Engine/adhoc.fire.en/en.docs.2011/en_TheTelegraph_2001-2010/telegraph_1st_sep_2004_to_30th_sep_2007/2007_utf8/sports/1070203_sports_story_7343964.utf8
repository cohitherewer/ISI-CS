Mumbai: Motivation has never been an issue for maestro Sachin Tendulkar, be it performing for his state or accepting the challenge in Team India colours. 

Sachins back-to-back centuries (the first one, against the West Indies on Wednesday) may be a good sign for India ahead of the World Cup but not the same for Bengal when they took on Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy final at the Wankhede Stadium here on Friday. 

Taking a leaf straight from the script of his 41st ODI century in Vadodara, Sachin was a picture of confidence and aggression and smashed a sizzling 105, which dashed Bengals hopes following Ranadeb Boses twin blows in the beginning. 

Wasim Jaffer, on the other hand, wore a look of caution and restraint, and played second fiddle to Sachin with 112. Thanks to the duos efforts, Mumbai finished Day I at 281 for five. 

Putting Mumbai into bat, Bengal got their expected breakthroughs soon, with Ranadeb reducing the hosts to 14 for two. Sachin then took the centrestage and ignited the Wankhede on way to his 60th first-class century. 

Sachins innings comprised 19 hits to the fence and lasted for 229 minutes while Jaffer made 112 with the help of 16 fours. Sachin completed his hundred in 113 balls with 18 boundaries. 

Sachin and Jaffer stitched a 187-run third-wicket partnership and just when it seemed Mumbai were taking the battle too far away from Deep Dasgupta amp; Co., the Day I script took another twist. 

Offie Sourashish Lahiri sent both batsmen back to the pavilion and Sourav Ganguly capped it off trapping rival captain Amol Muzumdar as Bengal brilliantly bounced back in the final session. 

Rohit Sharma and Abhishek Nair were at the crease when stumps were drawn. 

Keeping the early-morning conditions in mind, Deep opted to bowl on winning the toss and the decision paid off immediately when Ranadeb sent back opener Sahil Kukreja and Wilkin Mota in quick succession. 

The latters dismissal fetched the tall mediumpacer his 50th Ranji Trophy wicket in the season and he now needs two more wickets to touch Utpal Chatterjees feat of 52 wickets (achieved in the 1999-00 season). 

Sourav Sarkar, who rose to the occasion in tandem with Ranadeb in the past, seemed to have lost his rhythm a bit and was wayward. But his job was done by Sourashish, who didnt get enough chance to bowl in the season because of the quicks past show. 

Sourashish was right on target from the outset and his two wickets for 69 runs in 16 overs were a story of supreme grit and resolve. 

Seeing Sachin in murderous mood, Bengal had to switch to plan B and introduced Sourav into the attack. The former India captain, who is known for his golden arm, didnt disappoint once again, sending back Mumbais most prolific run-getter this season, Muzumdar. 

Bengal now can hope to restrict Mumbai within 350 and stand up to the challenge against the likes of Zaheer Khan, Ajit Agarkar and Ramesh Powar. 

Footnote: Bengal selector Saradindu Mukherjee, who hoped to watch the opening days action from the first ball, reached the Wankhede after tea. His flight from Calcutta was delayed by six and a half hours due to fog.

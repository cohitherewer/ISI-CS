Calcutta: The CFL Premier Division is a few days old, but it is already time for two big teams to do battle. 

There is little doubt that the odds are heavily stacked in favour of East Bengal in their clash with Mohammedan Sporting on Tuesday. The defending champions have won both their matches so far without looking too convincing. 

Mohammedan Sporting, on the other hand, have been a picture of struggle. They started off with a defeat against Peerless and managed a draw against George Telegraph. 

What makes their case weaker is the fact that Shabbir Alis team doesnt have a foreigner. This, at a time when foreign players in the East Bengal (Edmilson) and Mohun Bagan (Jose Ramirez Barreto) ranks have started taking centrestage. 

Such handicaps have, however, been overcome in the past with spirited teamwork, making such clashes unpredictable and special. There is as much pressure as promise, as much hope as horror with players trying to live up to expectations of demanding fans. 

Mohammedan Sporting may not be the threat they once were, but East Bengal coach Subrata Bhattacharya is unwilling to take them for granted. 

Mohammedan Sporting have a rich history and the biggest support base in the country. These factors are important because they can motivate you when your morale is down, Bhattacharya told a press conference on Monday. 

He admitted his team was yet to get into groove, but took comfort from the fact that they were going into the match with two wins under the belt. 

Last years captain Alvito DCunha, who is set to start on Tuesday following a two-match suspension, echoed his coachs feeling. 

Winning gives you confidence, and confidence is the key in a big match. We are the defending champions and well retain the title, said the Goanese, who was red-carded in the teams final Premier Division match last season. 

Both Edmilson and Dipendu Biswas have been on target, giving Bhattacharya reason to smile. The only worry for him is the likely unavailability of Mehtab Hussain for 90 minutes. The former Mohun Bagan captain may play a part later in the match, the coach hinted. 

There are problems galore for Bhattacharyas opposite number. The pressure is already on Shabbir, with his team struggling to get off the blocks. He played down the absence of a foreigner and said: We may be a young team, but are capable of playing competitive football. 

Veteran medio Basudeb Mondal also sounded optimistic. East Bengal wont find it easy tomorrow, was his warning to the champions. 

Whatever the result, there will be a long way to go for both teams in the double-leg competition. A loss wont destroy any teams title aspirations, but victory will help its cause in the duels ahead.

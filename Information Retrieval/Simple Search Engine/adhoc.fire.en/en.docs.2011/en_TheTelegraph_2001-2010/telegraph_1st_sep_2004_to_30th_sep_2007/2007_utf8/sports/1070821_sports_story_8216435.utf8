 Relief for Shoaib

Karachi: Shoaib Akhtar won the first round of a disciplinary battle against Pakistan Cricket Board on Monday when an appeals committee suspended the Rs 300,000-fine and a penalty imposed on him by the PCB. 

The two-member committee, comprising former Test captain Imtiaz Ahmed and senior bureaucrat Mueen Afzal, ruled that the board needed to give Shoaib a chance to plead his case. 

The PCB had earlier imposed a fine and docked points from Shoaibs central contract for alleged indiscipline. 

The Board accused the tearaway of leaving a training camp here without taking permission from team manager Talat Ali.

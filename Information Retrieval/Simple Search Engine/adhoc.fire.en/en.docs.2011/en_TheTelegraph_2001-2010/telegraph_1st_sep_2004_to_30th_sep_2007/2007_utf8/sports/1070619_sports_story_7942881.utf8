 Becks says adios, Tinseltown style 

 HENRY WINTER 

David Beckham is ending up in Hollywood and, thrillingly, almost unbelievably, there was a Hollywood ending to his Real Madrid career on Sunday night. The astonishing drama unfolding at the Bernabeu was the stuff of Tinseltown fantasy, yet Beckhams Real turned it into reality. 

Although the LA Galaxy-bound luminary limped off midway through the second half, leaving Jose Antonio Reyes and Mahamadou Diarra to form an unlikely rescue double-act, Beckham departs mainstream football with his head held high, and a La Liga medal around his neck. A star is re-born. 

Draped in the flag of St George, the England international hobbled around during the celebrations, unable to throw himself about with the mad enthusiasm of Raul and company, but his smile told a gleaming story of the pride inside. They could have dimmed the floodlights and Beckhams megawatt beam would have lit up the Bernabeu. 

And then, in a moment of pure theatre, they did kill the lights. They trained a spotlight on the centre-circle, as if awaiting an Olivier or Gielgud to step forward to deliver a Shakespearean soliloquy. Beckhams audience awaited. Bernabeu fell quiet, and then he moved into the light. Holding Cruz in his arms, gripping the hands of Romeo and Brooklyn, Beckham made an emotional walk out to the middle. 

Reals Hola to the title was transformed into Beckhams Adios. The very English strains of Chariots of Fire accompanied him, mixing in with the thunderous applause of the Madrid faithful. El Ingles had given everything for them over four years, and they repaid his every drop of sweat with a flood of gratitude. 

When Beckhams sojourn in Castile is chronicled, it will doubtless be considered of little importance that it was only after his replacement by Reyes that Real saw off a lively Real Mallorca side, who had taken the lead through Varela. 

At that point, with Madrid being torn apart by Mallorcas movement, and Barcelona knocking in goals for fun at Gimnastic (they won 5-1), the watching Tom Cruise must have thought that his own Mission Impossible had been a doddle by contrast. 

Yet Real were determined to write their own script. Cruise leapt from his seat, clapping enthusiastically as Reyes struck twice, and Diarra headed another, to keep Real ahead of Barcelona in the race for La Liga glory. Cruises presence was almost symbolic, signalling the change in Beckhams life from the Castellana to Sunset Boulevard. He heads for the Hollywood Hills, to A-list parties with Cruise and friends, and B-list matches for the Galaxy, with Madrids appreciation ringing in his ears. 

As Raul played the matador with a Real flag for the photographers, Beckham went on a final lap of honour, saluting the fans who will never forget his tireless commitment and dead-ball threat. Clearly overwhelmed, Beckham kissed the centre-circle and then disappeared back-stage, leaving the crowd wanting more. With tickets scarcer than a dry eye at Beckhams farewell, thousands of disciples were happy simply to congregate outside this great cathedral of Castilian football. They had come praying for a first La Liga title in four years, for a glorious send-off to Beckham and Roberto Carlos. 

 Roberto-David read one bannerup in the Gods. The Bernabeu will always be your home. No longer. The Home Depot Center awaits for Beckham in LA. Whatever the concerns over his fitness next season, there can be little doubt about the remarkable nature of Beckhams final days in Madrid.

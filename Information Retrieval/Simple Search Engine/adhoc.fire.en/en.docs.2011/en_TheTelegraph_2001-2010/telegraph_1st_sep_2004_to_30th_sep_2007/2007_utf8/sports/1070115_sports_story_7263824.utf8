 Newcastle stun Tottenham 3-2

 Premier League 

London: An injury-hit Newcastle United stunned Tottenham Hotspur with a 3-2 victory in a pulsating Premier League match at White Hart Lane on Sunday. 

United were under siege for most of the game but hit back to equalise twice before Nicky Butt grabbed an unlikely winner. 

In Sundays other action Andy Johnson headed a late equaliser for Everton in a 1-1 home draw with Reading a point that moved Everton above Tottenham into seventh place. 

Tottenham, who had lost just two home games this season, overwhelmed Newcastles inexperienced defence early on and took the lead after 13 minutes when Jermain Defoe slid into stab home Steed Malbranques low cross. 

Newcastle replied immediately with their first attack of the match, young full back Paul Huntington shooting past Spurs keeper Paul Robinson for his first goal for the club. 

Dimitar Berbatov restored Tottenhams lead eight minutes after halftime and Spurs should have wrapped up the points before Obafemi Martins smashed an unstoppable equaliser with 19 minutes remaining. 

A minute later Martins slid a ball in to Butt who shot right-footed across Robinson. Defoe was denied an equaliser for Tottenham when his snap-shot struck the post. 

At Goodison Park, the biggest cheer was reserved for Hollywood actor Sylvester Stallone who walked on to chants of Rocky, Rocky before the start. 

The American, a guest of Everton shareholder Robert Earl, is in England to promote his new movie Rocky Balboa, but watched on as Reading left the hosts reeling with a 28th-minute goal. 

Everton defender Joleon Lescott was unfortunate when American keeper Tim Howard saved a Steve Hunt header but the ball cannoned into the net off his heel. 

Johnson wasted one good opportunity to level but redeemed himself after 81 minutes when Reading keeper Marcus Hahnemann failed to deal with a flick-on and the England striker nodded the ball into an empty net. 

Everton almost snatched victory in stoppage time when Lee Carsleys free-kick skimmed the roof of the Reading net.

 Marias NY fashion fortnight

New York: When Maria Sharapova defends her US Open title next week, shell be wearing tennis dresses decorated with graphic interpretations of New Yorks skyline. 

The designs, created in collaboration with Nike senior designer Colleen Sandieson, were shown off at a news conference on Wednesday. 

Like last year, Sharapova will have one outfit dedicated for day play and another for night matches. 

Nike has always understood my desire to make a big impression in New York, she said in a statement. 

And the dresses that weve worked on for the US Open have always looked as good as they feel when Im playing. This year is especially exciting because the designs are inspired by the city itself. 

The dress for the night sessions is a bright flaming red in honour of the big apple in a flared shift silhouette. Its a sleek garment made of a breathable wicking jersey and constructed with a no-sew technique with seams bonded with heat and silicone instead of thread. 

There are more than 600 Swarovski crystals incorporated into the design, which makes the dress sparkle. Additionally, there are three crystal buttons down the back, creating a keyhole effect. 

For the daytime, the look is similar but without the flashiness of the crystals. The dress is mostly white with a grey skyline image against a black backdrop. It has a scoop-back design that facilitates movement, according to Sandieson. 

Performance is always the priority, Sandieson said, but she and Sharapova strive for designs that marry function with fashion. 

She has a fantastic game and I have a lot of respect for that, but she has a great eye for detail. Shes got a style thats very natural to her, and she also knows what she likes and doesnt like, Sandieson said. 

Sharapova, 20, has become a player in the fashion world and has sponsorship deals with Parlux fragrances, handbag company Samantha Thavasa and watchmaker Tag Heuer in addition to Nike. (AP)

 Gillespie leads NZ demolition of Kenya

Durban: Mark Gillespie produced a devastating spell of seam bowling to claim four wickets as New Zealand beat minnows Kenya by nine wickets in a group C match of the ICC World Twenty20 at Kingsmead on Wednesday. 

A disciplined Gillespie provided the early breakthroughs and gave away just seven runs in 2.5 overs as a hapless Kenya were skittled out for 73 in 16.5 overs, the lowest-ever total in a Twenty20 International. 

New Zealand achieved the target in just 7.4 overs losing the wicket of Lou Vincent.

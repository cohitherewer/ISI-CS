 Cummins awaits second birth 

 Anderson Cummins

Gros Islet: Paceman Anderson Cummins will become only the second man to play for two teams in the World Cup if he turns out for Canada against Kenya on Wednesday. 

The 40-year-old Barbadian-born fast bowler featured for the West Indies in the 1992 tournament and thought his chances of appearing in another World Cup had long gone. But after moving to Canada in 1996, he became involved in local cricket there and worked his way on to the national team for this years showpiece, allowing him to return to the Caribbean where he is hoping to spring some surprises. 

We recognise that playing to our potential can get us a place in the second round, he said last week. 

Kepler Wessels played for Australia in the 1983 tournament before captaining his native South Africa in the 1992 event after they were readmitted to international sport following the end of apartheid. 

 Graeme Hick, who played for England 

 in the 1992 edition, was in the Zimbabwe squad for the 1983 

 Cup but was not picked for any matches. 

 Cummins is also one of only five players to feature 

 in a squad at the 1992 and 2007 World Cups. He joins illustrious 

 company with Brian Lara, Sachin Tendulkar, Sanath Jayasuriya 

 and Inzamam-ul-Haq the other names.

 Dravid hopes for some cricket

NILESH BHATTACHARYA 

Dhaka: The first thing Rahul Dravid did on Team Indias arrival in Dhaka on Wednesday was to ask the securityman, who presented him with a bouquet, I hope its not raining here? 

The India captains question sounded more like a plea. 

Later, during a speech at a BCB party, it was almost desperation. The BCB is always known for its hospitality. I only wish they can organise some good weather too for the next few days. 

It isnt raining in Dhaka, but the depression that played havoc with the first Test seems to have followed the team to the capital. 

The threat of another washout is the Indian camps No. 1 concern, but Dravid is keeping his fingers crossed that the rain gods will at least give him a chance to test the hosts. 

We are left with only one Test now and desperately looking for some competition, he had said before boarding the flight from Chittagong in the morning. 

(But) Im not going to dwell on the weather, over which I dont have any control. I only hope some cricket will be possible, he said. 

Away from weather, Dravids real concern lies in the bowling department. Zaheer Khan seems to have forgotten that he used to be a line-and-length merchant. Vikram Rajvir Singh and Rudra Pratap Singh are promising, but lack the fear factor. 

Dravid admitted, too, that injuries to key players had upset his plans throughout the series. Every team has cramped international schedules and players have to undertake a tremendous workload. So when you face a few injuries to key players, its not easy to replace them. Its a tough situation and sometimes it affects your plans. I am hopeful that by the time we go to England, everybody will be fit. 

Anil Kumble, who had been down with fever and missed the entire match in Chittagong, has recovered. 

Im feeling better now and raring to go in the second Test, Kumble told Laxman Shivaramakrishnan who had told him that his services had been sorely missed in Chittagong. The former leg-spinner had met up with Kumble while boarding the flight to Dhaka. 

Ahead of the crucial meeting, Habibul Bashar amp; Co. received an unexpected accolade from Dravid. Bangladesh are now a much-improved side. Making the World Cup Super Eight stage at our expense confirms this, Dravid told the gathering at the team hotel. 

Its not clear if this was an acknowledgement of the rivals emerging power, or a mind game ahead of the second Test. 

Similarly, its not clear if India will introduce a new opening duo following Wasim Jaffers pair in the first Test. Dravid refused to panic and defended the Mumbai opener. 

He failed in just one Test. I know hes keen to hit form here, he said in reply to a query from The Telegraph. 

Speaking exclusively, Habibur said the Test would be played on a new pitch. 

The Indians again plan to go in with a five-pronged attack, but it wont be easy to leave out V.V.S. Laxman and Yuvraj Singh a second time. 

Though it was a rest day for Team India, Laxman and Ishant Sharma spent some time at nets indoors. 

It was time away from cricket for Bangladesh also, who arrived here on Tuesday night with a psychological advantage, to quote Bashar. 

The second and final Test begins on Friday.

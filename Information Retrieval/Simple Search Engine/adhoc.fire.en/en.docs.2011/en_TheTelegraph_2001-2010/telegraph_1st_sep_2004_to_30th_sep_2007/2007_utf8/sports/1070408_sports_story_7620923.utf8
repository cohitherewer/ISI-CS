The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Presentation counts, not performance

 - Accountability... just what is that? 

 Gloves Off

 Lokendra Pratap Sahi

 Greg Chappell

Sharad Pawar promised harsh measures after Team India lost to Sri Lanka, which effectively put them on the flight home from the World Cup (confirmation came when Bangladesh beat Bermuda), but the debacles review has seen accountability largely being given a miss. 

Actually, nobody in authority even got a rap on the knuckles, with Greg Chappell rewarded instead of being asked to take the quickest flight home. 

As for the captain, Rahul Dravid, he has been retained till the July-September tour of England. 

Its shocking that the coach only accepted partial responsibility, unlike Dravid, yet Pawar requested him to extend his association with Indian cricket! 

Chappell, therefore, could become the latest consultant from overseas. With the emphasis on the so-called process and vision, Pawar and Co. forgot everybody must eventually be judged on results. 

Intriguingly, the consultant bit wasnt tabled during Saturdays working committee meeting. 

Twenty-three months isnt a short period, but nothing went right on the biggest moments in the Chappell era. Be it the Test series in Pakistan or the Champions Trophy or the tour of South Africa. 

As for the World Cup, the less said the better. 

Team India did have ODI wins at home, but most were against under-strength sides England (2005-06) and Sri Lanka, a couple of months ago. About the only real feather in Chappells cap would be winning the ODIs in Pakistan and the Test series in the West Indies. 

Yet, when Chappell made his audio-visual presentation on Friday, the BCCI mandarins were mesmerised. They were bowled over by what he had to say, but nobody raised the issue of performance. 

Unbelievably, no questions were asked during the working committee meeting either. 

A high-on-vision presentation helped Chappell beat Tom Moody in the summer of 2005. Something similar helped him get a consultants offer. 

Has the BCCI sent the right signal? 

Somebody with questionable man management skills can never wear the coachs hat and former captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth was probably spot-on in saying Chappell gave nothing to Indian cricket. 

Chappell could argue he didnt always get the team of his choice, but thats the challenge of coaching in an environment with pulls and pressures. 

The late Bob Woolmer, for one, adjusted superbly. 

Horror stories are emerging about Chappells behaviour in the dressing room and at team meetings. If a poor shot from X or a bad spell from Y cost India a match, the coach would keep talking about that lapse. 

It affected the players morale and had such a negative impact that confidence suffered, one of the administrators told The Telegraph. 

That Chappell couldnt manage the dressing room became evident within four months of his succeeding John Wright. One is referring to his much-publicised spat with the then captain, Sourav Ganguly. 

Ask any coach and hell accept man management is the biggest component at the highest level. Somebody who has come through the ranks, for example, has to be treated somewhat differently from a rookie. 

Chappell may have wanted to bust the star-system, but it couldve been attempted differently. Not at the cost of breaking Team India. 

Even if Wright had weaknesses, he was an outstanding man manager. Thats why hes respected, quite in the manner of Pakistans Intikhab Alam. 

One wont forget Intikhab massaging Imran Khans worn out shoulders on the eve of the 1992 World Cup final, at the MCG. Kabhi kabhi yeh sab bhi karna parta hai, hed remarked, getting his captain to grin. 

By the next evening, the world was at Imrans feet. 

Its strange that Pawar encouraged the (failed) move aimed at getting Chappell to reconsider not wanting an extension. 

It was driven by the need to rein in Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav. Perhaps, even Harbhajan Singh and Virender Sehwag, who has become everybodys favourite whipping boy. 

Fix the seniors has been topping the agenda of some in the amateurs-run BCCI. Its possible the seniors are at fault, but the solution doesnt lie in fixing them. Indeed, a few would probably be glad to wring the necks of some in the BCCI. 

Bold decisions do need to be taken, but theyve got to be cricket-driven, not with an agenda. Even if its intervention cant exactly be welcomed, the working committee has been smart in directing the selectors to pick a young team for Bangladesh. 

It makes sense to send the Manoj Tewaris and Rohit Sharmas. Even the Ranadeb Boses. If were intimidated by Bangladesh, theres nothing to say. 

However, the Tewaris shouldnt be used as pawns.

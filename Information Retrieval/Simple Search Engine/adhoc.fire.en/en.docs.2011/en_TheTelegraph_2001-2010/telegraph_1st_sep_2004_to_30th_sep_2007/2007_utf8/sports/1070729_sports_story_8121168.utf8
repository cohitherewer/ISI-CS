The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A captain 

 must be willing to be unpopular...

 - Mike Brearley on captaincy, handling Sir Ian and mental 

 toughness 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL

 Mike Brearley

Nottingham: 

 Most captains have, at some point or the other, read 

 Mike Brearleys Art of Captaincy. Theyve 

 done so with good reasons, for Brearleys record as 

 the England captain was outstanding 18 wins (four losses) 

 in 31 Tests and 15 in 25 ODIs. Now 65, the intensely private 

 Brearley spoke to The Telegraph for close to half-an-hour 

 on Saturday afternoon. Incidentally, hes going to 

 be the next MCC president.

 The following are 

 excerpts:

 On whether, with experience, 

 sportspersons can become mentally tougher

 Yes... However, like the other 

 human qualities, something is (already) there... Toughness 

 comes from realising that nothing comes easy... Comes by 

 learning from people whore tough in the mind... Comes 

 from winning, which gives pleasure, and realising that you 

 want to be a winner...

 On having been an exemplary 

 man manager

 (Smiles) Theres no 

 formula as such... Youve got to be straightforward 

 with people... On the whole, you may want to be nice and 

 enjoy a good atmosphere, but a captain must be willing to 

 be unpopular... Sometimes, you have to tell people what 

 they dont want to hear... But youve also got 

 to say things that people are pleased to hear... Encourage 

 people, but also be ready to confront them when things havent 

 gone right.

 On whether he would always 

 be calm in the dressing room

 Actually, you should be asking 

 those who played under me for England and Middlesex... I 

 suppose youll get different answers... I could be 

 calm... Could be involved... Could be agitated... I could 

 behave differently.

 On handling (now Sir) Ian Botham

 He wasnt so temperamental... 

 He was young... Gifted... Close to being a near-genius with 

 whatever he did... Of course Botham had his moments, like 

 we all do, but would work hard and play for the team... 

 He would have ideas and would always be attacking. He had 

 the enthusiasm of youth, the enthusiasm of a near-genius.

 On whether it still was challenging 

 to handle Sir Ian

 No... It was terrific having him 

 in the team... We did have the odd flare-up, but thats 

 it. He couldve become difficult (to handle) later 

 in his career, the time when he wasnt so fit... Not 

 when I was the captain... Perhaps, he became difficult after 

 becoming unhappy with the way some things had gone...

 On whether its tougher 

 in the mind for todays cricketers

 In some ways, because of the itineraries... 

 What makes it more difficult is that the players are into 

 such a high percentage of international cricket... They 

 dont play much domestic cricket, where the intensity 

 isnt the same... Im happy that England have 

 gone back to allowing the regulars to play for their Counties... 

 It was different when Duncan Fletcher was the coach. For 

 those constantly playing at the international level, domestic 

 cricket allows recovery... Some relaxation...

 On his advice to todays 

 cricketers

 The same things I would say to 

 somebody in some other walk of life learn to manage your 

 mind... Youve got to enjoy what youre doing... 

 Essentially, the game has remained the same, but the batsmen 

 are more attacking and theres greater emphasis on 

 fielding.

 On, being a psychoanalyst, 

 his take on Marcus Trescothick becoming a victim of stress

 I have no first-hand information, 

 dont have the inside story... It cant only be 

 cricket-related, otherwise everybody would be having the 

 same problem.

 On whether he admires any non-cricketer 

 for his/her mental toughness

 Actually, I dont watch a 

 lot of other sports... I watch some soccer (particularly 

 Arsenals matches) and rugby... A tiny bit of tennis... 

 I quite like Wayne Rooney... Like the way he has reined 

 himself in without losing his flair... Remember, he got 

 propelled into being a public figure at a very young age... 

 Roger Federer, obviously, is a special player... I recall 

 what Fred Titmus said its hard enough getting 

 to the top, even harder staying there...

 On Tiger Woods

 Dont follow golf at all.

 On what it takes to be successful

 The ambition has to be very strong... 

 Youve got to have the capacity to refresh yourself... 

 Thats necessary when you become a little complacent 

 or routine... Like a Federer, youve got to keep the 

 momentum going.

 On whether theres a change 

 in his view that cricket has seen very few good 

 captains

 Well, to talk of the present, 

 (Michael) Vaughan is good and Nasser Hussain was pretty 

 good too... Im not that sure about (Rahul) Dravid... 

 Hes a decent bloke, great at concentration, but... 

 I think Steve Waugh was a good captain and, before him, 

 (Mark) Taylor... Ricky Ponting has improved... He wasnt 

 that good in the 2005 Ashes... Hed been defensive 

 then.

 On Sri Lankan Mahela Jayawardene, 

 winner of the ICCs first Captain of the Year award 

 (2006)

 Havent seen enough of him, 

 but it seems he could be good.

 On what makes a good captain

 Im sure Ive given 

 you the answer in earlier interviews... It has a lot to 

 do with making the right decisions and getting enough decisions 

 right... The ability to get the best out of the players, 

 being strong tactically... There are quite a few ingredients... 

 A tunnel vision doesnt help.

 Finally, the impact a captain 

 can have

 Huge... Could have a huge impact... 

 Yes, its said that captains are as good as their teams, 

 but while you cant turn a bunch of donkeys into derby 

 winners, you can certainly make them better donkeys! (Adds 

 laughing) Or, worse!

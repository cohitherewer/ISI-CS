 - I dont think I am missing any player, says Bob Houghton

New Delhi: The All India Football Federation and national coach Bob Houghton will face their first real test in almost a year when the ONGC Nehru Cup kicks off at the floodlit Ambedkar Stadium here on Friday. 

Hosts India will take on Cambodia in the inaugural match of the five-team round robin tournament. 

Ever since he took over the reins in June 2006, British coach Bob Houghton has complained of lack of opportunities for the National team. Houghton had a point; in the last calendar year Indian seniors played just three matches, all three World Cup qualifiers. 

The AIFF seems to have finally got Houghtons point, and acceded to the demands. The domestic calendar was set aside as the National team got top priority. 

From the start of the season, players have spent more time with the National team rather than their club sides. Forget doing duty, some players have trained for a mere five days with their clubs. 

So much so, that Houghton admitted on Friday that this was perhaps the best team he could raise. I dont think I am missing any player from the first eleven at least. 

Keen to ensure nothing goes wrong, the AIFF arranged for a pre-season training-cum-exposure trip to Portugal, which proved particularly fruitful. 

Extreme care has also been taken while chalking out plans for the Nehru Cup and for the first time it has been reduced to an all-Asian affair. 

It is no secret that sponsors would have liked the 13th edition of the Nehru Cup to be a more glamorous one. The AIFF-Houghton combination, however, preferred to invite only those teams, who India could match, if not better. They were in no mood to leave their team battered and shattered against superior rivals in the name of glamour. 

From amongst the four invited teams, Cambodia (170) and Bangladesh (172) are ranked below India (162) in the Fifa rankings while the other two Kyrgyzstan (152)) and Syria (113) are better placed but definitely not beyond Indias reach. 

To cut a long story short, the planning has been perfect. The onus is now on Houghton and his boys led by Bhaichung Bhutia to do a perfect execution. In Delhi , all agencies have joined hands to make the Nehru Cup a great success. The sponsors have pumped in huge cash; the local government has installed the floodlights in record time; the Municipal Corporation has worked tirelessly to give the stadium a new look. 

Not surprisingly, expectations are running high. Its payback time for Houghton and his boys. 

President Pratibha Patil will inaugurate the tournament. The match kicks off at 6.30pm.

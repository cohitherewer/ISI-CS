 Haryana villages have had enough

Mumbai: Twenty eight villages in Haryana, which produced Indias greatest allrounder Kapil Dev, have banned cricket barely two weeks after the national teams shocking first-round exit from the World Cup. 

We all have taken this decision and those who go against it will have to face a social boycott. Weve enshrined this in the Panchayat records of 28 villages, said Tewa Singh, head of Dadan Panchayat. 

We will stop playing it (cricket). We will play kabaddi, football, volleyball and wrestling instead, Pankaj, a resident of the village, said. 

Indias Cup frenzy had been fuelled by television channels and media outlets touting the team as one of the favourites. (Reuters)

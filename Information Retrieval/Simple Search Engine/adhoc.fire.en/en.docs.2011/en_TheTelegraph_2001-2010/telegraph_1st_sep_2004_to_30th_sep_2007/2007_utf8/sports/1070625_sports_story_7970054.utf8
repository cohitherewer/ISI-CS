The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 It will be difficult this time, says Mauresmo

Clive White

This time there will be no World Cup to overshadow her achievement, no Zinedine Zidane to head-butt his way past her into the headlines of the French media. All Amelie Mauresmo has to do is play through seven rounds of Wimbledon again, while nursing an injury to her adductors, and the limelight should be all hers this time. 

Knowing her luck, grass court sensation and fellow compatriot Nicolas Mahut will probably come through to win the mens event 24 hours later. 

But Mauresmos not bitter, even about finishing runner-up to Laure Manaudou, the swimmer, in Frances version of Sports Personality of the Year. What do I have to do to win it, she asked, half-jokingly. Win all four Grand Slams? 

She has started off the grass court season in the manner to which shes become accustomed. If its anything like last year, shell know exactly where she stands in her opening match against Jamea Jackson of the US. 

I think the first match last year really gave me a rhythm for the whole tournament, she said. I wasnt feeling so good in Eastbourne the week before but I arrived at Wimbledon for the first match and felt great. My game came together at that moment. 

She doesnt accept that it could be more difficult going back to defend her title. Itll be difficult this year, it was difficult last year, she said. 

If she is perfectly sound she will be hard to beat and perhaps the French media will then give her the respect she deserves.

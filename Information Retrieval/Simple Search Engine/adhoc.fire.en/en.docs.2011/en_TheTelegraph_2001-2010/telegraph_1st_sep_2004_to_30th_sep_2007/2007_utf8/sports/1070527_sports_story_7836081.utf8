 Saving this Test will be tough: Ashraful

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Dhaka: The writing is clear on the wall for the hosts. Bangladesh vice-captain Mohammed Ashraful knows it will be tough to save this Test. 

Bangladesh finished Day II at 58 for 5, in reply to Indias 610 for three declared. 

Ashraful, who was dismissed for a duck, said: Saving the game will be tough, I must say. But its Test cricket and there is still a long way to go. We have to look at the whole scenario session by session. If we rectify our mistakes in the second innings and put up a fight, anything can happen. 

The middle-order bat, tipped to take over captaincy from Habibul Bashar, also tried not to read much into the collapse of the top-order. 

These things can happen in Test cricket and may have some (adverse) effect on the players mental make-up. But we are professionals and should not be affected by our performance (in the innings) for long, he said. 

As if getting dismissed for a nought was not enough, Ashraful had a harrowing time as he scrambled to answer persistent queries on the hosts decision to field first. Coach Dav Whatmore had admitted to misreading the wicket on Friday and insisted fielding first was an unanimous decision. 

Ashraful struggled for words while trying to explain the decision and whether any of his teammates felt that batting would have been a better option. 

Finally, the media manager whispered something into his ears. It was a team decision, I cannot say anything more on this, Ashraful said diplomatically. 

We saw the Indian team field five bowlers. We thought that moisture would remain on the surface and we could use it... So we took the decision, he added.

 A formidable task ahead of Sania

 In the Indian sporting world, Sania travels on a monorail at the highest visibility level. Just about everybody watches Sanias progress. When Sania injured her knee in a tournament at Doha last week, there was much concern at a national level about her well being. It was very sad to see her picture in the newspaper, coming out of the hospital in a wheelchair. Her face told the whole story. The smile and sparkle was no longer there. Instead there was sadness and anguish. The plump cheeks are now lean and taut proclaiming a high fitness level. 

At the Bangalore WTA meet, she had trimmed down, looked stronger, was moving faster and had improved her backhand and consistency. She fought hard and came from behind to win some of her matches. With the French Open and Wimbledon only a couple of months away, Sania seemed to be on the right track. 

Though winning Grand Slam titles is out of the question at this stage of her career, one was looking forward to her possible clashes against top tenners on show courts with Sania blasting away with her forehand. On the show courts there is always a stir when Sania plays. Abroad, everyone wants to see the Indian Girl. A 3-4 week layoff will make it very difficult, if not impossible, for Sania to achieve peak form for the French or Wimbledon championships. 

While recovering, Sania will need to keep working hard on the other muscles in her body. The loss in competitive sharpness cannot be regained instantly. It needs to be honed slowly and with patience. Total rehabilitation could take a minimum of 6-8 weeks. Sanias new trainer seems to have done a very good job but one cannot rule out the possibility that Sanias physical programme, with all good intent, may have been a bit rushed and overdone. 

Though the doctors have said that the injury would have been more serious but for the physical training she was doing, I have always been wary about foreign trainers and coaches. Genetically, we Indians are different. Our physique, muscles, temperaments are cast in a different mould from people in other parts of the world and need to be handled differently. A sculptor who sculpts from stone cannot be expected to be at his best with softer or different raw material. By the time foreign coaches and trainers learn to handle more delicate Indian raw material, they are often sacked. 

We have to learn from the Krishnan family who made their mark internationally with their own training regimes without pumping weights or doing thousands of push-ups, star-jumps, etc. Sania seems to be injury prone. By 20 years of age she has already battled with injuries in her ankles and the lower abdomen. She needs to be patient and also pay heed to what her body tells her. Since most injuries are due to overuse of limbs and muscles, may be Sania should tone down her physical training programme, reduce practise time and increase recovery time after hard sessions. 

Unfortunately the high level of commercial endorsements and appearances hinder recovery and drain energy which needs to be conserved. All these factors have to be balanced so that her rankings stay at a level where she can have direct entry without qualifying for the major tournaments and Grand Slams. Akhtar Alis suggestion of Sania not playing in doubles events will also help greatly if heeded to. 

The task ahead for Sania is formidable. Till some years ago, womens tennis lacked depth and more often than not the top 8 seeds used to come through to the quarters without any difficulty. But, unfortunately for Sania, there has been almost a tidal wave of Russians, Slovaks, Serbians, Croatians, 16 to 18 years olds, swamping the rankings. 

Almost all of them are bigger, physically stronger and more athletic than Sania. This brigade, now entrenched at the gates of the top 10, will make it difficult for Sania to find higher place in the rankings. To tackle the brawn and power of the top ten, some of who can serve at an amazing 200 kph, Sania will need to develop a special strategy and tactical astuteness. Since she cannot match their brawn, Sania could use their power by hitting an earlier ball like in judo when you use your opponents strength to unbalance him. 

Besides, Sania will need to improve her volleying skills and use the lob more frequently. Coming back from injury and working her way to higher rankings is, by any standards, a formidable task. 

She must not lose focus, be patient and with her steely resolve and walk the tightrope to the top. We want to see the smile and sparkle back on Sanias face. She must remember Justine Henins slogan: Impossible is nothing and achieve her potential.

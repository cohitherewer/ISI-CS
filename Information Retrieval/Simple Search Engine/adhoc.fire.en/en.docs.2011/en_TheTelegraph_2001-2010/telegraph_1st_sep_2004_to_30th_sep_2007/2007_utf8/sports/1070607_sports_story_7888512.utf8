 One year on, Woods is happier than expected

 Tiger Woods 

Tulsa (US): With the birth of a new baby expected in July, Tiger Woods is in a much happier frame of mind than he ever anticipated he would be at this same time last year. 

This year is totally different, Woods said Monday. From losing a father to certainly becoming a father... My life is in two totally different places a polar 180 from one another. 

The 12-time major championship winner and his wife, Elin, are expecting their first baby sometime in July and the bundle of joy comes along a little over a year since he mourned the loss of his father, Earl, who died of cancer. 

Speaking to a luncheon to help promote the 2007 PGA Championship in Tulsa, Woods said that with a new baby on the way his expected break from the tour might straddle the period both before and after the birth. 

His next scheduled event is the US Open from June 14-17 in Oakmount, Pennsylvania. Woods finished tied for 15th at the Memorial tournament last weekend in Columbus, Ohio. 

As of now, Woods has just one tournament on his calendar for July with that being the British Open. 

Woods said he plans to stay close to home as much as possible until after the birth. Beyond that its anybodys guess how much he will play. 

Im pacing myself already just because of the fact that I have a baby coming up, he said. I dont know how much Im going to play after that or how much Im going to play before that. 

A lot of that is depending on what happens and the health of Elin and our child. 

Woods said immediately after the death of his father, he couldnt concentrate or think clearly on the practice greens. But his presence of mind is different now. 

A year ago at this time my father had just passed, and it was I hadnt played until I guess it would be next week, the week of the Open, a Tour event since Augusta. 

I just wasnt quite ready. I wasnt quite able to get back into it with my practice sessions because every time Id go to practise Id always think about my fundamentals. And who taught me my fundamentals but my father. 

It was actually hard to get away from it because a lot of the things I learned how to do in the game came from my father. So that was probably a more difficult task than actually getting back on the golf course because I have so many great memories of being with my dad on the golf course. 

Woods said he would be thinking of his father if he plays in the 2007 PGA Championship because Tulsa is just a couple of hours drive from Manhattan, Kansas, where his father was born and raised.

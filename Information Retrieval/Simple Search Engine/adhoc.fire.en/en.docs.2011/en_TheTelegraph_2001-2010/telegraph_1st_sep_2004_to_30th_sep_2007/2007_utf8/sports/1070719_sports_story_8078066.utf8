Carnoustie: Jeev Milkha Singh will make his British Open debut in the illustrious company of former Open champion Tom Lehman and Australian Nick Hern at the 136th edition of the worlds oldest major at the Carnoustie Golf Club on Thursday. 

The 34-year-old Indian, who is currently ranked 57th, has a record of making the cut in each of the four majors he has started in. Two of those came this year, first when he had debuted at the Augusta Masters and finished 37th, and the second in the last month at his third US Open, where he finished 36th. 

Lehman, 48, won the British Open in 1996 at Royal Lytham and St Annes and in 2000, he was tied fourth at St Andrews. 

Hern, on the other hand, has been playing the Open for the fifth time but has missed the cut on two occasions. 

Jeev is drawing inspiration from Korean K.J. Chois memorable triumphs in PGA Tour events over the last two months and has said: If KJ can do it, why not us? Thats how I feel. Hes a good player and its a big encouragement for the rest of the guys, especially when he had come out from the Asian Tour. Obviously, the next step is to win a major. Its a matter of a few years. 

Tiger Woods is eyeing his third successive Open title and can well be assured of no disturbance as the Open management committee has banned mobile phones on the course. 

However, Gary Player dropped a bombshell on the eve of the Open by saying that Tour golfers are taking performance-enhancing drugs and escaping sanction because the sport does not have dope testing. 

I know there are golfers doing it (taking drugs), whether its HGH (human growth hormone), whether its creatine or whether its steroids, I know for a fact some golfers are doing it, Player said on Wednesday. 

The greatest thing that (Open organisers) the R amp;A (Royal and Ancient), the USGA and PGA can do is have tests at random. Its absolutely essential we do that.

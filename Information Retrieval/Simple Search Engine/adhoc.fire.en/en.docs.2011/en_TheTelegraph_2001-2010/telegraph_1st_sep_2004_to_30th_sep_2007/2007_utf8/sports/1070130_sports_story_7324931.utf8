 Sania back among top-50

New Delhi: Despite a second round exit at the Australian Open, Sania Mirza was back among the worlds top-50, gaining five spots to be placed at 48th in the latest WTA Tour rankings. 

The 20-year-old defeated Ukrainian Olga Savchuk in the first round, before going down tamely to Japans Aiko Nakamura in the first Grand Slam of the year. 

Sania was benefited by the drop in rankings of Americans Shenay Perry and an out of scene Venus Williams, as well as Russian Elena Vesnina. 

Shikha Uberoi, the next highest Indian, dropped 20 places to be 228th. 

Australian Open champion Serena Williams had a steep climb from 81st to 14th, while finalist Maria Sharapova took over from Justine Henin-Hardenne at the top. 

Nicole Vaidisova, who made it all the way to the last four, entered into the top-10 by gaining three spots at ninth. Another semi-finalist, Kim Clijsters moved one place up to fourth. 

Sania, who teamed up with Spaniard Anabel Medina Garrigues to make it to the third round in womens doubles, gained two spots to be at 23rd position. 

Shikha is the only other Indian in the top 100 at number 92. 

Among men, Leander Paes, who did not have a great run in Melbourne with Martin Damm, dropped two places to 12th on the ATP rankings. 

Mahesh Bhupathi, who reached the quarterfinals with Czech Radek Stepanek, rose two spots to 27th.

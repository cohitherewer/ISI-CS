 Sampras backs Federer to do a Nicklaus 

Los Angeles: Five years after retiring from top-level tennis, Pete Sampras is confident he can still challenge the best over three sets on his favourite grasscourt surface. 

The former world No. 1 bemoans the dearth of serve-and-volley players in the modern game and is eager to take on Roger Federer in a series of exhibition matches later this year. 

Grass is such a unique surface, I can probably still be competitive against anyone in a two-out-of-three (sets) match, Sampras said during a World TeamTennis conference call on Tuesday. 

I can still hold serve and am volleying pretty well. Grass is definitely a surface that is a bit of an advantage considering the guys staying back like they are today, you know. 

Sampras, an unabashed fan of Federer who is bidding to win his fifth successive Wimbledon title, is looking forward to locking horns with the Swiss in Asia later this year. 

People are going to be interested in the outcome, Sampras said. I dont think I am going to win any of those matches, but if I can push him to a few (tie) breakers, I would feel ecstatic. 

Sampras said he thinks Federer will capture 18 major singles titles before his career is over, as many as Jack Nicklaus has, to lead golfs all-time major list. 

Inevitably, he is breaking all my records, Sampras said. I think hes on way to breaking my 14 and winning as many as Nicklaus. 

Sampras, who will be inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame on July 14, acquitted himself well in a practice match with Federer in Los Angeles earlier this year. 

I think my game matched up reasonably well against his. (Agencies)

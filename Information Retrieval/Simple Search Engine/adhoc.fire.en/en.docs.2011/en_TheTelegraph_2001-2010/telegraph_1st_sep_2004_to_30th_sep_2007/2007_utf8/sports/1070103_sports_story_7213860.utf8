The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Deep praise for Dinda

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bengal captain Deep Dasgupta was all-praise for Ashok Dinda after their first days play against Hyderabad at Uppal in Hyderabad. 

To be honest, Dinda bowled with a lot of heart. However, Dinda is not satisfied. Ill be happy if the team does well by bowling them out inside 300 tomorrow morning. The idea will be to attack on one side and defend from the other. 

About his performance, Dinda said: I didnt try anything extra, but maintained a line and length.

 Inzamam wish

Karachi: Inzamam-ul-Haq wants to retire in an honourable manner after playing Test cricket for some more time. I am not going to play for long but I do want to play a few more Tests as I think I can still contribute to Pakistan cricket, Inzamam said. 

But the selectors should not make such a big issue of these things. I want to play Test matches but honourably and I also want to finally retire in a honourable manner, Inzamam said. (PTI)

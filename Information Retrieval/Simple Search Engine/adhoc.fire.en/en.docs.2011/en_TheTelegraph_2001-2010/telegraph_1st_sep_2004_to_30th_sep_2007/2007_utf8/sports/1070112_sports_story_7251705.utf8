 Footballer dies during training

Asuncion: Paraguayan footballer Sixto Rojas collapsed during a training session on Wednesday and died almost immediately afterwards, a hospital spokesman said. 

The cause of death is probably a brain embolism, said Roberto Almiron, a doctor at the San Jorge hospital to which Rojas was taken. 

The 24-year-old, who had played in Chile, was training in a public park with first division club Sportivo Trinidense when he collapsed, his close friend Roque Avalos said. 

Were stunned, Avalos said. 

Sixto had dedicated himself to a career in football and his death is a tragedy. We want to draw attention to the sporting and health authorities over this incident.

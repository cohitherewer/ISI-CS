 Dhoni rules out fatigue

Johannesburg: The ICC World Twenty20 is just what India need to refresh themselves after their recent tour of England, according to new captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. 

I dont think fatigue will have any impact on the team. If you are playing for India, you are always busy. We had a long tour to Ireland and England. The England tour was very tiring and exhausting but this is a World Cup and that brings excitement, freshness and confidence to the team, Dhoni told reporters on Monday. 

The Jharkhand batsman said the players have to approach the tournament with an open mind as the pressing schedule had left little time for preparation. 

Just 48 hours to have a strategy To be open-minded is very important. We will plan with help from support staff. We have just one Twenty20 International. We will have to adapt and adapt quickly, Dhoni said. 

I never even dreamed of playing for my country, so to captain India is a massive bonus, Dhoni said. 

They flew straight to South. 

India face Scotland in Durban in their first match on Thursday night.

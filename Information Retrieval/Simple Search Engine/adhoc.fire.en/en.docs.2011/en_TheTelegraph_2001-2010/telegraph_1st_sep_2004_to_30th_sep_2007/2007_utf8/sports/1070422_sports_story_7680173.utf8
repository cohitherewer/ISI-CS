 We have the ability to win Cup: Pollock

 Shaun Pollock 

Bridgetown: South Africa fast bowler Shaun Pollock may not have a five-wicket haul in the ongoing World Cup, but is silently setting up his teams victories with his discipline. 

He has so far grabbed seven wickets in nine matches, but his captain Graeme Smith is not complaining because the paceman has been doing with the new ball what is expected of him. 

Pollock creates pressure with his probing line and length and his teammates exploit it when batsmen try to take liberties against them in a bid to step up the run rate. 

Pollock has had two expensive wicketless matches in the tournament when he gave away 83 runs in 10 overs against defending champions Australia and 46 in eight against Sri Lanka, but soon bounced back. 

The fast bowler believes his team can win the Cup for the first time since making their debut in 1992. 

I believe we have the ability. If we get it right on the day, we have shown we can beat anyone, he said recently. 

I believe there is something special about this one. And it will be extra special for me because it will be my last one, Pollock said. 

Many captains have faded away from the scene after their teams failures in the World Cup, but Pollock is one of the few who are still enjoying the game as players.But Pollock, the first South African to bag 400 Test wickets, and Sri Lankan Sanath Jayasuriya are the two who led their sides in 2003 but are still playing here as players and delivering. 

The South African paceman, whose father and uncle also represented the country with distinction, entered the World Cup in excellent form as he was named Man-of-the-Match against Pakistan in a home one-day series. 

He is not only a quality paceman, but also an effective batsman down the order having scored more than 3,000 runs in both Tests and one-dayers. Pollock has so far taken 416 wickets in Tests and 380 in the shorter version of the game.

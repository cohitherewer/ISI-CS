The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its good to be back: Shoaib

 - Asif was feeling the pressure of vice-captaincy: PCB source

 Glasgow: Shoaib Akhtar 

 has lost some hair, but he appeared to suggest he hasnt 

 lost any of his pace. 

 Its good to be back... 

 Its such a nice feeling, the controversial Pakistan 

 spearhead told The Telegraph on 

 Sunday evening. 

Of course, Im raring to go... Im fit for big-time cricket, Shoaib, whose last appearance was in January (Port Elizabeth Test versus South Africa), added. 

The 31-year-old hasnt played an ODI for ten months, though. Hes expected to make his comeback on Tuesday, against India. 

The Pakistani selectors, meanwhile, removed quick Mohammed Asif from the vice-captaincy after just one ODI series (May, in Abu Dhabi) as they felt he was feeling the pressure. 

It became apparent that Asif was feeling the pressure... Thats the last thing anybody wanted and, so, Salman Butt was made Shoaib Maliks deputy, pointed out a top Pakistan Cricket Board source. 

Opener Butt, marked out as a future captain in early 2005, will be the No.2 till the end of the year. Im happy... By the grace of Allah, I wont disappoint, he said. 

 The Shoaibs and the Butts had been hoping to warm-up 

 for Tuesdays face-off by making the most of the ODI 

 versus Scotland (in neighbouring Edinburgh) but, because 

 of the weather, not a ball could be bowled.

 Winning is a good habit: Mahela

 Mahela Jayawardene 

St Georges: Sri Lanka ended New Zealands unbeaten World Cup run with an untroubled six-wicket win in their Super Eight match at the Grenada National Stadium on Thursday. The 1996 champions are now equal with New Zealand and holders Australia, who have a game in hand, on eight points. 

After losing the toss we managed to control things, captain Mahela Jayawardene told a news conference. We are not a one-man team. Over the last 12 to 16 months we have had injury problems. We adapt to whatever combination that we play. Vaasy put his hand up and really performed and so did Murali. 

Winning is a good habit. We certainly wouldnt like to go (against Australia) with a losing mentality, he said. 

Jayawardene didnt fault Stephen Flemings decision to bat first. 

I would have probably done the same had I won the toss. It got slower in the afternoon and 260 probably would have been a tough target, remarked Jayawardene. 

Jayawardene revealed his side wanted to make sure they didnt give Shane Bond and Daniel Vettori some early success while chasing. 

We knew they were two strike bowlers for New Zealand and didnt want to give them early wickets. I am happy Sanath and Sangakkara put on a good partnership and didnt rush things. 

He said Sri Lanka didnt miss the services of Lasith Malinga who was out of the game with an ankle injury. We have players who can step in and keep the pressure. 

Jayawardene once again gave a good bowl to part-time off-spinner Tillekeratne Dilshan even though frontline bowlers Dilhara Fernando and Fervez Mahroof didnt go through their overs. 

Thats because I wanted to have more than two-bowler option in the final 10 overs. I wanted to make sure I had more than two options in the death overs, he added.

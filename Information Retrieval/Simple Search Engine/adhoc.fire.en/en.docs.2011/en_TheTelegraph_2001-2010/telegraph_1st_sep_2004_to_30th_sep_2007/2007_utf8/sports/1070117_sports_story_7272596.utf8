Melbourne: Indian star Sania Mirza came through a testing first round against Ukraines Olga Savchuk to start her Australian Open campaign on a bright note on Tuesday. 

Sania, No. 53 in the world, showed maturity in capitalising on her rivals numerous double-faults and unforced errors to emerge a 6-3, 7-5 winner in an hour and a half. 

In the second round, Sania will play Japanese Aiko Nakamura who beat Eleni Daniilidou 6-4, 6-0. The Indian had beaten Nakamura in their lone previous meeting. 

Sania said she had a better game now than when she was ranked in the 30s in late 2005. 

Im a more complete player these days. I believe I am better than when I was No. 30 in the world. I am 53 now, but play much better tennis today, said the 20-year-old. 

I feel a lot fitter, Im moving a lot better. Probably the serve is my weakest point right now, but its not exactly a weakness... Its just a matter of consolidating on that and playing some quality matches, she said. 

Savchuk helped Sanias cause in the first set by committing six double-faults. The Hyderabad girl held her service games and also benefitted from frequent approaches to the net. 

After bagging the first set in 44 minutes, Sania came under pressure as the 102nd-ranked Savchuk cut down on her errors and began to match the Indian stroke for stroke. 

Unforced errors, however, returned to haunt the Ukrainian. Savchuk broke Sania twice but herself dropped serve thrice to let her opponent off the hook. 

Tennis is really growing in India as a sport. I got so many messages today from people saying they were going to sleep early so they could get up early in the morning to see my match on TV. Ive never seen or heard of that before, people following tennis in such a big way, Sania said. 

It is a good feeling (being a role model), and everything has its pros and cons. But its great when someone comes up and says I picked up a tennis racket because of you. 

You need a role model to look up to and when you look at someone doing it from your own country, you start believing you can do it too, said Sania. 

A lot of people are picking up tennis rackets and I just hope that five, six years from now we have not just one woman tennis player but a few more.

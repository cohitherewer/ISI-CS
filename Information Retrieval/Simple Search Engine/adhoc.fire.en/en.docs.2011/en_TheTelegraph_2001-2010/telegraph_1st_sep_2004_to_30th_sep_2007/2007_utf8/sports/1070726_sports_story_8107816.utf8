 Raina: Ill start batting after Glosters nod

 - Middle-order bat turns up in Nottingham 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Suresh Raina 

Nottingham: On Wednesday afternoon, a hassled Rudra Pratap Singh was pacing up and down near the team hotel, Crowne Plaza. Id given the directions to a friend Im looking for him now, he said. 

The friend turned out to be young Suresh Raina, who is working towards a Team India comeback after surgery on his left knee in April. 

Ive come to get (physio) John Glosters opinion Ive resumed training, but will start batting after his okay, Raina

 told The Telegraph. 

Once seen as former coach Greg Chappells blue-eyed boy, Raina wasnt picked for the World Cup and injured himself during the National One-Dayers. 

Whats encouraging is that hes among the probables for the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 meet. Thats in mid-September. 

According to Gloster, recovery could take six months, but Raina had been shaping up just fine. I havent seen him today yet, but he has been recovering very well from complete reconstruction of that knee 

Raina is likely to be around for two-three days.

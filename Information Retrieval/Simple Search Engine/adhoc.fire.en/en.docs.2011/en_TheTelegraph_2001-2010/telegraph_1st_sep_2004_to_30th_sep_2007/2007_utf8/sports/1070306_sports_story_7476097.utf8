Calcutta: Chima Okeries philosophy is to seize on an opportunity, however minuscule it may be. For him, self-belief is the key to self-defence against all odds. 

Come Tuesday, Chimas faith in the youth will be in full evidence as Mohun Bagan take on Tampines Rovers in a group E tie of the AFC Cup at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

Minus Bhaichung Bhutia and Jose Ramirez Barreto, Mohun Bagans Dream Team is witnessing a nightmare. But nothing seems tricky enough to unsettle the brawny Nigerian. 

Chimas youth policy inspired by Arsene Wenger almost deflated East Bengals ego about a week ago. Their show against the arch-rivals (though Mohun Bagan lost 0-1) was hailed as a harbinger of things to come under Chima. He revealed on Monday that the same line of aggression would be applied against the Singapore club. 

Apart from the Bhaichung-Barreto setback, Mohun Bagan defence will be vulnerable by Mehrajuddian Wadaos absence. Dulal Biswas and Favio are doubtful starters due to injury; there will be no Dharamjit Singh in midfield and last but not the least, the team is struggling to stay in contention for the National League. 

True, Douglas da Silva is set to make his debut in green and maroon colours on Tuesday, following a stint with East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting. His presence may give a semblance of composure in the backline. But can Chima plot the Singapore clubs fall with the Lalawmpuias and Rahul Kumars? 

The Mohun bagan coach believes there are no inevitable conclusions in football and his young hopefuls are capable of delivering a clean kill. 

Having a young side is an advantage in itself. 

The boys will be determined to give a good account of themselves. I have full faith in their abilities, Chima told a joint press conference with his Tampines Rovers counterpart Chitavanich Vorawan. 

In a way, Tuesdays match can be described as a battle between youth and experience. 

While circumstances have forced to make the current Mohun Bagan side resemble an under-23 one, the average age of the reigning Singapore Cup champions is 28. 

Besides, while the season is drawing towards an end here, Rovers nicknamed the Stags begin their season only against Mohun Bagan. 

Vorawan appears unperturbed by the lack of competition. We have had a good pre-season training in Thailand and I hope this will stand us in good stead here, the coach, a Thailand midfielder in the 1982 Asian Games football, pointed out. 

Chima described the visitors as worthy opponents, but at the same time, reminded his wards of the need to sparkle in absence of the stars. At least, Lalawmpuia is paying heed to the urgency.

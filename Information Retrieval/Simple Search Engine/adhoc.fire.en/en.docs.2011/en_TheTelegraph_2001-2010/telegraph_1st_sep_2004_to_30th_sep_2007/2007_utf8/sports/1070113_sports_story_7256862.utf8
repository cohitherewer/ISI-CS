 Cant expect miracle in one day: Yuvraj

Mumbai: Playing a match after more than two-and-a-half months, Yuvraj Singh made 62, but more importantly, fielded for 50 overs in a local match here on Friday. 

The aggressive middle-order batsman was satisfied with his outing but said he did not want to rush things. I was feeling good. You cant expect a miracle in one day. I have to take it game by game. I expect to get back to my best slowly, he said after the match at the Bandra-Kurla Complex. 

I was very happy with the outcome today. It is looking good for me, said the left-hander who played in a game featuring Mumbais under-19 cricketers. 

I trained really hard, knew I will do well. First I made an effort to field 50 overs, (to see) whether I can bat after getting tired. It went off well, said the flamboyant batsman who has not played since October-end last year. 

There is no pain. It takes a couple of matches to get back to 100 per cent match fitness. This was the first game. A couple of more, and I am sure I will get better, he said. (Indian team physio) John Glosters report will go (to the Board). 

Yuvraj said he had discussed a few things he needed and wanted to do in the match with Gloster at the ground before the tie. 

I discussed a few things I needed to do and wanted to do in the game. I am going to be joining the team in the camp, so hopefully we can improve on that.

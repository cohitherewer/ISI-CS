 Lankans targeted

Colombo: The ICL seems set to take Sri Lankan cricket by storm with several top players approached, sources said. 

Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) sources said several players were privately approached by agents during the recent series here with Bangladesh but that the board would not allow any contracted players to join the rebel league. 

Reports here said that the recently retired Russel Arnold has accepted the offer and is negotiating with the ICL. (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Woods teams up with Federer, Henry 

 - I stay up really late to see Tiger play... Sometimes I fall asleep, says French striker 

Dubai: Keeping a beard at bay has never been a problem for Tiger Woods. I cant grow one, Woods said. My friends razz me about it. 

A few hours after finishing third at the Dubai Desert Classic, the American golfer teamed up with 10-time Grand Slam tennis champion Roger Federer and France soccer legend Thierry Henry to announce a deal with Gillette that would put the trio in TV commercials around the world. 

Woods, Federer and Henry each posed for photographers with shaving cream, something Woods doesnt have to use all that often. 

I started (shaving) a little late. My stubble didnt quite grow in, said Woods, his face red and wind-burnt from a sandstorm earlier in the day. My dad showed me how to do it and I tried to do it just like him. I got foam all over the place. 

Gillette executives declined to say how much the athletes will be paid. But Chip Bergh, Gillettes president of global grooming, said each of the trio could afford to buy his own razors. 

Bergh said Gillette selected the trio not just because of their success in sports or marketing prowess, but because each embodies true sporting values and was a good example off the field. 

I just love going out there and competing against the boys, and I try to beat their brains in, Woods said. 

I love the competitive rush. Ive loved it ever since I was a kid. I couldnt live with myself without giving it my all. 

Despite the new endorsement deal, Woods doesnt plan to start his day with a shave. Theres no way Im going to get up early in the morning and shave, Woods said. I always shave at night. 

Federer also has shaving issues. The Swiss champion said he plays it by the ear and shaves when the mood strikes him. Federer said he once grew a beard because he worried that the act of shaving might cost him a title. 

I was a bit superstitious at my first Wimbledon. I had a bit of a beard, he said. 

Woods and Federer have become friends over the past year and developed a tongue-in-cheek rivalry. Both are considered the best in their sport, but its tough to say who is the better player. 

Woods has an advantage: hes won all four golf majors while Federer is still missing the French Open. 

Ive got a few months to prepare. Youve got to believe its possible, said Federer, who then suggested that his feat is tougher to achieve than Woods. 

Of course all four of those are on grass, whereas I have to play some on a hard court, Federer said, laughing. There we go, Woods responded. 

Woods and Federer said they hoped to spend more time with Henry, perhaps when the trio begins shooting. 

Henry, for his part, said he admired the two men but had trouble watching golf. 

I stay up really late to see Tiger play, Henry said. Sometimes I have to be honest I did fall asleep. 

Asked whether he would like to try golf or tennis, henry said he couldnt imagine himself playing such a slow-moving game like golf. He said his mind would start to drift. 

I would be thinking about my house and wondering if everyone is ok, or thinking its too cold, the Arsenal striker said. 

Woods has made no secret that he has only a passing interest in soccer, and that doesnt include playing it. 

All that running and never touching the ball that often is just not for me, woods said. 

But both still had praise for Henry. I think Thierry is the best striker in the world, Federer said.

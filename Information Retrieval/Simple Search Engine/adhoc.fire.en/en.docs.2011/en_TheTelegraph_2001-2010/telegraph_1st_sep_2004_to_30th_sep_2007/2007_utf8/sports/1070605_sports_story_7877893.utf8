 PCB plans bouncy wickets

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has decided to provide challenging surfaces at home by laying as many as 90 bouncy pitches across the country by October this year. 

A PCB official said the project was aimed at preparing batsmen, who have been unable to give their best on bouncy surfaces in places like South Africa and Australia. 

One of the key problems we have identified in our (national) team is our batsmens inability to give their best on bouncy surfaces in places like South Africa, Australia or even England, said PCBs chief operating officer Shafqat Nagmi. 

We should have 90 bouncy pitches in our country by September or October this year, he told a Pakistani daily. 

He said none of the grounds selected was a Test venue and the new wickets would be laid in cities like Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Peshawar, Sheikhupura, Faisalabad and Quetta. 

We are sure that with the help of these new wickets, our batsmen would be better prepared for foreign tours. 

We cannot expect our team to overtake sides like Australia or South Africa unless our players start doing well on foreign tours on a regular basis. 

Nagmi also said the PCB was pondering over a novel idea to keep a check on whether the ground staff at the cricket venues was performing its duties properly. 

I have this plan of installing cameras at our different venues all over the country, he said. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Churchill rally to beat Md. Sp. 

Margao: Churchill Brothers rode strikes from foreign duo Odafa Onyeka Okolie and George Ekeh to notch up a come-from-behind 3-1 win over Mohammedan Sporting in the Round VIII ONGC Cup National Football League (NFL) at the Nehru Stadium on Thursday. 

Subhashish Roy Chowdhury put Biswajit Bhattacharyas side ahead in the 18th minute against the run of play. Jatin Bisht took the flag-kick from the left and found Subhashish unmarked inside the box. The later essayed a half volley that found the roof of the net. 

Churchill, however, stormed back in the second session with Odafa who was later adjudged Man-of-the-Match playing an inspiration role. He first cancelled out Mohammedan Sportings advantage in the 62nd minute and within three minutes, added a second. 

Ekeh capped off Churchills fightback with a solo goal in the 89th minute. 

The second NFL victory for Churchill helped them garner 10 points while Mohammedan Sporting remained on six. 

Bhattacharya who took over after Subhas Bhowmick was sacked was, thus, returning to Calcutta with mixed fortunes. The inspiring show his side had put up in holding Sporting Clube de Goa goalless in the previous match was never in evidence on Thursday. 

Though Raman Vijayan squandered a sitter in the closing stage, Churchill were the deserving winners.

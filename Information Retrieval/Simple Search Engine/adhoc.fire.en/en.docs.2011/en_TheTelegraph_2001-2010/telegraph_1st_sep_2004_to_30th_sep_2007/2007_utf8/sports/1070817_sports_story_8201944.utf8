 Greg Norman starves wife in 50 million divorce

The Australian golfer Greg Norman has been accused by his wife of trying to starve her out of their Florida house by changing the locks and cancelling her credit cards during a bitter divorce. 

The dispute between the multi-millionaire sportsman, known as the Great White Shark, and his wife Laura appeared to have been settled two months ago. 

Under the terms to end their 25-year marriage, Mrs Norman, 57, was to receive a reported $100 million (50 million) from her husband. 

But the settlement has not been finalised and her lawyers say Norman, 52, is trying to delay signing the deal in the hope that she will accept a lesser amount. 

They allege that the winner of two Open Championships, who is now in a relationship with the former American tennis player, Chris Evert, has held money and property hostage to coerce his wife into agreeing to a reduced settlement. 

He has allegedly changed the locks on their 10 million home on Jupiter Island in Florida, and sacked the housekeeper without his wifes consent. He is also accused of barring her credit cards. 

She now has no means of support, according to a statement filed by Mrs Normans lawyers to a Florida court. 

Norman is attempting to starve [her] out so she has no choice but to surrender to his positions, they claim. 

The court motion says: The husbands recent actions represent yet another example of [his] complete disregard for the laws of the state of Florida, the wifes well-being and the basic principles of equity. 

The Florida court was also told that Norman had earned about $400,000 in interest by failing to transfer assets to his wife since agreeing to the divorce deal in June. 

But Norman has struck back, claiming through his lawyers that he has already paid his wife 350,000 to cover her legal expenses. 

 Lets just say that during the course of this case, Mrs Norman has been exceedingly well-funded and that her lifestyle has not been compromised one iota and in no way would Mr Norman cut off his wifes credit cards, said his lawyer, Martin L Haines. 

He dismissed the issue of the locks, saying Mrs Norman had moved into a new house. 

Norman filed for divorce last year. In court he has argued that he has been more than generous to his wife. 

The wife did not teach the husband to swing a golf club, stated a petition filed by his lawyers earlier this year. 

The wife did not teach the husband to win. All of those teachings were the product of diligent hard work by the husband prior to this marriage. 

Norman has also argued that his contributions to raising their two children, Morgan-Leigh, 24, and Gregory, 20, far exceeded the contributions of the wife.

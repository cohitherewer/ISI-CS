 Harbhajan: We require a bit of josh in our performance 

 Harbhajan Singh 

New Delhi: Harbhajan Singh has refuted the theory that the Indian team will have an advantage at the World Cup because they toured the Caribbean islands last year. 

Only when we go there will we know about the conditions. And frankly, I dont believe that we have any special advantage because we werethere last year, Harbhajan said. 

It is not fair to say only we know about the conditions. All teams have played in the West Indies. 

We have to put our heads down, concentrate and work hard. We have a strong batting line-up and good bowlers too. Now we need to bring some josh into our performance. 

The March 13-April 28 showpiece event will, in all probability, be the last World Cup for senior players like Anil Kumble and Sachin Tendulkar. 

Harbhajan, however, said the team should not be distracted from its goal by such sentiments. 

You never know what the future has in store... Look at Brett Lee and Andrew Symonds. 

It is a big tournament and no one should be thinking about himself. Everyone should go out and give his best, a 100 per cent. 

Harbhajan said he and his teammates were full of confidence going into the quadrennial event. 

Definitely the two series wins (against the West Indies and Sri Lanka) have boosted the morale of the team. But the important thing is everyone is in good nick, he said. 

The batsmen have been among runs and the bowlers have wickets under their belt. It is all about confidence. 

Harbhajan said the slow bowlers will play a crucial role but nothing more than what they have done before. 

Spinners have always played an important role, he said. It is important to have variety. A team may go in with four or five seamers if the pitch is green and conditions are totally in favour of the pacers. Even then you can have a spinner, theres no harm. 

Harbhajan acknowledged that the teams fielding was a bit weak when compared to the batting and bowling. 

To overcome that, we will have to plan accordingly and convert those plans into action.

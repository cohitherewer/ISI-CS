 ICC confirms punishment

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The ICC has confirmed it will not be appointing the World Cup final officials for the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa in September. This is according to an ICC release issued on Friday. 

The five-man playing control team during the final in Bridgetown Match Referee Jeff Crowe and umpires Steve Bucknor, Aleem Dar, Rudi Koertzen and Billy Bowden incorrectly ruled that, after a stoppage for bad light, the match would have to be completed the following day even though the minimum 20 overs in the second innings had already been bowled. 

Both sides were keen to avoid that and with the match all but decided in Australias favour, it meant the final three overs of Sri Lankas innings were played in near darkness. 

ICC general manager-cricket Dave Richardson carried out a full investigation which included seeking the interpretation of all five officials. The result is the penalties imposed. 

It would have been easy to let sleeping dogs lie and pretend nothing happened, said ICC CEO Malcolm Speed. But the reality is that the playing control team made a serious and fundamental error that caused the final of our flagship event to end in disarray and confusion.

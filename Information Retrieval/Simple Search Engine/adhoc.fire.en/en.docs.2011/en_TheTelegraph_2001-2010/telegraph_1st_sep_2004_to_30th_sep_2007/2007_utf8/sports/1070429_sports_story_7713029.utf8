The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 SHARP SINGLE 

 Hole in pocket irks fans 

Bridgetown: Fans came in hordes from Australia, the US and England for the World Cup final and no one sounded happy. Englands Barmy Army and Australias Fanatics complained about expensive tickets and accommodation in the Caribbean. Around 3,000 English, Australian and Indian fans are in the island. The cheapest price for a Barmy Army faithful was 3,000 for a two-week stay and 5,000 for a 10-day stay. Australians have shelled out 5,500 Australian dollars for a seven-day trip. 

Watertight security

Bridgetown: The World Cup final saw security beefed up even more. Local forces were boosted with the addition of about 350 military and police personnel from all around the world. These include 70 highly skilled personnel trained in bomb and nuclear material detection. Besides, local parents were even asked to keep an eye on their young ones trying to fly kites within the five-mile no-fly zone around the Kensington Oval. Among the celebrities thronging the little island of Barbados for the occasion were Sri Lanka President Mahindra Rajapakse, Jamaica Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller and St Lucian Prime Minister Sir John Compton.

Party time

Bridgetown: Just-retired former West Indies captain Brian Lara opened his leased property in Barbados for an exclusive party with the cover charge of $250 per head for guests on the eve of the final. The turn-out, by all accounts, was massive.

Fever pitch

Colombo: Sri Lankans performed religious rituals, roamed around on open trucks carrying the national flag, coloured their faces and hung banners as their team took on the mighty Australians in the final. People on streets, in trains and on buses talked little else but cricket. Sri Lanka Cricket exhibited the trophy won by Arjuna Ranatunga and his team in 1996 as the fans thronged to touch and kiss it. 

Flemings wish

Christchurch: Stephen Fleming wants John Bracewell to continue as New Zealand coach after his contract expires next month.

I think Bracewell should stay on I think hes a fine coach, hes worked well with this side, Fleming was quoted as saying in a newspaper. 

Bracewell said a review of the Cup campaign would determine his future. Bracewell has said the priority would be to sort out the players contracts for the forthcoming season. 

Though NZC was non committal on Bracewells future, Justin Vaughan the newly-appointed chief executive was also hopeful that he would continue. He said the off-season would be ideal time for the players to reflect on their performances.

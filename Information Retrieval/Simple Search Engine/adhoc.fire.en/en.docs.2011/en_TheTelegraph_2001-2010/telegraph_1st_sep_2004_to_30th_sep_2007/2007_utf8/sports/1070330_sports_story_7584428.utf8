 Players make a quiet return

The send-off was boisterous, but not the return. At midnight on Wednesday, two of Indias fallen heroes, Virender Sehwag and Mahendra Singh Dhoni returned to the capital and were whisked away through the back gate of the Indira Gandhi International Airport under strict security. 

As word spread that the two cricketers would land in the city from London, mediamen and a handful of fans gathered at the airport. No BCCI official was, however, present. 

The fans were more curious than angry. Most of them had come to the airport to receive their relatives, but wanted to find out what the two cricketers had to say about the disastrous performance in the World Cup. 

They, however, had to return disappointed since neither Sehwag nor Dhoni made a public appearance. Immediately after their arrival, security officials took the two to a special room to complete the immigration formalities. There they sneaked away through the back gate. 

Coach Greg Chappell landed in Mumbai along with Sachin, Ajit Agarkar, Irfan Pathan, Sreesanth and Munaf Patel. 

Dravid and his Bangalore teammates Anil Kumble and Robin Uthappa also reached home early this morning. 

Sreesanth, who arrived in Kochi from Mumbai, said that Indias early exit from the World Cup hurt him the most. 

Not playing in any of the three matches in the league phase did not hurt me, but the teams loss did, Sreesanth said.

New Delhi: After his short and unsuccessful stint with Mohun Bagan, former Nigerian striker Chima Okerie is set to coach Delhi club New Delhi Heroes for the 2007-08 season. 

According to Heroes sources, Chima, who arrived in the capital on Friday, had a meeting with club sponsors Osians and IOS Sports and Leisure and has agreed to coach the club. 

ND Heroes, which has recently been taken over by a corporate house, reportedly has a big budget and the club management hopes to make the team qualify for the Professional League next season. 

Speaking to The Telegraph, a senior club official said: We have contacted some good players from Calcutta, Mumbai and Bangalore. Some of them have agreed to sign for Heroes. 

Among those who have already signed for ND Heroes are Mohammed Nizam, Ahmed Hussain and Harvinder Singh from Mohammedan Sporting, Wajid Ali and Crispin Chhetri from Chirag United and Prashant Jaggi from HASC, Bangalore. 

Apart from recruiting some local footballers, Heroes would also be conducting open trials here on June 6 and 7 under Chima. The former striker would leave for England soon after the trials.

 England owe Fletcher a debt of thanks 

DEREK PRINGLE

Duncan Fletchers most eye-catching achievement as England coach was the 2005 Ashes, but his greatest was to make them a better team abroad. Before he took over, England travelled worse than a punnet of strawberries, until he showed them how to win in places as hostile to tourists as Karachi and Kingston. 

He was fortunate that his first captain was Nasser Hussain, a passionate leader whose fiery character perfectly complemented his calm logic. Together they carved, scraped and occasionally romped to wins in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, the West Indies, Bangladesh and South Africa, most unconquered by England cricket teams for a generation. 

With their emphasis on loyalty, most were receptive to his methods, at least at the start. His unflappable demeanour led to accusations of dourness, but cricket is a game where pressure can build over a matter of hours or seconds, so a poker face has its merits if players are to be kept calm. 

Unfortunately, they occasionally need to be inspired too, as in Tuesdays game against South Africa, and this is where Fletchers measured approach fell down. 

Fletcher began coaching in Cape Town, where he took charge of the university team. A three-year stint at Glamorgan followed, which saw them win the county championship in 1997. Two years later, he was appointed coach of England just after they hit rock bottom in the Test rankings following a home defeat by New Zealand. 

His eye for a batsman was often at odds with the statistical evidence and he championed Marcus Trescothick and Michael Vaughan when their county averages suggested mediocrity. 

But while Fletcher shaped and improved individuals, he was also able, with the help of central contracts, to mould England into the kind of tight unit they had never been when in thrall to the counties. 

Results mattered more than winning popularity contests to Fletcher. They were pretty good, too, at least in Test cricket, where his 42 wins, 24 draws and 30 losses (14 of those to Australia), took England to second in the rankings. 

The stardust was absent in one-day cricket where his record of 75 wins and 82 losses is poor for a country with such a large playing base. Even more telling, and the reason he is leaving, is another World Cup campaign hampered by caution and flawed tactics. That, and the 0-5 Ashes drubbing, were low points no coach could hope to survive. 

He will never admit the error of recent ways or relief at going, at least not publicly. But whether you liked him or not, Fletcher took the job of coaching England with enormous seriousness and pride and turned them into a better Test side. For that alone cricket in this country owes him heartfelt thanks.

 Back Malik, PCB tells seniors

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Friday called upon senior players of the team to provide complete support to the new captain Shoaib Malik. 

In a meeting with the Abu Dhabi-bound squad on Friday, the PCB chairman Naseem Ashraf said he hoped the players had learnt their lessons from the recent World Cup. All you players are professionals and the board expects all of you to behave in a professional way, he said. Ashraf said all players must fully back the new captain. He also urged the senior players to help in grooming the youngsters. 

Malik was preferred over senior players for the captaincy after Younis Khan turned down the offer following the failed World Cup campaign, which saw Inzamam-ul Haq retiring from ODIs. 

Ashraf did not mince words in pointing out that he was not satisfied with the fitness level and fielding skills of the team and said the board will closely monitor these aspects. 

I expect an improvement in the physical fitness of each player on a month to month basis, said the chairman, insisting that fitness will be major element in monitoring the central contracts of the players. 

He said the PCB was planning to bring in a professional baseball coach from the United States to help in improving the fielding skills of the players. 

Meanwhile, opening batsman Imran Farhat has been fined 50 per cent of his match fees. The fine will be imposed for the next match he plays for Pakistan. The southpaw was punished by the PCB for showing dissent with the national selection committee. The left-hander has also been put on a six-month probation. 

After he was omitted from the Pakistan team for the Abu Dhabi one-day series against Sri Lanka, Farhat had called up chief selector Salahuddin Ahmed and demanded to know why he was not picked. (AGENCIES)

 Alonso may go back to Renault

Madrid: Team Renualt are set to bring back their former driver and double world champion Fernando Alonso to the French stable, according to a Spanish sports newspaper. 

The Spanish daily reported on Saturday that Renault principle Flavio Briatore is keen to re-sign Alonso, who currently drives for constructor leaders McLaren, for the 2008 season and for a minimum contract of two years. 

Alonso, who has been outshone by teammate and rookie sensation Lewis Hamilton in the early stages of this season, is at the heart of other speculations, notably a possible move to Italian team Ferrari. 

The 25-year-old Spaniard recently hinted at favouritism within McLaren towards British teammate Hamilton. 

Alonso was crowned Formula One champion with Renault in 2005 and 2006 and is currently second in the drivers standings 14 points behind Hamilton. (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Well improve further: Pereira

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Carlos Roberto Pereira is not reading too much into Mohun Bagans 7-0 thrashing of CPT on Wednesday. Give us more time, we will improve further. We are now playing to only 60 per cent of our potential, the coach said. 

Pereira made it clear that he was still not focusing on the Derby clash on August 17. I am not thinking about the East Bengal match. I am taking one game at a time and concentrating on our next match. 

He did not wish to be drawn into the Edmilson versus Jose Ramirez Barreto debate. Edmilson was good when I brought him to East Bengal. Dont compare him to Barreto. They are players with different styles But I wont wish Edmilson good luck till August 17, said Carlos. 

Barreto was confident about Mohun Bagans chances. I am sure I will triumph in my battle against Edmilson, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The coach will be missed as sorely as the man

Fast Track

It seems as though the whole of Jamaica is in mourning for Bob Woolmer. What makes things worse are the circumstances under which he died. The last week has certainly not been a pleasant one, and on behalf of fellow-Jamaicans, I would like to extend my condolences to the Woolmer family. To think that three days before he died he was lunching at my restaurant When I heard about his death on Sunday morning, I thought it was a joke. 

He had contributed immensely to the development of cricket around the world, and was certainly one of the best coaches around. During my playing days, whenever I interacted with him, I was always impressed by his enormous knowledge of the game and his total dedication to it. Bob Woolmer the coach will be as sorely missed as Bob Woolmer the man. 

On the cricket field, we have had some fairly hectic action in the past week, with India experiencing contrasting fortunes against two minnows. As I said in my last piece, I treat the term minnows with some caution, because in ODIs, the lowliest team can upset the highest ranked side on any given day. 

Bangladesh showed what they can achieve given an opportunity, and Ireland, against whom the West Indies take the field on Saturday, can certainly repeat their achievement against Pakistan if the hosts are not sharp. As they have proved time and again, they can cave in unexpectedly, and Brian Lara will have to lead from the front to ensure that Ireland dont get a foot in the door. 

The other big match left in the group league stage is Australia versus South Africa, the clash of the titans. Both teams are potential semi-finalists, and this could well be a preview to a later, more vital, clash. 

Whatever the outcome of this match, the cricket on offer should be downright thrilling, because from what I know of both these teams, they will fight to the finish to establish supremacy. 

South Africa are now officially the worlds best ODI team, a tag that belonged to Australia even a month or so ago. No matter how vehemently Australia deny that they are not bothered by the loss of the crown, Ricky Ponting will want to prove a point, if I know him. 

As you read this, we will know the outcome of the India versus Sri Lanka game. The Lankans, I feel, are in sufficiently good touch to make the semis at least. The fourth place is still in doubt, though New Zealand appear to be the favourites to fill it. 

At the start of the tournament, teams from the subcontinent were expected to rule the roost, apparently because the pitches would favour their style of play. Well, one team is out already, and another lost to Bangladesh. All of which goes to show the futility of predictions. 

The real World Cup, as far as I am concerned, begins now.

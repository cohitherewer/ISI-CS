 Strong reply by South Africa

Georgetown: A diving run out by Herschelle Gibbs epitomised South Africas clinical bowling and fielding performance in their World Cup Super Eight match against Sri Lanka on Wednesday. 

South Africa were 169 for four after 35 overs. Jacques Kallis (69) and Justin Kemp (2) were at the crease. Graeme Smith fell for 59 while Herschelle Gibbs made 31. Muttiah Muralidharan took three wickets. 

Tillekeratne Dilshan and Russel Arnold, however, scored half-centuries to boost Sri Lanka to a total of 209 all out in the second stage match after they had badly struggled earlier. Fast bowler Charl Langeveldt claimed his career-best return of five for 39. 

Gibbs conjured his moment of magic in the 25th over when he swooped on the ball from backward point and dived into the stumps with Chamara Silva (9) well short of the crease. 

The dismissal was reminiscent of Jonty Rhodes dive in the 1992 World Cup to run out Pakistans Inzamam-ul Haq. Rhodes is now South Africas fielding coach. 

The aggressive Sri Lankan batsmen struggled against South Africas disciplined bowling and Gibbs effort reduced them to 98 for five in the 25th over. 

A sixth-wicket stand of 97 between Dilshan and Arnold salvaged the innings somewhat, but the South Africans will be confident of overhauling the Sri Lankan total. 

Dilshan scored 58 before he slashed a drive off fast bowler Makhaya Ntini to third man, where Justin Kemp took a well-judged catch. 

Arnolds innings of 50 ended when he played an ill judged sweep to Langeveldt and skied a catch to wicketkeeper Mark Boucher. 

The 1996 champions had themselves to blame for losing wickets at regular intervals with injudicious shots. Upul Tharanga (12) was the first man to go. 

Sanath Jayasuriya threatened to break free but, after hitting four boundaries, the left-hander sliced a lofted drive off Langeveldt to Jacques Kallis at deep backward point. 

Captain Mahela Jayawardene (12) was snared by a Langeveldt delivery that was quick and high on to him, took a leading edge and popped into the hands of AB de Villiers at short cover. 

The match was the first to be played at Providence Stadium, where the pitch offered consistent bounce and the outfield was reasonably fast despite recent rain.

 SHARP SINGLES 

Diligent Sachin 

Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar and Ajit Agarkar

 on Wednesday were seen practising for the first time after Team Indias

 World Cup debacle. The duo went through the routine at the Bandra Kurla Complex

 ground of the Mumbai Cricket Association. They refused to interact with the

 Media, though. Both of them, along with Zaheer Khan, have announced their availability

 for Ranji champions Mumbai in the National Twenty20 meet set to start from

 April 15.

Too costly

 London: The Barmy Armys travel company, which organised holidays and tickets for England supporters in Australia and the West Indies this winter, is to be wound up by the end of the World Cup. The firm, based in Hayes, West London, has been unable to fill 600 prepaid hotel rooms and has lost 500,000 through failing to take up places on a cruise ship during the World Cup. According to Suranjan Cooray, who runs the company, 90 people have issued complaints about issues concerning refunds and paying twice for taxis and breakfasts. He put the blame on exaggerated ticket prices for the World Cup.

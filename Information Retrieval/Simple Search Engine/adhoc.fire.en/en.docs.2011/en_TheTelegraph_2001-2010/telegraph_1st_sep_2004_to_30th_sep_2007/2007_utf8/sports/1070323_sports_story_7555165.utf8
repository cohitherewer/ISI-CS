 Dutch bowl out Scots for 136

Basseterre: Billy Stelling took three wickets on Thursday to help The Netherlands restrict Scotland to 136 in their World Cup group A match. 

The Dutch paceman was only included in the team when captain Luuk van Troost stood down, denying himself an international farewell. 

Australia-born finger spinner and No. 10 batsman Glenn Rogers top-scored with 26, with only Neil McCallum (24), Colin Smith (19), John Blain (18 not out) and Ryan Watson (16) getting starts. 

Both teams lost their first two matches to Australia and South Africa, who have both qualified for the Super Eight.

 Responsibility a pleasure: Dhoni

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni in Bangalore on Saturday 

Bangalore: Team Indias newest vice-captain (in ODIs) Mahendra Singh Dhoni is excited about his additional responsibility. 

I have been playing for the last two and a half years. Its always a pleasure to get extra responsibility. It also makes one more responsible, the wicketkeeper batsman told reporters here on Saturday at the end of the teams four-day conditioning camp. 

It will be tough for me as a vice-captain. For me this is a new experience and I am a bit excited. But I will try my best, the swashbuckling batsman said. 

Dhoni said he and Dinesh Karthik, the additional keeper cum batsman on the tours of Ireland and Scotland, compliment each other well. 

We complement each other. As you have seen when I bat in the nets he keeps and vice versa. We share our problems. Its well known that it would be difficult for a wicketkeeper in England owing to the late swing. Having another keeper in the squad would always help, he said. 

Dhoni was confident they would adapt to the conditions quickly when the Indians land in Ireland for the four one-day Internationals. 

The wickets here were green and re-laid on which the fast bowlers could seam the ball. The camp has been beneficial for us. We got some good practice ahead of the tour of Ireland. Two-three days practice sessions there would help us adapt to the conditions. Hopefully we will do it quickly, he said. 

The Indians start the tour with an ODI against Ireland on June 23, followed by a best-of-three ODI series against South Africa (June 26, 29 and July 1) before moving on to Glasgow in Scotland for a one-off ODI against Pakistan on July 3. The proceeds of that match would go to Prince Charless Charitable Trust. 

Dhoni also had a word of praise for the match simulations the squad underwent here and said they were better than the normal net sessions. 

We had good match simulation sessions here. Its not like the nets as you are conscious that if you get out you cant continue batting. The involvement is more and you have to concentrate harder, he explained. (PTI)

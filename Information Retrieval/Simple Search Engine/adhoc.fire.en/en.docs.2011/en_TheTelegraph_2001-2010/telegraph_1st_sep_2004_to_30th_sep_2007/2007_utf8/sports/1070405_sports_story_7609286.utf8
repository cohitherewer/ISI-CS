 It was like an April Fool prank: Anand 

New Delhi: Viswanathan Anand on Wednesday described the Fide initial refusal to elevate him to number one ranking in its latest charts as inexplicable and strange. 

Linares has always made it to the April lists. It is by far one of the most important events in the chess calendar. Not to rate it is very strange. If we have ratings every three months, this is to make the ratings more relevant, he said. 

As to why Fide didnt rate the event I do not have an explanation. But now that it has been rated I do not wish to dwell on it any longer. 

The Indian ace thought that somebody was playing a kind of April Fool prank being played with him. 

I was the last one to know. But I was getting a lot of calls on April 1. Now it being April Fool, I was not sure what to believe. (Then) I saw the hundreds of emails and messages in the forums. It was very special that everyone stood up for me. I cant thank the fans enough. It was truly special. (PTI)

Phuket: Jeev Milkha Singh made a brilliant recovery on his back nine to card an even par 72 in the second round of the $ 2.44m Johnnie Walker Classic golf tournament here on Friday. 

The Indian ace made a double bogey and a triple but came back to be tied 11th at the Blue Canyon Country Club. 

Jeev, the 2006 Asian Order of Merit winner, is now five-under for two days, five shots behind leader Oliver Wilson (66). 

Wilson compiled rounds of 68 and 66 and had two eagles on his back nine on Friday. He also made three birdies, two eagles and a bogey on the closing 18th. 

South African Anton Haig, who equalled Greg Normans long-standing course record with an eight-under-par 64, was a shot back, one ahead of compatriot Retief Goosen (68). 

Goosen was tied third with Australian James Nitties (67). 

The other Indians had mixed luck. Rahil Gangjee added a three-under 69 to his first round 72 and was tied 23rd at three-under. He had five birdies and two bogeys. 

Shiv Kapur and Gaurav Ghei were both tied 32nd at two-under 142. Kapur had six birdies, two bogeys and a double bogey on the par-4 third. 

Ghei was set for a better finish but a bogey-bogey finish spoilt his round. He had four birdies against five bogeys in his 73. Jyoti Randhawa (75) had another miserable outing as he missed the cut at four-over 148. S.S.P. Chowrasia (74) also missed the cut at three-over 147. 

Amandeep Johl (77) had a strange round with an eagle, a birdie, three bogeys, one double and a triple bogey. His round of 10-over 154 was also not good enough to keep him for the weekend. 

Jeev, starting on the 10th, parred the first two holes before getting his first birdie of the day on the 12th. Then came four pars before disaster struck. He dropped five shots in two holes and slipped down the ladder. 

But the tenacious Jeev, who had four wins last year, climbed back into contention with four birdies in his second nine. He birdied the second, third, sixth and eighth for a four-under 32 stretch. 

The Chandigarh golfer hit most of the greens in regulation, but missed a few putts. He took 27 putts as compared to 24 on the first day. 

Thai star Thongchai Jaidee moved into contention with a 68, thanks to an eagle on his last hole, for a 139 total to be tied 11th.

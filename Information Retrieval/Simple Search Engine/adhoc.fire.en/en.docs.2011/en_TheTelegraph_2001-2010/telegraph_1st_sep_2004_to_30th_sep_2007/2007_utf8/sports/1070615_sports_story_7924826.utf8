The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ameya unsure of his future

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Ameya Walavalkar may have notched up his maiden international victory at the JK Tyre Rotax Mojo Asia Challenges go-karting second leg in Kolhapur last weekend, but the Mumbaikars participation in the two following rounds in Surabaya (Indonesia) and Miri (Malaysia) are uncertain. 

I am not sure of competing in the next rounds owing to lack of monetary support, he said.Walavalkar had also missed the first round in Koka Bharu, Malaysia. It wasnt possible for Kolhapur-based driver to manage enough funds for a trip to Malaysia. 

Having upset the Round One winner Ryan Haryanto (Indonesia), the 26-year-old is still in contention for the top two places in the championship. 

Walavalkar, by the way, drives for Kolhapur-based Mohites Racing Academy (MRA) and the participation in the Indian go-karting leg was merely because it was held in India.

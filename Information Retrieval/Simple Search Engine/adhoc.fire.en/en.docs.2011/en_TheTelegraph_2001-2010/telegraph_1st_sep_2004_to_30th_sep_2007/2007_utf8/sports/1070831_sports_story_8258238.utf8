 Jansher to return 

Karachi: Pakistans former world champion Jansher Khan is coming out of retirement to play in a Professional Squash Association tournament in October. The 38-year-old retired in 2002 due to a nagging knee problem. 

Khan said he had been assured a wild card entry by the organisers of the PSA tournament, which is being held in London from October 11.

What is the best way to play the lofted shot after dancing down the crease? 

(Krishnendu Mukherjee, 21, Howrah) 

 Once you go down and realise you are quite close to the pitch of the ball, then go through with the shot. Dont lift your head too early.

 I am a right-hand batsman. I cannot judge the in-swingers and out-swingers by watching movements of the bowlers hands. How can I do so? 

 (Ronak Kagrawa, 15, Calcutta-73) 

 Focus on the ball coming out of the bowlers hands. And dont commit yourself early.

 Being a left-handed hard-hitting batsman, I try to pull the balls and on several occasions misjudge them. How can I play those deliveries? 

 (Mrinmoy Saha, 13, Kasba) 

 Make sure you judge the length of the ball when you attempt a pull or hook. Also use the depth of the crease when you go back and across.

 I am a right-handed batsman. I always get caught at point while trying to cut. Please help. 

 (Vicky Tanti, 19, Assam) 

 Let the weight go into the shot and roll your wrists on top of the ball during impact.

 I am a right-arm medium-pacer. Despite my best efforts I cannot swing the ball. Please help me. 

 (Debarshi Mukherjee, 14, Azadgarh) 

 Work on your grip and wrist position with your coach.

 I am right-handed batsman and often get bowled or adjudged leg-before while trying to hit the ball on the leg side. Why does this happen? 

 (Rajesh Roy, 17, Dum Dum) 

 You are obviously falling over too much and looking to play far to across the line.

 I am a right-arm medium-pacer. Despite my best efforts and coachs tips, I cannot get the seam movement. What should I do? 

 (Subhojit Dutta, 14, Calcutta-61) 

 Again wrist action is important. Also you need a pitch that has some moisture and grass on it.

 I am a right-handed batsman. I play the off-side strokes at ease but face difficulty playing on the on side. Please help me out. 

 (Anurag Kujur, 14, Rourkela) 

 Check with your coach. You might have to make a slight adjustment with your grip.

 I am a left-handed batsman and always face problems playing the square cut. Please help me. 

 (Navojit De, 13, Calcutta-37) 

 Use the depth of the crease when playing the shot. Also you need the width to be able to free your arms.

 In trying to glide the ball past slips, I often get caught. Should I put a stop to the shot?

 (Aveek Roy, 19, Calcutta) 

 Yes, till you really get your eye in and get used to the conditions.

 Laver: Roger probably the best I have seen

Melbourne: If he could pick any player from any era to test himself against, Roger Federer would like a shot at Rod Laver or Bjorn Borg. 

Laver, the last man to win all four majors in one season, was in the stadium that carries his name to witness Federer dismantle Andy Roddick in the Australian Open semi-final. After what he saw, Laver would just as soon stick to meeting Federer in the locker room, after the matches. 

I think Roger is probably the best player Ive ever seen. The way hes compiling the Grand Slam titles, I think hes got a great chance of being the best ever, Laver said. 

Rogers got too many shots, too much talent in one body. Its hardly fair that one person can do all this his backhands, his forehands, volleys, serving, his court position the way he moves around the court, you feel like hes barely touching the ground. Thats the sign of a great champion, Laver said. (AP)

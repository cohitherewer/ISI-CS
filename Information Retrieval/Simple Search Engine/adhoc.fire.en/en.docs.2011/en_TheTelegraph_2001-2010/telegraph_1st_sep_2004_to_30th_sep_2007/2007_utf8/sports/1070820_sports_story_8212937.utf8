London: Manchester Uniteds stuttering start to the defence of the Premier League title became a full-blown slump on Sunday when they were beaten 1-0 by Manchester City. 

The win, courtesy Geovannis 31st minute shot, left Sven-Goran Erikssons City top of the league with a maximum nine points and looking down on their rivals who languish just above the bottom three with two points. 

It is Uniteds worst start to a Premier League season since 1992 when they managed only one point from their opening three matches. It is also the worst start by any defending champions. 

The only good news for United was that all their chief title rivals dropped points. Liverpool and Chelsea drew 1-1 at Anfield, Frank Lampards harshly-awarded penalty cancelling out Fernando Torres first goal for Liverpool, while Arsenal were held to a 1-1 draw at Blackburn Rovers. 

An untidy Manchester derby at Eastlands was settled after 31 minutes by Geovanni, one of the numerous foreign signings made by former England boss Eriksson since taking charge last month. The Brazilian midfielder delivered a low swerving shot that skimmed off the shin of United defender Nemanja Vidic before nestling inside the post. 

Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez described the decision of referee Rob Styles to award Chelsea a penalty as unbelievable after watching his side pegged back. 

Torres showed why Benitez splashed out a club record 36 million euros ($48.42 million) to sign him from Atletico Madrid after 16 minutes when he glided on to a Steven Gerrard pass, outfoxed Tal Ben-Haim and guided a precise shot across Petr Cech. 

Just past the hour Shaun Wright-Phillips cut a ball back behind Malouda and when the Frenchman stumbled into Steve Finnan, Styles awarded a penalty which Lampard slotted home. 

Robin Van Persie gave Arsenal an early lead at Blackburn but Rovers, who ended the game with 10 men after Ryan Nelsen was sent off, got a point when Jens Lehmann fumbled David Dunns 25-metre shot into his net. 

Arsenal, Blackburn and Liverpool all have four points, while Chelsea are second behind Manchester City with seven.

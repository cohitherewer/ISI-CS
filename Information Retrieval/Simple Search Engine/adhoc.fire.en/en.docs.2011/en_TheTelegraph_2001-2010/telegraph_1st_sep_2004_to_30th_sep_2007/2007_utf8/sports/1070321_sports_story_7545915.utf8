 Bob never regretted coaching Pak

IVO TENNANT

 Bob Woolmer 

Not long before his death, Bob Woolmer and I had begun work on a sequel to his autobiography that would take in his coaching of South Africa, the second spell in Warwickshire and Pakistan. It was clear that his respect for Hansie Cronje never wavered in spite of his involvement in match-fixing, that he erred in returning to Edgbaston and that, for all the sniping he received from Javed Miandad, his predecessor as coach, and for all his trying experiences with Shoaib Akhtar and Inzamam-ul Haq and over the ball-tampering rumpus at the Brit Oval last year he never regretted becoming the coach of Pakistan. 

The country, its culture and its religion fascinated him to the extent that he studied the lore of the land during the many quiet moments he had in Lahore when separated from his family in South Africa. 

Woolmer, who died in Jamaica on Sunday, would ask himself from time to time why he had taken the job. 

I had heard a lot about the intolerance of failure when I took on the job, he said. There was much to put me off many stories and rumours of match-fixing and ball-scratching and yet the talent emerging from the country appeared to be endless. Indian and Pakistani cricket, turning pitches, wristy batsmen, reverse swing, held a sort of mystique for me. 

When he and his wife, Gill, invited the team to a barbecue in Cape Town during their tour of South Africa this year, he was taken with the way they insisted on all praying together, on his lawn. No matter that the food was almost overcooked. He did not join in, telling them cricket was his religion. 

While concerned about the all-pervading influence of the madrassas, Woolmer studied the Koran to understand the team that much better. Although he felt that they were too inclined to believe tales of black magic and superstitions, he valued the discipline that religion imposed, that there was no drinking and hence no need for curfews. 

The difficulties he experienced were with three individuals in particular: Miandad, Shoaib and Inzamam. His loyalty towards Cronje when coaching South Africa had not been reciprocated; now, although always supportive of the Pakistan captain in public, Woolmer felt this year that they would become a better team when Inzamam stood down. 

After Pakistans poor results in Australia in 2004-05, the coach and captain were summoned to see President Pervez Musharraf, who convinced him that he needed to improve his own leadership. 

Inzamam did lead from the front after that, but I had to take into consideration his mood swings and a perception that he was too powerful, Woolmer said. 

Of even greater concern was the influence of Miandad, one of Pakistans greatest batsmen, who, apart from having been dismissed as coach, disliked the fact that the Pakistan Cricket Board had employed a foreigner in his place. 

Woolmer immediately arranged a meeting with him upon succeeding him in 2004, but, to his surprise, found that there was a press photographer present. He generously gave me supper and we discussed the team player by player, but I am afraid all I gleaned from this experience was that he was a bitter man who did not think the team could play, Woolmer said. 

His most testing relationship, though, was with Shoaib, which culminated in a spat in front of the TV cameras in Port Elizabeth during Pakistans tour of South Africa in January. Woolmer was well aware that Shoaib was a proven wicket-taker, a potential match-winner and the fastest bowler in the world, but he was not convinced by the players attitude. 

Shoaib, he reckoned, was not adverse to the good life. I doubt if Roger Federer parties every evening during Wimbledon. 

No experience, he knew, would ever be perfect in coaching and coaching Pakistan was not. 

There is much confusion as to how much effect the role has on performance and how much responsibility the coach should have, Woolmer said shortly before his death. But I was encouraged by the structures being put into the grass . It has been more than an interesting job, for every day has held something new.

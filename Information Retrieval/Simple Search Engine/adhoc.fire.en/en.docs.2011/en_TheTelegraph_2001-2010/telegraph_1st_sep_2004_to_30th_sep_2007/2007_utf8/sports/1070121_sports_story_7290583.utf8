The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 EB eye full points against Churchill 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Buoyed by the victory over Mohammedan Sporting, East Bengal will go all out to log full points against Churchill Brothers in their National Football League match at Barasat on Sunday. We have no other options but to win it, coach Carlos Roberto Pereira said after the practice session on Saturday. 

East Bengal are likely to again play in 4-4-2 formation with Ashim Biswas and the Kenyan Boniface M Ambani (the only foreigner in the East Bengal rank at the moment) up front. Though two of the key players Debabrata Roy and Syed Rahim Nabi are down with injuries but they are expected to play against the Goans. 

Pereira, in particular, highlighted the opponents strength in midfield and hinted at giving special attention to it. I havent seen much of them but from whatever I have come to see, their midfield appeared a solid one with two very good foreigners up front, Pereira said. 

Much to Pereiras relief, however, Churchills foreign strikers Okoli Odafa and George Ekeh are on the injury list and unlikely to take field. Howeber, the Kenyan Nicholas Muyoti will play.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Hopefully, I will be a great asset: Henry

Barcelona: Thierry Henry began life as a Barcelona star by vowing to land the Catalan club the silverware which eluded them last season. 

I am really pleased to be here with Barca, Henry told a packed news conference at the Nou . It has been a long chase but Im finally here and happy to be here I cant wait to go out there and show what I can do, Henry told reporters. 

Asked about whether Barcelonas forward line can fit him in alongside close friend Samuel Eto, Ronaldinho and Lionel Messi, the ever modest Henry simply said: Hopefully, I will be a great asset for the team. 

I havent set targets or objectives. It has to be a club target. Barcelona is always a club that wants to win everything. I am going to try my hardest to help as much as I can.

 Fidel Edwards fined

London: Fidel Edwards has been fined 15 per cent of his match fee by the ICC for swearing during the final Test against hosts England. 

When bowling, and in frustration, Fidel swore loudly enough to be heard by spectators at the ground and television audiences, Match Referee Alan Hurst said in a statement on Wednesday. 

We are not saying that players cannot show frustration or demonstrate passion, but Fidels means of doing that was totally unacceptable. 

The player regrets his actions and I trust this penalty will serve to ensure it does not occur again. (Reuters)

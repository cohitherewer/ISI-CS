 When Dravid floored Tamim, Mushfiqur

Bridgetown: The loss to Bangladesh eventually hurt India and put them out of the World Cup prematurely, but that didnt stop captain Rahul Dravid from showering praise on Tamim Iqbal. 

Despite the devastating result in Port of Spain on March 17, Dravid wanted to meet the young opener once he returned to the team hotel. 

Tamim, not knowing what to expect, knocked on Dravids door. To his surprise, he found Dravid waxing eloquent on his brilliant batting. 

Tamim had scored a stirring half-century after his side had been set a target of 192. The 17-year-old left-hander attacked the Indian pacers with gusto and even hoisted Zaheer Khan deep into the second tier of the stands behind midwicket. 

Tamim was not afraid to confront his more distinguished opponents. He even had an exchange of words with Zaheer after the pacer was hit around the park. 

By the time he was out, Bangladesh were well on their way to a memorable victory, which ultimately helped them qualify for the Super Eight stage. 

Tamims batting has taken everyone by surprise. That is the way he bats He is not overawed by the occasion and the reputation of the opposition bowlers matter little to him, Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar had said after the ma- tch. 

That evening, Dravid not only praised Tamim but also presented him with a bat. 

Tamim was overwhelmed, but when the India captain gave him another bat to be given to Mushfiqur Rahim, the Bangladesh player didnt know how to react. 

Mushfiqur, the young wicketkeeper-batsman, had also proved to be a thorn in Indias flesh that afternoon as he scored an important half-century and anchored the innings to safety. 

Promoted to No. 3, Mushfiqur had batted sedately and opened up only towards the end to hasten victory. 

I was overwhelmed For him to do that after Indias chances had taken a beating showed the spirit in which Dravid plays his cricket. We have several admirers of the Indian captain in our dressing room, Mushfiqur said. 

Dravid is known for such nice gestures. A number of Bangladesh players benefited from his insight and advice on the game when India last toured the neighbouring country. 

Pakistans Younis Khan had also acknowledged how Dravids advice turned his career around in 2004. The Pakistan batsman had sought tips from Dravid during the 2004 Champions Trophy. 

I talked with Dravid who gave me some tips about batting and on life. I followed his advice and everything changed the results are there for everyone to see, Younis said later. 

The results were so good for Younis that at one stage, he hit four centuries in as many Tests against India.

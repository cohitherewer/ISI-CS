 Vaughan doesnt want a repeat of the Ashes

Patrick Kidd

 Michael Vaughan 

It has been common for a Test series to begin with Shane Warne boasting of his latest mystery ball. But when Michael Vaughan starts talking about having discovered a new delivery in the nets, something is strange. The balls coming out of the hand quite nicely, he said on Monday. There is no reason why I cant be the best off-spinner in the country. 

And then a broad smile spread across the England batsmans face and he started to chuckle: proof that despite yet another injury setback this time a broken finger on his right hand the England captain is in chipper mood. 

Vaughan will miss the first Test against the West Indies, which starts on Thursday at Lords. It will be the sixteenth Test in a row he has missed with one injury or another, but Vaughan refuses to be downcast. 

Im gutted, yes, but its not the end of the world, he said. Im only missing one match. There are lots of people worse off than me look at those poor parents in Portugal. 

Vaughan hopes to return for the second Test, at Headingley Carnegie, on May 25, but he is determined to be at Lords this week and to remind everyone that while Andrew Strauss is setting the field, Vaughan remains Englands captain. 

Ill be there, he said. It is important Im around to form a relationship with Peter [Moores, the new coach], to get a feel of the new regime and the way he works. Ill have an input on certain issues. 

Vaughans nous was missing during the Ashes series in Australia last winter, which he feels was costly. His disappointment at being out in Australia yet playing no role in the dressing-room is stated with a vehemence that you could not imagine if Duncan Fletcher were still the England coach. 

A lot was spoken about me being involved. I was never involved at all, Vaughan said. They could have used me more as an Ashes-winning captain with a huge amount of knowledge. That could have been a help to Andrew Flintoff [the stand-in captain] so that he could get on with playing. 

It was made clear that I was to be kept away from the team. I understood the reasons, but I thought I could have helped. Thats why this week I want to be around. I want Strauss [the stand-in captain] to get on and make a hundred when he opens the batting. If I can help him to settle, to talk to the young players or the bowlers or whatever, it will be a great help to him.

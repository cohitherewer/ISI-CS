 Jeev at tied 77th

Oakmont: Oakmont bared its fangs and Jeev Milkha Singh ended up carding a five-over 75 to be at tied 77th after Round I of the US Open on Thursday. 

Jeev, however, can take solace from the fact that only two players Dougherty and Argentine Angel Cabrera (69) broke par, while 28 players of the 156-man field did not make a single birdie. 

The Indian at least had a birdie, against six bogeys in his round. The Chandigarh golfer is currently seven shots behind the leader. The cut is applied at 10 shots off the lead. 

I played a good practice round, but even then this course is something that you need to be very precise about. The greens were tough and if you miss the fairways and go to the wrong side, you have had it, he said. 

Putting is the key, and of course you have to hit right. The greens are demanding, sloping and very fast. (PTI)

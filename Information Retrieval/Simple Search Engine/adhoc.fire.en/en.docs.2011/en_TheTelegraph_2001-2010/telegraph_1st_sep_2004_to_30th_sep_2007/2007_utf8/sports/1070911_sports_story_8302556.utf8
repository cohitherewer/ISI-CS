 Bhutia down but not out

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Ludhiana: Bhaichung Bhutia is down but certainly not out. 

After the high of the Nehru Cup triumph in New Delhi and the confines of plush hotels, Bhutia has now found himself at a budget hotel in Ludhiana that has made news for all the wrong reasons. 

Seven Mohun Bagan players had complained of food poisoning after having dinner at the hotel, on the eve of the quarter final against Viva Kerala. And though Bhaichung was not among them, he still found himself confined to bed with viral fever. 

Having missed the clash against Viva Kerala, the India captain is now making an all-out effort to be fit for Tuesdays all-important clash with arch-rivals East Bengal. 

I am not feeling feverish at the moment, but theres still some cough, troubling my throat. Im a bit weak too but trying everything possible to get fit for the East Bengal match, the ace striker said on Monday. 

For Bhutia, its a 50-50 game, but Jose Ramirez Barreto thought otherwise. 

Judging by how they had played against JCT, East Bengal are slightly ahead. 

Our defence has to be a little more organised, said the Brazilian who has fully recovered.

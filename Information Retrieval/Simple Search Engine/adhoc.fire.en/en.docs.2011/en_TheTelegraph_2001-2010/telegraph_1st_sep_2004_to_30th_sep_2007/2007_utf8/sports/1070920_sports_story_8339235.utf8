 Ponting doubtful for India tour

 Ponting is out of the ICC World Twenty20 

Durban: The Australian cricket team Wednesday received a major jolt with captain Ricky Ponting being ruled out for the rest of the ICC World Twenty20 due to injury which also rendered him doubtful for the tour of India. 

In Tuesdays Super Eight match against Pakistan, which Australia lost by six wickets, Ponting suffered a hamstring strain while batting. 

Pontings injury came at a time when the world champions are struggling to make the semi-finals of the ICC World Twenty20 and are meeting Sri Lanka in a crucial Super Eight encounter on Thursday. 

Along with Pakistan, the winners of the match will reach the last four from group F. 

Australias physiotherapist Alex Kontouri said the injury may force Ponting out of action for four weeks, which means he may miss out on the seven-match one-day series against India beginning September 29. 

Over the next three to five days we will have a much better indication of where its leading, so we will know whether he will have to go home or be able to go to India, Kontouri said. 

Hopefully, he will take some part in the series in India. The best case scenario is a couple of weeks. The worst case scenario is four weeks, Kontouri said, adding: he just took off for a run and felt it a bit (on Tuesday). 

The physio said the Aussie skipper might be experiencing such an injury for the first time in his career. 

He was stretching his left leg because he was not sure if there was a problem. I dont think he has had a hamstring strain before. 

He wasnt really sure what it feels like, Kontouri said. 

Ponting, it may be recalled, stayed behind due to private family reasons when the rest of his team left for the ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa. Ponting was one of three players absent from the Australia squads flight from Sydney allrounder Shane Watson had a hamstring injury and paceman Stuart Clarks son was ill. 

CA Chief Executive James Sutherland had said: a private family issue had arisen for the 32-year-old skipper. 

Meanwhile, Cricket Australias national selection panel said Tasmanian fast bowler Ben Hilfenhaus would replace the injured Shaun Tait in the 14-man squad for the upcoming tour of India.

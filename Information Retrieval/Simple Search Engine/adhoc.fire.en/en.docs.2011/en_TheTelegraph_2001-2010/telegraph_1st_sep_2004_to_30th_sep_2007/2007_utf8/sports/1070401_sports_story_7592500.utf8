 Brian Lara counters Roberts criticism

St Johns: West Indies captain Brian Lara had enough problems at the World Cup. He now has to deal with criticism from one of their selectors, former pace bowler Andy Roberts. 

During a Caribbean radio interview after the teams two losses in two days, Roberts blamed the team management for taking lopsided decisions in which he and the rest of the selectors had no power. 

The critical comments from a selector provoked an angry reaction from Lara, whose team is tottering after suffering heavy losses to Australia and New Zealand in Super Eight matches. 

Roberts said captain Lara and coach Bennett King have been the only ones deciding team selection matters since last month, and the selectors were not in the picture. The criticism from Roberts, a member of the West Indies squad that won the first two World Cups in 1975 and 79, appeared to have stunned Lara. 

I dont think it is fair to be critical at this juncture, when the West Indies are facing a crunch situation needing to win all remaining matches, said Lara, reminding Roberts that the captain just went out to lead the squad given to him. 

All I can tell Andy Roberts is that I did not select the World Cup squad... I just go out and try my best with the players given to me, Lara said. 

Everyones got the interest of the West Indies cricket at heart, said Lara, hoping the team would not face any more criticism as it tries to get back into winning form. 

Starting the tournament with a battling victory over Pakistan, the West Indies were among those tipped to make the semi-finals. Now they face an uphill task after heavy defeats against defending champions Australia and New Zealand. 

West Indies had to turn out for three consecutive days as the rain-hit match against Australia spilled over to Wednesday. Then their batting crumbled to 219 all out to lose by 103 runs. (AP)

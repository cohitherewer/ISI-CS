 Bopanna, Qureshi champions

New Delhi: Third seeds Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-ul Haq Qureshi won a hard-fought final to clinch the doubles title at the $25,000 Manchester Challenger on Sunday. 

According to information received here, the Indo-Pak team defeated Jesse Huta Galung of The Netherlands and Michael Ryderstedt of Sweden 4-6, 6-3, 10-5 in the grasscourt event. 

This was Bopannas second Challenger doubles title this year, the previous one coming in Dublin in Adam Feeneys company. For Qureshi, this was his maiden Challenger title. 

Bopannas singles run was cut short after the seventh-seeded Indian was shocked by Harel Levy of Israel in the semis. Qureshi, who was seeded second, lost to the 27-year-old Bopanna in the quarter final. 

Meanwhile, top seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Australian Paul Hanley will open their campaign at the $525,000 Indianapolis Tennis Championships against Americans Andy Roddick and Mardy Fish.

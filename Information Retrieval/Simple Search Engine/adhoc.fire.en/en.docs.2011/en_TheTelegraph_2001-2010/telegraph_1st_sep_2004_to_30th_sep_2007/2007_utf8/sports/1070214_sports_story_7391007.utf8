Calcutta: It was a last-minute lapse that cost India an away win over Myanmar in their Olympic qualifier at Yangon earlier this month. But that was under different conditions. On Wednesday at the Salt Lake Stadium, the Indian boys will seek to exploit the home-advantage factor in their bid to ensure a berth in the next round. 

Without key player Habibur Rehman Mondal, the defence may appear a bit weak but his replacement, young Rakesh Masih of the Tata Football Academy, will leave no stone unturned to make a mark. 

The weather being as it was throughout Tuesday, conditions are unlikely to be perfect for the 2.15 pm match. Both teams will have to mentally prepare themselves for slushy underfoot conditions, more so the visitors. 

The Calcutta Book Fair, just outside the stadium, has added a new dimension to this soccer clash. After days of uncertainty, this game got the go-ahead with the two events to go on simultaneously. 

Not too many people would otherwise be interested in an India versus Myanmar clash, but in case the rain stays away, some from the Book Fair crowd could walk a few yards more to watch the football. 

Captain Nanjangud Shivananju Manju of Mahindra United sounded practical. We are neither overestimating nor underestimating our opponents However, he did mention that India hold a slight advantage going into the match, having scored an away goal last week. 

But we are not going for a draw were playing for a win, the 21-year-old from Bangalore told The Telegraph. Rueing Habiburs absence, Manju said it will be a good opportunity for Masih. 

India are likely to stick to their Yangon formation (4-4-2), but the emphasis will be on attack. Attack is the best form of defence, is what the captain has conveyed to his fellow players at the team meeting. 

On Wednesday, both teams had a light practice session which was marred by unseasonal showers. 

The visitors dont have any injury problem and are likely to start with the Yangon XI. 

For the record, India and Myanmar have won seven matches each of the the 17 times they have faced each other.

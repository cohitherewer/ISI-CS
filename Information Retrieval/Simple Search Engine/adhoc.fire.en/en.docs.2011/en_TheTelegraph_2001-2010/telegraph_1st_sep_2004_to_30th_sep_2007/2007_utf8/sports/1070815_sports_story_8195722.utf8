 Kallis quits as vice-captain

 - Allrounder threatens to walk out of national team 

 Jacques Kallis 

Durban: Fuming at his omission from the squad for the upcoming ICC World Twenty20, South Africa allrounder Jacques Kallis has resigned as vice-captain and threatened to make himself unavailable for the national team in future. 

The move sparked immediate reaction from Cricket South Africa (CSA), which expressed its disappointment and asked Kallis to rethink his decision. 

Kallis phoned me yesterday (Monday) to say he was resigning as the vice-captain of South Africa because of his disappointment over not being included in the squad for the Twenty20 world meet. 

I said we all understood his disappointment and appealed to him not to take a hasty decision. I asked him to meet us so that we may deal with all the prickly issues, CSA CEO Gerard Majola said on Tuesday. 

It is most disappointing, therefore, that Jacques took a unilateral decision after speaking to me and announced his resignation as vice-captain, he said. 

Majola said Kallis had been apprised of the reasons for his omission. 

The reasons for his omission from the squad were fully explained to him as well as the prominent role he will play in a very full and varied season after the tournament. 

CSA hopes that Jacques will reconsider his decision. We believe that he has much to offer as vice-captain and that he has been a stalwart for South African cricket for more than a decade, said Majola. 

Convenor of the selection committee, Joubert Strydom, said South Africa were not the only country to rest top players for the Twenty20 meet. 

We need him to be fit and rested. That was the only reason we didnt select him. We are not the only country to leave out senior players. 

Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly are not in the Indian squad Stephen Fleming has not been included in the New Zealand squad, said Strydom. 

Jacquess ability with bat and ball is essential to us. He is such an allround contributor. I am trying to get hold of him so that we can discuss this further, said Strydom. 

However, former national cricket selector Hugh Page said he understood Kalliss anger and warned that other players could also decide to leave South Africa. 

I think it would be a huge tragedy if Jacques turned his back on South Africa, but I understand how he feels and I wouldnt blame him if he did, said Page. 

He said it was high time that cricket administrators did away with the policy of having a certain number of coloured players in the national side. 

Guys such as Neil Mckenzie or Boeta Dippenaar have given great service to the game, and have been kicked in the teeth, he said.

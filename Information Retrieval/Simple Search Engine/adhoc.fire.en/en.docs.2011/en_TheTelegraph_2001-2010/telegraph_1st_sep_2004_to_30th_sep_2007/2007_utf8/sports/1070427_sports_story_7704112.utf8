 Malik: A dual responsibility

 Shoaib Malik 

Karachi: Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik said he accepted the national team captaincy as a big challenge and wants to successfully avail the opportunity of doing well for his country. 

It is not everyday that you get a chance to lead your country at such a young age. It is a big challenge I want to make the most of this opportunity and do well, he said. 

The 25-year-old allrounder said: As a captain you not only have to be a good leader but also excel as an individual performer. It is a dual role and one I am looking forward to the challenge, he said. 

Maliks first assignment would be a three-match one-day series against Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi next month. 

The national selection committee has invited around 39 players for a week-long training camp which will start in Lahore from Saturday. 

Malik said 13 of the invited players had undergone a complete physical test on Thursday and the others would also have to pass through a similar process as the new selectors were laying a lot of stress on fitness. 

Speaking on the Sri Lanka-Australia World Cup final on Saturday, Malik said the Lankans have the capability to upset the Aussies. 

Malik, who has played in 18 Tests and 137 ODIs, said: Australia are obviously the favourites... But if Sri Lanka bat first and post say around 250 runs then they have a good chance with the variety in their bowling attack.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A rare win, says Deep

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bengal captain Deep Dasgupta termed their triumph over hosts Hyderabad as a rare win. 

Minutes after steering his team to a four-wicket victory, Deep told The Telegraph from Hyderabad: Its amazing because rarely does one get to see such a win At least, Ive never come across such a situation before. Apart from Rana (Randeb Bose, who took 10 wickets), credit goes to all the players It was a team effort. Other bowlers kept up the pressure from the other end, which helped Rana. Even Sourashish (Lahiri) did a good job with the bat. 

Bengal are almost assured of their semi-final berth. However, Deep chose to play it down. Our immediate goal is to do well against Rajasthan (at Eden, from January 10).

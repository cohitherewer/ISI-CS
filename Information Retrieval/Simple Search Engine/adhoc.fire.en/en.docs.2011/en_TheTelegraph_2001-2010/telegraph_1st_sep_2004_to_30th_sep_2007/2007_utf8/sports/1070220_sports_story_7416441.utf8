 coundown to Crickets biggest show

 1975

With 21 days remaining for the first match in the 2007 World Cup, the countdown has begun in earnest. Before we look ahead, a good starting point will be to look back specifically to the editions over the years. Today, we go as far back as 1975, when it all began in England: 

When the first World Cup (officially the Prudential Cup) got underway in the summer of 1975, the shorter version of cricket was just 18 one-day Internationals old. Four teams India versus England at Lords and Australia versus Pakistan at Headingley had the honour of competing on the opening day, June 7. 

What Lords witnessed that day cant even be imagined in this age of limited overs cricket. Responding to Englands 334 for four in 60 overs which turned out to be the highest in that tournament India crawled to 132 for three, with Sunil Gavaskar batting through the innings to remain unbeaten on a pathetically slow 36. England went into the record books with a 202-run victory. 

For Gavaskar, the target was unobtainable. 

Grouped with England, New Zealand and East Africa (made up of club cricketers from Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia), India were to play the other three teams once each in the round-robin stage. The other group featured the West Indies, Australia, Pakistan and newcomers Sri Lanka (who hadnt attained Test status at that time). 

India notched up a 10-wicket win against minnows East Africa, before the Srinivas Venkatraghavan-led team ended its campaign with a four-wicket loss to New Zealand in a last-over thriller. 

The first World Cup brought the curtains down on West Indian Rohan Kanhais career. The right-hander bowed out in style, making 55 in a 149-run stand with Clive Lloyd in the final. 

Javed Miandad, on his international debut at the age of 18, had Lloyd caught-behind at Edgbaston. New Zealand captain Glenn Turner went into the record books as the only batsman with two centuries in the tournament. 

The West Indies had a hiccup against Pakistan in which they scraped through by one wicket. In the other round robin matches, they thrashed Sri Lanka by nine wickets and beat Australia by seven wickets. New Zealand were no match in the semi-final, the West Indians winning by five wickets with 19.5 overs to spare. 

The captain led from the front in the final at Lords. Lloyds 85-ball 102 helped the West Indies notch up 291 for eight. 

Ian Chappell tried to do a Lloyd, hitting 62, but didnt get enough support as the Aussies were done in by some terrific fielding. The West Indians effected five run-outs with Viv Richards alone accounting for three batsmen. Chappells team slumped to 233 for nine before a courageous partnership between Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson took them close to an unlikely victory. It required an under-arm throw by wicketkeeper Deryck Murray to run Thomson out, with the scoreboard reading 274 and the clock showing 8.41 pm. The ecstatic West Indies fans ran on to the field. 

The edge-of-the-seat thriller brought an end to a fortnight of exciting cricket and showed that the World Cup was here to stay.

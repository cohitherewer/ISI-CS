 Flintoff out of Lanka ODIs

Calcutta: Andrew Flintoffs lingering ankle injury has ruled him out of Englands one-day series in Sri Lanka, the ECB said on Thursday. 

Flintoff, 29, struggled through the end of the summers ODI series against India and Englands five matches in the ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa, often wincing in pain when he was bowling. 

Following the recent NatWest series in England, Andrew experienced a reaction in his left ankle but subsequent scans determined no new injury had been sustained. After consultations with specialists it was felt that the ICC World Twenty20 tournament would provide a safe platform to assess how Andrews ankle would respond to bowling in match conditions, without the risk of further damage to the ankle, an ECB statement said. 

Andrew has experienced some discomfort as the World Twenty20 tournament progressed, but was determined to contribute to the teams performance. 

At no time was further damage to the ankle sustained, but unfortunately it was clear that his ability to increase the intensity of his rehab and participation could not be progressed. 

Accordingly, after ongoing review and discussion with specialists, it is felt that the appropriate course of action is to allow time for the ankle joint to settle and recover before the process of further strengthening and assessment of the ankle is intensified. 

Therefore, Andrew will return to the UK for further specialist investigation and rehabilitation, the statement added. 

The Lancashire allrounders left ankle was operated on for the third time this summer. His place in the squad for the five-match series in Sri Lanka will be taken by Chris Tremlett. 

England will make a decision on Flintoffs availability for the Test series in Sri Lanka.

 Chelsea stay on Uniteds heels

London: Two spectacular goals from England winger Shaun Wright-Phillips kept Chelsea firmly on Manchester Uniteds heels after a 4-1 win over West Ham United at Upton Park on Wednesday. Victory lifted Jose Mourinhos side, winners of the last two Premier League titles, back to within three points of leaders Manchester United with five matches remaining. 

Wright-Phillips struck twice in a hectic five-minute spell in the first half during which Argentine Carlos Tevez also netted for the home side. Goals after the break from Salomon Kalou and compatriot Didier Drogba confirmed the vast gulf in class between the sides. 

United have 81 points with Chelsea, who welcome the leaders to Stamford Bridge on May 9, on 78. Wright-Phillips finally opened his league account for Chelsea with two quality finishes. 

His opener on 31 minutes came after a deft shrug of his shoulder took him into the penalty area before unleashing a low left-foot shot which arrowed across goal and into the right-hand corner. 

West Ham quickly levelled when Tevez let fly from 25 metres out with a swerving shot that Petr Cech could only help into the net but their joy was shortlived as a minute later Wright-Phillips met Wayne Bridges cross with a crisp right-foot volley that flew in. 

Chelsea took control after the break. Kalou prodded home from virtually on the line on 52 minutes after Robert Green had parried from Didier Drogba and his fellow Ivorian added a fourth just after the hour. 

Elsewhere, England midfielder Steven Gerrard scored twice, including one penalty, as Liverpool regained third place from Arsenal with a 2-0 win over Middlesbrough at Anfield while Blackburn Rovers overcame Watford 3-1 at Ewood Park to move the bottom side closer to the drop.

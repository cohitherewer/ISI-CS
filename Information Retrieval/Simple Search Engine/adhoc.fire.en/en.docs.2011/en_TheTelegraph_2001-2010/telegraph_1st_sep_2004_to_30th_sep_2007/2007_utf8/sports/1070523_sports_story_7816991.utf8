Calcutta: A spirited Mohun Bagan defeated Pahang FA of Malaysia 2-0 at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday evening, but it wasnt enough to fetch the green-and-maroons a berth in the AFC Cup quarter finals. 

Mahindra United pipped Mohun Bagan to the last eight after overcoming New Radiant 2-0 in the Maldives. The Mumbai outfit emerged as one of the two best runner-up teams. Mohun Bagan would have earned that slot if Mahindra had drawn in the Maldives. 

Mohun Bagan ended with 11 points from six matches in group F, while Mahindra United tallied 12 in group E. 

Both teams played with 10 men for the last 10 minutes after Tajikistan referee Dilovar Orzuev sent off Mohun Bagan defender Fabio Vidal and Pahang striker Rashid Mamud for kicking each other. 

Lalkamal Bhowmick drew first blood in the 12th minute. The medio showed fine opportunism to follow a Lalwampuia cross from left which Jose Ramirez Barreto failed to tap in and push it home with his right foot. Man-of-the-Match Lalawmpuia scored the second goal in the 69th minute. 

 Teams 

Mohun Bagan: Subrata Paul, Fabio Vidal, Deepak Mandal, Ravanan Dharamraj, Jose Ramirez Barreto Dulal Biswas, Lalkamal Bhowmick, Pachuau Lalawmpuia, Rahul Kumar (Dipendu Biswas 61), Suman Dutta, Santos Douglas. 

Pahang FA (Malaysia): M. Iqbal, Jalalludin Abu Jafar, Shahril F. Ahmad, Rashid Mamud, Saravanan Vellu (A Kamaluddin 62), Juzaili M. Samion ((M Kamal R Md. Ali 45), Khairyl M. Mamat, Ahmad Abdul Wahid, M. Khairi Zaharuddin, Rosdi Talib, Syed F Mahmud. 

Referee: Dilovar Orzuev (Tajikistan)

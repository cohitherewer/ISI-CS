 One cant be intense all the time: Uthappa

New Delhi: Robin Uthappa feels he has matured as a player and has turned smart enough to come to terms with difficult situations. 

I have the ability to adjust quickly to pitches and bowlers I have never faced before. Its been the case with me whether I have toured Australia or England, the 21-year-old said on Monday. 

Among the areas he has grown, Uthappa mentioned his technique to switch on-and-off while batting to keep his concentration going. 

I am usually a very intense person, but I have realised you cant be intense all the time. So its better I switch on-and-off which refreshes me and keeps my concentration going. 

The last few weeks have been a whirlwind one for him as he talked of his experience of interacting with seniors such as Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid. 

They all have been encouraging. Sachin told me to look to time the ball rather than hit all the time; Sourav is very experienced and keeps telling me little things about batting while at the other end, he said. 

He converses with God while at the crease, and if Uthappas recent form is any indication, his prayers are being answered. 

You can catch me mumbling between deliveries I converse with God when I am at the crease, the Karnataka batsman said, describing himself as a spiritual person. 

Uthappa, who forced his way into Indias World Cup squad with some blazing knocks, said although he was a naturally aggressive batsman, certain situations have taught him to be patient and selective in his shots. 

There are moments when you feel you can do anything and get away with it. At times, you have to be smart, he said. 

Uthappa, who went off the radar after just three one-dayers last year, said he used the time to practice for longer duration. 

I used the period to improve my game. I realised I needed to bat for longer period and started setting goals for myself. Essentially, I looked to bat 50 overs, said the Bangalore-based batsman. (PTI)

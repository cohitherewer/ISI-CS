 ICL in November now, says Kapil

New Delhi: Teething problems have forced the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL) series to be postponed until mid-November. 

ICL executive board chairman Kapil Dev said the tournament, originally scheduled for October, has been moved to November as cricketers would be free from international duty by that time. 

We all sat together and felt mid-November is the right date, because at that time international cricketers should also be free to play, Kapil told a TV channel in an interview. 

I can give you specifically November 17 is the target date but still let us wait till it is officially announced, he added. (PTI)

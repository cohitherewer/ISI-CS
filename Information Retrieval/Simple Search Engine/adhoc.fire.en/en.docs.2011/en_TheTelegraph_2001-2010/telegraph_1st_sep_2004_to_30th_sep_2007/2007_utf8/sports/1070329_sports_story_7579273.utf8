 CAB keen on tie vs Aussies

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Scrapping the idea of hosting an international tournament as part of its platinum jubilee celebrations, the CAB will request the BCCI to allocate the one-off Twenty20 match that Australia will play during their tour of India in November. This was decided at the working committee meeting on Wednesday. 

The local format will also see changes this season the three-day A.N. Ghosh Trophy will now be a one-day affair while the P. Sen Invitation meet will be a Twenty20 meet. 

The CAB will also sign a 3-year deal with Paras Mhambrey and will build an academy at Rajarhat.

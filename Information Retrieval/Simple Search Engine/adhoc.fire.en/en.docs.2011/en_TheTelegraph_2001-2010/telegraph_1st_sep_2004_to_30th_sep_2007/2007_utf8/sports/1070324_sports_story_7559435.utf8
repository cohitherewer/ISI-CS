 Cash incentive from ICC

Port of Spain: Champions Australia and South Africa will also be playing for a large cash incentive when they meet in their World Cup group D showdown in St Kitts on Saturday. 

South Africa, the top ranked one-day team and Australia the side they knocked off the perch last month will be eyeing the $175,000 which would be awarded to the No.1 team on April 1, an International Cricket Council (ICC) statement said on Thursday. 

The second-ranked team on that date will receive $75,000.

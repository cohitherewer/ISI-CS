The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Im not under more pressure 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni

Calcutta: Coach Greg Chappell believes his improvement, over the past year in particular, has been phenomenal (one of the most improved anywhere). 

Former captain Sourav Ganguly feels hes the difference between the team he led in 2003 and the one picked for this World Cup. 

Were talking of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who is on the fast track to becoming an icon. 

Its a boost that Chappell and Sourav have such a high opinion Its not putting me under more pressure though, the down-to-earth Dhoni told The Telegraph. 

Incidentally, hes beginning the World Cup as the No. 2-ranked batsman (behind Australias Michael Hussey) in ODIs. 

Its nice, but nothing more as Im not driven by rankings More than rankings and awards, whats important is consistency, Dhoni said. 

For a while, of course, hed been the No. 1 last year. The pinnacle was reached within 16 months of his debut, in Bangladesh. 

Dhoni didnt have a great tour of the West Indies in the summer of 2006, but hopes to put to good use the lessons learnt on that visit. 

That trip was part of my education Obviously, Im looking to do better Looking to make a bigger contribution 

Contribution is a key word for Dhoni and nothing matters more than helping Team India make a big splash. 

DHONIs CUP GOALS 

(besides the obvious one) 

 Staying fit 

 Achieving a strike-rate of at least 100 

 Making the most of opportunities 

 Enhancing his team man-reputation 

 Enjoying the tournament...

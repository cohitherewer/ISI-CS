 Randhawa slips to 3rd place

 Randhawa at the Singapore Masters on Saturday 

Singapore: Jyoti Randhawa stayed in title-contention despite carding a par 72 in the third round of the Singapore Masters golf on Saturday. 

The 34-year-old had two bogeys on the back-nine to lose his one-stroke overnight lead to be in sole third position with an 11-under aggregate at the Laguna National Golf Club. 

Chinas Liang Weng-Chong and Englands Gary Lockerbie shared the top spot, one stroke ahead of the Indian. 

Liang carded a 68 and Lockerbie a 69 to be at 12-under 204. 

Randhawa was upbeat about his chances on Sunday. 

Like I said the other day, I am not playing all that great, but I am managing to keep myself together and that is sort of what I did (today), the winner of 2000 Singapore Open said. 

Among the other Indians, Asia No. 1 Jeev Milkha Singh improved to tied 32nd with a two-under 70, but Gaurav Ghei and Rahil Gangjee slipped to tied 58th and 67th, respectively, with five-over 77s.

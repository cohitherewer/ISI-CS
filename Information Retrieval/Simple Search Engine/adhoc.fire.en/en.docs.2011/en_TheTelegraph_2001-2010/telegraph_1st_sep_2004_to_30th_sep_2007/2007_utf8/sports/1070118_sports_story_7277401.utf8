 Capello may lift bar on Beckham 

Madrid: Real Madrid coach Fabio Capello has hinted that he could change his mind about his decision to leave David Beckham on the sidelines for the rest of the season. 

You cant discard anything, was the Italians response to a question during a news conference on Wednesday asking if he planned to continue with his policy regarding the former England captain. 

At the moment this is the line we have decided to follow but you have to be flexible. He is a great professional and always shows enthusiasm in training. Ideas can be changed, but it will depend on both the player and the coach. 

Capello said last week Beckham would not play for Real again after the midfielder announced he had decided to leave the club and join MLS side Los Angeles Galaxy at the end of the season. 

AC Milan, meanwhile, have confirmed they are interested in signing Ronaldo, the clubs vice-president said on Wednesday.

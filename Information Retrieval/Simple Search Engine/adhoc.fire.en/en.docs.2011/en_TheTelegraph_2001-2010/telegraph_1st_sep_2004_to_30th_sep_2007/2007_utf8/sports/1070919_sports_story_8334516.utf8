 Sri Lanka rout Bangla 

Johannesburg: Sri Lanka beat Bangladesh by 64 runs in the ICC World Twenty20 Super Eight match in Johannesburg on Tuesday. 

Bangladesh limited Sri Lanka to 147 for five. But Sri Lanka bowled them out for a paltry 83 runs. 

For Sri Lanka, Chaminda Vaas, Sanath Jayasuriya and Dilhara Fernando took two wickets each. Jayasuriya had the best figures of two for four from his 1.5 overs. 

Sri Lanka, sent in to bat, struggled to score at more than a run-a-ball and lost regular wickets throughout. 

Sanath Jayasuriya, the leading run-scorer in the tournament, went for a duck after cutting his first delivery from paceman Mashrafe Mortaza to deep point. 

Seamer Syed Rasel bowled a brilliant opening spell, conceding nine runs in three overs and dismissing Upul Tharanga for 23. 

Kumar Sangakkara was clean bowled by off-spinner Mohammed Mahmudullah for 20 and Mahela Jayawardene bowled by left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak for 30. 

Jehan Mubarak stroked 31 not out off 19 balls in the closing overs to boost Sri Lankas total. 

Mahmudullah was the best of the bowlers, conceding 19 runs in four overs.

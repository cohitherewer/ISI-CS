 Stuttgart win Bundesliga

Berlin: VfB Stuttgart won the Bundesliga title on the final day of the season on Saturday when a 2-1 win over Energie Cottbus kept them two points ahead of runners-up Schalke 04. 

Stuttgart were trailing 0-1 to Cottbus after Sergiu Radus deflected shot beat Timo Hildebrand in the 19th minute, but goals from Thomas Hitzlsperger (27) and Sami Khedira (43) took them to their first Bundesliga title in 15 years. 

Stuttgart won their final eight matches to erase a seven-point deficit, moving up from third to overtake Werder Bremen and Schalke in a stunning finish. It was their fifth championship and third since the Bundesliga was founded in 1963. 

Stuttgart now stand on the brink of a domestic double, with the Cup final to come against Nuremberg on May 26.

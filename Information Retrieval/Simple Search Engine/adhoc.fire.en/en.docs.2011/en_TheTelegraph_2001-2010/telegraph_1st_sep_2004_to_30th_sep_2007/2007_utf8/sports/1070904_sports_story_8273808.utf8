 Heskey back with Owen push

 Emile Heskey 

Emile Heskey was brought back from the international cold on Sunday after Englands head coach, Steve McClaren, was told by Michael Owen that he wanted to partner the Wigan Athletic striker in next Saturdays Euro 2008 qualifier against Israel at Wembley. 

Heskey, oft-derided for underachieving internationally, has not represented England since Euro 2004, yet the 29-year-old is expected to start against Israel, winning his 44th cap. Heskey represents a gamble by McClaren, but a worthwhile one if he brings the best out of Owen. 

McClaren was at St James Park on Saturday to watch Heskey as well as Owen, the Newcastle United striker, and spoke to Owen about the England situation afterwards. Owen is understood to have enthused about Heskey. In the 12 internationals they have started in tandem, Owen has struck 11 times (contrasting with six in 17 alongside Wayne Rooney). 

McClaren will need to plead with England fans not to boo Heskey, whose name is still sung derisively at Wembley. When England fans sought to taunt Germany last month, they chose a famous scoreline from Munich with the dismissive rider: 5-1 even Heskey scored. 

Owens involvement in Heskeys controversial return will also prompt questions about McClaren bowing to player power, although Englands head coach can respond that it makes sense to listen to his established players. Englands other strikers, like Alan Smith and Andrew Johnson, may take Heskeys summons as a personal snub. Heskey effectively replaces Frank Lampard as McClaren switches from his intended 4-1-4-1 formation to 4-4-2. With Heskey alongside Owen, Englands strike-force should not be short of support from a midfield three of Shaun Wright-Phillips, Steven Gerrard (who aims to be fit) and Joe Cole while Owen Hargreaves anchors. 

Lampard believes he has a chance of making the September 12 game with Russia although Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho last night doubted that. 

The loss of Frank has just changed my thoughts a bit, so we are looking at what partnership and system will get the best out of Owen, said McClaren, who noted how Owen had been partnered by Mark Viduka and another big guy, Shola Ameobi, at Newcastle on Saturday. 

Emile is a player with a lot of international experience and has played many times with Owen in the past. He has been in good form for Wigan this season. He played very well against Sunderland recently and I saw him play well against Newcastle yesterday. He deserves to be recalled. 

Heskeys club form was Sunday hailed as colossal by Chris Hutchings, the Wigan manager. Heskey himself observed: Its a huge honour to be called up and I have to admit it comes as a bit of a surprise to me. I never shut the door on England and always believed I could get another chance. 

McClaren is likely to promote Owens club-mate, Steven Taylor, from the under-21s to replace Sol Campbell, who has withdrawn with a hamstring problem.

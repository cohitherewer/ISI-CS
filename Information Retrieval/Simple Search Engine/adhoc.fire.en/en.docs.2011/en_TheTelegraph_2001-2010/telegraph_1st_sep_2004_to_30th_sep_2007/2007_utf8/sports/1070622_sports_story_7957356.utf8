 Illyas banned from Gaddafi

Karachi: Former Test batsman Mohammed Illyas has been banned from the Gaddafi in Lahore for threatening the national selectors, PCB chief executive Shafqat Nagmi said. 

Illyas was banned after a row over the selection of the squad for a one-day series against Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi in April, Nagmi said. 

The ban can be lifted if Illyas approaches us and apologises for the incident, he added. 

Another PCB official, who did not want to be named, said Illyas had threatened to start a war with the selectors after the omission of his son-in-law, Pakistan opener Imran Farhat, from the squad. 

Farhat was also fined and reprimanded in April by the board for approaching the selectors and demanding an explanation for being left out of the squad. 

Illyas said he had been unaware of the ban until he heard about it from a third party.

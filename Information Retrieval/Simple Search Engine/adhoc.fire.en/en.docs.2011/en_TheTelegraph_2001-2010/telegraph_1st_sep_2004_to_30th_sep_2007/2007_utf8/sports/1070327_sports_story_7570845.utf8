 Marshall called up as Vincent is out with broken wrist

St Johns (Antigua): Hamish Marshall has been called up as a replacement for New Zealand opener Lou Vincent who has been ruled out of the rest of the World Cup. Vincent broke his wrist on Sunday morning. 

Even as the switch needs to be approved by the International Cricket Council (ICC), Marshall is expected to fly out of New Zealand immediately. 

As reported in Mondays Late City edition, Vincent will take no further part in the World Cup after breaking his left wrist during practice in Antigua Sunday morning. 

Vincent was hit by a Shane Bond delivery while batting. He was immediately taken to hospital where an X-ray revealed a clean break, a team statement said. 

He knew straight away he was gone, New Zealand manager Lindsay Crocker said in a telephone interview. 

It was a light session, the bowlers were only ambling in at medium pace really, not any nasty pace, and it was a misjudgement, more than anything. 

Vincent started the World Cup with two ducks but came back to form with 101 against Canada on Thursday. 

He has also been sharp in the field, with three run outs from direct hits. 

New Zealand, who won three group C games out of three to reach the Super Eight, have suffered several injuries to their squad. 

Fast bowler Daryl Tuffey has been ruled out of the tournament with a right bicep problem and has been replaced by Chris Martin. 

Batsman Ross Taylor strained a hamstring and paceman Mark Gillespie will train fully for the first time on Monday after recovering from a shoulder problem which has limited his throwing ability. 

Two others players, allrounder Jacob Oram and batsman Peter Fulton, had broken fingers and batsman Craig McMillan suffered a badly bruised toe after Bond, again, hit him with a late-swinging yorker in the nets. 

The Black Caps first Super Eight match is against the West Indies in Antigua on Thursday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We have work to do: Pereira 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Carlos Roberto Pereira had a close call on Wednesday. After a less than memorable India debut with East Bengal, his opening match as Mohun Bagan coach could have ended in defeat, had James Singh not found the equaliser 12 minutes from time. 

Lady Luck wasnt with his side, the woodwork depriving Jose Ramirez Barreto twice. But Pereira didnt mention that as an excuse to log maximum points. We didnt play well, thats why we couldnt win, said the Brazilian. We planned to score early but it didnt happen. 

Pereira was not critical of any individual, but said there were some problems to be sorted out. The players tried their best, but some of them didnt play like they are capable of We also have to work on our combination. 

Barretos performance evoked mixed response from his countryman. He made some good passes, but hes not fully fit yet, said Pereira.

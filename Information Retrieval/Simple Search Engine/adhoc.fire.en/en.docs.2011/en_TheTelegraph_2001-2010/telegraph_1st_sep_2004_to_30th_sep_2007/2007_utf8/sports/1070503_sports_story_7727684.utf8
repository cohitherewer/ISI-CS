 No conclusion yet, says British lab

London: A British forensic laboratory is analysing toxicology tests conducted on the body of slain Pakistan cricket coach Bob Woolmer. 

The tests taken after Woolmer was found strangled in his hotel room in Kingston, Jamaica, on March 18 were sent to the forensic science service to be independently verified, Jamaican deputy police commissioner Mark Shields said. 

The government-owned lab said it had not yet come to any conclusion as to whether Woolmer was poisoned. We wouldnt comment on ongoing cases, lab spokeswoman Laura Mackin said on Wednesday. 

We can confirm that weve got (the tests), but other than that, until theres some kind of conclusion, we wouldnt talk about the work that were doing with the police. 

It was earlier reported a toxicology test on Woolmers body showed the presence of a drug that would have incapacitated him and toxicology tests were due to be given to Jamaican Police within next week. 

Shields, a former Scotland Yard detective, has said in the past that foreign investigators would examine theories that Woolmer may have been drugged. He said that would have made it easier to strangle a man as large as Woolmer, a former England Test batsman.

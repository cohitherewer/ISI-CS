The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 France hold Italy

Cardiff: Germany kept up their relentless march to Switzerland and Austria with a 2-0 win over Wales here, while over in Milan it was stalemate between old foes Italy and France, on a charged programme of qualifiers at the Euro 2008 on Saturday. 

That goalless draw left France atop group B with Scotland up into second ahead of world champions Italy after a fine 3-1 win over Lithuania at Hampden. 

In a hard-fought encounter Italys Filippo Inzaghi lobbed on to the bar on the half hour and Nicolas Anelka of France only had keeper Gianluigi Buffon to beat following the break in the best chances of this tough-tackling match. 

Unbeaten Germany tightened their grip on group D, moving up to 22 points from eight games with a convincing 2-0 win over Wales in Cardiff, the goals coming from the boot of debut captain Miroslav Klose. 

The Czech Republic are placed second, five points behind after brushing aside San Marino with the Republic of Ireland third after their 2-2 draw in Slovakia. 

In Riga Northern Irelands six-match undefeated run was ended when an own goal by stand-in captain Chris Baird handed Latvia a 1-0 win to end the home teams seven-match losing sequence. 

That left Nigel Worthingtons men second in group F ahead of Iceland, who drew 1-1 with Spain, next week. 

In Amsterdam, Real Madrid duo Wesley Sneijder and Ruud van Nistelrooy were behind the Netherlandss 2-0 win over Bulgaria which lifted the Dutch up a place into second, three points behind group G leaders Bulgaria with a game in hand. 

Owens 38th England goal was sandwiched between Shaun Wright-Phillipss first-half opener and a Micah Richards header midway through the second period as Steve McClarens side strolled to their first win at the rebuilt Wembley. 

It lifted England into third in group E ahead of Wednesdays visit by Russia, lying second after beating Macedonia 3-0. 

McClaren also voiced confidence that Steven Gerrard would be ready to line up against Russia. 

Scotlands emphatic win over Lithuania firmly kept alive their dreams of making next years finals. 

Backed by a capacity 52,000 Hampden crowd, Scotland opened the scoring in the 31st minute when rangers striker Kris Boyd sent a diving header into the corner of the net. 

Tomas Danilevicius converted a dubious spot-kick after the hour mark to level but late goals from Stephen McManus and Evertons James McFadden gave Scotland a vital win. 

Scotland will face France in Paris next week bereft of striker Thierry Henry, the Barcelona attacker suspended after picking up a yellow card in Milan.

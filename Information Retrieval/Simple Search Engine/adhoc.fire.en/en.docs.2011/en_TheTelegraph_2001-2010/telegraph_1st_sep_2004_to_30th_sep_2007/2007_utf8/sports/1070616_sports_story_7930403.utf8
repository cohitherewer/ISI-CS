 Ashok Kumar well placed

Gurgaon: Ashok Kumar put himself in good position for his fifth title of the season as he lead by four shots in the rain-curtailed second day of the Rs 25 lakh Colour Plus Open at the Golden Greens Golf and Country Club. 

Gaurav Ghei shot a fine four-under 68 to climb into the second place at six-under 138. 

Midway through the second half, heavy rain forced suspension. Among those in the early stages of their second round was first round leader, S.S.P. Chowrasia. (PTI)

 Scotland captain to miss SA tie 

 Sharp Singles 

 Basseterre: Scotland captain Craig Wright has flown home after a family bereavement and will miss the next World Cup group A match against South Africa on Tuesday. Team manager Euan McIntyre said on Friday that Wright had returned home after his aunt died suddenly. 

He will, however, take part in the final league match against The Netherlands on Thursday, the team management said in a statement. Wright took one for 58 off 10 overs in the 203-run loss to Australia, dismissing captain Ricky Ponting. McIntyre said Zimbabwe-born Ryan Watson would lead Scotland against South Africa.

Pakistan protest

 Karachi: Pakistan have protested against the International Cricket Councils (ICCs) instruction, asking the players to speak in English during on-field media conferences during the World Cup. Media manager Pervez Mir the team had lodged a protest with the games governing body over the new norm. We are not happy with the instructions, he said.

Ponting goes soft 

 Melbourne: In a major climb down from his criticism of minnows inclusion in the World Cup, Australia captain Ricky Ponting has said the participation of second-tier nations in the big event would help make cricket a global game. We need the game to be strong all around the world, there is no doubt about that, Ponting said. 

It wasnt that long ago that a country like Sri Lanka was in a similar position and look where they have got to. If they can take something out of today, then alls well and good for the game around the world, he was quoted as saying by an Australian daily.

Cool Canada

 Toronto: With cricket grounds buried under snow and a hockey-mad country absorbed by the NHL playoff, Canadas seven-wicket defeat against Kenya in their World Cup opener did not exactly send the country into mourning. Wednesdays loss to Kenya frankly caused barely a ripple of concern in the Great White North. 

At a popular downtown Toronto sports bar owned by hockey great Wayne Gretzky, the seven-week long cricket World Cup in the Caribbean is not on the viewing menu. No one has requested that, so we do not have it, the receptionist Margarita said. Where is it?

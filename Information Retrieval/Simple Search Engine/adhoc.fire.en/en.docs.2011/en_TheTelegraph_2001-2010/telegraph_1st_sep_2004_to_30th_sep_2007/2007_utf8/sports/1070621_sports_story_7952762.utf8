 Sasikiran stumbles

Yalta: Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran suffered a shocking defeat against Grandmaster Dmitry Jakovenko of Russia in the second round of the Aerosvit International chess tournament here on Tuesday. 

Sasikiran, who started off with a victory over Alexander Onsichuk of United States, was completely out of sorts against Jakovenko and lost a theoretically drawn rook and pawns endgame after a long battle. 

Alexei Shirov of Spain emerged as the sole leader with his second successive triumph.. 

Shirov took his tally to two points and is now followed by Vassily Ivanchuk and Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine and Jakovenko who all have 1.5 points apiece. (PTI)

 Weve got to improve, admits Vaughan

England must step up their performances if they are to book a place in the semi-finals of the World Cup, captain Michael Vaughan has warned. Vaughans side laboured to a four-wicket victory against Bangladesh in Barbados Wednesday after bowling their opponents out for a modest 143. 

Englands top-order again failed with the bat, and after slipping to 110 for 6 in reply, Paul Collingwood and Paul Nixon were called on to see them home with 31 balls remaining in a 37-run stand. 

Vaughan, who top-scored with 30 against Bangladesh, said: It was tighter than wed have liked but we got the two points weve got a few days off now and we have to make sure we go into that South Africa game hopefully playing a little bit better. 

Bangladesh had just beaten South Africa and came here full of confidence and we just needed to win the game. Weve done that with not the best performance, so we can take confidence in that we havent played that well and weve won the game by four wickets. 

We know were going to have to improve our display when we play South Africa because we know they are a good side and theyre going to put us under pressure. 

But we showed our mettle against Sri Lanka, and at times against Australia. We will give South Africa a great game. 

Vaughan said that England needed to pay Bangladesh the respect they deserved after their surprising win over South Africa, and that victory was not a foregone conclusion. 

He said: These games are big banana skins. Everyone was talking about how they beat South Africa and we hadnt played Bangladesh and we needed the two points. 

We were just desperate to get the two points and give ourselves an opportunity in those two games and youve also got to be respectful of the fact they are playing good cricket. 

Theyve beaten India and South Africa and I can see why they are making it difficult for some good teams because of the way they play. 

Man of the Match Sajid Mahmood, who has flattered to deceive so far in the tournament, took three wickets and said the wicket was more to his liking. 

It was a little bit bowler friendly. Its got extra bounce and an extra bit of pace. 

I think Im hitting pretty good areas. I just need to further it against West Indies and South Africa, Mahmood said.

 Holland run Kenya close

Montego Bay: The Netherlands came within 10 runs of upsetting Kenya in a World Cup warm-up match on Thursday. 

The Africans, World Cup semi-finalists four years ago, made 274 for eight and the Dutch took it right down to the final over after a splendid 142-run opening partnership between Darron Reekers (75) and Bas Zuiderent (65). 

The Netherlands had Kenya in some early trouble at 21 for three. The recovery came through skipper Steve Tikolo (51) and Tony Suji, who put on 104 for the fourth wicket. The adventurous strokeplay of Thomas Odoyo (73) ensured a good tally for Kenya. 

The Dutch made a superb start, with Reekers and Zuiderent taking charge. Once they were separated, South Africa-born Ryan ten Doeschate led the charge. Ten Doeschate, who plays for Essex, took the attack to the Kenyans and his partner, New Zealand-born Peter Borren, hit three sixes in one over off James Kamende. 

But with ten Doeschate getting run out for 50 and Borren stumped off Tikolo in the 48th over, the challenge faded with 28 wanted off the last two overs. Off-spinner Tikolo ended up with figures of five for 48.

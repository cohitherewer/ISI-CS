 Ranatunga urges Murali to ignore Bedi

New Delhi: Former Sri Lanka skipper Arjuna Ranatunga urged Muttiah Muralidharan to ignore Bishan Singh Bedis criticism. 

Why does Murali want to spend his precious time on a person who may be talking under some influence? He should just think that when a dog bites, you dont go and bite the dog, Ranatunga said. 

Bedi had called Muralidharan the best shotputter in the game and a monster created by ICC. (PTI)

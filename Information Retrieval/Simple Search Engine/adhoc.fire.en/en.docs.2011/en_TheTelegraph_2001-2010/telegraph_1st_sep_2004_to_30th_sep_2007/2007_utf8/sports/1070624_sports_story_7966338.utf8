 Sasi suffers second loss 

Yalta (Ukraine): Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran suffered his second defeat at the Aerosvit International chess tournament, losing to Russian GM Sergei Rublevsky in the fifth round. 

Ukrainian Sergey Karjakin, meanwhile, shot into the lead with a fine victory over Alexei Shirov of Spain. 

Karjakin, who previously shared the lead with Shirov and compatriot Vassily Ivanchuk, was the beneficiary as Ivanchuk was held by Russian Dmitry Jakovenko. 

Ivanchuk is followed by a group of eight, sharing the third to 10th positions. The tournament is being closely fought and there is very little to separate the players. 

The games between Peter Svidler and Loek van Wely (The Netherlands), Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu and Lenier Dominguez, Alexander Onischuk and Pavel Eljanov were long, but without a result. 

Rublevsky played the popular Slav Defence against Sasikiran and the Indian GM responded by opting for sharp complications. 

Sasikiran readily accepted pawn weakness on the kingside in an attempt to wrest the initiative. His weak pawn structure proved to be the decisive factor and Rublevsky won the game in 51 moves. 

Karjakin showed great tactical resourcefulness in his victory over Shirov. (PTI)

 SHARP SINGLES 

Trim Cup: Hayden 

Bridgetown: Australia opener Matthew Hayden

 on Tuesday said that the World Cup is too long and called for the marathon

 tournament to be trimmed. Its too long. Its too long for everyone, said

 Hayden. World Cup holders Australia played their first match in the Caribbean,

 a warm-up game against Zimbabwe, in St Vincent on March 5.As a batter, its nice to be able to get that continuous sort of rhythm and once you get into that flow, you dont want to stop, added

 Hayden.

Moody blues 

 Colombo: Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) authorities said on Tuesday they had not been informed of a reported decision by coach Tom Moody to quit after the World Cup and return to Australia. He told us that his focus was only on the World Cup and he will be talking to us after the tournament is over, an SLC official said. A website quoted Justin Langer, the recently retired Australian opener, as saying that Moody would return home after the World Cup to coach the Western Australia state side. 

NZs Vaughan

Wellington: Former Test player Justin Vaughan was named on Tuesday as the new chief executive of New Zealand Cricket (NZC). Vaughan is a board member of NZC and chairman Sir John Anderson said he had all the attributes needed to lead the organisation. He takes over in June from another former Test player Martin Snedden.

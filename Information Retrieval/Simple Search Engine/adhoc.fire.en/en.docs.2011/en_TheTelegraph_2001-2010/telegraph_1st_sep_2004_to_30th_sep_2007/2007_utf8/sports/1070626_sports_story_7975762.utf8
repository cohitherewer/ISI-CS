 Players offer lifestyle tips

London: Martina Hingis tries to eat filet mignon once a week and, being Swiss, cannot do without her chocolate. 

Amelie Mauresmo is a great believer in walking her golden retriever dog. Elena Dementieva loves to cat-nap and takes her own pillow everywhere. 

Tennis ranks as one of the worlds most glamorous and financially rewarding sports. 

But staying on top can sap the stamina, as 15 top women players explained in a new lifestyle guide published on Monday. 

In the glossy Love Life book, they offered tips on everything from what to eat and what to pack through to how best to relax. 

Maria Sharapova, an instant celebrity after winning Wimbledon as a 17-year-old in 2004, said: Ive certainly learnt ways to make life easier and less stressful, whether it is eating correctly, getting over jet lag or just simply living out of bag! 

Frances Mauresmo, the defending Wimbledon champion, is a great believer in walking the dog and when she gets home loves to check out her vintage wine cellar. 

World number one Justine Henin tries to kid her body into shaking off the jet lag by setting her watch on destination time before she takes off on the flight to her next tournament. 

Relaxation is vital on and off court. Ana Ivanovic does deep breathing exercises before every match. 

In an interview to launch the book at Wimbledon, Dementieva said: I think it is mentally tough to be away from your family and friends all the time, travelling the world, taking the plane almost every single week. 

There are times when every hotel room from New York to Tokyo must start to look the same. 

Sometimes when you wake up in the morning you cant realise for a couple of minutes where you are, Dementieva said. Its hard to remember the room number. 

She takes her own pillow around the world as two hours of snatched sleep in the middle of the day can be an ideal way to recharge the batteries. 

This sport is really unique as we have to be ready every week. That is the most difficult part, she said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Outstation refs for weekend ties

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The standard of local refereeing has been the talk of the season. There have been complaints after almost every Premier Division match, Subrata Bhattacharya being the latest to join the chorus after East Bengals 1-0 win over George Telegraph on Wednesday. 

The IFA has had enough. Six days after turning down Mohun Bagans plea to have outstation or foreign officials postfor the derby tie, the IFA went back on its stance. 

We have decided to appoint outstation referees for the last two matches of the Premier Divisions first leg, said IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly. This decision has been prompted by widespread doubts and complaints. We want to see if theres any perceptible change in the standard by getting outstation officials. 

The two matches in question are East Bengal vs Chirag United SC (Saturday) and Mohun Bagan vs Mohammedan Sporting (Sunday). 

Well seek the AIFFs help in getting the best referees for the matches, added Ganguly. 

The Calcutta Referees Association (CRA) secretary Kamal Sarkar was satisfied with the IFAs logic behind such a step. The prevailing atmosphere is not conducive to good refereeing, Sarkar said. Referees are being purposely criticised. Their confidence is down. So Mr Ganguly has suggested we try out outstation referees in two matches. 

The East Bengal coach earlier spewed venom. The refereeing was motivated. My players (Edmilson and Dipankar Roy) were cautioned in such a way that theyll miss the next match, Bhattacharya said. 

Bhattacharya also said that Edmilson was denied a penalty by referee Dhanapati Roy.

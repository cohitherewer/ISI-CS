 Hurst to inspect stadium

Dharamsala: ICC Match Referee Allan Hurst will inspect the Dharamsala cricket stadium, which is aiming to become an international venue. 

The Australian would visit the northern hill resort on September 7 and is expected to submit his report to the ICC within 15 days of his visit. 

Dharamsala is the likely venue for the first one-day International in 2008, Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) president Anurag Thakur said. 

He said besides Dharamsala, Hurst will also inspect seven other cricketing centres including Rajkot and Chandigarh during his visit. 

The HPCA president said the venue has all the facilities including good hotel and an excellent ground. (PTI)

Kingston: The West Indies came up with a plucky batting performance built around Marlon Samuels counter-attacking half-century to post a challenging total against Pakistan in the World Cup opener here on Tuesday. 

Samuels cracked a stroke-filled 63 to lead the West Indian recovery after a minor top-order collapse and the lower-order followed it up with some cavalier shot-making to help the Caribbeans reach 241 for nine in the group D game at Sabina Park. 

Ramnaresh Sarwan did the early repair work with a scintillating 49 after Chris Gayle had fallen for two and skipper Brian Lara contributed a valuable 37. 

Down the order, Dwayne Smith produced a compact 32 that came off 15 balls and contained three fours and two sixes. 

Pakistan made a positive start when they dismissed Gayle in the third over and then picked two more to reduced the hosts to 77 for three. 

But the 1992 World Cup champions let the Windies off the hook through some average bowling and amateur fielding. 

Umar Gul (two for 38) and Rao Iftikhar Anjum (three for 44) used the new ball well and off-spinner Mohammed Hafeez (two for 39) kept things tight in the middle overs but the wheels came off in the closing overs. 

Smith and Bravo plundered 16 runs in the 48th over by Rana Naved-ul Hasan and Corey Collymore smashed Gul into the long-on stands off the last ball. 

Sarwan, returning from an injury lay-off, showed no signs of rust as he fluently drove the new ball bowl- ers through the off and straight. 

He made 49 from 65 balls with seven boundaries and put on 57 runs for the second wicket with Shivnarine Chanderpaul (19). 

The Jamaican middle-order batsman first took on Rao Iftikhar Anjum, smashing over the head for a six and four off successive balls in the 27th over. 

The 26-year old then turned his attention to leg-spinner Danish Kaneria, smacking him for a four and six to long on in the 31st over. 

Samuels, in the course of his innings, added 91 runs for the fourth wicket with Lara before the latter fell caught behind to Hafeez. 

He brought up his 13th ODI fifty with his third six of Shoaib Malik before falling to Hafeez. 

Smith and Bravo sustained the momentum and the fourth 50 of the innings came from only 47 balls. 

In the 48th over by Rana Naved, the two struck a four each and Smith collected an additional six.

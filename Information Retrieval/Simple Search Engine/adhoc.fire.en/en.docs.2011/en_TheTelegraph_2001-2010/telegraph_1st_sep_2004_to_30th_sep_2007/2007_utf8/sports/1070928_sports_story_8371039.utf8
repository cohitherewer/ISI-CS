 Symcox: SA the most dangerous place to live in

 Pat Symcox 

Durban: Former South African Test player Pat Symcox says the country has become the most dangerous place to live in and he is not surprised that young people are leaving the country in droves. 

Symcox, who recently quit cricket commentary, made the comments after his close friend was shot dead in front of his two children and wife by intruders in the town of Amanzimtoti, south of here. 

The 29-year-old Etienne Roets was a former cricket and rugby coach. The murder has caused widespread uproar in the country with Symcox calling for urgent action to eradicate crime. 

I have been comfortable living in South Africa until about two years ago. South Africa is a dangerous place to live in and to bring up your kids, he said. 

I dont think I can tell my son or my grand children to stay in South Africa. I think its time for people to get out of here. Young people are leaving and you cant blame them. And we are tired of those who blame crime on the legacy of apartheid, because it is the biggest rubbish of all, he added.

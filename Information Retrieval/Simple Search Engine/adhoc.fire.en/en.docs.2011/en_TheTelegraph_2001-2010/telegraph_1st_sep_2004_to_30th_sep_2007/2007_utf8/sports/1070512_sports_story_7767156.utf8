 Whatmore mum on PCB offer

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Whatmore 

Dhaka: Dav Whatmore doesnt wish to talk about the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) offer now. Instead, he is focused on the current series. But one thing is for sure, no decision will be taken before the conclusion of his final assignment as Bangladesh coach. 

I dont wish to discuss it now. I am focused on tomorrows match and this series. Whatever I say can be interpreted in different ways, Whatmore told The Telegraph Friday evening. 

The PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf had said in Karachi that they were in contact with Whatmore and that negotiations were on. 

Whatmore has also been tipped to take charge of India. Current cricket manager Ravi Shastri will not continue beyond this series.

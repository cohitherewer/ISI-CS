 Double delight for Federer

 Roger Federer 

New York: Roger Federer, in his 187th straight week as No. 1, coasted through his first-round match here at the US Open on Monday and happily announced how pleased he was that he had passed yet another milestone. 

Im happy to come through the first round, said Roger Federer, the Swiss master who is running out of other peoples records to pass. It is always tough, but now I am even past Steffi Graf. 

Graf, winner of 22 Grand Slam titles on the womens tour before retiring, held the No. 1 ranking in the world for 377 weeks, including 186 in a row. 

It was nicer to celebrate that after a victory, and that is exactly what Federer achieved with a 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 workout against young Scoville Jenkins, an American from Atlanta. 

Jenkins, 21, came into the match ranked No. 320, and even with that discrepancy in achievement level, acquitted himself well. He served big, hit hard and competed well. 

But he is years away from having the consistency needed to beat somebody the stature of Federer. 

Federer said he was happy here. Its always nice to come back to New York, he said. 

He also said that, despite the fact that he has won here the last three years, he is feeling sharper and in better shape than ever before. That does not bode well for his opponents. 

Most of his service games took about a minute and a half. Jenkins lost serve several times on double faults, including one in the third set when he hit a second serve 111 mph. Also long. Scoville had nine aces and seven double faults. Federer had 13 aces and two double faults. 

Federers final game, serving for the match at 5-4, was slightly more eventful. Jenkins attacked him well for love-30, then Federer hit a backhand just wide for 15-40 and two breaks points. 

But he got it to match point and then hit a 119-mph service winner. 

In the end, it had been a nice 1 hour 32 minute workout for Federer, and probably a fine learning experience for Jenkins.

 Another honour for Cristiano 

TELEGRAPH ONLINE

Cristiano Ronaldo has been voted Footballer of the Year by the Football Writers Association. 

The Manchester United winger topped the journalists poll ahead of Chelsea striker Didier Drogba. Ronaldos teammates Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes were third and fourth, respectively. 

It caps a superb season for the Portugal international, who also collected both the PFA Player and Young Player of the Year trophies. 

I am absolutely thrilled and delighted to win such an important award, it is a real honour, Ronaldo told the FWA after being informed of his victory in a poll in which an unusually high number of 12 players received votes. 

Ronaldo, 22, has been in fine form for his club, as United remain on course for a Premiership and FA Cup double, having reached the semi-finals of the Champions League. 

The achievement is all the more remarkable considering the harsh criticism Ronaldo received from some fans during the early stages of the season following Englands demise at the World Cup. 

Ronaldo will be presented with his latest accolade at the FWA Footballer of the Year dinner at the Royal Lancaster Hotel in London on May 17. 

Chairman of the FWA, Paul Hetherington said: After the events of last summer at the World Cup, the vote of the Football Writers Association shows that what we are all interested in is honouring the best player in the country. 

There have been no agendas carried over from last summer. This was a heavy poll of our members. Cristiano has been a runaway winner, and deservedly so. 

We also know we have a player who is absolutely delighted and honoured to receive this accolade.Former England captain Alan Shearer voted Footballer of the Year himself when at Blackburn in 1994 will propose a toast for the FWA, which this year celebrates its 60th anniversary.

 Howard lauds team

Melbourne: Bleary-eyed Australians celebrated a third consecutive World Cup triumph on Sunday morning, with Prime Minister John Howard among those who watched Ricky Pontings side triumph over Sri Lanka in Bridgetown. 

Congratulations to Ricky and the boys, Howard told a local TV station on Sunday. 

Howard slept as rain delayed the start of the match (scheduled at 11.30 pm local time), but awoke at his home in Sydney to watch Adam Gilchrist pulverise the Sri Lankan attack for 149 from just 104 balls. 

The rain delayed the start, I then got up in the middle of the night to see some of Gilchrist I went back to bed, then I watched the last two hours, he said. 

Howard described the victory as wonderful and paid special tribute to Glenn McGrath, who played his last match for Australia. 

To Glenn McGrath... thanks for a wonderful contribution to Australian cricket, Howard said. He is among Australian fast bowling greats, a wonderful bloke hes been a wonderful player and went out on a very high note.

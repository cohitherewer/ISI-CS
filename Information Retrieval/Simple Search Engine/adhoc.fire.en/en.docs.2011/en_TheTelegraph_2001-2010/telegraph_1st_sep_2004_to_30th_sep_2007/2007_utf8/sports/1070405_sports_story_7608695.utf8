 Md. Sp. show inspires Chima

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Chima Okerie is drawing inspiration from Mohammedan Sportings win over Dempo, ahead of Mohun Bagans match against league leaders Mahindra United Thursday. 

Mohammedan Sporting players were a surprised bunch against Dempo on Tuesday and theres something to learn from their show, Mohun Bagan coach said. 

My team has got both talent and class and so we will go into the match with confidence of making a turnaround, Chima said. 

Chima also hinted that the Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto may again be used as a substitute as he is not fit to play full 90 minutes. 

Its time to play not to talk, Barreto maintained, bypassing mediapersons.

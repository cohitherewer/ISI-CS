 3 wickets for Harbhajan

 Harbhajan 

London: Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh cast his magic spell to put Surrey firmly on the drivers seat against Yorkshire on the opening day of their County Championships Division One match at Headingly. 

Harbhajan claimed three wickets for one run in 24 balls to return figures of 20-8-34-3 to restrict Yorkshire to 203 for eight in 63 overs in their first innings on Friday. 

The Indians booty included Yorkshires top scoring batsman Anthony McGrath (72), who was followed by Tim Bresnan and Jason Gillespie. 

Harbhajan had picked three wickets in their previous match against Durham as well to help Surrey clinch a win. Pace spearhead Matthew Nicholson also helped Surreys cause by claiming 14-4-52-3 as Yorkshire, the County Championship leaders, struggled against pace and spin on a day curtailed by bad light and rain. 

Nicholson removed both openers, knocking back Joe Sayers leg-stump and trapping Craig White leg before. 

For Yorkshire, Gerard Brophy (22) and Adil Rashid (42 not out) also made useful contributions after skipper Darren Gough won the toss and elected to bat on an overcast morning. (PTI)

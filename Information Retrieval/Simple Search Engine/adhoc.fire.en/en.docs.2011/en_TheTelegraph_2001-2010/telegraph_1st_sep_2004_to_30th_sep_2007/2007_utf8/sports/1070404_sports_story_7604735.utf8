 Batsmen must be consistent: Fletcher

St Johns: England coach Duncan Fletcher seeks consistency from his batsmen as they prepare for Wednesdays crucial World Cup Super Eight encounter against Sri Lanka. 

Now they have to deal with explosive paceman Lasith Malinga. Demanding more runs from his faltering top-order, Fletcher has sought to demystify the slinging action of Malinga, who last week created one-day history by taking four wickets off four balls in the game against South Africa. 

Sri Lanka lost the match by one wicket, but Malinga hogged the spotlight and issued a warning to batsmen from other nations. 

Malinga is unusual. You can talk about his action, but getting out there and facing him is completely different to talking about it, says Fletcher. 

Hes a very effective bowler and under pressure you always fall back on what youve done before. 

Fletcher hopes his top-order will fire as England seek to reverse the result of last years NatWest series in which Sri Lanka blanked the hosts 0-5. Fletcher said England was then missing several key players. 

We go back and people forget that we were missing eight players at one stage, eight of our top players, said Fletcher, asserting that England should be judged by their recent tri-series triumph in Australia. 

Weve shown it against Australia, that we beat a top side on their home territory. Weve now got to make sure we win every game, if you dont you put pressure on yourselves. 

I dont think we played as well as we could, no doubt about it. We got a little bit complacent at times, and weve got to make sure we dont get that complacency against the better sides. 

England advanced from the preliminary round without a point having lost to the other qualifier, New Zealand, in the group encounter but picked up two from their 48-run Super Eight victory over Ireland. 

Sri Lanka now have four points after outplaying hosts West Indies by 113 runs on Sunday, having carried over two by topping their preliminary round group with three successive wins. Sri Lankas victory over the West Indies followed their loss in the first Super Eight outing against South Africa. 

Sri Lanka are now tipped to advance to the semi-finals. But captain Mahela Jayawardene said he was not looking beyond the upcoming contest against England. 

Its a big tournament and looking too far ahead would distract us from the first post, says Jayawardene, who has shrugged off his poor form ahead of the World Cup to post two half-centuries. 

Im not looking too far ahead, wed rather concentrate on one match at a time. 

It was Jayawardenes innings-building 183-run, third wicket partnership with former captain Sanath Jayasuriya that put Sri Lanka in a commanding position on Saturday against the West Indies. 

Aggressive opener Jayasuriya is one of the four members of the World Cup winning team of 1996 who are back for another shot at the title.

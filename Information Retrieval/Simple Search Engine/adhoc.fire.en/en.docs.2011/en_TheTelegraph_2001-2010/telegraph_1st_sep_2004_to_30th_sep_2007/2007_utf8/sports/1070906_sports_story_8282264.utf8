 Justine dents Serena resolve

LIZ ROBBINS

Justine Henin quietly uncorked one-handed backhands and pounded her forehands, moving with predatory precision under the lights while Serena Williams scrambled until she could only unleash frustrated screams. 

Serena Williams forced a tie-breaker in the first set on Tuesday night against Justine Henin, but lost her momentum in the second set. 

They had been worthy adversaries in the quarter finals of this years last three Grand Slam events, bringing out the best in each other, at least until Henin found a way to tap into Williamss worst side. 

On Tuesday at the Arthur Ashe Stadium, Henin, the worlds No. 1 player, easily punctured Williamss resolve with an iron will of her own, wearing her down for a 7-6 (3), 6-1 victory to advance to the semi-finals of the US Open. 

From Williamss perspective, she beat herself. I think she made a lot of lucky shots and I made a lot of errors, Williams, the eighth seed, said sourly during her post match news conference. 

In smiling contrast, Henin said: From the tie-break until the end, I played unbelievable tennis. Ive been aggressive like the No. 1 player in the world, just trying to dictate the points. And it was very good. 

For the first time in three matches on hardcourts, Henin was able to solve the Serena Williams mystery. For her effort, she might get the chance to play her older sister Venus in the semi-finals. Venus will play her quarter final match against No. 3 Jelena Jankovic. 

If I have to play Venus, it will be a good challenge for me to play both sisters in the same tournament, Henin said.

 Strong reply by South Africa

Georgetown: Ireland struggled to 152 for eight in their World Cup Super Eight match against top-ranked South Africa on Tuesday in an innings interrupted three times by heavy rain and reduced to 35 overs.

Under the Duckworth-Lewis method used in weather-affected matches, South Africa needed 160 to win. In reply, South Africa were cruising having reached 83 for two after 15 overs, with Jacques Kallis and Herschelle Gibbs batting on 32 and 6, respectively. 

AB de Villiers (0) and Graeme Smith were dismissed. 

 Ireland rsquo;s total looked far from enough to bother South Africa rsquo;s long batting line-up, who are looking for a second Super Eight victory. Ireland lost their first, against England.

Shaun Pollock, under pressure to pull out a big performance after being punished by Sri Lanka rsquo;s batsmen here last week, did just that. He took two for 17 from his maximum allotted spell of seven overs as South Africa sought a spot in the last four of the competition.

Fast-medium pacers Charl Langeveldt and Andrew Hall tore apart the heart of Ireland rsquo;s batting. Langeveldt took two wickets in two balls for overall figures of 3 for 41 and Hall took 2 for 37 from his maximum seven-over spell.

Having won the toss and put Ireland into bat, South Africa found bowling conditions ideal as tropical rain and cloud swirled around the Guyanese capital. Pollock found plenty of movement off the seam and in the air as he responded to his coach rsquo;s call for a powerful performance.

Jeremy Bray, who scored a century against Sri Lanka, went with no runs on the board to the 14th ball of the day, trapped leg before wicket to a ball that jagged back into his pads. With Makhaya Ntini pitching the ball short at the other end, Ireland limped to just 19 after 10 overs.

In between the rain breaks, opener William Porterfield scored 14 before top-edging a short ball from Pollock to Jacques Kallis at backward point.

When the covers were removed after an hour long break and an early lunch, the wicket dried quickly and Eoin Morgan and Niall O rsquo;Brien upped the run rate with some ambitious hitting.

Morgan hit two successive fours before skying Hall rsquo;s delivery to Ashwell Prince to be out for 28. O rsquo;Brien also threatened briefly with a pugnacious 25 before he skied Langeveldt rsquo;s delivery to Herschelle Gibbs.

With the hundred coming up off 26.4 overs, Andrew White was promoted up the order and he hit a quickfire 30 in 30 balls, with five fours.

But he played a horrible shot to a terrible delivery from South African skipper Graeme Smith, whose full toss should have landed in the half empty stands. Instead Gibbs was presented with an easy catch at mid-off.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 East Bengal colts beaten twice in a day 

Manchester: East Bengal under-15 side were humiliated twice in a day, receiving a severe jolt to their hopes of making the Nike Manchester United Premier Cup quarter finals on Wednesday. 

In the first match, the hosts Manchester United thrashed the Calcutta side 5-0 and a few hours later, Chinas Shandong Luneng handed them a 3-0 rout. 

On Tuesday, coach Swarup Das was praying for a favourable draw, but it didnt happen. The city colts found themselves huddling with Manchester United, AS Roma, Shandong Luneng FC and Austria Wien in group C. 

East Bengal kicked off the meet on a disastrous note as the hosts quickly showed their superior class. 

Manchester United pumped in three goals in the 20-minute first half. David starred in the hosts win with a treble (17th, 28th, 38th minutes), while Nicholas (11th) and Rovy (20th) too joined the party. 

East Bengal had their best chance to make a mark in the match against the Chinese side but conceding two soft goals put paid to their hopes and they had none but themselves to blame for the defeat. 

Shandong Luneng led 1-0 at half time before adding two more after the breather. 

Whatever we planned and practised did not reflect in the field. Its baffling to see the boys failing to play their natural game. They are far better than this. I think they just got overwhelmed by the occasion, a dejected Swarup said after the second match. (PTI)

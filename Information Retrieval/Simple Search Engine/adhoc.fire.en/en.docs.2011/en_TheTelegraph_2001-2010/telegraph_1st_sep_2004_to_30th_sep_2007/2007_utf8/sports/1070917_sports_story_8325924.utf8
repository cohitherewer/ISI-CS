 SA amass 154 for 8

Cape Town: A late blast by Albie Morkel helped South Africa reach a total of 154 for eight in their ICC World Twenty20 Super Eight match against England on Sunday. 

Morkel smashed his 43 off 20 balls. He hit three fours and four sixes, three of them consecutively off Chris Schofield. 

No. 7 batsman Morkel came to the crease in the 15th over after South Africa had slumped to 91 for five, and six balls later they were 94 for six. 

After England put the hosts in, Stuart Broad gave his team an early breakthrough as Jean-Paul Duminy, before opening his account, offered a thin edge to wicketkeeper Matt Prior and he accepted it gladly to send the South African opener back. 

Two overs later, Broad struck again to remove South African skipper Graeme Smith (19), who top-edged a delivery while trying to pull and Dimitry Mascarenhas took a simple catch at long leg. 

Sooner than later, Flintoff got rid of a dangerous looking AB de Villiers (18). Mark Boucher (29 off 29) and Justin Kemp (21 off 27) steadied the South African innings by adding 49 runs for the fourth wicket before Morkel unleashed his fireworks to see his side cross the 150 mark. 

Pace bowler Broad led the England attack with his return of three for 37.

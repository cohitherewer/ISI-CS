 Woods one shot off lead

 Sabbatini is in the lead 

Charlotte: South African Rory Sabbatini made a brilliant birdie at the last to earn a one-shot lead over Tiger Woods after the third round at the Wachovia Championship on Saturday. 

Sabbatini had a superb, bogey-free course record equalling eight-under-par 64 in benign conditions, intermittent light rain and hardly any wind at Quail Hollow. He made a dream start with an eagle from 80 yards at the par-four first, and capped off his round with a 20-foot birdie at the demanding par-four 18th. 

Sabbatini posted an 11-under 205 total, a score good enough to take the lead when Woods bogeyed the final two holes, while Fijis Vijai Singh (69) and American Arron Oberholser (69) also finished poorly to fall two shots behind. 

Woods pushed his drive into the rough at the last and had to almost tackle a photographer to prevent the snapper from treading on his ball. 

The world No. 1 then pulled a six-iron into the creek left of the green, but limited the damage to one dropped shot by getting up-and-down from 40 yards, sinking a six-footer in semi-darkness, the result of a two-hour morning weather delay. 

 I couldnt see, so I was just guessing on that one, Woods said of his putt. I knew it was left-to-right, but I didnt know how much. 

He wanted to make it not just to save a shot, but also to get into the final Sunday pairing with Sabbatini.

 Sania-Yung loses in final

New Delhi: Top seeds Sania Mirza and Yung-Jan Chan of Taiwan were upset by an unseeded Polish pair in the doubles final of the $ 200,000 Istanbul Cup tennis tournament in Turkey Saturday. 

According to information received here, Sania and Yung-Jan lost 1-6, 3-6 to Agnieszka Radwanska and Urszula Radwanska. The pair crushed the Indian stars hopes of back-to-back WTA doubles titles. 

Sania had bagged her fourth WTA doubles crown at the Morocco Open in Fes, partnering Vania King, last week. 

The Radwanskas broke their opponents in the sixth and eighth games of the second set to seal the match in their favour. 

Elena Dementieva won the singles title when Aravane Rezai withdrew from the final because of a knee injury. Dementieva was leading 7-6 (5), 7-3-0 when Rezai threw in the towel. (AGENCIES)

 Akhtar, Asif clear: PCB

Karachi: Fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif, who returned positive for banned substance nandrolone last year, have cleared the dope tests held last week, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Saturday. 

The tests were conducted on 26 players during the training camp and practice matches held here in the run-up to the ICC World Twenty20 meet, and all of them came out clean. 

PCB spokesman Ehsan Malik said tests would be conducted on Younis Khan, Danish Kaneria, Yasir Hameed and wicketkeeper Zulqarnain Haider, who are currently playing in different counties. 

Once the tests are conducted and cleared, we would complete the process of ensuring a drug-free system in our cricket. We conducted these tests under our new anti-doping regulations which are in line with the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) regulations, he said. 

The urine samples were sent to an International Olympic Committee-accredited laboratory in Malaysia, which sent their reports to the board Saturday. 

Akhtar and Asif were both recalled from India before the Champions Trophy last October after they tested positive in the out-of-competition tests conducted by the PCB. 

They were banned in November by a drugs inquiry committee of the board. Later, a PCB appellate panel exonerated the duo and lifted their bans, a decision that drew sharp criticisms from the ICC and Wada. 

The two pacers were also withdrawn from Pakistans World Cup squad at the last minute on fitness grounds though media continued to speculate that both had failed in privately held dope tests in London to know whether traces of the banned substance remained in their bodies. 

While experts believe that traces of nandrolone remain in the body for up to six months, Saleem, who heads the sports medicine department of the board, said no one could say for sure how long nandrolone traces could stay. 

There is no time frame for it. But it is good news that both players have cleared the fresh tests and this controversy, hopefully, will now come to an end, he added. 

He said the PCB continued to have a zero tolerance policy towards drugs in sports. 

A section of the local media, however, has claimed that the PCB didnt observe Wada regulations while collecting the samples. 

Some reports claim the board did not maintain the one-hour notice period given to an athlete before a sample collection as outlined in the Wada regulations. 

Asif said he and Shoaib never took banned drugs in their careers. 

I dont know how we tested positive last year because we had never taken any substance to enhance our performances. I am glad this chapter is closed now. At least now we can concentrate on cricket, he added.

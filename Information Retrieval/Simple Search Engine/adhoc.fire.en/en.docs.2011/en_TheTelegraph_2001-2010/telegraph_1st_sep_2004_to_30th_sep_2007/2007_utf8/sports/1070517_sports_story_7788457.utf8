Chelsea manager Jos Mourinho was arrested and cautioned after allegedly refusing to allow police to quarantine his pet dog Tuesday night. 

Mourinho allegedly clashed with police officers and a health official after they arrived at his home to take the Yorkshire terrier away. 

The Portuguese coach was attending Chelseas Player of the Year ceremony and received a call from his wife telling him police were at the house in Belgravia, west London. 

According to a newspaper report, Mourinho ran from the awards, took a taxi home and dragged the dog away from the health official. 

Eyewitnesses told the paper that the Chelsea coach bundled the animal into the street and allegedly set it loose. Police were reportedly still searching the streets for the terrier late at night. 

Mourinho was taken to Belgravia police station, where he was finger-printed, cautioned for obstructing police and released. 

Officials wanted to quarantine the dog because they suspected it may have been been taken abroad and back into Britain without the correct jabs. 

A Scotland Yard spokesman said officers went to an address in London at 7.45 pm. 

He said: A 44-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of obstructing police and was taken to a west London police station. He subsequently received a caution. 

Scotland Yard said the dog was to be seized for alleged offences under the Animal Health Act of 1981 and the Rabies Order of 1974.

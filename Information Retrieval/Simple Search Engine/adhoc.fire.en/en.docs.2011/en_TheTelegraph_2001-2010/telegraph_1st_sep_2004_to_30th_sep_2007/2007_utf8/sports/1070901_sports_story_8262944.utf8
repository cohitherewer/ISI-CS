 India off to winning start

Chennai: India began the defence of their their Asia Cup hockey title with a 1-0 win over China 1-0 in a pool B match on Friday. 

The Indians sealed the keenly fought encounter with an indirect penalty corner conversion by Dilip Tirkey in the 46th minute. 

The hosts earned two penalty corners in the first 14 minutes, but Raghunaths shots were well intercepted by De Yunze. Raghunath was brought in to the team to replace injured drag-flicker Sandeep Singh. 

Malaysia and Bangladesh the other contenders for an Olympic berth thrashed Singapore 8-0 and Thailand 13-0, respectively. 

South Korea swamped Sri Lanka 12-2 and Pakistan routed Hong Kong 6-1. 

The Pakistan players got into rhythm after a slow start but dominated proceedings for most part of the first half to take a 3-0 lead. However, they were guilty of squandering eight of the 10 penalty corners they forced. Muhammad Imran converted the two short corners. 

Playing under a steady drizzle in the second half, Pakistan shone in patches and added three more goals. Arif Ali got a consolation for Hong Kong. 

Doha Asian Games champions Korea scored a dozen against Sri Lanka with penalty corner specialist Jang Jong-hyun and Kim Byung-hoon netting four each. (PTI)

 Jeev, Jyoti for Cologne meet

Cologne: Jeev Milkha Singh and Jyoti Randhawa line up for the Mercedes Benz Championship at the famous Golf Club Gut Ldrchenhof on the outskirts of Cologne. 

The top two Indians made the elite field of 78 players by virtue of being in the top-60 of the current European Order of Merit. Jeev will go out with Carl Suneson and Soren Kjeldsen, while Randhawa plays with Alistair Forsyth and Loouis Oosthuizen. 

The field includes US Open champion Angel Cabrera, who will be making his first appearance in continental Europe since becoming the first Argentine winner of the US Open in June and only the second Major champion from his country, following Roberto de Vicenzos Open championship victory 40 years earlier.

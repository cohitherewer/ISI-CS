 Baroda surrender meekly

Vadodara: Mumbai came back from the brink to defeat Baroda by 63 runs and book a berth in the Ranji Trophy Super League final here Thursday. 

Chasing a victory target of 237, the hosts folded up for 173 runs in the face of effective medium pace bowling from Abhishek Nair (3/38), Wilkin Mota (3/36), Rajesh Verma (2/40) and Swapnil Hazare (2/41). 

Earlier, resuming at their overnight score of 109 for seven, Mumbais second innings finished at 145. 

The remaining three wickets fell quickly with Vinayak Samant contributing a resilient 66 in 136 balls, which included eight boundaries. 

Irfan Pathan and Rakesh Patel finished with match figures of seven for 123 and seven for 87, respectively. Baroda had only themselves to blame as they let the 36-time Ranji winners off the hook from a catastrophic 0 for five and then 17 for six in the second innings on Wednesday.

 Svetlana makes last four

New York: Former champion Svetlana Kuznetsova ended the run of Hungarian teenager Agnes Szavay at the US Open on Wednesday, beating the 18-year-old 6-1, 6-4 to reach the semi-finals. 

The Russian was too consistent for the world No. 31, easing to victory in 67 minutes to set up a clash with her compatriot, sixth seed Anna Chakvetadze. I am so happy with my performance today, especially in the first set, the fourth-seeded Kuznetsova said. 

I felt very good and enjoyed it. I play Anna now and I am very happy there is definitely going to be one Russian in the final. 

Szavay had taken the first set off Kuznetsova in the final of the WTA event in New Haven just before the US Open only to retire with a back injury, but she looked nervous early on in her first Grand Slam quarter final. 

Kuznetsova took the first set in 26 minutes and broke in the first game of the second set. Though Szavay lifted her game, the Russian held on to reach the semi-finals for the first time since she won the title in 2004. 

Novak Djokovic had his second marathon session of the tournament Tuesday and advanced after a gruelling match with Argentinas Juan Mnaco, who drew his more well-known opponent into a three-hour-53-minute battle that Djokovic ultimately won, 7-5, 7-6 (2), 6-7 (6), 6-1. 

I had to fight for every point, said Djokovic. I can say that Im pretty happy with my performance. 

The match featured a strange moment when a spare ball fell out of Mnacos pocket and disrupted a point. That was rare, but when it happened on a second occasion this time during the third-set tie-breaker officials punished him. Djokovic was awarded a free point, and importantly, it disrupted Mnacos momentum. (Agencies)

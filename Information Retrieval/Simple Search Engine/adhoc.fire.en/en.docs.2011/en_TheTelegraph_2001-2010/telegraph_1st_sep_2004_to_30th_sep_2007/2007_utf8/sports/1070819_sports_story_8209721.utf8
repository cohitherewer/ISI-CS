 Reading halt Everton

London: High-flying Everton came crashing back down to earth on Saturday with a 0-1 defeat at Reading while Tottenham Hotspur belatedly hit form with a 4-0 demolition of newly-promoted Derby County. 

Stephen Hunt scored Readings winner just before halftime and Everton, who had won their opening two matches, could find no way back after the break as they were knocked off the top of the table on goals scored by Wigan Athletic. 

Wigan gave Roy Keanes Sunderland a wake-up call with a 3-0 victory at the JJB Stadium. Two other sides looking for their first points of the season, West Ham United and Middlesbrough, both got off the mark. Big-spending West Ham won at Birmingham City thanks to a Mark Noble penalty while Egyptian striker Mido scored on his debut as Boro came from behind to beat Fulham 2-1. 

The match at Craven Cottage ended controversially, however, as Fulham appeared to have a late equaliser harshly ruled out when the ball was adjudged not to have crossed the line. 

Fulham also lost Brian McBride who dislocated his knee while putting his side ahead in the first-half. 

Sammy Lee is still waiting for his first points as Bolton Wanderers manager after his side were beaten 3-1 by a Portsmouth side inspired by Nwankwo Kanu to leave them bottom. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Honour for Rooney

London: Ricky Hatton has asked Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney to carry his belt into the ring in Las Vegas next month when the Briton defends his IBO world light-welterweight title against Jose Luis Castillo. 

The 28-year-old Hatton, a big fan of Uniteds fierce rivals Manchester City, will fight Mexican Castillo on June 23. 

Rooney will be in Vegas to support Hatton with fellow United players Ryan Giggs, Wes Brown and John Shea and 8,000 fans from Britain.

 ODIs keeping Test cricket alive, says Kapil

London: Legendary allrounder Kapil Dev has rated Test cricket as the ultimate but said it was fine to play the shorter versions the one-dayers and the Twenty20s to generate funds for keeping the five-day matches alive. 

As long as Test cricket remains in the world, I think it is the ultimate. And if you have to play Twenty20 and 50-over cricket to sustain Test cricket, I think that is fine, Kapil said. 

Indias only World Cup winning captain said the International Cricket Council (ICC) should also keep in mind the interest of Tests before making the calender. 

The ICC should always make a calendar which keeps Test cricket alive. It is the ultimate test for a cricketer of class, he told a British daily. 

Kapil, who led India to 1983 World Cup glory, praised the 50-overs a side game for making cricket more result-oriented and doing away with the mindset of draw. 

They used to say that the 50-over game was pyjama cricket and just slogging and eventually it became much bigger than Test cricket. 

I think one-day cricket has helped Test cricket with the fielding, running between the wickets and people getting in the habit of winning and losing matches. 

The mindset of the draw has gone, its now a case of lets win it. It has led to far more results in Test cricket in the last 10 years.

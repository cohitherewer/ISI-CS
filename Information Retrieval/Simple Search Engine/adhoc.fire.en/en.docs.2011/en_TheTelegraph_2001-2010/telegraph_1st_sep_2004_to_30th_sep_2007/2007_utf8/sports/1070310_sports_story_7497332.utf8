 Dope tests done in warm-up ties

Trelawny: The ICC has tested selected players in warm-up games to ensure a drugs-free tournament, Dave Richardson said. 

I understand that there were some target-testing done at warm-up matches, the ICC general manager, cricket, said. He did not, however, give any names. 

Whether there will be some more testing in the remaining warm-up games (on Friday), Im not sure, he said. 

Doping came to the fore due to the controversy involving Pakistan pacers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif who tested positive last year. 

The ICC then announced specific players would be tested apart from the routine random testing during Cup ties. 

Shoaib and Asif pulled out of the World Cup due to injuries amid media reports in Pakistan that the duo underwent private dope tests in London.

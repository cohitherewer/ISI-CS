 Raising a toast, Rohtak style

 - Little known Sharmas talk of their towns

Rohtak: Ever heard of a tiny paan shop owner in a rustic town being hotly pursued by a battery of newspersons for his comments on the last over of a World Cup final? Or an elderly Haryana housewife being pestered to say what exactly Kapil Dev had to tell her over the phone on Monday night? 

The modest Sharma household in Naya Padao, Aggrasen Nagar, is the most happening place in this dusty township. Joginder Sharmas aged parents Om Vir and Shashi Devi are the most sought after couple following Indias Twenty20 triumph in South Africa. 

Joginder has put Rohtak on the countrys cricketing map with a performance that could lure wrestlers away from the nearby akharas. 

Apart from left-arm spinner Rajinder Goel, who with 750 first-class wickets came closest to representing India, the town is widely known as a nursery for wrestlers. 

Since last night, Ive hardly had a chance to sleep, said Om Vir. There has been a stream of visitors and the phone has not stopped ringing from the time Jogi took that last wicket For some time I thought Diwali had come early. People in my neighbourhood went berserk bursting firecrackers and distributing sweets 

On Monday night, people in Rohtak took to the streets breaking into bhangra and embracing each other after the victory over Pakistan. 

Celebrations are still on. At noon on Tuesday, the small lane along the Rohtak railway tracks that leads to Joginders house was more crowded than the main market place. Even if one manages to jostle ones way in and reach the narrow staircase at the doorstep of their house, a meeting with his parents is not guranteed. Guarding the door are half a dozen stone-faced policemen. 

MP saab is congratulating Joginders parents, informs one of the policemen. Hamara Rohtak ka chora (Our Rohtak boy), the MP Deepinder Singh Hooda says in local lingo and announces a purse of Rs 21 lakh for Joginder. After a round of applause, the MP leaves with his entourage. 

The only person who has remained unperturbed amid all this is Joginders mother. 

Before leaving for South Africa, he promised to try and bring home the Cup. When he called last night, the first thing he reminded me of was how he had kept his word. There cannot be a bigger satisfaction than this, she said. 

This is the biggest moment in Rohtaks history, said Ashwani Kumar, Joginders coach and mentor since 1998. 

The citys pride so far was Goel, but Jogi has done us all proud. As Haryana coach for the last seven years, Ive handled many boys, but few have shown his determination. 

Coming from a modest background, few expected Joginder to excel. The youngest of four siblings, Jogi is the only graduate in the family. He learnt the tricks of the trade at Shri Ram Narayan Cricket Club. 

Ashwani summed it up well. Jogi has given India the Cup, but you cant imagine what his deeds have done for our town. After the defeat in the World Cup (in the West Indies), we were hardly getting new trainees. This victory will change that.

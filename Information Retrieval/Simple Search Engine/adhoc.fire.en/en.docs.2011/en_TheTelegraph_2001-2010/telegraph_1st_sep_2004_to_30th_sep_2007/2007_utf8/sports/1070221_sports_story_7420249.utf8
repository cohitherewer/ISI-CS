 Dawn of a new era, says Bagan coach

 - Life has come full circle for me: Chima

Calcutta: It was 8.30 am Tuesday at the Mohun Bagan ground. Unlike the football teams previous training sessions, there was an unusual air of excitement. 

Egged on by a barefooted Chima Okerie, Mohun Bagan players were seen jostling among themselves, fighting with each other. Captain Jose Ramirez Barreto, for example, was in a duel with Manas Das. Even an injured Bhaichung Bhutia (hamstring problem) took part in the proceedings stretching with Robson, now back to his original role of team physio. 

On Day One of Chima taking charge as coach, the renewed vigour of Mohun Bagan players struggling to get their bearings right after four defeats in the NFL was palpable. 

The opening session with the new coach lasted over three hours. In Chimas words, it was the dawn of a new era. 

With two crucial matches (against Mohammedan Sporting and East Bagan) lined up in the next six days, time is ticking fast for the former Nigerian striker. Chima, though, is unconcerned about the past. Only the present matters to him, and so the focus is on basics. 

Leave the past, this is a new beginning... Every match is a new match. We might be lying low, but its just a matter of a few wins. Its just a starting problem but that does not mean we are out of contention. Someone has to be there at the top at any point of time... Its just that they have won and weve not, is how Chima analysed the present. 

His objective is to play good football. Results will automatically follow. 

Chima stressed on the need for a goalkeeping coach. Ill require a goalkeeping coach. It will be a good idea to have somebody with experience. Ill talk to the officials. 

Assessing the team, he said: On the positive side, we have many youngsters who are eager to prove something, which is a very good sign. However, they may not be knowing how to apply themselves. Theres a lot of energy in the team, just that they are not using the energy properly. I have to guide them. 

Flattered and honoured to be given the coachs post, Chima said: Really, it feels like coming back home life has come full circle for me. Its where I began and now coming back to the same dressing room as coach and seeing all the guys gives me a great feeling. 

Chima hoped that Bhaichung would be fit for the Mohammedan Spoting match on Friday. He still has some strains, but Im hopeful. 

On Jose Barretos lean patch, the Nigerian said: Theres too much pressure on him let him enjoy his football. 

He also had a good word for predecessor Robson. Its like when dad goes away, somebody takes his place to look after the family. Robson did just that, looking after the team and he did quite well. We should not disrespect him. 

Chima looks up to former India coach Syed Nayeemuddin as his coaching idol. His tips and training may not give you instant results, but he prepares you for the long run. 

Coaching, said Chima, is more challenging than playing. Playing was a lot easier Here Ive to maintain an equilibrium, concentrating on a collective performance from the team.

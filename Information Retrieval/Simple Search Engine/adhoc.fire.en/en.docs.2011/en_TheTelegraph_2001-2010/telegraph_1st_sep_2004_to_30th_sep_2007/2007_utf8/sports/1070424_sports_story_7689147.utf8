The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Haydens sole agenda

Castries: Two balls short of a World Cup record on his return to the Australia team, Matthew Hayden patted a delivery from Graeme Smith back down the pitch. 

The next he struck over the South Africa captains head and the white ball clattered against the black sightscreen at the tiny St Kitts ground. 

Hayden had his century in a World Cup record 66 balls and the comeback was complete. 

Hayden, 35, did not form a part of Australias one-day plans for almost a year and winning his place back this year only through injury to Shane Watson. 

Selected to tour New Zealand, Hayden ensured his place in the World Cup squad by scoring an unbeaten 181 in a losing cause in the final match of the Chappell-Hadlee series. During the innings Hayden broke his right toe and missed his teams warm-up matches in St Vincent. 

Instead, he took brisk walks around the outfield, usually accompanied by physiotherapist Alex Kountouris. Cleared by Kountouris to resume throw-downs in the nets, Hayden proved a menace to life and limb as he slammed the ball repeatedly into the tropical vegetation at one of the Australians practice grounds and was declared fit to play in the group matches. 

South Africa, the new world No. 1 side, were expected to provide the game of the first round. Instead, Haydens 101 was the foundation of an Australian total of 377, which was to prove well beyond South Africas reach. 

His 158 against the West Indies in Australias first match of the Super Eight, the highest World Cup score by Australia, was a brilliant innings. Hes battled hard to get back into the side, he always believed he should be in the side, said Australia coach John Buchanan. 

 We are here to win the World Cup, he said. Thats what we set out to do. Thats our objective through this tournament.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Shastri sought transparency

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai: The job done, interim cricket manager Ravi Shastri insisted that chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar be transparent about Fridays selection committee meeting. 

Whatever Vengsarkars own thoughts, Shastri said he must tell the public that while Sachin (Tendulkar) and Sourav (Ganguly) had been rested, others were dropped, somebody connected with the selection process told The Telegraph. 

Vengsarkar, indeed, did say just that during his interaction with the media. Harbhajan Singh, Ajit Agarkar and Irfan Pathan are the ones dropped that too from both squads. 

Virender Sehwag survived, but has only made the ODI squad. 

While Harbhajan can make a quick comeback, Agarkar and Pathan have few admirers at this point in time. Agarkar is in his 30th year, while Pathan has the advantage of age (22).

 Kartik effort goes in vain

London: A stunning display of spin bowling by Murali Kartik went in vain as Essex clinched a narrow three-wicket win with a ball to spare against Middlesex in a Twenty20 match of the English season on Friday. 

Kartik claimed five for 13 in four overs as Essex, chasing 127, were reduced to 53 for four at one stage. But Ravi Bopara (46 not out) and Ten Doeschate (26) revived the Essex hopes with a 54-run partnership. 

The Indian left-arm spinner broke the association by having Doeschate bowled and raised visions of victory for Middlesex.

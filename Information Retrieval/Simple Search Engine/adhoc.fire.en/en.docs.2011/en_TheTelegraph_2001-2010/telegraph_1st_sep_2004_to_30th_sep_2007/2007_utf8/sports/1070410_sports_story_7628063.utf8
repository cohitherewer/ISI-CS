 Tait exorcises Ashes ghost

St Johns: Australian speedster Shaun Tait said his MoM-winning three for 41 against England on Sunday helped erase bitter memories of the 2005 Ashes. 

Tait, who arrived in England amid much hype about his express fast bowling, failed to live up to expectations as England beat Australia 2-1 to regain the Ashes after 18 years. 

But the 24-year-old South Australian was at his terrific best on Sunday, swinging the new ball and reverse-swinging it at the closing stages to stunning effect. 

The Ashes (2005) is a distant memory. Probably I was nervous then, Tait said after the match. I am pretty confident now. I have been in the team for a while now and it comes with a few good performances. 

He said claiming wickets with the new ball was more of a relief than striking with the older one. 

I am quite happy that I took wickets with the new ball. I have struggled before, whereas I took wickets through reverse swing. Today I swung the new ball and felt comfortable. 

Captain Ricky Ponting, who complimented Taits efforts with a ruthless innings of 86, said intensity made the difference between the two teams. 

We had early problems but fought all the way. What made the difference was our intensity when things were not going our way, Ponting said. 

Our bowling and fielding were brilliant, especially bowling at the end of the innings, Ponting said. 

Ponting delayed the third power play when Kevin Pietersen (104) and Ian Bell (77) were going great guns. 

It is pretty hard work for the bowlers and captains tend to get rid off it at the earliest. But we got the reverse swing going.

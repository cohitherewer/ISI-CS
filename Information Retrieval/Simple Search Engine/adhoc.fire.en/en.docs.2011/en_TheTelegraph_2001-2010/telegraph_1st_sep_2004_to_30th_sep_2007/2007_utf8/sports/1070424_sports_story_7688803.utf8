The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Task cut out for Md. Sp. 

Mumbai: Playing at home for the first time in the second-leg of the 11th National Football League, Air India would be hoping to continue their good form and garner maximum points from their clash against Mohammedan Sporting at the Cooperage on Tuesday. 

Air India currently have 17 points from 13 matches. 

Mohammedan Sporting (11 points) who are languishing second from bottom, face an uphill task to avoid relegation. 

The last time these two teams met in the first-leg, it turned out to be a high-scoring affair with the match ending 3-3. 

Mohammedan Sporting coach Biswajit Bhattacharya knows how difficult it is to beat Air India at home. Im just keeping my fingers crossed and hoping a win will come our way, he said. 

Meanwhile, Churchill Brothers on Monday edged past HASC by a D. Raju goal in the ONGC National Football League. (PTI)

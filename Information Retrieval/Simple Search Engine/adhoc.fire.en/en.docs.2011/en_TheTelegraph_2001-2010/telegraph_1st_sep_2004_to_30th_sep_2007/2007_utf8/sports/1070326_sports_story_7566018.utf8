 Australians stand firm in big-hitting battle of top 2

Neil Manthorp

Australia emerged victorious from an orgy of runs in the most keenly contested match of the World Cups group stage and, for seven hours at least, the two teams managed to turn the cricketing worlds attention back to on-field matters on Saturday. 

Just over a year ago Australias total of 377 for six would have been so far removed from the reality of a run-chase that the opposition, whoever they were, would have conceded defeat. At least privately, if not publicly. 

But everything changed at the Wanderers in Johannesburg 53 weeks ago when South Africa successfully chased 434 against the same opponents and for a long, long while on Saturday it seemed they might be able to repeat those heroics. 

An opening stand of 160 between Graeme Smith and AB de Villiers came at eight runs an over and Ponting emulated Smith earlier in the day by anxiously consulting his bowlers two or three times throughout each over, apparently helpless. 

But both teams needed some luck for their wickets and a direct hit from deep wicket by Shane Watson sent De Villiers on his way for 92 from 70 balls and just a couple of overs later Smith was forced to retire on 72 with severe cramping and the impetus had been wrenched away. 

Not that Australia didnt deserve their victory. Matthew Hayden smashed the fastest World Cup century from just 66 deliveries while Ponting and Michael Clarke made 90s. 

Bob Woolmers tragic death hung over this match as surely as it does over the whole tournament and South Africas senior players, in particular, struggled all week to come to terms with the loss of a man who wasnt just their coach between 1994 and 1999 but had become a close friend and mentor to the likes of Shaun Pollock, Jacques Kallis, Mark Boucher and Herschelle Gibbs. 

But that was no excuse and by the time the game started they were as focused as they could be. Smiths decision to put Australia in to bat after winning the toss was based entirely on his desire to chase a total, rather than bowl first on the smallest ground in international cricket. 

Gibbs six sixes against Hollands hapless leg-spinner Daan van Bunge earlier in the week was just one example of how much fun good batsmen can have its not just the length of the boundaries but the speed of the outfield and quality of the pitch which combine to make this the ultimate bowlers hell. 

But despite their glut of runs against minnows Holland and Scotland in the opening games, neither of the major sides knew what a good total would be against each other and Smith was perfectly happy to allow Ponting to decide. 

Hayden and Adam Gilchrist made an extraordinary start against bowling from Pollock and Makhaya Ntini which was respectable if not inspired. Simply by playing their defensive shots aggressively they pierced the infield at least twice an over and a pierced infield here means a boundary. 

After five overs the score was exactly 50 and Smith was acting the part of a personal trauma counsellor to his senior bowlers. After 15 overs, the total was 106 when Gilchrist (42) misread a slower ball from Charl Langeveldt and spooned a soft catch to backward point. 

Hayden, however, accelerated as Ponting played himself in and had reached 94 from 65 balls when he launched a straight six back over off-spinner Smiths head to eclipse Canadian captain Jon Davisons 67-ball century made against the West Indies in Centurion four years ago. Just two balls later he made the same mistake as Gilchrist but this time the slower ball came from Jacques Kallis. 

Pontings innings was a strange affair. Typically brilliant at times, it was also a damp squib. A mistimed drive to the shortest boundary on the ground was taken at long on and he departed for 91 from 92 balls with eight fours and two sixes. 

Pollock, who was specifically targeted by the opening batsmen suffered his most expensive analysis (10-0-83-0) in 271 matches and if pitches remain as placid and unhelpful as this one, the great man may well find his now medium pacers being lined up for special treatment by other teams in the Super Eight section.

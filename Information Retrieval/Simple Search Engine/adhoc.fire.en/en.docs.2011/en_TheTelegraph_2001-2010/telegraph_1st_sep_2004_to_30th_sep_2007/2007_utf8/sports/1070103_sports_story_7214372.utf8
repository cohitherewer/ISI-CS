 Sehwag in middle-order not a bad idea: Shastri

 - Three former openers not critical of move to promote Karthik 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Virender Sehwag 

Cape Town: The Team India thinktank chose to protect Virender Sehwag in the third and final Test, but three former openers Barry Richards, Ravi Shastri and Aamer Sohail who spoke to The Telegraph (on Tuesday afternoon) werent critical of the move to promote wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik. 

The following are excerpts from what they said: 

Richards: Im for specialists doing the openers job, but the Indians got forced into changing the batting order Had conditions been otherwise, Im sure Sehwag wouldve been dropped... As for Karthik, well, if a non-specialist had to get the role, then anybody could... Provided, of course, the batsman wants to do the job... I havent seen such a flat wicket for a long time and some would get tempted to come out of retirement! In fact, it may remind Sehwag of Multan. 

Shastri: If a change had to be made, I wouldve liked Rahul Dravid to open Perhaps he wouldve, had we fielded first... Sending Sehwag to the middle-order isnt a bad idea... I dont agree that a wrong signal has been sent... Its a horses-for-courses decision and he could make the most of this opportunity On this wicket, Sehwag had to play. 

Sohail: After the first Test itself, Id suggested in these columns that it would be okay for Sehwag to bat in the middle-order till his confidence returned That has happened On such a flat wicket, anybody could open The batsmen are getting so much time

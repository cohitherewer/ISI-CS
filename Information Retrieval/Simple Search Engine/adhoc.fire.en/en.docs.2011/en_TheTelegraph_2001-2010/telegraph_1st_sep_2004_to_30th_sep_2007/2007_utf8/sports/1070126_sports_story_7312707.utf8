Calcutta: Karnataka, who were in the process of making amends to their first innings debacle at the end of the second day, did one better on Thursday. They opened up a 168-run lead with five wickets in hand in their Ranji Trophy Super League semi-final against Bengal at the Eden. 

After being skittled out for 89, the visitors were going strong on 317 for five at stumps on Day III in reply to Bengals 238. 

Building on a solid foundation given by openers Bharat Chipli (95) and Rowland Barrington (52), the Karnataka batsmen patiently gained control of the proceedings. 

Chipli, unlucky to stop five runs short of the three-figure mark, was trapped leg-before by Bengal pacer Ranadeb Bose. 

 He batted for 224 minutes, playing 138 balls with 16 hits to the fence. Barrington, who gave Chipli excellent company, played 141 balls in 204 minutes and hit seven boundaries. The openers stitched a 151-run partnership that helped then take charge of the proceedings. 

Ranadeb again struck early blows just after the one-hour mark. Chairman of selection committee Dilip Vengsarkar, though, missed the action as he arrived only after tea. 

Ranadeb sent back Rowland in the last ball of the 14th over when the batsman was on 52. The visitors lost their second wicket in Bharat Chipli after adding only 13 runs to the board. 

After the openers fell in a span of 13 runs, KB Pawan and Chandrashekar Raghu took over efficiently. While Pawans (43) wicket was claimed by part-time bowler Rohan Gavaskar, Raghu remained unbeaten on 78. 

Raghu was at his best at one end while Thilak Naidu scored the bulk of runs for Karnataka. But there was again a twist in the tale when the new ball was taken in the 96th over. 

Ranadebs partner Sourav Sarkar this time rose to the occasion and picked two wickets Naidu and Balachandra Akhil in the same over. Souravs tally in the match stands at six compared to his senior partners eight so far.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 When Kiran More got it right

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: The jury is still out on the controversial Kiran Mores last year as selection committee chairman, but he had the good sense to think of reviving Anil Kumbles one-day career. 

The move was informally decided upon midway during the series against England, almost a year ago, with More and Co. planning to bring the veteran leggie back during the October-November Champions Trophy. 

A shoulder injury soon after the Test series in the West Indies, however, delayed Kumbles comeback till the (disastrous) ODIs in South Africa. 

By then, Mores term was over and Dilip Vengsarkar had taken charge. There was continuity, though, as three selectors stayed on. 

Whatever the other differences between the two, the new chairman too felt Kumbles one-day career wasnt over. 

It didnt matter that he hadnt played for 14 months. 

Our idea then was to use Anil as our trump card in the World Cup Wed expected conditions in the West Indies to favour fielding both spinners (Harbhajan Singh being the other), but that never happened, one of the selectors told The Telegraph. 

By his own admission, Kumble was hurt at being dropped for the crucial match versus Sri Lanka it turned out to be Team Indias last in the World Cup. 

The script, clearly, didnt unfold the way More (and the rest of the country) would have liked and Kumble has quit ODIs with a heavy heart. 

I wanted to go with the ball in my hand he said in Bangalore, conceding defeat to destiny.

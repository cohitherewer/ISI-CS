The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Take nothing away from Irelands achievement

Fast Track

Courtney Walsh

Of the first few games in this World Cup, apart from the West Indies-Pakistan opener, the rest have largely been Test-playing nation versus minnow variety, where the outcome would seem a foregone conclusion. 

However, the result (a tie) of the Ireland-Zimbabwe encounter has once again demonstrated the World Cups ability to throw up surprises, not necessarily unpleasant. 

The participation of teams outside the top eight on the ICC rankings table has quite often invited criticism and sometimes ridicule. For the record, I beg to differ. I have nothing against the minnows playing in the World Cup. 

Admittedly, the pulsating match that we witnessed at Kingston on Thursday would probably never have been as evenly matched had the competing teams been Ireland and Australia, for instance, but that should take nothing away from Irelands achievement in their first World Cup. By any standards, defending a relatively modest total like 221 requires plenty of nerve, and Ireland showed more than enough to force a tie. 

When you consider that Zimbabwe needed a mere 15 runs in six overs with four wickets in hand to win, Irelands bowling performance is pretty much heroic. 

Of course the real hero of was Jeremy Bray, and I suspect we will hear much more of this Irishman who is actually from New South Wales before the tournament is over. 

For all the flak directed at the decision to include teams such as Canada, Scotland and Ireland in a big-league tournament of this nature, I would say anything that encourages the spread of popular interest in cricket is welcome. 

The quality of cricket on display at Sabina Park had nothing much wrong with it, because whatever the level of a teams talent, qualities like nerve, grit and the ability to negotiate a crisis are universal and cannot be qualified. 

Of the forthcoming games, therefore, I would watch out for the West Indies-Zimbabwe encounter on Monday with some interest. All of us know by now that the team from Africa is viewing the West Indians as potential targets for an upset, keeping in mind the great upset that another team from Africa pulled off in 1996. 

The logic behind Zimbabwes reasoning is apparently the West Indies inconsistency that makes them play terribly one day and brilliantly the next. 

On current form or the kind of form they showed against Pakistan one would find it hard to imagine the West Indies losing to anybody, much less a team outside the top eight. 

So the Zimbabweans are probably trying to generate their brand of psychological pressure. However, as any team that has lost to far less fancied opponents would testify, nothing and nobody could be taken for granted in one-day cricket. 

The minnows have nothing to lose we all expect them to lose, if you will forgive the poor wordplay and whatever they achieve is a bonus. They will play with the sort of abandon that established teams find hard to match. 

However, that is in the future. 

As you read this, you will know the outcome of the England-New Zealand clash at St Lucia, but without that benefit, I would like to stick my neck out anyway and predict that the advantage lies with England. 

They have the right momentum and carry the confidence of having beaten a near full-strength Australia in Australia. 

So my winner is England, but who knows, New Zealand are not labelled dark horses for nothing!

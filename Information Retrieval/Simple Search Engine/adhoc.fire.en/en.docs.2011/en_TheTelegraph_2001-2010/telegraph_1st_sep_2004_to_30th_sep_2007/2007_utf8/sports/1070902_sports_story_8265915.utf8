 Shukla joins Kalighat

 Sport Briefs 

 Calcutta: Having closed the ICL chapter, Bengal allrounder Laxmi Ratan Shukla on Saturday signed for Kalighat Club. The former East Bengal player and four others (Sourashish Lahiri, Ashok Dinda, Sanjib Sanyal and Sanjay Goel) have switched allegiance. 

Kalighat Club unveiled its 17-member squad on Saturday. It includes two from Shambazar (Wriddhiman Saha and Aveek Chowdhury) and one from Aikya Sammilani (Amit Biswas), while the remaining nine have been retained. 

Having declined the ICL offer, Shukla now aims to concentrate on the job at hand. Im looking forward to play for Kalighat. I represented East Bengal for about four years and Im looking to continue the same way here. 

In a bid to revive club cricket, Kalighat have grandiose plans to rope in international cricketers. Were looking at popularising cricket at club-level. Imagine players like (Glenn) McGrath and Brian (Lara) turning out, clubs cricket secretary Jeet Banerjee said. 

Also director of Gameplan, Banerjee said former Australian coach John Buchanan once spoke to them, inquiring about short-term coaching prospect at this level.

Sreesanth aims more yorkers

I have to keep my focus and keep doing the right things.

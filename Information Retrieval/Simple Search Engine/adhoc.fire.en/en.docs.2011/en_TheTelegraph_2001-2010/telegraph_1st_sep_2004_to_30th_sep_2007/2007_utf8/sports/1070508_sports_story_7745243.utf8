 Kim did a lot for the game

Tributes flowed in for Kim Clijsters, who retired from tennis on Sunday. The following is what some of the players had to say: 

JUSTINE HENIN: I have a lot of respect for what she did in her career. Its pretty emotional because we spent a lot of time together when we were younger and we grew up together on the Tour. She did a lot for the game... I will have great memories of her. 

AMELIE MAURESMO: I think she had been thinking about retiring for a while so Im sure she is really convinced that its the right decision for her. Personally I always enjoyed our rivalry because it brought the best out in both of us. 

SERENA WILLIAMS: She was a great player, a great competitor and an even better person. We had some great matches but Ill miss her most in the locker room.

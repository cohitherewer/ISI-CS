 Jeev at tied 99th spot

Dublin (US): Jeev Milkha Singh returned a poor four-over 76 to be placed tied 99th while Swede Daniel Chopra carded a one-under 71 to be at tied 48th after Day I of the Memorial Tournament. 

Jeev sank in three birdies against five bogeys and a double-bogey, while Chopra was slightly better off with five birdies, three bogeys and a double-bogey. 

Jeev made a poor start as he bogeyed the third hole before dropping three shots in a row from sixth to eighth. 

Four-over at the halfway mark, the Indian birdied the 10th before stumbling to a double-bogey on the 11th. He managed a couple of birdies on the 13th and 14th but a dropped shot on the 17th saw him end on a disappointing note. 

Australians Rod Pampling and Nick Hern, and American Sean Hair shared a three-way tie for the lead. 

Hair and Pampling had identical cards on the front nine, both players posting five birdies to join Hern on seven-under-par 65. 

They headed a group of five including South African Ernie Els, by one stroke, while three-time champion Tiger Woods could not capitalise on a great start, shooting two-under 70, after being three under through six holes. 

World No. 2 Phil Mickelson withdrew after 11 holes due to a left wrist injury. (PTI)

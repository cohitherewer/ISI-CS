The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Vengsarkar, Shastri among Warnes chosen ones

A STAFF REPORTER

 Dilip Vengsarkar and Ravi Shastri

Calcutta: Former India captains Dilip Vengsarkar and Ravi Shastri found mention as retired Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne announced the first instalment of his list of 50 great players. 

Warne, in his column for The Times, London, announced the first batch of cricketers he ranked from 41-50, which has Shastri at 42 and Vengsarkar at 46. 

Warne paid glowing tributes to Vengsarkar, currently the chairman of the selection committee, describing him as a very stylish, elegant batsman. The leg-spinner was also generous in his praise for Shastri a very effective player and a handy spin bowler for a captain to have up his sleeve. 

He sprang a surprise of sorts naming Victorians Darren Berry (49) and Jamie Siddons (50) in his list none ever played a Test. 

The following are excerpts from Warnes column on his chosen ones: 

 50) Jamie Siddons (Victoria) 

First-class matches: 160 

Runs: 11,587 at 44.91 

Catches: 206 

As an allround fielder, with a rocket arm, I rank him second behind Mark Waugh among Australians I have seen. He is recognised as one of our best batsmen not to have played Test cricket. I thought he was especially good against spin and have fond memories as he was in the Victoria team when I made my debut. 

 49) Darren Berry (Victoria) 

First-class matches: 153 

Runs: 4,273 at 21.58 

Catches: 552 

Stumpings: 51 

Another Victorian to miss out on Test cricket. He is the purest wicketkeeper I have seen. The ball sounded extra-soft in his gloves. His catching was so reliable that first slip could stand wider and the cordon covered more ground. He once stumped David Boon down the leg side standing up to Paul Reiffel a brilliantly executed plan. 

 48) Brian McMillan (South Africa) 

Test matches: 38 

Runs: 1,968 at 39.36 

Wickets: 75 at 33.82 

For a big fellow, he did not hit the ball as hard as you would expect, but he could be a sharp bowler and a wonderful slip fielder. It helped that his hands were just enormous. He was a very tough guy to play against, especially when you were meeting him for the first time, but he was also an enjoyable opponent. 

 47) Chris Cairns (New Zealand) 

Test matches: 62 

Runs 3,320 at 33.53 

Wickets: 218 at 29.40 

He played the most incredible shot off my bowling during a game in Hamilton. Placing his left leg into the rough, he swivelled to face square leg and hit the turning ball over that area for a huge six. At one stage, he was probably the best allrounder in the world, despite struggling with injuries. 

 46) Dilip Vengsarkar (India) 

Test matches: 116 

Runs: 6,868 at 42.13 

The India side were starting to change in my early days with Australia, but Vengsarkar remained a very stylish, elegant batsman. In our dressing-room, he was held in the highest regard by those who saw him at his best in the Eighties. Ive taken into account his record all over the world, including three hundreds at Lords. 

 45) Waqar Younis (Pakistan) 

Test matches: 87 

Runs: 1,010 at 10.20 

Wickets: 373 at 23.56 

People may be surprised that Waqar doesnt figure higher. His stats are excellent, but I always thought that he fed off Wasim Akram at the other end. Having said that, he was a fine one-day bowler with a devastating, fast yorker at the death. The pair of them formed a great new-ball partnership through the Nineties. 

 44) Alec Stewart (England) 

Test matches: 133 

Runs: 8,483 at 39.54 

Catches: 263 

Stumpings: 14 

He did not have a great record against Australia, but I always admired Alec for his versatility. Over his career, he had to adjust from being a batsman to a batsman-keeper, then play as an opener, No. 3 or in the middle order. From what I can gather, his preparation was always spot on. 

 43) Michael Atherton (England) 

Test matches: 115 

Runs: 7,728 at 37.69 

In a funny way I enjoyed watching him bat because he was one of the old school who just liked to grind down the opposition. At times, he held England together when they were going through a rough period. His concentration was incredible and I always enjoyed talking cricket with him. He has a good understanding of the game. 

 42) Ravi Shastri (India) 

Test matches: 80 

Runs: 3,830 at 35.79 

Wickets: 151 at 40.96. 

Test cricket seemed impossibly hard when Ravi was belting a double hundred on my debut for Australia. By the time I had him caught at deep cover, which tells its own story I didnt know where my second game would come from. He was a very effective player and a handy spin bowler for a captain to have up his sleeve. 

 41) Justin Langer (Australia) 

Test matches: 105 

Runs: 7,696 at 45.27 

So many people wrote him off and there were more talented batsmen who did not play as often for Australia. But you need more than talent to succeed and Alfie worked his guts out to become the best player he could be. By the end, he had scored 23 Test hundreds and became an inspiration to youngsters everywhere.

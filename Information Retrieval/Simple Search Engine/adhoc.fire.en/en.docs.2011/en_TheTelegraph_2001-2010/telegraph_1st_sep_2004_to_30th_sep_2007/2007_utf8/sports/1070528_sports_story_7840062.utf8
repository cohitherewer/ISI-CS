 Atwal up to tied 22nd

Mitchville: Arjun Atwal carded a four-under 68 in the third round to be tied 22nd in the Melwood Prince Georges Country Open on the US Nationwide Tour here. 

Atwal, who has been trying to get back a full card on the PGA Tour, is now seven-under for the tournament with one round to go. 

Atwals biggest gain this week has been his return to putting form. He is the tournament leader with an average of 26 per round. 

Leading the field was a pack of three South African Jaco van Zyl (68), Patrick Sheehan (68) and Paul Claxton (67) at 13-under.

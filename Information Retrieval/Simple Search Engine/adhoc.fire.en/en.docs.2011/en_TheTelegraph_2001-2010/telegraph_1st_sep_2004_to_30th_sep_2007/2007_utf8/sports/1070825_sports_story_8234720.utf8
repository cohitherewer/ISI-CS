 Ghei slips to tied 7th

Johor Bahru: Gaurav Ghei dropped to tied seventh at two-under, thanks to back-to-back bogeys in fading light at the rain-hit $300,000 Iskandar Johor Open here on Friday. 

Ghei, who shared the lead at four-under after 10 holes in second round, dropped to tied seventh, following bogeys on 11th and 12th holes before play was stopped for the day. 

Ghei now has six more holes to play in second round, which will resume on Saturday. (PTI)

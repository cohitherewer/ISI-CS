 Top-30 spot awaits Sania

 - Indian loses to Sharapova; Chakvetadze ousts Venus 

San Diego: Anna Chakvetadze maintained her good run of form on the US hard courts when she staved off a match point before stunning Wimbledon champion Venus Williams 6-7, 7-6, 6-2 in the quarter finals of the San Diego Classic on Friday. 

The third seeded Russian will meet defending champion Maria Sharapova for a place in the final after the top seed demolished Indias Sania Mirza 6-2, 6-1 in 61 minutes (as reported in Saturdays Late City edition). 

Swiss 11th seed Patty Schnyder also advanced with an impressive 6-4, 6-4 victory over fourth seed Nadia Petrova to set up a match against another Russian, Elena Dementieva, who overcame compatriot Maria Kirilenko 6-2 6-4. 

Sania came into the match loaded with confidence after reaching the final of the Stanford Classic last week and having beaten eighth seed Dinara Safina in the previous round here. But she had trouble returning Sharapovas serves and watched the Russian tear apart her second serve. 

Sharapova was in control for the entire match, with Sania winning only 40 percent of her service points. 

I stepped inside the court and played my game, Sharapova said. I wanted to make sure I stepped in and hit it. The two most important things were my serves and returns because shes pretty solid from the baseline. 

Sharapova began the match by winning eight of the first nine points to take a 2-0 lead. She lost only five in the next three games as she increased her lead to 5-1 before wrapping up the opener in just 29 minutes. 

The second set followed a similar script with Sharapova breaking Sania at love. The Indian made matters worse for herself as she threw away the third game by committing two double faults. 

Sania did manage to break Sharapova in the fourth game but the Russian broke back to sweep the final three games and seal the match. 

I had a good start and was able to play my game. The two keys were serve and return. Sania is a solid player so its good to get some matches like Ive won this week behind my back, Sharapova said. 

Playing in her first tournament since falling to Williams in the fourth round of Wimbledon, defending champion Sharapova seems to have regained her stride and has lost only 10 games in her last three matches. The former world No. 1 has yet to win a title this year, but thinks her confidence may be returning. 

Ill take these matches rather than 7-6 in the third, she said. No matter how confident you are, you have to live in reality. I dont know where confidence comes from, but its good to get these matches behind me and know Im playing consistently and serving better. 

Sania is set to gain 110 points from her exploits at the $1.3m WTA Tier I event to break into worlds top-30 players for the first time when the rankings are announced on Monday. 

 In notching her 12th straight 

 victory on US soil, Chakvetadze wore Williams down from 

 the baseline, sticking to a strategy of moving her opponent 

 around and hitting behind her.

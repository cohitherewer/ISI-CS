 Every match a final for us now, says Lara

Georgetown: West Indies captain Brian Lara said every match for his team now would be like a final. 

The World Cup hosts have already lost their first two Super Eight matches against champions Australia and Stephen Flemings New Zealand. 

A third loss may not necessarily eliminate them from the competition as they did bring two points through from the group stage. But defeat against Sri Lanka on Sunday would make their task considerably more difficult and would certainly demand victories in their remaining matches against Bangladesh, South Africa and England. Its going to be a huge game because Sri Lanka are playing very good cricket they had a hiccup against South Africa but showed fight right to the end, Lara said at the Providence Stadium. 

The guys understand the position we are in at present having lost against New Zealand and Australia. This match is of utmost importance and we have to put our hands up and be counted. 

Weve never had the attitude that because we have six games we can afford to lose one or two. We try to win every game. Its important to have the mindset where we go out there and play each game like its a final. 

The teams biggest issue is finding runs from a talented line-up that is yet to fire in the World Cup. 

Laras position in the batting order has been the subject of debate and he said that would be discussed in the team meeting. 

Sri Lanka won all their three group matches, including the victory that sealed Indias elimination. 

However, they lost their first Super Eight game against South Africa despite Lasith Malingas late burst of four wickets in four balls. 

Therefore, they too would see this match as a must-win game and would not want to start their Super Eight campaign with two losses. 

Im not sure what the morale is like in the West Indies camp, but if its down, well try to take advantage of it, coach Tom Moody said. Its a big game for them but its equally as big for us. 

Were going in there all guns blazing hoping to play our game and get another two points on the board. 

Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene sees the West Indies position as double-edged. They havent been in the best form leading up to this game, but they will be hungry for a win as well, he said. They will probably feel a bit more pressure because the advantage probably lies with them. For us, its just another game. 

There are two points on offer, and we want to make sure we give 100 per cent and play the brand of cricket were used to playing, Jayawardene said. 

Jayawardene said the defeat against South Africa had not dented his teams confidence and their resolve to perform well. We always knew that we were a very competitive side, and that we dont give up easily he said. 

 But we also knew these Super Eight games would be tough. quot; 

The Sri Lankans, Jayawardene said, were not taking too much notice of the big picture at this stage. Were looking at one game at a time, he said. Every game offers us two points, but I dont know how many would be enough to get into the semi-finals.

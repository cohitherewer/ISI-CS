 AUSTRALIA-IRELAND HIGHLIGHTS

 When Irish openers JP Bray and WTS Porterfield were both dismissed for one run each, they provided a statistical oddity. Only once before in ODI cricket history, both the openers were dismissed for a single run! The only other instance was when when Aussies RB McCosker and IC Davis were dismissed in an identical score of one against England at Manchester on June 2, 1977. 

 Irelands 91 was their lowest ever from 15 ODI matches. Their previous lowest was 134 against New Zealand in Georgetown four days ago. 

 This was the 14th time Australia were dismissing a side for sub-100 total. Incidentally, Irelands total was the 10th lowest by any team against the Aussies. 

 Ireland, in fact becomes the only fourth team to be dismissed for less than 100 in any ODIs played in the Caribbean. The full list: 

 75 (28.5 ovs) Canada vs Zimbabwe (Port of Spain) May 16, 2006

 78 (24.4 ovs) Bermuda vs Sri Lanka (Port of Spain) March 15, 2007

 91 (30.0 ovs) Ireland v Australia (Bridgetown) April 13, 2007

 99 (19.1 ovs) Zimbabwe vs Pakistan (Kingston) March 21, 2007

 The previous lowest total in Bridgetown was 114 (in 39 ovs) by England against hosts the West Indies on March 19, 1986. 

 With 18 wickets in seven matches, Glenn McGrath is now the leading wicket-taker in this edition of the World Cup. He also extended his World Cup tally to 63 wickets in 35 matches. 

 Mike Husseys unbeaten 30 was his best score in the last eight matches. Since his 105 in 84 balls against New Zealand at Auckland on February 18 earlier this year, he has aggregated just 33 runs in five innings, averaging 6.60 runs per innings. 

 Husseys six provided the eighth instance of a batsman winning a match with the help of a six in this World Cup. Another Australian have done this before when Matthew Hayden did so against Bangladesh at St Peters in Antigua. 

 The win was Ricky Pontings 18th World Cup victory as captain in as many matches, as Australia extend their unbeaten run in the World Cup to 25 matches. 

 Australias victory in just 12.2 overs was also the fourth quickest in a World Cup by a team batting second. The following are the top five: 

Cananda (36) lost to Sri Lanka (37/1; 4.4 overs) in Paarl, February 19, 2003 

Scotland (68) lost to West Indies (70/2; 10.1ovs) in Leicester, May 27, 1999 

Bangladesh (108) lost to South Africa (109-0; 12 ovs) in Bloemfontein February 22, 2003 

Ireland (91) lost to Australia (92/1; 12.2ovs) in Bridgetown, April 13, 2007 

Canada (45) lost to England (46/2; 13.5ovs) in Manchester, June 14, 1979

New Delhi: Defender Deepak Mondal, who suffered an injury on his left knee in the match against Bangladesh, has been ruled out for the rest of the Nehru Cup. 

According to All India Football Federation sources, Mondal may be treated by Dr Anant Joshi in Mumbai. He may be flown to Mumbai on Thursday, added the source. 

Though none in the Indian camp are too sure about the nature and gravity of Mondals injury, there is apprehension in some quarters that the Mohun Bagan defender might not be fit to play in the next months Federation Cup in Ludhiana, too. 

Mondal had undergone an MRI scan in Delhi, federation sources said. It has detected a muscle tear. We have decided not to take any risk and send him to Mumbai immediately. 

If necessary, the AIFF official said, Mondal may be operated upon in Mumbai. 

Deepaks exclusion from the Nehru Cup squad is certainly a blow for the Indian team as the seasoned stopper back is considered a backbone of Indian defence. Gourmangi Singh is expected to replace him in the match against Syria on Thursday.

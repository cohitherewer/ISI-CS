 ICC rejects appeal 

 - Gibbs to miss a Test, Twenty20 and one ODI 

A STAFF REPORTER 

 Gibbs 

Calcutta: Herschelle Gibbs will miss one Test Match, one Twenty20 International and one ODI following the decision Thursday by ICC Code of Conduct Commissioner Richie Benaud to reject his appeal against a ban imposed by Match Referee Chris Broad. 

The decision means that Gibbs will not be eligible for his sides third Test against Pakistan starting in Cape Town on Friday, according to a release. The original sanction was a ban of two Tests but the Code specifies that the ban should apply to the next matches in which the player is scheduled to play. 

In Gibbs case the ban therefore becomes one ruling him out of one Test, one Twenty20 international and one ODI as those are the next fixtures for South Africa. 

Benauds decision follows a teleconference on Wednesday involving the player, his legal representative, Broad, a legal representative acting on his behalf and ICC in-house lawyer Urvasi Naidoo, who was present on the call in an administrative capacity. 

In rejecting the appeal, Benaud wrote: It was put to me that the fact the remarks in question were heard through stump microphones on the ground should invalidate the whole matter. 

(This is) because of ICCs memo of 12 April 2006, which pointed out that there had been some problems with stump microphones not being switched off at the right times. 

That though is ICC policy rather than a Law or Playing Condition of the game and Chris Broad, in his decision, gave Herschelle Gibbs full mitigation for the fact that the stump microphones had been left on by the television network. 

With the benefit of some experience I am able to add that players, no matter where they may be, should always bear in mind that a microphone could be live. 

That does not just apply to stump microphones used by television networks, but it could be in a radio studio or in a press conference with the print media. There is no malice about it, but it could happen just because someone has not pushed a button or pulled a switch. 

It is precisely the same in the television commentary box for a television commentator. If you do not use the words, they do not get to air. 

Despite rejecting the appeal, Benaud was explicit in his view that it did not mean Gibbs was a racist. 

At Chris Broads hearing (Pakistan team manager) Talat Ali spoke about the offence the words used by Herschelle would give to the whole Pakistan nation. I am not surprised. 

(However), as an Appeals Commissioner and a person, I certainly do not consider Herschelle to be a racist and I take great exception to the suggestion, in the same way I believe Chris Broad would object (to suggestions his finding would do the same). 

In his judgment, Mr Benaud expressed surprise the South Africa players did not draw the attention of match officials to the abuse they were receiving from sections of the crowd.

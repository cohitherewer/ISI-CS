 Jeev makes the cut in Augusta

Augusta: Indias Jeev Milkha Singh made the cut at the US Masters on Friday. 

The 35-year-old braved chilly conditions in the morning to card a three over 75 for an aggregate of three-over 147, five shots off the lead. 

That put him at tied 15 with nine others, including world No. 1 Tiger Woods, who shot a two over 74. 

My course management was the key. I kept telling myself to be patient and that paid off. Though I enjoy playing in the cold, I had to use warmers in my pocket for the first few holes, said Jeev. 

He started with a bogey and had two more bogeys and two birdies on the front nine for a 37. He dropped shots on the tenth, 14th and 16th at which point he was four-over. 

Jeev found himself facing a difficult shot out of the bunker on the par-four 17th. He played an intelligent shot above the hole and then rolled in a tough 12-footer for par. 

Buoyed, he bombed his driver down the fairway on the 18th and followed up with a nine-iron to come within 12 feet for a closing birdie, which he nailed. 

That sure was big. Those two putts and earlier two fine chips on eighth and 12th were the shots that really set me up for a good day, said Jeev. 

I expected to be better, but I will take this. I am in the action for the weekend and I hope to do better. It has been great so far, now I need to improve on this, he said.Jeev is now three out of three in terms of making the cut at the majors. His earlier cuts came at the US Opens in 2002 and 2006. 

South African Tim Clark, runner-up last year, shot a one-under-par 71 and American Brett Wetterich posted a 73 to tie for the lead at two-under 142, one better than Vaughn Taylor (72). 

Vijai Singh of Fiji, the 2000 champion, shot 71 for an even-par 144. That total was matched by Americans Zach Johnson (73) and Jerry Kelly (69), and Briton Justin Rose who bogeyed the last for 75. 

For a while four-time winner Woods looked in danger of missing the cut. I turned a 90 into a 74 today, he said. Woods sprayed the ball to all parts of Augusta National and was involved in an extraordinary incident on the 13th tee. 

The 31-year-old was forced to abort his downswing after being put off by a bird in flight. A bird flew right over me and I stopped my swing somehow, said Woods. I felt like I broke my back, my neck, my arm. I dont know how baseball players can check their swings. 

Woods escaped a penalty, as he had made no attempt to strike the ball. 

Holder Phil Mickelson, who slumped to seven-over after a bogey at the 11th, came back with two birdies for a 73 that left him five-over, seven shots behind the leaders. 

Six players were knotted at one over par, including US Open champion Geoff Ogilvy, who returned a 70, and Irishman Padraig Harrington, who shot 68 to tie the lowest round of the day.The cut was set at eight-over-par 152, with 60 qualifying. Among players failing to qualify were Sergio Garcia (154), Colin Montgomerie (153), and Ernie Els (154), who snapped his string of making 27 consecutive cuts in majors. (AGENCIES)

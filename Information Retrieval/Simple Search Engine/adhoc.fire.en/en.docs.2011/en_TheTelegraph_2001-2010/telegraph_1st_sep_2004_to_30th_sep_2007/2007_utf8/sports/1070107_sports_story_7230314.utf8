 Sporting aim for full points

Panaji: Sporting Clube de Goa will be looking for a positive start when they take on Churchill Brothers in their opening NFL tie on Sunday at Duler Ground, Mapusa, north Goa. 

Sporting, who have begin the season well winning the Goa Professional League, a semi-final berth in Durand Cup and the IFA Shield, as also a finals appearance at the Federation Cup are a strong contender for the NFL title. 

Their experience, skill and record give them an edge over their rivals. 

Main goal-getter Dudu will lead from the front, assisted by Nicolau Borges or Joe Rodrigues in place of Nigerian Jeremiah who is a doubtful starter. 

Churchill brothers, back in the NFL after a one-year gap, would be looking to make an impact too.

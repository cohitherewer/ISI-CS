 ICC rejects Fica survey

 Dubai: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has dismissed the Federation of International Cricketers Associations (Fica) claim that the governing body was unpopular with players, saying a sample survey could not provide a real picture. 

A Fica poll, conducted on 45 cricketers from the nine Test-playing nations, revealed that 56 per cent of players were not satisfied with ICCs governance and its ability to conduct big events like recent World Cup. 

But ICC spokesman said Fica only represented players from five full member countries and none of the associates. 

Given that 240 players, plus replacements, took part in the event it would be interesting to know how many of them were polled to produce this result, he was quoted as saying by a website. 

Does the survey take any account of the fact that players attitudes to the game, its administrators and the tournament are almost certainly bound to be affected by their own and their teams performance at the World Cup? 

...Thanks to the way the game is being administered the players were able to share in a prize pool of $5 million, including $2.24 million for the winners, he said. 

The spokesman also said Fica should have informed the ICC about its findings to work through any potential issues. 

It is interesting that Tim (May) chose to release the findings of his survey to the media but, despite the fact it is critical of the ICC, he chose to not to share the information with the organisation. Or even provide a right of reply before that release, something that would have allowed the two groups to work through any potential issues he or his members may have in a sensible and reasoned way, he said. 

But Fica chief executive May said the ICC had been informed prior to the release and that Dave Richardson, the ICCs general manager cricket, had been sent all questions and replies, according to the website. 

May also said the prize money relates to about 2 per cent of total revenue produced. The ICC should not be deluded that their performance by others is only going to be judged by reference to commercial considerations. Administration is far more than the dollar value of contracts that you sign. It involves decisions.

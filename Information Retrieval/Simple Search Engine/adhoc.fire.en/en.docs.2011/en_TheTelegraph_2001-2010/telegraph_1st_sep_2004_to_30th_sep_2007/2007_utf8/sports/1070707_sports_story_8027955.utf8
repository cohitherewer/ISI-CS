 Paes-Damm goes down fighting

London: Leander Paes and Martin Damm made their exit from Wimbledon Grand Slam mens doubles after a hard-fought loss to fourth seeds Fabrice Santoro and Nenad Zimonjic in the quarter finals here on Friday. 

The fifth seeded Indo-Czech pair bounced back from a first set loss in a tie-break but Santoro and Zimonjic proved a tough nut to crack and won the near three-hour battle 7-6 (6), 6-7 (5), 6-4, 6-3. 

Little separated the two teams but Frenchman Santoro and Zimonjic of Serbia, who paired with Paes a couple of seasons ago, had a better breakpoint conversion percentage, winning four out of seven against two out of four by their rivals. 

The winners also played the crucial points better as they won a total of 142 points while the Paes and Damm, the reigning US Open champions won 129.

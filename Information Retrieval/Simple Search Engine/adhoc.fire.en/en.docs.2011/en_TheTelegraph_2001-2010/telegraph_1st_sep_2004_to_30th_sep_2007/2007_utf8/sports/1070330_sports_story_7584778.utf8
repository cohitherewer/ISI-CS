 I was unaware of the record: Malinga

 Sri Lanka fast bowler Lasith Malinga 

 was unaware he had become the first man in international 

 cricket to take four wickets in four balls, against South 

 Africa in the World Cup Super Eight on Wednesday. 

His heroics, which have never happened before in international one-day or Test cricket, nearly robbed South Africa of victory but Graeme Smiths men clung on for a one-wicket win having earlier been cruising. 

I didnt know if anyone else had taken four, Malinga told a news conference. I know now I was the first person and Im very happy. But my team lost the game. 

Malinga became the fifth bowler after Chetan Sharma, Saqlain Mushtaq, Chaminda Vaas and Brett Lee to take a hattrick in World Cup. 

Malinga, who sports large bouncy hair with blonde streaks, dismissed Shaun Pollock, Andrew Hall, Jacques Kallis and Makhaya Ntini but South Africa reached their modest target with 10 balls to spare after Sri Lanka had been bowled out for 209. 

My first spell was no good, he said. With the last spell I took wickets but that was not enough to win the game. The best ball was Pollock. My slower ball. 

Umpire Daryl Harper later said Malingas deliveries were like Exocet missiles. Malinga took it in his stride. 

It was a good opportunity to win the game we needed only one more wicket, the 23-year-old right-arm paceman said. I bowled the next ball to take a wicket unfortunately, I couldnt do it. 

Malinga, whose low, slingy action has courted controversy, was eventually made joint Man of the Match with five-wicket South African Charl Langeveldt after an initial mix-up where only Langeveldt was named. 

The International Cricket Council said it had apologised to the Sri Lankan team. 

Team captain Mahela Jayawardene hailed his bowler but was disappointed with the result. 

We never had a chance in this game, he created it, Jayawardene said. He can be a handful for the lower middle order and tailenders. I can use him at any stage, he is always good to go. 

But we didnt deserve to win this game the way we batted. 

South African captain Smith refused to blame his lower order for almost throwing away the match and instead praised Malinga. 

Youve got to give Malinga some credit, he is an awkward bowler. He just ran in and gave it his all, Smith said. 

Malingas action caused consternation in New Zealand in 2005 when the home team asked umpires to change their trousers and push their ties over their shoulders to help spot the ball. 

Hailing from the southern coastal town of Galle, Malinga grew up swimming and climbing coconut trees, not picking up a cricket ball until he was 17. 

He soon became one of the quickest bowlers in Sri Lanka. 

On his Test debut in Australia in 2004, he removed Darren Lehmann and Adam Gilchrist in one over, taking six wickets in the match. 

His one-day prowess came to the fore in England last year after he grabbed 13 wickets to help sweep the series 5-0. 

He has taken 71 wickets in 21 Tests. 

With his action and the pace he generates, he is always asking questions, Jayawardene said. 

Malinga could be the one to answer the prayers of the 1996 champions, especially after his sensational display against South Africa.

 Rosberg hospitalised, but not serious

Madrid: Germanys Nico Rosberg was hospitalised on Wednesday following a crash in private testing in Barcelona, though his Williams team said he had emerged unscathed. 

Rosberg, the son of former world champion Keke and ninth in the new season standings, wrecked the side and front of his FW29 car after the crash at turn 10 which came barely 36 hours after the teams test driver Kazuki Nakajima damaged his chassis in a shunt. 

A Williams spokesman confirmed Rosberg, who began his season with a seventh-place in Australia for his only points to date, was not hurt.

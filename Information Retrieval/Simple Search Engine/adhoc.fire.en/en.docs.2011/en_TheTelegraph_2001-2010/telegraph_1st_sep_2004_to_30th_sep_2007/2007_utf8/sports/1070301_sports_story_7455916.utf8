 We will be extremely hard to beat: Ponting

Sydney: Australia captain Ricky Ponting warned Wednesday that despite some recent poor form the world champions will be extremely hard to beat at the upcoming cricket World Cup. 

Speaking at Sydney airport as the team flew out to the Caribbean in search of a third straight World Cup victory, Ponting said he believed his team deserved to remain favourites. 

Theres been a bit of negativity around the team over the last couple of weeks, but I guess thats to be expected when youre not playing your absolute best and we certainly havent done that, Ponting said. 

The Australians go into the competition after suffering five straight one-day defeats. But Ponting pointed out that the 3-0 whitewash by New Zealand was achieved against a team weakened by injury. 

Weve had up to six or seven of our top 11 players out as well, which probably hasnt been reported that much over the last couple of weeks, he said. Im not that fussed at the moment that were going in having lost our last five games. 

That should be able to bring the best out in the players and this team generally lifts itself when theres some big games on the line, and it doesnt get any bigger than a World Cup, Ponting said. (AFP)

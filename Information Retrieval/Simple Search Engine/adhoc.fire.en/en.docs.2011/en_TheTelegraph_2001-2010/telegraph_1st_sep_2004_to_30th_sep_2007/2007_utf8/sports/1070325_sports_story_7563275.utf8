 France stay on course 

London: Late winning goals kept France and Scotland neck and neck at the top of Euro 2008 qualifying Group B Saturday. 

Both teams stayed on course for next years finals with Nicolas Anelka grabbing Frances winner against Lithuania in Kaunas 16 minutes from time when he scored the only goal of the game with a low shot from just outside the box. 

Scotland left it even later, beating Georgia 2-1 in Glasgow with Craig Beattie scoring their winner a minute from time. Ireland improved their chances in Group D with a 1-0 win over Wales. (Reuters)

 I just cant sit and relax: Sreesanth

 Sreesanth 

Kochi: Indias new pace sensation Sreesanth says he wants to use his performance in South Africa as a stepping stone for achieving greater success in the forthcoming series. I cannot sit back on laurels. I cannot sit back and relax. I have to work with the same intensity and even more. I am still learning, Sreesanth said after arriving here from South Africa on Monday. 

My dream was to capture 25 wickets in the series. I thank god that I could get 18 wickets and equal Anil Kumble and Srinaths record (in South Africa). They are the legends in Indian cricket and to hold the record along with them is a great feeling, he said. 

 He also said the presence of Sourav Ganguly in the team helped the players. He (Sourav) performed exceptionally well especially in tough situations. He is a mature player and performed well. He played a big role, Sreesanth said. 

About his impromptu dance after belting fast bowler Andre Nel for a six in the first Test in Johannesburg, Sreesanth said: it just happened. I myself wondered when I saw it (later on television). My brother and friends had e-mailed me about it. 

Recalling the incident, Sreesanth said: as soon as I walked in to bat, Nel said I can smell blood. You do not have the guts. showing his emblem on the shirt, Nel said I am playing for this. You are a scared fellow, rabbit. I will get you next ball. 

Before delivering the next ball, Nel had also asked wicketkeeper Mark Boucher to stay back and had also moved the short-leg fielder. I being a fast bowler myself, knew Nel was going to bowl a bouncer. I just took my chance and prayed to god. I stepped out to connect the ball which flew over the ropes, Sreesanth said. 

The 23-year-old bowler said he was very lucky to get some valuable tips from great fast bowlers like Pakistans Wasim Akram and South African Allan Donald during the tour. 

Sreesanth said he had a session with Akram, who had advised him on how to use the reverse swing. Akram has told me some small points. It was really helpful. It was nice of him. 

Sharing an interesting coincidence, Sreesanth said: this year on January 1, I had a session with Akram while on last year the same day I had a session with another Pakistan fast bowler Waqar Younis in Kochi. 

The seamer said he had also spoken to former India captains Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Sashtri and the West Indies Paceman Ian Bishop and gained valuable tips from them. 

Sreesanth said the forthcoming one-day series against the West Indies and Sri Lanka before the World Cup would be challenging assignments. 

With players of the calibre of Sanath Jayasurya and Brian Lara as opponents, it is going to be tough, he said. 

Sreesanth said he was optimistic of Indias chances in the World Cup this year. (PTI)

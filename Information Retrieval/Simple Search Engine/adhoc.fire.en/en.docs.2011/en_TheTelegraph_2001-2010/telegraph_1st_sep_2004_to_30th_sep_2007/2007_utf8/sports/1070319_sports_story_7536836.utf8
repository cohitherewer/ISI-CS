 Hodge hits 1st ODI century

Basseterre: Middle-order batsman Brad Hodge struck his maiden ODI hundred as Australia pulverised The Netherlands to post 358 for five in the group A game Sunday. 

Hodge led the Aussie onslaught with a hurricane 123 off 89 balls and was well supported by Michael Clarke who carved out a stylish yet aggressive 93 not out at the Warner Park. Hodge, 32, smashed eight fours and seven sixes during his 184-run partnership with Clarke. 

After Hodge fell in the 48th over, Clarke took on the baton to whack two sixes off the last over that cost the Dutch 24 runs. Clarke moved from 80 to 93 from the last three balls he played against Peter Borren, whom he hit over the midwicket fence twice and then scampered for a single. 

The last 10 overs produced 130 runs and there were 13 sixes in the innings.

 Bhupathi-Vizner beats Team Paes

New Delhi: Mahesh Bhupathi and his Czech partner Pavel Vizner upstaged fourth seeds Leander Paes and Martin Damm to set up a semi-final clash with top seeds Bob and Mike Bryan in the $2.2m Rogers Cup in Montreal. 

Bhupathi and Vizner, seeded eighth, beat Paes and Damm 7-6 (7), 2-6, 10-8. Paes and Damm were playing their first match in the hardcourt tournament after getting a bye in the first round and a walkover in the second. 

In the opening set, both teams held serve. Paes and Damm did well to save as many as seven break points but Bhupathi and Vizner won the set in the tie-breaker. 

The fourth-seeded Indo-Czech duo, however, stormed back into the match in the second set, breaking their opponents twice in the process. 

But Bhupathi and Vizner recovered from the jolt and held their nerves to seal the issue in a close super tie-breaker. The eighth seeds now have a tough match ahead against the Bryan brothers, who defeated the French pair of Arnaud Clement and Richard Gasquet 6-2 7-6 (3) in their quarter final.

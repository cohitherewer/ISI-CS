 Ponting, Pietersen in verbal duel

 Ricky Ponting and Kevin Pietersen 

Melbourne: Ricky Ponting and Kevin Pietersen were engaged in a war of words during Sundays Super Eight battle between the Ashes rivals, according to media reports here. 

Things became hotter as the teams struggled to deal with the pressures of a key World Cup game which eventually saw Australia winning by seven wickets in St Johns. 

Pietersens first duel with Ponting was when the maverick England batsman, who struck a rather sedate century, continued with his tactic of charging Glenn McGrath 

Pietersen came dancing down the track to slap McGrath to the midwicket boundary and again charged down attempting a pull in the 12th over. 

The audacious shots irked Ponting and the pair was spotted arguing mid-pitch. 

The duel continued even when the batsman stood waiting for the next over to begin at the non-strikers end, an Australian paper reported. 

Ponting was further exasperated when he grassed a difficult one-handed chance at midwicket off Pietersen when the batsman had just reached 50. 

Pietersen got another life on 63 when Matthew Hayden, running around from mid-off, dropped an easy catch to allow the batsman make his maiden ODI century against Australia, and his first in the World Cup. 

Ponting later praised Pietersens knock albeit grudgingly. He played a different innings today (Sunday) and at various times didnt get the support he needed. But I was still a little surprised he did not step things up a bit earlier, Ponting said. 

He might have been a bit physically tired, but is a very good player in both forms of the game, he added. 

Tension mounted again when Andrew Symonds blasted a Paul Collingwood delivery to deep midwicket and was caught by Pietersen, who could not balance himself and trod on the boundary rope. 

Umpires Rudi Koertzen and Billy Bowden allowed the batsman to stay and though England fielders were evidently unhappy with the judgement, skipper Michael Vaughan later called it a fair decision. 

It was a difficult one, but to be honest, he had no control of his waist, Vaughan said.

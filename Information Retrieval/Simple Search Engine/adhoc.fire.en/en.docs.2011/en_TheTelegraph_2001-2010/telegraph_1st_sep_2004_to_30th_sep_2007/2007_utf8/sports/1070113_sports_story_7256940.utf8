 Ranadeb misses out to Ishant

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Even as Sourav Ganguly hogged the limelight at the Eden on Friday, there was disappointment and anger at Ranadeb Bose not finding a place among the probables. 

It is learnt that Ranadebs name was discussed at the selection committee meeting, but he lost out to Ishant Sharma. It may be recalled that the Delhi mediumpacer had been at the centre of a drama after Irfan Pathan was sent home during the tour of South Africa. 

The flip-flop on Sharma during the second Test in Durban had left egg on many faces. Obviously, after having made a commitment once, it was awkward for Vengsarkar to not pick him among the probables. 

Its also strange that despite being second in the list of highest wicket-takers among Ranji Trophy bowlers, he remains ignored while left-arm spinner Rajesh Pawar (third in the list) has got the nod. 

Sourav felt Ranadeb shouldnt lose heart. He is going through a good phase and should keep up the good work, the former India captain said.

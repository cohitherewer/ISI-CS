 Pawar in no-show of season

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sharad Pawar 

Mumbai: In what will rank as an embarrassing no-show of the season, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Sharad Pawar didnt turn up to address the Rahul Dravids before Team Indias departure for the World Cup. 

Pawar was expected at the BCCI HQ by 6.00 pm on Tuesday, but his flight from New Delhi got delayed and, so, the West Indies-bound cricketers didnt have the benefit of his tips. The president, in fact, didnt even take a later flight and wont be able to come on Wednesday either as that is B-Day. 

Once the budget has been presented, Pawar is going to ready himself for an International Cricket Council-related trip to Cape Town. 

In his absence, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah and chief administrative officer Prof. Ratnakar Shetty spoke to the cricketers and the support staff. Prof. Shetty made a power-point presentation on the travel plans and the guidelines issued by the world body. 

Mr Pawar will meet everybody in a months time when he visits the West Indies, Prof.

 Shetty told The Telegraph. Dravid and Co. leave in the very early hours of Thursday, on board a British Airways flight to London before taking an Air Jamaica service from there to Kingston.

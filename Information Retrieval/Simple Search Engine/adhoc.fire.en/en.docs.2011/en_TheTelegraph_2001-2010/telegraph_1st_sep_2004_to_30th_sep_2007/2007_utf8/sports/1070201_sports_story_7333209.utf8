 Boycott praise for Sourav

Mumbai: Geoffrey Boycott on Wednesday spoke highly of Sourav Gangulys strong character and his prowess in captaincy. 

I am very happy that Sourav is back in the team. He is the best captain India had for a long time and is mentally very tough, Boycott said here on Wednesday. 

Asked about Indias World Cup chances, the former England captain said the Indian team needs to improve in certain areas. The Indians have a bit of work to do if they have to win the World Cup, said Boycott who conducted a master class in batting earlier in the day for the trainees of the Cricket Star Academy. 

The Yorkshireman picked reigning champions Australia as the team to win the premier event. Australia will be the favourites, certainly not England, Boycott added. (PTI)

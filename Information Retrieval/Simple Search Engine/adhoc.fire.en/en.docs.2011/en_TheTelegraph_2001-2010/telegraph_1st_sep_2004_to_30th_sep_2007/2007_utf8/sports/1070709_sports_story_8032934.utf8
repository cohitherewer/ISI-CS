 Prasun to select candidates

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The CAB president Prasun Mukherjee has been empowered to decide on the ruling groups candidates if there is an election on AGM day (July 28). 

The buzz in the Maidan is that the ruling group may work out a compromise formula. The one-and-half-hour meeting at the city police commissioners residence was attended by some 50 members. No CAB office bearer was present. 

According to a source, Aryan Club representative Samar Paul has emerged the front-runner for one joint secretarys post. As of now, it seems the ruling group may offer the second joint secretarys slot to the opposition. Few, though, want a new face in that chair. 

We dont want anyone who has already been in the chair to contest, a member of the Mukherjee group said. 

Former Bengal batsman Snehasish Ganguly is unlikely to contest. Indranath Dey could fight for the vice-presidents post, while Tushar Sarkar may contest for the treasurers post. 

It is learnt that the names will be announced after the court verdict on former president Jagmohan Dalmiya.

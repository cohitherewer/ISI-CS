 Johl makes cut, Gangjee misses out

Seoul: Amandeep Johl ensured an Indian presence over the weekend at the Maekyung Open as he made the cut with a one-under 71, even as Rahil Gangjee fell by the wayside with a six-over 78 in the second round on Friday. 

Johl slotted five birdies against four bogeys, placing him tied 50th with a two-day total of three-over 147. Gangjee, however, bowed out with a total of 155. 

Johl started well, sinking in a first-hole birdie but failed to build on it as he blew away the chance for a better finish with back-to-back bogeys on the last two holes. 

Chinas Liang Wen-Chong battled to a one-under 71 to retain his overnight lead at the halfway stage. Liang is chased by 20-year-old Korean Kim Kyung-Tae. Kyung-Tae moved into contention with a 66 to lie a shot behind Liang. (PTI)

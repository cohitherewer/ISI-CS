Guwahati: Indian women made it a 1-2-3 in long jump in the VI Asian Athletics Grand Prix, second leg, at the newly-built Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium in Sarusajai here.

Kerala girl Chitra K. Soman won the 400m in a time of 52.94. Kazakhstans Marina Maslyonko finished second in 53.68 while Olga Tereshkova (53.81), also of Kazakhstan, came in third. Chitra said she was happy with her feat as it came against top athletes but she would have been happier had she bettered her personal best of 51.30. 

Indian women made it a 1-2 in the 1500m with Sinimol Paulose emerging best in 4:15.53, followed by Sushma in 4:20.07. Svetlana Lukasheva of Kazakhstan took the bronze in 4:20.93.

Among men, 21-year-old Renjith Maheshwari of India took gold in the mens triple jump with an effort of 17.04m, followed by Veliyen Roman (16.76m) of Kazakhstan and Li Yanxi (16.70m) of China. Maheshwari broke both the 34-year-old national record held by Mahendra Singh Gill (16.79m) and the Asian Grand Prix record of 16.92m. 

Indias Joseph Abraham was second-best in 400m hurdles. His timing of 49.52, was however an improvement of his own national record in the event. The gold went to Meng Yan of China (49.50), while Kazakhstans Meleshenko Yevgeniy took the bronze. 

In high jump, Hari Shankar Roy of India bagged bronze with a jump of 2.14m. Although his mark equalled Korean silver medallist Young-Min Kim, Roy needed an extra attempt. Sergey Zassimovich of Kazakstan won the gold with a jump of 2.18m. 

K. M. Binu (47.03) had to be content with a bronze in 400m. Wang Liangyu of China took the gold in 46.16 seconds, while Sri Lankan Amarasekara Prasanna (46.79) claimed silver.

Athletics Federation of India (AFI) secretary Lalit Bhanot announced on Saturday that the venue for the Asian Athletic Championship has been shifted to Jordan from Beirut. The shift became necessary after Beirut expressed their inability to host the meet. Bhanot said the meet will be held in July, as scheduled.

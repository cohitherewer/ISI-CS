 Akram rules out full-time role

 Wasim Akram 

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain and bowling great Wasim Akram ruled out a permanent coaching role with the national team, saying his other international commitments did not allow him the luxury of a long-term job. 

Akram, who is in Lahore these days conducting a specialised coaching camp for fast bowlers, said he did not have the stamina to sustain interest for the role of a bowling coach with the Pakistan team. 

I think I am better off doing stints like I am doing now. I would like to pass on my experience to the younger bowlers and they are plenty of good prospects in this camp as well, he said. 

Speculations have been rife that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) might offer the former Pakistan captain a permanent coaching position with the national team ever since he conducted the three-week camp. 

When you have a young team and a young captain, a coach is a must. This applies to the Pakistan team. 

A coach can help a lot with the planning and allowing players to just concentrate on their cricket, said Akram. 

He also advised fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar against rushing himself back into international cricket after being troubled with fitness problems in the last 14 months. 

Theres no doubt he is now bowling seven to eight overs at a stretch in the nets but I think he should continue this regime until his muscles are used once again to taking the load before he returns to bowl in international cricket. (PTI)

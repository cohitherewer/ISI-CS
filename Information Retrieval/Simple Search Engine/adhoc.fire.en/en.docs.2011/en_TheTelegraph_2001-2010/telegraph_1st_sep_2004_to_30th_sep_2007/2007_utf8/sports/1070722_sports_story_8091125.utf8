It was a day for curious happenings at the 136th British Open at Carnoustie, where the long lost sun made a late-day cameo and Tiger Woods hit his opening tee shot out of bounds (as reported in Saturdays Late City edition). 

Adding to the unexpected, Phil Mickelson missed his second consecutive cut at a major, and Sergio Garca began the defence of his first-round lead by nearly taking out some of the fans around the first green. 

Shanked it, Garca said of his wayward approach shot, although he shot an even-par 71 that put him at six-under-par 136 and gave him a two-shot lead over K .J. Choi. The last time I was in that position was 2003, Sun City. I got the 9-iron out, the same club I hit today, and shanked it way right. I managed to win the tournament. Its not a bad thing. 

Garca has a three-shot lead over Mike Weir (68) and Miguel ngel Jimnez (70), a four-shot lead over Jim Furyk (70) and Boo Weekley (72), and a seven-shot lead over Woods (74). Choi, a two-time PGA Tour winner this season, shot a 69. 

Even on a dry day, Carnoustie bared its teeth in the form of gusting winds and temperatures in the low 50s. 

The grind of major championship golf seemed to take its toll on the field, and even players with placid personalities lashed out. 

Henrik Stenson swiped at a tee marker in anger after a poor drive on No. 8, and Ernie Els let loose some acidic words after missing a birdie putt on No. 9. 

Normally, I keep it all in, but I thought, Maybe let me get everything out, Els said. I didnt see too many small kids, so hopefully, they all closed their ears. Nobodys made of rock out here. 

Woods, the player considered closest to granite, cracked on his first tee shot of the day, when he steered an iron shot left of the fairway and toward the Barry Burn running along the rough. A gaggle of children gave chase, but the ball was soon in the water, leaving Woods with a double bogey. 

His round included several more poor swings, including a tee shot that flared right on No. 15 and a bogey after a wayward approach shot on No. 18.

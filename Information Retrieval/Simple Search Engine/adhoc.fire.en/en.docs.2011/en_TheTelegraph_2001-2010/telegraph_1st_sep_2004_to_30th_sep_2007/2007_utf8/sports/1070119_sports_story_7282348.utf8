Melbourne: Sania Mirzas famous forehand let her down once again as she bowed out of the Australian Open womens singles with a straight-set loss in the second round here on Thursday. 

Sania, whose penchant for big winners has often landed her in trouble, went down in a deluge of misfiring forehands in a 3-6, 2-6 loss to Aiko Nakamura of Japan. 

My serve was average and my forehand wasnt working. The court felt like it was too small and I just couldnt put the ball in, said the 20-year old after the match. 

The Indian, ranked 53, was unfazed by the defeat, though. I am obviously disappointed but all players have off days, although it does hurt more because it is a Grand Slam, she said. But that is the beauty of tennis, there is always tomorrow. 

However, Sania partnering with Anabel Medina Garrigues of Spain defeated Sandra Kloesel of Germany and Aravane Rezai of France 6-1, 6-4 to advance to the second round of womens doubles event of tournament 

Sania, the first Indian to win a WTA Tour title, had a roaring success in 2005, her debut season on the seniors circuit. But in the following year she slipped from her career-high 31 to 66 at end the end of 2006. 

More than the defeats themselves, it is the way she has failed to capitalise on her strong forehand that has been the subject of debate among her fans. 

Sania, however, remained confident about her game. 

I dont think there is too much for to worry about. I am only 20 and have only been on the tour for two years. I think everyone back home will be disappointed but the fans there are always very supportive. Every match is a learning experience. 

Meanwhile, Indias Leander Paes and Martin Damm of the Czech Republic moved into the second round of the mens doubles. 

The fifth seeds and US Open champions came through a tricky opening encounter against Serbias Novak Djokovic and Janko Tipsarevic 7-6 (6), 4-6, 6-3. 

Mahesh Bhupathi and his Czech partner Radek Stepanek also advanced to the mens doubles second round after a 6-1, 6-7(4), 6-4 win over Sebastian Grosjean and Olivier Patience of France.

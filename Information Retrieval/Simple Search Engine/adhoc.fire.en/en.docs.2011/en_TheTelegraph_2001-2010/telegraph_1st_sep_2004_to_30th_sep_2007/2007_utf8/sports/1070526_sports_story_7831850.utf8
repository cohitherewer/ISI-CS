Dhaka: Wasim Jaffer said he was determined to prove himself after the team management showed faith in his abilities going into the second Test. The opener recorded a pair in the first Test in Chittagong. 

Jaffer retired hurt after making 138 on Friday. 

Keeping the bigger picture in mind, we should give someone an opportunity to try and stake a claim, the India captain had said on the eve of the Test. 

Jaffer said he drew inspiration from Dravids words. 

I was delighted that the team management was behind me. They backed me after the first Test and if their support wasnt there, I would not have been playing the game, he said after India finished Day I at 326 without loss. 

Obviously getting a pair was not a nice feeling I was determined to score big here... It sort of came from within. The teams faith in me also acted as a motivation, Jaffer explained. 

He said tips from cricket manager Ravi Shastri also helped. 

Shastri told me to go out in the middle with a positive mind and not worry about the past, he said. 

According to him, he enjoyed batting with Dinesh Karthik. 

We have been opening for the last three Tests and had a hundred partnership in Cape Town. 

We are good friends and know each other well. It helps when we bat together, the Mumbai batsman said.

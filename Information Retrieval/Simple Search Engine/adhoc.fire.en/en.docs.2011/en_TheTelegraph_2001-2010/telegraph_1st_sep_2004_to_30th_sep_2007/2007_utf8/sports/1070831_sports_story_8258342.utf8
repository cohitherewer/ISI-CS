 Becks suffers fresh injury

 David Beckham

David Beckhams American nightmare took another turn for the worse on Wednesday night when he limped away from LA Galaxys latest match with a knee injury. 

Immediate impressions as he had the joint treated on the sidelines were that he had suffered a strain, making him a major doubt for Englands two Euro 2008 qualifiers against Israel and Russia on September 8 and 12. 

The midfielder fell awkwardly in the 30th minute of the game against Pachuca when challenging Fernando Salazar. He remained face down on the grass for a few seconds before gradually getting up and hobbling to the sidelines, where he had his knee bandaged while he sat with his head in his hands. 

Beckham will undergo a scane. Maybe it is a sign to give it a rest, get it right and not come back until it is right. 

If the scan comes back tomorrow and it is not as bad as it was then you know maybe Ive got a chance to play (on Saturday, against Real Salt Lake).

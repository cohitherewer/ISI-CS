 CAB ignores NCC letter

A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: A National Cricket Club (NCC) letter, written to the Army and redirected to the CAB, kicked up a storm at state crickets headquarters two days ahead of the elections. 

The NCC, in a letter dated July 6 and signed by assistant secretary Lalit Sethi, wrote to the Army that the lease of the Eden Gardens cannot be renewed without its consent. The letter was forwarded to the CAB on July 25. 

Prasun Mukherjee responded promptly, asking all members to attend an informal meeting to apprise them of the NCC development. 

About 60 members turned up on Thursday evening and it was unanimously agreed to ignore the letter. 

It was decided that a reply will be sent to the NCC to check whether the objection raised was the assistant secretarys personal view or had the backing of all members. 

The Army owns all grounds/stadiums in the Maidan, including the Eden Gardens. The 20-year lease expired last month and the CAB has already started the process of renewal. 

The (NCC) letter is clearly motivated, said the CAB president, pointing out that it has come days before the elections and at a time the CAB was planning construction and renovation work at the Eden. 

He also took a dig at his predecessor, Jagmohan Dalmiya. When I was on the infrastructure development committee, the then president asked me to use my good offices to have the Eden lease renewed Now we get this letter. 

Dalmiya was the NCC president for a long time. 

In another development, second division club Satya Sandhi sent an advocates letter to the CAB questioning the validity of Saturdays elections. The letter points out that the invalid AGM notice, dated July 6 and signed by the two joint secretaries, had stated the annual accounts for 2007-08 would be placed. It should have read 2006-07. 

The correction was issued on July 14, but that didnt leave the mandatory 14 days gap between the date of notice and the AGM. 

The advocates letter wont be accepted by the CAB, but if the club moves court on Friday, there is a chance of the AGM being postponed.

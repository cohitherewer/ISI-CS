 Olympic berth for Samresh

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Samresh Jung has qualified for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. He became the eighth Indian shooter to make the cut. 

He finished fourth in the 10m air pistol event in the ISSF World Cup in Munich. 

Samresh became the first male pistol shooter from India to qualify for the Olympics. 

Two other Indian pistol shooters, Abha Dhillon and Jaspal Rana, had represented the country in Barcelona and Atlanta respectively, but both received IOC wild cards. 

Jung tied for the fourth place with a shooter from Poland. Both scored 682.1 (584 + 98.1). 

As all three top finishers had already won a berth each, Jung had to enter into a single shot shoot-off battle with the Polish shooter. 

Speaking from Munich immediately after winning the Olympic place, Jung confessed he had been under pressure after being criticised for not living up to his reputation. 

Now that I have done it, I will concentrate on Olympics with a free mind, he said. 

I am proud to become the first pistol shooter from India to qualify for the Olympics. 

THE QUALIFIERS SO FAR 

Rifle: Gagan Narang, Abhinav Bindra and Avneet Sidhu (10m air rifle); Anjali Bhagwat and Sanjeev Rajput (50m rifle 3-position). Double trap: Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore. Trap: Manavjit Singh Sandhu. 10m Air Pistol: Samresh Jung.

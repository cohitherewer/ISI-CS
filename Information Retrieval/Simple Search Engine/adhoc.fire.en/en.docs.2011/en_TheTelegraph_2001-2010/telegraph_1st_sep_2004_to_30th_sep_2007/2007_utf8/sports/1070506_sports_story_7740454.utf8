 Bradman (Jr) for boycott of Zimbabwe tour

Melbourne: John Bradman has suggested Australia boycott the tour of Zimbabwe which would mirror a move spearheaded by his father as chairman of the Australian board against South Africa in the early 1970s. 

If I were to say anything about the situation, I would link it with my fathers cancellation of the South African series. I think theyre on a par, Bradman (Jr) said. 

Sir Don who served two stints as chairman of ACB (now CA) in the 1960s and 1970s cancelled the South African teams 1971-72 visit because of expected bitterness and violence from anti-Apartheid protesters. 

John said the cancellation of the Zimbabwe tour was warranted. I think so. I think the situations are similar. I would relate it to that.

 Sania out for a few weeks

Hyderabad: Sania Mirza has been ruled out of action for a few weeks with medical reports on Friday indicating a possible anterior cruciate ligament injury to her right knee. 

The 20-year old sustained the knee injury during her first-round match in the Qatar Open earlier this week. 

The MRI scan of the knee joint indicates a possible ACL injury, the doctor, treating her at a local hospital, said. 

The full extent of the injury and the recovery time would be known only after a complete examination, he said. (PTI)

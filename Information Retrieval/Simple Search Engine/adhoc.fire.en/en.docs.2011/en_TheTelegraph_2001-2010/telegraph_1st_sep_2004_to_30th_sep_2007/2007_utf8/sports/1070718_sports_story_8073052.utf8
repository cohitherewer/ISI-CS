The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Prasun to meet members today

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Prasun Mukherjee has called an informal meeting of the members of all 120 affiliated units at the CAB on Wednesday evening. 

The CAB president didnt specify what it was about, but most members felt an effort would be made to find a consensus candidate for the second joint secretarys post. It is almost certain that Mukherjees group will have Samar Pal as a candidate for one of the joint secretarys post. 

Except for Mukherjee and Indranath Dey, no one has filed a nomination for the office-bearers post. It seems they will wait till the last day (Friday) to see if the High Court verdict on the Jagmohan Dalmiya case is delivered.

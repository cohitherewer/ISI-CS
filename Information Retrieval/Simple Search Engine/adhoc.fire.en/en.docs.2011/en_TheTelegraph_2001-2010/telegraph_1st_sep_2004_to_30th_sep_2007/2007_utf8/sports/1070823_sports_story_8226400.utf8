 Yousuf loss will be felt: Lawson

Karachi: A day after proclaiming that he is not bothered about the exodus of some top stars for the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL), Pakistans new coach Geoff Lawson has said experienced middle-order batsman Mohammed Yousufs absence would be felt. 

He (Yousuf) is a great player and his absence will surely be felt, Lawson said in Lahore. 

Lawson rated paceman Shoaib Akhtar highly. He has a great temperament for a fast bowler, and I think he could play for a long time, Lawson said. 

Meanwhile, Pakistans forgotten off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq is keen to play in the ICL if he gets an offer. 

I dont know what this fuss is all about. I dont think the ICL is any different from county cricket. If a player is not required by his country there is nothing wrong if he goes and plays somewhere else, Saqlain said. (AGENCIES)

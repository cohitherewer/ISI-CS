 Fully fit Lee back in Aussie squad

 - ICC WORLD TWENTY20, TOUR OF INDIA 

 Brett Lee 

Sydney: Australia kept faith with their World Cup winners when they named their squad on Friday for the ICC World Twenty20 meet in South Africa in September. Ricky Ponting will captain the side and fast bowler Brett Lee, who missed the World Cup through injury, returns in place of the retired Glenn McGrath. 

Chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said in a Cricket Australia statement that after looking at some of the top domestic Twenty20 players, they felt the World Cup winning side deserved the chance to prove they could perform to the highest standards in both shorter forms of the game. 

Hilditch said Lee had fully recovered from his ankle injury. Its fantastic to have Brett Lee back, fully fit and resuming his spot in the Australian side, he said. Hes back to training and raring to go. 

Australia also named their squad for the one-day series in India, which follows the ICC World Twenty20, and an A team to tour Pakistan including leg-spinner Stuart MacGill.

 Federer snaps ties with Roche

London: Roger Federer has unexpectedly parted ways with coach Tony Roche two weeks before the start of the French Open. 

I thank Tony very much for his efforts over these last years, during which I appreciated the 12-15 weeks per season we would work together, the world No.1 said in a statement released on his website on Saturday. 

I am also grateful for the sacrifice he made. (Reuters)

Guwahati: Even as the Assam government prematurely beat its own drum about hosting the 33rd National Games, its lack of experience in organising big-time sporting event was exposed on the opening day that saw some major goof-ups, including the embarrassment that saw the home football team take the field in borrowed jerseys. 

The mens football team regained some pride for the hosts by coming out trumps to notch up a 4-0 victory against Maharashtra in a group A encounter. 

Assam Football Association secretary Hemendranath Baruah said on Thursday that they waited till midnight for the jerseys at the Games office and threatened to withdraw from the competition if the persons responsible were not punished . 

But the team came out in jerseys provided by the Guwahati Sports Association as their uniform did not reach before the start. 

If that was not enough, the match started half-an-hour late as the officials waited for the medical team to arrive. They eventually conducted the game without one. 

But, on organisational front, there were further lapses as only two events football and womens hockey could be held whereas other scheduled events for the day such as volleyball, wrestling and gymnastics were deferred. 

In mens football, Punjab defeated Meghalaya 2-1 in a group B encounter. 

The womens hockey competition saw powerhouses Jharkhand, led by India international Sumrai Tete, thrashed Uttar Pradesh by half-a-dozen goals. 

But the giant killers in hockey today were Haryana who overwhelmed Madhya Pradesh 10-0 with Jasjeet and Surender Kaur striking three goals each.

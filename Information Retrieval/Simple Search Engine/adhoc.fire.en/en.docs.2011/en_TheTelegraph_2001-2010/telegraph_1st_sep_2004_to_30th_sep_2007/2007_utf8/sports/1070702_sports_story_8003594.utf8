Puerto la Cruz (Venezuela): Uruguay and hosts Venezuela registered their first victories in the Copa America on Saturday, although both victories were marred by foul play and refereeing problems. 

On a wet, windy day in the Andean city of San Cristobal, a bruising Uruguay beat Bolivia 1-0 in a Group A double bill while Venezuela overcame Peru 2-0 after their opponents had a player sent off in the 14th minute. 

Mexican referee Benito Armando Archundia, caught up in a storm last week for his handling of the United States versus Canada Gold Cup semi-final, also angered Peru by not awarding a second-half penalty. The game, which produced Venezuelas first Copa win for three decades, ended in ugly scenes after Alejandro Cichero played keepy-uppy near his own penalty area and was booked, apparently for un-gentlemanly conduct. 

Cicheros behaviour incensed Peru, leading to a scuffle on the edge of the area and pushing and shoving as the players left the pitch. 

Venezuela went top of the group with four points, followed by Peru and Uruguay with three apiece and Bolivia with one. Venezuela did very little, we created five or six clear scoring chances in the second half, said Peru coach Julio Cesar Uribe. 

The sending-off influenced (the outcome) but we have to accept it as part of football. 

Peru, fresh from a 3-0 win over Uruguay on the opening day, began brightly but the game changed in the 14th minute. 

Pedro Garcia was involved in a fierce tussle with Venezuelas Giancarlo Maldonado, but the Peruvian was sent off for elbowing while Maldonado, who appeared to start the incident, received a yellow card. 

Television replays showed contact was made on the chin, but Maldonado fell over backwards. 

Peru held out until half time but four minutes after the break, Cichero outjumped the defence to head in from a corner. 

The visitors were protesting again in the 62nd minute. Paulo Guerrero won a loose ball and crossed to Pizarro, who appeared to be tripped by Hector Gonzalez as he tried to tap the ball in. 

 Referee Archunda, who last week 

 infuriated Canada by disallowing what would have been a 

 stoppage-time equaliser in their 2-1 Gold Cup defeat to 

 the US, waved play on.

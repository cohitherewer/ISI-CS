 Proud to be No.1: Smith

Basseterre: South Africa captain Graeme Smith opened the psychological battle with Australian rival Ricky Ponting by insisting that being the best in the world does matter. 

Ponting has been keen to stress that his teams demotion from the top of the world rankings for the first time since the system was introduced over four years ago was irrelevant. 

Smith, however, is adamant that his teams rise to the top of the pile is reward for years of hard work. Quite naturally we are extremely proud of the number one ranking, but that was built up over two years of playing good and tough cricket and we need to do the same in the World Cup, said Smith. 

In another example of mind games, Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath said that South Africa are vulnerable under pressure. But such a notion was promptly dismissed by South African allrounder Shaun Pollock. 

People are entitled to their own opinions, but were not worried about the pressure situations, Pollock said in a news conference on Wednesday. In fact, were looking forward to dealing with them. Theyre going to arrive and if you want to win the World Cup youre going to have to play in some pressure situations. 

McGrath had told reporters on Tuesday that South Africa dont handle pressure as well as the Australian team. 

The fact that theyre ranked number one means there is a lot more pressure on them to hold that position, the Aussie bowler said. 

South Africa and Australia meet in a Group A match in St Kitts on March 24, a game that looms as one of the defining moments of the World Cup.

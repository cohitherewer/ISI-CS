 Beckham in England squad

TIMES ONLINE AND AGENCIES 

 David Beckham and Steve McClaren 

David Beckham has been recalled to the England squad for Fridays friendly with Brazil and the crucial Euro 2008 match in Estonia on June 6. 

England are fourth in group E, two points behind leaders Croatia, who have a game in hand, and level on 11 points with Israel and Russia. Estonia have yet to pick up a point. 

The former England captain was dumped by Steve McClaren, the new coach, following this summers World Cup but after producing a series of superb performances for Real Madrid over the past few weeks, Beckham has now earned an emotional comeback. 

David was absolutely delighted as I knew he would be, said McClaren. He is coming into form and deserves to be here. Weve got a very big game in Estonia coming up that we have to win. 

The 26-man squad also includes striker Michael Owen. 

Blackburn Rovers wide midfielder David Bentley and Reading left back Nicky Shorey have also been named for the first time after impressive displays in Fridays 3-1 victory in a B international against Albania in which Owen also played. 

Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole, who has only recently returned to action after an injury-hit season, rejoins the squad after a long period away from the international scene. 

They feel like new signings David coming back in, Michael Owen, Alan Smith, Joe Cole and they will be a lift for everybody, said McClaren.

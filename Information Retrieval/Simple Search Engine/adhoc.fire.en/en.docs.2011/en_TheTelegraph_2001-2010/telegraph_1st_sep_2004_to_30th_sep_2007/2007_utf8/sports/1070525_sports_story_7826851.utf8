 Kaka eager to join Real, says Robinho

Madrid: Champions League winner Kaka may be about to join Real Madrid. 

He likes Real Madrid very much, his Brazil teammate Robinho told a local radio channel on Thursday. He speaks highly of the team and he told me hed like to play here. 

But it would be very difficult for Milan to let him leave. 

Kaka set up Filippo Inzaghi for Milans second goal in Wednesdays 2-1 win over Liverpool in the Champions League final. 

Real would win a lot with Kaka, Robinho said. Im sure he will win the Golden Ball this season and he is an excellent person on and off the field. Very religious and always quiet. 

Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon pledged to sign the 25-year-old Brazil playmaker as part of his campaign for the presidency last year.

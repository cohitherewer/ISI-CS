The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 HIGHLIGHTS

 This is the fifth instance of two Indian openers scoring 

 centuries in a Test. The full list: 

 Vijay Merchant (114) amp; Mushtaq Ali (112) 

 vs England (Old Trafford, 1936)

 MH (Vinoo) Mankad (231) amp; Pankaj Roy (173) 

 vs New Zealand (Madras, Corp, 1955-56)

 Sunil Gavaskar (172) amp; Krishnamachari Srikkanth 

 (116) vs Australia (Sydney, 1985-86)

 Virender Sehwag (254) amp; Rahul Dravid (128) 

 vs Pakistan (Lahore, 2005-06)

 Dinesh Karthik (129) amp; Wasim Jaffer (138*) 

 vs Bangladesh (Dhaka, 2006-07)

 This is also the second time two openers have hit centuries 

 against Bangladesh. In 2001-02 in Multan, Saeed Anwar (101) 

 amp; Taufeeq Umar (104) had cracked hundreds against Bangladesh. 

 For the first time in the history of Test cricket, first 

 four batsmen (1,2,3,4) have made centuries. Indians came 

 close to this feat when Gavaskar (172), Srikkanth (116) 

 and Mohinder Amarnath (138) had scored centuries (1,2,3) 

 against Australia in Sydney (1985-86). 

 Rahul Dravid scored his 24th Test hundred on Saturday. He 

 now has 16 hundreds away from home. Tendulkar 

 heads this list with 21, followed by Gavaskar 18, Brian 

 Lara and Steve Waugh (17 each). 

 Dinesh Kartik scored his maiden Test century. His previous 

 highest was 93 versus Pakistan in Calcutta (2004-05). 

 This was Tendulkars third century in Bangladesh and 

 37th overall. He now has the most hundreds in Bangladesh. 

 Marcus Trescothick of England also has three hundreds against 

 Bangladesh. 

 For the first time in Tests, there have been three hundred-plus 

 stands for the same wicket (in this case the first wicket) 

 175 (Jaffer/Karthik), 106 (Jaffer/Dravid) and 127 (Dravid/Tendulkar). 

 Tendulkar, during this innings, went past Trescothick (551 

 runs in four matches) against Bangladesh. The Indian now 

 has 556 runs in five matches against them. 

 Indias score of 610/3 declared surpassed their 

 previous highest in the first innings after being put into 

 bat. It was 518/7 versus Sri Lanka in Colombo (1998-99) 

 in the Asian Test Championship series.

 Indias total is their highest in an innings against 

 Bangladesh. Their previous highest was 540 in Chittagong 

 (2004-05). It is also the highest score versus Bangladesh 

 in Tests, surpassing Australias 581 in Chittagong 

 (2005-06). 

 This was the 13th time India have posted 600-plus runs in 

 an innings. Only once have they crossed the 700-run milestome 

 (705/7) versus Australia in Sydney (2003-04). Eight of those 

 600-plus totals have come in away matches. 

 Mohammed Rafiques 45-4-181-2 is the worst-ever in 

 terms of runs conceded by a Bangladeshi bowler in a Test. 

 The previous record was also his (50-2-156-4) versus India 

 in Chittagong (2004-05).

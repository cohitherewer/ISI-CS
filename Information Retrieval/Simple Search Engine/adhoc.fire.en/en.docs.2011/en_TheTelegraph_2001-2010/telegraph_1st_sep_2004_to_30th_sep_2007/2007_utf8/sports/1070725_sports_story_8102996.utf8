 Dhoni up to 

 No. 50

 ICC TEST RANKINGS

 Calcutta: 

 Mahendra Singh Dhonis match-saving unbeaten 76 

 for India in the opening Test against England has helped 

 the swashbuckling batsman break into the top 50 of the latest 

 LG-ICC Test player rankings.

 According to an ICC release, the 

 stylish right-hander, who was at the crease for more than 

 three hours for his second best Test score, has gained four 

 places up to be placed at 50th spot after his valiant effort 

 at the Lords. However, Dhoni is placed as high as 

 fifth in the ICC ranking for ODI batsmen.

 Indian pace spearhead Zaheer Khan 

 also regained a place in the top 20 after moving up six 

 places. He is at the 19th position following his match-haul 

 of six wickets.

 Seamer Rudra Pratap Singh, whose 

 overall figures of seven for 117 included his first five-for 

 in Test cricket, climbed 13 places to be at 38th slot. However, 

 captain Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkars failures 

 in the match reflected on their rankings as both of them 

 slipped a place each to be ninth and joint 17th, respectively.

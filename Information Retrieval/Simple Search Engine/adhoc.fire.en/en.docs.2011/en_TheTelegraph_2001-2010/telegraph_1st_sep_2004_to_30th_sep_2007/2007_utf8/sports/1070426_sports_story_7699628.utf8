 A great feeling, says Rooney

Manchester: Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson believes Wayne Rooneys dramatic late winner against AC Milan on Tuesday has given his side a golden opportunity to reach the final of the Champions League. 

Ferguson said: He was a threat to them all night and the winning goal was incredible. He didnt take a touch but hit it first time and it was a brilliant goal. 

Waynes goals have put us in a fantastic position. I think we will score over there again with the speed of the team. It will not be easy in Milan but they know it wont be easy either. One thing is I think we have an outstanding chance now. 

Ferguson, who hopes Rio Ferdinand will be fit to return for the second leg, added: We lost two terrible goals ourselves by bad defending but it was a great second goal and that gave us a big incentive. There was only going to be one winner after that, albeit with the last kick of the ball. 

Rooney described scoring his match-winning goal, which he drove past Dida after running onto a pass from Ryan Giggs, as a great feeling. He said: We knew if we could get a victory here it would make it a bit easier going to Milan and a goal in the last minute was a great feeling. 

Milan playmaker Kaka, who scored the teams both goals, believed AC Milan are on course to reach the final despite losing the first leg. 

Its a very bitter result that gives us little margin for error but Im convinced Milan can go through, Kaka said. (REUTERS)

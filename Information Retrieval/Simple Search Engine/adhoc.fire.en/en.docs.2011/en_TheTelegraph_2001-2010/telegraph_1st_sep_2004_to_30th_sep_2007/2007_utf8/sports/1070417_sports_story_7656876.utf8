 Chappell still has a lot to offer: Moody

Grenada: Sri Lanka coach Tom Moody was on Sunday effusive in praise of Greg Chappell, saying the former Australian captain can contribute a lot as he has a lot of experience and a huge bank of knowledge about the game. 

Chappell had upstaged fellow Australian Moody for the job of coaching India two years ago but his tenure ended in a disastrous fashion in the World Cup. 

His job surely was the toughest coaching assignment in world cricket. There was a huge weight on him but he did a good job with them. With the World Cup, his tenure ended but he sure has a lot to offer, said Moody about Chappell, who is presently being touted to play a consultants role with Cricket Australia (CA). 

Australias incumbent coach Tim Nielsen has recently stated that he would like to have a word with Chappell and draw on his huge experience as a player and coach. 

He sure has a lot to offer. I am sure someone will take advantage of his vast knowledge and benefit from his experience, said Moody. 

Moody though was not willing to entertain any question on the feasibility of his coaching India in the immediate future. 

However, Moody deliberated on the brand of cricket which his team Sri Lanka play vis--vis Australia. 

Sri Lanka play different brand of cricket to Australia and we want to stick to it. Australians are beginning to play more and more power cricket but we are comfortable with our own unique style of play, he said. 

One of our strength has been adaptability and we should be ready for any situation, he said. 

Moody found some similarity in the present Sri Lankan team with the World Cup winning team of 1996 but believed by and large inspiration cannot be drawn from something which happened 10 years ago. 

Three guys, Jayasuriya, Murali and Vaas are still a part of the Sri Lankan team. But we, in the dressing room, have not talked a great deal about the 1996 World Cup as inspiration. It happened 10 years ago, he said. 

Yet there are some similarities. Like Jayasuriya who is still playing a similar brand of cricket. Then Murali and him (Jayasuriya) still control the bowling in the middle-overs. That has not changed.

 Borde vote for former Test players on panel

Mumbai: Former India captains, who in last weeks meeting with the BCCI suggested radical changes, had also advised the Board to include only former Test players in the selection panel. 

We had suggested that former Test cricketers be named in the selection committee as only they will know the pressure of playing at the highest level, Chandu Borde said on Monday. 

Last Saturday, the BCCI working committee decided to do way with the present zonal representation in the senior and junior selection panels in favour of paid selectors, appointed on a full time basis for two years. 

Even though first-class cricketers have good knowledge of the game, Test players know better how to go about the job, he said. 

The current senior selection panel has only chairman Dilip Vengsarkar and Venkatapathi Raju as members with Test match experience. 

Borde was among the seven ex-captains who attended the meeting along with Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, Srinivas Venkatraghavan, Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Ravi Shastri. (PTI)

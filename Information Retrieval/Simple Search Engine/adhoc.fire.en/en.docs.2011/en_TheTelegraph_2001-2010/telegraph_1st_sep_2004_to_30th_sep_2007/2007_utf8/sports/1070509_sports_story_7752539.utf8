 Ferguson set to rest key players

 - It would have been some game if we werent going to Stamford Bridge as champions 

Manchester: Manchester Uniteds clash with Chelsea on Wednesday will be no dress rehearsal for the FA Cup final, with United manager Alex Ferguson set to rest several key players after their title success. 

The fact that United wrested the Premier League crown from Chelsea on the weekend means there is nothing riding on the game at Stamford Bridge, which comes 10 days before the two sides meet again in the Cup at the new Wembley Stadium. 

As he prepared for Wednesdays fixture, Ferguson told reporters: Im glad we are going there as champions. It would have been some game if we werent. 

The fact that we have won it means there is no need to be demanding of our players. We can now prepare for the final. 

I will just spread my squad the best I can. Obviously the ones who need a rest will get a rest... There will be a lot of changes simply because the players are tired. The ones who played on Saturday were running on empty. They gave their last drop. 

Ferguson will take the chance to give some players, possibly the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs, a breather against Chelsea as he is committed to selecting a strong side for Uniteds final league game. 

United face West Ham at Old Trafford on Sunday in a match that will have a bearing on who is relegated, with West Ham hoping to survive and send down either Sheffield United or Wigan who play each other with Watford and Charlton Athletic. 

The West Ham game is a very important issue. Obviously we have to respect our reputation, Ferguson said. Alan Curbishley (West Hams manager) is a good friend of mine but he understands we have to respect the wishes of other managers. 

They deserve our best attention to the game and I will be picking a team to win on Sunday. 

Jose Mourinho has promised that United, like his own side received two years ago, will be given a guard of honour. It is obvious we will give them a guard of honour on Wednesday, as they did with us at Old Trafford, the Portuguese said 

Im pleased, said Ferguson, whose relationship with Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho appears to have survived one or two verbal jousts during the season. 

He was very complimentary in his post-match interviews (on Sunday) and I expected that. I am sure he understands that winning and losing are twins, in a way, and you have to deal with it the right way and the same way. 

Mourinho, unaccustomed to being a runner-up, could not bring himself to say the new champions were the better side. Next season we will be ready, he said. We have still the FA Cup final to play but July 9, we will start (training) again. This game (on Wednesday) gives, in terms of spirit, the standard for what we have to do. 

Chelsea are expected to rest many of their first-team regulars, too. They will be without two big-money signings midfielder Michael Ballack and striker Andriy Shevchenko. Ballack is recovering from ankle surgery, while Shevchenko was to undergo an operation Tuesday on a groin hernia injury. 

Chelsea defender Khalid Boulahrouz is suspended for Wednesdays game after being sent off against Arsenal. 

Chelsea, who have already won the League Cup, were seeking an unprecedented four trophies. But, like United, the Blues lost in the semi-finals of the Champions League. 

It is obviously very disappointing, when you look at the season as a whole, Terry said. We played really well at Arsenal (on Sunday), especially with 10 men and were unlucky not to have been able to push Manchester United right to the wire in the end. But it was not to be. 

Charlton, meanwhile, was relegated from the Premier League after losing 0-2 at home to Tottenham on Monday. Last-placed Watford will join Charlton and one other team yet to be determined in the League Championship next season.

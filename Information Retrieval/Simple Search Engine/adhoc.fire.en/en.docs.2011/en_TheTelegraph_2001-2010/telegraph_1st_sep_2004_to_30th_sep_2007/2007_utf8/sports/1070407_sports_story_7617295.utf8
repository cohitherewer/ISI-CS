 BCB meeting 

Dhaka: The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) Friday said it would convene an emergency meeting next week in the wake of Dav Whatmores reported desire to coach India following Greg Chappells resignation. 

The BCB has objected to Whatmores immediate response on the issue, saying it would influence the focus of the team.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tipping corner

As the World Cup draws closer, a lot of former players, some World Cup winners themselves, have started giving their predictions. Some of those who made a forecast on Tuesday are as follows (alphabetically): 

Wasim Akram: Sri Lanka have some extremely talented players and can upset anyone to win the title. Pakistan have too many injury and other problems, like the lack of a reliable opening pair. Their chances are 50-50. Pakistan are struggling with injury worries to key bowlers like Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif, and without this duo the team will find the going tough. 

Imran Khan: Australians are favourites to win the World Cup, although they will miss their matchwinner Brett Lee. But Ricky Pontings side is still very strong in every department. They may have lost the recent one-day series at home and in New Zealand, but they are still very difficult to demoralise as a team. Pakistan and India are also good sides with a lot of good players. But in Pakistans case, it will all depend on whether Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif are going to the World Cup. 

Barry Richards: Ever since England won the triangular series in Australia, a lot of people have been saying that Australia are going to come back even stronger. I am not convinced. A lot of the other sides see the Aussies as a team with stars of the past nearing the end of their careers. They now believe they can beat the Aussies and none more so than South Africa and New Zealand. (Agencies)

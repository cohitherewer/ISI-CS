 Sreesanth gets movie offer

Kochi: A filmmaker down south has offered Sreesanth a movie alongside Malayalam megastar Mamooty, in an attempt to cash in on the flamboyant Indian pacers massive popularity. 

According to director of the film Aashiq Abu, the quick has not consented to the project, but if he agrees Sreesanth will not have to do any major homework for his role as he is scheduled to appear in the film as a cricketer. 

I am waiting for Sreesanths confirmation. The film is in the preliminary stage. I had met him after his return from South Africa. The story was also read to him, the debutant director said here on Saturday. 

I hope to start the shooting once I get confirmation from Sreesanth. I know he is very busy. Lots of cricket are coming after the current one-day series against Australia, Abu, currently working as an assistant to Malayalam film director Kamal, added. 

The work on the script is in the final stages, he revealed, adding that the dialogues in the film will be written by his friend Bipin Chandran. 

Abu said Sreesanths role would be more than just a cameo. 

It will not be a guest role, but certainly an important role, which will have its influence on the story, he said. 

According to Abu, Mamooty would play a police officer. Among other major actors, who are expected to be included, are Kalabhavan Mani, Indrajit and Innocent, he said. 

Sreesanths family, however, has refused to say anything on the matter. 

Sreesanth is just concentrating on the one-day series, a family member said. (PTI)

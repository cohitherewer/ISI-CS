 Bagan held goalless

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES

New Delhi/Mumbai: Three-time champions Mohun Bagan and local outfit Air India played out a goalless draw to miss out on an opportunity to improve their league standings in the ONGC Cup National Football League match here on Thursday. 

Both teams were sloppy in keeping possession besides lacking vision and also showed poor approach work in this 16th round insipid clash that saw few genuine chances being created. Former champions Mohun Bagan took their tally to 21 points after 16 matches while the opponents are on 20 after the 16th round. 

Meanwhile, the 11th edition of the National Football League (NFL) will come to an end on May 19. On Thursday, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) released the draw for the last round, which will be played over three days from May 17. 

Though Dempo Sports Club, with a clear five-point lead, are almost certain to pip Mahindra United for the title, the AIFF has not taken any chance and has decided to play the matches of the two contenders simultaneously at Margao and Mumbai on May 18. 

The Super Cup between Federation Cup and NFL champions will be played on May 27. 

NFL final round schedule 

May 17: Sporting Clube de Goa vs HASC; May 18: Dempo vs Mohun Bagan; Mahindra United vs Mohammedan Sporting; May 19: East Bengal vs JCT; Churchill Brothers vs Air India.

 ECB needs new vote for chairman 

London: A second round of voting is needed to decide who will replace David Morgan as chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) after the initial vote ended in a tie on Tuesday. 

Two candidates, Somerset chairman Giles Clarke and current ECB deputy chairman Michael Sloper, each received nine votes, with one abstention. The Marylebone Cricket Club chairman and 18 county chairmen voted in the ballot. 

An ECB statement said the board would decide on the timing of the second ballot within 48 hours. 

Morgan is leaving to become president of crickets world governing body, the International Cricket Council, next year. 

Morgan will replace acting president Ray Mali, who took over after Percy Sonn died in May.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 ICCs stand

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Monday cleared its position with regard to Australias forthcoming tour of Zimbabwe which is shrouded in uncertainty. 

The full members of the ICC entered into an arrangement named the Future Tours Programme (FTP) agreement to regulate scheduling of international matches between the ten full members, ICC said in a release. 

A member that does not comply with its obligation to tour another member is subject to a penalty of a minimum of $ 2 million or such greater amount that the host member can prove to have lost as a result of the failure to tour. 

However, it said the penalty will not be imposed in certain conditions. 

If the government of one of the members refuses to grant a consent, exemption, approval or clearance or imposes any restriction or prohibition for its team to tour another country, these circumstances constitute acceptable non-compliance, the release said.

 Kuznetsova, Jankovic set up summit clash 

Rome: Svetlana Kuznetsova powered past Daniela Hantuchova 6-4, 6-2 on Saturday to set up a final showdown with third seed Jelena Jankovic at the Italian Open. 

Jankovic swept aside 14th seed Patty Schnyder 6-1, 6-3. 

Kuznetsova was far too strong for the ninth seed, using the pace and accuracy of her groundstrokes to break the Slovakian in the third game of the first set. 

She then took advantage of unforced errors by her rival to break again in the fifth and seventh games of the second set before serving out for the match. 

Im very happy with my tennis in this tournament. Ive won all my matches in two sets and Im feeling very comfortable out here, said the Russian second seed. 

I knew it would be hard. But I also knew that Daniela plays better on power surfaces and that I would have my chances if I stayed focused. 

Although Kuznetsova and Jankovic have never claimed the Rome title, the final should be a hard-fought affair between two of the strongest claycourt performers this season. 

Jankovic will be bidding for her second title on the slow surface this season following her success in Charleston last month. 

She moves incredibly well on claycourts and she covers a lot of balls. I think it will be very interesting match. We have both been playing well in our last two tournaments, said Kuznetsova. 

Jankovics speed around the court was evident in her easy win over Schnyder. 

The Swiss, who knocked out former world number one Serena Williams on Friday, dropped every one of her eight service games and made a string of unforced errors, including one on match point when she shanked a forehand into the tramlines. (Reuters)

 Racial tension over Cup brochure

Georgetown: An allegedly racist caption in a brochure for the World Cup has opened up racial tensions between Guyanas East Indians and its African descendant population, an official said Saturday. 

The International Cricket Council (ICC) brochure captions a photograph of the India-financed Providence Stadium being built for coming games, saying that with Guyanas distinct Indian heritage you are sure to experience the fusion of West Indian and East Indian culture. 

Following outcries by the main opposition Peoples National Congress Reform-One Guyana as well as by Georgetown mayor Hamilton Green, the government has written the ICC seeking an explanation. 

The words on the brochure are unfortunate. said sports and culture minister Frank Anthony. (AFP)

 Clijsters done with tennis

 Kim Clijsters 

Brussels: Former world No. 1 Kim Clijsters announced her immediate retirement from tennis on her website on Sunday. 

The fourth-ranked Belgian ended her 10-year career, cutting short plans to stop playing at the end of the season, because of chronic injuries. 

It has been more than fun, but the rackets are being hung up, she said. To retire before the age of 24, it is very young but it was so beautiful. I would have been able to continue for a few months and to take part in the four most lucrative tournaments (three Grand Slams and the Masters). 

Money is important, but not the most important thing in my life. Health and private happiness are so much more important. 

The 23-year-old Clijsters lost in straight sets to Ukrainian qualifier Julia Vakulenko in her final match on Thursday, failing to defend her J amp;S Cup title in Warsaw. 

The 2005 US Open champion said her struggle with injury had taken its toll and that it was time to focus on other things, including her July 14 wedding to American basketball player Brian Lynch. 

Its tiring to get out of bed and to use an hour just to warm up stiff muscles in the morning, she said. The constant injuries and continual rehabilitation... it makes it all even more difficult to go on. 

A left wrist injury last year stopped Clijsters from defending her only Gland Slam title at Flushing Meadows and from playing in the Fed Cup final. She reached the 2007 Australian Open semi-finals, but injured her hip. Earlier this month, Clijsters had complained of back pain after losing in Key Biscayne. 

Clijsters won the 2002 and 2003 WTA Championships as part of her career 34 singles titles. She was Belgiums first tennis player to reach No. 1, holding the top-ranked spot for 19 weeks in 2003. 

But Clijsters was unlucky in Grand Slam finals losing in 2001 and 2003 at the French Open, in 2003 at the US Open, and in 2004 at the Australian Open. (AGENCIES)

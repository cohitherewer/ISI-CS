The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A grudge tie 

 for us: Bernard

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Super Cup

 Gurgaon: 

 On the eve of the Super Cup tie between Mohun Bagan and 

 Dempo here on Sunday, the mood of the two coaches is as 

 different as it gets.

 While the lush green pitch at 

 the Devi Lal Sports Complex has brought the smile back on 

 Dempo coach Armando Colaco, the normally genial Mohun Bagan 

 trainer Bernard is spitting venom.

 To Bernard, the one-off tie under 

 floodlights is a grudge encounter. We are looking 

 at it as a revenge match and would like to win it by hook 

 or crook, the Nigerian thundered. Dempo is partying, 

 we will do it tomorrow (Sunday).

 In 2006-07, Mohun Bagan met Dempo 

 four times and lost thrice.

 Bernard may be baying for blood, 

 but he doesnt have enough ammunition to hit the target. 

 At least half a dozen of his top players havent accompanied 

 the squad.While Subrata Pal, Mehrajuddin and Mehtab Hussain 

 were left behind on charge of disloyalty, the 

 absence of Sanjiv Maria, Tomba Singh and Dharamjit Singh 

 has handicapped Bernard.

 He has no choice but to fall back 

 on Bhaichung Bhutia and Jose Barreto. We will go all 

 out for a victory I am sure our forwards will do the trick. 

 he summed up.

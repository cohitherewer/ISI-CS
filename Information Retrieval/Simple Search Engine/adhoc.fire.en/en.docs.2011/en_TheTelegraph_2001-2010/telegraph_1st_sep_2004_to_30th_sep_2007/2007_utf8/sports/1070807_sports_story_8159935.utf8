The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The national selectors are likely to retain the same XV that did duty in the four matches in Ireland for the seven ODIs against England. The squad for the ICC World Twenty20 meet could have a different look, though. 

With chairman of selectors Dilip Vengsarkar being in England with Team India, his four colleagues Venkatapathi Raju, Bhupinder Singh (Sr), Sanjay Jagdale and Ranjib Biswal will assemble in Mumbai on Tuesday afternoon. They will have a tele-conference with Vengsarkar and Rahul Dravid. 

Mahendra Singh Dhoni is set to lead India in the Twenty20 meet. Yuvraj Singh or Dinesh Karthik will get the vice captaincy. Zaheer Khan may be rested. Theres no official word yet, but the pacer may be given the option of playing the tournament in South Africa. 

What is more or less confirmed is that Virender Sehwag and Harbhajan Singh, who fell out of favour, are set to be recalled. Suresh Raina would also have been a certainty, but theres no word on his fitness yet. 

We have heard that he is fit. I am not sure if he has sent a fitness certificate If he has, it might be lying in the Mumbai office. He hasnt played a match since his surgery. The chairman of selection committee will take a decision on whether to include him after consultation with John Gloster, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said. 

THE SQUADS 

ODIs in England (likely): Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid (capt.), Yuvraj Singh, Gautam Gambhir, Robin Uthappa, Rohit Sharma; Dinesh Karthik, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (vice-capt.); Ramesh Powar, Piyush Chawla; Ajit Agarkar, Zaheer Khan, Rudra Pratap Singh, Sreesanth.

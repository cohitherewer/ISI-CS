The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Doc absent, ref refuses to start tie

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Referee Biplab Poddar abandoned a CFL Super Division match because no doctor was present at the ground on Sunday. 

The players of Tollygunge Agragami and Police AC were warming up at the Mohun Bagan ground, but Poddar refused to kick off the game without a doctor at the ground. He waited for 30 minutes before calling off the game. 

An IFA official said the referee could have started the match since a medical unit was posted at the nearby Taltala ground. However, a Calcutta Referees Association official backed Poddar, saying the presence of a doctor at the ground was a pre-requisite before starting a match. 

A few days ago, former India goalkeeper Prasanta Dora had a close escape in similar circumstances. He collapsed on the ground and lost consciousness while doing duty under the CPT bar. He was taken to a hospital where he regained consciousness.

 Afridi faces ban for misconduct

Karachi: Pakistans Shahid Afridi faces a ban of up to four Tests or eight one-day Internationals after being charged with bringing the game into disrepute in the first ODI against South Africa. 

The Pakistan allrounder was seen pushing his bat at a spectator, who said something to him, while returning to the pavilion after being dismissed in Centurion on Sunday. 

Chris Broad, the Match Referee, had initially refused to bring any charges against Afridi, but ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed decided to act after studying the video of the incident. 

Afridi has been charged with a Level III offence under Section C 2 of the Code, which refers to conduct unbecoming... Which could bring (players or officials or) the game of cricket into disrepute, an ICC statement said. 

The release said the hearing will be conducted by Chris Broad. If found guilty, Afridi could be banned for two to four Tests, or four to eight one-dayers. Until it takes place, Afridi remains available to play. 

South African batsman Herschelle Gibbs was banned for a Test, a one-dayer and a Twenty-20 International for racial remarks in the first Test earlier in the series. (PTI)

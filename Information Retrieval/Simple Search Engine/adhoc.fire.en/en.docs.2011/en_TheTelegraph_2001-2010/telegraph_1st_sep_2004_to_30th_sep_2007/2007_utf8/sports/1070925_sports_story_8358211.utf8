 No Jaspal Rana in India squad

New Delhi: The National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) provided a golden opportunity to promising shooter Harveen Srao on Monday to qualify for next years Beijing Olympics by including her in the 37-member team for the Asian Shooting Championship to be held in Kuwait from December 3 to 13. 

Asian Games double gold medal winner Jaspal Rana was, however, conspicuously absent from the team comprising 23 men and 14 women, who will vie for 28 quota places at the event which would be the last chance for Indian shooters to qualify for the Olympics. 

An official said the Asian Games gold medallist did not appear for the trials, so could not be included in the team. (PTI)

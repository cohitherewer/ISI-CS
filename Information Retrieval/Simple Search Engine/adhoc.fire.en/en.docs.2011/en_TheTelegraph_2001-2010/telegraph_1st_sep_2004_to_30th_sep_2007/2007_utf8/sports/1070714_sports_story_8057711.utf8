 Zidane rejects Galaxy offer

ROB STEWART

Zinedine Zidane has wished David Beckham well on his LA Galaxy adventure but effectively ruled out joining his former Real Madrid teammate in the search for further fame and glory in Hollywood. 

LA Galaxy general manager Alexi Lalas went public on his offer to present Zidane with the opportunity to be reunited with Beckham in California, but the Frenchman has resisted his overtures to play Major League Soccer. 

I will not come back, no, the former France captain said when the prospect of his coming out of retirement at LA Galaxy was raised during a sports magazine interview. 

When you stop for a year, its very hard to start again. What matters to me today is the chance to do everything I couldnt do before spending time with my family and friends, promoting some events and discovering the world. 

There is life after football or, at least, there has been for me. The past 12 months have been very different, but my life is as full now as it was when I was playing football. 

He did, though, express support for Beckhams move across the Atlantic. I respect his decision and wish him all the best in his new life, said Zidane.

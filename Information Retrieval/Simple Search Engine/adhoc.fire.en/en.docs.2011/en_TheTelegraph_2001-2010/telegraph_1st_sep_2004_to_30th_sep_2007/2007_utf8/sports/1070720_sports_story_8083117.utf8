 Czech colts in final

Edmonton: Czech Republic beat Austria 2-0 on Wednesday to reach the final of the under-20 World Cup where they will face Argentina or Chile. 

The Czechs took the lead in just the fourth minute when Lubos Kalouda whipped in a free-kick from the left which Austria keeper Michael Zaglmair failed to hold on to and Tomas Micola tapped home. 

Eleven minutes later, the Czechs doubled their lead when Ondrej Kudela burst down the right and slipped over a low cross which Martin Fenin converted from close range. 

Argentina and Chile face each other in the second semi-final in Toronto. The final will be played on Sunday at the same venue.

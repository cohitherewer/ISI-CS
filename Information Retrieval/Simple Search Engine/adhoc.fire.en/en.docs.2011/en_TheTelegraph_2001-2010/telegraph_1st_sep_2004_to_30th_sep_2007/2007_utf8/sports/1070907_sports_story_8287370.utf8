 A bitter twist for Lewis

Lewis Hamiltons chances of becoming the Formula One world champion in his rookie season were again under threat on Wednesday night after new evidence emerged that his team, McLaren Mercedes, may have used Ferrari technical secrets on their cars. 

The latest blow to McLaren came in a statement from the FIA which said that it had received new evidence in connection with the long-running spy scandal and that its World Motor Sport Council (WMSC) will sit to consider it in Paris. 

The FIA did not say where the new evidence had come from. However, there were suggestions that it did not come from Ferrari or sources in Italy, leaving open the possibility that other rivals of McLaren may be involved. 

The FIA had been planning to hold a session of its Court of Appeal next Thursday, at which Ferrari were going to be given the chance to contest a decision by the WMSC not to punish McLaren over the possession of Ferrari technical information by Mike Coughlan, the chief designer. This hearing has been cancelled. 

In that judgment in late July, the WMSC found that, although McLaren had the information thought to be a 780-page dossier with details of Ferraris present cars, their racing operations and design effort there was insufficient evidence that it had been used on the racetrack. 

However, the council left open the possibility of what amounts to a retrial if new evidence emerged. In its judgment, it said: We reserve the right to invite Vodafone McLaren Mercedes back in front of the WMSC, where it will face the possibility of exclusion from not only the 2007 championship but the 2008 championship. 

That this has come to pass is a setback for McLaren, Hamilton, Fernando Alonso, his teammate, and Ron Dennis, the team principal, who has argued passionately that any team run by him would not use information stolen from rivals and that none of the data in Coughlans possession had contaminated McLarens campaign. 

In a statement on Wednesday night, McLaren said that they were aware of the decision of the FIA and that they would continue to cooperate with the governing body. 

McLaren Racing has been made aware that new evidence has been presented to the FIA. As a result we have been informed that the Court of Appeal hearing will now comprise a meeting of the WMSC. 

The big worry for the Woking-based team is that the FIA and its president, Max Mosley, would not have taken the decision to reconvene the WMSC had it not been given evidence that it regarded as serious. 

Also on the collective mind of the WMSC although the FIA would deny this will be the withering reaction from Ferrari to its initial decision, which the Italian team described as incomprehensible and legitimising dishonest behaviour in Formula One. 

In Italy, a prosecutor has claimed that Nigel Stepney, the former Ferrari mechanic who is alleged to have supplied Coughlan with the dossier he denies it is also linked to an attempt to sabotage Ferraris cars before the Monaco GP in May.

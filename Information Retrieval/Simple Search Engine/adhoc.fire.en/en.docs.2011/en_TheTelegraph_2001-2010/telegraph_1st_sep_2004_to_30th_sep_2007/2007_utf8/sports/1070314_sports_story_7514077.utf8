Port of Spain: Team India return to their favourite Caribbean venue Monday seeking to sort out their opening batting dilemma before opening their World Cup campaign. 

Runners-up to Australia in the 2003 World Cup in South Africa, India will play all their three preliminary round games in Port of Spain, which has been Indias favo- urite Caribbean venue since the first suc- cess against the West Indies in a 1971 Test match. 

Just one decisive match in the 1971 series gave India their first Test series triumph against the West Indies. Since then, India have won three more Test matches in the West Indies, and two of them were at the same Queens Park Oval. The Queens Park Oval has also been the venue of Indias lone limited-overs series triumph in the West Indies in 2002. 

A sizable presence of people of Indian origin living in Trinidad has always ensured good support for Indias cricketers, who have also found the pitches at this venue responding to their spin bowlers. 

India, the 1983 World Cup winners, are in Group B with 1996 champions Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Bermuda providing a strong subcontinental flavour to the pool from which two teams will advance to the Super 8s. 

We always enjoy coming to Trinidad because we have always had good support. And since we are not playing the West Indies we expect even more support in our matches, captain Rahul Dravid said as the team arrived from Jamaica late Monday. We know the conditions here very well, and we remain confident of doing well. 

Indias first World Cup outing will be on Saturday against Bangladesh, before which Dravid will have to make a tough decision on his opening combination because of Virender Sehwags run of poor form. 

Going through the leanest streak of his career, Sehwag has scored just one half-century in the 13 one-day Internationals and even missed the recent home series against the West Indies. 

Sehwags form has continued to be a big worry, although the team management last week restored him to the opening position despite the national selectors picking him for a middle-order berth. 

It is as an opener that Sehwag often makes the most impact through his uninhibited stroke-play, but his second-ball duck in the last warm-up game against the West Indies which India won by nine wickets has caused some concern in the team management. 

Dravid says Sehwag has got the experience to tackle tough situations, but team selection is about people being fit and being in form. 

Sehwag has a big role to play, hopefully hell fire soon, Dravid said. We have four guys in the lineup whove opened for India. The team has plenty of options, so finding the right pair of openers will not be a major problem. 

Beside Sehwag, other openers in the team are Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar and Robin Uthappa. 

Tendulkar, the worlds top-scoring batsman, has been the most successful of all these openers, but the team management has decided to move him to the middle-order hoping to use his experience to bolster the shaky middle. 

We have to be flexible about the situation and make plans according to the prevalent conditions, Dravid said.

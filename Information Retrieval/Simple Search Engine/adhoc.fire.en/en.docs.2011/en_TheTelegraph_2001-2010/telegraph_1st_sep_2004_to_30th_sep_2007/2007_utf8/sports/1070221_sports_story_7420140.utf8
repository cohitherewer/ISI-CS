 Bowlers must contribute with bat too: Harbhajan

Mumbai: Stressing the need for the tail-enders to contribute with the bat, off-spinner Harbhajan Singh said the bowlers had been working hard on that aspect as it could make a huge difference in big matches. 

It is important for bowlers to bat and contribute. As we bat down the order, the 20-odd runs that we can contribute is very important. All the bowlers have been working hard on batting as well. 

The 35-40 runs can make huge difference in big matches. We do take our batting seriously, Harbhajan said here on Tuesday after participating in a Twenty20 match at the MIG Club. 

My job is to bowl, I know that if I bowl well I will get wickets and also the runs will not be scored. Also I want to score runs while batting, said Harbhajan. 

Twenty six-year-old Harbhajan said he was not sure about the kind of pitches being prepared for the World Cup.On Australias recent reversals against New Zealand and England, Harbhajan said one should not take the Aussies lightly even after their recent defeats. 

Just because they have lost two matches, you cannot write them off. All the teams there will be good, we have to work on our game rather than thinking about how Australia or any other country is doing, he said. (PTI)

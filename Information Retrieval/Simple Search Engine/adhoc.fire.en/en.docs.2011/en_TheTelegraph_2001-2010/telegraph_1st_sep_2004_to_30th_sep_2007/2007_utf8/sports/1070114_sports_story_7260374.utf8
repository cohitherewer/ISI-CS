Calcutta: At a time when the senior side is struggling to find their feet and come out of their trophy-less streak at national level, East Bengal colts on Saturday gave a fresh lease of life to the club. 

The East Bengal under-15 side lifted the Nike Manchester United Premier Cup tournament at the Cooperage in Mumbai, beating the local side Mahindra United 1-0. Biswajit Natta scored the matchwinner in the 31st minute through a brilliant free-kick. 

We have been consistent in the entire tournament and confident about winning the trophy, joint coach Manojit Das, a former India international, told The Telegraph from Mumbai on Saturday. 

They completely outplayed and out-thought the opponents today, Das added. Swarup Das, another former international, was the other coach of the side. 

Each half was played over 20 minutes and East Bengal dominated the proceedings throughout the match and emerged the deserved winners. East Bengals domination can further be established by the fact that they scored 15 goals and conceded none. 

Im not going into the hypothesis of who is better and who has a good chance to make the senior side after a few years. But all of these boys are high on confidence and a wonderful lot, Das maintained. 

Nattas goal was almost a repetition of his strike against Mohun Bagan in the semi-finals. His thumping left-footer from the right side of the penalty box had no answer for the Mahindra goalkeeper. 

The players will reach the city on Monday and will be felicitated by the club the next day. By winning the tournament, East Bengal will now fly over to Singapore to play the South East Asia regional finals from May 2831. 

The regional winners will then join 19 teams from around the world to play for the world finals. Mohun Bagan played the world finals last season.

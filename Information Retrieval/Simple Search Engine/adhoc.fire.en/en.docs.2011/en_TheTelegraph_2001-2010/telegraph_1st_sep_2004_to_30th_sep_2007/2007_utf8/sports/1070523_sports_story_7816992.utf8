 Sania loses

New Delhi: For the second week in a row since returning from knee injury, Sania Mirza failed to clear the opening round in a WTA Tour event, going down tamely to Meghann Shaughnessy in the $200,000 Istanbul Cup tennis tournament on Tuesday. 

The 52nd-ranked Indian lost 4-6, 3-6 in just over one hour and 20 minutes. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 For now, Pal will stay

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The world may think otherwise, but IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly feels treasurer K.D. Pals arrest does not reflect poorly on the association and that he will continue. 

The treasurers post is an elected one and its beyond the secretarys powers to seek his removal We are waiting to see what he says in reply to the chargesheet. Only then will we decide on our course of action. Also, since the matter is sub judice, it is not fair for me to make a comment, Ganguly said on Monday. 

With Pal in jail, none of the office-bearers had the right to sign cheques till Sunday. A special governing body meeting resolved the impasse, giving the authority to the secretary and two vice-presidents. 

The secretary felt the image of IFA wont be tarnished. I wont say it reflects poorly on the organisation Its a matter concerning an individual. 

He said suitable cheques and balances have since been put in place . Deloitte Haskins amp; Sells, a audit firm, has been asked to investigate and suggest measures to make the system foolproof.

 Madanlal: I have nothing against the BCCI

 Madanlal 

New Delhi: Former national coach Madanlal, who has aligned with the Indian Cricket League (ICL), says he is not against the BCCI and his joining the new venture is purely a professional decision. 

I am a professional coach. For me it is question of a job. They (ICL) offered it to me and I accepted. If the BCCI had offered me something like this, I would have accepted it. It is just a matter of doing a job. I have nothing against the BCCI, Madanlal, who has been offered the job of coaching Delhi team in the ICL, said. 

Madanlal hoped his move would not strain his relations with the BCCI. 

On my part, the relation stands the same. Cricket is my passion and I love coaching. I am happy that the ICL has approached me. It is a very simple thing that somebody approaches you for a job and you decide to accept that, he said. 

While Madanlal is unsure how the Essel Groups venture will raise new talents as the BCCI has made it clear that it will not recognise players joining the ICL, Balwinder Singh Sandhu another new entrant into the breakaway league believes that many youngsters, who fail to get picked in talent spotting camps held by the BCCI, will get a better deal in the ICL set-up. 

You know why so many talented ones fail to get spotted in the regular camps run by the associations. They are pushed out by those who are less talented but are being backed by men who matter. This can be set right in the ICL talent spotting camps, he said. (PTI)

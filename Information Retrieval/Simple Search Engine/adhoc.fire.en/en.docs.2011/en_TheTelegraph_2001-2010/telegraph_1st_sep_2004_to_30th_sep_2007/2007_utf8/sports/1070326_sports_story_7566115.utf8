 Bob never had full control

THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

 Shaharyar Khan 

Former Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan has said Bob Woolmer never had full control of the national side, with skipper Inzamam-ul Haq being the unquestioned leader. 

There were a few confrontations (between Bob and his players), he said. But invariably Bob did not take umbrage at various players sulking or even addressing harsh words to him because theyd been left out or asked to go home from a series. 

Generally he had a very good relationship with the boys because he took so much trouble. 

Being a very gentle person, he would invariably go round and talk to the boys and ask why are you being harsh with me? Nearly always the boys came around. 

However, despite his good relationship with his squad, Shaharyar said he was never able to stamp his authority. 

He never really had full control of the team, either spiritual or cricketing, because this lay with the captain most of the time, he said. 

I kept telling him and Inzamam that for the team to succeed, both he and the team needed to be united and as one. Sometimes there was a little fraying of this. 

There was always a question mark regarding Bob taking total control of the team in every sense. 

There was resistance from Inzamam and perhaps successful resistance. Inzamam was the leader, the unquestioned leader of the team. 

They (the players) all fell in place around him and were totally supportive of Inzamam. Bob found it difficult sometimes. 

If he was giving advice that may not have been accepted by Inzamam, he sometimes found it difficult. Bob felt he should have had full control of the team but in fact he didnt. 

Shaharyar believes spot-fixing is commonplace but said he would be very surprised if whole matches are still being thrown. 

Spot-fixing is very much prevalent, he said. Spot-fixing is what is going to happen in the next over or in the first 10 overs of the innings. Will the next ball be a dot ball or a four? 

This is spot-fixing which you cant really prevent. Match-fixing requires the whole team. I would be very surprised if an entire team would be involved in throwing a match.

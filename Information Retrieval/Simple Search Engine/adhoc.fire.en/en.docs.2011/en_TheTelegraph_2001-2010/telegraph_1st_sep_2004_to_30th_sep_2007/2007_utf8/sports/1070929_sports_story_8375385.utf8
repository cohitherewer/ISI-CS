 Robin aims for total fitness 

Chennai: Team India fielding coach Robin Singh said he was happy to see success follow success with an improved fielding by Indian cricketers at the International level in the past few months. 

When pointed out that improvement in the fielding was visible and players had given him the total credit for it, Robin said: They must be enjoying. I must accept the appreciation of the players. Batting, bowling and fielding is the key to the success and I am happy working with players and see success follow success, he said. The former India player said he focused on total fitness and body and mind co-ordination while honing players skills for Tests, one-dayers and Twenty20 format. 

I attended to each player, improving his speed levels in running to gather the ball, picking it up from the ground and throwing back to both ends for run-out chances. Players were told how they could target the stump from every position in the field, he added. 

Robin said he had set a benchmark for each player and once they achieved it, they moved to higher levels. 

Asked if he was fully happy with the fitness and fielding levels of the players, Robin said there was always scope for improvement. 

The standards have certainly improved since I joined them. The goal is to make our players on par with everybody, including Australia.

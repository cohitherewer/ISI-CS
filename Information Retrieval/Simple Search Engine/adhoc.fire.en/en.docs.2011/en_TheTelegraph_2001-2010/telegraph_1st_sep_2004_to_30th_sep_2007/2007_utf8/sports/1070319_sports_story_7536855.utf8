 Inzy amp; Co. fined 

Bridgetown: World Cup organisers fined Pakistan for slow play following their shock three-wicket defeat by Ireland. ICC Match Referee Chris Broad imposed the fines after Inzamam-ul Haqs side was ruled to be four overs short of their target at the end of the match when time allowances were taken into consideration, a statement said. 

As captain, Inzamam was fined 50 per cent of his match fee for the breach. The others are each fined five per cent of their match fees for every over and so they were each 20 per cent out of pocket following the match. (Agencies)

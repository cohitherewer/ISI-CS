 Bedi blasts dictator BCCI

 Bedi 

New Delhi: Former captain and spin legend Bishan Singh Bedi has lambasted the BCCI for behaving like a dictator. 

Observing that the Board was behaving like a dictator and not as a democrat and that its attitude was sickening, the outspoken Bedi said he did not have a clue what made them press the panic button. 

After all, they (the ICL) are not giving guns and arms to the players! They are just asking them to play cricket Why the Board should lose sleep over it? Bedi said to a TV channel on Saturday. 

He said that the BCCIs hostility probably stems from the fear that the cash-rich rebel league may expose the Board. 

The former captain also rued the lack of unity among cricketers that, he felt, had paved the way for politicians, bureaucrats, lawyers and businessmen to run the game. 

Despite legal threats from Muttiah Muralidharans lawyer, Bedi stuck to his guns that the Sri Lankan off-spinner has a suspect action. 

Bedi recalled asking S. Venkatraghvan about the 1998 England versus Sri Lanka Test in which the offie had scalped 16 wickets and the former spinner-turned-umpire allegedly told him that there were 16 run-outs. (PTI)

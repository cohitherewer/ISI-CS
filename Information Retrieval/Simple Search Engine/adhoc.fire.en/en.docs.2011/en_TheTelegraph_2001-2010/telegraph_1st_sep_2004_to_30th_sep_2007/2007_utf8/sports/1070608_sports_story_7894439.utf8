Chennai: A great experience is how Sri Lankan Mahela Jayawardene described captaining Asia in Wednesdays Afro-Asia Cup opener in Bangalore. 

Speaking to The Telegraph on the morning-after, he

 said: Its an honour to lead a continent... I wont forget the experience of handing over the ball to such gifted bowlers from other countries... Or, for that matter, finalising a batting line-up with so many stalwarts... 

Jayawardene, who was instrumental in asking for Sourav Ganguly as his deputy, remarked that hed followed his India captaincy (March 2000-September 2005) with interest. 

Sourav was an aggressive captain... Thats something which couldnt be missed... He was good too... Last evening, there were occasions when we discussed bowling changes... It was nice having somebody with his experience around... 

Having won the first match, Jayawardene (winner of the ICCs inaugural Captain of the Year award last November) is focusing on the remaining two, to be played here back-to-back from Saturday. 

Jayawardene is accompanied by wife Christina, who has quit her job to be a regular companion for the next 12 months. They married in late 2005.

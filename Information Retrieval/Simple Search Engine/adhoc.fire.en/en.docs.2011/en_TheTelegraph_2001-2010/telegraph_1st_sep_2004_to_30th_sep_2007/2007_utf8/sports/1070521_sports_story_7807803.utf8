 Shevchenko not for 

 sale

London: FA Cup winners Chelsea expect to sell three players in the close season but they will not include Andriy Shevchenko or Michael Ballack, the clubs chief executive said on Sunday. 

Its not going to happen (selling Shevchenko and Ballack). We brought both these players in for three, four years, we didnt bring them in for a season and we knew fully well what their capabilities are and their prospects, Kenyon told BBC Radio. 

Im confident theyre going to be here as big players with Chelsea next season. 

Ukraine striker Shevchenko, who joined Chelsea from AC Milan for 30 million, and Germanys former Bayern Munich midfielder Ballack have failed to live up to expectations in the league, although both played roles in Chelseas FA Cup run. They feel they have a lot more to give. It takes time to settle in, said Kenyon. (Reuters)

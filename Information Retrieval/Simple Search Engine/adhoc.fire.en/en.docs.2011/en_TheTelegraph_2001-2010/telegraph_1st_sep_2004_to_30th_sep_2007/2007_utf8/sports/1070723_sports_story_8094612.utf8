 Mike Gatting lauds Kevin decision

 - Players like Pietersen and Flintoff are best kept away from captaincy

London: Former England captain Mike Gatting has appreciated Kevin Pietersens decision to make himself unavailable for Englands one-day captaincy. 

Pietersen did so after Michael Vaughan relinquished the job and there was speculation that he would get elevated. Eventually, Paul Collingwood got chosen. 

Players like Pietersen and (Andrew) Flintoff are best kept away from the captaincy They must not be burdened... They should just have the freedom to play their natural game Look at the way Pietersen played today (Sunday), Gatting told The Telegraph. 

In Gattings opinion, Vaughan probably stepped down after the selectors indicated he wouldnt fit into their one-day scheme of things after the World Cup. England did make the Super Eight, but fared poorly in that round. 

According to Gatting, Collingwood needs to learn. The selectors, I guess, have no choice but to stick with him Hes got to learn a few things 

Under Collingwood, England lost the recent ODIs to the West Indies 1-2.

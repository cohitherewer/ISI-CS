 Fifth gold for Phelps

 Michael Phelps 

Melbourne: Michael Phelps collected his fifth gold medal of the world championships as the US set a world record of 7:03.24 in the mens 4x200m freestyle relay final on Friday. 

Phelps combined with Ryan Lochte, Klete Keller and Peter Vanderkaay to wipe 1.42 off the previous record of 7:04.66 set by Australia at the 2001 World Championships in Fukuoka. 

Australia finished a distant second in 7:10.05 and Canada grabbed the bronze in 7:10.70. 

Phelps has won gold medals in each of the five events he has contested here, including four in world record time. 

Lochte set two world records on Friday after he broke Aaron Peirsols mark to win the 200 backstroke final. 

Lochte won in 1:54.32, to erase Peirsols mark of 1:54.44 set at last years Pan Pacific championships. Peirsol finished in 1:54.80. Markus Rogan of Austria earned the bronze.

 Aussies not invincible: Ranatunga

 Arjuna Ranatunga 

Melbourne: Former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga contends that the Australians invincible aura is more a myth than reality. 

He feels the world champions will crumble if put under pressure by quality opposition at the World Cup. 

Ranatunga said that on current form, only the Sri Lankans looked like being able to halt Australias unbeaten run at the tournament. 

He called on current Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene to follow the example set by the 1996 team that upset the Australians in the final to clinch the crown. 

They (the Autralians) play very hard when they get into the middle But I realised that when other teams retaliate, they panic. That is what happened in the 1996 World Cup final, Ranatunga said in a Sydney newspaper on Monday. 

Australia are very good on verbal things, but when we were shouted at we used to give something back. They realised we were a threat. None of the Australians has been put under pressure, with India and Pakistan going out, he said. 

Ranatunga believes Sri Lankas bowling attack is stronger nothan that of the 1996 team. Muttiah Muralidharan, Chaminda Vaas and Sanath Jayasuriya are the survivors of that side. 

He was, however, was not concerned about the batting, which he feels doesnt have much depth. 

Ranatunga said Muralidharan kept opposition batsman on their toes with his doosra and that made him more dangerous that Shane Warne was. 

Lanka coach Tom Moody echoed Ranatungas views and said the Aussies played a hard game, but dismissed criticism of their on-field behaviour. 

They have that aura. There is no question about that. They play a brand of cricket that is admired and respected. A lot of people call it bullying, but I would not call it that, he said.

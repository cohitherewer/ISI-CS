 Rohit upsets Barua

New Delhi: Delhis Nassir Wajih upset Grandmaster Abhijit Kunte while teenager Gogineni Rohit pulled off a creditable win over Dibyendu Barua in the seventh round of Parsvnath International Chess Tournament here on Friday. 

The 39-year-old Wajih completely outplayed Kunte, around 300 elo points above him, with white in the closed Sicilian game while Barua lost a long-stretched drawish game of 80 moves under time pressure at the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium. 

After top three boards witnessed drawn games, the lead position was once again shared by nine players GMs Alexei Dreev, Safin Shukhrat, Adley Ahmed, Deepan Chakravarthy, Neelotpal Das, Praveen Thipsay, International Master S. Arun, Rohit and Abhijeet Gupta with six points apiece.

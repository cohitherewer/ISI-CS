Melbourne: Former Australian Test bowler Geoff Lawson told local media on Monday that he had been appointed Pakistans coach. 

The 49-year-old said that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had contacted him on Sunday and confirmed he would be appointed as full-time successor to Bob Woolmer, who died of suspected heart failure during the World Cup in March. 

Its a challenge, said Lawson. I think its a wonderful challenge to have because they have such a talented squad and coming off that poor World Cup when they were beaten by Ireland and all things that accompanied it. 

When you look at the class of player they have youve just got to be excited in being involved with them. 

Lawson said he and his coaching staff would be going to Lahore in the next month to start the teams preparations for the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa in September. 

Lawson, who took 180 wickets in 46 Tests for Australia, has never coached before at international level. 

He beat two fellow Australians to the post, former Sri Lanka coach Dav Whatmore and the International Cricket Councils high performance manager Richard Done. 

The announcement came from the PCB after a meeting of the ad-hoc committee. Lawson has been preferred over the two other candidates, Whatmore and Done. He has initially been appointed for a two-year period, PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf told a news conference. 

 The board has decided to go along with Lawson as his appointment was backed by the players and also manager Talat Ali in recent meetings with the board chairman, a PCB source said last week. 

The players felt that Lawson had a very positive attitude towards the game and was an easy person to get along with. (REUTERS)

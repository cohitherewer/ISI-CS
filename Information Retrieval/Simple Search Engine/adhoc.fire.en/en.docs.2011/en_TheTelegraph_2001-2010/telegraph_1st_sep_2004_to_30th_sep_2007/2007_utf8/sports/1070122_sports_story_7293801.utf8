 Australia make it four in a row 

Sydney: Michael Clarke and Mike Hussey both benefited from missed chances to score half-centuries in Australias two-wicket victory over New Zealand in the fifth tri-series one-day International on Sunday. 

Clarke was dropped twice in his 75 and Hussey escaped a run out chance in an unbeaten 65 that guided Australia to their victory target of 219 with eight balls to spare. 

Australias win was their fourth from as many matches in the triangular competition that includes England and left New Zealand winless after the games. 

New Zealand got themselves into a position to threaten Australia but squandered their chance . Craig McMillan smashed 89 with the bat to help the Black Caps recover from a disastrous start and post a respectable score of 218 before the bowlers ripped through the Australian order to leave the world champions reeling at 77 for 4.

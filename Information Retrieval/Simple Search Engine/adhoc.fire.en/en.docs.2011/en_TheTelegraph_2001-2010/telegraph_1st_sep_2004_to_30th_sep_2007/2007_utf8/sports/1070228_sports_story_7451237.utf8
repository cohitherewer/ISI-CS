The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Want EB to be the best: Pereira 

 - We lost because we couldnt score: Chima 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Only a few days ago, Carlos Roberto Pereira was under immense pressure to keep his job. However, thanks to East Bengals more tolerant policy, he narrowly avoided the axe. On Tuesday, the Brazilian was laughing all the way and had reasons to do so too. 

His philosophy must have stopped him from interpreting the 1-0 win in the National Football League over Mohun Bagan as revenge for back-to-back losses in the CFL Premier Division. But Pereira admitted it was an important win if not the best during his span as East Bengal coach. 

We needed this win because it helped us go atop the table (for the first time). I want my side to be the best in the NFL and todays result gave us confidence to attain that goal, Pereira told a press conference after the match. 

There was so much talk about those defeats to Mohun Bagan. There was also pressure on me and some misunderstanding with the officials. I dont want to look back, but its a very important win for me and for my side, he added. 

He also refused to buy the suggestion that the absence of Bhaichung Bhutia and the early exit of Jose Ramirez Barreto in the match helped East Bengal. 

Dont forget I had to carry on without any foreigners for a long period. Besides, Alvito was also missed early in the season. Its the team which plays and which wins at the end of the day, Pereira remarked. 

Chima Okerie agreed. Barretos absence didnt affect us to a large extent. We lost because we failed to score, the Mohun Bagan coach said. 

The Nigerian, however, sees the future in PC Lalawmpuia amp; Co. Im a big fan of Arsene Wenger and his youth development policy, Chima said. 

I also gave my young players an opportunity today and Im pretty impressed with their overall show. Surajit Bose was impressive, Lalawmpuia was excellent. If these boys are willing to learn, they have a good future, he pointed out.

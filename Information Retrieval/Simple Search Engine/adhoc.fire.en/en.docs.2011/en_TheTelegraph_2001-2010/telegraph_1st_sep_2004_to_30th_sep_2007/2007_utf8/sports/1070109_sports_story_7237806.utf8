 He said he will talk with Italy coach Roberto Donadoni after the season. Right now Im only thinking about Roma, Totti said. 

 Rome: Sepp Blatter apologised to Italy on Monday for not awarding the team with the World Cup trophy.

 quot;History will say it was an error that the Fifa president did not award the Azzurri as world champions, and in effect it was an error, quot; Blatter said. quot;I had already apologised to Italian officials right after the final. quot;

 Blatter said his decision to skip the award ceremony after Italy beat France on penalties on July 9 in Berlin was planned before the game started.

 I wanted to avoid creating an ugly scene because the Germans had shown they would whistle at the word Fifa, Blatter said after arriving in Rome for a ceremony with the champions.

 But Helsingborg chairman Sten-Inge Fredrin made it clear they would not stand in Larssons way, telling Sky Sports: If Manchester want to have him for longer its up to Henrik.

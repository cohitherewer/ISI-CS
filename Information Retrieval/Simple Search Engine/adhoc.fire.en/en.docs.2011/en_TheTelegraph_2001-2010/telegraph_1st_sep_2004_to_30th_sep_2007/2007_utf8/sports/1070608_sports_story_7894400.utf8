The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Im proud of what Ive done: Becks

TIM RICH

 Michael Owen is hugged by David Beckham (left) and John Terry after scoring the third goal in their Euro qualifier against Estonia on Wednesday. England won 3-0. 

To steal the title of the first book written by Steve McClarens mentor, Sir Alex Ferguson, this was a light in the north. Not blinding, maybe not significant in the long term, but illuminating nonetheless. 

When the skies above Tallinn turned a smoky blue and pale orange, David Beckham provided the cross that Peter Crouch headed neatly home. McClaren, just then, may have reflected that his first press conferences as England manager was all about explaining why he had to move on from Beckhams age of fake gold. 

Now, his last one of the season was focused on the man who, the headlines would say, salvaged the job of the man who had spurned him. 

It is a neat Hollywood plot line, one that his friend and soon-to-be neighbour, Tom Cruise, may consider. In one sense, it is true; at 32, Beckham has something to offer England beyond shirt sales like Cruise, he is a better performer than his critics suggest. 

But McClaren would point out that in the long week in March when England trudged from Israel to Barcelona, injuries meant he had too many stand-ins. That his comeback has led to four goals in two matches poses as many problems at it solves, when Beckhams future lies in the concrete canyons and easy money of Los Angeles. 

Summer beaches are a time for reflection and McClaren said he would ponder the question, though he must know that nothing will have changed by the time England face Germany in August, except Beckhams bank balance. 

When hes playing like that, hes invaluable to us, McClaren said. He has been immense he has set up three of our four goals since he came back. Lets not talk about the future, let him enjoy the moment and go back to Real Madrid and win a medal. We havent turned the corner, and theres a lot still to prove, but there was a great feeling among the players after Beckham came back. 

If McClaren reflects at all on his summer beach, it will be that he has survived his first season in a job that, from the eastern shores of the Baltic to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, is recognised as the hardest sport has to offer. As Brian Clough was apt to remark, survive is all a football manager can reasonably hope to do. 

I would love to be in the next squad, Beckham said. Steve has made it clear that if I am performing and playing as I have been then I will be in the squad. I will definitely be at the European Championships. 

The Galaxy (by which he meant the football club in Los Angeles, rather than this part of the universe) will do everything possible to keep me playing for my country. Im proud of what Ive done, and I love playing football, said Beckham. 

Michael Owen, who received a cross from Beckham to score Englands third, hailed the performance. 

It was a cracking ball for my goal, Owen said. I think his quality is undoubted. Everyone knows hes probably the best crosser in the world. Hes got great vision. Hes a great passer of the ball and he has showed that again. 

However, the result changes little; there is a far more formidable Dutchman than Goes who stands in McClarens way in the bulky shape of Guus Hiddink. 

Wednesday night his Russia team emerged from the scene of McClarens greatest disappointment, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb, with a goalless draw. Had McClaren managed that, his light might burn a little stronger.

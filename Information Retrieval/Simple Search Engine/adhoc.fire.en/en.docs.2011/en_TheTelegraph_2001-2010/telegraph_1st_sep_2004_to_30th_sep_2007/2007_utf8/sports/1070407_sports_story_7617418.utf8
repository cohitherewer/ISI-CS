 Franklin lives in migraine fear 

 Sharp singles 

Georgetown: New Zealand seamer James Franklin was praying so that migraines do not afflict him again after he was forced out of a World Cup match this week because of one. Left-arm mediumpacer Franklin, 26, had to leave the field midway through the Super Eight match against Bangladesh on Monday in Antigua. He has suffered from migraines since he was 12, but said they had gradually occurred further apart. But he was concerned that he now had two attacks during matches in three months after experiencing one in Hobart in January. 

I get a blurred vision and then tunnel vision 20 minutes after that and then a headache that feels as though its going to split your head wide open. Its a little concerning, Franklin said on Thursday. I dont think scientifically anyone knows why they occur. 

I thought maybe it could come down to diet. Ive cut out a lot of caffeine and tried to be hydrated but I was hydrated the other day and it came from nowhere, he said.

Sympathetic Prince

Georgetown: South Africa middle-order batsman Ashwell Prince feels its harsh on sub-continent cricketers when they are subjected to attack after a major loss as has happened to India and Pakistan. Its tough on players, harsh on them when their houses are attacked. Its difficult for me to comment as our culture is different, remarked Prince, trying to draw a comparison with his teams fate after the debacles of 1999 and 2003 World Cups when players didnt face physical threat. 

Prince said the Proteas had the issues of their own to settle and were hoping rain doesnt come to disrupt their plans. 

Guys like Mark Boucher and Shaun Pollock havent had much of an impact, but thats because our top order has batted so well. Its also rained heavily here in recent days and I just hope that the game against Bangladesh on Saturday is not disrupted.

Afridis wish

 Karachi: With the Pakistan Cricket Board still to settle down on a candidate to succeed Inzamam-ul Haq, allrounder Shahid Afridi on Friday threw his hat in the ring, saying he would prove to be a good captain. Afridi, who has never led the senior team, said he had been captaining his domestic team for quite some time and was still to hear any complaint about his leadership skills. I think I have it in me to become a good captain. This is a big responsibility but also the ultimate dream of every player, Afridi said. That is why I would be willing to captain the senior team if the job is offered to me. It will be a big challenge for me and will make me a more mature player, he said.

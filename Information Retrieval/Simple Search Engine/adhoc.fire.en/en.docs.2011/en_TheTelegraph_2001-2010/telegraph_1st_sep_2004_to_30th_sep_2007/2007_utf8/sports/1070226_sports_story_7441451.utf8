The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Biswajit back in the hot seat

 - Mohammedan Sporting sack coach Bhowmick 

A STAFF EPORTER

Calcutta: Changing coaches seems to be the flavour of the season. 

Mohammedan Sporting on Sunday sacked coach Subhas Bhowmick on account of non performance. Biswajit Bhattacharya will again take charge of the beleaguered black-and-whites, who are languishing at the bottom of the National Football League (NFL) table. 

Just the other day, Mohun Bagan appointed Chima Okerie as coach in place of Robson. 

Explaining the sudden turn of events, Mohammedan Sporting secretary Sultan Ahmed said: We were compelled to remove Bhowmick after a string of poor performances in the Durand Cup, Federation Cup and NFL. 

For Biswajit, it is time to perform. I have been given a job and it is up to me to deliver the goods... My last stint (with Mohammedan Sporting) ended owing to personal reasons, but when this offer came along, I couldnt refuse, he said. 

Bhowmick was a little peeved with the way the situation was handled. 

They (the club officials) could have told me personally before announcing it to the media. However, as a professional, I have to take it in my stride, Bhowmick said.

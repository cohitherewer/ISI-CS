The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mahela left searching for his suitcase!

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Rajkot: Believe it or not, Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene spent around half-an-hour, from about 9.00 pm, searching for his suitcase which, as it turned out, was off-loaded by Jet Airways in Calcutta! 

The premier airlines image took a beating as a whole lot of baggage, mostly belonging to the Indian and Sri Lankan cricketers, was not put on Friday afternoons flight 9W 204 to Mumbai. 

As the baggage was through checked-in till Rajkot (9W 355 from Mumbai), nobody realised the fiasco till the teams landed here. The staff, apparently, had promised to only off-load kit bags and not suitcases. Yet, that was done. 

Besides quite a few players, even umpire Simon Taufels suitcase didnt arrive. What do I do till it comes? Remain in the same clothes? he asked the airline staff. 

This is a bit too much... How can personal suitcases and bags be taken off without informing the passengers... Its going to be a difficult night, a hassled Jayawardene told The Telegraph. 

The airlines duty manager here informed that the off-loaded baggage (probably 60 pieces) had been sent on a later Calcutta-Mumbai flight. From there, everything would be put on a late night Mumbai-Ahmedabad flight. And, after that, brought to Rajkot in the early hours of Saturday. 

Quite a journey and a lot of fingers were being kept crossed.

 Buzz over players reservations

 - Whatmore as Pak coach 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Dav Whatmore 

London: Its not confirmed, but the buzz is that the seniors who spoke to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman, Dr Nasim Ashraf, have expressed reservations over Dav Whatmore. 

The Australian is seen as the frontrunner for the Pakistan coachs job. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, seven seniors captain Shoaib Malik, vice-captain Salman Butt, former captains Mohammed Yousuf and Younis Khan, Shoaib Akhtar, Shahid Afridi and Abdul Razzaq met Dr Ashraf in Glasgow earlier this week. 

Apparently, the point they made is that the PCB shouldnt employ somebody whod been rejected by India. It seems they favoured another Australian, Geoff Lawson. 

Lawsons presentation had been impressive, but he doesnt have the experience of coaching a national team. Whatmore has coached Sri Lanka (twice) and Bangladesh. 

Besides Whatmore and Lawson, the PCB recently interviewed the International Cricket Councils high-performance manager, Richard Done. Hes not at all in the picture, though. 

The sources couldnt indicate the extent to which the PCB would respect the seniors wishes. The next coach is expected to be named around the middle of this month. 

Manager Talat Ali has been wearing an additional hat after Bob Woolmers death.

 Miandad: Too late to hold pep-talks

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Boards (PCBs) move to invite former greats for delivering pep-talks to the World Cup-bound players has not found favour from former captain Javed Miandad, who thinks its too late to organise such meetings. 

A PCB official confirmed that chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf had contacted greats like Imran Khan, Miandad and Wasim Akram to discuss preparations for the World Cup. Miandad confirmed that Ashraf had called him. 

I told him I am very busy and I will see if I can take time out to meet with the Pakistani players, said Miandad, who appeared in six World Cup tournaments including the one in 1992 when Pakistan emerged champions. 

But he made it clear that he was not keen to take up the PCB offer at present when Pakistan are moving from one crisis to another and their World Cup campaign appears to be in a bad shape. 

This is not the right time to do anything. I dont think any general pep-talk will make any difference. You can only help with particular problems in the team. They should tell me what they are inviting me for, he said. (PTI)

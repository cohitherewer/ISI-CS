St Georges: Scott Styris hit his fourth one-day century on Thursday to keep New Zealand in with a chance of winning their World Cup Super Eight match against Sri Lanka. 

Styris hit 111 not out while the rest of the key batsmen struggled badly after a disastrous start. 

Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah Muralidharan each took three wickets at the Grenada National Stadium to help limit New Zealand, who have been one of the form sides in the tournament, to 219 for seven off 50 overs. 

Styris moved to third on the list of tournament run scorers, having come in with his team at four for two after Vaas removed Stephen Fleming and Ross Taylor in the first three overs. 

Fleming had won the toss and chose to bat. But the decision looked to be a poor one when Vaas dismissed the New Zealand captain and Taylor on his way to figures of three for 33. 

Vaas had Fleming trapped leg-before for nought with the fifth ball of the day, moving above Indias Jawagal Srinath to take sole possession of third place in the list of all-time World Cup wicket-takers. 

Taylor, who had replaced Hamish Marshall after missing four matches because of a hamstring strain, followed for nought off the second ball he received. He got a thick edge to wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara, who took a one-handed diving catch low to his right. 

With Fleming having apparently misread the pitch, Sri Lanka were making light of the absence of pace bowler Lasith Malinga, sitting out after damaging left ankle ligaments in training. 

Fervez Mahroof replaced him and it was the only change from the team that edged England by two runs in Antigua last week. 

The Black Caps struggled to 18 for two from 10 overs and, in a bid to increase the pressure on the batsmen, Sangakkara stood up to the stumps with the pacemen still bowling. 

Styris, who took 20 balls to get off the mark, played himself in before plundering 10 off the 12th over by Mahroof. But Dilhara Fernando bowled a maiden for the next to restore order. 

Fulton had a let off on 22 at the start of the 16th over when he skied a shot from Mahroof straight to Mahela Jayawardene at midwicket. But the umpires called a no ball for overstepping. 

Styris responded by punching two fours off the same over. But the 67-run stand was broken in the 20th when Fulton tried to slog Vaas and Chamara Silva took the catch at deep square leg. 

Fulton had taken 52 balls for his 28, which included four 4s. Six runs later, Muralidharan tempted Craig McMillan into an attempted sweep that Silva easily gathered to remove him for one. 

Styris and Jacob Oram then added 64 for the fifth wicket. 

Muralidharan finished his 10 overs with three for 32 and has 15 victims in the tournament, joining Glenn McGrath and Malinga in the lead. 

With overs and support running out, Styris hit a four one of just 12 in the entire New Zealand innings to bring up his century off 152 balls. 

Styris and James Franklin brought up an unbroken 64-run partnership in 55 balls in a final burst that gave their team a chance of the victory that could send them to the semi-finals.

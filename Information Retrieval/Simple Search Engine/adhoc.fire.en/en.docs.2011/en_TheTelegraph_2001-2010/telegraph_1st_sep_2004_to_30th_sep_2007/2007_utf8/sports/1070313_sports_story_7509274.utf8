 Symonds still on road to recovery 

Basseterre: World champions Australia will select their team for Wednesdays opening World Cup match against Scotland from 14 players while allrounder Andrew Symonds continues to recover from a torn bicep muscle. 

Hes desperately trying to get out and do his work and be involved and obviously the team would like him to come through too, coach John Buchanan said. 

But right at the moment weve got 14 fit players and if Andrew comes right then weve got 15 and weve got a great asset there. 

Symonds ruptured a bicep tendon in his right shoulder during the teams tri-series loss to England last month. 

Buchanan said opener Matthew Hayden, who broke a toe in the third one-day International against New Zealand last month, was expected to play on Wednesday. 

I know he has set himself for Scotland so I think it would be unlikely that he wouldnt be available anyway, Buchanan said. (Reuters)

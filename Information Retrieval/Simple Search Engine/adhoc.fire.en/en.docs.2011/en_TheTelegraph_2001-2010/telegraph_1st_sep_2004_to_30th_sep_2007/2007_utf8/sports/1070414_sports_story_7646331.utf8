The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 England held back by fear, timidity 

Derek Pringle

It would not have felt much like win despite the pre-match pep talk from Sir Steve Redgrave. Rowing, Sir Steve will tell you, is mostly about hard slog, something Michael Vaughans team know all about, following their ungainly crawl to beat Bangladesh. 

They say you can tell more about the character of a team when it loses than when it wins. England didnt lose, but fear was writ large on every face as the batsmen turned a molehill into a mountain, chasing the 144 needed. They even had the best of the conditions, after winning the toss, though any advantage gets quickly forgotten when you are frightened to play a shot. 

The timidity at the top of the order is making England vulnerable. But is it batsmen like the recently returned Andrew Strauss who are at fault, or the strategy being imposed on them which is to eschew risk early on in order to keep wickets in hand for a surge at the end of the innings? 

I dont think there is a problem with our strategy. Its just that the players havent played that strategy very well, said Strauss. 

Since winning the Commonwealth Bank Trophy in Australia in February, Englands tactic with the bat is to take as little risk as possible and hope the opposition bottle it. As for pro-action, well, most players probably think it an energy drink. 

The excuse frequently trotted out is that England dont possess the player power to be aggressive at the start of an innings. Certainly we have no one with as savage a palette of strokes as Sanath Jayasuriya, but being bold is about batsmen taking themselves out of their comfort zones which is more about the mind than the stroke. 

Just look at South Africas Jacques Kallis. With a career strike-rate of 71 runs per hundred balls faced, Kallis is regarded by many as too correct to flay bowling attacks. Yet against West Indies on Tuesday, he upped his strike-rate to 94, smashing a quickfire 81. If Kallis, why not Vaughan, Strauss or Ian Bell? 

We recognise we havent fired as a unit and were disappointed about it and are trying to fix it, Strauss said. 

The glory equation is exactly what it was a few months ago in Australia, when four successive one-day wins stood between them and eternal ignominy, following their 5-0 defeat in the Ashes. They did it too, beating Australia three times and New Zealand once. 

Weve shown in the past that we can win four or five games on the trot and if we do that here well be world champions, said Strauss. 

Its a big if and they didnt look like world beaters against Bangladesh. Australia in 1999 and Pakistan in 1992 won World Cups after poor starts, but both sides had five or six world-class players capable of imposing their will on a game. On the evidence here, this England side has Pietersen. 

Their first link in that chain to the final is to overcome South Africa next Tuesday. If the pitch is as fast and bouncy as it was against Bangladesh, it promises to be a bruising encounter.

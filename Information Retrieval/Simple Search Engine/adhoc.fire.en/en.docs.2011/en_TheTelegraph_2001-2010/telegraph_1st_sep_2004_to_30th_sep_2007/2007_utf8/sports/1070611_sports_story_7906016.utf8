 Justines threepeat unites a family

 - I want to dedicate this victory to you... I missed you 

 JULIET MACUR in Paris

Standing on the battered earth of Roland Garros main court, another trophy in her hand, Justine Henin immediately knew this title would be sweeter than the rest. 

Henin, a tiny blonde Belgian, won her fourth French Open title, her third in a row, by defeating the Serbian teenager Ana Ivanovic 6-1, 6-2. But in Saturdays final, for the first time, she looked into the stands to see her brothers and sister looking back, smiling. At last, she could share this championship with them. 

For Henin, the emotions of seeing her family were too much to handle. After hitting a screaming forehand to end the match, she joyfully threw her racket in the air, then leaned over the net. She looked directly at her sister, Sarah, and brothers, David and Thomas, when she addressed the crowd. Until two months ago, her brothers had not seen her or spoken to her in seven years. 

I want to dedicate this victory to my family, Henin said. I missed you. I want to offer this victory to you. I love you with all my heart. 

With the victory, Henin became the first woman since Monica Seles in 1992 to win three consecutive French Open titles. But the day meant so much more for the 25-year-old Henin, whose mother died of cancer when she was 12. Her brothers and her father had been missing from her life, too. 

In 1999, Henin cut them out of her life, as she went one way and they went another, for reasons they want to keep private. On Saturday, they cheered her on. Her father, Jos, watched the match from his village in Belgium, too overwhelmed to be there in person. 

For years, her family had been a taboo topic, but now Henin talks freely about it, saying she is at peace. Everyone suffered a lot from the situation in the last few years, she said. And today, finally, we are united in this joy, and we can share this moment. 

While sipping a beer in the players lounge, Henins older brother, 33-year-old David, told how the family reconnected. In April, he was in a serious car accident and was in a coma for two days. Sarah, who had some contact with Justine, called her with the news. 

By the time David woke up, Justine was at his side. It caused an avalanche of pent-up emotions. The Henins realised it was a shame to remain apart, so they decided to rebuild their bond. 

It was very moving, said David Henin. It really boosted my morale. It was something horrible that turned into something good. 

The reconciliation came at a time when Henin needed her family the most. She had skipped the Australian Open after separating from her husband of four years, Pierre-Yves Hardenne. Heartbroken, she began to step back and evaluate the relationships in her life. 

Her coach, Carlos Rodriguez, said he had encouraged Henin to take that first step toward her family. 

I told her a lot of power and love comes from your family, so its the best for you to go back now, he said. Tennis is just a part of your life, not the entire thing. I told her to remember that. 

 On the court Saturday, the thousands of fans inside 

 Court Philippe Chatrier saw the new Justine Henin or, more 

 appropriately, the reborn Justine Henin. She looked distracted 

 at the start of the match, while the 19-year-old Ivanovic 

 came out fearless in her first Grand Slam final. She broke 

 Henin in the opening game and moved ahead, 40-0, on her 

 serve in the second. Then Ivanovic fell apart.

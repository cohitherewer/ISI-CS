The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 May 1 digest

Hayden 

in no 

hurry to 

retire 

Melbourne: Australian opener Matthew Hayden

 has ruled out retiring from international cricket for at least another year,

 saying he wants to help the team rebuild itself after the departure of legends

 like Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath. This side wants to stay together for a little bit longer. I think weve got a job to do within cricket just to try and set it up for the next stage of Australian cricket, he

 was quoted as saying by a daily. 

 Malinga a 

big hit

Colombo: They were not good enough with the

 bat or the ball and now it turns out that the men in blue are not good looking

 enough either to feature in a sexiest men in cricket poll. Neither did Mahendra Singh Dhonis long locks, nor Rahul Dravids

 charming looks impressed the fans, who, instead, chose Sri Lankan Lasith Malinga

 for his blond-streaked hair and tattooed arms, in a contest conducted by a

 Barbados magazine. 

With his eye-catching, blond-streaked curly hairdo, eyebrow ring and tattooed biceps, the unique 23-year-old strikes easy as the type who would be up for anything... And anywhere, was how the magazine described the flamboyant pacer, a local daily said.

Dunga 

rules out 

Ronaldo 

 Rio de Janeiro: Brazil coach Dunga has ruled striker Ronaldo out of the Copa America Cup in Venezuela, saying he wants to give a chance to other players. Ronaldo has not played for his country since Dunga took over following the World Cup last year but has enjoyed a new lease of life with AC Milan following his move from Real Madrid. 

He didnt play at the last Copa Americas so theres nothing new in this, Dunga told a Brazilian television channell.

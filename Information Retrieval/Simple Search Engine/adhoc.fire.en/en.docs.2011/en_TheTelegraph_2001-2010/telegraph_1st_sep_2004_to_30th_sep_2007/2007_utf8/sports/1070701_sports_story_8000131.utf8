 Ashraf to take players feedback on coach

 - Scotland weather not encouraging for Indo-Pak ODI 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Whatmore is set to get the job 

Glasgow: If inclement weather affected Team Indias build-up to the ongoing three-match series against South Africa, in Ireland, the news from Scotland isnt much better. 

It poured on Saturday and the forecast, one learns, isnt encouraging for the next couple of days either. As a local moaned: Weve had such an awful June... 

Unless the weather clears, theres trouble for the one-off Indo-Pak ODI here on Tuesday. The match is for the benefit of the Prince Charles-headed Princes Trust. 

The Pakistan team is already in Glasgow (a candidate-city for the 2014 Commonwealth Games), while the Indians are due on Monday. 

Meanwhile, the dapper Pakistan Cricket Board chairman, Dr Nasim Ashraf, will be taking feedback from the Shoaib Maliks before recommending the next coachs name to the all-powerful ad-hoc committee. 

The committee is scheduled to meet in Karachi on July 15. 

Im going to speak to the boys over the next day or two... After all, the coach has to work with them... For us, therefore, the players feedback is important... Dr Ashraf told The Telegraph on board a delayed British Airways flight from London. 

He confirmed that Australian Dav Whatmore was the frontrunner to succeed the late Bob Woolmer. Indeed, hes bound to get the call unless the players have strong reservations. 

By all accounts, thats unlikely. 

For the time being, manager Talat Ali is wearing the coachs hat as well.

 Borde, Venkat among 6 invitees

Mumbai: Chandu Borde and Srinivas Venkatraghavan are among the six former captains who have been invited here on April 6 to guide the BCCI on revitalising the national team after the dismal World Cup outing. 

The four other ex-skippers invited to the all-important meeting at the BCCIs newly-built headquarters are Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, Ravi Shastri and Krishnamachari Srikkanth.` 

We will first meet captain Rahul Dravid, coach Greg Chappell and manager Sanjay Jagdale (also a national selector) before having the discussion with the six former captains, said secretary Niranjan Shah Wednesday. 

The BCCIs all-powerful working committee is to meet the next day to take a final call on the matter, including appointment of a new coach in case the members decide not to renew the contract of Chappell. 

The players contracts are also expected to come up for discussion at the working committee meeting. It would be interesting to see the outcome of this contentious issue between the players and the BCCI following the disaster in the West Indies.

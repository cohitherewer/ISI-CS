 Lawsons top priority is tour of India

 Lawson 

Karachi: New Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson says his main priority is to get his talented but inconsistent side to improve their performances in away series and boost their Test ranking. 

Pakistan are due to host South Africa in September and October and tour India in November-December to play three Tests and five one-day Internationals. They host world champions Australia early next year. Pakistan also host Zimbabwe in the coming months. 

It has always been difficult for Pakistan to show their true worth in an away series. As the Test series against India would be the first away one for me I want to prepare a Pakistan team fully capable of standing up to the challenge, he told an English daily. 

The former Australia seamer has been appointed on a two-year contract by the Pakistan Cricket Board and is due to arrive in Lahore on August 15 to take charge of his team. 

Lawson was a surprise choice, beating the experienced Dav Whatmore to the post. 

With a bit of more technical help, Pakistan can perform even better, he said. 

What I need is time and space. I think that a truly talented team like Pakistan could be guided to the place that has been waiting for them for years, Lawson added. 

He said Pakistan have the capability of beating the No. 1 team in the world any time and anywhere if they play to their true potential. 

Obviously, it is Test cricket that comes ahead of every other version of the game. What I want is to see Pakistan as the best Test-playing nation in the world, he added. 

Test cricket shows the true worth of a team. Pakistan players have all the guts and quality to rule the world in Test cricket. What they need is proper guidance and coaching. 

On the upcoming World Twenty20 Cup in South Africa, Lawson said it would be nothing less than a Test for every team as it was being held for the first time. 

Whoever holds the nerves will perform better. For Twenty20 cricket you need a good bowling combination and there is no dearth of that in Pakistan, he said. 

Lawson said he was already communicating with Pakistan team doctor Dr Riaz Ahmed and chalking up a fitness plan for the players. 

I am in touch with the team trainer, Dr Riaz, who is a qualified and professional trainer. He is already doing a good job. We would try not to expose the leading players too much to international cricket.

 PCB chief: He was to give up coaching

Karachi: Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer had decided to announce his retirement from coaching after the 2007 World Cup to settle down in Cape Town. 

Dr Nasim Ashraf, who tendered his resignation as Pakistan Cricket Board chairman after the teams debacle in the ongoing World Cup, revealed that Woolmer had sent him an e-mail on the morning of his murder on Sunday. 

On the morning after we lost to Ireland, Woolmer had sent me an e-mail (dated March 18) in which he also expressed great disappointment over the stunning defeat. But he still believed his boys tried their best and fought till the last to make the most of the match, Dr Ashraf was quoted as saying in a Pakistan daily. 

Woolmers e-mail said: I would like to praise my association with the Pakistan team but now I would like to announce my retirement after the World Cup to live the rest of my life in Cape Town. 

As I was on the tour of interior Sindh from Sunday, I could not check my e-mail and it was only on Thursday that I saw the message from Woolmer, he said. (PTI)

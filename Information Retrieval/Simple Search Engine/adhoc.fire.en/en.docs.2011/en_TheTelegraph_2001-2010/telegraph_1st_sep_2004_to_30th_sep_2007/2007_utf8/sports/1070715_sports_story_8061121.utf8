 Yousuf wants to play

Karachi: Twenty-20 may be seen as more suited to young and upcoming players, but Pakistans senior batsman Mohammed Yousuf thinks otherwise and is keen to play in the inaugural world meet in South Africa this September. 

Whether it is a Test, one-day International or a twenty20, I am always proud to represent my country at the top level, Yousuf said on Saturday. 

As a professional you are supposed to perform in every level of the game. I have never had a pick and choose policy when it has come to playing for the country, Yousuf said. 

Although Yousuf and other seniors like Abdul Razzaq have been named in the preliminary squad for the tournament, their selection in the final 15 remains doubtful. 

I want to play every form of the game. Test cricket is the real challenge, but you cant deny that twenty20 is gaining in popularity. (PTI)

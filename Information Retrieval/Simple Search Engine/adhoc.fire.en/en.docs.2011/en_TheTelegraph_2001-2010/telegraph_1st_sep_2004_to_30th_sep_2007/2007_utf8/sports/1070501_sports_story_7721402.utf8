 Eto plays the saviour

Madrid: A solitary strike from Samuel Eto gave Barcelona a nervy 1-0 win over lowly Levante at the Nou Camp on Sunday to keep them top of the Primera Liga with six games remaining. 

The defending champions have 62 points but are still closely pursued by Sevilla (61) and Real Madrid (60), who both looked far more convincing in their respective wins. 

Sevilla shrugged off any doubts that the pressure might be getting to them with a 3-1 home win over Espanyol. 

Real thumped Bilbao 4-1 at San Mames to make it 10 wins on the road for Fabio Capellos side. David Beckhams early free kick allowed Sergio Ramos to head the first goal and Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy added two more, taking his tally for the season to 18. 

Bilbao committed men forward and pulled one back through Fernando Llorente late on, before substitute Guti scored a breakaway goal to leave the Basque side two points above the bottom three. 

Valencia are fourth with 56 points after a Joaquin double gave them a 2-0 home win over Recreativo Huelva on Saturday. 

In England, Arsenal striker Emmanuel Adebayor plunged Fulham deeper into relegation zone as his late goal set up a 3-1 win over Lawrie Sanchezs struggling side. 

Fulham had looked set to snatch a crucial point when Simon Davies neutralised Julio Baptistas early strike at the Emirates Stadium. But Adebayors sublime strike left Fulham heartbroken and Gilberto Silva rubbed salt into their wounds with a penalty in the final moments on Sunday.

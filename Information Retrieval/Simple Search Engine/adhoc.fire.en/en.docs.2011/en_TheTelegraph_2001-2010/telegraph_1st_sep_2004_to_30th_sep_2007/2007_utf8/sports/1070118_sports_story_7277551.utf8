 Moin Khan held for assaulting wife

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain and wicketkeeper Moin Khan was arrested for allegedly assaulting his wife, police said on Wednesday. 

Moin was arrested by the Darakshan police in the upmarket Clifton area in the wee hours of Tuesday after a fight with his wife. 

His wife called us up on the police emergency number and reported that she was being assaulted by her angry husband, police said. 

His wife called up the police emergency number and alleged her husband was drunk and beating her, inspector Zia-ul Hasan said. 

He was released on bail by a judicial court but his wife has not withdrawn charges against him, Hasan said, adding he was also sent to a local hospital for related tests. 

Moin, who played 69 Tests and 219 ODIs as a wicketkeeper-batsman, was released on bail later. The cricketer-turned-commentator told reporters later that the entire matter had been blown out of proportion. 

It is a family matter and something between a husband and a wife. Hopefully, it will be sorted out in a proper and legal manner soon, Moin said. I just want everyone to allow privacy to my family so that we can resolve this problem. 

He also made it clear he had done nothing intentionally and it was an accident and his wife had panicked. Everyone knows the sort of person I am, I just want my fans and well-wishers to pray everything works out well for my family, he added. 

Moin and Tasleem have been married for over 10 years and have three children.

 Dwayne has to build on it: Lara 

Kingston: West Indies captain Brian Lara said he expected more of the same from allrounder Dwayne Smith after he led his side to a 54-run win over Pakistan in the World Cup opener at Sabina Park. 

MoM Smith helped his team reach a competitive total of 241 for nine with his innings of 32 in just 15 balls, including two towering sixes. He then turned the match once more with the ball when he claimed three for 36 from his full quota of 10 overs. Pakistan were bowled out for 187. 

Smith began his international career in sparkling style with a century on his Test debut in South Africa but over the three years since he has been inconsistent. 

Lara urged the 23-year-old Smith to build on his latest show of potential rather than dwell on his success. Dwayne played really well today, Lara told reporters after the match. At one time before he went out to bat we were looking at 225, I told him that. 

For him to score in excess of 30 in 15 balls, hitting the ball out of the park and cleanly was very, very good for us. Coming on to bowl after Daren Powell, after we had stifled the run rate in the early overs, you expect them to pick up the run rate from there. 

But Dwayne came on and bowled well and got the wickets of Inzamam and Mohammed Yousuf their two best players. 

His performance today was excellent and he knows that and from here what he wants to do is build on it, not just sit back and think Ive started well and thats it. Weve hopefully got 10 or 11 games in the tournament and he is looking for a performance like that every time. 

Inzamam-ul-Haq blasted his batsmen for failing to complete a moderate run chase. Pakistan started poorly when they lost their first three batsmen Imran Nazir, Younis Khan and Mohammad Hafeez with just 39 runs on the board. 

When a patient but promising stand of 60 between him and Mohammed Yousuf ended, Pakistans chances of a win evaporated. We should have got those runs, Inzamam said. I think 242 was a gettable score. We thought we could have chased those runs and we should have chased those runs. 

Now we have to take the pressure and strive to do well in the remaining matches, he said. Yousufs wicket was crucial but we lost three quick wickets (at the start) and we could have done well if we had more wickets left at the end. 

Inzamam rejected claims that he made the wrong decision after winning the toss and electing to bowl. 

He also defended the bowlers, even though they allowed No. 8 batsman Dwayne Smith to score 32 from 15 balls. Pakistan conceded more than 50 runs in their last five overs. 

The decision as far as the toss was concerned was fine and the bowlers did a good job, Inzamam said. We just didnt chase properly enough and West Indies bowled a good line and length.

 THE No.1 SEED

 ROGER 

 FEDERER

 Instead of reeling off statistics 

 on the man touted to be one of the greatest tennis players 

 of all time, lets just put things in perspective. 

 The legendary Bjorn Borg said recently that nothing would 

 make him happier than to see his record of five straight 

 Wimbledon titles being equalled by the man called Roger 

 Federer. Much like the Ice-Borg, Federer has 

 a calm, almost ghost-like movement on court that belies 

 his amazing athleticism. By his standards, though, 2007 

 has not been a great year for the indomitable Swiss. Wimbledon 

 would be a homecoming for Federer. It is the tournament 

 he has won four straight times, a veritable melting pot 

 of tradition and class, and who classier than Roger to stake 

 his fifth claim?

 RAFAEL NADAL

 For every Roger Federer, there 

 is one Rafael Nadal! A perfect antithesis to the world No.1 

 on court, this world No.2 from Mallorca is as excitable 

 as Federer is calm, as fist-pumpingly energetic as the Swiss 

 is tranquil, as dominant on clay as Federer isnt and 

 as ineffective on grass as the world No.1 is regal. In 2005, 

 the man in sleeveless shirts and a pair of capris announced 

 his arrival by beating Federer in the semis and Mariano 

 Puerta in the final of Roland Garros to become the seventh 

 to win a Grand Slam in his first appearance. His last two 

 have come at the expense of the indomitable Swiss. A win 

 at Wimbledon would be the perfect icing on the cake.

 JUSTINE HENIN

 I am now in control of my life, said the numero uno Belgian 

 recently. She should know. After the trauma of a marriage 

 gone awry, and a lay-off from tennis induced by it, it takes 

 extraordinary courage and mental strength to come back to 

 the court and start winning. And that is exactly what Justine 

 Henin has done. Even though she has gone on record saying 

 that The Championships is not No.1 on her priority list, 

 it doesnt follow that her opponents can expect anything 

 less than a perfect allround game and a true professional 

 approach. Easily the best female player on clay by a distance, 

 it remains to be seen whether she musters enough motivation 

 to lift the sole Grand Slam title missing from her cabinet.

 MARIA SHARAPOVA

 She may run out of toilet papers occasionally, but never 

 a shot on the court. If her looks dont hunt you down, 

 the grunts will with some power tennis to boot. 

 She has two Grand Slam titles to boast of Wimbledon 

 (2004) and the US Open (2006) and has also been 

 the highest paid female athlete in 2006, earning more even 

 than the all-conquering Roger Federer. That should tell 

 us something about tennis undisputed glamour girl. 

 But behind all that chic and haute couture, lies a player 

 of enough steel to dominate the No.2 spot in WTA rankings. 

 The current year has been an ordinary one for Sharapova. 

 Maxims Hottest Female Athlete for four consecutive 

 years will no doubt try to prove shes even hotter 

 on the wet grass of SW19. She did it in 2004, will she manage 

 it again this year?

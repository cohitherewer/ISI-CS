The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Watch Ireland, 

 says Bopara 

 SHARP SINGLE

 Georgetown: 

 Rookie allrounder Ravi Bopara insists England need to be 

 at their very best in the tricky World Cup Super Eight clash 

 against neighbours Ireland. They have been playing 

 some good cricket. Ive been watching a few of their 

 games and they look a good side, said the 21-year-old 

 Essex player ahead of the Providence Stadium clash here 

 on Friday.

 Theyve already proved 

 they can beat some of the top sides in the world and the 

 main thing for us is to be on top of our game when we face 

 them. We may be expected to win, but we all know that cricket 

 doesnt work like that.

 Trent confident 

 Georgetown: Ireland captain 

 Trent Johnston was confident he would be fit to play against 

 England in their Super Eight clash on Friday. The Australian-born 

 Johnston, the teams most influential player as seam 

 bowler and hard-hitting lower-order batsman, has been struggling 

 with a shoulder injury and missed the group match against 

 hosts West Indies last Friday. He only started bowling again 

 on Tuesday after having a cortisone injection in his left, 

 non-bowling shoulder four days ago.

 Im hundred per cent 

 sure that Im going to play, though the physio is 70 

 per cent sure, Johnston said.

 Andys advice 

 Melbourne: West Indies 

 fast bowling great Andy Roberts has asked Australia not 

 to tamper with Shaun Taits raw action 

 and be careful with the pacer for the good of world cricket. 

 Roberts, who on Tuesday watched Tait in Australias 

 World Cup clash against the West Indies at Sir Vivian Richards 

 Stadium, where he is the curator, said, He does have 

 a raw action but I like it. No one should interfere with 

 anyones natural action. Just let him be. If you do 

 that with someone who is bowling fast, that will stop him 

 from bowling fast. 

 Guyana vow

 Georgetown: Guyana will 

 put on a World Cup to remember despite a catalogue of problems 

 with the brand new Providence Stadium here, the local organising 

 committee chief executive Karan Singh has said. We 

 will show the people that we will have top-class cricket 

 here, Singh said before the first match at the new 

 venue.

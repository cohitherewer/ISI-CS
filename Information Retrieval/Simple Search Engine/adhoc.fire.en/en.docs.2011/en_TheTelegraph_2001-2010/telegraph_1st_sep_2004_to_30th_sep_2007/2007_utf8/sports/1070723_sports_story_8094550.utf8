 Claret jug for Harrington 

 - Irishman beats Garcia in play-off 

VICKI HODGES

Padraig Harrington claimed victory at the British Open by defeating Sergio Garcia in a four-hole play off as Carnoustie again threw-up a dramatic finale. Garcia had come agonisingly close to winning his first major when his 10-footer for the claret jug lipped out at the 72nd and last hole. 

But it was Harrington who took charge of the ensuing play-off grabbing what proved to be a decisive two-stroke lead at the first with a birdie to Garcias bogey. 

The 35-year-old Irishman was in no mood to let his advantage slip and after both men had parred the next two holes, he came to the 18th and last with a two-stroke advantage. 

Harrington played it safe laying up in two and forced Garcia to go for a birdie that he failed to do settling for a par. The Irishman then calmly sunk a three-footer to clinch the biggest win of his career. 

Harrington is the first European to win a major since Paul Lawrie triumphed the last time the Open was held in Carnoustie (1999). He is also the first Irishman to win the Open in 60 years, since Fred Daly at Hoylake. 

Garcias long wait for a first win in a major goes on having led the field by three strokes going in to the final day. 

Harrington started the day tied for third, six strokes adrift of the Spaniard, but three birdies on the front nine put him firmly in contention as Garcia struggled. Garcia bounced back to level with back-to-back birdies at the 13th and 14th making it a two-horse race. 

Harrington took a one shot lead into the 18th but looked to have blown his chances as twice he plunged his ball into the Barry Burn that winds down the 18th hole and across the front of the green for a double bogey six. 

Garcia, needing a par at the last to win his first major, sent his approach into a bunker and then watched in agony as his 10-footer for the trophy lipped out of the hole to force a play-off. 

Both had finished the 72 holes with seven-under totals of 277, Garcia closing with a 73 to Harringtons 67. 

Third place, a further shot back, went to unheralded Andres Romero of Argentina who had an eagle, 10 birdies and two double bogeys in a remarkable round of 67. 

Ernie Els (69) and Richard Green of Australia (64) shared fourth place on five-under. 

 Tiger Woodss hopes of staging 

 an unlikely comeback from eight behind the lead were quickly 

 dashed. He grabbed early birdies at the third and fourth, 

 but bogeys at the eighth and 11th put paid to his chances 

 of becoming just the second man in 125 years to win three 

 straight Opens.

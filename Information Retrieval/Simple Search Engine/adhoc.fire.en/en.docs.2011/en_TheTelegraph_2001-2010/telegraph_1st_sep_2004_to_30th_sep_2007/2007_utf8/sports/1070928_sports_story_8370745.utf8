 Rajput stays; Rohit in

New Delhi: Lalchand Rajput, who was Indias cricket manager during their ICC World Twenty20 campaign, retained his post for the upcoming ODI series against Australia. 

The BCCI decided to continue with Rajput as an interim arrangement for the seven-match series beginning on Saturday, according to a press release issued by secretary Niranjan Shah. 

Team India have had interim cricket managers for all series since coach Greg Chappell opted not to have his contract extended after the World Cup debacle. 

Ravi Shastri and Chandu Borde had performed the duty on the tours of Bangladesh and the UK, respectively. 

Rohit Sharma, meanwhile, has been named as replacement for injured leg-spinner Piyush Chawla in the one-day squad for the first three ODIs in Bangalore, Kochi and Hyderabad. 

The decision was taken by the national selection committee which met Thursday to choose the Rest of India squad for the Irani Cup against Mumbai in Rajkot from October 6-10. 

Chawla is out of cricket for six weeks after being injured in South Africa during the World Twenty20 meet. (PTI)

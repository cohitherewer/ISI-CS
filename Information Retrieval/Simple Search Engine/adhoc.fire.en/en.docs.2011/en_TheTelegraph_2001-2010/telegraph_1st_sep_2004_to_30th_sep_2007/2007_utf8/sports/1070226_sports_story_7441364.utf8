 Musharraf gives pep talk 

Karachi: The Pakistan players would be richer by Rs 50 lakh each if they manage to win the World Cup in the West Indies. 

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has announced the cash bonuses to motivate the players. 

If they win the final, they will get five million rupees each. For reaching the final they get 2.5 million each and 1.2 million for the semi-finals, PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf said. 

The announcement meant that Pakistani players can earn Rs 7.5 crore if they become world champions for the second time. 

Ashraf made the announcement at a function at Lahores Gaddafi Stadium Saturday, which was attended, among others, by Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf. 

Musharraf asked the team to put the disappointments of the South African tour behind them and said the players had the talent to defeat any side. 

What is needed is determination and right approach to go into the field with a positive mind. If our players remember that, they can defeat their opponents no matter how strong or top ranked, Musharraf said. 

Musharraf also reposed full confidence in the captaincy of Inzamam-ul Haq and said he was confident of the team doing well under him. 

If we analyse the performance of our team during the past three years it shows an upward trend, barring the performance in South Africa, and we must not get disappointed with the results produced in the last tour (South Africa) and start afresh, Musharraf said. 

He also reminded that great teams do not lose hope. 

If the team goes into the arena with lost hope they cannot perform up to a high level, and if they have the will and determination, they can fight back no matter what circumstances they go through, he said.

 Pak to send Daniel Pearl investigator

Karachi: A high-profile Pakistani investigator, who led the probe in the kidnapping and murder case of US reporter Daniel Pearl, will travel to Kingston to look into the death of Bob Woolmer. 

Mir Zubair Mahmood will be assisted by Kaleem Imam, an additional director of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), in the case and the duo is expected to fly out Wednesday. 

But Zubair made it clear that Kaleem and he were going to Kingston to help with their expertise, if required. Their initial role will be that of observers. 

Zubair said how much they could be involved in the Woolmer case depended entirely on the cooperation that would be extended by the Jamaican authorities. 

We are going there to basically assist them. That is our agenda. But that also depends entirely on their response. I think our primary task will be to keep our government and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) informed of any progress in the case, Zubair said. 

Meanwhile, rejecting the aconite-poisoning theory for now, Jamaica police have said that their investigation will continue to focus on the manual strangulation angle until forensic evidence comes out, suggesting otherwise. (PTI)

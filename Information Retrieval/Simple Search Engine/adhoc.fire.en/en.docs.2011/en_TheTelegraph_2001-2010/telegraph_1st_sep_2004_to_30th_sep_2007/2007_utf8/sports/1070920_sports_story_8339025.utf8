 Sri Lanka blow away Bangla

Johannesburg: Sri Lanka restricted Bangladesh to 83 all out to win their ICC World Twenty20 Super Eight match by 64 runs in Johannesburg on Tuesday. 

Chasing 148 for victory, Bangladeshs batsmen froze on a sluggish pitch and were swept away in 15.5 overs in the group F match. 

Dilhara Fernando took two for 21 in a fast and furious display with the new ball and Chaminda Vaas two for 14 in four tight overs for Sri Lanka. 

Aftab Ahmed and Shakib al-Hasan were joint top-scorers for Bangladesh with 18 runs apiece but the rest of the batting order were exposed for a lack of skills under pressure. 

Slow left-armer Sanath Jayasuriya picked up the last two wickets as he joined the attack in the 14th over.

 Stop the foreign invasion: Zola

 - In England, teams can now spend But you have to find a balance

Some memories remain as gleaming and as eternal as a diamond. During his sparkling stay at Chelsea, Gianfranco Zola, that special envoy from the court of Calcio, left a spellbound English audience with some precious memories. 

The mesmerising dribble through Manchester Uniteds defence in his first season at Stamford Bridge. The near-post back-heel in the FA Cup against Norwich in 2002. Some memories. 

On Tuesday, Zola pulled up a chair in the Italian Under-21s hotel, where he is enhancing his coaching credentials as technical consultant, and politely eschewed the offer to wander self-indulgently down memory lane. 

He wanted to talk about the present and the future, and specifically the need for the Premiership to introduce a quota on foreign players to assist England. 

Advising the English on the need to cut back on imports may sound strange emanating from a Sardinian voted Footballer of the Year while lighting up the Bridge, but Zola was always more missionary than mercenary. Such is his affection for England that it pains him to see the Three Lions struggle. 

Quietly but cogently, Zola argues that Premiership clubs must pour some of their immense TV riches into player development, as well as recruiting the latest pin-up from World Soccer. 

Giuseppe Rossis presence in the Italian party, which collides with England at the European Under-21 Championship on Thursday, indicates that even the fabled English talent factories, like Manchester United, are polishing imported gems. 

Money has changed the English footballing landscape. 

When you have a big budget you can buy big players, and that makes the level of the game better, Zola began. It was like that in 1982 after we won the World Cup in Spain. People started to invest money and all the big players started to come to Italy. 

In England, the teams can now spend and those players take the level of the league up. But you have to find a balance. Bringing in too many foreign players is not always the right thing to do. 

The best years in Italian football were the end of the 1980s and the start of the 1990s. Every year we had finalists in all the European competitions. One of the reasons is because we only were allowed three foreigners per team. They were the best in the world and it was a perfect balance because the core of the team was Italian. That is a very important thing to look after because it allows the young players to come through as well as taking the levels up by having a few foreign players. 

As well as growing their own, Zola believes the English need to foster a different attitude, becoming more adept at handling pressure. 

Sometimes your England players do not give it their best shot. That was particularly the case last summer at the World Cup. The players were afraid of the media. The pressure was too much for the players. When you play you really dont need that much pressure. You want to play off the cuff. 

If you look at the Italian teams through history, the amount of pressure they carry is huge, but it brings the best out of them. The pressure last summer was huge because of what was happening in the Serie A referee-fixing scandal] but the players made it work in their favour. 

In attitude, Italian teams could teach many other countries a lot of things, including England. Last summer the pressure was huge but they got together, they focused and they gave it everything and won the World Cup. 

Zolas wise words were echoed by Rossi. The Italy players at the World Cup and AC Milan players in the European Cup did feel pressure in trying to give a certain example on the pitch of how Serie A is played, observed Rossi, his accent betraying formative years in New Jersey.

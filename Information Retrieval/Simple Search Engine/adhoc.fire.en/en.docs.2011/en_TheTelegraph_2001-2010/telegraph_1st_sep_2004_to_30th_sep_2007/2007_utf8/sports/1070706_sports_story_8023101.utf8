 Putin helps Sochi bag 2014 Games

Guatemala City: The Black Sea resort of Sochi, boosted by the personal intervention of Russian president Vladimir Putin, won the right to stage the 2014 Winter Olympic Games on Wednesday. 

Putin came to Guatemala to address the International Olympic Committee session and his polished performance, in English, French and Spanish, wooed members who responded by awarding the Games to Sochi by just four votes. 

Sochi gained 51 votes to upset favourites Pyeongchang of South Korea who took 47 votes in the second round of the ballot. 

The third candidate, Salzburg of Austria had been eliminated in the first round with 25 votes behind Pyeongchang on 36 and Sochi on 34. 

The Russian delegation erupted in elation after IOC president Jacques Rogge opened the envelope to announce the winning bid. 

Putin, who had left the session before the vote to return to Moscow, called from his plane. He was excited and he congratulated each and every one of us, said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zhuchov. 

Sochi had started the bid as outsiders as none of their venues have yet been built. But they made up ground with a slick campaign and Putins support may ultimately have been the final ingredient for success. 

Rogge said Putins presence in Guatemala had been important. This is very reassuring for the IOC, he said. It shows the support of the government authorities which is very, very important. (Reuters)

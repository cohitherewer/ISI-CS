 Bhutia praises Chhetri

New Delhi: The continuing dominance of foreign players in domestic football is not detrimental to the game and the development should be seen in a positive manner, Bhaichung Bhutia has said. 

As in previous domestic seasons, foreigners ruled the roost, bagging the top four spots in the goalscorers list. Bhutia said the Indian players needed to work harder to catch up with them. 

There is no lack of opportunities for Indian players. The foreigners are not snatching anything away from them. Indians need to create opportunities through hard work, Bhutia said. 

Among the players in the domestic league, JCT striker Sunil Chhetri impressed Bhutia. Chhetri was the highest goal-scorer among Indians in the NFL with 12 strikes. Bhutia netted five for Mohun Bagan. 

Chhetri has a lot of potential, he said. (PTI)

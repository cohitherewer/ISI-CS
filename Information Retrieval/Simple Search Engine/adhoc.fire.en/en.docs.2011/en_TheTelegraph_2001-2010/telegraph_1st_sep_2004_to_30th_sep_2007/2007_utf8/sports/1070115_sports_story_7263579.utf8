 Mahindra rout Bagan 4-1 

 - NATIONAL LEAGUE

 Bhaichungs early strike of no avail 

 Yakubu scored a brace against Mohun Bagan 

Mumbai: Defending champions Mahindra United thrashed Mohun Bagan 4-1 in an action-packed marquee encounter of the 11th National Football League at the Cooperage ground on Sunday. 

The local giants took a commanding 3-1 lead against the Federation Cup winners at half-time and then hammered the final nail in the visiting teams coffin in the dying minutes of the match to emerge deserving winners. 

Most of the galmouth action in the tie, watched by the best crowd of the season, came in a 20-minute period of the opening session with Mahindra storming their way back into the match after being stunned by a superb headed goal by Bhaichung Bhutia in the 16th minute. 

Mahindra, spurred on by their supporters, mounted raids at frequent intervals and were 3-1 up after a thrilling 13-minute period via goals from Pomeyieh Mensah (24th) and Yusif Yakubu (28th and 34th). 

Crossing over with a handy lead, Mahindra soaked up the pressure applied by Mohun Bagan who went on the offensive but in vain in splendid fashion before substitute striker Abhishek Yadav applied the finishing touch with an inch-perfect header to complete the rout. 

The victory put Mahindra on seven points from three ties while Mohun Bagan remained stationary on one from the same number of matches. 

Bagans next clash is against Mumbais Air India on January 20 while Mahindra take on Sporting Clube de Goa here on January 22. 

The Man of the Match for Mahindra was easily their half-line force K. Ajayan who, time and again, came up with superb passes while supporting his defence too. 

Ajayan chipped the ball into the goalmouth for the Ghanaian import Mensah to head it in for the equaliser and then created panic in the Bagan defence through another goalmouth centre that resulted in Mahindras second goal. 

Defender Deepak Mondal unsuccessfully tried to clear the ball in a hurry with Yakubu lurking close by and the ball went in off the Ghanaians chest. 

Earlier, Mahindra fell into arrears when Bhaichung, left free briefly inside the box by the Mahindra back four, rose high to meet the chip sent in by Surajit Bose from the right to give Bagan the lead. 

But neither Bhaichung nor Bagans other high-profile striker Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto could do anything out of the ordinary after this early success as the Mahindra defenders effectively policed them. 

Barreto, in fact, got so frustrated at one stage that he kicked the ball away to vent his anger at one of his teammates for sloppy play and was booked by the referee Dinesh Nair. Mahindras Ajayan and Sushant Matthews too were shown the yellow card in the match. 

Mahindras third and fourth goals were opportunistic strikes. 

Yakubu took control of a rebound from Bagan custodian Sangram Mukherjees palms following a top-of-the-box free-kick by Surkumar Singh to slot the ball in for a 3-1 lead. 

Later Yadav, who replaced James Singh, rose within moments of entering the field to meet a cross from Yakubu and nodded the ball home to complete the tally.

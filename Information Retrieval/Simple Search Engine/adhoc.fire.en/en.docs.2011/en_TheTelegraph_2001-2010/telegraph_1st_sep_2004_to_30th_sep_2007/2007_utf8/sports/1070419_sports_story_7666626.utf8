 Rooney keeps United on target

HENRY WINTER

 Wayne Rooney celebrates with Darren Fletcher after scoring against Sheffield on Tuesday 

In helping Manchester United move six points clear of Chelsea last night, Wayne Rooney struck his 20th goal of the season, a magnificent finish bringing his best ever return, yet he is still short of the target agreed with his manager. He promised me 25 goals so maybe Ill make the money back that I lost off (Cristiano) Ronaldo! smiled Sir Alex Ferguson. 

Manchester Uniteds manager had wagered Ronaldo that he would not score more than 15 and paid up, willingly, as the prolific Portuguese progressed towards his current total of 21. Fergusons pre-season challenges to his attackers are paying spectacular dividends for the club in their pursuit of the Treble. 

Fergusons pride in the tallies of Rooney and Ronaldo is intensified by their contributions in the assists column. Ronaldo failed to score against an ultra-defensive Sheffield United side, but he did conjure up a moment of real magic to release Michael Carrick for the hosts first. Ryan Giggs, gilding his 500th Premier League appearance with some glittering touches, created Rooneys goal. 

As well as making it 20 for the season, Rooney appeared intent on settling some scores with Sheffield Uniteds more physical players and the short-fused forward must tread far more cautiously against AC Milans crafty operatives next week. Gennaro Gattuso would not find it difficult to wind up Rooney. 

Sheffield United really only came to life after Rooneys goal, moments into the second half, and they got more bodies forward in support of the lonely, if occasionally lively Luton Shelton, the Jamaican making his first start. 

The one painful moment of the night for the Premiership leaders was the calf injury that ended the involvement of Patrice Evra, who was badly caught by Colin Kazim-Richards. Amazingly, Kazim-Richards received only a mild lecture from Rob Styles. 

Sheffield United were certainly not last night, Warnock preferring to rest some key performers before Saturdays relegation scrap with Charlton Athletic. The Yorkshiremen lacked the assertiveness of their wonderfully vocal supporters, who even cheekily launched into chants of Chelsea are gonna catch you and Mourinho, Mourinho. 

The rest of Old Trafford had been singing far more dismissive ditties about Mourinho within four minutes, the time it took Fergusons side to break down Warnocks damage-limitation 4-1-4-1 shape. The ball moved in a blur between Fletcher, Alan Smith, Ronaldo and then Carrick, who calmly lifted the ball over the onrushing Paddy Kenny. 

Rooney at times resembled a large firework with a short fuse and he duly exploded, diving in on Michael Tonge and Phil Jagielka. Four minutes into the second half, Rooney paraded his more positive side, scoring a sensational goal in front of the adoring Stretford End. Giggs, superbly, played the architect, lifting the ball over Chris Morgan, and Rooney smashed the ball past Kenny. 

Sheffield United should then have earned a penalty when Gabriel Heinze clearly caught Sheltons heel, but Styles inexplicably waved play on. Even if Styles view was obscured, he should have consulted his linesman.

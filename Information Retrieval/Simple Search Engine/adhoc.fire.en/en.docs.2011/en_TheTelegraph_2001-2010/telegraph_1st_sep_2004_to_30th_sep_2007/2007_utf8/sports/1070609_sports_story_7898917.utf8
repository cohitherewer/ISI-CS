 BCB waits for the Big Brothers ... 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Chennai: With Big Brothers India, Pakistan and even Sri Lanka still looking around for a coach, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has decided to go slow for a while. 

It has, of course, publicly announced that its doors are open for Dav Whatmore to return. 

With so many teams looking for coaches, theres quite a bit of uncertainty... Weve already appointed an interim coach for the forthcoming tour of Sri Lanka and will take things forward once the others in the region have made their choice, BCB chief executive Mahmudur Rahman told The Telegraph. 

As for Whatmore, he said: Well, we never terminated his contract... Hes the one who wanted a break and, so, didnt seek an extension... 

For the time being, BCBs national manager (development) Shaun Williams is the coach. In the past, he has worked with the Bangladesh A squad.

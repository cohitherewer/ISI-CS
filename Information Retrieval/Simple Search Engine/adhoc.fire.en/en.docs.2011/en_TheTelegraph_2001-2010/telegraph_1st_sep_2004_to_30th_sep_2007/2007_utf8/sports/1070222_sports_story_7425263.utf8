 Crowe flays Aussie policy

Melbourne: Former New Zealand captain Martin Crowe questioned Australias decision to rest Ricky Ponting and Adam Gilchrist from the Chappell-Hadlee series. 

Why didnt they rest Ponting and Gilchrist in the tri-series games when theyd already qualified for the finals and then come here? Crowe was quoted as saying in an Australian paper. 

He hit back at Adam Gilchrists attack on the timing of the series, saying the contest should be treated with due respect. It is two great families. It is a series thats going to be in the calendar every year... This Chappell-Hadlee trophy is supposed to be the Bledisloe Cup of cricket Crowe said. (PTI)

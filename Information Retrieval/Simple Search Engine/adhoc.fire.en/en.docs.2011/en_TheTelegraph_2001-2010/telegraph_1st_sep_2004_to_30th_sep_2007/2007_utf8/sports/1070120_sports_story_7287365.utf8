The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Romantic may land Vijay his dream win 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Saturday is going to be the day of reckoning for trainer Vijay Singh who is just a whisker away from joining the elite group which has saddled 1000 winners. Dramatikos, in the curtain raiser, the 1,600m Aazish Handicap, may provide him the opportunity he deserves.

 Vijay, however, need not worry if Dramatikos fails. The trainer has an ace performer in Romantic Fire who may not miss the 1,200m Calcutta Champions Sprint Trophy, a terms race.

 Romantic Fire is already the winner of a similar sprint on the New Years Day. On that occasion, the Steinbeck-Allspice son had easily beaten the best speedsters in the top category. With C.Rajendra to guide both Dramatikos and Romantic Fire, Vijay has nothing to worry about his landmark-win.

 The Police Commissioners Cup may see a close contest between all the four runners in the fray but Daniel Davids Flag Bearer appears to have a slight edge over the rest.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

 Holding sees light at end of the tunnel

 - lsquo;Sarwan has to be the captain when he rsquo;s available rsquo;

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

London: The West Indies have been in a poor way for a number of years, but Michael Holding is convinced theres light at the end of the tunnel. 

Well get back to winning once we get bowlers capable of taking 20 wickets in a match... In fact, this holds true for all teams... Holding told The Telegraph. 

Briefly interacting on the sidelines of the opening day of the first Test at Lords, he added: At some stage, the light will be there... 

Strangely, the West Indies Cricket Board hasnt been involving Holding (a regular as a TV commentator in England) in any manner, but the loss hasnt been his. 

Unofficially, though, this all-time great has been working with the present crop of new-ball bowlers. 

Holding, by the way, disagreed with the suggestion made in some quarters that Chris Gayle be given the West Indies captaincy for a while at least. 

(Ramnaresh) Sarwan is the captain... Somebody else can be so when hes not fit. However, when hes available, Sarwan has to be the captain... In my view, he should have got the job much earlier, Holding said. 

Gayle was the stand-in captain during the recent Twenty20 Internationals and ODIs against England. To the surprise of many, the West Indies won the ODIs 2-1. 

Asked whether Brian Lara quit at the right time (after the World Cup, in April), Holding replied bluntly: He was asked to... 

Holding has always maintained that the captaincy ought never to have gone Laras way. That, then, is off-the-field consistency.

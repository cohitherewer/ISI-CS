 Lagat wins 1500m gold

Osaka: A 99-year-old ghost was laid to rest by Bernard Lagat on Wednesday when he achieved what no American man has managed in almost a century by winning a global 1,500 metres title. 

The U.S. had not boasted a mens 1,500m champion in a global event since Melvin Sheppard won the 1908 Olympics in London. 

Red, white and blue flags fluttered elsewhere when Britain scored a rare one-two on the podium as Christine Ohuruogu was followed over the line by compatriot Nicola Sanders and Jamaicas Novlene Williams in the 400 metres. 

Former heptathlete Michelle Perry retained her 100m world title with a powerful late surge to win in 12.46 seconds.

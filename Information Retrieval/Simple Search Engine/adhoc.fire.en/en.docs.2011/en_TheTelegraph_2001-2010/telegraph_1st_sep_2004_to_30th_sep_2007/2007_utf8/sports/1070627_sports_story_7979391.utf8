 Big hitting Roddick has to find his way

Julian Muscat

Only at Wimbledon can motherly sighs greet the efforts of a 6ft 5in racket-wielding leviathan with the finesse of Fred Flintstone. But Justin Gimelstob was not complaining. It was not much fun being clubbed to pieces by Bamm-Bamm on the opposite side of the net. 

Gimelstob was up against Andy Roddick, the most explosive player of his age and the main obstacle to a fifth successive title for Roger Federer. In no time Roddick was 5-0 up and the mismatch looked as glaring as the skies above No 1 Court. Hence the sympathy vote from galleries anxious to be warmed on a dank afternoon. 

Then a curious thing happened. Gimelstob avoided the bagel, found some range on serve and worked his way into the contest. From then it was almost nip and tuck until Gimelstob revealed himself to be something of a toothless monster. Yet the fact remains that Roddick was not ruthless enough in dispatching him. 

The No 3 seed eventually won 6-1, 7-5, 7-6, but it was far from convincing. He had numerous opportunities to avoid the third-set tie-break, courtesy of eight break points at 4-4. All of them went begging. It was not the sort of the performance to keep Federer up at night. 

Federer himself was both quicker and cleaner to the kill. Since the matches started simultaneously, it would have pleased Roddick to be in the shower when Federer returned to the locker room. Instead, Roddicks brow furrowed repeatedly as those break points came and went. There was a blunt edge to his game, and he knew it. 

It felt like that one game took longer than the rest of the match, he said. It was a weird match because the best set I played was the toughest one, but I didnt have a lot to show for the majority of it. Thank goodness, then, for that atomic service. It shored Roddick up in the second set as Gimelstob established parity. From deuce at 3-4, Roddick served 13 successive points without Gimelstob managing to fashion a single return, taking him to set point, thanks to a break at 5-5. There was no way back for Gimelstob. 

No matter. By now Gimelstob had transformed from court pauper to crowd-pleaser with a nice line in diving volleys. So much so that one spectacular effort brought forth a wag. Come on Boris, he encouraged. You want more effort than that? Gimelstob retorted as he lifted his shirt to study the damage. Where there might have been grass-burn, there was only mud. 

Roddick was fully expecting the sideshow from a man he has known since his youth. I was trying to keep it together and focus, he said. He makes that tough sometimes. The Americans had even struck a series of bets on who would execute the most dives. I think he won but it was real close, Roddick added. A couple of them, he didnt have to dive. 

Players maintain that the hardest matches to win are those against friends. Even if Roddicks efforts should be judged in that light, he will doubtless hear some words of wisdom from his coach, Jimmy Connors.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Buzz over freshness, passion as new chapter begins today

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Rahul Dravid presents a golden bat to Mahendra Singh Dhoni at a function organised by Reebok in Bangalore on Friday. The Team India ODI captain and other brand ambassadors of the company, who were part of the World Twenty20-winning squad, were felicitated. Dravid, also a brand ambassador of the company, said the triumph came at the right time to inspire a new generation just as the 1983 World Cup victory had spurred him and many others. (PTI) 

Bangalore: If Monday was a very special day in Mahendra Singh Dhonis life, Saturday wont be like just any other either. The day is going to see him lead Team India for the first time in an ODI. 

Theres much riding on his debut. 

Indeed, given the national mood after the World Twenty20 success, its possible that the opening ODI (for the Future Cup) against world champions Australia will actually mark the start of Dhonis innings as full-time captain. 

Are you going to accept the Test captaincy? asked somebody at Friday evenings media conference. Used to stumping and not getting stumped, Dhoni replied with his signature smile: Depends on the offer! 

That, to say the least, was brilliant and the expectation is that Dhoni will inject plenty of freshness after 23 months of the Rahul Dravid era. 

Incidentally, there were more shouts of Mahi, Mahi than Rahul, Rahul when Dhoni and Co. trained under the Chinnaswamy lights. Not that Sourav Ganguly (Dada, Dada) was forgotten. 

The Australians are also going to be led by a keeper, veteran Adam Gilchrist, as Ricky Ponting hasnt recovered from a hamstring injury during the World Twenty20. Its not a warning, but hes definitely playing later in the series, Gilchrist remarked. 

Theek hai... Pontings absence is neither an advantage nor a disadvantage, Dhoni, who hasnt exactly had time to prepare for such a big challenge, told The Telegraph. 

He didnt add to the war of words between the Australians and a couple of his Young Turks Sreesanth and Robin Uthappa. 

We know the Australians talk a lot when they come to India or when we tour Australia, but that means nothing... Its their strategy... If our World Twenty20 win is history, so too is Pontings media conference yesterday (Thursday)... As everything is history, why make an issue? 

Gilchrist, for his part, said: It doesnt matter what you say, for youve got to back it up with performances... The Indians have done well recently, while weve been doing well for years... It makes for a good contest... 

He added: We see a number of Indians as a threat... They were good enough to knock us over in the World Twenty20 semis... They played with passion and we expect the same here... For a change, India is the hunter, not the hunted... 

As for us, well be playing with high skills and not emotions... The series may see the unveiling of a new champion for us... 

Actually, passion could well be the name of the game for Team India. 

I cant predict... Elan karne se jeet jate, to phir khelte nahin... We did very well in the World Twenty20 and, then, had a few days to switch off... Now, the players have to switch on again... I believe confidence has to be taken forward... 

Cricket is a team game and I wont only be looking at one or two players to deliver... Remember, its a team effort which won us the World Twenty20... Dhoni declared. 

Nine of the 14 (Rohit Sharma joins the squad in Kochi) Indians featured in the World Twenty20. 

Dhoni more than suggested that the specialists would have to work on their fielding. Its not about being a senior or a junior, its about being in form... Also, the players have to take the pressure off the team (with their fielding)... 

According to Dhoni, the wicket (which has grass) should be good, with the ball doing a few things under lights. Gilchrist didnt express any alarms. 

If Ponting is unavailable for Australias first ODI since the hattrick of World Cup wins, in April, the Indians also have worries. Harbhajan Singh has a stiff neck and Dinesh Karthik was hit on the left cheek while fielding. 

The Australians, in fact, have to pick from 13 as new ball bowler Nathan Bracken is yet to report. Hes home as his wife has just given birth to a son... Were awaiting an update on his travel plans, is what a member of the team management said. 

Predictably, there wont be even an inch of unoccupied space when the first match after our World Twenty20 triumph gets under way.

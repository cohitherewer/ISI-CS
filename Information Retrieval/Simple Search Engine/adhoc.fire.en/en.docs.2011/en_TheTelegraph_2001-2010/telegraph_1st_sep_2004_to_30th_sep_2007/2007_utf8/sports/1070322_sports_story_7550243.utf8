 Hope to get Smith early

Basseterre: Australian pace sensation Shaun Tait believes he can make a bunny out of South Africa captain Graeme Smith, something Brett Lee was good at. 

The 24-year-old Aussie speedster has taken over from spearhead Lee, who had to pull out owing to an injured ankle, and feels he can handle the new ball. 

I think it is more important when the new batsman comes in If we get a couple of early wickets, then (Glenn) McGrath comes on. 

The batsman is at his weakest early on, especially if its reversing a bit its quite hard to pick on these tracks, so its a good time to bring me on. I hope to do the same job Lee used to do, said Tait of dismissing South Africa captain Smith early. 

Tait is all game for the clash against world No.1 South Africa, saying any pre-match talk of him being a weak link doesnt perturb him. 

I couldnt care less what Daryll Cullinan or others have to say for me. To be honest it doesnt bother me at all. I dont even know him, said Tait of former South Africa batsman Cullinan, who described Tait as the weak link in Australias attack. 

I suppose being the young bloke in the side theres no reason why they shouldnt target me but I am looking forward to the match, said Tait of Australias Saturday clash against the Proteas. (Reuters)

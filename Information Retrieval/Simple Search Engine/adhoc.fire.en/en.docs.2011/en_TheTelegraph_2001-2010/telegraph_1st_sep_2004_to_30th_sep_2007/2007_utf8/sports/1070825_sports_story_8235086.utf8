The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 CAB chief contradicts Subhas

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president and city police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee has contradicted sports minister Subhas Chakrabortys claim, saying the state government has no role to play in the renewal of Edens lease. 

The lease renewal rests solely with the Defence authorities. The state government has a role to play with regard to the construction and other matters, but has nothing to do with the lease, Mukherjee said on Friday. 

Mukherjees views were confirmed by a spokesman of the Army. Chakraborty had on Thursday offered use of the grounds in the state, including the Eden, to the Kapil Dev-headed Indian Cricket League. 

Mukherjee clarified that no match can be held at the Eden without CABs permission. The Eden lease expired on June 15 and we had applied for its renewal well in advance. As per rules, the process takes around six months, Mukherjee said. We are in regular talks with the authorities and I am confident of its renewal. 

Mukherjee, however, didnt wish to comment on Subhas statement. He is the sports minister and a respected person. I dont wish to make a comment since I am unaware of the circumstances under which he said so I meet him very often and will speak to him personally. 

The president informed that the CAB has been insisting on a lease for a longer period. Previously we had the lease for 20 years. This time we wish to have it for 30 years. That is because we will invest several crores into the Edens renovation keeping in mind the 2011 World Cup, Mukherjee said.

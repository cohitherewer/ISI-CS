 Fords pulling out not a lost opportunity

Bangalore: Team India skipper Rahul Dravid on Saturday denied rooting for a foreigner as the coach and said the high-profile job should go to the right person, irrespective of his nationality. 

I have always spoken about what qualities and requirements are needed for the high-profile job. If you find the right person, it makes no difference to me whether hes an Indian or a foreigner, he said. 

As long as you get the person with the right qualities who can do the job for you, it does not matter to me who he is, he added. 

Dravid was reacting to what has been widely talked about that he suggested Graham Fords name as the Team India coach. 

Ford, however, declined the offer despite being chosen ahead of John Emburey, the other candidate. 

On Fords turning down the offer, Dravid said it was not a lost opportunity. 

 If someone does not want to do the job its not a lost opportunity. Anyone who comes to India to do the job should be very clear in his mind that you are hundred per cent sure of what you want to do, Dravid said. 

(The job) requires a lot of patience, energy and drive. It would take a lot out of you. If you have any doubts then its right not to come here, he said at the end of the four-day camp for the Ireland-bound one-day squad. 

Dravid said the appointment of 72-year-old Chandu Borde as the teams manager for the two-and-a-half-month tour of Ireland and later England was just a stop-gap one and the BCCI was on the lookout for someone to do the role on a long-term basis. 

He also said it was improper to keep harping on Ravi Shastris inability to continue as the cricket manager. Ravi Shastri couldnt continue. He made it clear very early on and theres no point discussing about it., Dravid said. 

He said there was a need for a coach or cricket manager in modern cricket especially to take care of things before and after a game. 

A coach/ cricket manager can make a difference in the preparation of the team before and after. As captain its always not possible to give individual attention to all members of the team. Coaches can do that. 

Without the pressure of actually playing, he has the chance to look after a larger group of boys. His role is more before and after the game, Dravid said. 

The Indian captain said Bordes absence at the camp could not be helped as the appointment was done late. 

(The camp) was just for two or three days and I am sure he got to know of his appointment late to reach on time. It might have helped to get to know the boys better, Dravid said.

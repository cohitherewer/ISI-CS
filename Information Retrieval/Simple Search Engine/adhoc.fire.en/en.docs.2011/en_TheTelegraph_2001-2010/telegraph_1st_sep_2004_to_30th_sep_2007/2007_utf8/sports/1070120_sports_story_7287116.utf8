The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 CAB XI ride Shukla show

- Telegraph twenty20 meet 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Laxmi Ratan Shukla led CAB XI to a 48-run win over Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) XI in their opening encounter of The Telegraph Twenty20 Cricket Tournament presented by McDowell No. 1 at the CC amp;FC on Friday. 

The CAB captain first played an anchor role with a 43-ball 45 to help his team notch 137 after a shaky start by CAB XI. Manoj Tewari lent Shukla a fine support with a 30-ball 36. Later, while defending, Man-of-the-Match Shukla effected two run-outs as Karnataka were bundled out for 89. 

For the home team, the match was significant for Shib Shankar Paul. He is trying to make a comeback after an injury lay-off. Watched by chief selector Arup Bhattacharya, Paul bowled his quota of four overs in two spells. He did impress though, claiming a wicket in his very first over. However, Bhattacharya felt that assessment cant be made seeing him bowl in a Twenty20. He added: What appears, though, is that hes not fully fit. 

Mohammed Kaif was to arrive in the city by Friday evening but owing to a flight delay he had not landed until midnight. 

Yuvraj Singh will turn out for Indian Airlines against ONGC Saturday afternoon.

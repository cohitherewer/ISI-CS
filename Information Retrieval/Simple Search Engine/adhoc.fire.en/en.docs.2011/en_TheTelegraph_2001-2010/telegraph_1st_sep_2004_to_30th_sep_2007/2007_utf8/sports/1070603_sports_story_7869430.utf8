 PCB, players differ on new contracts

Karachi: Less than a month before the new central contracts are put into place, differences between the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and players over the terms and conditions have come to the fore. 

After a meeting held in Lahore on Friday to discuss the new format for the contracts, PCB and captain Shoaib Malik dished out contrasting versions of the outcome. 

Shafqat Nagmi, the chief operating officer of the board, told reporters that the players had agreed to the new terms and conditions of the contract, based on performance rather than seniority. 

But Malik told mediapersons shortly after the meeting with Nagmi that the format of the central contracts was yet to be finalised. 

They have agreed to some of our suggestions and we have accepted some of their proposals. But the contracts would be finalised after a meeting with the board chairman next week, the Pakistan skipper said. 

Nagmi said the players including Malik, Mohammed Yousuf, Shahid Afridi, Mohammed Asif and Salman Butt supported the idea of having performance-based contracts apart from getting a uniform monthly retainer. 

However, Malik said while the players agreed that it was a good idea to reward individual performances in the new contracts, seniority should also be taken into consideration. 

Nagmi, however, conceded that while the new contracts would not be based on seniority and the board would not be changing the system of paying match fees which is based on a seniority grading. 

Nagmi claimed that under the new contracts, to be made effective by July 1, the players would earn far more than they used to get before. 

Meanwhile, the PCB has issued a gag order, warning the players of stiff penalties, including match bans, if they speak to the media without prior permission from the team management.

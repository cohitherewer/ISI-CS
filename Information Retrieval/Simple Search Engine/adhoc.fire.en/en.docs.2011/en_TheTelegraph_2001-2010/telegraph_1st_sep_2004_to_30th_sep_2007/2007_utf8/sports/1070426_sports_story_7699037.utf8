 OCA vows to stop unethical practices

New Delhi: Concerned by the show of money power and distribution of gifts to influence voters during the bid presentation for the 2014 Asian Games, the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) on Wednesday resolved to put a system in place to check such unethical practices. The OCA said it was planning to implement the norms used by the International Olympic Council (IOC) to make the bidding process more transparent. 

A week after New Delhi lost the bid to host the 2014 Games to Incheon, OCA general secretary Randhir Singh promised to put the house in order so that future bid processes were not turned into auctions. We will study what the IOC is doing and lay down a proper format for bidding. The offer should be as per the norms set out by the OCA, Singh said. (PTI)

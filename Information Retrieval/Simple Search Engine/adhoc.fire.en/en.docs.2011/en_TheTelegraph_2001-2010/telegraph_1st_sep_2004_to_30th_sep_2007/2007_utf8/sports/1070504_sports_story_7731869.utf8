 Tirkey returns home 

Ipoh (Malaysia): India suffered a jolt even before kicking off their campaign in the eight-nation Sultan Azlan Shah Hockey Tournament with ace midfielder Ignace Tirkey opting out of the squad citing personal reasons. 

His replacement, Vikram Kanth (Indian Oil) is expected to arrive here on Friday, ahead of Indias opening fixture against Australia on Saturday, according to chief coach Joaquim Carvalho. 

Also missing from the Indian contingent was manager RK Shetty from Bangalore, who too opted at the last moment, citing family reasons. 

Assistant coach Mohinder Pal Singh has been entrusted with the managerial responsibility in Shettys absence. 

Speaking on the issue of Tirkeys return, coach Joaquim Carvalho said, Ignace himself opted out after low-key performances in the two practice games we played in Kuala Lumpur earlier this week. (PTI)

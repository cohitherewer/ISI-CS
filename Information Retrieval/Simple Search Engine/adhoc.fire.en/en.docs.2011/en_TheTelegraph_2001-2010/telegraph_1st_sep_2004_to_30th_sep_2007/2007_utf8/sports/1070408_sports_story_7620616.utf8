 Chappell visits hospital for routine check-up

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai: Greg Chappell on Saturday walked into the Bombay Hospital for some medical tests, fuelling speculation that the last few days have been too stressful for him to fly back home. 

He apparently felt unwell soon after he submitted his report at the two-day BCCI conclave on Friday afternoon. He was asked to rest briefly before leaving for the hotel. 

Wife Judith confirmed to a television channel that her husband indeed felt a bit stressed after Indias World Cup debacle. 

Hospital sources, however, clarified that Chappell wasnt admitted and maintained that he had undergone tests as part of a routine health check-up. 

At 11am, Chappell visited us with Dr Ashok Kripalani for a routine executive medical check-up, the hospital spokesperson, Dr Ashish Tiwari, told The Telegraph. 

Dr Tiwari said the executive health check-up included a package of 50 examinations including blood and urine tests, liver profile, renal profile, chest X-rays and so on. 

He underwent all the tests and left the hospital around 1.30pm after completing the check-up, Dr Tiwari said, denying reports that Chappell had complained of unease. 

When contacted, Dr Kripalani confirmed that it was a routine health check recommended to guests, and the former Aussie captain had been cleared to fly out of Mumbai. 

The Chappells are expected to fly back home after a brief holiday stopover in Singapore. Chappell was scheduled to leave for Singapore last evening, but had delayed the departure by a day, Board sources said.

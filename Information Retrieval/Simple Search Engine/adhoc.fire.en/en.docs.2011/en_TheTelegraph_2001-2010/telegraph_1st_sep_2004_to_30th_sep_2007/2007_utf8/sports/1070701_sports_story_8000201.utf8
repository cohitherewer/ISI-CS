 Pole for Massa

Magny-Cours: Brazilian Felipe Massa put Ferrari on pole position for the French Grand Prix on Saturday, with McLarens championship leader Lewis Hamilton right alongside. 

Its good to be back and fighting, declared Massa, whose team has been outgunned by McLaren for the last three races. 

Finlands Kimi Raikkonen will start Sundays race in third place for Ferrari next to BMW Saubers Polish driver Robert Kubica. 

Hamiltons teammate and double Formula One world champion Fernando Alonso, who is 10 points behind the 22-year-old British rookie after seven races, endured a nightmare day and qualified 10th. 

Already sidelined for most of the days final practice session due to a brake sensor problem, the Spaniard did not set a time in the final qualifying session after hitting further mechanical trouble. I dont really know what happened, said Hamilton. I was behind him and just saw a little bit of smoke at one of the corners. 

Alonso returned to the garage and sat in the car as mechanics worked around him in an ultimately futile race against time. With five minutes remaining, he stepped out and removed his helmet. 

Massas pole position, with a lap 0.070 seconds faster than Hamiltons best, was the Brazilians fourth of the season and seventh of his career.

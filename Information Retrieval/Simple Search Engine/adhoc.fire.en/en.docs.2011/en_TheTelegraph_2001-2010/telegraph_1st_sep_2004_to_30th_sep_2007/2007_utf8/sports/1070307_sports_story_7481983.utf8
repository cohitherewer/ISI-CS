 Things will pick up vs India: Lara

Montego Bay: West Indies captain Brain Lara believes Marlon Samuels, who struck an unbeaten century in Mondays warm-up win over Kenya, is finally ready to realise his potential just in time for the World Cup. 

Marlon Samuels has the ability; we have known that since he was 16 years old and since he came into first class cricket. Now he is getting more of an opportunity and is responding well, said Lara, who did not bat in his teams 268. 

Samuels was cleared to play in the World Cup despite an ICC anti-corruption unit investigation into allegations that he passed on confidential team information to a bookmaker. 

Lara said he was pleased with the batting display from his side but felt there was more to come from his bowlers who allowed Kenya to get within 21 runs of their total. 

The West Indies skipper believes the adrenalin will start flowing in Fridays final preparation game against India. 

Things will pick up on Friday. We will be closing in on our opening match and India are the kind of opposition who will be looking to get a psychological advantage. That will be a game that neither side will want to lose, he said.

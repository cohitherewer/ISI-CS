The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Im delighted, says Zaheer

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Dhaka: Zaheer Khan, who got seven wickets for 88 runs including a five-wicket haul in the first innings, said he was desperate to come good in the series. 

It has been a long time since I got a five-wicket haul (five for 34). I had been looking for such a feat. I am really delighted to get it here, MoM Zaheer said. 

He, however, didnt pick his performance in the match as his best so far. I cant say its the best... The conditions here were very hot and humid. But the wicket was a bit two-paced, the new ball was keeping low at times. It helped me a lot, he said. 

Praising young bowlers like Rudra Pratap Singh and Ishant Sharma, the speedster said he enjoyed the competition with them. 

Zaheer also noted the presence of bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad had a positive effect on them.

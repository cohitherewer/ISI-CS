 Ireland captain denies charge

 Johnston 

Georgetown: Ireland captain Trent Johnston has dismissed suggestions that his sides shocking victory over Pakistan was a fix. The World Cup debutants knocked their Asian rivals out of the tournament a result which was followed by the murder of Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer. 

We keep hearing things about match-fixing, said Johnston, who felt the rumours demeaned Irelands display. You only have to look at that game and the way we bowled and fielded and I was just hugely proud of the guys. 

The Irish bowled out Pakistan for 132 in their group D match and then scored the runs with 8.2 overs remaining to spark feverish celebrations at one of the great World Cup upsets. The toss of the coin was crucial against Pakistan and we bowled very well against them, Johnston added. 

We still had to go out and get 130-odd runs against a quality bowling attack and they were giving it everything and luckily we got home, he said. Ireland subsequently lost to the West Indies but are now in Guyana preparing to face England on Friday in the Super Eight of the tournament. 

All the rumours about the match have probably taken the shine off it a little for us, but this is the first day its really sunk in that were here and were pinching ourselves a bit, said Johnston. 

It is a tragedy what happened to Bob and it has taken away a little of the excitement, but weve had to move on. I was hugely proud of the guys about the way they handled themselves around the hotel because there was obviously a lot going on and we put that at the back of our minds, the 32-year-old Australian-born Johnston stated. 

We could potentially be going back to work in Ireland, but instead were still here and weve got another months cricket. Were playing the best eight teams in the Super Eight its hugely exciting, Johnston said.

 Were improving in fielding: Yuvraj

 - World cup jerseys in place, indians ready for the caribbean sojourn 

 Yuvraj Singh 

Chandigarh: Yuvraj Singh says the players are aware that they need to lift their fielding standards and are working harder in that department to give themselves a strong chance of winning the World Cup. 

Fielding, obviously, is a key area of the game and it can be our strong point. During our net sessions, we lay a lot of stress on this and I must say we are improving, Yuvraj, who announced his return to form with a rollicking unbeaten 95 against Sri Lanka in the final one-dayer at Visakhapatnam on Saturday, told reporters here. 

Chairman of selectors Dilip Vengsarkar and coach Greg Chappell have expressed their concerns about Indias fielding standards. 

The team has neither Mohammed Kaif nor Suresh Raina, two of the quickest legs in recent times. 

Yuvraj, who has a reputation of his own for fielding and catching, is coming back from a three-month injury lay-off. 

I am working hard on my fitness and laying emphasis on my fielding as well, the middle-order batsman said. 

The left-hander said the 83-ball knock against the Lankans will give him the much-needed confidence going into the quadrennial event in the West Indies from March 13. I needed some time in the middle and luckily I got it, he said. 

Asked which team would be the favourites, Yuvraj said that on any given day the team which puts up the best performance would have a decent chance.

 Smith sees big role for bowlers

Johannesburg: South African captain Graeme Smith believes bowlers could play as big a role at the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 his nation is hosting from September 11. 

Im unsure whether batsmen are going to totally dominate. No one really knows what conditions are going to be like at this time of year, Smith said in Johannesburg on Monday. 

If they are good, then batsmen could have a field day because the ball travels far up here on the Highveld and our stadiums are smaller than elsewhere in the world. 

But bowlerss skills are improving all the time and with slower balls and bouncers coming into play, I think they could have a big say as well, 

South Africa will open the tournament with a match against the West Indies in Johannesburg and Smith said his team was excited about launching a new format of the game on an international scale. Were very excited, especially since were hosting this inaugural tournament, he added. From when one-day cricket started until now, it has developed a lot and its a far different game now than when it began. 

Twenty20 is just starting now and everything will be different. Tactics will obviously be important and teams are going to have to show some imagination, players who are unorthodox and can think on their feet will be crucial. 

Captains will need to trust their players and allow them to go out and play. 

South African coach Mickey Arthur said the tournament offered a great opportunity for his team to win a major ICC event for the first time and they would limber up for the championship with an intensive week of preparation. 

Graeme and I have a pretty good idea of what we want and hopefully we will confirm that during this week. Arthur said. (Reuters)

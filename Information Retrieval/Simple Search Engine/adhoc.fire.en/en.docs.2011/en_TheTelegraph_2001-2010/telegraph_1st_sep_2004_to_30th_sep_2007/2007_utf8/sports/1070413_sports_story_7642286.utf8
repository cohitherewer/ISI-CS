 SHARP SINGLES 

2011 Cup may be trimmed

Melbourne: World Cup 2007 tournament

 managing director Chris Dehring said that the showpiece events itinerary

 may be trimmed for the next edition in Asia.

One of the shortfalls of the last World Cup in South Africa was that rain played such an important factor. We decided this time to make sure you had adequate rain days. But of course that is going to elongate the tournament, Dehring said. We would have preferred a shorter event had it been possible, but to do that there would not have been rain days. I think they may change it next time. 

 Fica survey

Melbourne: The Federation of International Cricketers Association (Fica) will conduct a survey of the players at the ongoing World Cup to get their feedback on scheduling, transport and security in the West Indies. Fica chief Tim May said the results of the survey will be discussed with the ICC after the tournament gets over.

Lanka protest

 Colombo: Dozens of members of a Sri Lankan nationalist group demonstrated Thursday against Amnesty Internationals use of the World Cup to highlight human rights abuses in the country. 

Protesters from the National Patriotic Front shouted slogans against the London-based group in front of Colombos main railroad station and urged it to be fair toward the country.

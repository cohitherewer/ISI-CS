 Rastogi awaits Nadal date

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chennai: By his own admission, Karan Rastogi was thinking ahead to his match with Rafael Nadal even before he had won the last point against Brazilian Thiago Alves in Round 1 of the Chennai Open. Up 6-3, 4-1 with two breaks in the pocket the young Indian lost the next three games to be back on even keel. 

May be I was thinking ahead ... to Thursdays match against Nadal, said Rastogi. But then I pulled up my socks and fought back well to close it out in two sets. 

Yes, he did, and deserves credit for not falling into the trap of being a typically gallant Indian loser. And what a prize he has earned for himself date with the only player to have more wins than losses against the invincible Roger Federer! 

So, how is he looking forward to the clash between the world No. 2 and the world No. 480? Will it be a dream come true? It will be one of the biggest moments of my career since he is such a good player, but I have got bigger dreams than facing Nadal, said Rastogi, as cool as cucumber.

 Dog bite keeps Borg out

London: Five-time Wimbledon champion Bjorn Borg has been forced to pull out of his first grasscourt singles match in England for 26 years after being bitten by a dog. 

The 51-year-old Swede had been due to play in the Liverpool International but organisers said on Sunday that Borg was hurt trying to stop a dogfight at his home in Sweden. 

The tournament website said a German Shepherd had attacked Borgs Golden Retriever and the former French Open champion was severely bitten on his right leg after stepping in to separate them. 

Doctors have advised Borg, who will still attend the tournament, not to put any weight on his leg for six weeks. 

He had been scheduled to play 1987 Wimbledon champion Pat Cash in an exhibition match on Friday. Borg has not played on grass in England since his defeat by John McEnroe in the 1981 Wimbledon final. (Reuters)

 PCB rests Yousuf

 Mohammed Yousuf 

Karachi: Pakistani selectors rested record-breaking batsman Mohammed Yousuf and allrounder Abdul Razzaq for the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 meet to be played in South Africa next month. 

We have not dropped them. We have rested them as we felt that other players are more suitable for the instant nature of Twenty20 cricket, chief selector Salahuddin Ahmed said. 

Salahuddin, himself a former Test player, carefully avoided using the word dropped and insisted Yousuf and Razzaq remained at the top of their list for forthcoming series. 

They are no doubt world-class performers. Other teams have also rested their senior players for the Twenty20 World Cup which many people feel is festival cricket, he said. 

Insiders, however, said that Yousuf and Razzaq were not picked in the Pakistan squad mainly because the feeling was their fielding was not up to the standards. 

Significantly the decision to rest Yousuf and Razzaq comes at a time when they have got good offers from the organisers of the rebel ICL which ironically is also of Twenty20 format. 

Yousuf when contacted said the selectors were free to do as they pleased. It is their decision. I am disappointed but what can I say. I dont want to make any comment now, he said.

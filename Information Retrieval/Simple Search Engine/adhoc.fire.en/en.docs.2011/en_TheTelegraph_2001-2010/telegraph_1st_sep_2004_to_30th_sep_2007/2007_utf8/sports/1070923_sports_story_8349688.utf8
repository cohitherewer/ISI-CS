 India debut excites wild card Kiefer 

MARIO RODRIGUES 

 Nicolas Kiefer 

Mumbai: It took a wild card to finally bring Nicolas Kiefer to India despite him being on the pro tour for the past 12 years. The 30-year-old German got the call-up from tournament promoter Mahesh Bhupathi whom he meets regularly on the tour and to whom hes been talking off and on. 

The wild card would have otherwise gone to an Indian, but it went to Kiefer to inject some star power into the diminishing ranks of the $416,000 Kingfisher Airlines Open which begins at the CI courts here on Monday. 

In 12 years on the tour Ive never been here Its my first time in India. Im really happy to get the wild card. You never know what to expect. So far I havent seen too much of the city but of course I plan to do some sightseeing if we have the time. 

I like to see something of each city I visit. Its a bit unlucky with the weather so far (a reference to the continuous drizzle that has plagued his visit since Thursday). Here, you pray for everything so I hope you pray to make the rain stay away and we can see some good tennis, Kiefer, currently ranked 131, quipped at a press conference on Saturday afternoon. 

Kiefer, who is drawn to meet Paul-Henri Mathieu of France in the opening round, is one of the three Germans in the main singles draw along with his occasional doubles partner Rainer Schuettler and Bjorn Phau. 

Incidentally, Kiefer in tandem with Schuettler, had beaten the Bhupathi-Leander Paes combo in the Athens Olympics semi-finals. While the German duo went on to win a silver, the Indian Express failed to clinch the bronze in the third place playoff. That was a good win, the former world No. 4 stated, when reminded about the match. But I prefer to focus on singles and I dont play much doubles. 

Asked why Indians, who impress on the junior circuit, fade out in the senior ranks, Kiefer, who has six ATP titles in the bag, said that everyone plays tennis but only a few make it. The last 5-6 per cent is in your mind. It takes a lot of things to succeed but you need a little bit of luck as well. But most of all, you have to work for it, nothing comes easy, he insisted. 

Sporting the number 69 on a black cap, Kiefer revealed that its his jersey number of the football team he supports back home, Hannover 96. In Germany, we play a lot of soccer, but here I believe it is not very popular as you prefer cricket, he said.

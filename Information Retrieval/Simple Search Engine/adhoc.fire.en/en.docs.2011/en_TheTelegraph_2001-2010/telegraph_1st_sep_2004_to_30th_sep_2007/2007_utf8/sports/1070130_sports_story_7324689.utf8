 Pathan has got rhythm back: Fraser

 Late evening downpour follows West 

 Indies practice session 

 Vadodara: Team India biomechanist 

 Ian Fraser on Monday expressed satisfaction over Irfan Pathans 

 current form, saying the seamer had found his rhythm back.

 Irfan seems to have got 

 his bowling rhythm back. The break from international cricket 

 and the fact that he has bowled close to 70 overs for Baroda 

 in the Ranji Trophy seems to have benefited him, he 

 said.

 Fraser assessed Pathan, who joined 

 the squad as the 16th member for the fourth and final one-dayer 

 against the West Indies, and Munaf Patel, nursing an ankle 

 injury, after their net session at the IPCL ground.

 Pathan was recalled midway through 

 the tour of South Africa and asked to play domestic matches 

 to regain his rhythm.

 Fraser said: The best way 

 to get back to form would be to go back and bowl in a natural 

 manner which he did today (Monday).

 His run-up looked fluent 

 and his action was smooth. There was fluidity in his motion, 

 he said after the teams optional practice session 

 attended only by captain Rahul Dravid and opener Robin Uthappa.

 Fraser, however, said it remained 

 to be seen how much rhythm Pathan would be able to maintain 

 during the match here on Wednesday.

 How he translates this rhythm 

 in the match remains to be seen. India lack a genuine allrounder 

 and Irfan has the potential to become one, the Australian 

 said.

 On Patel, Fraser said the right-arm 

 paceman, who looked unfit during the Cape Town Test after 

 his return from a long injury-induced hiatus, seemed to 

 be slowly slipping into a groove, though he bowled off a 

 shortened run-up.

 He would need three or four 

 days but hes moving more strongly, Fraser said.

 On Dr Anant Joshis remarks 

 that Munafs ankle injury had healed but it was doubtful 

 whether he was fit, Fraser said it happened to sportsmen 

 at times. Hes not played much cricket in the 

 past and the pressure to perform at the international level 

 is different, he said.

 The West Indian team, too, had 

 an optional practice session, which was held under overcast 

 conditions. 

 It started to drizzle when the 

 players were winding up and became stronger late in the 

 evening once the sessionwas over. (PTI)

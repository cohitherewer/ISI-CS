 Indian trio starts off well

 Pakistan Open 

Karachi: Vivek Bhandari, Uttam Singh Mundy and Rahul Ganapathy ensured a strong Indian presence on the leaderboard as they were all tied third at the end of Day I of the Pakistan Open at the Karachi Golf Club on Thursday. 

They were joined in the top-10 by youngsters Amardip Malik and Asian Games silver-medallist Gaganjeet Bhullar, both bringing home three-under 69 each to be tied ninth. 

The leader after first round was local hero Muhammad Shabbir, who was in full flow as he carded a flawless bogey-free six-under-par 66 to grab the early lead. 

Shabbir is coming back after sustaining an injury to his lower back last year. 

One shot behind Shabbir was Malaysias Airil Rizman Zahari, who spent the off-season working on his game.

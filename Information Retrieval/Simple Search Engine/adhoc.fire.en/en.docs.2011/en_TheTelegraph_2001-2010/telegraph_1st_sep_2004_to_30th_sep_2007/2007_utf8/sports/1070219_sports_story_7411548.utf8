 Maiden WTA title for Shvedova

Bangalore: Unseeded Russian Yaroslava Shvedova won her first WTA Tour title on Sunday after defeating Italian top seed and defending champion Mara Santangelo 64, 64 in the final. 

The big-serving 19-year-old dropped to her knees in celebration after beating the world No. 36 in 96 minutes. 

She played better than me... congratulations to her, 25-year-old Santangelo said. I tried my best. 

Shvedova maintained the form that helped her beat seventh-seeded Thai Tamarine Tanasugarn in the second round and Indian second seed Sania Mirza in the quarters. 

The 1.78m tall Muscovite Shvedova broke Santangelo in the seventh game to win the first set in 44 minutes after trading breaks early on. The Russian then held on to an early break to win the second. 

The doubles title went to Chinese Taipeis Chan Yung-jan and Chung Chia-jung. The top seeds beat Hsieh Su-wei of Chinese Taipei and Alla Kudryavtseva of Russia, the fourth seeds, 6-7 (4-7), 6-2, 11-9. (Agencies)

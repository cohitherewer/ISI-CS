 ACBI turns to Dravid

 New Delhi: Refused support by the BCCI, the cash-strapped Association for Cricket for the Blind in India (ACBI) has approached Rahul Dravid to help raise funds. 

 The BCCI says that blind 

 cricket is not cricket. When Jagmohan Dalmiya was the chairman, 

 he at least used to take our phone calls but the present 

 set-up does not even respond to our letters, ACBI 

 chairman George Abraham said on Friday. It is impossible 

 to get through to Mr Sharad Pawar.

 We may never see the same Flintoff again

CHRISTOPHER MARTIN-JENKINS

 Flintoff doesnt have Bothams bovine constitution 

Everyone wants a fit Andrew Flintoff they were the words of Peter Moores at Leeds only on Monday, but they expressed a general view among cricketers and cricket followers of all nationalities for many years. The serious concern now, after the decision to expose his left ankle to a third operation, is that we shall never again see the Flintoff who was the Test Cricketer of the Year in 2005. 

You can put your last shirt on his playing for England again, but probably not this season, and probably never as a bowler who gets wickets mainly by pace and bounce. 

I feel so sorry for him, the man about to take over as the technical advisor to England bowlers said Wednesday. Allan Donald gave up bowling fast for South Africa after constant ankle problems because, he reiterated: I couldnt stand going through the pain any more. 

From personal experience he does not have much hope that any technical changes to Flintoffs action will preserve the ankle indefinitely once it has been cured and rested. 

Its the constant pounding, he said. It eventually catches up with you. That is precisely what has happened to Flintoff, whose heavy tread and an action that has always put tremendous strain on the front foot as it lands and twists to allow the body to pivot in delivering the ball, is threatening his future at the age of only 29. 

Since his debut as a rough hewn allrounder of prodigious natural ability in 1998, this will be the sixth lengthy interruption to his international career, involving a total now of at least 20 missed Test matches. After 67 Tests, his batting and bowling averages at 32 each cancel each other out. 

For him that is worrying, because a true allrounder has a higher batting average but in the highest bracket of performers, they are rare beings. 

Jacques Kallis, the worlds supreme allrounder, Sanath Jayasuriya, much more batsman than bowler, and Jacob Oram, whose achievements do not yet compare with the others, are the only credible allrounders left in Tests. Jayasuriya has officially taken his pension as a five-day player, tempted though he and Sri Lanka may be to think again after his World Cup performances. 

The extent of Flintoffs present injury, in a different place but on the same ankle as the previous posterior impingement that caused his second operation last July, is still a matter of speculation at present, even for the doctors. 

Cortisone injections in the winter kept him going after an outstanding bowling performance at Brisbane where he took four for 99 in an Australia total of 602 for nine, but it was evident from the second innings there, and certainly during the second Test in Adelaide, that every time he really put life and soul into an extended spell, the pain would return. 

Donald decided to avoid, as he puts it the knife, but Brett Lee missed the World Cup after a second ankle operation, Shaun Pollock and Lance Klusener also had two ankle operations and neither of Donalds fellow South Africans has been as effective since because, inevitably, their bowling lost pace and bite. 

Although the operation that is envisaged at this stage for this weekend is only an exploratory arthroscopy, the Flintoff who emerges from the anaesthetic may have to begin the process of reinventing himself as a cricketer. He is already reliably accurate, so a bit more work on swinging the ball could still make him effective at Test level without having to strive for 90mph pace. 

The same applies in 50-over international cricket. As a batsman he has scored five Test hundreds and provided his bowling contributions do not become negligible, you would still want him in your side, especially when his excellence in the slips is added to the equation. 

For the moment, however, it makes the work of Englands temporary selection committee that much easier. Matthew Hoggards hoped-for return to the side at Old Trafford next week will already mean leaving out Liam Plunkett, but Ian Bell, if he is fit, or Owais Shah, will now play the remainder of the series against West Indies and probably against India, too as a sixth specialist batsman. Until Rikki Clarke or one or two more mature allround performers can demand inclusion, it means that even on flat pitches in sunny weather, England will have to get by, as Australia did for so long, with only four specialist bowlers. 

It helps that Bell, Paul Collingwood, Kevin Pietersen and, in particular, Michael Vaughan a far better off-spinner than six Test wickets at 89 runs each suggest can be used at different times as occasional bowlers. All of them should actually have done more bowling in recent Test history than they have to take the strain off Flintoff and the other fast bowlers. 

Once he is back in the Lancashire side it will be up to Flintoff to demand his place back by performance. The big, bluff lad from Preston has brought a bravado and entertainment value to his cricket that has not been seen in quite the same way in any England cricketer since Ian Botham, shortly to be knighted for his considerable commitment to charity. 

One can imagine Flintoff hiking through the streets too when time permits, blessed with a generous spirit as he is, but only if his ankle will stand it. The essential difference between Englands last great allrounder and this one is that Flintoff seems not to have the same bovine constitution. 

He can hit a cricket ball just as far and bowl it even faster than Botham, but a great career is about to be interrupted for an indeterminate period and everyone wishes him well.

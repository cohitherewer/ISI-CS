The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A taxing fiasco

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Gurgaon: The prize distribution ceremony, after the Super Cup tie between Mohun Bagan and Dempo, turned controversial when one of the teams threatened to return the prize money. 

According to the AIFF sources, Dempo manager Mahesh Lotlikar went up to top federation officials to return the cheque in protest against deduction of taxes. The AIFF, for the first time, applied tax deducted at source (TDS) rules for the NFL prize money. 

But for AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, the function could have ended on a bitter note, said an AIFF official. Das Munshi immediately intervened and asked AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco to pay the clubs the full amount. 

A club official, when contacted, was livid. AIFF deducted tax and paid Dempo only Rs 26 lakh out of Rs 40 lakh. JCT were paid only Rs 15 lakh out of Rs 22 lakh and Mohun Bagan got Rs 6 lakh for winning the Super Cup. Taxes were never deducted in the last ten editions of the NFL. Why should the federation deny us our hard-earned money this time, he asked. 

Meanwhile, the AIFF has told a delegation of Football Players Association of India (FPAI) that Rs 1 crore will soon be earmarked for the Players Benevolent Fund.

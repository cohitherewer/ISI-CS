 Plans out of window 

 Graeme Smith 

Georgetown: A crestfallen Graeme Smith felt South Africa forgot all the basics as they slumped to a shock 67-run defeat by Bangladesh in a World Cup Super Eight match on Saturday. 

I guess its one of those days where youre trying to come up with the right thing to say and theres no right thing to say, Smith told a news conference. We let ourselves down very badly. All the things we discussed went out of the window, we just didnt play well enough today. 

Weve been beaten and its a huge loss for us. We didnt play any kind of cricket that were capable of. 

Its hard to take a positive out of any facet of the game. 

Smith felt that poor execution of core skills by his players during Bangladeshs innings cost South Africa the match. 

Our basics were very poor today with the ball and in the field, and if you cant get your basics right its going to cost you, he said. It cost us today with them getting 251 for eight. 

Despite the way the match unfolded, Smith insisted that his team had not underestimated Bangladeshs challenge. 

We didnt look past this game, Bangladesh played superbly, he said. We gave them an opportunity and they took it with both hands. 

Mohammed Ashraful played superbly today from the moment he came in he carried the team around him. I dont want to take anything away from him but we didnt bowl and field as well as we should have. 

They are a young team and certainly improving all the time. he said. 

Meanwhile, Smiths woes continued when South Africa were fined for their slow over-rate. Match Referee Chris Broad ruled that South Africa were one over short of their target at the scheduled finish of the Bangladesh innings. 

Players were fined five per cent of match fees for every over not bowled in time and the captain Smiths punishment was doubled to 10 per cent.

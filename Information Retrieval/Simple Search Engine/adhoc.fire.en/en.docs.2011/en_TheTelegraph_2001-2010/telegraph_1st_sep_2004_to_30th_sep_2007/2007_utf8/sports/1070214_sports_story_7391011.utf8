 City races put off 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: The dangerous underfoot condition of the racetrack, because of intermittent rain since Tuesday morning, has prompted the stewards, RCTC, to cancel the city races scheduled for Wednesday.

 Stewards have also decided to conduct the inter-venue betting operation on Mysore races on Wednesday, according to an RCTC notification.

 The next city race fixture, on Saturday, features the 1,600m Governors Cup.

St Georges: Australia captain Ricky Ponting believes spinner Brad Hogg will play a key role when the champions take on South Africa in Wednesdays World Cup semi-final. 

Left-arm spinner Hogg took four for 29 as Australia crushed fellow-semifinalists New Zealand by 215 runs in the trans-Tasman rivals final Super Eight match. 

Having already defeated South Africa (by 83 runs) in a group match last month, Ponting is confident former postman Hogg and the likes of part-time spinners Michael Clarke and Andrew Symonds would help deliver another victory against the Proteas who are known for their weakness against spin. 

South Africa probably wont play a spinner. Those conditions and the way our spinners are going, probably give us a bit of an edge, Ponting said. 

Australias imposing total of 348 for six, against a New Zealand attack missing Shane Bond and Jacob Oram, was built around Matthew Haydens 103 the left-handed openers third century of the tournament equalling the record for the most hundreds at a single World Cup. 

We knew theyd have a weakened attack going into the game. We knew if we kept our partnership going wed get a lot of bad balls, explained Ponting, who put on 137 with Hayden after Adam Gilchrists early exit. 

Our batting has been excellent and its getting better with the crucial part of this Cup approaching. Its a really exciting time and one all the guys in the dressing room are looking forward to. 

Stephen Fleming, though, was adamant New Zealand will bounce back from Fridays mauling. If there is a positive, we havent wasted a good performance, said Fleming. We havent wasted anything at all so were just going to get up, wipe it off and look forward. 

Now it comes down to two games, and if we start analysing too much, we wont look forward to what is coming up we have an opportunity to win two games and the World Cup, Fleming said. 

The captain said he expects Bond and Oram will be ready for the semi-final. 

We are a dangerous side. We can play like we did today, or we can play a semi-final and chase down 350. We are even more dangerous now that we have two games to win.

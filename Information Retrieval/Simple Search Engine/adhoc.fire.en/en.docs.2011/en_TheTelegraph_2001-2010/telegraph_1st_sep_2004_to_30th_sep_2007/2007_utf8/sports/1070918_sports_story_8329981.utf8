 Pakistan pile up 189/6 vs Lanka 

Johannesburg: Explosive half centuries by captain Shoaib Malik and Younis Khan helped Pakistan post a competitive 189 for six in their Super Eight match against Sri Lanka at the ICC World Twenty20 match here on Monday. 

Malik notched up a 31-ball 57 and Younis hit a 35-ball 51 to revive the Pakistani innings and pile up enough runs on the board to give their bowlers a chance. 

Seasoned campaigner Chaminda Vaas and Dilhara Fernando made life difficult for the Pakistani batsmen with their accurate bowling. 

Fernando scalped Salman Butt (12) and Mohammed Hafeez (10) while Vaas dismissed the explosive Imran Nazir (7) to leave Pakistan tottering at 33 for three in 5.5 overs. 

However, the experienced duo of Younis and Malik shouldered the responsibility well to build a 101-run partnership for the fourth wicket by playing some breathtaking shots. 

Playing aggressively, Younis hit two fours and three sixes for his half century b efore being caught by Tillekeratne Dilshan off Lasith Malinga. 

With five overs left, Shahid Afridi joined Malik and both of them continued the blitzkrieg without any break until Malinga-Dilshan tango worked again to plot the Pakistan captains downfall.

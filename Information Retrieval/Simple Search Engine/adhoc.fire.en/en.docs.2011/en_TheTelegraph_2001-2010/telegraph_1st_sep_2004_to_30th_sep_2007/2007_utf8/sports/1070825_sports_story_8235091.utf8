 Boucher fined for Kallis comment

Durban: Wicketkeeper Mark Boucher has been fined 60 per cent of the match fees he will earn during the ICC World Twenty20 meet, Cricket South Africa said on Friday. 

The fine, which could see Boucher docked up to $3,500, was punishment for his speaking out on the omission of all-rounder Jacques Kallis from South Africas squad for the tournament from September 11 to 24. 

Hes the best all-rounder weve ever had and hes saved more games than anyone realises and he is a far better one-day player than he is given credit for, Boucher was quoted as saying in Business Day on August 15. It is either those who have an issue with him, and have a chip on their shoulders, or those who have ulterior motives. 

Bouchers comments were deemed to have contravened several clauses of the CSAs code of conduct, including those dealing with bringing the game into disrepute, and he was summoned to a disciplinary hearing on August 17. 

Senior players have a responsibility to the CSA and to cricket in general, a media statement on Friday quoted CSA disciplinary commissioner Michael Kuper as saying. (REUTERS)

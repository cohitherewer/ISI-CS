 Afridi still on top of best players list

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Pakistan batsman Shahid Afridi heads the list of contenders for the Player of the Tournament award at the ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa. 

According to an ICC media release, the allrounder has so far polled seven votes to top the latest table, but there are still four players who can catch him as they all come from the sides contesting Mondays final India and Pakistan. 

Those players include three of Afridis teammates Misbah-ul Haq, Younus Khan and his captain, Shoaib Malik as well as Indias six-hitting star Yuvraj Singh. All five players have performed strongly during the tournament thus far. 

Leg-spinner Afridi is the joint leading wicket-taker alongside Australias Stuart Clark with 12 victims, and has also scored rapidly whenever he has reached the batting crease, making 91 runs from just 45 balls faced.

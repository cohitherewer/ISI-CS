The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Lanka hang in for 5-run win

 - Sourav undergoes precautionary X-ray 

Rajkot: In a dramatic turn of events in the dying stages, India suffered an inexplicable lower order batting collapse and allowed Sri Lanka to clinch a nail-biting five-run victory in the second one-day International here on Sunday. 

Chasing Sri Lankas 257 for eight, built around Kumar Sangakkaras sterling 110, the Indians were cruising at 235 for five at one stage before losing the plot completely to give the visitors a 1-0 lead in the four-match series. 

The first ODI in Calcutta was abandoned owing to rain. 

The capacity crowd at the Madhavrao Scindia Stadium was left shell-shocked as the hosts made a hash of their chase, losing their last five wickets for 17 runs off 27 balls. 

It was a disappointing end for the Indians who had the game under control till the 45th over with Sourav Ganguly (62) and Sachin Tendulkar (54) putting them on track with a 100-run third-wicket partnership. 

[Meanwhile, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said there was nothing to worry about the thumb injury Sourav suffered while trying to take a catch. It is a minor injury and we had a precautionary X-ray done. He is very much available for selection for the World Cup.] 

Earlier, the in-form Sangakkara scored a masterly 110 to help Sri Lanka recover from a top order collapse and post a competitive total. 

He was involved in a fifth wicket century partnership with Tillekeratne Dilshan after the visitors slumped to 58 for four after being put in.

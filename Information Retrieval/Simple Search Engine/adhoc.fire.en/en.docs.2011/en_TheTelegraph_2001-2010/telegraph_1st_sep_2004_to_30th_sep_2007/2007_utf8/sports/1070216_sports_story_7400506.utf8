 Samuels in WI XV

London: Marlon Samuels has been drafted in in the West Indies 15-man World Cup squad. The selectors have also sprung one surprise with Kieron Pollard, the 19-year-old Trinidad allrounder, beating off more experienced names for the final place. 

Lendl Simmons has taken the final batting slot while Ian Bradshaw, Daren Powell, Corey Collymore and Jerome Taylor are the four pacemen, leaving Fidel Edwards on the sidelines. West Indies open the World Cup campaign against Pakistan in Jamaica on March 13.

Calcutta: India cruised into the semi-finals of the 2nd Commonwealth Volleyball Championship after beating Sri Lanka 25-21, 25-14, 25-14 in the their second group A outing at the Netaji Indoor Stadium on Monday evening. 

Australia also made the semis from the hosts group following their 25-16, 25-18, 25-22 triumph over Bangladesh. 

India started on an aggressive note and outsmarted the Sri Lankans in all departments during the 64-minute encounter. 

The Indians were a much-improved side compared to their performance on Sunday. Both the spikers, Sanjay Kumar and Sube Singh, were brilliant and fetched the team 13 and 11 points, respectively. 

Meanwhile, the Nigerian team which was originally scheduled to play India on Monday evening didnt arrive. 

The organisers rescheduled their fixtures thrice but finally gave up.

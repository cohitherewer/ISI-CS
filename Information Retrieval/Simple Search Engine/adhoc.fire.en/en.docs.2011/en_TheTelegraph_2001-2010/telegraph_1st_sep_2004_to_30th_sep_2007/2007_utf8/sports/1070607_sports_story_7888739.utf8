Paris: Rafael Nadal moved closer to a third straight French Open title on Wednesday, beating 1998 champion Carlos Moya 6-4, 6-3, 6-0 in the quarter finals. 

The second-seeded Spaniard, who is 19-0 in his career at the French Open, has not dropped a set in the tournament this year. He will next face Novak Djokovic, who reached his first Grand Slam semi-final by beating Igor Andreev of Russia 6-3, 6-3, 6-3. I feel good, Nadal said. I think I am progressing more as the tournament goes on. I feel a little better than last year. 

Moya could not find a way to upset Nadals rhythm. He was playing very deep, very high, Moya said. Even when the ball bounces in the middle of the court, it bounces with so much spin its difficult to attack him. 

Last year at Roland Garros, Djokovic retired while trailing Nadal in the quarter finals. Hes the best player in the world on this surface, the sixth-seeded Djokovic said. He plays with a lot of motivation and confidence. Physically hes very ready. 

Nadal broke Moya in the fifth game of the first set to lead 3-2, but Moya broke back, setting up the chance with a drop shot. At the end, Nadal won the final eight games of the match. After he won the first set everything was easier for him, Moya said. It was going to be very tough to beat him. 

Moya save one match point with a backhand volley. He double-faulted to set up Nadals second match point, which Nadal won with a forehand that Moya could barely get his racket on. Im not very happy with the way I played today, Moya said. 

Djokovic also had an easy time against Andreev. I was aggressive from the start and that was the key, Djokovic said. The result is not showing the right picture about the match it was not easy to play Andreev. Hes the kind of player who makes you work for the points, he produces a lot of spin. 

Nadal is 3-1 against Djokovic, but the Serb beat Nadal in the quarter finals at Key Biscayne, Florida, in March. Its not the same match, its not the same player, Djokovic said. On clay you have to do more to try and earn the point against him. 

Djokovic leapt in the air when he went 3-0 up in the third set. The 125th-ranked Andreev could not find a way back, and Djokovic won on his first match point when Andreev hit a forehand into the net one of many similar errors he made during the match. In the other semi-final on Friday, top-ranked Roger Federer will try to improve to 9-0 against fourth-seeded Nikolay Davydenko.

 Jeev shares 12th spot

 Malaysian Open 

Kuala Lumpur: Thai teenager Chinarat Phadungsil shot a 5-under-par 67 with seven birdies on Friday to take the second round clubhouse lead at the rain-disrupted Malaysian Open. 

Nearly 80 players will complete their second round on Saturday morning after rain and lightning prompted organisers to halt Fridays play. 

Chinarat, 18, held a two-stroke lead over a group of five players sharing second place, including Englands Simon Dyson (68) and Marcus Higley (67), and Finlands Mikko Ilonen (68). 

Indias Jeev Milkha Singh, who was 21st overnight, was the only Indian to complete his round, finishing with another one-under 71 to be at tied 12th with eight others. He is at two-under 142 for the tournament.

 CA asked to cancel Zimbabwe tour

 Ricky Ponting 

Melbourne: Australian Prime Minister John Howard has ordered the countrys national cricket team to cancel their planned tour of Zimbabwe later this year. 

The Australian government had previously outlined its determination to scrap the tour in protest over Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabes regime. 

Howard said on Sunday he had instructed foreign minister Alexander Downer to contact Cricket Australia (CA) to tell them the planned one-day series in September would be cancelled. 

The government through the foreign minister has written to the organisation of Cricket Australia instructing that the tour not go ahead, Howard told ABC radio on Sunday. We are convinced that if the tour went ahead, there would be an enormous propaganda boost to the Mugabe regime. 

The Mugabe regime is behaving like the Gestapo towards its political opponents. The living standards in the country are probably the lowest of any in the world. 

CA Chief Executive James Sutherland said while he accepted the governments responsibility to make decisions about international relationships, his organisation would need time to assess the implications of a pullout. 

The government said earlier in the week that it would indemnify CA against any financial losses incurred as a result of cancelling the tour, estimated to be around A$2.4 million ($2 million). 

Howard said he felt the decision was what players wanted. 

I dont think its fair to place a foreign policy decision of this magnitude on the shoulders of sportsmen, Howard said. 

The International Cricket Councils approach to this issue has not been helpful, he said. The government has previously called on the ICC to change its rules to allow teams to forfeit tours to countries where serious human rights abuses are occurring. Regrettably, the ICC has declined to do so. 

Zimbabwe is still recognised by the ICC, though the sports ruling body has withdrawn the sides Test status. 

Countries that refuse to tour the African state can be sanctioned. 

ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed suggested, however, in a radio interview he was pleased with the Australian governments stance, adding that he was unhappy when such decisions were left to cricket administrators and players. 

 Speed said the ICC hopes the three-match series could now be played somewhere else. 

As for whether the matches can take place in a neutral venue, given the choice between that and those matches not taking place at all, we would obviously prefer them to be played, Speed said. 

 That will be for the two boards to work out 

 but we would encourage them to look at all options, 

 he added.

 JOHN HOWARD (Australian 

 Prime Minister): The government through the foreign minister 

 has written to the organisation of Cricket Australia instructing 

 that the tour not go ahead. We are convinced that if the 

 tour went ahead, there would be an enormous propaganda boost 

 to the Mugabe regime.

 LOVEMORE BANDA (Zimbabwe Cricket media 

 manager): Under the Future Tours Programme, Australia are 

 due to tour Zimbabwe in September. That is the document 

 we are working with, and we expect Australia to fulfil their 

 obligation.

 RICKY PONTING: Im comfortable 

 that the Australian government has taken the responsibility 

 for making international affairs decisions on behalf of 

 the country.

 MALCOLM SPEED (ICC chief executive): 

 It (the governments stance) fits within the ICC policy...What 

 we dont like is governments expressing opinions against 

 the Zimbabwe government but then leaving it up to the cricket 

 administrators to make a decision. 

 JAMES SUTHERLAND (CA chief executive): 

 Given our commitment to help develop Zimbabwe cricket, we 

 will now explore the possibility of playing the three ODIs 

 we are due to play against Zimbabwe in September at a neutral 

 venue outside Zimbabwe.

 Hoggard may miss third Test 

NICK HOULT

Matthew Hoggard has little chance of being fit for next weeks third Test against the West Indies after suffering a recurrence of his thigh injury. 

The 30-year-old was hoping to prove his fitness by playing club cricket for Baildon on Saturday before featuring for Yorkshire in Sundays Friends Provident Trophy match against Durham. But Hoggard felt some discomfort during a short net session at Headingley on Thursday and has been ruled out of contention for the weekend. 

Without any match practice to test his injury, Hoggard is unlikely to be considered for next weeks Test at Old Trafford on a wicket which is expected to be fast.

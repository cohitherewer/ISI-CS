 Chelsea draw gives United title

London: Manchester United won the Premier League on Sunday as 10-man Chelsea, needing victory to keep the title race alive, could only draw 1-1 at Arsenal. 

The result, coming a day after United beat Manchester City 1-0, left Alex Fergusons side seven points clear of Chelsea with two games remaining. 

United had last won the crown in 2003. 

Arsenal led by a 43rd-minute Gilberto penalty after Chelsea centre back Khalid Boulahrouz brought down Julio Baptista and was sent off. 

Michael Essiens header with 20 minutes remaining gave Chelsea hope and led to a furious late assault. 

However, they were unable to find the second goal. So, Arsenals Stamford Bridge meeting with United on Wednesday will no longer be a title decider, but merely a handover ceremony. 

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho congratulated United and said he was proud of his team. He emphasised the season was far from over as they could still win the FA Cup to add to the League Cup they have already won. 

Maybe Im prouder today than when we were champions ... because my players are heroes. I think they did it brilliantly. The season is not over, we have a final to play. The season for me was magnificent, he told a television channel. 

Manchester United manager, Ferguson said that despite being in the running for other silverware this season, winning the league title had been the priority. 

Some years ago I used to always have an obsession with winning in Europe but I think thats been overtaken by the demands of the Premier League because I think its the highest league in Europe now and to win it is a big big achievement, he told a television sports channel. 

The draw leaves Arsenal level with third-placed Liverpool on 67 points but behind on goal difference. Both sides are already assured of a place in the qualifying round of the Champions League. 

Chelsea, who beat Arsenal 2-1 in a stormy League Cup final in February, beat them away in the league only once in 17 years. The Gunners had suffered only one league defeat to West Ham United. However, in a game they had to win, they were without 31-goal striker Didier Drogba, as well as Andriy Shevchenko and Michael Ballack.

In absence of their chief target man, Chelsea were forced to play a more intricate build-up as diminutive duo Shaun Wright-Phillips and Joe Cole tried to create openings for the often isolated Salomon Kalou. 

Arsenal also attempted to fashion an opening with their familiar short, sharp passes but the breakthrough came with a simple length-of-the field kick by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann which Boulahrouz misjudged. As he scrambled back to try and regain ground on Baptista, he brought the Brazilian down in the box and a red card brought his first appearance for seven weeks to a premature end. 

Gilberto dispatched the penalty virtually the only shot on target from either side in the half and Chelseas hopes of a third successive championship were just about over. 

Arsenal initially took control after the break but Emmanuel Adebayor and William Gallas missed good chances, allowing Chelsea back into the game. 

In their first sustained attack of the second half, Wright-Phillips clipped in a near-post cross that Essien, escaping from his enforced defensive role, expertly glanced in. 

The goal lifted Chelsea and, after Alexandr Hleb had blown another great opportunity for Arsenal, they piled on the pressure. 

Essien shot just wide on the turn, Frank Lampard missed his kick with the goal beckoning and, in the 90th minute, Lehmann saved well from Kalou, who should have scored. 

Eight days ago Chelsea were dreaming of an unprecedented quadruple but, after being knocked out of the Champions League semi-final by Liverpool on Tuesday, they now have only the May 19 FA Cup final against United to try for a double.

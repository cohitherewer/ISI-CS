 SHARP SINGLES 

Nightmare cruise for Shaun Tait 

Basseterre: Australia fast bowler Shaun Tait endured

 four hours of hell on the high seas on Monday during a day set aside for

 rest and recreation. Tait told reporters on Tuesday he had opted for a ride

 on a small cruise boat as the world champions took it easy before starting

 serious training for Saturdays final World Cup group A match against South Africa. It was quite choppy, he said. It was sort of four hours of hell, I spent four hours in the foetal position, basically. It was a nightmare. I dont

 think I will be heading out again for the rest of my life.

Hairy issue

 Kingston: Zimbabwe players have been ordered to cut off their flowing locks. The Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) told at least three members of the squad Tawanda Mupariwa, Keith Dabengwa and Stuart Matsinkenyeri to conform with the ruling. Media manager Lovemore Banda told a local newspaper that the idea was to have all the players looking uniform. The ZCU decided that in terms of uniformity, appearance and neatness, the players need to appear as the best representatives for their country Therefore those who wear locks were told to cut them, Banda was quoted as saying on Wednesday.

Vettori hopes

 Gros Islet: Daniel Vettori hopes his emergence as a world-class spinner can help propel New Zealand to a maiden World Cup title. The 28-year-old left-arm1er is playing in his third World Cup but is yet to leave his mark on the competition. Im probably a better bowler now than I was in 1999 and 2003, and a lot more is expected of me, said Vettori after taking his career ODI tally to 189 wickets. Shane Bond and myself are the strike bowlers, and we both have to live up to it if we want to do well.

Advice for SA

 Basseterre: After Scotland hit 55 runs in the last five overs Tuesday to record their best World Cup score of 186, captain Ryan Watson hinted South Africa may hold an edge over Australia but not due to their bowling. I like the way they are playing at the moment, although I worry about the fact they dont have a spinner in the side, he said. These wickets are quite flat and they can be slightly one dimensional. South Africas fielding gives them a massive edge, but I think Id get a spinner into the side to break up that attack.

Kerr no more

 Kingston: Former Irish Cricket Union president Bob Kerr has died of a suspected heart attack. Irish assistant coach Matt Dwyer said on Wednesday that Kerr died during the night from what we believe was a heart attack. He was with his wife on holidays and spent time with the fans, Dwyer said. We last spoke to him after the Pakistan match and he was in good spirits. He wasnt in ill-health. Dwyer said Kerrs wife called hotel staff in the middle of the night and he died on the way to the hospital. It is the second death involving people associated with the Ireland versus Pakistan World Cup match on Saturday in Jamaica.

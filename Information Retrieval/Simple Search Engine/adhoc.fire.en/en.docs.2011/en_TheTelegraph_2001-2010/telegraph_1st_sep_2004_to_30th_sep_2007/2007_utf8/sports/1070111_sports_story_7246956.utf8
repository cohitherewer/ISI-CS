 Dope scandal a thing of the past: Shoaib

Karachi: Controversial fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar, a late inclusion in the Pakistani squad for the tour of South Africa, believes the dope saga is behind him despite the matter lying before CAS. 

I have been cleared by a competent committee and do not believe Im under any kind of threat. I dont even think about it anymore, he said referring to the dope scandal that had put his career jeorpardy before he was exonerated of the charge. 

Drafted in as a late replacement for an injured Umar Gul, Shoaib would miss out on the first Test, but the Rawalpindi Express was confident of coming good in the rest of the matches. 

It is great to be back and even though I was looking forward to the opening Test, Im not really disappointed at missing it because there would be two more matches to go in the series against South Africa. Im fit and raring to go, he was quoted as saying in a Pakistan daily. 

Shoaib also said captain Inzamam-ul Haq, who is believed to be instrumental in the bowler being ignored from the initial 17-member squad, should be more supportive of his teammates. 

I believe as captain Inzamam should be more supportive of his teammates, especially if they are going through a rough time. (PTI)

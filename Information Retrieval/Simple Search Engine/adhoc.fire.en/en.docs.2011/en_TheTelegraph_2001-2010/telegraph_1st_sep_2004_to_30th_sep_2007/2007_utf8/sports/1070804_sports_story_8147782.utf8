Leicester: Bengal pacer Ranadeb Bose (five for 51) picked up his five-wicket haul of the tour and Ramesh Powar (four for 85) did a quick mopping job as India bowled out Sri Lanka A for 266 runs, an hour after tea, on Day I of their three-day warm up game at Grace Road here. 

India finished the day at 25 for one after losing the wicket of Dinesh Karthik (11). Wasim Jaffer (seven) and Gautam Gambhir (3) were at the crease when stumps were drawn. 

The Sri Lanka A innings revolved around Michael Vandort (52) and Thiulan Samaraweera (75). 

Opting to bat, Sri Lanka A were sailing along merrily at 105 for one, before Boses excellent spell just before and after lunch removed Dilruwan Perera (34), Malinda Warnapura (three) and Vandort in quick succession. 

Just before tea, Bose trapped Kaushal Lokuarachchi (35) leg before. The Bengal pacer eventually wrapped up the innings when he had Chanaka Welegedara (one) caught at the wicket. 

Powar did a fine bowl on a decent pitch after he was introduced as early as the 10th over of the innings. He took a wicket in his first over when he dismissed Mehela Udawatta (20) and then he went on to mop up the tail pretty quickly removing Samaraweera (75), Rangana Herath (0) and Akalanka Ganegama (0) as Sri Lanka A lost its last four wickets for just seven runs. 

In fact, Sri Lanka were rescued by their sixth wicket pair of Samaraweera and Lokuarachichi who batted with lot of pluck, and some luck, to prop up their side after Bose strike had reduced them to 146 for five soon after lunch. 

Samaraweera and Lokuarachchi grounded their heels to stitch together a decent stand of 62 runs before the latter was out at the stroke of tea. 

Sri Lanka A openers Vandort and Udawatta made a slow start putting on 32 runs for the first wicket before the latter was bowled by Powar in his very first over for 20. He tried to sweep, got a top edge and the ball spun back on to his stumps. 

Vandort and Perera featured in the most exciting stand of the innings putting on 73 runs for the second wicket. 

The 27-year-old Vandort batted with discipline on a bright sunny morning. Vandorts good technique and temperament on exhibition showed just why he is special talent. 

Of course, the left-hander did have a huge slice of luck as he scratched around initially taking over an hour to reach double figures. When he was on seven, Karthik who kept wickets missed an easy stumping chance off Powar. 

Perera (34, 3x4, 1x6) was definitely the more flamboyant of the two, sweeping Powar for a six before he fell just before lunch edging Bose. 

Bose continued his good work in the post-lunch session when he had Warnapura caught for just three before accounting for the well set Vandort for 52.

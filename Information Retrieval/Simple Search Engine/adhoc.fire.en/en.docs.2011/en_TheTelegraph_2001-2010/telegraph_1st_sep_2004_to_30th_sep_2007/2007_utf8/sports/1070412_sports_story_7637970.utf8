 Essien shunts out Valencia

Manchester Uniteds stylish virtues may have been spectacularly paraded at Old Trafford on Tuesday night, but at the Mestalla came a show of all the strengths that may yet make Chelsea the champions of Europe perhaps even the first club to win the quadruple. 

Substantial hurdles still lie in front of them but, as they attacked Valencia with all the conviction handed down by Jos Mourinho, their charismatic and confrontational manager, it was impossible to imagine Chelseas season finishing with just the Carling Cup in the trophy cabinet. 

The Portuguese will surely be repeating the nights showy celebrations before the campaign and perhaps he himself are out. 

Chelseas triumph over Valencia deserved better than to be overshadowed by the feast of goals elsewhere because, while it was secured moments from the end, the win was well earned. The English champions may often be over-reliant on grinding down opponents rather than outplaying them, but few teams dominate Valencia at the Mestalla as Mourinhos men did in the second half. 

Only a few minutes before Essien raced forward, Caiza-res had pulled off a save that deserves to be shown as many times as any of Uniteds collection of goals against AS Roma when, somehow, he clawed Michael Ballacks header over the crossbar from almost inside the net. Shades of Gordon Banks and Pel in the 1970 World Cup finals in Mexico. 

That breathtaking save seemed certain to have sent the tie into extra time but, even then, all the wise money would have been on Chelsea, who had equalised through Andriy Shevchenko in the second period after Fernando Morientess first-half strike. 

Mourinhos half-time intervention, throwing on Joe Cole for Lassana Diarra, switching to 4-3-3 and, critically, putting Essien at right back, had paid off brilliantly. Chelsea had forced the pace of the game and Essien, relentless on his return to the side after a month out, proved how much he had been missed. Hes an incredible athlete, Mourinho said. 

The Ghanaian will be suspended for the first leg against Liverpool because of an early caution on Tuesday night, but his return gives Mourinho another option at this hectic time of the season, while Joe Coles puppy-like enthusiasm makes up for his lack of match sharpness after more than four months out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Liverpool outclass Bolton 3-0 

London: Liverpool turned on the style in the second-half to beat Bolton Wanderers 3-0 at Anfield on Monday and leapfrog their Lancashire rivals into third place in the Premier League. 

Excellent volleys by Peter Crouch and Steven Gerrard midway through the second half and a late third goal from Dick Kuyt made up for a poor first half and completed a satisfying holiday period for Rafael Benitezs team. They now moved up to 40 points. 

Liverpool looked the more purposeful but though they dominated first-half possession their chances were limited. The nearest they came to scoring was a well-struck 25-metre shot by defender Steve Finnan, which was tipped over by goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen in the Finns 300th league game for Bolton. 

Boltons ambition seemed to entirely consist of defending and hoping to snatch a late goal.The game then completely changed complexion in the space of less than two minutes with two superbly-taken goals. 

Crouch got the first in the 62nd minute when he met a Jermaine Pennant right-wing cross with an overhead kick from 12 metres out. Kuyt then took over the supply duties, clipping in another cross from the right which Gerrard met with a neatly-taken, side-footed volley. (Reuters)

 NZ all out for 73

Auckland: New Zealand crashed to their worst ever one-day loss Saturday in a humiliating 189-run defeat conjured by some magic from Sri Lankan veterans Sanath Jayasuriya and Chaminda Vaas. 

New Zealand could only muster 73 runs their second lowest-ever one-day total in what skipper Stephen Fleming conceded was a rubbish performance in chasing the tourists solid 262 for six. 

A whirlwind 70 off 44 balls by 37-year-old opener Jayasuriya provided the fireworks in the Sri Lankan innings. 

Another important contribution came from Kumar Sangakkara, who held the Sri Lankan innings together with 79 from 103 balls after it threatened to go off the rails with the fall of three quick wickets. 

In reply, New Zealand had no answer to a great spell of in-swing bowling from 32-year-old Vaas. He trapped New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming (0), Ross Taylor (0) and Hamish Marshall (3) in successive overs to finish with 3/10 from eight overs. 

Speedster Lasith Malinga was also devastating, taking 3/14 from eight overs and master spinner Muttiah Muralidharan had 2/7 from his 2.3 overs at the tail of the innings. 

The victory leaves the series tied at 2-2 with one match left to play on Tuesday. 

Its rubbish, thats what it was. I would certainly pay credit to some fine bowling by Chaminda at the top who swung the ball but there was some average batting, said Fleming, returning to the side after being rested for the first three matches. The first half of the game was normal, the second half was comical. 

Fleming said the team was pretty alarmed by the performance and their recent history of failing to score runs in the top and middle of the batting order. 

Jayasuriya rolled back the years with a smashing 70 off just 44 deliveries while Sangakkara rebuilt the innings with a sturdy 79 from 103 deliveries after New Zealand seamer Mark Gillespie snared the first three wickets. 

Jayasuriya slammed seven fours and five sixes as Sri Lanka raced to 102 without loss after just 15 overs.

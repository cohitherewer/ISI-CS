 Brett Lee ruled out of World Cup

 - Its hollow but Im still excited, says replacement stuart Clark

Sydney: Australia will be without pace spearhead Brett Lee at the World Cup after he was ruled out with an ankle injury on Friday. 

Lees absence is a further blow to the defending champions troubled build-up to the March 13-April 28 tournament in the Caribbean, following a loss of form and injuries to a number of key players. 

Cricket Australia said Stuart Clark, who didnt make the cut originally despite some impressive performances in the Ashes series, will replace Lee. 

The 30-year-old Lee tore ligaments in his left ankle during fielding practice in New Zealand last week. He had been hoping to recover in time to make the trip to the West Indies but was officially withdrawn after visiting a specialist. 

Australian team doctor Trefor James said a review by Lees orthopaedic surgeon showed he would not be fit to resume bowling for two to three months. 

Australias chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said in a statement: It is a great disappointment for Brett Lee that he is unable to take place in the Cricket World Cup and is a significant blow for the planning and preparation in place for the tournament. However, it does give a tremendous opportunity to Stuart Clark. 

Clark said his selection was tinged with sadness for Lee. 

Its really disappointing for Brett, because hes a friend in the team and a friend outside of the team as well, he said. 

Its hollow, but Im still excited about going to the World Cup. 

Lee is Australias main strike bowler and his withdrawal is a major blow to the teams chances of winning the World Cup for the third time in a row. 

Clark knows he cannot fill Lees shoes but is determined to prove his worth. 

Ive got better at bowling in the power plays, he said. And thats what Ill be looking to do while Im over there. (But) I dont expect the new ball, I dont expect any favours. 

Australia have lost their last five ODIs their longest losing streak in a decade and are facing a mounting injury list. 

Allrounder Andrew Symonds underwent surgery this month to repair a torn bicep tendon in his right shoulder and opening batsman Matthew Hayden broke his big toe against New Zealand on Tuesday. 

Skipper Ricky Ponting is recovering from a back problem and middle-order batsman Michael Clarke has a hip complaint.

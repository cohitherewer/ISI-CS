Melbourne: Four world records were set on Tuesday at the Fina World Championships three by American superstars Michael Phelps, Natalie Coughlin and Aaron Peirsol, the other by lesser-known Italian Federica Pellegrini. 

Phelps set his world mark in the 200m freestyle, in a time of 1 minute, 43.86 seconds, to break Australian Ian Thorpes previous record of 1:44.06 at Fukuoka, Japan in 2001. 

In the next race, Coughlin broke her own world record in the 100m backstroke, finishing in 59.44. Her previous record of 59.58 was set in 2002. 

Peirsol broke the world 100m backstroke record in a time of 52.98 seconds, bettering his previous record of 53.17 set at Indianapolis, Indiana in April 2005. Fellow American Ryan Lochte took the silver in 53.50 and Liam Tancock of Britain was third in 53.61. 

Peirsol is the only swimmer to have won the event three times and at three consecutive world championships. He has six individual gold medals overall at world championships. 

I think its the most impressive team Ive ever been on, Peirsol said. Michael was incredible, Natalie did well. So I had to do something too. 

Pellegrini broke her world record in a womens 200m freestyle semi-final in a time of 1:56.64, improving on the previous mark of Franziska van Almsick of Germany, set August 3, 2002 at Berlin. 

An amazed Pellegrini put her hands to her lips, then raised her arms skyward in celebration. Pellegrini admitted Wednesdays final will be tough. 

It will be a difficult race, but I will just try to swim as I did today, she said. As far as I am concerned I have already won. Among all these world records tonight, there is finally also an Italian one. 

The Americans won their fourth gold medal of the night when Kate Ziegler finished first in the 1,500m in a time of 15:53.05. Flavia Rigamonti of Switzerland took the silver in 15:55.38 while Japans Ai Shibata won bronze in a time of 15:58.55. 

Australian Leisel Jones won the other final on Tuesday, taking the womens 100m breaststroke gold in a time of 1:05.72 ahead of Tara Kirk of the United States and Anna Khlistunova of the Ukraine. 

Not known for going to the early lead, Phelps opened under world-record pace on the first 50 meters, with Pieter van den Hoogenband close behind. 

Phelps pulled away from the Dutchman coming off the wall at 150m, and moved out to a full body-length lead. Van den Hoogenband took silver in 1:46.28. Park Tae-hwan of South Korea earned the bronze. 

It was Phelps record 12th World Championship gold and 15th medal overall. Thorpe, Van den Hoogenband and Phelps finished 1-2-3 in the 200m free at Athens, the so-called Race of the Century and the only time all three of the swimming greats faced each other. 

The latest match-up was missing Thorpe, who retired in November at age 24. Thorpes mark was considered to be untouchable but Phelps slashed almost a second and half off his best time to overhaul Thorpes quickest swim. 

The American is competing in up to eight events at Rod Laver Arena this week and his victory makes him the man to beat in next years Beijing Olympics.

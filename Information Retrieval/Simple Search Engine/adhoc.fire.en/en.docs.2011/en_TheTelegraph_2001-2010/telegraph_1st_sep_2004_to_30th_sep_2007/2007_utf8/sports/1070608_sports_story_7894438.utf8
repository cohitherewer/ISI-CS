The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Kallis to lead SA in Ireland

A STAFF REPORTER

 Jacques Kallis 

Calcutta: Jacques Kallis will lead South Africa in the four ODI matches in Belfast. South Africa play three matches against India and one versus the hosts Ireland. 

Regular captain Graeme Smith was not considered for the tour because he recently underwent a surgery on his left knee. Shaun Pollock has also not been considered for the tour, according to a Cricket South Africa media release. 

[The Telegraph had reported on Wednesday that Kallis was expected to captain the Proteas in Ireland and Pollock wont be there.] 

Haroon Lorgat, national convenor of selectors, said: The selectors want to use this tour as an opportunity to introduce some new players into the one-day squad. 

Vernon Philander and Thandi Tshabalala have earned their maiden call up to the national side. JP Duminy, Morn van Wyk and Dale Steyn also return to the one-day squad. 

The potential and performances of these players were carefully monitored in the past by the selection panel and now is the right time to introduce them into the national squad, Lorgat added. 

About Smith and Pollocks unavailability, he said: They are key players and need to be carefully managed before the start of another demanding season. 

THE SQUAD 

Jacques Kallis (captain), Mark Boucher, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, Herschelle Gibbs, Andrew Hall, Justin Kemp, Charl Langeveldt, Andr Nel, Makhaya Ntini, Vernon Philander, Dale Steyn, Thandi Tshabalala, Morn van Wyk.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Best side in 14 years

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Cricket is a funny game as till Wednesday Hyderabad were in command, but the very next day Bengal turned the tables on Hyderabad, thanks to Ranadeb Boses devastating seven-wicket haul. In all Ranadeb grabbed a 10-wicket match haul. 

Ranadebs one long spell of 20 overs (before and after lunch) did that magic. Conceding just 25 runs, the pony-tailed speedster wrecked havoc, claiming seven Hyderabad wickets and bowling out the hosts for a meagre 76. With the 10-wicket haul, Ranadeb has now 31 wickets (three five-fors and one 10-wicket haul) in this years Ranji season. 

Rating this his best ever performance, Ranadeb told The Telegraph from Hyderabad: My best (7/24) was against Tripura during my debut season in 1998-99. However todays performance, obviously, is the best. It was against a better side, in the crucial second innings that too after they had taken a 100-plus lead, and on a slow pata wicket it brought our side into the match. Honestly speaking, in the morning we did not even think of getting two points (on the basis of first innings lead). 

He went on: Definitely the match will be a turning point for Bengal in our journey ahead were almost (90 per cent) into the semi-finals. Considering that were winning tomorrow, our job en route semis will be easier as we had an outright win over Punjab earlier. 

And our next opponents, Rajasthan, is not a good side getting at least two points at home will not be tough if we get two points there we might as well top our group. Now, were looking forward to winning the Ranji. This is the best side Bengal had in almost last 14 years; weve learnt our lesson well having lost to Uttar Pradesh in the final last year by a whisker, but this time were confident. 

Perhaps this match will give that fillip in our quest to winning Ranji

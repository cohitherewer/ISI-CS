 Anand sets up title clash with Aronian

Mainz: Viswanathan Anand set up a summit clash with defending champion Levon Aronian of Armenia after two wins and a draw on day two of preliminaries at the Chess 960 World Championship here. 

Anand, who started off with three draws on the opening day, defeated Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan and Etienne Bacrot of France in the return game before settling for a draw with Aronian to seal his place in the final. 

After a fine 2.5/3 start, Aronian was the worthy winner of the preliminaries after scoring a victory over Kasimdzhanov and drawing the remaining two games with Bacrot and Anand. 

The defending champion was clinical on his way to the final, where he starts as a favourite given his experience in this variant of the game. (PTI)

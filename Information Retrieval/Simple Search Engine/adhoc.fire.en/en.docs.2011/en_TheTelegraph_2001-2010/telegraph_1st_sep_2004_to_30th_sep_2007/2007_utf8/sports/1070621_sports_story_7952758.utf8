 Virginia Wade still in pink of things

 - As Wimbledon draws near, the 1977 ladies champion looks back on her triumph

How you remember 1977 depends on whether you were more into safety pins through the nose or cashmere cardigans back then. There was Sid Vicious, the punk rocker who wore safety pins and a padlock necklace, and played on the Sex Pistols God Save the Queen. And then there was Virginia Wade, the tennis player who wore a natty pink cardigan and won Wimbledon in front of the queen. 

Vicious died two years later, of a heroin overdose but, 30 summers on from doing her bit to celebrate the queens Silver Jubilee, Wade is fit and well and hardly seems to have changed much from that day on Centre Court. 

I was a little older than most players when I won. I was 31, and so I dont think I look that different now, said the personable Wade, who became known as Our Ginny, as if the British public all wanted a bit of her. People do still recognise me a lot. When they see me in the street, they swing their arms as if they are hitting a tennis ball. 

Taxi drivers are pretty good; they always have something to say. If you were in your mid-teens when I won, it was quite a big event, as a lot of schools allowed kids the time off to watch the final the womens final was played on a Friday in those days. 

When sports fans recall 1977, they tend to think about that pink cardie. Indeed, when you are invited around to Wades Chelsea flat to go on a nostalgia trip, it is mildly disappointing that she does not greet you on arrival wearing that iconic cashmere cardigan, the one with the monogrammed VW on the front. No Briton, whether male or female, whether wearing a cardigan or not, has won Wimbledon since Wade absurd, ridiculous and frustrating, she says about that. 

You can imagine that the queen likes the fact that her Silver Jubilee year is remembered for sporting success and not just for a punk rockers hang-them-all sneer (sort of, the queen isnt exactly known as a racket-head). 

The queens choice of outfit that day convinced Wade, who was wearing a white dress with pink piping as well as that cardigan, that she would beat Hollands Betty Stove. 

We turned around to curtsy in front of the queen, and I thought to myself, Oh, shes wearing a hat and a coat in exactly the same pink, thats a good omen, she recalled. 

But the queen is famously stand-offish towards tennis, as Wade probably knew even then. I dont think the Queen wore pink on purpose, of course not, Wade said. I dont think she really knew what was going on. She just had to be there. She hasnt been back to Wimbledon since, shes not really into it. Shes not into tennis at all. 

Shes the patron of the Lawn Tennis Association, so she went to the opening of their National Tennis Centre this year. But that was a little embarrassing. 

I got an invitation just two weeks before. I mean, they should have made sure I could be there. There was no one there with any reputation from British tennis. The LTA didnt get their act together and get an invitation out in time. I had another commitment, in fact. I was in California. It was probably irrelevant but sometimes those things end up looking like a bit of a damp squib if you dont get them right. 

There was a picture of the Queen standing in the rain on her own under an umbrella and it left a memory which wasnt quite right. 

Did playing in front of the Queen make it more stressful for Wade that day in 77? No, I felt so much less pressure that year. I even had second thoughts about playing Wimbledon, as I had never really performed at my best there. It was suggested to me that if I felt so negative about it, then why was I bothering to play? So maybe that shook me up. Then, as soon as I heard that the Queen was going to be there, well, I thought, Im going to be there too, Wade recalled. 

I was so sure that I was going to be there. I thought Id go through the tournament and reach the final and win it. It was a big occasion, but having the Queen there didnt make me more nervous. 

Understandably, that day on Centre Court frequently plays in the cinema in her head. It is interesting what you remember some of it seems like yesterday, some of it seems like a million years ago, said Wade, who attended a dinner in her honour on Monday night at the Bluebird restaurant near her flat (she actually spends most of the year at her New York apartment).

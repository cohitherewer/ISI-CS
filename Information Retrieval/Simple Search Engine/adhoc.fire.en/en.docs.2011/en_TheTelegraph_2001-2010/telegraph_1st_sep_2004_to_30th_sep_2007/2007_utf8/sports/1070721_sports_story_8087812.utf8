 Beckham set to miss tie

Denver: David Beckham all but ruled himself out of his planned debut for LA Galaxy on Saturday in a friendly against Chelsea. 

The England midfielder has been struggling to recover from an injury to his left ankle. 

At the moment it doesnt look good; there is still a lot of swelling but I am here for five years not just for Saturday, Beckham said on Thursday. 

Beckham twisted his ankle while playing for his country against Estonia in a Euro 2008 qualifying match last month.

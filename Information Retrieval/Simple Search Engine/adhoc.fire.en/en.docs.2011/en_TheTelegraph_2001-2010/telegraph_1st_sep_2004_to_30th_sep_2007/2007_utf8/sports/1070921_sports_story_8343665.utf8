The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Garfield does a Sir Gary

 - A Telegraph Special Yuvraj Singh dedicates sixes record to friend who is no more 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Yuvraj Singh 

Calcutta: After being ignored during the Test series in England, Yuvraj Singh came into his own in the ODIs there. However, its in the World Twenty20 match against England that Yuvraj exploded like never before six sixes in as many balls in a Stuart Broad over. 

That record-authoring feat also helped the 25-year-old vice-captain to another achievement the fastest fifty (a mere 12 balls) in Twenty20. 

 An over-the-moon Yuvraj spoke to The Telegraph 

 from the team hotel in Durban, some hours before Thursdays 

 face-off with South Africa. A problem with his left elbow, 

 though, kept him out of the XI. 

 The following are excerpts 

 On the morning-after 

 Feels nice Feels great, in fact Today, Ive 

 got two world records against my name I suppose even equalling 

 the sixes one will require something special 

 On whether the team celebrated 

 Because of the back-to-back matches, 

 we didnt. 

 On just when he began aiming 

 for a double hattrick 

 After the fourth six Then, when 

 I got the fifth, I decided to take a chance on the last 

 ball What Im really happy about is that four of the 

 hits were from the middle of the bat I used the crease 

 well Thanks to God and my Gurujis blessings, it was 

 my day. 

 On whether, after the match, 

 young Broad had something to tell him 

 (Laughs) He smiled and 

 I smiled back when we players shook hands Its terrible 

 to get hit in that manner I could appreciate what he must 

 have been going through. 

 On having been clouted for 

 five sixes by Dimitri Mascarenhas in the infamous last over 

 of the sixth ODI, at the Brit Oval, earlier this month 

 Its rightly held that sport 

 is a great leveller Id felt horrible then Its 

 difficult to explain Yet, yesterday (Wednesday) I was on 

 top of the world My experience then and at Kingsmead has 

 reinforced that nobody is bigger than the game That youve 

 got to show respect to the game. To the opposition too. 

 On his showdown with Andrew 

 Flintoff in the lead-up to his assault on Broad 

 Well, Flintoff said something 

 he shouldnt have I had to respond Such things happen 

 when youre competing passionately Id hit him 

 for two fours and, so, he couldve been upset. 

 On whether Flintoff and he 

 made up after the match 

 I think he said you began 

 hitting before I could say something (else) I told 

 him that no matter what had happened between us, for me, 

 he was the worlds No.1 allrounder Where Im 

 concerned, heated exchanges must not be carried off the 

 field. 

 On having warmed up extensively 

 before taking guard 

 I needed to as very few overs 

 (3.2 as it turned out) remained I had to get into action 

 straightaway and couldnt afford to feel stiff. 

 On whether he has decided on 

 dedicating his sixes record to somebody 

 (Emotionally) To my late 

 friend Aman Nat and his parents Aman, who was an elegant 

 right-hander, and I would practise together in Chandigarh 

 Whenever I play for India, his parents see Aman in me So, 

 this record is for them and him Aman isnt around, 

 but he remains very special I think of him when the going 

 is tough, think of him in special moments... You could say 

 I talk to him. 

 [Yuvraj declined to go into details of how Aman died. 

 It was in the early Nineties, is all that he 

 said.] 

 On father Yograj (who played 

 for India in 1980-81) being a big fan of Sir Garfield Sobers, 

 the first to hit six sixes in six balls in any form of official 

 cricket 

 Actually, when I was young, Dad 

 would call me Garfield For a long time I thought 

 hed nicknamed me after the cartoon character. Its 

 only later that he explained the Sir Gary connection and 

 added that his wish was I should bat like the legend 

 On whether he has interacted 

 with Sir Gary 

 No An opportunity did arise after 

 the 2003 World Cup final, when he was on the podium, but 

 I was in no mood to have a chat Our defeat had left me 

 crushed. 

 On whether he spoke to his 

 father after the match 

 It was very late then, we chatted 

 this morning. 

 On being appointed vice-captain 

 in ODIs as well 

 Ive had that responsibility 

 (in a stand-in capacity) in the past Additional responsibilities 

 dont burden me. 

 Finally, on Twenty20 captain 

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni getting the ODI captaincy too 

 Im happy for him Hes 

 young and will do a good job Im there to support 

 him, to make his job easier. Im sure everybody is 

 going to support him.

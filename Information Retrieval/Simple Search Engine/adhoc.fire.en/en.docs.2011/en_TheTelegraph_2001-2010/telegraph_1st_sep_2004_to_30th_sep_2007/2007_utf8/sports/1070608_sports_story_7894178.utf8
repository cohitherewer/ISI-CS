 Indian meet likely to be all-Asian affair

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The ONGC Cup is likely to be an all-Asian affair. 

According to the All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources, five Asian nations have expressed their willingness to participate in the high-profile tournament which will be the first international to be held in India in six years. 

The final confirmation, however, would come in July. 

Five countries Iran, Syria, Cambodia, Bangladesh and Myanmar have agreed to send their national teams for the six-nation tournament though the organisers are trying to rope an African and a Latin American team. 

ONGC has been pressing the AIFF to include teams like Sudan and Nigeria, an official said. They have also made a request to Brazil government to influence their national federation to take part in the ONGC Cup. 

The $1,00,000 prize money tournament will be played in Delhis Ambedkar Stadium from August 16-28. The Government of Delhi has promised to install floodlights at the stadium by the end of July. 

The last time India hosted an international tournament was the Millennium Cup in Kochi and Calcutta in 2001. India, coached by Islam Akhmedov, had lost all their matches. 

The national camp for the ONGC Cup will start in Gurgaon in the third week of June. Former international Pradeep Chowdhury has been appointed the manager.

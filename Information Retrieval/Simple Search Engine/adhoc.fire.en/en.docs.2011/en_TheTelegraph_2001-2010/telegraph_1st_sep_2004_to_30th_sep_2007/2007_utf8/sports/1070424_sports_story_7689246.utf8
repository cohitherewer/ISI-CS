Gros Islet: South Africa captain Graeme Smith was concerned over his slow recovery from a knee injury, ahead of Wednesdays World Cup semi-final against Australia. 

Smith batted in the nets on Monday and did light exercises under the supervision of team physiotherapist Shane Jabbar before applying an ice pack to the problem area. 

It hasnt healed as quickly as I was hoping, but Im still pretty confident of getting on to the field on Wednesday, he told a news conference on Wednesday. 

Smith suffered the injury on his left knee while taking a catch to dismiss Kevin Pietersen in the nine-wicket Super Eight win over England last Tuesday. 

I had a full bat today and a little bit of rehab, he added. 

Smiths full fitness would be vital for South Africa as they bid to reach the Cup final for the first time by overcoming holders Australia, who are the only unbeaten side left in the tournament. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Nationals in city after 6 years 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The national grasscourt championships are returning to Calcutta after six years. South Club will be hosting the meet from December 17 to 23. 

The most prestigious event of the domestic calendar had been held in Calcutta four years on the trot from 1998 twice each at the CC amp;FC and the South Club. 

There was a long lull thereafter, which would be broken in two months time. 

The countrys top players those who have established a firm footing on the international circuit rarely take part in the national championships. But it remains a significant event, simply because its a stepping stone for the second string who aspire to graduate to the next level. 

With New Delhi due to host back-to-back ATP Challenger tournaments from November 26 and December 3, players like Karan Rastogi could decide to make the trip to Calcutta a week after the completion of the two $50,000 meets in the capital. 

Rastogi, a Davis Cupper, is currently the India No. 3 (ranked 344 in the ATP list) behind Rohan Bopanna (261) and Prakash Amritraj (272). There is very little chance of Bopanna and Amritraj playing in Calcutta. 

There could be a strong incentive for the likes of Divij Sharan, Ashutosh Singh, Vijay Kannan and Sunil Sipaeya to play the nationals this time: 

The finalists may receive wild cards for the Chennai Open qualifiers. 

The $380,000 meet is among three which kick off the ATP season every year.

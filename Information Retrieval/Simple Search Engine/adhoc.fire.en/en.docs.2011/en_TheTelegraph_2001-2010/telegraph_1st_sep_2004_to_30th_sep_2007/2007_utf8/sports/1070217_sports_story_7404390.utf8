 Battle for psychological edge

 - Pathan included in XII, call to be made in morning 

 Rahul Dravid in Visakhapatnam on Friday 

Visakhapatnam: With the one-day cricket series tantalisingly poised at 1-1, Indias ability to perform in a crunch situation will be tested when they go into the series decider against Sri Lanka here on Saturday without the services of Sachin Tendulkar. 

Sachin, who had shown glimpses of his vintage form in this series, has been rested because of a stiff back to ensure that he is fully fit before the World Cup. 

A victory in the crucial game will no doubt serve as a morale booster for the Indians before they embark on the journey to the West Indies for the March-April World Cup. 

After the shocking five-run defeat in the second game in Rajkot, the hosts were far more convincing to record a comfortable five-wicket victory in the third match in Margao and level the four-match series. 

But despite the improved show, the prolonged form slump of Virender Sehwag has become a worrying factor . 

It was still not clear whether pacer Irfan Pathan, who sat out of the first three matches of the series because of a sore shoulder, had regained full fitness. The left-arm medium-pacer, though was included in the XII, final call will be made on Saturday morning. 

India and Sri Lanka are clubbed in the same group for the World Cup and both teams will be seeking to gain some psychological advantage by winning the match which is expected to attract a capacity crowd.

 Pak opt out of Asia Cup 

Karachi: Pakistan have opted out of the Asia Cup hockey tournament this year following a request from the team management that the players need more time to rectify their flaws. 

Our team will not be playing in the Asia Cup, PHF secretary Khalid Mehmood said in a Pakistan daily. 

We have taken the decision on the request of the team management, he added. 

However, Pakistan are keen to compete in a couple of tournaments in Russia and China slated for July and August, respectively. 

Pakistan coach Manzoor-ul-Hassan said he was not aware of any such development. As far as I know, a decision is yet to be taken. (PTI)

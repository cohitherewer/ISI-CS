 Gayle lashes out at board

DAILY TELEGRAPH

Chris Gayle, the West Indies one-day captain, launched a scathing attack on his own cricket board Thursday for the shambolic organisation which forced him to lead out a side at New Road which included five uncapped players drafted in from league and university cricket in England. 

The West Indies selected their squad for the forthcoming one-day series against England two weeks ago, but were unable to get three players Dwayne Smith, Lendl Simmons and Austin Richards into the country in time for this first of three warm-up matches. 

With six players injured, the West Indies had to trawl around to be able to fulfil the fixture. The debutants included Mali Richards, who plays for Oxford UCCE and with Stourbridge in the Worcestershire County League.

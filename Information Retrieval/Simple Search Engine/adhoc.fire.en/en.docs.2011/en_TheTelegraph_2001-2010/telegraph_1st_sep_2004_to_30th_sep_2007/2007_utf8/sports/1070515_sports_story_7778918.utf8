 Bangla laid low by viral

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chittagong: Three other Bangladesh players, besides Mohammed Ashraful, have been laid low by a bout of viral fever. The vice-captain is recuperating in a Dhaka hospital and is unlikely to be fit for the first Test starting Friday. 

Also joining the list of those unfit are: Farhad Reza, Abdur Razzak and Shahdat Hossain. They, however, continue to remain with the squad. 

Test players Mehrab Hossain, Tushar Imran and Rajin Saleh joined the squad Monday evening following an SOS from the team management. 

Imran may get a look in on Tuesday.

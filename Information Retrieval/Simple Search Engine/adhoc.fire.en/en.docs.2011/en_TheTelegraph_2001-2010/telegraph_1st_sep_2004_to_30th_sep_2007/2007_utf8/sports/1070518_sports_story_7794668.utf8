 Negi held by 

Grigoryan

Kirishi (Russia): Worlds youngest Grandmaster Parimarjan Negi was forced to sign peace with International Master Avetik Grigoryan of Armenia in the first round of world youth stars chess. 

The English Opening by Grigoryan did not leave many chances for Negi, the youngest participant here, as the Armenian traded queens earlier on and the game continued in level territory albeit with some complications. 

Negi had to find the right moves and forced exchanges led to a drawn rook and pawns ending. Peace was signed after 35 moves. (PTI)

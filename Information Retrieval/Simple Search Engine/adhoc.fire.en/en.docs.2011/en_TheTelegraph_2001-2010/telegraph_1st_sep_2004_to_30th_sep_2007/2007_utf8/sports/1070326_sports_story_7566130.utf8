 Buoyant Flintoff helps sink Kenya

A much better performance from England than their feebleness against New Zealand and Canada. In beating Kenya on Saturday by seven wickets, England improved to the verge of competence. 

Their victory ensured that England will go through to the Super Eight stage, and not become a major casualty at the first hurdle like Pakistan and, most probably, India. However, England have no points to take into the next stage New Zealand have both of them and a poor run-rate too, as New Zealand beat them with nine overs to spare in the only match of consequence in this respect. If teams finish the Super Eight equal on points, the higher net run-rate will decide who goes through to the semis. 

The key to Englands win was the penetration of their three main pace bowlers. Andrew Flintoff returned to the side after his one-match suspension for marine activities and helped to sink Kenya instead. With his Lancashire teammates James Anderson and Sajid Mahmood, Flintoff took five wickets for 101 runs, and never allowed a partnership to develop, so that Kenya never had wickets in hand for a major assault. 

It should be said that Kenya were never good enough to put England under pressure with bat or ball. Their batsmen were basically Minor County in standard, except for Ravinder Shah and Steve Tikolo, who would both be of first-class rank. Shah was soon undone by an Anderson outswinger which seamed back and kept low; leaving his captain to play a lone hand of 76 off 97 balls. 

In short bursts, Flintoff kept Kenya in check whenever Michael Vaughan needed a touch on the brake. The errant allrounder had trained really well during the week, said his captain. Another returnee to the side was Mahmood, in place of Liam Plunkett, and he supplied more variations than the Durham bowler. But the ball swung so lavishly in the opening stages that only the most incompetent bowler would have been taken apart. 

Vaughan was most agreeably surprised when Tikolo decided to bat first in a match reduced by overnight rain to 43 overs a side. Such was the humidity that Anderson swung the new ball as he used to do of old. Kenya may have decided to bat first because, when they bat second, their batsmen panic in their running between wickets. 

While Flintoff returned to being a key member of Englands crew, Tikolo had to enter a single-handed yacht race. In his fourth World Cup, and a semi-finalist in South Africa last time, Tikolo was not fazed and was only beaten by a reverse-swinging yorker from Flintoff when Kenyas innings was all but over. 

There was only one moment during Englands reply when they wobbled. When Kenyas left-arm spinner Hiren Varaiya came on, Kevin Pietersen edged his first ball, which turned, to the wicketkeepers right glove but did not stick. England would have been 76 for three if this chance had been held, with some scope for knicker-twisting against bowlers who take pace off the ball. But England, in the persons of Ed Joyce and Pietersen, reached 99 for two by the end of the 17 overs of power-play, reduced from the normal 20.

 Murray pulls out with injury

Wimbledon: Eighth-seeded Andy Murray pulled out of Wimbledon with a right wrist injury Sunday, dealing a blow to British fans who considered him their best chance for a strong showing from a local player. 

The doctor has advised me not to play and that I probably need about 10 days to be ready. Unfortunately, I dont think it is going to rain for the next 10 days, Murray said. I love playing Wimbledon because of the great support I get from the British public and that is what I will miss the most. 

He was replaced in the field by Kevin Kim of the US. Kim lost in the qualifying rounds for this years Wimbledon, which begins Monday. 

I have done everything possible to get ready for Wimbledon. I have played practice sets the last few days but still cannot hit a topspin forehand properly. It has been six weeks of really hard work but Im not 100 percent ready, Murray said. 

The wrist is a very important part of tennis and there are a number of players who have made the decision to come back too soon and ended up with long-term injuries and I do not want to take the risk and make the same mistake. (AP)

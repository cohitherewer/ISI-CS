 Ive never seen the ball swing so much: Dhoni

 - Indian having problems keeping to Zaheer, Sreesanth 

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni 

Leicester: Mahendra Singh Dhoni has been finding the wobbly dukes ball tough to negotiate from behind the stumps and has sought the advice of former players, including Indias legendary Farokh Engineer. 

I have never seen the ball swing so much. Its not just me, most of the players feel the same way. Even our bowlers have acknowledged that the Dukes ball has been swinging a lot, beyond their own expectations, Dhoni said. 

However, its not the swing but the wobble that has been testing wicketkeepers with their reflexes and athletic brilliance. 

Dhoni and the Indian team support staff have been consulting veteran wicketkeepers to help improve his glovework. 

I spoke to Farokh Engineer and some former players and theyve told me to concentrate hard on my job and not to worry too much, Dhoni said. 

Wicketkeepers do have problems when the conditions are too difficult. Even Matt Prior (England wicketkeeper) has had to keep diving around all day and he too hasnt looked great. 

Indias fielding coach Robin Singh said, Ive been talking to Alec Stewart (former England wicketkeeper) and others here. I even spoke to Andy Flower, who gave up the gloves in this sort of scenario. 

Dhoni further said, Its happening only with Zaheer (Khan) and Sreesanth because they swing the ball and make it wobble. However, theres been no problem when Im standing up to RP (Rudra Pratap Singh). 

Since the ball is wobbling so much, once it pitches, it moves pretty late and that too by a long way. 

You cant make any movement beforehand because if it takes the edge, it might come straight or to your right. 

At the same time, once it pitches on or around the off stump, the ball jags back late by a long way down the leg side.

 Jankovic puts it past Sharapova

Birmingham: Jelena Jankovic finally ended a losing run against Maria Sharapova to claim her first grasscourt title with a 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 win in the final of the rain-hit Birmingham Classic on Sunday. 

After both players had successfully steered past their semi-final opponents earlier in the day, Jankovic overcame a first-set hiccup to beat the top seed. 

It was the Serbian second seeds fourth title of the year and she underlined her reputation as an all-court player by adding the Birmingham triumph to her successes in Auckland (hardcourt), Charleston and Rome (both clay). 

Before Sunday, Jankovic had lost all three of her meetings against the Russian. 

Jankovic beat Italian eighth seed Mara Santangelo 6-1 7-5 in the semis, while Sharapova overwhelmed fifth seed Marion Bartoli 7-5 6-0. 

Bartoli, who completed her suspended quarter final match early on Sunday, beat third-seeded Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia 5-7, 6-4, 7-5. 

Sharapovas semi-final match was temporarily delayed when two spectators needed medical assistance in separate incidents. 

A woman fell unconscious after she and a child fell down a staircase, while in another part of the stadium, a man fainted. A helicopter landed on a court at the Edgbaston Priory Club to assist. The woman was flown to a nearby hospital. 

The helicopter seemed to distract Sharapova, who dropped her serve and trailed 4-5 in the first set before winning the next nine games. 

On Saturday, Sharapova began her quest to play catch-up at the rain-hit tournament by winning back-to-back matches to reach the semi-finals. 

After a battling 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 win over Austrian teenager Tamira Paszek, the top seed defeated fellow-Russian Elena Likhovtseva 6-2, 6-3 to book her place in the last four.

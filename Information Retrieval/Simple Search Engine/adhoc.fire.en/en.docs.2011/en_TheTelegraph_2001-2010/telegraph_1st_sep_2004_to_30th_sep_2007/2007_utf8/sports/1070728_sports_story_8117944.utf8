The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The heat is on England

 - Hosts made to bat when they would have loved to field 

 - Zaheer emerges day I hero 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Alastair Cook at Trent Bridge on Friday after his dismissal 

 Nottingham: Had conditions 

 been different, choosing to field wouldve been seen 

 as an ultra-defensive move. On Friday, though, few eyebrows 

 were raised when Rahul Dravid called tails and 

 inserted England in the second npower Test. 

 At stumps, with England on a fragile 169 for seven, 

 the Indian tails were up. It wouldve been worse for 

 the hosts had Sachin Tendulkar not grassed Chris Tremlett 

 in Zaheer Khans final spell. 

By the 36th over itself, as many as five wickets had fallen and Dravid stood vindicated with a capital V. 

The Trent Bridge surface had enough grass and juice to excite the new-ball bowlers and with spearhead Zaheer giving little away in his first spell (7-0-25-2), Michael Vaughans men were pegged back straightaway. 

Strangely, that one has to play late didnt seem to strike the England batsmen. 

If Zaheer had been the No.1 culprit on the first morning at Lords, he was very much the hero here. Indeed, having joined the 150-club, hes now the sixth most successful left-arm paceman. 

The seam was cleverly used and the ball swung in the air as well. 

Sourav Ganguly, always a good bet in England, produced a fine performance too. Actually, he got rid of dangerman (and highest scorer) Alastair Cook. The replay showed the ball wouldve gone over the stumps, but the gifted opener accepted that philosophically. 

Incidentally, there was little evidence that the former captain had been suffering stiffness in the back. 

The bowlers, however, have to be supported by smart fielding. Forget the one catch which was put down, generally, the Indians were lackadaisical in the field. 

Even if it was for brief periods, the pressure often eased. 

The Test got underway four hours behind schedule, after a matting wicket was rolled out in one corner to cover the rain-inflicted damage. 

 When conditions are such 

 and you tend to believe things can happen, then you put 

 the opposition in... After all, one way of looking at it 

 is why not attack the batsmen? I guess I wouldve done 

 the same thing, former England captain David Gower 

 told The Telegraph. 

Well be looking to get 200 and if our bowlers are able to reproduce the intensity and consistency of Lords, then its going to be a good contest, is what Cook said. 

He added: It wasnt easy to bat... Besides the swing and seam movement, the wicket was two-paced... We wouldve loved to bowl first... 

 Of course.

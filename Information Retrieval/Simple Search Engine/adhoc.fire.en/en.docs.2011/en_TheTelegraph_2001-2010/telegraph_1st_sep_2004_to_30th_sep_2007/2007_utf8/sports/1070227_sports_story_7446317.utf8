 5 GMs suffer Monday blues 

 - CALCUTTA OPEN 

BIPIN SHENOY 

Calcutta: It was a bad day in office for Grandmasters on Day II of the Calcutta Open at Gorky Sadan on Monday. As many as five Grandmasters suffered Monday blues as they were stunned by their lesser-known opponents. Six other GMs had to be content with a draw. 

The day, however, belonged to G.N. Gopal of Kerala, who upset third seed GM Levan Pantsulaia of Georgia in an English opening. I have beaten Grandmasters earlier but it was the best game of life, Gopal told The Telegraph after the game. 

National champion GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly blundered against IM Sriram Jha in an equal-ending, which arose from the Breyer variation of the Ruy Lopez. 

City-based IM Raktim Bandopadhyay scored a facile win against GM R.B. Ramesh, in a queens pawn opening where the former exploited his opponents weakened kingside and the long diagonal. 

In another upset, IM Rahul Shetty beat GM Saidali Iuldachev with white pieces while the Bangladeshi GM Ziaur Rahman suffered his second consecutive loss going down to low-rated Laisaram Imocha of Manipur. 

GM Dibyendu Barua was also held to a draw by Arghyadeep Das, who is a student of his academy.

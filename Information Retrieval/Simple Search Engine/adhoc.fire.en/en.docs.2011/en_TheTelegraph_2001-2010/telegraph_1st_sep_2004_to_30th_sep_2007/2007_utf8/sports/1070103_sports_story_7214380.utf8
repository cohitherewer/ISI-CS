 Dinda shines for Bengal

 Dinda 

Hyderabad: Half-Centuries by Arjun Yadav and DB Ravi Teja helped Hyderabad to a respectable 258 for six against Bengal on Day I of their Ranji Trophy match Tuesday. 

Yadav scored an unbeaten 79 after a 91-run stand for the first wicket between Teja (57) and TS Suman (44). 

Put in to bat, the hosts started off well with the openers handling Bengal new ball bowlers Sourav Sarkar and Ranadeb Bose well. 

Teja sailed smoothly to his half-century before being caught by Sourashish Lahiri to give Ashok Dinda his first wicket. 

Dinda, the most successful bowler for Bengal, struck quickly to send back Shashank Nag (1) to reduce the hosts to 105 for three. 

Skipper Anirudh Singh was joined by Arjun Yadav and the duo stabilised the innings before Dinda struck again rattling Singhs stumps with an incoming delivery. 

Yadav then put on a useful partnership with D Vinay Kumar as he crossed his half-century. 

Dinda claimed four wickets while Lahiri accounted for Suman.

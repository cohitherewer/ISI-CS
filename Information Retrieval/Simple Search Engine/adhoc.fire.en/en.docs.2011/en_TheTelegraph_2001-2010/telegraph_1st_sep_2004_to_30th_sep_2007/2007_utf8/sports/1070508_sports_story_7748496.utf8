 Beckham in trouble again 

Madrid: Observers will be closely watching the outcome of this weeks meeting of the Spanish football federations competitions committee after David Beckham was booked again. 

Beckham was shown a yellow card after tangling with Sevillas Uruguayan striker Ernesto Chevanton six minutes before the whistle. 

The booking, his 10th or the 11th of the season depending on how you view his previous misdemeanours, should lead to an automatic one match ban being handed down by the committee. 

However, the fact that Beckham was on the pitch at all on Sunday remains a matter of some controversy.

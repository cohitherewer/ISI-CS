 Hohenstein-Ernstthal : Dani Pedrosa kept alive his hopes of a first MotoGP world championship on Sunday with a comfortable win in the German Grand Prix.

 With the temperature soaring to 38 degrees Celsius at the twisting eastern German circuit, the Spaniard passed championship leader Casey Stoner of Australia on the first corner and powered his Honda to victory by more than 13 seconds.

 Gabor Talmacsi won the 125cc race, knocking Hector Faubel off top spot in the world championship standings. 

 Rio de Janeiro: Andy Potts won the United States sixth gold medal and secured his spot in the 2008 Beijing Olympics by winning the triathlon at the Pan American Games on Sunday.

 Potts swam 1.5km, rode his bike 40km and ran 10 km at Copacabana beach in 1 hour, 52 minutes, 31 seconds. Brent McMahon of Canada finished seven seconds behind with Juraci Moreira of Brazil taking bronze in 1:52:54. I had a fantastic finish, Potts said. I really wanted to win here so I could qualify for the Olympic Games. It was the main goal.

 East Hartford (US): Carli Lloyd scored on a diving header in the 66th minute to lift the US women to a 1-0 win over Norway in an international friendly on Saturday.

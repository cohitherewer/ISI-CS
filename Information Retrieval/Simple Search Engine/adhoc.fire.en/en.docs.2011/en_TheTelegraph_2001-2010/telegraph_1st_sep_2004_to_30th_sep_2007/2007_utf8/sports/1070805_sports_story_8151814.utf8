Akron (US): Jeev Milkha Singh faltered on the back nine to card a four-over 74 on Day II of the $8 million WGC-Bridgestone Invitational on Friday. The Indian, who is six-over 146 for the tournament, is tied 41st. 

Jeev began with nine pars in a row at the tough Firestone Country Club golf course, before a double bogey on the tenth. He got back a shot on the 11th, only to drop another on the 12th. At one-over, he had back-to-back bogeys on the 16th and the 17th. 

Leader Rory Sabbatini of South Africa streaked ahead of the field with a second straight 67 for a 134. Masters champion Zach Johnson surged into second place with a sparkling 65. 

Five-time champion Tiger Woods, looking for a third successive victory in one of his favourite tournaments, struggled with the pace of the greens on his way to a 70 and a tie for third at two under with fellow-Americans Scott Verplank (68) and Kenny Perry (69). 

Of the other big names in the elite field of 82, Phil Mickelson and Vijai Singh were locked at six over after returning 72s, one ahead of Ernie Els who struggled to a 77. 

South Koreas Choi Kyung-ju slipped to tied 26th after carding a three-over-par 73. 

Former Masters champion Mike Weir withdrew from the tournament during the second round because of a neck injury. The 37-year-old from Ontario was 12-over par for the tournament after 10 holes when he decided to pull out.

 Stop craze for foreign coaches

 Zaheer Abbas 

New Delhi: India and Pakistan should get over their obsession for foreign coaches, especially when they have enough eligible candidates at home, said former batting great Zaheer Abbas. 

I believe that both India and Pakistan should have coaches from their own land. What is the point in wasting so much money on foreign coaches? Abbas said on the sidelines of a book release here. 

Both the Indian and Pakistani cricket boards are looking for a new coach and both seem intent on having a foreigner for the job. 

The BCCI has formed a special committee to find Greg Chappells successor after the Australian quit his job following Indias World Cup debacle. The board, meanwhile, roped in Ravi Shastri as cricket manager for Indian teams next months Bangladesh tour. 

Pakistan too, after their coach Bob Woolmer was allegedly murdered in a Kingston hotel during the World Cup, is looking for a new coach. 

Sri Lanka too have a foreign coach in Australian Tom Moody, while Bangladesh, the other Test playing nation from the continent, have Dav Whatmore. 

Zaheer, however, is not impressed by the trend and felt it was high time the craze ended. 

There are ample talent available (at home), he said. 

The former Pakistan captain took the occasion to criticise Sachin Tendulkars detractors and said the batsman had enough fire in his belly to keep going for some more time. 

Describing Tendulkar as a genius, Zaheer said: You still dont have a replacement for Tendulkar. First find his replacement.

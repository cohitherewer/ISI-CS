 Ford is the man India need: Arthur

Bangalore: South Africa cricket team coach Micky Arthur on Tuesday gave a huge thumbs up for his predecessor Graham Ford who has emerged as prime contender for the Indian job, saying the latter was best suited to bring the team back on track after the World Cup debacle. 

Graham (Ford) is the man India would need at this moment. He is very hard working and gets the best out of the players. He will do a very good job if given the chance, Arthur said on the eve of the first Afro-Asia Cup one-day International here. 

Hes a fantastic man. If he does get selected he would do a fantastic job. India need a guy who can lead them and Graham will be there as the ideal backroom man, Arthur said in his praise of Ford. 

The 46-year-old Ford was named as one of two candidates to take over as coach of the Indian team from former Australia captain Greg Chappell by a seven-man panel which met here on Monday night. 

The panel short-listed one other undisclosed name during its 80-minute parley at a five star hotel here. (PTI)

 Hussey guides Aussies home

 - Tri-series 

 England fail to cash in on Lewis-Anderson blows

Brisbane: Michael Hussey scored 46 runs on Friday to guide Australia, after a shaky start, to a four-wicket win over England in a tri-series match. 

Electing to win, England managed only 155 but Jon Lewis, James Anderson, Andy Flintoff and newcomer Chris Tremlett defended that total superbly, resisting for 38.4 overs before yielding the winning runs. 

Australia stumbled to 48 for four in front of an early onslaught from Anderson and Lewis before Hussey, with support from Michael Clarke and Brett Lee, led Australia past Englands total and to a bonus point win. 

Hussey, who has become a specialist closer in limited overs games, put on 45 with Clarke (36) for the fifth wicket and 48 in an unbroken partnership with Lee (20 not out) for the seventh to clinch Australias third win in as many tri-series games. 

England have one win from three matches and New Zealand, who meet Australia in Sydney on Sunday, are winless after two games. 

Lewis took four for 36 from 10 overs and Anderson two for 29 from 10 as England made good use of the conditions and placed the Australians under heavy pressure from the outset. 

Anderson swung the ball prodigiously and was rewarded with wickets of Brad Hodge (0) and Cameron White (5). 

Lewis removed openers Adam Gilchrist (8) and Matthew Hayden (18), both to outfield catches by Anderson, then had Clarke and Andrew Symonds (4) caught behind by wicketkeeper Paul Nixon. 

Earlier, Lancashire opener Mal Loye marked his belated England debut with a a top-score of 36 in Englands 155. 

Loye was plucked from a summer sabbatical in New Zealand to take Michael Vaughans place after the latter was sidelined for at least two games with hamstring injury. 

He made the most of his international call-up at the age of 34, taking his 36 runs from as many balls in a 52-run partnership from 11.1 overs with Andrew Strauss: Englands best start in the series so far. 

Loye announced his intentions from the opening over when he went down on one knee and swept a 150 kmph (95 mph) delivery from Brett Lee over square leg for six. 

He managed five fours and a six in a quickfire innings which seemed to have set up England for a competitive total. 

The steam went out of Englands innings on Loyes dismissal, however. Strauss quickly followed his opening partner to the dressing room and its third, fourth and fifth wickets fell for one run.

 Svidler holds Anand

Morelia: Viswanathan Anand was held by Russian Peter Svidler, while top seed Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria suffered a shock defeat at the hands of Ukrainian Vassily Ivanchuk in the second round of Morelia-Linares chess tournament here. 

With his second consecutive draw in the category-20 tournament, Anand took his tally to one point from two games and slipped to joint third position. 

The victory over Toaplov helped Ivanchuk catch up with Magnus Carlsen of Norway in the lead on 1.5 points while Anand, Svidler, defending champion Levon Aronian of Armenia and Peter Leko of Hungary share the third spot with a point apiece. 

Topalov and Morozevich are currently in the cellar having just a half point each. 

Anand had scored a quick victory over Svidler in their last encounter during the Corus meet, but an encore wasnt possible as the Russian came much better prepared in the Ruy Lopez opening. 

Playing white, Anand got little once the game entered the middle phase and subsequent exchanges in fact gave Svidler an extra pawn in the endgame. 

Though there was little chance of losing, Anand had to time his final piece exchange and once he achieved that, the endgame with bishops of opposite colours offered no chances to Svidler. Peace was signed after 47 moves. 

The Sicilian Najdorf is a long-time favourite of Topalov but it didnt come good as Ivanchuk went for an apparently harmless set up. 

The plan worked extremely well as Topalov did not get even one chance to enter his favourite position while Ivanchuk improved his pieces considerably in the middle game. 

The Ukrainian won a pawn and slowly warded off blacks positional strength. Contrary to the first round, when he was down to seconds for his last 15 moves, Ivanchuk remained calm during the first time control and delivered the knockout blow on the 41st move. Topalov resigned immediately. (PTI)

 Jamaican police seek FBIs help

 Bob Woolmer 

London: Jamaican police have approached the FBI to find a third pathologist to shed light on the death of former Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer. 

Having failed to prove till date that Woolmer had been murdered, Jamaican police now believe that the autopsy report by an India-born pathologist misled them. They now think that the coach probably died of natural causes. 

The Sunday Times claimed that the role of pathologist Ere Sheshaiah is now being questioned. A review of his post-mortem report suggested that Sheshaiah was wrong in suggesting Woolmers death was a result of manual strangulation. 

The daily quoted an unidentified senior Jamaican police officer admitting that Woolmer probably died from a heart attack. 

I would go for natural causes, he said. 

Jamaican police are awaiting the result of a toxicology test to find out if Woolmer was poisoned with a herbicide. 

Sheshaiah based his report on two major findings Woolmers fractured bone in the neck and three bruises inside the neck, along with a large one at the base of the tongue. 

Noted British pathologist Dr Nat Carey dismissed Sheshaiahs strangulation theory, claiming that such fractures could be caused by a fall, resuscitation or poor autopsy technique. 

It is an important thing that just as one swallow doesnt make a summer, so a fractured hyoid doesnt make a strangulation. That is the very heart of the case, Carey said.

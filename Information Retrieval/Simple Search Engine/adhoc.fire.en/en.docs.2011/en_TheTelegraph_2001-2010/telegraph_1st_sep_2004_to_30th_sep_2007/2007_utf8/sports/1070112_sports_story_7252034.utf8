 Federer lords it over Safin

Melbourne: A day after gusting winds almost threw him off course, Roger Federer declared he enjoyed battling through the tough conditions as he booked his place in the Kooyong Classic final. 

The world No. 1 needed three tie-break sets to squeeze past wily Czech Radek Stepanek in his opening match but was back on cruise control on Thursday with a 6-3, 7-6 win over 2005 Australian Open champion Marat Safin. 

Its always a bit swirly winds out here at Kooyong, said the Swiss, who is aiming to add a third Melbourne Park Trophy to his collection following his wins in 2004 and 2006. 

I was warming up on Rod Laver (Arena in Melbourne Park) today, no wind, and then I come here and Marat said he only practised 15 minutes because he got fed up with the wind. 

But Ive really started to enjoy also playing with the challenge of the wind, because I used to hate it. 

Now I kind of like it sometimes because the rallies are different, its not always spin and everything, it makes a difference, its the right shot at the right time, and Ive really been able to do well. (Reuters)

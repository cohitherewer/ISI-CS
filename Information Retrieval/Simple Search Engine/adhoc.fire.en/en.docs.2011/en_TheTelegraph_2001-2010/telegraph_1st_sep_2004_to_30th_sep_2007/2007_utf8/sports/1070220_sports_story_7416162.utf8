 Wont be easy to beat top teams: Smith

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Having dethroned Australia from the No. 1 spot of the ICC ODI rankings, South Africans feel its a reward for the commitment and character they showed in the past 18 months. 

Skipper Graeme Smith, in a statement issued through the Cricket South Africa (CSA), said: We will not let this take away our focus from what we have to do at the World Cup. There are many outstanding teams competing, and we all know what a tough job it is going to be to beat them. 

Coach Mickey Arthur said: Being ahead of Australia has always been our ambition and this is balm to the soul. However, we are under no illusions that this is only one step in the journey that we are on and we will be able to make a full assessment of our progress after the World Cup and to sustain our position at the top. 

According to Gerald Majola, the CEO of CSA, the job is not done. South Africa will need all their confidence, talent and tactics to do well at the World Cup and finish on top of the ODI log in April to be crowned championship table winners. 

Graeme Smiths Proteas have worked exceptionally hard over the past 18 months at all aspects of the game and have emerged as the best ODI team on the world circuit over the past 12 months. The team has also been helped by former players such as Jonty Rhodes and Jimmy Cook and we are most fortunate to have their experience available to hone skills. 

South Africa have won 15 of their last 21 matches, including the then world-record 438 for nine for a 3-2 series win over Australia. 

They have also won seven of the last eight completed matches.

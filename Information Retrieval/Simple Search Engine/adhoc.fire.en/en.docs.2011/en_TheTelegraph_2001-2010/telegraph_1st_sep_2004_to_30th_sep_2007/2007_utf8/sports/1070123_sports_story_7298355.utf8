 Im quitting Bengal: Paul

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bengal medium-pacer Shib Shankar Paul, who is recovering from a knee injury, has decided to leave Bengal and join Railways for the upcoming National one-dayers. I will join the Railways camp in New Delhi on February 1 for the limited-overs competition, Paul told The Telegraph on Monday. 

Paul seems to have been hurt by the behaviour of CAB officials and selectors. I could have been kept even in the 15-member Ranji Trophy squad, but now I have no other option but to leave, an emotional Paul said adding that as a senior player, he didnt deserve this treatment. 

Paul, who rolled his arms for quite a few overs in the just-concluded Twenty20 meet in CC amp;FC, attended the practice session on the eve of the match. But the team management, along with the physio, are believed to have felt that he was not fit enough for the exertion of such an important five-day affair. 

Paul fears of losing the season and that has prompted him to take such a decision. If I stay here, I may lose the whole season, but my employers have again approached me to join the New Delhi camp and I cannot refuse, Paul said. 

Sanjib Sanyal and Ritam Kundu are two players who have joined Railways this season. Both Sanyal and Kundu represented Bengal in the last few seasons.

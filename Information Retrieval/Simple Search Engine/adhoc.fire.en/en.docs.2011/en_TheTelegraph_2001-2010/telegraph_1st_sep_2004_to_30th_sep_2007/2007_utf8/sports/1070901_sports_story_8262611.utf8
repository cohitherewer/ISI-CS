 Becks is down and out

 David Beckham will be sidelined for about six weeks 

The curtain has come down early on the first act of the David Beckham show. The English superstar, brought to Major League Soccer in July to inject new life into the league and soccer in the US, is done for the season. 

Beckham suffered a sprained right knee and will be sidelined for approximately six weeks, the Los Angeles Galaxy said on Thursday night. 

It means that Beckhams first MLS season is essentially over, after playing only 310 minutes in six games at a guaranteed salary of $6.5 million a year. 

His arrival in Los Angeles, with wife Victoria, triggered vast publicity. Beckhams first Galaxy game was attended by his friend Tom Cruise and televised nationally by ESPN, and he drew 66,237 fans this month to a Galaxy match in New Jersey. 

Soccer merchandise and tickets have been sold in record numbers, not only here but in every MLS city, based on Beckham playing. 

Beckham underwent an MRI scan to determine how much damage was done to his knee when he sprained his medial collateral ligament from a tackle during Wednesday nights loss to Pachuca of Mexico in a match at the Home Depot Center in Carson. 

Los Angeles play eight MLS games in September and four more in October, but it appears unlikely that Beckham will return to take part in what by then will be the meaningless last two or three Galaxy matches. He also will miss the Englands crucial two Euro 2008 qualifying games against Israel and Russia in London next month and possibly two more in October. 

Beckham reported to the Galaxy with a swollen left ankle he hurt in his final game with his former team Real Madrid, causing him to miss seven of his first 13 games with the Galaxy. 

Its just gone from one thing to another thing. Maybe its time for me to just say I need the rest and get it right and dont come back until its right, he said. 

Now that Beckham is sidelined, the ramifications extend far and wide. 

Planned exhibition matches with Beckham and the Galaxy have been scheduled in Canada and Australia. In Vancouver, 45,000 tickets have been sold for an October 3 exhibition and the opening page on the Vancouver Whitecaps website includes the message Beckham is coming and a countdown clock clicking off the days, hours, minutes and seconds until he arrives. 

In MLS, meanwhile, clubs maintain that there will be no refunds if Beckham cant play. 

Not only would it be rare, it would be unprecedented, said John Koluder, a spokesman for the MLS club Real Salt Lake. We have no plans to go that route. Unfortunately, there is nothing that fans who bought tickets for those games can do. 

The Galaxy play at Salt Lake City on September 19 and the game is close to being sold out.

 Dhoni to get extra security

Ranchi: Amid reports of threat to Mahendra Singh Dhoni, chief minister Madhu Koda on Sunday said the state government will provide security to the cricketer. 

Dhoni is Jharkhands and the nations pride. We have taken such reports (of naxal threat) seriously and will provide whatever security he requires, he said. 

The wicketkeeper called on the chief minister at his residence Sunday afternoon. 

During the meeting, Koda mooted a proposal for a charity match between film stars and cricketers. It was decided that the proceeds would go to the chief ministers relief fund.

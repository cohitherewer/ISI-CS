 Flintoff settles dispute

Manchester: Andrew Flintoff has said his friendship with Michael Vaughan remains as strong as ever, despite the England captains comments about the allrounders conduct at the World Cup. 

Flintoff labelled his skippers interview with a British newspaper this week a storm in a teacup. 

Vaughan was quoted as saying, you have to be honest: the Fredalo incident did affect the team. It did affect morale, referring to Flintoff being found on a pedalo, or paddleboat, at 4am in the morning after Englands opening group match defeat against New Zealand in St Lucia. 

Flintoff was one of six players disciplined for late night drinking during the tournament. 

England skipper Vaughan subsequently denied saying Fredalo only for the newspaper to publish an audio tape of him using the word. 

Allrounder flintoff, who was stripped of vice-captaincy following the incident, met Vaughan on Wednesday to clear the air. 

We sat down and spoke about a few things and, as far as were concerned, its finished, Flintoff told a TV channel in an interview at Old Trafford here Thursday. 

Weve got a great friendship and something like this, a bit of a storm in a teacup, is not going to affect that. 

Flintoff is currently out of the England side having undergone a third bout of surgery in as many years on his troublesome left ankle last week. (AFP)

 Harmison ruled out of Test series

London: England fast bowler Stephen Harmison was on Tuesday ruled out for the entire Test series against India as his hernia injury requires surgery which may keep him out of action for four to six weeks. 

Harmison, who was looking to postpone his operation to play against India, suffered a recurrence of the injury last week. After meeting specialists, it emerged that Harmison needs to have the surgery immediately. 

Coach Peter Moores said their priority while selecting the team would be to pick a bowling line-up with variety, even if it meant compromising with batting. 

We will look to put out a bowling attack that can take 20 wickets. If that means compromising a bit on the batting will have to be seen, Moores said. Chris (Tremlett) and Stuart (Broad) get bounce, they are tall bowlers and they have a different trajectory, Jimmy (Anderson) swings it, what we need is to have the variation to get wickets in different conditions. Monty is maturing all the time. Hes really excited about the challenge. 

Moores said they are yet to finalise the team for the first Test at Lords starting Thursday. We havent made that decision yet. We will look at the pitch and decide whats the best combination. 

Asked whether the side will miss Harmison, Moores said they have little choice but to work with whatever is available. He (Steve) will be operated upon for hernia. We have a good medical team, and we delayed this decision till the last possible moment, he said. 

You have to work with what you have got. The good thing is we have Ryan Sidebottom. He may not have a lot of Test experience, but hes got a lot of first class experience. 

Moores said that the three-match Test series will be a good contest as India have a lot of experience in their ranks. 

From the experience they have on paper, it looks like it will be a good contest. In every Test series, you go back to square one. You look to the first Test to set the tone and make a mark, he said. 

India by nature like the craft of the game. Dravids record does suggest that captaincy doesnt affect it. And Michael, the way he came back at Headingley in what was a pressure match for him shows he handles it pretty well as well. 

He said it would also be important for the players to stay fit and not get injured during the series. 

We have to keep working as hard as we can on all our bowlers. Its the same with Freddie when hes back hes got to be ready to play. Well be looking all the time to keep our people on the park, he said. 

On Chirs Broad, he said, he is coming off a 50 and a five-wicket haul, so that will help him. Whats pleasing about him is hes aggressive. (PTI)

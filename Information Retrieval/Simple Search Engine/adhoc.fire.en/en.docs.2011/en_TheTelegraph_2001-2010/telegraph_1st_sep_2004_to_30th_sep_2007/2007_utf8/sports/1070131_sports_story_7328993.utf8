The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tactical has advantage 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Trainer Harvinder Singh Baths ward, Tactical Advantage, will be the one to beat in the 1,400m Own Vision Cup, the main attraction in Wednesdays seven-event race card.

 The Greensmith-Cartier Million son is a winner of five races in his last seven starts. With C.Rajendra in the saddle, Tactical Advantage is expected to get a fair ride that may help the topweight notch up his third straight victory. 

 A challenge to the six-year-old may come via the lowly-placed Wizard Of Oz. Although the Daniel David-trainee is well in at the weights, his performance-graph has been very erratic.

 The Republic Cup may see trainer Javed Khans ideally handicapped Local Thriller coming good in the hands of apprentice Shane Domingo.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

 Sehwag set to be dropped 

 - South Africa may make three changes Im feeling fine, says Kallis 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 South Africa players celebrate their second Test win in Durban on Saturday 

Cape Town: South African vice-captain Jacques Kallis has recovered from the back injury which kept him out of the second Test and, so, he should play the third and final one at Newlands, from Tuesday. 

Im feeling fine, Kallis told The Telegraph on board the South African Airways flight from Durban on Sunday morning. Its not clear who will have to make way, though. 

The South Africans, in fact, may go to the extent of making three changes. In that case, left-arm spinner Paul Harris and speedster Dale Steyn are also going to come in. 

If the selection actually goes that way, then Hashim Amla, Andrew Hall and Morne Morkel will almost surely have to miss out. 

However, if Amla gets dropped, then the XI wont have four non-Whites thats the formula which is usually being followed. Amla apart, others in that category are Herschelle Gibbs, Makhaya Ntini and Ashwell Prince. 

Seems to be a tricky call. 

Meanwhile, its almost certain that the out-of-form Virender Sehwag is going to be dropped. His place will, then, go to Gautam Gambhir. 

Apparently, Vikram Rajvir Singh is also set to move out of the XI. In that case, depending on the wicket, either Munaf Patel or Harbhajan Singh is going to play in the series for the first time. 

Options are open, informed a well-placed source.

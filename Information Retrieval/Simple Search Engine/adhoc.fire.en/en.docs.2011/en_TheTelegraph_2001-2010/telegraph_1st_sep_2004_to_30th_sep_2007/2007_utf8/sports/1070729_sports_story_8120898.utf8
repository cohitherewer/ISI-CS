 Tri-nation trophy for India colts

Chennai: Saurabh Tiwaris superb 86 and mediumpacer Abu Nachim Ahmeds six-wicket haul helped the Indian under-19 team score a convincing 129-run victory over their Bangladesh counterparts in the final of the tri-nation tournament in Colombo on Saturday. 

Batting first, India managed 199 in 49.2 overs and then skittled out Bangladesh for meagre 70 in 30.5 overs. 

Coming in at 46 for three, Tiwari turned the tide in Indias favour, making an elegant 86 off 88 balls which contained five hits to the fence and five over boundaries. Tiwari was the last man to get out. 

Sreevats Goswami (24) and Virat Kohli (27) were the other notable contributors for India. 

Rubel Hussain (3/33), Golam Kibriah (3/43) and K.M. Shakil (2/49) were the successful ones for Bangladesh.

Calcutta/Banglaore: Chandu Borde, the newly appointed manager of Team India squads bound for Ireland, Scotland and England, will not join the four-day camp which got underway at the National Cricket Academy on Wednesday. 

No, he (Borde) will not be at the camp. It will be overseen by bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad and fielding coach Robin Singh, informed the BCCIs chief administrative officer Prof. Ratnakar Shetty from Mumbai. 

The two specialist coaches would be assisted by trainer Gregory King and physio John Gloster. 

The BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah, when contacted, revealed that Borde, also a former chief selector, will meet Rahul Dravid amp; Co. only on Tuesday next, hours before the squad leaves for Ireland, where India will take on the hosts in a ODI and face South Africa in another three-match series. 

He (Borde) will meet the players in his official capacity on June 19. Since he knows most of the boys, it wont be a problem for him to get into the act, Shah added. 

The ODI squad will leave for London on that night itself. 

However, the disruption of flights due to the strike by employees of the state-owned carrier Indian hit hard the opening day of the camp with six players being unable to attend it. 

Sourav Ganguly, Yuvraj Singh, Ramesh Powar, Rudra Pratap Singh, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (who has been named ODI vice-captain) and Piyush Chawla couldnt reach Bangalore and missed the Day I action. 

The players, who were present at the camp, were skipper Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Robin Uthappa, Dinesh Karthik, Rohit Sharma, Ajit Agarkar, Zaheer Khan, Gautam Gambhir and Sreesanth. 

Zaheer Khan didnt bowl at the nets and instead had a long chat with Gloster. 

The left-arm pacer, out with a groin injury midway through the Afro-Asia Cup, has been declared fit for the Ireland and England tours by Gloster. 

Overall the first day saw the campers doing fielding and catching practice. 

While the others were facing the junior bowlers and Sreesanth at the far end of the ground, Tendulkar had a stint at the nets with King and another local bowler bowling to him. 

He later gave batting tips to Karthik to whom he had also bowled leg breaks earlier in the session. 

Prior to the full-fledged camp for Team India for the tours of Ireland and Scotland the BCCI conducted a bowlers camp at Mysore from June 4-8 and a batsmens camp at the NCA from June 9, which concluded on Tuesday.

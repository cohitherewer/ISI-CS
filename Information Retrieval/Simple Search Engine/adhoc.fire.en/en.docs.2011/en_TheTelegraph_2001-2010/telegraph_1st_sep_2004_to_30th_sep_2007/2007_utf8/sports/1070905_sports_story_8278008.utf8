New York: Former world No. 1 Carlos Moya quelled a brave challenge from Latvian teenager Ernests Gulbis to win 7-5, 6-2, 6-7, 6-4 and reach the US Open quarter finals on Tuesday. 

The Spanish 17th seed was pushed hard by 19-year-old Gulbis but came through to set up a clash with third seed Novak Djokovic or Argentine 23rd seed Juan Monaco, 

The 31-year-old Moya was in charge early on but world No. 88 Gulbis, in his first US Open, hit back superbly to snatch the third-set on the tie-break. But Moya broke in the 10th game of the fourth set to clinch victory. 

Argentine Juan Ignacio Chela outlasted unseeded Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka 4-6, 6-2, 7-6, 1-6, 6-4 to reach his first US Open quarter final. 

World No. 49 Wawrinka led 2-0 in the deciding set but the more experienced Chela hit back to set up a meeting with second seed Rafael Nadal or another Spaniard, 15th seed David Ferrer. 

Roger Federer responded to a stellar start by Feliciano Lopez with an even better finish to advance to the quarter finals and a clash with old foe Andy Roddick on Monday. 

Three-time defending champion Federer earned a match-up with Roddick by defeating Lopez 3-6, 6-4, 6-1, 6-4 in a two-hour slugfest at the Arthur Ashe Stadium. 

The 60th-ranked Lopez had Federer on his heels early, winning the first set with five aces and 11 winners. His dazzling display continued until Federer scored a break in the 10th game to win the second set and Lopez never recovered. 

Fifth-seeded Roddick was leading 7-6 2-0 when ninth-seeded Czech Tomas Berdych retired with nausea and breathing problems in their fourth-round clash. 

Also advancing were fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko of Russia and 10th-seeded Tommy Haas of Germany. 

On the womens side, winners included fourth seed Svetlana Kuznetsova, sixth seed Russian Anna Chakvetadze and talented Israeli Shahar Peer. 

I was feeling great on the serve, my God, said Federer, who won 35 straight points on his serve in the final two sets. 

Federer committed just 12 errors during the 199 points played in the two-hour match. Lopez had 22 winners in the first two sets but only 12 thereafter. 

Kuznetsova needed only 74 minutes to dispose of awe-struck Victoria Azarenka of Belarus 6-2, 6-3. Chakvetadze had 23 errors during a second-set wobble but defeated Austrian teenager Tamira Paszek 6-1, 7-5, and now faces Peer for a place in the semi-finals. 

Haas scored a mild upset when he defeated number six American James Blake 4-6, 6-4, 3-6, 6-0, 7-6 winning the tiebreaker 7-4, while Davydenko continued his march through the draw with a 6-1, 6-3, 6-4 triumph over South Korean Lee Hyung-taik. 

In a doubles upset, top seeds Bob and Mike Bryan were beaten 5-7, 4-6 in the quarter finals by 10th seeds Simon Aspelin of Sweden and Julian Knowle of Austria.

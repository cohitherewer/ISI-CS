 - Fallout of poor supervision in Liverpool vs Chelsea match

Referees chief Keith Hackett has confirmed Rob Styles will not take charge of a match in the Premier League next weekend after his performance in the game between Liverpool and Chelsea at Anfield on Sunday. 

Styles controversially awarded Chelsea a penalty, which enabled Jose Mourinhos side to equalise after Fernando Torres opener. He then caused confusion by issuing a yellow card at Michael Essien who had already been booked only to insist later that it was John Terry being booked. 

Hackett, general manager of Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), said: Accountability exists and we, the PGMOL, do expect referees to get big decisions correct. On this occasion it was wrong and therefore Rob will not be officiating next weekend. 

Hackett added: I spoke to Rob this morning and obviously he is extremely disappointed with the decision and admitted he got it wrong. I have left a message with Rafael Benitez to apologise. Having looked at a video and seen a better angle and a better view, clearly he (Styles) now recognises that he got it wrong and hes deeply apologetic for that. I think, in fact, he too will be making contact with Liverpool in order to offer his apologies. 

Asked about the confusion when Essien appeared to be booked for a second time, Hackett said: Im informed by both the fourth official and Rob he retained the card shown to John Terry then held the card to indicate a direct free-kick, and failed to put the card away. So it was a basic, if you like, admin error as against an error in application of law. 

Well look at the video to ensure we dont get a repeat of that. 

Rafael Benitez, the Liverpool manager, was furious with Styles decision. I want to have a lot of respect for referees, but sometimes I cannot understand why they give some decisions, he said after the match. 

I think he will watch the video of the match and admit that his penalty decision was a mistake. 

Steven Gerrard, the Liverpool captain, went as far as suggesting that Styles had cracked and called for the referee to apologise for his penalty decision. I dont want to say too much because I will get into trouble, but the referee didnt play well, he said. 

Whether it was because the Chelsea players were talking I dont know, but in the end hes cracked and made a bad decision. It wasnt a penalty and I hope he comes out and says sorry now. 

Hackett also revealed assistant referee Ian Gosling will be given next weekend off, after he denied Fulham a late goal at home to Middlesbrough when David Healy clearly forced the ball over the line. 

Clearly the assistant referee has made an error, so he wont be operating next week for us either.

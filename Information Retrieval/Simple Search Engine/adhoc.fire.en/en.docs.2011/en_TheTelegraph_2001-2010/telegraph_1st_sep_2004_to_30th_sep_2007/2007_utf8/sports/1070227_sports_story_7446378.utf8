 East Zone clinch a thriller

 - Deodhar Trophy 

 Rohan Gavaskar remained unbeaten on 79 

Ahmedabad: A measured and watchful innings by Rohan Gavaskar guided East Zone to a one-wicket last ball victory against South Zone in the Deodhar Trophy limited overs match at the Sardar Patel Stadium here on Monday. 

Gavaskar who struck an unbeatean 79 runs took two runs off the last ball of the final over by K. Shahabuddin to steer his team to victory. 

The southpaw, who hit seven fours, stitched a crucial 77-run partnership for the fifth wicket with captain Deep Dasgupta (39). 

Earlier in the innings, an explosive 56 by opener Parvez Aziz set the tone for East Zone who were chasing a competitive target of 271. Parvez hit 11 fours and a six. 

His first 30 runs were all in boundaries and he was finally dismissed by R. Vinaykumar in the 11th over. 

Though South Zone bowlers D. Kalyankrishna, Sahabuddin and Pragyan Ojha picked up two wickets each, they could not prevent Gavaskar and East Zone tail enders from scoring the crucial runs in the final overs. 

Gavaskars last minute trick with the bat overshadowed an elegant 107 made by South Zone opener Swapnil Asnodkar. In a run-a-ball innings Swapnil struck 14 fours.

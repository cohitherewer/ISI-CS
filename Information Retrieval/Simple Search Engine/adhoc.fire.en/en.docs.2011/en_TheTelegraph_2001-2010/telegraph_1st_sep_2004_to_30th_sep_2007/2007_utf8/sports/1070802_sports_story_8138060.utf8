The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Another Sanath hogs limelight

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: He once dreamt of being a successful cricketer but turned out to be the best libero for his countrys national volleyball team. 

M.L. Abeyrathna, popularly known as Sanath in the Sri Lankan volleyball team resembles the swashbuckling left-hand opener Sanath Jayasuriya in many aspects. 

Hailing from Wadduwa, few hundred kilometres away from Jayasuriyas hometown Matara, Abeyrathna is a sergeant in the army. 

He started his career as a cricketer during his childhood days, but was forced to shift to volleyball since his senior school didnt have a cricket team to pursue his dream. 

Cricket is still my passion But god must have thought otherwise and made me a volleyball player, the 30-year old Abeyrathna said in Tamil as his captain N.S. Abeysinghe assisted acted as an interpreter. 

His cricketing desire, however, still burns. A left-handed batsman, he is a regular opener for his army cricket team and is also a very effective left-arm spinner. 

I met him (Jayasuriya) once at an army function. I had some pictures clicked with him and also took his autograph, said Abeyrathna, who got married in May. 

Whenever I open an innings, I like to hit the ball hard out of the ground every time, much like Jayasuriya said the diminutive Abeyrathna, who claimed to have hit a couple of big scores for the army team. 

According to the Lanka volleyball coach W.S. De Silva, Abeyrathna is key to his team.

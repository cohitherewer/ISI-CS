 Younis wont lead Pak again: Ashraf

Karachi: Younis Khan will not be offered captaincy ever again in the future, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Dr Nasim Ashraf said. 

Dr Ashraf said though Younis would be considered as a player, he wont be offered to lead the Pakistan team ever. 

As far as his playing for Pakistan is concerned he will be considered whenever he makes himself available to play for the national team. But I dont think he will ever be offered the captaincy again, he said. 

Younis had refused the captaincy after the World Cup when Inzamam-ul Haq stepped down as skipper. 

Ashraf had earlier convinced him to lead the side after he initially refused to do so just before the Champions Trophy last year. 

To be honest, I was disappointed when Younis said he didnt want the captaincy, Ashraf said. 

There is no question of taking any disciplinary action against Younis for refusing to lead the team because as a individual he has a right to his own opinion. But after what happened he will not get the captaincy again, he said. 

Meanwhile, former captain Inzamams fate will be decided by July 1, the deadline for the national selection committee to submit a shortlist of 30 players, 20 of whom will get the new central contracts. (PTI)

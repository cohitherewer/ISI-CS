 Focus on Bhaichung, Nayeem today

 Bhaichung Bhutia 

New Delhi: Football remains a team game, but individuals do play a part. 

As India prepare to take on Bangladesh in the Nehru Cup at the floodlit Ambedkar Stadium here on Monday, the focus will be on two individuals on either side. In boxing parlance the red corner is taken up by India captain Bhaichung Bhutia while in the blue corner is Bangladesh coach Syed Nayeemuddin. 

The fractured relationship between Syed Nayeemuddin and Bhaichung is stuff of legend in Indian football and there is no denying the two will use every trick in the book to outsmart the other, if not prove a point. 

Nayeemuddin, whose team has lost the first match against Syria, has made it clear that Bhaichung will receive special attention in Mondays match. 

He is certainly a special player and we will pay special attention to him, he said. 

Asked whether he would like to put a marker on Indias most valuable player, the former India coach smiled, merely responding that is still a top secret. 

Such a move will put pressure on Bhaichung, who didnt exactly enjoy a memorable outing against Cambodia despite a 6-0 win. The skipper, however, sounded unperturbed and said he was looking forward to yet another victory. 

We are having a great run at the moment (since the Portugal tour), Bhaichung said. I am sure we will continue to play in the same manner. As far as my form is concerned, all that I can say is I am among goals and would strive hard to repeat it against Bangladesh. 

The absence of injured midfielder N. P. Pradeep could be the only problem the Indian camp is facing at the moment. Though Steven Dias won the Man-of-the-Match award against Cambodia, it was Pradeep who made all the difference during his 44-minute stay on the pitch.Pradeep has been ruled out for Mondays match; Mehrajuddin is likely to take his place. The rest of the line-up could remain the same.

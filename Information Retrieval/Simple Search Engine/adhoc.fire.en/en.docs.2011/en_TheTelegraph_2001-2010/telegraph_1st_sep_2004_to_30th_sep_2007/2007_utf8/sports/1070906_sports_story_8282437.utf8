 Nisha, Tania win in Asian chess

Tehran: National womens champion and GM norm holder Tania Sachdev scored an emphatic victory over Hoang Thi Bao Tram of Vietnam to maintain a clean slate after the second round of Asian Womens Chess meet here. 

Playing black, Tania had to work hard for the victory against Tram. In the first round, the top rated Indian in the fray had accounted for Zhang Xiaowen of China. 

Women Grandmaster Nisha Mohota, also playing black, beat Shadi Paridar of Iran. 

Tania said her efforts were better than in the first round as she won an extremely complicated game. I think I got out of the opening quite well against Bao Tram and was able to consistently improve my position, Tania said. 

Tania will take on Le Thanh Tu while Nisha has a tougher customer in Huang Qian. 

At the top of table, second seed Huang Qian of China accounted for former national champion Swati Ghate to remain among the leaders. The other Indian to lose in this round was Amrutha Mokal, who could do little against a well-prepared top seed Lufei Ruan of China. (PTI)

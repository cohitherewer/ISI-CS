 Big W on course for Sunday finish

Wimbledon: Wimbledon is scheduled to finish on Sunday despite the rain at the All England Club. 

Organisers have been criticised by several players for not scheduling matches on the traditional middle Sunday rest day, but tournament referee Andrew Jarrett said on Thursday that forecasts of improved conditions suggests the tournament will end on time. 

A total of 177 matches were behind schedule when play started on Wednesday, but drier conditions allowed for 102 to be completed by the end of the day. 

All we can do ever is to try to make the most of the cards were dealt weather-wise, Jarrett said. It was a very good day for us and it even included a rain break. 

We can still finish on Sunday, and while that is still a possibility, that is what well plan for and what were aiming for. 

However, the delays mean some players face a gruelling schedule. (AP)

 Gayle to lead in ODIs 

Bridgetown: Chris Gayle will captain the West Indies in three one-day Internationals and two Twenty20 matches against England. 

The 27-year-old allrounder takes over from Daren Ganga, who has deputised for the injured Ramnaresh Sarwan in the current Test series. 

Gayle, who has played 168 one-dayers, was originally nominated as captain by the selectors but was not approved by the West Indies Cricket Board. 

The board then met again and decided to approve Gayle as captain after the selectors threatened to resign. 

Shivnarine Chanderpaul, the most senior player with 217 one-day appearances, will be vice-captain. 

Sarwan was forced out of the tour with a shoulder injury sustained in the second Test at Headingley. 

Ganga was not named in the one-day squad, his place going to Austin Richards jr, a left-handed batsman from Antigua. 

THE SQUAD 

Chris Gayle (captain), Shivnarine Chanderpaul (vice-captain), Dwayne Bravo, Fidel Edwards, Runako Morton, Daren Powell, Denesh Ramdin, Ravi Rampaul, Austin Richards jr, Darren Sammy, Marlon Samuels, Lendl Simmons, Devon Smith, Dwayne Smith.

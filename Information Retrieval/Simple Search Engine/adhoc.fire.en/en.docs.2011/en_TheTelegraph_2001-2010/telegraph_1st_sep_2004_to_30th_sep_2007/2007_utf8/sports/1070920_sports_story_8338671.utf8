The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Fun with pasta, games, magic

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Sunfeast Open has been spiced up with several off-court activities the buggy ride, the fashion show, the exhibition doubles match which included Sachin Tendulkar and Bhaichung Bhutia. 

Wednesday saw another such event cooking pasta with the players. 

Daniela Hantuchova, Sofia Arvidsson, Sunitha Rao, Cornett Jones, Ekaterina Ivanova, Hana Sromova, Yaroslava Shedova, Mariya Koriyttseva and Yulia Efremova apron in place and ladle in hand showed they were as good in the kitchen as they were cooking up big serves on the court. 

This being Hantuchovas first appearance before the media after her arrival early on Wednesday, a mad scramble prevented her from pursuing her culinary activites for long. 

For Sunitha it was a very exciting experience. Thus far, she said, she had merely tried out pies, cakes and cookies. A point proved by the fact that her napkin caught fire as she held the cooking dish in place. Of course, she firmly put it out with a few blows with the ladle. 

Yes, I have tried cooking before, said Arvidsson, for whom this is the second Sunfeast Open. I was here in 2005 and I like it here. I even tried some Indian cuisine, she added, even as a magician thrilled Sromova, Ivanova and Shvedova. 

The girls even tried out an innovative hybrid of golf and tennis, called tolf. 

It was an enjoyable afternoon with pasta, games and magic.

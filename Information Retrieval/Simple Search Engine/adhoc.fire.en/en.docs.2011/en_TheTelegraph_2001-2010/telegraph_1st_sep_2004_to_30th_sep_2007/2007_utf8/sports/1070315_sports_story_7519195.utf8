 Now, Ponting praises Sachin

 Port of Spain: After ridiculing Indias 

 performance in recent years, Ricky Ponting has now turned 

 to glorify the living legend called Sachin Tendulkar. The 

 Australian captain has rated the Indian above Brian Lara 

 as the best batsman among his contemporaries. 

Comparing the two batting greats, Ponting said Lara could be more destructive on his day but Tendulkar scores above the West Indies skipper in technique and is the most complete batsman he has seen. 

West Indian Lara and Indian Tendulkar are the two best batsmen I have played against. I have rated Sachin slightly ahead because technically I thought he was a bit tighter, but Lara on his day is probably more damaging, Ponting wrote in his column for an Australian paper. 

Tendulkar had the best technique and performed well in all conditions, according to the Australian. 

He is the most complete batsman I have seen. His technique is so good and he has played well in all conditions. To have 41 ODI centuries shows what an appetite he has for runs. 

As for Lara, Ponting wrote: Everyone can see his class, but he is also tough. When the West Indies have been down and out, he has stood up. And he has had to do it all himself a lot of the time. 

While Lara mixes with the Australians after matches, Ponting said he had rarely spoken to Tendulkar outside the cricket arena. 

The Indians tend to keep to themselves and dont hang around very long after play. It is amazing how he has to live his life because of his popularity at home. We have heard stories of him having to do his grocery shopping at 3 am. 

Ponting said that Tendulkar, Lara, Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq, Sri Lankas Sanath Jayasuriya and South African allrounder Shaun Pollock had dominated the game for more than a decade and are playing in their last World Cup. 

Perhaps this tournament should be re-badged the Farewell Cup, he wrote in the newspaper. 

Inzamam, despite impressive career figures, had rarely performed against Australia, he said. 

Inzamam has a great record, averaging 50 in Tests and almost 40 in one-dayers, but he has never done anything against us. I am not sure what that says about him, because he is actually a pretty good player of fast bowling, commented Ponting. 

Pollock will be remembered as one of the great allrounders, the Australian said. Hes not that quick and he has probably dropped a bit more pace in the past 12 months, but he has the smarts. He puts the ball in the right area and does just enough with it. 

Jayasuriya was instrumental in helping Sri Lanka beat Australia for the title in 1996, when Ponting made his World Cup debut. 

Jayasuriya has won Sri Lanka plenty of games with his dynamic batting, while his bowling has also been important in his teams plans. He has been hard to plan for because he hits the ball in odd areas, Ponting said. (PTI)

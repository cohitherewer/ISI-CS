 Russia in semis

London: Marat Safin once again proved Russias Davis Cup man of the hour, putting the defending champions into the semi-finals with a victory in the deciding rubber against France on Sunday. 

The former world number ones 7-6, 6-3, 6-2 win over Paul-Henri Mathieu gave Russia a 3-2 verdict and a place in Septembers semi-finals against Germany. 

Safin had performed a similarly vital role in four previous deciding rubbers in the Cup, including last years final against Argentina. 

The other semi-final will pit Sweden against the United States, who like Germany, secured semi-final places after Saturdays doubles. 

Jonas Bjorkman, 35, took former champions Sweden through when he and Thomas Johansson, 32, scored a 4-6, 7-6, 6-2, 6-3 victory over Argentines David Nalbandian and Guillermo Canas. 

Germany took an unassailable lead over Belgium after Michael Kohlmann and Alexander Waske beat brothers Olivier and Christophe Rochus 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, 6-1.

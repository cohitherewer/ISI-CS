The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 133 n.o. by Badrinath 

Mombasa: Propelled by big hundreds from S. Badrinath and Parthiv Patel and then a four-wicket haul by Piyush Chawla, India A poised themselves for a big win against Kenya in the three-day tour match here on Monday. 

At the end of Day II, Kenya were tottering at 191 for eight in their second innings still 118 runs short of Indias first innings total. 

Parthiv and Badrinath, the overnight batsmen, began the day in the same aggressive vein as the evening before. Resuming on 100, Parthiv moved to 124 before falling to Hiren Varaiya. 

However, Badrinath appeared rock solid as he found an able ally in Irfan Pathan (32 from 50 balls). With Irfan, he added 65 for the sixth wicket. 

India A declared for 406 for eight with Badrinath unbeaten on 133.

 Cup debacle is past: Shastri

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Dhaka: Ravi Shastri on Sunday ruled out any possibility of continuing his honeymoon with Rahul Dravid amp; Co., insisting they had left behind the World Cup blues. 

Describing his brief association with Team India as a challenge to reform the dressing room atmosphere, the outgoing cricket manager refused to dwell on the Greg Chappell era and brushed aside talk of rift among the players as nonsense. 

Chappell is past and the team has left behind the World Cup debacle. Lets focus on the present and to me, it looks very promising, he said after Indias win against Bangladesh in the final Test here. 

What kind of coach does the team need now like Chappell or like Shastri? 

Shastri ducked the query: I am on the committee to select the new coach. Since I am a professional and believe in work ethics, I will hold my cards for the moment. 

Dav Whatmore, whose innings with Bangladesh also ended on Sunday, reiterated his keenness to coach India. 

You all know there may be another challenge for me not far away. That is of course subject to the employers (read BCCIs) decision, the Australian said. 

If they make a decision (about me), thats fair. If not, thats also fine, he added. 

The seven-member committee will sit in Bangalore on June 4 to discuss the issue. 

Shastri insisted he was committed to returning to television duty. 

I like honeymoons anyway... the more the merrier. I took the job because India had a tough time after the World Cup. But right from the beginning, I made my stand clear to the establishment that I had a contract with my employers and would leave this one after the Bangladesh series, he said. 

What changes did he bring to the side, post-Chappell? Shastri said, as he had mentioned before, that the fun factor had been missing in the dressing room. 

I didnt go to the World Cup, but I had read a lot about so many negative things about the players. 

But what I saw was that they were a brilliant bunch and camaraderie among them was fantastic. 

I wanted them to enjoy the game. When you see these guys playing the way like now and enjoying the dressing room, I see a positive in all this, he said. 

I also know now that this talk of rift among the players is absolute nonsense. I dont know what will happen two months down the line, but right now its rubbish. 

Whatmore played down the heavy defeat in his farewell match as another game in the process of the sides development as a Test nation. 

There were some encouraging performances over the years. On our day, we could push even Australia. Reaching the World Cup Super Eight stage was a pleasing moment. 

But Bangladesh have a long way to go, no question about that. 

The team needs to do more to be competitive in the longer version. We certainly need to play more Tests, Whatmore signed off.

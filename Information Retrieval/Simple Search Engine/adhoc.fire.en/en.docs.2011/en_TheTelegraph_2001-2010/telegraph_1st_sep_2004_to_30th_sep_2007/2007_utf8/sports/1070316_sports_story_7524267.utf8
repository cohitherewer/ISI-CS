 Brays 115 n.o. in 

 Irelands 221/9

 Bray 

Kingston: Australian-born opening batsman Jeremy Bray struck an unbeaten 115 as Ireland racked up a total of 221 for nine against Zimbabwe in their World Cup group D match on Thursday. 

Brays controlled strokeplay was the anchor to the entire Irish innings at Sabina Park and gives Trent Johnstons side a fighting chance of victory in their first World Cup match. Irelands debut got off to a shaky start with William Porterfield out with the sixth ball of the day Vusi Sibanda snapping up the ball at second slip after keeper Brendan Taylor had fumbled an edge on Christopher Mpofus delivery. 

But Bray and Eoin Morgan took on the Zimbabwe attack rattling up 42 from eight overs. The Irish began to lose their way though when medium pacer Gary Brent was introduced. With his fifth ball, he claimed the wicket of Dubliner Morgan caught by Elton Chigumbura at slip for 21.

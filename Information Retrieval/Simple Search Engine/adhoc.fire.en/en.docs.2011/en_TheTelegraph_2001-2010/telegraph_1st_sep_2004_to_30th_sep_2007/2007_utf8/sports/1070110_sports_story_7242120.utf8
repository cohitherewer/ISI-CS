Centurion: Convenor of selectors Haroon Lorgat said South Africa were confident of reaching racial targets after naming 14 coloured players on Tuesday in their provisional 30-man squad for the World Cup. 

Cricket South Africa (CSA) has imposed a target of seven coloured players in the final 15-man squad which needs to be announced by February 13.

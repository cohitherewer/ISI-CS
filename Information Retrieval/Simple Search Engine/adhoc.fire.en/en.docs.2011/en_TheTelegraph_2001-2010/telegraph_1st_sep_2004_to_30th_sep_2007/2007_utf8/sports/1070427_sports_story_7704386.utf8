 Cole strike puts heat on Liverpool

Advantage Chelsea. Joe Cole struck an important goal, Liverpool scarcely threatened an away goal, and now Jose Mourinhos side visit Anfield on Tuesday convinced they are 90 minutes from the Champions League final in Athens (briefly reported in Thursdays Late City edition). 

Steven Gerrard and the Kop will have different ideas, but Liverpool must somehow find a way to break down Chelseas imperious defence. Craig Bellamy and Dirk Kuyt disappointed, while Liverpool looked livelier in attack only when they went more direct with Peter Crouchs second-half introduction. 

Gerrard must also start in the centre at home, as the pairing of Javier Mascherano and Xabi Alonso was too slow and defensive to alarm the Premiership champions at the Bridge. With Bolo Zenden too lightweight on the left, Liverpool had only Gerrard giving any drive from midfield, and he was hamstrung by being stationed on the right. 

Joe Cole also began out wide, but he was able to roam with far greater effect than Liverpools captain because Chelsea largely controlled midfield. Having timed his return from injury perfectly to help Chelsea in their momentous pursuit of the quadruple, Joe Cole certainly timed his run perfectly into the box on Wednesday night, meeting Didier Drogbas expert cross from eight yards to give them a narrow edge. 

Liverpool, with Gerrard restored to his best rampaging role, may well score against Petr Cech next Tuesday, but the danger for Rafa Benitezs side is that Chelsea are quite capable of striking again. A goal threat exudes from all quarters of the blue ranks, particularly with Joe Cole lending that extra trickery and subtlety. Drogba and Frank Lampard would both have found the net last night but for the brilliance of Pepe Reina. 

Chelsea also screamed for a penalty when the ball made contact with Alvaro Arbeloas hand, rather ignoring the reality that the offence occurred outside the box. The excellent referee, Markus Merk, waved play on, much to the anger of the Chelsea dugout. Another one for the file marked conspiracy on Mourinhos desk. 

How Liverpool lack a centre forward in the menacing mould of Drogba, and they need to find a greater cutting edge for the Anfield leg next Tuesday. Chelsea had been fast out of the traps, mocking the perception of them as tired, racing at Liverpools defence, playing to and off the terrific Drogba. 

Drogba was causing Liverpools defence all manner of nightmarish problems, both through his muscular physical presence, by backing into Daniel Agger and winning free-kicks, and also through his ceaseless running. 

Drogba may hobble around at times, and stay down too long, a tactic Merk wonderfully ignored, but he remains a magnificent centre forward when upright. 

From the opening stages, Drogba had troubled Liverpools defence, and, at times, it appeared only Jamie Carragher stood between the visitors and oblivion. After eight minutes, Drogba knocked the ball down to Lampard, whose shot was parried away by Reina. 

The message was clear: Chelsea were in the mood, superbly primed tactically by Mourinho and with their determination expertly stoked by their charismatic coach. Seizing on to John Arne Riises shocking back-pass, Drogba misjudged his ball to the unmarked Joe Cole, and Reina nipped out to intercept. 

When Agger then fouled Drogba, Lampard unleashed a low free-kick that nicked Riise as it flashed just wide of Reinas right-hand upright. The blue tide was flooding all over Liverpool and eventually the dam broke just before the half-hour. 

Ricardo Carvalho, who passed a fitness test before kick-off, certainly showed little sign of a tight hamstring as he glided out of defence, elegantly progressing into midfield in a manner that the watching Franz Beckenbauer must have admired. The Kaiser of the Kings Road then sent Drogba racing down the inside-right channel, and the seeds for Liverpools demise were sown.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IN THE CITY

 Star Ananda, the leading Bengal news channel, has embarked on a partnership with Indian Football Association (IFA) to promote the game in the state. 

 It kicks off with live coverage of the five Super Soccer series matches against Sao Paulo of Brazil. According to the deal, the channel will also cover all other IFA-organised tournaments, except CFL Premier Division and IFA Shield. 

 Football in the state has suffered from lack of visibility for long. I sincerely believe Star Anandas initiatives will help the game improve and make it more popular to everybody, IFA secretary Subrata Dutta told a press conference on Thursday. 

 The officials from the channel, however, claimed that their coverage of the Super Soccer series which starts with East Bengal-Sao Paulo match in Siliguri on Saturday will be on a par with the leading sports channels. 

 Subhas Bhowmicks wish for buying a good foreign striker may soon become a reality. Mohammedan Sporting, on Thursday, struck a sponsorship deal with Reliance for a year, which will certainly act as a huge morale-booster for the beleaguered club. 

 Bengal Cricket Masters will organise the National Veterans Cricket Tournament (East Zone) to be held in the city from January 29-31. In the second edition of the meet, teams from Jharkhand, Bihar, Orissa, Assam and Manipur are expected to take part. 

 The organisers informed that the matches will be held at the Jadavpur Universitys campus ground in Salt Lake while the final is slated for the Eden on January 31.

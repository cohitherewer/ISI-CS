 Warne keen to set up academy in England

 - Leg-spinner doesnt rule out remarrying Simone 

 Warne

Melbourne: Englands future spinners can learn about Shane Warnes bag of tricks that baffled their batsmen for more than a decade as the master leg-spinner wants to set up a cricket academy in the country. 

Responding positively to Duncan Fletchers call for helping English cricket, Warne has expressed his desire to set up a academy in England. 

It was interesting to read Fletcher say in our papers that he thinks I can offer assistance to England. That was very kind of him, especially after he said a few weeks ago that his batsmen were on top of my bowling.., Warne wrote in his column in an English daily. 

Actually, one idea I have is for a Shane Warne Cricket Academy for kids in England. I dont know how it may work or how feasible it would be. Whatever I do, I want to do it properly, Warne said. 

Beyond that, I also want to make sure that cricket stays healthy worldwide. So I would not have any problem with helping in England, New Zealand, South Africa or anywhere else. We live on a small planet these days, he wrote. 

Australian cricket is my priority. I want the team to stay No.1 in the world and to help the sport to remain No.1 in the country, he said. 

Meanwhile, Warne, known as much for his abilities on the field as for his romps outside it, says he does not rule out remarrying ex-wife Simone Callahan, but isnt sure whether he can remain committed to her. I still love Simone. I still love my children, Im a very good parent, Im a good dad. I mightnt be the best husband, but Im a good dad and if we can all work that out together and make that work, then great, Warne said in a television interview. 

On whether he would remarry his model-wife Simone, Warne said Im not sure, I honestly dont know. I havent ruled out getting back together, but we both have to work out (whether) thats what we want. I dont think we want to get back for the wrong reasons. Weve got three beautiful children together but weve both got to get back because we both want to. 

Warne has been sharing a Melbourne house with Simone and the children despite the divorce.

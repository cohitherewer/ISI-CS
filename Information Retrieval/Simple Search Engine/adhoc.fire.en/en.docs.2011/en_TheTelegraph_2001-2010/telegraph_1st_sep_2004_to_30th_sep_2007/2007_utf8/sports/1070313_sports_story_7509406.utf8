The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Abandon cavalier approach

FAST TRACK 

 Courtney Walsh 

Our batsmen cut a sorry figure in the warm-up game against India, and the question on everyones lips is: What makes the West Indies such an inconsistent batting side? 

I am afraid I have no easy answers to that one, but one thing I do know, the basics of the game havent changed over the course of time. Grit, determination and application still pay dividends, and that is as true of Tests as of ODIs. 

Sadly, these qualities were not in evidence in the warm-up match. And that is particularly unfortunate because this West Indies squad is as good a one-day team as I have seen, with the potential to go all the way and actually win the Cup. 

So it was disappointing to see that not a single player took the responsibility of steadying the innings. Instead, they played shots around the park and threw their wickets away in cavalier fashion. 

Granted, a warm-up game is just that, and one shouldnt read too much into the loss. But beginning on a positive note has its advantages, as I am sure New Zealand will testify. 

Their loss to Bangladesh merely strengthens the doubts that I have about their abilities away from home. They are still flush from their stupendous run chases against Australia at home, but I remain sceptical about their ability to maintain that form for a tournament of this length. 

England look far more comfortable despite their warm-up loss to Australia, a match that they did not play at full strength. They are in the enviable position of having beaten the Aussies on their own turf, unlike New Zealand, and so have quite a bit of momentum going. 

South Africa, too, appear fairly confident, and should be sorely disappointed if they dont have a good World Cup, given their consistency and recent performances. Considering their depressing World Cup track record, though, anything can happen! 

Despite the South Africans newly-acquired No.1 ODI team status, however, Australia are still the top team for me. If I know them, the recent defeats have made them hungrier, so teams that underestimate them will run a big risk. 

They have shown that they can win without Warne, and McGrath is still around to teach the newer crop of bowlers the tricks of the trade. Indeed, a better teacher would be hard to find. Regardless of whether Andrew Symonds makes it back to the field in time, I would say Australia are a team on a mission. 

What of the subcontinent teams? Everyone reckons they will do well on the relatively low and slow Caribbean tracks. I certainly think Sri Lanka will go all the way, because they are peaking at the right time, and have come into the tournament as one of the best-prepared sides. 

Pakistan are expected to do poorly, which is why I think they will surprise a few. They certainly have the ability to win without Shoaib and Asif, but it is a question of self-belief. 

Finally India. They have one of the strongest batting line-ups of this World Cup, but the key to their success will be bowling. It is a given that Anil Kumble will bowl well, and I expect Irfan Pathan to swing the ball rather than strive for extra pace, which will make him fairly difficult to get away. 

Zaheer Khan has been in top form of late, so he will play a key role. Munaf Patel and Sreesanth are still relatively unknown quantities for me, and how well they support their seniors will probably determine how far India can progress.

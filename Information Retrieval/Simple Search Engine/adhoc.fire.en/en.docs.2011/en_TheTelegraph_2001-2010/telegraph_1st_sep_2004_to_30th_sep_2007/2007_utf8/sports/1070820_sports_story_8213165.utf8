 Father says Inzy has signed up

 Inzamam-ul Haq 

Karachi: Former captain Inzamam-ul Haq has become the first Pakistani player to sign up for the Indian Cricket League (ICL). His father, Pir Intazam-ul Haq confirmed Sunday that his son had indeed signed up for the ICL. 

He is in London where he has to gone to play for Yorkshire. But yes, he has signed with the ICL. That is what he told me when I last spoke to him, he said. 

Inzamam was the first Pakistani player to get an offer from the ICL and had made it clear he was interested in playing for the league as it gave him an opportunity to keep in touch with the game and earn some good money. 

Inzamam has not been given a central contract by the Pakistan Cricket Board after he retired from ODIs. The PCB has said it would not consider any player who is contracted to them for future selection if he plays in the Indian league. 

Meanwhile, unconfirmed reports claimed that Abdul Razzaq, Azhar Mahmood, Imran Farhat and Mohammed Yousuf have also signed up for the ICL. 

It has also been reported that pacers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif, who initially rejected ICL offers, have received fresh enhanced offers from the organisers. 

One of the cricketers on condition of anonymity said the deal was done but the ICL had restricted them from making any announcements. (PTI)

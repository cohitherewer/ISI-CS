The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Guardians put CAB duo in dock

 - Allegation that money changed hands to favour outstation juniors 

SANJIB GUHA

Calcutta: Guardians of three boys from the Videocon School of Cricket and the Mainland Sambaran Cricket Academy have alleged that money changed hands to favour two outstation players Dehra Duns E. Avimanu and Delhis Avishek Raman in the Ambar Roy sub-junior meet last month. 

The allegation is against a CAB office-bearer and somebody very senior connected with the junior selection process. 

The Telegraph is in possession of a copy of the complaint letter. 

The CAB president Prasun Mukherjee, when contacted on Friday evening, said: I have no idea about such a letter, but will definitely check tomorrow (Saturday). 

The CAB official in question said: I know nothing about it, as I dont deal with junior cricket. Amitava Banerjee (a joint secretary) and junior selection committee chairman Sujan Mukherjee are the ones who have been given charge of looking after the junior category. 

Efforts to get a comment from the other gentleman failed. 

The letter dated July 2 signed by Ms R. Verma, and Ms R. Rao and S. Jhunjhunwala has been addressed to the CAB president, and copies sent to the BCCI president Sharad Pawar, secretary Niranjan Shah and chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty. 

According to the letter, the fathers of the two outstation boys paid Rs 2 lakh to a Maidan broker Apu Sengupta. Sengupta shared that money with the two men in question. 

The joint complaint also mentions that the CAB official have assured the outstation players of entries in all age-groups in the future. 

Both these players turned out for Naihati Sporting CCC in the final of the Ambar Roy meet against Videocon School of Cricket at Eden Gardens on June 9. The letter also pointed fingers at Naihati CCC coach Debesh Das. 

Avimanu is a sixth standard student in a Dehra Dun school, while Raman studies in a Delhi Public School in the capital.

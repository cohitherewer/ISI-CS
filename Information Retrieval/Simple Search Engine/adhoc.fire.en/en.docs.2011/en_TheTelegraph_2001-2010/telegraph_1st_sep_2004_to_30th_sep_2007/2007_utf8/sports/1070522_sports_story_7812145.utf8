 McClaren may recall Beckham

MATT DICKINSON

 David Beckham 

David Beckham will find out this week if his England career is to be revived, if only for a couple of matches, and the former captain did his chances no harm with a productive performance Sunday as Real Madrid clinched a dramatic late victory over Recreativo, having thrown away a two-goal lead. 

It would be a remarkable story even by Beckhams standards if he was to be recalled, but Steve McClaren, the head coach, is understood to have given some thought to picking him against Brazil and Estonia. Beckham has not played for his country since the World Cup quarter final defeat against Portugal last summer. 

McClaren has ignored him since but, impressed by the midfield players form, he had thought about picking him for the matches against Israel and Andorra in March. 

Injury ruled Beckham out, but now the head coach is weighing up whether to bring him back for the friendly against Brazil at Wembley on June 1 and the Euro 2008 qualifier against Estonia five days later which, with England fourth in their group, is a must-win match. 

Beckham is desperate to add to his 94 caps. Steven Gerrard took over on the right flank this season but McClaren moved the Liverpool captain into the centre in the last match against Andorra and may want to keep him there. Aaron Lennon has yet to demonstrate that he should be a regular starter on the wing. 

McClaren must consider whether Beckhams experience could be useful at a time when the team is under pressure. 

He must balance that against the knowledge that Beckham is moving to LA Galaxy this summer and, with a far lower standard in the US, would almost certainly not be a long-term option.

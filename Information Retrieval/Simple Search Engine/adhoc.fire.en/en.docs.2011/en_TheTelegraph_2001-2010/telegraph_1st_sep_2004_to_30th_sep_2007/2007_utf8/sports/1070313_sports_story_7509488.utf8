The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Feels kind of funny, says world No.1

AMITAVA DAS GUPTA

 It has been a long wait for Anand 

Calcutta: A world No. 1 from India is a rare breed. When it happens in chess, its all the more special because the game of 64 squares has been so dominated by Russians or Russia-born players over the years. 

Viswanathan Anand has countless feathers on his cap. This was the one which was missing. For a few months in late 2005, he was jointly atop Fides list with Veselin Topalov, but never solely. 

So how does it feel to possess the world No. 1 ranking exclusively, displacing Topalov? 

Its kind of funny I was tied with Topalov in one list and before that I had come close to the top on several occasions, so Im happy that Ill finally be there when the April list comes out, Anand told The Telegraph shortly after returning to his Spanish residence from Linares where he won the Category-20 tournament two days ago. 

Its been a long wait for the man who became Indias first and the youngest at that time Grandmaster 20 years ago, at the age of 17. At some point of time, I stopped thinking about the No. 1 business and just decided to concentrate on the tournaments. I told myself, if it had to come, it would come, said the 37-year-old. 

Anand didnt have to wait till his final-round game (versus Vassily Ivanchuk) to realise that he had become world No. 1. Once Topalov lost in the penultimate round, I knew I would surpass him whatever happened in my last game, said the Indian ace. 

But I didnt want to celebrate then as I wanted to win the Linares title. So I just concentrated on preparing for my game against Ivanchuk It was a tough duel, he put me under a lot of pressure Im glad I managed to draw and seal the crown.How did he celebrate finally? 

I was very exhausted at the end of the tournament. After the press conference, I just relaxed and settled down to watch the Barca (Barcelona) versus Real Madrid match, informed Anand. 

By his calculation, Anands rating would go up to around 2785-2790, about 10 more than Topalov. 

In one way there will be some pressure to hold on to the top spot, but Ive learned from last year not bother too much about numbers My focus will be the world championship in September, Anand signed off.

 Vaughan under fire for outburst

Manchester: England captain Michael Vaughan was Tuesday branded despicable by Lancashire chief executive Jim Cumbes for going public with his criticism of allrounder Andrew Flintoff. 

You have to be honest: the Fredalo incident did affect the team. It did affect morale, said Vaughan. 

An angry Cumbes, who watched Flintoff rise through the Lancashire ranks, before going on to England honours, told reporters at Old Trafford that it was Vaughan who had now damaged team spirit. 

I think it is completely out of order, I think its despicable, I think it stinks against a guy (Flintoff) who has given blood for England these past three or four years. 

Cumbes added: He was the talisman in the Ashes series in 2005 (where Flintoffs heroics with both bat and ball played a central role in Englands first Test series win against Australia for 19 years). (AFP)

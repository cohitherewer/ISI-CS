 Let Dhoni lead in Tests too: Vishy

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Viswanath 

Bangalore: Former India captain (and one-time chief selector) Gundappa Viswanath favours giving the Test captaincy too to Mahendra Singh Dhoni. 

Interacting briefly with The Telegraph, he said: Dhoni got the team to gel together in the World Twenty20 and also looked confident throughout. When hes captaining in the ODIs as well, the selectors should seriously look at giving him the job in all forms... 

Vishy added: Otherwise, the selectors have to go back either to Sachin (Tendulkar) or Sourav (Ganguly)... I believe its better to think of the future... 

Dhonis appointment is till the end of the five-match ODI series against Pakistan. Team Indias first Test after the 12 ODIs (the first seven being versus Australia), is against Pakistan, close to two months from now. 

Meanwhile, despite being upset at losing to Mysore royal Srikanta Dutta Narasimharaja Wadiyar in the recent fight for the Karnataka State Cricket Association presidency, Vishy declined to talk about the elections. 

But, then, he has always been a gentleman. 

All Ill say is that many things happen in life... Thats it... I dont wish to give an elaborate reaction, Vishy said.

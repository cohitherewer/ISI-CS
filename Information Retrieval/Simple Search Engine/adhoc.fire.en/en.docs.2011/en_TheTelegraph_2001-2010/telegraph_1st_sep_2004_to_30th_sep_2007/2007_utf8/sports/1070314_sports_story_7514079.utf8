 PCB chairman getting on players nerves 

Karachi: Pakistani players are grumbling about their board chairman Dr Nasim Ashrafs constant efforts to be around them in the West Indies. 

According to team sources, the players were not amused when Dr Ashraf insisted on sitting with them in the official photograph session on Sunday. 

The sources said Dr Ashraf took the centre chair in the session and sat between captain Inzamam-ul Haq and vice-captain Younis Khan, something which is not supposed to be done during an official ceremony of the World Cup. 

In the past, former heads of boards have got themselves photographed with the team but not at official ceremonies. 

It is not just about the incident at the opening ceremony. The players are not happy with the fact that the chairman... is constantly around them giving them advice, the sources said.

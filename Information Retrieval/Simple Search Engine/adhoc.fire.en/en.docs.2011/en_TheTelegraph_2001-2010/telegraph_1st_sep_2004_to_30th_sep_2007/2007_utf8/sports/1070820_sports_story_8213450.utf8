The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Indias chance to move up

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: India could rise to second or drop to eighth in the the LG ICC ODI Championship rankings by the time their seven-match ODI series in England concludes in early September. 

According to an ICC release, if Rahul Dravids fifth-placed team beats England 7-0 or 6-1, it will move ahead of New Zealand into third position and depending how South Africa get on in their ODI tour of Zimbabwe, it could even sneak into second spot. 

PTI adds from Southampton: Mahendra Singh Dhoni expected the seven-game ODI series to be a good one, even though Indias bowlers needed to get their act right. 

I think its going to be a good series because England are a good side, and performing well against them is always going to be a good challenge for us, said Dhoni.

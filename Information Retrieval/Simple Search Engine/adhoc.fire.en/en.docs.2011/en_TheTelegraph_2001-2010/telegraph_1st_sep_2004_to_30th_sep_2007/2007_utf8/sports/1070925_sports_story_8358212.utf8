 Owen faces surgery again

 Michael Owen 

London: Newcastle manager Sam Allardyce on Sunday night admitted for the first time he was worried that Michael Owen would need surgery to tackle a groin problem that is jeopardising his chances of leading Englands attack in next months Euro 2008 qualifiers. 

Ominously for club and country, the 17 million striker departed a game early for the second successive time after seemingly aggravating a troublesome groin, and on Monday he will undergo further scans, with Allardyce ready to call for immediate surgery. Such action would seem likely to keep Owen out of Englands crunch matches with Estonia and Russia on October 13 and 17. 

Adebayor hattrick 

London: As Emmanuel Adebayor completed his hattrick, Arsne Wenger became nostalgic. The finish from his tall striker from Togo reminded him of the style of Thierry Henry. There were pessimists who thought any reference to Henry so early in the season would be uttered in the context of how much Arsenal were missing him. But so imperious have Arsenal been that Henrys name can be uttered without any accompanying gulps of yearning. 

Its funny, Wenger said, I thought about Thierry on Monday because when he [Adebayor] scored the third goal I thought thats a Thierry goal. There was a defender in front of him, he just opened his foot. There are signs there that he showed a similarity. Hes not the same player as Thierry but this kind of goal; Thierry scored as well. But overall they are different players, Wenger said. 

Terry fury 

London: John Terry is to take legal action over accusations that he played a significant role in the dismissal of Jose Mourinho. The Chelsea and England captain has always spoken warmly of his relationship with his former manager and has been angered by reports that he complained to Chelseas chief executive, Peter Kenyon, about Mourinho. A Sunday newspaper alleged that this was used as evidence that Mourinho had lost the dressing-room and that at a team meeting on Friday, Chelseas players accused their captain of not doing enough to prevent Mourinhos sacking. 

Transfer kitty 

London: Arsene Wenger has been promised a 70 million transfer kitty after Arsenal revealed it is one of Europes richest clubs. Figures unveiled this morning show the clubs move to the Emirates Stadium has driven a near-50 per cent increase in turnover to more than 200 million for the year ending May 31 2007.

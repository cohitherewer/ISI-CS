 Espanyol, Sevilla 2-2 after extra-time

Glasgow: The Uefa Cup final went into a penalty shootout between defending champions Sevilla and Espanyol after the teams finished level at 2-2 at the end of 120 minutes. 

Adriano Correia fired Sevilla ahead after 18 minutes but Albert Riera equalised 10 minutes later. Freddie Kanoute put Sevilla back in front after 105 minutes, but Jonatas equalised for Espanyol after 115 minutes. 

Espanyol had defender Moises Hurtado sent off on 68 minutes for two yellow cards. 

Sevilla, seeking to become just the second team to retain the trophy, had been under pressure at Hampden Park early when a throw by goalkeeper Andres Palop set up a counterattack. 

With Espanyols defence pushing up, Adriano Correira carried the ball in from the left of midfield and ran unchallenged. He cut back onto his right foot and with a defender rushing in to tackle, curled a shot from 10m past goalkeeper Gorka Iraizozs left hand and in at the far post. 

The goal spurred Sevilla and the attacking trio of Frederic Kanoute, Enzo Maresca and Luis Fabiano troubled Espanyols shaken defence. Espanyol was back in the game 10 minutes later. 

Riera picked the ball up and broke down the left. He ran inside Daniel Alves before hitting a shot from 20m that deflected off the recovering right backs sliding challenge and beat Palop to make it 1-1.

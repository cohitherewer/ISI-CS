 THE POLLOCK WAY

Former South African captain Shaun Pollock also spoke at the seminar, conceived by the Asian Cricket Councils energetic chief executive, Syed Ashraful Huq. Here goes: 

Its all about exposure... Makhaya Ntini was a herdsman or whatever when he became intrigued by a group playing cricket in his township... Today, hes one of the finest bowlers... 

In the past, we coined two phrases one run can make a difference and what have I done in the past minute to make a difference to my team... As Walt Disney said, remember, it all started with a mouse... The point Im making is that small things make a difference... 

What lies behind us and what lies ahead of us is tiny compared to what lies within us... 

The fundamentals are important... Its pointless doing the wrong things over and over again... 

We havent done well in World Cups, yes, but its slightly harsh to only judge on how one fares in them... One should be judged on consistency... 

No one coach will admit he has all the expertise... There are no quick-fix solutions and coaches need to have a long-term relationship with players... 

Yes, Im aware the ICCs Cricket Committee has made recommendations... Like a free-hit for no balls... Im glad Im coming to the end of my career! As for changing the balls, they must be standardised... I do have a problem with the free-hit, but not with the ball-change...

 Vengsarkar: I wasnt tense 

 - Dhoni had to concentrate really hard, more so because of the cramps, but was outstanding...

 Indians jubilate after the fall of a Bangladesh wicket in the first ODI 

Dhaka: Cricket manager Ravi Shastri has confessed his heart did miss a beat or two when wickets kept falling in the opening ODI, but chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar said hed been calm. 

I had faith in (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni and (Dinesh) Karthik... Plus, there was Ramesh Powar to follow... Honestly, I wasnt tense, he told The Telegraph after a 45-minute pool side meeting with captain Rahul Dravid and Shastri on Friday afternoon. 

Vengsarkar, who would have been under pressure had the young team tripped at the first hurdle, added: There are advantages in having young players... Even if they dont play, they can take in a lot by watching close finishes first-hand... 

He praised MoM Dhoni for an outstanding innings. He had to concentrate really hard, more so because of the cramps, but was outstanding... What an effort! 

Vengsarkar, who has had a hand in picking Karthik as a batsman who can slip into the big gloves, had praise for him too. 

The five-wicket win, though, took a lot out of the players. Yuvraj Singh, for example, went back to sleep after the pool session. I ran a lot in that heat... I need to recover... 

Yuvraj survived just nine balls, but had been Dhonis runner for much of that exceptional innings.

 England look to boost confidence 

Gros Islet: England wont have too much time to dwell on its six-wicket defeat to New Zealand as it has got to prepare for Canada on Sunday. 

But for England captain Michael Vaughan that suits just fine. Its a good thing we play again so soon, Vaughan said after Fridays opening loss to New Zealand. Bodies might be a little bit tired but its sometimes the best thing to get back on the horse, he said. 

Canada might be the best opponent for a confidence booster it lost by seven wickets to Kenya in group Cs opening match on Wednesday, with captain John Davison finding few positives. 

England will be concentrating on improving its batting. Only Kevin Pietersen (60) scored a half-century, and he looked annoyed after he spooned a shot from New Zealand fast bowler Shane Bond into the hands of James Franklin at long-on. 

He was obviously frustrated and disappointed because I think he fancied three figures and a big score in his first World Cup game, Vaughan said. 

We know the conditions here now. We just need to make sure we improve our performance and make sure we come out on Sunday night with a victory, Vaughan said. 

Well certainly be picking what we feel is the best XI to beat Canada. Vaughan said he was not bothered by his hamstring after the New Zealand match. 

Canada has also been working on its running between wickets, which Davison described as embarrassing against Kenya. 

One key for Canada will be the form of opening batsman Geoff Barnett, who hit 41 off 50 balls with nine boundaries against the Kenyans. Fast bowler Anderson Cummins returned to high-level International cricket by taking one for 32 against Kenya and Canada is also set to rely on his experience against England.

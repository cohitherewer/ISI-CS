 AIFFs request to Goan clubs 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Ludhiana: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has taken a non-confrontational attitude in an effort to get players released from the clubs for the national teams training-cum-exposure trip to Dubai from September 26. 

Last week, Dempo coach Armando Colaco threatened not to release players for the national camp beginning in Goa on September 20. 

In a letter to Dempo and Churchill Brothers on Thursday, AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco has requested the Goan teams to release players. 

He said: A good performance by the national team helps immensely to increase the profile of football in India.

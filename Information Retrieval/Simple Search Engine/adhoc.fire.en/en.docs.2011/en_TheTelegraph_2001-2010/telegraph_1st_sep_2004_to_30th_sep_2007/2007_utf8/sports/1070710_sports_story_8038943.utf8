 Harbhajan impresses

London: Harbhajan Singh impressed on his first outing for county team Surrey by picking three wickets to help bundle out Durham for a paltry 191 in the first innings of their four-day LV County Championship division one cricket match at the Oval here. 

Harbhajan, ignored for Indias ongoing tour of England, captured three quick wickets with some brilliant bowling as Durham were dismissed for their lowest first innings total since August 2002. 

Surreys bowling spearhead Matthew Nicholson also took three wickets after Durham elected to bat on Sunday. 

In reply, Surrey were 198 for 6 in 56.2 overs. Stewart Walters made 70.

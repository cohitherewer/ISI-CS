 EB colts seek easy opener 

Manchester: East Bengal under-15 boys are banking on skill and gumption to make a mark in world finals of the Nike Manchester United Premier Cup. After practising at Carrington Tuesday afternoon, coach Swarup Das confessed his wards have a Herculean task at hand and he was hoping for a kind draw. 

Height is going to be a major problem. Im just praying for a favourable draw. Obviously I dont want my boys to be pitted against Manchester United or Barcelona in the first round. (PTI)

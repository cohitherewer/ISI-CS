The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Madrid: Real Madrid coach Fabio Capello hopes that Steve McClaren will follow his example and recall David Beckham to England squad. I hope for his (Beckhams) sake that he does return as it will make him happy, Capello said on Friday. Hes always behaved like a great professional. Of course it all depends on the England coach, but he could do good things for England. Capello said Beckhams return to the Real Madrid first-choice team after a month on the sidelines had been a boost for them. It has had a very positive effect because of the way he played and because of the enthusiasm and seriousness he has always demonstrated.

 Buenos Aires: Argentine giants River Plate were handed a five-match home ban on Friday after rival factions of the clubs supporters fought amongst themselves in the social area. Late last night (Friday), we confirmed that Rivers stadium will be closed for five games, Anibal Fernandez, interior minister, told a local radio station. The news came after a week of crowd violence, threats and claims of extortion kicked off the second half of the Argentine season following the two-month summer break. The trouble has overshadowed football and the expected debut of Juan Roman Riquelme for Boca Juniors at the weekend after his on-loan move from Villarreal.

 Madrid: Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard said on Saturday he is not planning to quit the European and Spanish champions at the end of the season. Spanish media had reported that political in-fighting at the Catalan club had convinced the Dutchman to bring his time at Barcelona to an end. I have looked into the future And it says, yes, Rijkaard told a news conference, as he made light of a question on whether he would be at Barcelona next year. I have never said I was going to leave. I am happy here, and it is an honour to work here. But it is a bit much to say that I will be here many years because I know how football works. My intention is to stay.

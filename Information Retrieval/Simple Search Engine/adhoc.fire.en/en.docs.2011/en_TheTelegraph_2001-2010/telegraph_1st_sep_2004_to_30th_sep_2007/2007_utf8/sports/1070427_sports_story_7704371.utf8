Bridgetown: Sri Lanka arent the only team that can draw inspiration from the 1996 World Cup triumph. 

While the Sri Lankans are preparing for Saturdays World Cup final against Australia with stories of that win 11 years ago still circulating among players and fans, captain Mahela Jayawardene said countries like Bangladesh and Ireland should also dream big. 

Sri Lanka were among the outsiders in 1996 when they beat favourites Australia to win the title. Innovative tactics and hard work helped the unfancied side overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. 

Bangladesh and Ireland upset India and Pakistan, respectively, to reach the Super Stage of the ongoing World Cup as their more illustrious opponents went home early. 

Jayawardene said the class of 96 Sri Lankans had set an example for all underdogs. 

The 96 group changed the course of Sri Lankan cricket completely and those guys cleared the way for us to achieve higher goals, the captain said. 

As for other minnows, if you put in the hard work and you are dedicated to success, you can achieve anything. 

Sri Lanka, who were far less fancied than co-hosts India and Pakistan during the 1996 competition, introduced a big-hitting game that changed not only the perception of the island team, but that of one-day cricket. 

Until then, teams would usually play tentatively at the start of their innings, only accelerating toward the end of the 50 overs. 

Sri Lanka changed all that with openers Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana smashing bowlers out of the grounds. They took advantage of a rule allowing only two fielders beyond the 30-yard circle for the first 15 overs by hitting the ball over the top. 

Other teams copied the approach, with even Australia sending big-hitting pair Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist at the top of the order. 

Sri Lanka have three survivors from the 96 team Jayasuriya, off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan and pacer Chaminda Vaas all capable of playing key roles in Saturdays final in Bridgetown. 

For us in Sri Lanka, before 96, it was just an amateur sport and those guys went through a lot of hardship, Jayawardene said. 

They had to go to work and then come for practice at 5 clock in the evening and then train. Those guys did a lot of hard work and we are reaping a lot of rewards for that. 

Jayawardene said his players were enjoying the moment and the opportunity to repeat that famous victory against an Australia team that has crushed everyone in its path so far. 

The family of Sanath Jayasuriya, meanwhile, is set to join him in Bridgetown ahead of the final, another report adds from Colombo. Wife Sandra and three kids will leave for London en route to Barbados, a family friend said on Thursday.

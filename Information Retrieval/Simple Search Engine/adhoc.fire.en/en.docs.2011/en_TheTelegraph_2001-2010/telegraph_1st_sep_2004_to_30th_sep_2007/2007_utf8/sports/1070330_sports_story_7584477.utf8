 Pak officers to go to Jamaica

Islamabad: Pakistan will send a senior investigator and a diplomat to Jamaica to assist the investigation of coach Bob Woolmers murder. 

We feel these two officials are required at this stage of the investigation as there is no shred of evidence against Pakistan players, federal minister for sports, Mian Shamim Haider, said here on Thursday. 

The Pakistan government move comes after retired Lahore high court judge Malik Mohammed Qayyum, who carried out the judicial inquiry into match-fixing in Pakistan cricket, earlier on Thursday asked the government to send its own inquiry team. 

As far as Woolmers death is concerned, it is a sad thing. But at the same time we need to look into the allegations of him being murdered due to involvement of the betting mafia. It is a serious issue and must be treated as seriously by our government and board, he said.

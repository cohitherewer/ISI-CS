 Honourable loss for Ireland

CHRISTOPHER MARTIN-JENKINS

 Fulton 

Another honourable defeat for Ireland; another impressive and efficient display in the end by New Zealand. If results over the next week or so lead to a semi-final between New Zealand and Sri Lanka, it virtually guarantees another extremely close match. 

It may take their combined talents to overcome Australia but let us wait and see. For the moment the Black Caps are getting everything right. 

They were tested much more than the scorecard suggests Monday, which will keep them on the boil. 

The square here started remarkably satisfactorily, considering that it had not been used properly before the six Super Eight fixtures but by the time this game had finished, slow had become dead slow and before long it will be hard astern instead. 

If this is to be the stage for Tests and one-day Interntationals in Georgetown in future, they are going to have to say thank you to the highly competent but safety-first ICC advisor, Andy Atkinson, and now and then allow the former Bourda groundsman to build a bit of Caribbean pep into future pitches here. 

In the circumstances New Zealand did well to get the imposing total they did, from a rather unpromising and mildly threatened position of 172 for five in the 39th over. 

 Peter Fulton had done well to hold things together with his 83 but it was the dash and confidence of James Franklin and Brendon McCullum in the last five overs that raised the bar a bit too high for Ireland. 

Shane Bond, sharp as a dagger, made sure that there was no skittish start in response but Ireland rallied through the Briens only to collapse against Vettori and Patel when the task had definitely become too big for them. 

There was no disgrace in that for the Irish, only disappointment cheerfully borne. Once more they had fielded exceptionally well. 

If Eoin Morgan and William Porterfield could bat as well as they field there would have wins against more than Pakistan, but Ireland can still dream of a Pakistan double by beating Bangladesh before they go home.

London: Middlesbrough blew the Premier League title race wide open on Saturday by holding leaders Manchester United to a surprise 1-1 draw at Old Trafford. 

Though the draw gave United a four-point lead over Chelsea, that gap could be slashed to a single point on Sunday when the champions take on Newcastle United at St James Park. 

United have 82 points from 34 games, while Chelsea, who host United in a potential title decider at Stamford Bridge on May 9, have 78 from 33 games. 

Liverpool are 11 points further back after a 2-0 win over Wigan Athletic, while Arsenal lie fourth on 63 points after conceding an equaliser in the fifth minute of stoppage time to draw 2-2 with Tottenham Hotspur in the north London derby. 

Bottom club Watford were relegated after a 1-1 draw with Manchester City, while the race to avoid following them down became tighter after West Ham United beat Everton 1-0 and Charlton Athletic drew 1-1 with Sheffield United. 

Up at the top, the drama was all at Old Trafford where United took a third minute lead through Kieran Richardson. But they were pegged back by Mark Vidukas headed equaliser in first-half stoppage time and denied a potential winner when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had a strike disallowed. 

The Norwegian substitute flicked the ball away from Mark Schwarzer as the Australian keeper prepared to kick it upfield. He was shown a yellow card for unsporting behaviour. 

Liverpool, limbering up for next weeks Champions League semi-final first leg at Chelsea, won a northwest derby with a goal in each half from Dutch striker Dirk Kuyt. With three matches to go, Liverpool should finish above Arsenal, who dropped two points after being behind. 

Spurs, looking to end an eight-year run of 17 matches without a win over Arsenal, went in front on the half-hour mark when Ireland striker Robbie Keane nodded home. 

Arsenals Ivorian defender Kolo Toure scored at the far post in the 64th minute and Togo striker Emmanuel Adebayor looked to have won it with a 78th minute header before Jenas smacked home a superb daisy-cutter from 20 metres. 

Reading made an impressive comeback at Bolton Wanderers, trailing to a 64th minute own goal by Nicky Shorey until six minutes from the end before romping home 3-1 winners. Two goals from Irish forward Kevin Doyle, the first from the penalty spot, turned the game around and Stephen Hunt added a third. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Amorina has the edge 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Trainer Vijay Singh holds the aces in 2,800m Queen Elizabeth II Cup, the star attraction in Saturdays card. Vijays both runners, Amorina and Silver Print, are capable of landing the trophy.

 Both fillies are out and out stayers but Amorina boasts of finishing ahead of Silver Print in all their encounbters till date, barring, of course, the 2,400m Calcutta Oaks when the Steinbeck-Alvarada daughter was ridden in a check and fared poorly. Silver Print, though, enjoys a 6kg pull at the weight, but the expected slow pace may work in favour of Amorina and her jockey, C. Rajendra.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 East Bengal lose four in a row

Manchester: East Bengal played their best match so far but still sunk to their fourth straight defeat as AS Roma blanked them 2-0 in the Nike Manchester United Premier Cup at Carrington on Thursday. 

Romas fleet-footed forward Montini, who often ran the East Bengal defence to dizzy disarray, struck a brace as East Bengals quarter final hopes went up in smoke. 

The East Bengal under-15 squad had not even settled on the field when Roma managed a corner and Montinis header found the net (1-0). 

Though there was no other setback in the first half, East Bengal conceded another soft goal seventh minute into the second session when an unmarked Montini, fed from the left, scored on his second attempt after East Bengal goalkeeper Avishek had blocked the first shot. 

Earlier, the Calcutta outfit went down 0-2 to Austria Wien. East Bengal were pummelled 0-5 by Manchester United in the first match and blanked 0-3 by Shandong Luneng of China in the second. 

For the Austrian side, David (11th) and Christoph (15th) were the scorers. East Bengal put up a slightly improved show in the second session but it was not enough to avert a defeat. (PTI)

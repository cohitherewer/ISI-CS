 Sachin, Yuvraj reply

Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh have sent their replies to a showcause notice from the BCCI for their remarks about ex-coach Greg Chappell, but the ace Mumbai batsman is said to have offered no apologies. 

While Sachin sent his response Saturday morning, Yuvraj said that he had submitted his reply to the BCCI two days ago. 

Sachin reportedly said that he has not apologised but explained his position. 

Yuvraj, who is here to take part in the National Twenty20 tournament, did not divulge details about his letter. Yes, I have replied to the BCCI two days ago, but I dont want to say anything more. I cant reveal the contents of my reply, he said. 

BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla said Sachin had sent his reply but since it was a holiday, the contents of the letter would only be known on Monday. 

I have spoken to him (Sachin) and he said that he has sent his reply in the morning. I cant talk about the contents since we have not received the letter yet, Shukla said. 

It is only on Monday we will know what he has answered. We will analyse the reply and then decide what to do, he said. 

However, secretary Niranjan Shah said he would issue a press statement Sunday. 

I dont know anything. I will talk to the BCCI office people and issue a media statement tomorrow at noon, Shah told reporters in Rajkot. 

Sachins showcause issue had come up for discussion at the managing committee meeting of the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) Friday evening with its vice-president and national selection panel chairman Dilip Vengsarkar supporting the master batsman. 

Vengsarkar was vociferous in his support of Tendulkar, said a managing committee member. 

MCA joint secretary Lalchand Rajput said: The issue came up and I was asked why I didnt back Sachin at the BCCI working committee meeting. I told them that it was a unanimous decision to seek an explanation.

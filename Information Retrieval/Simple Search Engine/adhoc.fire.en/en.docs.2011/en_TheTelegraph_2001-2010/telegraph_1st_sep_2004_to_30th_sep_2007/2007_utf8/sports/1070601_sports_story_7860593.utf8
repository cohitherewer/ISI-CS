Earlier in the day, Kerai defeated Peter Custers of Holland, M. Ivashko of Ukraine and R Girouille of France on the way to book a place in the last eight. 

Top archer Tarundeep Rai crashed out in the third round, while Rahul Banerjee bowed out in the second round. 

Rai lost to B Tsyrempilov of Russia 109-115, while Banerjee was beaten by local hope Goktug Ergin 110-104. 

Among women, veteran Arjuna awardee Dola Banerjee was the only one to get past the first round. But, she was outplayed by Y Lobzhenidze of Ukraine 108-94.

New Delhi: The cricketers finally had their way on the contentious contracts issue, forcing the BCCI to go back to the graded system under which the top five players get a retainership of Rs 50 lakh each annually. The graded system had expired on October 1 last year. 

There will also be no cap on endorsements. 

The BCCI had planned to abolish the graded system after the teams disastrous performance in the World Cup with a combination of match fees and bonuses. 

Faced with stiff resistance from the players, the working committee on Tuesday chose to revert to the system under which the top 15 players are graded A, B, and C. 

The working committee decided to have the graded system till September this year. The B and C category players get Rs 35 lakh and Rs 20 lakh each per annum. 

At the meeting, the itinerary for Indias home series against Australia and Pakistan later this year was announced. Calcutta will host the second Test versus Pakistan from November 30 in the three-match series. 

The first Test will be staged in Delhi (November 22-26) while the third is scheduled for Bangalore (December 8-12). 

Delhi and Jamshedpur were No. 13 and 14 on the ODI rotation list. With the top 12 being allotted matches, the two centres will get their turn during the next home series. 

Australia will arrive on September 25 to play seven one-dayers while Pakistan will arrive on November 2 for a full-fledged series of five one-dayers and three Tests.

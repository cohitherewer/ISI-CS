 Romantic fires in Stakes 

 STAR RACER 

 Calcutta: The city, it seems, never sleeps between Christmas and New Years Day. RCTCs stands were packed and most of them said they barely had time to change after the late night bash on the last day of the year. Nearly 17,000 of them cheered all favourites, including Romantic Fire a 35-100 hot fancy from trainer Vijay Singhs yard the facile winner of the 1,200m Sprinters Trophy. C.Rajendra partnered the Steinbeck-Allspice son.

 A total of five favourites, in the eight-event card, justified their wagering to keep the crowd in a cheerful mood. 

 The rich Indian Produce Stakes, on the other hand, brought disappointment for many. Vijays three-horse strong contingent failed to contain the Daniel Davids less-fancied winner, Steal The Glory, who claimed a purse of about Rs 4 lakh. The Conquering Hero-Winter Dreams colt, however, had to win the race again in the stewards room following an objection lodged by the jockey of the second-placed horse, Regal Connection (Rajendra-up).

 Rajendra was taken to the stewards room again after his ward Daramatikos interfered with trainer Robin Corners Firing Power on way to her victory.

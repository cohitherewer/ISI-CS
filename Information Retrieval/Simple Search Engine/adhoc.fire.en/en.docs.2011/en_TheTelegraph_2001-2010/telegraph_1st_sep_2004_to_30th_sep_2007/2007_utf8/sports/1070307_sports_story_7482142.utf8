The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bagan let Rovers off the hook

Calcutta: Mohun Bagans young brigade failed to seize the opportunity and let Tampines Rovers snatch a point from their Group E opener of the AFC Cup at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. 

The match ended in a goalless draw, but losing vital ground at home may affect Mohun Bagans chances of qualifying to the next round. On paper and current form at least, their next opponents Pehang of Malaysia and Osotpa M-150 of Thailand are more formidable challengers than the Singaporean visitors. 

Mohun Bagan coach Chima Okerie claimed moral victory after the match. True, the green-and-maroon brigade can take pride in the football they played on Tuesday. 

It was spectacular watching Chimas Midas touch, the way his young players ran, huffed and puffed and put the visitors on the mat almost throughout the match. 

But football is also about winning and the sooner his players become aware of this, the better. 

The PC Lalawmpuias and Lalkamal Bhowmicks sparkled, but they lacked the cutting edge. Bhaichung Bhutia, nursing a calf muscle injury and watching the match from the press box, was sorely missed in the middle. 

Tampines Rovers preferred to play their cards close to their chests. They hardly looked threatening and preferred merely to go through the motions. 

They were reduced to 10 men during the final injury time of the match, when their Thailand international, Suksomkit Sutee, received marching orders following a double booking. By then, however, Tampines Rovers were assured of a moral victory. 

Chima started in a 3-5-1-1 formation with Sushil Kumar Singh playing in the hole, behind the lone striker Lalawmpuia. 

Apart from the aged backline Anit Ghosh, Deepak Mondal and Douglas da Silva, making their debuts in green and maroon colours the young side exuded naivete. The fact that goalkeeper Shilton Paul started for the first time in the season demonstrated it further. 

It was the Singaporean outfit who came on the offensive initially. Mohun Bagan had to survive a couple of dangers from Tampines Rovers leading striker Mohd Noa Alam Shah bin Kamarezaman inside the first 10 minutes. 

However, the visitors received a blow to their plans when Alam Shah departed in the 36th minute, following a groin injury. As they retreated from their attacking policy, Mehtab Hussain-led Mohun Bagan changed gear. 

Lalkamal and Rahul Kumar missed target in back-to-back attempts following a faulty clearance from Sutee in the 52nd minute. Then Lalkamals screaming shot from about 30 yards crashed onto the crosspiece and Lalawmpuia was unable to get to the ball following Sushils deft minus. 

Towards the end, Mohun Bagan survived another scare when Rovers Brazilian striker Peres de Oliveiras chip forced Shilton to stretch to the full in tipping the ball over the horizontal. 

Strong in tackle and a shrewd organiser, Douglas experience came in handy in the backline and the Brazilian earned himself the Man-of-the-Match award in his first match for Mohun Bagan. Deepak and Anits watchful eyes also made sure no damage was done. But it was the upfront which cost the team dear. The Lalawmpuias were given an opportunity and asked to sparkle in the absence of stars. Like the match against East Bengal, they failed once again, making the task tougher for Chima, who happened to be the most dreaded striker of his time.

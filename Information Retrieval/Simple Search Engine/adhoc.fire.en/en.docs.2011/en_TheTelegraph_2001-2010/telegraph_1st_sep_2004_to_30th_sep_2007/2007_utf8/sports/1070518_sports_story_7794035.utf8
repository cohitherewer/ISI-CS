 AIFF contract based on Bundesliga

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi: The model contract for professional club players, proposed by the AIFF for the 2007-08 season, is based on the Bundesliga. 

We studied the contracts system of some other countries like Singapore and Malaysia, and found the Bundesliga one to be the best, said AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco on Thursday. 

Colaco explained that the proposed contract is only a model one and not binding on the players or clubs. 

Everyone in Indian football was talking about the lack of a model contract for players. So we decided to put one out. None of the clauses mentioned in it are binding. It is left to the players and clubs to decide what terms and conditions they agree on while signing the contract. 

The only thing that the AIFF is insisting on is to have a proper system where each professional footballer should have a written contract with the club, a copy of which should be made available to the respective state associations and the AIFF. 

There is no diktat in the 12-page contract except for the first page where it is mentioned that there should be a contract between a player and his club, Colaco explained. 

The existing contracts system in India, the AIFF secretary pointed out, is flawed. Clubs sometimes make players sign on papers, which later turn out to be against the footballers interest. Our attempt is to streamline the system.

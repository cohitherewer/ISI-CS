 Experience counts for Thierry Henry

 Thierry Henry 

Beijing: Arsenal striker Thierry Henry is fed up with finishing fourth in the English Premier League and thinks the club needs a more experienced squad if it is to challenge Manchester United and Chelsea. 

The Frenchman refused to discuss reports that he could soon be leaving for Barcelona but was less than passionate when talking about his commitment to the club he joined in 1999. 

Since I started playing football, theres been speculation about me going to a lot of clubs so that will never stop, Henry, who signed a new four-year deal with Arsenal last May, told a news conference in the Chinese capital on Wednesday. 

As I have said before, for now Im an Arsenal player. 

Earlier this month, Barcelona president Joan Laporta said he was finalising the signing of the French striker, and newspapers in Spain have reported he may get a three-year deal. 

If he goes, Henry might replace Cameroon striker Samuel Eto, who is reportedly for sale at the Catalan club. In Spain, Henry would be able to showcase his quick ball skills in what is probably Europes most technical league, teaming up front with Ronaldinho and Lionel Messi. 

Henry is coming off an injury-filled season at Arsenal, who finished fourth in the Premier League behind Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool. 

Injuries will keep him out of two upcoming European Championship qualifying matches: France play Ukraine on Saturday and Georgia on June 6. 

Henry said he was frustrated by Arsenals poor finish. He also suggested the London club relied too much on young players. 

This year it was pretty difficult to see once again that we finished so far way from the top teams, he said. But a lot of teams behind us can say that, too. Im getting annoyed that were finishing at the end of the top four now. 

Sometimes having a lot of youngsters in your squad Im not trying to look for any excuses you cannot have the same sprit, the same results. Winning is a very difficult process. You just dont arrive there. 

Henry, in Beijing on a promotional tour for a sporting goods manufacturer, contrasted the current Arsenal team with the side that won the title without losing a match in 2004. 

Ive been in the side which stayed unbeaten a whole season, so I do know what it takes to win the league, he said. 

Henry said he did not know what plans there were for strengthening the squad this summer. 

Talking about resources, its out of my hands, its not what I do at the club, he said. The only thing I would like to say is that it has to happen from the pitch. 

He also hinted that his retirement from international soccer might come at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, provided France qualify. 

It will be amazing to play in Africa, he said. It will be actually, I think, my last tournament because you cant play all your life. 

Henry also sympathised with the pressure on Chinese athletes with the Beijing Olympics barely a year away. China is expected to top the medal table, dislodging the US from its traditional perch. 

Im afraid its a pressure that wont go away, Henry told Chinese reporters. I know how hard it is to perform at home. The expectations of the country will be pretty high. But what a chance to be always remembered as the guy who won the gold medal at home. 

Henry was noncommittal about an invitation to attend the Olympics from basketball star Yao Ming. He said playing in next summers European Championship might interfere. 

But why not, he said. You never know what can happen. When you receive an invitation like that you always have to take it into consideration.

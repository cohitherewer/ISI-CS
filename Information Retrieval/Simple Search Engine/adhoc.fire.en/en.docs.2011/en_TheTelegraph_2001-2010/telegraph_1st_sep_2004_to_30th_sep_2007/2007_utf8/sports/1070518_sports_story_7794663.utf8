 Bookies to skip Ooty races 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC) bookmakers will not operate at the Ootacamund races with effect from Friday until further notice. However, the totalisator betting operation will continue as usual, according to an RCTC notification.

 No one was willing to stand on the Ooty races right from the start. We had agreed to conduct the business till the Derby day on a request from RCTC, said a bookmaker.

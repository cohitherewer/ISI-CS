 Court upholds Canas appeal

Geneva: The Swiss supreme court has overturned an arbitration ruling that had confirmed Argentine player Guillermo Canas doping ban last year, CAS said on Thursday. 

The ruling last week, which has not yet been published, followed an appeal by Canas against the CAS decision on his ATP suspension in 2005 on a doping charge. 

The Swiss federal tribunal has upheld the appeal and has decided to annul the award by CAS, Matthieu Reeb, secretary general of the Swiss-based sports arbitration court, said. 

Reeb said CAS could not decide on what steps need to be taken until it receives the full judgement. 

A panel of CAS arbitrators had cut Canas ban 15 months in May 2006 after the player appealed against his two year suspension.

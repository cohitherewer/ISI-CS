London: The Netherlands, Germany and Spain scored morale-boosting wins in friendly matches on Wednesday, but there were home defeats for England and France. 

The Dutch, who top qualifying Group G ahead of Bulgaria, were the nights highest scorers beating Russia 4-1 in Amsterdam with all four goals coming in the second half. 

It was a bad night for Dutchman Guus Hiddink, the Russia coach, who is being investigated for alleged tax evasion by Dutch prosecutors demanding he serves a jail sentence. 

He certainly endured plenty of punishment in the second half at the Amsterdam Arena as Ryan Babel, Wesley Sneijder, Joris Mathijsen and Rafael van der Vaart scored for the home side. Bulgaria had a good night in Cyprus, winning 3-0 against the home side with Dimitar Berbatov scoring twice. 

Germany, who lead Group D, were too sharp for Switzerland, the co-hosts of Euro 2008, with Juergen Loews new-look side winning 3-1 in Duesseldorf. 

Goals from the recalled Kevin Kuranyi, new boy Mario Gomez and Torsten Frings gave the Germans victory. The Czechs, second in the same group on goal difference, underlined their credentials with a 2-0 win in Belgium. 

Spain, struggling to qualify from Group F and already a long-shot to be at the finals, looked good at Old Trafford, beating England at home for the first time since 1981 thanks to Andres Iniestas stunning 63rd minute strike. 

The home side were booed off as their winless streak under coach Steve McLaren stretched to four matches. World Cup finalists France, second in Group B behind surprise leaders Scotland, suffered a rare defeat at the Stade de France, going down 1-0 to Argentina with a goal after 15 minutes from Javier Saviola.

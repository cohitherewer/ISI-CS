Villa Allende: US Open champion Angel Cabrera was welcomed by hundreds of Argentines during a motorcade from the airport to his home on Tuesday. 

With an Argentina flag draped over his shoulders, Cabrera held the trophy aloft through the sunroof of a station wagon during the drive with a police escort at Villa Allende in the central province of Cordoba. 

Cheering and clapping bystanders, and others who honked their horns, were greeted by thumbs up from Cabrera and his cries of Thank you! Thank you! 

The first Argentine winner of a golf major in 40 years stopped briefly in a local plaza to thank a crowd of more than 200 people. 

There was also a banner noting his nickname Pato, that read Welcome, Duck! in Spanish over the words Ganador, Abierto Golf EE.UU. 

Translation: Winner, The US Open. 

Cabrera survived charges by Tiger Woods and Jim Furyk to win by a stroke on Sunday at Oakmont. 

The only other Argentine to win a major was Roberto De Vicenzo in the 1967 British Open. 

Cabrera was joined by his two sons in the motorcade to his home, not far from where he first learned to golf as a caddie at a local club. 

This was just so unexpected. Its like a dream to win the US Open, said Cabreras son, also named Angel, Its like winning the World Cup. 

De Vicenzo also paid tribute to Cabreras triumph and expressed his delight that a fellow-Argentine has won a major during his lifetime. 

Its fantastic, the 84-year-old de Vicenzo told the PGA Tour in an interview. Cabrera is now a hero in Argentina. 

Hes my hero! Im very happy for him because I didnt want to leave this world before I saw something like this. 

It is very good for our country. He beat the best players in the world, including Tiger Woods and Jim Furyk.

Calcutta: Two days after the weather god spared East Bengal major embarrassment in the CFL Premier Division, Subrata Bhattacharya came back a wiser man to turn the tables on Peerless. 

Ghanaian defender Abdul Samed scored his first goal in red-and-gold colours with the clock showing 14 minutes, Alvito DCunha and Dipankar Roy added to the tally after change of ends to complete an apparently comfortable victory. But despite avoiding a morale-crushing mishap, the East Bengal coach must be a worried man. 

For starters, he will miss Ashim Biswas in the next match scheduled to be against Mohun Bagan for a double booking. The hard-working forward, who has been shaping up well with Edmilson Marques, was cautioned on Tuesday for kicking Babin Biswas. 

Having seen his shaky defence being tested time and again by Peerless foreigner duo James Agbo and Subair Muritala Ali on Sunday, Subrata brought in the hard-tackling Madhab Das. His brief was to shadow Subair and he had the licence to do so any which way. 

Madhab obliged his coach with some desperate lunges and uncouth tackles, one of which attracted a yellow card. Udayan Haldar went on to caution a third East Bengal player, Alvito, which prompted the coach to take off his most valuable midfielder. 

The Madhab move revealed the mindset of the East Bengal coach. One cant blame him, with Samed and Gurpreet hardly inspiring much confidence. 

It wont be a surprise if Subrata uses Madhab as a policeman for Jose Ramirez Barreto as well. That, though, could be a double-edged sword. Just as Madhab could provoke Barreto into an act of indiscretion, the defenders one-track mind may help the wily Brazilian hit bulls eye. 

Coming back to Tuesdays game, the East Bengal fans can take heart from the spirited performance of youngsters Aibor Khongjee and Marlangki Suting. 

Edmilson, though, had an off day. Joint top-scorer with fellow-Brazilian Barreto so far (five goals each), the tall striker failed to connect a measured Ashim cross with his head. 

Edmilson would still have got on the scoresheet had a thunderous 30-yard free-kick not thudded into the crosspiece off goalkeeper Rakesh Prasads palm. 

Sameds was a copybook defenders goal. Having made his way into the rival penalty box before an Alvito corner, Samed timed his spot jump to perfection and headed the ball home. 

Five minutes into the second half, overlapping left-back Saumik Deys through ball was diverted into goal by Alvito even as the Peerless defence froze in anticipation of an off-side call. The flag stayed down. 

The third goal was an Ashim creation. As he floated the ball into danger zone, Edmilson missed the header but the ball fell in Dipankars path and he made no mistake in giving it proper direction. 

Peerless didnt look a shadow of the team which beat Mohammedan Sporting and led East Bengal 2-0 at the time of abandonment. The likes of Saheb Ali, Agbo and Babin did make some threatening forays but were clueless about how to finish. 

A Subair free-kick was the closest Peerless came to scoring. It was well executed from five yards off the penalty box, and equally well handled by keeper Abhra Mondal.

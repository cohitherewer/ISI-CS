 TELEGRAPH SCHOOL CHESS

 at Gorky Sadan on Monday. A Telegraph picture 

 Calcutta: The 19th edition 

 of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship 

 at Gorky Sadan is poised for an exciting finish. After the 

 conclusion of the 9th round, top seed Shreyansh Daklia of 

 Chhattisgarh and Sukanya Dutta of South Point sit pretty 

 at the top with 8 points apiece. A bunch of 5 players follow 

 the leaders half a point behind on 7.5 points each. 

 Sukanya, however, is well placed 

 between them, as she has the better progressive score. But 

 she has an uphill task as she faces defending champion Bitan 

 Banerjee in the penultimate round. If she does win both 

 her remaining rounds, Sukanya will be the first girl to 

 win the championship.

 Shreyansh, on the other hand, 

 meets Abhratanu Dutta of St James in the next round. Interestingly, 

 Shreyanshs elder brother, Jain Shrenik had won the 

 17th edition in 2004.

 Shreyansh got the better of overnight 

 leader Diptanu Das of St Augustine Days School with 

 the white pieces in a queens pawn opening. Sukanya, 

 playing against Imtiaz Islam Borah of Assam, obtained an 

 advantage in the opening as she won the exchange in a Sicilian 

 Najdorf. 

 Borah got an attack in the bargain 

 but Sukanya thwarted all his threats after which her material 

 advantage decided the fate of the game.

 Bitan Banerjee faced little resistance 

 from Mohana Sengupta as he got a clear positional advantage 

 in the opening, which he exploited methodically to win two 

 pieces and the game.

 Pallabi Roy of Indira Gandhi Memorial 

 HS decimated ninth seed Samrat Ghorai of Marias Day 

 School by a kingside attack in a mere 17 moves.

 Abhratanu Dutta of St James had 

 little difficulty in getting the better of Parikshit Upadhyay 

 of Assam while the youngest participant Mitrabha Guha of 

 South Point took his tally to 5 points by drawing against 

 his schoolmate Ankit Basak.

 The tenth round begins at 10 am 

 Tuesday.

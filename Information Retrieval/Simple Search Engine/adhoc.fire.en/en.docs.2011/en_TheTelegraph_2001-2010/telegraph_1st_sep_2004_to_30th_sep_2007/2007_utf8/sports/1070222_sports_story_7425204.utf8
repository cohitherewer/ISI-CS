 We have time to turn it around: McGrath 

 Glenn McGrath

Melbourne: Pace bowler Glenn McGrath thinks Australia have time to turn around their form slump before beginning their World Cup defence next month in the Caribbean. 

Australia have warm-up games against Zimbabwe and England in the week before they kick off their World Cup campaign against Scotland in St Kitts on March 14. 

But the experienced McGrath, who was rested as New Zealand reached their target of 347 with three balls to spare at Seddon Park, said Australia had the ability to regroup. 

It wasnt the best tour for us over there in New Zealand but we would rather get that out of the way now a few weeks before the first (World Cup) game so we can work out what we need to do differently and turn it around, McGrath told reporters on the teams return to Sydney on Wednesday. 

For stand-in skipper Mike Hussey it completed a wretched series, and took his record at the helm of the world champions to four defeats out of four. 

Its pretty difficult and I feel pretty demoralised really Ill probably take a little while to get over it, Hussey said after New Zealand recovered from 41 for four and 116 for five to reach their unlikely victory target. 

However coach John Buchanan, who just last month complained that England and New Zealand were too poor to give his team of champions a competitive hit-out, said there was no need to radically overhaul World Cup preparations. 

Theres no getting away from the fact wed like to be winning, theres no doubt about that. But Im still very confident about the planning weve put in place, the preparations well do when we get there and the team that weve got. 

So this is behind us now and we look forward to a week or so away, Buchanan said. 

Buchanan conceded selectors may need to consider their options once they receive information on a string of injuries including Matthew Hayden (toe), Andrew Symonds (torn bicep), Brett Lee (ankle) and Michael Clarke (hip). (Agencies)

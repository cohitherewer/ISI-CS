 Time now to start winning more often 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chennai: The singles titles column on Xavier Malisses CV read one, before Sunday evening that is. Now that he has won his second, the 26-year-old Belgian is hungry for more. 

My goal is not top-10 or anything, I want to win more titles now. If I can win more championships, my ranking would automatically improve, Malisse said, after routing Stefan Koubek in the Chennai Open final. 

For a man who won just one of his first nine finals spread over eight years and struggled to fulfil his early promise, it wasnt difficult to understand Malisses current goal. Some players take longer to mature than others... Luck also plays a part. Like last year, I was playing really well but had some tough draws. But Ive been in the top-50 for seven years now, so its not too bad. Maybe its time now to start winning more often. If I can keep playing like this, I can have a good year and achieve my goal, said Malisse. 

Koubek had been playing great all week, so I had to watch out. Im glad I played well today except for the final game when I was a bit nervous. I was aggressive, I served well and played the important points better, said Malisse. 

Koubek said his opponent played unbelievable tennis. He got a quick start and maintained the tempo right through. He had an answer for everything that I tried, was how the Austrian summed up the final. 

But Koubek, who had to serve out a three-month doping-related ban in 2005, was delighted with his performance this week. Ive had an awesome week... Couldnt have started the year better than being runner-up. Hope I can make some more finals and win a few titles.

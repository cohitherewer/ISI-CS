 Chopra up to 54th spot

 Hawaii Golf 

Honolulu: American Charles Howell III took charge at the Sony Open after Hawaiian teenager Tadd Fujikawa provided the feel-good story in Saturdays third round. 

Howell fired a five-under-par 65, the best score of the day, to move one shot clear and raise hopes of a first PGA Tour victory in more than four years. 

Three off the pace overnight, the 27-year-old from Augusta birdied four of the last six holes to finish on 13-under 197 at a blustery Waialae Country Club. 

For the second day running Daniel Chopra saved himself with a fine back nine, that included an eagle on the closing 18th, as he moved up from tied 62nd to 54th. 

The Swede of Indian origin was once again four-over after the front stretch with bogeys on second, sixth, seventh and ninth. Birdies on 12th and 16th brought some order and then a superb eagle got him to even par for the day. 

In each of his three rounds, Chopra has not dropped a single shot on the back nine and has played it in nine-under, but on front nine he was one-over for the first day and four-over on second and third days. 

Britains Luke Donald, who narrowly missed an eagle attempt from 39 feet at the last, had to settle for second place after carding a 69. 

Honolulu schoolboy Fujikawa, who became the second-youngest player to make a PGA Tour cut Friday, continued his magical week by vaulting into contention with a 66. 

The diminutive 16-year-old amateur rattled up six birdies and two bogeys to finish at seven under in a four-way tie for eighth place.

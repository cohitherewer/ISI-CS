 Hussey pins hopes on Symonds 

St Johns: Michael Hussey believes that teammate Andrew Symonds could fill the gap left by injured allrounder Shane Watson. 

Symonds Queensland teammate sustained a left calf muscle strain in Australias win against Bangladesh here last Saturday and is doubtful for the remainder of the meet. 

Watsons medium-pace bowling and aggressive batting helps balance the Australia team but his absence ahead of Sundays Super Eight clash against England leaves Australia pondering whether to play an extra batsman or bowler. 

However, Symonds could take up Watsons overs. A dynamic batsman and brilliant fielder who can bowl off-spin, Symonds also has the ability to bowl at a brisk and often under-rated medium-pace with a well-disguised slower ball. 

But he has not been able to operate at his quickest in recent matches because of a biceps injury. He is though regaining fitness and during Australias practice at the Antigua Recreation Ground Friday repeatedly bowled his medium pacers. Its going to be important, said Hussey of Symonds seam bowling. Hes a very versatile cricketer, his batting and his fielding are outstanding. 

I think hes just getting a lot more confidence with his bicep now. Hes been bowling spin in the nets and in the matches but now he feels he has the confidence in the arm to bowl medium pace as well and having that all-round package is a huge plus for the team. (AFP)

Durban: Mohammed Yousufs unbeaten century spurred Pakistan to an emphatic win over South Africa in the second one-day International in Durban on Wednesday. 

Pakistan won by 141 runs to level the five-match series. 

Yousuf top-scored with 101 not out as Pakistan totalled a record 351 for four after winning the toss and choosing to bat. Pakistan then dismissed South Africa for 210 in 40.1 overs with leg-spinner Shahid Afridi taking three for 25. 

Yousuf faced 111 balls and hit 12 fours in a relatively measured innings that contrasted sharply with the frenetic batting of some of his teammates. 

Other key contributors included Man of the Match Younis Khan, who scored 93, Afridi, who was 77 not out, and Imran Nazir, who made 57, as Pakistan reached a record one-day total against South Africa. It was also their third highest total against any opposition. 

The free-scoring Afridi reached his half-century off 20 balls, while Nazir, in his first one-day international since July 2004, passed 50 in 32 balls. 

In all, Afridi faced 35 balls and hit five fours and six sixes. 

The South Africans bowled too short on a pitch that offered bounce but less pace than expected, and the Pakistanis took full toll by smashing 35 fours and 11 sixes in their innings. 

South Africas reply never caught fire. AB de Villiers top-scored with 43 while Jacques Kallis and Herschelle Gibbs shared 61 for the third wicket. 

But Pakistan took wickets in clusters, removing Gibbs, Kallis and Ashwell Prince in the space of 11 deliveries. 

Consequently, the South Africans struggled to maintain momentum. 

A power failure in the 20th over of South Africas innings interrupted play for 55 minutes.The third match of the series is in Port Elizabeth on Friday.

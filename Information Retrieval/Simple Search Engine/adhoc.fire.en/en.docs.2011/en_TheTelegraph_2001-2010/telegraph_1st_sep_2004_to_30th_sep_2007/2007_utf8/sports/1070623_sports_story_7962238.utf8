 Army lessons for Pak 

Abbottabad: They were scared at first, but Pakistans cricketers have emerged from 15 gruelling days of army training in peak condition. 

The 20-member squad was confined to a spartan military base in the northwestern city of Abbottabad in a bid to improve fitness and discipline. 

Shoaib Maliks men will need to be in good shape for the coming season, which starts next week with a trip to Scotland to play one-day Internationals against the hosts and India. Pakistan are also due to host South Africa and Australia. 

Fitness has been Pakistans weakness in recent years, with Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Asif and Abdul Razzaqs absence from the World Cup considered the main reason for a humiliating first-round exit. 

It prompted the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to ask the army for help. (AFP)

 Coroners role in probe

Kingston: Pakistan coach Bob Woolmers murder could be one of the few instances in which a coroners inquest has been ordered that too reasonably quickly in keeping with the law in Jamaica, according to a newspaper. 

Police commissioner Lucius Thomas announced on Friday that a coroners inquest would be held after the 58-year-old Woolmer died of asphyxia caused by manual strangulation in his hotel room. 

A coroner is a resident magistrate, appointed under the Coroners Act, to conduct investigations into the deaths of persons which occur within his or her jurisdiction, where there is reasonable cause to suspect that the deaths are violent or unnatural. 

Commissioner Thomas is reported to have ordered that the inquest be held as soon as possible.

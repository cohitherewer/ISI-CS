The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The Whatmore factor at play...

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Dav Whatmore

Dhaka: Its to be seen when and how the Board of Control for Cricket in India makes a move assuming it does over Dav Whatmore. 

Already, however, quite a few in Team India are seeing Bangladeshs outgoing coach as the frontrunner to succeed Greg Chappell. 

Nobody has gone on record its unlikely that anybody will after what happened to Sachin Tendulkar but the odd word and glance here and there couldnt be missed during the teams six-day stay here. 

Interestingly, even though the Pakistan Cricket Board has confirmed its interest in Whatmore, indications are that the Australians first choice will definitely be India. 

Of course, Im interested in coaching India and moving there would be a logical progression, but that doesnt mean Ive been lobbying, is what Whatmore told The Telegraph exactly a week ago. 

If a reminder is needed, it was under his guidance that Sri Lanka won the 1996 World Cup. In more recent times, Bangladeshi cricketers have been big beneficiaries. 

The shrewd customer that he is, Whatmore is probably watching the Rahul Dravids more closely than he otherwise would have and could be making notes which may come in handy even after the end of Indias current tour. 

Indeed, the next few weeks could just be more exciting off the field.

 WI pathetic show hurts Richards

London: Viv Richards, West Indies most successful captain, said on Sunday that it hurt to watch the mistake-ridden current crop of islanders as they lurch towards yet another defeat. 

Although debutant pace bowler Darren Sammy took seven wickets on Saturday, his teammates produced a miserable display with a series of laughable misfields and dropped catches that brought howls of derision from the crowd. 

For Richards, one of the finest batsmen to grace the game but also a devastating fielder, it was painful to watch. 

What we have witnessed here, the fielding, those elementary things, something is missing and you do worry and it does hurt, he told a British radio station. 

I agree (the desire is missing), maybe I could send out the rallying call. 

When you look at Dwayne Bravo, the way he enjoys his cricket, he could have been a part of what took place in the 70s and 80s. And I wonder if he realises the job, he is faced with, of helping some of these guys to enjoy the game itself rather than looking so placid at times. 

Richards knows all about success, having never lost a series during his 11 years and 50 Tests as captain from 1980 and the decline since those glory years has been nothing short of astonishing, particularly away from home. (Reuters)

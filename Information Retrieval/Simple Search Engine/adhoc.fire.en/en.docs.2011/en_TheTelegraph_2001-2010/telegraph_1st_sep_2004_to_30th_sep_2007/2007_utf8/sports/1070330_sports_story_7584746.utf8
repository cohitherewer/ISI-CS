 Robin Peterson reprimanded 

Georgetown: Robin Peterson has been reprimanded for smashing the stumps in celebration after he hit the winning runs in South Africas gripping one-wicket win over Sri Lanka on Wednesday. 

It was decided to give him an official reprimand, no fine will be imposed, Match Referee Jeff Crowe said after Peterson attended a hearing Thursday. 

Peterson ended the match when he edged a four to the third-man boundary off fast bowler Lasith Malinga. 

I actually meant to swing my bat above the stumps but my spikes got caught up in the pitch and I lost balance, Peterson said. (Reuters)

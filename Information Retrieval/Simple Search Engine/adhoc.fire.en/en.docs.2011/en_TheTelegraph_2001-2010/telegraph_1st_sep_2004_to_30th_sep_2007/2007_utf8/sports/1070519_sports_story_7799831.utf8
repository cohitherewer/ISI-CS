 Debutant Prior among four centurions

London: England exploited sloppy West Indies fielding and a monotonously one-dimensional pace attack on Friday to plunder 553 for five on the second day of the first Test at Lords. 

Paul Collingwood, dropped on 31 and 36, scored 111, Ian Bell reached 109 not out and Matt Prior became the first England wicketkeeper to score a century on debut with a sparkling 126. 

They joined Alastair Cook (105) on the Lords honours board to mark the first time since 1938 that four English batsman have passed three figures in the same innings. 

A capacity crowd on the first sunny day in London for more than a week thoroughly enjoyed the entertainment but, after a testing opening hour, the West Indies were barely competitive. 

The West Indies have won only one Test abroad in the past 10 years, are now ranked eighth in the rankings ahead of only Bangladesh and Zimbabwe and have not played a Test this year. 

They started the day promisingly enough after England resumed on 200 for three after Thursdays opening day was brought to a premature close through bad light. 

Cook added only three to his overnight total of 102 before he was caught by Dwayne Bravo off Jerome Taylor, whose six overs on Thursday went for 35 runs. 

Collingwood turned Taylor for a boundary then cover-drove another four off the back foot in the fast bowlers next over. He prodded forward to the next delivery and edged a straightforward chance which went in and out of Daren Gangas hands in the gully. 

One run later he padded up to a straight delivery but an impassioned appeal from the West Indies team was rejected by umpire Asad Rauf. 

The West Indies misery was complete when Collingwood mistimed a hook in Corey Collymores opening over but Taylor rushing in from deep mid-wicket misjudged the flight of the ball which sped over his shoulder to the boundary. 

Ian Bell took 37 minutes to get off the mark but from then on it was Englands day.

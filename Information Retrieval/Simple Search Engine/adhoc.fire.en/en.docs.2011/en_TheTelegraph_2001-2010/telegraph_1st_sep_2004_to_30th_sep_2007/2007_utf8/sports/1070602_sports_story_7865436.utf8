 Ive regained my rhythm: Pathan

Chennai: Out-of-favour seamer Irfan Pathan on Friday said that he has regained his rhythm and believes he is on the right track for a comeback to international cricket. 

Pathan, after his six-day training at the MRF Pace Foundation, from where he rose to the international arena, said: I am back to my usual bowling rhythm. You can see the light in my face. I am happy to come back to the academy to take corrective measures. 

Thanking T A Sekar, the chief coach at the academy, Pathan, who last played when the West Indies toured India, last January, said: I have been wanting to hone my skills under sir (Sekar) but I could not find time at a stretch for a week or more. 

Irfan felt he lost the rhythm during Indias Pakistan tour and took advice from many experts that failed to help him out. 

It took just two seconds for sir (Sekar) to tell me where I am going wrong. He worked on a few technical aspects of my bowling. 

From last Monday, I have been trying to make amends. I have been bowling with old, semi-old and new balls at the nets here. Sir will never have nice words but he is clear about what he says. Today, he told me that he was satisfied, Pathan said. 

Making clear that he was not complaining, Pathan said he had not been bowling with the new ball and so could not swing the ball as much as he used to. 

I had to work hard to get back to the team by proving myself in the domestic circuit. I am oozing with confidence to play competitive cricket after my stint here, he added. (PTI)

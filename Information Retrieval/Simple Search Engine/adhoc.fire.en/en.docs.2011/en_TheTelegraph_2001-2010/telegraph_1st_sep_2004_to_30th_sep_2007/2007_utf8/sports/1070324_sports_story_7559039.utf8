 Jeev at tied 38th

Miami: Jeev Milkha Singh ran into trouble on the last hole of the day as he double bogeyed to card two-over 74 and be tied at 38th place in the WGC-CA golf tournament on a windy day. 

Jeev was at par before he dropped two shots on the ninth hole, where he went into the greenside bunker from the tee. He left himself short as he went into the left rough and then reached the green in three. His bogey putt from nine feet stopped two inches short and he took a five. 

Henrik Stenson put himself in shared lead with a five-under 67 with Robert Allenby. 

Tiger Woods, who shot a 43 on the back nine of bayhill, shot a 71 in first round. Woods, playing with Allenby, hit the ball well but took 32 putts as the frustration mounted.

 Becks sits out again

 Beckham 

Foxborough: David Beckham once again sat out on the benches during the Los Angeles Galaxys 0-1 loss to the New England Revolution to rest his tender left ankle. 

Beckham has yet to start for the Galaxy since signing a five-year, $32.5m contract to leave one of Europes top leagues and give the sport a boost in the United States. He made his Major League Soccer debut on Thursday, but was back on the bench against New England on Sunday. 

Taylor Twellman scored in the 55th minute to give the Revolution a 1-0 victory in front of 35,402 fans. 

Los Angeles Galaxy coach Frank Yallop, however, is confident that Beckham will feature in Wednesdays SuperLiga game against DC United.

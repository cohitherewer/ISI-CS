 Ministers plea to Lara

Port of Spain: Trinidad and Tobago sports minister Roger Boynce wants Brian Lara to reconsider his decision to quit international cricket. 

Boynce told newsmen that he was startled by Laras decision to quit the game following the West Indies failure to reach the World Cup semis. 

I spoke with Brian a short while ago, and I have asked him to reconsider (his decision to retire from all forms of cricket), Boynes said. 

I have told Brian that when he comes to Trinidad and Tobago we will sit down and we will talk, he added. 

The minister also felt that it was wrong to single out Lara for the sides inability to reach the last four. (PTI)

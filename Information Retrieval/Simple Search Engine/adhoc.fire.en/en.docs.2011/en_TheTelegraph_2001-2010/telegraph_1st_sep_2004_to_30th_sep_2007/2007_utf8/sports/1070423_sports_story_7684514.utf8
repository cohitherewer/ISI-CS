 Fletcher seeks job

Bridgetown: Coach Duncan Fletcher highlighted on Sunday the frustrations and pleasures of his past eight years in the England job and said he was ready to step back into cricket immediately if possible. The 58-year-old Zimbabwean told a news conference that he was open for any coaching offer after his spell with England ended in disappointment and boos from fans with a second-round exit at the World Cup in the Caribbean. 

Asked when he would be ready to take on a new challenge, Fletcher answered: Tomorrow, I reckon. 

I do need a break. I probably need a month and then Im sure my wife will be trying to kick me out of the house. 

He said there had been no interest in his services yet despite vacancies in several leading cricketing nations, including Pakistan, but insisted he was not in danger of losing his inspiration. 

Ive got ideas, I think I can help, he said. I really feel that as far as coaching is concerned I am still forward-thinking, I can think out of the box. 

Fletcher, who tendered his resignation after Englands World Cup exit was sealed following a nine-wicket defeat by South Africa on Tuesday, said personal reasons had sparked the decision but did not elaborate. A 0-5 Ashes drubbing by Australia earlier in the season and the World Cup failure had left his position untenable. 

He felt his legacy, however, was safe. One thing you can say is that when I got the job not many people wanted it. Now everyones clamouring for it. So thats probably a good indication, he said. 

The highlight of his tenure from 1999 was a 2-1 Ashes home series win over Australia in 2005, Englands first success for 18 years. 

Fletcher guided them to second in the Test standings behind Australia but that success was not replicated in the one-day game. He said there were good reasons for that. (Reuters)

Calcutta: Ravi Shastris first day in office at the Eden on Wednesday was spent mainly in trying to get a first-hand knowledge of the players. The cricket manager for the Bangladesh tour kept a strict vigil from a distance as they went through the paces during the morning and afternoon sessions. 

Unlike Greg Chappells strict military-like workout, the former India captain was somewhat informal in his approach. It was clear he was gelling with the players. 

Dressed in black shorts and blue T-shirt, Shastri supervised every minute detail on the field. While fielding and bowling coaches Robin Singh and Venkatesh Prasad, respectively, went about their tasks, Shastri moved from one corner of the field to another. 

Sometimes he was shouting instructions, and on other occasions, he was attending to a player personally. The stars were also not left alone as he had a quiet word with Yuvraj Singh, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid after their net session. 

The stress was on short and sweet sessions, as the new team management would like to call them, in contrast to the long practice periods of the Chappell era. The morning session, restricted to fitness and fielding drills, lasted 90 minutes while the net session lasted around two-and-a-half hours. 

In the afternoon, the batsmen, after a net session, were made to bat in a match-like situation with fielders all around in the centre pitch which had more than a tinge of grass. The CAB has been requested to provide more fielders on Thursday. 

The fielding drills, overseen by trainer Gregory King and the fielding coach, left most of the players drained and gasping for breath. It also led to newcomers like Ishant Sharma vomitting on the turf. 

Administrative manager Surendra Bhave felt the players would not have any problem of dehydration in the hot and humid conditions. They are professionals. They know how to keep themselves hydrated. The coaching staff is also monitoring how the players are responding to the training, he said. 

The morning workout was followed by a pool session at the hotel. The cricket manager and captain, along with Robin and Prasad, then had a meeting with the players. Shastri stressed the enjoyment factor and urged the players to forget the past and live in the present. Do away with the World Cup defeat and its disappointment, was the message that was sent out. 

The team management also made it clear that individual feedback will be encouraged. It is likely that the players may have yoga session during the conditioning camp. 

Rookie Manoj Tiwary had a decent outing. The Bengal allrounder was impressive during fielding drills and did bat for a while at the nets. 

With the exception of V.V.S. Laxman and Dinesh Karthik, all players have joined the camp. Laxman has been unable to make it because of gastroenteritis while the just-married Karthik will join on Saturday. 

On Laxmans availability, Bhave said: It will all depend on how he recovers.

 Surgery reveals Symonds injury is serious

Melbourne: Australian allrounder Andrew Symonds shoulder-area injury is worse than first thought, putting him in doubt for the cricket World Cup following surgery, on Sunday. 

Australian physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said surgeons found the biceps tendon to be fully torn off the bone at the shoulder joint and reattached it using a screw. 

Symonds suffered the injury while batting during last Fridays loss to England in Sydney. 

Kountouris said the surgery went well, but the recovery time means Symonds will struggle to be fit in time for the World Cup, which begins mid-March in the Caribbean. 

Its going to be tough for the World Cup, Kountouris said. 

They tend to take a little bit of time to recover, but we are not really looking at that right now. 

We just want to see how it goes over the next couple of weeks. Theres no fixed time with any sort of surgery you do... So we are just going to look at it week by week. 

Were still aiming for him to be at the World Cup but were still just looking at where he is going to be in the next one to two weeks. 

Symonds, 31, has played 161 ODIs and starred in Australias 2003 World Cup win in South Africa.

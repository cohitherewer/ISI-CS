 Were all behind Sreesanth: Prasad

 - Indian pacer docked 50 per cent of match fee 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Nottingham: Were all behind Sreesanth... Hell get over this phase, Team Indias bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad told The Telegraph. 

Sreesanth has been docked 50 per cent of his match fee for inappropriate and deliberate physical contact with England captain Michael Vaughan on Monday, the fourth day of the second Test. 

According to a well-placed source, Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle and the on-field umpires (Simon Taufel, Ian Howell) had informally cautioned the speedster a few days ago. It had no effect. 

Sreesanth, who also bowled a beamer and a long no-ball, probably got away lightly as Mike Procter had been lenient when James Anderson did something similar (to Runako Morton) during the recent England-West Indies ODIs. 

Speaking at the Crowne Plaza on Tuesday morning, Prasad added: Weve been talking to Sreesanth and Ive had many one-on-ones with him... Hes young... Gets carried away... 

Prasad, who came on board earlier this summer (before the Bangladesh tour), lauded the Zaheer Khans for a special performance at Trent Bridge. 

All credit to the bowlers, particularly Zaheer... They were outstanding... I know they were criticised for being wayward in the opening session at Lords (first Test), but thats because they got overawed... After that, theyve been brilliant... 

Prasad added that the present bunch was highly gifted. I keep telling them that I didnt have their pace and didnt have their seam position... Thats their plus... However, I was tough in the mind and used that toughness... If they use their mind a bit more, theyll do better. 

For now, its time to celebrate.

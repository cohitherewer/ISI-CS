 Bernie savours duel

KEVIN GARSIDE

 Bernie Ecclestone 

Fuji: In Bernie Ecclestones dream sequence, the world championship goes to the wire in Brazil. Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso reprise the joust of seething titans Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost at Suzuka in 1990. Hamilton rams Alonso into a tyre wall, Senna-style, to become Formula Ones youngest world champion and the first rookie to take the crown. That is the kind of double first in history that F1s commercial rights holder Ecclestone prefers to deal in. 

In truth it is not critical to Ecclestones scheme who commits the sin, or which driver benefits. Controversy is good for business. Hamilton and Alonso are too bad to be true, and the F1 headlines have gone twice around the world in recent weeks. One media outlet in Canada was so excited by the $100 million sanction clamped on McLaren in the spygate drama that they invited Canadas foremost F1 correspondent on air to discuss the biggest fine in sport. Hey Gerry, tell us, said the announcer in a characteristic North American twang, what is Formula One? Ignorance is no impediment when a good story hits the wires. 

This was supposed to be the season that F1 reeled at the loss of Michael Schumacher. The cash till has no soul, the accounts no memory the Hamilton and Alonso show is packing them in. And Bernie is rubbing his hands. Could they really take each other off, unleash the devil like Senna and Prost? 

Yes, absolutely, Ecclestone said without hesitation. Like the $100 million fine, it would generate a lot of publicity. Surely the public would prefer a Corinthian duel, clean racing and may the best man win? No, it would be good. Imagine if that happened on the last lap of the last race. The guy who was leading at the time, points-wise, would be the winner. So it would be a controversial end. I think he (Fernando) tried to take him off (in Belgium). Well, it looked like it. 

Ecclestone was conducting an inspection of the Fuji shop floor on the return of the Japanese Grand Prix to the venue after 30 years. 

Fujis mystical properties brought out the mischievous best in Ecclestone. In keeping with his new status as a football club baron following his joint purchase with Flavio Briatore of Queens Park Rangers, Ecclestone indulged in a spot of transfer speculation. Alonso, he has been told, is off to Ferrari in 2009 after a year on gardening duty next season. 

Im told that is a possibility. It would be terrible (gardening leave) but there is nothing you can do about it. It might suit Ron (Dennis, McLaren team principal). Ron might say, Ill pay you but you cant drive for anyone else, like they do with the designers. 

Alonso insists his immediate future is with McLaren. Control, one suspects, remains in his hands only as long as he wins. Hamilton has other ideas.

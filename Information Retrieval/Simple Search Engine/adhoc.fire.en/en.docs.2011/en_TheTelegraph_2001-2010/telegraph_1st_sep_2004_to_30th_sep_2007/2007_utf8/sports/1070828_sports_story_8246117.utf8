The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Finally, BCCI puts it in black and white

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: All coaches/cricket managers of the Indian team so far have been former Test players. As the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) looks around for a full-time successor for Greg Chappell, itll be happy if someone who is only a first-class cricketer puts in an application. 

On Monday evening, the BCCI issued a release detailing the eligibility criteria and what it expects from the next coach. 

Besides requesting the media to do its bit, the BCCI has approached all the national cricket boards to put up its advertisement on their respective websites. 

The Board does not have a website of its own, hence the request. 

According to the release, the candidate should have excellent communication skills so that he can interact with the players, team management, selectors and the Board. 

The candidate must also have coached an international or national team or should have been a coach at an elite coaching centre of international repute.

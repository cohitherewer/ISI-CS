 India to host first world meet

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: India will host the first ever World Mixed U-21 Snooker Championship to be held in Goa from August 22-31. 

Following their successful bid, the International Billiards and Snooker Federation (IBSF) awarded the championship to India, the Billiards and Snooker Federation of India (BSFI) secretary C. Kapur said on Tuesday. 

Incidentally, the meet in Goa will be organised by the Billiards and Snooker Association of Maharashtra as Goa does not have an affiliation with the BSFI. Also Goa is yet to see a player representing state. 

But explains Kapur: That is the idea behind holding the meet in Goa to spread awareness about the game. Also, it was easier for us to rope in sponsors in Goa. 

About 30 countries, including favourites England, Wales and Thailand, will compete in the meet. Each country will have the option to field two teams. 

The mixed team will consist of three men and one woman. 

India, by the way, are struggling to field two teams. Reason: The talented bunch of Pankaj Adavani, Sourav Kothari are not eligible since they have crossed 21 years.

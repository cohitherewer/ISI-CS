 A look at the minnows

London: A round-up of news from minor nations competing at the World Cup in the West Indies starting next month. 

BERMUDA The smallest of the minor nations in the tournament are making their World Cup debut but have experience in their ranks thanks to 36-year-old batsman David Hemp, captain of Glamorgan in the English County championship. 

CANADA New Zealand-based batsmen Geoff Barnett and Ian Billcliff have been drafted into the World Cup squad with all rounders Don Maxwell and Sandeep Jyoti missing out. 

IRELAND The Irish, too, have stuck with the same 15 from the World Cricket League despite a disappointing performance in the minor nation competition where they finished fifth. 

SCOTLAND Their squad boasts former England one-day allrounders Dougie Brown and Gavin Hamilton. Coach Peter Drinnen is not overawed by the prospect of facing South Africa and Australia in group A. 

The NETHERLANDS The Dutch have also named the same squad from the World Cricket League for minor nations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We planned and executed well: Sachin

 - Were definitely going to take a lot of confidence from this win... We wont get over-confident 

 Sachin Tendulkar 

Maestro Sachin Tendulkar, who has been a member of the winning XI on a number of occasions, interacted with the media in Nottingham on Tuesday afternoon. 

The following are excerpts 

On the seven-wicket victory 

Its a very important win, a special win... Wed ourselves been expecting to do well after Lords... Because of the weather, we couldnt train outdoors, but worked hard indoors (in Loughborough)... We planned and executed well. 

On the confidence gained 

Were definitely going to take a lot of confidence from this win... We wont

 get over-confident. 

On MoM Zaheer Khan 

He was superb... Hed been complaining that he would get stuck on four wickets, wouldnt get the fifth. Yesterday, when he got the fifth, we were very happy for him... As hes

 the strike bowler, we expect him to get (big) wickets. 

On Zaheers controlled aggression 

That approach always delivers... If the aggression

 isnt controlled, then you could lose the plot... 

On Zaheer having been outraged and inspired by the jelly beans incident 

If jelly beans can inspire, then why not (have more)? 

On the middle-order having been criticised

 at Lords 

One failure doesnt make it bad... Weve

 been proving our worth for years... People should realise that any defeat is

 a defeat for the team, not one or two individuals... At the same time, any

 win is a win for the team... 

On whispers every now and then

 that the team isnt united 

That could be an opinion... The team has always been united. 

Finally, on having fallen for 91 in the first innings at Trent Bridge 

Thats past... Ive got to put it behind

 me and move on...

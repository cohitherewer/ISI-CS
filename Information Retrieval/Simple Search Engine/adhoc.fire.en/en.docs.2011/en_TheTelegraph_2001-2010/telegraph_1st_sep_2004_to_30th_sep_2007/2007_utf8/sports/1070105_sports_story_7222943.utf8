The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Asia Cup likely in May 08

Karachi: The 2008 Asia Cup cricket tournament is likely to be postponed again as India have still not confirmed their participation for the continental event. 

The Asia Cup is scheduled from April 17 next year but could be pushed back for another two weeks because the dates are clashing with Indias proposed tour of Australia, media reports said on Thursday. 

If India confirmed their participation, the regional event could be held in the first week of May 2008, Altaf was quoted as saying by a Pakistan newspaper. (PTI)

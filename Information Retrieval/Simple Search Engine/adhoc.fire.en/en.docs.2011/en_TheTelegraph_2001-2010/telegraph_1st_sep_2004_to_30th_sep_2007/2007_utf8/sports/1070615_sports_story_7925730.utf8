Calcutta: Understandably, theres euphoria in plenty on the Maidan over Ranadeb Boses selection for the Test squad. The question, of course, is to what extent he will be able to make the most of the opportunity which comes his way in England. 

On Thursday, The Telegraph spoke to former Bengal coach Paras Mhambrey as also Barun Burman and Dattatreya Mukherjee on Ranadebs strengths and weaknesses. This is what they had to say: 

BARUN BURMAN 

Boses strengths: What separates Ranadeb from the other current Indian bowlers is his ability to maintain a probing line and length even with the old ball. May be, only Zaheer Khan is slightly ahead of him in this regard, but this quality always makes the bowler special. He can also bowl long spells and generate late swing. The experience of playing in England will hold Ranadeb in good stead in the upcoming series. He is aware of the conditions there and its going to be a huge advantage for him. 

Boses weaknesses: I dont see any glaring weakness. People talk about his lack of pace. But speed is not the only characteristic of a pace bowler. Had it been so, I wouldve made the national cut as well. Ranadebs accuracy is good enough to overcome such things. 

PARAS MHAMBREY 

Strengths: Ranadeb is a keen learner of the game. He has improved himself drastically in the last couple of seasons, meticulously following a strict fitness regime. Hes now enjoying the fruits of his labour. What has pleased me most is the way he puts his hand up and accepts the challenge. We missed Shib Shankar Paul due to injury almost throughout the last season, but Ranadeb took up the added responsibility and shouldered the job of being the main bowler brilliantly. It was thanks to his performance we did so well. 

Apart from being accurate, he can bowl tirelessly. This shows he is now conscious of his fitness. He also bowls at a nagging line in and around the off-stump and it can be his key weapon in English conditions. 

Weaknesses: Ranadeb works within his limits. He is a safe fielder to me, but I still feel he needs to work a bit more on it. True, you cant have 11 Jonty Rhodes in the field but modern cricket demands every player has to be a superb athlete. 

DATTATREYA MUKHERJEE 

Strengths: Ranadebs bowling reflects his passion for the game. Apart from the ability to bowl at a stretch, he can also swing the ball either way. What also interests me is the way he plans a delivery. Bowling to a particular field setting is not an easy job and Ranadeb seems to have mastered that art. 

Weaknesses: There are a few minor technical flaws and Im sure he will rectify them as he progresses. He doesnt often use his non-bowling arm. Plus, his hand rotation speed is also on the slower side while delivering a ball. This is one reason why he lacks pace.

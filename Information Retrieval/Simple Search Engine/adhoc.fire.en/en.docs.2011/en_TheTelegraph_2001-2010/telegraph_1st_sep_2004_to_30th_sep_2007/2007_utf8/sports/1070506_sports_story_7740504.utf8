The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Laxman advised to stay at home

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 VVS Laxman 

Calcutta: V.V.S. Laxman had booked himself on the first flight from Hyderabad on Saturday morning, but was advised by Team India physio John Gloster to stay put and gradually build up. 

It was on Friday afternoon that my doctors gave the all-clear to travel... Accordingly, I called (cricket manager) Ravi Shastri and Gloster... As the conditioning camp would end on Sunday, I was advised to gradually build up in Hyderabad itself, Laxman told The Telegraph. 

Laxman, who has only been selected for the two-Test series in Bangladesh, couldnt report here on Tuesday after becoming a gastro victim. 

My infant son (Sarvajit) too had gastro... I really struggled for a couple of days... Wed done quite a bit of travelling last week and caught the infection during one of our trips... My son, in fact, also had very high fever, he added. 

Fortunately, wife Sailaja didnt fall ill.

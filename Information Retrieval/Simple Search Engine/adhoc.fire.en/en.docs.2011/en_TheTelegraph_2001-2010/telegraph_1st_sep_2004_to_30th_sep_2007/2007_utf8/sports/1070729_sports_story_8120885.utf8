 Prasun panel sweeps polls

 - Amitava Banerjee, Samar Paul to be joint secretaries 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Prasun Mukherjees panel swept the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) elections at the 76th annual general meeting on Saturday. Amitava Banerjee and Samar Paul were elected joint secretaries while Tushar Sarkar clinched the treasurers post. 

Paul, who emerged victorious in his eighth attempt, polled the maximum 80 votes in a 118-strong electorate (one member was absent). Incumbent Banerjee retained his position with 57 votes. Favourite Saradindu Pal crashed to his worst defeat managing only 40 votes. The other Jagmohan Dalmiya-backed candidate, Biswarup Dey was third at 50. 

Sarkar defeated Shiv Kumar Kalyani by 68-50 votes. 

Dalmiyas blessings mattered little. So did personal equations and the prospect of cross-voting. What stood out in the end was Mukherjees charisma. 

This is a reward for my good work during the past six months. I hope to carry on in the same manner during my first full tenure as the CAB chief, a contented Mukherjee said. 

Besides his trusted vote bank, Paul managed to garner support from the crucial district voters and various splinter groups including the third front. A few members even resorted to voting for a single candidate for the two joint secretaries posts. 

A victory of transparency over vested interests, was how an emotional Paul described his win. 

A visibly upset Dey couldnt hide his frustration. Things could have been a lot different had Dalmiya been a little more active this time. Only if he had led from the front he lamented. 

A veteran member put it down well. Even a lesser-known Sarkar, who doesnt command much influence and will draw a blank if he is to fight on his own, managed 68 votes. 

This election proves that Mukherjee has developed his own support bank and can survive without the administrations backing. His rivals will struggle to make a dent in his vote bank in future. 

Only time will tell if this election will mark the beginning of a new era at the helm of Bengal cricket.

 Kapil advice for India players

London: Kapil Dev feels that Indian players should not lose sleep over the absence of a full-time coach and lift their game themselves. 

Kapil said the team has gone through a tough phase which included the World Cup flop show, and the players needed to lift their game irrespective of whether they have a full-time coach or not. 

Its a responsibility they have. They have to lift the team, Kapil said. There have been too many problems about who should be coach or manager. 

But the players should not have to look up to other people. You look to yourselves and say we are the ones who have to lift the team and win. 

Since Greg Chappell resigned after the World Cup, Team India has been without a full-time coach. Ravi Shastri was appointed cricket manager for the Bangladesh tour and Chandu Borde succeeded Shastri for the ongoing UK tour. (PTI)

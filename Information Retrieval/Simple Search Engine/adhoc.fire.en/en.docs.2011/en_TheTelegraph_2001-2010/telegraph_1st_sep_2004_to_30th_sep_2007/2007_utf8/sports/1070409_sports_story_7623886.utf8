The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We have proved our point: Bashar

Georgetown: Captain Habibul Bashar said Bangladesh had made a statement to the cricket world after his teams shock World Cup victory over top-ranked South Africa on Saturday. 

Bangladesh, ranked ninth in the 11-team world standings, racked up their World Cup record total of 251 for 8 and then bowled out a dispirited South Africa for just 184 to claim their first points in the second-stage Super Eight with a 67-run win. 

The Bangladeshis have registered occasional upsets in previous matches but skipper Bashar suggested this win was the best because it came in the latter stage of a World Cup. This is pretty big, Bashar said. Every win is important for Bangladesh but this win is more important. 

We always have belief we can play good cricket. We always believe we came in Super Eight because we had done something good in first round. But we needed to prove ourselves as well that we can play at this level. 

We wanted to show when we came into the Super Eight that we were not there just to make the numbers up. We wanted to win points. We now have a chance for the semi-finals but we need to work really hard, Bashar said. 

Having heavily lost to defending champions Australia and fancied New Zealand already, and with games approaching against England, Ireland and the West Indies, Bangladeshs chances of making the last four would appear slim, but at least they can now hope. 

South Africa had beaten Sri Lanka and World Cup debutants Ireland before this game and their passage to the semi-finals, which had seemed inevitable, is now quite uncertain. They have four points and Bangladesh have two. 

Bashar praised Aftab Ahmed and Mohammed Ashraful for their fearless approach to the South African attack after the duo shared a fifth-wicket stand of 76. 

Man-of-the-match Ashraful dominated the innings with his 87 from 83 balls, Aftab also played his part with a crucial 35 off 43. 

Ashraful played a wonderful innings for us and Aftab was a really important player for us too, Bashar said. But we want him (Aftab) to get an 80 or a 90 rather than a brilliant 30 or 40. 

Bangladesh will fly out of Guyana for their next match with England in Barbados on Wednesday. 

Bashar was not surprised that South Africa didnt use a spinner in Saturdays game. 

Im not sure they made a mistake. This wicket is a bit slow for sure. But they probably thought that we are good players of spin thats why they took fast bowlers, he said. 

The Bangladesh skipper believed the support of fans back home was always consistent even when they did not do so well against Australia and New Zealand. 

Bashar believed the celebrations among boys would not be as big as it was against India because they are beginning to get familiar with victories. 

It would not be like India. That was the beginning. Celebrations have started but its down a little bit because we are getting familiar with victories, Bashar said. (Agencies)

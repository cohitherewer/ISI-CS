 Umpires may suffer burn-out: Shepherd

London: Former Test umpire David Shepherd has expressed serious concerns over the shrinking elite panel, saying it could cause burn-out among top-level officials. 

Shepherds concern came in the wake of Mark Benson suffering heart palpitations at Kingsmead just 20 minutes after the start of play during the second Test between India and South Africa, and spending two nights in intensive care in a Durban hospital. 

The 48-year-old Benson, who was standing in his third match within a month, was appointed to the elite panel in April this year and was officiating in his 14th Test, since the sacking of Darrell Hair reduced the ICC elite umpires panel to nine. 

It is tough for the players because they are playing high-grade cricket all the time and careers will not last as long as they did. I can see the same thing happening with umpires. There will be burn-out, Shepherd said. 

The guys are under so much scrutiny. Television is so good these days and so intrusive. There are 20 cameras at a game and that puts the umpires under so much pressure, he was quoted as saying by a local newspaper on Sunday. 

Shepherd, who retired in June last year after standing in 92 Tests, said there was a need to expand the panel, but felt ICC would not back the move because of the cost.

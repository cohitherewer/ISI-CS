 Sri Lanka confident of stopping the Aussie juggernaut

Sri Lanka meet Australia on Monday 

St Georges: Sri Lanka will enjoy conditions equivalent to a home match in Mondays World Cup Super Eight clash with world champions Australia under a hot sun on a slow pitch at the Grenada National Stadium. 

Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene says his sides self-belief means they can do what no other team has managed since the 1999 World Cup beat Australia. 

The reigning champions, chasing an unprecedented third successive title, have gone 25 games unbeaten at the World Cup since losing to Pakistan at Headingley eight years ago, a sequence that includes their famous tied semi-final against South Africa in 1999. 

Australias nine-wicket thrashing of Ireland on Friday was their 19th straight World Cup win and meant they became the first team in the Caribbean to qualify for the semi-finals. 

But Sri Lanka, despite being without injured fast bowler Lasith Malinga, beat fellow title contenders New Zealand by six wickets on Thursday and Jayawardene cannot wait for Mondays Super Eight fixture at the Grenada National Stadium. 

I think we have a very good record against them, said Jayawardene. Why? because we play our brand of cricket and we are not afraid of doing that. 

Malinga, who had been the tournaments leading bowler until his injury with 15 wickets, turned his arm over in the nets on Saturday for 15 minutes before having his injured left ankle heavily strapped. 

The 23-year-old, whose unorthodox action makes him difficult for batsmen to pick up, hasnt played against Australia and Jayawardene admitted there was a case for keeping him hidden until a possible meeting with Ricky Pontings side in either the semi-finals or final. 

Thats one way to look at it but there are so many other ways to look at it, Jayawerdene said. Sri Lanka need one more win from their two Super Eight matches they play Ireland on Wednesday to be certain of a semi-final spot and Jayawardene said it was vital the likes of 1996 World Cup-winning bowlers Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah Muralidharan maintained their recent form. 

Australia are getting good starts and there hasnt been that much emphasis on their middle-order so thats one area well be thinking about, he explained. Theyve got a good balanced bowling attack as well. 

Sri Lankas last one-day win against Australia, in Adelaide in January 2006 saw Tillekeratne Dilshan involved in four run-outs of home batsmen. 

Meanwhile, Australia quick Glenn McGrath said opener Sanath Jayasuriya, whose dynamic batting played a major role in Sri Lankas World Cup triumph 11 years ago, was a key target. 

There is no doubt he is a great player and wed like to get on top of him early and knock him over, said McGrath, on the losing side in the 1996 final. 

From what weve seen, the pitch in Grenada is slower and takes some turn. It will be a big test for us and probably suit Sri Lanka. 

McGrath, the World Cups leading bowler of all-time with 63 wickets, said that Australias lack of a close game in the Caribbean wouldnt be an issue as the World Cup neared its conclusion. 

The next two weeks for us is the showcase time for the whole tournament, and our senior players, who have been in World Cups before, I think thats when youll see them stand up and start enjoying the tournament for what it is.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We lost ground: Deep

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Everything depends on Day III. 

Both the captains Deep Dasgupta and Yere Goud didnt want to comment on the possible outcome, only offering lets see, by way of comments. 

We have to look forward to the first two sessions and then proceed accordingly, was what Dasgupta had to say. His Karnataka counterpart said: We have to wait till the end of the third day to see which way the match is going. 

The Bengal captain, though, looked dejected, admitting that they have lost some advantage. 

To some extent they have recovered but still the match is wide open and if our bowlers stick to their tasks on Thursday, we can have another twist, Dasgupta said. 

Dasgupta also admitted that his bowlers didnt have a good outing. You cannot expect the same form everyday They were struggling a bit, but once they regain their rhythm, it will be different story, Dasgupta stated.

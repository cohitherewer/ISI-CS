The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bosman in trouble

A STAFF REPORTER 

 Andre Nel will replace Loots Bosman 

Calcutta: Loots Bosman, the South African opener who was withdrawn because of injury from the ICC World Twenty20 squad, was Wednesday charged by Cricket South Africa (CSA) on allegations that he breached the Rules and Code of Conduct. 

The allegations arose from comments attributed to him in an article on Wednesday. 

Bosman will appear before CSAs disciplinary commissioner, Advocate Michael Kuper. 

According to a CSA release, fast bowler Andr Nel will replace Bosman in the squad. The tournament starts in Johannesburg next week. Nels inclusion is subject to the approval of the ICC technical committee. 

Nel will join the Proteas training camp in Potchefstroom as soon as possible to enable him to participate fully in the preparation phase. 

Explaining the selection of a bowler to replace a batsman, selection convener Joubert Strydom commented: The Twenty20 squad was selected before the tour of Zimbabwe and, as most critics have mentioned, the bowling department looked a bit under-done and we feel that this is the area that needed to be strengthened. 

We are well stocked in the top three batting department with five players all technically equipped to deal with the new ball.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Somdev among future stars 

A CORRESPONDENT

 Somdev Dev Varman 

Mumbai: Indians have the talent but they must be able to convert their junior potential into success on the senior international stage. This is the esteemed opinion of a couple of tennis veterans who shared their views on the subject with The Telegraph, based on the showing of a posse of young talents in the preliminary rounds of the ongoing Kingfisher Airlines Open at the CCI tennis courts here. 

Akash Wagh, Rohan Gajjar, Navdeep Singh, Yuki Bhambri, Cristopher Marquis, Stephen Amritraj, Tushar Liberhan, Vivek Shokeen, Karan Rastogi, Purav Raja, Somdev Dev Varman are some familiar names on the Indian circuit who were seen in action here ever since the qualifiers started last Saturday. And some made a good impression despite being ousted prematurely from the fray. 

The 22-year-old Varman from Chennai, the US collegiate champion, who got a wild card into the main singles draw, 2006 national singles and doubles champion Mumbais Raja, 21, (who made the main draw as a lucky loser despite losing his third round qualifying match against Toshihide Matsui 7-6, 4-6, 3-6 on Tuesday) and 15-year-old prodigy from New Delhi, Bhambri, have been shortlisted as some youngsters with a bright future. 

We have the talent, no question about that. The question is to convert junior success into success at the senior level, former Asia Cup stalwart-turned-coach, Sandeep Kirtane, opined here on Tuesday. Kirtane cited the example of Rohan Bopanna who he felt should figure much higher than 245 in the ATP list given the talent running through his Coorgi veins. 

Yuki is our biggest talent for sure. Navdeep Singh (he also qualified for the main draw) is pretty good and Purav (last years national singles and doubles champion who is incidentally coached by Kirtane himself) too is doing well. And Kyra Shroff is our biggest genius among the girls, she will go far Kirtane, who hails from Pune, stated. 

But he qualified that statement by adding that the youngsters would have to get fitter as this aspect is of vital import in todays times. Further, they would have to possess great self-belief to scoot up the rankings ladder: Getting further is a matter of self belief. They will have to set goals and then work hard towards achieving them. 

CGK Bhupathi, father of Mahesh, and a canny coach and talent spotter himself, feels that of all the youngsters in the running, Varman has got the stuff to go the distance. He thinks the young lad possesses even more potential than his son and Leander Paes did in their youth. He has already worked on his game and the results are showing, he said. 

The next big hopeful, says Bhupathi Sr, is Bhambri. I see a lot of talent in him. But he will have to beef up his body and develop power in his shots which is not enough now, he pointed out. And last but not the least according to the Bangalore stalwart, there is Akash Wagh, incidentally a Bhupathi Academy protg, who was given a wild card last year while going down fighting to Italian veteran Davide Sanguinetti in the second round of the qualifiers this time. 

While Kirtane feels that coaching and infrastructural facilities are good enough in India to achieve the desired results and there is no need to go abroad, Raja, his ward, doesnt think alike. 

It would be definitely better if we train abroad as we do not have the facilities here there are very few centres with all requisite facilities in one place. But I am not blaming anyone for it, Raja, who lived in England in his early days, said Raja, who turned pro in January 2006 and is currently ranked in the 800s, also makes it a point to play down the hype associated with some teenage talents, like Bhambri. 

The important point is to see where these 15-18 year-olds land when theyre 18-21. There are so many world champions at the junior level and weve had quite a few of them ourselves but how many have realised their talents? he asked.

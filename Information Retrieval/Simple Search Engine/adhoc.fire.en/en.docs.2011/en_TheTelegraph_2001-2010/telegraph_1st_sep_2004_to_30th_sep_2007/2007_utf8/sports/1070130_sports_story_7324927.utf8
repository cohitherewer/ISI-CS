San Diego: Tiger Woods carved out another slice of history with a two-shot victory at the Buick Invitational on Sunday, his seventh consecutive title on the PGA Tour and the 55th of his career. 

Only fellow American Byron Nelson, with an astonishing run of 11 victories in 1945, has a superior winning streak on the worlds biggest circuit. 

Two strokes off the pace at the start of the day, Woods eagled the par-five ninth on his way to a six-under-par 66 and a fifth triumph in 10 starts at Torrey Pines. 

The world No.1 also rattled up five birdies and one bogey to finish on 15-under 273, one ahead of compatriot Charles Howell III (68). 

PGA Tour rookie Brandt Snedeker, surprise leader for the first three rounds, birdied the last for a 71 and third place at 12 under. 

Overall, I was very lucky to be on top there, Woods said after winning the title for the third year in a row. 

A lot of guys had a chance up there but somehow I was able to stick it out at the end. I played pretty aggressive on that back nine, for me, and just happened to come out on top. 

As far as how special seven (in a row) is, youre in elite company, added Woods, who was making his first appearance on the 2007 PGA Tour this week. 

Theres only one person thats ahead of you. Hes one of the greatest legends in the history of the game. To be in company like that with Mr. Nelson is pretty special. 

Four players held at least a share of the lead on the last day before the tournament was effectively decided over 10 gripping minutes, midway through the back nine. 

Australian rookie Andrew Buckle, two ahead at 15 under, fell back with a double-bogey at the 12th, where he missed the fairway to the right off the tee and overshot the green with his third shot. 

Jeff Quinney, tied for the lead with Buckle and Woods at 13 under, ran up a double-bogey six on 14 after finding a bunker with his approach and taking two more strokes to reach the green.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ill be looking for a strike-rate of at least 100

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni on the forthcoming World Cup 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Mahendra Singh Dhoni may have lost his No.1 spot in the ICCs ODI rankings for batsmen, but the 25-year-old remains among the most explosive of willow-wielders. A match-winner, too. The other evening, Dhoni briefly spoke to The Telegraph about the forthcoming World Cup, which will be his first. 

Following are excerpts 

On whether, like the rest of the country, even he has begun to focus on crickets showpiece event 

No... It has to be one at a time and, for now, our concern is this series against Sri Lanka. Its a good team and whether its them or us, the battle is for momentum leading into the World Cup... Moreover, as Ive already told you, I live in the present... I neither keep going back to the past nor do I look to tomorrow and beyond. It keeps life simple. 

On the three things he would like to achieve in the World Cup 

(Laughs) Well... 

 Would definitely like to keep well... In years to come, people should remember that I did a good job... 

 Would like to make the most of opportunities with the bat... The batting-order could be flexible and, so, Ive got to cash in on whatever position Im asked to bat... Ill be looking for a strike-rate of at least 100... 

 Would like teammates to appreciate that I was always the team man... Individuals do play a big role, but success is driven by team men and a collective effort... (After a pause) Hopefully, Ill enjoy this trip to the West Indies. 

On whether the enjoyment was missing on the last tour (May-July 2006) 

We lost the one-dayers, so there was no fun... We did win the Test series, though... Frankly, I didnt enjoy the tour so much... With similar beaches and more or less the same type of hotels, it had often been boring. 

On the experience gained there last year 

Of course, it will definitely help... We know that the wickets will be on the slower side and the bounce pretty low... It will call for a lot of application, whether Im batting or standing behind the stumps... It would be nice if the wickets had some life, but I dont think the nature can change in eight-nine months. 

On whether he intends packing something special in his West Indies-bound kit bag 

(Laughs again) Im not superstitious... Nothing at this moment, but I could if something takes a fancy between now and when we leave (February 28)... 

On whether theres one World Cup match which comes to mind instantly 

The 2003 final... 

On the luck factor in ODIs 

Plays a big role... But more than luck and anything else, its the quality and intensity of cricket on the day which matters... That separates the winner from the loser. 

Finally, on the excitement of being weeks away from becoming a World Cupper 

My first World Cup will be special, yes, but I wont be overawed by the occasion... Not that I allow pressure to get to me but, that way, it will be less. As a team, we must not begin to think about the knockout stage (from the Super Eight) even before weve played our first match.

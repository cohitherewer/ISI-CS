The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Trust hopes to start with 2 m

 - Patron Prince Charles to be present at tomorrows ODI 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Prince Charles 

Glasgow: The terrorists audacious strike at the international airport here notwithstanding, Tuesdays Indo-Pak ODI remains on track. 

Besides adding a special chapter to the Ashes-like rivalry, the match will launch the British Asian Trust (Bat), which is going to have Prince Charles patronage. The heir to the British throne already supports 17 charities. 

Prince Charles, by the way, will be present during the first Indo-Pak ODI in 15 months. 

With both boards (India and Pakistan) donating the TV revenue, we expect to start with something in excess of 2 million... Were delighted with the gesture, Bats chairman-designate, India-born businessman Manoj Badale, told The Telegraph. 

Speaking from London before setting out for the Princess Diana Memorial concert in Wembley, on Sunday, he added: Actually, Saturdays incident in Glasgow has only reinforced that much needs to be done where community cohesion in the UK is concerned... 

That, indeed, is one of our objectives... Others being (a) sustainable development in the poorer regions of India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh and (b) focussing on education in those areas. 

According to Badale, Bat is going to look at supporting charities back in Bengal. Im scheduled to visit Calcutta in November... Identifying the charities will take up much of my time... 

Two top executives Salman Amin (Pepsi) and Rajan Singh (Sony) are on Bats board. Businessman Chris Matthias as well. 

Once Bat starts to roll, Badale and Co. intend working out other fund-raisers. Given Prince Charles association, it wont be a tough ask. 

Footnote: The airport-strike raised security concerns, but the authorities are confident everything is going to go off smoothly weather permitting, that is. Flights have resumed, but the chaos isnt yet a thing of the past. The fear factor is there too.

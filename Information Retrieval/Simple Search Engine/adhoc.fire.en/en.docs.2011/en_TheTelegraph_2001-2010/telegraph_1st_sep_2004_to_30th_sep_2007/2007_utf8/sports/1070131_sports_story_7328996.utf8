The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Md. Sp. keen on learning a few tricks

 -Tie vs Sao Paulo

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jamshedpur: Mohammedan 

 Sporting is keen to learn new tricks from Sao Paulo than 

 actually make an impression in the second Super Soccer tie 

 versus Sao Paulo. The match is scheduled here on Wednesday. 

 Mohammedan Sporting coach Subhas 

 Bhowmick said as much on match eve. We have no strategy 

 for the match. I have told my boys to use the opportunity 

 and learn from the match. Sao Paulo is technically far more 

 superior. Its the best foreign team to visit India 

 in recent times. 

 He said that his team would play 

 in a 3-5-2 formation and would take things as they come. 

 The visitors, who earlier defeated East Bengal 3-0 in the 

 opening tie, look set to call the shots here. The mood in 

 the camp seemed positive and the captain said his team spent 

 time in adjusting to the conditions in Siliguri but things 

 would be different here. Well certainly like 

 to increase the margin from the earlier one, he said. 

 The Brazilians will be adopting 

 an attacking strategy while sticking to the traditional 

 4-4-2. Team coach Antonio Carlos da Silva said Pablo Gomes 

 De Matos and Caiuby Francisco da Silva would be playing.

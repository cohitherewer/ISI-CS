 Prakash beats Karan again

New Delhi: Prakash Amritraj maintained his stranglehold over Karan Rastogi, routing him for the third consecutive time in the final to complete a hattrick of ITF Futures titles on Saturday. 

In a completely one-sided encounter, which lasted barely an hour, Prakash displayed an array of shots as he outplayed the top seed 6-3, 6-1 to emerge winner for the third week in a row in the $ 10,000 event.

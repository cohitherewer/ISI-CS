 AS Roma lift Italian Cup

 Totti celebrates the Cup triumph on Thursday 

Milan: AS Roma won the Italian Cup on Thursday after a 1-2 defeat at holders Inter Milan gave them a 7-4 aggregate victory. Inter, who have missed out on a second successive league and cup double, produced a spirited display but Romas extraordinary 6-2 victory in last weeks first leg proved too much. 

Roberto Mancinis side had defeated Roma in the previous two finals but will have to make do with the league championship this season. 

In-form Argentine striker Hernan Crespo arched his neck to score with a delightful header from Maicons cross early in the second period to give the home side the lead. 

Substitute Julio Cruz, who entered the fray in the first half for the injured Patrick Vieira, then slid in Luis Figos pass on 56 minutes to spark hopes of an improbable comeback. 

But it was never really on and the frustration boiled over for Mancini, who was sent from the dugout for protesting midway through the second half. 

He tried to direct the team from the stands but any chance of a sensational turnaround evaporated when Inter defender Ivan Cordoba was sent off for a handball having received his first booking after just two minutes of the San Siro clash. 

Roma then twisted the knife when Simone Perrotta turned in Francesco Tottis cross-shot seven minutes from time. 

Right back Christian Panucci was dismissed for pulling back Inters Alvaro Recoba in injury time but nothing could take the gloss off the win for Roma, who finished second to Inter in the league. 

Roma captain Totti proudly held the Cup aloft only four days after the birth of his second child, Chanel.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Our club structure needs a big push

FREE-KICK

 P.K.Banerjee

 Blatters views on Indian football sounded very dramatic and got wide publicity in the media. But truth to tell, none of his observations was news to those who run the sport or are closely associated with it.

 Who doesnt know that our infrastructure is archaic? Who doesnt know that we are years behind the top Asian level and are not even in a position to compare our standard with the best in the world?

 Despite all this knowledge, we have not been able to arrest the slide. Simply because our attitude towards sport is flawed. Somebody like Blatter needed to announce to the world why Indian football is in doldrums. If this doesnt shake our system up, nothing ever will.

 At the outset, let me say that there are no quick-fix solutions. The problems are far too deep-rooted to even think of changing the scenario overnight. So the last thing we should do is act in haste. For example, I dont think gunning for Das Munshis head can be part of the solution.

 Now that we have got a special grant, we must make sure we spend it judiciously. The need of the hour is to prioritise the key areas and address those immediately.

 Focusing on the grassroots level, organising long-term junior camps and identifying special talents to be nurtured with care have got to be given importance. But these are all long-term programmes, with an eye on the future. To take care of the present and the immediate future, we have to give our club system a big push.

 There is no doubt in my mind that clubs are the backbone of any countrys football edifice. Indian football cannot prosper unless we can ensure healthy and stable state of our club sides.

 Unfortunately, most of our clubs are run by people who think professionally but act amateurishly. Those in Bengal love clinging on to the glorious past, taking the future for granted.

 That is not the case in Goa, which is the most forward-thinking state as far as football is concerned. Its not difficult to see why Goa have been doing so well over a long p eriod of time and threatening to leave Bengal way behind.

 The AIFF obviously has a big role to play in shaping the ideal club structure. The best way to do it is for Das Munshi and his team to prepare a blueprint for the top clubs and then distribute grants with conditions attached. 

 The AIFF has to be very firm, and tell the clubs the money has to be spent to meet certain goals. There has to be regular monitoring by the national federation as well.

 The AIFF, on its part, cant just depend on the Fifa and AFC to bail it out monetarily all the time. Das Munshi must build up a team of his own which will be able to persuade the big corporates to support the game. Better still, if prospective buyers can be found to take over some of our better clubs.

 Clubs like Chelsea and Liverpool have transformed English football after their takeover by billionaires from overseas. Why cant something similar be tried in our country? It may sound wishful thinking at this moment, but whats the harm in giving it a serious try? Thats the challenge for the AIFF.

 We have to be practical in our pursuit, but we also have to think big.

 Bowling woes haunt India

Durban: India will have to sort out their bowling woes as they go into the must-win Super Eight match against England on Wednesday, fully aware that any slip-up would dash their semi-final hopes in the ICC World Twenty20. 

After beating Pakistan in a thriller at Kingsmead via bowlout, India lost to New Zealand at Wanderers by 10 runs. And now, Mahendra Singh Dhonis side must win their last two games against England and South Africa to stay alive in the tournament. 

On their part, England too went down to South Africa in their first game of the second round before bouncing back in style at Kingsmead by beating New Zealand. 

Ajit Agarkars indifferent form with the ball puts a big question mark on him. 

Leg-spinner Piyush Chawla has a good record against England while the likes of Yusuf Pathan or Rohit Sharma can shore up the batting. 

England definitely had more balance and depth and even more experience of playing Twenty20, with players like Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff in their ranks. 

Given the bouncy nature of the wicket, Flintoff will look to strike some telling blows to cripple the Indian batting along with James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Dimitri Mascarenhas.

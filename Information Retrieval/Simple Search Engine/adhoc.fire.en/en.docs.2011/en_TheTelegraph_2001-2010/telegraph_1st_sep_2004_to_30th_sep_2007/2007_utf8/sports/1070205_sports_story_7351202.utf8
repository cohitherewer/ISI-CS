 Not thinking about target, says Deep

Mumbai: Bengal captain Deep Dasgupta was a worried man post-Day III. 

Batting on 43, the need of the hour for the skipper is to play a sheet-anchor role and stay on the crease. We are not thinking about the target, were only focusing on the time left. We have enough time to score those runs, but for that we need to keep our wickets intact, Deep said about their plan on the fourth day morning. 

With opener Subhomo Das giving way to Sourav Ganguly in the Ranji Trophy final, Deep felt that the onus to open the innings was on him. As a captain, I always love to lead from the front, said Deep adding that he would like his bat to do the talking. 

What irked Deep however was the unlucky dismissal of Avishek Jhunjhunwala. The stylish right-hander, it may be noted, was a victim of umpires misjudgement. Refusing to comment on the umpires decision, Deep said: You all have seen it but, at the moment, I dont want to think about anything else rather than surviving the remaining two days. 

Sourav, who skipped the practice session after the days play, felt in similar manner. I cant say about the outcome, there are still two days left. But lets see, Sourav told The Telegraph. He however admitted that the wicket was turning a bit. 

Having dismissed Sachin Tendulkar thrice, Bengal off-spinner Sourashish Lahiri appeared in a joyous mood, though he didnt wish to talk much. It feels really nice but I will only think of this if we can win the match, otherwise this does not have any significance. 

At the moment, what Bengal are looking forward to is to survive the Zaheer Khan-Ajit Agarkar fury in the first session on Monday.

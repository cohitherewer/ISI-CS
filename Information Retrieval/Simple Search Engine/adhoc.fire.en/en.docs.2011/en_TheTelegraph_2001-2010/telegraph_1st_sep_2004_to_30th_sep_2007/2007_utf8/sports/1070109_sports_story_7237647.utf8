Madrid: Injury-depleted Barcelona FC failed to move back into first place in the Primera Liga after being held to a 1-1 draw at Getafe. 

The defending champions, who needed a 70th-minute equaliser from Xavi Hernandez to earn the point, stayed in second place, two points behind Sevilla but with a game in hand. 

Barcelona played without eight regulars, including the suspended Ronaldinho and the injured Samuel Eto, for its opening game of 2007. 

Getafe took the lead at Alfonso Perez Stadium in the 54th minute when striker Daniel Guiza Gonzalez took advantage of defender Rafael Marquezs weak back pass. 

Xavi, taking a free-kick in Ronaldinhos absence, levelled for the visitors by curling his shot home from the edge of the area. 

Getafe, which had defender Alexis Ruano ejected in the 90th minute, put Barcelona under severe pressure at times but stayed winless in seven matches. 

Also on Sunday, Real Betis defeated Celta Vigo 1-0, Recreativo Huelva edged Espanyol by an identical margin, Levante won over Racing Santander 2-0 and Athletic Bilbao outplayed Mallorca 3-1. 

Sevilla leads the league with 37 points, while Barcelona has 35. Real Madrid follows with 32 points, two more than Zaragoza. 

Matches were preceded by sombre music as a mark of respect for two Ecuadoreans who were killed on December 30 in a car bombing at Madrid Airport. The attack was blamed on Basque Separatist Group ETA. 

Valencia moved up to fifth after a fourth straight win over a disappointing Villarreal who have now lost three in a row. 

Betis brought new coach Luis Fernandez a victory in his first game in charge. Brazilian forward Rafael Sobis, who joined Betis from Copa Libertadores champion Internacional in the off season, scored the winning goal in the 60th. Celta midfielder Pablo Garcia was ejected in the 68th minute after receiving his second yellow card. 

Meanwhile, in England, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer scored the winning goal in injury time and Henrik Larsson added another in his debut to put Manchester United into the fourth round of the FA Cup with a 2-1 win over Aston Villa. 

Solskjaer, who replaced Larsson with 12 minutes to go, took a pass from Wayne Rooney and sent a low shot which went under the body of villa goalkeeper Gabor Kiraly. 

The goal meant that the two united scorers had a combined age of 68. Larsson is 35 and Solskjaer turns 34 next month. Also on Sunday, Blackburn won 4-1 in Everton, but Manchester City could only draw 1-1 at league championship club Sheffield on Wednesday and Tottenham was held to a 0-0 draw in Cardiff.

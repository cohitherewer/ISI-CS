The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Hard work pays off: Gurbux

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Footballers created a major splash, claiming the Nehru Cup last month. Not to be outdone, the Indian hockey team humbled Asian powerhouse Korea 7-2 in the final to retain the Asia Cup title on Sunday. 

This was their second consecutive win over Korea in the tournament. On what seems Indian hockeys welcome resurgence, The Telegraph spoke to few city-based stalwarts. 

Following are the excerpts (in alphabetical order): 

KESHAV DUTT: I was a bit unlucky in that I didnt see Indias efforts. Now it seems that Shah Rukh Khans Chak De! India has had a positive effect. It may be a coincidence though! I hope this winning trend continues. But I would like to criticise the IHFs announcement that the players would be penalised for conceding goals in the Asia Cup. It came at a wrong time and could have affected Indias performance. 

BALJIT SINGH SAINI: The achievement came at the right time Great achievement. But as a player I feel the boys should not get carried away. They should now switch off for about 7-10 days and then concentrate on Olympic qualifiers. 

GURBUX SINGH: Its a great achievement no doubt and the boys have really made us proud by winning in a convincing fashion. We have been playing well since the Azlan Shah, but the hard work finally paid off. I think the team is regaining old rhythm and it can only get better from here. Our principal aim should be to qualify for the Olympics, which according to me is quite possible.

 Nadal-Moya clash a special for both

Barry Flatman

Family life means a lot to Rafael Nadal. One uncle coaches him, another footballs Beast of Barcelona was his childhood sporting hero. And, like any good son, wherever possible he gives gratitude to his mother and father. Yet though there is no elder brother to demonstrate the ways of the world, he has not found wanting on the tennis circuit because there has always been Carlos Moya to fill the role. 

Until now that is because Moya, fellow Majorcan as well as guide to the best Spanish restaurants around the world, confidante when things get a little problematical, occasional PlayStation opponent, member of the same card school and dining partner when Rafa celebrated his 21st birthday on Sunday, is the next man that stands in the way of the champion and his quest for a hattrick of French Open titles. 

Ten years separate these two sons of the biggest Balearic Island. Nadal maintains his memories of Moya beating another Spaniard Alex Corretja in 1998 were inspirational but a trifle vague. Ever since Nadal, now world No. 2, emerged onto the circuit as the most powerfully built of teenagers, Moya has been there as his unofficial guide. 

Many believe that the youngster really came of age in the Davis Cup final victory over the United States in Seville at the end of 2004. Many believe Nadals victory over Andy Roddick in the second singles rubber was the portent of victory but Moya contributed more, winning both his singles matches and effectively clinching the title. 

On the tour they have met five times and four of the confrontations have come in the intensity of the Masters Series. Currently the score stands at 3-2 to Nadal but the past three meetings have gone the maximum distance. Never have they met in a Grand Slam and, for both, the French Open is the pinnacle of the tennis year so this face-off is potentially the most special for both men.

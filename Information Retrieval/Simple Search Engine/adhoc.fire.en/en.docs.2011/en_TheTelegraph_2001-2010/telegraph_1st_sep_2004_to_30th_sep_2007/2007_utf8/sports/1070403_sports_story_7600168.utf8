 Scott best, Jeev finishes 78th

Houston: Jeev Milkha Singh and Daniel Chopra slid down the leaderboard on the final day of the Houston Open golf tournament on Sunday. 

Jeev had a flurry of bogeys and a quadruple bogey in his 79 to finish 78th, while Chopra, ninth after three days, fired a one-over 73 to finish in a tie for 24th. Jeev finished with an eight-over 296 aggregate, while Chopra ended with a seven-under 281. 

Jeev had two birdies on the 10th and 12th, but bogeyed 13th and 17th, and double-bogeyed the 18th. On the back nine, he bogeyed the second and the quadruple bogey came on the par-4 fifth. He had another bogey on sixth, before a final birdie on the eighth. Chopra had two birdies and three bogeys in his final round of 73 as his putting let him down. 

Meanwhile, Adam Scott of Australia survived an errant drive into the lake on the 18th hole to claiming the final tune-up before the US Masters by three strokes after a closing six-under 66.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Fitness test likely tomorrow

 - Physio declines to comment on Sourav 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sourav 

Calcutta: Sourav Gangulys post-right ankle injury fitness is likely to be assessed on Tuesday during Team Indias first practice session after the two World Cup warm-up matches. 

The last outing (and a mighty successful one), against the West Indies, was on Friday. 

While Saturday was reserved for an outing on the beach and a boat ride, Sunday was a day off for the mega events opening ceremony. Monday has been marked for travel from Montego Bay in Jamaica to Port of Spain in Trinidad and Tobago. 

Physio John Gloster has said Sourav is going to be fit for our opening World Cup match (versus Bangladesh on Saturday)... However, no nets session has been scheduled till Tuesday and, so, weve got to wait... Theek ho jana chahiye, manager Sanjay Jagdale told The Telegraph. 

Contacted at the team hotel on Sunday evening, he added: Gloster is, of course, regularly working with Sourav... He has indicated that the problem has occurred earlier... 

Gloster, meanwhile, declined to comment. Im sorry I cant say anything...The manager alone can respond to your queries. Perhaps, the fiasco over Munaf Patel, in South Africa, has made him wary. 

The former captain, it may be recalled, figured in last Fridays starting line-up but his actual appearance was limited to just a few overs. With a couple of days rest, he (Sourav) should be okay, is what the captain, Rahul Dravid, stated after that match. 

Well, theres bound to be more attention on Tuesdays practice session.

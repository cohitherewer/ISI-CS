 Rumeli, Jhulan star in Asias win over Africa

Bangalore: Indias Jhulan Goswami and Rumeli Dhar ripped through the Africa XI batting line-up and powered Asia XI women to a comprehensive 60-run victory in an Afro-Asia Twenty20 tie at the Chinnaswamy Stadium here on Tuesday. 

Jhulan picked up three wickets in her first spell of three overs. Her new ball partner Rumeli claimed four as Africa folded up for 45 in 15 overs, chasing Asias 105 for nine. 

The Africans were shaky from the start losing four wickets for just five runs. 

Africa XIs Alicia Smith was the only one to offer some resistance with a gritty unconquered 23. 

Put in to bat, the Asians got off to a shocking start when they were reduced to three wickets for four runs in the first two overs and then slumped to 27 for four before slowly stitching a recovery. 

Opener Sulakshana Naik played the sheet-anchor to notch up 31 off 34 balls with five fours. She played well before being castled while trying to slog Ashlyn Kilowan, Africas most impressive bowler.

 Marathoner passes away

London: A 22-year-old man who fell ill after completing the London Marathon, died on Monday, organisers said. 

It is with regret that we can confirm that a 22-year-old man died peacefully this morning, having collapsed after successfully completing the London Marathon yesterday, organisers said in a statement. We offer our deepest sympathy and condolences to his family and friends. 

We fully respect the wishes of his family not to release any further details at this difficult time. 

The London marathon, held annually since 1981, is one of the most popular in the world. Sundays race was run in challenging heat. The temperature nearly hit 21 degrees Celsius (70 degrees Fahrenheit) at midday, almost equalling the 1996 record, and later rose slightly. 

The St John Ambulance medical charity said it treated 5,032 runners, 73 of whom were sent to hospital for further treatment. (AFP)

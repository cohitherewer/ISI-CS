The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No Wankhede concern

Mumbai: The Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) said on Thursday that there was no concern over the seventh and final ODI between India and Australia here on October 17 in the wake of fans running on to the Wankhede Stadium turf during the Indian teams felicitation on Wednesday. 

There is no concern over the match. There are still 20 days to go, said MCA treasurer Ratnakar Shetty. 

MCA vice-president Dilip Vengsarkar changed his earlier stand that there was cause for some concern over the damage caused by the crowd invasion and said there was no need to create a controversy. 

The former India skipper had inspected the ground in the morning and said there was some cause for concern.

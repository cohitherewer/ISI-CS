The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I couldnt be more proud, says Dravid

RAHUL DRAVID: As a captain, I couldnt be more proud... Its a fair result... England dominated the first Test, we dominated the next two... What really pleases me is that everybody contributed... The wicket was beginning to turn a bit towards the end, it was a good cricket wicket... We didnt have a coach in the conventional sense, but had a great back-room staff... 

MICHAEL VAUGHAN: There are some series you lose when you know you havent played well... Then, there are series like this one, when you feel you havent played badly... We were up against a very good Indian team... Weve got to learn from mistakes and also take note of the positives... I hope people have seen that the England side is prepared to fight... We showed character (on the last day)... 

ZAHEER KHAN (MoS for India): To be honest, after the first day of the series (at Lords), I didnt expect this result... I was myself tense and nervous that morning... There had been a lot of expectations... We recovered on the second day and didnt look back... R.P. Singh and Sreesanth bowled very well... Im feeling very proud... At this time last year, Id been wondering when I would make my comeback... Today, Ive got this award... 

JAMES ANDERSON (MoS for England): Luckily the ball came out pretty well in the whole series... Ive got to keep working on my game... Ill be trying to consistently get performances like this... 

ANIL KUMBLE (MoM): Its a very special moment... Its nice to go back home with a series win... The hundred is going to remain special as well... Yes, Shane Warne (who failed to get a Test hundred) did send me a congratulatory message...

 Flop show awaits 2011 unless ICC has a rethink

CHRISTOPHER MARTIN-JENKINS

Only intervention from ESPN Star, the Disney and Rupert Murdoch-owned television conglomerate, can prevent a repetition of the basic mistake made in the World Cup when it is staged on the Indian sub-continent in 2011. 

The ICCs 10 full members, of whom, quite disgracefully, Zimbabwe is still one, have already agreed that the next tournament will have 16 teams. Incredibly, given the widespread agreement that this tournament has lacked momentum, television sources say that 53 matches, rather than 51 this time, are being pencilled in by the host nations, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. 

ESPN is understood to have agreed to a sum of 600 million for media and sponsorship rights to 18 ICC tournaments over the next eight years. 

Since, thereby, they will oil the wheels of all the world events controlled by ICC from 2007 to 2015, they have the power, if they deem that the length and nature of the present tournament has been commercially counter-productive, to demand that the ICCs executive committee should think again. If they are wise, they will. The tournament desperately needs pruning, both in the number of participating countries and the time it takes to find a winner. 

The BBC highlights of the first 48 of the 51 matches in this World Cup have been attracting audiences consistently close to a million viewers sometimes more despite being transmitted after 11pm. 

It shows that interest in the tournament has been considerable, even in a country whose campaign lacked spark until it was too late. But all concerned with the tournament in the West Indies and certainly those watching at home are agreed on one thing: a seven-week tournament is too long. 

The painfully slow build-up to next Saturdays climax invites two important questions. How can the World Cup be made shorter next time and, even more fundamentally, what is its purpose? 

The commercial success of the worlds governing body is not in doubt. The snag is that it tends to put the cart before the horse: to consider the bottom line financially before looking after the attraction of the game itself. 

In 1992, generally agreed to be the best tournament since the first one, nine teams played each other to produce four semi-finalists but there were 39 games in a month and rain produced inequities. The development of second-tier countries such as Ireland and Kenya has been an ICC success and it has gone too far to abandon now. 

In 2011 there should be 12 nations, playing in two seeded groups of six, the top two in each group going through to a semi-final. A months cricket and 34 matches would serve the game better.

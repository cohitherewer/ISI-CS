The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 New one-day International rules come into effect

A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: Saturdays match between India and Australia at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore saw the new ODI rules being implemented. 

The changes were adopted after the ICC Board ratified the Cricket Committee proposal at its meeting in Dubai. 

The changes were due to take effect from October 1, but have already been implemented to avoid confusion during the series overlap (India-Australia and Sri Lanka-England). Both series will take place under the new playing conditions. 

The main changes are: 

 Mandatory ball change at the start of the 35th over of each innings 

 Free hit (the batsman cannot be dismissed by the bowler) applies to the delivery following a front foot no-ball; this regulation was applied during the ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa 

 Boundaries square of the wicket must be a minimum of 150 yards (previously 140 yards) with a minimum 65 yards on one side. Straight boundaries must be 70 yards minimum (previously 60 yards)* 

 Where space is available, the largest playing area must be used to the maximum of a 90-yard boundary* 

 The fielding captain can nominate either the second or third Powerplay to have a third fielder outside the 30-yard circle; the signal by the umpire for this will be the usual Powerplay signal (rotation of the arm) followed by a hand signal where he raises three fingers 

 If the number of overs for the batting team is reduced, the number of Powerplay overs shall be reduced and spaced out accordingly. For example, if an innings is reduced to 20-22 overs per side, the eight powerplay overs would then be divided into three blocks of four, two and two overs. This would apply to both the innings 

 If a team is bowled out within 30 minutes of the scheduled interval, there would be an immediate break. Match will restart accordingly 

 If more than 60 minutes is lost in a match (minus extra time), the interval between innings shall be reduced to 30 minutes 

 The use of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) or other adhesives would not be permitted during the preparation of pitches 

 The match referee will have the final say in awarding the match to a side if the other side refuses to play 

 Umpires shall be empowered to impose time-wasting penalties in accord with the Laws of the game if the new batsman is not ready to face his first delivery within two minutes of the fall of the previous wicket 

 The changes in playing conditions relating to the use of PVA, the size of boundaries, the awarding of a match in the event of a side refusing to play, time-wasting, the responsibilities of the match referee in relation to any allegation of ball-tampering and the fact the captain is held responsible if it is not possible to identify the person/s responsible for changing the condition of the ball, are also applicable to the Test and Twenty20 International playing conditions from October 1. 

Note: *Any ground which has been approved to host international cricket prior to October 1, 2007, or which is currently under construction as of this date and unable to conform to these new minimum dimensions, shall be exempt. 

In such cases, the regulations in force immediately prior to the adoption of these regulations will apply.

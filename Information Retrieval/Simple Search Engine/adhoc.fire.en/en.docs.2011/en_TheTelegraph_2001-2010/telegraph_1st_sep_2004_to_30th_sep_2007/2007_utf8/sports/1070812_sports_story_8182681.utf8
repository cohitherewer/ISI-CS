 Fresh tantrum may land Shoaib in more trouble

Karachi: Fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar could find himself in more trouble after throwing a tantrum at the Pakistan Cricket Board headquarters in Lahore on Friday evening. 

The Rawalpindi Express was earlier fined a total of Rs 300,000 and docked points from his new central contract for indiscipline. 

The paceman had left the training camp for the ICC World Twenty20 without notice and failed to show up before the disciplinary committee to respond to charges of misconduct levelled against him. 

On Friday evening, the mercurial bowler showed up at the Gaddafi Stadium where the board offices are located and demanded to see Shafqat Nagmi and Zakir Khan, both top officials. 

Eyewitnesses said that on not finding them in their rooms, Shoaib lost temper and kicked the doors and foulmouthed the officials. 

Later, a private TV channel quoted Shoaib as saying that he was protesting over the action taken against him without giving him a chance to state his side of the story. 

The fast bowler said that he had received the letter to appear before the disciplinary committee on Thursday evening and that he had left the camp owing to a neck strain and had informed team manager Talat Ali. 

The PCB has given Shoaib two weeks to appeal against the penalties imposed on him.

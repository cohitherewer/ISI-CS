The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sridharan counts the positives

A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: For India, it was just a bad day in office. 

Having lost to Australia (2-3) to settle for the runners-up position in the second Commonwealth Volleyball Championship for men on Saturday, Indian coach G. E. Sridharan tried to ponder on the positives when he was posed the inevitable question of choking in the final. 

India, by the way, beat Australia 3-1 in the league stage to finish group toppers. 

Admitting that they made a few silly mistakes in the first two sets, Sridharan said: Initially, we had problems in blocking. But then we fought back in the third and fourth sets, which speak volumes about our performance. 

Losing the final set 11-15 cant be the yardstick of our performance. We should ponder on the positives of the tournament. We had beaten Australia 3-0 to emerge group toppers. Volleyball, as a sport, is definitely on the rise. We should look forward to a good performance in the forthcoming Asian championship to be held in Jakarta, the coach said. 

Tournaments Best Scorer Sanjay Kumar said that they had problems in blocking and passing. We were faulty in the two departments which led to our losses in the first two sets. But, thanks to the overwhelming support and our own determination we fought back well. A good start could have made the difference. 

Asked whether it was a ploy to lose 0-3 in league stage, Australian captain Benjamin Hardy said: Not at all. But we prepared too hard for the final and so put up a much improved performance.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ill try my best: Robin

Margao: Young gun Robin Uthappa, who has been selected in Indias World Cup squad, is keen to justify the faith reposed on him by the selectors by putting up a good show in the mega event. I am happy to be selected. I will try my best to make this opportunity count, said Uthappa who has edged out Delhi challenger Gautam Gambhir for the openers spot and is likely to launch the innings with former India skipper Sourav Ganguly in the World Cup to be held in March-April. 

Interestingly, Uthappa too can keep wickets like Karthik who is the second-choice stumper in the squad behind Mahendra Singh Dhoni. 

Uthappas career started in the home series against England in Indore when he made a fine 86 and was picked for the Abu Dhabi Series against Pakistan that came immediately afterwards.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dravid, Sachin in the picture

 - Board set to take feedback on Chappell 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Team India captain Rahul Dravid and vice-captain Sachin Tendulkars feedback is almost certain to be taken before the Board has a discussion with Greg Chappell, whose contract as coach ends with the World Cup. 

Chappell succeeded John Wright in May 2005. 

We plan to get a feedback from a couple of senior players before any discussion with Greg We dont wish to involve everybody and that, at the moment, is our plan of action We havent thought beyond getting the feedback, a senior Board official told The Telegraph on Saturday. 

He added: We expect those seniors to reflect the views of others in the team Players are definite stakeholders in any coach-appointing exercise. 

The couple of seniors can only be the captain and vice-captain. 

For obvious reasons, its highly unlikely that either Sourav Ganguly or Virender Sehwag will be brought into the picture. 

While the official didnt spell it out, one understands the feedback may be taken on Tuesday when Board president Sharad Pawar interacts with the World Cup-bound squad in Mumbai. 

Besides addressing the Dravids, the president is going to host a dinner, around 30 hours before the Indians depart for the West Indies. 

As an opportunity will be there, Pawar can also have a word with Chappell that night itself. 

As reported in these columns last Sunday, Chappell (according to sources close to him) isnt averse to continuing, but would like the Board to let its stand be known quickly. 

On record, the former Australian captain hasnt said anything beyond I cant say (about the future) I know as much as you probably do Right now, Im thinking about the World Cup. 

That the Board hasnt started a dialogue as yet is, of course, surprising. 

Team Indias first commitment after the World Cup, which ends on April 28, is the tour of Bangladesh from May 7. 

Theres no breathing space.

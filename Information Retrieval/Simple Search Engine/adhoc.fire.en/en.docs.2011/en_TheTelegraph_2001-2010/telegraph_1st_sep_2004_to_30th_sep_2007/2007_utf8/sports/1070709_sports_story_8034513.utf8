The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dhoni up to 5th spot

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: England batsman Kevin Pietersen slipped from the top spot, while Indias wicketkeeper-batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni moved up one place to fifth in the LG ICC Player Rankings for ODI batsmen on Sunday. 

Dhoni, who turned 26 on Saturday, edged past Ramnaresh Sarwan, according to an ICC release. The injured West Indies captain, Sarwan, had to sit out in the three-match ODI series against the hosts England. 

Following his disappointing run in the three ODIs, having scored just 42 runs at an average of 14, Pietersen was knocked off from the top spot by Australia captain Ricky Ponting. 

With no one currently enjoying a rating in excess of the 800-point mark, Pietersen and Ponting swapped places. Meanwhile, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who was adjudged Player-of-the-Series for his efforts in the West Indies 2-1 win over England, gained four places to be on 13th. He scored 202 in three matches and was dismissed just once. 

The West Indies also closed the gap on England in the LG ICC ODI Championship by one point.

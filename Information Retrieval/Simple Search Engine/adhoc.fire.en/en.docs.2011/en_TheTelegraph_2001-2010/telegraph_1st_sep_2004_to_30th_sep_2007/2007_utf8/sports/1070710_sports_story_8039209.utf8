 Manoj Tiwary back at nets 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Manoj Tiwary, who has made the list of 30 probables for the ICC World Twenty20, resumed nets on Monday. 

The Bengal batsman had been injured ahead of Indias first ODI against Bangladesh in May. On Monday, he had a practice session for about 90 minutes before spending an hour at the gym. 

Tiwary is keen to play a domestic meet to prove his fitness before the final list for the Twenty20 meet is announced. I would love to play for Bengal if we participate in Moin-ud-Dowlah meet or Buchi Babu tournament, he said.

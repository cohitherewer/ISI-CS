Mumbai: Bengal duo Manoj Tiwary and Avishek Jhunjhunwala have made it to the 30-member probables list for the ICC World Twenty20, to be played in South Africa in September. 

Tiwary made the senior cut in ODIs during Indias tour of Bangladesh in May, but had to return with a shoulder injury just ahead of the first match. Jhunjhunwala, however, came into the senior fold for the first time. 

Tiwary, still recuperating from his injury, would start doing the nets from Tuesday. I have been training during these days, but will start attending nets from Tuesday, he said on Saturday. It really feels good to make a comeback. Now I have to challenge prove myself, he added. 

Jhunjhunwala, who is now playing in Division I club in England, sounded elated on getting the news. The news came to me as a surprise. I will try to put my best efforts in to make the final list, he said. 

India will have a new captain with Rahul Dravid opting out of the inaugural edition of the tournament, alongwith seasoned campaigners Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly, to make way for youngsters. The three stalwarts, in their 30s, made their decision known to the board before the national selection committee met to pick the probables. The out-of-favour players such as Virender Sehwag, Harbhajan Singh, Irfan Pathan and Mohammed Kaif also staged a comeback. 

Suresh Raina and Munaf Patel, who have also been out of the team for some time now, also found a place on the list, announced by the BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah here. 

Dilip Vengsarkar-led selection committee also included a number of young players who have performed consistently at the domestic level. 

Gujarat batsman Neeraj Patel, Saurashtras Cheteshwar Pujara, Punjab opener Karan Goel and S. Anirudha of Tamil Nadu, allrounders Niranjan Behera of Orissa and Praveen Kumar of Uttar Pradesh are some of them. 

The final squad will be picked on August 6 or 7, Shah said. 

Vengsarkar said Dravid called him from Hove to inform that the three senior players were opting out of the meet. 

I got a call from Rahul on Saturday morning He spoke on behalf of the three players and said they were opting out of the icc World Twenty20, Vengsarkar said. 

 Asked why the trio had opted out, 

 he said: I think they wanted to give chance to youngsters.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Not in the right spirit 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Simanta Das, a Calcutta Port Trust stopper-back, had to be hospitalised after an IFA-appointed doctor mistakenly gave him methylated spirit to drink, instead of water, during their Premier Division match against East Bengal. 

Simanta sustained a chest injury in a collision with East Bengals Snehasish Chakraborty in the 26th minute of the second session. Referee Rathin Mukherjee stopped play and called for medical aid. 

Nirmal Polley, the IFA-appointed doctor, attended Simanta and instead of giving water, he gave him a bottle of methylated spirit. Das immediately started to vomit and was rushed to the SSKM Hospital where his stomach was washed out. 

After Das was taken out of the ground, the Port Trust players surrounded the medico and tried to manhandle him. Police, however, came to Polleys rescue.

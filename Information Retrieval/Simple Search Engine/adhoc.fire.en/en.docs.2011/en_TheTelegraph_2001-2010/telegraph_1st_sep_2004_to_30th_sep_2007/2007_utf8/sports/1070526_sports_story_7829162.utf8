 Behave or else, PCB tells players

Karachi: Pakistani cricketers have been told to improve their behaviour or face stiff penalties following an incident in a recent one-day series against Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi involving Mohammed Asif. 

Asif was reprimanded by match referee Jawagal Srinath after he danced down the pitch on dismissing Sri Lankan skipper Mahela Jayawardene and taunted him on the way back to the pavilion. 

The Asif incident was unnecessary. The players have been told they must behave immaculately on the field and follow the International Cricket Council Code of Conduct, manager Talat Ali said. 

They have been reminded they are ambassadors of their country and such childish actions not only affect their image but also that of Pakistan cricket. 

Ali said under a new discipline code introduced by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), players tarnishing their own image or of the team by showing dissent or indulging in sledging could face severe in-house penalties. 

Having led his team to a 2-1 series win over the World Cup runners-up in Abu Dhabi, Shoaib Malik could be appointed for a longer period as skipper of the national side. 

The chairman of the board, Dr Nasim Ashraf said on returning from Abu Dhabi that he had been very impressed with the way young Malik handled the team in his first assignment. (AGENCIES)

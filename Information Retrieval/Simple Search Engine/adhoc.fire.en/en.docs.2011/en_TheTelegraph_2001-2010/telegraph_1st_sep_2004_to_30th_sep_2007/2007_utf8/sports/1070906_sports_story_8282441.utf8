 Bhaichung, Barreto set to fire 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhutia and Barreto 

New Delhi: The 29th edition of the Federation Cup, currently in progress in Ludhiana, might have attracted little crowd on the first two days. 

It could be a different story on Thursday when Mohun Bagan take on Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) in the pre quarter-final with their lethal striking duo of Jose Ramirez Barreto and Bhaichung Bhutia donning the club jersey together for the first time in the season. 

Bhaichung has played on this ground many a time, said JCT coach and Punjab Football Association (PFA) official Sukhwinder Singh. But since he has recently captained India to the Nehru Cup title, crowd may come to watch him. The spectators may further be attracted by Barretos presence. 

The defending champions are overwhelming favourites but that doesnt take away the pressure off Barreto and Bhutia. The famed pair performed much below expectation last season leaving their fans a disappointed lot. 

I accept that we didnt click last season, admitted the Mohun Bagan captain. But there were several reasons for it. Firstly, we had played only a few matches together and then I was not fully fit throughout the season. Things wont be the same this time. 

Barreto endorsed Bhutias views. 

Coach Carlos Roberto Pereira also hoped that the duo would be Mohun Bagans trump card in this tournament. Earlier we had to play Barreto as a withdrawal forward. Here both of them with lead from the front. 

Barreto doesnt want to focus only on their pairing. It wont matter if we two dont score. We have Lalkamal (Bhowmick), Venkatesh, Lalampuia and so many. All of them are capable of scoring against even the finest defence.

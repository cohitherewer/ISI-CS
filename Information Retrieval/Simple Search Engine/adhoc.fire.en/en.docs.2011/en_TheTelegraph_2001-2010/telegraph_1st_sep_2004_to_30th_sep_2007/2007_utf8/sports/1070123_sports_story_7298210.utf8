 Donald backs Woolmer for England job

London: South Africa legend Allan Donald has backed Bob Woolmer as the right man to guide England after the current Pakistan coach said he was open to offers following the World Cup. 

Former England batsman Woolmer is one of the leading contenders to succeed Duncan Fletcher, who has been criticised following Englands 0-5 Ashes thrashing. 

That led the ECB to instigate a wide-ranging review of the teams performance, due to report in March, and there has since been widespread speculation that Fletcher will quit his post after the World Cup ends in the Caribbean in April. 

The 58-year-old Woolmer, who was approached prior to Fletchers appointment by the ECB eight years ago, wants a fresh challenge after leading Pakistan in the West Indies. 

I will be open to offers after the World Cup, Woolmer said. 

I cant think of a more experienced coach to take over the job if it was to come along, former Warwickshire and South Africa fast bowler Donald told the BBC.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sania to open vs Sunitha

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sania Mirza will at last get the chance to take revenge. If the Indian tennis icon manages to get over her dodgy wrist and down to business in the 2007 Sunfeast Open, she will start her campaign against Sunitha Rao, the girl who defeated the World No.27 back in 2002 in Mumbai. 

In the singles draw announced here on Saturday, top-seeded Frenchwoman Marion Bartoli will take on Vania King of the US while second seed Slovak Daniela Hantuchovawill face Yaroslava Shvedova of Russia. 

While Sanias career has taken off since that defeat in Mumbai, Sunitha, who required a wild card to enter the main draw, will be hoping the third seed stays away. 

A decision is expected once Sania lands in the city on Sunday and if that actually happens, the US-based Sunitha placed 208th in WTA rankings will be facing a qualifier (lucky loser) and a possible quarter final appearance. 

Conversely, if Sania makes it in the end, a mouth-watering semi-final clash against Bartoli is a real possibility. 

Among the other wild card entrants, Tara Iyer faces a tough challenge against seventh seed Flavia Pennetta. 

Its tough, too, for the other wild card entrant. Rookie Kyra Shroff will open her campaign against eighth seed Yung-Jan Chan of Chinese Taipei. 

Fourth seed Maria Kirilenko faces a qualifier to begin with. Alla Kudryavtseva, the fifth seed, takes on Belarusian Tatiana Poutchek in Round I and may meet World No.10 Bartoli in the quarters. 

In the qualifiers which got underway on Saturday, Rushmi Chakravarthy was the sole Indian to make it to the next round. She beat compatriot Ankita Bhambri 6-4, 5-7, 6-2. 

City girl Shivika Burman lost 3-6, 1-6 to Marta Domachowska of Poland while Sanaa Bhambri was ousted by Britains Naomi Cavaday 2-6, 5-7. Isha Lakhani lost 2-6, 4-6 to Ekaterina Ivanova of Russia and British girl Sarah Borwell defeated Indias Ashvarya Shrivastava 6-0, 6-4. 

Neha Uberoi of the US beat compatriot Katherine Ruckert 6-2, 7-5. Other qualifiers who won were Monique Adamczak and Sandy Gumulya.

 Bagan have ammo to test Sao Paulo

FREE-KICK

 Barreto and Bhaichung Bhutia on Saturday

 East Bengal were lucky to get away with a three-goal defeat in Siliguri, Mohammedan Sporting let in half a dozen in Jamshedpur. The obvious question doing the rounds is, how many would Sao Paulo pump in against Mohun Bagan at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday?

 There is no doubt that this Sao Paulo side has some footballers with sublime skills, so typical of the Brazilian gharana. The likes of Hernanes and Francisco caught the eye time and again in the match against Mohammedan Sporting. They showed brilliant two-touch dribble, inside with one foot, then outside with the other to bamboozle the defenders and opened up the path to the goal. We also saw some delightful touch-play and deception which helped them toy with the opposition.

 There is a lot of variety in their attacks. They rely more on short passes, but have shown themselves to be equally adept at playing the long ball and switching the game from one end to the other. Like the Europeans, they interchange positions frequently to keep the rivals guessing all the time.

 This Sao Paulo side looks better than the one which visited India about two decades back. After all, they won the World Inter-Club Championship in 2005. But fact of the matter is, they havent been tested yet and have had things rolling their way, far too much.

 Watching Mohammedan Sporting play in Jamshedpur was a painful experience. None expected them to match the Brazilians in skill, but they didnt even come close to making a match of it. If Sao Paulo were playing football, our team was playing something else. The Brazilians didnt go full steam in the first session, yet the Mohammedan Sporting players looked to be in awe of their opponents. There were no more than a couple of counter-attacks and all but Ndem the lone man up front were busy defending.

 Yes, you have to defend against a quality side like Sao Paulo, but not by just retreating. You have to challenge them and look for openings to attack. I wont blame Subhas Bhowmick for Mohammedan Sportings poor show. What can he do if he doesnt have the men to do the job? I would say its a reflection of the age and times. Not only are our current footballers technically weak, they dont have a clear conception of the game either.

 The Sao Paulo club is not even at full strength. Even if they were, I can vouch that this same Sao Paulo outfit wouldnt have had it so easy against an Indian side 20-25 years ago. Indian teams have denied victory to outfits like Bochum before.

 Mohun Bagan, I feel, can put up a decent fight. If Barreto and Bhaichung can produce their best, Mohun Bagan can score a goal or two against Sao Paulo. Barreto being a Brazilian himself, he would be in a position to guide his team on how to go about the job. Another Brazilian, Eduardo Coelho, could play a key role in defence if he is fit to take the field.

 I would advise Mohun Bagan to go into the match fearlessly and without any inferiority complex. Unlike Mohammedan Sporting, they have the ammunition to test Sao Paulo. Whether they can fire on the battlefield remains to be seen.

 Before signing off, I would like to state that its great to see the Super Soccer Series being revived after a long gap. We dont host any international club championship in our country, barring the odd AFC Club meet games. By inviting good foreign club outfits every year, we can do a reality check on where our top clubs stand.

 Right now, unfortunately, the bridge between us and the best is far too wide.

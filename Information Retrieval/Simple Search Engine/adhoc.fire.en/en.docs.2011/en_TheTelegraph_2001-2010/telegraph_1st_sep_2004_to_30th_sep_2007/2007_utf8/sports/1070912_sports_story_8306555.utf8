The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ricky hungry for more

A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES

Calcutta: Australia captain Ricky Ponting, who bagged the prestigious Player of the Year and Captain of the Year honours at the ICC awards ceremony in Johannedburg on Sunday night, said he is aiming for a third straight one. 

On receiving the award, the 32-year-old Tasmanian said: Its more of an eventful night than I thought it would be and I am honoured. Its a great thrill for me and something I am very proud of. Its a great achievement I will probably look back on this in years to come with a lot of pride. I am the first player to win this award twice in row and maybe if I keep my head down there may be more around the corner. 

I was happy with the way I have gone about things during the past year and I think we have lifted ourselves to a new level. It has been an unbelievable 12 months and we should all be very proud with what we have achieved. 

Ponting received the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy from ICC president Ray Mali. 

Sachin Tendulkar was the only Indian to figure in either ODI or Test team. He was named one of the openers (along with Matthew Hayden) in the World ODI Team of the Year. 

According to information received here, while no Indian was there in the Test XI, the one closest to making the cut was Zaheer Khan, who was named the 12th man. 

The teams were picked by a specially appointed selection panel chaired by Indian batting legend Sunil Gavaskar. 

Yousuf, named Test Player of the Year, topped the poll ahead of Englands Kevin Pietersen and last years winner Ponting. This is the first time a Pakistan player has won this award so I am particularly delighted. Thanks to Allah, my Pakistan teammates I want to thank the ICC panel for voting for me, he said.

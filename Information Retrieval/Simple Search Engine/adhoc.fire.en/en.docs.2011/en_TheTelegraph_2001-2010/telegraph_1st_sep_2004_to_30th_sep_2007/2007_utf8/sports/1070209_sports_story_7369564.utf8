 Rs 8.20 crore cheque for CAB

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The CAB had reasons to be happy, despite the washout disappointment. First came a Rs 8.20 crore cheque from Sharad Pawar, as part of its withheld grants and subsidies, and then, the BCCI chiefs assurance for the proposed international meet at the Eden in May. 

Today he gave me a cheque for Rs 8.20 crore. This amount includes the TV subsidy. Pawar told me they had decided on principle to release the entire money that had been held back, CAB president Prasun Mukherjee said. 

Pawar, who was accompanied by wife Pratibha and BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla, left the Eden soon after play was stopped due to rain. 

Mukherjee held an indoor meeting with Pawar for about an hour and the issue of the proposed meet in May which was mooted by Jagmohan Dalmiya came up for discussion. 

The BCCI president has given us the verbal go-ahead for the meet, a CAB official later said. We plan to bring either South Africa or Australia for the tournament. But we can only decide on that after the World Cup gets over, he added.

 SAI charge against Rana

 - They have made me a scapegoat, says shooter 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi: A stupendous performance in the Asian Games notwithstanding, pistol shooter Jaspal Rana and the Sports Authority of India (SAI), it seems, are once again on a collision course. 

Speaking to The Telegraph on Monday, Rana the most successful Indian sportsperson in the Doha Asian Games with three gold medals alleged that SAI has been consciously trying to finish him off as a shooter by not providing him enough ammunition for practice. 

SAI, on its part, said that supply of ammunition has been stopped to the champion shooter since he has failed to return the empty cartridges. Some officials even have gone to the extent of saying that Rana, a BJP activist, are uttering things to suit his political purposes. 

I have been reduced to a position where I have no supply of ammunition and no coach, thanks to SAI, said Rana. Things now have come to such a pass that I have stopped practising and may not be able to accompany the team anywhere in the next few months, he complained. 

Rana said it has been done only to victimise him. Since I criticise SAI and the government, they have made me a scapegoat. The ammunition I receive from the SAI doesnt allow me to practise more than 20 days in a month. Thats the way they are treating me so that I quit the game. 

A senior SAI official, who didnt wish to be named, said Rana has been telling a bunch of lies for a long time now. No one holds anything against Rana. Supply of ammunition to Rana would be restored once he returns the empty cartridges. 

The official claimed that the ace pistol shooter had a monthly sanction of 3000 cartridges of .32 pistols and 2000 cartridges of .22 pistols for practice purposes. As a rule, all shooters are supposed to return the empty cartridges and the supply was stopped when Rana failed to do so. 

Any suggestion that he has been misusing the cartridges was laughed off by Rana, who has a total of four Asian Games gold medals under his belt. I have practised hard for years to come to this level. They cant finish me off like this.

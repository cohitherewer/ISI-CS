 Players survey indicates loss of confidence in ICC

 The World Cup final between Australia and Sri Lanka was completed in near darkness at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown 

The International Cricket Council (ICC) has lost the confidence of players and is being urged to launch an immediate review into its outdated structure. 

In a World Cup survey conducted by the Federation of International Cricketers Associations (Fica), 56 per cent players doubted the ICCs ability to govern the game. The same percentage of players stated that they had lost confidence in the ICCs ability to organise World Cups, with 89 per cent rating the recent tournament in the West Indies as average or worse. 

The ICC were seen as being out of touch with the rest of the cricketing world and Tim May, the Fica chief executive, called upon them to launch an immediate review. 

There has been a growing amount of dissatisfaction amongst a wide variety of cricket stakeholders over the past 24 months, regarding the governance of our game, May said. 

An independent review will determine what is the best and most applicable structure for crickets international governing body. We strongly believe that the present structure... is outdated and not in the best interests of the game. 

May insists the scrutiny should not fall on Malcolm Speed, the ICC chief executive, claiming it is the decision-making committees who are responsible for the recent issues which have dogged the game: the length of the World Cup, the Darrel Hair situation, anti-doping issues and Zimbabwes status in international cricket. And he believes their self-interest is undermining the ICCs responsibilities as a governing body. 

It is these committees that are ultimately responsible for the performance of the organisation, May said. 

These committees are mainly comprised of individual representatives of its full members. These committees composition are more than likely to deliver outcomes that are decided on party lines and the self interest of its members rather than the overall good of the game. 

Affiliation and loyalty to other committee members constituencies must take second place to their duty to the international board and the best interests to the game as a whole. Fica fully supports a strong and decisive ICC. 

May conceded that if a review suggests that the current structure is the best way forward, then at least it answers those critics who are demanding change. 

The review may well decide that the present structure is the most applicable. If so, all well and good, at least crickets stakeholders will then know that it is the best structure for our game. But at the moment we dont know whether it is and increasingly stakeholders want to know if there is a better structure. 

Ficas World Cup survey showed 64 per cent of players believe the same tournament structure i.e., four groups of four and then the Super Eights should stand for the next World Cup. But 87 per cent felt the tournament was too long and Fica insist the ICC take on board the players general dissatisfaction with the World Cup experience. 

The survey concludes: Despite the better than expected playing and venue conditions, the better than expected travel arrangements and other logistical arrangements, the players have returned a less than average rating of the event. 

The death of Bob Woolmer, the early exit of India and Pakistan, the long and laborious Super Eights, the lack of exciting matches, the rain-affected final, the unfortunate umpire/referee error at the final, and the long periods that players had at their disposal between matches all affected the players opinion. 

The less than average rating for the event is consistent with general viewer experience small crowds, lack of enthusiasm, one-sided matches are not the recipe for a great report card.

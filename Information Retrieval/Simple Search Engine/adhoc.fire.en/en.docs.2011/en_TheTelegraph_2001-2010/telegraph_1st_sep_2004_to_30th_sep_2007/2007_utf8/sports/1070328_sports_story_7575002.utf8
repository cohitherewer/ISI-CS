Ahmedabad: Former Indian captain and coach Kapil Dev on Tuesday hailed the manner in which minnows Ireland and Bangladesh defeated the title-contenders and advance into the Super Eight stage of the ongoing World Cup. 

I am very happy to see the manner in which Ireland and Bangladesh have played this World Cup, Kapil said. 

It is very good for cricket, said Kapil, under whose leadership India won the 1983 World Cup. 

The former allrounder was here to announce the setting up of the countrys biggest indoor cricket arena. 

According to him, the entry of two minnows into the second stage of the games biggest show will give a big push to cricket in those countries and help spread cricket in other parts of the globe. 

The 1992 champions Pakistan were shown their way out of the premier event after their defeat to Ireland. 

India met with a similar fate, after the drubbing by Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. 

I hope one day the game is played in about 100 countries, he remarked. (PTI)

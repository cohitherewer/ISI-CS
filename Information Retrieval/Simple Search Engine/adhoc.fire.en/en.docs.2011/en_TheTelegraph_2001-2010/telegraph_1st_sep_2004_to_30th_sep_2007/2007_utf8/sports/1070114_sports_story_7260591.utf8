 Hair to officiate in tri-series

New Delhi: Controversial Australian umpire Darrell Hair has been appointed to officiate in a tri-series in Mombasa involving Kenya, Scotland and Canada next week. 

An ICC spokesperson said Hairs appointment was consistent with the November decision of ICC. 

The tri-series in Mombasa does not feature any ICC full members, ICC media manager Brian Murgatroyd said Saturday. 

Former India pacer Jawagal Srinath would be the Match Referee. (PTI)

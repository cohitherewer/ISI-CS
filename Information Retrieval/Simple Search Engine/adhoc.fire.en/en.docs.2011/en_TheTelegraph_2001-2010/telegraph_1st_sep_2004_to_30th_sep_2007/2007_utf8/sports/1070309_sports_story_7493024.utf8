 Norths defeat gives West title

Mumbai: South Zone defended a small target with enthusiasm and defeated North Zone by 30 runs here on Thursday to enable West Zone capture the Deodhar Trophy title with two league ties yet to be played in the tournament. 

Put in to bat, South struggled from 82 for five to post a modest total of 191 all out in 44.3 overs. But their new ball bowlers particularly Ishant Sharma and Ashish Nehra fought back superbly to skittle North for 161 in 46.4 overs. 

South owed their decent score to a patient half-century from Subramaniam Badrinath (51 in 76 balls). 

North, who needed to win the match with a bonus point to keep their slim title hopes alive, lost their top half for 49 against the South new ball attack led by Andhras KS Sahabuddin who took two wickets in his sixth over. 

North, with four points to their credit, take on East on Saturday while South (4) clash with West (14) in the last tie on Sunday.

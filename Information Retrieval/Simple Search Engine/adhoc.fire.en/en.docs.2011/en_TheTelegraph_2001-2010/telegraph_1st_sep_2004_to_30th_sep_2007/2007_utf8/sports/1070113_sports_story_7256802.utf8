 English woes continue

 - Pietersen ruled out of tri-series 

 Michael Vaughan leaves the MCG after being dismissed for 26 on Friday 

Melbourne: Ricky Ponting guided Australia to an eight-wicket win in the opening tri-series ODI against England Friday, extending his sides unbeaten stretch against the tourists in all versions of cricket this summer. 

Ponting scored 82 from 96 balls as Australia reached 246 for two, surpassing Englands 242 for eight with more than four overs to spare. 

He shared a 133-run partnership with Michael Clarke, who was unbeaten on 57 when Australia passed the target. 

Kevin Pietersen top scored for England with 82 from 91 balls but was ruled out for the remainder of the series after being struck in the ribs advancing down the pitch at a Glenn McGrath short ball. It was a major blow for Englands series and World Cup ambitions. 

The Australian chase started quickly, with Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden putting on 101 for the first wicket before Gilchrist was out for 60 from 61 balls, including five boundaries and a six.

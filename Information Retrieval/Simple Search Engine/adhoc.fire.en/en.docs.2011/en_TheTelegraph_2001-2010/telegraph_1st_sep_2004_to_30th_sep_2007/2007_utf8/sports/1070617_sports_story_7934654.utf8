 Alonso turns heat on and off track

 - There is no civil war, insists the two-time Formula One world champion

The lessons are coming thick and fast for Lewis Hamilton, not least in the potent demonstration of power politics being played by the man on the other side of the McLaren garage, Fernando Alonso. The world champion is delivering a lesseon in how to bring influence to bear. 

Alonso is singularly miffed to be trailing in Hamiltons wake. He refuses to accept that he may be second best. His outburst on Spanish radio, alleging an English bias at McLaren towards Hamilton, was not particularly well received by the hard men of Formula One. Whinger was a popular response. 

Yet far from retreating from his position, Alonso reiterated his complaints with bells on in the Indianapolis paddock, a move intended to jar a cage or two at the top of the McLaren food chain. His beef appears to be technical and procedural, to do with the way the team executes race weekends and testing. Alonso would not give details, saying only that he has made his feelings known. 

There is no civil war, he said. I never said anything against the team. In fact, I said I had a competitive car, good enough to win my third consecutive title. What I said was that I was not totally comfortable. To be totally comfortable with the team there are things missing that Ive talked to them about and that I think are necessary. 

Things need to be done the way I think they need to be done. There are things that I thought would be different which are not. The team has its reasons, its philosophy. I can agree with it or not. 

I think it will come with time. I hope so because, as I said, the philosophy of the team is clear. It has been always like this. I think we all need to accommodate ourselves in the new position. Sometimes it is not easy to get used to things in a very short time. 

The Canadian Grand Prix proved a calamity for Alonso. As a result, Indianapolis, a circuit around which he has historically struggled, has acquired critical significance. Should he fall further behind Hamilton on Sunday, a deficit that stands at eight points could play havoc with a troubled mind. Alonso has been careful not to personalise issues, yet the tone of his comments about Hamilton betrays his concerns. 

Ive had strong teammates before, like (Jarno) Trulli in 2004. I was behind him in the middle of the championship and I finished ahead of him in the end. And Ive won a title ahead of (Kimi) Raikkonen and another one ahead of Michael Schumacher, so Im not easily surprised. 

Alonso has brought his A game. He has reached a defining moment in the season and has unleashed all the weapons at his disposal, political and otherwise. 

His electric pace around a circuit on which he has never finished better than fifth confirmed his intent. He was making a statement with every lap. He knows the importance of this race, in terms of the team dynamics and the title. We are seeing a champion at work.

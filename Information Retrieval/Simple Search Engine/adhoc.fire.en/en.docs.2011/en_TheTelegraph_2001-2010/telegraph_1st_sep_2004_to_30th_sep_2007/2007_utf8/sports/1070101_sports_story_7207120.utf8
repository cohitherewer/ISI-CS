The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mukherjee confirms candidature

 - Dutt reiterates he wont contest 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: City police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee on Sunday confirmed his candidature for the CAB presidents post, elections for which are likely to be held in February. After Mr Jagmohan Dalmiyas resignation, I asked CAB joint secretary Saradindu Pal whether there was a vacancy, and he said yes. So I announced my candidature for the presidents post, Mukherjee said at a press conference. 

Mukherjees formal announcement also prompted Biswanath Dutt to reiterate that he wont be contesting the elections. Id made it clear to Dalmiya and others who requested me to take charge in this hour of crisis that I wouldnt like a contest. Im not changing my stand I will not contest the elections, Dutt told The Telegraph. 

Mukherjee urged the members not to delay the election process as the CAB was losing out on many fronts following their strained relationship with the BCCI. The venues for the next World Cup will be finalised sometime in February, and so by that time we should be in a position to stake our claim with proper leadership This time the CAB shouldnt go unrepresented, Mukherjee said. 

Mukherjee, who lost to Dalmiya by 61-56 votes during the last AGM in July, seemed confident about a positive outcome this time. Many people who were with the opposition camp last time have already promised support. I have received positive response from most of the affiliates. So, Im very confident of winning. 

Mukherjee termed Dutt as an elderly statesman of the Maidan. I had also discussed a few things with him before last years election as he is a respected man in administration, but I dont want to comment whether he should contest or not as it is absolutely his decision, he said. 

Mukherjee explained his decision to contest despite losing the last time. I had support from 56 members those who voted for me last time and this time when there is a crisis, I have to ensure them full support and want say that I am here to stay and my contesting is not a one-off thing, he remarked.

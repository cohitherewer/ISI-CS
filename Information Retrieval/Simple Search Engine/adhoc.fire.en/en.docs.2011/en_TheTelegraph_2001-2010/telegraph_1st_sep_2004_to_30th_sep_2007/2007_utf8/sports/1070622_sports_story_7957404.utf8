 Injured Murray still doubtful

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

For the first time in his career, Andy Murray was named among the elite top eight seeds for Wimbledon. But whether he will be able to make use of that seeding remains in doubt after he disclosed last night (Wednesday) that he was still not comfortable with putting his wrist through the stress of repeated groundstrokes at full pelt. 

As the No.8 seed, Murray would have protection in the draw, as he would not have to meet the likes of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal until the quarter finals. 

But it is a distinct possibility that Murray may not even get as far as playing the first round, as Wimbledon starts in just four days, on Monday, with the draw to be made on Friday. 

It was over five weeks ago that Murray hurt the tendons in his right racket-playing wrist at the Hamburg Masters when hitting what seemed to be a straightforward forehand. But he reported that although he has been able to hit his serve and his volley without any worries, he has been holding back on his groundstrokes, as those shots put more strain on the joint and so he has not felt ready to turn the power up to the maximum on his forehand and backhand swings. 

Its not just the forehand. I dont know about Wimbledon, Murray said from the Boodles Challenge exhibition at Stoke Park in Buckinghamshire, where his waxwork statue was unveiled by Madame Tussauds. He had earlier practised on the grass courts at the National Tennis Centre in Roehampton. 

Murray has said that it is borderline whether he will play at Wimbledon. 

Quite a lot has been made about my wrist. I havent said too much about it though Ive tried to keep it under wraps. But it is and was always going to be borderline about whether I play.

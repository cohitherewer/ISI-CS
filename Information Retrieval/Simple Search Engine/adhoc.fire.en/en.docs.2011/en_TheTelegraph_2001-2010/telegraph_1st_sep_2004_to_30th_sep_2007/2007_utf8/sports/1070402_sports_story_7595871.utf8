 British pathologists call for 2nd autopsy

London: A new revelation is doing the rounds that an upset Bob Woolmer was drowning his sorrows in a bottle of whisky after Pakistans shock exit from the World Cup, even as some of Britains leading pathologists have expressed doubts murder-theory and have called for a second autopsy to examine the cause of death. 

According to a report in a British daily, a witness has described how the 58-year-old sat alone in the bar of the Jamaica Pegasus in Kingston after Pakistans shock exit and drowned his sorrows in a bottle of Scotch. 

The witness said that the England-born Woolmer sat alone on the team bus after the match, looking extremely vexed. At the hotel, he is said to have begun drinking almost immediately, the report claimed. 

Most of the Pakistani players went to attend a dinner hosted by multi-millionaire car dealer Tariq Malik at his residence, but Woolmer stayed back. 

There was an open invitation for him the previous evening but the players told me he stayed back at the hotel. They said he had drunk up to a bottle and was really drowning his sorrows, Malik said. 

Meanwhile, Britans top forensic experts have said a second autopsy is needed to clear the mystery. They said the publicly available facts on the case indicated a highly unusual murder of a type that none of them had ever witnessed, according to a report in another British daily. 

Britains foremost experts on strangulation, Bill Hunt, a former president of the British Association in Forensic Medicine, said, from what I have seen and read, it is virtually impossible that this is strangulation. (PTI)

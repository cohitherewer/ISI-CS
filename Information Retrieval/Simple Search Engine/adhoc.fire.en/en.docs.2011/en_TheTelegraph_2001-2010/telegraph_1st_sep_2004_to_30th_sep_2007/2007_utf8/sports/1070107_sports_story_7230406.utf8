 Fletcher not to quit

Sydney: Duncan Fletcher will not quit as England coach in the immediate wake of a humiliating 0-5 Test series loss in Australia, saying he believes he is the right person to shape a squad capable of reclaiming the Ashes. 

The England Cricket Board announced a wide-reaching review of the squad and team management within hours of the 10-wicket loss in the fifth Test in Sydney Thursday. 

Fletcher, a Zimbabwean who orchestrated the upset 2-1 Ashes series win over the Australians in England in 2005, appeared before a news conference today and declined comment on any potential outcomes of the review. 

Despite some backlash against him in the British media, Fletcher said he would stick to his original plan and only reconsider his position after the World Cup. 

I really believe I have the confidence of the players and the backing of the players and thats what is very, very important, he said. 

Asked if he had the confidence of Englands cricket administration, he replied: youll have to ask those people. 

He further said that Andrew Flintoff struggled with the burden of captaining England during the Ashes. Fletcher said Flintoff often had problems deciding how to manage his young bowlers against an experienced and ruthless Australian batting line-up. He found it difficult. 

However, he felt that theres no major overhaul of the team needed and that the rebuilding of English cricket had started with this tour, when the squad was without regular captain Michael Vaughan, opener Marcus Trescothick and paceman Simon Jones. 

Before England hosts the next Ashes series in 2009, Fletcher said hed like to get people like Shane Warne involved now that he has retired. 

Someone of that calibre would be very useful for England to use his experience, at any stage during the (Northern) summer or at any stage of a players career. 

Fletcher said Warne, who retired as the greatest wicket-taker in Test cricket history, could not only offer invaluable advice to Englands slow bowlers but to all the players. 

Imagine the help he could give to a very, very experienced spinner in the side, Fletcher said. Hes got the capabilities of helping anyone in international cricket on how to play the game.

Heinze loses bid to leave United 

 London: Gabriel Heinze has lost his bid to force Manchester United to sell him to Liverpool. The Argentina defender failed on Tuesday to convince a Premier League panel to allow him to leave Old Trafford for Anfield. Heinze had argued that United had written a letter that would allow him to leave if another club offered a transfer fee of 6.8 million. 

However, the panel backed Manchester United, who said they had told Heinze both orally and in writing that he would not be allowed to join a Premier League title rival. 

Citys Bojinov out for five months 

 Manchester: Valeri Bojinov will be sidelined for at least five months after he seriously injured his knee in Manchester Citys 1-0 victory over Manchester United. City said on Monday in a statement that the Bulgaria striker damaged the lateral and anterior cruciate ligaments in his left knee when he fell early in the game at the City of Manchester Stadium. 

Jol on shaky ground 

 London: Martin Jols three-year reign as manager of Tottenham Hotspur appeared to be coming to an end on Tuesday despite him steering the club to their highest league position since 1990 and back into Europe. Widespread media reports said the affable Dutchman had lost the support of the clubs directors and could make way for Sevilla boss Juande Ramos. He, however, has denied that he plans to leave the club. The clubs president, Jose Maria del Nido, said on Tuesday that Ramos would remain at the Primera Liga side at least until the end of the season. 

Camacho takes over 

 Lisbon: Former Spain and Real Madrid coach Jose Antonio Camacho took over as Benfica manager on Tuesday. The Spaniard replaced Fernando Santos, who was fired on Monday after only two competitive games this season. It is Camachos second stint as Benfica coach. He joined the club midway through the 2002-03 season and left in 2004, leading the Eagles to the runner-up spot in both seasons.

The federations disciplinary panel banned former SK Lierse coach Paul Put, 51, from holding any job in Belgian soccer.

 Facilities in Windies worst in the world

Melbourne: The West Indies may have made a concerted effort to build infrastructure for the World Cup but Australian skipper Ricky Ponting is unimpressed and feels the training facilities in the Caribbean continue to be the worst in the world. 

Since I was here for the first time, in 1995, thats 12 years of touring here, training facilities have always been the worst in the world by a long, long way, Ponting was quoted as saying by a daily. 

I have been on tours here where you could hardly practise between Test matches. You might train up on the Test venue and have a few throw-downs on the outfield and that was just about as much as you could do, he added. 

Ponting said it was important that the West Indies continued to work on their infrastructure as it was crucial to their chances of reviving cricket in the country. 

Once they get those facilities in place, they will start attracting more kids to the game and their first-class teams will be able to train and prepare better. 

This will bring on better players and their national team will be able to get some great quality preparation as well, he explained. 

The Aussie skipper felt despite the flop show that the World Cup was turning out to be, the West Indies would benefit from the showpiece event financially, but would have to make sure that the money was spent in the right direction. 

I think this World Cup is a huge event for the West Indies. If they dont maximise the money that is generated from this World Cup in terms of getting their infrastructure and facilities right, then they could really fall by the wayside, Ponting said. 

I think money has always been an issue. Now they have this huge amount of money, they need to look after it and spend it in the right way, he added. 

Ponting also felt Brian Laras men failed to cope with the pressure of playing at home. 

I think they have probably felt a bit of the pressure being at home in this World Cup, and being spoken about a fair bit as one of the real contenders. 

But West Indies great Larry Gomes has accused the hosts of lacking the love for the game despite playing in front of their home crowd. 

In the first game we played well, we looked like world champions. After that, although we won other games, we didnt look well at all, Gomes said.

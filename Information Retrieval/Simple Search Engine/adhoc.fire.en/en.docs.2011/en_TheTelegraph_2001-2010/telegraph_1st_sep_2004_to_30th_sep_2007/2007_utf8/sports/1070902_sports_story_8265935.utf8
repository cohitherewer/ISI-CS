The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Warne rates Sachin No. 1

A STAFF REPORTER

 Sachin 

Calcutta: Shane Warne named Sachin Tendulkar as his greatest cricketer, the Indian pipping Brian Lara to the top spot in the Australians final instalment of his top 50 cricketers in his column in The Times, London. 

The following are excerpts: 

10) Ian Healy (Australia) 

Test matches 119; Runs 4,356 at 27.39; Catches 366; 

Stumpings 29 

He was the best wicketkeeper I saw. I cant remember him making a mistake during the 1993 Ashes series either standing up to the spinners or back to the quicks. 

9) Mark Taylor (Australia) 

Test matches 104; Runs 7,525 at 43.49 

I played under four Australia captains but Tubby was the pick. He seemed to have an instinct for what was right. 

8) Ricky Ponting (Australia) 

Test matches 110; Runs 9,368 at 59.29 

By the time he finishes I think Ricky will have smashed all Test batting records. He can play for at least another two Ashes series. He is a really athletic fielder and an excellent captain. 

7) Muttiah Muralidharan (Sri Lanka) 

Test matches 113; Wickets 700 at 21.33 

No matter what anybody thinks about his action, he is wonderful to bat against for the experience of facing a ball that turns so much. He has helped to turn Sri Lanka into a formidable side at home. And we all love that smile. 

6) Wasim Akram (Pakistan) 

Test matches 104; Wickets 414 at 23.62; Runs 2,898 at 22.64 

Being a left-armer gave an advantage but the ability to swing the ball from over or round the wicket, reverse or conventional, puts him among the great bowlers of my time. 

5) Glenn McGrath (Australia) 

Test matches 124; Wickets 563 at 21.64 

He kept everything simple but effective. Although batsmen knew exactly what McGrath was about, he still beat them almost every time. He had that ability to take the big wicket and his longevity was incredible. 

4) Allan Border (Australia) 

Test matches 156; Runs 11,174 at 50.56 

AB is the top Australian in my list. I probably learnt more from him than anybody bar Ian Chappell. The toughest cricketer I have played with, he was also an outstanding batsman. 

3) Curtly Ambrose (West Indies) 

Test matches 98; Wickets 405 at 20.99 

It was very difficult to split Curtly and Glenn McGrath, but I think Curtly had that extra half-gear as well as being just as accurate and clinical. He could take your head off if he wanted, and he did have that nasty streak. 

2) Brian Lara (West Indies) 

Test matches 131; Runs 11,953 at 52.88 

Whether you played with him or against him, you were in awe of Brian Charles Lara. I loved his strut, his swagger and his ability to hit four after four. He had an amazing knack of playing match-winning innings all through his career. 

1) Sachin Tendulkar (India) 

Test matches 140; Runs 11,150 at 54.92 

You have to watch India in India truly to appreciate the pressure that Sachin Tendulkar is under every time he bats. Outside the grounds, people wait until he goes in before paying to enter. They seem to want a wicket to fall even though it is their own side that will suffer. He grew up under incredible weight of expectation and never buckled once not under poor umpiring decisions or anything else. I place him very slightly ahead of Lara because I found him slightly tougher mentally. I have been lucky to get to know him off the field as well. He is quiet and humble. A great player and a great man.

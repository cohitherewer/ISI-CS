 Sarfraz notice to Ashraf 

 SHARP SINGLES 

Karachi: Former pacer Sarfraz Nawaz has sent a legal notice to the Pakistan Cricket Board chairman, Dr Nasim Ashraf, demanding a public apology or Rs 100 million as compensation for calling him an anti-Pakistani. He called me a person of low background (bazari) and said I was not a Pakistani. I have sent him a legal notice, Sarfraz said on Sunday. If he doesnt apologise publicly, my lawyer has informed him in the notice that he will have to face a suit for damages of Rs 100 million, he said. 

Arnold tragedy

Colombo: Sri Lankas middle order batsman Russel Arnold is likely to return home ahead of the game against New Zealand in Grenada on Thursday to attend the funeral of a close relative, a family member said on Sunday. Arnolds brother-in-law was run over by a train here on Saturday. Police said the victim appeared not to have heard the incoming train while speaking on a mobile phone at that time. Arnolds travel plans are still to be clear, but a family member said he was trying to return home depending on the availability of flights.

Watson boost

St Johns: Australia allrounder Shane Watson may return to action in the Super Eight game against New Zealand. Watson had to leave the field midway through the game versus Bangladesh. Scans revealed no major damage, but Watson has been sidelined since. Captain Ricky Ponting said, however, he could even make it for the April 20 match against New Zealand. I think originally everyone was hoping Shane will be ready in time for the semi-final, but now it seems he might even play the last Super Eight game, Ponting said. (Agencies)

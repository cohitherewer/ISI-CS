The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Reports will take two months

London: The investigations into Bob Woolmers murder have suffered a setback with the police revealing that they may have to wait for another two months to get the toxicology reports of the former Pakistan coach. 

The tests are crucial for ascertaining the exact time and cause of Woolmers death. 

Its in everyones interest to know exactly when he died and how. But frustrating as it may be, science goes at a certain pace, Jamaicas deputy commissioner of police, Mark Shields, said. 

Despite recent media reports expressing doubts about the polices assertion of the death being a murder, the investigators remain adamant that Woolmer was strangulated to death and say factors known only to them suggest foul play. 

The Jamaica police will also be sending a team to Pakistan to question the countrys cricketers after ambiguities came to light in their initial statements to the police. 

Woolmers death shocked the global cricket fraternity and cast a pall over the World Cup, being played in nine Caribbean countries to the end of April. 

Speculation within cricket over the killing has focused on everyone from crazed fans to a gambling mafia. 

Shields said police were no closer to identifying a motive but that he would assign officers to an ICC probe into whether Woolmers murder was linked to match-fixing. (AGENCIES)

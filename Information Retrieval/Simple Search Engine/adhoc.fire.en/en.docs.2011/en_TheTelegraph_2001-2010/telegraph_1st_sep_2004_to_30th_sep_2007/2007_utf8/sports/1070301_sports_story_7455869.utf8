London: Manchester United scored three times in the first six minutes to reach the English FA Cup quarter finals with a 3-2 win over Reading on Tuesday. 

Gabriel Heinze, Louis Saha and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer all scored in the fifth-round replay at the Madejski Stadium. 

The Red Devils withstood a late surge from Reading, which missed the chance to push the game into extra time when Brynjar Gunnarsson hit the crossbar in injury time. 

It was crash, bang, wallop, Reading manager Steve Coppell said. I have never been three goals down so quickly before. We have no excuses. It was a really sloppy start. 

United next will play Middlesbrough, which beat 10-man League Championship club West Bromwich Albion 5-4 on penalty kicks in their fifth-round replay. 

We kept giving them lifeline after lifeline, and when they scored a second with six or seven minutes to go anything could have happened, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said. In the end, we managed to ride our luck and we have come through a magnificent cup tie. 

Heinze took a cross from John Shea to score past Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici, who failed to stop the ball going under his body in the second minute. 

Saha doubled the lead two minutes later, chesting forward a cross from Rio Ferdinand and beating Federici with an angled shot. 

Solskjaer completed Uniteds scoring in the sixth minute, beating the offside trap to collect a pass from Kieran Richardson and putting a shot with the outside of his left foot into the far-side netting. 

Reading rallied with a close-range header from Dave Kitson in the 23rd. The Royals kept pushing forward, and Ferguson reacted by sending on Wayne Rooney in the 76th for Saha. 

Leroy Lita pulled Reading within a goal in the 84th, heading in Ulises de la Cruzs cross just inside the right post. 

Darren Carter curled a low shot into the corner of the net in the 26th minute for West Brom after taking a pass from Nathan Ellington. 

Mark Viduka equalised for Middlesbrough in the 63rd minute, his shot deflecting off Curtis Davies before entering the net. It was the ninth goal in 2007 for the Australian striker and pushed the game into extra time. Ellington was sent off three minutes in for a tackle on Stuart Parnaby. 

Extra time also ended 1-1 and the game went to penalty kicks. 

Middlesbrough advanced when West Broms Sherjill MacDonald sent his spot kick over the bar. George Boateng, Ayegbeni Yakubu, Julio Arca, James Morrisson and Stewart Downing all converted for Middlesbrough, while Dong Gook-lee sent his wide. (AP)

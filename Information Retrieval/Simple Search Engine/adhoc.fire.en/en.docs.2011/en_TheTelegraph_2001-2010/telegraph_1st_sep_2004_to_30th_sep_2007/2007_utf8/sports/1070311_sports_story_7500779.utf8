The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Most organised captain has best chance: Arjuna

 - Keeping players motivated biggest challenge 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Every captain will have to be more creative and flexible than he has ever been The World Cup is going to demand that, Team India coach Greg Chappell observed not many days ago. 

On Saturday, 1996 World Cup-winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga made the point that the one most organised had the best chance of succeeding in the showpiece event which gets underway on Tuesday. 

Clearly, the pressure on the Rahul Dravids is enormous. 

Given the duration of the World Cup (49 days), the captain who is most organised will be most successful, Ranatunga told The Telegraph. 

Speaking from Colombo before setting out for London (his TV assignment-driven base during the World Cup), he added: In my view, keeping players motivated for that many days is going to be the biggest challenge Being up for it over such a long period may not be easy. 

Thats some food for thought. Some teams, in fact, have already been there for close to a fortnight. 

Reflecting on Sri Lankas remarkable show 11 years ago, Ranatunga said: We took it match by match We set small goals and I made sure my players found the time to switch off, which is as important as switching on 

Asked if there was a formula for success, he replied: Wouldnt say theres one Of course, a lot of factors come into play Besides being very well organised and keeping players motivated, one must lead from the front Thats what I believed in 

Not just that, no matter what the situation, a captain has to be positive Also, I suppose he should have the confidence to attempt new things Be proactive A captain doesnt need stars, but players whore committed to giving one hundred per cent each time they take the field. 

Ranatunga (a politician for some years now) is among those who know captaincy best.

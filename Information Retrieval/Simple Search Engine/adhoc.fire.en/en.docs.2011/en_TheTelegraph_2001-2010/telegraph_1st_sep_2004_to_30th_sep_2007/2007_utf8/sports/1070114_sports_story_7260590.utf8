 SA, Pak share Day III honours

 - FIRST TEST Asif (5/89) steals Princes (138) thunder 

 Ashwell Prince in Centurion on Saturday 

Centurion: Pakistans Mohammed Asif took five wickets to lessen the impact of Ashwell Princes century for South Africa on Day Three of the first Test on Saturday. 

Pakistan were 103 for two in their second innings, a deficit of one run, when bad light ended play 13 overs early. Jacques Kallis grabbed two wickets but an unbeaten 41 from Imran Farhat steadied the tourists. 

South Africa were dismissed for 417 in reply to Pakistans first innings of 313. 

Prince scored 138, while fast bowler Asif, playing his first match for his country since he and Shoaib Akhtar tested positive for the banned steroid Nandrolone in November, took five for 89. 

Prince, who took guard when South Africas third wicket fell six overs after lunch on Friday, was finally removed when leg-spinner Danish Kaneria had him stumped by wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal. 

The left-handed Prince advanced down the pitch to Kaneria and failed to make contact. Akmal gathered cleanly but missed with his first swipe at the stumps. Prince scrambled back towards safety, but Akmal removed the bails just in time to send the South African packing. 

The patient, diligent Prince batted for almost six hours in which he faced 214 balls and hit 19 fours. 

His dismissal ended a dominating fifth-wicket stand of 213 that he shared with Herschelle Gibbs. Princes demise also began a slide in which five wickets tumbled for 35 runs in 11 overs. 

Among them was Gibbs, who was seventh out for 94 when he was trapped in front by fast bowler Naved-ul Hasan. 

South Africas chances of building a lead seemed to be on the wane, but Shaun Pollock scored a brisk unbeaten 39 off 58 balls with five fours and a six to extend the home sides advantage to 104 runs. 

Asif completed his five-wicket haul when he had Makhaya Ntini caught by Younis Khan at second slip for five to end the innings. 

Pakistan were 23 without loss in their second innings when Farhat, on seven, cut hard at a delivery from fast bowler Andre Nel and survived a difficult chance in the gully, where Gibbs leapt high but couldnt hold on. 

Kallis struck with his third delivery of the innings when he drew Mohammed Hafeez, who scored 15, into an edge to Graeme Smith at first slip. 

Kallis claimed his second wicket six overs later when Yasir Hameed steered a thin edge to wicketkeeper Mark Boucher to be dismissed for nine.

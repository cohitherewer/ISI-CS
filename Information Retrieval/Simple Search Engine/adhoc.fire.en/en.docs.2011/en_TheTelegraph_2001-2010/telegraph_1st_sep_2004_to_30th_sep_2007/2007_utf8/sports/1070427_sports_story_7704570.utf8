The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Lankans may have stolen a march with canny planning

It has looked for weeks as though Sri Lanka alone

 could give Australia a serious contest in this World Cup. Now we shall see. 

Sri Lankas three best bowlers Chaminda Vaas, Muttiah Muralidharan and Lasith Malinga did not play the Super Eight game that Australia won easily earlier in the tournament. It seems the underdogs have stolen a march with canny planning by their confident Australian coach, Tom Moody. 

Australia do, however, look close to invincible. Wednesdays win extended their run of World Cup victories to 22, stretching back to a defeat by Pakistan at Edgbaston on May 23, 1999. They have reached the final without losing more than six wickets in any game in this tournament and have never failed to score 300 when batting first. 

Hayden, superman without the official vest, restrained himself with his usual stern discipline to make sure that they overcame the early loss of Gilchrist and then, before they had got a third of the way to their 150, of Ponting. 

It is an extraordinary thought that, only in January, Michael Hussey got to the top of the international one-day batting ratings. The poor fellow has hardly been needed in this World Cup, but I bet he will score runs if they are really needed in Bridgetown on Saturday. 

 Lasith Malinga

The impeccable Glenn McGrath made it easy for Australia. His six-over new ball spell was, as usual, intelligent and harrying, using the breeze to swing the ball and perfectly complemented by Nathan Brackens left-arm swing. The key wicket was that of Jacques Kallis, who failed to spot that having been persuaded to be more aggressive, the situation called, instead, for one of his familiar binding innings. 

Thinking on your feet is one of the great arts of the one-day game. The Australians do it both by instinct and experience. Michael Clarke played a mature innings to see them through to their third successive final and is hard to imagine anyone else taking over from Ponting as captain when the time comes. 

Perhaps, by then, Australia will be seeking their fifth World Cup triumph in succession. But they will not, as usual, be looking beyond Saturday. 

South Africa were never in the game from the moment Graeme Smith tried to hit over the top of the off-side and missed. 

 I think Sri Lanka will test Australia more seriously.

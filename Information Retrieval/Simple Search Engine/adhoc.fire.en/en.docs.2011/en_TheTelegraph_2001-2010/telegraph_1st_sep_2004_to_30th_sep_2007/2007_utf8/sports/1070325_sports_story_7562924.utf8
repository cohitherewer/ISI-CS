The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We havent written off India: Mahela

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Port of Spain: Mahela Jayawardene is sympathising with India. He is reminded of their fate during the Champions Trophy last year. 

I think India are a brilliant side Theres no doubt about that. The numbers show that. The class is there and they have been playing some really good cricket over the past year, said the Sri Lankan captain. 

Its unfortunate when you have two bad days, and it can happen in a tournament like this. When you are playing in a World Cup, it is very tough. We came to play here with the same pressure as well. We knew we couldnt have any hiccups. If you have a bad day against Bangladesh, or Bermuda or India, you can be kicked out. Thats what happened to us in the Champions Trophy. 

Jayawardene felt the Indians too had their moments Friday. I dont think we dominated the whole game, like we did against Bangladesh. In patches, we played some really good cricket. Obviously when you are playing against India, you cant have things going your way all the time. We were under pressure too specially when we lost three quick wickets. We had to fight hard from difficult situations. In the end, we managed to create a bit more pressure and get those wickets. 

Jayawardene still believes India have a chance if Bermuda beat Bangladesh. We havent written off India, he said. 

How many wins would you need in the Super Eight? 

It is quite difficult to say right now, but I reckon three or four wins would probably secure a spot in the top-four. But we want to keep winning. We are trying to improve ourselves everyday, and if we have to do that, we have to keep winning. We want to continue doing that. 

Sri Lanka had an injury scare when Chaminda Vaas dislocated his little finger while fielding. 

He put it back in place himself. We had a precautionary X-ray done and everything is fine. He will be available for the next match, manager Michael Tissera told The Telegraph. 

Man-of-the-Match Muttiah Muralidharan was more happy for his fielding than his bowling. 

I have been trying to improve my fielding. Thats what I want, because everyone in the team sometimes think I am too old. So I wanted to prove a point. I want to show that Im still good, he quipped.

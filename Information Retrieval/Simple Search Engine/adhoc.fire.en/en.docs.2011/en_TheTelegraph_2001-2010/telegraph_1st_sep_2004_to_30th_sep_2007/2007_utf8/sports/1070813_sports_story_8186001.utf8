 Ojha spins India A to win

Mombasa: A six-wicket haul by Pragyan Ojha spinned India A to a thumping innings and 87-run win over Kenya on the third day of the three-day tour match on Sunday. 

Resuming at four for two at the Mombasa Sports Club ground, Kenya crumbled against the left-arm spin of Ojha to be bowled out for 124 in their second innings. 

Jimmy Kamande offered some resistance with a 46-ball 30 but it was always going to be an uphill task for Kenya after they lost the top six batsmen for a paltry 73. 

Pankaj Singh bowled tightly giving away 14 runs from his 10 overs, though did not pick a wicket. 

Test discard Irfan Pathan claimed three for 26. 

Badrinath was adjudged Man-of-the-Match. 

 BRIEF SCORES 

India A 429 for 5 decl. Kenya 218 and 124 (Ojha 6/31). India A won by an innings and 87 runs.

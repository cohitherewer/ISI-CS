 Henin dismisses Kuznetsova

How many times does Justine Henin have to win the US Open for people to get her name right? You had to feel for the top-seeded Henin on Saturday night. Minutes after dismantling No. 4 Svetlana Kuznetsova of Russia 6-1, 6-3 in the womens final with a purposeful display of all-court tennis, she heard the last name of her soon-to-be ex-husband. 

CBS Dick Enberg accidentally called her Justine Henin-Hardenne near the end of the on-court awards ceremony, in which she received $1.4 million for winning the title. It was the seventh Grand Slam singles championship for the 25-year-old and her second title in New York. Ouch. 

Henin didnt wince, but her expression showed it hit home. After all, divorce proceedings, and the public nature of her split with Pierre-Yves, prevented her from going to the Australian Open in January. 

Later, Henin was asked about that moment on the court. No, I dont care about that, she said. Its been a big part of my life and I have to accept it. It was okay for me. I heard it. 

Did it signify how far she has come after the tough start to 2007? Yeah, maybe, but I didnt think that much on that at that time, she said. I just wanted to enjoy every moment. Its a little mistake, but it doesnt change my joy. 

Enberg was not alone. An official from JPMorgan Chase inexplicably called her Christine during the trophy ceremony when she won her first US Open in 2003, beating Kim Clijsters in the final. 

This time, she did not drop a set in seven matches. But that shouldnt suggest she wasnt tested. 

Along the way, Henin beat both Williams sisters in tense matches and became the only player to win a Grand Slam title while beating the sisters in the same event. In 2001, Martina Hingis beat Serena and Venus in the Australian Open but fell short at the last hurdle, losing to Capriati in the final. 

This one is maybe the most important one, Henin said. The quality I played in the last few matches is amazing. Its just a great feeling because I had a tough draw and I had a lot of things to prove to myself not to anyone else, just to myself. And I did it. 

Henin was aggressive from the outset, breaking serve at 30 in the opening game. Kuznetsova seemed overwhelmed, falling behind 0-4, and did not win a game until 24 minutes into the match. In particular, her forehand broke down against Henin. 

When she plays her best game, I have to play my best game, said Kuznetsova, who won here in 2004. I didnt play my best game, so thats why I lost I felt I just didnt move to the ball well enough because I was pretty tight. 

Tightness and nerves did not hit Henin, at least visibly, until the final game. Serving for it, she double-faulted thrice, including back to back times and looked unnerved when a fan shouted between her first and second serves. 

Still, she saved three break points and won the championship by serving and volleying on match point.

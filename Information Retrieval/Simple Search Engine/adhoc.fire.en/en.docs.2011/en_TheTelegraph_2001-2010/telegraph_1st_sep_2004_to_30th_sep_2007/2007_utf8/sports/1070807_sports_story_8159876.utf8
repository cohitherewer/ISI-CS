 Jeev Milkha ends 51st

Akron (US): Jeev Milkha Singh managed to card a 76 in the final round of the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational Golf Championship on Sunday to finish in 51st spot. 

Jeev, the Asian Tour No. 1 in 2006, aggregated a 14-over 294 at the Firestone Golf Club. 

Tiger Woods carded a sizzling five-under 65 to cruise to an eight-shot win. 

Jeev double bogeyed the first and fourth holes and birdied the second and sixth. Bogeys on the 11th, 14th, 16th and the 18th ended any hope of recovery. 

South Koreas Choi Kyung-ju carded a one-over-par 71 to finish tied 11th. The Asian Tour graduate, a two-time winner on the US Tour this season, completed the week with a four-over 284. 

Thailands Thongchai Jaidee closed out with a 71 for a share of 46th place with 293. 

Another South Korean, Yang Yong-eun, stumbled to a 78 and finished in 56th place with a total of 295. 

 Chinas Liang Wen-Chong, the current leader of the UBS Order of Merit, ended in tied 61st place after a disappointing final round of five-over par 75.

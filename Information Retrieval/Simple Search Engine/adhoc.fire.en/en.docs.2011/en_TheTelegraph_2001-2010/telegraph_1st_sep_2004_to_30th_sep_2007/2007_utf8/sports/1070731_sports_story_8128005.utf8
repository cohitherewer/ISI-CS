The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Md. Sp. open today

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: East Bengal cleared their first Premier Division hurdle on Monday with one foreigner. Another city giant, Mohammedan Sporting, will kick-off their campaign against Peerless sans any foreigner on Tuesday. 

We called a few players for the trials, but none was up to the mark. So we decided to wait, Mohammedan Sporting coach Shabbir Ali said on the eve of the match. 

The coach hopes that two or three good foreign players will be here in a couple of days and will be able to play for them after a few matches. Players from Ghana and Nigeria are targeted, according to Shabbir. 

The black-and-whites will miss the services of Roque Barreto, Shyju K, Prem Kumar and Tapan Giri in their opener, all of who are on the injury list. 

Those four players will be available from the next match, Shabbir stated. 

The coach is, however, satisfied with the preparation of the side.

 Action man on a mission

SCYLD BERRY

 Peter Moores 

Tuesday, when England cricketers assemble at Lords to prepare for the opening Test against West Indies, which starts on Thursday, their normally closed ranks will have to open to receive a 44 year-old, silvery-grey-haired newcomer of striking effervescence. Peter Moores has succeeded Duncan Fletcher as Englands coach after another of their World Cup campaigns if that is not too strong a term resulted in Fletchers resignation. 

Mooress effervescence did not come across on television when he gave his first interview after his appointment; he seemed to have been given official advice to be bland. It is, however, his natural condition. When Moores kept wicket at Lords for MCC Schools in 1981 which was about as near as he came to national honours in the sort of playing career known as journeyman he made a lasting impression on his captain, Hugh Morris, now deputy chief executive of the ECB, who recalls: Peter was very energetic, a naturally enthusiastic and uplifting bloke. When Moores joined the MCC groundstaff the following year, his nickname was Action. 

The formative influence on him appears to have been that he was the fourth of five sports-keen sons, who all shared a bedroom in his native Macclesfield I learned to scrap for my food. 

In addition to this vitality, Moores also has luck on his side. His first assignment is a four-Test series against West Indies; a once-great edifice turned to rubble. If the tourists, who have been given even less time to prepare than Moores has, should win the first Test at Lords and it would be their first real win away from home since 2000 they will still have three more Tests up North in a climate alien to those from the Caribbean. 

Secondly, Moores last week was able to slip his right-hand man into place just in time, so that he will not enter the England dressing-room alone to face the players and the back-room staff assembled by Fletcher. 

Andy Flower, having averaged 51 for Zimbabwe, supplies the international experience, and a tough colonial edge. If you were an England cricketer in a late-night bar in St Lucia during a World Cup and Moores came up to tell you to go to bed, you might be tempted to put an arm around him and say: Pete, mate, what can I get you? Go on, just a half. If Flower approached you he would speak so quietly and so deliberately that you would probably retire without another sip. 

His coaching experience has been limited to eight years at Sussex and two at the Academy but he is not naive. Whenever a question about Andrew Flintoff came along, he spotted the googly and swiftly moved from the particular to the general so as not to give the tabloids a headline. 

Perhaps his toughest challenge will be simply to keep the players going to the end of this summer after their remorseless winter. Moores says: I love the game. It doesnt tire me out. 

But even he might be tested by late August when England play seven one-day internationals against India. Then fly next day to the inaugural Twenty20 World Championship in South Africa and then on to Sri Lanka for a one-day series. 

This summer will tell. Lights. Cameras. Action!

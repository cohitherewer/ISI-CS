 2011 edition unlikely to be shorter: Speed

St Georges: The 2011 World Cup in the Asian sub-continent, despite the criticism of the current one in the Caribbean being unduly lengthy, wouldnt be much shorter, International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive Malcolm Speed has said. 

I will be surprised if we can come up with a solution that will significantly shorten (the next World Cup). This is shorter than South Africa (2003). World Cup is a major one-day event for cricket in four years. It needs to be run across a lengthy time, so that top teams can qualify at the end of it, said Speed. 

Speed then went about backing his assertion with some facts. 

There has been criticism for the length of the tournament. The team that gets to the final plays 11 matches in 47 days, its one match every four and a quarter day. 

India this year will go to England and play 22 days of cricket in 57 days. They will play every three days, one day of cricket. Thats twice as many days of cricket as compared to World Cup. And they are going to be there 10 days longer. 

Now if you are playing one day for very four days thats pretty reasonable. 

We also need rain days. We need the rain days to maximise the chances of matches being determined on their merit. 

The ICC chief executive countered the argument that the minnows growing participation was spoiling the meet. In South Africa we had 14 teams and four associate nations. We had two groups of seven. So Namibia and Holland played six matches, Speed said. Here we tried to guarantee the associate nations only three matches. Then we moved to the Super Eight round. 

Why shouldnt the World Cup be a long event? Its good for cricket that the World Cup goes on for a long period of time and sustains interest all around the world. 

I am disappointed that it is seen as a negative. It is often seen as a negative in the countries that have been eliminated. Your country loses interest, so you say this is going on and on and on. 

Speeds attention was then drawn to Australian opener Matthew Haydens comment that the World Cup was too long. If Matthew Hayden wasnt playing the World Cup here, then he would have been playing 4 Tests and 7 ODIs over 10 weeks, the ICC chief responded. 

Instead of that he comes here and plays, where it is televised all over the world with huge prize money and he plays one match every four days. He is a professional cricketer. 

Speed reacted to the criticism that the West Indies team was made to play around in more islands than other teams in the Super Eight round. Thats the way the cricket experts did the draw. West Indies wanted to play in each of the countries, West Indies have signed up on that schedule before, it was approved. 

Speed was sharp in his reply to remarks that the ICC had done a bad job with the World Cup and looked at only their benefit from this premier event of the game. 

Lets get some facts right. We dont take one penny of the gate revenue. Gate revenue is set by West Indies board after talking to the local organising committee in each country. 

Our only suggestion was that whatever the bottom price, make more seats available. So please dont accuse us of fixing the ticket prices. 

As for the Caribbean flavour missing from the World Cup because of strict ICC regulation on music bands playing at the stadium, Speed asserted to the contrary. It is possible for people to bring their musical instruments for the matches. Yes during the India-Sri Lanka game in Port of Spain there was no noise. But that was because the Indian team was playing badly. (PTI)

 Latin quarter gets ready 

 for Becks

 - Golden boy of English football in the US

 David Beckham 

Los Angeles: The Los Angeles Galaxy boasts a legion of Latino fans, wowed by generations of high-profile Latin American players from Pele to Diego Maradona to Hugo Sanchez. 

But those fans appear ready to embrace someone from outside their barrio David Beckham, the golden boy of English and European soccer who arrives in L.A. this week for his official Galaxy presentation. 

Beckhams awesome. I cant wait for him to come, said Javier Vallejo, 25, outside the Galaxys home stadium in Carson, California before the Major League Soccer (MLS) game against the Kansas City Wizards. 

The Los Angeles population is roughly one-half Hispanic, thanks to waves of migrants mostly from Mexico and Central America. The citys parks are filled on weekends with organised games and players sporting jerseys from their home countries. For Vallejo, a soccer coach, the quality of a player matters more than where he is from. 

I just want to watch soccer, said Vallejo, whose parents moved to the US from Guatemala and Ecuador. And I think Beckham can bring good soccer. 

Galaxy club president Alexi Lalas, who estimates the Hispanic element of the teams fan base to be around 50 percent, agreed. 

David Beckham, unlike any other player, transcends all of these boundaries, he said. 

I would argue that whether you are a housewife from Orange County or a person of Mexican heritage living in Los Angeles, you know who David Beckham is. 

If we were to go out and get an internationally renowned South American star, I would argue that although the person of Mexican descent may know who he is, the housewife in Orange County wouldnt. And that is the difference. 

Beckham is widely recognised outside the sport for his fashion and celebrity lifestyle and Galaxy fans seem just as excited for their team to be getting Beckham the icon as they are for Beckham the player. 

I think its really important to have a big personality like David Beckham come and play, said Diego Sologuren, 25, who was born and raised in Peru. Sologuren hopes Beckhams move to MLS will open the door for other top international players to join the US teams. 

Especially in South America, theres this boundary that says that if you go play in the US you wont be seen by the rest of the world, said Sologuren.

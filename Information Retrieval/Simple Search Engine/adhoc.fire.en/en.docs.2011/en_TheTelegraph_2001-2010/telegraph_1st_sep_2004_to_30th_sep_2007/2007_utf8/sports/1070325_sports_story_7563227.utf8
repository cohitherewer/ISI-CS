 Pak, England settle dispute

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has resolved the compensation dispute with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) which threatened to affect their cordial relations, a PCB official said on Saturday. 

Pakistan will now play a Twenty20 Cup match on their tour of England in 2012 to compensate the hosts for the loss of revenues they suffered last year in the Oval Test, the official said. 

The official said a meeting with ECB officials in London this week had been successful in resolving the dispute.

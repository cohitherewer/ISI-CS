The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A chance encounter

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Calcutta Cricket and Football Club (CC amp;FC) is among the Indian Cricket Leagues (ICL) shortlisted possible venues for the Twenty20 matches. 

The ICLs project head Himanshu Mody was in town on Saturday, and accompanied by Easts talent spotter Pranab Roy, visited the CC amp;FC. 

Till a few years ago, the CC amp;FC regularly hosted Ranji Trophy matches. 

Mody also had a chance meeting with former BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya. 

Given Dalmiyas equation (or the lack of it) with those currently running the BCCI, tongues are sure to wag. 

Mody, however, couldnt meet sports minister Subhas Chakraborty. 

The fact that he was here to meet Chakraborty suggests that he would have made a formal request to use some of the grounds owned by the state government. 

It may be recalled that the sports minister has promised to make the state-owned grounds available to the ICL.

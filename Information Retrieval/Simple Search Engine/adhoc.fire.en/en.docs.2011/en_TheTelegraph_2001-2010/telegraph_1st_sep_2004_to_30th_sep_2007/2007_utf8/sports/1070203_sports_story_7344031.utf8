 Munaf advised to undergo MRI scan

Mumbai: Speedster Munaf Patel was on Friday advised to undergo a second MRI scan by BCCI consultant physician Dr Anant Joshi, before a decision on his fitness to feature in the ODI series against Sri Lanka is taken on Saturday. 

We examined Munaf today (Friday). He did a strenuous workout and did not feel any pain in the ankle. Clinically, everything is okay, said Dr Joshi. 

Still, to have an objective view on the issue, we have advised him to undergo another MRI scan which can be compared to the previous one. The report will be ready by 9:30 or 10 am, after which we will give it to BCCI, Dr Joshi said. 

The squad for the first two ODIs against Sri Lanka will be chosen on Saturday.

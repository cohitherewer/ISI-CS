 Gerrards Liverpool loyalty

Tim Rich

By the time Liverpools Champions League final kicks off in a weeks time, Steven Gerrard expects to have signed a contract that will ensure his peak years are played out at Anfield. 

The Liverpool captain is in the final stages of agreeing a revised four-year deal that will keep one of the icons of Anfield on Merseyside until he is 31 at an estimated salary of 6.2 million a year, which would make him Englands highest-paid footballer. 

Unlike negotiations over his previous contract that is due to expire in 2009, this has been a straightforward affair without the temptations of Chelsea. 

Talks are progressing well and I am ready to sign, Gerrard said before leaving for Liverpools Spanish training camp in La Manga. I have told the club I want to stay and as soon as a contract is put in front of me, I will sign it. 

As a player you want to be as successful as possible, so this is an exciting time to be at the club. There is a new stadium, financial backing off the pitch and the team is progressing well. 

This is our second Champions League final in three years and next season there will be a big improvement in the league.

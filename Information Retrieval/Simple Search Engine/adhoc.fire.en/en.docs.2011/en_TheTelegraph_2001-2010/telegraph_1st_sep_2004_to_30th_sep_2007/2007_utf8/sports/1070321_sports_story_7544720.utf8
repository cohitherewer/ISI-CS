 Now ECB fines two coaches

Gros Islet: Two England coaches, who went drinking with players 48 hours before their World Cup match against Canada, were fined on Tuesday. 

Bowling coach Kevin Shine and Jeremy Snape a psychologist for spin bowlers Monty Panesar and Jamie Dalrymple were both in the Rumours night club with five players, hours after Englands six-wicket loss to New Zealand on Friday. 

Fast bowlers James Anderson, Liam Plunkett and Jon Lewis, wicketkeeper Paul Nixon and batsman Ian Bell were fined on Saturday. England allrounder Andrew Flintoff was also briefly at Rumours, and later took a small pedal boat out into the ocean while drunk. 

He was suspended for Englands 51-run win over Canada on Sunday and told by team management that he would not captain England at the World Cup, even if injury-plagued skipper Michael Vaughan is sidelined. 

Shine, a permanent member of the England staff, was also warned about his future conduct. Snape was brought in just before the World Cup, with his contract scheduled to end after the group stage. 

The decision to fine the two staffers came after meetings on Tuesday between coach Duncan Fletcher, ECB deputy chief executive Hugh Morris and the two coaches. (AP)

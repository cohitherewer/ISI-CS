 A collective mistake: Jeff Crowe

Bridgetown: World Cup Match Referee Jeff Crowe admitted on Saturday that Sri Lanka had been mistakenly asked to come back on the field for a final three overs in the rain-reduced World Cup final against Australia. 

Australia were celebrating their third consecutive World Cup victory after the Sri Lanka batsmen had gone off because of bad light, when the teams were told they would have to complete the final three overs or come back on Sunday to finish the match. 

The game, in fact, had already been completed under international rules because Sri Lanka had batted the minimum 20 of their allotted 36 overs and failed to reach the target. 

Crowe told a news conference that the highly-experienced umpiring team of on-field referees Steve Bucknor and Aleem Dar, the third and fourth umpires Rudi Koertzen and Billy Bowden and Crowe himself would take collective responsibility for the error. 

It was a mistake, said Crowe, who indicated that Koertzen had first suggested the game could continue on Sunday. Rudi was talking about the allowances and obviously he was talking about the possibility of tomorrow and we were all there and Steve Bucknor heard the same information and so did Aleem Dar. 

I dont think it was Rudis mistake, I think it was a collective mistake. The fact that maybe Rudi might have suggested it early doesnt mean the other umpires couldnt have over-ruled him. 

The two on-field umpires are the ones that are actually controlling the match, said Crowe. (Reuters)

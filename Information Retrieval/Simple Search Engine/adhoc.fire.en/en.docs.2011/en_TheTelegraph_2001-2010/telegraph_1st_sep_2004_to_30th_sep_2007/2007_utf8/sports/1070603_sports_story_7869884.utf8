 Becks back on familiar ground 

 Alan Smith 

Thats what hes there for. Nothing much has changed, despite a period in exile that could have easily turned permanent. Fitter? Stronger? Better equipped for the task than he was last June? None of those questions really matter anymore after David Beckham dipped his shoulder and curled a trademark free-kick on Friday night into the path of John Terrys grateful head. 

In that instant, Brazils largely untroubled rearguard had not only been breached, the man whose face had filled every newspaper and sports bulletin since the turn of the week had worked his way just a little further into beleaguered Steve McClarens plans. 

This one contribution had brought the midfielder back into the reckoning. On being substituted shortly afterwards to save his legs for the real business Estonia next Wednesday Wembley stood as one to salute an old hero. 

To acknowledge a familiar skill as well the dead ball delivery that very few others in world football can match. Thats what it boiled down to here, just as it did in Germany last summer when the captains input could be summarised by a couple of telling crosses and one vital free-kick. 

No surprises for guessing who received the biggest cheer when Englands team was announced. No surprises either that Beckhams first few touches were greeted the same way predictable, I suppose, under the circumstances, but not entirely healthy in terms of the team ethic. In the eyes of the fans, Goldenballs still stands out as the main man. 

Thankfully, though, things soon settled down in that particular direction as England got used to coming second best to a team inspired by the spectacular Ronaldinho. 

Consequently, Beckham was left with the occasional scrap with which to try and fashion something meaningful. That manifested itself early on in the form of one raking ball from deep that very nearly found the toe of a sprinting Michael Owen that and a couple of free-kicks that came to nothing. 

Shooooot! the crowd boomed, ignoring the fact that Englands No 7 stood a good 50 yards from goal. Much more promising was the moment when a foul on Steven Gerrard led to a free-kick much closer in. 

Again, no surprises for guessing who stood over the ball. He may have been away for a while but Beckhams famous talent at dead-ball situations had obviously pulled rank when the conversation turned in training to who should step up. 

Ninety thousand fans collectively sat forward. Flashbulbs exploded in all corners of the ground, hoping to record a historic moment Englands first senior goal at their shiny new home. 

It looked for an instant as if Beckham had managed it as well with a typically arrowed effort that had Helton diving to his right with no little urgency. Luckily for Brazils goalkeeper, the ball fizzed narrowly wide of the left-hand post. 

Then came the goal to justify McClarens gamble in bringing the old boy back. It was nothing overtly spectacular, nothing we havent seen a thousand times before, merely one mans ability to land a football exactly where he wants. 

So how valuable is that to a coach like McClaren who knows any slip-ups in Tallinn will more than likely cost him his job? Priceless, Id say, under the circumstances. If Beckham can reproduce another cross on Wednesday that leads to a goal, if he can do just enough to secure three points, his reintroduction, without doubt, will have served its purpose.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Boost for loyalists ahead of AGM

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Many at the CAB headquarters heaved sighs of relief on Friday when it was made official that Jagmohan Dalmiya would not contest the presidents post. 

It now means that the city police commissioner and incumbent, Prasun Mukherjee, will remain president for another term. The Dalmiya-backers, however, have already started drawing strength from the high courts verdict. 

If Dalmiya had decided to throw his hat into the ring, it would have sent a wrong message to the members that he was power hungry. The positive court order is an inspiration for us and it will definitely help us in the elections, said a Dalmiya loyalist. 

Another senior CAB member admitted that Dalmiyas presence as a candidate wouldve landed most in a spot of bother. An awkward situation was avoided for a number of members, who were formerly close to Dalmiya, but now have switched allegiance, and a few others who have preferred to sit on the bench, he said. 

State sports minister Subhas Chakraborty said he had urged Dalmiya not to contest to ensure a friendly environment.

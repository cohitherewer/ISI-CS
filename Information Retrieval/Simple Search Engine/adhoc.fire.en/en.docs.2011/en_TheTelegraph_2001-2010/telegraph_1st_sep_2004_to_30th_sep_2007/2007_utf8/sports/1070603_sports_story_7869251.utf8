 Arjun Atwal at tied 11th 

Glenview (US): Arjun Atwal carded a second round six-under 66 to be at tied 11th at the Lasalle Bank Open on the US Nationwide Tour. 

Veteran Omar Uresti, who shot a bogey-free nine-under 63, led with an 11-under 133. 

Atwal, who was 43rd overnight, started from the back nine and birdied the 10th, 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th holes. He overcame a double bogey on the 18th with an eagle on the first. He then added three more birdies on the second, fifth and sixth. Bogeys on the eighth and ninth holes meant he finished four shots behind Uresti. 

Atwal carded a one-under 71 in the first round on Thursday and has a two-total of seven-under 137. (PTI)

 Armenia hold Portugal 1-1

Yerevan (Armenia): Cristiano Ronaldo scored an equaliser late in the first-half to give Portugal a 1-1 draw with Armenia in a European Championship qualifier on Wednesday. 

Artavazd Karamyan gave the hosts an early lead with a header in the 10th minute. Ronaldo then dribbled past three defenders to score in the 30th. 

Portugal have 15 points after eight games in Group A, four behind group leaders Poland. The World Cup semi-finalists next host Poland on September 8 before facing Serbia four days later. 

Meanwhile, Jacek Krzynowek and Jakub Blaszczykowski scored late in the second-half Wednesday to give Poland a 2-2 draw with Russia in an international friendly. 

Lokomotiv Moscow striker Dmitry Sychev headed in Ivan Saenkos cross from the right in the 21st minute to give the hosts the lead. Roman Pavlyuchenko made it 2-0 in the 34th. 

Experimenting with his line-up, Russia coach Guus Hiddink substituted four players at half-time. Alexei Berezutskiy was injured and replaced in the 56th minute, leaving Russia with only two defenders. 

Krzynowek, left unmarked in front of the goal, scored with a powerful drive from just outside the box in the 73rd minute. 

Four minutes later, Blaszczykowski capitalised on Denis Kolodins sloppy play on the right flank, stole the ball and moved into the box to beat goalkeeper Anton Shunin with low curling kick into the far corner. 

Dariusz Dudka missed a chance to win the game, hitting the crossbar in the 84th minute. 

Both teams regarded the friendly as a warm-up ahead of their European Championship qualifiers.

Bangalore: The Australian team arrived here on Wednesday for the seven-match one-day International series. 

The visitors, who appeared jet-lagged after a flight from Johannesburg to Mumbai via Dubai, were given a traditional welcome at the team hotel, as nadaswaram rent the air. 

The players were welcomed with the customary tilak and garlands as they walked in. There was no media interaction. 

Australia captain Ricky Ponting is slated to address a press conference on Thursday, a local organiser said. 

The first match of the ODI series would be held on Saturday at the M. Chinnaswamy stadium here. 

The tourists are also slated to play a Twenty20 game. 

The last time both teams met was in the recently concluded ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa, where Mahendra Singh Dhonis team beat Australia by 15 runs in the semi-final. 

Meanwhile, with the enormity of Indias success under his leadership sinking in, Dhoni on Wednesday said he was excited but not unduly worried about leading against Australia. 

It would be exciting, especially since it would be our first home series after the World Cup, Dhoni said. 

The 26-year-old, who was appointed ODI captain after Rahul Dravid stepped down earlier this month, said he would look to the senior players for support in the series beginning Saturday. 

There are senior players in the side on whom I can depend. Besides, Yuvi (Yuvraj Singh) and Bhajji (Harbhajan Singh) are also in the side he said in an interview to a TV channel. 

In a related incident, just three days before the inaugural ODI between India and Australia here, the Bangalore Police have accused the faction-ridden Karnataka State Cricket Association, the hosts, of failing to get its act together on the security front. 

Deputy commissioner of police (central), B.N.S. Reddy shot off a letter to the KSCA on Wednesday, warning if something (untoward) happens, you (KSCA) will be held squarely responsible. 

Reddy said that KSCA president and secretary did not bother to attend a meeting called by the Bangalore Police on September 19 to review security measures for the match. 

None of the top KSCA office-bearers attended another subsequent meeting, he said. 

Reddy said the police have made security arrangements, safety of players and taken all precautions.

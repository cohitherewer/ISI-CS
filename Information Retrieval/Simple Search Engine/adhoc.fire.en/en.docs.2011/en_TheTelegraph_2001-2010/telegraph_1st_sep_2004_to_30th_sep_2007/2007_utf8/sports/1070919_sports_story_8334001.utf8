The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Keepers hail Dhoni elevation

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Calcutta: Mahendra Singh Dhonis elevation to the ODI captaincy is a positive development for wicketkeepers in the country, feel those who have donned the big gloves with distinction. 

The Telegraph spoke to four former India wicketkeepers. The following are excerpts (alphabetically): 

DEEP DASGUPTA: Its a positive move but only time will tell how good he turns out as captain. Two vital home series are coming up and I am skeptical of the repercussions in case the results dont go the right way. Its a big ask for Dhoni Even if India dont do well, it shouldnt be the end of the road for Dhoni. 

A wicketkeeper is always closest to the action and knows best what is happening. That way he is always the best judge on the field wicketkeepers are also generally sensible and often referred to as captains of fielding sides. Bowlers are best evaluated by the wicketkeeper Everyone comes up and seeks his opinion on how the wicket is behaving. It helps in planning and executing strategies. 

SYED KIRMANI: Its a wonderful decision Though Ive led in an ODI, a wicketkeeper was never considered captaincy material in my era. Times have obviously changed 

A wicketkeeper is the best judge of the game. He often acts as a guide to batsmen, bowlers and fielders. Because of his position behind the stumps, he can instantly point out the weaknesses in a batsman, guide the bowlers and suggest field placements. Contrary to popular belief, captaincy doesnt add to a wicketkeepers pressure, he is capable of handling the challenges 

Dhoni has shown that he is a good thinker, he has a good temperament too. The experience he has gained in the last couple of years will serve him well. Not many years ago when I was the chairman of selectors, I along with More pressed for specialist wicketkeepers in both forms of the game. The move seems to have paid off 

KIRAN MORE: Its a great move The selectors are obviously looking ahead. Ive always thought him as captaincy material. He was the best choice under the circumstances and I am sure he will do well. 

This is the first time a wicketkeeper has been appointed captain on a regular basis. That is great for the wicketkeepers since they are always in the best position to control the game. The way Dhoni has come up is amazing. His career graph has been on the rise He has a good cricketing brain and I am sure he will not disappoint in his new role. He is one of the few who is always ready to take up challenges. 

CHANDRAKANT PANDIT: The best decision since the seniors werent too keen. Dhoni has been doing well and its an appreciation of his efforts. The man behind the stumps is always best placed He knows what is happening and is aware of what will suit the side best. The selectors have obviously seen his leadership qualities before arriving at the decision. Dhonis elevation will be a boost to promising wicketkeepers in the country.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Were safe

 SHARP SINGLES 

 Gros Islet: Geographical confusion is contributing to the anxiety felt by the families of New Zealand cricketers. Revelations that Bob Woolmer was murdered in Jamaica have sparked a series of concerned phone calls from the Antipodes to the Caribbean. I think back home we regard the West Indies as one country. Were a long way from there, New Zealand team manager Lindsay Crocker said Friday as the team departed from St Lucia to Antigua. Ive been trying to reassure families that everyone is OK and safe. 

No tourists, say hoteliers

Gros Islet: Hoteliers are complaining that the World Cup hasnt brought a rise in occupancy rates. The Beausejour Cricket Ground is the venue for the England-Kenya match and the April 25 semi-final will also be hosted here. We have so far not realised any major impact on our occupancy levels, quot; St Lucia hotel and tourist association spokesman told a local daily on Friday. In fact, the figures are down at some properties because people who would have normally come at this time have stayed away.

Tough task

Kingston: Stand-in Ireland captain Kyle McCallan acknowledges that his side faces a huge challenge in the Super Eight stage. We have the onus on us now to go into the Super Eight and not be the whipping boys, said McCallan. I wouldnt say its the fear, but it would be the one thing that motivates us to go and compete, he said.

 Negi eyes 1st major title

Kirishi (Russia): Parimarjan Negi, who is in a two-way lead at the half-way stage of the World Youth Stars Chess meet here stands a good chance of winning his first major international event. 

The Indian whizkid has garnered 4.5 points out of a possible 6 with three wins and three draws. He shares the lead with top seed Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia. 

In the seventh round, Parimarjan will meet Nepomniachtchi after a days rest and the game could well be the championship decider. 

Having already met the three strongest players world junior champion Zaven Andriasian of Armenia, Yuriy Kuzubov of Ukraine and Rauf Mamedov of Azerbaijan Negi is better placed to lift the crown.

 Fantasy posts upset win 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Puttanna

 B. Puttanna-trained Tribal Fantasy scored an upset victory in the H.B.Gundappa Gowda Memorial Cup, at the Bangalore races on Saturday. Apprentice Ashok Kumar partnered the six-year-old mare, by Tecorno out of Knowing, to victory. The afternoon was ruled by less-fancied runners. As a result of this, the jackpot pool at the host, and also at most of the off-course centres, was carried over.RESULTS

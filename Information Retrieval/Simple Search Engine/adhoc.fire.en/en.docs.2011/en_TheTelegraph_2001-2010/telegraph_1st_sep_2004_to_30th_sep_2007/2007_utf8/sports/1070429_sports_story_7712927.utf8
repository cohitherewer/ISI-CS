 Ghei back on top 

Beijing: Gaurav Ghei recovered his touch in right time to bring in a superb four-under 68 and take a share in the four-way lead with one more round to go in the inaugural $500,000 Pine Valley Beijing Open Golf on Saturday. 

Ghei fired six birdies against two bogeys for his 68, in which his front nine came in a flawless four-under 32. He was 11 under 205 after rounds of 65 and 72 on the first two days. 

He shares the lead with Scott Strange whose round included a stunning hole-in-one on the par-3 12th hole. Overnight leader Panuwat Meunlek overcame a double bogey on par-5 13th hole with a 69 and Adam Blyth with 67 were also on 11-under. 

Indias SSP Chowrasia and Amandeep Johl shot 72 and 73, respectively for a tied 50th place. (PTI)

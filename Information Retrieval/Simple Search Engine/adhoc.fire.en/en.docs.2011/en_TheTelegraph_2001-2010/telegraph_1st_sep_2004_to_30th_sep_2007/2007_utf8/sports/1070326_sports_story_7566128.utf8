 Greg: Knee-jerk reactions wont help

New Delhi: Two days after his Vision 2007 came crashing down, India coach Greg Chappell said instead of being driven by knee-jerk reactions, its time to learn from the mistakes. 

The message that I would like to get across is that knee-jerk reactions and emotional responses to this (debacle) is not going to solve the problem, the former Australia captain said in an interview to a television channel. 

Sure the coach will bear the brunt, the captain will face the music, the players will also take the brunt, but its deeper than that. There are issues that needs to be addressed and I think this (media) is not the forum to talk about them, Chappell said. 

Casting aspersions and putting blame on this area, that area, this individual, that individual in not going to change the scene. A through investigation is needed into all aspects of what has led to this happening. If we can do that, we can move forward. (PTI)

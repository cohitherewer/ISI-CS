 It is only a question of performance now: Dravid

Bangalore: Team India captain Rahul Dravid has sent out an ominous signal to World Cup rivals, saying his team was not only motivated but fully equipped to do well in Caribbean conditions. 

Dravid said his players were not unduly bothered about the nature of pitches in the West Indies and were motivated in fetching the desired results. 

I dont want to go there with any pre-conceived ideas that wickets will be slow or fast. I believe that weve got the team that can do well in all conditions if we play to our potential, Dravid said. 

Most of the pitches have been re-laid for the cricketing extravaganza starting March 13 and there has been a lot of speculation about how they will behave. 

Speaking to reporters on Friday night, Dravid said that Team India had the talent to take on the big challenge ahead. 

Our chances in the World Cup are good. Hope we play to our potential. We have the talent and its only a question of our performance now. 

World Cup is a unique event. If you get on a bit of a roll there you can crack whatever the opposition you are facing like we did the last time. Its a question of performance in the two months that matters, said Dravid. 

Talking about dealing with non-performers in the team, he said honesty was the best policy. 

Honesty is the best way to get the message across to a non-performer. I think weve to be honest to people. Not that were trying to find a solution for them. We always believe that we try to make every one a better player, he said. 

Being captain, its one of the toughest things for me to tell people that they are not playing in the eleven or they are not in the team, Dravid said. 

According to him, the captain had a limited role in selection matters. 

I dont always pick the teams, which is the selectors job who look to the talent available at the domestic level. Im sort of more involved in really picking the first XI. My focus really takes over once the squad of fifteen is picked. 

Talking about the motivational factor: Dravid said: My general answer for this for a long time used to be why do we need to motivate someone who is playing for India. Every time you come on to play for your country, that itself is a motivation. But having led the side over a period of time Ive realised that the amount of cricket we play we do need to motivate people, the captain said. 

One of the best ways we have found for motivating the players is to give them more and more challenges. Lot of these cricketers are ambitious young men and really keen on succeeding and doing well. 

Weve got to give them new challenges, give them new positions to bat in, may be hold them in different situations. Give them something thats exciting constantly. If we can provide that, it really works well in fetching results. If they know that you really care about them succeeding as individuals they respond quickly and come to the party very quickly, said Dravid. 

Meanwhile, taking time off his busy schedule ahead of the World Cup, coach Greg Chappell is enjoying a brief holiday with his wife at a lake resort near Alappuzha, Kerala.

 Raikkonen grabs pole position

- Formula 1 season flags off today with Australian GP 

 Alonso 

Melbourne: Kimi Raikkonen will make his Ferrari debut on pole position in Sundays season-opening Australian Grand Prix. 

The Iceman saw off the challenge of McLarens two-time world champion Fernando Alonso to become the first Ferrari driver in 51 years to secure pole in his first appearance for Ferrari. 

The last was the late Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio in his home GP in 1956. 

Alonso, who will make his McLaren debut after winning the Formula One championship for the past two years with Renault, had to make do with second place on the starting grid. 

I think we have a good race package. We are more confident for the race than for qualifying, definitely, said Raikkonen, successor at Ferrari to retired seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher. 

Meanwhile, race stewards fined Toyota 2,000 euros ($2,665) on Saturday for allowing Italian Jarno Trulli to drive down the pit lane with a jack still attached to his car.

Calcutta: The countdown has begun. Rahul Dravid is hoping Team India gets into the right groove and utilises the series against Sri Lanka to fine-tune their skills. 

This is our last chance to fine-tune our game before the World Cup. We are looking forward to the series. We have to perform well, try and get the players in the right kind of form and fitness so that we can take some confidence to the World Cup, the captain said on Wednesday. 

We had very good practice against the West Indies. They are a very good side. They were very successful in the ICC Champions Trophy. And whats more, we did well against them. 

If this series also goes well then it would be a very good preparation for us Winning is important, he said. 

The series would also be an opportunity for Virender Sehwag to put to rest some lingering doubts about his form. Dravid is hoping as much. 

Sometimes, a break can be useful. He is looking confident. Time away from the game has given him a chance to come out of a pressure situation and work on his game. Sehwag is working hard on different areas, doing normal things as before, the smile is back on his face. 

He is keen to perform well tomorrow (Thursday). He can play a crucial role in our Cup campaign. This series gives him a chance to get his form back and clear his mind. 

Asked about the pressure element on Sehwag, Dravid said: Not just Sehwag, all players are under pressure in every match. Every game is important and there has to be a certain amount of pressure when you play international cricket, otherwise there is no fun. 

The Team India captain picked fielding as one of the grey areas. 

We have to work extra hard on our fielding. Our focus will continue to remain on being a good fielding side. We are concentrating on certain areas Players will need to work on specific positions at which they will be fielding. If we can each improve by 10 or 20 per cent, the team will then benefit immensely. 

On Munaf Patels fitness, Dravid said: Munaf is shaping up well. He has been bowling well in the nets but there is a difference between bowling in the nets and in a match situation. We must see how he performs and comes through 10 overs of bowling and three hours of fielding during a match.

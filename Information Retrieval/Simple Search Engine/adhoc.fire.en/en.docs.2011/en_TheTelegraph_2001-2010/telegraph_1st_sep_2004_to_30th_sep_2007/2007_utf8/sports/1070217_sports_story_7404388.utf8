Wellington: New Zealand handed Australia their first-ever 10-wicket defeat in one-day Internationals when they won the first match of the Chappell-Hadlee series here on Friday. 

The New Zealanders raced to a stunning victory with 23 overs to spare after Shane Bond had dismissed Australia for 148n with a haul of five for 23. 

New Zealand had little trouble reaching the target with Lou Vincent sealing the win by smashing Mitchell Johnson for six to finish unbeaten on 73. Skipper Stephen Fleming remained 70 not out. 

The Australians were missing five key players Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist, Andrew Symonds, Brett Lee and Michael Clarke but their absence could hardly be regarded as an excuse for their fourth defeat in five matches and their first 10-wicket loss in 646 one-day Internationals. 

Its not a nice feeling. Its a demoralising loss and probably as low as weve been, stand-in captain Mike Hussey said. Everything seemed to go the wrong way and it can only go up from here. 

Weve got a new group at the moment and weve just got to mould together as quickly as possible. 

It was a good toss to win and they got plenty of movement out of the wicket. I was hopeful a couple of early wickets would give us a chance, but we couldnt get any momentum. 

The World Cup preparations of the Aussies who were beaten 0-2 by England in the tri-series finals last week are in tatters. The out-of-form Australians will surrender their No. 1 ranking to South Africa if they lose the three-match series in New Zealand. 

Hussey top-scored with 42 off 96 balls while Brad Hodge (22) and Brad Hogg (20) both made starts, but only two other players reached double-figures as the Black Caps chalked up their first win over Australia this year after losing all four tri-series clashes. 

Everything for them went wrong and everything for us went right, right from the toss, Fleming said. They had the worst of the pitch, it got better for us and we rode our luck. 

Its the best Ive seen Shane bowl for some time and not just because he got five wickets. His control was outstanding, and his thought processes were great. 

Bond, who took a hattrick against Australia in Hobart last month, continued his success against them with a supreme display of fast bowling. 

He removed replacement opener Phil Jacques (1) and Gilchrists stand-by wicketkeeper Brad Haddin (6) in his first spell, then took a superb one-handed catch to remove the dangerous Cameron White (13) in his second spell. 

Bond completed his fourth five-wicket ODI haul when be clean-bowled Nathan Bracken for a duck and dismissed Hogg to polish off the Australian innings inside 50 overs.

 Injury made Flintoff fear for career

JAMES MOSSOP

 Andrew Flintoff 

There were dark days when Andrew Flintoff lumbered himself about on crutches and allowed the spectre of one dreaded headline to enter his thinking. It said, in haunting starkness: Flintoff finished. 

From a man regarded as unbreakable as crickets greatest and most spirited all-rounder, it was an astonishing admission. Yes, there were times when it crossed my mind, he said. When you have operations and you have surgery it is something you think of, but right now I am confident I will be back. 

After a third operation on his left ankle the front foot he plants down on his fast-bowling delivery stride he is in working with sports physiotherapist Dave Roberts and insists he is on the way back. 

On a morning of teeming Manchester rain last week in Lancashires indoor cricket school, he turned his arm over for the first time since April, bowling one or two deliveries off a two-step run up. 

It felt like a breakthrough, a sign of renewed hope for a cricketer who has collected every award going, especially for his role in Englands 2005 Ashes win over Australia when he scored 402 runs and took 24 wickets. 

His desire to return for Lancashire and England is intensified when he considers some other real-life headlines that have pursued him since April when he fell from cartoon heroics to pedalo frolics. Flintoffs exuberance on the pitch is occasionally matched by his enthusiasm for refuelling off it and when he fell into the water in the early hours following a World Cup game in the West Indies, he was on many a front page. He was dropped and stripped of the vice-captaincy. 

Ive done my penance for that, he said as we crossed the Pennines with him at the wheel heading for an Asda Kwik Cricket final for children at Headingley, Leeds. They greeted him as if he was an amalgamation of Superman and Father Christmas. 

Everyone called him Freddie as they do universally after the similarly named fictional character Fred Flintstone. There is no fiction with Flintoff. He had filled his morning with a tough session under Robertss supervision at Old Trafford. He wants to be back playing within a month. 

Id love to play in Lancashires Twenty20 quarter final on Wednesday, but with the muscle wastage and so on its probably a bit early, he said. 

I dont want to push it but for the next couple of weeks I can really crack on. If I respond well to what I am doing, I could be back within a month. You have to put your trust in the medical staff and the physio and I have a lot of faith in Roberts. 

It has been frustrating. After the way the winter went I want to get out and play some good cricket again. I am 29 years of age and I feel my best years are in front of me with the bat and I dont feel I have peaked with the ball. 

For three or four years everything went pretty much my own way and I feel I can have that again. 

Winter did not go well. He captained England to a 5-0 whitewash defeat Down Under as Australia avenged the 2005 series. The World Cup in the Caribbean was not a happy trip. 

Losing in Australia produced its own kind of misery. Some said the responsibility of captaincy affected him. He responds: It was a big job. It was hard. A lot of people may not have understood the magnitude of it. 

It had moments where it was enjoyable. Dont get me wrong but the one thing that made it tougher was my own form. I am sure that if I had been playing well with the bat, it would have made the job a lot easier. But I cant use the captaincy as an excuse for that.

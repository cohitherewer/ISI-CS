 Ill bat like I did in 96: Sanath

 - Lanka to bank on aggression 

Colombo: Sri Lanka want to play aggressive cricket like they did in 1996 to secure their second World Cup title, captain Mahela Jayawardene said on Tuesday. 

We have been playing a pretty exciting brand of cricket in the past couple of years, as our results have shown, Jayawardene said ahead of his teams departure for the Caribbean, where the World Cup starts on March 13. 

The key to winning the coveted title, according to the captain, lay in being aggressive with both bat and ball, as Arjuna Ranatungas team was in its winning 1996 campaign. 

Coach Tom Moody said a recent visit to the Caribbean to get first-hand information on pitch conditions was very useful.The pitches, apart from Queens Park Oval in Port of Spain, were very unfamiliar. So a lot of adjustments will have to be made, he said. 

Veteran opener Sanath Jayasuriya, whose big hitting at the top of the order contributed to Sri Lankas success in 1996, said he would bat the same way again. 

I will go out and bat exactly the same way as I did in 1996, said Jayasuriya. 

Jayawardene feels Australia would still be a force despite an unusual string of defeats and injuries to key players. 

They do have some injury problems, but knowing the Australians, theyll come strong in the World Cup, the Sri Lanka captain said. 

They have a very strong and experienced side, he said. (AGENCIES)

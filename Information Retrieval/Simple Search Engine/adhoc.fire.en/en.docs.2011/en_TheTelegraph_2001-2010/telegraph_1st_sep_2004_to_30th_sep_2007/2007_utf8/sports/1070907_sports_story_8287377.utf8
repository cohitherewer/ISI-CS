The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Umpire was right, says ICC

 Paul Collingwood 

 London: The International 

 Cricket Council (ICC) has defended umpire Peter Hartley 

 after England skipper Paul Collingwood was controversially 

 run out during the defeat to India in Wednesdays one-day 

 International. 

Collingwood set off for a risky single and appeared to be struggling to make his ground when India wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni whipped off the bails. 

Though Hartley initially declined to call for the third umpire, he changed his mind after a replay on the Brit Ovals big screen showed Collingwood was out. The England captain was duly sent to the pavilion having scored just one run. 

Collingwood was clearly angry at the circumstances but the ICC said Hartley had not broken any protocol. 

There is nothing to prevent an umpire reversing his decision as long as it is before the next ball has been bowled, an ICC spokesman said on Thursday. 

The way he got to the decision was not ideal but the fact is that the right decision (to give Collingwood out) was made. 

He should have referred the decision straight away but he had the presence of mind to refer it once he realised his mistake and the right decision was made. 

Imagine if he had not referred it when Collingwood was clearly out. 

 The ICC also stressed that no India players requested 

 Hartley, who was officiating his first ODI, to refer the 

 decision to the third umpire.

 Srinath shows confidence in Prasad

Bangalore: Former India pacer Jawagal Srinath has sought to debunk the theory that the team would struggle with an inexperienced bowling attack on the upcoming tour of England. 

Indias 16-member squad for the three-Test series in England in July features rookies Ishant Sharma, Ranadeb Bose and the relatively less experienced Sreesanth manning the fast bowling department spearheaded by Zaheer Khan. 

Srinath, now an ICC match referee, believed that the presence of Venkatesh Prasad as bowling coach would help the youngsters. Prasad has a lot of experience and he should be able to guide the young pace bowlers, he said. 

England tour is a good chance for youngsters to establish themselves. Young pacers should be able to exploit the English conditions provided they had the right attitude, said Srinath reposing faith in his former India teammate.

 Greg Chappells future depends on Cup show

 - BCCI has no complaints against coach as of now, but...

Mumbai: Greg Chappell was relaxed as he went around the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) HQ on Tuesday afternoon. The coachs mood he spent time interacting with Test specialist Wasim Jaffer, whod dropped by, as well may have had much to do with his employers having no complaints against him. 

As of now, that is. 

However, Chappells post-World Cup future will almost wholly be determined by Team Indias performance in that showpiece tournament. 

As his employers, theres no complaint from our side... In fact, no player has come with a complaint either... Its too early, though, to talk of the coachs future after the World Cup... As I see it, much is going to depend on how we fare in the tournament, a top BCCI official told The Telegraph. 

He added: As far as we know, Chappell wants to continue... The former Australian captains 23-month contract ends with the World Cup. 

Incidentally, according to another key official, a section within the BCCI favours the appointment of a desi coach. Some do feel we shouldnt continue with somebody from outside, but the problem is somebody like Sunil Gavaskar is busy with many things and a Ravi Shastri will be seen as young for the job... 

Mohinder Amarnath, it may be recalled, had been in the running after John Wright ended his innings in April 2005, but its Chappell who got the nod. 

Had BCCI president Sharad Pawar turned up on Tuesday evening, he would almost surely have taken a coach-specific feedback from captain Rahul Dravid and vice-captain Sachin Tendulkar. Also, perhaps, had a one-on-one with Chappell. 

Now, that has been put on hold till late March, when Pawar is expected to visit the West Indies before the World Cups Super Eight stage.

 Atapattu opts out

Colombo: Former Sri Lanka captain and opening batsman Maravan Atapattu has opted out of the Test series against Bangladesh, a top Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) official said on Sunday. 

We have received an e-mail from Maravan announcing his non-availability citing personal commitments, SLC secretary Kangadaran Mathivanan said. Atapattu is currently in England playing for Lashings World XI. 

Meanwhile, Bangladesh arrived in Sri Lanka on Sunday despite heightened fears of Tamil Tiger bomb attacks, officials said. The Sri Lankan government hailed the visit as a sign of confidence in their security arrangements. (AFP)

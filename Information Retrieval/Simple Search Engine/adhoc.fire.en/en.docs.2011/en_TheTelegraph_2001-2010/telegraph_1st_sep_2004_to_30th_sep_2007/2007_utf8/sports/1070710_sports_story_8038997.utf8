 Schuster new Real coach

Madrid: Bernd Schuster is Real Madrids latest coach. The former Getafe coach was presented by Madrid president Ramon Calderon at the Santiago Bernabeu on Monday. 

This is a happy day for me. I thank the president and everyone here for giving me the opportunity, Schuster said. 

Schuster will take over from Fabio Capello, who was fired on June 28, less than two weeks after leading Madrid to their first Spanish league title in four years. 

Schuster, a former Germany defender, had coached Getafe since 2005. The Madrid-based club lost 1-0 to Sevilla in the Copa del Rey final and finished ninth in the league. 

Meanwhile, Getafe hired former Denmark midfielder Michael Laudrup to replace Schuster. (AP)

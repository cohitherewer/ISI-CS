 CAB special meet on June 30

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: A special general meeting of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) will be held on June 30 to amend a rule that does not allow the inclusion of the womens body under its wing. 

The SGM will decide on the amendment and the renovation of Eden Gardens which has to be completed by October 31, said CAB president Prasun Mukherjee after a lengthy working committee meeting on Wednesday. 

Among other decisions, the annual prize distribution ceremony will be held on July 22. Besides rewarding the cricketers in various categories, Manoj Tiwary and Ranadeb Bose will also be felicitated for making the India squad. 

The Bengal coach will be appointed by July 15, said Mukherjee. 

CAB will hold its tournament committee meeting on Thursday to decide on East Bengals participation in the P. Sen Trophy, slated to begin on June 22. League champions East Bengal have appealed against the decision to keep them out of the tournament. 

Earlier, the working committee members observed a one-minute silence in memory of late ICC president Percy Sonn.

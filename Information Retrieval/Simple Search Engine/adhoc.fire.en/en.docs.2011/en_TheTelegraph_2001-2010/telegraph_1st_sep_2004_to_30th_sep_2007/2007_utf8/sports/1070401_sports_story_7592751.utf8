 Sachin still has good cricket left: Wright 

 Ian Chappells observation that Sachin Tendulkar should think in terms of retirement from the game touched off a furious debate on Saturday with several former players saying that it was too early for him to call it a day. Following are the excerpts (alphabetically) of what they had to say on Chappells comments on Sachin. 

RAJ SINGH DUNGARPUR: Sachin is one of the best exponents of the game and he does not require any advice from anyone on his retirement. I hold Chappell in high esteem and he is a good friend of mine. But in my opinion, such comments from a great cricketer like him are neither necessary nor welcome. 

AJAY JADEJA: Chappell should remember how Sachin has achieved his greatness and carried the weight of expectations of a billion people since the age of 16. Former Australian captains Mark Taylor and Steve Waugh were not going great guns long before they announced their retirement. Australians dont treat their heroes badly but they come here and want to demolish our heroes. 

SYED KIRMANI: Chappell has given his opinion. But such a decision rests in the hands of Sachin only. I see a couple of more years of cricket in him. He may play more time than that period depending on his fitness level. He is not a player to wilt under pressure and he knows his own strength. I feel and hope he will live up to the expectations of cricket lovers of the country. There are no achievers like him in Indian cricket. 

ERAPALLI PRASANNA: Sachin is a mature player He must be aware what he wants. I am sure he knows where exactly he stands in the game today and the decision on his retirement should be made by him and not by anybody else. 

K. SRIKKANTH: He has one or two years of cricket ahead of him. He is such a committed player and if he has a lean phase in the World Cup, it does not mean that he has to call it a day. The whole team could not come up to the expectations. 

JOHN WRIGHT: He still has some good cricket left in him. There are another four or five batsmen who have not done well. In any case, its up to him to decide if he wants to continue playing.

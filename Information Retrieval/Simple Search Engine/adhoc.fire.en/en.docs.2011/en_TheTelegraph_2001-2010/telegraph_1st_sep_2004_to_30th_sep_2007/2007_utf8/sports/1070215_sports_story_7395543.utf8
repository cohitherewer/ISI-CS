 Dynamos thrash Veerans 5-2

Chandigarh: Chandigarh Dynamos demolished Chennai Veerans 5-2 in a PHL match on Wednesday. Dynamos attacked right from the word go, forcing two penalty corners in the first three minutes. 

Olympian Deepak Thakur took the lead in the 5th minute after being put in possession by Prabjot Singh. 

Dynamos increased the lead in the 14th minute through a freak goal. Ravipal went on a solo on the left flank looking for teammates, but with no one in sight, he cut into the circle and ran down the goalline on the left and took a reluctant shot. 

However, the ball rose off defender Raghunaths stick and found the ne. 

Chennai pulled one back within six minutes, earning their first short corner in the 20th minute. Somanna injected a fast and accurate ball and Albert Casas set it up perfectly for Raghunath. 

But Dynamos struck again after four minutes. Jugraj Singh beat the goalkeeper with a powerful drag flick to make it 3-1 in the 24th minute. 

Chennai came back with another goal in the 46th when Malaysian import Kuhan Shanmuganathan found the target. 

Dynamos struck two more goals in the 56th minute via Ravipal and Prabjot rounded off the tally also the 56th minute. (PTI)

 Dhoni, Smith laud Rohit

Durban: Rohit Sharma had to endure a long wait to play a significant innings for India, but his effort against South Africa in the ICC World Twenty20 gave a glimpse of his talent and character. 

His half-century off 40 balls in the must-win match at Kingsmead, completed with a six off the last ball of the innings, propelled India to a fighting 153 and an eventual 37-run victory for a spot in the semis. 

There was a bit of nerves, the team was under pressure because we had lost some early wickets. I had a good partnership with Mahi which helped us get a good competitive total. I hope to carry on in the next few games, Rohit said. 

His skipper also had a word of praise. It was amazing the way he batted, said Dhoni. It is really tough for a guy who has been sitting out for a long time. 

Graeme Smith too lauded the 20-year-olds effort. He batted superbly, he stuck to his gameplan and finished the innings very well.

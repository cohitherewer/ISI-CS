The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bengal ride Laxmi show

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bengal, expectedly, topped the East Zone section of the National Twenty20 meet that concluded at the Eden on Sunday. On the final day, Bengal registered a four-wicket win over Tripura in the last zonal match and kept their all-win record intact. 

Laxmi Ratan Shuklas allround excellence fashioned a comfortable victory for the hosts. Orissa are the other team to make the cut for the national level meet after they finished second from the zone. 

Bengal started disastrously, losing four wickets Subhamoy Das (4), captain Deep Dasgupta (5), Anustup Majumdar (6) and Sourashish Lahiri (18). 

They looked in despair at 35 for four when Shukla took charge. With a reputation of a big hitter, Rana Chowdhury had an average outing. He scored 18 off 21 with a four and a six. 

Shuklas 76 came off 42 balls and was laced with six hits to the fence.

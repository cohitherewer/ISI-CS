 Milan bury Istanbul ghost

 - CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL 

 Inzaghi brace in 2-1 win over Liverpool 

HENRY WINTER in ATHENS

Liverpools drive towards the European Cup ended on the hard shoulder here Wednesday night, Filippo Inzaghis bony upper arm knocking them off the road to glory. The Italian poacher shouldered in AC Milans first, and then paraded all his finishing aplomb in adding a second. As reported in Thursdays Late City edition, Dirk Kuyts riposte was too little, too late. There was no repeat of Istanbul 2005, no lightning striking twice. Like the monsoon that briefly drenched Athens, disappointment swept through the ambitious emissaries from Anfield. Steven Gerrard and company had been determined to prove that Istanbul was no fluke, that they could be considered one of the most respected teams of all time with two European Cups in 25 months. 

This defeat will hurt hard. When the heartache ebbs, a sense of frustration will endure. Liverpool will kick themselves for a performance brimming with positive approach work, particularly from the outstanding Jermaine Pennant, but they lacked finish, barring Kuyts 89th-minute contribution. Milan, good but hardly invincible, were there for the taking. Kaka impressed, as did Inzaghi and Massimo Oddo, but an unspectacular side won an unspectacular final. 

During the post-mortem, Rafael Bentez must admit his own culpability. This was death by lack of adventure. With Liverpool trailing 0-1 and screaming out for an additional threat to supplement the lonely Kuyt in attack, Liverpools manager waited until 12 minutes from time before sending on Peter Crouch. Crazy. 

When Inzaghi then rolled in his second, Bentez responded by sending on a full-back, Alvaro Arbeloa, for Steve Finnan, when he had Craig Bellamy itching to make an impact. Liverpool needed an adrenalin rush from the Valleys, a touch of Bellamys death or glory style, and they instead got a steady defender. 

Liverpool had their chances, but never took them until Kuyt. Milan did. End of story. As the final whistle blew on a Liverpool season that died in 90 minutes, some of Bentez players slumped to the floor, devastated. 

For all the pain suffered by Gerrard, Jamie Carragher and the rest of Bentezs side, one had to admire the noble figure of Maldini as he climbed those 30 steps to lift the trophy. Now 39, Maldini has got his manicured hands on the Champions League (European Cup) as many times as Liverpool and his fifth winners medal is surely his most formidable achievement. 

Until Inzaghis touch of fortune, Bentezs side were in control. Pennant proved the scarlet pimpernel, giving Italian sentries the slip. 

But then Milan showed their claws. When Alonso ran in to Kaka 23 yards out, conceding a soft free-kick, the menace was obvious. Andrea Pirlo lined up the ball, Liverpool organised a huge wall and Inzaghi prepared his dart into the box. Standing next to Bolo Zenden at the end of the human barricade, Inzaghi broke away stealthily, the eternal predator hoping for scraps if Pepe Reina spilled the ball. When Pirlo bent his kick around the wall, Reina guessed correctly, throwing himself to his left to intercept. Or so it seemed. 

Poor Reina. He was left clutching at thin air as the ball clipped Inzaghis shoulder, changing its trajectory markedly. Reina, could only look back in anger as the ball carried into the goal. Liverpool were shocked. Having played so well for 44 minutes, they were now behind. 

Bentez finally sent on Crouch for Javier Mascherano, finally gambling. But with nine minutes left Liverpools hopes of Istanbul Revisited became Mission Impossible as Inzaghi grabbed his second. This was pure Milan class, the ball moving gracefully from Pirlo to Kaka and into Inzaghis path. The Italian rounded Reina and stroked the ball home. Liverpool gave themselves a brief flicker of hope. Pennant swung over a corner that Daniel Agger flicked on, via Maldini, for Kuyt to head home. But the damage was done by a hard shoulder.

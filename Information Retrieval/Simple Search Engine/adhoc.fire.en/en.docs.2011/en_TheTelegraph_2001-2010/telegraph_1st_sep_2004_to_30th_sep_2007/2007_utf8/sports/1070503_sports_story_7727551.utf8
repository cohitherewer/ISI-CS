The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A sharp drop in NFL attendance 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Domestic football is always considered the most popular sport in India. A game of club football here often attracts big crowd despite Indias continuous dismal showings in international football. 

However, the attendance statistics of the 11th National Football League (NFL) portray a different picture. According to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources, the NFL this season has been a poorly-attended show. 

Except for a couple of matches between Mohun Bagan and East Bengal, the turnout in NFL has dropped drastically, admitted a federation official. No doubt, the attendance has been going down every season, but it has been worst this time. 

According to AIFF estimates, in Calcutta, the attendance has been 2.25 lakhs from 24 matches so far. Two derby matches saw a crowd of plus one lakh. Most of the other matches were played in front of empty stands, said the official. 

Its worse in Goa. Notwithstanding that Goan outfit Dempo are best-placed to win the title, the estimated crowd has been a little over one lakh from 24 matches so far. 

Mumbai and Ludhiana too have recorded low attendance. In Bangalore, the crowd response was initially good but they stayed away after local side HASC started playing badly. 

Perturbed, AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco said: The general infrastructures of our football grounds are so poor these days that people in the metro cities choose to stay away. 

Colaco, however, has no answer for low turnout in Goa, despite the Nehru Stadium having better facilities. I have no idea. This is my greatest area of concern. 

The lacklustre performance of the Calcutta teams could be a reason behind poor crowd response in the eastern metropolis, feels national captain Bhaichung Bhutia. I have no idea why crowd is not coming to Goa. Maybe the corporate teams in the NFL do not attract enough crowd. 

Former national coach Sukhwinder Singh said lack of attractive football and paucity of stars are the main reasons behind the diminishing popularity. 

In 11 years, NFL has not thrown up a local star It is amazing that Bhaichung, who started his career in mid 90s, still remains Indian footballs biggest draw. Why should people come again and again to watch same hackneyed football? he asked.

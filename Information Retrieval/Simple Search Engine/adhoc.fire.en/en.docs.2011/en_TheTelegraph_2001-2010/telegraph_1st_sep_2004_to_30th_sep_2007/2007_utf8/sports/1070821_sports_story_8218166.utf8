The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its a loss but a temporary one, feel former players

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former Bengal captains Sambaran Banerjee and Ashok Malhotra, who have also been national selectors in the past, felt that the seven Bengal players decision to join the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL) will have a short-term effect. They termed it a temporary loss and but said cricket will survive as no one is indispensable. 

Following are excerpts (alphabetically): 

Sambaran Banerjee: I think its a blessing in disguise for the Bengal cricket. Four players Deep Dasgupta, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Avishek Jhunjhunwala and Subhamoy Das had confirmed berths in the Bengal XI. But there will be four other younger players to showcase their talent. It is a loss, but a temporary one. 

Wriddhiman Saha, Anustup Majumdar, Arindam Ghosh and few others have been waiting in the wings for quite sometime. It will take some two years for the juniors to fit into shoes of the players who left for ICL. Bengal may not make the final this season, but two years down the line, the young bunch will be prepared to carry on the responsibilities. Not only Bengal, more or less all the states have been affected. Whatever said and done, bottom line will be Long Live cricket. 

Ashok Malhotra: Bengal obviously cannot make up for all these cricketers, especially Deep Dasgupta, Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Avishek Jhunjhunwala. Over the years, they have done exceedingly well for the state team. But from the players point of view, I think, they took the right decision as all these players did not have any chance to play for the country and no one would give them so much money playing for the state side. They joined the ICL only for financial security. And for Bengal, Im sure, they have back-ups and what it needs is a bit of nurturing. Everyone has to leave at one point of time. After Sunil Gavaskar left, it was Sachin Tendulkar who took baton What I would like to say is good senses prevail and cricket wins.

 Bangladesh desperate to avoid 0-3 ignominy

Kandy: Sri Lankas left-handed opening batsman Upul Tharanga has recovered from a fractured left heel and will play in the third and final Test against Bangladesh, captain Mahela Jayawardene said. 

Tharanga suffered the injury while facing teammate Lasith Malinga during a practice session and missed the first two Tests in Colombo. 

Upul is our number one choice. So one of the other openers will have to sit out, Jayawardene, whos looking for a clean 3-0 sweep against the visiting Bangladesh, said. 

Bangladesh may make two changes to the side that lost the second Test. Left-arm seamer Syed Rasel may replace Mohammed Sharif, who failed to take a wicket in the previous Test. Batsman Tushar Imran may come in for Mehrab Hossain. 

Bangladesh are looking to salvage some pride after two disastrous outings in Colombo. Few teams have recovered after making just 89 or 62 in the first innings, so the big defeats that followed did not surprise me at all, said captain Mohammed Ashraful. 

What hurt me is that all the batsmen went down in a heap. The entire top order has to click.

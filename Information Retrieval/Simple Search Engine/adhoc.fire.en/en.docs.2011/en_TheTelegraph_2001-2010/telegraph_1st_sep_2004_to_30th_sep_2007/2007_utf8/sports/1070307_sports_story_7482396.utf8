 Oram hits 88 with broken finger

Bridgetown: Jacob Oram ignored a broken finger which he had considered amputating to score 88 in a World Cup warm-up match against Bangladesh on Tuesday. 

He came in to bat with the Black Caps in trouble at 75 for six but he and Brendon McCullum blasted a seventh-wicket 105-run stand to pave the way for a respectable total of 226 all out off 49.2 overs. 

Oram arrived in the Caribbean last week nursing a badly broken finger on his left hand and was intending to play with a fibreglass sheath to protect it. 

He told reporters that he may need pain-killing injections to help him play and even suggested he would have it surgically removed if it meant he could take part in the World Cup. (Reuters)

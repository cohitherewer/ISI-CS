 No pressure on me, says Sandeep 

New Delhi: Sandeep Singh asserts that his drag-flicks still have the fire to rattle rival defence. 

Having been recalled to the national side after a 10-month hiatus forced by an accidental gun-shot, Sandeep insisted that he was not feeling the pressure of making his international comeback either. 

I am not feeling any pressure, neither am I nervous (to play an international tournament). My mindset remains as it used to be. My body is fit and my form is intact. I am as fit as I used to be, said the ace drag-flicker, who was picked in the 18-member Indian team for the six-nation Champions Challenge meet in Boom, Belgium. 

I am confident that we can hit top form. I think we have a good chance to prove that we can do well, he said. (PTI)

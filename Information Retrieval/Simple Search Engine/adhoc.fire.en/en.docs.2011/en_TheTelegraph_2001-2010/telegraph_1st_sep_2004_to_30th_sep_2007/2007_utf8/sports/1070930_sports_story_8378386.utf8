 Rohan makes doubles final

MARIO RODRIGUES

 Rochus has set up date with Richard Gasquet 

Mumbai: Rainer Schuettler, who shocked former world No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt and seventh seed Julien Benneteau earlier this week, had his giant-killing run ended by eighth seed Olivier Rochus in the $416,000 Kingfisher Airlines Open semi-final at the CCI centre court here on Saturday evening. 

The 26-year-old Belgian (world No. 65) beat the big-hitting German (No. 143) 6-4, 6-4 in an hour and 48 minutes to seal his third entry into a Tour final. This was the second time Rochus triumphed over Schuettler, the first having come in Copenhagen five years ago. 

Rochus will meet top seed and world No. 14 Richard Gasquet in the title round. The strapping 21-year-old Frenchman, who reached the Wimbledon semi-finals, routed 34-year-old compatriot Fabrice Santoro 6-0, 6-3 in under an hour. 

The Indo-Pak Express remained on course for the doubles title after storming into the final late on Day 6. Rohan Bopanna and Aisam Qureshi saw off Lars Burgsmuller (Germany) and Rochus (Belgium) 6-2, 6-3. 

The unseeded duo will meet third seeds Robert Lindstedt (Sweden) and Jarkko Nieminen (Finland), who ousted the unseeded Serbian combination of Boris Pashanski and Viktor Troicki 6-1, 7-5. 

Gasquet, who has been likened to Roger Federer, said after another facile win on another balmy night that he was pleased with his tennis. Hes difficult to play for many players, but we practise a lot together so I knew what to expect. I played really solid today and am very happy with my game, said Gasquet. 

In the first semi-final, Rochus scampered around like a hare retrieving everything Schuettler threw at him and also hitting some winners. 

The German who had blasted Hewitt off court on Friday couldnt get his act together. He had very few winners and too many unforced errors, which cost him dear. 

I cant believe it I never, never expected this, said Rochus. The last three-four months have been tough for me. But last week I won a Challenger in France and helped my confidence. Although Richard is the favourite (on Sunday), Ill have nothing to lose and will fight it out, the Belgian added. 

Meanwhile, Briton Ross Hutchins, who collapsed due to dehydration during his doubles match on Friday night, left for London on Saturday. He wasnt taken to hospital, as was mistakenly informed by the organisers, and was treated in an ambulance posted at the venue.

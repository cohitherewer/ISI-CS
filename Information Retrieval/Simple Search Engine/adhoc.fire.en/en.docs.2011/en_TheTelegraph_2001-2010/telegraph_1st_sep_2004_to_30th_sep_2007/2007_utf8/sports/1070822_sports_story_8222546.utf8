The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Decks cleared for Manohar

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai: The decks have been cleared for Vidarbhas Shashank Manohar to be chosen as the president-elect during the Board of Control for Cricket in Indias September 28 AGM. 

Manohar, vice-president from Central Zone, is president Sharad Pawars confidant No. 1. 

Another vice-president (North), Lalit Modi, had proposed that the other office-bearers also be identified a year in advance. That was in the form of a letter to Pawar. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, the proposal was internally discussed on Tuesday morning and Modi went along with the consensus within the ruling group that only the next president be identified. 

Look, dont forget that Modi is part of the treasury bench... He didnt object, is what somebody who attended the meeting pointed out. 

However, its highly unlikely that Modi wont be seeking his pound of flesh in some manner. 

Later in the day, the first SGM approved an amendment to the constitution, allowing for a president-elect. 

Meanwhile, the Sikkim Cricket Association has sought full membership, which will allow it to compete in the Ranji Trophy from the 2008-09 season. 

At the same time, the Manipur body has asked for permission to field teams in junior tourna- ments.

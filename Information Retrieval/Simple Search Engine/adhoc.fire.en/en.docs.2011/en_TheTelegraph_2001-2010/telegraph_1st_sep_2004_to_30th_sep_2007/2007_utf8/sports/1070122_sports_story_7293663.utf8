The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 CAB move 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The ruling camp in the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) has taken strong exception to charges framed against them by the working committee member Samar Paul of Aryan Club. 

Paul in a petition filed in a city court, has asked for an impartial observer for the February 1 elections. 

Paul also alleged that the current CAB office-bearers are sponsored by Dalmiya, who has already quit from his post. 

Reacting strongly to this, CAB joint secretaries Saradindu Pal and Amitabha Banerjee on Sunday threatened to move court and file a defamation against him, if he does not apologise unconditionally.

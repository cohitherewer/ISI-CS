 Kyrgyzstan stay afloat

 - India need a draw to make final

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Kyrgyzstan beat Bangladesh 3-0 at the Ambedkar Stadium here on Friday to keep alive hopes of entering the ONGC Nehru Cup final. 

Kyrgyzstan and India both have six points from three games and face each other in the last league game on Sunday. 

India are better placed vis--vis goal difference. They have scored nine and conceded three, while the central Asian nation has scored eight and let in seven. Hence, a draw would suffice for India to book a date with Syria who have already qualified for the title round. 

Bangladesh ended their campaign on a poor note. The Syed Nayeemuddin-coached side trailed by a goal at half-time and conceded two more to finish with just one point. 

Bangladeshs inability to put up a decent fight was a painful experience for the handful of their fans. 

Lut Fullaev scored the first goal in the 29th minute without any resistance from the Bangladesh defence. Fullaev got another one in the 53rd minute, again without being troubled by the opposition. 

Nayeemuddin made changes in defence and midfield, but that didnt improve matters. Ruslan Djamshidov netted the third goal in the 56th minute when a Bangladesh defender gave the ball away.

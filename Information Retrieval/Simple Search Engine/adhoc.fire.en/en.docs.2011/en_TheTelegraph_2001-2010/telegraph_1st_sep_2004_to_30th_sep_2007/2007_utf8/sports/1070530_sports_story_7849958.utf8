 Inzamam, Younis still valuable: Ashraf

 Inzamam-ul Haq and Younis Khan

Karachi: The PCB has dismissed suggestions that Younis Khan had violated the Code of Conduct by refusing to lead the national team after the World Cup. 

Younis had said that he wanted to concentrate on regaining form by playing the County season for Yorkshire. He also excused himself from the recent three-match ODI series against Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi. 

Every player has the right to decide if he wants to be captain or not. I dont think Younis violated the Code of Conduct by not accepting the captaincy, said PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf. 

He added that Younis would be considered for Pakistans upcoming engagements. 

Whenever he is available to play for Pakistan, he will be considered for selection as he remains a valuable player, he added. 

Even former captain Inzamam-ul Haq is still a valuable player and could be picked for Tests if he proves his form and fitness, Ashraf said. 

For sure, he will be considered for selection when our next Test series comes around. But a decision on whether to pick him will be taken by the selection committee, he said. 

Inzamam relinquished the captaincy and quit ODIs after Pakistans disastrous World Cup campaign in the West Indies. Ashraf announced that the national teams training camp, to prepare for matches against India and Scotland in England in July, will be held in relatively cooler places like Abbotabad and Quetta. 

Meanwhile, former PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan rubbished allegations that Inzamam was a dictator during his tenure. 

Shaharyar was accused by a PCB-appointed probe committee of pampering Inzamam and allowing him to turn into a dictatorial captain. 

I disagree with the findings of the probe committee. I admit Inzamam was not an ideal choice for captaincy, but he was the best choice among the lot, Shaharyar said.

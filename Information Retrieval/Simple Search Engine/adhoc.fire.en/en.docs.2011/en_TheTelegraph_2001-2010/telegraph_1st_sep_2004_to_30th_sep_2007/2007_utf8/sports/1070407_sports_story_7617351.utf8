 A musical on Shane Warne 

Warne

London: Shane Warnes colourful life off the field is set to become the inspiration for a musical by a Melbourne-based comedian, who promises to present a Wagnerian account of the Aussie spin legends life. 

The musical is being put together by comedian, actor and singer Eddie Perfect, who will play the role of Warne, and will have a score inspired by jazz, funk, soul and gospel. The musical is about the big issues of success and failure, the pressure of public scrutiny, over-indulgence, being an Australian male and the heartbreak that comes with falling short of getting everything one wants, he said. 

Reluctant to confirm whether the legendary bowler had approved the musical, the makers say they have enough authentic material anyway to go ahead with the project. (PTI)

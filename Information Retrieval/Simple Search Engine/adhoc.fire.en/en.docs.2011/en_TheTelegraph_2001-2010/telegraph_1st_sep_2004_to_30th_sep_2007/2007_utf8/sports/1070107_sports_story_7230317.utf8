The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ardelis may do it 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: The Sundays Eveready Calcutta Derby Stakes, over 2,400m, may turn out to be a replay of the 2000 Guineas, but it sure will be with a difference. Moon Forest won the Guineas by about a length from Ardelis who was appearing on the race track almost after nine and half months. Now Ardelis may turn the table on his conqueror.

 Although Moon Forest is yet to taste a defeat in last four outings, the Daniel David-trainee is still to traverse beyond a mile trip. However, his recent workouts over sprints have been smashing. But Derby is a different ball game a real test of speed and stamina.

 Ardelis, on the other hand, has been equally brilliant in his morning trials, but over the Derby course.

 It is, therefore, going to be a close contest with the Oaks winner, Amorina, also flexing her muscles. But Ardelis seems to be enjoying a marginal edge over the two and the Vijay Singh-trained colt may do the trick in the hands of jockey Mallesh Narredu.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

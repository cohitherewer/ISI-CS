The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The 2007 world cup in black amp; white

Due to a technical glitch, a couple of entries in Mondays Highs and Lows of the 2007 World Cup were omitted. 

Also, there was an error in the finals Highlights for which we apologise. The relevant entry should have read: Shane Watson became the 28th Aussie to cross 1000 runs in his 65th ODI. He also became the 10th Australian allrounder to achieve the ODI double of 1000 runs and 50 wickets. His tally of wickets till date is 62.

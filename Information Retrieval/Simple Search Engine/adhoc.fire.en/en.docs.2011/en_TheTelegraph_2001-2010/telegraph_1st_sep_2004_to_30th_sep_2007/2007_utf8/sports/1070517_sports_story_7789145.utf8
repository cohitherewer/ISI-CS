 Under-prepared WI to launch post-Lara era

 - FIRST TEST

London: A woefully under-prepared West Indies side exchange Caribbean heat for the damp of Lords on Thursday when life after Brian Lara starts in the first of a four-Test series against England. 

Stronger sides than the current West Indies outfit have struggled in the first part of the English season and none have had less time to acclimatise before a major tour. 

The West Indies preparations for a match that comes barely a fortnight after the end of the World Cup were not helped when two days of the scheduled three-day encounter against Somerset, their only warm-up game before the first Test, were washed out. 

To add to the tourists difficulties, Lara quit international cricket after England defeated the West Indies in the World Cup Super Eight fixture. 

Question marks also remain over the West Indies attitude and professionalism and a nightly curfew imposed on the side smacks of an attempt to impose standards, which should be self-generated. Officials have imposed a 22:30 GMT curfew on a squad now captained by Ramnaresh Sarwan. 

For all that opening batsman Chris Gayle dislike the move the fact a curfew has been imposed says much about the collapse in personal standards, although whether it will reverse a trend that ought to start and end with the players themselves remains to be seen. 

But stand-in coach David Moore, who succeeded Bennett King after his fellow Australian was axed following the World Cup, was in unapologetic mood. 

Everyone needs to improve their work ethic in this team. 

I think theres a level weve been used to, and we are eighth in the world so weve got to do something better to get higher in the world. 

We want to get through this tour not just by the skin of our teeth but with some very good results and leave the coach, whoever it may be, with something to work on. 

West Indies havent won a Test against England, home or away, since 2000 something that would have been regarded as unthinkable during their glory days of the 1970s and 1980s. 

England, however, suffered an unprecedented winter of discontent with a 0-5 thrashing in the Ashes and a lacklustre World Cup campaign. 

Such is the pace of international cricket now that there has been barely time to catch breath let alone indulge in lengthy post-mortems before the players exchange coloured clothes for pristine white on Thursday. 

Lancashire pace bowler James Anderson has been called up to the England squad. Anderson will cover for allrounder Andrew Flintoff who has injured his left ankle. 

Two players who missed the World Cup have taken advantage of the break to polish their skills in prime conditions for seam and swing. 

Steve Harmison, dreadfully disappointing in Australia, has taken 24 wickets in three games for Durham and is ready to take the new ball against a side he demolished home and away in 2004. 

His new ball partner Matthew Hoggard has also enjoyed the opportunity to return to the rhythms of County cricket and will relish the chance to bowl on a green Lords pitch.

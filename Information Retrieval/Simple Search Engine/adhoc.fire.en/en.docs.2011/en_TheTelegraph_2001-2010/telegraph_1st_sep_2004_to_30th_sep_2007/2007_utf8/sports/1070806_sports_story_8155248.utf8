 A hattrick for Rohan-Aisam

New Delhi: Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi clinched their third successive title by winning the $ 125,000 ATP Challenger doubles in Segovia, Spain. 

The Indo-Pak duo overcame a strong opposition from Michel Kratochvil of Switzerland and Luxembourgs Gilles Muller 7-6 (8), 6-3 in the final of the hardcourt event on Saturday. 

The win came after their triumphs on the grasscourts of Manchester and Nottingham in the last two weeks. 

It was the biggest challenger (in terms of prize money) for us but as far as playing goes, it was the easiest, Bopanna said from Segovia. 

It was Bopannas fourth title of the season, having won in Dublin with Austrian Adam Feeney early last month. (PTI)

England have appointed Peter Moores as successor to Duncan Fletcher. Moores, currently the National Cricket Centre director, will take over from May 1. 

Fletcher announced on Thursday that he would be leaving his post, after eight years in charge, following Saturdays final match of the World Cup against the West Indies in Barbados. 

ECB chief executive David Collier said: ECB has developed a contingency and succession plan for all key management positions. 

Peter has been identified for some time as a leading candidate as a future England head coach. He... is one of the highest qualified coaches in world cricket. 

He has worked since 2005 with the National Academy programme and has led tours with the England A squad. He is highly respected as an innovative and inspiring coach and is an ideal person to accept this appointment. 

Moores, who led Sussex to their first county championship title in 164 years in 2003, said: It is an honour to have been appointed as England head coach and to succeed Duncan Fletcher, who has been an outstanding coach of the England team.

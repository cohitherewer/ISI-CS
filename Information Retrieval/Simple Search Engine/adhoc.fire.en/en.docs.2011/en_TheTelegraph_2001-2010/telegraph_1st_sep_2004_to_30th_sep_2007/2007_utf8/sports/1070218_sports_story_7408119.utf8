The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Injuries a worry for Bagan

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Its a perfect Sunday fiesta. If Dempo SC leaders in the standings till Saturday are on a high at the moment having scored nine goals in the 11th ONGC National Football League so far, Mohun Bagan are looking to surge ahead especially after their 2-1 home win over Air-India. 

For Mohun Bagan its time to deliver at the Salt Lake Stadium, though there were a few odds. If the home advantage that cheers the green-and-maroons, their injury-stricken squad is a point to ponder ahead of their crucial encounter. 

With Dharamjit Singh, Eduardo Coelho, Tomba Singh and Subhas Chakraborty injured at the moment Mohun Bagan are in a spot of bother. Expressing concern over the injury woes, star striker Bhaichung Bhutia said: All the good players are injured at the moment 

They are a very a good side. But that does not mean that well be a weak opposition itll be an exciting contest and well go all out for a win, Bhutia told The Telegraph.

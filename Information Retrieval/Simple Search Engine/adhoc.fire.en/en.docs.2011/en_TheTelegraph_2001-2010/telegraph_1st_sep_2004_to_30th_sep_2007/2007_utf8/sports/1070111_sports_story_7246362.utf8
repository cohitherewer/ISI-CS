 Paes-Damm moves into semi-finals

- Bhupati-Santoro crasheses out 

 Sydney International 

Sydney: Indo-French pair Mahesh Bhupathi and Fabrice Santoro bit the dust with a 1-6, 6-7 (6-8) loss to Paul Hanley of Australia and Kevin Ullyett of Zimbabwe in the quarter finals of the $436,000 Medibank International on Wednesday, the final event before the opening Grand Slam of the season. 

Bhupathis estranged partner Leander Paes enjoyed better luck though. 

Paes, partnering Martin Damm of Czech Republic, posted a convincing 2-6, 7-5, 5-10 win over Ashley Fisher of Australia and American Tripp Phillips to move into the semi-finals. 

The fourth seeded Indo-Czech pair started well by clinching the first set while conceding just two games. 

Fisher and Phillips fought back in the second set to stretch the match to third set. However, the Doha Open finalists prevailed in the decisive tie-breaker to emerge winners.

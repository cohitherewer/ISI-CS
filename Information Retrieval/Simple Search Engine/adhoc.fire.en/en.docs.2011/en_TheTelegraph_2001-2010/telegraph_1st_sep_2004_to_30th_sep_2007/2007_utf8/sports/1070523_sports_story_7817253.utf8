The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Gattusos second chance

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

Ominously for Liverpool, AC Milans snarling assassin is sleeping soundly. Gennaro just call him Ringhio or The Growl Gattuso appears strangely at peace with the prospect of a second tilt at Steven Gerrard. 

Certainly, Gattusos face had proved provocation enough for Gerrard. At 0-3 down in the final, the Liverpool captain perceived in those aggressive features the smug look of triumph, and later derided Gattuso as a kitten. Gattuso responds: My only answer to him will be to play my best in Athens. 

What hurts me most are the lies that were said about this game. They said we partied after 45 minutes, and that hurts me. It gives me a rage, and an energy to play. 

Gattuso has already shown what a keen sense he has of the past. On his terms, history cannot be changed Wednesday night it is here to be made.

 Big W is most lucrative

Wimbledon: The total prize money purse at this years Wimbledon championships will make it the most lucrative tennis tournament ever, the All England Club announced on Tuesday. 

Both mens and womens singles champions will receive 700,000 pounds ($1.40 million) as part of a total prize fund of 11,282,710 pounds, up 8.7 percent on the 2006 total. 

The mens champions cheque has increased by 6.9 per cent while the womens has risen by 12 per cent after Wimbledon decided in February to offer equal prize money. 

Because of the tournaments decision to come into line with the other three Grand Slams and offer equal prize money, the overall womens singles prize fund has shot up by 19.8 percent. 

No tennis tournament has ever offered higher prize money than Wimbledon in 2007, Tim Phillips, chairman of the All England Club said. 

We want to reward the players appropriately for the talent, entertainment and drama they bring to the grass courts of Wimbledon. 

Apart from two or three irate letters the reaction to offering equal prize money has been very positive. 

Plans were also unveiled on Tuesday to build a new 4,000-seat Court Two, to be completed by the 2009 championships. A 2,000-seat Court Three is also in the pipeline, although no fixed completion date was given. Court Two, which still allows some fans to stand on terraces, has become know as the graveyard of champions after a string of shock results over the years. 

Building work will begin on the new Court Two immediately after this years championships which conclude on July 8. (Reuters)

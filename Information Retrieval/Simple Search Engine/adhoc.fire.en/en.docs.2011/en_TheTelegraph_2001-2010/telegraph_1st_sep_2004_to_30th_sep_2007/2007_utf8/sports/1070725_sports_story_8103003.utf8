 BCB official resigns

Dhaka: Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) general secretary Mahbub Anam resigned on Tuesday following vice-president Gazi Golam Dastagir who quit last week. 

Anam and Dastagir were linked to major political parties and so had to resign, BCB President Abdul Aziz said. 

Another BCB official said more executives of the board were likely to quit soon.

 Sania awaits medical report 

Hyderabad: Sania Mirzas hopes of a quick return to the courts hung in the balance on Thursday as she was asked to undergo more tests on her injured knee. 

The 20-year-old pulled out of the Qatar Open on Wednesday with a knee injury that she suffered during her first-round win over Italian Romina Oprandi. 

Sania had an MRI done here but the doctors treating her felt a more comprehensive diagnosis was needed to know the full extent of the injury. 

We will know more about the injury on Friday, after the results of the tests have been made available, a spokesperson for Sania said. (PTI)

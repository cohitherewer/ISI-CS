 My dads a super coach, says Sania

Melbourne: Unlike many women tennis stars who share bitter relationship with their parents, Indian icon Sania Mirza enjoys the happiest bond with her father and mentor Imran. The 20-year-old, who shot to fame two years ago at the Australian Open, cites the strong relationship with her father as a reason behind her success. 

My dad has always been a super coach. I mean, he has always been around since I was a kid and I think he understands me, obviously on a personal level. He is my father, we get along great, hes very easy-going. 

That helps a lot because he is very relaxed after a match, before a match. He takes tennis only as a sport and I think thats important. It is a part of life. We both understand it and thats what makes the relationship work, she was quoted as saying in an Australian paper. 

Sania said she had no plans to hire a coach as everything was going fine at the moment. 

I always say never fix whats not broken. When I have a bad patch, or if I do, then maybe we can work on getting a coach, she said. 

Sanias drama-free relationship with her father is a rarity in womens elite tennis. 

Jelena Dokics troubles with her father are widely known while the likes of Mary Pierce, Jennifer Capriati and the Williams sisters have had overbearing fathers. The 22 Grand Slam-winning legend Steffi Graf had her father and first coach Peter jailed for income tax evasion. (PTI)

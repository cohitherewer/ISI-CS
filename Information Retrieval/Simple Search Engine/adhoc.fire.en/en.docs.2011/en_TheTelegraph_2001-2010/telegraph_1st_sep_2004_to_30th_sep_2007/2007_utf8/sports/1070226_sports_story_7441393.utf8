 Sachins Cup exploits

 - Chance to achieve more milestones 

 Sachin Tendulkar 

Chennai: Sachin Tendulkar has set innumerable records in his five World Cup appearances and will be looking to add another chapter to his glittering career as the next edition of crickets biggest extravaganza gets under way in the Caribbean from March 13. 

Sachin was the youngest Indian to play in a World Cup, debuting at 18 years and 304 days against England in Perth (1992). 

He will now be one of the senior-most players to be seen in action in the West Indies, and appears hungry to create a few more firsts. He already has many to his credit in the 33 World Cup matches he has played so far. 

Sachin has been adjudged Man of the Match an enviable eight times, the highest by any player, besides being declared Player of the Tournament at the 2003 World Cup in South Africa where he was also named Man of the Match thrice. 

Sachin has the most runs in World Cups 1732 from 33 matches followed by Javed Miandad (1083), Aravinda de Silva (1064), Viv Richards (1013) and Mark Waugh (1004). Among contemporaries, Australian captain Ricky Ponting is sixth with 998 runs. 

Sachins batting average is at an enviable 59.72 per cent, while he has a strike rate of 87.56. Kapil Dev, however, has the best strike rate so far in World Cups with 115.14. 

Sachin has four centuries in World Cups, sharing the honour Sourav Ganguly and Mark Waugh. 

His centuries are 127 not out versus Kenya in Cuttack (96); 137 against Sri Lanka in Delhi (96), and unbeaten 140 against Kenya in Bristol (99) and 152 against Namibia in Pietermaritzburg in 2003. 

His exploits against Kenya helped him surpass the World Cup aggregate of another batting legend Vivian Richards, who had then tallied 1013 runs in 23 matches. 

The records kept coming he is Indias fastest century-maker, his unbeaten 140 coming off 84 balls, aided by 16 fours and two sixes. He knocked Sunil Gavaskar off this particular perch, the latter having scored a century in 85 balls against New Zealand in Nagpur (1987). 

It was also the third fastest World Cup century after Clive Lloyds 82 ball effort (against Australia at Lords in 1975) and Brian Laras 83-ball century (against South Africa in Karachi in 1996). 

Sachin scored 806 runs in 14 appearances at a strike rate of 67.16 in the two World Cups in 1992 (283 in seven matches with an average of 47.17) and 1996 (523 in seven ties with an average 87.16). 

In 2003, he once again topped the batting with 673 runs in 11 matches for an average of 61.19 and strike rate of 89.25. He was followed by Sourav with 465 runs for an average 58.12 and strike rate 82.30).

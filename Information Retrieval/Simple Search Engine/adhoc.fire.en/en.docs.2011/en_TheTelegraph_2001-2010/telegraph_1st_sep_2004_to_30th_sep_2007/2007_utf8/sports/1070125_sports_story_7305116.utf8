 Justine announces split from husband

 Brussels: Three weeks after pulling out of the Australian Open, Justine Henin-Hardenne announced on Wednesday that she will separate from her husband Yves and return to the WTA Tour in Paris next month. 

The last few weeks were difficult for me and my team. First I must announce to you that Pierre-Yves and I have decided to separate. The reasons are personal. I request of you to respect my privacy, she said on her website. 

They were married in 2002. 

The 24-year-old Henin-Hardenne was runner-up at the Australian Open last year, and forfeiting a start in the years first Grand Slam will also cost her the No. 1 world ranking in Mondays update. 

Last year, she reached the finals at all four Grand Slams, capped by winning her fifth major at the French Open. 

She added the season-ending WTA Tour Championship to finish No. 1 for the second time in her eight-year pro career. 

On the tennis side of things, I have begun training again. I also have slightly altered my schedule. I will play at the Open Gaz de France in early February, she said. 

Its not far from my home, and its always pleasant for me to be in Paris. This will be my first tournament for the season. I hope to find my form, and as usual will give all of myself. Im looking forward to once again giving you exciting emotions.

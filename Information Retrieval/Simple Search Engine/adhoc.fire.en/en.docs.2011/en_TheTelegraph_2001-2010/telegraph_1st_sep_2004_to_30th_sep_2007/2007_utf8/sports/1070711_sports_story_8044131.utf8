Hove: An impressive allround performance by Rudra Pratap Singh and Anil Kumbles wily leg-spin saw India come close to a dramatic win after a tense final days play in the warm-up match against English county champions Sussex on Tuesday. 

RP, 21, was the key to Indias turnaround in the fourth and final day that saw the tourists recover from a middle-order collapse in the second innings and go on to push for a surprise victory. 

First, RP hit a quickfire 41 that helped India post a second innings total of 188 for eight declared and set Sussex a target of 273 from a minimum of 55 overs. 

The Uttar Pradeshi left-arm seamer then returned to claim two for 28 before Kumble wielded his magic. 

The hosts were cruising at 96 for three before they lost four wickets for 27 runs in the space of seven overs and were reduced to 123 for seven. 

Kumble struck in successive overs to dismiss Michael Thornely (11) and opener Richard Montgomerie (59) before returning to account for no. 10 James Kirtley (eight). 

Allrounder Robin Martin-Jenkins, however, thwarted the Indian surge with a resolute knock of 45 not out. 

He added 29 vitals runs for the eighth wicket with former Pakistani offie Saqlain Mushtaq (nine) and later combined with last man Jason Lewry (eight ..) to see his side remain unconquered on 190 for nine. 

Kumble bagged three for 57 while Kerala paceman Sreesanth chipped in with two for 47. India next play a three-day match against England A at Chelmsford ground from Friday. 

The first Test at Lords starts from July 19. 

RP, with his breezy 46-ball knock that contained seven fours, was the dominant partner in a 64-run stand with captain Rahul Dravid. 

The duo lifted the innings that had one stage been reduced to 120 for eight. 

Dravid, who missed the last two days of play due to a strain on his left calf muscle, came out to bat at number seven with Dinesh Karthik as his runner. 

And he batted with a high degree of confidence against both pace and spin to steer his side to safety along with RP who enjoyed himself playing a cameo knock. 

Resuming at 21 for two, India lost quick wickets this morning in face of some impressive bowling by the Sussex bowlers. 

Both Karthik and Yuvraj Singh were given a soul-searching examination in face of some aggressive medium pace bowling by Kirtley, Martin-Jenkins and Lewry. 

VVS Laxman played a glorious on-drive off Martin-Jenkins and square drove Saqlain to the fence before getting out in an unfortunate manner. 

He became a victim of a freak dismissal when his backfoot drive off the same bowler hit the silly point fielder on his boot and ballooned up for Hodd to complete the catch. 

After lunch, Yardy took two wickets off successive balls in his very first over. 

Yardy, bowling his left-arm, accounted for Kumble and Sreesanth, having them caught at short leg.

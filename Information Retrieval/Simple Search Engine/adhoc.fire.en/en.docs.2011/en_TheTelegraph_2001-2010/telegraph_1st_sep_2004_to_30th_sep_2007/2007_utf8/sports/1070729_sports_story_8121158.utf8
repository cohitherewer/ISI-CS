The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I expect Karthik to be among the best: Gower 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Nottingham: Dinesh Karthik, who has been having an excellent run since making his Test comeback (as an opener) in Cape Town earlier this year, has been marked out as one of the batsmen to look out for by former England captain David Gower. 

In years to come, I expect Karthik to be among the best... Hes mature and handles situations well... I was particularly impressed with his second innings 60 at Lords, Gower told The Telegraph on Saturday. 

Coming from one of the most graceful of willow-wielders, its quite a compliment. Karthik, in fact, continued from Lords and got a fine 77 in the first innings of the ongoing second Test here. 

Karthiks scores since the 63 in the first innings in Cape Town have been: 56 and 22 in Chittagong, 129 in Dhaka, 5 and 60 at Lords and the 77. All as Wasim Jaffers partner.

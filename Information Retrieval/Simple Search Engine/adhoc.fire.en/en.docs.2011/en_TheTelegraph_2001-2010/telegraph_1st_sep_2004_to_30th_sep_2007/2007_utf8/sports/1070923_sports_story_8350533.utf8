 Anand holds Gelfand, stays in lead

 Anand 

Mexico City: Viswanathan Anand held on to his sole lead after the eighth round of the World Chess Championship by drawing against his nearest rival Boris Gelfand. 

The second leg of the double round-robin tournament began with an encounter between the two leaders. By drawing with the black pieces, Anand ensured that he remained half a point ahead of Gelfand. 

The Gelfand-Anand draw presented defending champion Vladimir Kramnik with an opportunity to close in on the leader, but he only managed a draw in his game against Peter Svidler and stayed in third place. 

Peter Leko began the second half on a high note by defeating in-form Russian Grandmaster Alexander Grischuk. With his first victory in the tournament, Leko moved into the fourth position pushing Grischuk to the fifth spot. 

Levon Aronian shares the fifth spot with Grischuk after drawing his eighth round game against Alexander Morozevich. 

Gelfand-Anand encounter was a tense one, as Gelfand, playing the white pieces, could have overtaken Anand by winning the game. Anand played a rare continuation against the Catalan opening by developing his bishop to d6 on the 10th move, instead of its more usual deployment on e7. 

After the game, Anand said basically I wanted to surprise Boris with this idea. Bd6. Its a very rare move, but I had done some work on it with Sandipan, some months back. 

The idea worked as planned and Anand was able to obtain a level position by timely breaks in the centre. The players agreed to split point after 20 moves, when there was very little either of them could play for. 

The game between Kramnik and Svidler was also crucial. Svidler made a spirited attempt to raise himself from the last position by playing a sharp attacking game against the defending champion. 

Kramnik played his favourite Petroff defence and Svidler took the ambitious decision of castling on the queenside. The position became very complex in the middle game and Svidlers attack on the kingside looked more dangerous than Kramniks counterplay on the other wing. 

However, Kramnik played resourcefully, combining defence with counterattack. The game ended in a draw after 29 moves by repetition of position. 

Alexander Grischuk suffered his second consecutive loss in the tournament. Grischuk was outplayed by Leko in the same opening with which he lost to Anand in the seventh round. (PTI)

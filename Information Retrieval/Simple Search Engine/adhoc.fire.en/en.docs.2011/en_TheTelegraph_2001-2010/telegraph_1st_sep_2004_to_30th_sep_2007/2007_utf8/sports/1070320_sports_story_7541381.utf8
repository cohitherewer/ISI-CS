 Sasi holds Ponomariov

Zafra (Spain): Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran held former world champion Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine to a draw in the second round of Magistral Ruy Lopez International chess tournament here. 

The Indian, who had drawn from a winning position in the first round against Julio Granda Zuniga of Peru, tried hard to topple Ponomariov but the Ukrainian displayed deep understanding of the game to maintain the balance. 

His second draw in a row did not help Sasikirans cause much as the Indian slipped to joint fourth spot in the standings on one point from two games in this category-15 round robin tournament between eight players. (PTI)

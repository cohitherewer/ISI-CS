Chicago: Ronaldinho scored the decisive goal from a free-kick as Brazil came from behind to beat a feisty United States 4-2 in a friendly on Sunday. 

The Barcelona forward curled the ball through a gap into the wall to put Brazil 3-2 ahead in the 75th minute, two minutes after Clint Dempsey had scored for the hosts to make it 2-2 in an entertaining game on a hot afternoon. 

A last-minute penalty converted by substitute Elano completed Brazils win in a match between the respective Copa America and Concacaf champions. 

Brazil head coach Dunga said the game against an improving American side had been a good test for his team, who begin World Cup qualifiers in October. 

It was difficult for us because of the temperature and a lot of our players are still (getting into shape after the) preseason. The US is a very tactical team and very disciplined, even when theyre behind on the scoresheet, Dunga said. 

The US opened the scoring in the 21st minute when Landon Donovans corner deflected in off the chest of defender Carlos Bocanegra. 

Brazil equalised in the 33rd minute through an Oguchi Onyewu own goal. Kakas shot was saved by US keeper Tim Howard but cannoned off Onyewu into the net. (Reuters)

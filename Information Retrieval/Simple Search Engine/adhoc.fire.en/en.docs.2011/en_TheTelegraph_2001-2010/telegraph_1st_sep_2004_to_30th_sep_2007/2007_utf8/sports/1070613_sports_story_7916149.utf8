 Panesar: I dont aim to take a wicket every ball

SIMON BRIGGS in Manchester

Where would England be without Monty Panesar? In the 16 months since the Sikh arrived in the side, he has established himself as the anchor of this attack. Other bowlers have gone from boom to bust, from sponsors podium to operating table. Panesar just keeps stacking up the wickets, his aim as steady as his manner as excitable. 

Mondays six-for made Panesar the first England spinner to claim 10 in a match since Phil Tufnell, in 1997. And these scalps did not come easily. No batsman in the world could have bettered Shivnarine Chanderpauls impression of a brick wall. 

Yet Panesar was not to be denied. His action remained smooth and grooved, when it would have been so easy to tense up under the burden of expectation. Only his ferocious appealing hinted at the turmoil beneath the turban. 

You dont want to put pressure on yourself by thinking you can take a wicket every ball, Panesar mused later, after claiming the first Man-of-the-Match award of his Test career. 

You just have to try to bowl maidens. There is so much in the pitch that you dont need too much variation. If you can keep the pace and energy on the ball, it will zip out of the rough. Sometimes it kicks up, maybe even as high as the batsmans head. 

This last remark was prompted by the comical moment when Panesar made one leap at Chanderpauls helmet and umpire Aleem Dar signalled that he had bowled his first bouncer of the over. On Mondays form, it is stretching things to suggest that Panesar is a slow bowler at all. His speed came up at an average of 58mph. 

When you see Panesar performing like this, it seems all the more remarkable that Duncan Fletcher should have discounted him during Englands planning for the Ashes series. Panesar was the best bowler last summer just as he has been the best this season. 

It was a costly lapse, but he more than made up for it with his spectacular caught-and-bowled off a full-blooded Darren Sammy straight-drive. The look on Panesars face, as he stared wide-eyed at the ball in his right hand, was priceless: a true champagne moment. 

That one probably surprised the captain, Panesar said. Maybe it did, but everything else about his steely-nerved performance was delightfully predictable.

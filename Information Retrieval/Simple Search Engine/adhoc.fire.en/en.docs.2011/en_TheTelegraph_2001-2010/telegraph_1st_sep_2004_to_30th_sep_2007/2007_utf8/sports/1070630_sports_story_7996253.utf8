 Morgan next ICC chief, Pawar to follow 

 London: David Morgan of England will be the next president of crickets world governing body in 2008 and will be succeeded two years later by Sharad Pawar of India. 

The ICC has returned to its policy of rotating the presidency, so the BCCI chief Pawar will take over from Morgan in 2010, a year before India co-host the World Cup with Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. 

[That the script would unfold this way was reported by The Telegraph earlier this week.] 

After meetings between Morgan, Pawar and ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed, the ICC announced Friday that Morgan will serve as ICC president from 2008 to 2010 and Pawar will serve from 2010 to 2012. 

In the meantime, Morgan will become the ICC president-elect and Pawar becomes the vice-president. 

Pawar, also a Union minister, said: I will be able to do justice (as ICC chief) only after three years when Parliament elections are over. Then I can spare more time. 

The following are the decisions/recommendations arrived at the meeting: 

There has been general agreement that future World Cups should not exceed five weeks. This years World Cup in the Caribbean lasted almost seven. 

It has been agreed upon that two icon series between India-Pakistan and Australia-England will take place every two years. The ICC will also be asked to formulate a new international programme under which a limit to the number of Tests, ODIs and Twenty20 matches in a series will be introduced. A team can play maximum seven Twenty20 International in a year excluding in ICC events. 

If a bowler bowls a front foot no-ball in a ODI, the following delivery will be deemed a free hit and the batsman cannot be dismissed by the bowler from that delivery. The changes would come into effect from October 1. 

It has been decided that an additional fielder would be allowed outside the fielding circle during the second or third power play in a ODI. Besides, in case a one-day innings is reduced, the numbers of overs making up each of the three power plays shall be reduced proportionately. 

There will be a mandatory change of ball after 35 overs of each innings in a ODI, the replacement being a used ball. 

Minimum boundary sizes in all International matches will be increased. The square boundary will measure at least 150 yards (137m) from one side of the ground compared with current 140 yards (128m). The straight boundaries will be increased from 65 yards (60m) to 70 yards (64m) at both ends. 

Zimbabwe Cricket reported it is not yet ready to return to Test cricket. It was agreed ZC would report back when it felt ready to step up so that the ICC board could make a decision on the matter. (Agencies)

Calcutta: Brazilian Carlos Roberto Pereira, who coached East Bengal last season, has switched camp to Mohun Bagan for 2007-08. 

The 61-year-old, who was held accountable for East Bengals lacklustre performance last season, has been roped in by the green-and-maroon brigade for his sheer experience and technical knowledge, Mohun Bagan president Swapan Sadhan Bose said during a press conference on Monday. 

He is contracted for the forthcoming season. Being a professional coach, he can handle the team well. Besides, Pereiras involvement during a match and rapport with players made him the ultimate choice, Bose said. 

In another major development, senior pro Bhaichung Bhutia has been made the captain of the side. The Indian captain, incidentally, had not led any club till the last season despite representing various outfits for last 15 years. S. Dharamjit Singh was made Bhutias deputy. 

In a bid to boost the coaching team, Satyajit Chatterjee, a former Mohun Bagan mid-fielder, was named the assistant coach. Poaching another from the red-and-gold brigade, Mohun Bagan made Hemanta Dora their goalkeeping coach. 

The 30-member squad also includes Mahindra Uniteds N.S. Manju, Peter Siddiqui, Rauf Khan, Lukram James Singh and S. Venkatesh. Four Mohammedan Sporting players, Subhasish Roychowdhury, Habibur Rahman Mondal, Jamir Ali Mondal and Sudheesh Muttath have been also been named in the clubs roster for the next season. 

The forward line will see the inclusion of Ishfaq Ahmed of Dempo to the line-up of Bhutia, Jose Ramirez Barreto, P.C. Lalawmpuia and Ayan Chowdhury.

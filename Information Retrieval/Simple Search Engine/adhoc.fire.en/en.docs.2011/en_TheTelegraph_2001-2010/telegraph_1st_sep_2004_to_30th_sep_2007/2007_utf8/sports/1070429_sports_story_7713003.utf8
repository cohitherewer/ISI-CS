London: Manchester United stormed back from two goals down to beat Everton 4-2 and open up a five-point lead in the Premier League on Saturday as rivals Chelsea were held to a 2-2 draw by Bolton Wanderers. 

With only three games left, United have one hand on the trophy after their England striker Wayne Rooney scored Uniteds vital third goal against his old club in the 78th minute at Goodison Park. Victory was wrapped up by a fourth in stoppage time from youngster Chris Eagles. 

It meant that United, who travel to face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on May 9, have 85 points to the champions 80. 

Title fortunes swung one way and then the other on a thrilling afternoon of sunlit football, with Chelsea at one stage level on points with United as Alex Fergusons men trailed on Merseyside and Chelsea led in West London. 

The biggest drama was at Everton, who were 2-0 up with a deflected free kick by Alan Stubbs after 11 minutes and a superb shot by Manuel Fernandes just after the re-start before the hosts committed two costly blunders. 

Keeper Iain Turner dropped the ball after an easy catch, allowing Uniteds John Shea to rifle home in the 61st minute, and former United defender Phil Neville struck an attempted clearance into his own net seven minutes later. 

Rooney, still unpopular with some Everton fans after he left for United in 2004, got the potentially title-winning goal after riding one tackle and then steering a shot into the right-hand corner. 

Eagles put the result beyond doubt as United staked their claim to a title they could win as early as next weekend, making their game at Chelsea on May 9 a dead fixture. 

The champions, who face United in the FA Cup final on May 19 at Wembley, will regret their missed chance at home on Saturday in a rollercoaster game. 

Slovakia defender Lubomir Michalik gave Bolton a surprise 19th minute lead on his full debut, only for Chelseas Ivorian striker Salomon Kalou to level soon after with a header. 

Kalou was also responsible for Chelseas second goal, sending in a header that struck the crossbar and rebounded into the net off keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen in the 33rd minute. 

But as Chelsea closed in for the kill, Bolton forward Kevin Davies exploited a defensive lapse to head an equaliser soon after the re-start and Sam Allardyces men held on for a point. 

United midfielder Park Ji-sung will be out until next season after undergoing knee surgery, the club said Saturday.

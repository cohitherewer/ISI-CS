 Two-year term for India coach

New Delhi: The Indian teams new coach would be appointed for a tenure of two years, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said on Tuesday. 

A day after constituting a seven-member panel to pick Greg Chappells full-time successor, the BCCI said it was yet to zero in on possible candidates for the job but has decided to give the new coach a couple of years to work with the team. 

We have formed a panel under president Sharad Pawar with three former captains (Sunil Gavaskar, Ravi Shastri and Srinivas Venkatraghavan) and office bearers. We will start working immediately after the World Cup and appoint a new manager and coach for a tenure of two years, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah, who is currently in Kingston, told a news channel. 

We will see who all are available for the job after the World Cup is over, he said.

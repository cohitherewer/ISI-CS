 Woods just makes the cut

Ponte Vedra: Phil Mickelson put behind him a day of scrambling and poor driving by eagling the par-five 16th to snatch a one-shot lead after two rounds of the Players Championship on Friday. 

The American left-hander, joint pacesetter overnight with South African Rory Sabbatini, fired a level-par 72 in blazing afternoon sunshine and swirling breezes at the Tournament Players Club at Sawgrass. 

While Tiger Woods flirted with missing a PGA Tour cut for only the fifth time, Mickelson recovered from four bogeys in eight holes around the turn to finish on five-under 139. 

Unheralded Australian Nathan Green birdied two of the last five holes for a 69 to occupy second place with compatriots Peter Lonard (72) and Rod Pampling (71) a further stroke back in a tie for third. 

Also at three under were American Sean Hair (69) and Swede Carl Pettersson (71).

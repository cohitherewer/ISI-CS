The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Top-3 finish will be nice in Azlan Shah

Stickwork

Gurbux Singh

As it is said, change is difficult but often essential for survival. After a series of debacles, notably the World Cup and Asian Games failures, the Indian hockey is looking for a new beginning under a completely new set of regime. 

Mohinder Pal Singh is now assistant to chief coach Joaquim Carvalho and M.M. Sommaya will assume the technical directors role. We also have a new captain in midfielder Prabodh Tirkey and a bunch of new faces who have made it to the national side thanks to some consistent performances in the Professional Hockey League. 

As it is said, its learning from yesterday and hoping for tomorrow. 

The new coach and the support staff are all former India players and are aware of the demands of international hockey. The Azlan Shah Cup is the immediate challenge for them. A good show in this tournament will surely act as the much-needed impetus towards a better and brighter future. 

I was in Bangalore for selecting the squad and the focus was primarily on youth. The performance of the PHL was given due merit and the youngsters will now have to live up to the expectations. 

Iit was unfortunate to see some seniors skip the three-week long camp. We had expected players like Dilip Tirkey, who was the captain just a few days ago, and Gagan Ajit Singh to join the camp towards the end, but they never came and continued playing in Holland. I think its the right decision to ignore them for the Malaysian tournament. In my opinion, no player should be considered indispensable however great he maybe. Its time the players must get message clearly and immediately. 

During the camp, we discussed on video analysis of matches and involved the junior players in studying the opponents. 

When Cedric DSouza tried to implement this some of seniors abhorred the idea one of the reasons why he left coaching. I believe Joaquim, a member of the 1984 Olympics and 1986 World Cup team, will face little difficulty in dealing with the new generation players. 

I would love to see the team finish among the top three in Malaysia, but our main aim should be the three Olympic qualifiers, beginning early next year. I still feel the recent setbacks are the wake-up calls, and they would assume the proportion of a catastrophe if we fail to play in the Beijing Olympics. 

As far as the Beighton Cup is concerned, Indian Airlines were the deserving champions. Performances of Dhanraj Pillay and Vikram Pillay also impressed me. We had the minister Ashok Bhattacharya as chief guest in the final and he had promised to look into our demand for an astroturf. 

We have some big tournaments coming up. The Asia Cup is going to take place in Chennai. The World Cup has also been allotted to India in 2010. Without an astroturf, hockey in Calcutta will remain aloof from all the excitements. 

As it is said, there are many paths to the top of the mountain, but the view is always the same. We need a push from the players, officials and even the government so that we can start the journey to the top now!

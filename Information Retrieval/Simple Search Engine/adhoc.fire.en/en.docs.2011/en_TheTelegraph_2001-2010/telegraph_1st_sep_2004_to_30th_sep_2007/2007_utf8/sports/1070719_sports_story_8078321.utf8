 Lancashire sign Laxman

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Lancashire County Cricket Club (LCCC) on Tuesday announced that V.V.S. Laxman will join the club at the completion of the Test series against England. 

For the 32-year-old Laxman, this will be his county debut. The Hyderabadi batsman will replace Australian Brad Hodge this summer subject to the approval of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), which is just a formality. 

Laxman told the website: Im so thrilled to be signing for a great club like Lancashire for my first taste of county cricket. 

Its something Ive wanted to do for a long time and hopefully I will play my part in a success season. 

Lancashire cricket manager Mike Watkinson felt Laxmans experience would come in handy for the club.

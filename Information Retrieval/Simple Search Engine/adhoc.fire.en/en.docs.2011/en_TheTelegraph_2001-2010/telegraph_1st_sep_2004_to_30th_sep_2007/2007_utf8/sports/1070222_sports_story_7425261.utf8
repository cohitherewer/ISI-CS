 Gilchrist comes under fire

Melbourne: Defending the staging of Chappell-Hadlee Trophy series, Cricket Australia (CA) has lambasted Adam Gilchrist for suggesting that the tournament was a waste of time and harmful to Australias World Cup preparations. 

CA chief James Sutherland said the body was committed to the series, which started in 2004. We want to play these matches because we want New Zealand to play these matches against us in Australia when its our turn to host them (next season). 

Thats what makes the world go around. While this series hasnt been a success from a Cricket Australia point of view and we havent played as well as we might have, the match in Auckland looked like a great game and the newspapers in New Zealand are talking about it. 

We dont only live for the game of cricket in Australia. We see ourselves having a role in ensuring the game prospers around the world. 

Both Gilchrist and captain Ricky Ponting were allowed to skip the three-game series, in Gilchrists case to remain with his pregnant wife. (PTI)

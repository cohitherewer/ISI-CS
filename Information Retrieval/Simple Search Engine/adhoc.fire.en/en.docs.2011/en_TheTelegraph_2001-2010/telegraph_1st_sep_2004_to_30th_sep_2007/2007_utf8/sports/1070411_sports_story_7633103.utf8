 Under-achievers 

 take on giant-killers today

 Bridgetown: One-day crickets 

 biggest under-achievers England come face to face with specialist 

 giant-killers Bangladesh when the World Cup arrives in Barbados.

 Like England, Bangladesh have 

 one Super Eight victory so far, an impressive win over high-ranking 

 South Africa. Like England, they have also lost to New Zealand 

 and Australia, the two in-form teams of the tournament so 

 far.

 England have limped along, beating 

 Ireland but losing to Sri Lanka and Australia in Super Eight 

 action and New Zealand in group play.

 Neither team is strongly placed 

 to progress to the semi-finals. England coach Duncan Fletcher 

 was forced to defend his embattled captain and opener Michael 

 Vaughan on Monday from criticism that scoring 12 runs in 

 four World Cup innings is not enough.

 After Bangladesh, England also 

 have to face South Africa and the West Indies to have even 

 a slim chance of qualifying for the semi-finals.

 Kevin Pietersen, officially rated 

 as the worlds best one-day batsman, ended a two-year 

 barren spell with his fourth career hundred against Australia 

 on Sunday in Englands seven-wicket defeat in Antigua.

 The newly rebuilt Kensington Oval 

 will be opened to international cricket for the first time 

 on Wednesday and tournament pitch consultant Andy Roberts 

 says it will probably be the opposite of the slow, low grinder 

 Bangladesh won on in Guyana.

 The wicket in Barbados has 

 been playing fairly well in the practice games, he 

 said. There have been lots of runs. The bounce and 

 carry has been good.

 Bangladesh have already beaten 

 India and South Africa in the Caribbean and another major 

 scalp would raise some major questions about world standards.

 But coach Dav Whatmore, who transformed 

 Sri Lanka into world beaters, has worked hard on ironing 

 out weaknesses in fielding and bowling, making up for his 

 teams lack of big pacemen by exploiting his spin options.

 If we beat England we get 

 closer to the semi-finals but for that we have to work really 

 hard, said Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar ahead 

 of the match. 

 Definitely we need to play 

 consistent as well. We dont want to play one good 

 game and then play three bad games. But the South Africa 

 win has increased the confidence and morale in the team.

 The Bangladesh batsmen had a unique 

 training session on Monday. They tried their hand at six-hitting 

 as coach Whatmore used the last half of the early morning 

 session at the Windward Cricket Club to flex some muscle.

 They look a dangerous team. 

 Any team that have beaten India and South Africa in a World 

 Cup have got to be taken seriously, admitted Vaughan.

 (But) I think we are very 

 close to being a really good one-day team, Vaughan 

 still insisted. We are just not winning critical periods 

 and doing enough during the whole game to win the match. 

 Thats disappointing and well need to play well 

 against Bangladesh, South Africa and the West Indies and 

 win those games, but were certainly a team that can 

 do that, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pro League unlikely before Nov.

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The much publicised inaugural Professional League is unlikely to start before November as Lebanon have not agreed to Indias request to play the World Cup qualifiers on an early date. 

All India Football Federation (AIFF) secretary Alberto Colaco said the matches would now be played as per schedule on October 8 and 28. India will play the away match first. 

We are not yet sure when we will start the Professional League, Colaco said. I have to talk to the members before taking a decision. 

The AIFF secretary admitted that it would be difficult to start the Pro League in between the two qualifiers. 

We have to look at several things. We have granted some time to IFA to conduct the Calcutta League, Colaco said. It would be difficult to take back that decision. 

The national camp could be another stumbling block to start the Pro League. I will have to talk to Bob (Houghton), Colaco said. 

With Pro League being almost postponed, the tournaments which may face problems in getting suitable dates are SAFF Cup in Sri Lanka and Durand Cup in Delhi. 

Though both the tournaments are slotted for December, the month could now be consumed for the Professional League. 

Meanwhile, the Federation Cup draw will be held in Delhi on Thursday. The AIFF has allowed the teams to register 25 players by August 27.

 Dravid urges senior batsmen to fire

Bangalore: Rahul Dravid put an end to the speculation surrounding Sachin Tendulkars health saying the senior pro was fine and practised indoors at the National Cricket Academy (NCA). 

Hes fine. Just a little bit of flu, normal cold and cough. He batted indoor today, the Team India skipper said. 

Sachin did not take part in the sessions on Friday and was confined to his hotel room. 

On the upcoming tour, Dravid urged their seasoned batsmen to fire to clinch its first series win in England in 20 years. 

The key is to get some of our batsmen firing. If our experienced batsmen put runs on the board then it gives our bowlers time and a chance to get 20 wickets, Dravid said on the concluding day of the teams training camp at the NCA. 

We have got experience in batting, Sachin (Tendulkar), myself, Sourav (Ganguly), (VVS) Laxman. , he said. 

The last time Indian won a series in England was in 1986 when Kapil Devs side beat the hosts 2-0 in a three-Test rubber. 

Obviously England play well at home and the only team they have lost recently is to Australia. But we have got the players to do well in England in the later part of the English summer, he said. 

We have got a good and young pace bowling attack which hopefully should fire. We also have an experienced spinner in Anil (Kumble). 

India visit England for three Tests and seven ODIs between July 7 and September 8. 

The series is preceded by a visit to Ireland (June 23-july 1), where they play three one-dayers against South Africa and another against the hosts, for a one-off ODI against Pakistan (July 3). 

Dravid also saw a big role for Laxman, who did not get a chance to be in the playing XI in Bangladesh, as the team chose to go in with a five-bowler attack. 

We expect big things from him (Laxman) in England. I am sure he will be given the opportunities, he said. 

Admitting that the bowling attack lacked experience, Dravid said it was also a talented one with a lot of youngsters. 

From the available fast bowlers in the country probably the best have been selected. There are enough practice games to get an opportunity and to learn to bowl in conditions that may help our bowlers. 

Dravid insisted that the team, having made a shocking first round exit in the World Cup, has moved on and the debacle was well behind it. 

Praising Dhonis elevation to the vice captaincy, Dravid said it was a reward for the formers consistency and ability to adapt.

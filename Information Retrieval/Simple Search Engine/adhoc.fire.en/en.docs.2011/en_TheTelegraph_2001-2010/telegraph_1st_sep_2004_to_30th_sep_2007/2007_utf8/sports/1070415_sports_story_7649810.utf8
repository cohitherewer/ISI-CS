 Im game for captaincy, reiterates Yousuf

 Mohammed Yousuf 

Karachi: Pakistans senior batsman Mohammed Yousuf has once again made it clear that he is keen on the captaincy. His comments comes a day after the refusal of Younis Khan to lead the national team. 

Yousuf, Pakistans most senior batsmen after Inzamam-ul Haq and who enjoyed a record-breaking year in 2006 with 1785 Test runs, said he was willing to captain the side if the Pakistan Cricket Board made an offer. 

The PCB has so far not contacted me as yet or made an offer to captain the side. But I have no problems leading the team as I dont see any kind of pressure in the job. 

I think Im a worthy candidate as in the last year I have really proven myself. It has always been an honour to represent Pakistan and it would be a real pleasure to lead the team at this difficult time, Yousuf was quoted as saying by a website. 

He also considered himself a worthy candidate for the position left vacant after Inzamam stepped down following the World Cup debacle. 

I think in the last one year I have proven myself as a senior batsman and I have previous experience of leading the team. It does not bring extra pressure on me. 

I made a hundred in Australia in one of the Tests when I captained the side in place of the injured Inzamam. 

The senior batsman, however, said that whoever was appointed captain should be a senior player and the decision must be taken soon. 

I think the best thing is appoint a senior player and allow him to groom a youngster. 

Yousuf said in the past there had been many instances when they were many ex-captains in the team and players who wanted to lead and this had hurt the interests of the side. 

In the past, in Pakistan sides, there have always been many ex-captains or players who wanted to lead and that hurt the team. That has to be avoided this time. 

In much of the captaincy talk, Yousufs name has been conspicuously downplayed by the PCB. The accent has been on youth; Shoaib Malik has been repeatedly mentioned, so too Salman Butt. 

A few players, however, have voiced concerns about opting for youth, purely for the sake of it, over an established name. 

 The names mentioned are all players who arent really sure of their places in the side. To burden them with leadership isnt a good move, said one. 

Another added, This is Pakistan, not a club or department team. Whoever is chosen should be a regular, proven performer. Some of the younger candidates mentioned havent even performed well recently. How can they be expected to lead a team in which their own position is not certain?

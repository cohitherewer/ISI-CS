 Becks takes Galaxy to final

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

David Beckham opened his Los Angeles Galaxy goal account with a trademark free-kick to send his new team into the inaugural SuperLiga final. 

Beckham scored the opener and set up the second as the Galaxy beat DC United 2-0 in their semi-final meeting at the Home Depot Center last night. 

The England midfielder started the match and played 63 minutes before being subbed midway through the second half and had ice applied to his left ankle after leaving the pitch. 

Beckham was handed the captaincy at Landon Donovans expense for the match and rose to the occasion with a bending 28th minute free-kick that left DC United keeper Troy Perkins helpless. 

The 32-year-old Beckham followed his goal with a perfect pass out of midfield two minutes after the restart which Donovan took to the edge of the area before slotting home to double the Galaxy lead. 

The only blot on his dream start was a first-half booking for a reckless tackle on DC captain Jaime Moreno.

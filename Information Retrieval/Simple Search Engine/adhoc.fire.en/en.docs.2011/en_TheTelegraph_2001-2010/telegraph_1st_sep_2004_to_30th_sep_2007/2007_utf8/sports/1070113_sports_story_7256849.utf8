 Good draw for Sania

 - Australian Open 

 Sania will open vs Shevchuk 

Melbourne: Indias tennis star Sania Mirza was on Friday handed a relatively easy draw as she was pitted against unheralded Ukrainian Olga Shevchuk in the first round of the Australian Open, beginning on Monday. 

The 19-year-old Ukrainian, ranked 103 on the WTA Tour list, had a highest ranking of 92 in February last after she reached the third round at the first Grand Slam of the year. 

Sania, if she reaches the second round, would face winner of the match between Emma Laine of Finland and a qualifier. 

If Sania manages to cross the first two hurdles, she may face Martina Hingis of Switzerland, whom she defeated in their last meeting in the quarter final of the Korea Open in Seoul. 

Among men, Rohan Bopanna failed to make the main draw after losing to Michael Berrer of Germany 6-7 (3-7), 3-6 in the second round of the qualifying event. 

The 290th ranked Bopanna had upset another German Tobias Clemens, ranked 196th, winning 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 in the first round. 

Meanwhile, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal will have some work to do if they are to meet in the final this year. 

Defending champion Federer could meet last years surprise finalist, Marcos Baghdatis, in the quarter finals. 

Second-seeded Nadal could run into Britains Andy Murray in the fourth round and has No.5 James Blake and two-time major winner Lleyton Hewitt also in the bottom quarter of the draw. Federer will play Bjorn Phau of Germany in the first round, while Nadal opens against American Robert Kendrick. 

Top-seeded Maria Sharapova meets Camille Pin of France in her first-round match and could face eighth-seeded Patty Schnyder in the quarter finals. Hingis plays Nathalie Dechy of France in her opening match and could meet fourth-seeded Kim Clijsters in the quarter finals.

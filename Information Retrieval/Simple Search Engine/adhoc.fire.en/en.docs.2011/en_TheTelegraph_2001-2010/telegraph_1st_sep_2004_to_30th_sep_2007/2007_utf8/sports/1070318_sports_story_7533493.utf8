 When Herschelle went berserk

 John Westerby in Basseterre

 Gibbs hits his way into history 

Sooner or later, with world-class batsmen facing part-time bowlers on small grounds, something spectacular was going to happen. Herschelle Gibbs was the man to provide it, becoming the first player to hit six sixes in an over in international cricket. The unfortunate bowler was Daan van Bunge, a tall leg spinner with a gentle action who plays for The Netherlands and used to be on the MCC groundstaff. 

In a game reduced to 40 overs after a delayed start, South Africa had already been making rapid progress when the thirtieth over began. Gibbs came down the wicket to the first ball and drove over wide mid-on. The second and third balls were smeared over mid-off. Not helping himself, Van Bunge then slipped in a full toss that was thumped gratefully over mid-wicket. 

For the last two balls, the bowler attempted to pull his length back, but Gibbs merely retreated to the back foot, pulling the fifth straight back over the bowlers head and swatting the sixth with a horizontal bat over mid-on. Gibbs strode down the wicket, a broad smile on his face, and struck a high five with Jacques Kallis, his partner. Van Bunge collected his cap ruefully, aware that he had earned an unwanted place in the record books. 

The only two other instances of six sixes being hit in professional cricket were by Gary Sobers off Malcolm Nash in a one-day match for Nottinghamshire against Glamorgan in 1968 and Ravi Shastri, the only instance in first-class cricket, off Tilak Raj, for Bombay against Baroda in 1984. 

As a result of Gibbss feat, $1 million will be given to the Habitat for Humanity charity by one of the sponsors of the World Cup. 

The short straight boundaries at Warner Park have always looked vulnerable to big-hitting batsmen and spin bowlers are likely to become an endangered species for the remainder of this group. The minimum requirement for the playing area of an international grounds is 140 yards from end to end. At Warner Park, the measurements are 140 yards and one foot. The over after Gibbs had completed his piece of history, he was caught just inside the boundary attempting another mighty blow, having made 72 from 40 balls. 

He was not the only South Africa batsman to enjoy himself. Kallis raced to a century from 97 balls, finishing unbeaten on 128, while Mark Boucher made an unbeaten 75 from 31 balls, after reaching his half-century off a record 21 deliveries. From their 40 overs, South Africa reached 353 for three, including 18 sixes. 

Incredibly, South Africa had made only four runs in the first five overs of their innings. 

Another record then went as South Africa completed their biggest one-day victory by restricting the Netherlands to a total of 132 for nine in their reply. Ryan ten Doeschate top-scored with a polished 57. 

In the end, if they had been batting for a full 50 overs on a true, easy-paced pitch, they would surely have eclipsed the highest score in one-day International history, the 443 for nine that Sri Lanka made against the Netherlands at Amstelveen last year. 

Perhaps that record will be threatened when a tired Netherlands team must lift themselves to play Australia on Sunday. Ricky Ponting, the Australia captain, was looking on with interest. 

The one player who must have watched Gibbss assault with mixed feelings was AB de Villiers, who had been caught behind for a duck.

 Indian Masters in a spot of trouble

New Delhi: The countrys first European Tour golf event, the $2.5 million Emaar-MGF Indian Masters, has run into troubled waters, the bone of contention being the spots on offer for the Asian Tour players. 

Representatives of the Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI) were conspicuous by their absence when European Tour chief executive George Grady announced that the event would be held at the Delhi Golf Course from February 7-10 next year. 

Grady admitted that the Asian Tour and PGTI could not be brought on board but asserted that negotiations were on with both the parties. Its a shame that we could not have them here, he said. 

Spots for Asian Tour players have been at the centre of the conflict with the PGTI wanting 52 berths for the Asian players and the European Tour allotting 46. 

The PGTI is also miffed with the organisers for counting the likes of Jeev Milkha Singh, Jyoti Randhawa and Mardan Mamat among the Asian Tour players despite their having full cards for the European Tour. 

Grady hinted that the European Tour was unlikely to budge and said that reducing the number of European players could affect the events status. 

Grady said it was too early to name the top draws but Mohamed Juma Buamain, the vice-chairman of promoters Golf in Dubai, confirmed that Ernie Els, Henrik Stetson, Colin Montgomerie, Lee Westwood, Thomas Bjorn and Jeev would play. 

Grady also said that the European Tour was not breaching protocol by not having the Asian Tour on the board. (PTI)

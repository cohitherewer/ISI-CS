 A chronic problem: Lara

Montego Bay: West Indies captain Brian Lara said his team had a chronic problem with batting collapses after they were rolled over for 85 by India in their World Cup warm-up match on Friday. 

Laras side lost six wickets for just nine runs in the middle of a woeful batting display that lasted just 25.5 overs and raised alarm bells just four days before the hosts begin their campaign. 

There is a situation, that I think is a bit chronic, that we are prone to collapses, Lara said after the nine-wicket defeat. But we are not down in the dumps, if you are going to have a performance like that it is better to have it before the tournament starts. 

We know what we have to do, said Lara, who was one of just three West Indian batsman to make double figures. 

It is pretty transparent what happened we did not apply ourselves. You set yourselves targets and we never got to any of them, added Lara. 

But facing an accusation that his team had a laissez faire attitude, Lara stood by his players. 

This is a team that over the past few years has beaten everyone else and we have played some very good cricket. But we have been unpredictable, Lara said later during a press conference. 

I dont think people should be so sarcastic about this team and I dont agree about laissez-faire. I am confident we will bounce back in the competition proper, he said. 

After Fridays game finished early, Lara kept his team behind on the field to practice and then sat down with his players to discuss the defeat. 

We had a chat, similar to ones we have had after other performances like that, and we talked about getting our act together. We tend to be unpredictable, this was not a one-off and it is something we are trying to stamp out, he said. 

Lara said his sides tendency towards dramatic batting collapses reflected an inability to deal well with pressure. 

The pressure of the situation gets to the team. Also with an international side you pick a lot of guys who bat at three or four in their team and they have to adapt to batting in a different role, he said. 

Id prefer it if we were very consistent and not unpredictable. If we want to move ahead, not only in this World Cup but in the years to come then we need to find consistency, added Lara.

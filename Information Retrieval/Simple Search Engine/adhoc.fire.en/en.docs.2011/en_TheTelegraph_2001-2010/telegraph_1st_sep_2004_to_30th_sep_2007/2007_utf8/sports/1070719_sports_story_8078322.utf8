 BCCI reiterates stand on Kapil Dev

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Guwahati: The BCCI on Wednesday reiterated that the ball was in Kapil Devs court and he has to decide whether he wants to stay as chairman of the National Cricket Academy or join the Indian Cricket League (ICL). 

Kapil is the chairman of the ICLs executive board. 

Addressing the media here this evening, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said: We have asked him to decide whether he wants to be with the BCCI or the ICL. It is now up to him. If he does not respond, the BCCI will have to go by the constitution. 

We do not recognise the ICL. We will not permit any of our members or players to associate themselves with any unofficial tournament. We will also not tolerate any of our affiliated state associations to assist the ICL by providing them infrastructural support. 

When asked about the ICLs prospects, Shah admitted that any tournament, whether recognised or not, would definitely help develop the sport. 

Shah is here to attend the foundation laying ceremony of the proposed cricket stadium and club house at Barsapara ground here Thursday.

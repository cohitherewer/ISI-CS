 Djokovic wins 2nd marathon

Nathaniel Vinton

Already ranked third in the world at age 20, Novak Djokovic of Serbia has the tools the powerful serve and the delicate drop shots to challenge for the top spot in tennis. 

But he seems to want to take his time getting there. 

Djokovic had his second marathon session of the tournament Tuesday and advanced after a gruelling match with Argentinas Juan Mnaco, who drew his more well-known opponent into a three-hour-53-minute battle that Djokovic ultimately won, 7-5, 7-6 (2), 6-7 (6), 6-1. 

I had to fight for every point, said Djokovic. I can say that Im pretty happy with my performance. 

The match featured a strange moment when a spare ball fell out of Mnacos pocket and disrupted a point. That was rare enough, but when it happened on a second occasion this time during the third-set tie-breaker officials punished him. Djokovic was awarded a free point, and more importantly, it disrupted Mnacos momentum. 

Obviously rattled, Mnaco lost the next two points before coming back to win the tie breaker and carry the match into the fourth set. 

Nothing like that had ever happened to me, and then it happened twice, said Mnaco. I knew it would cost me a point at an important part of the match. I cursed my pocket and moved on. 

Thousands of fans waited outside Arthur Ashe Stadium to see Justine Henin and Serena Williams play the first match of the night session, but at 7:30 p.m. Djokovic and Mnaco were still grunting their way through the final set. 

It was the second marathon match that Djokovic endured in the tournament, the first being a four-hour-44-minute battle with Radek Stepanek four days earlier. The strain showed on Djokovic, who held up play several times so a trainer could massage his back. 

The Djokovic-Mnaco match started with sunlight on the court and did not finish until well after the sun had set behind the Manhattan skyline. 

Also advancing into the mens quarter finals were Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina, who beat Switzerlands Stanislas Wawrinka, 4-6, 6-2, 7-6 (6), 1-6, 6-4, and Carlos Moy of Spain, who defeated the 88th-ranked Latvian upstart Ernests Gulbis, 7-5, 6-2, 6-7 (5), 6-4. 

The match-up between Moy and Gulbis featured the oldest and youngest men remaining in the tournament, and from the start the 19-year-old Gulbis played the role of powerful but undisciplined youngster. He dusted Moy with 10 aces in the first set but also racked up 21 unforced errors in that set, and 22 in the next.

 Jeev finishes tied 36th

Oakmont: Jeev Milkha Singh showed tremendous grit to card a final-round five-over 75 and finish tied 36th in the US Open on Sunday. This was the Indians best showing in a major. 

Playing in his third US Open, Jeev, ended with an aggregate of 18-over 298, 13 shots behind winner Angel Cabrera of Argentina (275). 

It was not the best of finishes, but I will take back a lot from here, said Jeev, who had also made the cut in his previous two appearances at the US Open. 

Cabrera became the first Argentine to win the US Open as he edged out world No. 1 Tiger Woods (72) and Jim Furyk (70), who shared second place, by one shot. Overnight leader Aaron Baddeley of Australia stuttered to 10-over 80 and finished tied 13th. 

Jeev maintained his streak of having played in all four rounds in all his four major appearances and bettered his previous best of tied 37th. 

Though satisfied with his overall show, Jeev, who picked up $37,159 for his efforts, was unhappy with his putting. My putting was disappointing, said the Indian, who averaged 32.25 putts per round. His best was a 31 in the final round. 

Sure, the greens were tough and sloping made them very testing and challenging, but I wish a few more putts had dropped in. 

Jeev was tied 62nd at his first US Open appearance in Bethpage in 2002 and was tied 59th at Winged Foot last year. 

Birdies at Oakmont were at a premium and Jeev did well to sink seven of them in four days. Woods managed only eight. The difference, of course, was dropped shots, as Jeev had 21 bogeys and two doubles to Woods 12 bogeys and one double. Jeev had six bogeys and one birdie in his final round.

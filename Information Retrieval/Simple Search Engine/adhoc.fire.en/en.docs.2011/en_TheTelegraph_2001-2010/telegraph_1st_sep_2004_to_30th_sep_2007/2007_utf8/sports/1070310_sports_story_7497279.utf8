 I want to justify Dravids faith in me: Sehwag

 Virender Sehwag 

Montego Bay: Elated by captain Rahul Dravids unwavering faith in him, dashing Indian opener Virender Sehwag wants to justify his selection by helping the teams cause in the World Cup. 

The backing Ive received from Dravid has been a huge morale booster. I now want to justify the faith in me and live up to the expectations, said the Delhi opener, who was picked despite scoring just 273 runs in last 15 one-dayers. 

The 28-year-old said he was getting better with every practice session. 

Im quite happy with my form now. Its getting better and better with every session in the nets, he added. 

He also confessed that his prolonged form slump was beginning to take a toll on him and he was trying to deal with the increased pressure through meditation during the World Cup. I started to meditate when I was out of the team. I wanted to calm down too many things running in my head, Sehwag revealed after the Indians had nets here in the morning. 

He has not sought any meditation guru. For Sehwag, its good enough to concentrate on a certain object and it is practice which he intends to continue throughout the World Cup. Everyone has his own way of dealing with pressure some try to relax, other take up yoga while I like to meditate. 

You keep worrying about a lot of things, the things people are saying; the stuff media is writing, all brings its own pressure, he said. 

Sehwags new mantra is to look to bat for 50 overs and the rest would take care of itself. I now try to bat cautiously for first 5-6 overs. My new mindset is that I must stay at the wicket. At the same time you cant be too cautious for if the runs dont come, it brings its own pressure, he said. 

Sehwag said the new gospel in the Indian dressing room was to bat for full quota of 50 overs. 

We are now looking to keep wickets and bat for full quota of overs. Thats the basic strategy of the team for the World Cup. If the top three can give a solid start, the middle order can bat through the slog overs. 

Sehwag believes he deserved to go out of the Indian team after his run of poor scores in South Africa. 

It is true for everyone. If you are not performing then you must go, it doesnt matter if you are a Sehwag or a Tendulkar. Sehwag, along with meditation, is watching the videos of his previous innings to get inspired as well as notice the reasons which made him such a successful presence at the crease. (PTI)

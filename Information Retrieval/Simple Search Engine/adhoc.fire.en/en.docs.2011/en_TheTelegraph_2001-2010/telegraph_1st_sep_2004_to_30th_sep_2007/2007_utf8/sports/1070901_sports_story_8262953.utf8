 Chowrasia makes cut

Bandar Seri Begawan : S.S.P. Chowrasia, trying hard to regain the form, was the lone Indian to make the halfway cut at the Brunei Open on Friday. 

The Calcutta golfer shot a solid three-under 68 to move to tied 15th, up from the overnight 41st in the Asian Tour event. 

However, all other Indians missed the cut. Rahil Gangjee (71), Amritinder Singh (72) and Digvijay Singh (71) failed to make it to the weekend. (PTI)

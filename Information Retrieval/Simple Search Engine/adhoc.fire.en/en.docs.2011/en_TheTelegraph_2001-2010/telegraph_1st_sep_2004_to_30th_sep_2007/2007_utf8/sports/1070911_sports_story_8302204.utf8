 Woods claims title No. 60

Lemont (US): Three days and several hours after the BMW Championship began with lacklustre crowds and soggy weather, it finished with near perfection. Cog Hill channelled its past, finding a summer climate, typical Chicago galleries and a familiar champion. 

Tiger Woods, a three-time winner of the Western Open here who finished the previous two in second place, made few mistakes on Sunday on his way to a two-stroke victory in the third FedEx Cup playoff event. He shot a final-round eight-under-par 63, getting him to 22 under for the tournament. 

Starting off the day, I thought 20 under par was going to be the number, Woods said. But that had to be altered. I figured if I got it to 21, Id be assured of at least getting into a playoff. 

On Cog Hills Dubsdread course, a layout Woods has said he enjoys, he won his 60th PGA Tour event, putting him two short of Arnold Palmer on the career list. 

The Tour Championship next week in Atlanta will determine the winner of the inaugural FedEx Cup and its $10 million prize. 

Woods now leads the FedEx Cup race in points. Phil Mickelson, who entered last week in first but skipped the BMW Championship, fell to third. 

Woods began Sunday one stroke behind the third-round co-leaders, Steve Stricker and Aaron Baddeley. But by the time Stricker, Baddeley and Woods were through the eighth hole, all three were tied at 17 under. There were points when the three were tied at 18 under and 19 under. 

Normally you dont have to make this many birdies, Woods said. But with conditions this soft, the guys are just going to tear this place apart. I think the three of us just got wrapped up in it. We were all making birdies, and we kept pushing each other. 

Woods finished with four birdies on the front nine and four on the back nine. Once he got to 20 under with a birdie at No. 13, nobody could reach him. At that point, playing catch-up to Tiger is tough to do, Stricker said. 

Stricker, a Madison, Wis., resident and an all-American at Illinois, served as the weeks underdog story with a local twist. But he came up short on the back nine, finishing the tournament in third place at 18 under after a fourth-round 68. 

Stricker is in second place in the standings. He will begin the Tour Championship in the same group as Woods, which also happened last week. 

The first couple of rounds playing with Tiger was very rewarding for me, Stricker said. I learned a lot. I learned how to deal with being in his group. I felt comfortable with that. 

Baddeley, 26, quietly continued a strong season, shooting a final-round 66 to reach 20-under 264, a figure that could have won almost any other year at Cog Hill. But Woods finished with a 262, a record 72-hole total for the tournament. 

Steve and I sort of both made him do that, because we were both playing well, Baddeley said. And he just made a couple extra birdies at the finish there to get by us. 

After 17 straight years of having the Western Open and then the BMW Championship at Cog Hill, the tournament will move to Bellerive Country Club in St Louis next year. 

It was only appropriate that Woods won this edition of the tournament, where he received an exemption as an amateur and made the cut. Ive always just loved playing here, Woods said.

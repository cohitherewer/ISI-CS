 Rameez fears for Pak future 

Basseterre: Rameez Raja says he fear for the future of Pakistan following the death of coach Bob Woolmer and Inzamam-ul Haqs decision to resign as captain and quit ODIs. 

All has gone haywire after the World Cup defeat. I fear for Pakistan cricket but I hope it gets back on track, Rameez said. 

Rameez is in the Caribbean as a TV commentator watching at close range the events unfold with Pakistan losing to the West Indies in their first match and then crashing out of the tournament following an upset three-wicket defeat by Ireland. 

Rameez believes Pakistan will have major problems in finding a new coach. After Woolmers death, it will be difficult for Pakistan to find a foreign coach and they will have to rely on former home players, said Rameez, who brought in Woolmer to counter the in-fighting within the team. (AFP)

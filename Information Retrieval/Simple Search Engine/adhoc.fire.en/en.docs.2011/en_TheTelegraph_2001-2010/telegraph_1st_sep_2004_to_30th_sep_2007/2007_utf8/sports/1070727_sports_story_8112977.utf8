 ICL is not a threat: ICC

Johannesburg: The ICC on Thursday allayed fears that the proposed Twenty20 series by the ICL would take some gloss of the inaugural world championships to be staged here in September. 

Cricket manager Dave Richardson dismissed the ICL tournament as a minor event. 

Its a local thing, its not a threat, Richardson said at the launch of the Twenty20 World Championships. 

Its not in conflict with what we are trying to do in South Africa. It isnt an international tournament, he added. (PTI)

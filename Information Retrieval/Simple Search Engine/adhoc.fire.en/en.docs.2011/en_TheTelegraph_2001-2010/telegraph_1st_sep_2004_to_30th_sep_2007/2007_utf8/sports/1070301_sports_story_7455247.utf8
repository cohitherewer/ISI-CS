 ICC failed on Shoaib-Asif issue: Hayden

Melbourne: Matthew Hayden and Andrew Symonds have spelled out Australias resentment and criticised Pakistan for selecting controversial pacemen Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif for the World Cup. 

Hayden said the ICC needed to be firm in such cases and described the whole matter as not fair. He said it was ICCs failure. 

Were all under the same annexe, and that is the ICC. Were all tested equally. So if someones tested positive for a steroid, then they have to have the penalties of the game. Anything short of that is a failure from our governing body, simple as that. 

The question should be: what is ICC doing about this? he said. (PTI)

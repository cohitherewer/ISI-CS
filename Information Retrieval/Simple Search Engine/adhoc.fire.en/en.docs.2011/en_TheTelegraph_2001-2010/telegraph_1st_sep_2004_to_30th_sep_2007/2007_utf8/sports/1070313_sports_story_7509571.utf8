 Inzy: Conditions wont decide the champions

Montego Bay: Pakistan skipper Inzamam-ul Haq has warned the subcontinent teams in the World Cup to stop believing they just need to turn up at the park to win in Caribbean conditions, similar to those back home. 

Even though the pitches could be slow and low, conditions alone would not decide on who emerges champions, Inzamam said. 

He said Australia would start favourites in the 16-nation tournament, given their record in the last decade. They are still favourites because of the record they have had over the past few years. 

Inzamam said his side had enough slow bowlers to take advantage of conditions here. Danish (Kaneria) has come back for us and even though he can be expensive, he is a wicket-taking bowler. He would be well-supported by the likes of Shahid Afridi, Mohammed Hafeez and Shoaib Malik. 

But the burly batsman admitted the late decision to withdraw pace duo Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif made a huge difference to the composition of their side. 

We decided late on it because we wanted to be sure about the medical report. They are our two key bowlers, so its definitely a setback. 

But Asif has played for us only in the last year and we have won without Shoaib in the past. 

Inzamam, the longest-serving international cricketer after Sachin Tendulkar, wanted to see only one similarity in the present tournament to the one where he featured for the first time in 1992. 

Then I was the baby of the team, now I am the most experienced. I was then starting my career, while now I am at the end of it. The only similarity I would like to see is Pakistan winning the World Cup like we did in 1992. 

Reactions are usually harsh in Pakistan if the national side does not do well in big events. Families of players like Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram faced hostile reactions when the team failed to do well in 2003 World Cup. 

In 2003, there were a lot of senior players. This time its only me who would face the brunt of the attack, Inzamam quipped. 

Inzamam, the lynchpin of the side, also said he had not set a deadline to retire and will continue beyond the World Cup, if his form allowed. 

You cant really have deadlines on your career. As long as you perform and are doing well, you would like to continue, Inzamam said.

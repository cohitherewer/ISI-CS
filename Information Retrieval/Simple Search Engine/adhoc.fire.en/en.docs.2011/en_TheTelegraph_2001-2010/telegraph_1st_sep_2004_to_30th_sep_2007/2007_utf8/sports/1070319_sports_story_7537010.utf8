The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Key will be to stay positive, says Wright 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Port of Spain: If there was one man who couldnt hide his disappointment with Team Indias display at the Queens Park Oval on Saturday, it was John Wright. He may not have been in charge but he still couldnt hide his feelings at the end of the day. 

Right from the time the Indian batsmen faltered and Tamim Iqbal gave Bangladesh the flying start none had envisaged, he kept pacing up and down the corridor and the staircase leading up to commentary box, muttering: Theyve got to win this match they cannot let everyone down. 

Wright must have been reminded of the last World Cup when after a low-key performance in the opener against The Netherlands and a loss to Australia in the next, they made it to the final winning nine games in a row. Perhaps this side could take a lesson or two from that South African sojourn. 

Its very disappointing But these things happen at the start of the tournament. Youve got to take it in your stride and move along, Wright told The Telegraph. 

Does he believe India can still progress to the Super Eight? I know its going to be tough. You cannot commit any more errors. The key will be to stay positive. Youll need the runs and should keep the run-rate going your way and take a call from thereon 

Luck will also play its role and hope that it doesnt desert you. Itll not be easy but theres no reason to lose heart. Adversity often brings out the best in a player, the former New Zealand captain remarked.

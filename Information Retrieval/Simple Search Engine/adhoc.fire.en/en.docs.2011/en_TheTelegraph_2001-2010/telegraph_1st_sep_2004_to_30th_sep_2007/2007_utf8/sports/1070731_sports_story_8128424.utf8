The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Id never criticise him

 - THE ICONIC NASSER HUSSAIN ON THE LEGENDARY SACHIN TENDULKAR 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Nasser Hussain 

Nottingham: The other day, one-time South

 African spearhead Allan Donald saluted Sachin Tendulkar as the best hed

 seen. On Monday, a day after the maestro was given out on 91, former England

 captain Nasser Hussain (an icon himself) went more than a step further. 

The following are excerpts from an emotional Sachin-specific

 chat Hussain had with The Telegraph: There has been no better ambassador for cricket than Sachin He goes about his business of getting runs without any fuss Im amazed that hes so overly criticised in India Sometimes Id like to just shake those people I dont think the Indian public has quite realised what theyve got Theyll realise once Sachins gone 

Sachin, for me, is a legend Technically brilliant Mentally brilliant Hes a wonderful guy who never gets involved in controversies The way he has handled 18 years of international cricket is remarkable Id never ever criticise him Hes an incredible man with an incredible brain He has every box ticked An incredible cricketer 

Im aware of the Sachin versus (Brian) Lara debate, but it wasnt necessary Theyre of different types If I had to go to somebody for a hundred, Id go to Sachin If I had only 10 in my pocket and both were on 77, Id go to Lara Lara would entertain, while Sachin is methodical I cant believe that, back in India, Sachin almost gets criticised for getting runs! If Im the captain, Id want my No.4 to get 37 Test hundreds I wouldnt be concerned about flair 

On recent form, however, (Ricky) Pontings the No.1 In my opinion, hes a combination of the two Hes a run-machine too.

 Lee predicts a cracker vs England

Dubai: Australia fast bowler Brett Lee has predicted a cracker of a game when Australia take on England in their World Cup Super Eight match on Sunday in Antigua. 

Its sort of a love-hate situation as both sides would love to win it as much as they hate to lose it, Lee, who missed the tournament through injury, said in Dubai, on Friday. 

But I think the team that have bright chances to upset Australia should they reach the final is New Zealand. If Australia are lucky enough to reach the final, they have to watch out for the Kiwis, said the 30-year-old, in Dubai on a commercial assignment. 

New Zealand play competitive cricket. In the past series too, they defeated us 3-0. Sri Lanka are also playing good cricket. said Lee. (Reuters)

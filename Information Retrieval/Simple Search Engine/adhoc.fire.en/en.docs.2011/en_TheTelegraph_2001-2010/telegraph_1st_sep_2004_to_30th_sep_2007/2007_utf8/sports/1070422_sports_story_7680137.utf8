 Malik needs a strong support system, says Rameez

 Rameez Raja 

Bridgetown: Former captain Rameez Raja stressed the need for a strong system in Pakistan cricket on Saturday, saying a young leader in Shoaib Malik needs support to be successful. 

Pakistan on Thursday appointed Malik as successor to Inzamam-ul Haq after a disastrous and tragic World Cup. 

The 25-year-old Maliks appointment is seen as a step towards the future, something Rameez believed could only be good if the young leader is given strong support. 

On one side it is a good decision because he is gutsy and a team player but he can be emotional and temperamental because he has not been tested at the top level. So he needs a strong system for support, Rameez said. 

I am a bit guarded as well, its young leadership but it can only be good if you strengthen the system which must assure the young talent is not taken hostage by senior players. 

Younis Khan, deputy to Inzamam, declined the offer for personal reasons while some senior players like the prolific Mohammed Yousuf, allrounder Abdul Razzaq and dashing batsman Shahid Afridi were bypassed. 

Rameez, however, backed the decision of appointing a young captain. 

It is the right decision because every team is now looking four years ahead to give it a fresh look and for me it is a chance worth taking. Its now up to Malik to show his capabilities, said Rameez, who played 57 Tests and 198 one-day Internationals for Pakistan. 

When reminded that Malik had thrown a domestic Twenty20 match two years ago, Rameez said the incident was misinterpreted. It was a different scenario and was misinterpreted. It wasnt a case of throwing a match and Malik would now realise how important it would be to keep emotions under control, said the former chief executive of the PCB. 

Malik, incensed over a penalty for slow over-rate, admitted he conceded a match to knock out a rival team from the semi-final. He was later banned for one Test and fined 75 per cent of his two one-day match fees. 

Rameez said Pakistan should take a leaf out of Englands book who disciplined Andrew Flintoff. 

Look how England disciplined Flintoff during the World Cup and have closed the doors of captaincy on him. It should be tight like that and any indiscipline should not be tolerated. 

Malik was also late coach Bob Woolmers first choice as the future captain and wanted the allrounder to be groomed as a leader on the lines of South Africas Graeme Smith. (AFP)

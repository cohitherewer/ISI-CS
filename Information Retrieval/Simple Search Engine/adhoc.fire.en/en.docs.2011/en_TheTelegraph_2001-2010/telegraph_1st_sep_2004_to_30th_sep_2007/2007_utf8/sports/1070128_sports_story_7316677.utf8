The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Top stars may stay away

 NATIONAL GAMES 

New Delhi: Though the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and the Assam government are determined to go ahead with the high-security-risk National Games in Guwahati from February 9, there are indications that some of the top names in Indian sports may be missing from the list of participants. 

According to highly placed IOA sources, the worst hit could be shooting, athletics and weightlifting, the three disciplines which have provided maximum international medals in the past few years. 

Though the sports federations are not ready to accept yet that athletes may opt out fearing terrorist activities, the likes of Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, Manavjit Singh, Jaspal Rana, Gagan Narang, Anju Bobby George or Kunjarani Devi may stay away. 

Athletics events may also be devoid of star power as the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) has decided to send 26 top athletes to South Africa on February 5 for a long-time preparation camp for the 2008 Olympics.

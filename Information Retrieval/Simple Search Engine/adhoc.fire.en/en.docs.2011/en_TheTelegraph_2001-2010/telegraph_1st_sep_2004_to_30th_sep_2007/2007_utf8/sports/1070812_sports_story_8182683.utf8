New Delhi: Anju Bobby George finished third in the long jump at the Bayer-Meeting 2007 in Leverkusen. 

Anju cleared 6.51m, well below her season-best of 6.65m. 

Gomes Naide of Portugal claimed gold with 6.83m, while Bianca Kappler of Germany finished second with 6.73m on Friday. 

Anju started with an effort of 6.48m but slid to 6.39m in her second jump. 

She evoked hopes of a higher finish when she managed 6.51m, but could not better that. 

She registered foul jumps in her fourth and fifth attempts and finished with 6.48m.

 Ribery joins Bayern

Marseille: France midfielder Franck Ribery has joined Bayern Munich on a four-year deal, Olympique Marseille chairman Pape Diouf said on Thursday. 

We have helped Franck to get where he is today and we are not really happy to let him go, Diouf said. 

Bayern will have to pay a 26.0 million Euro ($35.09 million) transfer fee and then an additional 4.0 million if the German club qualify for the Champions League at the end of next season.

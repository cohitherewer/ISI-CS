 Whatmore decision

Dhaka: Indias Test and one-day tour of Bangladesh will be Dav Whatmores last as coach, it was confirmed on Friday. 

Whatmore has decided not to renew his contract, which ends on April 30, but has agreed to coach the team in May when India visit Bangladesh for three one-dayers and two-Test series, a BCB statement said. 

The 53-year-old Australian took over as Bangladesh coach after the 2003 World Cup and has guided the team to 33 wins in 88 ODIs besides their first Test victory, against three draws and 21 defeats. (PTI)

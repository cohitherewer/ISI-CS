 Kaneria: Wrong to ignore Harbhajan

Karachi: Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria feels it was not a good decision by Indian selectors to ignore Harbhajan Singh for the tour of England as pitches favour spin in this time of the year. During this time of the season, the pitches become dry and it spins more. I think it wasnt a good decision to ignore Harbhajan, he was quoted as saying by a local daily on Saturday. The 27-year-old also praised young Indian leg-spinner Piyush Chawla. I saw Chawla bowl really well in Ireland where it was difficult to even hold the ball. I see no reason why he isnt in the Test squad, he said. (PTI)

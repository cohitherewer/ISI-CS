 Sondhi finishes fourth 

New Delhi: Indias Ronjan Singh Sondhi missed the podium finish by one point while Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore failed even to make the finals of the mens double trap event at the ISSF World Cup in lonato, Italy, on Monday. 

Sondhi appeared to be in contention for a medal when he shot a superb 141 (48,48,45) to be just one point adrift of leader Joshua Richmond of the US in the qualification round. But he could not raise the level of his game in the finals where he managed 45 out of 50. Richmond won the gold medal and the Beijing Olympics quota place with a score of 191 (142+49). 

Vitaly Forkeev of Russia bagged the silver with 188 (140+48) and Daniele Dispigno of Italy claimed the bronze at 187 (139+48). 

Olympic silver medallist Rathore finished a distant 23rd with a score of 134 (44,44,46) and another Indian in the fray, Moraad Ali Khan ended 32nd. Khan scored 132 after a disappointing third round of 41 following initial rounds of 44 and 47. (Pti)

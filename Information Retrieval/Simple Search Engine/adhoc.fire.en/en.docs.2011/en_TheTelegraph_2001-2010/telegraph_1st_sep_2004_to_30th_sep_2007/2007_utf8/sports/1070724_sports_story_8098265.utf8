The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Referees turn life-savers 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: In football, match officials often turn out to be villains. But thanks to their heroic deeds, the Indian Football Association (IFA) has been spared major embarrassment more than once in recent times. 

Three players lost consciousness in CFL second division matches this month itself, but timely assistance from the officials saved their lives. 

Assistant referee Biplab Sarkar came to the rescue of Southern Samity goalkeeper Tanmoy Adhikary when the latter fell to the ground following an aerial collision with Batore SC striker A. Sashmal and stopped breathing. 

I found the player unconscious and he was blooding from the mouth. Thanks to our pre-season training on how to deal with such incidents, I tried to revive him through artificial breathing. Thankfully, my effort bore fruit and Tanmoy responded after a few minutes. He was immediately rushed to the hospital and hes fine now, Sarkar told The Telegraph on Monday. 

Ajit Dutta, who was the referee in the Southern Samity versus Batore match, saved two lives West Bengal United goalie Nilotpal Mitra and Behala Youth striker Bidesh Turi under similar circumstances in matches he was on the sidelines. 

Dutta, like Sarkar, thanked IFAs training programme for match officials following the Cristiano Junior tragedy (end-2004) in the Federation Cup final. 

After Juniors unfortunate death, all referees associated with the local and district leagues attended a clinic where we were taught how to go about mouth-to-mouth resuscitation during a match. Its all paying off now, Sarkar said. 

An IFA official admitted that poor ground conditions were putting players at risk. Lack of funds, he added, was coming in the way of improving infrastructure.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 To finish on such a high was just fantastic: Warne 

Sydney: Shane Warnes last individual act in international cricket did not exactly go to plan but the Australian leg-spinner said he still could not have asked for a better farewell. 

Warne was introduced into the attack with England nine wickets down and staring at another massive defeat in the final Ashes Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Friday. The worlds greatest wicket-taker seemed destined to finish his stellar career by capturing one last English scalp but for once the script did not go according to plan when another retiree, Glenn McGrath, snared the final wicket. 

Warnes last ball in Test was a gentle full toss on leg stump which England tailender Steve Harmison promptly dispatched to the boundary. 

It might have been an anticlimax but after the events of the past two weeks, Warne was not complaining. 

The 37-year-old leg-spinner was named Man of the Match in the fourth Test in Melbourne after completing his 37th five-wicket haul and becoming the first player to capture 700 Test wickets. 

He passed 1,000 international wickets in Sydney and smashed an entertaining 71 with the bat to put Australia on course for their first Ashes cleansweep in 86 years. 

To win 5-0 and finish on such a high was just fantastic, he told a news conference. In my 16 international seasons, I dont think Ive been involved in a cricket side thats played relentless and tough cricket like weve played this summer. 

At the moment, were a long way ahead of the next best side...thats not being arrogant, thats just the facts, he said. England are rated the next-best side and to win 5-0, you cant be any more comprehensive than that. 

Ive made some wonderful friends. Friends Ive played with in Australia and that Ive played against Sachin Tendulkar, or (Brian) Lara or Andrew Flintoff thats what its about.

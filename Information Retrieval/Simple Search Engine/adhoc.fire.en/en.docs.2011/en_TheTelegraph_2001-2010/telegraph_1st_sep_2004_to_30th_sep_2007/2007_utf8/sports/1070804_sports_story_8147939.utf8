The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Those who join ICL will 

 get life bans

 - BCCI issues strong warning to players and officials

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Friday fired another salvo at the Indian Cricket League (ICL) saying any player who aligns with the rebel body will be banned for life from playing for the country. 

Secretary Niranjan Shah said: Our stand is very clear. Players who take part in the ICL will never be eligible to play for the country again. It is up to the players to decide what they want to do. 

The Telegraph had reported on June 13 that the BCCI intends coming down with a heavy hand on anybody having anything to do with the League. 

Shah made it clear that the ban would be applicable to youngsters who aspire to play for the country. 

He also said that the BCCI was not worried as the Zee-promoted ICL would attract veterans only. 

The ICL has already signed up former West Indian captain Brian Lara and is said to have approached many other former and current stars from different countries. 

A host of former India players including Kapil Dev, Kiran More, Sandeep Patil, Madanlal and Balwinder Singh Sandhu have joined in various capacities. 

The ICL plans to hold its inaugural Twenty20 league over a period of 45 days starting October. 

The BCCI president, Sharad Pawar, told the media in Bangalore that Kapil appears to be busy with other things. This almost confirms that the former India captain would soon be removed as National Cricket Academy chairman. The BCCI will take a decision on Kapil at its special general body meeting in Mumbai on August 21. 

Reacting to the threat, a ICL spokesman said: It is extremely sad and unfortunate that the biggest national cricket body is impeding efforts by another private body to promote cricket in the country Such arm-twisting will not stop us. We will go ahead and make a success of what we plan to do. 

The BCCIs threat to take action against players who join the ICL drew a stinging reaction from Kapil, who said the hostility towards the series stemmed from its fear of being overshadowed. 

The BCCI should not be threatening players because they cannot perform on the field under fear, Kapil, chairman of ICL executive board, told a news channel. 

The BCCI is scared of ICL. That is the only reason it is not willing to talk to us. 

Kapil also reacted strongly to Pawars statement that the series would be a flop. 

The statement that the BCCI president has made is shameful. If the board thinks that only the national team can attract crowds, then it should stop conducting any domestic tournament.

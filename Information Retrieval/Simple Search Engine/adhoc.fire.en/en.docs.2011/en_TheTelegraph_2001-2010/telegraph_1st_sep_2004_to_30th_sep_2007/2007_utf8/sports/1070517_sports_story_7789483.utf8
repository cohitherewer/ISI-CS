 Qualifier knocks out Sania

 Sania said she knew she would be quite rusty 

New Delhi: Sania Mirzas singles return got off to the worst possible start as she suffered a shocking first-round loss to Argentine qualifier Maria Emilia Salerni in the Morocco Open late on Tuesday. 

According to information received here, the top seed playing her first singles match after a two-month injury layoff lost 2-6, 5-7 in the $145,000, Tier IV event. 

Of course it is disappointing. It was frustrating to be there knowing what I wanted to do, but not being able to execute like before the injury. But thats what lack of match play will do. I knew Id be quite rusty and wouldnt be anywhere close to where I wanted to be, Sania said after the match. 

The Indian ace was let down by her serve. She was broken early and dropped the opening set in under half hour. The 20-year-old fell 1-5 in arrears in the second set before showing her fighting qualities. She staged a mini-comeback to level scores at 5-5 before Salerni wrapped it up. 

Theres a world of difference between your practice sessions and matches. But I was definitely getting into the match in the second set more and more, Sania said. 

Any other time you come from 1-5 down to 5-5, you feel you are absolutely on top mentally But because of my lack of match play I still didnt feel like I was playing great, and the confidence I needed at the end of that set wasnt there, she added. 

The world No. 51 was, however, happy to have survived the match without any trouble in her operated knee. It was obviously good to be back on match court again feeling healthy, my knee didnt hurt one bit. 

Sania will be focusing on doubles now. She and American Vania King will meet Christina Horiato Poulos and Ahsha Rolle in Round 2.

 Fleming: Were delighted with our all-round players

St Johns: All-round strength, which took New Zealand to a 3-0 series win over Australia last month, underpinned an impressive seven-wicket win over the West Indies in the World Cup Super Eight match on Thursday. 

Jacob Oram took three vital top-order wickets with his deceptively lively medium-fast bowling and Scott Styris dismissed captain Brian Lara during 10 economical overs of medium pace off-cutters. Brendon McCullum gave a superbly acrobatic performance behind the stumps to take four catches. 

Neither Oram and McCullum were required to bat, but Styris followed up his 87 not out against England and atoned for running out his skipper Stephen Fleming by scoring an unbeaten 80. 

The upshot was a further two points for New Zealand who now share top spot in the standings with defending champions Australia and are cruising towards a semi-final spot. 

Were delighted with our all-round players at the moment and the all-round qualities they bring to the side which give me so many options and cover so many bases in terms of pitch conditions and batting strength, Fleming told a news conference. 

I believe that is the strength of our side. 

Fleming believes his side is not too far away from a semi-final berth in the 2007 World Cup. 

If we continue the way we are playing, we are not far away. With every win we would get closer to the semi-finals, said Fleming after his sides thumping win over the West Indies on Thursday. 

Fleming said McCullums contribution had been particularly important since an injury to New Zealands best fielder Lou Vincent. 

His keeping has been pretty special. Its the little things hes doing, not just the catches and the work up to the stumps that have been very good, he said. 

The work that hes doing off the ball, the edge hes generating for the side, is very important, especially losing Lou Vincent, who was our key fielder. He stepped up today and a couple of those catches were crucial. 

Oram said he had taken note of the movement obtained by opening bowlers Shane Bond and Michael Mason. 

It was obvious if you had the right areas and got it in the right location, you were going to be in business, he said. 

New Zealand now meet Bangladesh, who defeated them in a warm-up match, on Monday before flying to Guyana for their game against Ireland. 

They then switch to Grenada where they will conclude the second round with games against Sri Lanka, South Africa and Australia. 

We have a few tricky encounters. Bangladesh tripped us in a warm-up game and Ireland have packed off Pakistan and in right conditions can be tricky. But as I said, if we continue to play well, we would be in semi-finals, remarked Fleming.

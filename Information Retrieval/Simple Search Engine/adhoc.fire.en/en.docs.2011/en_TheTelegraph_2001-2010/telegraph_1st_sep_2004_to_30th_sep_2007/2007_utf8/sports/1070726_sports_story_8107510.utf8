Calcutta: India A notched up 489 in their first innings against Zimbabwe Select on Day II of their first four-day match at Harare Sports Club on Wednesday, according to information received here. 

Electing to bat after Mohammed Kaif won the toss, the visitors got off to a brisk start. Robin Uthappa (88 off 85 balls) and his opening partner Cheteshwar Pujara added 56 (63 balls) before the latter fell for nine, edging to the slips. 

Coming in at No. 3, Parthiv Patel made 67, having engaged himself in two half-century stands. Parthiv put on 77 with Uthappa before the latter was caught by Edward Rainsford off Prosper Utseya. Uthappa tore the Zimbabwe Select attack in a knock which included 18 boundaries. 

Parthiv later added 68 with Kaif (63) to consolidate Indias position. After the wicketkeeper-bastmans departure, Kaif and Rohit Sharma (65) took charge, though failed to convert their scores to three figures. 

On Day II, resuming at 331 for five, India A made steady progress as overnight batsman S. Badrinath went on to reach half-century before getting out for 62. 

Irfan Pathan however failed to open his account after he was dismissed by Christopher Mpofu. But Piyush Chawla took the charge with an 87-ball 58. Later V.R.V Singh blazed the hosts attack with a 16-ball 26 which included two fours and two sixes.

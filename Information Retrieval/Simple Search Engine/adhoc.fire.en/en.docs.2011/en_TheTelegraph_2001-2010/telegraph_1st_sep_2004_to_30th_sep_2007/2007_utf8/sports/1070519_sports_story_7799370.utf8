The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mahindra whip Md. Sp. 9-0

 - Black Friday for Calcutta soccer 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

New Delhi: It was Black Friday for Calcutta football as the already demoted Mohammedan Sporting slumped to a 0-9 defeat in their last NFL match against Mahindra United at the Cooperage. 

Mahindras scorers were Mohammed Rafi (3), Philip Mensah (2), Samson Fernandes, Rauf Khan, Steven Dias and Bhola Prasad. 

No team has suffered a heavier defeat in the NFLs history. 

Calcuttas woes were completed when Mohun Bagan lost their final match 0-1 to champions Dempo in Margao. 

Mohammedan Sportings shocking loss was a result of officials deciding to field a relatively junior side. 

Barring Jatin Singh Bisht and Raman Vijayan, no other senior player was taken to Mumbai. So Mohammedan Sporting were sans Madhav Das, Bijen Singh, Noel Wilson and Kuluthangan. 

Some of us have not been paid for months, said a senior footballer. 

Officials are putting the blame on players. They are more concerned about the inter-state transfers than football, claimed an official. 

Coach Biswajit Bhattacharya sounded disgusted. I have already been shown the door. It was my last match. What can I do, he asked. 

Officials decided to field juniors. It was not my decision. There is no atmosphere for playing good football in Mohammedan Sporting. 

Coach-in-waiting Shabbir Ali sounded cautious. I will take over in June, so I should not comment. But then, dont blame officials only. Players, too, will have to take the responsibility. 

Mohammedan secretary Sultan Ahmed said he was simply shocked by the result, while former IFA secretary Subrata Dutta felt it was a blow for Calcutta football. At a time when we are trying to rope in more sponsors for Calcutta football, this result will hurt immensely, Dutta said. No doubt, it is a day of shame.

 WI seek a turnaround in Paradise

Paradise: World Cup hosts West Indies, stung by criticism after three defeats, returned to training on Thursday with Ramnaresh Sarwan saying it was time for the players to be honest with themselves. 

After a three day break, Brian Laras side played an in-house practice match near the village of Paradise on the Eastern coast as they began preparing for Tuesdays Super Eight match with South Africa which they must win to maintain any real hope of progress to the semi-finals. 

Vice-captain Sarwan, one of the top-order batsmen who have been unable to guide the team to a score above 250 in the entire tournament, said the criticism had been expected and the team now needed to give the right response on the field. 

Everyone is free to say their view and we are professionals and we have to come out and give a good performance, he said. 

But we have to be honest with ourselves as well we havent been playing that well and we need to get ourselves together. We have to improve all three departments of the game we need to bat better, bowl better and field better. It is something we have been working on. 

The people are very upset with us but it is a straightforward situation now where we have to win all three games. (Reuters)

 Starlite wins close contest 

 STAR RACER

 Chisty atop Starlite

 Calcutta: Starlite, a strongly fancied Errol Bhungard-trained horse, claimed the 2,000m Pearson Surita Memorial Cup, the main event in Thursdays seven-event card. But jockey Imran Chisty, who partnered the winner, had to ward off a strong challenge from topweighted Active Asset and also from the favourite, Mystro, ridden by C.Rajendra.

 Rajendra was, however, quick to avenge his defeat. In the following event, the 2,000m Baqlava Cup, the jockeys forceful riding of trainer Vijay Singhs favourite, Clockwork, helped him gain the verdict over Errols Remarquable. Rajendra went on to record a double for the trainer through Secret Trooper, and easily lifted the Tambourine Man Plate. Wild Mystery, ridden by S.Shanker, completed Vijays treble in the Star Contender Handicap.

 NBA takes sheen off cricket in WI

Bridgetown: Thirty years ago, they would have taken their place on the conveyor belt, the raw materials for the all-conquering West Indies cricket machine. 

Now young Caribbean men are more likely to be dreaming of making vast amounts of money in Americas NBA than making Test centuries at the Kensington Oval here. 

Cricket authorities in the region try to play down the significance of a sporting exodus but the West Indies almost certain World Cup elimination has brought the problem back into sharp focus. 

A look at the figures is worrying. It is estimated that an Australian Test player will take home around $ 500,000 a year; a West Indies player can earn around $8,000 a Test and $3,000 for every ODI. 

In Grenada, where six Super Eight matches take place from next week, many young men are desperate to leave the island still recovering from the effects of hurricane Ivan in 2005. 

Basketball has provided scholarships for several Grenadian players, East Central University in Oklahoma recruited Ian Adams, Orson Thomas, Lyndon Daniels and Gary James. 

All are expected to make it to the NBA. 

Thats a relief for the young men of an island where over 12 per cent of the working population is unemployed and where poverty and drug use are rife. 

The hegemony of the United States is all-persuasive. Young West Indians grow up on a diet of the NFL and NBA. They aspire not to be Garry Sobers but Michael Jordan, said an editorial of a Carribean news website. 

The author claims that its impossible to find cricket pitches in Georgetown, yet basketball courts are everywhere. 

The riches to be made in the NBA are far in excess of even the inflated fees paid to those currently masquerading as West Indies cricket stars, added the editorial.

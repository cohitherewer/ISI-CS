The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bindra denies Kapil claim

 Sport Briefs

 Calcutta: Inderjit Singh Bindra has contradicted Kapil Devs claim that no one from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had contacted him before he was sacked as chairman of National Cricket Academy, says A Staff Reporter. 

Kapil has been saying ad nauseam that no one from the Board has met him to tell him why he has been relieved of his responsibilities as NCA chairman, the former BCCI president wrote on the website of Punjab Cricket Association. 

Let him touch his heart and admit what had been discussed when he met the Board president on July 16 and then me, a couple of days before the ICL launch. 

Both Sharad Pawar and I made it clear to him that his position as chairman of the National Cricket Academy would be untenable once he had made up his mind to take up the ICL directorship, Bindra wrote. 

PCB incentives 

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board has announced cash incentives for the contracted players for showing loyalty to the national team by resisting lucrative offers from the breakaway Indian Cricket League.

The PCB would award cash prizes in the range of $100,000, $50,000 and $25,000 to the 17 players who have been given central contracts in three categories. The board also announced cash awards for the Under-19 cricketers who recently did well on the tour of England. 

The PCB, meanwhile, heaved a sigh of relief as Mohammed Yousuf promised to talk to the board on the issue of his joining the ICL. The PCB has been trying to talk to Yousuf for the last few weeks but Yousuf was unavailable. 

Patriotic kallis 

Durban: South African allrounder Jacques Kallis, who recently quit vice-captaincy of the national team after being left out of the squad for ICC World Twenty20, has said he was committed to playing for the country and his patriotism was not in question.

If it wasnt about playing for South Africa, if it was about money, then Id be in England or India, Kallis told a newspaper. 

The star player said he had received offers immediately after reports of his unhappiness about being left out of the team were published around the world. 

SC directive 

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday asked the BCCI to constitute a fresh committee to resolve the dispute between the warring associations of Bihar and Jharkhand for the membership of the apex body.

A bench comprising justice B.N. Agrawal and justice P.P. Naolekar granted four months to the BCCI to resolve the issue. 

No surgery 

Colombo: Sri Lankas star spin bowler Muttiah Muralidharan believes he will need just rest not surgery for his nagging shoulder injury, according to his manager. He needs rest for about four weeks and physiotherapy, manager Kushil Gunasekera said on Friday. The off-spinner will return to Colombo on Sunday and be examined by Sri Lankan team physio Tommy Simsek.

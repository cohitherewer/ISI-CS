 Now, BCCI plans Twenty20 league!

Mumbai: The BCCI is planning to organise a high-profile Twenty20 league of its own to counter the challenge posed by the unofficial Indian Cricket League (ICL). 

The plan is still at a formative stage and it is learnt that the legendary Sunil Gavaskar would be asked to head the organising committee of the league to be called professional Cricket League. 

We have been working on something for sometime now, but we are not yet ready to announce anything right now. When we are ready we will let you know, BCCI vice-president and marketing committee chief Lalit Modi said on Thursday. 

The proposal did not come up for discussion at the Special General Meeting of BCCI in Mumbai on Tuesday. There has been no discussion on this in the BCCI, a top source in the board said.

 Mir, Esha best swimmers 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Bengals Akbar Ali Mir and Esha Chakraborty emerged the best swimmers in mens and womens divisions of the Indo-Bangla Games on Tuesday. Mir bagged five golds while Chakraborty had four top-podium finishes in the tournament. 

Bengals overall tally of golds swelled to 38, eight more than Bangladesh on the penultimate day. 

In mens football, Bengals gold-winning celebration turned sour a bit following 1-3 loss to Bangladesh in the inconsequential third match. Lal Rin Deka was Bengals solitary scorer. On the distaff, Bengal and Bangaldesh played out 0-0 draw with the former claiming gold.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 First loss for Mahindra 

Mumbai: Reigning champions Mahindra United suffered their first reversal in the 11th National Football League when they tasted 0-1 defeat at the hands of Sporting Clube de Goa at the Cooperage on Monday. 

Sporting found the match-winner through captain Dudu Omagbemi in the 42nd minute. 

The surprise result not only saw Mahindra squandering a good chance to widen the gap at the top in the ten-team league but it also continued Sportings domination over the Mumbai side, having beaten them for the third straight time. 

Sporting took the lead close to half-time when Dudu netted off a Rajesh Meetei provision from the right flank. 

Meanwhile in Ludhiana, JCT did a fine job by holding Durand Cup champions Dempo SC of Goa to a goalless draw in the fourth round of the 11th National Football League at the Guru Nanak Stadium. 

Both teams exhibited splendid footwork and also weaved good moves but their efforts could not fetch the desired results. 

With this draw, Dempo have garnered 7 points while JCT have secured five.

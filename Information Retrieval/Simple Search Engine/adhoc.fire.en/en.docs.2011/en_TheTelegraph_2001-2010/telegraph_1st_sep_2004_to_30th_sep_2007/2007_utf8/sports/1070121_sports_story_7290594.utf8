Nagpur: A blue-and-white T-shirt with a motif imprinted on it, a vociferous presence marked by continuous clapping to let the world know about their intention and a tricolour... The list of must-haves for The Dada Army isnt too long and the 100-odd supporters have travelled from different parts of the country to lend support to Sourav Ganguly in his comeback one-dayer. 

Whatever you do, we are with you, is these supporters point of view, and it was not hard to see how they have taken the centrestage at the VCA Stadium on Saturday. The New Delhi-based organisation, with a website, is here to salute Sourav who will return to the team on Sunday after 41 one-dayers. 

The South African tour has changed a lot of equations giving the former captain the confidence, which could be gauged from his relaxed look during nets. There was a warm hug from Brian Lara, a cosy discussion with Rahul Dravid and Greg Chappell, an intense fielding drill with Sachin Tendulkar these were the things which made him feel that past is past and the warm-up to the World Cup will begin on the right note. 

Gautam Gambhir will partner Sourav at the top in the opening one-dayer of the Pepsi Cup with Sachin Tendulkar coming lower down. The choice of two lefthanded openers may raise a few eyebrows but the team management had its reasons for the choice. 

We did consider a left-right combination, but two lefthanders will prove effective against the West Indies... The Pakistan side in the recent series has shown that lefthanders are effective against them, Dravid reasoned. 

The Indians have decided to keep out Rudra Pratap Singh, Robin Uthappa and Joginder Singh from the XII. Ramesh Powar will, in all probability, be the 12th man with Dinesh Karthik playing as a specialist batsman. 

Dravid tried to put behind the recent reversals in one-day fortunes and against the West Indies, saying that the confidence level of the team is good. If we can play decent cricket, well get the momentum back. 

This will be a challenge for us. The Windies have performed better than us recently. In October 2005, when we played the Lankans here they were ahead of us in rankings. Cricket is all about turning it around. Weve got to bounce back and make use of the opportunity, Dravid remarked. 

The morning dew will aid lateral movement in the early hours and may prompt the home team to chase rather than set a target. The fifth bowlers role will, however, gain precedence in the subcontinent conditions. 

Personally, Dravid was looking to be back among runs. Till I broke my finger in South Africa, I was happy with my form. Things didnt go as I would have liked in Tests. But one key innings can make a difference. The question is, are you able to play that critical innings! It didnt happen in South Africa and will be a big boost if I can do it here, the captain said. 

Be it opening or the middle-order, one man who seemed keen to prove a point was Sachin. A special session in front of the bowling machine for almost half-an-hour, in the presence of Chappell, with balls pitched just short of that driving length, once again confirmed his enthusiasm. 

West Indies coach Bennett King termed this series as a new challenge and that they were looking to dominate. He wasnt reading too much into the absence of Ramnaresh Sarwan saying, guys who have come here are capable of performing their duties and its also an opportunity for youngsters. quot; 

The visitors, no doubt, will have to do something out of the ordinary to steal the limelight from Sourav.

 Spotlight turns on high-flying Shields

STEWART TENDLER

Mark Shields, the deputy commissioner of the Jamaica Constabulary Force, who finds himself at the helm of investigations into the death of Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer, went to the island to help counter the endemic gun crime, Yardie gangs and drug culture. 

This week, though, the former British policeman had to field questions on an investigation far removed from his previous career as a hostage negotiator, drugs intelligence officer, counter-terrorist manager and down-to-earth station commander in a seaside town. 

And as the mystery surrounding the death of Woolmer, a former England cricketer, thickens, Shields finds the spotlight focused firmly on him. 

Now in his late 40s, Shields first went to Jamaica in 2003 as part of a Scotland Yard investigation into a shoot-to-kill policy among the local police. In 2005, Shields returned to Kingston on long-term secondment after the Jamaican Government decided to recruit internationally to bring fresh minds to bear on the forces problems. 

It has not been easy. Police have been gunned down, there have been arguments about policing and Shields has found himself under the spotlight. It is a new experience for a high-flyer who started his career walking the beat in the City of London force before transferring to CID. At 28, he was head of Special Branch in the City at a time when the area was a priority target for the IRA. 

He won a police scholarship to the University of Essex, took a degree in politics and government and returned to find his patch devastated by the Bishopsgate bomb in 1993. The City force launched its Ring of Steel, a network of CCTV cameras around the Square Mile supported by checkpoints. 

Shields was project manager on the work but after a year was transferred to the National Criminal Intelligence Service, working from Germany as a drugs liaison officer covering Eastern Europe. 

Shields came back to Britain to the more mundane world of policing in Essex but by the late 1990s he had moved, this time to Scotland Yard, where he became chief superintendent in the serious crime directorate, which covers the sharp end of professional villainy, from kidnaps to armed robberies. 

In 2002 he led an operation against an alleged attempt to kidnap Victoria Beckham. 

After arriving in Jamaica, Shields told a local newspaper: Im sometimes put up as the great colonial white expert whos come here with this panacea of knowledge about policing. Ive always tried to say that is not the case. What I can do is bring something else to the table to complement the work thats already being done here.

 Dhoni gifts shirt

Johannesburg: Five years after Sourav Ganguly had taken off his shirt following an Indian victory at the Lords balcony, new captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni went a step further as he took off his shirt at the ground itself and gave it to a young fan. 

As his teammates celebrated a great Indian victory over arch-rivals Pakistan to clinch the World Twenty20, Dhoni was busy attending to a young Indian fan, who got the captains shirt as the souvenir for the memorable win at the Wanderers. (PTI)

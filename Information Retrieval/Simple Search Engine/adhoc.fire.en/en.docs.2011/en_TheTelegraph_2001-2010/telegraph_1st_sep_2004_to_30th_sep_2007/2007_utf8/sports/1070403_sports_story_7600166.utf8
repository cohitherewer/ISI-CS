The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bengal, Goa strongly oppose AIFF move 

- No agreement reached on Pro League 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The All India Football Federation meeting, called to discuss the introduction of Professional League with various units, had an unpleasant and abrupt end on Monday after the federation president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi accused Bengal and Goa of trying to stall the league. 

While the meeting could not reach a conclusion on the issue, Das Munshi went to the extent of saying that he would rather call a meeting of the executive committee and general body to pass the proposal and overrule the two states objections. 

It has been learnt the meeting can be reconvened on April 13. 

Das Munshis outburst came after both the IFA secretary Subrata Dutta and his Goa counterpart Savio Messias expectedly raised objections about AIFFs proposal to prevent top teams of the states from playing in their respective local leagues. 

While insisting they had no problems about the Pro League, both Dutta and Messias made it clear that they would not accept dilution of the state league by fielding a reserve side or junior players of the major teams. 

They spoke the same language that the AIFFs proposal will totally destroy the base of our state league, discourage sponsors and dissuade spectators from coming to the ground. 

The IFA and Goa Football Association representatives also pointed out during the meeting that if the players in the Pro League are not allowed to play in any other tournament, then these players would end up playing not more than just 30 matches in a season. 

According to AIFF sources, Das Munshi suddenly flared up and said Bengal and Goa were trying to put paid to the progress of Indian football. 

Das Munshi, who has been the federation president since the last 19 years, even threatened to quit the office next time. 

I am being blamed for India coming down to No. 165 in Fifa rankings. But when I try to do something, no one cooperates with me, he reportedly maintained during the meeting. 

Later, a member, who didnt wish to be named, felt the AIFF was only trying to drain out the state associations of their sponsors by making the local leagues poorer. 

Perhaps they are planning to do it for the benefit of their own sponsors and the official TV channel, he alleged.

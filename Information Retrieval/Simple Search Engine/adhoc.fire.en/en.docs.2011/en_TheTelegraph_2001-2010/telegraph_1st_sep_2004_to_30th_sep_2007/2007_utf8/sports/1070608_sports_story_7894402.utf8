 Nadal: Im playing my best tennis

JULIET MACUR in Paris

For more than two hours, Rafael Nadal played his quarter final match at the French Open as if he had never seen the man on the opposite side of the net. 

As soon as he stepped on to the court, he knit his brow and glared. Time and again, he rudely aimed his shots out of his opponents reach. Unemotionally, he sent his signature forehands spinning over the net, without consideration that his opponent might be unable to handle them. 

To make it to the final of this tournament, Nadal would not place nice, even for one second, even against his longtime friend and mentor, Carlos Moy. So Nadal went out Wednesday at Roland Garros and disposed of Moy 6-4, 6-3, 6-0. 

So, well, the match was better for me, like than for him, thats for sure, Nadal said later, as he morphed back into the goofy young Spaniard he is off the court. 

Nadal, who turned 21 this week, was only 12 when Moy, a fellow Majorcan, lifted the French Open champions trophy in 1998. Now Nadal is looking to win his third French Open in a row, and his victory against the 30-year-old Moy put him one step closer to that. 

One look at Nadal at the start of the match showed how much he wanted the victory. He had warmed up so thoroughly he was dripping with sweat, his dark shaggy hair matted to his head. He knew he had to be ready against Moy, who had practised with him for many years and knew his moves well. 

After the win, Nadal, seeded second, said he was happy because he had played his best tennis of the tournament. He has not lost a single set here. 

That shows how much better he is to the other guys, said Moy, who had 38 unforced errors to Nadals 15. 

I think that there are just a few players who can, not just not beat him, but even get a set from him, he said. 

Novak Djokovic, seeded sixth, is one of those players. Djokovic, 20, is next in line to play Nadal at Roland Garros. No. 1 Roger Federer will play No. 4 Nikolay Davydenko in the other semi-final. 

Later, Nadal called Djokovic a potential future No. 1 because of his big serve and aggressiveness. Both parts of Djokovics game have improved this year, turning him into one of the few players who could challenge Nadal or Federer for the title here.

Bangalore: The Asian mens team followed the footsteps of their fellow womens team by recording a thumping six-wicket victory over Africa XI in the Afro-Asia Cup twenty20 tie at the Chinnaswamy Stadium here on Tuesday. 

After restricting the Africans to a manageable total of 109 for eight, the Asian batsmen kept their cool in reaching the target for the loss of four wickets in 15.5 overs. 

Bangladeshs Tamim Iqbal led the victory charge early on with a quickfire 30 off 22 balls, including three fours and a six, before he stepped out to spinner Thandi Tshabalala and was easily stumped. 

Iqbal had steadied the rocking Asia boat with a stand of 27 with Tillekeratne Dilshan, who cracked an unbeaten 47 in 36 balls with a six and six fours, after Asia XI were in a spot of bother at 34 for three in the sixth over. 

There was enough firepower in the experienced Asia line-up to weather the cheap dismissals of Pakistans Imran Nazir and Kamran Akmal and Bangladeshs Mohammed Ashraful to cruise home comfortably. 

Dilshan and Asia captain Shoaib Malik (14 not out in 18 balls) ensured the momentum was maintained with a stand of 49 runs in 36 balls for the fifth wicket after coming together with at 61 for four. (PTI)

London: England were agonisingly denied a win over India on the fifth and final day of the first Test at Lords on Monday after bad light and then rain prevented any play after tea and the match was drawn. 

Chasing a stiff target of 380, the Indians were all but out at 282 for when the divine intervention prevented the home team from taking a 1-0 lead in the three-Test series. 

It turned out to be a cruel blow of fate for England who dominated the Test right from the opening day despite a depleted bowling attack and needed only a few more minutes to seal victory. 

India owed their great escape to an 86-run partnership for the sixth wicket between V.V.S. Laxman (39) and Mahendra Singh Dhoni (76 ..). 

Dhoni continued to wage a lonely battle after the loss of Laxman and the last man Sreesanth (four not out) blocked what turned out to be crucial deliveries before the umpires offered them the light. 

Play was finally abandoned for the day half-an-hour before the scheduled cut-off time of 7.00 pm (11.30 pm IST) as light deteriorated and it began to drizzle incessantly. Dhoni batted for 202 minutes, faced 159 balls and hit 10 fours. 

Chris Tremlett (3/52), Ryan Sidebottom (2/42), James Anderson (2/83) and Monty Panesar (2/63) shared the spoils for England. 

India resumed on 137 for three and lost overnight batsmen Sourav Ganguly (40) and Dinesh Karthik (60) within the first half hour, before Laxman and Dhoni fought hard with their stand. 

Sourav, who scored 136 on Test debut at Lords 11 years ago, departed first when he played down the wrong line and was leg-before to left-arm seamer Sidebottom. 

Opener Karthik was soon tempted into edging Anderson to Paul Collingwood at second slip for 60. His three-and-a-half-hour innings did not receive any applause from his teammates on the balcony. 

Dhoni was also fortunate on 21 when umpire Steve Bucknor rejected Panesars leg-before appeal, with the batsman on the back foot. Television replays suggested he was out. He also survived a convincing caught behind appeal off Anderson on 28. 

He and Laxman soon brought up their half-century stand for the sixth wicket before Dhoni flicked Anderson to the long-leg boundary just before lunch. 

However, half an hour after lunch, Tremlett gave england the much-needed breakthrough as he bowled Laxman neck and crop to the one that cut back sharply and hit the top of the stumps. Laxman faced 90 balls and hit five fours. That was 231 for six. 

Anil Kumble was the 14th lbw victim of the match (the record is 17), beaten by a Sidebottom in-swinger and Zaheer Khan was caught down the leg side off debutant Tremlett for a duck. 

Rudra Pratap Singh played an ill-judged attacking shot and was bowled by Panesar for two. That was 263 for nine. 

Anderson, playing his first home Test for three years, took seven wickets in the match and claimed a career best five for 42 in the first innings. 

Sachin Tendulkar became the third-most prolific batsman in Test history in the match by overtaking Steve Waughs tally of 10,927 runs.

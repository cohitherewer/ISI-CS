 Inzy puts up a brave front

Karachi: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq has called on his squad to draw inspiration from their 1992 World Cup victory in Australia to overcome the absence of several key players through injury. 

The Pakistan squad left for the Caribbean on Thursday without Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Asif and allrounder Abdul Razzaq, who were all ruled out due to injuries. 

We are under pressure, but I have great faith in this squad because it has shown fighting qualities in the past, Inzamam said on Thursday. 

We have been doing well over the last two years in one dayers despite injury issues and the players who stepped in have performed very well, he said. We fought like cornered tigers in 1992 and won that tournament. We have to retain that sort of faith in ourselves this time, he added. 

We have couple of very good spinners in the side and they have experience of bowling in Caribbean conditions, he said. 

They can make up for the loss of Shoaib and Asif, he said. 

The last time was a nightmare for me and the team also performed badly. I am keen to make this World Cup a successful one. I know that I have to score runs to pick up the team spirit, said Inzamam.

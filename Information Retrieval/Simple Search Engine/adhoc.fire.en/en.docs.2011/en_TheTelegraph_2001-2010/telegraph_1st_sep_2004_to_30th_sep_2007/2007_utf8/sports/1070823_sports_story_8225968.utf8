 CAB claims Shukla will back out

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bengal allrounder Laxmi Ratan Shukla is learnt to be having second thoughts on joining the Indian Cricket League. Shukla wasnt available for comment, but a senior CAB official claimed that the allrounder would represent Bengal this season. 

Shukla and Rohan Gavaskar are not joining the ICL, the official said. 

Shukla was present during the parading of the players in Mumbai on Monday, but he reportedly didnt sign on the dotted line. 

The CAB, meanwhile, is set to convene a meeting of the selectors Arup Bhattacharya, Barun Burman, Kalyan Chowdhury and Saradindu Mukherjee within a couple of days to decide on the replacements for the players who have joined the ICL. 

We will sit with them and discuss the players who could be promoted to the senior side from the under-22 squad, the official said. 

The CAB may face stiff opposition from the clubs if it wants to bar players who have joined the ICL from taking part in the local tournaments. Most of the players have already received advance payments from the clubs. 

 We have contracted the players and we will try our best to ensure their participation in the local meets, said a club official.

 SA dismiss Bangladesh for 144

Cape Town: Bangladesh paid the price for some reckless batting as South Africa restricted them to 144 in their final group A match of the ICC World Twenty20 at Newlands Saturday. 

Electing to field, the South African bowlers struck early and were also aided by poor shot selection of Bangladeshi batsmen, who were bowled out in 19.3 overs. Shaun Pollock picked up three wickets in 3.3 overs, conceding 40 runs. 

For Bangladesh, Aftab Ahmed was the star performer with his enthralling 14-ball 36, which included five fours and two sixes. However, the rest of the Bangladeshi batsmen failed to make much impact.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Souravs comeback an example: Kaif

 - Hard to start hitting straightaway: Yuvraj 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: For one fitness is a concern, while for the other form, yet Yuvraj Singh and Mohammed Kaif find themselves in the same boat trying hard to make a comeback into the big league. After their team made the final of The Telegraph Twenty20 Cricket Tournament on Saturday at the CC amp;FC, presented by McDowell No.1, Yuvraj-Kaif spoke to the reporters at length. 

The following are excerpts 

On their comeback 

YUVRAJ: I cant give a date Ill take my call only when I feel that Im physically and mentally fit. Thereafter, Ill speak to (John) Gloster. However, Im confident that Ill make the World Cup team But its too far In fact, Im trying to return much early. 

KAIF: Im working hard at the moment. Ill be playing four Ranji one-dayers for UP; some runs under my belt will help I am trying to keep it simple and play my natural game. 

On form and fitness 

YUVRAJ: Obviously, its hard for me to hit around freely, when Im playing after a three-month lay-off. Today, I was on the field for about 22 overs and felt pretty good. 

KAIF: It was not my day in South Africa Perhaps it was not my tour. Sometimes, its just one odd game or series when you dont fare well. In South Africa, I was asked to bat at No.3 However, batting position is not a concern for me. 

On Sachin Tendulkar as vice captain 

YUVRAJ: Rahul and Sachin are the best persons to handle the job. 

On Sourav Gangulys comeback 

YUVRAJ: Great to see Sourav back. Everybody is happy with his return. 

KAIF: His comeback is an example for us.

 Compared to Dhoni, I play boring cricket: Sangakkara 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sri Lanka vice-captain Kumar Sangakkara feels compared to Indias dashing wicketkeeper batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni, he plays boring cricket. 

We are different players with very different goals, he said after Sri Lankas one-and-half-hour practice session under floodlights at the Eden on Tuesday. 

 My job is to play the way I do, the Lankan keeper said, adding I love to watch Dhoni though, he is an exciting player and adds spice to the game. My brand of cricket, effective though it may be, is a more boring one. 

Earlier, the 15-member Sri Lankan squad, led by captain Mahela Jayawardene, landed in city at 12.45 pm from Mumbai. 

They were immediately whisked away to a city hotel under unprecedented police protection. 

Sri Lanka will take on India in the first of the four-match one-day International series at the Eden on Thursday. 

Sangakkara, who has five centuries and 36 fifties in one-day Internationals, credited Sanath Jayasuriya as the key man in their squad. 

When Sanath plays, no one else comes into the picture, the Lankan vice-captain said, adding, you can only sit and watch if he goes into his groove. But that said, every single player in our squad is important and has been contributing steadily to our success. 

The left-handed batsman, whose Test-match CV boasts of 12 hundreds and 22 half-centuries at a very impressive rate of 50.64, feels instead of looking at this series as a build-up to the World Cup, it is a very important one in itself. 

This is a series in itself and our focus is totally on it. Even though our core for the World Cup remains the same, instead of looking too much ahead, we would like to take it on a match by match basis. 

But he admitted that a few grey areas still remain. There are a couple of areas that we would like to brush up and finalise, said the left-hander. 

Admitting that he didnt find time to take a look at the Eden wicket, Sangakkara said, My theory is to go out there and bat. 

But I am definitely excited since this will be my first appearance at the Eden under a fantastic crowd, he added. 

Toeing the same line as his captain and coach Tom Moody, Sangakkara said Sri Lankas 1-6 loss during their last tour of India is long gone and history. 

However, he admitted that the absence of left-arm quickie Chaminda Vaas and talismanic off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan (who have been rested for this tour) would be felt. 

But we consider it as an opportunity for the young blokes in the side, said the wicket-keeper batsman, who will join English County Warwickshire after the World Cup.

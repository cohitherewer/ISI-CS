The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Shah Rukhs wish for Sania, but doubts remain

A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES

Calcutta/Mumbai: The coach who fashioned a fairytale triumph for the Indian womens hockey team on celluloid donned the cheerleaders cap on Wednesday. 

According to a media release, Shah Rukh Khan launched the Chak De Sania campaign and wished her luck for the Sunfeast Open in Calcutta. 

Ironically, the lady in question reiterated her doubts over her participation because of a wrist injury. The Tier III WTA meet begins at the Netaji Indoor Stadium on Monday. 

The 20-year-old reached the third round of the singles and the quarter finals of womens and mixed doubles in the US Open earlier this month, but picked up an injury in the process. 

Its been five-six days since Ive returned to India from New York and havent hit a ball in this period, the world No. 27 told reporters in Mumbai. 

Im going to get on the court in a couple of days and see how it feels. 

Im hoping to play (the Calcutta tournament) but am going to make a decision probably on Sunday or Monday 

Im going to wait till the last second to see how much it has healed. 

Sania has been the top draw in both previous editions of the WTA meet in Calcutta and the organisers are again banking on her presence to draw in big crowds, despite Slovak glamour girl Daniela Hantuchova and Wimbledon finalist Marion Bartoli being in the field this time.

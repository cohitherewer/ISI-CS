The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tiwary waiting to put Cup education into practice

 - Making the India squad is like passing Class XII Ive still got to graduate and, then, do my Masters 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Manoj Tiwary

Calcutta: Manoj Kumar Tiwary (not Tewari) didnt watch the entire Australian innings live on Saturday night, but there still was much to learn from the champions assault in the World Cup final. 

More than the Adam Gilchrist blast, what struck me was the planning neither Gilchrist nor Matthew Hayden took a chance against the in-form Lasith Malinga, but attacked Chaminda Vaas and Dilhara Fernando It proved skill alone doesnt work and youve got to use your head, Tiwary, whose roots are in UPs Pratapgarh, told The Telegraph. 

Speaking after yet another workout at Sporting Union, on Monday evening, the only full-fledged rookie selected for the forthcoming three-match ODI series in Bangladesh added: Actually, Gilchrist gave a reminder about one of the basics if the ball is asking to be hit, then youve got to give it a whack Why give it respect? His was such a brilliantly calculated effort 

If all goes well, Tiwarys debut will be in the opener itself (Mirpur, on May 10) and, so, D-Day isnt far off. In other words, theres little time for the 21-year-old to make his ammo more lethal. 

The just-ended World Cup was, of course, an education its another matter that the iconic Sir Viv Richards feels the tournament mirrored the decline in standards. 

Ive now got a better idea of dominating and not allowing the bowlers to get on top I learnt quite a bit by watching Hayden in the matches leading up to the final Ive also understood that most teams are really increasing the pace in the crucial middle overs, Tiwary, a former India U-19 captain in ODIs, said. 

While Sachin Tendulkars April 1998 exploits in Sharjah drew him to cricket (soccer got elbowed out), Tiwarys current favourite is the bindaas Kevin Pietersen. 

He plays so freely and has all the shots Hes mentally very tough as well and doesnt allow the pressure to sit on him Watching him is such a pleasure. 

Son of Eastern Railway employee Shyam Sundar and housewife Bina, Tiwary is aware of the rising expectations but is intent on not allowing the pressure to overwhelm him. 

Sourav Ganguly has been rested Kapil Dev, however, thinks otherwise but with Tiwary booked on the May 7 flight to Dhaka, Bengal wont go unrepresented. 

Making the India squad is like passing Class XII Ive still got to graduate and, then, do my Masters Kafi lamba safar baki hai and Im ready to work hard. 

Tiwary, incidentally, is a Class X dropout but is looking at options to pursue studies privately. 

Even if hes short on formal education, the right-handed Tiwary (he prefers batting at No.4/5) looks an absolute thoroughbred with the bat. 

He has truly come a long way from breaking into the Calcutta league as a leggie who could bat.

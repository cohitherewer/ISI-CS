 Whatmore expresses surprise

New Delhi: Dav Whatmore on Tuesday expressed surprise at former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatungas advice to Pakistans cricket establishment to avoid him for the coachs job but refused to be dragged into a public argument with him. 

I dont know what his motivations were but he is entitled to his own personal views and I have no desire to get dragged into a public argument with him, Whatmore was quoted as saying by a magazine. 

The facts are that I have indicated my desire to coach Pakistan and, if appointed, I am confident of being able to do an extremely good job with a very talented group of players, he said. 

Whatmore is one of the three Australians, shortlisted by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for appointment as the new coach. But indications have been that Whatmore, and not compatriots Geoff Lawson and Richard Done, might get the job because of his experience of working with Asian teams like Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

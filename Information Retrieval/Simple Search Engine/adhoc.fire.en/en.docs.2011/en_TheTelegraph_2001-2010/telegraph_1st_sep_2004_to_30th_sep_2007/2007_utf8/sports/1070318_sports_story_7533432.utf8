 United, Chelsea win

London: Cristiano Ronaldo inspired Manchester United to a 4-1 rout of Bolton Wanderers on Saturday, but their Premier League lead was kept to six points after defending champions Chelsea beat Sheffield United 3-0. 

United victory, though, was marred by an ankle injury that will sideline England defender Gary Neville for three weeks causing him to miss Euro 2008 qualifiers. 

United moved on to 75 points and a step closer to their first league title since 2003. 

Chelsea are second on 69 points after a comfortable victory following early goals from Ukraine striker Andriy Shevchenko and Ivorian Salomon Kalou. Germany captain Michael Ballack came off the bench to head the third in the 58th minute. (REUTERS)

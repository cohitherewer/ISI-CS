 Call off the World Cup: Donald

London: With police investigations making it clear that Bob Woolmers shocking death was indeed a murder, former South African pacer Allan Donald feels the ICC should immediately call off the World Cup. 

I just dont know how this World Cup can continue under the shadow of what has happened, Donald told a radio station on Friday. World Cup 2007 will be forever remembered for this, he added. 

Donald, who played three World Cups under Woolmers coaching, said he was still trying to come to terms with the shocking turn of events. 

I just cant believe that people can go to these lengths about a game of cricket. I just hope the individual or individuals are brought to justice because Bob was a great man and would never go to the lengths to put his life in danger, he said. 

Donald said though he wants the mega event to be scrapped, Woolmer would have wanted the World Cup to go on, no matter how tough the circumstances. My personal opinion is to call it off, but knowing Bob, he would have wanted this to go ahead, he said. 

Earlier, the ICC chief executive, Malcolm Speed, had made it clear that the tournament would go on as scheduled. 

There is widespread speculation that Woolmers death may be connected to a betting mafia involved in match-fixing, but Donald said he would be gob-smacked if he was involved in anything to do with match-fixing or corruption. 

If anyone suggested Bob had anything to do with bookmakers or match-fixing Id say they were talking rubbish, he said. 

There have been rumours that Bob may have received death threats in the past and theres no doubt fans from Pakistan and India are fanatical, he told a British newspaper before the confirmation that Woolmer had been murdered. 

The only possible link I could see to match-fixing is that someone who lost a lot of money misguidedly sought revenge on Bob. 

It would be enormous if he was murdered, just an incredible shock. If foul play was the cause then cricket will be rocked for months and years to come. 

Defeats and bad results just didnt affect him in the same way they did some people, he said. The paceman said Woolmer had been hugely supportive in the aftermath of South Africas excruciating defeat by Australia in the semi-finals of the 1999 World Cup when Donald was run out off the last ball. 

Bob tried to calm us down. Weve only lost a game of cricket, he kept telling us, and he was right of course. 

Bob was very close to me for the majority of my cricketing career. When his wife rang me to break the news I was ice cold, he said. 

The following are other reactions in alphabetical order: 

Intikhab Alam (Former Pakistan captain and 1992-Cup winning coach): I couldnt have imagined even in my dreams that it could turn out to be a murder case. You cant have more shocking news than this. Those who are travelling with the Pakistan team are not capable enough to handle this issue. I think the Pakistan government should send lawyers to assist the team. 

Harold Dickie Bird (Retd England Test umpire): Theres a real dark shadow over the World Cup. (But) I think Bob would have wanted it to carry on. Im absolutely stunned. He was such a charming man, a wonderful man. This is a very, very sad day for cricket. 

Lindsay Crocker (New Zealand manager): Were not really surprised, its been implied for the last couple of days but its still hard to take in. Theres disbelief. Its sobering to think its come to this, were all down Its taken the gloss off everything this week. Were just trying to come to terms with it. A lot of the management and guys knew Bob. Its horrible thats hes gone this way. 

Zakir Hussain Syed (Former Asian Cricket Council secretary general): The PCB should announce lifelong pension for Woolmers widow Gillian. 

Michael Vaughan (England captain): We are all in complete shock. Our thoughts are with Bobs family. It is a horrific time for world cricket. We all know what a good bloke Bob was. Whatever happens on the field, this incident is a lot bigger because someones life has been taken away. But the World Cup must go on. This great game has to be seen in a great light. Its chalk and cheese (the Flintoff incident). This is totally new territory. This is something I dont think any player has had to deal with in the history of the game. 

Cricket Australia: With the news from the Jamaican police today (Friday), our thoughts at are very much with Woolmers family. This is naturally a distressing time for everyone involved in cricket. We must now allow the relevant authorities appropriate time and space to deal with their investigation into the circumstances surrounding Woolmers death. 

Bangladesh Cricket Board: The news that Bob Woolmer was murdered has shattered us. It is an unexpected event which we cannot yet quite believe. Our hearts go out to his family and we hope that the investigation can get to the bottom of his murder so the perpetrators can be punished. (agencies)

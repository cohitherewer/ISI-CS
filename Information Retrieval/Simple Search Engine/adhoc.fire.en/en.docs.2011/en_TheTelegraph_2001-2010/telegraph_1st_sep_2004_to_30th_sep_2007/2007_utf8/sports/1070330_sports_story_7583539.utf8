 Suleiman Ali in lead

Kathmandu: Indias Suleiman Ali, who suffered a road accident just a fortnight ago, carded an opening round four-under 68 to take the lead at the Surya Nepal Masters on Wednesday. 

Ali equalled his best-ever career score in professional golf. He had brought in a similar card in Round I of the Honda-Siel PGA meet in 2002. 

Firoz Ali was tied sixth, while Parnita Grewal, the first lady to compete in a mens professional golf meet in this part of the world, carded a nine-over 81 to be tied 39th. (PTI)

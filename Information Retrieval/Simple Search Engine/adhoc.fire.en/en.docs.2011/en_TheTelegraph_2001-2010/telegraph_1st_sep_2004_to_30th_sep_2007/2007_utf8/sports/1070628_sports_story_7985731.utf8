 Now, Gelfand holds Anand 

 Viswanathan Anand 

Dortmund: Viswanathan Anand drew with Boris Gelfand of Israel in the third round to maintain his joint second position at the Dortmund Super Grandmasters Chess Meet underway. 

Anand is tied second with four others at 1.5 points apiece, half point adrift of the tournament leaders Vladimir Kramnik and Evgeny Alekseev, both Russian, in the seven round prestigious event. Draw was the order of the day after the competition resumed following a rest day at the Dortmund as none of the four games produced a decisive result and the tournament standings remained unchanged. 

World champion Vladimir Kramnik drew against third seeded GM Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan to stay in the lead. Alekseev drew with Norwegian prodigy Magnus Carlsen while Peter Leko split point with Arkadij Naiditsch, who is lying joint third with Gelfand. 

Anand, playing black pieces against Gelfand, once again relied on the Semi Slav defence as in his first round game against Kramnik. He had little difficulty in obtaining equality from the opening after some clever tactical play. 

The players exchanged three minor pieces and reached a position with a symmetrical pawn structure. The Indian held an advantage in space but did not fancy his winning chances due to reduced material on the board. The players agreed to split the point on the 21st move. 

Mamedyarov adopted a quiet system against the Kramniks Queens Indian defence. Kramnik accepted hanging pawns to increase the scope of his pieces and a thrilling battle appeared to be on the cards. 

In the middle game, Kramnik went in for a forced tactical sequence, which led to large scale trading of pieces and pawns. A roughly level position was reached after the tactical flurry. There was some imbalance in the position but the players decided to play it safe and agreed to a draw after 21 moves. 

Evgeny Alekseev hung on to the lead with a draw against Norwegian prodigy Magnus Carlsen in a Queens Indian defence game. Carlsen, playing white, obtained a technical edge by saddling his opponent with hanging pawns in the endgame. (PTI)

New Delhi: There is good news for India on the eve of the national camp for the World Cup qualifiers against Lebanon. According to the Fifa rankings released on Wednesday, India have moved up by five places to come closer to Lebanon. 

India, who were placed 151 last month, have now gone up to 145th position. Lebanon , who were 135 in August, have suffered a setback and are now placed 144. 

The new rankings have certainly come as a morale booster for Bhaichung Bhutia and his men, whose performance in the Nehru Cup helped in Indias rise in the rankings. India have gained 57 points, the highest by any Asian team this month. 

India were ranked 162 before the Nehru Cup and jumped to 151 last month after routing Cambodia 6-0 in the opening match of the tournament. 

Bangladesh, coached by Syed Nayeemuddin, didnt win a single match in the Nehru Cup but have still moved up a place to 175th. 

Meanwhile, the national camp will begin on Thursday without the six Mahindra United footballers, who will remain busy till the AFC Cup quarter-final away match against Al Nejmeh in Beirut on September 25.

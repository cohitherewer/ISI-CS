Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) officials have lined up a series of meetings in Mumbai from Sunday to Tuesday. 

In the first of the meetings on Sunday, the finance committee headed by Sudhir Nanavati will finalise the accounts and balance sheet ahead of the AGM in September. 

The infrastructure committee, headed by former president Inderjit Singh Bindra to oversee the facilities for the 2011 World Cup, will meet the next day. 

The office-bearers will also meet on the same day informally. 

The Indian Cricket League and the future of Kapil Dev as head of the National Cricket Academy will be high on the agenda. 

Three meetings are scheduled on Tuesday. 

The working committee will meet in the morning, followed by two special general body meetings in the afternoon. 

The agenda includes putting in place a minimum qualification criteria for the national junior and senior selectors, the newly thought-about idea of having a president-elect in waiting and unauthorised tournaments.

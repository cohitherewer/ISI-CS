 United stand on brink of title

London: Manchester United took a giant step towards the Premier League title when they beat Manchester City 1-0 in a one-sided local derby on Saturday. 

The win opened up an eight-point lead over defending champions Chelsea. 

United have 88 points with two matches to play which means Chelsea, on 80 points with three matches to go, must win at Arsenal on Sunday to keep alive their now slim hopes of a third successive championship. 

Although United dominated the match at the City of Manchester Stadium, the game came down to a tale of two penalties one scored by United and one missed by City. 

Cristiano Ronaldo scored for United after 34 minutes, while Darius Vassell saw Edwin van der Sar save his 81st minute penalty with his out-stretched legs. 

It was the second successive home match in which City had missed a penalty. They ended their last home game of the season without a goal in eight successive home matches since New Years Day. 

Their tally of 10 home league goals is the all-time worst record in the English top tier since league football began in 1888. 

Ronaldo, named Englands Footballer of the Year on Friday to add to his Players Player of the Year title, made no mistake from the spot sending the ball wide of Andreas Isaksson for his 23rd United goal of the season. 

It was the perfect way to avenge a vicious stamp Michael Ball executed on Ronaldos ribs after just two minutes which was missed by the match officials. 

If they had seen it, Ball would almost certainly have been red carded, but instead he stayed on the field and committed the foul on Ronaldo that led to the penalty after 34 minutes. 

Ironically it was Ball who won Citys penalty in the closing stages, falling as he ran past Wes Brown. Referee Rob Styles pointed to the spot, but Vassell shot straight at the goalkeeper who saved it with his legs. 

United, recovering from their shattering loss to AC Milan in the Champions League semi-final on Wednesday, dominated from first kick to last and fully deserved to take the lead after going close nine minutes before the penalty. 

United defenders Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand both hit the post with headers before Ronaldos goal 

City rarely threatened and United always looked like winning the match and taking all three points which puts them within touching distance of their first title since 2003.

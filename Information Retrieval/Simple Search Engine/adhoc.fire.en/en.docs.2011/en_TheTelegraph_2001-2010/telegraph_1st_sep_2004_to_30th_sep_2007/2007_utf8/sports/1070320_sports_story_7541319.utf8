The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 He left a huge legacy that we can follow: Buchanan 

 - Bob gave his life to cricket and probably paid for it, says Allan Donald 

Leading cricketing figures have expressed their shock after the death of Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer on Sunday. The following are the reactions from past and present cricketers and officials to the untimely passing away of one of the leading exponents of the game (in alphabetical order): 

AUSTRALIA 

 John Buchanan: Bob has ... been at the forefront of coaching for a long time. I think hes been a person who has certainly been outspoken on key issues, absolutely well-regarded by everybody, and from a coaching perspective, I think hes left a huge legacy that we can all follow. 

 Ricky Ponting: One of our 12th men bringing drinks out told us about it (Woolmers death). Everyone just stood back in shock for quite a while We sometimes get a bit carried away with what we do in sport. But when something like this happens it certainly rams home that there are other things happening around you all the time. 

ENGLAND 

 Harold Dickie Bird: He was a tremendous allrounder for Kent and for England and magnificent coach. 

 MICHAEL VAUGHAN: He was a great talker about the game and had many ideas, and brought new things to the game. Its so hard to know that only five days ago youre in a swimming pool with him and now hes passed away. 

INDIA 

GREG CHAPPELL: I know how demanding a coachs job can be. Its tough and tells on you both physically and mentally. Its important that you find ways to relax. 

 SOURAV GANGULY: I dont think the defeat against Ireland brought about his death. Or for that matter any other related issues. He must have had a heart ailment which he didnt care much about Its definitely a sad day for cricket. 

 K. SRIKKANTH: This (Woolmers death) goes on to show that there is a lot of stress in international cricket. I am sure Greg (Chappell) too must be under stress. There is huge media boom in our country. Definitely, the expectations are high. It does put you under some kind of pressure, but I am sure we all enjoy pressure, but it is unfortunate when it takes the toll. 

SOUTH AFRICA 

DR ALI BACHER: In the modern era, when coaches played a more important role in international cricket, Bob was in the top echelon. During the period that he was our coach between 1994 to 1999 he was unquestionably the outstanding coach in world cricket. 

 ALLAN DONALD: He was a very, very close friend, actually more than as a coach.... He was a very respected man. Bob was an extremely professional man, was an extremely soft person, gave his life to cricket and probably paid for it. 

 SHAUN POLLOCK: My prayers and thoughts are with Gill and the boys. Bob was a friend and a fantastic coach who had a huge impact on my career. 

WEST INDIES 

MICHAEL HOLDING: We go back many years as cricketers and friends. I valued his company. Its a sad day for the sport and the cricketing fraternity. This is totally unexpected. 

 BENNETT KING: Bob was a person who had a good vision of the future and always worked towards improving cricket for both the athletes and the spectators. 

 BRIAN LARA: My immediate thoughts are with his family and the Pakistan team and my deepest condolences go out to them. I had a wonderful relationship with Bob at Warwickshire in 1994 and our relationship continued to grow over the years even though we sat in different dressing rooms. 

 CLIVE LLOYD: The entire West Indies team is quite saddened at the passing of Bob, someone who we had high regard for as a coach, a cricketer and a human being. Cricket would be poorer. 

ZIMBABWE 

 KEVIN CURRAN: Its obviously very tragic for world cricket, very very sad for his family and all his friends. 

THE ICC 

 PERCY SONN: It is difficult to think of a man who was more committed to the betterment of the sport than him. From an ICC perspective, we owe Bob a huge debt of thanks as he played a pivotal role in the development of cricket. 

 MALCOLM SPEED: He was a great cricket man. His life was devoted to cricket. He played, coached and commentated on the game all of his life. He was very passionate about the game. 

Note: Grief has also been expressed by cricket boards of India, South Africa, England, Australia, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

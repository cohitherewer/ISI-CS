The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Hantuchova in semis

SREEMOY TALUKDAR

Calcutta: The match had all the ingredients of another massive upset. Nobody gave the eighth-seeded Yung-Jan Chan of Chinese Taipei much of a chance when she faced the Daniela Hantuchova juggernaut in the quarter finals of the Sunfeast Open at the Netaji Indoor Stadium on Friday. 

Quite like the Marion Bartoli-slayer Vania King, the nimble-footed Chan dribbled around the stadium like a busy bee. 

Before everyone had settled down, the world No.81 broke the Slovak and held her own to build up a neat 3-1 lead. 

Just when the evening crowd started warming up to another interesting result, Hantuchova in a comeback trail after she reached the career-high ranking of world No.5 in 2003 showed that there is a lot of steel behind that lithe frame. 

The second seed soaked in the early pressure, let Chan do the running and pressed home the advantage when it was necessary. The end result a seemingly easy 6-4, 6-1 win that set up a semi-final showdown against talented Russian Maria Kirilenko. 

The fourth seeded Kirilenko (or Masha, as she is affectionately known) had earlier overpowered the dangerous Flavia Pennetta of Italy 6-3, 6-1 in an awesome display of power tennis. 

Placed in an easy draw, the Russian was hardly made to toil by either Neha Uberoi or Ekaterina Ivanova in earlier rounds. 

Carpet is Kirilenkos least favourite surface. Still, the world No.35 who had defeated Pennetta 6-1, 6-2 at Gold Coast this year exuded such confidence that it is difficult to see anyone other than Hantuchova stopping her march to the title in Calcutta. 

The Russians last-four clash against the Slovak on Saturday evening should be a mouth-watering prospect and the de-facto title decider. 

Hantuchova enjoys a 3-0 advantage in head-to-head meetings (most recently in Dubai where she beat Kirilenko 2-6, 6-4, 7-6) but each of her wins were painstaking three-setters where the result could have gone either way. 

The rose-cheeked Slovak was guarded in her post match press conference. 

Its true that I enjoy an advantage Its good to have it at the back of your mind. But she is a dangerous player Itll be an interesting match, she said. The world No.12, though, has the mental edge. 

The hard working Chan matched Hantuchova shot for shot in set No.1. Both players exchanged breaks till the 10th game when the Slovak, who turned pro in May 1999, used all her experience to go 15-40 up with a delectable drop shot. 

Chan lost the game, the set and as it turned out, the match. 

In the second set she was totally out of breath and failed to put up even the semblance of a resistance. 

In other matches, Mariya Koryttsevas massive forehand saw her butcher temperamental Belarusian Tatiana Poutchek 6-4, 6-2 in the days first quarter final encounter. 

The Ukrainian world No.164 will take on British girl Anne Keothavong, who saw off veteran Israelite Tzipora Obziler 6-1, 6-3 to reach her maiden semi-final on the WTA Tour.

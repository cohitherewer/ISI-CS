 Gilchrist suggests cut in ticket prices

St Johns: Australia vice-captain Adam Gilchrist joined the debate about the disappointing World Cup crowds in Antigua on Wednesday by suggesting that the ticket prices be slashed to attract more fans. 

The new Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, with an increased capacity of 19,000 spectators, has been half-full at best for the Super Eight. 

Describing the atmosphere for World Cup matches as sterile, he said: Just talking to the locals, they are very aware of it and very excited for it to be here, but thats not translating into big numbers in the grounds which is disappointing as a player. 

Gilchrist said the cheapest ticket was $US25 which was a lot of money for a local to pay given that the tournament was mostly paid for by sponsorship. 

I dont know the whole pricing policy inside out but I am certain there are some pretty expensive tickets around. Whatever the policy is at the moment it doesnt seem to be working, he said. 

So maybe we can look at dropping the price and having a sale. 

But Gilchrist was optimistic that as the World Cup neared the final stages, crowds would improve.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I have nothing to hide

 - Kapil willing to speak to anybody 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Kapil Dev 

Calcutta: Theres confusion following Board joint-secretary Mohinder Pandoves announcement that former president Inderjit Singh Bindra had been authorised to interact with rebel Kapil Dev. 

Indias only World Cup-winning captain, who replaced Sunil Gavaskar as the National Cricket Academy chairman last September, recently joined the Zee-promoted Indian Cricket League (ICL). 

The Board hasnt recognised the ICL and Kapil, chairman of its executive board, has been threatened with appropriate action after he dared the Sharad Pawar-headed body to sack him. 

Mr Bindra must surely have spoken to him by now, Pandove said on Thursday afternoon. Till late in the evening, though, that hadnt happened. 

I havent talked to Bindra, Kapil told The Telegraph from New Delhi. He added: Of course, Im willing to speak to anybody I dont have anything to hide I havent robbed anybody and dont see myself in the wrong 

According to Kapil, hes simply earning his dal-roti. 

Dal-roti khani hai ki nahin? Ive been employed by the ICL and youve phoned me in the midst of work For me, its a job and Im getting paid As for the controversy, ask the Board. 

The Academy chairmans post is an honorary one. 

Pandove, for his part, pointed out that Pawar had himself decided somebody senior should have a word with Kapil and the assignment landed on Bindras lap. 

Both, by the way, have close ties with Chandigarh. 

Unusually, till very late in the day, Bindra (who is also in New Delhi) didnt take calls on his cell. 

Kapil and Bindra, it may be recalled, have had a hot-cold relationship. It soured after Bindra dramatically alleged in a TV interview (April 2000) that Kapil had offered a Rs 25 lakh inducement to fellow-allrounder Manoj Prabhakar during a 1994 tournament in Sri Lanka. 

That was shortly before the icons outstanding career came to an end. 

As Kapil had been the India coach when Bindra made the allegation, it featured prominently in the CBIs inquiry into match-fixing. He quit some months later. 

Specifically, Bindra had said: The person who offered Rs 25 lakh to Prabhakar to play below potential is an icon in the cricketing world. He is the Michael Jordan of India. He is Kapil Dev. 

Its unclear just how warm the Kapil-Bindra relationship is at this point in time.

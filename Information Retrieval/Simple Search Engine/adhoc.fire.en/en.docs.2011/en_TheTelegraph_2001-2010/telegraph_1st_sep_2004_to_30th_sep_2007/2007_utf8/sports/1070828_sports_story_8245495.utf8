The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Barreto feeling guilty

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Jose Ramirez Barreto on Monday admitted that he should show more restraint on the field following the recent controversies. 

Spitting or slapping a player is not in my system Im a god-fearing man and the Bible doesnt teach me to do such things. But yes, I was involved in some pushing and shoving with the players I know I should have restrained myself on the field. That was a mistake and Im feeling guilty about it, Mohun Bagans Brazilian ball-charmer said. 

Barreto has been accused of spitting at East Bengals Madhab Das and slapping Nirapada Mondal of Mohammedan Sporting. People look on me as an ambassador of the game. Im sorry if I have failed to live up to that expectation, he added. 

The Brazilian was all praise for his teammate and India captain Bhaichung Bhutia. Hes in excellent form and Im looking forward to an association with him in the Federation Cup. Because of Bhaichungs performance, Im backing India in the Nehru Cup final, Barreto said.

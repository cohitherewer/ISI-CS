 Nadal racks up 3rd Rome Masters title

Rome: Rafael Nadal racked up his third Rome Masters title in a row when he cruised to a 6-2, 6-2 victory over sixth seed Fernando Gonzalez on Sunday. The world No. 2 had few problems beating Chilean Gonzalez, who struggled to get back into the final after making an error-riddled start. 

The win gave Nadal his 13th consecutive claycourt title and extended his winning streak on the surface to 77 matches. 

The Spaniard also equalled Thomas Musters professional-era record of three Rome victories, though the Austrian won his over a period of seven years, in 1990, 1995 and 1996. 

Meanwhile, third seed Indo-Czech pair of Leander Paes and Martin Damm went out of the Rome Masters title race following their 3-6, 4-6 semi-final loss to the sixth-seeded Fabrice Santoro and Nenad Zimonjic on Saturday (briefly reported in Sundays Late City edition). (Reuters)

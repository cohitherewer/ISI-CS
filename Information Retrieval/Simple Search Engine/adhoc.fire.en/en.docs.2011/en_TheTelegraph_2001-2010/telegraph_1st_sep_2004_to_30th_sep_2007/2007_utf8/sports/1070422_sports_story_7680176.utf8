 Paradorn to wed beauty queen

Bangkok: Thailands tennis hero Paradorn Srichaphan is engaged to a former Miss Universe and the couple are expected to tie the knot here later this year, according to media reports. 

Paradorn, 28, and Natalie Glebova, a 25-year-old Canadian beauty, have developed a special relationship and they will announce their engagement at a news conference on Tuesday, the English daily said. 

The couple will tie the knot by the end of this year in one of the most celebrated weddings of 2007, the paper said. Another daily said the wedding would likely take place in November. 

Paradorn, the former world No. 9, and Glebova were first seen together last year when she kissed him as a reward for beating Britains Tim Henman in the quarter finals of the Thailand Open. 

Glebova, who won the 2005 Miss Universe title in the pageant held in Thailand, is also popular here. (AFP)

 Jeev manages tied 26th

Milan: Jeev Milkha Singh squandered the advantage of a strong second round by carding a level-par 72 to finish tied 26th, while Jyoti Randhawa settled for tied 47th in the rain-shortened third and final round of the Telecom Italia Open. 

After heavy rain resulted in a waterlogged course, the organisers restricted the event to 54 holes. Jeev shot back into contention with a sparkling show, but damaged his chances of a top-three finish by dropping three bogeys and an equal number of birdies. 

Spains Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano won the title.

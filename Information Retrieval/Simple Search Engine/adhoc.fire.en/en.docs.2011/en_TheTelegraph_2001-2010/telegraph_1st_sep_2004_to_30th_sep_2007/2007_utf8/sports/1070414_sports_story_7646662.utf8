 Sponsors miss out on Irish bargain

Bridgetown: The Irish team would have been grateful if any sponsor had handed them a $60,000 cheque before the World Cup. In a matter of four weeks, backing the Irish team has become a much more expensive venture. 

It would have been nice if a major company had that leap of faith in us before we came out and boy would they have reaped the benefit if they had taken the chance, team manager Roy Torrens said. 

If somebody would have come in with as little as 30,000 ($59,270) they could have had a great deal more television exposure than was first expected. If they come along with 30,000 now they might be shown the door! 

Ireland were unable to endorse regular sponsor Bank of Ireland because their business clashed with an official tournament sponsor. They approached other backers instead but were rebuffed. (Reuters)

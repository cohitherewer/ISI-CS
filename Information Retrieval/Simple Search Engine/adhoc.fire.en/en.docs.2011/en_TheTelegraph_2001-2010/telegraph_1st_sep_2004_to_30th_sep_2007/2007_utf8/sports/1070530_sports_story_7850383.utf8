 Ravi Shastri 

 I am a left-handed opener. I have this tendency to pull the ball from outside the off stump and as a result get caught in the mid wicket region. Why does this happen?

 (Pritam Das, 14, Calcutta-61)

 You are opening the bat at time of contact. Make sure you roll your wrists at time of contact to keep the ball down.

 I am a left-arm mediumpacer. Despite my best efforts and coachs advice I fail to swing the ball. Please help.

 (Ayan Mukherjee, 14, Calcutta)

 Work on the grip and wrist action at time of delivery. Also getting side on at that time will help.

 I am a right-handed batsman. Whenever I try to sweep the ball, it balloons up in the air. Why does this happen?

 You are either sweeping against the spin or choosing the wrong length to sweep.

 I am a right-handed batsman. I stand outside the crease to counter the swing but still fall prey to the moving ball. I get caught in the slips. Please help

 Dont go at the ball with hard hands. Play late and allow the ball to come to you. Focus on timing rather than power.

 I am a right-handed batsman. Whenever I play forward to an off-spinner, I end up getting caught at forward short leg. Please help.

 Try and get closer to the pitch of the ball so that you can smother the spin.

 What is the right way to play the cover drive?

 (Sanjib Thakur, 16, Calcutta)

 Your front toe should be pointing in the position where you want the ball to go. In this case the covers.

 I am a right-handed batsman. I cannot judge whether a delivery is yorker or overpitched. Please help.

 (Solomon Rodrigues, 18, Calcutta-17)

 Curtail your backlift and see if it makes a difference.

 I am a left-handed batsman. I have a high backlift and that leads to problems when tackling short-pitched deliveries. Please help.

 (Subir Pattnaik, 19, Balasore)

 Use the depth of the crease and keep your eyes on the ball. Also adjust your backlift so that you have time.

 I am a right-handed batsman. I often get caught at square leg when trying to play the bouncer. Please help.

 (Manohar Jha, 16, Jamshedpur)

 Roll your wrists at time of contact.

 I would like to know how yoga can help a cricketer besides improving on concentration?

 Huge help with flexibility and focus.

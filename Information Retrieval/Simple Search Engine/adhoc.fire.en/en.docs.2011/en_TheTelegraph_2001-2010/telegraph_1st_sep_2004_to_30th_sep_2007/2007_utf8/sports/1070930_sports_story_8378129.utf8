 PCB asks Shoaib to show cause

Karachi: The PCB disciplinary committee has served a showcause notice on fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar asking him to explain why further action should not be taken against him for his brawl with teammate Mohammed Asif in South Africa. 

Shafqat Naghmi, chief executive of the PCB, is heading the three-member committee that sent the notice. 

A show cause has been sent to Shoaib and outlining the charges against him and why no further action should be take against him. He has been summoned to appear before the committee and give his version of the events on October 6. 

We will also call the two other key figures in this incident the same day, Naghmi said. 

Shoaib had made an unceremonious exit before the start of the World Twenty20 for hitting Asif with a bat. 

Flamboyant allrounder Shahid Afridi was present when the incident occurred and is the sole witness to the sordid episode. 

However, Shoaib claimed that it was Afridi who had instigated him by using abusive language and that he (Shoaib) had hit Asif accidentally and immediately apologised to him and later the entire team. (PTI)

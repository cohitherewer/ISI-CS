 Razzaq blames it on Ashraf, selectors

Karachi: Allrounder Abdul Razzaq, who announced retirement and joined the Indian Cricket League (ICL), has said he was keen on resuming his Pakistan career but did not see it happening with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf and present selection committee in place. 

I will not change my decision with these people in power. But yes if they are changed then I would come back. Because I dont expect to get any merit or justice from them, he said. 

They are just willing to talk about my last 15 matches but nothing about my previous performances. I think I deserve a permanent place in the one-day side even now, he said. 

But he also made it clear that he was not regretting his last weeks decision to retire.

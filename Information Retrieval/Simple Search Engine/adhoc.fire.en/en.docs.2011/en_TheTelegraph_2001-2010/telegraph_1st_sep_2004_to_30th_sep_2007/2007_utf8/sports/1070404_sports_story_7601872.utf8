 Dog bites Gonzalez 

Santiago: Top Chilean tennis player Fernando Gonzalez has paid a price for his love of animals, the state television reported. 

Gonzalez was driving his car on a busy Santiago Avenue on Saturday afternoon, when he saw a dog in the middle of the street that had been struck by another vehicle. 

Gonzalez stopped to pick up the dog and take it to a clinic, but the animal bit the small finger of his right hand. (PTI)

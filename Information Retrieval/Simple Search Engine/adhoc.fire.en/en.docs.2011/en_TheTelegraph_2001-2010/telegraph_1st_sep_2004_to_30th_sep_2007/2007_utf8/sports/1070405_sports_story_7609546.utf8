 Mushtaq first to depose 

Karachi: Mushtaq Ahmed, the assistant coach of the Pakistan team, was the first person to appear before the inquiry appointed by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to evaluate their early World Cup elimination. 

Pakistan were knocked out of the competition after losing to the West Indies and debutants Ireland. 

Coach Bob Woolmer died the day after the Irish defeat and Jamaican police are still investigating his death. 

Mushtaq was very candid about the reasons for the teams performance and gave some useful insight into what had happened, Ejaz Butt, the chairman of the inquiry committee said on Wednesday. 

Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq has been asked to appear before the committee on Thursday. 

Mushtaq said simply that he had told the committee there were many reasons for the defeat against Ireland and the captain should not be solely blamed for it. 

The committee, which will also question other players, team officials, journalists and board administrators, was recording its proceedings, Saleem Altaf said. 

We just want to be sure whatever is said before the committee is on record and helps us exactly in compiling our findings, he said.

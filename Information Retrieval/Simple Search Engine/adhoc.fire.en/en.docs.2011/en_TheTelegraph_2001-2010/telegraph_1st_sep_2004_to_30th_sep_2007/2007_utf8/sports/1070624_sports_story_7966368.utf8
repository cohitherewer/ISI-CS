Belfast: Rookie leg-spinner Piyush Chawla and left-arm seamer Rudra Pratap Singh produced tidy bowling spells as India restricted Ireland to a modest 193 in an ODI at the Stormont ground here on Saturday. 

Set a revised target of 171 in 39 overs, India were 149 for one after 31 overs. Sourav Ganguly (64) and Gautam Gambhir (68) put India firmly on track for a comfortable win. Sachin Tendulkar, however, lasted just three balls in making four runs. More than two-and-a-half hours were lost owing to rain. Souravs innings included six fours and a six while Gambhir hit nine boundaries. 

Chawla, who made his ODI debut last month against Bangladesh, picked up three for 29 and his Uttar Pradesh teammate RP Singh grabbed two for 36 to help the visitors gain the upperhand. 

Right arm pacer Sreesanth also picked three wickets but was expensive, conceding 50 runs. 

The Irish innings revolved around a defiant half-century by wicketkeeper-batsman Niall Brien who struck a confident 52. 

Brien, who hit four fours in his 77-ball knock, shared a vital 48-run stand for the seventh wicket with captain Trent Johnston to boost the scoreboard which was reading a sorry 111 for six at one stage. 

Johnston made a relatively quickfire 34 off 44 balls including two hits over the fence. 

Put in to bat, the hosts struggled to get going under overcast conditions. 

Sreesanth provided the opening breakthrough, having Kenny Carroll caught behind when the batsman snicked a high delivery in the fourth over. 

But the Indian bowlers failed to exploit the conditions as William Porterfield (16) and Dominick Joyce (18) added 33 runs for the second wicket. 

Ajit Agarkar then castled Porterfield and Sreesanth accounted for Joyce. 

Chawla then struck twice to reduced Ireland to 83 for five. 

The leg-spinner dismissed Kevin Brien (13) and Gary Wilson (3) in the space of nine balls. 

Chawla, who had picked three wickets also in the only ODI he has played before, then sent back allrounder Andrew White (8). 

But the Indians failed to deliver the killer punch and allowed things to drift with 29 extras, including 16 wides, marked the visitors casual approach. 

Niall, Irelands hero at the World Cup, capitalised the slackness to earn his fourth half-century. 

With Johnston providing some much-needed urgency, the tail wagged long enough for Ireland to post a total to defend. 

Earlier, Indian captain Rahul Dravid won the toss and elected to field. 

India were without wicketkeeper-batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni and paceman Zaheer Khan while Rohit Sharma made his international debut. 

Dhoni suffered an unspecified injury while Zaheer was yet to recover fully from the groin injury he suffered in the Afro-Asian Cup.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 When you get 

 in, make it count: Graham Gooch

 - FORMER ENGLAND CAPTAIN RECALLS HIS EPIC 333 AT LORDS 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL

 London: Another 

 Test has ended at Lords and nobody came even close 

 to scoring a triple. Former England captain Graham Gooch, 

 who turned 54 on Monday, remains the only one with a 300 

 on crickets most revered ground. In fact, he also 

 got a hundred in the second innings of the 1990 Test against 

 India and his awesome total of 456 in one match is yet to 

 be bettered. Gooch, who is on the commentary panel for the 

 ongoing series, spoke to The Telegraph before the final 

 days play got underway.

 The following are 

 excerpts

 On still being the sole 

 triple hundred-achiever at Lords

 (Laughs) Its nice to be 

 reminded about it... People talk a lot more when the Indians 

 come visiting... The ball did swing on the first morning 

 of that Test, but not as much as it did during this one.

 On batting at Lords

 Its a terrific feeling... 

 Conditions can often get very challenging, but a top batsman 

 would like to be challenged... Its a test of character... 

 The atmosphere, particularly on the first day, is outstanding... 

 The buzz is special and youd like to perform on the 

 opening day... The history and tradition sure gets to you... 

 Where Im concerned, theres no better ground 

 anywhere than Lords.

 On memories of that epic 

 333, the highest first-class score at Lords

 The other day somebody pointed 

 out that Im the first to have got a triple with a 

 helmet! Well... A Test triple isnt bad for somebody 

 who started with a pair (versus Australia at Edgbaston in 

 1975)...

 On his approach in that 

 innings

 Id never bat keeping landmarks 

 in mind... The one target would be to get past 

 20... Once beyond that, I would try and build a big innings... 

 Wouldnt give it away... My theory still is that the 

 first 50 runs are the hardest, the next 50 a little easier 

 and so on... I have two types of hundreds baby hundreds 

 and daddy hundreds... The first is when you give it away 

 soon after getting to a hundred, the second is when you 

 score at least 150... That, indeed, is a big one... A double 

 hundred could be a grand-daddy hundred, but I havent 

 thought anything for a triple! Bottomline is that when you 

 get in, make it count... Thats what I learnt from 

 the late Ken Barrington, who was the assistant manager when 

 I made my debut... He was my mentor as well... Earlier in 

 that summer of 1990, in the first Test against New Zealand, 

 Id got out for a duck (to Sir Richard Hadlee) on the 

 first ball... It was very embarrassing... So, make every 

 innings count.

 On having been dropped 

 by Kiran More (off Sanjeev Sharma) on 36

 One gets slices of luck, but Id 

 never look back on the last ball... Id look ahead 

 to the next one... The past is past... The next ball is 

 important, not the one gone by... I learnt that from one 

 of my favourite batters, Barry Richards... Hed re-mark 

 his line after every ball... He didnt take fresh guard, 

 but that act was as good as doing so.

 On whether hed become 

 conscious on approaching the triple

 Yes... Two years earlier, playing 

 for Essex versus Kent, Id got out to a bad shot on 

 275... Id then vowed I wouldnt come so close 

 to a triple and give it away... The opportunity came in 

 a Test at Lords.

 On the ones he remembered 

 first on getting to 300

 My parents, Rose and Alf... Theyre 

 the ones whod set me on the cricket-road... They were 

 like a taxi service, taking me all over the place. Also 

 my first coach, Bill Morris of the Ilford Cricket Club.

 On his hundred in the 

 second innings

 That took me to a world record 

 of the maximum runs in a Test... It stands and I take pride 

 in that achievement... I was, perhaps, destined to do well.

 Finally, on whether that 

 triple is the only stand-out memory from that Test

 No... No... We won the Test (by 

 247 runs)... I cant forget that... Then, there were 

 fine hundreds from Allan Lamb, Robin Smith, Ravi Shastri, 

 Mohammed Azharuddin... Azharuddins was the most entertaining 

 and, as the fielding captain, Id got frustrated... 

 Hed hit balls on the off through leg and the ones 

 pitched on the middle through off... When he scored, he 

 really looked good... He had such unconventional shots.

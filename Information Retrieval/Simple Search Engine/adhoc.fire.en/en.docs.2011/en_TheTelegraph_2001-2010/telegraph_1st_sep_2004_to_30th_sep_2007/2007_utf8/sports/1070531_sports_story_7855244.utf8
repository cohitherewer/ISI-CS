 Flintoff to undergo another operation

Andrew Flintoff will have a second operation on his

 injured left ankle, the ECB has said. 

Flintoff had hoped to prove his fitness for the third Test against the West Indies next week by appearing for Lancashire in the County Championship. 

But the England allrounder, who missed the opening two Tests, was ruled out of the match against Sussex due to continuing problems with the ankle. 

The 29-year-old sat out back-to-back Friends Provident Trophy matches over the weekend as a precaution, but had been practising in the nets and was hopeful of stepping up his return. 

However, after undergoing a fitness test, Flintoff was still experiencing soreness in his ankle and the decision was made not to risk him against champions Sussex. 

That was followed, after further assessment with the England medical staff, by the announcement that he would again go under the knife. 

Flintoff has twice had surgery on the same left ankle in the past three years and missed the second half of last season. 

England coach Peter Moores has said he is eager to see Flintoff back in the squad, but wants the allrounder fighting fit and not risk a further setback. 

He said: Everyone wants a fit Andrew Flintoff. The medical guys are working with him, but its been tough to decide what is the best way to get him fit. 

Ideally, we want everyone to be fit without constant recourse to painkilling injections and the medical team will look at the long-term considerations. They will not take any risks with his long-term health.

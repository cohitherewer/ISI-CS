 Roger ready for young brigade

 Sharapova 

New York: Roger Federer can see the next generation of young rivals quickly approaching but the worlds top player is not ready to hand over his Grand Slam supremacy just yet. 

The 26-year-old Swiss star, seeking his 12th Grand Slam title at the US Open which begins on Monday said he could feel a host of younger foes closing upon him. And that doesnt even count French Open nemesis Rafael Nadal. 

He has already been up there too long. Hes a veteran, Federer said of the second-ranked Spanish 21-year-old who won his third Roland Garros title in a row in June and pushed Federer to an epic five-set final at Wimbledon. 

Federers worries come from 20-year-old Serbian world No. 3 Novak Djokovic, British 20-year-old Andy Murray, 21-year-old Czech Tomas Berdych, 21-year-old Frenchman Richard Gasquet and 22-year-old Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis. 

The new generation players have announced themselves since a year basically, Federer said. One year ago they were still very young, not just young. But they are all very good. Its going to be interesting to see how well they can do at the Grand Slams. 

Djokovic defeated Federer, Nadal and Andy Roddick on way to the Montreal Masters crown earlier this month, while Gasquet made a Wimbledon semi-final run before falling to the world No. 1. 

You could definitely tell one of them was going to make the breakthrough soon. It was Djokovic who did it first, even though it looked as if Murray was going to do it ahead of him, Federer said. 

Djokovic is in the lower half of the draw, and has a tough first-round match against Mario Ancic of Croatia. The earliest Federer can meet Djokovic is in the title round. The Swiss, eyeing a fourth straight US Open crown, will open his campaign against American qualifier Scoville Jenkins. 

Federer could face rising American John Isner in the third round and if the seedings hold, he would play fifth seed and former champion Roddick in the quarters. 

Federer won his 50th career title earlier this month. Im in great shape. Ive had the best summer of my life. Hopefully I can repeat the win at the US Open again, Federer said. 

Nadal, who begins against unfancied Australian Alun Jones, hopes to keep that prize out of Federers hands and take his Slam titles beyond feats of clay. 

I played a very good tournament in Wimbledon. I improved myself this year. I am having the best season of my career, Nadal said. 

Im here practising hard. Ive had good preparation for this tournament. I think that can help. 

Maria Sharapova armed with a new look, a refurbished serve and a fortuitious draw will start her defence against Italian Roberta Vinci. Im sure Im going to be a bit nervous going into the court, Sharapova said. 

Nerves are part of an athlete. Its how you deal with nerves. I love it when theres something on the line. Thats when I play my best tennis. 

Sharapova will be sporting a new style at this years Open. Im serving probably the biggest that Ive served this year, the two-time Grand Slam winner said. 

Sharapova denied she had a favourable draw. 

I really cant get worried about how the draw panned out, she said. I cant worry about whos on my side and whos not. If Im scared of playing someone, I should just pack my bags and leave.

 Fairytale win for Iraq

Jakarta: Iraq completed one of sports great fairytales by beating Saudi Arabia 1-0 in the Asian Cup final on Sunday to provide a rare moment of celebration in their war-torn homeland. The Saudis had been bidding to become the first four-time winners of the tournament but Iraq, riding a wave of global sentiment, upset the hot favourites for a rare slice of sporting glory. 

Iraqi captain Younis Mahmoud scored the winner in the 71st minute when he climbed above the defence at the far post and headed a perfectly-weighted corner from Hawar Mulla Mohammed into the Saudi net. When the final whistle sounded, the Iraq players collapsed to the ground in a mixture of shock and an unbridled emotion, kissing the turf and embracing each other after their countrys finest sporting moment. 

Saudi Arabia were outplayed by an Iraqi team riding high on a wave of national support. The Iraqis created a string of chances, only to be denied by sloppy finishing and extraordinary saves from Saudi goalkeeper Yasser Al Mosailem. 

Saudi Arabia had been the best attacking team in the tournament, scoring 12 goals en route to the final, but could not find a way past the Iraqis, who had the best defence in the competition, conceding just two goals in six matches. 

Few had given Iraq any chance of winning the tournament after a haphazard preparation brought about by the war at home and facing opponents who were appearing in their sixth final in 23 years. (Reuters)

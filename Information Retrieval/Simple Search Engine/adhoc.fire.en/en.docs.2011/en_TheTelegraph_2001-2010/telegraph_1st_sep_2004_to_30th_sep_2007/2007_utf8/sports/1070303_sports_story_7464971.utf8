 More bad news for Pawar as Sonn gets extension

A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: With Percy Sonn getting a one-year extension as ICC president, Sharad Pawar cannot hope to become the world body chief until June 2009. 

Sonn got an extension (that he was likely to was reported by The Telegraph on Friday) after the Nominations Committee failed to recommend either the name of BCCI chief Pawar or that of the other candidate ECB chairman David Morgan as successor of the incumbent South African. 

As reported in these columns, both Indias Pawar and Englands Morgan each had the backing of three members within the Committee. That led to an impasse a bigger setback for Pawar with Sonn becoming the beneficiary. 

Sonn got the extension during the two-day Executive Board meeting in Cape Town, which concluded on Friday. 

According to an ICC press release, the standard term for presidency is two years and that would have seen Sonn completing his term next year. 

However, the all-powerful Board has the discretion to invite the incumbent to stay in office for a third year. By accepting the proposal, Sonn mirrored the actions of his three predecessors, Jagmohan Dalmiya, Malcolm Gray and Ehsan Mani, all of who served three years each as ICC president. 

The Board also adopted the recommendation of the ICC Chief Executives Committee (CEC), which at its January meeting suggested an amendment to the Playing Condition that relates to Law 21.3 (Umpires awarding a match). 

The recommendation, which will take immediate effect, means that it will henceforth be the responsibility of the Match Referee to take the final decision on the termination of a match. 

The CEC had been asked to look into the Match Referees role following discussions at last Novembers Board meeting in Mumbai, where the events of the Test match at The Oval in August 2006 were discussed. 

On that occasion, the two umpires awarded the match to England when Pakistan was deemed to have refused to play. 

The Board also approved a series of appointments to the Cricket Committee. 

The new structure sees the Cricket Committee no longer made up of nominations from each of the Full Members (Boards and players) and leading Associates. 

Instead, it will now include two past players; two nominees of Full Member team captains representing current players; one current Full Member coach; and one representative each from Member Boards, umpires, Match Referees, the Marylebone Cricket Club, statisticians, the media and Associate Members.

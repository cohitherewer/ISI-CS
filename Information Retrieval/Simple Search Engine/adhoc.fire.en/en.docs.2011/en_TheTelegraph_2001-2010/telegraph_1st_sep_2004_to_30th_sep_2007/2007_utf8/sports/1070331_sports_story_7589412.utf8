 McGrath eyes two wickets vs Bangla

St Johns: Two wickets against Bangladesh will take Australian ace Glenn McGrath past former Pakistan captain Wasim Akrams World Cup record of 55 wickets. 

McGraths consistent and match-winning performances have helped Australia reach the final of the past three World Cups, including back-to-back title triumphs in 1999 and 2003. 

Playing in his last international competition, the 37-year-old McGrath is yet again spearheading Australias quest for a first ever hattrick of titles. His 54 World Cup wickets are a testimony to the impact he has had in ripping through rival line-ups for Australia to romp home. 

Seeking to dominate the Super Eight contest against unfancied Bangladesh on Saturday, Australia hope that McGraths record will be another milestone on way to stretching their unbeaten Cup sequence to 23 matches (one game was tied). 

Claiming a couple of more wickets and going past Akram will be something special, says McGrath. 

Eleven years ago, McGrath went without success in the 1996 final in Lahore that Sri Lanka won by seven wickets. Since then, he has made batsmen pay dearly for his missed opportunity. McGrath snared three wickets against the West Indies on Wednesday to take his tally to 364 dismissals in 243 ODIs. 

McGraths 54 World Cup dismissals have come in 32 matches, while Akram got his 55 came from 38 games. Looking back, I count myself lucky to have represented Australia for 14 years, said McGrath, who made his Test debut against New Zealand in 1993. 

McGrath and current captain Ricky Ponting are the two players in the current squad who have featured in the three previous World Cup finals. 

Though Ponting still isnt convinced smaller nations should be competing at the World Cup, he thinks Bangladesh has improved so much, they are no longer one of the games also-rans. 

You have to pay them the attention that they deserve, Ponting said. They use the minnow tag very well and in their favour, being a bit better than that. They have improved a lot. 

Theyve got some young players who are very capable on their day as weve seen, Ponting said. We have prepared for them in this game as we would a South Africa, West Indies or New Zealand game. 

Emerging from five successive ODI defeats in the run-up to the World Cup, Australia have bounced back with impressive victories in all four outings at the premier limited overs tournament. Its a funny game, Ponting said. All of a sudden, we appear pretty frightening again, just two weeks ago everyone felt we werent. 

Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar now wants his side to prove that the Super Eight qualification was no fluke. Its an exciting time for Bangladesh, we want to continue our good performance, said Bashar.

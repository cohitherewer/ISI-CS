 Kapur shoots miserable 77

Vienna: Shiv Kapur failed to land a single birdie and had six bogeys in his six-over 77 that left him in deep danger of missing the cut at the Austrian Open Golf tournament. 

Kapur was tied 148th and will need a big effort to stay on for the weekend at the Fontana Course. The Indian found the fairways alright but then his iron play let him down and managed only nine greens in regulation. Then he needed 31 putts for the round. 

Graeme Storm led the first round. He shot an eight-under 63 to equal the course record. 

Storms flawless card had an eagle and six birdies and he led Martin Erlandsson by a stroke. Englishmen Tom Whitehouse and Shaun Webster and Swede Patrick Sjoland were two behind. (PTI)

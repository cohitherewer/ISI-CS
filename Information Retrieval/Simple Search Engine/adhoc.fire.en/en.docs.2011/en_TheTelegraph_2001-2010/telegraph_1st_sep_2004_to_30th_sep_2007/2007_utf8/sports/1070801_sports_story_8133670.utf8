 Mosley sends spy dispute to court

 Max Mosley 

Paris: Formula Ones governing body reopened a spy controversy involving McLaren and Ferrari on Tuesday by referring to a court of appeal the earlier decision not to punish McLaren. 

Max Mosley, the FIA president, said in a letter to the head of the Italian motorsport body, CSAI, that he was sending the matter to appeal to allow Ferrari to present their case and to ensure public confidence in the result. Previously, FIA had said no appeal would be permitted. 

Mosley decided to allow the appeal after receiving a letter from Luigi Macaluso, head of the CSAI, which represents Ferrari. 

Meanwhile, Stepney said in an interview published in Tuesday that he was the victim of a set-up. 

Someone gave away the designs but it wasnt me. Someone set me up and that person is still within Ferrari, he said in an interview an Italian daily. 

Stepney is also facing criminal charges filed by Ferrari against him in a Modena court for attempted sabotage before the Monaco Grand Prix. 

Meanwhile, Scott Speed, the only American driver in Formula One, was dropped by the Toro Rosso team on Tuesday and replaced by Germanys Sebastian Vettel.

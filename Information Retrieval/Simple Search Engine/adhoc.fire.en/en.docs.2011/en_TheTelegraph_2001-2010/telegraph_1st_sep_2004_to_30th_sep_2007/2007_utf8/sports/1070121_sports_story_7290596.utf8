 Dravid: Sachin needed in middle-order

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Nagpur: Will he open or bat down the order? 

That seemed to be the biggest dilemma at the VCA Stadium on Saturday morning until Greg Chappell, Rahul Dravid and Dilip Vengsarkar convinced Sachin Tendulkar at an impromptu conference near the pitch to bat in the middle-order in the first ODI versus the West Indies. In the end, the selection committee chairman was seen patting Sachin on the back. 

Its no secret that Sachin prefers to open in ODIs, but as the Indian captain later said, the decision was taken looking ahead to the World Cup. However, it is learnt that if the move fails to click, he will again be back at the top. 

Were not sure how Yuvraj is going to shape up... Hence the move to have Sachin in the middle-order, Dravid explained. The middle overs are going to be very crucial in the West Indies So who better than the teams best batsman to play there. He has the creativity to adjust according to the situation. Weve played in the Caribbean recently and know what to expect. Make no mistake, the middle overs are going to be the toughest in the World Cup. 

Ive spoken to Sachin. Hes ready to give off his best in the teams interest. He has understood the reasons and importance of the move, the Team India captain explained. 

How is Yuvraj shaping up? Only after a few games can we get a fair idea. But we have to keep looking at other options, Dravid said. What about Virender Sehwag? I dont want to discuss individuals and selection matters, but Viru is obviously an asset to the side. 

Viru has played a lot of cricket. Staying out for a while may do him good. When hes in the team, questions are raised about his selection when hes out, the same questions continue to be raised. Its good hes finally getting some support! Dravid quipped.

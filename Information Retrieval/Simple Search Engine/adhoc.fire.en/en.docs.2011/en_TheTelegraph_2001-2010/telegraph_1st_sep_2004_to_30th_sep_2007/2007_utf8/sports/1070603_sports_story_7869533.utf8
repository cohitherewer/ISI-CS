 CAB panel to appoint coach 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The CAB is likely to form a four or five-member panel, comprising former cricketers, to interview the aspiring candidates for the job of Bengal coach. The announcement about Paras Mhambreys successor may come around June 15. 

Specifying that the CAB is in no hurry, president Prasun Mukherjee said: We will wait for a few days before taking a decision. 

The CAB chief, however, refused to single out any name from the seven-eight CVs they have received and only added that few are from other states. 

Mukherjee will head the panel to select coach while the other members will be decided shortly. It may be noted that the names of Devang Gandhi, Dattatreya Mukherjee, Pranab Roy and Saradindu Mukherjee are doing the rounds. 

Mhambrey quit Bengals job after guiding them to back-to-back Ranji Trophy finals. He is now in charge of Baroda.

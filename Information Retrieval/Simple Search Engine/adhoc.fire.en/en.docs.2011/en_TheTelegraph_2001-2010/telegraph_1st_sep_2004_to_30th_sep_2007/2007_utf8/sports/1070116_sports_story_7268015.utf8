 Ranking boost for Sania 

Melbourne: Sania Mirza couldnt have hoped for a bigger boost before launching her Australian Open campaign. A day before she takes on Ukrainian Olga Savchuk, the Indian registered a significant jump in rankings. 

According to the latest WTA list issued Monday, Sania is world No. 53. Her impressive showing at the Hobart meet helped her move up from No. 66. 

Sania, who plays the first match on Showcourt 3 at 5.30 am (IST), had burst into the limelight reaching the third round of the 2005 Australian Open, but made a quick exit last year. 

In doubles, Sania and Spaniard Anabel Medina Garrigues are seeded No. 10 and will take on Sandra Kloesel (Germany) and Aravane Rezai (France). (Agencies)

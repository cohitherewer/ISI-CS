 Sania goes down

London: Maria Sharapova and Jelena Jankovic made smooth starts to their grasscourt season on Wednesday, cruising into the third round of the Birmingham Classic. 

Indias Sania Mirza, however, went down to eighth seed Mara Santangelo of Italy 3-6, 6-3, 6-7 (6). 

Top seed and world No. 2 Sharapova returned to her favourite surface with a 6-4, 6-0 victory over Lilia Osterloh of the US in the second round, after a first-round bye. 

Second seed Jankovic, like Sharapova a beaten semi-finalist at Roland Garros last week, disposed of Bulgarian Tsvetana Pironkova 6-4, 6-1 at the Wimbledon warm-up tournament. 

Sharapova beat Jankovic in the final at Birmingham two years ago. The Russian also won the title in 2004 just before sealing her first grand slam tournament win at Wimbledon. 

Serb Jankovic has become one of the most talked about players this year after a consistent run of results, including three singles titles, that has propelled her up to third in the world rankings.

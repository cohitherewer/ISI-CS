The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bhaichung doubtful

OUR SPECIAL CORESPONDENT 

 Barreto is down with suspected food poisoning 

Ludhiana: Mohun Bagan camp received another blow late on Saturday. 

If Bhaichung Bhutia, suffering from viral fever, missed Fridays training session, late Saturday evening there was further bad news that their ace Brazilian striker Jose Ramirez Barreto was down with suspected food poisoning. 

Barreto remained confined to the bed and complained of weakness, even as the team officials appeared hopeful that he will take the field in their last eight encounter against Viva Kerala. 

Bhaichung remains a doubtful starter but coach Roberto Carlos Pereira thinks otherwise. 

Bhutia is a strong man, he told reporters, before continuing: Its not all that bad even though he has been in bed since last night. But, there are more than 24 hours for the match and he should recover by then. Should Bhutia not be fit for Sundays battle, Carlos will summon P.C. Lalawmpuia. 

Barreto agrees Mohun Bagan were not at their free-flowing best against ONGC in the opener, but the Calcutta Football League leaders cannot have an off-day always. 

Our midfield has to be a lot more enterprising, feels Barreto. In the Calcutta League we played a passing game but that was not the case against ONGC. 

Carlos too agrees his midfield has to be a lot more creative apart from the full-backs lending solidity to the attack. He believes the enterprise in midfield can be provided by James Singh, set to replace Lalkamal Bhowmick. 

Viva Kerala may have upset Air India, but Mohun Bagan seem out of reach. Without any foreign player to bank on or a star to carry the team on his shoulders, coach A.M. Sreedharan knows his best chance is to frustrate Mohun Bagan by packing the defence and then hope to catch them on the counter, if not the tie-breaker.

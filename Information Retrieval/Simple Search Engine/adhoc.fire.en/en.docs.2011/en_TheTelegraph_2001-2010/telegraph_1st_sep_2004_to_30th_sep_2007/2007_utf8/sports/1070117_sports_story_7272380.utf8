 Lloyd named WI manager 

 - ODI SERIES vs INDIA 

Port of Spain: The West Indian legend Clive Lloyd has been appointed manager of the Brian Lara-led squad during its tour of India for the four-match one-day International series starting Sunday. 

Former captain Lloyd, who is also chairman of the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB)s cricket committee, had travelled with the squad as an adviser for the Champions Trophy in India. 

A former coach and manager of the West Indies from 1997-99, Lloyd will take over from Tony Howard, who has been appointed WICBs chief cricket operations officer. Howard has been manager since April 2004. 

The 61-year-old Lloyd led the West Indies as captain from 1974 to 1985, when the team dominated world cricket. 

Besides, Barbados coach Hendy Springer will join the West Indies as a temporary assistant coach to Bennett King, WICB cricket operations officer Derrick Nicholas said. 

Kings regular deputy, David Moore, was not available for the one-day series against India, starting in Nagpur. 

The West Indies squad leaves for the tour from Antigua on Wednesday. 

Meanwhile, Dwayne Smith said Tuesday he will replace Darren Sammy on the West Indies squad for the series. Smith was going to be rested during the trip, but he was called up after Sammy pulled out with a hamstring injury on Monday. 

Sammy has been bothered by the injury since the West Indies A team series against Sri Lanka A in December. 

Both players are preparing for the World Cup as members of the West Indies 30-man provisional squad.

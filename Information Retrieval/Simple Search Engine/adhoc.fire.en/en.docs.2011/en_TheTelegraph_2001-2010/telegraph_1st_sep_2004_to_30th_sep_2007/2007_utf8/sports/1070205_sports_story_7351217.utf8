 AIFF plans to curtail international ties

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) is planning to restrict the national teams participation in international tournaments over the next few years. This in reaction to Indias frequent fall in the Fifa rankings and the subsequent negative publicity that it brings with it. 

In the latest Fifa rankings, released last month, India is at 157th spot in the 207-nation world body. It is Indias worst ever showing since the ranking system was introduced in the 90s. 

Speaking on the sidelines of the draw for the second division National Football League, the AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco said that the senior national team has been playing too many tournaments that is causing Indias further downfall in the world rankings. 

This has nothing to do with the Chinese theory when they stayed away from all international competitions in the 60s to prepare themselves, said Colaco. The problem here is that we have been playing in each and every tournament that comes up from SAF Games to the pre-World Cup and it is actually not taking us anywhere. 

The AIFF general secretary said that heavy defeats to Japan and Saudi Arabia in the Asian Cup qualifiers further worsened Indias position in the rankings. The first aim should be to come among the first 16 Asian countries, he added. 

In order to do that, the AIFF may choose tournaments where the teams are not far superior to India. At the same time it may temporarily stop playing in big tournaments like Asian Games or pre-Olympics. 

To compensate, Colaco said, India could play more friendlies. Fifa now has limited the seasonal dates for friendly matches and we have been receiving regular invitations from different countries to play against them. 

The problem, however, the AIFF boss said, is the heavy amount that has to be spent in playing friendlies. While a team like Japan will make millions, India may have to spend around Rs 40 lakh for playing each match. 

Meanwhile, Calcuttas Chirag United have been placed in the Goa Cluster of the 2nd division NFL. Kerala will host the other cluster and the final round as well. 

The tournament is likely to be held from the last week of February. 

Groupings 

Goa Cluster: Vasco, Punjab Police, State Bank of Travancore, ONGC, South Eastern Central Railway and Chirag United. 

Kerala Cluster: Indian Bank, Army XI, Salgaocar, J and K Bank, Lajong Sports Club and Viva Kerala.

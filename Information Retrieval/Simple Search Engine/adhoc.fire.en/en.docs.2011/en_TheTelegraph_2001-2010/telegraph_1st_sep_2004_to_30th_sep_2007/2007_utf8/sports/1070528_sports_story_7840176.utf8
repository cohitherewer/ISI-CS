Dhaka: It was madness, not cricket, that Bangladesh displayed against India on Sunday, as they lost the final Test inside three days to concede the series 0-1. 

Weighed down by Indias mammoth 610 for three declared, Habibul Bashars men managed just 118 in the first innings less than any of the scores put on by Indias four centurions and 253 following on to suffer an innings and 239-run defeat. This, incidentally, is Indias highest margin of victory. 

Zaheer Khan, who made his debut against the same country seven years ago, returned overall figures of seven for 88 and clinched the Man of the Match award, while Sachin Tendulkar, who scored his 37th century, was adjudged Man of the Series. 

And Dav Whatmores farewell match this was his last as Bangladesh coach ended on a sorry note. 

The hosts never looked like wanting to undergo the rigours of a five-day battle and batted as if they were playing a one-dayer. They were too flashy and fragile for Rahul Dravid amp; Co., and dug their own graves. 

Whatever be Dravids take on the revenge tour angle, nothing could possibly be sweeter than this victory over the side that had helped cut short Indias World Cup dreams. 

Zaheer, who had rocked the Bangladesh top-order on Saturday, continued the demolition job on Sunday. He was in the thick of action from the second ball of the day, trapping Shakib-al Hasan with one which zipped in from outside off-stump. He cleaned up Mohammed Rafique to finish with five for 34, his fourth five-wicket haul, and first since 2003. 

Veteran Anil Kumble also got into the act with three for 32, and then aided debutant Ishant Sharma in scalping his maiden Test wicket. Mashrafe Mortaza sliced one off the back foot straight to Kumble at gully to help the Delhi quick open his account. 

The hosts first innings ended in just 37.2 overs. Lesson not learnt, the flashy batting spilled over to the second essay. 

In an action replay, Zaheer once again had Javed Omar out for a duck off the first delivery! The Bangladesh opener was perhaps unlucky this time, as he appeared not to have touched the ball while chasing it down the leg. 

Zaheer made it 10 for two when captain Bashar departed. Rudra Pratap Singh joined the party and dismissed Shahriar Nafees. The Indians were beginning to sniff victory on the day. 

Vice-captain Mohammed Ashraful, however, had other ideas and tried to unsettle the rival attack with a cracker of a cameo. He hit Zaheer for three boundaries in his third over. He then picked out Rudra Pratap for similar treatment, hitting him for 14 runs, including one six over square leg. 

Zaheer began a new over and was disdainfully spanked for a huge six. Ashraful continued with the blitz, turning his attention to Sharma. He hit the bowler for back-to-back fours and raced to his half-century in just 26 balls, missing Jacques Kallis record by two balls. 

Kumble finally ended Ashrafuls assault, Sachin taking a low diving catch at mid-wicket. Ashrafuls 67 came off 41 balls with 12 fours and two sixes. 

After his departure, wickets kept falling. 

A late entertaining burst from Mortaza (70 off 68 balls, 4x8, 6x3) merely delayed the inevitable and it was not enough to prevent India from setting another record and coming away with a lot of positives ahead of the England tour.

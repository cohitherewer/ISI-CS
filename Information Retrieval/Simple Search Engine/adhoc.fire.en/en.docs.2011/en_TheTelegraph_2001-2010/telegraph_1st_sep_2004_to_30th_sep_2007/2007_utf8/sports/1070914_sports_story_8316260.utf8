 Ian: We were complacent

 Ian Chappell 

Sydney: Former Australian captain Ian Chappell said Ricky Pontings side was complacent and lacked respect for their opposition Thursday after a shock loss to minnows Zimbabwe in the ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa. 

The ODI world champions Australia limped to 138 for nine in the opening match, only for Zimbabwe to overhaul the total with one ball to spare in a thrilling contest. 

Chappell, a gritty Australian captain in the 1970s who never lost a Test series as skipper, said Pontings side could not use a long lay-off from the game as an excuse. 

I think its more likely the Australians were complacent than rusty, Chappell told a website. 

Chappell said the Australians had played plenty of practice matches in the build-up and Ponting would be disappointed his players did not treat their unfancied opponents with more respect. 

I think there could have been a feeling of all weve got to do is turn up and well beat Zimbabwe, he said. 

I think thats what Ponting was alluding to when he said after the game that his players need to respect the (Twenty20) game a little. 

Chappell said Ponting probably delivered a tongue lashing to his team after the loss. He also warned Australias next opponents, England, to expect a backlash. 

England will need to watch out when Australia play them because theyll be wounded. On a minor scale, it will be a little bit like when Australia lost the Ashes to them in 2005, he said. 

Australia bounced back from that loss to thrash England 5-0 in the next Ashes Test series. (AFP)

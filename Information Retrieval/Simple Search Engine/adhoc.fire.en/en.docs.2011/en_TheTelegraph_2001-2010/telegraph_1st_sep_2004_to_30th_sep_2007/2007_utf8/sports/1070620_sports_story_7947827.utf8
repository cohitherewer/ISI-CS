 Lalas: Becks bigger than Tiger, Jordan

London: David Beckhams new employers Los Angeles Galaxy have claimed the former England captain would command a bigger appeal in the US than Americas own ace golfer Tiger Woods or basketball legend Michael Jordan. 

LA Galaxy boss Alexi Lalas said Beckhams star status would be such that the Americans would not have dealt with anything like it before. 

There will be interest in Beckham over here that exceeds everything else. The US will never have dealt with an athlete who has had this kind of international impact, Lalas said. 

Woods has that international appeal but with due respect to Woods and Michael Jordan, Beckham is at an entirely different level, he told a British daily. 

Beckham, who ended his four-year career at Real Madrid with his first LA Liga title on Sunday, now makes his way across the Atlantic to start his stint with the American club. 

The president of LA Galaxy also branded the English Premiership an over-hyped, inferior product, reacting to suggestions that Beckham was heading into semi-retirement in Major League Soccer (MLS). 

Lalas, the guitar-playing former US defender and captain, slammed much of the commentary surrounding Beckhams move to California as ignorant and delusional. 

We may be Americans but we are not stupid, Lalas said We know when were being patronised and I get so irritated when I hear the experts in England talk about Beckham as if hes going into semi-retirement by leaving Real Madrid for Los Angeles.

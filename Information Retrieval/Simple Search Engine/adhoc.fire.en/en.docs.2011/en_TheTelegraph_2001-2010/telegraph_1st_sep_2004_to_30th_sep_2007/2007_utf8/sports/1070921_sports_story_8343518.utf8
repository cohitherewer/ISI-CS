 Floyd Landis found guilty of doping 

Paris: Floyd Landis, who tested positive for the banned male hormone testosterone during his 2006 Tour de France triumph, has been found guilty of doping by a US arbitration panel. 

He has been found guilty. It proves that the system works no matter who you are, Pat McQuaid, president of the International Cycling Union (UCI), said on Thursday. 

Landis said in a statement: This ruling is a blow to athletes and cyclists everywhere. 

For the Panel to find in favour of USADA (United States Anti-Doping Agency) when, with respect to so many issues, USADA did not manage to prove even the most basic parts of their case shows that this system is fundamentally flawed. I am innocent, and we proved I am innocent, the 31-year-old added. 

McQuaid said that Spaniard Oscar Pereiro, who finished second to Landis in 2006, would be the winner of the race. (Reuters)

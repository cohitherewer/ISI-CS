 Sussex reach 146/5 

 - Laxman falls for 95; ranadeb opens account 

 V.V.S Laxman in action on Day 2 of Indias match versus Sussex in Hove 

Hove: Indian bowlers struck telling blows to the English county champions Sussex as the latter were reduced to 146 for five in their first innings on Day Two of the warm-up match here Sunday. 

After V.V.S. Laxman top scored with a sparkling 95 to help India notch up an impressive 388 for seven declared, the bowlers produced a clinical display to drive a wedge through the Sussex top-order. 

At close, wicketkeeper-batsman Andy Hodd was batting on 21 with Robert Martin-Jenkins yet to open his account and Sussex still needing 93 more to avoid the follow-on. 

Sreesanth drew first blood when he had Richard Montgomerie (18) caught at second slip by Dinesh Karthik before Bengal medium pacer Ranadeb Bose joined the act, sending back Chris Nash in a similar dismissal. 

Rudra Pratap Singh then fired in a yorker to trap Hopkinson in front of the wicket. 

Sussex skipper Michael Yardy battled adversity with a compact half-century before Anil Kumble marked his bowling run up. 

Once he did that, the leg spinner duly accounted for Yardy as well as Michael Thornley. 

Earlier, Laxman fell five short of his century. 

Probably in his last tour of the Old Blighty, Laxman seemed set for a classy hundred until he was deceived by the wily former Pakistan off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq and was dismissed for 95. 

Saqlain foxed the stylish Hyderabadi bastman with a doosra that took the shoulder of the latters bat to first slip, ending an entertaining 178-ball knock that contained 12 hits to the fence. 

India declared their innings an hour after lunch after losing Laxman, Yuvraj Singh, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Kumble in quick succession, four wickets falling for 31 runs in 11.5 overs. 

Saqlain ended up with three for 71 in 29.5 overs while Ollie Rayner claimed two for 34. Indian skipper Rahul Dravid, who was 57 not out overnight, did not come out to bat this morning. 

Resuming at 281 for three, the Indians continued to feast on Sussex bowling on a wicket that had nothing much to offer. 

With Yuvraj too looking determined to make the most of another bright, sunny day, India continued to add useful runs to their kitty. 

Laxman, who started the day on 37 not out, duly reached his half-century and shared another fruitful stand with Yuvraj who was given a testing time by Saqlain. 

However, Yuvraj was rewarded for all his pluck as he soon opened up to steer Martin-Jenkins to the fence and follow it up with another glorious off-drive off Saqlain.

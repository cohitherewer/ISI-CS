 Atwal tied 52nd 

Palm Beach Gardens (US): Arjun Atwal carded a two-over par 72 on the opening day to lie tied 52nd, while Daniel Chopra was even par 70 for tied 21st at the Honda Classic Golf Tournament. 

Chopra, starting on tenth, bogeyed the 12th and then the 17th to be two-over after eight holes. But a birdie on 18th and again on third saw him come to even. A bogey on fifth and a birdie on ninth saw him close at even par-70. 

Atwal had a sedate start with four pars but he then dropped two shots on par-3 fifth. He parred the next nine before birdying the par-3 15th, but on the very next hole he dropped a shot again to finish at 72. 

Koreas Charlie Wi took the first round lead after opening with a five-under-par 65 on Thursday. 

The Asian Tour star birdied his final two holes at the PGA National to lead by one shot from Germanys Bernhard Langer.

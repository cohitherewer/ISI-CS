 Denesh Ramdin reprimanded 

 London: West Indies wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin has been reprimanded for showing dissent during his teams Twenty20 International loss against England on Friday. 

Umpire Nigel Llong reported Ramdin for making a comment at the end of an over after the wicketkeeper had claimed a catch that was not given. Ramdin had celebrated catching England captain Paul Collingwood without even appealing to the umpire. 

Owais Shah (55 ..) had guided England to a five-wicket win on Friday. Shah and Dmitri Mascarenhas added 69 in 36 balls to take England to victory with three balls to spare. Earlier, West Indies totalled 169 for seven. 

 At a hearing after the game, which England won by 

 five wickets with three balls to spare, Ramdin was censured 

 by Match Referee Mike Procter. The player was clearly 

 disappointed that an appeal had been turned down by umpire 

 Llong, Proctor said on Saturday. But, at the 

 end of the over, he allowed that disappointment to become 

 dissent and that is completely unacceptable.

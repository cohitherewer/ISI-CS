Calcutta: Glenn McGrath bowed out of the game in great style as Player of the Tournament at the 2007 World Cup. 

According to an ICC release, the Aussie fast bowler secured 15 points during the tournament, including three Man of the Match awards. 

McGraths closest rival was Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene, who tallied 11 points. Aussie opener Matthew Hayden and New Zealands Scot Styris finished on nine points each. 

The points were allocated by members of the television commentary team at each venue. Each Man of the Match got three points, the second two and the third one. 

McGrath claimed 26 wickets, making him the most successful bowler in a single edition of the World Cup. Overall, he took 71 wickets in 39 Cup matches also a record. 

McGrath also finished his career in fifth place in the all-time ICC rankings for ODI bowlers. McGrath is one of only five to have ever reached 900 rating points.

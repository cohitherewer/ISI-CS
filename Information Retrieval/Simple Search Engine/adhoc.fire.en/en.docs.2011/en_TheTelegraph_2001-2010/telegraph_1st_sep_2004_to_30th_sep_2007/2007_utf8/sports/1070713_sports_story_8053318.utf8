 Sourav lauds Vaughan

 Sourav Ganguly 

London: According to Sourav Ganguly, Michael Vaughan is a terrific captain, but he leads the side differently in absence of talismanic allrounder Andrew Flintoff. 

Ive seen Vaughan leading the team differently without Flintoff, he said. 

The former captain, who led Team India to their famous NatWest series win five years ago, praised Vaughan. 

His (Vaughans) record is fabulous. I think hes reaping the benefits of what Nasser (Hussain) did. 

He also had words of praise for Kevin Pietersen and Monty Panesar. 

Pietersen is brilliant. Hell turn out to be one of the greats I think. Monty, hes from my county Northants, will walk into any side in the world, Sourav said. 

But Indias most successful captain believes England are vulnerable in the upcoming Test series against India in absence of their star allrounder. 

England are a good side. But were lucky that Flintoff is unfit. I think he makes a huge difference to the team. They are a beatable side Flintoff will really be missed, Sourav was quoted as saying by a local newspaper on Thursday. 

Flintoff is recuperating after an ankle surgery and is doubtful to take part in the three-Test series between India and England, beginning at Lords from July 19.

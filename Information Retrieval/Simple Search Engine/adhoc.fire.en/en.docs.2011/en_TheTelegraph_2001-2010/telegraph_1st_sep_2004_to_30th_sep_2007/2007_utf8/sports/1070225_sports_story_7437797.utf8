London: A last-gasp goal by Cristiano Ronaldo earned Manchester United a 2-1 smash-and-grab victory at Fulham in Saturdays early kick-off in the Premier League. 

Leaders United took their points tally to 69 from 28 games, nine ahead of second-placed Chelsea. 

Liverpool, third on 53 points, destroyed Sheffield United 4-0 while Charlton Athletic swept past relegation rivals West Ham United 4-0 and Middlesbrough beat Reading 2-1. 

Former England striker Robbie Fowler converted two penalties before second-half goals from Sami Hyypia and Steven Gerrard completed Liverpools rout of Sheffield United. Rafa Benitezs team also broke a top-flight club record of eight successive clean sheets at Anfield. 

Fulham took a deserved lead when Brian McBride pounced to score his ninth league goal of the season after a mix-up between central defender Nemanja Vidic and goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. 

The visitors equalised 12 minutes later when Ryan Giggs volleyed his third goal in four matches following a far-post cross from Wayne Rooney. 

But it was Fulham who looked by far the more threatening side until Ronaldos 88th-minute goal.

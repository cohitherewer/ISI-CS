 Sania sickness afflicts Anna

New York: Anna Chakvetadze is sick of playing Sania Mirza, but the Indian ace asserts that she will not be perturbed while meeting the sixth-seeded Russian and her recent nemesis in the third round of the US Open. 

Sania is not ruffled by the fact that, in the run-up to the US Open, Chakvetadze defeated her in the Stanford finals, in the semi-finals in Cincinnati and, before that, in Hobart in January. 

I met her in the hallway. She said, Im sick of playing you, said Sania after her 6-3, 7-5 second-round victory over US veteran Laura Granville on Thursday. Every time I come to a semi-final, she is there, Sania added. 

There is no pressure on me. I just have to go out there and give my best and see what happens, Sania said. 

When Sania became the first woman from India to advance as far as the fourth round of a Grand Slam tournament at the 2005 US Open she felt the glory and the sting of her instant success. 

A fatwa was reportedly issued by Muslim clerics, who said her tennis outfits were too revealing, threatening to stop her from playing tennis. 

It was difficult at the beginning, but I think people have accepted it, Sania said. 

Ive accepted the fame, with the good and the bad that comes with it. I think a few things went overboard for absolutely no reason. By the end of it, we figured it was never a fatwa, just the press trying to blow up stuff. 

Thats behind me. At this point, I am winning tennis matches, thats what matters now. 

About her error-filled performance against Granville, Sania said she preferred to play attacking tennis, which was her strength. 

If I am going to play such attacking tennis, theres very little chance I will have fewer unforced errors. You have to be a Roger Federer to do that, she said. 

I was in control most of the time. She was able to raise the level and I wasnt able to do the same immediately, she added. 

The Indian who fired six aces and 33 winners, made 33 unforced errors as well and lost two match points before taming Granville. 

Sania said the experience of playing at the highest level had taught her to be mentally tougher. 

Once you miss a match point or two, you start thinking every time you have one. Thats when the mental strength comes in. Its about the things you deal with growing up. Its times like this that helps you be mentally tough. 

I have to have the mental ability and strength to put it behind me. 

Sania acknowledged that she has been getting enough support from Indians all over the world. 

 There are enough Indians everywhere. We have so many Indians in New York. I get great support, she said.

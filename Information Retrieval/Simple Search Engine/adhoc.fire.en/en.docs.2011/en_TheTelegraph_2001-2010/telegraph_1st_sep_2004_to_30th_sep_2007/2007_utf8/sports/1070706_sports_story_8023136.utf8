The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 2-phase local league unlikely 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The AIFF may not allow the IFA to hold the CFL Premier Division in two phases this season. 

The IFA recently decided to slot the Premier Division in two phases (July 25-August 31 and November 27-December 27) to avoid a clash with the Federation Cup and Professional League. 

The Professional League will not be played in December because of the SAFF Cup, but the AIFF sources said there may not be any room for the state body to hold the final phase of the local meet during that time. While the AIFF has already taken a decision not to allow any local league to be played in December, it has also slotted Durand Cup that month. 

Yes, the AIFF executive committee has decided no state league should be played in between the Professional League, said an AIFF official. The same rule was applied to Goa when they proposed to play their state league in December, he added. 

The current IFA secretary, Utpal Ganguly, said he was not aware of these complications. We have decided on the league dates only after consulting the participating teams. I will talk to AIFF and find out what exactly the situation is, Ganguly said. 

The AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco pleaded ignorance regarding the IFAs decision to play the Premier Division in December. Given the Durand Cups status and tradition, Calcuttas big three are likely to take part in that tournament, which will add to the IFAs problems.

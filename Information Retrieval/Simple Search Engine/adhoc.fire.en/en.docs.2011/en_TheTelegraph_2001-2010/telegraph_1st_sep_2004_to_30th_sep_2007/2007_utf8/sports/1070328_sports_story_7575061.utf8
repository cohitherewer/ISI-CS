 Bobs last meal to be tested

Kingston: Jamaican police is investigating if Bob Woolmers last room-service dinner was laced with drugs to subdue him. 

Deputy Commissioner of Police Mark Shields said a man of Woolmers stature could not have been manually strangulated unless he was impaired. 

He was 6ft 1 inches (185cm), and a big man, and unless he was drugged or impaired it would perhaps have been difficult to restrain him. We are looking at whether his food was drugged, he said. 

The meal was thrown away after he put the tray outside his room, but we are conducting toxicology and tissue tests, Shields was quoted as saying. 

Police are treating the CCTV cameras as critical piece of evidence, and said the investigation process was taking a little longer. 

Meanwhile, physio Darren Lipson has left for Cape Town with personal belongings of Woolmer. His laptop and cell phone, however, have been kept by the police. Assistant manager Asad Mustafa has also gone back home.

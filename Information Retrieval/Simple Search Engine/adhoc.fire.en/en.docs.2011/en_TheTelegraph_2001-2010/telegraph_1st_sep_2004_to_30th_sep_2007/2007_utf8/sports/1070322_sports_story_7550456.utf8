The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Munaf can make it big one day, says Croft

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

 Munaf has pace and bowls straight, says Croft

Port of Spain: Colin Croft is a familiar face at the Queens Park Oval. Once part of the fearsome West Indies quartet, his mere presence would invoke fear in the minds of the batsmen. 

Times have changed though. 

The deepening lines on his face and the greying hair bear no resemblance to the hungry and combative look that once ruled the circuit. Easily accessible, he is cool, yet firm on his views. 

Ask him for an interview and he will say he doesnt give one. Get him into discussing cricket and you will turn into a keen listener as he leaves you spellbound. 

A professional pilot, he takes time off for commentary during matches and also writes a weekly column for a newspaper here and in Guyana. What a week this has been for Pakistan cricket, he begins, referring to Bob Woolmers death. 

Talk invariably turns to the pressures cricketers and coaches have to go through these days. Why do they have to enjoy so much of media attention day in and day out? Let them concentrate on their game! Look what has happened to your Irfan Pathan. 

Last year when he toured the West Indies he was your best bowler! Now he doesnt even make the XI? Picking wickets doesnt make you the best. Youve got to judge your own capabilities and keep a cool head. 

I was amazed to see Indian team surrounded by cameramen during their practice session Why dont you guys let them practice peacefully? Leave them alone They are not gods Treat them as normal human beings who have got some special skills, he said from the Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation box. 

It pains Croft that a Sachin Tendulkar or a Sourav Ganguly cannot lead a normal life in their hometown. They cannot go out with their families and kids thats very harsh. Let them lead a normal life. But thats the price for being a champion. Croft doesnt agree. 

Who then is Indias best on view today? Munaf Patel, he says without a wink. That guy can make it big one day maan. He has to remain focused. 

He has pace and bowls straight keeps the seam upright. But he is lazy. He doesnt want to work hard. He doesnt want to make things happen. Of late, he has become wary after his injury. He isnt going flat out concerned that he might hurt himself again. Once you get injured it weighs at the back of your mind. Youve got to be brave, he says. 

Arent bowlers suffering injuries more often these days? NoWho said so, pat comes his reply. Its only now that people come to know about it more often. We never complained about injuries. I played two Test matches with a broken finger. No one knew about it except for the manager, captain Clive Lloyd and physio Dennis Waight. 

He doesnt wish to talk of any of the other Indian pacers on view. Ask him about Shane Bond and it seems hes been impressive. Bond looks good. He has good pace and works hard. 

The hype surrounding Lasith Malinga has been hard to fathom, though. A bowler with an extraordinary action. Ive been watching him for the last two years. 

He doesnt wish to predict the outcome of Indias match against Sri Lanka. No guesses, he says. Will the wicket be as lively as the one on which Bangladesh ran through India? There are four different pitches in the square You call this lively? he laughs off. 

So, did the Indians panic on that day? You have the answer.

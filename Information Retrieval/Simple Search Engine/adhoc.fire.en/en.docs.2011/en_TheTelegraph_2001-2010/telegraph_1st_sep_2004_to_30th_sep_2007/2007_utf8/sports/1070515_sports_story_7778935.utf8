 Title for Mickelson

Ponte Vedra: Phil Mickelson overhauled playing partner Sean Hair with a consummate exhibition of golf to clinch his 31st PGA Tour title by two shots at the Players Championship on Sunday. 

One behind Hair at the start of a muggy day at the Tournament Players Club Sawgrass, Mickelson fired a three-under-par 69 to triumph for the first time in the Tours flagship event. 

The American left-hander, competing in his third tournament since switching allegiance to swing coach Butch Harmon, could afford the luxury of a bogey at the last to finish at 11-under 277. 

Compatriot Hair duelled with Mickelson for most of the day before twice finding water at the infamous par-three 17th on his way to a 76 and out of contention in 11th place. 

Spaniard Sergio Garcia, six strokes off the pace at the start of the day, birdied four of the last five holes for a 66 to finish runner-up at nine under. 

Meanwhile, Daniel Chopra came good in the final round with a four-under 68 that enabled him to finish tied 44th. 

The Swede of Indian origin, who was tied 64th overnight, finished with a total of one-over 289. 

Mickelson, one behind the pacesetting Hair overnight, immediately drew level at the top of the leaderboard by rolling in a 24-foot birdie putt at the first. Both players then birdied the par-five second to forge four strokes clear at 10 under as the tournament effectively became a two-horse race. 

Hair missed a six-footer for birdie at the 16th before his victory hopes disappeared when he twice found water behind the island green on 17 to run up a quadruple-bogey seven.

 Miandad wants proper planning 

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain and coach Javed Miandad marked his 50th birthday Tuesday by saying that he fears for the future of the national side. 

What I have been saying for the last three years was not heeded and Pakistan cricket has come to a stage where we have no replacements for players and domestic cricket is in a shambles, Miandad said. 

I predicted Pakistan would do badly in the World Cup and it came about. Now we need proper planning for cricket, otherwise we wont be able to get over the slump. 

Pakistan, the winners of the 1992 World Cup, were knocked out of the 2007 edition in the first round by minnows Ireland. The next day Bob Woolmer was found dead in his Jamaica hotel room. 

Inzamam-ul Haq, who quit as Pakistan skipper after the tournament, said Miandad was the best choice to coach the team after Woolmer but Miandad said he was not interested. 

Why should I apply? asked Miandad, who served as coach between 1998-99, then from 2000-01 and again from 2003-04, when he was replaced by Woolmer. 

I have been busy with assignments and once I complete them I will start private coaching to help budding cricketers because I know cricket is in my blood and I cant be away from it.

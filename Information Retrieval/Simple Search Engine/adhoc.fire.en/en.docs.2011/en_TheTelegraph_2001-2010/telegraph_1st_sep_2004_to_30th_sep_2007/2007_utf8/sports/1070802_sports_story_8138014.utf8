 Sania overcomes Peer pressure

 - Its hard to play against a good friend 

San Diego: Sania Mirza pulled off an impressive 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 win over 12th seed and doubles partner Shahar Peer of Israel to advance to the second round of the $13,40,000 WTA Acura Classic here. 

Sania, who finished runner-up at last weeks Bank of Western Classic in Stanford, will now take on Greeces Eleni Daniilidou at the event which would be eliminated from next years WTA calendar. 

In a two-hour-three-minute contest where the momentum kept swinging back and forth, both Sania and Peer pounded heavy groundstrokes from the baseline to make it an exciting match for the sizeable crowd at the stadium court. 

Sania used her strong forehand to set up winning points and kept Peer under pressure with her service returns. There were a combined 15 service breaks in the match. 

After splitting the first two sets, Sania opened the final set by holding serve and breaking Peer to take a 4-1 lead. 

Later, leading 5-2, Sania got to match point slamming a high forehand volley for a winner. On the next point, the Indian landed a cross-court forehand which Peer could only return into the net. After the win, the world No. 31 said it was her toughest first-round match since she had to play against a good friend. 

Neither of us was happy with the draw because we are friends and its hard to play a friend. It was the toughest first round I could have had. I played well under the circumstances, she said. 

I had wanted to spend the least amount of time possible on court. But I won the match in the end and thats the most important thing, Sania added. (PTI)

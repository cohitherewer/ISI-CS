 SHARP SINGLE 

 Viv, Warne best, says Bucknor 

Kingston: With a career spanning over 150 ODIs, West Indies umpire Steve Bucknor has seen a lot of legends from close quarters, but says no one has been more dangerous with the bat than Sir Vivian Richards, while Shane Warne remains unmatched with the ball. Viv was the batsman who was the most dangerous, the most explosive, Bucknor told a Jamaican newspaper. Warne, he says, is simply the best bowler. 

All play, no pay

Harare: Zimbabwe cricketers, home after their early exit from the World Cup, have been told that they will not get paid until June. The match fees were $2000 (1000) per game, plus $500 for a half-century. What makes it hard for the players is that their contracts contain a clause stating that they will be available for all matches organised by Zimbabwe Cricket. This means that they cannot play club cricket in England this season. If any of the players joins an English club, ZC will almost certainly withhold the money for breach of contract.

SA assistance

Durban: A 70-member South African police squad will leave for the West Indies to assist their Caribbean counterparts in maintaining security at the World Cup. South Africas national police spokesperson on Sunday said the decision to send the team was taken in October last year and has nothing to do with the investigations into Bob Woolmers murder or lingering doubts of match fixing at the event. He did not specify when the team would leave for the Caribbean. Our decision to send the police personnel has nothing to do with the death of Woolmer or match-fixing, he said.

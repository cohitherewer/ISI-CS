 PCB, Ashraf to sue senator

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and its chairman Nasim Ashraf will file separate lawsuits against opposition senator Enver Baig for repeatedly defaming the office of the chairman and maligning the board as an organisation. 

The PCB has decided to file a suit for damages claim against Baig for making disparaging and insulting remarks made in a recent statement. 

PCB spokesman Ehsan Malik said the intent to file damages was serious and not just a threat. We intend to make Mr Baig accountable for his words, he said. 

Ashraf, on his part, said, I will not get down to his (Baigs) level. He has a sick mind and has now crossed all limits. I will take legal course to hold him accountable for these baseless allegations. 

Baig has been a vocal critic of the board and its officials for the last two years and two days ago described Ashraf as one of the most unsuitable men to head the PCB.

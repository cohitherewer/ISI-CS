 Sania moves into Round II

New Delhi: Utilising the one-day break in her rain-interrupted opening round matchto regroup herself, Sania Mirza rallied to post a facile win over Spains Anabel Medina Gerrigues at the $600,000 Pilot Pen tennis tournament at New Haven, US. 

The 28th ranked Indian star, who was trailing 0-1 in the first set on Monday when play was postponed owing to rain, defeated Medina, ranked 33rd, 6-3, 6-3 at the grandstand to advance to the second round. 

I was actually not feeling very well on Monday, so maybe it was a blessing in disguise that the rain came down, she said. 

I took a week off last week I felt I needed it. I feel fresh again and ready for the US Open, added Sania, seeded 26th at the years last Grand Slam. She became the first Indian woman to be seeded in US Open. 

Sania will next play eighth seed Alona Bondarenko of Ukraine, who defeated Belarussian Olga Govortsova in their first round encounter in the Tier II tournament being played in the build-up to the US Open. (PTI)

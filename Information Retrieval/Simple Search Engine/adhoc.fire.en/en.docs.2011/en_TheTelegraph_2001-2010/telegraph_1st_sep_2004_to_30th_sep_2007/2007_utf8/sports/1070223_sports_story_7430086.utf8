 Indians are favourites for semis, says Qadir

 Abdul Qadir

New Delhi: Rahul Dravid and his boys may have concerns with injuries and form, but former Pakistan leg-spinner, the iconic Abdul Qadir, believes India are favourites while Australia will fail to reach the semi-final of the World Cup in the Caribbean. 

Qadir said India had more strengths than weaknesses, and that made them genuine contenders at the quadrennial showpiece starting from March 13. 

India have a formidable batting line-up, and their bowling is well balanced too, which makes them a favourite to reach the semi-finals, said Qadir, in India to lead a Pakistan veterans team in a three-match series this month. 

Its a mediocre fielding side but their superior batting can make up for that, the former Pakistan tweaker said. 

Qadir said he would rather have Zaheer Khan and Sreesanth open the bowling. 

Zaheer has come back as an improved player... Sreesanth at times tries too hard but he is a fighter to the core. They can be lethal with the new ball, he said. 

Qadir said that in the wake of Australia slipping from their world No.1 ranking, every other team would believe they had a chance to win crickets coveted trophy. 

The last six matches (that Australia played and lost five) have given new lease of hope for all other teams, he said. 

The competition has become more even and I feel Australia may fail to make the cut in the semi-finals. 

Australia lost the finals of the tri-series to England before going down to New Zealand 0-3 recently. 

The former leggie, however, put Pakistan as the least likely team to win the trophy. 

Going by current form, the Black Caps look the top team. They have a bowler like Shane Bond in their ranks who can take five wickets in a match, Qadir said. 

That certainly gives them an edge. 

Incidentally, in the last ODI of the Chappell-Hadlee trophy, Australia had amassed a formidable 346 for five, but New Zealand stunned the world champions by posting the second-highest run-chase in one-day history to win with just three balls to spare. 

Then there is South Africa close on their heels. India and Sri Lanka are the two Asian giants likely to reach the last four stage. And you just cant underestimate the hosts (the West Indies). They would be as dangerous as any lion in its den, he said. 

They have a solid batting line-up with Chris Gayle, and Shivnarine Chanderpaul as opening pair. And Ramnaresh Sarwan, when he is back in the side, will make it a strong middle order. 

Qadir said since it would be the last World Cup for Brian Lara, the West Indian great would be keen to sign off on a high. 

He will be that much determined to have that trophy in the cupboard before he hangs his boots. 

Qadirs team will play an Indian side led by Mohammed Azharuddin in three limited-overs games at Udaipur (Friday), Kozhikode (Sunday) and Meerut (Tuesday).

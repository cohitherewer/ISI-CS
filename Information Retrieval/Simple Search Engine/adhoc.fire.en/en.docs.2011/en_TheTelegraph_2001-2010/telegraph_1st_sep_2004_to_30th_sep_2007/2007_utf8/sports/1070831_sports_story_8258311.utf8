Chennai: As the inaugural camp of the Indian Cricket League (ICL) got underway, Kiran More, an executive board member of the rebel group, sounded optimistic of proving the critics wrong. More said that the little known players in the league would make themselves noticed by their performance. 

The 21-day camp, being held in Mayajaal, a resort-cum-entertainment park, 32kms from the city, will be a preparation for the ICLs first ever Twenty20 season, starting in October. Over 56 players, including former India players Hemang Badani, Dinesh Mongia and Tamil Kumaran, have so far reported for the camp. Those playing for English counties will not be available for the camp. 

More said former players like Balwinder Singh Sandhu, Pranab Roy and Rajesh Kamath of Karnataka would be the coaches handling the trainees during the camp. We also have trainers and physios to monitor these boys closely. The trainees will engage themselves in matches during the second week of the camp, he added. (PTI)

 Majid, Arjuna in race for Sunnys post

Karachi: Former captains Majid Khan and Arjuna Ranatunga are among those in contention to succeed Sunil Gavaskar as the head of the ICCs Playing Committee. The chief executives of the Test-playing nations are expected to nominate the next chairman of the cricket committee. 

Pakistan have nominated former Test captain Majid for the position while Sri Lanka have submitted the name of their World Cup-winning captain Ranatunga. Gavaskar was given a one-year extension as head of the playing committee last year but he has to be replaced by a new chairman this year at the ICC annual meeting, a PCB source said. 

We have been trying to lobby and seek support for the candidature of Majid who we feel is the ideal person to replace Gavaskar after his long stint as head of the playing committee, he said. Indias backing will have a major bearing on who wins the race, the official said. 

Pakistan have not been happy with some of the decisions taken by Gavaskar. (PTI)

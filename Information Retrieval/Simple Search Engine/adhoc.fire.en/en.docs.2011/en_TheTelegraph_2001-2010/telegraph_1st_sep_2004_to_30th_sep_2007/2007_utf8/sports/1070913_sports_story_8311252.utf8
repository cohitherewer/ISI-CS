The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Djokovic may push Federer hard

SERVE amp; VOLLEY 

 Naresh Kumar 

The 2007 US Open was lit up by the genius of Roger Federer who won his fourth consecutive title. The bleary eyed pre-dawn vigils on the TV (IST) were richly rewarded. Time and again, Federer made what seemed impossible, possible, leaving one breathless in disbelief. Divine indulgence, it seems, has endowed him with preternatural qualities. 

The preternaturals are a rare species. They can create space and find time when it is not there. Some even defy gravity momentarily. Federer can be equated with the likes of Tiger Woods, Maradona, Nijinsky, Muhammad Ali. 

But he is still two Grand Slam titles short of Pete Samprass 14. 2008 could take Federer beyond Sampras and lead to his deification. Federers challenger, the sleeveless muscular Nadal, fell in the quarters to Ferrer, a fellow Spaniard. 

Tendonitis of the knees, which raised its ugly head during the Wimbledon finals, struck again. It was sad to see a subdued Nadal with taped knees. Normally his bustling presence charges the atmosphere. 

In 60 years of playing and watching tennis I have not seen a player, except Jimmy Connors, driven by such intensity and passion. The brutal use of muscle and sinew imbued in Nadals character may make it difficult for him to stay injury free, specially on hard courts. He is still young and his efforts to usurp Federers throne will no doubt continue unabated. 

The 20 year old Serb, Djokovic, was very impressive indeed. Two of the seven breakpoints held by him against Federer could have given him a 2-0 lead! But this was Djokovics first Grand Slam final and the occasion perhaps proved too big for him, specially playing against somebody who is being considered the greatest ever. On clay courts Nadal toyed with Djokovic, but on the faster hard courts Djokovic seems to have moved ahead of Nadal. 

Fine-tuning and polishing some facets of Djokovics game could make him a real threat to Federers bid for immortality. All Djokovic needs to develop is a put away shot like Federers forehand, the ability to serve big on important points and learn to close out matches. 

Good natured and fun loving, Djokovic brought a refreshing fragrance to the New York crowd which likes to watch blood-and-guts contests spiced with the occasional swear words. 

The crowd loved Djokovics frivolous impersonations of Sharapova and Nadal on the Centre Court. It is rare but refreshing to find fun and laughter nowadays in sporting events. The Serb has a great future. 

Justine Henin won the womens singles title without losing a set. She is a worthy champion who came through the star spangled top half defeating the William sisters en route to the final where she beat the former defending champion Kuznetsova with the loss of only four games. 

One has to admire her impossible is nothing spirit. She is small in size and gets her power from perfect timing and hitting an early ball. Henins game and style have been fashioned by hard work and she seems to lack the fluidity of an all time great. 

Sanias spectacular run of victories before the US Open came to an end when the Russian, Anna Chakvetadze, trounced her 2-6, 3-6 in the third round of the years last major. In a stunning display, Chakvetadze blasted 19 winners and closed out the match in just 53 minutes. It was top-10 fare which left Sania bemused and uncharacteristically subdued. 

Chakvetadze attacked Sanias second serve and put her on the defensive. A poor first serve percentage (48) made things very difficult for the Indian. The fact that Sania could hit only nine winners, highlights Chakvetadzes depth of shots and mobility. Most of Sanias winners come from shortish balls lacking in depth. 

The progress made by Sania is heartening and creditable. Her improved ranking has a solid foundation and is not based on a couple of flashy victories. 

She has learnt, and now has the confidence to handle the grinders of the game who keep the ball in play while probing the weaknesses. Successfully handling the grinders is a pre-requisite to enter the top echelons of the game. 

What sets Sania apart from the rest of the pack is her ability to hit winners and her aggressive attitude. She is the lone Asian in the top-27. Now the ascent to top-10 is like climbing a sheer rock face, there are no steps. The pitons have to be hammered deep with more sacrifice, perseverance and passion. Henins slogan of impossible is nothing should be Sanias slogan. 

Leander Paes odyssey, which started in 1990 with victory at Junior Wimbledon, carries on. The vibrant old warrior fell in the mixed doubles finals in a bid to win his eighth Grand Slam title. Indian tennis is deeply in his debt.

Calcutta: A draw is always better than losing. And keeping in mind the fact that thanks to Dempo SCs lack of application upfront, East Bengal didnt lose their Round VI match for the ONGC National Football League at the Barasat stadium on Saturday, was in essence a relief for the home team. 

The match ended in a goalless draw, but it seemed to have taken a heavy toll on East Bengal. More than dropping two vital points at home, Covan Lawrence and Alvito DCunha suffered serious injuries during the match and are doubtful for the derby match against Mohun Bagan on Tuesday. 

Coach Carlos Roberto Pereira was forced to make the replacements of Covan (hamstring) and Alvito (calf muscle) inside 25 minutes. East Bengal were unable to recover from this double setbacks so early in the match and had to settle for a truce. 

As a result, they missed out on the golden opportunity of leading the table solely for the first time. East Bengal, Dempo and Mahindra are on 11 points each from six outings. 

The three-time champions never looked in proper shape once the injured duo left the field. 

Alvitos departure in the 10th minute, however, was felt more because of his ability of finding the gaps with pinpoint passes and without him, both Boniface Ambani and Edmilson the two-goal hero against JCT in the previous match struggled to penetrate the Dempo defence. 

Ambani once hit the crosspiece, but he was kept under strict vigil by John Dias and Majeck Bolaji. Edmilson, on the other hand, missed two gilt-edged chances once in the 57th minute and another 14 minutes later. 

On both the occasions, the Brazilian just had to direct the ball towards the goal with goalkeeper VP Satish Kumar being out of his position. 

Though, East Bengal custodian Rajat Ghosh Dastidar, who made few dashing saves, pocketed the Man-of-the-Match award, Ambani looked a better choice for it. 

Ambanis tackling and releasing the ball were something which East Bengal supporters must have enjoyed. Sadly, Edmilson was shadow of his show against JCT.

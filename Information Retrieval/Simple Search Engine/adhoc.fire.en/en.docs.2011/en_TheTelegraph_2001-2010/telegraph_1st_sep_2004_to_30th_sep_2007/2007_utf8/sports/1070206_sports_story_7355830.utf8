 Sania is now down one slot to No. 49

New Delhi: After successive weeks of upward surge, Sania Mirza slipped one place to 49 in the singles charts of the latest WTA Tour tennis rankings. 

Sania was off courts last week and the minor backward step had more to do with the big leap of Australian Nicole Pratt, who jumped 20 places to occupy the 45th spot. 

The 20-year old Indian, who plays this week in Pattaya, Thailand, has made significant progress in rankings in the new year. 

An impressive show at Moorila International in Hobart, her first tournament of the season, saw her gain 13 places to 53. 

Then, despite a second round exit at the Australian Open a fortnight ago, Sania was back among the top-50. 

The Hyderabadi girl also went down one spot to be at 24 in the doubles charts. 

Maria Sharapova held her position at the top of the table followed by Justin Henin-Hardenne and Amelie Mauresmo. 

Australian Open winner Serena Williams, who play in bangalore open next, was 15th. 

The next highest placed Indian on the womens tour, Shikha Uberoi, dropped two spots to 230th.

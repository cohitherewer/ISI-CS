The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Queen an Arsenal fan 

London: Arsenals season has been a disappointment on the pitch but at least it seems they can still count on the support of the Queen. 

According to a newspaper report on Monday, the 81-year-old Queen Elizabeth, like her late mother, has been a keen follower of the Gunners for 50 years. 

Players and officials of the north London club were invited to a reception at Buckingham Palace in February after the Queen had to pull out of opening their new Emirates Stadium in October because of a bad back. 

The newspaper has quoted Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas as saying that the Queen had told him she was a fan. It seems the Queen follows football and she told us she was an Arsenal fan, he said. 

An unnamed senior royal source also confirms in the articlethat she supports the club.

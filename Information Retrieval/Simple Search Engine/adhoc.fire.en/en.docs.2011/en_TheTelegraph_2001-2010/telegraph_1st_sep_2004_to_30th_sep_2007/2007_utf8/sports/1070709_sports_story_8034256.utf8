 Woods tied 8th, Appleby leads field

Bethesda: Australian Stuart Appleby took a step toward capturing his first title of the year by shooting a two-under-par 68 to move two strokes clear of the field on Saturday. 

The 36-year-old, bidding for his ninth career title, stands at nine-under 201 for the tournament. 

South Korean K.J. Choi, who opened the day tied with Appleby, is second after shooting a par 70. American Steve Stricker is third, one stroke behind Choi after firing a 67. 

World No. 1 Tiger Woods, doubling up this week as player and host, failed to make a serious run at the leaders by shooting a one-under 69. 

The new father is two-under for the tournament and in a tie with Jim Furyk and Kevin Stadler for eighth place, seven strokes behind Appleby.

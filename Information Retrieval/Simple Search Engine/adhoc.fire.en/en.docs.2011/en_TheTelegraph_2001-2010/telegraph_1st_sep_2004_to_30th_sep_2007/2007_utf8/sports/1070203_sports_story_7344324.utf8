 Moody: 1-6 loss has no relevance

 - Happy to be starting at Eden: Mahela 

 Mahela Jayawardene in Mumbai on Friday 

Mumbai: Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene and coach Tom Moody said they were looking forward to the tough challenge of playing against India which they saw as a fine opportunity to fine-tune ahead of the World Cup. 

Moody played down the absence of key bowlers Muttiah Muralidharan and Chaminda Vaas due to niggling injuries and said their non-availability has given a chance to others to step up to the plate and deliver. 

Jayawardene, while agreeing India were a formidable force at home, said his team was undaunted by Rahul Dravid amp; Co.s 3-1 victory over the West Indies. 

India played against the West Indies and not against us. But I know its a big challenge playing India in India. We have been performing well away from home and its another good challenge for the young team, he said. 

We are happy to start at the Eden and in a day-night match. A lot of young guys in the side have never played there. Only four of us are still left from the 1996 team that beat India in the World Cup semi-finals, said the visiting captain. 

Moody dismissed talks of this series being seen by the Lankans as a revenge rubber for the 1-6 loss suffered by the islanders in the previous series. 

That was 14 months ago and a lot of water has flown under the bridge as far as we are concerned. We are obviously focused and determined to win this series. 

We are a different outfit now than what we were a year and a half ago. The relevance of the earlier series is not to be considered, the Lankan coach pointed out. 

THE SQUAD: Mahela Jayawardene (captain), Kumar Sangakkara, Sanath Jayasuriya, Upul Tharanga, Maravan Atapattu, Tillekeratne Dilshan, Chamara Silva, Russel Arnold, Upul Chandana, Farveez Mahroof, Lasith Malinga, Dilhara Fernando, Malinga Bandara, Nuwan Zoysa and Nuwan Kulasekera. Coach: Tom Moody. (PTI)

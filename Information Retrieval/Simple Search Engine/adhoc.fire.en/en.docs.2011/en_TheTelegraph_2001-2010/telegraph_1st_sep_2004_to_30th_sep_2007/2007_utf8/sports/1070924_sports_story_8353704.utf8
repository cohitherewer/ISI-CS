 Hussey out, Hopes to replace Watson

Melbourne: Mike Hussey will miss Australias tour of India with a hamstring injury, while Queensland allrounder James Hopes will replace injured Shane Watson, Cricket Australia said on Sunday. 

Hussey became the third Australian, after Watson and Ricky Ponting, to pick up a hamstring injury in the ongoing World Twenty20 meet. 

While Watson has been altogether ruled out of the tour, Ponting will travel with the side even though he would miss at least the first two games of the seven-match ODI series. 

Australian team physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said the nature and timing of Husseys injury would rule him out of contention. (PTI)

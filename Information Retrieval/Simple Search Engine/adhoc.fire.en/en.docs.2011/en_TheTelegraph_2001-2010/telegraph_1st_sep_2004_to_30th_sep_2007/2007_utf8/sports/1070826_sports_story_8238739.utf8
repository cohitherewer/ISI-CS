 Ghei takes sole lead

Johor Bahru: Gaurav Ghei showed tremendous patience and determination as he hung in solidly with a round of one-under 70 to take lead at the inaugural $300,000 Iskandar Johor Open golf tournament on Saturday. 

Ghei, who has already tasted victory twice in last 12 months, overcame three bogeys in last six holes on a tough and challenging Royal Johor Country Club Course, which has become even more difficult following wet conditions. 

Meanwhile, young rookie Gaganjeet Bhullar (70) moved from tied 36th to tied 14th. He had three birdies and two bogeys in his round. (PTI)

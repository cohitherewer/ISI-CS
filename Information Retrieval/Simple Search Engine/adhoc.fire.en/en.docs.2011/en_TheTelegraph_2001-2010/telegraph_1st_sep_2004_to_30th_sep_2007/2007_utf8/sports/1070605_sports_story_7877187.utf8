 Roger praise stuns Svetlana

Paris: Thinking people were making it up, Svetlana Kuznetsova logged on to the Internet to read the evidence herself. 

When she saw it written in plain English, she had to pinch herself Roger Federer had picked out the Russian as his favourite player on the womens tour. I like her game, she plays well, Federer declared earlier in the week. 

It sent Kuznetsova into a spin. The Russian press told me and I thought No, it was a joke. So I wanted to check it myself and read this on the Internet, she said. 

Roger is a legend and to hear him say that is almost a dream, she added.

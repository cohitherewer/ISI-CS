The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 One never knows what tomorrow holds...

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 

 Yuvraj looks back ON the 2003 World Cup and ahead 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Yuvraj Singh

Calcutta: There was shock and horror when Yuvraj Singh was put on crutches after a knee injury on the eve of Team Indias last Champions Trophy match, in end-October. 

Shock that the classy southpaw became a victim of kho-kho; horror at the possibility of his missing the World Cups ninth edition. 

Thankfully, Yuvraj recovered by mid-January and made a comeback before the month ended. 

Now, the 25-year-old is looking to make the most of opportunities in the four-match ODI series against Sri Lanka. However, owing to a sore back, theres a doubt over his availability for Thursdays face-off at the Eden. 

Crickets biggest stage, of course, comes into view soon after the Sri Lankans return home. The countdown, indeed, has begun. 

The other day, Yuvraj spoke to The Telegraph about his World Cup memories, understandably focusing much on 2003. 

The following are excerpts 

On his earliest World Cup memory 

I dont recall anything instantly about the one in 1992 Indias win over Pakistan in the 1996 quarter final (Bangalore) is what comes to mind The match finished quite late and I can still visualise the night-long celebrations in Chandigarh I

 remember having watched the match with dad (Yograj) 

On his emotions when India lost (by default) in the next round, to Sri Lanka, at the Eden 

Was upset We shouldnt have chased Looking back, a tactical mistake was made I recall the visuals of Vinod Kambli crying For

 young fans, particularly, the outcome was crushing. 

On the 1999 World Cup 

Watched it on TV as I wasnt earning enough to make a trip to England! There are a few standout memories: The 318-run partnership for the second-wicket between Sourav (Ganguly) and Rahul (Dravid) versus Sri Lanka in Taunton We thrashed them, exacting revenge for what happened in the previous World Cup Then, I remember being spell-bound by the Australia-South Africa semi-final Allan Donalds run out in the last over is etched in memory I was convinced South Africa would win that World Cup, but it wasnt to be I also havent

 forgotten the manner in which Australia bowled in the final (against Pakistan)

 to win by eight wickets. 

On being picked for the 2003 World Cup 

Id already played for a couple of years, but was nevertheless thrilled I knew it was a big stage and, though the tour of New Zealand (in the lead-up) didnt go off well, Id got decent scores in some of the ODIs In

 those conditions, a 54 and 33 meant much. 

On few having had high hopes when the team left for South Africa 

Thats because except for (Virender Sehwag) Veeru, the batsmen had mostly been out of form Yet, we werent

 short on self-belief and one good game could change things. We knew that. 

On the anger at home after India lost to Australia in the very second match (in Centurion) 

It was disappointing, but not totally unexpected Fans in India do react in extremes But,

 then, the entire country had been keyed up 

On the Zimbabwe match in Harare marking the turnaround 

We won eight on the trot (defeating Zimbabwe, Namibia,

 England, Pakistan, Kenya, Sri Lanka, New Zealand, Kenya again, in the semi-final) It was a phenomenal run and Im

 privileged to have been part of such a team. For us players, those were very

 special weeks. 

On what changed the script 

Sachin Tendulkar had a great tournament (673 runs

 in 11 matches) He stood out Sachin apart, whenever the need arose, somebody or the other put his hand up and made a difference Sourav scored an unbeaten 107 in the Super Six match versus Kenya (Cape Town) Ashish Nehra had a terrific spell in Durban (at Englands expense) That match also saw partnerships of significance (Zaheer

 Khan) Zak had great spells, too (After a pause) Wed been supremely

 fit and, in my opinion, that made a difference. 

On three standout memories of the 2003 World Cup 

 The tension before and during the Pakistan match in Centurion Never have I felt the same way and, even four years on, cant explain how I managed to stay calm There had been many familiar faces around From industry, the world of entertainment Their presence added to the expectations and tension Id been wanting to smash Wasim Akram for a four, but while I remained not out on 50, he didnt give even one boundary-ball Thats a personal disappointment 

 Our superb win (by 82 runs) over England in Durban Great bowling from Nehra and Zak after a string of partnerships had taken us to 250 Wed fallen short of 270, the total we had in mind, but even 20 less turned out to be more than enough I remember a stunning Sachin pull off Andrew Caddick Also, Mohammed Kaifs run out of Nick Knight very early in the England innings. 

 Making the final Of course, wed never been in with any chance after conceding 359 It wasnt destined to be our day and (Ricky) Ponting played a great innings (unbeaten 140 off 138 balls) 

On the time it took to get over that disappointment 

Some days, certainly Id expected fans at home to vent their anger, but they showed maturity We played very well, otherwise wouldnt have won eight matches in succession. Credit for that cant

 ever be taken away. 

On the forthcoming World Cup 

The first phase is important as the momentum gained

 is going to help in the later stages (Super Eight onwards) We must not put ourselves under extra pressure I mean, nobody changes his game because its

 the World Cup. 

On Brian Laras comment that, right

 now, the Australians alone look like booking a semi-final berth 

(Grins) Australias record suggests that, doesnt it? Theyve

 made the finals of the last three World Cups and only lost in 1996 (to Sri

 Lanka) 

On Indias chances 

One never knows what tomorrow holds The team will give its best shot, after that lets see Consistently putting in one hundred per cent is going to be the aim Everybody who gets selected will surely be aware of his responsibility and what needs to be done So If

 I may add, the fans should support us passionately, more so if the going gets

 tough 

On whether, immediately after the nasty injury,

 hed feared missing out on the World Cup 

(Emotionally) I began crying when Dr (Anant)

 Joshi examined me for the first time in Mumbai and said I could be out for

 four-six months if I underwent surgery I couldnt control myself However, he also pointed out there had been instances of sportsmen recovering without surgery and that I would have to work very hard I was game as I didnt want to miss cricket for six months Didnt

 want to sit at home while the World Cup was on 

On his rehab 

Im grateful to those who worked with me, particularly Dr Joshis son Mithun Besides physiotherapy, he helped me stay tough mentally Mithun was a source of so much strength I also took confidence from the affection of well-wishers across the country Irrespective of where I went, people kept urging me to get fit To make a comeback Such emotional backing lifted my confidence unbelievably The

 blessings of my Guruji and the prayers of mom (Shabnam) helped in a big way

 as well. 

Finally, on the thought which comes first to mind as he looks back on two-and-half months of rehab 

Luckily, I got injured four-and-half months before

 the World Cup and not just weeks prior to the event I had time to recover When Id got injured, Id thought I would have plenty of time Wouldnt know what to do with myself Believe me, the rehab actually left me with no time at all Id thought, for example, I would read books, but couldnt go beyond the odd magazine Perhaps, Im

 going to read a book or two during all the travelling in the coming weeks!

New Delhi: Sania Mirza won her first WTA Tour title of the season by clinching the doubles crown at the $145,000 Morocco Open with American Vania King in Fes on Saturday. 

According to information received here, Sania and Vania thrashed Romanian Andrea Ehritt-Vanc and Russian Anastasia Rodionova 6-1, 6-2 in the final. 

This was Sanias fourth career doubles title and the first outside India. She also has a singles crown, in hometown Hyderabad.

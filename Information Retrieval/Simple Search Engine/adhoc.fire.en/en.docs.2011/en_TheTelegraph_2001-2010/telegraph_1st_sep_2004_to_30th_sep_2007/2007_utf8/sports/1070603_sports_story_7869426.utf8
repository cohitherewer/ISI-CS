 Percy Sonn laid to rest 

Cape Town: The International Cricket Councils (ICC) first African president Percy Sonn was laid to rest on Saturday, six days after the South African died from complications following colon surgery. 

Leading members of the international cricketing fraternity, the government and judiciary packed St Georges Cathedral in Cape Town as Sonn was eulogised. 

It is amazing that Percy, the boy from Bellville Cricket Club, became the boss of world cricket, ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said. 

Sonn, 57, succeeded Ehsan Mani as head of the world governing body in June 2006 after two years as the organisations vice-president. 

Pall bearers into the cathedral included Zimbabwean cricket administrator Peter Chingoka and Gerald Majola, Cricket South Africas CEO. (Reuters)

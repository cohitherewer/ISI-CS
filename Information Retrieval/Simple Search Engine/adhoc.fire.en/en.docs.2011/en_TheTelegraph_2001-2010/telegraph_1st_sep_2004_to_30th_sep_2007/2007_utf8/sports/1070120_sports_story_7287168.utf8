 We expect a great fight: Lara

 - Fast bowlers would be wary of Sourav, says West Indies captain 

 Brian Lara

Nagpur: Brian Lara was in his elements on Friday. Besides warning his team to be on guard against Indians, who he felt would target this series to steer clear of their prolonged form slump in ODIs, Lara also had some words of praise for Sourav Ganguly, the former Team India captain. 

Lara was sure that Sourav, recalled to the ODI squad after a long gap, wouldnt find it difficult to get back into the groove. 

I think Sourav is a very good player. I dont think it will be hard for him to get into the groove immediately. All fast bowlers will be wary of him. Hes an international player, a former India captain, Lara said. 

Lara also wanted his mates to be prepared for a great fight from the Indians. 

We expect a great fight from India in this series. They are coming into this series after some poor performances South Africa, Champions Trophy, tri-series in Malaysia. I know they would be coming hard, knowing how important this campaign is for them before the World Cup, the West Indies skipper said at a media conference here on Friday. 

This series gives an opportunity to them to try and turn the tables as well (after West Indies wins in six of the last eight games between the two sides). 

India havent had great success in South Africa in the one-dayers and they would be looking for a change of fortunes. It (the series) will be very competitive, the Trinidadian left-hander said. 

Its important for us that we have a psychological advantage and continue with it. There are four one-day games. We are looking to stay dominant over India, the world record holder for the highest Test score said. 

The series will begin with a match here on Sunday while the three other games will be played in Cuttack (Wednesday), Chennai (Saturday) and Vadodara (January 31). 

Lara, though, felt it would have been ideal if this series had been played in the Caribbean islands. 

I think it would have been much better if India had come to the West Indies. But if we had to come here to play some cricket then we would do that. 

Its necessary that we do get some international cricket under our belt after our last tour to Pakistan in the middle of December. Its good to play some competitive cricket, he said. Up to a few days ago we were not sure this series was on. That would have been a disappointment. 

The visiting captain felt that not playing international cricket after this series till the World Cup would not be a disadvantage. 

I think its important that we do get some rest after this series to ensure that we come strong for the camp and the World Cup. 

Its good that we could come out here first of all, play in conditions that are not too far away from the West Indian conditions. Then we get back home to get some rest before the World Cup. I think everything is running quite smoothly. 

Lara said in the absence of some regulars such as Ramnaresh Sarwan and Corey Collymore, others get an opportunity to show their talent and press for a World Cup spot. 

We have got a team just a couple players short. We have a few players who are not here because of injury or other reasons. We have someone like (Reyad) Emrit whos here for the first time. If this guy wants to stake a claim for the World Cup, he needs to get an opportunity now. 

Yes, this (tour) is important. Its the last lap of our preparation and to ensure everyone gets an opportunity to prepare their case, he said. 

Lara singled out Dwayne Smith as the person who can use the tour to cement his place. 

We have a couple of players who are new to one-day cricket and a few who are making a comeback like Smith. 

This gives an opportunity to Smith to get his batting right. We depend not only on his bowling but his batting too. 

Hes a match-winner and is capable of performing well. Now he has an opportunity and hopefully he can grab hold of it and ensure that he cements his place for the World Cup. We have committed ourselves to playing good one-day cricket. We know we are the hosts of the World Cup. 

As a team we have moved on. We have played very good cricket and made two finals in 2006 and lost both against Australia. We still have to work a bit to become more consistent, he said. 

Meanwhile, Emrit is excited about the prospect of bowling to the likes of Sachin Tendulkar, and says he is not daunted by the task. 

I am excited to go out there and bowl at world class players such as (Sachin) Tendulkar and (Rahul) Dravid and hopefully getting them out as well, Emrit said.

 Alonso told he can leave McLaren

Fernando Alonso has been informed by Ron Dennis, the McLaren Mercedes team principal, that he can leave at the end of this season, a well-placed source have told The Times. 

The Formula One rumour mill is in full flow over the future of Alonso after his role in the vain attempt to prevent Lewis Hamilton, his teammate, from taking pole position during qualifying for last weekends Hungarian Grand Prix. 

The source said last night: My understanding is that hes been told he can go because theyre so fed up with him. Ron is just very p***ed off with both of them (Alonso and Hamilton). 

Alonso, who is contracted to the Woking-based team until the end of 2009 on a salary of about $20 million (10 million) a year, has indicated in remarks to the Spanish media that his future at McLaren is in doubt, as have key advisers in his entourage. 

Even before the row over the attempt to delay Hamilton, sources close to the Spanish driver were making it clear that he was unhappy at the team and was dismayed at what he regards as McLaren reneging on their initial deal to make him the lead driver. 

The prospect of Alonso leaving McLaren has encouraged speculation in the paddock about where the double and defending world champion may go. Among the possibilities are a move to Ferrari, at the expense of Felipe Massa, a return to Renault, where he would probably replace Giancarlo Fisichella, his former teammate, or a switch to BMW Sauber or even Toyota. 

Dennis acknowledged in Budapest on Sunday that Alonsos future was the subject of serious discussion in rival teams. There is an inevitability that these things are rumoured and discussed, he said.

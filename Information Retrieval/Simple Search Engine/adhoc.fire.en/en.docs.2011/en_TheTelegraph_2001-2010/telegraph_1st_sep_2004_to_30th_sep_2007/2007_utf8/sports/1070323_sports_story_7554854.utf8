The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We want to be tested: Hussey

Basseterre: Australian players are chomping at the bit ahead of their final key Group A match against bitter rivals and now world No. 1 South Africa. 

The boys are really training well and they are so pumped up for this game, they cant wait, Mike Hussey said of Saturdays showdown which will decide who tops the group and carry two points into the Super Eights. 

The 31-year-old left-handed batsman, dubbed Mr Cricket by his teammates for his commitment and professionalism, said Australia had not been tested in their first two matches against Scotland and The Netherlands, won by 203 and 229 runs respectively. 

The first two games have been good and we have just been getting used to the conditions. We have played well but we havent been tested a hell of a lot by the opposition, said Hussey. 

Hussey, under whom Australia lost the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy 0-3 to New Zealand last month, said plans will have to be executed well against South Africa. 

We have to prepare well and play very well on the day. It is nice to play at this ground and we understand the conditions now, understand the short boundaries, and hope we execute our plans better than we did in the summer. 

Hussey said both teams have respect for each other and it would be a hard-fought match. 

The teams have a healthy respect for each other, and I think theyve realised that any sort of banter doesnt really work. You can have all the mind games you want and the slanging-matches going back and forth. 

But at the end of the day I dont think it really works at all. What matters is out on the field. How well you play the game. 

Two proud countries, two pretty proud histories. Just such an important game. It is a huge game and very, very important in the whole scheme of things, and we want to be tested, we want a real serious contest. 

Hussey hoped Australia can expose South Africas weaknesses at Warner Park. On these grounds you can go the journey a bit in those last few overs. I wouldnt say South Africa have got a problem, were going to be targeting a lot of areas, not just one or two, said Hussey. We need a complete game of cricket, because if we dont come off in just one area, well come up short. Well be focusing on a full 100 overs, rather than just their death bowling time in the middle. 

Hussey, who managed just 12 and two in the first two matches, was not concerned over his form. I try not to look at results too much because I come in in so many different situations. Itd be nice to come in and have a bat, but its a long tournament and there are going to be important times when I have to come in and play my job. 

As a batsman you always look at a ground and target certain areas. In Auckland, its slightly off-centre for the left-hander so you need adjustment, said Hussey. (AFP)

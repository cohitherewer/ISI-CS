 Rohan-Aisam best

New Delhi: Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-ul Haq Qureshi claimed their second successive doubles title after outplaying Mustafa Ghouse and Joshua Goodall in the summit clash of the $25,000 ATP Challenger tennis event in Nottingham on Saturday. 

The third seed Indo-Pak pair, which had won the title in Manchester, got the better of Indo-Briton pair 6-3, 7-6 (5) to garner 50 ATP points. The losing duo received 35 points. 

However, Qureshi missed the chance to make it double delight for himself as he went down fighting in the final match 3-6, 6-4, 4-6 against second seed Australian Alun Jones. (PTI)

 Kevin: The start of a golden era 

THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES

Apart from an early scare, England easily chased down Indias total of 187 with 13 overs to spare to win their first home one-day series for three years in front of a sell-out crowd on Saturday. 

Kevin Pietersen (71 not out) believes this could be the start of a golden period for the limited-overs side. It means a heck of a lot to me. This is the first one-day series Ive won with England, the Man of the Match said. 

I was really disappointed after (losing) the last game (at the Oval), but Im a happy man. I look forward now to South Africa (and the ICC World Twenty20 meet) with the team weve got it could be a great tournament for us. 

England captain Collingwood admitted that the returning Andrew Flintoff made a difference to England, but conceded his ankle injury had still not been resolved. The allrounder needed a pain-killing injection to play on Saturday and Collingwood conceded there may be repercussions. When you have Freddie coming on first change it puts them under the pump. He makes a big difference, he said. 

And if he can play any part in the tournament, England will view it as a risk worth taking. Freddie was a little sore after bowling, said Collingwood. 

Freddies always willing to bowl, but from a captains point of view you dont want to make anything worse. All the time you are asking if hes ok, and he said he was fine. Theres a little bit of soreness, but well have to take it from there.

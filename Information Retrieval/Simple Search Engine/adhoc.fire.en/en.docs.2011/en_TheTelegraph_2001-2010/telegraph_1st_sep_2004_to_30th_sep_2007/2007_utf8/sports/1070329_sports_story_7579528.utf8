Karachi: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq and several of his teammates slipped out of Lahore airport without speaking to the media when they returned home from a disappointing World Cup campaign on Wednesday. 

The players were escorted from a cargo terminal gate to their waiting cars before driving off with relatives and friends. 

The arrival of Inzamam, Mohammed Hafeez, Shoaib Malik, Rao Iftikhar, Rana Naved-ul Hasan, Umar Gul, Imran Nazir, assistant coach Mushtaq Ahmed and media manager, Pervez Mir completed the return of the Pakistan squad which was eliminated in the first round of the World Cup. 

We have been waiting here for over two hours and now we are told they have left by a side door. Even the media manager has not faced us, complained a Pakistani newsman. Why cant they face us and the people? he asked. 

Earlier in the day, four more Pakistani cricketers returned from London and got a rough welcome. Kamran Akmal and Shahid Afridi describing the time they spent in Kingston as one of the worst of their lives. 

We are really ashamed of our performance in the World Cup. We wanted so much to give joy to our people but things didnt work for us. We never got time to recover. We can only apologise to our people for letting them down, Akmal said. 

Afridi was advised to quit cricket and sell lentils, while his teammates were told point blank go to hell as seething Pakistani fans hurled abuse at some of their fallen heroes who returned home after their World Cup debacle. 

On their return via London, Afridi, Akmal, Danish Kaneria and Mohammed Sami faced barracking at the Karachi Airport with the jostling crowd asking all sort of uncomfortable questions. 

Why have you come back? asked one from the melee, while another irate fan shouted Afridi, go and sell lentils. 

Part of the crowd shouted go to hell as policemen escorted Afridi, helping him to get into his car and drive away. The 200-odd crowd shouted shame! shame! at Akmal, who took a connecting flight to Lahore. 

Akmal said the entire team was stunned by the defeat to Ireland. To be honest, we never thought we would lose to them. Even after our poor batting performance we were confident that we could bowl them out, he said. 

Afridi, was serving a ban and missed the defeats to the West Indies and Ireland. 

The allrounder said the players faced a lot of pressure after the defeat to Ireland and the death of coach Bob Woolmer. 

About 200 people who had gathered at the airport taunted the mercurial batsman with chants of Afridi! Sell lentils! and Deserter, where are you going? and marched behind him as dozens of police escorted him to a waiting car. 

Woolmers death hit us like a thunderbolt. We knew he was terribly disappointed and down at our performance but after the match he had kept on encouraging us and telling us these things happen and we were much a better team, Afridi recalled. 

Kaneria said the players just wanted to get out of Kingston, a place where they lost their coach. There was so much pressure on us. The media was everywhere. Woolmers death didnt even allow us to think where we had gone wrong against Ireland, he said. 

Akmal hoped he would get to play in another World Cup to set things right. All of us are disappointed that we couldnt do better in the tournament but we just played badly and nothing else.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Under pressure Jaffer shows class

 - Karthiks commendable application in 153-run stand 

 An Indian wicket, says centurion 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Dinesh Karthik in Cape Town on Tuesday 

Cape Town: Keeping faith in Wasim Jaffer finally paid off. Getting Dinesh Karthik to open clicked. Now, its to be seen whether Virender Sehwag can justify the extraordinary faith shown by the Team India thinktank. 

Mahendra Singh Dhonis non-availability came as a setback on the eve of the decider, but Rahul Dravid did well to call tails on a wicket with the subcontinental look. Yeh Newlands hai or is the match being played in New Delhi? quipped Wasim Akram. 

The former Pakistan captain wasnt exactly off the mark and the Kotla curator couldnt have done much better. Jaffer, in fact, went to the extent of saying it was an Indian wicket. In effect, little bounce and hardly any movement. Well, in the last Champions Trophy, Mohali reminded captain Graeme Smith of wickets at home. If this actually is a trend, were in for interesting times. 

Speaking to The Telegraph, Capetonian Herschelle Gibbs exclaimed: Jesus, I dont know what has been happening... The explanation has to come from the groundsman... Its to be seen whether we have another long day in the field... 

With the three-Test Castle series 1-1, both teams had sights on wresting the initiative straightaway. Smith tripped at the toss and, then, his bowlers stumbled as Jaffer (116) and Karthik (63) put on 153 for the first-wicket. Its a first for India in South Africa. 

Seemed surreal given the poor starts in the first two Tests. The previous best, for any team, had been 99 between Smith and AB De Villiers in the second innings at Kingsmead. 

To an extent, Smiths management of bowling resources helped the Indians. 

While the technically proper Jaffers third century (watched by wife Ayesha) was the focal point on the field, the protection provided to Sehwag opening from the 2002 tour of England was much the talking point off it. 

Having the former vice-captain in the middle-order may prove as successful a move as elevating Karthik, whod opened for South in the Duleep Trophy this season, but somebody so short on confidence that he cant do his regular job should be dropped. Not accommodated. 

With Sehwag slated to bat at No.6, Sourav Ganguly will have to lead the tail from No.7. Its pretty absurd. Moreover, the question is: Has a precedent been set or have we seen an exception? 

The last time an Indian wicketkeeper (Parthiv Patel) opened in a Test was in Rawalpindi, almost three years ago. 

Karthik was dropped by Smith on 32 (95 for no loss), but full marks for application and the desire to quickly make a mark in his first appearance since Harare 16 months ago. 

For a change, the full 90 overs were bowled, though the opening day went beyond the scheduled close. India finished on 254 for three, with Sachin Tendulkar on a smart 28. V.V.S. Laxman is the other not out batsman. 

Expressing happiness, Jaffer accepted hed been under pressure. He said: I hadnt done well on the tour, but the time spent in the middle in Durban (second innings) helped here... I wanted to continue from where Id left off... 

Having played an atrocious shot there, he added he didnt want to repeat mistakes. 

Showing little emotion, Jaffer continued: Im thankful to God... Forging an understanding with Karthik wasnt difficult as were friends and have been sitting next to each other (team bus) throughout the tour... With the wicket helping spin and rough patches visible, a total of 450-500 is going to be very good... 

Jaffers centuries, by the way, have come in the last ten months. While he will celebrate, spare a thought for poor Harbhajan Singh. Hes going to return home without playing even at a venue where the South Africans capped a spinner. 

Team Indias next Test will only be after the World Cup.

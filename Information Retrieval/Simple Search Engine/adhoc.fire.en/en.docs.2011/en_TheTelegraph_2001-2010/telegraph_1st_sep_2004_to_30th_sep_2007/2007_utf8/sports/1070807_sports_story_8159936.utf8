The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 This one felt good, says Woods 

Akron: Firestone always seems the perfect place for Tiger Woods to show his best stuff. This year, the timing could not have been much better. 

In the final event before the final major of the year, Woods buried Rory Sabbatini and the rest of the field on Sunday at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational for an eight-shot victory (as reported in Mondays Late City edition), sending his confidence soaring before next weeks PGA Championship. 

This might just give me a little more confidence, Woods said. 

The whole idea was to win this event, but be playing well going into next week, Woods said. 

I feel I made some nice strides this week, and I feel very good going into next week. ...I feel like Im in better shape heading into this one than I do going into the last major. 

One stroke behind pacesetting Sabbatini at the start of the day, Woods fired a five-under-par 65 to win the tournament he has almost made his own for a sixth time, and a third year in a row. 

The world No. 1 overhauled Sabbatini with three birdies in the first four holes before romping to his 58th PGA Tour career title and fourth this season. 

He twice chipped in from just off the green en route to an eight-under total of 272 and a 14th individual victory in a World Golf Championships (WGC) event. 

Britains Justin Rose fired a four-birdie 68 to climb into a share of second place with South African Sabbatini (74) at level par, one ahead of American Chris DiMarco (70) and Australias Peter Lonard (68). 

I like these things, Woods told reporters after earning a cheque for $1.35 million and his 11th WGC strokeplay title in 17 starts. How can you not like playing the worlds best players? They (these events) really get our juices going. 

I just got in my own little world, like I tend to do every now and then, and I wanted to not make any mistakes out there, added the American, who holed a 12-foot par putt at the last for the only bogey-free round of the day. 

I wanted to keep putting the pressure on the guys that were chasing. I felt if I could just keep making a bunch of pars, the guys were going to have to get greedy and aggressive to some of these pins and probably make a mistake. 

Woods, who has also won six times at the WGC-CA Championship, trails only Sam Snead for the most victories by a player at a single PGA Tour event. Snead triumphed eight times at the Greater Greensboro Open. 

It was the second time Woods has strung together three straight victories at this WGC, and he tied a PGA Tour record by winning for the sixth time on the same course. 

Jack Nicklaus won six Masters at Augusta National, and Alex Ross won six times at the North amp; South Open at Pinehurst No. 2 at the turn of the 20th century. 

This one felt good, Woods said. 

Argentinas Andres Romero briefly held a share of second place with Rose before triple-bogeying the 10th on his way to a 71 and a three-way tie for sixth at two over. 

tiger rsquo;s tale

 Woods rsquo; sixth win at the Bridgestone on Sunday

 moved him into a tie for second for most victories by a player in one PGA Tour

 event. Sam Snead won the Greater Greensboro Open in 1938, rsquo;46, rsquo;49, rsquo;50, rsquo;55-56,

 '60 and rsquo;65, with the 27-year span between his first and eighth victories

 also a tour record.

 Woods has now won the Bridgestone in 1999-2001,

 2005-2007. He joins Harry Vardon (British Open 1896, 1898-99, 1903, rsquo;11, rsquo;14), Alex Ross

 (North amp; South Open 1902, rsquo;04, rsquo;07-08, rsquo;10, rsquo;15),

 Snead again (Miami Open 1937, rsquo;39, rsquo;46, rsquo;50-51, rsquo;55)

 and Jack Nicklaus (Masters 1963, rsquo;65-66, rsquo;72, rsquo;75, rsquo;86).

 Woods has also won another WGC tournament six

 times mdash; the American

 Express Championship five times and then this spring, the WGC-CA Championship.

 Those were won on six different courses.

 Only four players mdash; including Woods, at Bay Hill from 2000 to 2003 mdash; have

 ever won the same tournament more than three times in a row.

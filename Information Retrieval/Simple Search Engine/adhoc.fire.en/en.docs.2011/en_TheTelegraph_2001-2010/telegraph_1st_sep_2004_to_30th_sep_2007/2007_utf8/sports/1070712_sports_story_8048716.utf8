Calcutta: There wasnt another decent player in school whom she could form a team with. So, Priya Saha went it alone in the Patterson Memorial table tennis championships. And came out tops in girls singles. 

The class X student of Belgharia Texmaco Estate School made a nervous start in the final, making some elementary errors to concede the first game to Shreyoshi Sur of Bhadreswar Dharmatala HS. Priya, a state champion in the cadet and nursery divisions who has started competing in the junior category just this year, played a fine second game to level scores. 

Game 3 went neck-and-neck but once Priya squeezed that out, she easily had the measure of Shreyoshi. 

The boys final went the distance before Anubhav Kundu of Kotrang Adarsha Vidyalaya clinched it. Hetame Abir Banerjee 11-5, 11-13, 5-11, 11-7, 11-5. 

For Abir, it was a case of so near (to a double crown) and yet so far. The lanky Purulia boy from Chittaranjan HS, earlier won two singles and the doubles to help his school lift the boys team crown, was four points away from individual glory as well. Apoorva Hazra did an Abir in the girls team final to help Lakshmipat Singhania Academy A claim top honours. 

Aishwarya Negi lost the first match to Parnova Das, giving Uttarpara Girls HS the early advantage. But little Apoorva, a class VI student took centrestage thereafter. She won her two singles ties comfortably and teamed up with Aishwarya to bag the doubles as well.

New York: Sania Mirza got off to a winning start in the US Open on Tuesday, coming from a set behind to beat Estonian Kaia Kanepi. The Indian No. 1, seeded 26th at the years last Grand Slam, won 6-2, 6-7 (5-7), 6-1. 

Sania was made to sweat by her unheralded opponent for an hour and 40 minutes. The world No. 27 next meets the 60th-ranked Laura Granville in the second round, after the American routed Frenchwoman Olivia Sanchez 6-2, 6-2. 

The Hyderabad girl began well by pocketing the first set without any trouble. Kanepi hung on grimly to push the second set to a tie-break and bagged it 7-5. 

Sania was back to her aggressive best in the final set. She broke the Estonian twice. Sanias victory was sealed when Kanepi buried a return into the net. 

Former champion and fourth-seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova overcame an early break point to dominate Klara Zakopalova 6-2, 6-3 to move into the second round. 

The 81st-ranked Czech pushed Kuznetsova to break point in the opening game, but succumbed three points later and lost the opening set in 25 minutes. Kuznetsova, who made 70 percent of her first serves, and Zakopalova traded three consecutive breaks to leave the Russian ahead 5-3 in the second set, and she served out in her first step of a bid to repeat her 2004 title. 

In the second set, I wasnt playing so good, so I was just trying to get the ball back, Kuznetsova said. I have to improve. I have to be more careful about my feet. 

I love to be here, said Kuznetsova, who won the US Open in 2004. Its so cool. I love the city. I would love to do some photo shoot or something here just on the streets because I think its so special. I just love being her. Its so crazy. 

The attitude is not shared by all, including top-seeded Justine Henin, who has said that the US Open is probably the least favourite of the Grand Slams. 

Im different than Justine, Kuznetsova said. Yesterday I came out on the court to practice ... and looked to me a bit of a zoo because everybody was yelling. From New Haven, I was like Oh, thats too loud. But in a couple days you just get used to it and its just a great environment. 

Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia claimed the first upset of the day, eliminating No. 23 Tathiana Garbin 6-4, 6-3. 

Former world No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt made an impressive start to his campaign as he outclassed American Amer Delic 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 to reach the second round. 

The 2001 champion, seeded 16, outplayed world No. 71 Delic in every department as he wrapped up victory in one hour 37 minutes. 

Hewitt, who reached the quarter-finals and semi-finals in back-to-back Masters Series events earlier this month, broke in the opening game of the match and never looked back. 

The Australian broke five times in all and now plays Argentine Agustin Calleri or Andreas Seppi of Italy.

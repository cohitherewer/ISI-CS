 Bopanna back in India squad

New Delhi: Top-ranked singles player Rohan Bopanna is back in the Indian Davis Cup squad for the Davis Cup Asia-Oceania group 1 tie against Kazakhstan from April 6-8. Bopanna had opted out of the tie versus Uzbekistan in February, saying he wanted to focus on doubles. 

According to an AITA release, the other members of the squad are Karan Rastogi, Divij Sharan and Sunil Kumar Sipaeya, besides captain Leander Paes. 

Nandan Bal and Sandeep Kirtane will accompany the squad as coaches for the tie in Almaty. (PTI)

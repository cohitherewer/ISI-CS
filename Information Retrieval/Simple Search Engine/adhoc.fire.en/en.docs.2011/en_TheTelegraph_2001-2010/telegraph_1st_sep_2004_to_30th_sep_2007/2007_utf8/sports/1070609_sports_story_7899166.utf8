Paris: The historians wanted it, the fans demanded it and Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal duly obliged on Friday by setting up another dream final at the French Open. 

Federer earned the chance to re-ignite the most intriguing rivalry in the sport when he wore down the dogged resilience of Nikolay Davydenko 7-5, 7-6, 7-6 in a three-hour duel. 

In the end, the Swiss maestro won only eight more points than the Russian fourth seed to march into an eighth successive Grand Slam final, breaking the all-time record he had shared with Australian Jack Crawford. 

It was a wonderful match, I could have lost in three sets but I won, Federer said courtside as he ran his fingers through his soaking hair. 

Nadal flexed his bulging biceps to flatten Serbian Novak Djokovic 7-5, 6-4, 6-2, taking his Roland Garros streak to 20-0. More significantly, it kept him in line to match Bjorn Borgs hattrick of trophies achieved in 1980. 

Sixth seed Djokovic had ridden on a wave of Serbian fervour to reach his first Grand Slam semi-final, doing so without facing a single player in the top 50. 

It did not take world No. 2 Nadal long to remind his rival that he belonged to a different league. 

Djokovic, at 20 the youngest of the four semi-finalists, once again donned his lucky yellow shirt but it could not save him from a mauling in the final set. 

After two sets of darting around like a wild boar, Djokovics sweat-streaked face told its own story, while Nadal shot menacing glares and completed his business with a fizzing forehand winner. 

Hes physically stronger than any other player, but Im young and my time will come, Djokovic said, after he lost his chance to become the first Serbian man to reach a major final. 

For the second year running, Federer will attempt to emulate American Don Budge and his hero Rod Laver by becoming only the third man to hold all four Grand Slam trophies at the same time. 

Twelve months ago, Federer came within two sets of achieving the feat until Nadal rudely broke the spell and reasserted his status as the best claycourter of his generation. 

But the Wimbledon, US Open and Australian Open champion pricked Nadals aura of invincibility when he snapped the Spaniards 81-match winning streak on clay in last months Hamburg Masters final and will be eager to replicate the feat. 

Last year I came out of the blocks very, very strong with a great first set but after that, I couldnt handle Nadal, said Federer, who is in pursuit of an 11th major. So I hope this years going to be different. 

On Friday, however, Federer was slow out of the blocks and had to claw his way back from a break down in each set.

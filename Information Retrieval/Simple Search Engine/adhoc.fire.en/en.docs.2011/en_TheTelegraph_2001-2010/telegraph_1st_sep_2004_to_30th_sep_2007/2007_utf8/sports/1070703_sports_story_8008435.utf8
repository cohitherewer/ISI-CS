 Dilip Sardesai passes away

Mumbai: Former Test cricketer Dilip 

 Sardesai, who was considered Indias best batsman against 

 spin bowling, died here on Monday of multiple-organ failure. 

Sardesai, 67, who was admitted to Bombay Hospital late last month with chest infection, was shifted to the Intensive Care Unit last night after he developed complications. His end came late this evening. 

Sardesai is survived by wife, son and noted television journalist Rajdeep, and a daughter, who is in the US. 

Suffering from kidney problems for a long time, he had been on dialysis and had been off-and-on in and out of hospital. 

Born on August 8, 1940 at Margao, Goa, Sardesai made his Test debut against England at Kanpur in December 1961 and played his last Test against the same team at Delhi in December 1972. 

During a career spanning 11 years, Sardesai played 30 Tests and scored 2001 runs in 55 innings with an average of 39.23 helped by a double century and four centuries.

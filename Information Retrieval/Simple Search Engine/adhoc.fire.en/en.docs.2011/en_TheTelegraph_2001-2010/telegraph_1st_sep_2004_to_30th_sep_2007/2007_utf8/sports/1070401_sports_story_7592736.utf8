 Dont think Bob knew much about fixing, says Cronjes brother

OWEN SLOT

 Bob Woolmer 

Frans Cronje, the brother of the late South Africa captain, Hansie, said on Sunday that he did not believe Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer was harbouring any information about gambling before his murder in Jamaica. 

Hansies career was brought to an abrupt end after revelations of his links to international bookmakers. Cronje said that his brother, who died in a plane crash five years ago, had hoped that the welter of negative publicity after his case would have served to eradicate match-fixing from the game. 

Frans and Woolmer, the former South Africa coach, remained in close contact after Hansies death and they last met in Cape Town a week before Woolmer left for the World Cup. 

Frans is producing a film about his brother and wanted the lead actor, Frank Rautenbach, to meet the coach. 

Id taken Frank to meet him, Frans said. I wanted Frank to hear first hand from Bob the nature of his relationship with Hansie. Bob just reiterated how close friends they were. He was looking quite good, quite healthy and I was surprised when we first heard it was a heart attack. 

We do not know at this stage about Bobs murder, but I dont think Bob knew much more about the links to the gambling world. He certainly never indicated as much. He said he was busy writing his book and that his main take on Hansie was that seven years after (the inquiry into Cronjes case), there was no evidence to suggest that there was anything left to come out. 

Ultimately, although there was a lot of pressure on Hansie, his desire was that the outcome of the investigation would bring the issue out into the open and bring an end to it. But, sadly, it is a massive industry and with the kind of fanaticism that you have in India and Pakistan, it is very hard to stamp out, Frans said.

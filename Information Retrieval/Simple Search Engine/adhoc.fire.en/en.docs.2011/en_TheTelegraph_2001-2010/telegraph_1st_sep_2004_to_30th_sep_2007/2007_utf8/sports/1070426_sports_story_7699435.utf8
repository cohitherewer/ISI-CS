 IMF paints a negative picture 

Bridgetown: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) foresees the net effect of the 2007 Cricket World Cup (CWC) as negative in the Caribbean region. 

The long-term net impact of CWC is unclear in light of the associated fiscal costs. The net effect of the CWC could well be negative in light of its heavy, fiscal costs and the already high public debt burdens in the region, says the IMF report. 

Indeed, the growing perception in the Caribbean is that the combine of International Cricket Council (ICC) and West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) and its incorporated subsidiary, CWC, West Indies, could have taken the Caribbean governments for a ride. Amid calls for due diligence and forensic audit of the management of CWC Inc., an independent probe is being urged by experts. 

Since the regions successful bid to host the historic event back in 1998, many things have gone wrong. 

The host agreement between WICB/CWC Inc. with the ICC was not shared with the Caricom governments till the hosting of the World Cup had become a virtual fait accompli for them. 

By the time Caricom representatives began demanding for the copy thanks to militancy of a few of their own attorney generals a fair bit of collective sovereignty of Caricom governments had already been undermined. 

No sooner the demands began gaining urgency, the ICC and CWC Inc. officials were ready to raise alarms about possible shift of World Cup 2007 to either South Africa or Australia. 

Experts feel it was an orchestrated strategy and some of Caricom governments fell for it. Overwhelmed as they were about the prospects and legacies of CWC 07, Caricom leaders had to settle to hope for the best. 

They had no option but to place too much faith in the competence and integrity of WICB/CWC Inc. negotiators with the ICC. 

They did not realise that South Africa and Australia probably could not have stepped in as a replacement. South Africa, through its president Thabo Mbeki had already offered support for Caricom and Australia too would have shrunk away if they had known that negotiations were not too transparent. 

The non-negotiable provisions of the host agreement: the host venue agreement and the all-embracing sunset legislation with its provisions governing ticketing, marketing and security arrangements. 

There is also anger among many West Indians who had to endure numerous restrictions for matches, including stadium entrance and departure; high-priced seating arrangements; and the deprivation of traditional musical instruments for entertainment. 

The Caricom governments may have tripped themselves when they failed to adopt a policy of unanimity rather than individual country bidding that would have given them a right to take care of all events, from the opening ceremony of the 2007 World Cup to the final, encompassing preliminaries, Super Eights and the semi-finals. 

As the post-mortem of CWC 07 gathers pace, attention is being drawn to demands by Lord MacLaurin, former chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, for a thorough, independent review of the structure and management of the ICC itself to ensure, as he said, that we really have the best people running world cricket. 

As of now, behind the stoic public stance of success and world class infrastructure, the Caricom governments are busy counting their losses and mounting debt, with no sight of tourism boom which it had foreseen.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A huge meet for me personally: Lara

Kingston: The West Indies captain and batting great Brian Lara predictably attracts the biggest headlines ahead of the World Cup in his own backyard. 

Lara, who turns 38 four days after the April 28 final, will be in his fifth and final World Cup. The left-hander remains a match-winner and will attract tactical preparation from opponents keen to counter his threat. 

But the West Indies quest for a first World Cup crown since back-to-back titles in 1975 and 1979 depends as much on Laras younger players. 

The West Indies shock success at the 2004 Champions Trophy gave notice of their potential. But that was followed by 15 losses and only two wins in 2005. 

Over the past 15 months, the team has again produced enough positive moments to encourage optimism from fanatical fans in the Caribbean. 

The teams spirited defence of its Champions Trophy title last November ended only in the final, which Australia won. 

I think I can safely say we have got the game to be among the top four teams. We are forming a very good team and are quietly confident about our capabilities, Lara said. 

Much of the recent improvement has come without the brilliance of Lara, who has gone two years without a one-day century. 

But Laras Test form is as prolific as ever and the flamboyant Trinidad-batsman relishes the big stage. There is none bigger than the World Cup in front of an expectant region. 

It is the last one-day tournament that I would be playing in so its huge for me personally, Lara said. 

It is also huge for the young team. Winning the ICC Champions Trophy in 2004 and getting to the final in 2006 shows that we have progressed in that department of the game. (AP)

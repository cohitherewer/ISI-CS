 Maria survives ugly duckling moments

Mark Hodgkinson

 Maria Sharapova in action on Tuesday 

Much of the pre-match publicity had centred around a heavily-pleated, all-white dress which she had talked of as being Swan Lake-inspired. But Maria Sharapovas opening round was not exactly as serene as a swan gliding across the water. She had to work, flap and splash a little on Tuesday. And, anyway, when was the last time a swan grunted like she does? 

So Sharapova, a former champion and the second seed, did not just have a clothes launch on Court One; she had a tennis match as well. Although it never once seemed as though the 20-year-old was going to lose, she did have more to do in the second set on the way to a 6-1, 7-5 defeat of Taiwans Yung-Jan Chan, an opponent who looked as though she gets all her outfits off the rail. 

My dress is Swan Lake-inspired, Sharapova had said. My coach saw it the other day, and he started feeding bread to it, so he got it. Still, Sharapova, for all her love of fashion, would not have minded having to scrap a little. She loves competition more than she loves new dresses. And you could tell that the match was closer in the second set just by listening to the soundtrack. It is when the Siberian starts to feel a bit more tense that she ups the volume of her shrieks, grunts and other assorted noises. She sounded less like a swan, more like an angry parakeet. 

One concern for Sharapova during the Wimbledon fortnight is what effect her sore shoulder will have on her serve. She certainly appeared to have taken some of the pace off her delivery against Chan. However, as she has said, she has never had a searing serve, so relying a bit more on placement probably has not hurt her overall game too much. 

Also, while Serena Williams was slightly irritated this week when her father, Richard, revealed that she had a slight hamstring problem, Sharapova has no problem with admitting that she is not fully fit. Still, she can hardly say otherwise, having been off the tour for a couple of months with the injury. 

Doctors said that it doesnt matter if I play on through it, Sharapova said on Tuesday. Some days I dont have confidence in my arm. In these conditions here, I might have to be on anti-inflammatory tablets, as the conditions here are cold, and the balls feel heavy. But I saw the doctors before I came here and they gave me the green light. But when Im not healthy, Im not happy. And its not good to go on court when youre not happy. 

Sharapova has patently been helped by the draw, as Serena Williams is in the other half, along with top seed Justine Henin. What is more, the grass of the All England Club is well-suited to her flat-hit shots, with the ball skidding through the back of the court. 

Sharapova could certainly do with a good Wimbledon, as she was thumped by Williams in the Australian Open final, and also soundly beaten by Ana Ivanovic in the semi-finals of Roland Garros. 

It was on Centre Court in 2004, when just 17, that Sharapova won her first Grand Slam title, wearing a simple dress. And then, in an Audrey Hepburn-inspired black cocktail dress everyone loves Breakfast at Tiffanys she added her second major at the US Open last season. 

While Sharapova the wannabe swan was amused to learn that swans are protected birds in England, she sounded a bit more alarmed when informed that the All England Club has a hawk to keep the pigeons away from the lawns. A hawk? Does the hawk want to bite a swan? Jesus, I might have to cut down on the pleats, she giggled. Despite appearances, Sharapova does not take herself too seriously.

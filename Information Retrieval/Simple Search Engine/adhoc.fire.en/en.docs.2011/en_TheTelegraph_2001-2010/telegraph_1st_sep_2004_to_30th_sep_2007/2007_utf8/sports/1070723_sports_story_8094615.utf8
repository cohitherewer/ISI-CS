 Flintoff to play for Lancashire

London: Englands star allrounder Andrew Flintoff, recuperating fast after ankle surgery, has been cleared by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to make his comeback for Lancashire on Tuesday. 

Flintoff will play as a specialist batsman for the clubs second XI against Derbyshire in Blackpool, but he is not yet ready to bowl. 

The 29-year-old, who is expected to play again before the end of the summer, is ahead of schedule in his rehabilitation work. 

Flintoff had suffered discomfort in his ankle during a championship game against Hampshire in early May. Although he played as a batsman in a Twenty20 Cup match against Yorkshire, it was decided an operation was the best option.

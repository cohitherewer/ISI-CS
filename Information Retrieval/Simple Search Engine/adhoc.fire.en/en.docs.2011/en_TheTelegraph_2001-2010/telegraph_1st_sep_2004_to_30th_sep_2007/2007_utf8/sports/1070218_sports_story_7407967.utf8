 Team India clinch series in style 

 - Yuvraj (95*), Sourav (58*), Uthappa (52) eclipse the only Silva lining in Lankan show 

 Chamara Silva plays a reverse sweep during his unbeaten 107 in Visakhapatnam on Saturday 

Visakhapatnam: Yuvraj Singh struck a breathtaking unbeaten 95 and Sourav Ganguly maintained his sequence of impressive scores with a timely 58 not out as India recorded an emphatic seven-wicket victory over Sri Lanka in the decisive one-dayer to clinch the series 2-1. 

Add to that Robin Uthappas blazing 37-ball 52 and Virender Sehwags 46 in which he showed signs of returning to form, and India must surely be pleased with the overall performance in their final ODI before the World Cup. 

After restricting Sri Lanka to 259 for seven, built around Man-of-the-Match Chamara Silvas maiden century, the Indians relied on a record unbroken 145-run fourth-wicket stand between Yuvraj and Sourav to overhaul the target with six overs to spare. 

Yuvraj, laid low by a knee injury for nearly three months, proved that he is well and truly back. After settling down, he smashed the Lankan bowlers all round the park during his 83-ball knock. 

It was the young Uthappa, however, who set the tempo. Sehwag also looked good before he threw away his wicket with some casual running between the wickets. 

The series triumph will serve as a morale booster for the hosts before going into the March-April mega event in the Caribbean, where they are clubbed with Sri Lanka in the preliminary stage. 

Asked to bat after a delayed start due to wet outfield, the Sri Lankans recovered from a top order collapse to post a competitive 259 for seven in the stipulated 47 overs with Silva doing the bulk of the scoring with an heroic unbeaten 107. 

The Indians had a solid start to their chase despite Sourav retiring with cramps in the very first over of the innings. 

Sehwag received some help from the Lankan bowlers who fed him short-pitched stuff with enough width and he creamed each of those to the boundary line.

Uthappa, at number three, was at his belligerent best and played a crucial role in laying the foundation before falling to Farveez Mahroof. 

Dinesh Karthik, coming in for the injured Sachin Tendulkar, did not last long and that brought Sourav back to the crease. 

Sehwag cut Lasith Malinga to third man and took a casual stroll half-way through his run. Worse still, he forgot the basic requirement of completing his run and started a mock batting practice at the non-strikers end. 

Wicketkeeper-batsman Kumar Sangakkara was alert to spot Sehwags carelessness and had all the time in the world to take the glove off one hand and aim a direct hit at the stumps. 

Yuvraj then joined Man of the Series Sourav in the middle and a fruitful association began, which saw the two southpaws complement each other with their range of shots. 

The Punjab batsman slammed 11 fours and three sixes to stamp his class while Sourav batted sensibly, farming the strike well while latching on to opportunities to play his favourite shots against the spinners. 

Earlier, twenty-seven-year old Silva justified his inclusion in place of Upul Tharanga by hitting a run-a-ball 107. 

Playing in his 14th ODI, Silva authored two vital partnerships, first a 68-run stand with Tillekeratne Dilshan (28) and then a 64-run association with Farveez Mahroof (28) after the Lankans were reduced to 56 for four and then 165 for six. 

The right-handed middle order batsman struck 12 fours and a six in his unbeaten knock. 

Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar picked two wickets but neither of them were economical. Sreesanth was even more profligate with one for 46 from eight overs. 

Attapattu and Sanath Jayasuriya gave Sri Lanka a solid start, making 42 runs of seven overs. He even hit Zaheer for a six over the mid-wicket and ensured a run-rate in excess of six an over. 

Silva and Dilshan avoided any risk and kept the scoreboard ticking with some sharp running between the wickets. The duo picked Harbhajan Singh for special treatment. 

Silva plundered two fours and a six for 17 runs in Harbhajans second over.

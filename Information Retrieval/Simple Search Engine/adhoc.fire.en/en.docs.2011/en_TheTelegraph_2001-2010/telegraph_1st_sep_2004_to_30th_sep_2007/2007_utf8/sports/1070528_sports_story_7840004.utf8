 Miandad throws hat in ring

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain and coach Javed Miandad is ready to give a serious thought to coaching the national team again if the cricket board offered him the job. 

Miandad, who has coached senior team on three separate terms but was removed acrimoniously on all occasions, said he had always kept national interest above everything else. 

It is a hypothetical question but I can only think about it if the offer comes to me. I have to think about various options if any offer comes through, he said. 

Miandad did not apply for the job, for which PCB had advertised in newspapers after the World Cup, keeping May 15 as the deadline to submit their applications. (PTI)

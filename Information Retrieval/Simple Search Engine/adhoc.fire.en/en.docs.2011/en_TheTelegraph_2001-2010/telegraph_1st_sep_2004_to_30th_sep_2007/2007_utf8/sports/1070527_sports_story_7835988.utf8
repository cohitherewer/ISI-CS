 Locke brothers killed in road accident

A CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: City jockey and trainer, David and Peter Locke, met with a fatal accident on Saturday morning near the Moulali crossing in Calcutta. 

According to a source, the brothers (both retired in 2001) were on a motorbike, with Peter riding pillion. A mini bus, coming from an opposite direction, hit the bike head-on after loosing control following a brake failure. 

Peter, elder of the two, died on the spot, while David succumbed to injuries soon after he was taken to a hospital. 

David had taken to horse riding at a young age. He had shifted his headquarters from the south about 25 years ago. Peter got his training licence two decades ago after a short stint as an assistant to trainer Arun Goenka.

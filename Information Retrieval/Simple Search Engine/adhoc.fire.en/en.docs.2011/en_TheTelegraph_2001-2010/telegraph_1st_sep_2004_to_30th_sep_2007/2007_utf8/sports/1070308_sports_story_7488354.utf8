 Ponting: A pretty reasonable job

Kingstown: Shane Watson passed his openers exam and Michael Clarke also starred with the bat to help Australia end their run of five losses ahead of the World Cup. 

With regular openers Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden watching on, Watson hit two sixes and nine fours in his 81 against Zimbabwe on Tuesday to renew debate about where he fits in batting order. 

Clarke hit six boundaries and a six in 81 balls to top-score with 82 as Australia reached 290 for seven before restricting Zimbabwe to 184 for seven. 

I thought we did a pretty reasonable job, Australia captain Ricky Ponting said. Our batting was pretty good in pretty difficult conditions and I thought our bowling was pretty good as well.

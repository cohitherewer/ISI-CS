The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its definitely my last Cup: Vaas

Port of Spain: Sri Lankas pace spearhead Chaminda Vaas says the ongoing World Cup would be the last time he would be seen on the games big stage although he intends to play at the international level a few more seasons. 

Its my fourth World Cup and definitely the last though I would continue to play for next two years, Vaas said. 

I performed well in the past two World Cups, especially in 2003. This time Im hoping to finish with some record against my name, said the left-arm seamer who has 313 and 371 wickets from 96 Tests and 290 ODIs under his belt. 

Longevity has been the hallmark of Vaas career and he admits his role has changed lately. 

Yes my role has changed. I no longer get the new ball and all I am looking to do is to bowl in right areas all the time. As for the secret of my longevity, I follow very simple routine. I want to do my basics, look after myself and train well. 

Vaas is confident the Sri Lankan team has the talent to fill his boots when he quits the game. 

Guys like Lasith Malinga are the future of Sri Lankan cricket. I feel he would be around for a number of years, he said. 

Vaas expected India to bounce back from their loss to Bangladesh. 

India will definitely bounce back. We have a great deal of respect for them. We need to be very careful. 

Another Sri Lankan cricketer playing his fourth World Cup, Marvan Atapattu, similarly wasnt willing to write India off. 

India started similarly badly in 2003 and then lost only in the finals after a couple of very good innings from the Australian batsmen. You cant write them off only because they have lost to Bangladesh.

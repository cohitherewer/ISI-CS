 Symonds back at nets 

Melbourne: Australias injury-plagued World Cup preparations received a shot in the arm after Andrew Symonds did his first net practice since rupturing his right bicep. 

Symonds had 10 minutes of batting practice with tennis balls, according to a daily. 

Symonds said he felt good during the brief session, which prompted the team management to postpone the medical examination of his arm by a day. 

Symonds is expected to face cricket balls by next week and start throwing within the next 15 days. 

He has been using the bat against resistance with a bit of tubing in the rooms, so today we thought we would get him out with a tennis ball, Australia physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said.

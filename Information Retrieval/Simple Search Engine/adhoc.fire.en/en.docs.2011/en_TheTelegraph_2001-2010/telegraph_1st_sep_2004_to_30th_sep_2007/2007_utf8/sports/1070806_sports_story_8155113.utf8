 An emotional race: Lewis 

Budapest: McLaren had a weekend full of contradictions at the Hungarian Grand Prix on Sunday. 

Lewis Hamilton won the race ahead of Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen, but only after the FIA punished his team by ironically putting him in the pole position. 

It was a very emotional race and an eventful weekend, Hamilton said. I just tried to keep a smile on my face and try to remain positive for everyone. 

With all the drama all weekend it would have been easy to lose focus. Its been a bit of a downer for the team. 

I learned a lot about my team. How strong they are and how they deal with all the distractions. I dont believe any other team could cope with it better. It is a tough time for the whole team. 

Asked about his relationship with Alonso, Hamilton said he continued to have respect for the Spaniard. 

He doesnt seem to have been speaking to me since yesterday, so I dont know if he has a problem, Hamilton said, adding he felt a big cloud over him during the race. 

It was difficult to stay focused because you had the feeling in the team that (McLaren) wont get any points and you didnt know whether the team hated you, (or) they just hated the situation. 

Alonso wanted to stay away from the situation, and he left the paddock area quickly after the race. 

His team issued a statement quoting him as saying, Without the penalty... victory would have been possible today as you can see on my lap times when I had a clear track. ...The fight for the championship is still open. 

The British team admitted on Sunday that tensions were undeniably high during the qualifying session but said it did not believe the sanctions were appropriate. 

With six races remaining, McLaren will have their hands full managing the two best drivers so far of the 2007 season. (AP)

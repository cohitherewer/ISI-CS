 Chowrasia in sole lead

Gurgaon: Armed with a tweaked putter, SSP Chowrasia soared to the lead with a sizzling opening round of seven-under 65 in the Colour Plus Open at the Golden Greens Golf and Country club here on Thursday. 

Trailing Chowrasia, one stroke behind, was Ashok Kumar, the man who has been on fire this season with four titles in seven starts, after a round that was studded with seven birdies and an eagle, as against three bogeys. 

Digvijay Singh (67), Shiv Prakash (68) and C. Muniyappa (69) followed Ashok in that order. 

Chowrasia attributed the birdie binge to his red hot putter and said, I was having some problems with my putter. In Koh Samui on Asian Tours Bangkok Airways Open, I seemed to be set for a good finish, but putter let me down. 

So, here before this event I got my putters face adjusted by about two degrees. It is a soft face and had off balance. And when the club-fitter did it up, it putted beautifully. (PTI)

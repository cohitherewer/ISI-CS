 Bagan unlikely to send players for Goa camp 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Plagued by injuries to key players, including Bhaichung Bhutia and Jose Ramirez Barreto, Mohun Bagan are unlikely to release players for the pre-Olympic qualifying camp, starting in Goa on Monday. 

They are going to write a letter to the AIFF informing them of their inability to send the players for the camp because of their AFC Cup engagement on Tuesday. 

Several players have been plagued by injuries. If we send some of our important players to the national camp, how will we play the AFC Cup match? asked a club official. 

Mohun Bagan will kick off their AFC Cup campaign against Tampines Rover of Singapore here on Tuesday. 

Jose Ramirez Barreto suffered a hamstring injury against East Bengal last Tuesday and has been ruled out for at least six weeks. 

Meanwhile, the club has contacted the AFC for Douglas da Silvas registration. The Brazilian signed for Mohun Bagan on Wednesday.

 New look for Maradona 

Bogota: Diego Maradona last month visited a clinic in Colombia to iron out some wrinkles and shrink his double chin, a doctor said. 

Maradona arrived in Bogota on August 28 to undergo what his personal doctor, Alfredo Cahe, at the time said was aesthetic dental work. 

The 46-year-old former player took advantage of his stay to also undergo other procedures and lose a few years, a Colombian doctor who worked on the star said. (AFP)

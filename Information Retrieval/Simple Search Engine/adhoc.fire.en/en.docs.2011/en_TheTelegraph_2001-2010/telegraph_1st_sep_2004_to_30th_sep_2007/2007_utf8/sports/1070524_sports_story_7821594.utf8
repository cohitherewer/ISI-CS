 Federer can win French: Sampras

 - Titans to clash in November 

 For us to face each other while I 

 am still young enough to play competitively is truly 

 special

 PETE SAMPRAS

Kuala Lumpur: World No. 1 Roger Federer will play Pete Sampras in an exhibition match in Kuala Lumpur in November to celebrate Malaysias 50th year of independence, organisers said on Wednesday. 

Swiss Federer, who trails the Americans record of 14 Grand Slam titles by four, will take on the 35-year-old former world No. 1 in a match billed as the Clash of the Times. 

I hold the record for most Grand Slam titles ever, but I am confident that Roger will break that record some day, Sampras said in a statement. 

For us to face each other while I am still young enough to play very competitively is truly special. Having this take place in Asia is remarkable for tennis, he said. 

Federer and Sampras faced each other just once on the ATP Tour when the Swiss won a five-set match in the fourth round at Wimbledon in 2001 to end the Americans 31-match unbeaten run at the All England Club. 

To play against Pete is a dream come true, Federer said in a statement. I am so excited and really looking forward to visiting Malaysia for the first time. 

Sampras tipped Federer to win the French Open. 

I think Roger has a good shot at winning the French, there is no reason why he cant, Sampras said. 

He just proved that he can beat (Rafael) Nadal on clay, he just beat him the other day. 

 To play against Pete is a dream come 

 true. I am so excited and really looking forward to 

 Malaysia

 ROGER FEDERER

Federer ended the Spaniards record-breaking 81-match winning streak on clay by beating him 2-6, 6-2, 6-0 on Sunday at the Hamburg Masters, boosting his confidence ahead of Roland Garros which starts on Sunday. 

If he wins in Paris, Federer will become the first player since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four Grand Slams at the same time. 

Nadal has had a great run and probably just ran into a wall in Hamburg, said Sampras. 

While Nadal is seen as Federers main threat, Sampras pointed out that there were others to watch. He named Russias Nikolay Davydenko as among the dangerous players.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pereira blames it on midfield

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: East Bengal coach Carlos Roberto Pereira, not particularly happy with his wards show against Dempo, looked more worried about the injuries suffered by a couple of important players. I dont think they (Covan Lawrence and Alvito DCunha) will be able to play against Mohun Bagan, but I am not a doctor and so, coach Pereira said at the post-match media conference in Barasat. 

Pereira admitted that his midfield got a big jolt after DCunha had to leave the ground for calf-muscle injury. Our midfielders couldnt play well and I got a jolt when two replacements had to be made in quick succession. So I delayed bringing in Ashim Biswas, which could have fetched results, Perreira said. 

The coach had a lot of praise for Shylo Malsawmtluanga, who had a good day in office, while operating from the left. Mama played a good match, and we had our chances to score, but failed to latch onto those chances, he said, adding that he wasnt happy with the goalless draw. 

On the other hand, Dempo coach Armando Colaco praised the East Bengal side as well as the Kenyan recruit Boniface Ambani. East Bengal are a strong side, which was evident from the fact that even with two player off the field, they still managed a goalless draw, Colaco said. 

Regarding Boniface, the Dempo coach said: He is a complete footballer and will give East Bengal the support they need up front all through the seasonHe is brilliant.

 Beckham will be a huge influence: Mourinho

Jose Mourinhos eclipse was total in the face of the David Beckham show, but the Chelsea manager had the good grace to predict that the influence of such an iconic figure could be an inspiration to the Los Angeles Galaxy. 

Technically, Mourinho was within his rights to make the story less about Beckham and more about his successor as England captain, John Terry, whose left-footed strike ensured a third and final victory in Chelseas pre-season American tour. But the Portuguese is a man of acute sensitivities, and he knew greater forces were at work. 

For once, the photographers blanked Mourinho as they jostled for a fresh angle on Beckham, perched on the end of the substitutes bench. Amid the pandemonium, the manager could perceive a long-term benefit. Football is about motivation, about intensity, he said. 

For these players who are not of a high level, playing with Beckham at their side in sold-out stadiums, with a great atmosphere and a red carpet, must be a motivation. 

Beckham will not only be a fellow player, he will be a big inspiration for them. He performed for 10 years in Europe at a very high and difficult level, so I imagine it will be very easy for him to help Americans fall in love with the game. That is what everybody is waiting for. 

Frank Yallop, the Galaxys embattled coach, has to hope that the wait is not too long. Pressure on his position mounts with every suggestion that Beckham needs a mentor of the stature of Fabio Capello, but he could feel only relief that the club had not been disgraced by Chelsea. 

After the ridicule he had endured for the teams feeble surrender to UANL Tigres last week, a 0-1 defeat to Mourinhos true galaxy of talents felt almost like a win. Im very happy with the way they played, with their determination, Yallop said. Davids first game it has been looming for a while, but its over. Now we try to settle down and build. 

That building process takes Beckham to the SuperLiga tournament next, and to a match on Saturday against CD Guadalajara in the crucible of LAs Memorial Coliseum. 

Beckham is fortunate to be a candidate for that game at all, after his debut was nearly derailed by an agricultural tackle from Chelseas latest midfield recruit, Steve Sidwell. Denying that he had tried to nail his more celebrated opponent, Sidwell said: It could have been worse. It was just like any other challenge for me I went into it fully committed. When he went down and stayed down, there was a slight skip of my heartbeat, but we have come here to win the game.

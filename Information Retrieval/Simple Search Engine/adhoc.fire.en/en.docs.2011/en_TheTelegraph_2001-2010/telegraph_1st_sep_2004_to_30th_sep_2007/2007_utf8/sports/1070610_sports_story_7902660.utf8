 Atwal set to miss cut 

Memphis: The prospect of missing another cut loomed large as Arjun Atwal was stranded with four more holes to go after darkness stopped play in the second round at the Stanford St Jude Championship. 

As many as 26 players were yet to finish their second round and the Indian was struggling at seven-over through 14 holes. 

After his opening round of three-over 73, Atwal needed to raise his game in the second and hang out for weekend action. But a birdie eluded him throughout the 14 holes and all he had to show was the double bogey on the second and bogeys on 12th and 14th holes.

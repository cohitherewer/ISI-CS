 Irina, Meghna end tied 4th

 Irina Brar 

Gurgaon: Irina Brar secured her first international top-10 finish as a professional when she ended tied fourth at the inaugural $ 100,000 DLF Womens Indian Open here on Friday. Chinese Taipeis Tseng Ya Ni clinched the title. 

Irina shot 71 and totalled four-over 220, largely because of the disastrous second round of 79. Sharing the tied fourth place, but not entitled to any money was amateur Meghna Bal (78), who played to a six-over 78 for a tally of four-over 220. Thailands Titiya Plucksataporn was also tied fourth. 

Irina can take comfort from the fact that she can indeed compete with the best in Asia and this result will go a long way in improving her confidence. She earlier finished tied 18th in Hong Kong and tied 35th in Thailand. 

Smriti Mehra was tied 17th after a final round of 78. Her earlier two rounds were 74 and 76. The only other Indian to make the cut, Parneeta Grewal, was tied 48th after a final round of 82 with first two rounds being 79 and 79. She totalled 24-over 240. 

Having turned pro 80 days ago, Ya Ni clinched her maiden ladies Asian Golf Tour title beating Thailands Russamee Gulynamitta in the first play-off hole. The two players finished regulation play tied at one-under 215. Ya Ni ended her final round with a three-over 75 and Russamee finished with a two-over 74. (PTI)

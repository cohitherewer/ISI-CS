 EURO UPDATE

 Interpol after Tevez agent 

 London: 

 The Carlos Tevez affair took another twist after the Argentines 

 representative, the Anglo-Iranian businessman Kia Joorabchian, 

 was put under the order of overseas arrest by a Brazilian 

 judge over allegations of money-laundering. The warrant 

 was said to relate to an investigation at Brazilian club 

 Corinthians, in which Joorabchians company, MSI, is 

 a major investor. Brazilian judge Fausto Martin de Sanctis 

 ordered the overseas arrest of Joorabchian, Russian tycoon 

 Boris Berezovsky and Nojan Bedroud, an MSI director. 

 Winning start 

 Doncaster: Sven-Goran Eriksson 

 made a successful return to management on Saturday with 

 Manchester City rallying to beat Doncaster Rovers 3-1 in 

 a pre-season friendly. Bernardo Corradi, Micah Richards 

 and Emile Mpenza scored a goal each to spare Eriksson an 

 early setback after the League One side led at half-time. 

 Very good Im happy. Its been a long 

 time since I was sitting on a football bench, Eriksson 

 said. 

 Saviola gesture

 Madrid: Argentina striker 

 Javier Saviola said on Friday that a vote of confidence 

 from Real Madrids new coach Bernd Schuster had been 

 a key factor in his decision to join the Spanish champions. 

 The 25-year-old refused a contract extension at Barcelona 

 to make the move to their number one rivals, after having 

 dropped out of favour since the arrival of coach Frank Rijkaard 

 in 2003.

 Ayala for Zaragoza

 Madrid: Real Zaragoza have 

 agreed a deal to sign Argentina centre-back Roberto Ayala 

 from Villarreal, the Primera Liga club said on Saturday. 

 The 34-year-old, who is playing for Argentina at the Copa 

 America, had agreed a move to Villarreal back in February 

 for when his contract with Valencia ended in June.

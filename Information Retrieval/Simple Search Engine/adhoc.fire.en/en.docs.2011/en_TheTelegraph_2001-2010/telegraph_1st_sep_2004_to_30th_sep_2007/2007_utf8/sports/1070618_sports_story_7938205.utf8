 Pak boards nod to foreigners

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) presented its Rs 2.4 billion annual budget on Sunday and announced other decisions aimed at improving the domestic and international set-up after an ad-hoc committee meeting in Bhurban. 

PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf said that most of the money would be spent on development work and salaries of players to raise the standard of domestic cricket. 

We will also encourage regional teams to sign overseas players from India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh and subsidise their costs so that there is interest in domestic cricket and the level of competition improves, he said. 

The committee also approved the new central contracts system under which performance, discipline and fitness have been given more importance over seniority. 

The decision comes after the board suspended the central contracts of all players in the wake of the team being eliminated in the first round of the World Cup. Ashraf said the contracts would be awarded to 20 players from a shortlist of 30 to be recommended by the selectors. 

Earlier, seniority was the main criterion for awarding these contracts. Now 40 per cent weightage would be given to performances of players in the last 12 months, 20 per cent for seniority, 20 per cent for fitness and 20 per cent for discipline. 

Dr Ashraf also said that said Australian Richard Done was interviewed on Sunday for the coachs job and that Dav Whatmore and Geoff Lawson, the other two in reckoning, would be quizzed during the coming week. (PTI)

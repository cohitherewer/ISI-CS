 Pak amass 351/4

 - SECOND ONE-DAY INTERNATIONAL 

Durban: Mohammed Yousuf led a sensational display by Pakistan batsmen in the second one-day International against South Africa in Durban on Wednesday. 

Yousuf top-scored with unbeaten 101 as Pakistan totalled a record 351 for four after winning the toss and choosing to bat. 

Pakistans previous highest total against South Africa was 335 for six, which they scored in Port Elizabeth in 2002-03. 

Other meaty contributions came from Younis Khan, who scored 93, Shahid Afridi, unbeaten 77, and Imran Nazir, who made 57. 

Yousuf faced 111 balls and hit 12 fours in a relatively measured innings that contrasted sharply with the frenetic batting of some of his teammates. 

The free-scoring Afridi reached his half-century off 20 balls, while Nazir, who played his first one-day International since July 2004, passed 50 in 32 balls. 

In all, Afridi faced 35 balls and hit five fours and six sixes. 

Younis and Yousuf kept Pakistan on top with a stand that reached 124 before Younis lofted one of Graeme Smiths off-spinners to long-on, where Langeveldt took the catch. 

South Africa enjoyed a brief respite when Herschelle Gibbs ran out Inzamam-ul Haq for 13 in the 39th over, but Yousuf and Afridi were soon spraying shots to all parts of the ground.

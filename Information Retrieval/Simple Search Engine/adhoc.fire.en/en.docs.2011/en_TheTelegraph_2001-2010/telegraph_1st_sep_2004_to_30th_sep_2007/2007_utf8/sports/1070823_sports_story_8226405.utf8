 England played the perfect game: Dravid

A CORRESPONDENT

Southampton: Team India captain Rahul Dravid did not want to offer any excuses for the defeat in the opening one-dayer and blamed it on a disappointing performance. 

No excuses We were outplayed today. All credit to England who played the perfect game. They really batted well, two guys went on to score hundreds That is exactly you want. They then bowled well upfront with the new ball which is important in these conditions, Dravid said. 

The Indian bowlers struggled to take wickets after Dravid opted to bowl in overcast conditions as England went on to score 288 for 2. The visitors were bundled out for 184 to suffer a 104-run loss in the day and night match. 

We did not take wickets upfront, and we also conceded a lot runs in the middle overs Englands score was very good. If you want to chase such a big total you need a good start, but we lost four wickets early on to make things difficult. 

It was not so tough to bat on, but they bowled very well. Andersons spell was important as he bowled in the right areas, found the right line and length from the outset. Flintoff also looked good. Obviously, when you lose four wickets in the beginning it is not going to be easy, he said. 

Dravid felt the bowling needed to improve and defended his decision to field first. We bowled well in the first 20 overs, but credit to the English batsmen They did not lose wickets at that stage and that helped them in the middle overs. Our spinners and part time bowlers could not stop them. 

Dravid also said his players needed to improve their fielding and be more careful in their running between the wickets. Its an area weve got to try to improve. On big grounds like this, we are not overnight going to get strong arms and big throws. Not making mistakes in running between the wickets thats something we can definitely control and work on.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dempo leaders in money game too

- Players rsquo; salaries shoot up

New Delhi: Indian football is going nowhere. 

The fare dished out at the domestic level is driving fans away, as is clear from the falling attendance in the National Football League (NFL). Our world ranking has dropped to 165. 

These negatives havent, however, affected the footballers. If club sources are to be believed, salaries of most top Indian players are set for a quantum jump in the season about to commence. 

For the first time, there could be more than 20 Indian players with annual pay packets in excess of Rs 15 lakh. Last season, only half a dozen players had earned 15 lakh or more. 

Calcutta, no longer the hub of Indian football, has taken a backseat in the money game as well. Goa and Mumbai are the frontrunners, reflecting their dominance in Indian football. 

NFL champions Dempo, with a budget of about Rs 4 crore, are the undisputed leaders. Mahindra United are not lagging too far behind. 

Last season, there was only one Indian player in Goa Climax Lawrence who commanded a payment of over Rs 15 lakh. The next season will see 12 in that elite category, eight of them from Dempo. 

The biggest earner is likely to be Mahesh Gawli, who is reportedly being paid a whopping Rs 35 lakh by Dempo to lure him from Mahindra. 

Dempos high-salaried list includes juniors like Balirian Rebello, Satish Kumar and Riston Rodrigues. 

Srinivas Dempos explanation was simple. We have to do it to retain our winning combination, said the Dempo boss. 

Mahindra United could lose players like S. Venkatesh and N.S. Manju to Mohun Bagan despite offering more than Rs 20 lakh to both. 

This is simply too much, said Mahindra manager Henry Menezes. 

Whatever Menezes has to say, Mahindra too are paying exorbitant money to retain players like N.P. Pradeep, Steven Dias, Sandip Nandy and K. Ajayan. Sporting Clube de Goa have three players in the 15-lakh bracket. 

SET TO EARN rs 15 LAKH OR MORE

DEMPO: Mahesh Gawli (from Mahindra), Samir Naik, John Dias, Climax Lawrence, Clifford Miranda, Balirian Rebello, Satish Kumar, Riston Rodrigues

 MAHINDRA: N.P. Pradeep, Steven Dias, Sandip Nandy, K. Ajayan

 SPORTING CLUBE DE GOA: Micky Fernandes (from Salgaocar), Bibiano Fernandes (from East Bengal), Philip Gomes

 CHURCHILL BROTHERS: Chandam Chitrasen

 EAST BENGAL: Alvito D rsquo;Cunha

 MOHUN BAGAN: Bhaichung Bhutia

 Note: Five others mdash; S. Venkatesh, N.S. Manju (both Mahindra), Mehrajuddin Wadao, Mehtab Hussain (both Mohun Bagan) and Habibur Rehman (Mohammedan Sporting) mdash; have got offers of Rs 15 lakh or more, but are yet to decide which club to play for

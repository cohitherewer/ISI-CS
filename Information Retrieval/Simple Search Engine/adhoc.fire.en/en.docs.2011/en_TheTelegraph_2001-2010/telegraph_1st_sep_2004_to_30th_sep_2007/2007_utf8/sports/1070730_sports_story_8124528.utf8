 Shiv ends joint 37th

Hamburg: Shiv Kapur carded a one-over 73 in the final round of the Deutsche Bank Players Championship of Europe at the Gut Kaden course in Alveslohe on Sunday. 

Three birdies on the front nine were negated by four bogeys on the back to leave the Indian at seven over 281 for the tournament. 

He was joined in tied 37th place by Irishmen Peter Lawrie (70) and Paul McGinley (70). 

The Indian had been in contention for a top-10 finish after returning a two-under 70 to be tied at 15th place on Saturday. Jeev Milkha Singh and Jyoti Randhawa had missed the cut. 

Argentinas Andres Romero claimed his maiden European Tour title after closing with a two-under 70 to total 19-under 269, three strokes better than Denmarks Soren Hansen and Briton Oliver Wilson. (Agencies)

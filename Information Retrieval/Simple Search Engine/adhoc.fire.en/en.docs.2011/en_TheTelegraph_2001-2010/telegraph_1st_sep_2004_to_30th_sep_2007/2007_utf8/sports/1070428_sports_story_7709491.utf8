The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sri Lankan bowlers have to win the mind battle 

Fast Track

Courtney Walsh

How does one keep Australia quiet? One would have expected South Africa to have an answer to that question, but Graeme Smiths men were obviously clueless against the Aussies in St Lucia. 

The problem for teams other than Australia, that is throughout this tournament has been that the Aussie top-order, notably Ricky Ponting and Matthew Hayden, have been so destructive and dazzling that very few bowlers have had a chance to look beyond them and have a go at the relatively under-exposed middle-order. 

At the start of the World Cup, before a single game had been played, my view was that Australia would be the team to beat despite what the rankings said. While I am happy to have my views borne out, I dont obviously think that Australia cannot be beaten. Like every other team, I am sure Pontings men too feel pressure, only the opposition must overcome the sense of awe that has seemingly gripped every team in this tournament every time it has played Australia. 

For a start, from a bowlers point of view, I would like to see Hayden cramped for room. Almost every bowler that he has faced has been guilty of giving him far too much room to play his shots, and I would guess that this waywardness is born out of panic at facing a powerhouse like Australia. The trick when bowling to Hayden would be to stick to basics, as exemplified by Glenn McGrath, and explore that area in and around the off-stump on a regular basis. 

Of course, Ponting and Hayden are two of the worlds best batsmen now, and I would not for a moment suggest that it would be easy to bowl at them, no matter how skilled the bowler is. However, it is easy to get intimidated by their power-hitting approach to batting, and the Sri Lankans must keep their heads in Barbados today. I believe the Lankan bowlers particularly Chaminda Vaas and Lasith Malinga have the skill to apply pressure on the premier Australian batsmen, but the battle will be fought principally in the mind. 

The Australians are past masters at intimidation and consider it an important part of their on-field strategy. Given his size and strength, Hayden is the perfect embodiment of power cricket, but I have been really impressed by the canny way in which Sri Lanka have planned their progress. 

Along the way, their bowlers have also shown nerves of steel, and unlike the South Africans, will not be putting undue pressure on themselves by announcing their intentions to go after a particular batsman. 

I would say Hayden is still vulnerable to the ball moving in, which creates the ghost of a chance of an LBW decision. When the ball moves in, a batsman can only meet it with half a bat, which in turn means the drives are sliced through point and result in catches in the slips cordon. 

I would love to see Vaas in particular create such opportunities, because he is crafty and experienced enough not to panic in the face of an onslaught. And he can lead the charge of the younger bowlers, who must surely fancy themselves in with a chance if Hayden and Ponting depart early.

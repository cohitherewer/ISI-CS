The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 International cricket doesnt begin or end with one series: Dravid

 - Its very sad For this to happen on somebodys first tour We feel for Tiwary 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Dhaka: Thanks to the unusual happenings in recent weeks, theres much riding on Team Indias tour of Bangladesh. And, so, its unlikely that captain Rahul Dravid will have many quiet moments to himself. On Wednesday morning, he interacted with the media and, then, briefly spoke to The Telegraph separately. 

The following are excerpts 

On the sting operation by a TV channel back home 

Im not going to react to sting operations...

 I got as much support as I could (from teammates) during the World Cup... I

 was happy with the team I had. 

On everything that has happened after Indias

 shock first-round exit in the World Cup 

I step back and see things in perspective... Thats how I play my cricket... I suppose its

 part and parcel of the game... 

On whether the contracts issue is a distraction 

No... Theres a simple formula for us players we love the game and want to play it. Its not that the boys are constantly thinking (about the contracts)... Were

 focused on cricket... What needs to be taken care of will be taken care of. 

On the spirit within the team 

What happened in the World Cup was disappointing,

 but the spirit is back... The spirit was good during the conditioning camp

 in Calcutta and its good here. 

On the focus still being on Indias

 poor World Cup performance 

I dont look at just one tournament or event... International cricket doesnt begin or end with one series... Its

 an ongoing process... 

On Ravi Shastris appointment as (interim)

 cricket manager 

As he himself told us, there cant be magic in a few days... Hes very experienced and has a lot of knowledge... Has played a lot and has been doing commentary for years... He has been sharing knowledge... These are still early days... However, coaches cant

 play and players have to stand up and take responsibility. 

On Venkatesh Prasad and Robin Singh being part of the support staff 

Its about preparing the boys in a manner that the best is got out of them... One cant suddenly change the way one plays. The support staffs work isnt

 rocket science. 

On rookie Manoj Tiwary being ruled out of the ODIs 

Its very sad... For this to happen on somebodys first tour... We feel for him... He has the Board and the teams support... Of course, hes

 young and is going to get opportunities... Right now, he has to focus on recovering...

 He has accepted the situation in a mature manner. 

On his one-on-one with Tiwary 

I said hes young and is in good hands (physio

 John Gloster)... I added that he must remain positive and work towards getting

 fit. I like his attitude. 

On Bangladesh 

Theyve done well in the World Cup... Now, weve

 got more first-hand information about their players... 

On explosive opener Tamim Iqbal 

Hes good... He played well (a dashing 51) against us in the World Cup and took us by surprise... If its

 his day, he could play another innings like that or we could get him (quickly). 

Finally, on Brian Laras comment that Rahul

 Dravid is the one player I could go and watch. Come to think of it, if I

 wanted someone batting for my life, it would be Rahul 

(Smiles) Im honoured... Thats all.

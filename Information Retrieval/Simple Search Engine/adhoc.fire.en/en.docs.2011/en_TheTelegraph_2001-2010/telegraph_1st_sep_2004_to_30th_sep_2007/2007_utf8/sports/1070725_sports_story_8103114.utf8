Hanoi/ Kuala Lumpur: Japan coach Ivica Osim is eyeing an positive outing against their Asian Cup semi-final opponents, Saudi Arabia on Wednesday. 

According to Osim, Saudi Arabia are a very dangerous team. They play very aggressive, modern football. Our players are tired so it is conceivable we could get knocked out. 

The defending champions beat Saudi Arabia 1-0 in the 1992 final on home soil and again by the same score in the 2000 final in Beirut. 

I dont want to talk about the past history between the teams. I only want to talk about tomorrows game, shrugged Osim, before triggering a roar of laughter by adding: If you talk about tomorrows match its important to remember the history between the two teams. 

Meanwhile, a hectic travel schedule has left Saudi Arabias players struggling to shake off the effects of jet-lag ahead of Wednesdays semi-final. Their Brazilian coach Helio Cesar dos Anjos claimed the gruelling travel arrangements had handed Japan an unfair advantage heading into Wednesdays match. 

Saudi Arabia spent the whole of Monday travelling from Indonesia to Vietnam after their quarter final win over Uzbekistan in Jakarta on Sunday night. 

This is a problem but we cannot use this as en excuse. We just have to get out there and play the game. 

Saudi Arabia won the title in 1984, 1988 and 1996 while Japan were crowned champions in 1992, 2000 and 2004, beating the Saudis in the first two of those finals. 

In the other semi-final on Wednesday, Iraq will meet South Korea. Iraqi goalkeeper Noor Sabri Abbas is delighted that the teams surprise run to the Asian Cup semi-finals has helped lift the spirits of his beleaguered compatriots back home. 

As you know, the situation is critical in Iraq, Abbas told reporters on Tuesday. We have been keeping in touch with friends and relatives and everybody is celebrating the fact that we are in the semi-finals. 

We have a really good chance to make history for Iraqi football and the whole country is behind us. 

On the other hand, Dutchman Pim Verbeek took a gentle swipe at the South Korean media on Tuesday after his tactics came under scrutiny ahead of the Asian Cup semi-final against Iraq.

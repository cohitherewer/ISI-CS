 Title for Team Bhupathi 

New Delhi: Mahesh Bhupathi and his Czech partner Pavel Vizner knocked over top seeds Bob and Mike Bryan on Saturday to enter the final of the $2,200,000 Montreal Masters. 

The eighth seeds edged past the American twins 6-2, 4-6, 12-10 in a thriller which lasted an hour and seven minutes. 

The Indo-Czech pair had to save two match-points in the super tie-breaker on way to the summit clash against fifth seeds Paul Hanley and Kevin Ullyett, who defeated sixth-seeded Israelis Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram 6-2, 6-3 in the other semi-final. 

Bhupathi and Vizner dominated the opening set. They put a lot of pressure on the Americans serves and capitalised on two of the seven break-points that came their way. 

The second set was a close affair, with the Bryans using the only break- point they got. Bhupathi and Vizner held their nerves in the 22-point super tie-breaker. They saved consecutive match points at 7-9 and levelled scores at 10-all. Bhupathi and Vizner won the next two points to seal a spot in the final. (PTI) 

Bhupathi and Vizner captured the doubles title with a 6-4, 6-4 win over Ullyett and Hanley on Sunday.

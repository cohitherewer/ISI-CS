The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Aussie giants hope to spike the rest

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Aussies are in town with a bunch of towering players, none of whom is less than six and a half foot tall. They obviously dont belong to Ricky Pontings team of world beaters. Its the volleyball team which is here to take part in the second Commonwealth meet beginning at the Netaji Indoor Stadium on Saturday. 

Australia and volleyball? Sounds anything but a perfect pair, especially in this part of the world where we only associate them with cricket. The fact of the matter, though, is that the Aussie spikers did compete in the last two Olympic Games (Sydney and Athens). 

Volleyball is not a big sport in Australia at the senior level, its popular till the high school level, said the teams head coach Russell Borgeaud. 

It was only after volleyball came under the Australian Institute of Sport banner in 1990 that the sport gained some momentum. 

The top players all train at the Institute in Canberra. Theres no professional league in our country, so the target of our volleyballers is to play in Europe, said Borgeaud, who has been in charge of the national team since 2005. 

Eleven members of the squad, which landed in Calcutta on Thursday, play in different European leagues, while one is with a US college team. 

The coach will be happy if his boys can produce their best in Calcutta. India, Canada and even Pakistan will be tough opponents But if we play to potential, we can win this tournament, said Borgeaud. 

The ultimate target, though, is to qualify for the Beijing Olympics.

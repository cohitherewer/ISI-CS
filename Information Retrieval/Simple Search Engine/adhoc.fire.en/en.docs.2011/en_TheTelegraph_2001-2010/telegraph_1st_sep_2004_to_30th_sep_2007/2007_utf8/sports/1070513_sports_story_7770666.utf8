 Randhawa extends lead

Gurgaon: Boosted by a birdie spree, Shiv Kapur leapt to second spot but Jyoti Randhawa strengthened his hold on the title by extending his sole lead on Saturday, the penultimate day of the Rs 65 lakh-DLF Masters golf tournament. 

After an amazing run on the first two days, Randhawa returned a card of one-under 71 that put him at 13-under overall and a six-stroke cushion over Kapur, going into the final day. 

Kapur, coming into the tournament after a months injury-induced lay-off, found his touch to fire a six-under 66, which catapulted him from tied-11th to lone second position at seven-under 209.

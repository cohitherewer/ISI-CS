 Muralidharan, Vaas get a break

 ODI series vs India 

Colombo: Sri Lanka have rested senior bowlers Muttiah Muralidharan and Chaminda Vaas for the four-match ODI series against India in February. 

The selectors offered the pair, the most successful bowlers in Sri Lankas one-day International history, an opportunity to rest because both have niggling injuries. 

Sri Lanka have recalled left-arm fast bowler Nuwan Zoysa, leg-spinning allrounder Upul Chandana, middle-order batsman Russel Arnold and mediumpacer Nuwan Kulasekera to a 15-man squad for the series. 

Batsman Chamara Kapugedera has been axed following the New Zealand tour but will remain on standby in case one of the eight specialist batsmen gets injured. 

Seam bowlers Ruchira Perera and Akalanka Ganegama were also dropped after the drawn series with the Black Caps. 

The India series, Sri Lankas last before the World Cup, starts in Pune on February 8 and finishes at Visakhapatnam on February 17. 

THE SQUAD 

Mahela Jayawardene (captain), Kumar Sangakkara, Sanath Jayasuriya, Upul Tharanga, Maravan Atapattu, Tillekeratne Dilshan, Chamara Silva, Russel Arnold, Upul Chandana, Farveez Mahroof, Lasith Malinga, Dilhara Fernando, Malinga Bandara, Nuwan Zoysa, Nuwan Kulasekera. 

 Reserves: Chamara Kapugedera, Akalanka Ganegama, Kaushal Lokuarachchi.

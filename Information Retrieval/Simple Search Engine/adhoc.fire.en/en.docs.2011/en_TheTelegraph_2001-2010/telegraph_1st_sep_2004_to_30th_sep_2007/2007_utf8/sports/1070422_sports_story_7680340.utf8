A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Kapil Dev, who is the National Cricket Association (NCA) chairman, will visit the Zonal Cricket Academy (under-19 camp) being held at the Eden from Friday. The former India captain will be there on Tuesday and Wednesday, said a CAB source. 

East Zones chief coach Balwinder Singh Sandhu could not join the camp because of illness. Former Bengal mediumpacer Dattatreya Mukherjee will replace Sandhu. 

He (Sandhu) was to arrive on Friday, but only today we came to know about his illness. So weve decided to call Mukherjee, the source said. Pranab Roy and Bengal under-15 coach Rajesh Dani are the other two coaches at the camp that will continue till May 25.

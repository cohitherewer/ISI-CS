 Neelotpal suffers shock defeat

New Delhi: Grandmaster Neelotpal Das suffered a shock defeat at the hands of talented youngster K. Priyadarshan while former world under-10 champion Sahaj Grover held Grandmaster Pravin Thipsay to a draw in the second round of the 5th Parsvnath International Chess tournament on Monday. 

Also, four-time national champion Surya Sekhar Ganguly managed to escape with a draw against local player J.K. Chowdhury. 

Highly-rated IM M. R. Venkatesh was beaten by unheralded J. Sridhar. 

However, top-seeded GM Alexei Dreev of Russia had it easy against Amardeep Bartakke while Manthan Chokshi proved no match for GM Yuri Drozdovskij of Ukraine. 

Neelotpal struggled against young Priyadarshan who gave a strong performance after opening with the king pawn. 

Amidst tactical complications, the former miscalculated and lost two bishops for an imprisoned rook and never recovered. 

Sahaj troubled Thipsay for a long time before getting half a point against his fancied opponent. Playing the white side of a Worrel attack, Sahaj displayed confidence and enjoyed a tangible advantage as the middle game surfaced. 

Thipsay traded the queens to stay in the game and after a series of exchanges, the players arrived at a rook pawn endgame that resulted in a draw. 

This was the first draw with a Grandmaster in Sahajs career. 

Surya Sekhar barely survived in a keenly contested game with Chowdhury and he later admitted that he felt lost at one point in the game.

 Setback for Landis

Paris: Further analyses of urine samples from 2006 Tour de France winner Floyd Landis have shown traces of synthetic testosterone, a French sports daily reported on Monday. 

The seven samples, taken during the 2006 Tour, had at first tested negative but were retested by a French laboratory, the paper said on its website. The lab used a technique aimed at detecting exogenous testosterone as opposed to the hormone contained in the body. 

The tests were conducted by the anti-doping lab in Chatenay-Malabry, outside Paris, and Landis representatives as well as experts from the USADA attended the procedure, the report said. 

An angry Landis, however, said in a statement on his website that USADA had stopped a riders observer from attending the retesting. This is yet another in a series of malicious actions by USADA that tramples my right to have my case heard in a fair and just way.

 Ryan proves speed isnt everything

Christopher Martin-Jenkins 

 Ryan Sidebottom 

When something is reiterated often enough, it can become established as a truth, even if it is bunkum. Perhaps Ryan Sidebottom, named again, as he had to be, in Englands unchanged XI for the third nPower Test against the West Indies, starting at Old Trafford on Thursday, will disprove the fashionable notion that you have to be an express bowler if you are to succeed in Test cricket. 

You do not: you have to be accurate and either to move the ball sideways or to get it to bounce awkwardly. The faster you do that the better, naturally. If you can do it at exceptional pace, and you remain fit, you are going to be a champion. 

Already Sidebottom, who got his chance because Matthew Hoggard strained a thigh muscle during the first Test at Lords and will not be fit at least until the fourth match starting next week in Durham, has been dismissed in some quarters as a stand-in, a horse for the Headingley course, someone who will only play a couple more Tests before being discarded for a proper Test bowler. 

But it is amazing how some miss the obvious. The Sidebottom who took eight wickets on his former home ground in Leeds, admittedly in conditions ideally suited to seam and swing bowling and against a struggling and unlucky opposition, was a much-improved performer from the one who made his first, wicketless, Test appearance in 2001. 

The signs were there before the game when it was noticed that the ball with which he bowled in the nets had no marks on either side, simply because he was hitting the seam all the time. 

That ability, based on a firm wrist at the point of delivery, the main reason for the fact that he has learnt to bowl an inswinger to right-handers, will stand him in good stead on flat pitches and sunny days.

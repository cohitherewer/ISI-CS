 Anand pushed to joint fifth

Monaco: A blunder and a ferocious attack leading to a draw summed up Viswanathan Anands fourth round misfortunes against world champion Vladimir Kramnik of Russia in the Amber blindfold and rapid chess tournament. 

Kramnik was quick to pounce on Anands gaffe and handed out the Indian his third loss in the blindfold. 

Anands onslaught in the return rapid game did not yield what he was looking for and going in to the first rest day, he is now joint fifth in the combined standings of the event he has won five times. 

Kramnik maintained his 100 per cent score in the blindfold, registering his fourth victory on the trot in the event. (PTI)

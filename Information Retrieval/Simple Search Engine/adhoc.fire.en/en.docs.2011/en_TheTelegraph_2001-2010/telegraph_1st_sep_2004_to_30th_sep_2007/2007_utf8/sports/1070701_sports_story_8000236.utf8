The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 As of now, Indo-Pak ODI is on

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Glasgow: 

 The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman, Dr Nasim 

 Ashraf, was among those who had a narrow escape at the airport 

 here on Saturday afternoon. 

 Dr Ashraf and his wife arrived on a (delayed) British 

 Airways flight from London less than one-and-a-half hours 

 before what has been described as an attempted terror strike. 

All flights have since been suspended. 

The PCB chairman is in town for Tuesdays one-off Indo-Pak ODI, which is being held for the benefit of the Prince Charles-headed Princes Trust. 

Till 2.00 am on Sunday, though, there was no talk of shifting the match. 

What happened? I havent been told anything, was former Board of Control for Cricket in India president Inderjit Singh Bindras response, when The Telegraph contacted him in Belfast. 

A senior PCB official, Zakir Khan, had much the same thing to say. He added: As far as I know, the ODI is on schedule. 

The Pakistanis are already in Glasgow.

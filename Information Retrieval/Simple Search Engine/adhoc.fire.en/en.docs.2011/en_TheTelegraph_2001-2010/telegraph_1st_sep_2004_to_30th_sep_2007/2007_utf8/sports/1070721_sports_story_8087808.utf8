Carnoustie: As a teenager caught between boyhood optimism and adult machismo, Sergio Garcia came to these North Sea links eight years ago and left crying in his mothers arms. 

Tiger Woods, the two-time defending champion, was all smiles after holing a 90-foot birdie putt on No. 16. He shot a 69. Garcia, using his belly putter on the 14th green, had seven birdies and one bogey. 

The interim has seen growth and regression, a bagful of PGA Tour victories but also a putting stroke prone to knock and ping. 

On the opening day of the 136th British Open at Carnoustie, beneath ashen and sometimes rainy skies, Garcia leaned on a belly putter and leapt to the front of the championship with a six-under-par 65. 

Its not about revenge for me, said Garcia, who needed 24 more shots in the first round of the 1999 British Open here and missed the cut the next day. I just want to play solid, not suffer too much on the course, and put myself in position to do something on Sunday. 

Garcia had seven birdies and one bogey to take a two-shot lead over Paul McGinley and a three-shot cushion over five players, including the 2007 US Open champion, Angel Cabrera, the 2005 US Open champion, Michael Campbell, and the 18-year-old amateur Rory McIlroy. 

Tiger Woods, Padraig Harrington and K. J. Choi headlined a group of five players four shots back. 

After back-to-back British Opens with brilliant sunsets and dusty fairways, Carnoustie returned the championship to its wet and windy roots. The morning was rainy and cold Woods teed off at 9:09 am local time in a two-tone rain jacket and his white baseball cap pulled low and temperatures never reached beyond the low 50s even when the rain stopped in mid-morning. 

With no precipitation in the afternoon and the northeast winds softening to breezes, Garcia surged almost from the moment he stuck a peg in the ground at 2:42 pm. After making a birdie 3 on his first hole, he turned to his caddie and said, Thats 4 better than the last time. 

Often cited as the best player without a major title, the 27-year-old Garcia has been close before. Last year in the British Open at Royal Liverpool, he played in the final pairing with Woods and, dressed in a canary-yellow outfit, missed putts all afternoon. 

After missing the cut at last months US Open, Garcia started thinking about switching to a belly putter, a longer club with devotees often found on the 50-and-older tours. 

He used a belly putter last week at the Scottish Open and finished tied for 19th. No player has won a major on the PGA Tour with a belly putter. 

There is nothing I hate more than not being able to start putts on line, he said of opting for the longer club, which he is able to stabilise against his stomach. When you start hitting the putt and as soon as you hit it, you know it doesnt have a chance of going in, thats pretty frustrating. I started putting with the belly after the US Open, and it felt good. 

Garcia played the best on a day when many others imploded. John Daly briefly led the championship at five under after holing out for an eagle 2 on No. 11. He then double-bogeyed No.12 and triple bogeyed No. 14 when he hit his second shot over the green, needed three chips to get onto the green and two-putted for an 8. 

Woods, seeking to become the first player to win three consecutive claret jugs since Peter Thomson in 1954-56, dried the grips on his clubs early and turned in a steady, mostly stress-free round. 

To shoot 69 in these conditions, get off to a positive start like that, I feel very good, Woods said. 

On No. 10, a 466-yard par-4, Woods hit his tee shot onto television cables in the thick rough left of the fairway. A rules official, Alan Holmes, gave him free relief, citing that the cables could not be moved. 

Woods took a drop into trampled-down rough, laced an iron shot short of the green, and saved par after hitting a chip shot to 8 feet and rolling in the putt. 

Usually, TV cables are movable, and they deemed them immovable, Woods said. When I got there, he told me the cables arent movable. I thought they should have been able to move them. Everywhere Ive played around the world, you usually pick those up no problem. They were trying to, they just couldnt. I dropped it a little bit worse actually. 

On his back nine, after the rain had stopped, Woods shed his jacket and added back-to-back bogeys on Nos. 12 and 13. But he closed his round with a 90-foot birdie putt on No. 16 and two pars. 

Just made a nice shoulder turn and released it and it went in the hole, Woods said of his long and twisting putt. When the ball dropped into the hole, Woods threw his hands into the air and smiled sheepishly. 

For all his good work, Woods was staring up the leader board at Garcia, who could become Europes first winner of a major since Paul Lawrie won here in 1999. 

When Garcia walked off the 18th green his conversation with his mother, Consuelo, was much different than the one eight years ago, when he was in tears. She just said, Very well done and well played, he said.

 Zidane praise for Asia 

Chiang Mai: French star Zinedine Zidane praised Asian footballs big step forward on Saturday as thousands of excited fans turned up to watch him play a charity match here. 

Zidane said players like Japans Shunsuke Nakamura, who has earned rave reviews with Scottish league-leaders Celtic, were helping to inspire a generation. 

Asian football is in the process of making a big step forward, Zidane said before the match. When you see players like Nakamura who are playing in Europe ... They are bringing something positive to asian football. 

It is also good for future players who are here among us today, who could make this step forward and play in a big European team. (afp)

 Lee: Im back at full pace

 Brett Lee 

Sydney: Australia pace spearhead Brett Lee says he is back to bowling at top speed ahead of next months ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa. 

Lee, 30, had a major surgery on torn ligaments in his left ankle four months ago after missing Australias World Cup triumph in the Caribbean. 

His recovery has been slow but Lee was encouraged by bowling at full stretch at a nets session at the Sydney Cricket Ground last week. 

Im fit and refreshed and felt I could have gone flat-out a month ago, but Ive had to be patient, Lee told a local newspaper. 

Now Im back running flat-out and felt like I was bowling at full pace again. 

As each session has gone on Ive got quicker and quicker. Im back to bowling where I finished up before the injury. 

But I dont want to be like I was six months ago I want to keep improving and become a better player, he said. 

Australias bowling coach Troy Cooley said Lee would be up to the task, declaring he would be the bowler that batsmen feared in the big-hitting tournament. 

Hes been training the house down and he looks good, Cooley said.

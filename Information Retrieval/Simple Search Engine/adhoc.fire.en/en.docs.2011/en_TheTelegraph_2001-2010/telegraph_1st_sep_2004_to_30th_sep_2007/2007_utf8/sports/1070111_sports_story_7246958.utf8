Rohtak: Virender Sehwag made a timely return to form with a typically stroke-filled century but Delhi failed to build on his knock on the first day of the Ranji Trophy Super League match against Haryana on Wednesday. 

Sehwag, whose place in the Indian team has come under threat due to a prolonged form slump, smashed a 134-ball 106 as Delhi closed the opening day at 330 for seven at the Bansi Lal Stadium. 

The right-handed batsman, leading the side and coming in at No. 4, cracked 15 boundaries during his 160-minute stay at the crease. Test discard Aakash Chopra made 84 at the top of the order and shared a crucial 112-run partnership with his skipper for the third wicket. 

 In Hyderabad, young seamer Alfred Absolems seven-wicket haul wrecked Punjab batting line-up as Hyderabad moved to a strong position on the opening day. His strikes bundled out the visitors for 142 runs in their first innings afte r which the hosts made 145 for four to set the stage in their favour. 

It was a good toss for Hyderabad skipper VVS Laxman who elected to field. The early morning dew helped the home team as Absolem picked up seven wickets in a row to reduce punjab to 106 for seven. 

Laxman (batting 44) was at the crease at the draw of stumps after Hyderabad lost Arjun Yadav (40) in the last over of the day. 

Meanwhile, in Nasik, openers Sahil Kukrejas maiden ton and Wasim Jaffers half-century helped Mumbai pile up 302 runs for loss of three wickets against traditional rivals Maharashtra on Day I.

More lucre for Pathan brothers

Ahmedabad: Two days after India won the ICC World Twenty20 trophy in Johannesburg, Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday announced Rs 5 lakh cash award for Pathan brothers Irfan and Yusuf.

The announcement comes after the state unit of the Congress party hit out at the government for ignoring the spectacular performance of the Vadodara duo. The step by the Gujarat government follows similar ones from chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala and Delhi. 

Earlier in the day, the Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) also announced a cash award of Rs 11 lakh to each member of the team. 

Rs 2 lakh for RP

Kanpur: Left-arm pacer Rudra Pratap Singh, who played a stellar role in Indias historic triumph in the ICC World Twenty20, will get a a cash award of Rs 2 lakh from Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association (UPCA).

R.P. Singh would be given a prize of Rs 2 lakh from the UPCA for his outstanding performance during the final, BCCI vice-president Rajiv Shukla said. 

But unfortunately Piyush Chawla will miss him. Chawla did not play in the final and so there is no plan to award him, said Shukla.

Why not in front row?

Patna: Expressing displeasure over the Indian cricket team being made to sit behind the politicians and BCCI officials during the felicitation ceremony at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Wednesday, Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan said they should have sat in front. 

 quot;I feel since today was the day for the players They should have occupied the seats in the front row, quot; Paswan said here. 

 The front row at the felicitation ceremony was occupied 

 by politicians, led by Union agriculture minister and BCCI 

 president Sharad Pawar.

 Karthik reward

 Chennai: The Tamil Nadu government on Wednesday 

 announced Rs 5 lakh cash award for Dinesh Karthik. An official 

 release here said that chief minister M. Karunanidhi announced 

 the reward for Karthik, who belongs to the state. 

 Uthappa booty 

 Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala government decided to 

 award Rs 3 lakh to Robin Uthappa, chief minister V. S. Achuthanandan 

 said on Wednesday.

 Bad luck , says Malik

Karachi: Captain Shoaib Malik on Wednesday described Pakistans close defeats against India in the ICC World Twenty20 as sheer bad luck and said the players were not lacking in abilities. 

Man to man both teams were equal in strength and balanced. Team to team we fought on an even keel. It was sheer bad luck that we failed to beat India twice in the tournament, Malik told reporters on arrival from Johannesburg on Wednesday. 

In purely cricketing terms, we were not lacking anywhere. It was just not our day against India. We tried our best. But overall the team delivered a fantastic performance and our confidence is very high, he said. 

Malik said it was praiseworthy that his team had adjusted so well to reach the final. 

Twenty20 cricket is such that all the batsmen and bowlers need to go in and fire There is no time to settle down. If someone does not contribute it makes a difference to the result.

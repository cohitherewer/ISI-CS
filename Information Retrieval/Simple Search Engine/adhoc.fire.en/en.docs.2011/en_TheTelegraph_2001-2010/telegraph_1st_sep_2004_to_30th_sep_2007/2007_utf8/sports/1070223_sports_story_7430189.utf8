The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Anand grabs 

 sole lead

 - Morozevich loses 

 MORELIA-LINARES CHESS 

 Morelia: 

 Viswanathan Anand continued his top form and demolished 

 Alexander Morozevich of Russia to emerge as sole leader 

 after the end of the fourth round of Morelia-Linares chess 

 tournament here.

 Anand, who had beaten Magnus Carlsen 

 of Norway in the third round, came out triumphs in a well-contested 

 battle against the Russian and took his tally to three points 

 out of a possible four in this category-20 double round 

 robin event between eight players.

 The Indian ace is now followed 

 by Carlsen who came up with his second victory in the event 

 at the expense of overnight joint leader Vassily Ivanchuk 

 of Ukraine to move to 2.5 points. Levon Aronian of Armenia, 

 Peter Leko of Hungary and Russian Peter Svidler inched to 

 two points after draws in the third round game.

 Top seed Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria, 

 is next in line on 1.5 points along with Ivanchuk and Morozevich, 

 is now at the bottom of the table on just one point from 

 his three games.

 Ten more rounds remain in this 

 second major of the year.

 Anand baffled Morozevich from 

 a level position arising out of Ruy Lopez opening where 

 the Indian played white.

 To his credit, Morozevich held 

 out Anands aggressive intentions for a long time in 

 the middle game.

 However, the Russian failed to 

 be consistent enough around the end of first time control 

 and Anand soon seized the initiative and knocked down two 

 black pawns in quick time.

 Morozevich was no match thereafter 

 and resigned on move 59.

 Contrary to the first three rounds 

 that produced just one decisive game each, the fourth round 

 had two decisive games and yet again the youngest participant 

 in the fray, Carlsen, was the cynosure of all eyes.

 Ivanchuks form suffered 

 a real low in this contest, moving his one knight five times 

 in the opening itself and using around one hour for the 

 first 12 moves.

 Magnus got a slightly better position 

 playing black and even as the game was stretched for a long 

 time, the Norwegian retained his advantage. The game lasted 

 60 moves.

 Aronian apparently had some chances 

 against Leko when the latter sacrificed an exchange in the 

 early middle game arising out of a Queens Gambit Declined 

 where the former played white.

 Leko had to find correct exchanges 

 in the final stages to force a draw and he achieved it. 

 Playing white against Svidler, 

 Topalov got slightly better prospects out of the opening 

 but missed the thread later to allow Svidler to Equalise 

 easily.

 When the draw was agreed to, the 

 pundits of the game even thought that Svidler had some chances.

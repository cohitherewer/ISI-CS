 BCCI to stick to rotation policy

Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India has promised to arrange special flights for the players if the schedule is tight during the visit by Pakistan later this year, but maintained the venues of the matches would be decided by its own rotation policy. 

We have played in small centres in Pakistan without hesitation. If necessary, we will arrange for special flights but we will go by our rotation policy in deciding the venues for the matches, secretary Niranjan Shah said. 

Shah was reacting to reports that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) was expecting their team to play a majority of their matches at big venues. 

The tour is slated from early November. 

A PCB official said in Karachi that more deliberations on the itinerary was likely to be held on the sidelines of the joint 2011 World Cup committee meeting next month in the summer resort of Bhurban. 

When the BCCI officials are here obviously we will have discussions with them on the proposed venues and dates for the tour. Perhaps we may even discuss the number of one-dayers to be included, he said. (agencies)

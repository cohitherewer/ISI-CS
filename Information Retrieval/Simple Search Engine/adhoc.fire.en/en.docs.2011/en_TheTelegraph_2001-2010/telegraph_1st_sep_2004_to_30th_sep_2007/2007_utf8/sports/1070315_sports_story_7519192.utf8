The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No Rudi pep talk on India menu

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Dr Webster

Calcutta: As of now, eminent sports psychologist Dr Rudi Webster wont be interacting with Team India during the World Cup. 

Our first match, versus Bangladesh, is on Saturday. 

The arrangement is such that the team management communicates its requirements and, then, we have a dialogue with Dr Webster. Nothing has been planned for the tournament, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Niranjan Shah told The Telegraph. 

In the last World Cup, the Indians had worked with Sandy Gordon, who inspired the Now or Never theme. Hed been handpicked by the Sourav Ganguly-John Wright twosome. 

Speaking on Wednesday evening, Shah added: Dr Webster was scheduled to be in India before the four ODIs against the West Indies (in January), but didnt come We still won that series and the next (versus Sri Lanka)! 

Dr Webster, it may be recalled, worked with the Rahul Dravids twice last year: In the West Indies and, then, in India during the Champions Trophy. 

The initiative had been taken by coach Greg Chappell, whod interacted with Dr Webster (a one-time Warwickshire quick) during his playing days. 

Author of best-seller Winning Ways a study of the minds of champions, Dr Webster helped establish the now defunct Shell-funded West Indies Cricket Board Academy in Grenada. 

Incidentally, besides cricketers, Dr Webster has worked with the likes of Greg Norman.

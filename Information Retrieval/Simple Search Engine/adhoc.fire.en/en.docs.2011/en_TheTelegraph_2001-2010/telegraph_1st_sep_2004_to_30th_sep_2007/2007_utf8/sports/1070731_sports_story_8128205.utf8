 Sania back at No. 31

 Sania Mirza 

New Delhi: Sania Mirza has jumped four places to No. 31, according to the WTA Tour rankings list released on Monday. The 20-year-old Indian made the final of the Stanford Classic on Sunday to get back to her career-best ranking after two years. 

Sania lost the final of the $600,000 WTA Tour event 3-6, 2-6 to Anna Chakvetadze, but the performance put her one step closer to breaking into the top-30. If she breaches that barrier, it will be the first time in 20 years that an Indian will do so. The last was Ramesh Krishnan, who was ranked No. 23 in June 1987. 

Sania won the doubles title at Stanford with Shahar Peer of Israel on Sunday. They beat Chakvetadze and Victoria Azarenka of Belarus 6-4, 7-6 (5). 

This was her second title in as many weeks and pushed her doubles rankings up 10 places to No. 26. 

Sania said her current ranking position reflected her playing standards more accurately than when she reached No. 31 in 2005. 

Rankings are an indication of where you stand in the world. They are not necessarily a fool-proof accurate reflection of ones standing in relation to the rest of the players, Sania said from Stanford. 

I think when I was ranked 31 in 2005, I was lucky to be there after a few good wins and a couple of good draws. I was probably playing top-70 tennis then. I have now worked hard on some of my weaknesses and feel that my current ranking is a better reflection of my level of tennis. 

Being in the top-32 will also get her seeded at the Grand Slams. But Sania did not want to get carried away by the hype about her ranking. 

It will be more of a personal achievement if I break into the top-30, she said. As long as I keep improving and play good tennis, I feel that in the long run, the rankings will take care of themselves. 

Sania is playing in the $1.3-million Acura Classic in San Diego this week and has been drawn to play her doubles partner and world No. 18, Shahar Peer of Israel. 

She is then expected to play in the Los Angeles and Toronto meets. She has entered the $600,000 New Haven tournament that will be played the week before the US Open. 

Sania has decided to partner American Bethanie Mattek at the US Open. The pair had won the Cincinnati title. 

The two will play a couple of run-up tournaments as well probably in Los Angeles and New Haven. 

Prakash Amritraj, meanwhile, jumped 14 places in the ATP rankings, helped by a recent good showing on the ATP Challenger circuit. He is now at No. 262. Karan Rastogi moved up four places to be at No. 339. 

In the individual doubles rankings Leander Paes moved up one spot to No. 8, while Mahesh Bhupathi remained at No. 21. Rohan Bopanna slipped two places to No. 215 in singles, but back-to-back doubles victories in Manchester and Nottingham saw him climb four places to No. 101.

 Ranadeb puts up brave front

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: A day after being ignored by the national selectors, Ranadeb Bose tried to put up a brave front. But the disappointment came through at missing out on the World Cup probables list. 

I didnt get the chance to think about it Friday. Now that we have a few days in hand before the Ranji semi-final, it will sink in But theres no point brooding over it. Lets think positively, he said after Bengal won by an innings against Rajasthan. 

The mediumpacer, who is second on the Ranji wicket-takers list with 38, is not losing focus. 

Its not that the selectors havent seen my bowling. Vengsarkar was here during the Mumbai match, Raju saw me in Gwalior during the Duleep tie Im not a newcomer in that sense Maybe they havent seen me perform. But I believe my time will come, he said. 

I kept my cell off yesterday and that helped. Didnt have to talk to a lot of people At home, my parents also didnt come up with the topic and I concentrated on the final days play Thought about if it would be wise to bowl, or rest the strain. 

Ranadeb picked the five-wicket haul against Mumbai as his best. The seven-wicket against Hyderabad was a fluke it was a one-off thing will not happen everyday, he explained. 

Coach Paras Mhambrey also praised him. 

I was very impressed with the way Ranadeb took the responsibility this season. If one of your main strike bowlers (Shib Shankar Paul) is missing from action, it puts the side under a lot of pressure. 

But Ranadeb has done justice to his talent, Mhambrey said.

 Diabolical end to Empire juggernaut 

 PRAVESH GUPTA

 Mumbai: Diabolical finished first and the rest were nowhere in the 2,400m McDowell Indian Derby held at the Mahalaxmi racecourse on Sunday. In the process, the Major Impact-Double Quick son, from trainer S.Ganapathys yard, stopped the juggernaut of his stables piping hot-favourite, Southern Empire, who was eyeing his eleventh successive victory. Irish jockey, Colm Donoghue partnered the MAM Ramaswamy-owned property.

 Southern Empire finished a poor second, nearly four lengths behind while trainer Pesi Shroffs ward, Blue Ribbon, ran as per expectations, finishing third in a field of eight.

 Diabolical matched strides upfront with the leader Totalitarian right from the start and shrugged off his challenge at the top of the turn to sail into a three-length lead. Southern Empire, on the other hand, stuck to the third berth throughout the trip and the second slot was earned by the 3-10 hot-favourite mainly because Totalitarian came to a grinding halt nearing the home turn.

 The fact that the winner was almost 20 lengths ahead of Southern Empire midway through the Derby trip speaks volumes of his staying prowess and also the suspect stamina of the favourite. Shroffs opinion was, therefore, vindicated as he was the only professional to express his doubts on Friday about Southern Empires staying potential.

 As a jockey, Shroff has nine Indian Derbys to his name. Now a trainer, he banked upon his judgement but it was a daunting task for Blue Ribbon, a filly, to topple frontline masculine power.

 Trainer S.Ganapathy was, however, positive that the beaten Derby-favourite was a stayer. Southern Empire will do a lot better over the trip in the coming weeks. He needed this experience against a formidable opposition; he said. He also confirmed that all his three Derby winning horses Diabolical, Southern Empire and Secret Memory will make the Calcutta contingent for the Turf Invitation Cup on March 11.

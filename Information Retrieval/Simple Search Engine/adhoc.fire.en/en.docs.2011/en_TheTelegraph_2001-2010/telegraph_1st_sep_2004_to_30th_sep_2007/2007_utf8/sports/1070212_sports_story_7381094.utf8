The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Moody puts SLC offer on hold

 - Discussions should be after the Cup: coach 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Tom Moody 

Rajkot: Tom Moody didnt just pull out of the race to succeed John Buchanan as Australias coach (after the forthcoming World Cup), but has declined at this point in time to consider an offer by Sri Lanka Cricket to extend his contract. 

The reason being the same: Moody wants to focus on the biggest tournament and not be distracted by negotiations and excessive Media attention. 

The board is keen that I stay on, but Ive conveyed that discussions must be on hold till after the World Cup My priority, right now, is that tournament In fact, it has been since I took over (in mid-2005), Moody told The Telegraph. 

Tim Nielsen, it may be recalled, got the Australia job after Moody (a member of the 1987 and 1999 World Cup-winning sides under Allan Border and Steve Waugh, respectively) declared he didnt want anything to take his focus away from what currently drives him. 

The 41-year-old Moody had even been in the running to succeed John Wright, but the Team India job eventually went to Greg Chappell. Indeed, quite a few seniors had wanted him, largely because they viewed him as somebody more in tune with the modern game. 

Moody can again come into contention if either the Board of Control for Cricket in India decides not to renew Chappells contract or he himself decides to sign off with crickets showpiece event.

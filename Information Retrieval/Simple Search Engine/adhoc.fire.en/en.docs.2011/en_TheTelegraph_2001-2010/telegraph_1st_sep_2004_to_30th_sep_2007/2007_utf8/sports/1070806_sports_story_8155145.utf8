The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Best goal of my career, says Barreto

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Getting a dream goal and helping immensely in the teams cause would make any footballer ecstatic, and Barreto was no exception. This was the best goal of my career, Barreto, who scored one and set up two in Mohun Bagans 4-3 win over Chirag United SC on Sunday, said. 

The fact that the goal turned the match on its head was even more satisfying for the Brazilian, who looked to be enjoying every moments. My job is to score but today it came when our team took the lead, the overjoyed Barreto said. 

The former Mohun Bagan captain did not criticise the referee directly for the second spot-kick decision. However he said it was absolutely harsh on them. I dont want to comment on the referees decision. He was not in the right position to judge. 

He however thanked the Almighty that the second penalty only reduced the margin, not drew level. 

After a brilliant outing, Barreto feels that Mohun Bagan team is capable of doing even better as the CFL Premier League gathers momentum. 

We will play even better and Odafa has come to solve the defence problems The sooner Odafa gets accustomed to the conditions, the better for our team, he added. 

Coach Carlos Roberto Pereira appeared calm. I was not there at the spot and he had to take the decision at a spur of moment, how do I know whether the decision was right or wrong, he said.

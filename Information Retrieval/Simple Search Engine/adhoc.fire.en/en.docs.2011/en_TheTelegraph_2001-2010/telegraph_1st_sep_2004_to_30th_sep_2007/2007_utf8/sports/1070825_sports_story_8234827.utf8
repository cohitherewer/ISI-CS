 Mystro may strike again 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: The trainer-jockey duo of Vijay Singh and Suraj Narredu may score a back-to-back treble, on Saturday, following their last weeks fruitful association.

 Surajs best ride appears to be Mystro in the afternoons feature event, the 1,800m Roll N Twist Cup. The four-year-old horse had trounced the field in his last outing over 1,400m. He is known to be more at home over extended trips.

 The combos Athymia is also expected to land the Dorania Handicap. The Major Impact Dolka filly is a winner of three races last winter and she is still in Class III. Their Alterio, though a debutante, is also fancied to win the Fair Ray Handicap. Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

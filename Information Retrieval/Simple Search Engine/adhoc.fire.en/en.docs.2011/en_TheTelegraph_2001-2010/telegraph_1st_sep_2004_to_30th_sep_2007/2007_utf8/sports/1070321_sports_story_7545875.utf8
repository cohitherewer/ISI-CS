 Kenya 122/6 after 30 ovs

 New Zealands Ross Taylor in action during their match against Kenya in Gros Islet on Tuesday 

Gros Islet: Ross Taylor hit a half-century before being struck down with a hamstring strain in New Zealands 331 for seven against Kenya in a World Cup group C match on Tuesday. 

Kenya were 122 for six after 30 overs with Thomas Odoyo on six and Jimmy Kamande yet to open his account. Ravi Shah salvaged some pride with a brilliant 71. Shah was done in by Daniel Vettori. Among others, Michael Mason took two wickets and James Franklin one. Two batsmen were run out. 

Craig McMillan struck five sixes in his 71 to help his team post the highest World Cup total at this ground while Scott Styris was dropped twice en route to his 63 off 62 balls. 

New Zealand, who will qualify for the Super Eights with a victory, were put into bat on a slightly damp morning in front of a paltry crowd at the Beausejour Cricket Ground, which was later swelled by school children. 

Taylor played a patient knock before pulling up in the 32nd over and calling for a runner. He only lasted two more overs before being caught and bowled by Kenya captain Steve Tikolo for 85, two balls after smashing him for six. 

The 23-year-old was fortunate to reach his third one-day fifty after Tanmay Mishra failed to cling on to a difficult chance in front of square in the fourth over. Taylor also survived a close run-out with Mishra again the fielder.

 SHARP SINGLES 

Follow CBI: Latif

London: Criticising the ICCs Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU) as highly unsuccessful in curbing match-fixing, former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has praised Indias Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for its efforts in this regard. In the post-Bob Woolmer murder scenario, Latif said, I was willing to work with the ACU and had a detailed meeting with them in London in 2003. I put my life at stake and shared important facts, but I was not taken seriously, he told a news channel.

No rumours

 Islamabad: Pakistan government on Monday urged the international media to go easy on its traumatised cricket team following the murder of coach Bob Woolmer. There are lots of speculations and rumours, some of them very malicious, and we expect the media, to show some sensitivity, Tasnim Aslam, Pakistan foreign ministry spokesperson said on Monday.

Be sensible

 Mumbai: Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray on Monday asked the fans not to attack the players houses. This is not our culture It does not behove us. Nowhere in the world such things happen, Thackeray said.

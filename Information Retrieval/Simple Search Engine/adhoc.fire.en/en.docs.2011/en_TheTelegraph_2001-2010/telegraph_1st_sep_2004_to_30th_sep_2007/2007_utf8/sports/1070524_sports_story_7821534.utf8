 Bhupathi ready to play with Paes in Beijing

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mahesh Bhupathi 

New Delhi: Mahesh Bhupathi on Wednesday said he is ready to pair up with Leander Paes once again during the Beijing Olympics. He isnt too sure, though, whether he should once again be on talking terms with his Calcutta-based partner. 

Talking to reporters in the capital, Bhupathi said he has decided to play the doubles with Paes in Beijing. Logically, its the best decision that could be. We can play and try winning a medal for India at the Olympics. 

Bhupathi was also asked whether his relationship with Paes had improved over the past few months, especially after what happened in the Doha Asian Games. 

I cannot say anything on that, said Bhupathi. Lets shut our mouths and play. That should be the best solution. 

Asked whether he had had a word with Paes about playing in Beijing, Bhupathi shrugged and said: There is no reason to hurry things. Beijing Olympics is still 15 months away. 

It may be recalled that the relationship between Indias two top tennis stars reached its nadir in Doha after Paes accused his partner of not taking things seriously after Indias loss to Chinese Taipei. The duo temporarily patched things up but vowed not to pair up again after winning the doubles gold. 

Bhupathi, who was at the the centre of controversy once again recently after he refused to play a Davis Cup match, had a dig at the AITA on a couple of occasions. 

Here to launch the Mission 2018 talent hunt project sponsored by Apollo Tyres, Bhupathi said that though there was no dearth of talent in the country, nothing has been done to unearth it. 

The infrastructure is not good enough and there is not enough coaching in India , Bhupathi said. There is no system to discover talent from the grass roots. 

Under the Mission 2018 scheme, approximately Rs 100 crores has been earmarked to spot and train youngsters (in the 12-15 year age group) in Bangalore on a long-term basis. Former Davis Cup captain Jaidip Mukerjea will help in selecting the kids.

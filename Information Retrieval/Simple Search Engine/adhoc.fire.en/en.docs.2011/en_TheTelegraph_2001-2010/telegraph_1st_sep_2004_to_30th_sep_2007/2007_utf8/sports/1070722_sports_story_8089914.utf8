 Japan, Iraq in last four

Hanoi: Yuji Nakazawa blasted in the decisive spot kick to lift Japan to a 4-3 win on penalties over Australia to reach Asian Cup semi-finals on Saturday. 

The match finished 1-1 after extra-time and Japan goalkeeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi saved shots from Harry Kewell and Lucas Neill before Nakazawa smashed home Japans fifth penalty to send his side through. 

Striker John Aloisi had put the Socceroos in front in the 68th minute. But Japan struck back just three minutes later. 

In Bangkok, captain Younis Mahmoud scored twice to help Iraq progress to the semi-finals for the first time since 1976 with a 2-0 win over Vietnam. (AGENCIES)

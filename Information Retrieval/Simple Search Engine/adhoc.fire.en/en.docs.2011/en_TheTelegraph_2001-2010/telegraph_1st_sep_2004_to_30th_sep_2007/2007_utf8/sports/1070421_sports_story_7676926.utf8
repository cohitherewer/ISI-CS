 New leads halt Bob inquest 

Kingston: An inquest into the murder of Pakistan cricket coach Bob Woolmer at the World Cup scheduled to start on Monday has been postponed because of recent and significant developments in the case. 

The coroner has been advised that there are recent and significant developments concerning the death of Mr Robert Woolmer, the Jamaican justice ministry said in a statement issued late on Thursday. 

The coroner wishes that these new and significant developments be pursued with the utmost urgency, taking into account that the officer in charge has advised that these new developments are critical to the progress and the eventual results of the investigations themselves. 

If it becomes necessary for an inquest to be held after the new and material developments have been investigated, then another date for the holding of the inquest will be appointed. 

Briton Woolmer was found lifeless in his Kingston hotel room on March 18 and later pronounced dead in hospital. 

His death, which was being treated by Jamaican police as murder by strangulation, has cast a pall on the World Cup tournament which culminates after seven weeks with the final in Barbados on April 28. 

Woolmers Pakistan team had been eliminated from the tournament the day before his death after a shock defeat to debutants Ireland. 

Media around the world have speculated that his death was linked to a betting mafia in the sport but Woolmers widow Gill said that she knew of no threats from such a source. 

On Friday, a British tabloid quoted unnamed Jamaican police sources saying that they were sure Woolmer had been poisoned. 

It said a deadly substance, aconite, had been found in toxicology samples from his body. 

The Irish team, who were staying at the same hotel as Woolmer, were fingerprinted and gave DNA samples to Jamaican police this week. 

We can confirm that the Ireland squad have supplied statements, fingerprints and DNA samples as part of the ongoing police investigation into the murder of Bob Woolmer, the Irish Cricket Union (ICU) said in a statement. 

These were carried out today at the team hotel in Grenada. The Ireland management and players have co-operated fully with the police, and are happy to assist them in any way we can during the course of their investigation.

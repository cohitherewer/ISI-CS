 Absence of coach may benefit India, says John Wright

London: Indians may be poor travellers but former Team India coach John Wright feels Rahul Dravids men could be very competitive if they get their batting right and big players fire when up against it. 

The key for India has always been their belief (or lack of it) that they can win overseas. When away from home they dont get enough runs. They will be very competitive if they get their batting right and big players perform, said Wright, who was the coach when Sourav Ganguly-led Team India scripted their famous NatWest series win five years ago. 

Wright, who coached India to their historic series win in Pakistan and under whom India drew level in the Test series in Australia and reached the finals of 2003 World Cup, said absence of a coach may actually be good for the team. 

A deep breath, and the recognition that they have no coach, may be good for them in the short term. They have an experienced batting line-up and the onus will be on them to plan and perform, said Wright. 

Referring to seniors such as Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly, the former New Zealand opener said it was hardly a surprise that even half a decade later the teams nucleus is the same. 

I am not surprised to see the same names here. They are still the best batsmen in India. There are no other Dravids or Tendulkars on the horizon. One of the joys of my job was to sit there just watching them bat, he was quoted as saying by a local newspaper. 

On Sourav, he said And I loved Ganguly to bits he added spice to the side. (PTI)

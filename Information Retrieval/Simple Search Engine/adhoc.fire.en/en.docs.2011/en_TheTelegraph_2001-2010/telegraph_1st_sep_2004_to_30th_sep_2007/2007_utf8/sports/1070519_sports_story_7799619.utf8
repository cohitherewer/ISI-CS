 Drogba can make the difference

 Free-Kick

P.K. Banerjee

 In a matter of hours, the football world will be tuned in to Wembley. Manchester United will be locked in a battle with Chelsea for the right to lift the FA Cup. I, for one, cant wait for the kick-off.

Come to think of it, we are talking of a domestic Cup final taking place thousands of miles away. But then, if you consider the fact that three of the four semi-finalists in this years European Cup competition were from that country, its not difficult to fathom why English soccer is so hot around the world. 

The history of intense rivalry over the past few seasons, the presence of some of the worlds top names and the reach of satellite television have combined to make this Manchester United versus Chelsea final a must-watch game for all genuine soccer lovers. 

The way this season has shaped up for the two sides has also contributed to the high level of interest. United wrested the Premier League crown from two-time back-to-back champions Chelsea. That gave Fergusons men a great deal of satisfaction as they hadnt won it since 2003 and also wanted to deny Chelsea a hattrick. In the European Cup semi-final, United edged past AC Milan at home but were badly beaten in the return game. 

Chelsea, on the other hand, won the League Cup and took the League race almost to the wire. In the European Cup, they exited in the semi-finals like United, but only after suffering a penalty shootout with Liverpool. From being quadruple title contenders, Mourinhos team can at best finish the season with two trophies. 

My gut feeling says Chelsea will be more hungry for success than United. Thats why I give them a slight edge in Saturdays final. 

Chelseas trump card could well be Drogba, one of the best strikers in business. He is one who can be relied on to take advantage of one-to-one situations nine times out of ten. He also has this wonderful ability to make 180 degree turns and score from seemingly impossible positions. 

Drogba should have ample support from Lampard, Makelele and Joe Cole. Lampard hasnt quite played to potential in the last one year or so, this could be the stage when he rediscovers himself. The defence, led by the redoubtable John Terry, looks solid too. 

United have the resources to prove me wrong. The combination of Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo can be lethal against any opposition any Wayne day. But as Milan showed a few days ago, they can be stopped. 

Ronaldo has this tendency of working down the wings, he doesnt like to venture too much into the crowded middle path. Chelsea will look to stop his dangerous runs, by hook or by crook.. 

Ill be watching the battle on field as closely as the one off it. Ferguson versus Mourinho is a clash between contrasting characters. 

On the one hand we have Fergusons shrewdness and solidity, on the other Mourinhos flair and exuberance. 

Both have shown time and again that they are capable of bringing the best out of their players, in different ways. I have great respect for Ferguson, but if I were to look forward to a novel idea in a big game like this, I reckon it would come from Mourinho.

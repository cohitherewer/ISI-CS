 Coroner releases Woolmers body

 Bob Woolmer 

Kingston: The body of Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer has been released by coroner Patrick Murphy and will soon be returned to his family, Jamaican government officials said on Monday. 

The ministry of national security said in a statement that after talks involving Jamaican deputy police commissioner Mark Shields and Murphy, it was agreed to return Woolmers body to his family in South Africa. 

Mr Shields says he has spoken to Mr Woolmers widow, Gillian, and appraised her of the latest developments, the statement said. 

Shields says he has also been in contact and is working with the funeral home holding Mr Woolmers body with a view to repatriating it to South Africa as soon as possible. 

Woolmer, 58, was found lifeless in his Kingston hotel room on March 18. He was later pronounced dead in hospital. 

His death came less than 24 hours after Pakistans shock World Cup defeat to debutants Ireland which knocked the 1992 winners out of the tournament. 

The death cast a pall on the showpiece tournament which is being held in the Caribbean for the first time. 

Police have said that the former England Test cricketer had died of manual strangulation and they launched a murder investigation which continues. 

The police have said they have received toxicology reports on Woolmers body but have not released details. Media reports said the corpse had been embalmed. 

According to the statement on Monday, Jamaican police will do everything within its power to ensure the facilitation of the repatriation process. 

The Jamaican government said last week that the inquest would be postponed, due to significant new developments in the murder investigation. 

It did not elaborate. 

The statement did not say how soon the body would leave Jamaica but an official of the national security ministry said on Monday that efforts would be made to release the body by Wednesday or Thursday. 

Officials would not say whether the coroners inquest would still go ahead. 

The seven-week World Cup culminates in the final in Barbados on Saturday.

 United on 50 million spending spree

 Owen Hargreaves 

London: Manchester United have only just won their record ninth Premier League title. Now the Red Devils are set to spend about 50 million ($98.8 million; euro73.5 million) to help win a 10th championship next year. 

Less than three weeks after the Premier League season finished with United six points ahead of Chelsea, the club said Thursday that they would sign Owen Hargreaves from Bayern Munich. 

The England midfielders arrival was announced just a day after the news that United had agreed to sign Brazilian midfielder Anderson from FC Porto and Portuguese winger Nani from Sporting Lisbon. 

Sporting confirmed on Thursday that Nani will move for 17.3 million ($34.3 million; euro25.5 million), which is about what Hargreaves will cost. British and Portuguese papers reported that Andersons transfer was worth a similar amount. 

Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez said last week that clubs needed to move fast in order to add top players to their squads for next season, and United are doing just that. United made just one big signing in the last off season, paying Tottenham 18.6 million ($36.8 million; euro27.4 million) for England midfielder Michael Carrick. 

Calming fans fears that the 2005 takeover by Malcolm Glazer had curbed the clubs largesse when it came to competing for the best players, United are now spending on the scale of Chelsea and their billionaire owner Roman Abramovich and doing it quickly. 

The 26-year-old Hargreaves had been linked to United for a year and is expected to line up with Carrick in central midfield, as he has done for England. 

The Canadian-born midfielder was England fans player of the year in 2006 after starring at the World Cup and should provide the defensive cover United has lacked in recent years. The transfer fee for Nani is the biggest Sporting has ever received, and is almost 50 percent more than it got from United for Cristiano Ronaldo four years ago. (AP)

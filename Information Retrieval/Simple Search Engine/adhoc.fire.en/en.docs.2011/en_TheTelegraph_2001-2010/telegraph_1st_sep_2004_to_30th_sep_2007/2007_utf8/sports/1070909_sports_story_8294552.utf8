New York: Top seed Justine Henin of Belgium battled past two-time champion Venus Williams 7-6, 6-4 in a see-saw slugfest on Friday to line up a US Open final against Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova. 

Henin, the 2003 champion, won a fiercely fought first set 7-2 in the tie-breaker and broke 12th seed Venus in the final game for victory, following up her quarter final victory over two-time winner Serena Williams. 

Fourth seed Kuznetsova, who won the Open in 2004, overcame some early nerves to beat compatriot Anna Chakvetadze 3-6, 6-1, 6-1 in her semi-final on a hot, breezy day at Flushing Meadows, as reported in Saturdays Late City edition. 

Henin and Venus met for the first time since the American prevailed in the semi-finals of the 2003 Australian Open. 

The two-hour match, marked by rousing rallies and spiced with volley exchanges at the net, was Henins second win against seven losses to Venus. 

I started the match so well, I was playing unbelievable tennis, Henin said. But soon as you give just a little, she comes right back. I think it was a very good match. 

Im very disappointed, said Venus, who said she felt dizzy and sick to her stomach. But credit to her for playing well. 

Henin broke Venus to open the match and dropped just two points on serve until serving for the set in the 10th game. Venus raised her level, saving three set points before breaking back to set up the tie-breaker. 

After Henin seized the early lead in the second set with a break to lead 2-0, Williams answered by breaking in the fifth game on a backhand winner. 

Venus looked set to surge ahead after taking a 0-40 lead on Henins serve in the seventh game. The Belgian, however, ran off five straight points to hold and broke Venus for 5-3. 

With Henin serving for the match, the American rose to break back, but Henin had the last word. She set up match point with a service return that brushed the back line and reached the final on a forehand error. 

Venus, 27, was visited by the trainer after the seventh game of the second set but declined to use a timeout. I was fighting some circumstances I couldnt conquer, she said. 

Henin became the second player to beat the Williams sisters in the same Slam. Martina Hingis accomplished it at the 2001 Australian Open before losing the final to Jennifer Capriati. 

In contrast to the high-quality of the Henin-Venus match, Kuznetsova prevailed in an error-filled contest. 

Kuznetsova lost her serve four times and had 21 errors in the opening set but won 12 of the last 13 games. I was so nervous in the first set, said the Russian. Every ball I hit, I hit it with the frame, the handle, somewhere out. Forehand. Didnt serve well. 

In the mens doubles, Swede Simon Aspelin and Austrian Julian Knowle won their first Grand Slam title by defeating Czechs Lukas Dlouhy and Pavel Vizner 7-5, 6-4.

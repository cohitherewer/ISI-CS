 England sit pretty on 100/2

Gros Islet: Englands Andrew Flintoff grabbed two wickets on his return to limit Kenya to 177 all out in their rain-affected group C decider on Saturday. 

Captain Steve Tikolo struck 76 before being yorked by Flintoff, back after being dropped from the Canada win because of a drinking scandal. 

England were 100 for two after 17 overs. Ed Joyce and Kevin Pietersen were batting on 47 and 27, respectively. Michael Vaughan and Ian Bell were the batsmen dismissed. 

The match started two hours late and was reduced to 43 overs-a-side because of rain.

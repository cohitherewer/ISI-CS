Siliguri: It was under his leadership that Team India lost to Australia in the final of the 2003 World Cup in South Africa. 

As India take on Pakistan in the final of the ICC World Twenty20 at the Wanderers on Monday, Sourav Ganguly is confident Mahendra Singh Dhonis team will return triumphant. 

I have not done any analysis, but am confident that India will win the final tomorrow, Sourav, who was here to inaugurate Savin Kingdom, the first amusement park of Siliguri, said on Sunday. The players are in excellent form and there is no doubt that India are the favourites. 

The former Team India captain praised Mahendra Singh Dhonis leadership and Yuvraj Singhs batting. 

Dhoni is performing well as a captain Good that he will be leading in one-dayers too, he said. All the players in the squad are playing well, especially Yuvraj. 

Sourav also felt that Twenty20 cricket will gain popularity in India. 

Twenty20 cricket has already been well accepted and will gain more popularity across the country. It is definite that this form of cricket will make its own place, he added. 

Sourav reached here this afternoon and went to Sukna to witness the ongoing Gold Cup. From Sukna he reached the amusement park at Dagapur, a kilometer away from Siliguri.

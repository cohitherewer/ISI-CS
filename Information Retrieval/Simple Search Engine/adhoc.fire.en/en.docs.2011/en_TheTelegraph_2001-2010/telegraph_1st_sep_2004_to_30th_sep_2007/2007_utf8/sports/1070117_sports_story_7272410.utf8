 Ronaldo may be Milan-bound 

Madrid: Ronaldo could be on his way to AC Milan. 

The Brazilian striker, who is surplus to requirements at Real Madrid, has held talks with the Italian club through his agent Fabiano Farah, a sports daily reported Tuesday. 

Ronaldo came close to joining Milan last August but the clubs failed to reach an agreement. Milan offered euro22 million ($28.4 million) for the three-time World Player of the Year but Madrid also wanted an option on the Italian teams midfielder Kaka. 

Ronaldo spent five years in Milan with rival Inter before joining Madrid in 2002. 

Ronaldo, whose contract runs to June 2008, is said to be seeking to leave Madrid during this Januarys transfer window after coach Fabio Capello said he doesnt want him in the team. 

It would surely be better for the club and for him if he were tran0sferred if there are offers. If not, he will stay with us, Madrid president Ramon Calderon told Onda Radio on Monday.

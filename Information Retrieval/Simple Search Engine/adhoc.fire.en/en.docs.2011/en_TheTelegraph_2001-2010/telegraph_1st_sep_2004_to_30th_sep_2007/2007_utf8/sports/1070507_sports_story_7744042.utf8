The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 All quiet on Raju claim

A STAFF REPORTER

 Virender Sehwag

Calcutta: The BCCI doesnt wish to comment on Venkatapathi Rajus observation that Virender Sehwag should be the vice-captain. Dilip Vengsarkar is also keeping mum. 

I dont wish to make a comment, the chief selector said on Sunday. 

A PTI report from Mumbai had quoted Vengsarkars colleague on the selection panel Raju as saying: In case Rahul misses a match, seniority-wise, Sehwag should lead. However, the decision will be taken by the team management. 

Ratnakar Shetty, BCCIs chief administrative officer, said he would not comment on speculative stories. 

Whether Raju has said it or not is also a matter of conjecture. We will stick to what was decided after the selection meeting and that the team management will have a final say on the issue. 

Earlier in the day, cricket manager Ravi Shastri said: We will relate to the ifs when the ifs arrive. Dont worry, there will be no problems. We know who should do the job and who should not do the job. 

If Sehwags elevation turns out to be true, it will be surprising as the Delhi opener had been removed from that position some months back and has not performed since to get back that position. 

Moreover, unlike Yuvraj Singh, who has been picked for both Tests and ODIs, Sehwag has been picked only for the shorter version of the game. 

It is expected that Dravid will avert such a crisis by playing the opening match in Mirpur on Thursday.

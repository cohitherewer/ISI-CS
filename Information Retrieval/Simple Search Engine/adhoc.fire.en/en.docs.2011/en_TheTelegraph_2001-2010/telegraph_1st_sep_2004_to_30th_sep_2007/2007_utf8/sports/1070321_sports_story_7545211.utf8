 Gibbs achievement is greater: Sobers 

Basseterre: Garfield Sobers joined Herschelle Gibbs, the newest member of crickets most exclusive 6-6-6-6-6-6 club, to present a million dollar cheque to charity on Monday. 

South African Gibbs became the first man to hit six sixes in an over in an ODI, striking the unfortunate Dutch bowler Daan van Bunge over the short Warner Park boundary for 36 runs. Only three men have achieved the act, with Sobers and Indias Ravi Shastri getting their records in first-class cricket. 

Gibbss accomplishment was recognised by Johnnie Walker who wrote a $1 million dollar cheque which was handed over to a representative for Habitat for Humanity for the homeless in the Caribbean. Sobers feels the notoriety he gained for hitting six sixes in an over may have overshadowed his other achievements and hopes that does not happen to Gibbs. 

I hope that Herschelle doesnt suffer the way that I have suffered over the years, because where ever I have gone people have recognised me as the man that hit six sixes, the West Indies great allrounder said. I have always wondered if that was the only thing I had done in cricket. I thought I had done a little bit more than just hit six sixes. 

Sobers said Gibbs was a greater achievement. He has created history his were at the World Cup his are in a different category than mine, Sobers said. Herschelle Gibbs has put St Kitts Warner Park on the map.

 ECB penalises Shane Warne

London: Shane Warne was given six penalty points by the ECB on Tuesday for abusing an umpire after being given out leg before wicket, while playing for Hampshire, in a County match last week. 

Warne was reported by umpires Tim Robinson and Barrie Leadbeater for two separate Level II breaches of the ECBs disciplinary code. 

Warne made it clear to Robinson that he was unhappy with the decision, in the drawn match against Kent at Canterbury and uttered an audible obscenity as he approached the pavilion. 

The penalty remains on Warnes record for two years, and a further three-point penalty, would earn him an automatic suspension. (REUTERS)

 Circuit damaged 

Shanghai: Stands at Shanghais Grand Prix circuit damaged by a fierce storm last week may not be repaired in time for the Formula One race in October, according to track officials. 

On Friday, winds gusting over 130kmph ripped off guard rails and brought down four stands at the 200,000 capacity Shanghai International Circuit. (REUTERS)

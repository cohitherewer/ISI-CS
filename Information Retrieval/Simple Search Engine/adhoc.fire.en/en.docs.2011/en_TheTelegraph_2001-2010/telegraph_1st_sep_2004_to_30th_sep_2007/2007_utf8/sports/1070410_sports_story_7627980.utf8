 Move to prune Elite teams hailed

A STAFF REPORTER AND AGENCIES

Calcutta: Coaches of the Ranji Trophy Elite division have welcomed the BCCIs move to prune the number of teams from 15 to ten from 2008-09. 

The following are the reactions (alphabetically): 

PRAVIN AMRE (Mumbai): It will be more competitive as we will have to do well in all the matches. This will be nice a good thing to happen to Indian cricket. 

ASHOK MANKAD (Baroda): Having seen the format this year, there were certain teams in the Elite group who ought to have been in the Plate division. At the same time encouragement and recognition need to be given to the Plate division teams by the process of elevation. The move is a good one. 

PARAS MHAMBREY (Bengal): Weve got to see the format actually Is it going to be a round robin league with the team having the highest points winning? But in a way, by reducing the number of teams, you are assisting quality cricket. With top 10 teams competing, obviously the competition would be high and restricted to the top cricketers of the country. Its a good step and definitely encouraging.

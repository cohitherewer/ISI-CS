 Bagan to play under protest

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: After a day filled with drama and uncertainty, Mohun Bagan agreed to play Hindustan Aeronautic Sports Club (HASC) in the 10th round of the National Football League for the ONGC Cup on Thursday. 

Following Mohun Bagans letter a fortnight back, requesting the AIFF to reschedule their match as many of their frontline players were busy with national duty, AIFF called off Mohun Bagans fixture with HASC and rescheduled it a day later. 

Unhappy with the rescheduling, Mohun Bagan decided to play the match under protest. 

After our request AIFF asked us play the match on Friday, which we didnt agree and the discussion stopped there... 

We have decided to play tomorrow on protest, a senior Mohun Bagan official said Wednesday. We have spoken to both the AIFF and IFA officials and the match is on. 

Meanwhile, coach Chima Okerie a thorough professional wasnt disturbed by all the uncertainty and hoped to get full points from the tie. We will go all out tomorrow for a win and Im not seeing HASC as inferior opponents, Chima said after practice on Wednesday. 

In the next three matches we will score goals as well as win to go up the ladder, the Nigerian said.

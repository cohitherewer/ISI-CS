 England fined

Bridgetown: Michael Vaughans troubles in the Caribbean continued on Tuesday when England were fined for their slow over-rate during the seven-wicket defeat by Australia in the World Cup Super Eight match in St Johns. 

Match Referee Mike Procter ruled that England were two overs short of their target at the scheduled finish of the Australia innings on Sunday. 

The players were fined five per cent of their match fees for every over not bowled in time, while captain Vaughans punishment was double. 

England are in real danger of not reaching the semi-finals of the seven-week tournament as they have only two points with three games to play.

 Fernando Alonso leads a McLaren 1-2 in Monza

 Fernando Alonso after winning the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday 

Monza: Double world champion Fernando Alonso led a McLaren one-two in the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday to cut teammate Lewis Hamiltons lead to three points with four races remaining. 

Hamilton, 22, had another highly impressive afternoon but the was doomed to follow in the Spaniards slipstream after his teammate secured pole position in Saturdays qualifying. He crossed the line six seconds behind Alonso, who celebrated his 19th career win and fourth of the season. 

Hamilton now has 92 points to Alonsos 89 in what looks increasingly like a two-man battle, dependant on the outcome of a hearing of the governing body in Paris on Thursday that could wreck their title hopes. 

Ferrari, winners four times in the previous five seasons at the temple of Italian motor sport, had to make do with Kimi Raikkonens third place. 

The Finn fell further behind in the title reckoning, 18 points adrift of Hamilton who highlighted his talents further by overtaking the Ferrari for second place with a brilliant move after his final pitstop. 

On a sunny but miserable afternoon for Ferrari, ever more McLarens bitter enemies since the spy row erupted between the two in July, Brazilian Felipe Massa was forced to retire with just 10 laps gone. His title hopes took a severe dent, with the Brazilian now 23 points off the lead despite having three wins to his credit. 

Germanys Nick Heidfeld was fourth for BMW Sauber with Polish teammate Robert Kubica fifth and Germanys Nico Rosberg sixth for Williams. 

Alonso expects this seasons championship to go down to the last race. 

Nothing was decided before the race, nothing is decided after the race and I think it will stay like that until the last race, Alonso told a news conference. 

The rivalry between Alonso and Hamilton this season has been so intense it has been easy to forget they are teammates and the Spaniard is determined to pile on the pressure on the 22-year-old. 

Im happy, but I know there will be some more difficult weekends. What cannot change is my level of concentration and my level of push for this championship, he added. 

Alonso was especially pleased with how he has fought back from finishing third at last months Turkish Grand Prix, where Massa and Raikkonen came in one and two. 

The Belgian Grand Prix takes place in Spa next weekend.

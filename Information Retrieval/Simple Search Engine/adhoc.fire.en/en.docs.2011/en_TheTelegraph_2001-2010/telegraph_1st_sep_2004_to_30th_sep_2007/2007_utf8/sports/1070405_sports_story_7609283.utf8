 Smith happy with top-order show

Georgetown: South Africa may not have really pulverised Ireland in their seven-wicket victory in their Super Eight match on Tuesday, but skipper Graeme Smith is happy to see his top-order hitting form just at the right time in the World Cup. 

Im happy that our top four have had some good batting in the tournament so far, Smith said after the match. 

Only AB de Villiers (0) flopped with the bat in Tuesdays match while Smith (41), Jacques Kallis (66 not out) and Ashwell Prince (47 not out) got some good batting practice. 

It was good to see Ash get some runs and find his feet. He just needed time in the middle, Smith said. 

He was also happy with the clinical show in the rain-truncated match. 

Its another two points, which is obviously important. Considering the rain interruptions, we won convincingly. They tried to make it tough but Im glad we won. 

I thought Ireland showed great energy and passion today, he admitted. 

His Irish counterpart, Trent Johnston, was proud of the show his team put up and he also praised the way his side fielded. 

I think it was not a bad show. They bowled really well at the start and pinned us back. After all, they have two top class bowlers (in Shaun Pollock and Makhaya Ntini). And then they have the quality of (Charl) Langeveldt and (Andrew) Hall to call upon, he said. 

I think 150 was a reasonable score and we stuck out there till the 32nd over. Thats the way we play the game, to hang in there and fight till the end. Im proud of the guys and we are looking forward to playing New Zealand next week, he said. 

Johnston was, however, irritated with the way the revised target was calculated for South Africa in their rain-shortened match. 

Ireland scored 152 for eight and South Africa secured a seven-wicket victory after reaching 165 for three with 21 balls remaining. 

South Africas adjusted target was 160, which puzzled Johnston. He felt the target should have been about 15 or 18 runs more than Irelands final total since South Africa were able to pace their run chase for 35 overs from the start. 

At the start of an innings you dont bank on it being a 35-over game, Johnston said. Youre building for a 50-over game and when it gets restricted... Im not really sure how Duckworth-Lewis works but it didnt help us all that much. 

Kallis, meanwhile, hit back at critics after he followed up his knock of 86 against Sri Lanka last week by top-scoring with 66 on Tuesday. 

However, before those two performances, Kallis slow batting was blamed for South Africas 83-run defeat by Australia in the group stage. 

Some commentators said Kallis should be axed from the team but the allrounder has had the last laugh. 

Ive been playing a big role in helping South Africa win games and thats the most satisfying aspect, Kallis told a news conference. 

Ive never minded criticism but I think theres a line you dont cross and certain people crossed that line. Thats fine, I will remember who those guys are in future. 

But thats life. Youre up one day and down the next. The only way you can prove people wrong is by putting in performances and winning games for South Africa. 

Ive never been too worried about whats been written, Im not going to change my game just because a few people arent happy with it. Ive been given a role in the side and thats the way I perform.

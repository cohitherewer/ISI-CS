 Anand crushes Ponomariov

Leon: Grandmaster Vishwanathan Anand cruised into the finals of the Magistral Ciudad de Len Chess meet with a comfortable 3-1 victory over Ukr-ainian Ruslan Ponomariov. 

The Indian, thus, remained on track to score his second hattrick of victories at the event. 

Anand beat Kasimdzhanov in the final here in 2005 and Topalov in 2006. His first hattrick of titles came in 1999, 2000 and 2001. Anand will meet the winner of the other semi-final between Bulgarian Veselin Topalov and Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan in the final. 

Ponomariov, playing black, chose a rare line in the Winawer Variation of the French Defence. The centre was closed in the opening and Anand began an attack on the kingside, gaining a lot of space advantage in the process. 

The Ukrainian tried to stop Anands progress by sacrificing a pawn on the kingside and closing that part of the board. 

The game was clearly dominated by Anand and Ponomariov got no opportunity to create counter-threats. 

Ponomariov resigned on the 50th move when Anand was about to queen the pawn. 

The third game was another French Winawer. 

The last game was a mere formality as the match was already decided. Anand defended well against the Catalan Opening and equalised without much difficulty.

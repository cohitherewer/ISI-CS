 Vaughan returns as ODI captain

Sydney: Newly reappointed captain Michael Vaughan said on Sunday it will take time for England to overcome its 0-5 Ashes series loss to Australia. 

I do expect that there will be a few mental frailties because of whats happened, but that can soon change once you start winning a few games, Vaughan said. 

I inherit a very talented team, but there will be an effect from the 5-0 Ashes whitewash. Anyone who says there wont will be lying. 

Earlier Sunday, team officials confirmed Vaughan will return as captain for the limited-overs tri-series against Australia and New Zealand. The 32-year-old batsman has been out for the last year with recurring knee problems which forced him to miss the Ashes. 

But after months of rehabilitation, including time with the England Academy squad in Perth, Vaughan was named in the one-day squad and confirmed as captain for both the Twenty/20 International against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Tuesday and the one-day series to follow. 

Vaughan replaces allrounder Andrew Flintoff, who led England during the Test series. 

Vaughan said he expects England to eventually recover from its Ashes experience. 

We won the Ashes in 2005 and collectively took all the praise, and we have to collectively take the criticism now, said Vaughan. We have made mistakes and were sorry for that, but this is a great challenge for us to try and pick ourselves up.

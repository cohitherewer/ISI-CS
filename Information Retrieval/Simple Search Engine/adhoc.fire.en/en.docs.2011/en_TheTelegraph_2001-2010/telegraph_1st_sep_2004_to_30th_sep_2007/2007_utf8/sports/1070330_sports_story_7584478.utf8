 New theory on Talat move

Karachi: Pakistan manager Talat Ali shifted to a new room under a false name in the Jamaica Pegasus under instruction from the ICC, sources in the PCB said on Thursday. 

Responding to speculations that the Jamaican police was investigating why Talat had shifted to new room under a false name after the murder of coach Bob Woolmer, sources said Talat had informed the police he was advised to do so by the ICC and the hotel management. 

Talat was the last person to shift his room from the 12th floor where Woolmer was murdered. Before him, Brian Lara, Clive Lloyd, Danish Kaneria, Murray Stevenson, Darryn Lifsun had all changed their rooms soon after the incident, a source said. 

Talat didnt know about him being booked into the new room under the false name until the hotel manager came and gave him the key, the source added. 

Talat was told he was booked under a new name for security reasons and to help him avoid media harassment. It was not his decision, said another source.

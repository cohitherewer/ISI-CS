Madrid: David Beckham was sent off in the final minute of Real Madrids 0-0 home draw with lowly Real Betis in the Primera Liga on Saturday. 

The former England captain, making his 150th appearance for the club, was shown a straight red card for a late challenge on Isidoro. It was his fifth dismissal with Madrid and the eighth of his career. 

Madrid remain third with 42 points, one behind second-placed Sevilla who host Atletico Madrid on Sunday. 

Leaders Barcelona, on 46 points, visit fourth-placed Valencia on Sunday. 

In Saturdays late game, sixth-placed Real Zaragoza defeated Villarrael 1-0 thanks to a goal from Diego Milito. 

Beckham and Brazilian Robinho started on the flanks against Betis. Although the home side dominated, chances were hard to come by. 

Raul joined Ruud van Nistelrooy in the home attack for the second half but little changed. 

Tempers flared towards the end and Beckham lost his cool after being dispossessed in the Betis area, chasing back and lunging into a challenge from behind on Isidoro. 

Beckham only returned to the team last weekend after being banished to the stands by coach Fabio Capello following his decision to join Los Angeles Galaxy at the end of the season. 

Betis are 14th in the table. 

In Serie A, Ronaldo scored two goals and set up another as AC Milan beat Siena 4-3 to climb to fifth spot. 

Ronaldo inspired Milan to a dramatic victory after Siena had pulled themselves level each time they fell behind only to succumb to Ambrosinis header in the final seconds. 

It was a fantastic day, but we cant afford to concede so many goals, Ronaldo said. 

On Saturday, Reading snatched a 1-1 draw at Manchester United while Chelsea trounced second division Norwich City 4-0 to reach the FA Cup quarter-finals. 

United dominated the fifth round tie and led with midfielder Michael Carricks strike in first-half stoppage time, only for Iceland midfielder Brynjar Gunnarsson to earn Reading a replay at the Madejski Stadium with a 67th minute equaliser. 

Arsenal face a replay at Ewood Park on February 28 after drawing 0-0 with Blackburn Rovers and Middlesbrough will also play again on February 27 after being held 2-2 by second division West Bromwich Albion.

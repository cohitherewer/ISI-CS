 Bharat Arun to meet players July-end

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former India medium-pacer Bharat Arun is looking forward to speaking to the Deep Dasguptas on returning to the city in July-end. Everything happened so quickly that I couldnt even meet the players I will meet them after coming here from Jamshedpur, Arun said on Sunday. 

The new Bengal coach is in the Steel City to oversee a Level I coaches programme and will take charge of the side on September 1. I will start on September 1 as I am contracted with National Cricket Academy (NCA) till August-end, he said. 

Aruns name, it is learnt, had been proposed by former India captain Ravi Shastri during Team Indias camp here ahead of the Bangladesh tour. The CAB had Arun in mind since then and ultimately struck the deal on Saturday. A proper offer came just a week back. 

The former India medium pacer felt that Sourav Gangulys immense experience will inspire him and the entire side. He can give a lot of valuable inputs. 

he level III coach, however, wishes to go back to the NCA fold once his assignment with Bengal is over.

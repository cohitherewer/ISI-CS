 SHARP SINGLES 

Moody wont be interested

Bridgetown: Tom Moody would not be interested

 in taking up the job of coaching India even if the offer came his way, a

 senior player of the Sri Lanka squad has said. Moody had applied for the

 job two years ago but the BCCI had preferred Greg Chappell to him. Now the

 Sri Lanka coach, whose team will take on the Australians in the final in

 Barbados on Sunday, apparently doesnt want to take up a job which involves

 lot of international travelling and a lot of heat from media and fans.

Dilips choice 

 Mumbai: Selection committee chairman Dilip Vengsarkar feels Australia hold a minuscule edge over Sri Lanka in Saturdays final. The team which plays better on the day should win, but due to the bouncy nature of the wicket at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, I feel Australian pacers hold a slight edge, Vengsarkar said on Saturday.

Gordons aim 

 Port of Spain: Profits from the World Cup may help the West Indies Cricket Board wipe off $15 million debt, president Ken Gordon has said. Im optimistic enough to hope that it might wipe it all out. I expect that if we dont reap the full benefits, we will get pretty close, Gordon was quoted as saying by a local newspaper.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Power cut holds up play

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The 2007 Sunfeast Open, already hit by injuries and withdrawals, got mired in fresh controversy on Tuesday. 

Two early matches on Centre Court and Centre 1 were suspended for nearly half an hour due to a power cut that the organisers attributed to a grid failure. 

Tatiana Poutchek was serving to Alla Kudryavtseva and Anastasia Rodionova was in a rally with Hana Sromova when the Netaji Indoor Stadium plunged into darkness around 1.45 pm. 

Tournament director Jaidip Mukerjea said it was not a big issue.

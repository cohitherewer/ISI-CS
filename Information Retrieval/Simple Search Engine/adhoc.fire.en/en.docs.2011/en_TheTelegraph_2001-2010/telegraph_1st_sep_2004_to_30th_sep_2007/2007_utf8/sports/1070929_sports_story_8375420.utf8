The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Shastri named NCA chairman

Mumbai: Former India captain Ravi Shastri was on Friday appointed new chairman of Bangalore-based National Cricket Academy (NCA) at the BCCIs 78th AGM here after he agreed in principle to do the job. 

However, the player-turned-television commentator has sought a day or two to get back to the BCCI and commit himself to the high-profile post after looking into his commitments, BCCI treasurer N. Srinivasan said. 

[According to The Telegraphs sources, when Shastri was first approached, he declined saying he wouldnt find the time to do justice to the job. Obviously, the Sharad Pawar regime has persuaded him to take up the post.]

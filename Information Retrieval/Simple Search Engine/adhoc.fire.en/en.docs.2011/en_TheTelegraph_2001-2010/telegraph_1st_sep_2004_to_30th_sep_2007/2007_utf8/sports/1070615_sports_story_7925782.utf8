The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No reaction right now, says Kapil

 - INDIAN CRICKET LEAGUE ISSUE 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Kapil Dev 

Calcutta: The chairman of the Indian Cricket Leagues executive board, Kapil Dev, has chosen not to react to the we-wont-recognise decision by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). 

Im on vacation with my family (wife Romi and daughter Ameya)... Its once in a year that I manage to take the family out... Im not going to comment till Ive returned home and got the details, Kapil told The Telegraph. 

Talking on Thursday evening, he added: I should be back within a fortnight... So, please wait till then... 

Besides turning down the Leagues application for recognition, the BCCI decided that a senior official would have a dialogue with Kapil. After all, hes the chairman of the Bangalore-located National Cricket Academy. 

As reported, the decisions were taken during Tuesdays working committee meeting in New Delhi. 

According to a top source, president Sharad Pawar will nominate the official. Its going to be a sensitive assignment and, so, it will have to be somebody senior... 

Barodas Kiran More, one of the executive board members, is also in the BCCIs line of fire. 

The BCCI is firm about no contracted player even at the state-level or any official anywhere having anything to do with the Zee-promoted venture. 

Kapil has, in the past, stated he would quit as the Academys chairman if the BCCI wanted him to do so. As he put it in his typically blunt manner: Im not employed by anybody. 

We await the return of Indias only World Cup-winning captain. The League, incidentally, is set to roll from the coming season.

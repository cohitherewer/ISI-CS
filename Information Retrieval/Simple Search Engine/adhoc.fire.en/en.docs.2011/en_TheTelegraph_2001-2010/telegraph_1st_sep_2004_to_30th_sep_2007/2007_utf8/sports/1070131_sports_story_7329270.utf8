Perth: New Zealand continued Englands touring woes with a 58-run win in a tri-series ODI on Tuesday. 

With Australia already assured of a spot in the finals, New Zealand and England are vying for the other place. 

And the New Zealanders dominated, posting 318 for seven and then restricting England to 260 for eight. 

The New Zealand batsmen set up the win, with Lou Vincent (76) and Ross Taylor (71) sharing a 137-run stand for the third wicket and Jacob Oram slamming 54 not out from 33 balls near the end. 

Oram smashed 22 off the penultimate over and 35 off his last ten balls and helped lift New Zealand to their highest-ever total against England in an ODI. 

Ed Joyce anchored the top of the England order, hitting 66 from 82 balls and sharing a 72-run second-wicket stand with Ian Bell (31). 

He continued with Strauss (12) and Paul Collingwood (17) before being run out with the total at 136. 

Andrew Flintoff failed again with the bat, clean bowled by Vettori when he tried to hit across the line. 

But Paul Nixons chancy 49 ensured New Zealand would not gain a bonus point when England surpassed 255 runs in the last over. 

Nixon was caught in the deep when he swiped Shane Bond to Jacob Oram on the last ball. 

Vettori returned two for 40 in 10 overs and Craig McMillan had two for 38.

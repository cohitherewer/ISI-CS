 McGrath likes Barbados track

Bridgetown: Australia fast bowler Glenn McGrath gave the World Cup final wicket at the Kingston Oval the thumbs up after taking three wickets in the mauling of Ireland on Friday. 

Paceman Shaun Tait also claimed three victims, taking advantage of a track which gave plenty of encouragement to the fast bowlers. 

There was a lot more bounce in this wicket than we have had in the other places around the West Indies, said Man-of-the-Match McGrath. 

I felt the wicket was pretty good, good bounce, good carry early on. There were a few that kept a bit low so hopefully for the final it will be a bit more consistent, he said. 

McGrath said he was particularly pleased to see a lively track at one of pace bowlings traditional homes. 

I look back mainly at the Tests. In 1995 the wicket here had good carry, good pace and good bounce 1999 was still okay but 2003 was one of the slowest wickets I have ever played on. (Reuters)

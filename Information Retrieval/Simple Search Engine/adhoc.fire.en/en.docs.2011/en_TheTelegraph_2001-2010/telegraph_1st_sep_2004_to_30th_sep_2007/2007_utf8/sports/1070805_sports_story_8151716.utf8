 Akhtar, Afridi shun ICL 

 offer

 - Eight players sign new PCB contracts 

Karachi: Shoaib Akhtar and Shahid Afridi have turned down million-dollar offers to play in the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL). 

I got an offer, but to me, playing for Pakistan is more important. We have some important assignments coming up and I want to play a big role in those, Shoaib said. I can play for two to three years for my country and I dont want to sacrifice those years. 

Afridi also followed the example of his teammate in rejecting the rebel league offer. 

It was a tempting offer but I see a strong future for myself in the Pakistan team. I dont want to let my fans down, said Afridi. 

Afridi claimed he was made a Rs 90-million offer and earlier had said he would take time to decide on the matter. 

Earlier, Mohammed Asif also rejected a Rs 100 million offer from the ICL. There is no doubt that Pakistan have given me a lot of fame and money and I owe it all to my country. I dont think there is a bigger honour and pride than wearing Pakistan colours, Asif said. 

The PCB, meanwhile, on Saturday offered lucrative financial incentives in its new central contracts to stop players from being lured by the ICL. 

The new contracts carry monthly retainers of Rs 250,000, 150,000 and 100,000 in three categories, besides several performance-based incentives for the 20 players, team manager Talat Ali said. 

Ali said eight players Akhtar, captain Shoaib Malik, Imran Farhat, Mohammad Hafeez, Asif, Umar Gul, Kamran Akmal and Yasir Hameed signed the contract. 

The ones who didnt sign are those based in Karachi and couldnt attend the meeting, Ali said. Pakistan cricketers have also been guaranteed huge bonuses for beating India in the upcoming series.

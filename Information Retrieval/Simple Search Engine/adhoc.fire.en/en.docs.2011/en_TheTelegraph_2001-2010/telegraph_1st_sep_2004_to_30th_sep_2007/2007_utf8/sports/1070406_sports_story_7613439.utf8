The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 You can bet on an Indian succeeding Greg

Christopher Martin-Jenkins

The World Cup is approximately at its halfway point and on Wednesday Greg Chappell became the first coach to lose his job. Bob Woolmer would have resigned as Pakistan coach in search of an easier life after the tournament, which only makes his death all the more tragic. 

Chappell resigned as Indias coach, almost certainly before he was pushed back to Australia by the BCCI, whose own complacent and often disgraceful conduct for example in the distribution of Test venues and the gross failure to invest any of its enormous wealth in its own headquarters, the dilapidated Test ground in Mumbai should be cause for change. 

Already it is being faced by a commercial challenge from the parent company of the disaffected Zee television group, which plans to set up a professional league, purportedly to sharpen up domestic cricket. 

Given the extreme passions in Indian cricket, one of the more remarkable achievements of recent years was the survival as coach for four years of John Wright, the amiable New Zealander. Chappell was appointed his successor in May 2005 ahead of three others on a shortlist, Tom Moody, Desmond Haynes and Mohinder Amarnath. 

It is a safe bet now that having had six years of what one might call southern hemispherisation, whoever now chooses Chappells successor will go for an Indian. He will be well paid, perhaps even leapfrogging the best-paid coach in world cricket, Duncan Fletcher at more than pounds 300,000 a year. He will be trusted for longer, perhaps, if he is au fait with developments in the contemporary game but untainted by any suspicion of corruption. 

India and Pakistan, who are also certain to look to one of their own, are not the only countries who will be seeking new coaches by the end of this month. Most of the incumbents are either under threat or approaching the end of their contracts. The Australian, Bennett King, is under pressure because of his perceived failure to improve the West Indies; Dav Whatmore, guide to Bangladesh, has options; and only John Bracewell, of New Zealand, and Micky Arthur, of South Africa, are secure. 

Moodys contract ends in May. He has got the best out of a gifted Sri Lanka team, formed a good partnership with Mahela Jayawardene, the captain, and encouraged more consistency in selection. He will consider a renewed offer from Sri Lanka but his obvious qualities must interest the ECB if Fletcher either resigns or is dismissed (at the cost of a year of his salary) after the World Cup. 

Moody told the Australian Cricket Board that he did not want to be considered as John Buchanans successor, a job that has gone to Tim Neilsen, the former director of Australias academy. Peter Moores might like more time than he has had in the same role in England and Wales, having taken over from Rod Marsh in 2005, but could be appointed temporarily as England coach before the first Test against West Indies at Lords next month. Moody would talk to the ECB if it approaches him. 

If England could only have shown more often since 2005 the intensity that they brought to Wednesdays match against Sri Lanka in Antigua, Fletchers position might not be in doubt. As a coach who selects teams and likes to manage them, he cannot be absolved from responsibility for the failures in those two areas before and during the tour of Australia.

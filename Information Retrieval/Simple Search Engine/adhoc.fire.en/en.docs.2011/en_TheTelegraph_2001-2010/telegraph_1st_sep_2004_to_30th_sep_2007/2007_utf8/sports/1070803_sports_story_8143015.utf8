 Dola in semis

New Delhi: Seasoned archer Dola Banerjee reached semi-finals of the womens recurve individual category at the Meteksan Archery World Cup in Dover on Thursday. 

In a field of eight archers, Dola scored a narrow victory over Elena Tonetta of Italy to book a berth in the last four stage. Both the archers shot 109 each to drag the encounter into tie-breaker, where the Indian ace got the better of the Italian (9-6). In the semis, Dola will meet Malgorzata Cwienczek of Poland. 

Chekrovolu Swuro, however, lost her opening clash against Polish competitor Justyna Mospinek (105-108) to crash out of the event. (PTI)

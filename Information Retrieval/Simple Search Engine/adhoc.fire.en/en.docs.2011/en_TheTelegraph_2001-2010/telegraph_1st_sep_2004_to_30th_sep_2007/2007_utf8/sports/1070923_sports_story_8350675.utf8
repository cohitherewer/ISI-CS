 Gul, Nazir power Pak to final

Cape Town: Umar Gul was the wrecker-in-chief with his three-wicket haul before Imran Nazir blunted the New Zealand attack with a belligerent half century as Pakistan won by six wickets to storm into the final of the ICC World Twenty20 here on Saturday. 

Batting first, New Zealand got a good start, but a rain-interruption and Guls devastating spell, left them gasping for breath. Ross Taylor top scored with an unbeaten 37 but New Zealand could only manage 143 for eight in their allotted 20 overs. 

Chasing a modest target, Pakistan got off to a flying start with openers Imran Nazir and Mohammed Hafeez putting on a 60-run opening stand in just seven overs, which laid the foundation for a facile win. 

Opener Hafeez hit Shane Bond for a four in the first delivery of the innings. Nazir (59 off 41 balls, 3x4, 5x6) made his intentions clear too, hitting Mark Gillespie for three boundaries in the next over. The pair then started dealing in sixes with Bond, Vettori and Gillespie at the receiving end of their fury. 

The partnership was broken by Scott Styris, who trapped Hafeez leg before. Pakistan lost their first wicket at 60 in 7.1 overs. 

Jeetan Patel the removed Nazir, and in the next over, Vettori had Younis Khan (4) stumped. But there was no stopping Pakistan. 

Bond cut short Shahid Afridis (6) stay but Shoaib Malik (26) and Misbah-ul Haq (16) guided them to victory with seven balls to spare. Malik hit Patel for a huge six over mid wicket to score the winning runs. 

Earlier, Guls three for 15, following a rain interruption, wrecked the Kiwi middle-order. New Zealand, who were going great guns at 50 for no loss, slumped to 126 for eight. 

It was Ross Taylors unbeaten 23-ball knock of 37, studded with two fours and as many sixes, which took them to 143 for eight. 

Daniel Vettori won the toss and decided to bat and had enough reason to feel vindicated as openers Lou Vincent (28) and Brendan McCullum (26) cruised to 44 in 6.2 overs before a rain delay halted the proceedings. 

The interruption clearly shattered the rhythm and snapped the momentum as Vincent offered a return catch to Fawad Alam. 

McCullum joined him in the pavilion three overs later with first change bowler Afridi doing the trick. 

Man of the Match Gul then struck back-to-back blows by removing Styris (18) and Peter Fulton (10) in a span of three balls to leave New Zealand in tatters. 

Taylor and Craig McMillan (12) just seemed to have stemmed the rot when New Zealand suffered another mini-collapse with the next three runs costing them as many wickets. 

Fawad removed McMillan and Gul got his third victim in Jacob Oram (1) before a mix-up ended Vettoris (0) stay in the middle. Bond too was run out for five.

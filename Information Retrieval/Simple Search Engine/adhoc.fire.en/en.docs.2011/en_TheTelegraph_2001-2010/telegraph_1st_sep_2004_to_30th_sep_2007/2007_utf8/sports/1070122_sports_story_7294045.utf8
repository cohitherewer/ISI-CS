The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Impact will be felt in dressing room 

 - Sourav's awesome return in ODIs too

Lucknow: Being politically correct in the dressing room is part of the settling down process for a one-time captain returning as an ordinary player. In fact, teammates also tend to be correct while interacting with him. 

Exactly a year ago, Sourav Ganguly had been wary of opening his mouth (at least not beyond a point) on Team Indias tour of Pakistan. It had been a comeback for him. 

Equally, teammates were careful, lest... 

The atmosphere was better when Sourav joined the Rahul Dravids as a Test specialist in South Africa last month. It has to improve appreciably after his superb 98 on Sunday. 

A performer, after all, walks around somewhat differently in the dressing room. Those whove been part of it from Nagpur to Napier will quickly confirm. 

Ive been made to feel comfortable, is what Sourav told The Telegraph in South Africa. Yet, hed been making an effort to not overreach himself, except the odd occasion like forgetting he wasnt the captain on the fourth afternoon of the Cape Town Test. 

Dravid wasnt too pleased, though, and that got picked up by the stump microphone. 

Sourav, of course, returned as Indias highest run-getter in the Test series and even if somebody didnt like him, he would have to do a swallowing-act. 

Indeed, after an awesome return in ODIs as well, it may gradually be back to the good old days when Sourav was quite like a tiger in the dressing room. 

Footnote: As many as 41 ODIs were played in the 16 months that Sourav was kept out. With his comeback ending the heart-wrenching run of six defeats (two at home, the rest in South Africa), the question to be asked is: Was it necessary for the previous selection committee to have had a one-point (keep Sourav out) agenda? Perhaps, Kiran More can enlighten us.

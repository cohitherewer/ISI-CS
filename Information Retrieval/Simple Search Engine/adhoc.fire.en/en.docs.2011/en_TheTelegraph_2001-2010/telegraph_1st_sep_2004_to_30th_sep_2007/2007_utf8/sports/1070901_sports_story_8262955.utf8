 Henin in Round IV, Safin crashes out

 Justine Henin after winning her third round match on Friday 

New York: Top seed Justine Henin became the first woman to reach the fourth round of the US Open on Friday when she crushed Russian qualifier Ekaterina Makarova 6-0, 6-2. 

The Belgian, champion in 2003, needed just 50 minutes to claim her place in the last 16, where she will play 15th seed Dinara Safina of Russia or American wildcard Ahsha Rolle. 

Marat Safins association with the US Open came to an abrupt end on Friday when the Russian lost in the second round. The former Australian Open champion and the 25th seed here was routed in straight sets 3-6, 3-6, 3-6 by Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland. 

A cramping Novak Djokovic, however, outlasted Czech Radek Stepanek in a titanic second-round battle, winning 6-7, 7-6, 5-7, 7-5, 7-6 after four hours 44 minutes. 

The 17th seed Carlos Moya of Spain also moved into Round III, beating Russias Igor Kunitsyn 6-4, 6-4, 7-5. 

Earlier, James Blake finally managed to win a fifth set. 

Blake ended his 0-for-9 drought in matches that go the distance, outlasting Fabrice Santoro 6-4, 3-6, 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 in the second round to win a 3-hour, 25-minute struggle. 

There used to be a big monkey right there, Blake said, pointing to his back, and now its gone. I got the monkey off my back. I got a five-setter. 

Three of Blakes previous fifth-set flops came at Flushing Meadows, including against Andre Agassi in 2005. 

Ive had so many close ones here so many little things not going my way, Blake said. 

Blakes US Davis Cup teammate, No. 5 Andy Roddick, advanced earlier Thursday when Jose Acasuso retired with a knee injury. 

Roddick turned 25 on Thursday and marked the occasion by reaching the third round, although not before losing the opening set. But Acasuso soon succumbed to injury. 

Acasusos left knee was strapped below the knee in the second set. The score was 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 when Acasuso decided he couldnt continue. 

Earlier Thursday, Martina Hingis beat 106th-ranked Pauline Parmentier of France. The pair traded six straight service breaks before the Swiss won 6-2, 7-5. 

Parmentier was two points from winning the second set when Hingis held serve to tie it 5-all. With temperatures in the low 30s, the 16th-seeded Hingis took control. 

The fourth-seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova didnt dally in beating Camille Pin of France 6-3, 4-6, 6-0. The former US Open champion seemed especially determined after missing an easy forehand that lost the second set. 

Nicole Vaidisova had the loudest shot of the day session. The 13th-seeded Czech severely bent her racket when she slammed it into a chair during a changeover, then came back to sweep a tiebreaker and beat Flavia Pennetta of Italy 6-2, 7-6 (0). 

Bowing out of the tournament, at least in singles, was Bethanie Mattek. 

Wearing a low-cut silver top and headdress that semi-resembled her gold Wonder Woman-inspired ensemble in the first round, Mattek lost to No. 18 Shahar Peer of Israel 2-6, 1-6. 

In other matches, No. 4 Nikolay Davydenko disposed of Germanys Nicolas Kiefer 6-2, 6-2, 6-2 and No. 10 Tommy Haas beat fellow German Philipp Petzschner 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 7-5.

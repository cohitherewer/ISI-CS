 Bashars warning to India, Lanka

Montego Bay: Bangladesh skipper Habibul Bashar is quietly confident that his side would be more than a match for two of the formidable teams from the sub-continent, India and Sri Lanka, when group matches of the World Cup unroll from Tuesday. 

In one-day cricket, anything can happen. So we want to take our chances. Lets see what happens, remarked Bashar. 

Bangladesh have put the participating nations, more so India and Sri Lanka, in the tournament on alert after they beat New Zealand in a practice game earlier this week. 

Bashar admits that both India and Sri Lanka, placed alongside them in group B, are playing good cricket and would be difficult to beat. But, he hopes that his side will do everything to progress to the second round. 

They are playing very good cricket, but we have played them often to know their strengths and weaknesses. There is no discernible weakness though but we are quietly confident, he said. 

Bashar feels there are quite a few things which are working to his teams advantage at the moment. 

We have some decent spinners and as everyone feels the wickets here are going to be a help to them, I think we have an advantage in that area. 

We then have quite a few batsmen who have experience and promise and who are determined to do well, said Bashar, mentioning Shahriar Nafees, the solid opener who has had a wonderful time with the bat last year. 

Bashar also acknowledged the advantage his side gained by turning up in the Caribbean a bit earlier than other teams. 

We came here early in order to prepare for a triangular series and it has helped our preparations, he said. (PTI)

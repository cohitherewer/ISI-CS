 Protests greet Sachin, Zaheer in Ahmedabad 

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Ahmedabad: Maestro Sachin Tendular, Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar had a taste of declining popularity as they faced angry protests in Ahmedabad for the poor performance in the World Cup. 

The protesters, awaiting outside a hotel near airport where the cricketers are staying, shouted slogans against Sachin, Zaheer, Agarkar as soon as they arrived here at 2.30 pm. 

Go back Sachin, go back Agarkar, go back Zaheer. Come to the city only after wining the 2011 World Cup, shouted the fans. The stars are here to play All India Twenty20 championship. 

The protest, led by student leader George Dias, was organised to vent their anger at what they called senior cricketers who are allegedly harassing junior players and are busy doing their modelling assignments instead of concentrating on the game. 

The protesters also condemned selectors for adopting alleged regional approach, ignoring the budding junior cricketers. Dias, an LLB student, said the protest was organised to convey the senior cricketers to stop modelling and match fixing if they want to play cricket. 

Even as Sachin, Zaheer, Agarkar and others checked in the hotel, the protesters continued shouting slogans for about 15 minutes, prompting the police to chase them away. Security arrangements for the players have been beefed up.

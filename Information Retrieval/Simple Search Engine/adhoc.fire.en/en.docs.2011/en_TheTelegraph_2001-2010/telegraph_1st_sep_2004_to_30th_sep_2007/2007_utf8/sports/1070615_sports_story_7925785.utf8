 Pakistan board also wants inquiry into the mess-up

Karachi: Miffed with pathologist Ere Seshaiah for continuing to insist that Bob Woolmer was murdered, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Wednesday called on Jamaica police to initiate an internal inquiry into the mess caused by his autopsy report. 

A senior PCB official said Seshaiahs statement was a disappointment. 

We do not want to comment on it as we want this matter closed now. It has already caused enough heartbreak and trauma. But yes, we would expect the Jamaican authorities to hold an internal inquiry into this mess-up, PCB director (cricket operations) Zakir Khan said. 

He maintained the PCB would not initiate legal action against Jamaica police or Seshaiah but would want the Jamaican authorities to analyse their handling of the case. It would be good if they took a look at what went wrong and held an inquiry. Because this entire episode was a source of pressure for us. 

The PCB has also decided to make a clean break from the Woolmer coaching era and has not renewed the contracts of his support staff trainer Murray Stevenson and physiotherapist Darren Lifsun. 

Both were brought from South Africa by Woolmer who joined as coach in June 2004. 

 Their contracts ended in June as Woolmers would have done and they have not been renewed. We are now looking to make a fresh start with a new support team, Zakir said. 

The board has sent their players to the hill station town of Abbotabad for a conditioning and training camp to prepare for one-day matches in Scotland next month against India, Scotland and possibly a World XI. (PTI)

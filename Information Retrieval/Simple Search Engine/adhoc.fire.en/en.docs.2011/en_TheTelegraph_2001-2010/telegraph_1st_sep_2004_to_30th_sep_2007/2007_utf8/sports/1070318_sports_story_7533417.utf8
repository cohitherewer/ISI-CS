The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Air India hold Md. Sporting 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: As far as team standings are concerned, it will be apt to say that Air India were held 3-3 by the Mohammedan Sporting in their ninth round National Football League match for the ONGC Cup. Actually, the black-and-whites were denied a solid victory at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. 

Samson Singh drew the first blood for Air India in the 37th minute before bolstering the lead in the 52nd minute. But the Mohammedan Sporting boys, under new coach Biswajit Bhattacharya, fought back to make it 2-2 by 70th minute. Guy Ndem Herve converted a spot kick in the 57th minute while substitute Basudeb Mondal restored parity 13 minutes later. 

A brilliant header by substitute Raman Vijayan saw the local outfit take a 3-2 lead for the first time in the match. When everyone thought of a superb Mohammedan Sporting victory, Bashiru M Abbas of Air India spoilt the party, netting the equaliser in the 82nd minute.

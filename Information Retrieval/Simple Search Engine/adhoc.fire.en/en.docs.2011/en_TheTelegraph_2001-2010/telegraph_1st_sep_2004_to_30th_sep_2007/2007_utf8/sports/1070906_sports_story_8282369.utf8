 Pakistan crush Kenya

Nairobi: Pakistan beat Kenya by eight wickets to end the hosts miserable run in the four-nation Twenty20 International tournament at the Nairobi Gymkhana Club here. 

Only three Kenyan batsmen reached double figures after the Pakistan pace and spin attack flayed their batting line-up before they were bundled out for a humiliating 92 after winning the toss. 

David Obuya hit Shoaib Akhtar for four in the second ball of the first over but the Pakistani paceman had the last laugh when he removed the opener and his partner Jimmy Kamande with only seven runs on the board. 

The introduction of spin accelerated Kenyas steady decline with Younis Khan playing a match-winning role by snapping up three wickets for 18 in a mean 3.4-over spell. 

Abdur Rehman added two more wickets including the scalp of stand-in captain Thomas Odoyo for five and Tony Suji for four to reduce the hosts to 35 for five. 

Pakistan skipper Shoaib Malik led from the front and despite losing Mohammed Haffez pushed his team towards the target of 93 for two with 36 balls remaining. 

Pakistan finished unbeaten which augurs well for their new coach Geoff Lawson ahead of this months inaugural ICC World Twenty20 championships in South Africa. 

We have had excellent preparations for the world championships in very good conditions, said the former Australian pace bowler.

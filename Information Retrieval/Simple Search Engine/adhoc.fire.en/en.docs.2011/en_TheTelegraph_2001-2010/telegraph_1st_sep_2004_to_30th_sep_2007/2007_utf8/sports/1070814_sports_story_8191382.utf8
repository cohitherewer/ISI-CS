The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dravid pragmatic, says British media

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: From accusing Rahul Dravid of conservatism and misplaced apprehensiveness to praising his decision as pragmatic and one driven by the need of the hour, the British media didnt lack an opinion when it came to discussing Team India captains move not to enforce the follow-on on Day IV at the Oval. However, the general view was that Dravid had done the right thing by erring on the side of caution. The following are excerpts from what the newspapers had to say on Monday (in alphabetical order): 

THE DAILY MIRROR: The truth in his heart was for India to avoid defeat first and then think about winning later and why not? Of course India could still win the game and then the series 2-0 if England are cleaned up for a second time. Rather than enforce the follow-on with its less than five per cent chance of backfiring, Dravid asked his openers to strap on their pads and seal the game beyond doubt. 

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH: There was much speculation before the days play (Sunday) about whether India would enforce the follow-on. We should have known better. Rahul Dravid was always going to take the safety-first option and bat England out of the match. Michael Vaughan admitted he would probably have done the same in their position. Sourav Ganguly, more of a chancer, probably thought differently. 

THE GUARDIAN: Should England draw the match there may be those in India who will accuse Dravid of conservatism, apprehension even, in his decision not to enforce the follow-on. His options were two-fold. First, to recognise an opposition down on its uppers, lacking in confidence , and ask them to bat again. The alternative, though, to bat again despite the huge advantage already achieved, was more attractive to Dravid. 

THE INDEPENDENT: India would have enforced the follow-on had they needed a victory to win the series, but Dravid opted to give his bowlers a rest and put the Test out of Englands reach before trying to win it. The decision may not have been the most positive ever made, but his primary duty is to ensure that his side leaves here as series victors. 

THE TIMES: As a keen student of the game, Dravid would doubtless have been aware of the Ovals often capricious nature in the fourth innings. With a series to be won, no one back home in India will blame him for taking the safe option.

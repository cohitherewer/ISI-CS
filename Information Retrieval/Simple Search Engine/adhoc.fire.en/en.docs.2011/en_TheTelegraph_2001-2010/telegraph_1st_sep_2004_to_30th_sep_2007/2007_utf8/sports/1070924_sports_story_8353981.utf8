The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Yuvraj thanks the Almighty

Durban: His breathtaking form has not just stunned opponents but Yuvraj Singh himself has been left surprised by his dream run at the ICC World Twenty20. 

I never thought that I could play like this. It is Gods benevolence that I am batting like this. Hopefully, if I continue like this in the final too, it will be good for the team. I am hitting the ball well, and I am very happy, he said after India beat Australia in the semi-finals. 

Yuvraj, whose inspirational innings set the tone for Indias fightback after a slow start, said doing well against top teams has instilled self belief in the team. 

This win means a lot to us. Australia were playing a full side, so beating them has given us a lot of confidence. A lot of people didnt believe in us. We summoned our self belief and came up with a victory. 

This is a brilliant moment for us. When you beat a big team like South Africa in South Africa, or Australia overseas the confidence is bound to go up. You tend to believe in yourself that you can do it again, he said. 

We wanted a good start, not lose too many wickets early on. When the time was right, we went after their bowlers. We played positive cricket. 

In Twenty20, you dont have too much time, but you have certain targets against specific teams. However, it is important, whatever format you play, that you do not lose early wickets. (PTI)

 Sachin down with flu

Bangalore: Sachin Tendulkar was suspected to be laid low with flu after failing to attend the third days session at the conditioning camp here. 

I think hes down with flu, said Yuvraj Singh at a media conference. 

There was no official communication from the team management. 

The Indians are to play three ODIs against South Africa in Belfast (June 26 to 30), another against Pakistan in Glasgow (July 1), before moving to England for a full-fledged series (July 7 to September 8). 

Fridays day-long session included pairs batting together for eight overs each after being set a target of 44. 

Pace spearhead Zaheer Khan had his first stint with the ball after joining the camp, albeit for a while. 

Zaheer did not bowl on the first two days of the ongoing camp, after sustaining a groin injury that forced him to miss the third Afro-Asia Cup clash in Chennai on June 10. 

The MRI taken later had turned out to be clear.

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan are fighting to plunge into relegation zone despite the improved performance of late, while East Bengal are in the championship race the recent loss notwithstanding. 

The green-and-maroons will be under new coach Bernard Oparanozie the fourth this season while for the red-and-golds, its been a steady time with Roberto Carlos Pareira. 

As Calcuttas Big Two prepare to go into Sundays ONGC National Football League (NFL) derby to be watched by none other than Fifa president Joseph Sepp Blatter the juxtaposition could not have been more interesting. 

To add more spice to the contest is the revenge-factor. Mohun Bagan will be desperate to settle scores after having lost to their age-old rivals 0-1 in the first leg. 

Makeshift coach Bernard has already sounded a warning to the rival camp. We are going to take revenge There are no two ways about it. Were playing for a win, and only a win, remarked Bernand. 

The silver lining, as far as the Nigerian is concerned, is the teams fine recent form. Mohun Bagan have done well in the AFC Cup, being unbeaten so far. And as far as the NFL is concerned, Bhaichung Bhutias late goal helped the team snatch a crucial point from holders Mahindra United in their last match game. That is being counted as a big morale-booster. 

We are definitely in a better frame of mind. They (East Bengal) lost their last match, while weve won abroad, which definitely matters, said Bernard. 

One more advantage for Mohun Bagan is the fact that everyone is in the pink of health. So a dream team will take the field against a wary East Bengal. Bhaichung, unlike the last time, is a hundred per cent fit and raring to go. So is Jose Ramirez Barreto, who hasnt quite distinguished himself this season. 

Only Fabio Cortez Vidal and Tomba Singh are ruled out from the squad, informed the coach. 

Bernard, who will be assisted by Bhaichung and Barreto, has had a detailed talk with the players about what team strategy should be on Sunday. Ive not had much time to settle What I see from our past matches is that weve missed more chances than the number of goals conceded. My role would be to give them some sort of confidence, which will translate into performance on the field, explained Bernard. 

Asked what he thinks is the plus-point of the opponents, Bernard said they play freely with everybody contributing. There is no particular player Even Edmilson (Marques) cant score if he does not get the pass. Weve to restrict that, the coach said. 

Edmilson, incidentally, is the leading scorer of the NFL with Churchill Brothers Odafa Okolie (10 goals each). 

The 2-3 loss to Churchill the other day was not the ideal result before Sundays big game. 

Pareira believes a win is essential for East Bengal who are currently third with 22 points to stay on title-track. 

The points are equally important for Mohun Bagan, who are at the other end of the scale with 13 points.

 England pay for inexperience

DEREK PRINGLE IN GROS ISLET

England continued their appalling World Cup record against Test-playing sides when they lost their opening match against New Zealand by six wickets on Friday (as briefly reported in Saturdays CM edition). Always second-favourites after posting a paltry 209 for seven, their misery was complete when Scott Styris and Jacob Oram overcame the loss of early wickets to see their team home with nine overs to spare. 

The defeat, while indisputably making life much harder for Michael Vaughans team, is not totally disastrous. Providing they beat the two minnows in their group, their position is not irretrievable. To reach the semi-finals, they will probably need to win at least three of their six games in the Super Eight stage against top-notch opposition. 

If their recent heroics in Australia will bring succour, their record in recent World Cups reveals just two wins against Test sides in their last 12 games. Tricky too for England, given the sluggish pitches, that the second stage is likely to contain three Asian teams. 

Their inexperience compared to the major sides also suggests they will struggle. In this game alone, England gave away more than a two-to-one advantage on caps, their total of 516 dwarfed by New Zealands 1,212. 

The little and large show the stocky Styris and six-foot, six-inch Oram came together when New Zealand were struggling at 72 for four, following a three-wicket opening strike by James Anderson and Liam Plunkett. Less savvy men might have buckled, but the pair, with 218 one-day caps between them, barely raised their pulses as they put on 138 to win the game and take two precious points with them into the next round. 

Unbeaten on 87, Styris was dropped on 61 by Kevin Pietersen at extra cover off Monty Panesar, whod earlier removed Craig McMillan with his second ball in World Cup. With New Zealand on 148 for three at that time, Styris dismissal might have made matters interesting, though with Orams strokeplay growing in majesty, it would probably have only delayed the inevitable. 

While it is obvious Englands bowling had more than a green tinge to it, despite their stirring effort at the start of New Zealands innings when Anderson and Plunkett shared three wickets in the opening five overs, it was the experienced middle-order that cost England a more competitive total, after Stephen Fleming put them in bat on a sluggish surface. 

Never an easy pitch to make runs on, England should still have made at least 40-50 runs more than they did. Their middle-order of Pietersen, Paul Collingwood and Andrew Flintoff is potentially one of the best in world cricket, but on this occasion they were hardly the three wise men. Although helping to steer England out of some early bother, the trio fell in the space of seven balls, big Freddie for a first-ball duck. 

With Jamie Dalrymple following soon after, the collapse saw England in danger of making one of their lowest World Cup scores, at least until Paul Nixon and Plunkett added a run-a-ball to get the total past 200. 

The rot began when Collingwood was caught-behind by Brendon McCullum as he tried to guide Styris down to thirdman. Pietersen followed three balls later, casually driving Shane Bond to long-on while Flintoff, checking his push to a slower ball from the same bowler, was caught at extra cover. 

The reasons for such moments of madness are not always obvious, though the collapse coincided with the removal of New Zealands two spinners from the attack, which suggests the batsmen felt theyd seen off the dangermen.

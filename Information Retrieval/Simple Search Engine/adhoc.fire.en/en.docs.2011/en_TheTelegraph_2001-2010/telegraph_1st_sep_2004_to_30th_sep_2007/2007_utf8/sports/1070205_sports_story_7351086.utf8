 Digvijay finishes tied 11th

 PhilippinesOpen 

Manila: A double bogey towards the end cost Digvijay Singh a chance to grab a top-10 finish at the Philippines Open golf tournament. 

Digvijay, two-under after 16 holes, dropped a double bogey on 17th and finished with a round of 72 to total even 288 and finish tied 11th with five others as the tough course conditions took toll on players on the final day at the Wack Wack Golf and Country Club, on Sunday. 

Frankie Minoza led a one-two for Philippines as he turned the clock back with a gritty 71 that helped him hold off a sensational back nine charge by another Filipino Gerald Rosales. Minoza started bogey-bogey but managed to regain composure and ended with five birdies and four bogeys for a 71. 

Rosales was six-under for back nine, including an eagle on par-5 14th. His round was seven-under 65 as he raced to eight-under to finish sole second after being sixth overnight. 

Gurbaaz Mann slipped from overnight fourth to tied 36th as he shot 81, while Uttam Singh Mundy (75) was tied 47th and Arjun Singh (74) was tied 60th. Liang Wen-Chong, who led early in the tournament, shot a 75 and ended third at five-under. 

For Digvijay, it was the second good result in as many outings this season. He was tied 15th at Pakistan after being inside top-10 for the early part of the tournament. The same happened here in first round when he shot a 69, but slipped thereafter in tough conditions. 

Gurbaaz disappointed with a series of mistakes and suffered from a lapse of concentration as he ended with a nine-over 81. He shot three double bogeys, one triple and three other bogeys besides three birdies. He slid from overnight fourth to tied 36th. 

Uttam Singh Mundy shot 75 with one triple bogey, three bogeys and three birdies as he totalled eight-over 296 and was tied 47th. Arjun Singh also had a triple bogey on par-5 fourth and shot a two-over 74. He was 10-over 298 for the tournament and tied 60th.

 Gangjee ends tied fifth

 Pakistan Open 

Karachi: Rahil Gangjee had a roller-coaster round of one-under 71 as he finished tied fifth after looking good for a better placing in the Asian Tours season-opener, the Pakistan Open, which ended at the Karachi Golf Club on Sunday. 

But there was never any doubt about the winner, as 26-year-old Airil Rizman Zahari kept his cool to complete a two-shot win for his maiden Asian Tour title. 

Gangjee, who began well with four birdies and one bogey in his first seven holes, hit a disastrous patch thereafter as he bogeyed four holes in a row. 

But he regained some ground with a birdie on 11th and had a brilliant eagle on 15th. One more bogey on 17th saw him end at 71 and 10-under 278 for fifth place. 

It did move him from overnight seventh to fifth. 

Ashok Kumar, ninth overnight, also had an up-and-down front nine with three birdies, two bogeys and one double. 

On the back nine, he birdied twice and bogeyed the last for a 71 and at nine-under he was tied seventh. 

Uttam Singh Mundy (69) made a good move up from 21st to tied 10th as he birdied six and bogeyed three holes. 

Vivek Bhandari, another opening day star, also found his form and with a five-under 67, the best card for the day, moved from a lowly 44th to tied 15th. 

S.S.P. Chowrasia also continued his upward move as he scored two-under 70 and ended tied 15th. 

Digvijay Singh was the big disappointment as he started the day tied fifth and opened with a birdie one second. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bagan rally to hold Churchill

A STAFF REPORTER

 Lalawmpuia celebrates the Bagan equaliser on Saturday 

Calcutta: PC Lalawmpuia may not have scored the matchwinner for Mohun Bagan, but his second-half equaliser, which saw the city giants hold Churchill Brothers 1-1 in the 11th National Football League for the ONGC Cup, was as good as one. 

At least the players jubilation, crowd ovation and a pat from coach Chima Okerie conveyed so Lalawmpuia was Mohun Bagans saviour. 

Following their AFC win over Pehang, Mohun Bagan boosted by home support were on a high. But Vanlalkovia Chuaungo of Churchill Brothers had other ideas. 

Adding some excitement to the dull first-half in the match, Chuaungo scored two minutes before the break to give Churchill Brothers the first blood. 

Having missed two chances early in the first-half, Mohun Bagan wore a dejected look as the scoreline read 0-1. 

However, the change in ends saw the local outfit step up the tempo and as fate would have it, they were relieved when Lalawmpuia shot home the equaliser in the 64th minute. 

Even as Mohun Bagan had their share of chances to go up in the dying minutes, Churchill Brothers keeper Vinay Singh proved to be strong enough.

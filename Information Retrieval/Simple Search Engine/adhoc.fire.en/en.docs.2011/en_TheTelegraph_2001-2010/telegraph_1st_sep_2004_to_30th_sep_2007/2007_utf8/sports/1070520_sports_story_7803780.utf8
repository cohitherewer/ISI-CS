 Atwal bows out 

Duluth: Arjun Atwals bid to qualify for weekend action at the AT amp;T Classic failed. The Orlando-based Indian, as well as India-born Swede Daniel Chopra, failed to make the cut at the Greg Norman-designed TPC Sugarloaf. 

Atwal had a decent opening round of 70 that earned him a share of the 22nd spot. But a nightmarish second round of seven-over 79 put paid to his hopes of making the cut. 

Atwals horrendous round included five bogeys and a triple bogey against a lone birdie. 

Chopra fell by the wayside after his round of 73. It saw him finish at even par 144 after 36 holes. Chopra mixed four birdies and five bogeys in his average second round outing. 

American Troy Matteson shot an eight-under 64 to take a share of the second-round lead with Ryuji Imada (67), both totalling 10-under after two days. D.J. Brigman (67) was a stroke back and first-round leader Kevin Sutherland (71) followed at eight-under. Masters champion Zach Johnson (66) was seven-under along with Camilo Villegas (67) and Craig Kanada (70). (PTI)

AC Milan midfielder Kaka looked forward to another head-to-head with Manchester United winger Cristiano Ronaldo by revealing that he dreams of them playing in the same side. 

The two shone in last Tuesdays Champions League semi-final first leg at Old Trafford which United won 3-2 and face each other again at the San Siro in Wednesdays second leg. 

They are widely regarded as being two of the best players in the world and, despite Ronaldo having signed a new contract at United, rumours persist of a possible move to AC Milan or moves for both players to Real Madrid. 

Kaka said: Manchester United are having a great season and have above-average talent, symbolised by Ronaldo, who has renewed his contract. Hes an excellent player with great talent and has everything to succeed. 

Its always good to be part of a team which has excellent players. If one day I had the opportunity to play with Ronaldo, it would be very good. For now, I dont know if it will be at Real Madrid, if it will be at Milan or some other place. Today, Id like it to be at Milan. 

The Brazil international believes Milan are in a good position to beat United and reach the final. He said: It will be an excellent match. We have a great chance to reach the final again. 

Kaka is the top scorer in the Champions League and scored both Milans goals at Old Trafford. He put it down to divine intervention. The goals happened. I had chances to score and fortunately took them. Being able to score so many goals is a present from God. 

Kakas fellow midfielder, Andrea Pirlo, is confident the side is peaking at the right time. Speaking after Saturdays 1-0 win at Torino in Serie A, the Italian said: Now, we are looking ahead to Wednesday with confidence. We are doing well. 

We have reached top condition at just the right moment. We will do well against Manchester United. We expended a lot of energy, but there is time to recover. 

Carlo Ancelotti, the Milan coach, claimed that midfielder Gennaro Gattuso would be fit to face United, but admitted doubts remained about the participation of veteran defender Paolo Maldini.

 Chill Pill has it easy

STAR RACER

Calcutta: Trainer Sanjeev Charans ward, Chill Pill, finally earned her winning bracket when she landed the Gavin Johnston Cup, the main event in Wednesdays race card. Jockey Mark Reuben, who rode a well-judged race, guided the 4-1 chance to an easy victory. In the past, Chill Pill has been a letdown many times. 

Chill Pills victory was, however, made easy by jockey Imran Chisty, riding the favourite Ecstatic Pride. The horse opened as a 12-10 favourite, but his alarmingly expanding odds clearly indicated the jockeys intentions. In the race, too, Chisty hardly looked to be enterprising. As a result, stewards ordered an inquiry into the running and riding of the favourite and handed Chisty a two-day suspension. The afternoon was, however, ruled by outsiders.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Becks still a long way from playing

 GRAHAME L. JONES in TORONTO 

 David Beckham 

David Beckham said Saturday afternoon that it will most likely be a week to 10 days before he is ready to start a game for the Los Angeles Galaxy. 

Speaking at a crowded news conference at the Air Canada Centre, the injured midfielder ruled himself out of the Major League Soccer match against Toronto FC at BMO Field and indicated that at least two upcoming Galaxy games at DC United on Thursday and at the New England Revolution next Sunday are also doubtful propositions. 

All three games are sold out, with fans having expected to see the England star play. 

Beckhams injured left ankle, a combination, he said, of a severe sprain and ligament damage, has limited him to 16 minutes 19 seconds on the field in a Galaxy uniform, and that was two weeks ago in a friendly against Chelsea. He still has not trained with the Galaxy since his introductory news conference on July 13. 

Could it be two, three or four more weeks before he will be able to start? 

No, I dont think itll be that long, Beckham said. I think its maybe a week to 10 days that Ill be looking at. Today, running like I did, was a huge step for me because I hadnt really been able to move on it at all. So its quite a good step. 

The problem is with it being my left ankle and the way my stance is when I kick the ball, when I strike the ball, its putting a lot of stress on that ankle. 

Beckhams pinpoint passes and trademark free kicks are done with his right foot. His left foot carries his weight. 

Galaxy Coach Frank Yallop last week said Beckham was experiencing sharp pain in the ankle at times, and even the limited running that Beckham did behind closed doors Saturday was not without its downside. 

Running straight forward is not a problem, Beckham said, but turning corners is still a problem for me at the moment. 

The injury, sustained in early June while playing for England against Estonia and made worse by playing in subsequent Spanish league games for Real Madrid, also threatens Beckhams immediate national team future. 

England play Germany in a friendly at Wembley on August 22, with that game serving as a warm-up for two important Euro 2008 qualifiers in September. 

LA Galaxys games were sold out long before Beckham was injured Toronto has sold out every game in its inaugural season and tops the league in attendance so Beckhams absence did not affect the crowd other than to disappoint fans who had expected to see him. 

His injury, though, is real, and even Beckhams week to 10 days estimate seems optimistic. 

Theres no point in me coming back and playing in a game where people are going to be expecting me to play at a high level, like I can and like I do, and then not perform, he said. 

Meanwhile, Landon Donovan said the Galaxy players have known all along that Beckhams ankle was in worse shape than advertised. 

I know when he got here (to Los Angeles) it was like a balloon, and you kind of looked at it and went, Is he going to play on that? Donovan said. 

When he played in the Chelsea game it was almost a miracle at that point. He shouldnt have been playing probably. But hes getting a lot better.

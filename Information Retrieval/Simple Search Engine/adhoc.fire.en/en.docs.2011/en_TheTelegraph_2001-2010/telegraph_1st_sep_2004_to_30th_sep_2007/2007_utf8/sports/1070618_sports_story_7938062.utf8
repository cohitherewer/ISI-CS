 Butt appointed Maliks deputy

Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Sunday appointed opener Salman Butt as vice-captain to Shoaib Malik till the end of the year. 

Butt replaced pacer Mohammad Asif who was deputy for the one-day series in Abu Dhabi against Sri Lanka in April. 

The PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf justified the appointment of Butt for the remainder of the year saying it was a move aimed at securing the future of Pakistan cricket. 

We have to start planning for the future. We have lacked in this aspect and have never really prepared replacements. Malik and Butt are both young and compliment each other, he said. (PTI)

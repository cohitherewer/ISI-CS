 Dipendu owes it to coach

 Dipendu is basking in glory 

Ludhiana: Tuesdays Calcutta derby may have been played before criminally poor crowd at the Guru Nanak Stadium here, but the after-effects are on expected lines. 

The first head to roll after Mohun Bagans loss to arch-rivals East Bengal in the semi-final of the Federation Cup is that of Mohammad Gafari. 

In the first two games of the tournament, the Nigerian midfielder had a somewhat average showing. But against East Bengal, a dominant Lalkamal Bhowmick in the centre of Mohun Bagan midfield meant Gafari got upstaged. 

Mohun Bagan, according to secretary Anjan Mitra, are likely to release Gafari after the Calcutta league, but, truth be told, the green-and-maroons never really seemed to have enough confidence in the Nigerian medio. 

Mohun Bagan signing Gafari was at best a desperate attempt. But by the time realisation dawned and they decided to get rid of him, Gafari was armed with a contract and threatened to knock on Fifas doors for justice. 

Mohun Bagan reluctantly accepted him in its fold, and are now conveniently using the shoddy Federation Cup showing to show him the door. 

The off-side goal by Bhaichung Bhutia that was disallowed at the death continued to be the talking point at the Mohun Bagan camp here on Wednesday morning. But till the time Mohun Bagan packed their bags for home, no one was willing to go on record or lodge an official complaint. 

Even Bhaichung, who pointed an accusing finger at referees on Tuesday in a television interview, was tight-lipped throughout even as match officials remained confident that they had got the decision absolutely right. 

Just opposite the Mohun Bagan camp was East Bengal who were enjoying their moments in the team hotel. In Room No 104, a battery of journalists surrounded coach Subrata Bhattacharya and he seemed to enjoy the attention. 

He was at his entertaining best, but the flow was repeatedly disturbed by Subratas cell phone, which continued to ring incessantly. A majority of those who have congratulated me are Mohun Bagan supporters, he said tongue-in-cheek. 

Amidst the high of three back to back wins in the Federation Cup, Subratas feet remained remarkably grounded. It was a good win no doubt, but if we do not finish champions that win will mean nothing, Subrata said putting Mohun Bagan into perspective. 

East Bengal being under pressure for a majority of the second session and goalkeeper Subrata Pauls heroics that saved the day were immediately highlighted. We were under pressure because we do not have good headers in the side. It is the same with the National team, maintained the East Bengal coach. 

Apart from the East Bengal coach, the man who hogged maximum attention was striker Dipendu Biswas, who came as a substitute to play a stellar role in his teams victory. I owe it to the coach, said the seasoned striker. 

He told me to remain mentally prepare to take the responsibility. So, I had no problem when he asked me to go in early in the match.

 West Ham agree to 2 million Tevez deal

Carlos Tevez looks set to finally complete his move to Manchester United after West Ham and the players agent, Kia Joorabchian, agreed a 2 million deal on Thursday to release him from his contract at Upton Park. 

Although the agreement still needs the approval of the Premier League and the Football Association, there was growing confidence from all sides that the tortuous saga was close to a conclusion. 

Under the terms of the agreement, MSI and Just Sports Inc, the two companies who own Tevezs economic rights, will pay West Ham 2 million to effectively buy him out of the remainder of his contract. 

Although Joorabchian, the frontman for MSI and Just Sports, initially tried to resist paying West Ham any money, the Premier League insisted the club receive a fee in recognition of their decision to terminate the third-party deals which landed them in trouble with the League in April. 

As part of the settlement, Joorabchian has agreed to acknowledge that West Ham did in fact own the players registration and had a three-year contract with the 23-year-old striker. 

At the same time, he has agreed to halt his 30m High Court action against the club for ripping up the third-party agreements with MSI and Just Sports to enable Tevez to play in the climax to last seasons Premiership campaign. 

Tevez will now be free to sign for United and is likely to join his new teammates in time for Sundays Community Shield against Chelsea at Wembley. 

Obtaining official clearance for him to play is expected to take a little longer, however. Having spent the last four months dealing with the fallout from the players arrival in English football last August, the Premier League is unlikely to rush his move to Old Trafford. 

However, news of the out-of-court settlement between West Ham and Joorabchian may not be the end of the affair for the League. The revelation on Tuesday that West Ham drew up a new third-party deal for the player on December 1, following Eggert Magnussons takeover at Upton Park, has raised new questions over the Leagues handling of the case against the club, which resulted in a 5.5 million fine rather than a points deduction. 

Kevin McCabe, the chairman of relegated Sheffield United, said he was considering legal action following the emergence of the new document, even though West Ham claim it was never activated because Joorabchian and Tevez failed to sign it until June. 

One of the reasons why West Ham were fined and not docked points by the independent commission in April was that it was all done by the old regime and that the new regime under Eggert Magnusson had clean hands, McCabe said. This document shows that was not the case. The whole thing is a shambles and a disgrace to the national game, and we are weighing up our options.

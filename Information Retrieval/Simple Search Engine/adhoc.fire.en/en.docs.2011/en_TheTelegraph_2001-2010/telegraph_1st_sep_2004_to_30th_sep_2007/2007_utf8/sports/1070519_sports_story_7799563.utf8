 Allan Donald keen on England job

London: Former South African fast bowler Allan Donald has expressed his willingness to join the England coaching team and work with likes of Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff. 

I would love to do that job its a very high-profile job. With all the talent there is in England, around England, it would be fantastic to work with that, the former South Africa quick was quoted as saying by a British television channel on Friday. 

The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has indicated that a bowling coach could be recruited to allow Kevin Shine to focus on the national academy. 

ECBs director of England cricket John Carr said when the board recruited Kevin in early 2006, it was always intended to be a largely Loughborough-based role (at the academy) leading the ECB fast bowling programme. 

Kevin had indicated at the start of the winter that at the end of the World Cup, he wished to revert to the important role that he was originally recruited to perform. 

Donald, who took 330 wickets in 72 Tests and 272 in one-day Internationals during his illustrious career, would undoubtedly strengthen the team around Englands head coach Peter Moores. (PTI)

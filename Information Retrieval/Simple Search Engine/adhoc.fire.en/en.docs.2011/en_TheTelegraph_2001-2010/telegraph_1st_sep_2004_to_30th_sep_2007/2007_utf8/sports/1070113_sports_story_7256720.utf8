 Hair to stand

London: Banned Australian umpire Darrell Hair will stand in two minor counties matches in England next domestic season. 

The Australian, who was removed from The International Cricket Councils (ICC) elite panel in November following the Oval Test fiasco, will officiate the matches in addition to his duties as a member on the England and Wales Cricket Boards reserve list.

 Arjun Atwal tied 45th 

Memphis: Arjun Atwal closed with two birdies in his last three holes to repair the damage of a triple bogey as he finished with a three-over 73 in the opening round of the St Jude Champion- ship. 

As only seven players had sub-par rounds and another 11 were even par at the par-70 layout, Atwal, tied 45th. 

He would have been inside the top-ten but for his triple bogey on fifth. The Indian had four birdies, four bogeys and a triple bogey. 

Swedens Fredrik Jacobson and Australian Adam Scott, who shot three-under-par 67 each, shared the first round lead.

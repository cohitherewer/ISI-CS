 Badrinath: My time will come 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Subramanium Badrinath aspires to become a complete player. 

And every effort and step of his is towards achieving that goal, donning Team India colours apart. See its not in my hands (but the selectors) what is in my hand is to perform consistently and my time will definitely come, said Badrinath, who has been named in the 30-member World Cup probables, overlooking his Tamil Nadu teammate and senior pro Hemang Badani. 

I was very close to making it to the side (for the tour of South Africa) I was in contention for both Tests and one-dayers, Badrinath told The Telegraph at the CCFC on Sunday. 

However, he is not somebody who regrets. Having made a significant mark in The Telegraph Twenty20 Cricket Tournament and leading his side Chemplast Sanmar Ltd to the title, Badrinath has his eyes set on the national one-dayers in South Zone. 

Ask him about his chances of making the final World Cup squad, he answered: Well, its up to selectors as of now Ive not got any news if Im to attend a camp or so.

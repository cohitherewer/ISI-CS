 Nadal spares a thought for food

NICK SZCZEPANIK 

 Nadal 

We know that Rafael Nadal is the King of Clay, a long-haired Spanish player who is a favourite with the ladies and the only man capable of beating Roger Federer, which he has done in the French Open for the past three seasons. But, thanks to Rafas exclusive Wimbledon blog on Times Online, we now know so much more. 

Nadal has been blogging here since the beginning of the tournament and readers are hoping that he will continue to do so all the way to the final. Already they have discovered that, although he was born and lives in Majorca, he supports Real Madrid; that he rents a flat within walking distance of the All England Club with Feliciano Lpez; and that he frequents a Spanish restaurant in the Old Brompton Road whose bookings are sure to escalate as a result. 

Eating is one of Nadals favourite subjects. He has hosted evenings dedicated to Spanish and Italian food and has posted photographs of the occasions on the blog. He does not like tomatoes, but he gets through copious amounts of Nutella, the chocolate spread not previously thought of as a suitable part of the diet of a top sportsman. 

What everyone wants to know is whether Nadal can win Wimbledon. This is the tournament and everybody is fired up to play well, he wrote. I have always said that this tournament is the tournament I would love to win. I also know it is the tournament that is the most difficult for me to win. But I tried and will continue to do so as much as I can. I know it is difficult for me to play on grass and I know I have to change many things, but still I love it, believe me. 

Another of his loves is football, especially Real. I went to see the last league match of Real Madrid (a 3-1 win over Mallorca that sealed the La Liga title) and had a great time there, he wrote. I know I am now in England and I get asked every time about (David) Beckham leaving Real. I am not in the position to judge anything and especially to give an opinion about him leaving or staying in Madrid. I do know that he played great and that he always tried 110 percent. 

Nadal has also replied to questions from readers. One of his answers revealed that he had approached Federer about the possibility of playing doubles together. Yes, I did think about it and asked him to play together in Madrid last October, Nadal wrote. He had already plans to play with (Yves) Allegro and so we could not play. It would have been fun. Maybe another time. 

It takes only one click on the link on the website to send Nadal a question, such as the one from Ella, whose five-year-old son has just started tennis lessons. Any advice for him to improve his game? Only one, Nadal replied. To have fun all the time. Playing, practising, competing. 

And dont forget the Nutella.

 India to open vs Lebanon

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: India have been drawn to play Lebanon in the first round of the World Cup qualifiers, to be played on home-and-away basis. The matches are to be held between October 8 and 28. As per the AFC schedule, India have to play the away match first. 

Lebanon, ranked 135, are relatively easy opponents and India can hope to make it to the second round in November, where they could be pitted against North Korea, who have been drawn to play Mongolia in the first round. 

The World Cup dates are definitely going to jeopardise the calendar back home, especially the Professional League, which was earlier scheduled to start from September 30. In case India make the second round, there is possibility of the Pro League being extended till April or May. 

The dates of the first-round matches, according to AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco, are negotiable.

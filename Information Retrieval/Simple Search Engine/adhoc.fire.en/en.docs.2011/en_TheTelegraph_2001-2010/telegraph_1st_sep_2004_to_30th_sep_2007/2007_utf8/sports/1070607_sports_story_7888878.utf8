Dortmund: Brazil drew 0-0 with Turkey in a friendly international on Tuesday. 

Brazils first-half line-up included only two of the players who started against England in their friendly 1-1 draw at Wembley on Friday. 

Turkey fielded five new players compared with the starting formation in their 2-3 defeat by Bosnia in a Euro 2008 qualifier on Saturday. 

Ronaldinho and Kaka came on for Brazil in the second half, stepping up the pace and bringing more imagination and flair to their game. 

But Turkey had the best chances to score. Hamit Altintops powerful shot from 25 metres hit the crossbar in the 26th minute and his cannonball free-kick from as far out in the 75th minute flew just over the goal. 

Brazil goalkeeper Doni made good saves on shots from Mehmet Aurelio and Yildiray Basturk, both in the first half. 

The match was the fifth between the two countries since they first met in 1956 with Brazil having won three of the previous four and the other ending in a 2-2 draw when they last met in the Confederations Cup in France four years ago. 

Meanwhile, Lionel Messi scored two goals as Argentina held on for a 4-3 win over Algeria in an international friendly played at the Nou Camp stadium in Barcelona. 

The FC Barcelona forward exchanged passes with midfielder Pablo Aimar before scoring the winner in the 74th minute. The 19-year-old Messi also converted a penalty after being brought down by defender Mehdi Meniri in the 55th. 

Argentina led two minutes into the game after striker Carlos Tevez converted a penalty awarded after Majid Bouzid fouled striker Diego Milito. 

Anthar Yahia equalised for Algeria in the 10th, deflecting in a corner, and the Africans went ahead 2-1 lead in the 43rd thanks to Majid Bougherras shot that surprised goalkeeper Roberto Abbondanzieri. 

Two minutes after Messis equaliser, Inter Milan midfielder Esteban Cambiasso connected on a Javier Zanetti cross from the right to push Argentina into the lead for good. 

Nadir Belhadj scored his second of the night in the 75th but the Argentines held on for the win three days after a 1-1 draw with Switzerland in a friendly. (Agencies)

 We deserved to get booed: 

Vaughan 

Bridgetown: Captain Michael Vaughan said England had deserved to be booed off after a crushing nine-wicket defeat by South Africa knocked them out of the World Cup on Tuesday. 

Vaughan, 32, said he would not be retiring from one-day Internationals, but that others would decide if he kept the captaincy. He also said he was unaware if coach Duncan Fletcher was considering quitting. 

It is a very sad day for English cricket. Its a horrible feeling to have walked off the park in Bridgetown and get booed by a lot of England supporters, and rightfully so from the performance weve put in, Vaughan told a news conference after the defeat in the crucial Super Eight match. 

I fully understand why they gave us that sort of reception. We have to hold our hands up and accept all the criticism that comes our way. 

South Africa medium pacer Andrew Hall took five wickets to help dismiss England for 154 before Graeme Smith hit an unbeaten 89 to lead his side to victory in just 19.2 overs. England have struggled all tournament, with Bangladesh being the only Test team they beat. The side arrived in the Caribbean on the back of a 5-0 mauling by Australia in the Ashes test series. 

There needs to be a lot of honesty. We, as an England team, have had a very disappointing six months. I had firmly believed wed do a lot better than we have, rued Vaughan, who has been in poor batting form. 

I wont be retiring from one-day cricket. But Im not stupid to think its not going to be an area of concern. 

The most important thing is that we have to get English cricket back on track. We need a strategy to move forward. Since 1992, England havent produced any good one-day cricket. We need to know why. 

After contesting the 1992 final which they lost to Pakistan England have failed to reach the semis in any of the four subsequent editions. 

Coach Fletcher, who with Vaughan led England to a 2-1 Ashes win in 2005 before results fell away, will come under huge media pressure to resign.His future was due to be discussed at the end of the tournament and former England allrounder Ian Botham was quick to say he should leave. 

Weve got good cricketers but they need a new direction. Duncan Fletcher has done some great things for England over the years but everyone has a shelf life and Im sorry his has expired, Botham told a TV channel. (Reuters)

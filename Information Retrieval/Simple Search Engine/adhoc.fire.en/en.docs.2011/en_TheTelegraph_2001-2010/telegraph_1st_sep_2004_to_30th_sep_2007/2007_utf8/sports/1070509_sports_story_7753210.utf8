 India seek semis berth

Ipoh: India take on Argentina in their concluding league match of the 16th Sultan Azlan Shah Cup hockey tournament on Wednesday with both semi-final berths from their group up for grabs. 

India have three points from their 5-4 win against China, which came after a 0-1 defeat to Australia on the opening day of the eight-nation meet. 

Argentina lead the group A table with six points after their 1-0 win over Australia and a 3-2 triumph over China. 

The Aussies take on China in the first match on Wednesday and the Indians will have the benefit of knowing what is required of them to advance to the semi-finals. 

The game against Argentina will not be a cakewalk, for sure. We need to be on the top of our game and our deep defence will have to perform exceptionally well. We had a bad game against China, committing mistakes inside the circle and conceding nine penalty corners. We cannot afford to play like that against Argentina, Carvalho said. 

Argentina have fielded a young team and are in the process of rebuilding their side. Coach Sergio Roberto Vigil said: The Indians are very skilful and fast. I expect a close match. 

Meanwhile, after a days break, the Indian team was back in training on Tuesday morning. They focused on penalty corners, defence and also dead-ball situations outside the circle, at the two-hour practice session. We committed far too many mistakes against China in these two areas and we are working them, said the Indian coach. 

He also focused on forwards falling back to help the defence. Thus, he had all the 11 players inside the circle, facing free-hits and defending set-piece moves with the forwards forming the first wall of defence. 

The Pakistan-South Korea group B match that was halted due to a power cut on Monday will be completed on Wednesday. (PTI)

 Asia hope to seal series today

 Sourav Ganguly in Chennai on Friday 

Chennai: Already one up in the three-match series, Asia will be hoping for an unassailable 2-0 lead to pocket the Afro-Asia Cup title on Saturday when they cross swords with their African counterparts in the second one-dayer at the floodlit MA Chidambaram Stadium here. 

The weather might play spoilsport as the city, reeling under hot and humid conditions till two days back, is experiencing drizzles since Thursday. The weather office has forecast cloudy sky with the possibility of showers. 

The Indian pair of Sourav Ganguly and Virender Sehwag, who were expected to utilise the tournament to reinforce their claim for berths in the Indian squad bound for Ireland and England, did put up some decent efforts scoring 45 and 32 in the first ODI. 

But they could have used the chance to the hilt had they batted little more cautiously in losing their wickets to rash shots. With the Chepauk pitch expected to assist the batsmen, Sanath Jayasuriya, Sourav, Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh will have the edge against the largely inexperienced African bowling. 

Asia captain Mahela Jayawardene should be happy the way his bowlers performed, particularly new ball bowlers Mohammed Asif, who made a memorable comeback rattling the African top-order with a three-wicket haul and Indias left-arm seamer Zaheer Khan, who gave Asif ample support claiming two wickets. 

The African batting, devoid of match practice in the run up to the tournament, left much to be desired and but for the heroics of South Africas Shaun Pollock, who has opted to be a batsman, their margin of defeat could have been much more. 

The African bowling, lacking teeth in the absence of the likes of Makhaya Ntini added to Pollocks decision not to bowl, had also been ineffective with Morne Morkel proving expensive in Bangalore. 

Chief curator K. Parthasarathy, meanwhile, hinted a run-feast on Saturday. It will be a bouncy wicket. Batsmen known for stroke-play will relish batting as the rise of the ball will be helpful to them. The pitch will behave uniformly throughout the match, he said. 

Accepting that his boys were the underdogs, Africa captain Justin Kemp said they were keen to improve and turn the tide on Asia. 

We will be looking to improve our bowling in the next two games. We will give our best shot. We take pride in everything we do and hopefully we can push the Asians again, Kemp said. Asia are formidable They have some of the big guns. We are always the underdogs.

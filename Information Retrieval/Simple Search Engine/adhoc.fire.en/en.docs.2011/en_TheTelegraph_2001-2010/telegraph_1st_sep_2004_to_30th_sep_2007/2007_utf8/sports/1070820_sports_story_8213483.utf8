The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We can all learn from Zaheer

 - I cant remember so much swing, not even from Vaas or Akram, says Vaughan 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Vaughan says Zaheer alone made it tough for them 

Calcutta: England Test captain Michael Vaughan has singled out Zaheer Khan for lavish praise, saying that the Team India pace spearhead was single-handedly responsible for making life difficult for the hosts in the recently-concluded Test series. 

So impressed was Vaughan with Zaheers performance that he went so far as to say that the Team India senior pro swung the cherry more than even wily Sri Lankan Chaminda Vaas or the iconic former Pakistan captain, Wasim Akram. 

I cant remember so much swing, not even from Vaas or Akram. Sometimes when R.P. Singh was bowling around the wicket it felt as if the ball was starting from third slip, Vaughan was quoted as saying in a London-based weekly on Sunday. 

Vaughan, who scored a classy century in the Trent Bridge Test, also acclaimed Zaheer for imbibing a lot of fresh ideas that the England batsmen found hard to cope with. 

Indians, and Zaheer in particular, deserve a lot of credit for the angles they created and the variety of their bowling, he said. On the last day at the Oval, Zaheer was still swinging the ball both ways. 

Using the traditional method he should have been bowling over the wicket, but he came around to the left-handers. He was changing the angles again. The guys would not have seen that before and I guarantee they would not have practised that. 

Vaughan indicated that had it not been for Zaheer, England wouldnt have been in so much trouble. And more importantly, there was much to learn from him. 

Zaheer and I think he was the man coming up with all the ideas kept doing the unexpected. It was fascinating to watch and something we can all learn from. Thats why the series was hard. We never really knew what was coming next. 

On sledging and the much documented jelly beans incident, Vaughan felt it wasnt such a smart move after all. But he declined to put too much importance to it. 

You get criticised when you lose anyway. And when you come out and do what we did that week, then you have to accept you are going to get more. In County cricket that episode might have been thought of as hilarious, but at the highest level you cant get away with it. We are a young team and we just have to learn from all these experiences. 

The England Test captain, however, insisted that the sledging wasnt planned. 

We talk about mental disintegration. We know the players. For example, we dont say anything to some because that drives them to play better. But we dont sit down beforehand and say, When X comes out to bat well give him a serve. There will be bits of gamesmanship, saying the odd thing. For (Wasim) Jaffer and (Dinesh) Karthik there was always the odd mention of Sehwag waiting to come back into their team.

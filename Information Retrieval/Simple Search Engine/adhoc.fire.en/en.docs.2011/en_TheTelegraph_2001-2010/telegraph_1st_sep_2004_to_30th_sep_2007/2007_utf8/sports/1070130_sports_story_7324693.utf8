The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Raina overwhelmed by Lara gesture

 - WI captain makes time for 20-minute interaction 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Brian Lara

 Young Suresh Raina grew up admiring 

 Brian Laras ability to convert 100s into 200s and 

 much more. And, having become an international cricketer 

 himself, was looking for an opportunity to have a one-on-one 

 with the living legend. 

Lara, after all, holds two of the most awesome records: 501 not out in a single first-class innings (for Warwickshire) and an unbeaten 400 in Tests. 

That chance came rather suddenly, at the Jet Airways Mumbai airport lounge on Monday evening, when the 20-year-old came face to face with the West Indies captain. Till then, Raina had been engrossed with his iPod. 

His face, of course, lit up when Lara (whod walked in with Dwayne Bravo) said Suresh, come over here. 

For the next 20 minutes, as Mahendra Singh Dhoni parked himself on the massage-chair and Bravo tucked into chicken wings, Raina was all ears to what Lara had to say. 

 Wed exchanged hellos 

 in the West Indies last year, lekin itni lambi baat ka 

 mauka nahin mila tha Ive been overwhelmed Im 

 lucky that Brian spoke for 20 minutes, Raina told 

 The Telegraph as he cleared the security check for 

 the 50-minute flight to Vadodara. 

Among other things, Lara asked Raina to think positively and not worry about getting dismissed. Handy tips, to say the least. 

 Suresh Raina

Brian feels Im batting fine, but need to always be confident and not worry about getting out Also, that I must not fail to build an innings once Ive got into the 20s Basically, body language bahut important hai, Raina remarked. 

Lara listed the importance of the elbow positioning as well. 

Its to be seen how much Raina benefits, for he has to make good the ground lost in the last four-five months. Hed been very impressive in his debut season (2005-06) and got marked as a terrific finisher in-the-making, but hasnt really taken his career forward. 

Nevertheless, Raina is a strong contender for one of the berths in the World Cup XV. Some even believe hes a near certainty, thanks in no small measure to his being outstanding in the field. 

Raina didnt get to bat in the first ODI of the current series, in Nagpur, and didnt make the XI in Cuttack. On Saturday, he scored 23 in Chennai. 

 While Lara and Bravo took a break in Mumbai for a 

 commercial shoot, the Indians got a day-and-half off after 

 the third ODI and had to assemble in Vadodara by Monday 

 night. The fourth and final match, with India 2-1 ahead, 

 is on Wednesday. 

 Footnote: Raina, obviously, didnt forget 

 to thank Lara. The latter, too, got to say just that when 

 the fellow-southpaw retrieved the cellphone hed forgotten 

 in the lounge.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Houghtons dig at city clubs

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: National coach Bob Houghton on Friday made a veiled criticism of Calcutta football saying it attaches more importance to club tournaments than the national team. 

Addressing a press conference here, the British coach said he was surprised to find that a match between Mohun Bagan and East Bengal was more important than an international fixture involving the senior national team. 

Last year, when I came here, I was shocked to see that a Calcutta derby was treated above a World Cup qualifier, Houghton said. To my utter disbelief, players were taken away from the camp to play the local league tie a week before the pre-World Cup encounter. Such things dont happen anywhere in the World. 

Houghton was also highly critical about the ground condition at the Salt Lake stadium and felt it was not good enough to host an international tie. 

The problem is that facilities at most of the places are like that, the national coach pointed out. When I first had a look at the Calcutta ground, I was horrified. Then I found the Chennai ground equally bad. 

Indian soccer system, Houghton regretted, lacks basic features for improvement. According to the veteran coach, proper facilities, good coaches and adequate preparations are necessities for the national team to make progress. 

I am happy that I have finally got a support staff that is going to stick around for the whole season, said Houghton with a sigh of relief. 

Last year, the support staff changed from one city to another, Houghton said. In Calcutta, we had one set of staff and then it changed completely when we switched over to Chennai or Goa. A national team shouldnt be run like that. 

Drawing a comparison with his experience as the national coach of China or Uzbekistan, Houghton said in China he got 14 months to train the pre-Olympic side. Here in India, I got 14 days. Too many domestic tournaments disrupt preparations here.

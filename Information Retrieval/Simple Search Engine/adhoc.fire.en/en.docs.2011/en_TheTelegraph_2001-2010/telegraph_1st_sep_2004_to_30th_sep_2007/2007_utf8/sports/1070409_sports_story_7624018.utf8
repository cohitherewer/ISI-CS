 Matthew Hayden is egotistical and a bully, says Kyle Mills 

 - Like Steve, he goes out looking for a fight and has that Aussie machoism about him 

Georgetown: Matthew Hayden has been described as egotistical, bully, mouthy, intimidating opponent and the one looking for fights by New Zealand fast bowler Kyle Mills. 

Mills, in his column back home, also questioned if Hayden, who is the leading scorer of the ongoing World Cup with 395 runs at 98.75 and a strike rate of 111, deserved to be present at the tournament. 

Haydens a big ego player and if we can restrict him, his ego will be too big for the situation of the game and thats what the guys will be relying on, Mills said. 

The other thing about Hayden is that hes quite mouthy. Hes definitely a bully and he tends to pick on guys he perceives as weaker players. 

I cant imagine him saying anything to Shane Bond but he might try to intimidate some of our less experienced bowlers. 

Like Steve Waugh, he goes out looking for a fight and has that Aussie machoism about him. 

Millss scathing attack on the Queensland batsman is sure to stoke the fire between the sides. The two teams play in Grenada on April 20. 

The ironic thing is that if it wasnt for the Black Caps poor fielding in Perth during a tri-series game this summer, Hayden might not even have been at the World Cup, he writes. 

Before (that) game all the talk was that Hayden would be dropped if he didnt score any runs. That day we dropped him three times and he went on to make a hundred and since then hes been unstoppable. 

Bad blood between the nations dates back a long way. It has hardly improved in recent times. New Zealand have been incensed by Cricket Australias decision to rest star players during tours across the Tasman. 

On the most recent tour to New Zealand in February, Australia did not take Adam Gilchrist or Ricky Ponting and were thrashed 0-3. The New Zealand and England teams were already fired-up by coach John Buchanans assessment that Australia were not being challenged during the tri- series. 

Black Caps opener Lou Vincent had also fired a shot at the Australians, saying their on-field sledging was never-ending. 

They hunt like a pack of dogs. Theres not just one guy going after you, Vincent said. 

Neither Vincent nor Mills will play against Australia on April 20. Mills has an injured knee and Vincent a broken hand. Mills writes of his regret at being injured for the World Cup because he had had success against Hayden. 

I seem to be able to get the ball to swing back into him and can trap him lbw early in his innings, he writes. 

Meanwhile, Australia heaved a sigh of relief after Hayden confirmed that he would not leave for home to be with his wife who is expecting a child within a month. 

Haydens wife Kellie is due to give birth to their third child three days after the tournament but the burly opener has assured Cricket Australia he wouldnt withdraw from the tournament. 

About half the Australian players wives and girlfriends (WAGS) went home at the end of the first round as it was pre-arranged. It included Michael Clarkes partner, Stuart Clarks wife Michelle and their son Lachlan and four of John Buchanans five children. 

Glenn McGraths wife Jane, currently battling cancer, has chosen not to travel to the Caribbean.

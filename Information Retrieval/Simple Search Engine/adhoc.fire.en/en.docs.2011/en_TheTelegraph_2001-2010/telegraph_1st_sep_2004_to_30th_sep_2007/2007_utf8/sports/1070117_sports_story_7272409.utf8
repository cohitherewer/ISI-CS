 Air India deflate HASC 3-1 

Mumbai: Local outfit Air India overwhelmed Bangalores Hindustan Aeronautics Sports Club (HASC) 3-1 to join city rivals Mahindra United at the top of the National Football League table. 

The goal scorers for the winners, who led 2-1 at half-time, were Bashiru Abbas (33rd minute), Noel Fernandes (41st) and Narendra Meetei (68th). Captain Xavier Vijay Kumar scored the lone goal for the Bangalore team in the 43rd minute. 

African striker Abbas scored with a spectacular scissors kick off a throw-in from Uttam Singh to give Air India the lead. 

Another fine goal, this time hooked with his right foot by Fernandes to take advantage of a lovely goalmouth centre by Abbas put the Mumbai outfit 2-0 in front before HASC reduced the margin when Xavier slotted in an angular shot from the right through a maze of legs two minutes from half-time. 

Later Meetei rounded off the tally by nodding in with a lunge at a free-kick taken by Paresh Shivalkar through a crowded defence. 

The victory, their second in three matches, took Air India to seven points, the same as defending champions Mahindra while HASC remained on one point from three ties.

Madrid: Argentine striker Javier Saviola steered Barcelona into the quarter finals of the Kings Cup when he hit a hattrick in his sides 3-2 win over second division Alaves at the Nou Camp on Tuesday. 

The result gave the Spanish champions a 5-2 aggregate victory, but an otherwise sloppy performance will have done little to allay fears that the Catalans have gone off the boil after winning just one of their last five league matches. 

Saviola, who also scored both goals in the 2-0 win in last weeks first leg, strengthened his case for a regular place in the starting line-up with another fine individual performance. 

His first came when he bundled the ball in from close range on 16 minutes after Alaves keeper Nicolas Ardouin palmed the ball into his path following a Ronaldinho free-kick. 

The pocket-sized Argentine made it 2-0 four minutes later when he ballooned a header over the French custodian after midfielder Thiago Motta had dinked a neat pass into the area. 

But the Catalans relaxed too soon and Alaves were back on level terms in the game by half-time. 

Brazilian forward Wellington Paulista chipped the ball over Albert Jorquera after a neat one-two on the edge of the area and fellow-countryman Arthuro left the Barcelona keeper standing when he curled a superbly struck free-kick around the wall from 25 metres out. 

Wellington had a great chance to put Alaves ahead on the night when he broke free and rounded Jorquera early in the second half, but defender Carles Puyol managed to scramble the Brazilians shot off the line. 

Saviola ended any hopes of a comeback when he completed his hattrick soon after, volleying home from 15 metres out after Xavi had beaten the offside trap with a chipped pass over the Alaves back-four. 

In England, the FA Cup served up two classic third round replays on Tuesday when the Premier League twice overcame the second division, Middlesbrough holding off Hull City 4-3 and Manchester City beating Sheffield Wednesday 2-1. 

In a remarkable game at the Riverside Stadium, 18-year-old debutant Seb Hines 32nd-minute goal for Boro was a rare moment of excitement in the first half. It all changed after the interval when Boro stretched their lead to 3-0 and 4-1 but then spent the last 20 minutes desperately clinging on. 

Mark Viduka got Boros second after Aiyegbeni Yakubus shot came back off a post and when Yakubu added the third with a 57th minute penalty it looked all over. 

However, Hull pulled one back with a glancing header by defender Andy Dawson two minutes later and then made it 3-2 with a Jon Parkin penalty in the 63rd minute. 

Viduka scored Boros fourth with a clinical finish a minute later but Hull refused to lie down and Dawson, whose last goal before Tuesday came almost three years ago, got his second to bring it back to 4-3.

New Delhi: British legend Bobby Charlton, who visited Cambodia last month, led a training session for its young players. His visit certainly seems to have breathed life into Cambodias struggling football system. 

On Sunday, in the ONGC Nehru Cup at the Ambedkar Stadium here, the Cambodians went down 3-4 to Kyrgyzstan but they won the hearts of the couple of thousand spectators. 

In the opener, Cambodia lost 0-6 to India. And when Kyrgyzstan took a 2-0 lead by the 16th minute, everyone around was expecting yet another rout. But the South Asian side not only equalised, but also raced to a 3-2 lead before the half time. 

That Kyrgyzstan could still manage to garner full points was because of their experience and superior skills. A well-combined five-man Cambodian midfield managed to rattle them for sometime, but they were finally able to find holes in the rival defence. 

For Cambodia, midfielder and Man of the Match Hok Sotiya excelled. Apart from scoring the first goal off a free-kick from outside the box, he was the brain behind the other two goals scored by Chan Rithy and Chin Chum. He proved to be a master of set-piece moves. 

For the Kyrgyzstanis, who only played well in patches, Talant Samsaliev, Aibek Bokoev, Ruslan Djamshidov and Vadim Harchenko were the scorers.

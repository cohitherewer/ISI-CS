The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Rain threat looms large

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

 Rahul Dravid in Chittagong 

Chittagong: If you think Bangladeshs World Cup performance would have inspired the home crowd to flock to the stadium, you are mistaken. With the series already decided, the enthusiasm has somewhat been diminished. The inclement weather and cyclone threat have dampened their spirits too. 

As the players went through their customary nets session indoors on Monday, the only point of interest revolved around the arrival of Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly. The local media seemed more concerned about how long the current depression would last and the forecast towards the end of the week. The focus has clearly shifted to the Test matches. 

It rained for most of Monday forcing the players to practise indoors. The pitch has been well covered but the slippery outfield is a matter of concern. The drainage system here isnt of the highest standard and the match will not start on time Tuesday. 

The hosts arrived early at the stadium for practice, but on learning that India, too, were due shortly, Habibul Bashar allowed Rahul Dravids men to make use of the indoor surface first. Bangladesh returned for an afternoon session. Such generosity is quite unexpected in the modern world of international sport. 

The Indians, though, are not intent on doing any such act of benevolence. As Ravi Shastri emphasised the other day that there would be no show of mercy. Dravid echoed similar sentiments Monday. 

We are very keen to make it 3-0. That was one of our goals when we started the one-day series. We still have one game to play and that remains our target, Team India captain said. 

The Indians have decided to leave out Zaheer Khan and Sreesanth from the XII, announced for the match. Rudra Pratap Singh and Robin Uthappa will be included in the team. The opening combination of Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag will remain unchanged with Uthappa batting at No. 3. In this case, one from Dinesh Mongia, Dinesh Karthik and Yuvraj Singh will have to sit out. 

Sreesanths calf muscle injury has not shown any sign of improvement. He did not practise Monday and faces a fight against time to get fit for the first Test. There was no communication from the team management on reports of the medical tests done on him. 

Dravid was diplomatic on Sreesanth. We are monitoring Sreesanths fitness. He wont recover for the match (third ODI), but we are trying our best to make sure that he recovers before Friday. There is not much gap (between the final ODI and first Test), so we will try our best In these conditions, we will make sure that he is fully fit before he plays. 

It has been learnt that Sreesanth may go back home if there is no remarkable improvement during the next couple of days. 

Bangladesh, plagued by fitness problems, will use the opportunity to rediscover self-belief ahead of the Tests. We have nothing to lose and will go all out to regain some pride, Bashar said. 

Weather, however, may come in the way of both captains plans.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Greenidge, Roberts approached

 - Bangladesh Board wants West Indian greats as specialist coaches 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Gordon Greenidge 

Dhaka: The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has approached Gordon Greenidge and Andy Roberts to come on board as specialist coaches for batting and bowling. 

Both were approached during the recent World Cup... They seemed interested, but the terms and conditions havent been discussed, a well-placed source told The Telegraph. 

The BCB has already appointed a specialist fielding coach, local Salahuddin. 

The source added: At the moment, though, its not clear who will be recruited as head coach... Eventually, it could be somebody who has only worked at the County level. 

 Andy Roberts

Greenidge, it may be recalled, was Bangladeshs coach in the latter part of the 1990s and it was under his guidance that Bangladesh qualified for the 1999 World Cup by winning the 1997 ICC Trophy. 

Recognising Greenidges contribution, the government of that time made him an honorary citizen. Currently, hes the West Indies chief selector. 

For whatever reason, the BCB hasnt kept outgoing coach Dav Whatmore in the loop. He could, after all, have something constructive to say about the type best suited for the Bangladeshi environment. 

Assuming the Test series goes the distance, May 29 is going to be Whatmores last day in office.

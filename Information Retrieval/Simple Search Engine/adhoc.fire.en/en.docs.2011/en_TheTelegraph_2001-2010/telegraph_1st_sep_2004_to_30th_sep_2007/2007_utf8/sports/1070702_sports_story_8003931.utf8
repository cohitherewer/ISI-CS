The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Federer up as Haas pulls out

 Roger Federer 

 London: Roger Federer walked 

 into the Wimbledon quarter finals when his fourth-round 

 opponent, Tommy Haas, withdrew from the tournament on Sunday 

 with a torn stomach muscle.

 The 13th-seeded Haas and four-time 

 defending champion Federer were scheduled to play in the 

 fourth round on Monday.

 To pull out of this match, 

 against Roger on Centre Court, is obviously very disappointing, 

 Haas said. Cant even put it in words.

 The top-ranked Federer will face 

 2003 French Open champion Juan Carlos Ferrero or unseeded 

 Serb Janko Tipsarevic for a berth in the semis.

 Because Haas pulled out before 

 the match, it goes into the books as a walkover, and Federer 

 will not get credit for a victory. So the Swiss stars 

 winning streak at Wimbledon stays at 31 matches, and his 

 record run on grasscourts stays at 51.

 Haas said he expects to be sidelined 

 for up to a month with the lower abdominal injury, which 

 flared up during his 1-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4 victory over 

 No. 21 Dmitry Tursunov in the third round on Friday.

 Haas called for the trainer during 

 the second set, when he was treated and given painkillers. 

 The German said the pain felt much worse on Saturday and 

 that tests showed the muscle was bleeding.

 The match against Federer was 

 to be the 29-year-old Haass first in the fourth round 

 at the All England Club.

 Who knows if such an opportunity 

 will come again, Haas said. I certainly hope 

 so.

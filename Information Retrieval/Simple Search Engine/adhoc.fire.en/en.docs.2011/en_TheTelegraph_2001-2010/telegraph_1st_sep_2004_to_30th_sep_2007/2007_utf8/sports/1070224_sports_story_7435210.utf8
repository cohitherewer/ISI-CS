Marana (US): The omens looked even brighter for Tiger Woods on Thursday as he stayed firmly on course for an eighth successive PGA Tour title at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship. 

The world No. 1, who trounced South Africas Tim Clark 5 amp; 4 in the second round, was one of only two top-10 seeds to reach the third stage at Dove Mountains Gallery Golf Club. 

Two-time champion Woods said his game had improved markedly from the opening day and few would bet against him closing to within three PGA Tour titles of Byron Nelsons all-time record on Sunday. 

I played better than I did yesterday, which is great, and tomorrow, hopefully, I can play even better, Woods said after sealing victory at the par-three 14th. 

I put a lot of pressure on Timmy. I know Timmy is struggling right now, hes still a little bit hurt. 

Champion in 2003 and 2004 when the event was played at La Costa Resort, Woods has not finished worse than second on the PGA Tour since the Western Open last July. 

Only fellow-American Nelson, who won 11 consecutive titles on 1945 Tour, has produced a longer winning streak. Woods will face Australian left-hander Nick Hern, who beat South African Rory Sabbatini 2 amp; 1 on Thursday. 

The last time the two met at the Accenture Match Play Championship, in the second round in 2005, Hern triumphed 3 amp;1. 

The straight-hitting Australian, although yet to win on the PGA Tour, is regarded as one of the best putters in the game. Woods knows, if he is to win this weeks title, he is likely to play at least one average round out of five. 

Ive never played a match play event where all the rounds Ive played were great golf, he said. 

Youre going to have one or two rounds where youre not going to play well. Youve just got to get through those matches. Sometimes you do, sometimes you dont. (Reuters)

 Holding Court may do the trick again 

 SRIMAX

 Bangalore: Holding Court, the last years winner of the 2,200m Maharajas Cup, looks good to score a repeat win in the prestigious event here on Sunday. The Royal Kingdom-Confiture son, may face a stiff challenge from S. Ganapathys ward Southern Empire. But Holding Court has beaten his younger rival recently over a 1,400m sprint and stamina being his forte, he may do the trick again.

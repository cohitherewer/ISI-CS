 Jeev up to tied 36th

Gut Ldrchenhof: Jeev Milkha Singh shot five birdies in a row to climb to tied 36th from an overnight 49th after the second round of the Mercedes Benz Golf Championship. 

He shot a two-under 70 on Friday to be at two-under 142 for 36 holes. Jyoti Randhawa had a very eventful round with seven birdies and six bogeys in his 71 that saw him improve from tied 65th to 60th. 

Meanwhile, Arjun Atwal missed the cut in the Oregon Classic in Junction City. (PTI)

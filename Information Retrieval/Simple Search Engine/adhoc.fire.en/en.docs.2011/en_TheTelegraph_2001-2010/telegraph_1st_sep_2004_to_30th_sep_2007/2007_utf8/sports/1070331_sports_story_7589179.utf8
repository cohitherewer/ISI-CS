 3-member team cleared by govt

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board has received clearance from its government to send a three-member delegation to Jamaica to assist in the investigations into the murder of coach Bob Woolmer. 

PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf said on Friday that while Pakistan were keen to send the party it would be dependent on the Jamaican authorities agreeing to it. 

I met with the Prime Minister and he has agreed to our proposal, to send a delegation to Jamaica to help out in the investigations, he said. The panel would include one senior diplomat, a PCB official and a senior investigating officer. 

Woolmer, 58, was found unconscious in his hotel room in Kingston on March 18, one day after Pakistan were beaten by minnows Ireland and eliminated from the World Cup. 

He died later in hospital and Jamaican police say there is enough evidence to suggest he was murdered. 

Ashraf said Pakistan believed that its delegation, if allowed to help in the investigations, would prove helpful for the Jamaican authorities. Woolmer was our man and we also want to get to the bottom of this mystery of how he died, why he was killed and who is responsible for it, he added.

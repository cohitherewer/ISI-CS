Tulsa: Tiger Woods extended his lead at the PGA Championship to three strokes over Canadian Stephen Ames on Saturday, taking dead aim on claiming his 13th major. 

Woods, who held a two-shot overnight advantage, posted a one-under 69 for a seven-under 203 total on another sweltering day at Southern Hills. 

I accomplished my goal, which was to shoot under par and increase my lead, said holder Woods, who is hungry for his first major of the season. 

Woods, who won last years PGA Championship in Medinah by five shots, is 12-for-12 winning major championships when entering the final round with the lead. 

The world No. 1 registered two birdies against one bogey as he played a solid round, content to watch his rivals slide back and struggle to stay in the hunt. 

The top five players on the leaderboard all posted 69s. 

Ames rolled in a 15-foot birdie putt on the difficult 18th hole to move into second place at four-under 206, one stroke better than American Woody Austin, who bogeyed the last. 

Australian John Senden was in fourth place at two-under-par 208, with three-time major winner Ernie Els of South Africa next at 209 as only five players finished 54 holes under par. 

Local favourite Scott Verplank, playing alongside Woods, double-bogeyed the par-four 12th as Woods made birdie, starting a plunge that put him seven shots behind after a four-over 74. 

In contrast to Fridays exhilarating 63 that tied the lowest round ever shot in a major, Woods played a workmanlike 18 holes on Saturday. 

The 31-year-old American birdied the fourth and 12th holes and recorded his only bogey at the 223-yard par-three 14th when he needed two putts after blasting out of a greenside bunker. 

Earlier, Boo Weekley showed low scores were possible when he arrived at the 18th needing a birdie to match Woodss impressive 63. 

The 34-year-old American three-putted for a bogey, but the round lifted Weekley, who just made the cut at five-over 145, into a tie for sixth at even-par 210. 

Australian Nathan Green reached five-under for the round when he eagled the par-five 13th, finishing with a 67 for 210, a total also shared by compatriot Adam Scott, K.J. Choi of South Korea, and Americans Kevin Sutherland and Arron Oberholser. 

Trevor Immelman of South Africa fired a 66 for 211. 

Making a different impression was Sergio Garcia, who was disqualified for signing an incorrect scorecard. 

The 27-year-old Spaniard, who lost a playoff to Irishman Padraig Harrington at last months British Open, recorded a par four at the 17th when he had bogeyed the hole.

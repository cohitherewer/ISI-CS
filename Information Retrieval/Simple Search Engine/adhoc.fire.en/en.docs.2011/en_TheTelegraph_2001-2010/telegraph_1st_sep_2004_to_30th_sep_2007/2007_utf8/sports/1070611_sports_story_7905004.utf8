The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Talukdar eyes Olympic glory

A STAFF REPORTER

 Jayanta Talukdar 

Calcutta: In a relatively short career, he has covered a fair bit of ground. But for archer Jayanta Talukdar, the journey has just begun. 

A promising career which started in the open fields of Tata Archery Academy (TAA) way back in December 2000, culminated in his being nominated for the prestigious Arjuna award this year. 

But gold medals in the World Cup in Croatia, SAF Games and bronze in the Doha Asian Games notwithstanding, the 21-year-old ace archer is eyeing the ultimate glory an Olympic gold in Beijing. 

Talking to The Telegraph during a practice stint at the TAA in Jamshedpur recently, while carefully nursing his still swollen wrist, Jayanta, the worlds top archer till September last year before a string of injuries halted his run, sounded cautiously hopeful. 

If you look at Indias performance graph, it is definitely on the rise lately, Jayanta smiled, we should do well in Beijing. In fact, our chances in the team events are pretty good. 

My wrist should be okay by the time Olympic Games starts and I will give it my best shot. Finger crossed for the rest. 

Right now, though, Jayanta is busy preparing for the World Cup in Germany. The current No.4, who needs 14 points to cross his nearest rival in the third and final leg of the selection trials, is expectedly the trump card of national coach Lim Chae-Woong. 

The genial Korean just about managed to convey that he was worried only about the Olympics and nothing else in his limited English. Jayantas injury has healed. He is okay now. We are focused only on Olympics. We will do well, was all that he managed to say. 

Words dont matter, action does.

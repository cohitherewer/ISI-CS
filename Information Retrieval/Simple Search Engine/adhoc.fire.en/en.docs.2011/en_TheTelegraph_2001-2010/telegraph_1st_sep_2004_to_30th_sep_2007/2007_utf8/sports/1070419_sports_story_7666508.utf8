 Pollution, traffic let New Delhi down

New Delhi: Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president Suresh Kalmadi termed New Delhis loss to Incheon in the race to host the 2014 Asian Games as a victory for sports minister Mani Shankar Aiyar, but insiders feel other factors may have played a part as well. 

Incheon, it is learnt, defeated New Delhi 26-19 with China supporting South Korea at the last moment. 

Incheon upstaged New Delhi with an offer of $2 million to each of the 45 member countries to train athletes and buy equipment. The Indian offer was $200,000 each. 

The Cabinet did not approve more than this amount, explained an IOA source. 

A section of the IOA believes the infamous pollution and traffic congestion in Delhi were the main reasons for the city losing out. The OCA evaluation committee, according to sources, wrote an unfavourable report against the Indian capital. 

The Indian bidding committee tried its best to convince the members about the receding level of pollution in Delhi and even promised to earmark separate lanes during the Games, but nothing worked, said a member of the Commonwealth Games Federation, who followed the bid closely. 

The defeat has caught high-flying IOA officials on the wrong foot. Yes, we are feeling low, conceded IOA director A.S.V. Prasad. But losing is part of the game. 

Prasad tried to sound philosophical, but the lack of coordination in Indias bid was clear. India were sure of getting the support of all south Asian countries, but at least a couple of them voted against them, it was felt. 

Surprisingly, Randhir Singh who was recently re-elected OCA secretary general for the fifth term could not steer New Delhi through despite Kalmadi claiming at least 25 sure votes. 

Quite crucially, India did not realise South Korea were on a much stronger wicket. They successfully hosted the 1986 and 2002 Asian Games, as well as the 1988 Asian Games and their athletes have performed far better consistently than Indians at international meets. 

The Koreans also treated the fight as a prestige issue as they had to face a lot of embarrassment following Indias success in clearing athlete Sunita Rani of doping charges at the Busan Asian Games. 

The biggest problem, the IOA source claimed, was that India looked a divided house in front of the member nations. Our sports minister Mani Shankar Aiyar openly criticised the bid despite it having the Cabinets approval. It showed India in poor light, he pointed out. 

It may be recalled that Aiyar had gone on record saying that the huge amount of money earmarked for the Asian Games could be used for building sports facilities and helping millions of deprived children and youth across the country. 

IOA officials claimed that members of the Incheon bidding team distributed copies of Aiyars statement to the media and all member nations hours before the bid meeting started in Kuwait City.

 Ashok opens up four-shot lead

Gurgaon: Ashok Kumar kept his feet on the accelerator and sizzled his way to yet another superb round of five-under 67 in round three of the Rs 25 lakh Color Plus Open at the Golden Greens golf and country club on Saturday. 

Following up on hot rounds of 66 and 68 on first two days, he fired six birdies against just one bogey and climbed to 15-under 201 to open up a four-shot lead over his nearest rival, Digvijay Singh (68). 

Young Gaganjeet Bhullar, looking for his maiden win as a professional in his rookie season, shot the days best of six-under 66 and rose to tied third with seasoned professionals Gaurav Ghei (68) and SSP Chowrasia (70). 

Four others, C. Muniyappa (68), Mukesh Kumar (69), Mohammed Islam (72) and Vikrant Chopra (70), were tied for sixth at six-under 210.

 New test to detect cheats 

London: Experts believe a new test to detect human growth hormone may bring sports authorities a step closer to catching doping athletes. 

The blood test was recently developed by Dr Ken Ho of Sydneys Garvan Institute of Medical Research, with support from the World Anti-Doping Agency. 

This new test is more sensitive to human growth hormone than what weve had in the past, ho said. 

My message to athletes would be to train harder instead of cheating. 

It has been notoriously difficult to identify athletes illegally using human growth hormone. Not only is the hormone naturally produced in the body making it harder to detect synthetic versions but the concentrations of it normally circulating in the body vary enormously and can disappear within minutes.

 Sasi splits point

Yalta: Krishnan Sasikiran drew with second seed Vassily Ivanchuk to retain his joint fifth position after the third round of the Aerosvit International Chess Championship here. 

The draw took Sasikirans tally to 1.5 points. The Indian will next take on Pavel Eljanov of Ukraine. The third day saw only two games, out of six, ending decisively. 

Sasikiran played the white side of a Benoni Defence and even though he got an optical advantage, the game remained within the boundaries of a draw. 

Ivanchuk went for quick exchanges at the cost of a pawn in the middlegame and recovered quickly to reach a level rook and pawns endgame. Peace was signed in just 28 moves. 

Spanish GM Alexei Shirovs party was spoiled by tailender Loek van Wely of The Netherlands, who registered his first victory. (PTI)

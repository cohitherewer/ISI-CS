The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IN THE CITY

 Calcutta: Fourth seeds of both boys and girls sections crashed out of the Sunfeast Junior Tennis Super Series 2007 at the South Club on Tuesday. 

 Delhi boy Rohit Bisht went down to Gujarats Vaidik Munshaw in a match lasting 180 minutes. Mushaw, who had won the Asian Juniors here in November last year, took the first set easily 6-1. But the second set was won by Bisht 7-3 through tie-breaker. 

 Munshaw, however, prevailed in the third set, which also went into tie-breaker 7-4. Munshaw thus ensured his place in the quarter finals. 

 In the girls section, fourth seeded local challenger Mokshada Jain was upset by Natasha Palha (Goa), rather tamely 4-6, 0-6.

 TENNIS: Junior Super Series meet at the South Club from 10.30 am.

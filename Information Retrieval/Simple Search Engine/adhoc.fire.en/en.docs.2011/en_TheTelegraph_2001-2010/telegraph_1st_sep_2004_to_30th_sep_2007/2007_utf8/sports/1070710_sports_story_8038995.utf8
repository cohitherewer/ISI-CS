 Ali vs Frazier in tennis whites

 - Nadal must add deception and disguise to his repertoire if he is to conquer Federer on grass

During the recent monsoon season that turned Wimbledon Common into a swampland at which time Roger Federer was having holidays as Rafael Nadal so charmingly put it locals claim they could hear a great sawing and hammering coming from the top of the Matterhorn. 

Federer, so it was said, was spending his five-day break from tennis by building an ark; yes, even the Chosen One accepts that he can not walk on water although, with a racket in his fist and grass underneath his feet, let no-one doubt that he can perform all manner of minor miracles. 

Having now equalled Bjorn Borgs record of five successive triumphs on the Centre Court, the Swiss will return 12 months hence in pursuit of William Renshaws tally of six titles, compiled in an era (1881-86) when the defending champion idly sat it out to await the emergence of a winner from the qualifying event. 

So unrivalled is Federer on the lawns of England save for the admirable Nadal that Wimbledon might consider the reintroduction of the challenge round; certainly his route to this final was hardly any more taxing than lounging around on the sidelines in his Gatsbyesque white blazer and flannels while keeping one nonchalant eye on proceedings over the top of his newspaper. 

Neat to the point of obsession, Nadal habitually empties his bag by the umpires chair with the meticulousness of a greengrocer laying out his pavement display of cabbages and caulies; towels folded over the backs of the two chairs just so, water bottles six centimetres in front and six to the right of his chosen seat, rackets arranged in a neat row to his left. 

This attention to detail was repeated on court where to his eternal credit, he matched Federer shot for shot, rally for rally, game after game, hour after hour, constantly examining the champions so-called weaker backhand. 

Bidding to become only the third man in Open era to win Roland Garros and Wimbledon in the same summer following Rod Laver (1969) and the remarkable Borg (1978-80) the Spaniard can smite the ball harder than any man alive but only the Swiss can make it execute aeronautical flights of fancy. I could describe a litany of strokes as sublime, wonderful or breathtaking but one driven half-volley down the line winner from behind the baseline came into the impossible category. 

Here was Ali versus Frazier in tennis whites, the brutal knock-out puncher against the stinging butterfly. The Majorcan also unleashed a stream of fabulous winners from every point on the court, yet the feeling persists that to achieve true greatness, the demolition man must add deception and disguise to his repertoire if he is to conquer Federer who can deliver 125 mph aces or gossamer delicate drop-shots depending upon his whim. 

Watched by 10 20th century Wimbledon champions Jack Kramer, Budge Patty, Neale Fraser, Manuel Santana (the last Spaniard to win the mens singles title in 1966) and Borg from the Royal Box plus McEnroe, Jimmy Connors, Boris Becker, Pat Cash and Michael Stich in their various TV and radio commentary booths this was tennis of the third Millennium, the ball sizzling back and forth across the net at dizzying speed. 

Although Borg says, I see a lot of myself in Roger, were very similar on the court. He doesnt show his emotions, Federer is different in one fundamental respect; at 25 he is eager to chase further records six-in-a-row, then Sampras seven Wimbledon and 14 Grand Slam titles (the Swiss is now alongside Laver and Borg on 11) to name but three unlike the Swede who essentially retired at the same age. 

Twenty-six years on, Borg, who greeted Federer with a fatherly embrace in front of the roll of honour board bearing their names, is still unable to explain his thought processes at the time. Perhaps having lost to McEnroe in the Wimbledon and US Open finals and struggled to beat Ivan Lendl for his sixth successive French Open crown in 1981, he realised his domination was at an end? Whatever... it was no fun anymore. There were so many things I wanted to do, places to visit, people to meet. It was my rebirth as a human being. 

There will inevitably come a day when Federer, too, will decide that he can have better fun elsewhere than on a tennis court but, for now, let us luxuriate in his miracle-making and grace. Thanks for coming, he told Borg, it was a great honour to play in front of you. 

PS: There is a scene in the The Third Man in which Orson Welles character, Harry Lime, observes: In Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, bloodshed yet they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland, they had brotherly love, 500 years of democracy and peace. What did that produce? The cuckoo clock.. 

The Swiss, to be strictly accurate, did not produce the first cuckoo clock an invention inflicted upon us by the Bavarians but having retained the Americas Cup, claimed the leaders yellow jersey in the Tour de France through Fabian Cancellara, and provided Wimbledon with a champion who may be remembered as the very best of all-time, the Land of Toblerone is currently one of the worlds most powerful sporting nations.

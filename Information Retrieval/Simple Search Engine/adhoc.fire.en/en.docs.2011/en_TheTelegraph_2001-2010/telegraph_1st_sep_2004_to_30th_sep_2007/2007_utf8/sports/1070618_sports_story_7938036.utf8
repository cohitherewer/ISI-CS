The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Earning his stripes in eye of the Tiger 

 Simon Hart

 Lewis Hamilton

 It is not often 

 that Lewis Hamilton is lost for words but there was a discernible 

 gulp as he digested the information. Was he aware that Tiger 

 Woods was following his Formula One career closely and had 

 paid him the ultimate compliment of describing him as a 

 role model? 

No way, no way, stammered the young Briton, who has been studiously avoiding the newspapers for the past few days to keep his mind on the task of winning back-to-back races. Now that has put a smile on my face. Hes a cool dude and Ive always wanted to meet him, so thats really nice to hear. Is he going to be here this weekend? 

The Hamilton fairytale may have stretched credibility to near breaking point but expecting the worlds greatest golfer to down tools at the US Open at Oakmont and head west to Indianapolis for the US Grand Prix was surely too much to expect. Another time, maybe. 

Tell him, thank you very much for his kind words, said Hamilton, showing the kind of politeness that has earned almost as many plaudits as his astonishing composure behind the wheel of a racing car. 

Im honoured that hes said so many nice things about me and has been taking notice of what Ive been doing. I really, really hope to see him soon and I wish him all the best. I know hes going to win, so he doesnt need me to send him any luck. 

Exchanging pleasantries with Tiger Woods. It has been that kind of week for Hamilton, who, after his maiden Grand Prix victory in Montreal last Sunday and his brilliant drive on Saturday to claim his second successive pole, has seen his status change overnight from a promising rookie to an international superstar, saviour of his sport and on his way to becoming a dollar billionaire. 

Even the Americans, who appear to rate Formula One just below the Nascar Craftsman Truck Series in their pecking order of motor sport, have taken to their hearts the good-looking young man with a maturity beyond his 22 years. 

Seasoned F1 watchers were amazed at the frenzied reaction when he was introduced to a crowd of fans at an open Q amp; A session at the 98-year-old Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Thursday. 

He did not disappoint them, either at one point generating a roar of laughter when he jokingly refused to answer a question from one woman until she removed her Ferrari cap. 

In the audience was Joie Chitwood, the Speedway president. You can just tell hes got that something, he purred. If he continues to perform, hes going to be an outstanding ambassador for Formula One. 

Perform is exactly what Hamilton does best, whether it is handling the pressure of a race or calmly answering questions in front of thousands of spectators. His stage presence is remarkable for someone so young.

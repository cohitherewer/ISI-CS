 Arjun Atwal misses cut

Omaha: Arjun Atwal finished with a round of three-under 69 and missed the cut by a long margin at the midway stage of the Cox Classic. 

Atwal had four birdies on front nine and one more on back nine, but with three bogeys he was way off the cut which came at five-under. Atwal was two-over 144 for two days. 

A bogey-free eight-under-par 63 carried Roland Thatcher into lead at the midway point. Thatcher who shot 64 in first round is now two ahead of Scott Sterling (68) and four clear of Miguel Carballo (63), Michael Walton (64) and Chris Thompson (71). 

Atwal starting on the first, birdied the second, fourth, sixth ninth and tenth and dropped shots on eighth, 16th and 18th. (PTI)

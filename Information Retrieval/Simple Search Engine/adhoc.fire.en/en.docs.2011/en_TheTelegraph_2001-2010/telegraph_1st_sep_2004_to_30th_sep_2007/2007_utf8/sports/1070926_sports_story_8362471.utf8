Ranchi: All roads led to captain Mahindra Singh Dhonis house at the Shyamali colony here after Indias exciting win in the ICC World Twenty20 on Monday. 

Dhonis parents offered prayers at the Deori temple for their son on Tuesday morning, hoping that India would continue to win under his leadership. The family is planning a lavish dinner after he returns home in October following the home series against Australia. 

Dhonis relatives gathered at the AG Colony ground and danced in the rain. Locals, while leading processions for the immersion of Ganesh idols, sang Dhonis praises. 

Dhonis brother-in-law Gautam Gupta said: My in-laws believe that there comes a good phase and a bad phase in everybodys life. The public and the media should support him in tough times as well. 

The principal and teachers of DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir, Dhonis alma mater, were very proud of their former student. 

I am really proud that our student has reached such great heights, principal D. R. Singh said. 

In Giridih, Indias victory celebrations continued for a second day despite heavy rains. While youths carried the Tricolour and danced in the rain across the district, several cricket clubs also held victory rallies in different parts of the township. 

The celebrations took an unpleasant turn when a 24-year-old youth, Mangal Sharma, was stabbed to death in the Lower Bazar area late on Monday. 

Police officials said Sharma was returning home after celebrating the victory when three youths stopped him and asked him to dance. A heated exchange took place, during which he was stabbed.

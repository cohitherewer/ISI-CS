 ICC TEST RANKINGS

 Calcutta: 

 A clean sweep in the three-match series against Michael 

 Vaughans England would not only mark a rare overseas 

 series triumph for India, but also propel them to the second 

 spot in the ICC Test championship ladder.

 At the same time, Rahul Dravids 

 men can slip to as low as seventh in case they come a cropper 

 in the series.

 Currently on 102, Dravids 

 team can gain nine points to 111 and leapfrog South Africa, 

 Sri Lanka and England, with the latter dropping from 115 

 to 108 were that to happen, according to a ICC release.

 A 2-0 win would lift the Indians 

 to third spot.

 Spotlight on Pathan

 - Mumbai vs Baroda 

Vadodara: The spotlight would be on Irfan Pathan and those knocking on the doors of selection to the World Cup-bound squad when Baroda take on Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy Super League semi-final on Tuesday. 

Pathan has been struggling to regain the form that made him Indias premier strike bowler not very long ago. This important outing at the Motibag ground here would afford him another chance to get into rhythm. 

The tie also assumes significance for players such as Wasim Jaffer, Rohit Sharma and Rajesh Pawar, all of whom have been included in the list of 30 probables for the World Cup. 

Former champions Mumbai were not taking chances with their batsmen concentrating hard on tackling Baroda bowlers, especially Pathan, despite the left-arm seamer not being among wickets in the two Ranji matches he has played so far this season. 

Mumbai manager N. Dalal said the batsmen had practised countering left-arm swing bowling during nets, with Sachin Tendulkar and Zaheer Khan also chipping in with valuable tips.

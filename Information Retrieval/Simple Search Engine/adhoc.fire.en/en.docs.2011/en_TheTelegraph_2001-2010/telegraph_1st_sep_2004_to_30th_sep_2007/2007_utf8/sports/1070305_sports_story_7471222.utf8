 Draw keeps Anand in joint lead

Linares: Viswanathan Anand played out a battling draw with Russian Peter Svidler to stay in joint lead along with Magnus Carlsen of Norway after the ninth round of Morelia-Linares chess tournament here. 

After a rather sedate eighth round, tough fight took place on all the boards although the day produced just one decisive game. Russian Alexander Morozevich came out with his first triumph in the event at the expense of Hungarian Peter Leko. 

16-year old Magnus Carlsen played it safe with white against defending champion Levon Aronian of Armenia and continued to lead the tables with just five more rounds to go in this categry-20 double round-robin event. 

For the record, both Anand and Carlsen have 5.5 points each followed by Ivanchuk, who missed some real winning chances against top seed Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria in his ninth round game.

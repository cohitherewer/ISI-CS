 Emburey: We wished each other good luck

 John Emburey in Chennai on Saturday

John Emburey, too, checked in at the Connemara. He spoke to The Telegraph for some minutes before heading towards his laptop. 

 The following are 

 excerpts 

 On arriving to the news 

 that hes not the frontrunner 

 Frankly, Im not disappointed 

 to hear that... The reason being Graham has coached a national 

 team... Thats the reality... Im sure the best 

 man will get the job 

 On his thoughts 

 Its the first time that 

 Im in such a situation... Having to appear for an 

 interview involving a national team... Its difficult 

 to describe. 

 On his chances 

 I believe I can do the job, thats 

 why Im here... Ive worked with England A and 

 was David Lloyds assistant in the latter part of the 

 1990s... Ive been at Middlesex for a number of years 

 and coaching a national team will be a progression. 

 On being on the same London-Chennai 

 flight as Ford 

 We were in different sections... 

 We did interact on landing and wished each other good 

 luck... 

 On having said no 

 to Indias invitation 25 months ago 

 Because of family reasons... My 

 daughters (Clare and Chloe) werent that old... Now, 

 one has finished university and the other school... Both 

 are firmly behind me as, obviously, is wife Suzie. 

 On whether he has finally 

 put together a presentation 

 (Smiles) Yes... It has 

 been a rushed job... Ive brought the laptop, but Im 

 not sure whether Ill use it... Perhaps, Ill 

 just share my thoughts. 

 Finally, on whether (if 

 needed) Middlesex will release him quickly 

 Theyre happy for me... Im 

 sure they will... I reckon its tougher for Graham... 

 Our designations are the same (director of cricket), but 

 hes more into hands-on coaching than I am...

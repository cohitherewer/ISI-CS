 Paes-Damm to open vs Serbian duo

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Leander Paes and Martin Damm have been seeded No. 5 in the mens doubles of the Australian Open. 

According to the draw released on Tuesday, they have a potentially tricky first-round encounter against Serbian duo Novak Djokovic and Janko Tipsarevic. 

The 19-year-old Djokovic has been one of the red-hot talents over the last one-year or so. 

The world No. 15 won the Adelaide title two weeks ago and also featured in the doubles final there (with Radek Stepanek). Tipsarevic, 22, is ranked 64 in singles. 

Unseeded Mahesh Bhupathi and Radek Stepanek, who are with Paes and Damm in the lower half of the draw, will open against French team Sebastien Grosjean and Olivier Patience.

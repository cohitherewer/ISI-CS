The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bengal may field 2nd-string side

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: For seven years, Bengal havent won the National football championships for Santosh Trophy. This time too they seem to have little chance to end the drought as the championship has been scheduled in the middle of Calcutta Football League (CFL). 

As per the All India Football Federation (AIFF) calendar, Santosh Trophy this time will be played in Jammu and Kashmir in July when the Premier Division of the CFL will be in full flow. 

In that case, according to IFA secretary Subrata Dutta, Bengal would be in no position to send the best possible side as it would disrupt CFL severely. 

IFA is planning to stage its 34-match Premier Division league in July-August, said Dutta. We cannot shift it to any other time as the rest of the season has been taken away for AIFF activities. 

CFL has the backing of sponsors. For sake of Santosh Trophy, we cannot sacrifice that. We may be forced to send a team comprising players from lower division clubs, Dutta said. 

Sending a weak team, however, would not solve CFLs problem. Under the AIFF sons of the soil rule, all the Calcutta clubs may have to release their key outstation players if they are called by their respective state association for Santosh Trophy duty. 

As if this is not enough, AIFF has also decided to call the national camp for the ONGC Cup in the second half of July. Absence of top players would further take the sheen out of CFL. 

AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco said: The calendar was set only after discussing with the state associations. It cannot be changed now. 

However the final dates for Santosh Trophy would only be announced after a two-member inspection committee declares the infrastructure in J amp;K fit for staging the tournament. Ironically, the IFA secretary is a member of this committee.

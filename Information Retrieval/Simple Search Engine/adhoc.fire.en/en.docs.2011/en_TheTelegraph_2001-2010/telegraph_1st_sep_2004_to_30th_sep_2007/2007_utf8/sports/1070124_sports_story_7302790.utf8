Calcutta: Sitting pretty with a 32-run lead, the Bengal camp is more than happy at the end of the first days proceedings against Karnataka at the Eden on Tuesday. 

Bengals most successful bowler in the season, Ranadeb Bose who got his fifth five-wicket haul of the season and 14th in career was modest in his reaction. I havent done anything extra-ordinary. It is my duty to take wickets and I am happy to have performed my duty today, Ranadeb said. 

Surpassing Haryanas Joginder Sharmas tally of 39, Ranadeb gave a fitting reply to the selectors by-passing him when choosing the 30-member World Cup probables on January 12. Paras (Mhambrey) told me that the 30-member list doesnt mean anything. It is the pruned 15 that matters, where I had no chance to fit in and so he asked me not to worry, Ranadeb revealed. 

According to the Bengal medium-pacer, there are lots of tournaments after the World Cup and if he continues to bowl like this, he will be in the India fold any day. My focus now is to make Bengal the Ranji Trophy champions and so my personal achievements doesnt get preference, he remarked. 

Five five-wicket hauls in seven matches is an achievement which will please any bowler. It has been a good season so far and I am passing through the best phase of my career, Ranadeb quipped. 

Ranadebs performance has even surprised captain Deep Dasgupta. I always rated him a brilliant bowler, but this season he proved that he is a true match-winner. Taking five or more wickets in a innings for five times is no joke, Deep said. 

Deep, however, now wants to focus on Wednesdays first session. The first session is very important for us and we will form our strategy depending on how we finish the first innings, he remarked. 

Things are really going well for the Bengal captain as he admitted that it was good toss to lose. We were in a dilemma since last night and frankly now I cannot say whether I would have opted to bowl, had we won the toss, he said. 

Ranadebs performance also inspired younger colleague Sourav Sarkar excel from the other end. We always complement each other, when he attacks the batsmen, my job is contain them and so I did my best, said Sourav, who returned his best first-class figure (4/24) on Tuesday. 

Sourav said that he has changed his action a bit and that has helped. So far I havent got any injury problem and so I keep changing my action and stick to the one that suits me best, he stated.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 More teams in NFL not a bad idea

 - Banning foreign players will be an ideal situation, says Bob Houghton

New Delhi: Chief national coach Bob Houghton would like to see an end to participation of foreign players in Indian domestic football for the better growth of local talents, but admits it wont be a practical idea for the survival of club football in the country. Having arrived in the capital on Wednesday night after a four-week vacation in Cape Town, the 58-year-old Briton spoke at length with The Telegraph on his ideas on Indian football and the National Football League (NFL) in particular. 

The following are excerpts 

Q Should foreign players be barred from playing for Indian clubs? 

A Well, as the manager of the national team, banning foreign players from playing in the Indian domestic circuit would be an ideal situation for me. It would open the stage for more Indian footballers to showcase their talents and help me spot more players. But I dont think it is going to be a practical idea, as it would hamper the progress of domestic football. Since progress of the national team and club football go side by side, it wont be advisable to totally ban foreign players. 

But there is hardly any home striker in Indian clubs 

Thats a common phenomenon not only in India, but all over the world. If you take the top four English clubs Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool you will hardly find an English striker. They are mostly dependent on foreign snipers. Here, banning foreign players or strikers wont solve the problem. What needs to be done is to concentrate on development of players in the under-17 and under-19 age groups. That should be the idea. 

Your strikers didnt score for nearly a year for the national team 

Yes, but they will do as they grow in confidence. Manjit (Singh) is a good scorer, so is (Sunil) Chhetri. 

What about Bhaichung? Should he continue for the national team? 

Certainly. He has the experience and ability to guide the team. One should not dismiss him just because he hasnt netted too many for India in the last few months. 

Should there be more teams in the NFL? Is the existing system good enough? 

It wont be such a bad idea to include more teams in the NFL. It would provide opportunities for more players and teams to play on the bigger stage. As regards the system, I think the existing pattern should continue. I agree that India is a much bigger country than any of the European nations, but regional or zonal tournaments wont be able to tap upcoming talents the way NFL can do. 

NFL is concentrated only in a few places such as Calcutta, Goa or Mumbai 

I agree and understand that it needs to spread across the country. But to do it, one cannot forcibly organise matches where it is not being played. Conscious efforts have to be made to improve the standard of the game in all parts of the country. It would encourage clubs from those areas to come up and participate in the NFL. 

Do you foresee any improvement in the national teams performances in the Olympic qualifiers next month? 

I would certainly hope for that when I begin the coaching camp in Calcutta from January 21. Among present campers in the under-21 squad, there are players such as Gourmangi Singh, Anupam (Sarkar), Subhas Chakrabarty, Sushil (Kumar) Singh, Manjit (Singh), Habibur (Rehman), who are highly talented. I expect them to do well against Myanmar.

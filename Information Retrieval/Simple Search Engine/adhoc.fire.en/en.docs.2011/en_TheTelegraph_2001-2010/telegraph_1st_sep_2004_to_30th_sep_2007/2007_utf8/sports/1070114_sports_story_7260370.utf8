 Barreto gears up for special challenge 

Mumbai: Its going to be a special occasion for Jose Ramirez Barreto at the Cooperage on Sunday. The Brazilian, who played a pivotal role in Mahindra Uniteds maiden NFL crown last season, will be up against his former club with new challenges and new ambitions. 

As Mohun Bagan struggle to get into the groove following the Federation Cup win, their captain Barreto is hoping for things to fall in place against the fancied Mahindra side. 

Bagan have started their quest to regain the coveted crown, which they last won in the 2001-02 season, for the third time on a subdued note, beginning with a goalless draw against HASC followed by a 0-2 reversal against JCT. 

For Bagan to click well against the local giants, who have a victory against Dempo and a draw against Churchil Brothers under their belt, both Barreto and their other high-profile striker and India captain Bhaichung Bhutia need to perform well in unison. 

Bagans Brazilian coach Robson also hoped that his top two striking duo would deliver the goods on Sunday in the high-profile encounter. 

I am confident the boys do well. I am not too concerned about the results of the last two matches. I hope the strikers click, he said on the match-eve. 

Its likely both Barreto and Bhaichung will start upfront, confirming the teams urgency to check the downward movement. Mahindra, on the other hand, also need to buck up after having been held to a 1-1 draw by Churchill in their last tie. The fluency of play, which was witnessed in their 2-1 victory over 2004-05 NFL champions Dempo was missing against the other Goan outfit. (PTI)

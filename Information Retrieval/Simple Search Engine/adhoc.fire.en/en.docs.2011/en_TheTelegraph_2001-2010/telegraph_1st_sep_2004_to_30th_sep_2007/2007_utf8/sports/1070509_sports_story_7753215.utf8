 CA hits out at SLC 

 - Gilchrist a highly principled man

Melbourne: Cricket Australia (CA) has shot back at Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) for terming Adam Gilchrists squash ball tactic as unethical and defended its vice-captain as a highly principled man. 

CA spokesman Peter Young refused to admit that Gilchrist gained an unfair advantage by batting with a squash ball in his glove when he scored a matchwinning 149 in the World Cup final. 

Its a storm in a teacup, or a batting glove, Young said. 

He (Gilchrist) is a highly principled person. Youve to go a long way before you find a cricketer who has higher moral standards than Adam Gilchrist, he was quoted as saying in an Australian newspaper. 

SLC secretary Kangadaran Mathivanan had made the comment and added Sri Lanka were considering referring the matter to the International Cricket Council (ICC). 

Young said there was no rule which prevented a batsman from using any such tactic to enhance his grip, but if it was so useful it could rather be made compulsory. 

To the best of our knowledge its no different to, say, putting two or three grips on the bat handle, or batting with two pairs of gloves or having inserts sewn into the palm of gloves. All these are things which now happen. This is in the same category, he said. 

Its been suggested that if shoving a squash ball into your bottom glove makes you bat like Gilchrist, then perhaps the ICC should make it compulsory, Young said. 

Bob Meuleman, who introduced Gilchrist to the technique some years ago, said there was nothing sinister about it. 

Its a bit sad that some people think theres something sinister in it. Theres not, he said. 

Senior Australian umpire Bob Parry, who stood in a limited overs match in Perth last season in which Gilchrist had a squash ball in his glove while scoring a century against Queensland, said he had no problem with it. 

I dont see it being outside the spirit of the game. Its the same as wearing an extra inner inside a batting glove, he said. 

Gilchrists former Western Australia coach Wayne Clark said it was rubbish to think it gave Gilchrist an unfair advantage. Theyre grasping at straws, he said.

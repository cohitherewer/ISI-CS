The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tanasugarn pulls out of city WTA meet

 Tanasugarn 

Calcutta: As if the cloud over Sania Mirzas participation was not enough, Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand, who reached the quarter finals of the WTA Sunfeast Open last year, has withdrawn from the Tier III meet owing to injury. 

The world No.78, who lost a thrilling three-setter to eventual champion Martina Hingis in last years edition, will be replaced by Hana Sromova of Czech Republic. 

Announcing this on Friday, tournament director Jaidip Mukerjea said, confirmation of Sanias participation can only be received after she lands in the city on Sunday. 

In case Sania fails to make it, the lucky loser in the final round of the qualifiers would go through. 

Mukerjea confirmed that the Indian star, who lifted the doubles crown last year with Liezel Huber, wont participate in the doubles event. 

Sunitha Rao (who now represents India) expectedly got a wild card into the main draw, but she will have to do better if she is to carry the nations hopes on her shoulders, provided the wrist injury derails Sania. US-based Sunitha, who turns 23 next month, lost out in the first round to Nicole Pratt last year. 

The other two wild card recipients were promising youngster Tara Iyer and 14-year-old rookie Kyra Shroff. 

Tara, 19, beaten in the first round in the hard courts of the WTA Bangalore Open this year, won the $10000 ITF meet in Noida last month and would look to improve upon her last years performance. Having got a wild card into the qualifiers last year, Tara never made it to the main draw, losing to Rushmi Chakravarthi. 

Meanwhile, led by Marion Bartoli the possible No.1 seed here the players have started tiptoeing into the city. Bartoli, who arrived from Switzerland via Dubai in an Emirates flight, landed in the city early on Thursday. 

Though the World No.10 Swiss chose to take the day off, some like Neha Uberoi straightaway hit the courts. The Florida-based Neha, however, is in a spot as her elder sister and doubles partner Shikha opted out owing to medical reasons.

 Mela at Gaddafi!

Karachi: Pakistani cricket authorities are planning to hold the Basant Mela on a grand scale at the Gaddafi Stadium on Saturday to coincide with a farewell reception for the Pakistan team for the World Cup. 

A source in the PCB confirmed that a grand programme was planned in which president Pervez Musharraf would be the chief guest and meet with the members of the World Cup squad. 

The function is going to cost a lot but some officials said with the spring festival due this week it is the best time to join both functions, one source said. 

The board has also invited a number of former Test players for the function besides dignitaries. (PTI)

 Hayden: 500 runs possible

Melbourne: Smaller grounds, flatter wickets and fast outfields make the perfect recipe for a run-feast at the World Cup and Australian opener Matthew Hayden would not be surprised if a team scales the 500-run summit in the cricketing extravaganza in the Caribbean. 

Teams have broken the 400-run barrier four times in the past two years and Hayden, who holds Australias individual record for highest Test and one-day scores, felt the once seemingly impossible score of 500 is not out of the question. 

Its at an interesting stage in one-day cricket, he was quoted as saying by a newspaper. We laugh, but we laughed at 400 not less than a year ago, saying its not possible, he said. 

Interestingly, fellow Australians Ian and Greg Chappell too felt that a 500-run score is not impossible at all on the small Caribbean grounds with their slick, dry outfields.

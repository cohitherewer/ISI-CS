 Somdev Dev Varman slips on rain-hit day

MARIO RODRIGUES

 Jarkko Nieminen beat Davide Sanguinetti 

Mumbai: They had come to see Lleyton Hewitt perform at the CCI. But the rain gods would have nothing of it. 

Minutes before the two-time Grand Slam champion was due to come on court late on Wednesday evening for his match against Taipei qualifier Ti Chen, the skies opened up. There was no more action on Day 3 of the Kingfisher Airlines Open. 

The schedule of the $416,000 ATP meet, already hit by bad weather, thus got hampered further. Three days have gone by and three first-round matches have still not been completed. 

Hewitts match has been rescheduled for 11 am on Thursday. 

The organisers spent nearly an hour to dry up the centre court on Wednesday evening after an earlier shower stopped play following the first match. Their effort would have paid off, but for another sharp shower. 

Eighth seed Oliver Rochus made hay while the clouds stayed away. The Belgian dispatched unseeded Dutchman Robin Hasse 6-2, 6-2 in what was their maiden meeting. The five-foot-five Rochus had won the Orleans Challenger before coming to Mumbai. 

Rochus will take on the winner of the first-round clash between lucky loser Purav Raja and Ivan Navarro, who is ranked No. 115 in the world. The Spaniard had won the first set 6-4 but was down 1-3 in the second when the elements interfered. 

Raja is the only Indian left in the singles draw after wild card Somdev Dev Varman was shown the door by Italian Fabio Fognini earlier in the day. 

Dev Varman (ranked 1035) became the third Indian to crash out of the singles draw when he went down 3-6, 6-7 (8-10) to Fabio Fognini (No. 112) in an hour and 34 minutes in a match that began Tuesday night. 

Dev Varman, winner of the prestigious US collegiate title, had his chances in the second set to force a decider. He fought back after being a break down to level scores at 6-6, but a couple of double faults hurt him in the tie-breaker. 

In other first-round matches, fourth seed Jarkko Nieminen (Finland) beat qualifier Davide Sanguinetti (Italy) 6-7 (5-7), 6-1, 2-0 (retired) to set up a meeting with Japanese Toshihide Matsui. 

Sixth seed Stefan Koubek of Austria, last years losing semi-finalist, defeated Chilean Paul Capdeville 6-3, 6-2 to set up a meeting with German Bjorn Phau.

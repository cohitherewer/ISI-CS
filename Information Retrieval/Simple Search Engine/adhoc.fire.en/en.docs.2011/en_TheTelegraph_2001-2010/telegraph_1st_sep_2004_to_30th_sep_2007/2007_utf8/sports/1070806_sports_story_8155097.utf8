 Same England XII for The Oval 

London: England will bid to salvage their series against India with an unchanged squad when they go for victory in the third Test at The Oval starting on Thursday. 

India lead the three-match series 1-0 after winning the second Test at Trent Bridge at the end of last month. The weather-affected first Test at Lords ended in a draw. 

While India fully deserved their victory at Trent Bridge, there were many positive aspects to our performance, England chairman of selectors David Graveney said on Sunday after naming the 12-man squad. 

We were particularly pleased with the way our inexperienced bowling attack performed and they will be hoping to build on that in the final Test, he said. 

Graveney said it was too soon to consider allrounder Andrew Flintoff and fast bowlers Stephen Harmison and Matthew Hoggard for selection despite good progress in their recovery from injury. 

Seam bowler Stuart Broad, 12th man in the previous two Tests, was retained. 

Well obviously look at the playing conditions to finalise the make-up of our attack, Graveney said. 

Graveney pointed to batting failings, however, as a possible reason for defeat in Nottingham when Englands last seven wickets falling for 68 runs following a second innings century from captain Michael Vaughan. 

The bottom line is that we lost the Test because we didnt get probably 50, 60 more runs in the first innings and certainly another 50 or 60 in the second innings. If India had had to chase 180 that might have been a different game, he said.

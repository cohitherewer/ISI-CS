 IHF ban on 3

New Delhi: In a strict measure to curb indisciplined

 conduct of players, the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) on Wednesday slapped

 a three-year ban on forward Tejbir Singh and goalkeepers Kamaldeep Singh and

 Maninder Singh for their unruly and disgraceful behaviour during

 the decider of the three-match PHL finals. 

These players were banned from taking part in any international and domestic tournaments during the period. They were also permanently debarred from participating in the PHL. 

The disciplinary committee of IHF, having considered the report and recommendations submitted by the tournament director (Shakeel Quereshi) on the unruly and disgraceful behaviour by particular members of Sher-e-Jalandhar, has decided to impose the punishment, IHF secretary K. Jothikumaran said on Wednesday. 

The prize money of Sher-e-Jalandhar was also slashed by 50 per cent after some of their players physically assaulted umpire Satinder Sharma.

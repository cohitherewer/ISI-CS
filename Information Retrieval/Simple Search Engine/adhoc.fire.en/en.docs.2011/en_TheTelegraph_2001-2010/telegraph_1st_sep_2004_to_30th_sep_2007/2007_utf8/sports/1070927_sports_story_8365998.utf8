The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 6 more steps to go: Pereira

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Carlos Roberto Pereira refused to dub his teams victory over George Telegraph lackadaisical, insisting they had the ammunition to cross six more steps in reclaiming the CFL Premier Division title. 

I dont think we played badly today After all, victory is what counts in football. We crossed one step today and there are six more steps to go. We are pretty confident about it, the Brazilian said after Wednesdays 3-0 win. 

Mohun Bagan will next take on Chirag United SC at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday in the seven-match second leg, scheduled to end on November 13. 

East Bengal, lying four points behind Mohun Bagan but with a match to spare, are the defending champions. 

Leading scorer Jose Ramirez Barreto, who netted a brace on Wednesday, admitted the team failed to rise to the occasion in the first half. We rectified some of our mistakes after the break, he said. 

Asked about his goal-scoring spree, Barreto said, Ive never been too concerned about personal goals. Nothing satisfies me more than contributing to the teams win, he said. 

Assistant coach Satyajit Chatterjee, though, believed the Federation Cup loss to East Bengal had played a negative part in the players performance on Wednesday. 

That loss (in Ludhiana) was a setback for us, the former India medio said.

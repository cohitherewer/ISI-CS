 Current lot doesnt train hard to be fit, says Joel Garner

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Joel Garner is just not happy with the current lot of fast bowlers. The former West Indies bowler, once known for ripping through the heart of the rival teams, feels that todays bowlers do not go through the right kind of training and that leads to fitness problems. 

Speaking in the capital on the sidelines of a function to promote Barbados tourism ahead of the World Cup, Garner said he doesnt believe that cricketers suffer from burnout syndrome if they play non-stop throughout the season. 

The current crop of bowlers do not do enough to keep themselves fit and then complain about too much cricket, said Garner on Tuesday. The fitness doesnt come in the gymnasiums. One has to do the running and bowl tirelessly. Thats the only solution. I think the present day bowlers dont do it. 

Asked what he would do if he was made Indias bowling coach, the towering figure of six feet eight inches gave out a hearty laugh. I dont want Chappells job. But then, it would be interesting to coach the young Indian fast bowlers. They have to work really hard if they like to improve. 

Garner felt there cannot be any off-season for cricketers. During our time there was no off season for us. We used to play for the state, country and the county without any break. We never spoke of burnouts those days. 

Asked to comment on India s chances in the coming World Cup, Garner said India have a good team, but it has to be more consistent to reach the final. The two teams that would make the final, will have to play consistently well for six weeks. To do well in one or two matches wont suffice. 

Another former great, Wesley Hall, who, too, was present to promote tourism in Barbados, said his country would host the best-ever World Cup. Our country has produced players like Garfield Sobers, Desmond Haynes, Gordon Greenidge, Everton Weekes, Clyde Walcott and Frank Worrell. West Indies is like one river and many streams, but we will show how well the World Cup could be organised. 

Unlike Garner, Hall said it was difficult to pick up two teams for the final. Aussies are certainly the best side, but the transition in their team might help others to some extent. West Indies havent won anything for a long time, but now we have a bunch of youngsters, who have matured. They, too, can deliver the goods.

 Taufel: Axe erratic umpires 

Melbourne: Simon Taufel, voted Umpire of the Year, has called for greater accountability from his colleagues and under-performing umpires to be axed from the ICC Elite Panel. 

The Australian said if umpires make several incorrect decisions in a Test or through a series, they should not be retained in the Elite Panel. 

We have now reached that point of reference where if match officials are being paid adequately, there needs to be greater accountability for performance and non-performance, Taufel said. (PTI)

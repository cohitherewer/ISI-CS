 Kumble all praise for Panesar 

London: Anil Kumble has lavished praise on Monty Panesar, saying the England left-arm bowler had quickly picked up nuances of spin bowling since his debut 18 months ago. 

From the start, I liked him he was steady, bowled with good control and he maintained attacking lines. And in the 18 months since then, you can see he has picked up the nuances of spin bowling very quickly, Kumble was quoted as saying by a daily on Friday. 

Kumble, who has achieved the feat of claiming all 10 wickets in an innings, said it was no surprise that Panesar was already a match-winner for his team. 

Im 100 per cent sure he has a long and successful Test career ahead of him. How many wickets could he take? If he remains a part of the team for 10 years, you are going to be talking hundreds, not dozens. 

Kumble said what was more creditable was that Panesar performed after being selected on the basis of an indoor practice session. 

For Monty to come through an audition and perform like that was very creditable. I like to see spinners do well because we are a rare breed and we have an important part to play in winning matches. 

I had never even heard of Monty before he came to Nagpur last year, but he certainly made a big impression both through the way he bowled and his celebration. 

You can only imagine the kind of joy he must have tasted when he dismissed an exceptional player like Sachin (Tendulkar) to claim his first Test wicket, he said. (PTI)

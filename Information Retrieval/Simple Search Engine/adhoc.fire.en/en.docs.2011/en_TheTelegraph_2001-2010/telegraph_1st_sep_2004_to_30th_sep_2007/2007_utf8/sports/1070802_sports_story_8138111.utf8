 Now, Sreesanth wants to apologise to Vaughan

Nottingham: A day after Michael Vaughan apologised to Zaheer Khan, Sreesanth has admitted that he was embarrassed by his on-field behaviour during the second Test at Trent Bridge and wanted to apologise to the England captain for the body barge incident. 

To be honest, Im embarrassed by what I did and I think I will have to change, Sreesanth told a TV channel that has the official telecast rights in India. 

I want to say sorry for that but no one should question my commitment, said Sreesanth, who was fined 50 per cent of his match fee for the incident. 

I am thankful to Rahul bhai (Dravid) for showing faith in me. He was upset with a few things, but after the game he came and told me when we were celebrating in the dressing room, Sree, after all this, after all the explanations I had to give for you, I still love you and want you to do well, Sreesanth said. 

The pacer said he did a few unwanted things during the second Test out of sheer frustration and wanted to make amends for that. 

Frankly, that was the worst part, may be thats the reason I did a few silly things like coming round the wicket to batsmen when I should have continued bowling the basic stuff. 

I was really feeling sad that I havent contributed. I was trying too many things and last two nights of the Test match slept clutching my India cap thinking it will get me luck, said the 24-year old, who has received a lot of flak in the British media for barging into Vaughan. 

However, Sreesanth said he did not hurl the beamer at Kevin Pietersen on purpose. 

Nothing is more dear to me than the game itself and I swear by this game that I was attempting a yorker but my wrist position went horribly wrong and it went as a beamer. 

See, I dont stride to the wicket, I sprint. Ask any cricketer and he will tell you that it is impossible to bowl a beamer with a run-up like mine. I had bowled two deliveries on a good length and was trying to bowl a yorker which went horribly wrong, he said. 

Sreesanth said he loved to play his game hard and a few errors could have emerged out of that. 

Look, Im a proud Indian and play the game hard. Im still new to international cricket and can have an odd slip but that doesnt mean Im not putting that extra effort. 

In fact, I was happy that I kept coming hard at the batsmen all day long but as an Indian I wear my heart on the cuff not even on the sleeve. 

Sreesanth, who has an interesting habit of writing letters to god before every game, said that he had hoped to play a crucial role in Indias Trent Bridge victory. 

Yes, I did write a letter to god before the fourth day of the Test. I wrote in that, tomorrow I will win the Test match for my country. I will be the one, god please help me. But it didnt go that way. Well, may be I didnt write my name in the end and god thought it came from Zaheer bhai, he said.

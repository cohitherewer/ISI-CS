Dubai: Mikhail Youzhny defeated Swedens Robin Soderling 7-5 6-2 at the Dubai Open on Friday to reach his second successive final. 

The unseeded Russian, winner in Rotterdam on Sunday. 

Both players lacked flair in the early stages, with Soderling saving a break point at 1-1 with an ace but then failing to win two break points of his own when leading 4-3. 

The unseeded Swede held off another break point at 4-4, but Youzhny, who beat Rafael Nadal in the previous round, finally earned the breakthrough when Soderling made a backhand error to lead 6-5. 

After serving out the first set to love, Youzhny broke again to lead 1-0 in the second, and Soderling was unable to rise to the challenge. 

Youzhny, cheered on by a sizeable crowd of Russian supporters, showed more variety and commitment and earned a further break for 5-2. 

On Thursday, defending champion Nadal slumped out losing 6-7, 3-6 to Youzhny. The disgruntled Spaniard then slammed the Hawkeye line calling system, accusing it of costing him the first set. 

Top seed Roger Federer also struggled but defeated seventh seeded Serb Novak Djokovic 6-3, 6-7, 6-3.

 England must axe Fletcher, Vaughan

Derek Pringle

Englands big moment in this World Cup was not matched by a correspondingly big performance as South Africa trounced them by nine wickets at the Kensington Oval on Tuesday. Setting South Africa a target of 155 following their most inept batting performance of the tournament, they were brushed aside as disdainfully as Ireland were by Australia here a few days ago (as reported in Wednesdays City edition). 

Boos from supporters echoed around the ground and South Africa celebrated a spot in the semi-finals the recriminations for England should be swift. The coach, Duncan Fletcher, must be replaced as quickly as is feasible to interview his potential replacements, while Michael Vaughan should concentrate on Test cricket whatever the pros and cons to his captaincy. He is not a one-day natural, something England have spent 85 matches finding out. 

As it has been all tournament, the overriding problem was Englands tame batting, despite Vaughan choosing to have first use of the pitch after winning the toss. In contrast, South Africa, not the most inventive side with the bat, showed what could be achieved with a bit of boldness and adventure. Looking for a swift kill, they knocked the runs off with unseemly haste in 19.2 overs, their captain Graeme Smith top-scoring with a scalding 89 from 58 balls. 

Instead of sticking to Englands risk-free plans at the start of the innings, a tactic that saw Vaughans team just 28 for one after 10 overs, Smith and AB de Villiers, looked for boundaries. Improvising wherever possible, theirs was a brutal assault from which even Andrew Fintoff was not spared. 

By the time England had caught their breath, the hundred was up in the 11th over and the game all but decided, though Smith added further insult by striking Flintoff three times in succession back over his head for four. 

Englands lack of form and adventure was bound to catch up with them at some stage. Granted, most of the pitches in the Caribbean have not been belters (this one had bounce but was a little two-paced), but there has been no Plan B to counter the better sides except to flounder about, hoping opponents will somehow implode. For that, the players, the coach, and a county system where one-day cricket is treated with casual disdain, must shoulder the blame. 

The only top-order batsman not impeded by either mindset or system is Kevin Pietersen, but that may be because his formative years were spent in South Africa. England have become over-reliant on him during this World Cup so when he failed, as he did on Tuesday when he was caught at mid-off by Smith off Andre Nel for three, the team was always going to suffer. 

Yet, with the dangerman nullified, even they must have been surprised by what followed as England collapsed to 121 for eight by the 38th over. 

The chief architect of that demise was Andrew Hall who finished with a career-best five for 18, his first five-wicket haul in one-day Internationals. 

With a bustling action, Hall cleverly mixed reverse swing and changes of pace to bring the middle part of Englands turgid innings to a virtual halt, despite the burgeoning partnership between Andrew Strauss and Paul Collingwood. The pair had added 58 for the fourth wicket until Strauss attempted one favourite slash too many off Jacques Kallis and was caught in the gully for 46. 

The dismissal set off a chain reaction, with four more falling in five overs, all of them to Hall. 

It might have been worse but for an unbeaten 27 from Ravi Bopara, which enabled the last two wickets to realise another 33 runs. Although still raw, Bopara has at least shown some spark and should be persevered with in the hope he is much-improved by the next World Cup. 

Not for the first time this tournament Flintoff was a disappointment with the bat. Waiting for Freddie to fire has become a weekly theme at press conferences. Well it hasnt happened yet and when Hall scuttled an effort ball through the gate to bowl him for five, the groan from the England fans in the biggest crowd of the tournament was audible. 

The bigger the stakes the cagier teams tend to be, though Englands openers took cat and mouse to extremes by leaving alone 10 of the first 12 balls. 

It was a bit like Fletchers first game in charge back in 1999, when Englands batsmen didnt know whether to stick or twist on a Johannesburg green top and ended up two runs for four wickets down.

Calcutta: Rudi Koertzen overtook David Shepherd and created a new umpiring record by standing in his 173rd ODI during the West Indies-England Super Eight match on Saturday, according to a ICC release. 

Koertzen has also officiated in 80 Tests. A member of the Elite panel since 2002, he stood in the 1999 and 2003 ICC World Cups, including the Australia-Sri Lanka semi-final in Port Elizabeth, which was his 100th ODI. 

Koertzen also stood in the 2002 and 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, the tsunami appeal match in Melbourne in January 2005 and the Super Series Test between Australia and the ICC World XI in Sydney.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Melbourne: Cricket may still be a far cry for Olympics but former Australia captain Steve Waugh will be a part of the countrys Beijing-bound contingent as he has been appointed an Athlete Liaison Officer (ALO) for the 2008 Games. Steve is a champion athlete and an inspirational leader and he will be a great asset to the team in Beijing, Australia Olympic Committee president John Coates said. Waugh, former Australian of the Year, lived in the Commonwealth Games village in Kuala Lumpur in 1998 when cricket was on the competition program. Australia won the silver medal, losing in final to South Africa. ALOs live in the Olympic village throughout the Games and play a key role mentoring athletes and creating team harmony.

 He will take on the support role alongside former Australia rugby captain John Eales and gold medal-winning swimmer Susie ONeill.

 Berlin: Former Germany captain and World Cup winner Lothar Matthaeus has made clear his interest in coaching Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich, his former club. Asked whether he could do the job, Matthaeus, who has been coach at Austrias Red Bull Salzburg since May, said: Of course. I am a Bundesliga insider and especially of Bayern, he added. And it must be clear to whoever looks at my life up to now: my goal has to be the Bundesliga, the former German captain told Bild.

 Rome: World Cup-winning coach Marcello Lippi said he was delighted after Italy returned to the top of Fifas world rankings for the first time in 14 years. Italy replaced Brazil at the top of the rankings, announced by Fifa on Wednesday. Its right that Italy are among the very top positions. It was absurd when the US were ranked third, the Czech Republic fourth, Lippi was quoted as saying in a local newspaper on Thursday.

 Sao Paulo: Two Palmeiras soccer fans were convicted of murder and each sentenced to 14 years in prison on Thursday for beating to death a 16-year-old Corinthians supporter nearly three years ago. A jury of seven convicted 31-year-old Edmilson Jose da Silva and 26-year-old Alessandro Almeida Borgers Pereira in the killing of Marcos Gabriel Cardoso Soares before a match in March 2004, court officials said in a statement.

 Rome: Catania have been ordered to play the rest of their home matches this season at neutral venues and behind closed doors as punishment for the violence that killed a policeman at a Serie A match this month. Meanwhile, Inter and AC Milan will play their next Champions League matches at the San Siro stadium although the crowd capacity will be limited, Uefa said on Thursday.

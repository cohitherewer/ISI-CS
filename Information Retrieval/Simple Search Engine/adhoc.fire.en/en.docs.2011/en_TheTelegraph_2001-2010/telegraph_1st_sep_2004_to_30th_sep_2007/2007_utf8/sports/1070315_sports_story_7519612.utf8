 Kenyans cruising 

Gros Islet: Tight bowling from Kenyas slow bowlers restricted Canada to 199 all out in the opening World Cup group C match on Wednesday. 

Kenya, semi-finalists in 2003, won the toss and elected to bowl with captain Steve Tikolo saying he expected moisture in a surprisingly bouncy pitch early on. 

 Kenya were well-placed, having reached 161 for three, 

 at the end of the 36th over. Opener Maurice Ouma scored 

 58. Steve Tikolo and Tanmay Mishra were batting on 51 and 

 13, respectively. 

However, Canada made a quick start and opener Geoff Barnett smashed five fours off a wayward 14th over from Nehemiah Odhiambo. 

Barnett perished the next over, however, when he tried to pull Peter Ongondo for six but was carefully caught on the rope by Tanmay Mishra. He top-scored with 41 from 50 balls with nine fours. 

Kenya spinners Jimmy Kamande and Hiren Varaiya then put the brakes on and Canadas dangerman Ashish Bagai was dismissed amid controversy for 19. Kamande finished with two for 25, Tikolo bagged two for 34 and Varaiya one for 19.

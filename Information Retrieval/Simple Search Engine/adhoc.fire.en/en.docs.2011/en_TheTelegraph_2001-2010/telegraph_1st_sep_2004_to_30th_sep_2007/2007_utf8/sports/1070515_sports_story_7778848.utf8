 Boro make it Gang of 5

FRANK PRAVERMAN

Middlesbrough have joined the fight for a legal challenge against West Ham Uniteds Premiership survival, according to Dave Whelan, the Wigan Athletic chairman. 

Already Sheffield United, who were relegated on the final day of the season Sunday, Wigan, Charlton Athletic and Fulham have formed the so-called Gang of Four, appealing against the Premier Leagues decision only to fine West Ham for irregularities surrounding the signings of Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano, rather than docking them points. 

Now Whelan claims the north east side have given them their full backing as well. 

Charlton, Sheffield United, Wigan, Fulham and Middlesbrough are all determined that we should get justice and West Ham should have been deducted points, Whelan said. THE TIMES, LONDON

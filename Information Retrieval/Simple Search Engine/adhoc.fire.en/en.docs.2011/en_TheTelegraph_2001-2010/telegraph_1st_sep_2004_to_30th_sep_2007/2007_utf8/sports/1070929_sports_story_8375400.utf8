The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Im captain on the field only, off it Im just a teammate: Dhoni

 - Indias ODI and Twenty20 captain looks back on triumph in SA and looks ahead 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL

 Bangalore: Mahendra Singh Dhoni lost his cellphone during the World Twenty20 in South Africa. That didnt lighten his baggage, though, as he came home with the trophy instead bringing joy not seen in decades. 

For Dhoni and his successful bunch, the world isnt quite the same any more. Not that they arent enjoying every minute. 

Despite the unbelievable demand on his time, Dhoni (now also Indias ODI captain) spoke to The Telegraph in his Grand Ashok suite on Friday afternoon. 

The following are excerpts: 

On the extent to which life has changed after Monday 

(Smiles) Changed in the sense that, for the next few days or weeks, it will be more difficult to move about freely... After that I suppose things are going to settle down... I havent, of course, changed as a person. Wont either. 

On when did he actually realise that hed captained India to a world title 

My mind went blank when Sreesanth prepared to take Misbah-ul Haqs catch... And, when he took it, my first thought was that wed become champions... I didnt straightaway think that I was the captain. 

On whether he has had time for a personal celebration 

Well, I told myself Ill live like a king for two days (from Wednesday afternoon)... So, I went to a party in Mumbai, where most of my teammates were also around... Really, I dont think I should be talking about everything! 

On gifting his shirt to a young fan after the final 

Uska naam bhi nahin maloom... I wore two shirts that day, the one with short sleeves is with me... That kid had been rooting for us and I wanted to thank him. There was nothing more to my gesture. 

On Indias World Twenty20 campaign 

We dropped a few catches, but did very well otherwise... The batters contributed and the bowlers did their bit... Our fielding was very good and made a big difference. Everybody wanted to do well... I could sense their hunger. 

On the standout moments for him 

Yuvraj Singhs six sixes in that one (Stuart Broad) over... Rohit Sharmas unbeaten 50 against South Africa... Harbhajan Singhs last over in the semi-finals versus Australia... Hed taken the ball from me and got Michael Clarkes wicket... There were other moments as well and what Im never going to forget is the way the players responded... They backed me and backed each other. 

On his pep talk during the break in the final 

The first thing I said was that wed scored more (157/5 vis-a-vis 141/9) than wed done in the group league stage... That while wed got 150-plus, Pakistan would need to get them... That if we got early wickets, the pressure would become too much as it was such a big stage... Pressure makes you do things you normally wont. 

On his thoughts after hed given the ball to Joginder Sharma for the last over 

Nothing... Having made the decision, there was nothing to think... Id shown confidence by giving him that responsibility and asked him to aim for two dot balls. 

On Sharma starting with a wide 

I asked him to stay cool and continue to aim for two dot balls... I also told him that, at worst, we would lose and that he must focus on the ball he wanted to bowl instead of thinking of the result... Think I asked him to smile a little, to relax. 

On remaining unflustered in tight situations 

The calmness comes naturally... One does get tense under pressure, but its best to stay cool... That way, the decision making doesnt get affected. Thats my belief. 

On whether using the slower bowlers in the bowlout against Pakistan (group league stage) was his most satisfying move 

I used the slower bowlers because theyd been the best during bowlout competitions within the team... 

On whether hes concerned that expectations have broken all barriers 

Look, I wouldnt like others to keep raising the bar... Its for me to decide on how to meet expectations... I dont like absorbing too much pressure for, then, the enjoyment diminishes... Im into cricket for the enjoyment it gives me and others. Of course, because of the environment, its difficult for an Indian cricketer to keep enjoying himself... Give one hundred per cent on the field and enjoy yourself off it is my advice. 

On having to handle three former captains (idol Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid) in the dressing room 

I dont see it as a problem... Theyve been around for so many years and it wont even be necessary to say anything to them. Im sure their presence will help me grow as captain. I mean, look at their experience... Each one of them has played over 300 ODIs... Im looking at things positively. 

On how he conducts himself in the dressing room 

I dont believe in talking too much... Dont believe in dwelling on theories and statistics... I prefer conveying my thoughts through one-on-ones. 

On his understanding of captaincy 

Im captain on the field only, off it Im just a teammate. Whether one is a superstar or a debutant, off the field, everybody should get an equal chance to enjoy himself. Youve got to enjoy playing for the country and youve also got to enjoy when you perform. Indeed, you cant keep thinking about cricket 24x7. 

On his first series as captain in ODIs being versus the world champions 

Its a challenge... Its a challenge to stay focused and as Ive said, one must also switch off... Cant be into cricket all the time. (After a pause) The Australians are known to start things, but Robin Uthappas response (fire with fire) is an indication that theyre going to find it very tough. Personally, I dont believe in saying things for the sake of saying them. 

On whether getting the captaincy in Tests too will be a logical progression 

I didnt talk of the World Twenty20 captaincy when I was vice-captain in ODIs and, as the Twenty20 captain, didnt speak of the ODIs... Today, as the ODI captain, I wont talk of the Test captaincy. It wouldnt be proper... There are 12 ODIs before the first Test and its important to be focused on whats bound to be tough cricket. 

Finally, on the reception he could get in home town Ranchi 

(Laughs) If they know when Im coming, it could well be on the lines of what happened in Mumbai the other day! Waisa ho sakta hai...

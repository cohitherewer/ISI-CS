Calcutta: Mohammedan Sportings substitute goalkeeper Gautam Das had a hand in denying his team full points against George Telegraph in the Sahara CFL Premier Division on Saturday. 

With 11 minutes from time and Shabbir Alis team leading 2-1, Das committed a horrendous mistake, fumbling to claim an innocuous Satyajit Bose cross from the right. Nurudeen Salau Olawale who gave George Telegraph a first-half lead snapped up the opportunity without trouble. 

Honours were thus split (2-2) between the sides at the Mohammedan Sporting ground. The home team logged their first point following their 0-1 loss to Peerless in the opening match, but it hardly satisfied the packed crowd. 

On the other hand, if Nigerian Nurudeens brace was reason for George Telegraph to celebrate, they vented their ire at referee Subrata Sarkar for his decision to award two spot-kicks against them. K. Kulothungan (33rd minute) and Roque Barreto (75th minute) had no trouble in converting them. 

What the home team lacked was agility of someone like Nurudeen upfront. Without a foreigner, Mohammedan Sporting will have their task cut out against East Bengal in their next match. 

Nurudeen put George Telegraph ahead in the third minute of the match. Fed by his countrymate Eric Erhisennobe Jenue, he outran Subhas Mondal and placed it in nicely to the right of the first-choice goalkeeper Sandip Singh Bist. 

The equaliser finally came in the 33rd minute, when substitute Biplab Adhikary tripped Jothi. 

The experienced official turned a deaf ear to George Telegraphs collective protests and blew whistle for the penalty kick. Kulothungan completed the formalities. 

But Mohammedan Sporting took the lead against the run of play through conversion of another spot-kick. This time Asto Karar tripped an advancing Muneer and Barreto who substituted Basudeb finished the job with a perfect conversion. 

But then, Das who came as Bists replacement under the Mohammedan Sporting bar in the second session made the mistake and Nurudeen was right there to ensure that his team took home something to relish.

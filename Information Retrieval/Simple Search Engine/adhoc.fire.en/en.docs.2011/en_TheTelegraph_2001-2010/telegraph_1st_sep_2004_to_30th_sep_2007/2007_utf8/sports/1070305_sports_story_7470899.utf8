 Big guns ready to warm up

Bridgetown: Hosts West Indies, England, South Africa and Sri Lanka will fire the opening shots in their World Cup campaigns on Monday with the start of the series of warm-up matches. 

West Indies, bidding to become the first host nation to win the title, face Kenya in Jamaica, England will look to pile up the runs against debutants Bermuda at St Vincent while the worlds leading team, South Africa clash with Ireland in Trinidad. 

Sri Lanka, the 1996 champions, will play Scotland in Barbados. 

At Kingstown, England captain Michael Vaughan will test his fitness after a combination of knee and hamstring injuries meant he has played in just three of his teams 35 one-dayers. 

He sat out the tri-series win over Australia when Andrew Flintoff took over the captaincy duties but plans to feature in some of the warm-ups before assessing his chances of playing in Englands opening game of the tournament against New Zealand on March 16. 

I will play a part against Bermuda and more so against Australia (in the second warm-up on March 9). It is a gradual process. 

Influential batsman Kevin Pietersen will also test his recovery from the rib injury sustained in Australia. 

South Africa coach Mickey Arthur insists the team have prepared well for a tournament which has brought them nothing but heartache in the past. 

It is all about peaking at the right time and I think, for us, things have been going nicely this season. We have shown an upward curve so hopefully our planning is coming to fruition, said Arthur. 

South Africa defeated Australia at home last year and have also won seven of their last eight matches. 

But they were knocked out in the World Cup first round on home soil in 2003 when they misunderstood the rain rules. 

Sri Lanka coach Tom Moody believes the 2007 World Cup will be the most open yet. 

I believe Sri Lanka has as good a chance as any. We just have to knuckle down and take our chances and prove our worth.

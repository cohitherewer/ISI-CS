 Henry divorce

London: French football star Thierry Henry divorced his wife of four years Claire Merry at Londons High Court on Monday. 

British reports speculated the big-earning striker, who plays for Barcelona, could face the biggest ever divorce payment by a footballer. 

Merry is expected to be entitled to a large chunk of his wealth estimated at around $50 million. 

Henry, 30, and Merry, 27, a British model and the mother of their two-year-old daughter Tea, met when they worked on television advertisements. 

The quickie divorce was granted by a judge at the principal registry of the High Courts family division.

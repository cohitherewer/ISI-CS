 Arsenal confirm Henry move

 Thierry Henry 

After weeks of speculation the news which Arsenal fans have been dreading finally came when it emerged that Thierry Henry has agreed to sign for Barcelona for 16 million (as reported in Saturdays Late City edition). This ends the French strikers eight-year career at the north London club. 

It is understood Arsenal and Barcelona had agreed to delay the announcement of Henrys signing for a week while manager Arsene Wenger secured his replacement. 

But that plan was wrecked after the story was broken by a Spanish radio station Friday evening. They quoted anonymous Barcelona sources who said that following weeks of negotiations the deal had been finalised. 

Arsenal confirmed on Saturday they had reached an agreement with Barcelona for the transfer of Henry. Arsenal Football Club can confirm that it has reached an agreement with Barcelona for the transfer of Thierry Henry. The deal is subject to a medical and the completion of formalities, the club said on its website. 

It was reported that the Spanish clubs vice-president Ferran Soriano clinched the deal with the 29-year-old forward following talks in London. 

News of the transfer comes just a week after Henry denied reports in a French sports newspaper that he had agreed to quit Arsenal. At this moment I am an Arsenal player and in the same situation as last year, he said. 

Even Thursday night Henrys agent Jerome Anderson, who has threatened to sue another French publication over claims he held talks with Soriano in the south of France two weeks ago, was denying any deal had been done. But, a year after Henry was linked with a move to Barcelona following their Champions League final victory over Arsenal in Paris, it is clear that Wenger has decided to cash in. 

The fee is lower than Arsenal were hoping for, but with Henrys 30th birthday approaching, Wenger knows his value was likely to diminish if he kept him for another season. Arsenal sources added that the agreement does not involve Samuel Eto. 

Henry, having stayed to lead Wengers young side in their first season at the new Emirates Stadium, now wants to finish his career at one of Europes biggest clubs. He has grown frustrated at the lack of big-name signings and European success as Arsenal restricted transfer spending to pay for their move from Highbury. 

The situation was exacerbated in April when former vice-chairman David Dein was forced out in a row with fellow directors over his backing for American Stan Kroenkes prospective takeover bid for Arsenal. 

But there will be mixed feelings over Henrys move, with most supporters more concerned about Wengers future. The manager has proved to be a shrewd judge when it comes to selling the clubs top players, as illustrated by the sale two years ago of Patrick Vieira to Juventus. 

 With the impasse over the Kroenke takeover likely 

 to restrict Wengers ability to strengthen his squad, 

 he knew he had to sell Henry to rebuild for next season.

 Im in the form of my life: Styris

Grenada: Scott Styris rich run-haul has been a major reason for New Zealand making it to the last four at the World Cup and the allrounder believes his side has what it takes to go all the way. 

This team is considered to have the first genuine opportunity to win the World Cup. If we hadnt made the semi-finals, it would have been a failure. 

Styris said the team is aiming at nothing less than lifting the Cup. 

If we win the semi-final and final, it would mean we deserved the estimation of this being the best New Zealand one-day side ever. If we dont, it would be a huge disappointment. 

The middle-order batsman is pretty impressed with his personal form. 

Im in the form of my life. I am pretty happy the way I am hitting the ball. I have planned and done well on these wickets, said Styris who, with 435 runs, is among the top five scorers in the competition so far. 

Only Jacques Kallis (480), Matthew Hayden (477) and Graeme Smith (441) are ahead of him. 

Styris admitted he had not expected such a turnaround after getting injured in the Champions Trophy in India and had resigned himself to a long haul to fitness. 

That injury was a dark moment. If you wait for your turn for months, it can wear you down. But as (coach) John Bracewell said, dont worry, take your time and I made sure I was alright. 

New Zealand will play their last Super Eight match against trans-Tasman rivals Australia on Friday, but Styris is not one to devalue the contest even though both teams have qualified for the semis. 

Anytime you play Australia you want to beat them. Its a great feeling, I promise you. 

I am sure they would be smarting a bit from their 0-3 result in New Zealand before the World Cup. They would come hard at us, which they do anyway, but particularly now. 

But we dont feel intimidated by Australia. We have played them often enough. They bring the best out of New Zealand, Styris claimed. 

The strength of both attacks has been their fast bowlers and Styris does not think the lack of pace in Caribbean surfaces was a disadvantage for the likes of Shaun Tait and Shane Bond. 

Somebody like Tait doesnt need a quick surface, he is as it is quick through the air. He doesnt need the pitch to be fast. He seems to take wickets in the middle overs which is a harder thing to do. 

As for Bond, he is probably bowling as quick as he has done in his career. Teams now have to be smarter against Bond for he is using his brain, he is outfoxing opponents and its not with just sheer speed, Styris said.

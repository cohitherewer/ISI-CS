 Castros no to world boxing

Havana: President Fidel Castro has announced that Cuba will not compete in the World Boxing Championship in Chicago after two Cuban boxers defected in Brazil last week. 

The tourney in Chicago presents a chance for promoters of US professional sports to steal athletes and damage the revolution in Cuba, he wrote in a newspaper column. 

However, the October 18-November 3 tournament is a qualifier for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. (AFP)

 Hari begins with a win over 

 Sutovsky

 - MONTREAL INTERNATIONAL CHESS

 P. Harikrishna 

Montreal: Grandmaster P. Harikrishna kicked off his campaign in the eighth Montreal International chess tournament with a thumping victory over GM Emil Sutovsky of Israel. 

Playing white against Sutovsky, Harikrishna was a picture of confidence as he got the better of Sutovskys Grunfeld defence in an emphatic endgame display that followed a fine opening and middle game. 

The victory propelled Harikrishna to joint lead after the first game along with Miton Kamil of Poland and Pavel Eljanov of Ukraine. 

Kamil scored a sensational upset victory over Nigel Short of England, while Eljanov scored over Canadian hope Pascal Charbonneau. 

The other two games of this 10-player round robin event ended in draws. Top seed Vassily Ivanchuk signed peace in quick time against Sergei Tiviakov of Holland while local star Mark Bluvshtein made his presence felt by holding US GM Gata Kamsky. 

Kamil was the other big gainer with a sparkling victory over Short who simply had a bad day in the office. The polish GM won after 49 moves. 

Mark Bluvshtein held Gata Kamsky in a routine affair arising out of a Slav defence. 

 In the other game of the day, 

 it was still a complicated position when Sergei Tiviakov 

 and Vassily Ivanchuk signed peace in just 23 moves.

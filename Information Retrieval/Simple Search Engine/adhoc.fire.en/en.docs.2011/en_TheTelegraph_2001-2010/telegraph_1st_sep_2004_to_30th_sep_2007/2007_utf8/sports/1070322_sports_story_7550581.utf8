 Sasikiran out of title race 

Zafra (Spain): GM Krishnan Sasikiran suffered a shock defeat against Gabriel Sargissian of Armenia and bowed out of contention for a top place in the Magistral Ruy Lopez International chess tournament here. 

As the events have turned out, the Indian, currently on 1.5 points, cannot win the meet even if he wins the remaining three games in the tournament. 

Meanwhile Ruslan Ponomariov bounced back in style and defeated overnight joint leader Manuel Perez Candelario of Spain. (PTI)

 Benaud to hear Gibbs appeal

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former Australia captain Richie Benaud will hear Herschelle Gibbs appeal against the ban of two Test matches imposed on him for breaching the ICCs Code of Conduct during the first Test against Pakistan in Centurion, according to a ICC release. 

Benaud is Australias nominee as a Code of Conduct commissioner and he has accepted the appointment to preside as the appeals commissioner for the hearing, which will take place via teleconference. 

The date for the appeal is still to be confirmed but is expected to be held between the second and third Tests of the ongoing series. The second match, in Port Elizabeth, is due to end on January 23 with the final Test in Cape Town set to begin three days later. 

The conduct of the hearing is at the discretion of the appeals commissioner and he has seven days to hear and determine the case. The decision handed down is final and binding. 

Gibbs was found guilty of a Level 3 offence, clause 3.3 of the Code which prohibits using any language or gestures that offends, insults, humiliates, intimidates, threatens, disparages or vilifies another person on the basis of that persons race, religion, colour, descent or national or ethic origin.

New Delhi: On Tuesday, when Syria took on Kyrgyzstan in the crucial ONGC Nehru Cup tie, the entire Indian coaching staff took their seats in the VIP box of the Ambedkar Stadium well before the start. 

In the end, when Syria notched up a 4-1 win to take their tally to six points from two matches, Indian national coach Bob Houghton was lost deep in thought. 

Houghton didnt talk about his impression on the match but other members of the staff agreed that Syria could be a tough nut to crack when India take on the West Asian side on Thursday. 

Please dont mention my name, but even Kyrgyzstan could be tough, said a team official. They lost but are slowly opening up. 

The official was not far from the truth. Syria have a kind of compact game that could always trouble the Indians. The tall Kyrgyzstanis packed their defence with seven men after they found the rather unexpected equaliser but the Syrians still managed to draw them out to score three more goals. 

Ability to play both long ball and short passes with equal fluency is Syrias biggest advantage. They have a fine striker in skipper Maher Al Sayed, who put his team in the lead in the seventh minute with a resounding shot from the top of the box. 

An own goal by Ali Dyeb helped Kyrgyzstan restore parity. It was, however, no reflection on the trend of the match. The Syrians were a much superior side and again took the lead in the 43rd minute through Zyad Chaabo. 

In the second half, the Syrians were all over. While Mohammed Alzeno got the third goal in the 70th minute off a Maher Al Sayed pass, Abrahiem Al Hasan made it 4-1 in the 81st minute.

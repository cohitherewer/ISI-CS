The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sao Paulo rout Kerala XI 3-0 

Kochi: There is no stopping Sao Paulo. Asserting their supremacy, the Brazilians now overwhelmed Kerala XI 3-0 in the fourth match of the Super Soccer series at the Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium on Thursday. 

They have scored 14 goals so far and are yet to concede one. 

The Kerala XI, virtually the state Santosh Trophy team, found it tough to contain the visitors. 

After a barren first half, the visitors drew first blood in the 51st minute through captain Marco Antonios booming shot. 

Hardworking medio da Silva scored the second goal in the 64th and the inspirational Anderson Hernanes completed the tally in the 85th minute. 

The marauding Brazilians had earlier crushed East Bengal 3-0 in Siliguri, Mohammedan Sporting 6-0 in Jamshedpur and Mohun Bagan 2-0 in Calcutta. 

Against the Keralite challengers, the Brazilians, who dominated most of the play, maintained a steady flow of forays into the rivals goalmouth. 

Hernanes and Da Silva always spelt danger whenever they had the ball. 

Inspired by Antonios brilliant scheming and through-passes, the Brazilian frontline launched a series of attacks against Kerala in the second session. 

Kerala goalkeeper Renjith had a harrowing time under the bar as the speedy Brazilian forwards tested him with powerful shots frequently. (PTI)

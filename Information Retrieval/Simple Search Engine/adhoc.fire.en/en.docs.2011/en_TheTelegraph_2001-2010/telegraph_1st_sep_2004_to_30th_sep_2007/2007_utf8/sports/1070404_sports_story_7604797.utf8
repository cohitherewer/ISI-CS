 Pak senator threatens hunger strike

Karachi: Blaming PCB chairman Naseem Ashraf for Pakistans World Cup debacle, a senator has threatened to go on hunger strike from the first day of the senate session if the board chief was not sacked. 

Pakistan cricket is going to the dogs I have decided to go on a token hunger strike when the senate session begins in Islamabad from May 1, senator Enver Baig of the Benazir Bhutto-led Pakistan Peoples Party said. 

Baig said President and PCB patron-in-chief Pervez Musharraf had disappointed the entire nation by not accepting the resignation of Ashraf for his role in the pathetic performance of the national team in the World Cup. 

We have been hearing for days now that the new constitution of the board would be enforced and the old system of governance by elected representatives would be restored but nothing has happened so far, Baig said. (PTI)

 Australia champions, India third

Ipoh: A 56th minute goal by Sardara Singh guided India to a 1-0 victory over Asian Games champions Korea and finish third in the 16th Sultan Azlan Shah Cup eight-nation hockey tournament here on Sunday. 

Later in the day, Olympic champions Australia overcame a spirited but disjointed Malaysia 3-1 to win the title. 

Goals by Edward Ockenden (39th, 41st) and Russell Ford (53rd) set up the Aussie victory while the Malaysians drew some consolation from Jiwa Mohans penalty corner in the last minute of the game. The Indians dominated the proceedings so much that they could have won the playoff for 3-4 positions by a bigger margin. 

Meanwhile, it was Australias third title in four years and fifth overall, as they proved far too superior for the Malaysians.

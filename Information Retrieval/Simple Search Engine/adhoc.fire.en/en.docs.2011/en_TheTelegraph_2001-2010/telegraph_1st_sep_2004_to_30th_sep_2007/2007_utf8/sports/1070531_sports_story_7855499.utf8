 Woods in a dilemma

Bethesda (US): The worlds No. 1 golfer is a very busy man these days. His wife is preparing to give birth to the couples first child, while Tiger Woods is giving birth to his first US PGA Tour meet. 

Theres something called the US Open coming up, too. 

My time management skills are going to be tested, Woods said. But, then again, these are all things that are very exciting: hosting my first Tour event, playing in the US Open, and above all, the birth of our first child... Thankfully, I dont sleep much. 

His voice turned down a notch, Woods dropped by the Congressional Country Club on Tuesday to promote the AT amp;T National, which will be run by his foundation from July 5-8. Those dates are important, because thats around the time his wife Elin is due to deliver. 

My intent is to play, Woods said. But my wife has something to say about that. Especially for the inaugural event, I want to be here. But as everyone understands, our No. 1 priority in our lives is our child. You only get to witness it for the first time only once. 

Woods said its been difficult delegating his time because he wants to be hands-on with an event associated with his name. Its a rushed job because the tournament wasnt announced until March, after the meet in Denver vacated the July date. 

Its hard work, Woods said. It really is. You dont do this with golf tournaments, especially on this scale. It just doesnt happen. 

We wanted to make this a family atmosphere, Woods said. A lot of times I play tournaments around the world where the prices of tickets are basically out of control. 

Woods also has been recruiting fellow golfers to play in the tournament. But they, like him, set their schedules well in advance. 

Ernie Els wont be coming hell be in Europe. Phil Mickelson probably wont play, either. Vijai Singh is up in the air, according to Woods. 

Jim Furyk, Adam Scott, Davis Love III, Darren Clarke, Charles Howell III and Stuart Appleby are among those who have accepted spots in the by invitation only, 120-man field. 

Maybe itll get a little bit better as it gets little closer, but right now its real difficult, Woods said. (AP)

 Ranadeb on the rampage

 - Mediumpacer bags 7/25 

Hyderabad: Speedster Ranadeb Bose rattled the Hyderabad batting line-up with a seven-wicket haul to put Bengal on course of a victory on the penultimate day of their Ranji Trophy Super League Group B encounter at the Visaka International Stadium, Uppal here Thursday. 

In a dramatic round, the hosts, after bowling Bengal out for 200 and acquiring a first innings lead of 109 runs, collapsed for 76 runs in their second essay with the young Bengal pacer recording a splendid figure of seven for 25. With this, he took his match haul to 10 wickets. 

Needing 186 for an outright victory (and four points), the visitors were 72 for two at the close of Day Three with Avishek Jhunjhunwala (25) and Manoj Tewari (19) at the crease. On the final day Friday, Bengal further need 114 runs to win with eight wickets in hand. 

Resuming at 172 for seven, Bengal folded up their first innings at 200 with only Laxmi Ratan Shukla showing some resistance with a defiant 46 as young Absolem returned with a five-wicket haul and Hyderabad gained an upper hand with a first innings lead of 109 runs. 

However, Ranadeb turned the tide in favour of Bengal by maintaining a good line and length and sending the Hyderabad batsmen back to pavilion in quick successions. 

Of the Hyderabad batsmen, only three openers T. Soman (23), P.K. Reddy (16) and D.B. Ravi Teja (11) managed to get to double figures. 

In reply, Bengal despite losing openers Arindam Das (10) and Amitava Chakraborty (8) early, Jhunjhunwala and Tewari saw off the day without further damage.

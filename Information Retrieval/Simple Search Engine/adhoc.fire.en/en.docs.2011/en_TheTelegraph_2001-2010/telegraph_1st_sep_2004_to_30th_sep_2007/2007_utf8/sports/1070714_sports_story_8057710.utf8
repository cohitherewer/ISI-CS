Maracaibo: Brazils players have rejected the idea that Argentina will start as favourites in Sundays Copa America final. Argentina have brought a full strength-team and have cruised to the final, scoring 16 goals on their way to winning all five games. 

Brazil, on the other hand, kicked off with a 0-2 defeat against Mexico and needed a penalty shootout to beat Uruguay in their semi-final. 

The defending champions are also without Kaka and Ronaldinho, who asked to be rested from the tournament. We cant talk about favourites before the game has even started, said midfielder Elano. These are two great teams. Anything can happen on the day. 

Anderson said: They have excellent players with excellent quality but so do Brazil. 

Brazil met Argentina in the final in similar circumstances three years ago in Peru. On that occasion, Argentina were also favourites and Brazil were missing several regular players. 

Despite that, Brazil forced a 2-2 draw and then won on penalties. Weve suffered a lot to get here, said midfielder Diego. The target is the same as usual, to be champions. There are a lot of coincidences and we have to take the positive things onto the pitch. We hope to obtain the same success as last time. There are no favourites. 

Meanwhile, Lionel Messi, touted as Argentinas next Maradona, has a chance this weekend to claim a championship, never won by the soccer great: the Copa America. 

The 20-year-old, referred to as Messidona in Spain, hopes to avoid repeating the Copa futility of his famed predecessor. Diego Maradona played in three South American championships in 1979, 1987 (in Argentina) and 1989 but couldnt even lead the Albiceleste to a final. 

The parallels between the two are impressive. 

Both stout left-footers were crowned the best player in Argentinas 1979 and 2005 championship runs at under-20 World Cups, respectively, and both debuted in Europe for FC Barcelona, Maradona at 21 and Messi at 17. 

When Messi dribbled out of Barcelonas half, past six defenders, and scored against Getafe in the Copa Del Rey semi-final in April, the goal was celebrated around the world, and compared to Maradonas solo score against England in the 1986 World Cup. 

Last month, a sneaky touch-in with his hand drew more comparisons with Maradonas Hand of God goal in the 1986 World Cup. At the Copa America, Messi has become the tournaments star attraction, even when hes not on the field. 

After Argentina qualified for the quarter finals, coach Alfio Basile decided to rest the man Argentines affectionately call La Pulga, or Flea, for the final group match against Paraguay. 

But 66 minutes into a scoreless draw, Basile yielded to chants of Messi, Messi by mostly Venezuelan fans and subbed in the 1.70-meter (5-foot-7) striker, whose cross 12 minutes later was deflected in by Javier Mascherano for a 1-0 victory.

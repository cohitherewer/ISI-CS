 All eyes on Pathan

 - DEODHAR TROPHY 

 Raina ruled out 

Ahmedabad: All eyes will be on Irfan Pathan when he takes the field for West Zone against Central in Deodhar Trophy on Sunday. 

[As first reported by The Telegraph on Tuesday, chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar, on Sunday, will take a final decision on whether to send the beleaguered pacer to the World Cup]. 

Pathan, who features in the 15-member World Cup squad, is yet to prove his fitness to the selectors before boarding the Caribbean-bound flight later this month. 

The left-arm seamer, suffering from sore shoulder, claimed that he was fit during promotional visits to Ahmedabad and Delhi. 

Pathan arrived well in advance at Motera on Friday and had an extended nets session. Vengsarkar, who flew in from Mumbai, watched him. 

Pathan has been out of form since Indias tour of the West Indies in May 2006, where he took just four wickets and contributed 24 with the bat. His bad patch continued in South Africa, where he was sent back midway through the tour. 

However, West Zone coach Chandrakant Pandit feels the mediumpacer is a class act and an important member of the side. Pathan looks fit. He bowled and batted well in the nets today (Saturday). It does not appear that he has any problem, Pandit said. 

Meanwhile, in a blow for Central Zone, Suresh Raina has been ruled out of the entire Ahmedabad-leg owing to a knee-injury, which he sustained in the National one-dayers recently. Raina has been ruled out and will be replaced by Ravikant Shukla for the first two one-dayers, Central manager said on Saturday.

Melbourne: In a classic match worthy of a final, fifth-seeded Andy Roddick outlasted Marat Safin 7-6 (7-2), 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-2) on Friday to reach the fourth round of the Australian Open. 

Safin, the 2005 champion and former world No. 1, was seeded only 26th after coming back from a knee injury that kept him from defending his title last year. That meant one of the highly- ranked players would have to face him early in the two-week tournament. 

Roddick, seeded sixth, drew the unenviable task and showed his confidence was high again after a malaise that dropped him out of the top 10 last year before he convinced Jimmy Connors to coach him. He now faces No. 9 Mario Ancic. 

Serena Williams, also plagued by a bad knee last year and unseeded after winning here in 2005, rallied after No. 5 Nadia Petrova served for the match at 6-1, 5-3, showing that she still has superior skills and a strong will to win. 

Top-ranked Roger Federer had an easier time against 25th-seeded Mikhail Youzhny, beating last years US Open semi-finalist 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5). 

Second-seeded Amelie Mauresmo, the defending womens champion, beat Eva Birnerova and next plays Lucie Safarova, who won the first set before Anastasiya Yakimova retired with a back injury. Third seed Svetlana Kuznetsova beat fellow-Russian Maria Kirilenko and No. 7 Elena Dementieva advanced over Maria Elena Camerin of Italy. 

Also advancing were No. 10 Nicole Vaidisova and No. 16 Shahar Peer. 

Serenas 1-6, 7-5, 6-3 victory over Petrova was impressive for a woman who dropped out of the top 100 for the first time since 1997 before climbing back to 95th in the year-end rankings. 

Federer, bidding for a 10th major, extended his winning streak to 32 matches and 10 straight at Melbourne Park. 

Federer was far from perfect he had 33 unforced errors to go with his 40 winners but he still made Youzhny look ordinary much of the time, using his great anticipation to retrieve what appeared to be winners and often leaving the Russian flat-footed and awkward by cleverly disguising his own shots. 

Federer next faces 14th-seeded Novak Djokovic, who beat Thailands Danai Udomchoke. Mardy Fish advanced when veteran Wayne Arthurs retired while trailing 3-0 in the first. 

No. 16 David Ferrer rallied from two sets down to beat No. 20 Radek Stepanek 6-7 (5), 4-6, 6-0, 6-4, 6-3. 

No. 18 Richard Gasquet beat Gael Monfils 6-0, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3 in a match between two former world No. 1 juniors from France. Monfils had ousted last years losing finalist Marcos Baghdatis in the second round.

Chandigarh: Rajpal Singh has attributed Indias Asia Cup triumph to coach Joaquim Carvalhos mantra of team spirit and healthy work ethics, which created a friendly atmosphere. 

We had the right plans and strategies, but Carvalho polished them, Rajpal said while interacting with reporters here on Tuesday. Team work has been superb and all of us have been playing like a cohesive unit. 

After the back-to-back debacles in the World Cup and Asian Games, the hockey team got Carvalho at the helm. 

He led the team to bronze medals in the Azlan Shah Cup and Champions Challenge in Belgium before retaining the Asia Cup. 

There is no time to relax. We want to continue the winning streak. Our coach has stressed that we should not feel satisfied with just one performance, said Rajpal at a function where the forward, midfielder Jaswinder Singh and goalkeeper Baljit Singh were honoured by Chandigarh Hockey Association on Tuesday. 

Rajpal, who struck two goals in the Asia Cup final, said the team had worked hard on its weak areas like conceding goals in the dying minute. 

We have tried to curb our tendency to concede goals in the first ten and the last ten minutes of the game. The coaching camp before the tournament helped a lot, he said. 

According to the striker, scoring field goals was the teams strength and they had been constantly working on penalty corner conversion. 

In the final against South Korea, our opponents got five penalty corners as against two earned by us. However, all the seven goals we struck were field goals, he said. 

The striker said the team had a bigger task ahead as they had to qualify for the Beijing Olympics. 

Qualifying for the Olympics is going to be our next goal. A win there is our ultimate dream, the player said. 

All three players agreed that Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Chak De! India motivated the team during the Asia Cup.

 Robin hopes to improve fielding

Chennai: Delighted at his appointment as Team India fielding coach, former allrounder Robin Singh Saturday expressed confidence that he would help the side improve its standards to match the top two teams in the world. 

I am really elated at being appointed fielding coach. The Indians arent one of the best fielding sides. I am confident on impr-oving the standards to match the top two teams in the world, he said. 

I am happy to be involved with the senior team of which I had been a member for a long time, he added. 

In Bangalore, bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad was also pleased with his appointment. 

Ive not really formulated any plan as such. As of now its great news for me and Im really looking forward to working with the fast bowlers. Its a great opportunity and also a great honour to be part of the Indian team, Prasad told a website. 

As of now, Im looking forward to having a chat with the fast bowlers and figuring out the areas we can work on. It wont be right on my part to go ahead and formulate the plans Its not about me Its about the fast bowlers who are there in the team and a few others who are outside the team as well. 

I believe that its all about the individual (and his specific needs). So I would really like to talk, one-on-one with the fast bowlers and agree on a common area that we need to work upon. Its all about trust and confidence, whether its the players having trust in their coach, or the coach trusting his players said Prasad. (agencies)

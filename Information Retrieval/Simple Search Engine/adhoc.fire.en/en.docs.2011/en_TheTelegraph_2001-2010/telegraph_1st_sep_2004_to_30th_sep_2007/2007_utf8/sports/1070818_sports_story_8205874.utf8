 29 contract equine flu in Japan 

 Tokyo: An outbreak of equine influenza has forced the Japan Racing Association (JRA) to cancel horse races on Saturday and Sunday, local media reported.

 The JRA decided to cancel the races after 29 of 163 horses checked were determined to have contracted flu, the Nikkan sports newspaper reported on Friday.

 It is the first time in 36 years that the JRA has cancelled races due to horse flu. The previous cancellation lasted for about two months, from late December 1971.

 A JRA official did not make it clear when races will resume, only telling a press conference: We would like to resume races as early as possible after the situation has settled.

 Whilst contagious among horses, 

 equine influenza cannot be caught by other animals and humans, 

 according to the JRA.

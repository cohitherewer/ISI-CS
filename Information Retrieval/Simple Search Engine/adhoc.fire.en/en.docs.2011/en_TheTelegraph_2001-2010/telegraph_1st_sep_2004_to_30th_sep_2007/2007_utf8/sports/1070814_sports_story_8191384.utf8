 Harikrishna beats Korchnoi

 - Hungary meet 

 Harikrishna 

Paks (Hungary): P. Harikrishna toppled tournament leader Viktor Korchnoi of Switzerland to take sole lead after the seventh round of the Marx Gyorgy Memorial International chess tournament here. 

The defending champion, who started off with a loss and three draws in the category-14 tournament, scored his third victory on the trot and has now emerged as the favourite for his second successive title with 4.5 points. 

Korchnoi and Csaba Balogh of Hungary share the second spot on four points each. Peter Acs of Hungary is fourth in the standings with 3.5 points, half a point ahead of compatriot Ferenc Berkes, while Chinese Hou Yifan remains at the bottom of the tables with two. 

Besides Harikrishna, Balogh was the other winner of the day, defeating Yifan. 

The former world junior champions victory against Korchnoi came easily. At 77, the Legendary Swiss GM is clearly past his prime but the agility with which he carries out his moves on board is still a spectators delight. 

Playing white, Harikrishna faced the Queens Gambit Accepted and got a slight advantage typical of the opening. Korchnoi, however, had his pieces controlling key squares but a rook lift from the queen side did the trick for Harikrishna. 

Just while the attack was building, Korchnoi crumbled and found himself in an opposite colour bishops endgame with a pawn less. Harikrishna converted the material advantage into a full point after 43 moves. 

Its nice to be on the winning side again, I think he misjudged the potential in my position, it was a new position for me but after I found this king side attack plan, I thought I was already better, Harikrishna said. 

In the last three rounds, Harirkishna has two black games scheduled against Berkes and Balogh, while his remaining white will be against Yifan. 

To get some important rating points, Harikrishna needs to score minimum 6.5 from the tournament while anything over and above this figure will add to his present rating. 

Meanwhile, in the Paks Cup GM tournament, Tania Sachdev was held by lowest ranked Pataki Gyozo of Hungary in the eighth round. 

She will now need a win against GM Vladislav Nevednichy in the final round to get her second IM norm. GM Attlia Groszpeter of Hungary regained sole lead in the tournament defeating Krisztian Szabo.

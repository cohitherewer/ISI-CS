 Mumbai seek a double

Jaipur: Hosts Rajasthan will challenge Mumbais might when the two teams meet in the final of the National one-dayers final at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium here on Wednesday. 

Rajasthan are buoyed by their stunning three-wicket win over star-studded Punjab in the semi-finals while Mumbai are coming after defeating Uttar Pradesh by one wicket. Mumbai, now, must be eyeing their one-day title after they won the Ranji Trophy this year beating Bengal in the final. 

Rajasthan may look a bit inexperienced but they have good opening pair in Rohit Sharma and Sidhartha Joshi. 

Mumbai look better with Indian stars like Wasim Jafar, Ramesh Powar and experienced campaigners in Amol Majumdar, Nilesh Kulkarni, Avishkar Salvi in their ranks. They also have a well-balanced bowling and batting which have won them few tournaments this season. (PTI)

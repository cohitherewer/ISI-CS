 Botham for Moody as England coach

Melbourne: Ian Botham wants England coach Duncan Fletcher to step down after the World Cup and has backed Australian Tom Moody to take over from him. 

Next months World Cup marks the end of a natural four-year cycle, and I expect England to start next summer against the West Indies under new management preferably with Tom Moody running the show, the legendary allrounder said. 

Moody may be an Aussie, but he is innovative, dynamic and hes done an excellent job in charge of Sri Lanka. I only hope Lords have the guts to employ him, Botham wrote in his column in a British newspaper. 

Englands woeful performance in Australia they lost the Ashes series 0-5 has led to repeated calls for Fletcher to resign. 

Moody, in charge of Sri Lanka, emerged front-runner after he withdrew from the race to succeed John Buchananp. Botham said England owed Fletcher a huge debt for transforming the side from being the worst Test team in the world in 1999 to Ashes victors in 2005.

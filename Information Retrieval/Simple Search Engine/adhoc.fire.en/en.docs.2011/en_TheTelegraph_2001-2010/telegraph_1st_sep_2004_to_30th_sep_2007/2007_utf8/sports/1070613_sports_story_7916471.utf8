 McLaren favours Hamilton: Alonso

 Fernando Alonso 

Madrid: Two-time Formula One champion Fernando Alonso complained on Tuesday that rookie teammate Lewis Hamilton is getting preferential treatment from the McLaren team. 

Two days after the 22-year-old Englishman won the Canadian Grand Prix to move into first place in the F1 standings, the Spanish driver sounded off. 

From the first moment, I wasnt comfortable with everything, Alonso said on Cadena Ser radio. 

Its an English team, with an English teammate. You know that all of the help goes his way. Ive understood that from the first moment and, well, Im not moaning about it. 

Alonso finished seventh in Montreal and fell eight points behind Hamilton in the championship. Hamilton has finished on the podium in all six races so far this season. 

Im relaxed, the reigning world champions said. Im good, though I know there is some impatience for the way I arrived and how I am expected to dominate. Im where I want to be and I have clear options for winning the title, which is what we want.

 Bowlers fail to make a mark in abandoned tie

 - WARM-UP MATCH 

 - Solanki, Wright among runs 

 Ramesh Powar took three for 52 

Northampton: Rain godsplayed pranks again as Indias warm-up one day match against England Lions was abandoned on Saturday following heavy shower at the Northamptonshire County Club ground here. 

Batting first, England Lions amassed 296 for eight from their allotted 50 overs with Vikram Solanki (60) and Luke Wright (56) notching up half centuries. 

Chasing a stiff task of scoring 297 runs for victory in 50 overs, India were 32 without loss after 6.5 overs when rains ruled out any further play. 

Sourav Ganguly was 18 not out (29b, 3x4) while Robin Uthappa was batting on 12 (12b). 

The Indians now move to Southampton for the first match of the seven-match one-day series to be played on August 21. 

Off-spinner Ramesh Powar and leggie Piyush Chawla conceded 104 runs for their 20 overs collectively prizing out four wickets between themselves. That effectively put the brakes on the Lions scoring as they slipped from 108 for one in the 18th over to 149 for five in the 25th over. 

However, Ravi Bopara (37) and Paul Nixon (39) did a good rescue job, adding 77 runs for the sixth wicket before Chris Schofield (35) and Tim Bresnan (32 not out) provided the necessary fireworks at the death scoring 61 runs in seven overs for the seventh wicket to boost their tally.Both Zaheer Khan (7-0-57-0) and Munaf Patel (9-0-60-1) were off-colour on Saturday while Powar did well to claim three for 52 from his 10 overs. 

India, however, did not start too badly. After Mahendra Singh Dhoni called correctly in his first match as India captain, Ajit Agarkar gave his side a perfect start removing Darren Maddy (6) as early as in the fourth over of the innings. But once Wright came to the wicket he made light work of the Indian bowling. 

Just when England Lions looked like running away with the game, Powar removed the dangerous Wright in his first over as the batsman tried to flick one off his legs and the ball came off the face off his bat for Dhoni to take a one-handed catch. 

Ian Bell (21) looked to be in great hurry, hitting Powar over mid-on and extra cover for two consecutive fours as Powar tossed the ball up to him. To his credit, the spinner displayed a big heart in again tossing up the next one that lured bell to play a false stroke that landed safely into the hands of Agarkar at deep mid-wicket. 

 In his next over, Powar picked up his third wicket 

 on a trot when he had Owais Shah out leg before for just 

 one.India brought back Zaheer resting Rudra Pratap Singh 

 while Dinesh Karthik and Rahul Dravid made way for Rohit 

 Sharma and Sourav Ganguly.

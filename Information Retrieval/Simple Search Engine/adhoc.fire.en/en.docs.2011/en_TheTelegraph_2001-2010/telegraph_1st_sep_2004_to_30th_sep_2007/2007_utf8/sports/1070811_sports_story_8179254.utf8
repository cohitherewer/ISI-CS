 Sanias run ends

 - I am mentally and physically tired right now 

 Sania Mirza in Carson on Thursday 

Los Angeles: Tired after weeks of hectic tennis, Sania Mirza was upset by Frances Virginie Razzano in a nail-biting singles pre-quarter finals at the $600,000 East West Bank Classic. 

Sania was ousted by the 52nd-ranked French woman, who pulled off a 6-1, 7-6 (8-6) win to reach the quarter finals of the Tier II tournament on Thursday. 

The Indian star, who reached career-best 30th after defeating at least five top-20 players in the recent weeks, said she was tired and could not give her best in the match. I have been playing great tennis for the last four weeks. I am mentally and physically tired right now, Sania said. 

(Im) not taking anything away from her though, she played very well. There is a lot of depth in womens tennis. She played great tennis and I didnt. I was not at my best and she came out firing on all cylinders. It was not a great match. I did not even play close to what I usually do, she added. 

Sania, who clinched a three-setter doubles win alongside her American partner Bethanie Mattek a day before, said the match had drained her off. 

Meanwhile, Sania is likely to get an invitation from Pakistan to add glamour quotient to a bilateral tennis series later this year. 

According to local media in Karachi, Pakistan Tennis Federation (PTF) officials are planning to invite the Indian star to play a mixed doubles event with Leander Paes and the countrys new tennis star Aisam-Ul Haq Qureshi and Nida Waseem.

 Bronze for Sodhi 

New Delhi: Ronjon Sodhi on Wednesday won the double trap bronze at the Shooting World Cup in Santo Doingo, Dominican Republic, but missed out on an Olympic quota berth by two points. 

Sodhi shot 187/200 to claim his second medal of the championship but the score was not enough to ensure him an Olympic berth, according to a National Rifle Association of India release.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Curator makes no promise

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Eleven years after he made an unceremonious exit, Kalyan Mitra is back as curator at Eden Gardens. He was castigated after India lost the World Cup semi-final to Sri Lanka in 1996 for producing a wicket that was described as a devils paradise. 

I was made a scapegoat, Mitra recalled. This was done by a section of the CAB officials to save somebody elses skin. I was just a pawn in their dealings. I felt enough was enough and decided to sever my links. 

It was only after a change of guard at the CAB that Mitra was brought back. The former Bengal cricketer and coach took charge in July and began preparations for the Test versus Pakistan, which starts November 30. 

I began working on the wicket from July 15. There isnt enough time and so I havent gone for a complete relaying of the track. Ive only concentrated on overhauling the top soil layer, he said. 

Mitra is not making any promises. It is very difficult to predict the nature of the wicket at this stage I have no idea about its base. It was done up after 1996 and so I am not in a position to judge its nature. 

I sought inputs from the players, umpires and others concerned once I took charge Their main grievance was that the wicket was slow and low. On inspection, I was surprised to find one of the strips in the square devoid of any grass 

One good thing is that the BCCI wants sporting wickets and the captains will have absolutely no say in the lead up to the Test. If the grass binds the wicket, it will be a little quicker and have bounce Till now I am positive about the work in progress, he said. 

The last two days deluge, however, has him slightly worried. The ground will take at least 5/6 days to dry The grass has just been sowed and I only hope fungus doesnt affect the work. Then well have to begin all over again. 

Im not giving any assurance but hopefully things will take a turn for the better. Theres still a couple of months to go. Only once the rolling is done I will get a fair idea of the wicket, he added. 

Mitra may go for a complete relaying once the season gets over.

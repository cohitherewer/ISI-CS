The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 In a tactical move, Pawar prefers to wait till 2010

 - Englands Morgan to be next ICC chief 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: The toss wont be necessary

 as Sharad Pawar and David Morgan have reached an understanding over the top

 job in the International Cricket Council (ICC). 

There was no confirmation till late on Wednesday, but the arrangement will see the England amp; Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chairman unanimously elected as vice-president of the world body. 

And, when he starts a two-year term as president next June, the No. 2 position is going to be Pawars. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president will head the ICC for a two-year period from June 2010. 

Ray Mali is the acting president till June 2008. 

That Pawar may not mind waiting was first reported by The Telegraph last week. 

Its a tactical move Asias Big Four can now push for a chief executive from the region and Pawar is going to be at the helm when the World Cup returns to the subcontinent, in 2011, is how one of the sources put it, when contacted in London. 

Another added: As of now, its a win-win situation for Asia and Pawar 

The regions Big Four India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh just arent in favour of an extension for the current chief executive, Malcolm Speed. 

The Australians contract gets over next year. 

Apparently, Pawar and Morgan reached an understanding during their meeting late on Tuesday, after the MCC-hosted dinner at Lords. 

For, on the morning-after, a Pawar confidant sent a two-word SMS to this newspaper sorted out. 

That strongly suggested Morgan had agreed to back an Asian as Speeds successor. 

Morgan, incidentally, will be the ICC president when the Twenty20 World Championships second edition is held in England, in 2009. 

The ICCs governance review committee, it may be recalled, recently left it to Pawar and Morgan to settle the issue as a stalemate had been reached. 

Specifically, neither had the support of seven of the 10 Full (Test-playing) Members. Pawar, however, did have the backing of six.

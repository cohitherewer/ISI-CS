 Tiger Woods Player of the Year again

Miami: World No.1 Tiger Woods was named PGA Player of the Year on Tuesday for the ninth time in 11 seasons. 

Woods dominated the PGA Tour, winning seven titles in 16 starts, including his 13th major victory in the US PGA Championship at Southern Hills. 

The 31-year-old American ended his campaign two weeks ago with a memorable double, clinching the Tour Championship by eight shots and inaugural FedExCup honours to earn a $10 million bonus. 

It was his 61st PGA Tour title and fourth in five starts. 

Woods, who led the money list with $10,867,052 at the end of the regular season, first won the Player of the Year award in 1997. 

He followed it up in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2006. Fellow American Mark Meara earned the accolade in 1998 and Fijian Vijai Singh in 2004. 

But though Woods is firm on his mission to become the best golfer possible, he has made it clear that he wont sacrifice his family. 

When this weeks Presidents Cup team competition at Royal Montreal Golf Club ends on Sunday, Woods will put away his clubs and forget about golf for the next two and a half months. 

Fatherhood is still something of a novelty for the 31-year-old American, whose Swedish wife Elin gave birth to their first child, Sam Alexis, in mid-June. 

Life on the road for any professional sports figure can be lonely and Woods has decided to take the longest break of his career to spend time with wife and daughter. 

Its not seeing her (Sam) every day and helping Elin, the 13-time major champion said of his biggest regret while playing on the US PGA Tour over the last three months. 

We dont have nannies and we dont have any other help. When Im at home, I can help but when Im not there, Elins being a complete stud about it and doing it all on her own. 

You feel guilty for not being there, for not helping out. But we want to do it ourselves. We dont want anyone helping raise our child because its our child.

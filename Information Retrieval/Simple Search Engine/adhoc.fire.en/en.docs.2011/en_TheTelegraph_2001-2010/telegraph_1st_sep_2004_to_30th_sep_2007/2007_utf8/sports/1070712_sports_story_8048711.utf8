 Bangla slip on damp day

Kandy: Muttiah Muralidharan snared two wickets in a brief evening session, pushing Bangladesh to 72 for four before a wet opening day of the third and final Test ended prematurely in bad light. 

Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene asked Bangladesh to bat on a gloomy morning. Conditions deteriorated, with only 29 overs being bowled in three phases. 

Play got underway on schedule despite a light shower in the morning, but three breaks for rain caused problems for the Bangladesh batsmen, who were desperately trying to put up a fight to avoid a 0-3 whitewash in the Test series. 

Paceman Lasith Malinga claimed the first wicket, trapping Javed Omar leg before for eight. The ball straightened after pitching and caught him directly in front. 

Former captain Habibul Bashar, back from the initial rain interruption, got an edge to a Fervez Mahroof delivery that jagged back and was caught for 18. That ended a 40-run second-wicket stand with Shahriar Nafees. 

Muralidharan struck twice after the tea interval, having Rajin Saleh caught at slip without scoring and Nafees (29) out driving to Sujeeva de Silva at mid-off. 

The prolific off-spinner had figures of two for 10 in nine overs before umpires called stumps because of bad light. 

Sri Lanka are looking for their third clean sweep in Tests. Their previous such triumphs were against the West Indies in 2001 and Zimbabwe in 2001-2002.

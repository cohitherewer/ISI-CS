 Speed regrets fundamental error

- Farcical ending to Australia-Sri Lanka final 

Bridgetown: International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive Malcolm Speed has apologised for the farcical end to Saturdays World Cup final, but ruled out blacklisting the erring officials. 

It was an unnecessary error, a fundamental error. It was made under difficult circumstances at the end of the match. 

It was unfortunate, a very sad way to finish the World Cup. I hope we can recall the great days cricket we had before this very unfortunate ending, Speed told newsmen at the Kensington Oval on Sunday. 

Flanked by ICC general manager Dave Richardson, Speed said: Dave and I are here on behalf of the ICC to say to the wider stakeholders of the game that we, too, are very sorry this incident occurred at the end of what, by any account, had been an outstanding day of cricket. 

In the rain-marred final, on-field umpires Steve Bucknor, standing in a record fifth Cup final, and Aleem Dar overlooked the fact that once 20 overs had been bowled in both innings, a result should have been declared under the Duckworth/Lewis method. 

Instead, they made the teams return to the field to play another three overs in semi-darkness at the end of which Australia won by 53 runs. 

Despite the embarrassing goof-up, Speed ruled out an immediate censure for the playing-control unit, which also included TV umpire Rudi Koertzen, fourth umpire Billy Bowden and Match Referee Jeff Crowe. 

They certainly do have a future in the game. We are not going to over-react to this. The umpires and Crowe had earned the right to officiate in the Cup final because they have been outstanding. 

I saw Crowe this morning, he came up to me and said I am very sorry (about Saturday), we are all very sorry, it shouldnt have happened, Speed said. 

Richardson also had no explanation for the gaffe. 

Weve tried to come up with an explanation and we cant. Weve spoken to them (the officials) and they are at a loss to explain, he said. 

Crowe has revealed that Koertzen had initiated the confusion which led to the entire fiasco. 

Though Speed said there wont be any over-reaction to the issue, Richardson said, Malcolm has said we are not going to over-react but we are certainly going to take it very seriously and look at how it could have happened. 

Speed refused to compare it to last years Oval Test embarrassment where Pakistan forfeited the Test against England after refusing to take the field protesting a five-run penalty for ball-tampering. ICC had subsequently barred Australian umpire Darrell Hair from officiating. 

After The Oval issue, there was a very comprehensive review of all the match officials who had been involved in that incident. We will go through a similar process here, Speed said. 

Speed conceded that the 2007 World Cup would be chiefly remembered for the death of Bob Woolmer, besides the chaotic finish of the final. 

Its too early to predict how history will view the tournament but certainly Bob Woolmers tragic death and the finish of the final are two things that will be uppermost in the minds of people who followed the event, Speed said. 

It was disappointing there were not a great number of matches that stayed in memory. 

Speed did, however, find a silver lining in the fact that the World Cup had left an enduring legacy of new grounds across the Caribbean. 

The West Indies now have this collection of five-star cricket grounds. When Australia come here next year, theyre going to have an almighty argument about where the Tests and ODIs will be played, Speed said. 

Speed also welcomed the idea of hosting other sport in the venues to make the stadia financially viable. 

The MCG has far more days of Australian Rules Football than it does cricket. Cricket grounds in other parts of the world are multi-purpose with other sports and functions staged being there. 

Whether its baseball or soccer, thats fine as long as it is available to cricket when cricket needs it. 

Speed also hoped that the Cup would have wiped out the debt of the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB). 

I dont know how great that surplus is, but Ken Gordon believes that it will wipe out the debt. Thats one of the legacies I am very happy about.

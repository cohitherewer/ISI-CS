 Vengsarkar: Sourav should open

New Delhi: Chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar felt Sourav Ganguly should open the innings in the World Cup and that there was no question of Sachin Tendulkar being dropped. 

I only have to say that Sourav has played very well opening the innings in Nagpur. I hope he will do even better in the World Cup and he should open, Vengsarkar said. 

Sourav can always score runs and grind the bowling at the same time. He can play a good attacking game, the former Indian captain said. 

Vengsarkar said Sachin was perhaps struggling to match his own expectations. He is one of the best in the world, he said in an interview to a radio broadcaster. 

Sachin has always played for the team and he has performed really well and I hope that he will do well in the World Cup also. There is no question of him being dropped, Vengsarkar said, according to a press release from the broadcasters. (PTI)

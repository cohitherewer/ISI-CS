 Henman up

London: Briton Tim Henman finally rediscovered some form with a 6-1, 7-6 victory over American Michael Russell in the first round of the Nottingham Open on Tuesday, his first Tour win since February. 

The 32-year-old took advantage of some ragged play by his 69th ranked opponent to take the first set with ease on the grasscourts.

 Third gold for Gay

Osaka: Tyson Gay won his third gold medal at the IAAF World Championships on Saturday. Only Carl Lewis and Maurice Greene have achieved such a triple before. 

Perhaps Allyson Felix can join that group if she is on the US 1,600 relay team on Sunday. She got her second gold when the American women won their sprint relay late on Saturday. 

After winning the 100m and 200m, Gay showed no fatigue despite nine races in eight days and set up anchor Leroy Dixon for the win, running a devastating final bend. 

After exchanging with Dixon, Gay screamed go amid the din of the capacity 50,000 crowd of the Nagai Stadium, urging Dixon on. And go he did, doing enough to hold off world record holder Asafa Powell, who ran a blistering anchor to bring Jamaica from nowhere to a silver medal. 

Gay had seen enough, though. He was already pumping the air before Dixon crossed in 37.78, holding an edge of 0.11 over Jamaica. Britain was third. (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Nadal praise for Rastogi

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chennai: Rafael Nadal may only be 20, but he has seen and played enough tennis to make a realistic assessment of a greenhorn. It came as no surprise when he neither went overboard nor was too subdued in summing up Karan Rastogis performance against him at the Chennai Open on Thursday. 

He played a nice match... there was zero-pressure on him, that sometimes makes it easy in such situations, Nadal said at the post-match conference. If he continues to play like this, he has a very good future. 

Asked to pick the Indians strong points, Nadal said: He has a good backhand and is fast on court, that is very important. But this is his first match at this level... he has to play the Futures, Challengers and come through to a higher level. 

Rastogi was as pleased as Punch with his performance. Id say I did a little better than I expected. I wanted to enjoy out there, and I had the time of my life. 

What are the lessons he learnt from the match against such a high-calibre opponent? A mental block has gone... I proved to myself I can play at this level. But I need to get stronger, need to work in the gym to build my physique, Rastogi said. 

It will be back to the Futures for Rastogi, who won one such title last week in Delhi. Ill take a lot of confidence from this match into my future tournaments... I would like to play some Challengers also, he said. 

Asked whether he had the finances to travel through the year, Rastogi said: I need about Rs 50-60 lakh to do that. Right now I get assistance from the IMG, some AITA and government grants which add up to maximum 10 lakh... 

Is anyone listening?

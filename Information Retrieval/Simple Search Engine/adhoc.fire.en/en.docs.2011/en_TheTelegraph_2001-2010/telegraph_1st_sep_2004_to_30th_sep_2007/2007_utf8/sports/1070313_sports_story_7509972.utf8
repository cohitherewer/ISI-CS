The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 One wanting to be different could be the one to make the difference

 A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE - 1996 World Cup-winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga on the lsquo;Super Eight rsquo;

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Arjuna Ranatunga, among the more high profile of politicians in Sri Lanka, is one of only seven captains to have lifted the World Cup. Despite heavy demands from different quarters, the talismanic Arjuna took time off for The Telegraph to comment on the World Cups Super Eight captains. 

Here goes (alphabetically): 

On Rahul Dravid: He has done well in the past year or so He wants to lead from the front and I quite like the manner in which he fought for (Virender) Sehwag when the World Cup squad was being picked I admire assertive captains, which is why I give high marks to Dravid Tactically, I was quite impressed with his bowling changes and field placements during the recent series against Sri Lanka The results apart, he has done well to keep the team united Despite the presence of former captains, I havent heard of differences in the Indian dressing room. Credit must go to Dravid. 

On Stephen Fleming: Its with good reason that most regard Fleming as the No.1 captain He has been in the seat for a decade, which is remarkable to say the least Its a recognition of his leadership as there are players in New Zealand who could wear the captains hat Fleming doesnt have stars Hasnt been blessed with a great team But, then, he has players who are totally committed Tactically, hes sharp. 

On Inzamam-ul Haq: At times, I feel sorry for Inzy He has to contend with so many controversies Im sure there are occasions when he feels frustrated Despairs The lesser the number of issues in a captains head, the better hes going to lead. Obviously, this will be Inzys last World Cup and he may prove to be truly inspirational He should bat up the order, though. 

On Mahela Jayawardene: He has it in him to improve as captain I know he wants to Im not saying he captains by committee, but hes always probably conscious of the fact that he has former captains and other seniors playing under him Also, my impression is that he often gets too emotional... A captain must show emotions, but at the right moment and in the right degree Theres a lot of pressure on Mahela, but he has the services of Sanath (Jayasuriya), (Kumar Sangakkara) Sanga, (Muttiah Muralidharan) Murali and Chaminda (Vaas) Somebody like Sanath, who has seen it all, can take much of the pressure off the captain I had a brief interaction with Mahela before he left for the West Indies and hes welcome to bounce ideas off me if he wants to, that is. Im just a phone call away. 

On Brian Lara: As captain, he has been pretty positive in the past six months A captain has to trust instincts and be flexible Brian isnt rigid He has some inexperienced players, but thats the challenge Im sure hes aware that no single-host nation has ever won the World Cup (Sri Lanka were co-hosts in 1996), but is experienced enough not to allow that to weigh him down. Like Inzy, Brian should bat up the order. 

On Ricky Ponting: Likes to lead from the front and, in the past two years, has matured as captain He has the luxury of having won the World Cup (2003) and, so, thats one big advantage he enjoys over the other captains The Australians have had problems in recent weeks, but Pontings smart in his job. 

On Graeme Smith: Hes the only captain I havent seen much of He has a good pace attack and his team bats deep Thats South Africas USP In recent times, Smith hasnt exactly been consistent, but hes a quality batsman capable of severely denting the oppositions confidence. He comes through as positive... Its a trait which, in my book, counts. 

On Michael Vaughan: Hes also the positive sort Is the type to make things happen instead of being dictated to by the trend of play Its a plus for England that hes back on the field The team could do with somebody not wary of taking bold decisions. 

Finally, his advice to the Super Eight: (Laughs) Organise yourself first before getting the team organised Be positive and dont be afraid to experiment. The one wanting to be different could be the one to make the difference.

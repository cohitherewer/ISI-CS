 Illyas protest

Karachi: Imran Farhats father-in-law Mohammed Illyas will go on a hunger strike from Monday to protest the ban on his entry to the Gaddafi. 

Ilyas, who threatened Pakistans selectors for omitting Farhat for the Abu Dhabi series against Sri Lanka, was banned from the stadium by the PCB. 

Farhat was fined and put under observation for six months following the incident.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Back home, Munaf is unfit!

A STAFF REPORTER AND AGENCIES 

Calcutta/Mumbai: Paceman Munaf Patel on Monday was ruled out of the first two one-day Internationals against the West Indies after being advised two weeks rest for a sore ankle. 

Munaf hurt his ankle during the second ODI, but had been declared fit by team physio John Gloster to play in the deciding third and final Test in Cape Town. 

On Monday, the quick was examined and later declared not completely fit by BCCI medical consultant Dr Anant Joshi. Patel has been advised two weeks rest by Dr Joshi when he examined him today (Monday) after the bowler complained of pain in the ankle, Board secretary Niranjan Shah said. 

It, thus, confirmed that Munaf was far from fit in Cape Town and questions had been raised, among others, by The Telegraph on whether he had actually been fit. 

Questions have also to be raised about the clean chit given by Gloster. Obviously, somebody had an interest in covering up the quicks fitness. Munaf, it may be recalled, bowled just a solitary over in the second innings of the Cape Town Test. 

The bowler will hence not be available to play at least in the first two ODIs against the West Indies in Nagpur (January 21) and Cuttack (January 24).

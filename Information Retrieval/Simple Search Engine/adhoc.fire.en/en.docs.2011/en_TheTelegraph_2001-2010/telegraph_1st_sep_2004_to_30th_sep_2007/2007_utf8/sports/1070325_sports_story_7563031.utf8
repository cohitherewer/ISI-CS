The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We were pathetic, says Kapil 

A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES

 Calcutta/New Delhi: The country erupted in anger following Indias second defeat in three games, which has all but sealed their chance of progressing to the Super Eight stage of the World Cup. Reactions of former cricketers were no different. 

Following are excerpts from what ex-India Test players had to say (alphabetically): 

ARSHAD AYUB: Our batsmen went for big shots and threw their wickets. It was a gettable target as the wicket was playing well. Sourav (Ganguly) should have stayed and, with Sehwag, should have laid a good foundation. 

CHANDU BORDE: The decision to put Sri Lanka in was a correct one as we had a good chance but the luck was missing. Luck was not with our bowlers as they didnt pick wickets despite beating the batsmen. But we conceded too many extras. Some of the batsmen let the team down with their stroke-selection. The team was good, it was just unfortunate that nothing went right for us. I thought Kumble would have been a better choice than Harbhajan as the Lankans play well against off-spinners, but thats an after-thought. Against Bangladesh, we probably thought it would be easy for us and the body language in such cases becomes sluggish. But we shouldnt have underestimated Bangladesh as they have beaten top teams earlier. They fielded extremely well against India. 

V.B. CHANDRASEKHAR: It was bad planning and there was no game plan as such. The composition of the playing XI itself was wrong. Anil Kumble should have been played and Irfan Pathan could have come in for Robin Uthappa. Sending Sachin in the middle order was wrong, too. Sachin should have been asked to open as it is difficult for anyone to adjust so soon in the shorter version of the game. 

DEEP DASGUPTA: Its a very sad for Indian cricket. We had a pretty decent start but everything went haywire after that. I wonder why Ajit (Agarkar) didnt finish his full quota despite having troubled the Sri Lankans in the early overs. I would also say that our batsmen could have done much better. I dont know what happened to class performers like Sourav, Sachin, Dravid. The decision to field first was a good one as we have chased well in the recent past. But nothing clicked for us on Friday. We were 50 per cent out when we lost to Bangladesh 

KAPIL DEV: It is a shame that we have to rely on Bermuda to stay in the tournament. I hope that doesnt happen because Bangladesh deserve to advance to the second round since they have beaten India. All credit to Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. India were pathetic and just not good enough to stay in the tournament. 

ASHOK MALHOTRA: The writing was on the wall the day the squad was announced. It had too many out-of-form, unfit and old players and this was bound to happen. What Im trying to say is that the selectors intentions were not clear. I would like to ask the team management why Kumble was not in the playing XI. Harbhajan has done nothing extraordinary in the last year to merit a berth in the XI. And talking about Indias batting, they didnt have that belief and confidence in them. Now the question arises whether Indias top order is really world-class. 

SRINIVAS VENKATRAGHAVAN: No one seems to care about such losses. It is disappointing, pathetic and frustrating. The players lacked everything, including fighting quality. I dont mind if they lose a match, but surely not in this manner. Its as good as an innings defeat in terms of Test cricket. I have played enough cricket and officiated in international matches. If we have to lose by five runs or so, it is understandable. Giving so much of leeway to the rival team conceding 16 wides -- is not seen at this level, especially from a team like India which has enough international exposure. It is disgusting and frustrating from the point of view of Indian cricket. They have to sit, review and analyse such performances. The concerned should be held responsible. 

GUNDAPPA VISWANATH: It was an absolutely pathetic performance, especially after winning a good toss. Our bowlers did a wonderful job, so did the fielders. The bowlers restricted Sri Lanka, though in the last couple of overs they were able to get 20 or 30 more we expected. But 250 was a gettable target, with our kind of batting line-up. Losing two matches out of three reflects their lack of application and determination. Its a shame that they failed to qualify for the Super Eight, especially after so much build-up and experimentation before the World Cup.

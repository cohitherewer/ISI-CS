 Sourav: It does get intense

Former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly spoke after stumps on Sunday. The following are excerpts: 

I think I batted well and we needed a partnership in the morning We also had to get through the second new ball in the first session We knew that runs on the board will help us win the Test We didnt set a target Its good that Ive contributed 

The ball does a bit in the mornings and (Ryan) Sidebottom bowled particularly well to Sachin (Tendulkar) There are spells in Test cricket when bowlers bowl well and youve got to get through those periods 

Yes, it does get intense in Test cricket It happens when both teams are competing to win It has happened in the past and Im sure its going to happen in the future as well I havent seen anything to spoil the series 

Of course, things happen (like between Zaheer Khan and Kevin Pietersen) We have to put it behind us and move ahead 

England did well under Nasser Hussain and theyre doing well under Michael Vaughan Two different eras Its not right to compare 

Sachin has been producing such knocks every time I hope hell produce them in the future as well

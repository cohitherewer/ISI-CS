Port Elizabeth: Makhaya Ntini took four wickets on Friday as Pakistan reached 135 for six in reply to South Africas 124 at stumps on Day I of the second of three Tests. 

Ntini took two wickets before tea and then dismissed Yasir Hameed straight after the break to leave Pakistan on 19 for three. The South African quick ended up with figures of four for 18 off 10 overs. 

Earlier, Shoaib Akhtar took four for 36 and Danish Kaneria three for 36. Mark Boucher top-scored with 35, while South Africa captain Graeme Smith had 28 and Jacques Kallis 24. 

Smith won the toss and elected to bat at St Georges Park, but the hosts were in trouble when AB de Villiers attempted to pull a short-pitched delivery from Shoaib and edged to wicketkeeper Akmal for 2. 

Hashim Amla also played a bad shot, attempting to glance a short-pitched delivery down the leg side when on 5. He succeeded only in getting a glove to it for Akmal to take another catch. 

Smith started to attack Kaneria when he was brought on to bowl, but, after hitting him down the ground for four, he misread a googly and edged the ball. Akmal palmed it up and Younis took an easy catch to dismiss Smith for 28. 

Prince got a second chance when Akmal missed a simple chance from an edge off the bowling of Mohammed Sami, but two balls later edged again, this time straight to Mohammed Hafeez at first slip to depart for 2. Gibbs then missed a sweep against Kanerias spin to be adjudged lbw. 

South Africa went to lunch at 64 for five, but 19 runs later Kallis edged a ball from Akhtar to Akmal. Boucher fell edging Kaneria to Younis at slip, while Pollock on 4 chipped a simple catch to Sami at square-leg off Shoaib. 

Pakistans reply was soon in trouble when Imran Farhad prodded at Ntinis second delivery and edged him to De Villiers at slip to be dismissed for a duck. Hafeez was then out on 13, hooking a ball from Ntini for Amla to take a running catch at short leg. 

Hameed was out for 2 and then Younis Khan and Mohammed Yousuf put on a 60-run stand before Yousuf fell leg-before to Shaun Pollock for 32. 

Kamran Akmal came in ahead of Inzamam-ul Haq because the Pakistan captain had spent too long off the field. Younis (45) was caught in the gully by Herschelle Gibbs for 45 off Ntini to end a stand of 56. 

Akmal played a rash hook shot at a bouncer by Andre Nel in the last over of the day and was caught by Ashwell Prince on 33. Sami was not out without scoring when play ended. 

Shoaib and Mohammed Asif tested positive to the banned steroid nandrolene last year. Shoaib was banned for two years and Asif one, but the PCB overturned the suspensions. The World Anti-Doping Agency has appealed to Court of Arbitration for Sports, which is expected to rule within three months. 

South Africa won the first Test at Centurion Park by seven wickets earlier this week.

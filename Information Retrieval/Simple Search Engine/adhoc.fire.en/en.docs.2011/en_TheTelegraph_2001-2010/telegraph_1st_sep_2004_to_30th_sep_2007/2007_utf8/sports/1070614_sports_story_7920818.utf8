 Ponting takes on Sunny, again

 Ricky Ponting 

Bangalore: Ricky Ponting has taken on Sunil Gavaskar again. In the lead-up to the World Cup this year, Ponting had made a mockery of Indias away record. 

Provoked by Gavaskars comment in a magazine that Australia were an unpopular team because of their on-field behaviour, Ponting had said, we all know the way he played his cricket, dont we? If he is talking about us, what about the way India have played their cricket over the last few years? I dont know if there are too many popular winners. 

Gavaskar struck back with a vengeance, saying a hothead guy might actually whack the Australian cricketers if they dared replicate their on-field behaviour in a bar. He cited the example of David Hookes who had been fatally beaten up outside a bar. 

Ponting then ripped into Gavaskar at a news conference asking Mr Perfect Gavaskar to lay off being high and mighty, and took potshots at Indias away Test record. 

The latest salvo came on Wednesday, on the coachs issue. On Gavaskars opposition to having an Australian as a coach for India, Ponting said: It is up to those guys. But if you look around us, you can see a lot of Australian coaches doing a pretty good job with teams around the world. 

Sunil Gavaskar opposed Dav Whatmore and didnt take well to Greg Chappells appointment as coach. 

Incidentally, Chappell is the only Australian to have coached India. It is important that they get a coach on board, Ponting reminded. 

Ponting said he saw no reason why an Australian coach could not do a good job in India when quite a few of them were doing well with teams around the world. 

I think Tom Moody has done a terrific job in Sri Lanka leading them to the World Cup final and I cant see why an Australian coach could not fit and do a good job here, Ponting, who was here to participate in a training programme for children said. 

Referring to the current Indian team, Ponting said it was important that all senior players make sure that they stick together, leading the way and providing direction to the younger lot. 

That is what has been the Australians strength, he said. 

To a question on the role of the coach in a team, he said, cricket is run by the captain while the coach takes care of the technical side. But with the game getting hectic, the coach is important in mapping out programmes well, organising training sessions and ensuring a happy environment. 

We were lucky to play under some good coaches, he said. He singled out John Buchanan for special mention. They made the job of the players much easier, he added. 

Reacting to changing rules of the game, Ponting said, whenever rule changes are made, it would be nice if the players are consulted.

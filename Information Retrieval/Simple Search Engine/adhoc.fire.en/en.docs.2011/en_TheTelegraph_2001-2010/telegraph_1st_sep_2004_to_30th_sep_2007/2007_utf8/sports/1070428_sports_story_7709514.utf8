 No Indian in Vivs dream team

 - Ricky Ponting gets captaincy; Mahela Jayawardene makes it to the icons side too 

 Sir Vivian Richards

Bridgetown: Thanks to their nightmarish campaign, no Indian proved good enough to feature in Sir Vivian Richards dream team from this World Cup. 

The Ricky Ponting-led elite XI excludes two of the best batsmen of modern era and Richards admitted that both Sachin Tendulkar and the recently-retired Brian Lara could have found a place in any team, but for their sides disappointing performance in the World Cup. 

Richards, however, has a gut feeling that an upset is due in Bridgetown on Saturday. 

Australia have been formidable, winning all their matches, but I feel an upset is due in this tournament, said Richards after announcing his dream team from the ongoing World Cup on Thursday. 

The former West Indies captain sprang a surprise by bringing in Kumar Sangakkara to partner Matthew Hayden in the opening slot. 

Adam Gilchrist didnt pass muster because anyone who saw Sangakkara stump Brian Lara down the legside wouldnt forget it in a hurry, Richards said. 

The next three of Ponting, Kevin Pieterson and Mahela Jayawardene are automatic choices. Gibbs inclusion raised an eyebrow but not before Richards killed the doubt with a straight bat. 

Gibbs, who hit six sixes in an over, couldnt have been ignored, said Richards. 

Richards alloted a place for Scott Styris who batted with purpose in practically every match for New Zealand and then chose his four bowlers which to him, was a straightforward choice. 

Shaun Tait has taken wickets every time he was asked to do so by his captain and Shane Bond was equally effective for New Zealand. 

I have chosen them before Lasith Malinga because the latter has age on his side. 

Glenn McGrath was an obvious choice as was Muttiah Muralidharan, the only one in Richards opinion the world conquering West Indies team of 1975 and 79 would have loved to include in their squad. 

Guys like Murali and Shane Warne are special because they rekindled interest in a skill when fast bowlers were dominating throughout the world. They didnt bowl fast but chose their craft to get past batsmen. 

Ponting has been most successful and aggressive in his methods as a batsman and captain. He was thus an obvious choice, he said. 

The batting legend said Ramnaresh Sarwan should succeed Lara as West Indies captain. 

Selectors must make a choice on a man who can draw youngsters around him and Sarwan has that ability. As a captain you are not looking at somebody who is on cloud nine all the time, said Richards. 

Besides, it is only fair if somebody has been groomed in that role and Sarwan clearly has been one, remarked the former West Indies captain. 

He called for a swift return of the World Cup to the Caribbean because it was mucked up this time. 

Organisers, he said, had got it hopelessly wrong the first time and they owed it to the people to return as soon as possible and put their mistakes right. I would love it (back in the Caribbean). They owe us. They should say, hey, we mucked up here, lets start this thing over again and get all these indigenous people along, the 55-year-old said. (AGENCIES)

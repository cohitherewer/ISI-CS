 They prepared better: Sir Alex 

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

For the third time Sir Alex Ferguson saw Manchester United fail to reach a European Cup final at the final hurdle. But unlike previous semi-final defeats to Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen, the United manager could not pretend his team had seen a final stolen from them, and admitted: We cut our own throats. 

After as one-sided a European defeat as he has known, Ferguson did not shelter behind excuses and kept his dignity throughout. 

I am disappointed since we have done so well to get here, he said. But I would have to say that we never came out of the box. AC Milan were better prepared physically than us and we did not cope with the start. At that level, you have to see it through, keeping possession and calm the crowd, but we lost two goals very cheaply. 

After the narrow 3-2 victory at Old Trafford, Ferguson had demanded better defending in the San Siro, a request wilfully ignored by his players. If we had coped better with keeping simple possession, it might not have hurt us, said Ferguson. 

Seeing off the first 25 minutes without cutting our own throats would have helped but we have to cope better. The atmosphere was fantastic; they started so quickly and sharply, it put us on the back foot immediately. 

Milan put up a fantastic performance and they looked much fresher than us. They kept the ball better but we should have dealt with their thrusts better. It is the name of the game in Europe: you dont give the ball away and Milan kept the ball far better than us.

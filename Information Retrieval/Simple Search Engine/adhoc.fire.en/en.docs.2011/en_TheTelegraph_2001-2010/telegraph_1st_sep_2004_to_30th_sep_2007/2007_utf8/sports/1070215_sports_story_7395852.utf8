 Bengal eves in semis

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Guwahati: Orissa topped group A and Bengal group B as the semi-finalists of the National Games womens football competition were identified on Wednesday. 

Orissa-Manipur and Bengal-Goa all finished with seven points, and the group toppers were identified by goal difference. Bengal will meet Manipur and Orissa face Goa in the last four. 

In the last league match played at the SAI ground, Bengal and Goa played out a goalless draw. 

The skies opened up midway through the first half and it continued to rain rest of the game. 

Unhappy with the ground condition, Bengal manager Dilip Das said they would request the match commissioner to reschedule their semi-final for Friday.

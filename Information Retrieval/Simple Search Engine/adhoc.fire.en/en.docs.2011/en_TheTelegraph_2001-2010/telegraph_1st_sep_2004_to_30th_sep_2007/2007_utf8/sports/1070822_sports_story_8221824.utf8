The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IN THE CITY

 East Bengal have climbed down from their tough stand after IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly apologised for not informing the club about setting up a panel of observers to oversee the performance of the big match officials. They wrote to the IFA saying they should have been informed of the panel we set up on the eve of the derby and were contemplating not continuing in the Premier Division. I wrote back saying we should have informed them and also that they should not take any step detrimental to football, said IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly.

 We are playing Wednesdays match as the IFAs reply has satisfied us, said an East Bengal official. Well meet the IFA secretary on Friday to resolve some other issues.

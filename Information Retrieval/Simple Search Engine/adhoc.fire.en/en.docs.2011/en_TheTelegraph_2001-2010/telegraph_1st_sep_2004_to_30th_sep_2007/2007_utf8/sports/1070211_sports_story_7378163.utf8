The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Nothing worries me, says Rahul Dravid

 - This isnt the time to talk about it: Niranjan Shah 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Rajkot: Less than 24 hours after announcing that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) would be seeking an explanation from captain Rahul Dravid for his outburst against manager Chetan Desai, secretary Niranjan Shah backtracked and said he hadnt asked for one. 

Theres a match here tomorrow (versus Sri Lanka)... This isnt the time to talk about it... Ill have a word with Rahul before or after Mondays selection committee meeting in Mumbai, Shah told The Telegraph on Saturday. 

The BCCI, it appears, has realised that it didnt help matters by putting Dravid in the dock. That, too, in the middle of a series and with the World Cup just weeks away. 

Dravid, who tore into Desai whod been around in South Africa during the three-Test series, maintained he would give an explanation if asked to. 

Asked by the Media to comment on the timing of the BCCIs reaction and the controversy itself (triggered by a report on a TV channel), Dravid responded candidly: Its part and parcel of being a cricketer in India... In the last three-four years, there has never been a time when there have been no controversies... 

Were cricketers and learn how to adjust and deal with them... We have to focus on the cricket and try and get good performances... Theres a lot of interest in cricket, a lot of speculation and a lot of talk... I see thats the way its going to be and we cant change that can we? Nothing worries me and Ill give an explanation if asked to... 

For the record, its not that Shah and Dravid didnt interact at the Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Ground during Team Indias match-eve workout.

Puerto la Cruz: Perus Claudio Pizarro scored a late equaliser to salvage a 2-2 draw against Bolivia on Tuesday, a result that carried his side into the quarter finals of the Copa America along with Venezuela and Uruguay. 

Hosts Venezuela had already qualified the previous night thanks to a favourable combination of results in group C, but the point gained from their dire 0-0 draw with Uruguay ensured that they finished top of group A. 

Pizarro scored twice in the first match of the double header in Merida, including an 85th minute strike, as Peru denied their opponents a first Copa America victory since 1997. 

Bolivia, who would have advanced at Perus expense had they won, have now completed four tournaments without winning a match. 

Uruguay, who qualified despite scoring only one goal in three games, barely ventured out of their own half as they got the point they needed in the second match. 

The top two teams in the three first-round groups qualify for the last eight along with the two best third-placed sides, a format, which turns the final group stage matches into a complex mathematical exercise. 

Venezuela topped group A on five points to take them beyond the opening round for the first time since entering the tournament in 1967. Peru and Uruguay finished on four points apiece with Bolivia on two. Peru took second spot on goal difference to set up a quarter final clash against the group C winners, either Paraguay or Argentina, on Sunday. 

Paraguay and Argentina have already qualified following victories in their opening two matches along with Mexico from group B. 

Meanwhile, Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez has defended his teams cautious style, arguing that it pays to focus on not conceding goals. 

Uruguay and United States have been the notable exceptions in a meet where all the other sides have tried to attack and which has produced an impressive average of 3.35 goals a game. (REUTERS)

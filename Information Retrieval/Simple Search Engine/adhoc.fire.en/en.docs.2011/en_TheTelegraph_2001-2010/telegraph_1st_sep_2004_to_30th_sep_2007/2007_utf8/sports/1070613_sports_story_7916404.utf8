 Dream come true: Rohit

Bangalore: Mumbai youngster Rohit Sharma was thrilled with his selection in the one-day squad for the upcoming series in Ireland and Scotland. 

I am very very happy. Its a dream come true, said the 20-year-old. 

There was something in the air, rumours that I would be selected. I am very glad they came true, he said. 

Sharma said the experience of India A tours had helped him a lot. The India A tours helped me a lot... Everyone saw me on television on the tour to Abu Dhabi (with India A) last year, said Sharma.

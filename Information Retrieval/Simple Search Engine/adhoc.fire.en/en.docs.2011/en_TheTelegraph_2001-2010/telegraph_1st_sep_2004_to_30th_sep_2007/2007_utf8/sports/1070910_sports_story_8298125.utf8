The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Atherton feels Indias best days are behind them

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former England captain Michael Atherton has labelled India as a poor one-day outfit and feels there is no reason for Collingwood and Co. to go overboard with the series win. In his column for the Sunday Telegraph, the former opener says England must guard against believing in what he calls a false dawn for English cricket. 

Despite some unmistakably promising signs, there have been so many false dawns before, it would pay not to get too carried away. The brutal truth is that India, far from being a powerhouse in one-day cricket, are a poor one-day outfit themselves as the last World Cup proved. 

Atherton also took a dig at Indias lack of athleticism and indicated that age is catching up with most of the key players. They (India) havent changed key personnel since then (World Cup), apart from coach Greg Chappell, and given their age profile they are a team whose best days are behind them. 

In fact, the former captain goes on to say that England should have beaten the weaklings comprehensively. 

They are completely lacking in athleticism and agility, weak in pace bowling and so badly balanced that England should have beaten them comprehensively. 

With three matches to go, India were on their knees. That they were somehow able to take this series to the wire says much about how far England still have to travel. 

Atherton points out spin to be Englands Achilles heel. A couple of areas need attention. Spin has proved to be Englands Achilles heel in this series, both the batsmens inability to dominate Ramesh Powar and Piyush Chawla, and Monty Panesars failure to translate the form and palpable confidence he has in Test cricket. 

In Andrew Flintoffs absence, Panesar has yet to realise that he is Englands main attacking weapon in the middle overs. Gone has been the loop, bite and spin that we associate with him in Tests, replaced by a certain lack of guile that can only be put down to an absence of experience or confidence. 

But he feels the return of Flintoff transforms England into a more potent unit. Without Flintoff, though, Englands balance is askew as none of the other allrounders Bopara, Dimitri Mascarenhas or Collingwood are good enough to be the third seamer in all but dust-bowl conditions. 

Flintoff underlined his importance to the team again in his first spell on Saturday, sending back Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar. 

And for good measure, the former England opener adds the constant replays on the big screen do nothing to increase the confidence of the on-field umpires. 

The legitimacy of each decision was questioned by the Indian segment of the crowd, but surely the only question should be why such contentious decisions are continually displayed on the big screen. 

It cannot do much for an umpires confidence to hear the crowd booing time and again. It was, nevertheless, a delight to see Flintoff back and enjoying his cricket.

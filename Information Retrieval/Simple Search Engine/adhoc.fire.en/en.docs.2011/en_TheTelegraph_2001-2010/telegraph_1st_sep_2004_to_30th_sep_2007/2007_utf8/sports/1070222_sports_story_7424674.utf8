The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The scenario is a grave one

Karachi: Dissatisfied with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB)s functioning, National Assembly and Senate standing committees on sports and culture will hold a joint session on Friday to question the PCB authorities on the teams chances in the World Cup. 

Incidentally, Dr Nasim Ashraf, the head of the PCB, holds the rank of minister of state. 

Outspoken senator Enver Baig said one could judge just how seriously parliamentary committees were taking the issue of cricket affairs by the fact that this was the first time a joint session was being held. 

Definitely, we see the cricket scenario as a grave one. We are not satisfied with either the teams performance, the way teams have been selected or the manner in which the Pakistan Cricket Board is being managed these days, he said. 

We want to know what chances do we really have of doing well in the coming World Cup after all it is a mega event and the entire nation is looking forward to it. Cricket has always been a matter of national interest for everyone, he said. 

Meanwhile, Pakistan team manager Talat Ali has not reported any incident of racial abuse by coach Bob Woolmer against any member of the team, including Shoaib Akhtar during the recent tour of South Africa. 

A PCB official confirmed that Talat, in his tour report to the PCB, said an altercation did take place between Woolmer and Shoaib during the second Test in Port Elizabeth but no racial abuse was involved in it. (PTI)

 Jeev tied ninth

Gleneagles: Jeev Milkha Singh squandered a chance to take the lead but remained inside the top 10 after returning a one-over 74 in the second round of the Johnnie Walker Championship here. 

The seasoned Indian was jostling for the lead at one stage but had to be content with the tied ninth position after stumbling to a bogey and a double bogey on the last three holes to total five-under 141. 

Meanwhile, compatriot Shiv Kapur also carded a 74 after a mid-round collapse to stay in contention for a good finish at Gleneagles with a total of four-under 142. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ludhiana to 

 host 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Federation Cup

 New 

 Delhi: Big time football will return to Punjab after 

 six years as the Federation Cup (September 4 to 15) has 

 been allotted to Ludhiana on Saturday.

 The last major football meet to 

 be held in Punjab was the 2001 National Games in Ludhiana. 

 The state also played host to Santosh Trophy twice in 1970 

 and 1974 in Jalandhar. Punjab won the titles on all three 

 occasions.

 Though Punjab has never hosted 

 the Federation Cup before, the Guru Nanak Stadium in Ludhiana 

 is the designated home ground for JCT, Phagwara and thus 

 familiar to all the big teams in the country.

 JCT coach and Punjab Football 

 Association (PFA) official Sukhwinder Singh claimed from 

 Phagwara that the Ludhiana pitch is in top condition at 

 the moment. We also have at least five good practice 

 grounds. So the teams will not face any problem.

 AIFF general secretary Alberto 

 Colaco said the prize money for the 16-team knockout tournament 

 would remain the same as last year. The draw will 

 be held during the Nehru Cup tournament in Delhi.

 While all 10 teams in the Professional 

 League automatically qualify for the Federation Cup, two 

 teams demoted from the NFL last year will also take part. 

 Teams which finished between third and sixth positions in 

 the Second Division NFL last season, are the other four 

 teams for the tournament. 

 Teams: Mohun Bagan, East 

 Bengal, Mohammedan Sporting and Chirag United (all Calcutta), 

 Dempo, Churchill Brothers, Sporting Clube de Goa, Salgaocar 

 and Vasco (all Goa), Mahindra United, Air India and ONGC 

 (all Mumbai), HASC and Army XI (both Bangalore), Viva Kerala 

 (Kerala), JCT (Punjab).

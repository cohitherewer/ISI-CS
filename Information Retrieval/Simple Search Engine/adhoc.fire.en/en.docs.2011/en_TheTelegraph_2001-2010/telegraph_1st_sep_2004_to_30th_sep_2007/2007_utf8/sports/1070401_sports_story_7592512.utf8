 Jeev, Chopra make cut 

Houston: Jeev Milkha Singh overcame the scare of three bogeys on his second nine to squeeze into the weekend rounds as he made the cut right on the line in the Shell Houston Open. 

The 35-year-old Chandigarh golfer added an even par 72 to his first round 73 to be at one-over 145 and tied 68th for 36 holes. 

Daniel Chopra shot an even par 72 after his first round 68 to be four-under and tied 10th after two rounds. Chopra is two shots off the crowded leaderboard, where six players share the lead at six-under 136. 

The six are Americans Bob Estes, Jason Gore, DJ Brigman, Jeff Maggert, Bubba Watson and Australias Stuart Appleby.

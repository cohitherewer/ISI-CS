 Samba dance in European tune

FREE-KICK

 P.K.Banerjee

 It was worth sitting in front of the television set dead at night to watch the Copa America final. I was expecting a good contest between favourites Argentina and Dungas Brazil which is in the process of rebuilding. What I got instead was a unique show from the Brazilians.

 It wasnt the usual samba flavour which earned them a 3-0 verdict. The comprehensive victory was the result of a ruthlessly efficient display which would have made any top European side proud.

 Aware that they were up against a skilfully superior side the Argentines were on paper even stronger than their World Cup outfit armed with an enviable midfield and lethal strikers, the Brazilians went into the match determined to ward off the Argentine attacking threat and catch their defence on the wrong foot with telling counter attacks. And how well the players implemented the coachs plans!

 Their defensive organisation was superb, with Doni showing the way from under the bar. The Argentines came hard at them, but could rarely penetrate the wall led by Juan. And the few balls Riquelme managed to send goalwards, by way of free-kicks or centres, were dealt with ably by Doni.

 If they were efficient at the rear, Dungas men were exceptionally mobile on the counters. Times without number, the Brazilians thwarted Argentine raids and launched offensives at lightning speed using the width of the field mostly the right flank as well as the middle channel. Two or three passes would often bring them within striking distance of the rival goal.

 There was not one Brazilian who stood out, everyone played a role in this well-orchestrated symphony. Baptista was the lone man stationed in the rival territory, the others moved around the park like men possessed. They all took turns to venture up front and retreat in the nick of time. 

 This team hardly resembled the Brazilian outfit which lost in the World Cup quarter final just over a year ago. No Dida, Cafu, Roberto Carlos, Ronaldo, Adriano. Not even Ronaldinho and Kaka. But none of them was missed on Sunday night.

 Brazil lost the first match of the tournament to Mexico and struggled to beat Uruguay in the semi-final, but against Argentina they were a different side altogether. 

 The Argentine defence was simply shell-shocked by the barrage of lightning forays. Even an experienced defender like Ayala panicked and put the ball into his own net!

 It had been Riquelme and Messis tournament before Sundays final. But one game changed the script so dramatically that the high-flying Argentines looked like men in a trance. Riquelme tried his best, but looked jaded as the minutes ticked by. He just didnt find his range with the free-kicks and the passes rarely found the feet they were meant for.

 The gifted midfielder could still have left his mark had the sidepost not come in the way of a powerful shot just after Baptista had put Brazil ahead. A 1-1 situation may have turned the game around.

 Ayalas suicidal goal minutes before half-time almost served as the killer blow. The Argentines still kept on attacking, but the likes of Messi, Tevez and Veron were guilty of too much dribbling. The one-dimensional attacks down the centre also didnt help their cause.

 This is not the first time the Argentines have flattered to deceive. 

 Like in the World Cup in Germany, they have come a cropper on the big stage when they were looking invincible. Perhaps they have a lesson or two to learn. When Plan A doesnt work, there has to be a Plan B to fall back on. There was none on Sunday.

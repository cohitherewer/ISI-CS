 Lahiri in lead

Bangalore: Anirban Lahiri turned in a second-round card of five-under 67 for an eight-stroke lead at the halfway stage of the LG Eagleton Amateur Golf Championship here on Wednesday. 

Lahiris tournament tally now stands at 11-under 133, well ahead of second placed duo of Arshdeep Tiwana (67) and Raj Randhawa (70) at 141. Bogeys on the ninth and 13th holes were the only blips in Lahiris otherwise sparkling round, which was studded with as many as seven birdies. (PTI)

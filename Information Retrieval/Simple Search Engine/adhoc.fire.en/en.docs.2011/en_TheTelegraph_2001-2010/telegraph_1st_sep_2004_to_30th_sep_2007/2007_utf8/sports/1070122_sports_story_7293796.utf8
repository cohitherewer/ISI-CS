 Sourav brings India back on track

 - Chanderpauls 149 n.o. in vain as Nagpur witnesses highest aggregate on Indian soil

Nagpur: It wasnt about the process or the strategy that Greg Chappell would have loved to call it, but one man who seems to add a new dimension to Team India. Sourav Ganguly has seen it all during his long international career, and on Sunday, once more reminded the national selectors and the team management what India missed out on during the last 16 months. 

Restoring the winning momentum, that began here in October 2005 and took a nosedive midway last year, seems to be back on the right track, and most importantly, in time for the World Cup. The 14-run victory in the opening match of the Pepsi Cup was achieved in the last over after Shivnarine Chanderpaul had given the hosts some anxious moments with a superbly crafted unbeaten 149. 

The placid wicket at the VCA Stadium, which has hosted its last international match, remained witness to the highest runs scored in a day on Indian soil 662. 

Man of the Match Chanderpaul kept the West Indies in the hunt till the end, needing 20 runs off the last over. But Sreesanth kept his cool and bowled a decent line and length to thwart the visitors hopes. Despite all of Chanderpauls heroics, it wasnt hard make out who the crowd favourite was. 

If Sourav was feeling the nerves having taken the field in a one-dayer after 16 months, he wasnt showing it. He left the first ball he faced from Ian Bradshaw, the second of the innings, with a quiet confidence that signified his determination. As Gautam Gambhir enjoyed most of the strike, his first run came off a gentle push to mid-on in the third over. Thereafter boundaries rained down as he shredded the attack with sublime orthodoxy. 

The silken touch to his off-side play was not to be missed, though. Gently caressing the ball between point and extra cover, he repeatedly found the gaps with precision and elan. A backfoot square drive, a late cut, a straight six, a six over mid wicket, the repertoire of strokes sent Brian Lara searching for answers. 

Was he a victim of the Nervous Nineties? Having scored the last of his 22 centuries almost four years ago, he was, no doubt, keen to get to the magical mark in his 280th game. He took the wise decision of concentrating only on the singles having reached 96. But having stopped midway after playing the ball to square leg, he couldnt beat Dwayne Smiths throw. 

The ifs and buts will linger. The cramps had started to bother him midway through the innings and his agility was bound to suffer at some stage. Constant attention from John Gloster did help, but the presence of a runner could have made a difference. 

Sourav (98 off 109 balls, 11x4, 3x6) not only provided direction to the innings, he also inspired Gambhir to make most of the opportunity. Under pressure to deliver, the Delhi lefthander prospered in the former captains company. The 144-run opening stand ensured India didnt have to look back. Gambhirs 69 off 76 balls will do his confidence a world of good. 

Both the openers batted well. They set up the game for us, Dravid acknowledged. 

Sachin Tendulkars brief appearance was encouraging until he missed the line to a full toss. With the opening pair playing out almost half of the full quota of overs, the vice-captain, in keeping with the ploy, was sent in at No. 3 to make use of the middle-overs. 

The stage was set for Mahendra Singh Dhonis fireworks. On this docile wicket, he made mincemeat of the bowling with four sixes and three fours during his unbeaten 62 off 42 balls. It was all power and timing as he added 119 in 71 balls during an unbroken stand with Rahul Dravid (54 not out off 35 balls). The Indian skipper played an uncharacteristic innings in an attempt to prove a point. 

Facing an almost impossible task, Chris Gayle and Chanderpaul started on a positive note. Gayle, who survived twice, used the long handle during his 52 off 46 balls. Chanderpaul was craftier, using the angles and his tensile wrists to good effect.

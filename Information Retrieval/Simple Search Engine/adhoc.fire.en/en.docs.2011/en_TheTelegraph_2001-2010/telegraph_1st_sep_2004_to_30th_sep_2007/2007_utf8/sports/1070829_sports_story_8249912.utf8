 Williams sisters make no mistake

Lisa Dillman

New York: So much for the wrist, the knee and the thumb. So much for the lack of serious match play leading into the US Open. 

It was all so much about Venus Williams and her sister Serena on the first night of the final Slam of the season. Monday night started as a tribute to Althea Gibson, and her historic victory 50 years ago at the US national championships, and ended as a celebration of the sisters. 

Venus moved in for her close-up first and equalled tennis history her own, in fact in the first set by hitting a record-tying serve of 129 mph against Kira Nagy. The 12th-seeded Williams needed a mere 54 minutes to defeat the qualifier from Hungary 6-2, 6-1, in the first round. 

Up next was Serena, seeded eighth, who had a much tougher go with Angelique Kerber of Germany. She looked almost subdued and sluggish early before picking up the pace and volume to win 6-3, 7-5, in one hour and 17 minutes. 

Still, despite not having played since injuring her left thumb at Wimbledon, she delivered in the critical moments, breaking Kerber at love in the eighth game of the first set. Serena also took determined aim at 129 hitting a 126-mph ace in the third game and finished with seven aces and 38 winners. 

As a little sister, I was jealous Venus got to play first, Serena said in her on-court TV interview. 

She wasnt the only Williams sister with a tough act to follow. Gibson, who died in 2003, was inducted into the US Open court of champions, and a group of female African American pioneers was on hand for the ceremony. 

One of the luminaries was singer Aretha Franklin, who spoke about the Williams sisters in a news conference, discussing, among other things, their fashion choices. Serena even performed her own alteration during the final changeover, removing the pink bow from her black dress before she served for the match. I got frustrated and I had to blame something, Serena said. 

Said Franklin, of the various outfits of the Williams sisters: Very daring. Very daring. But theyre young. Young people start new trends. I wish I was in the shape that Serena is. . . . One of my sons said, Mom, you know, I like her shape. All right, I think I know what youre saying. 

Venus spoke about the difficulty of coming on after the tribute. 

Well, it was definitely a tough act to follow in a way, she said. Just watching the whole hour of entertainment, the whole story, I got to be part of the story, too. . . . Its like, Ok, Williams cant lose tonight. Thats not part of the plan. Its supposed to be an all-American win tonight.

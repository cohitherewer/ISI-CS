The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Countdown to crickets

 biggest show

1979 

The second Prudential World Cup was similar in many ways to the first edition. England were the hosts once again and eight teams were in contention, the only change being Canada replacing East Africa. The biggest similarity was that Clive Lloyds men did an encore at Lords. The other difference was a qualification round the ICC Trophy was introduced to identify which two teams would join the heavyweights. Sri Lanka and Canada made the cut. 

India, clubbed with the West Indies, did worse than in 1975, failing to win a single game. Even the Sri Lankans (who had not attained Test status at that time) finished ahead of India with three points. The champions topped the group, followed by New Zealand. 

India got off to a bad start as their top order collapsed against a strong West Indies attack. The West Indies won by nine wickets, with Cup debutant Kapil Dev being the only wicket-taker. Then came an eight-wicket loss to New Zealand, which ended their hopes of qualifying for the knockout stage. 

The worst, though, was yet to come. The demoralised Indians, led once again by Srinivas Venkatraghavan, choked while chasing Sri Lankas 238. They were bowled out for 191 and thus ended their campaign without managing to breach the 200-barrier. 

The tournament did not see England and Australia fielding full-strength teams as their top players had joined Kerry Packers breakaway World Series Cricket. The inexperience of the 1975 runners-up came to the fore and the Aussies could not make the semis. The hosts made the last four, and went on to edge out New Zealand by nine runs to enter the title round. 

The West Indies overcame Pakistan in the other semi-final despite stiff resistance from Majid Khan and Zaheer Abbas. The stylish duo stitched together 166 for the second wicket, but Pakistan caved in after their departure to be all out for 250 in pursuit of 294. Viv Richards was the destroyer-in-chief with three for 52. 

In the final, Richards bat lorded over England. He smashed an unbeaten 138, peppered with 11 fours three sixes, as the West Indies tallied 286. England openers Mike Brearley and Geoffrey Boycott did lay a foundation of 129, but their sedate run-rate put so much pressure on the those who followed that the team was dismissed for a mere 194. The six-foot-eight giant called Joel Garner bagged five for 38, with Colin Croft (three for 42) playing an able supporting role to facilitate the trophy being lifted by Lloyd once more. 

It was a rain-affected event, with the World Cup seeing its first washout the West Indies versus Sri Lanka match at The Oval. Nonetheless, it was a successful tournament, just like the 1979 edition.

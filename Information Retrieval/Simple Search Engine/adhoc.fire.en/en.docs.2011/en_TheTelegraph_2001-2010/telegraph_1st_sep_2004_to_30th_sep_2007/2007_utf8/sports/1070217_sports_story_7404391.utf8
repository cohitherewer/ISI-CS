 Brett Lee in danger of missing Cup

Sydney: Australias pace spearhead Brett Lee is in danger of missing the World Cup after seriously injuring his ankle during the world champions tour of New Zealand. 

Lee returned home to Sydney before the first match of the Chappell-Hadlee series after twisting his left foot in training, leaving the paceman writhing in pain. 

Lee was cleared of any breaks but scans revealed he had suffered serious ligament damage and cannot walk without the aid of crutches and a brace. 

Australian team physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said Lee did not need immediate surgery to repair the damage, but will face a race against time to be ready for the World Cup. 

Brett has suffered a serious ligament injury to his left ankle, Kountouris said in a statement. He was seen by an orthopaedic surgeon who will review him in a weeks time and assess his prospects of playing in the World Cup. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Havent ever thought of calming down

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Sreesanth 

Nagpur: The quirks make Sreesanth. Be it on the field or off it, he likes to make his presence felt. 

Ask Andre Nel, who was taken aback by the spontaneous jig after being hit for a six during the Durban Test. An award-winning breakdancer, Sreesanth also loves to paint and write poems things he hasnt had much time for in the recent past. 

Breakdance! There is a rhythmic style to his action, a calm-down and blow-up routine at the top of his run-up that makes one sit up and take notice. And, if you didnt know, there is a difference in his feet size one is 11, the other 12. 

Indias most successful bowler in the Test series versus South Africa with 18 wickets is now setting new targets ahead of the World Cup. The Orange City will always enjoy special place in his heart, having made his ODI and Test debut here, versus Sri Lanka and England, respectively. 

What has he learnt after 22 one-dayers since October 2005? To be more patient... That one shouldnt lose hope easily, the 23-year-old told The Telegraph on the eve of the series versus the West Indies. 

It has been a learning experience right through, he explained. It has taught me to give your very best and not worry about the results. They will follow automatically. Keep working hard and the rest will all fall into place. 

His aggression has been making the headlines and he knows it is this trait of a fast bowler that really makes the difference. Its working... Im hoping not to get at the wrong end of it though, he says. 

Sreesanth attributes this aspect to his tennis ball-playing days in his hometown. In Kochi you dont have enough good grounds. We used to play a lot of tennis ball cricket. Even now when Im at home, we play it a lot. The aggression was learnt there and I havent ever thought of calming down. It gives you that cmon youre the very best feeling. 

So which does he rate his best performances so far? The six for 55 versus England in will stand out as my best in one-dayers. As for Tests, the five 40 against in South Africa recently will be at the top. 

Despite success early in his career, Sreesanth remains humble and down to earth. Dua karna bhaiya mere liye, he said, as the impromptu conversation came to an end. 

Sreesanth always strives to be different.

 Coroner probe on Oct. 16

Kingston: The long-awaited coroners inquest into the death of former Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer will begin on October 16, a Jamaican radio station reported on Tuesday. 

Radio Jamaica, citing Ken Pantry, the director of public prosecutions, said more than 50 witnesses would be called at the inquest, to be held at the Jamaica Conference Centre in Kingston. 

Woolmer was found unconscious in his Kingston hotel room on March 18, a day after Pakistan crashed out of the ICC World Cup following a shock defeat by Ireland.

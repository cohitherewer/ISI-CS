Madrid: Real Madrid moved into second place behind Barcelona in the Spanish title race after an inspired Guti steered them to a 3-2 comeback win over Sevilla in a high-tension clash at the Bernabeu on Sunday. 

Sevilla took the lead when Italian midfielder Enzo Maresca cracked home a stunning volley four minutes before the break, but with his team seemingly in trouble coach Fabio Capello threw on Guti in place of skipper Raul. 

The playmaker then provided three pin-point passes to set up three goals in the space of 24 minutes, two for leading striker Ruud van Nistelrooy and one for Brazilian forward Robinho. 

With five games left to play, the win catapulted Real into second spot in the table, two points behind champions Barcelona who claimed a 2-0 win away to Real Sociedad on Saturday. 

Uefa Cup finalists Sevilla drop to third spot, a further two points behind Real and two ahead of Valencia who beat Deportivo Coruna 2-1 on Saturday. 

This result makes us keener than ever to win the title race, said Reals sporting director Predrag Mijatovic. We are playing very well at this crucial stage of the season and though it wont be easy Im sure we can pull back the two points. 

Real, with a rejuvenated Emerson at the helm, made a confident start at a packed Bernabeu as they gave Sevilla several scares in the opening minutes. 

But Sevilla, who had energy-sapping semi-final victory over Osasuna on Wednesday, gradually found their rhythm and grabbed the lead four minutes before the break with a wonderfully struck dipping volley from Maresca. 

The Italian turned and cracked the ball beyond the reach of the despairing Iker Casillas from the edge of the area after Frederic Kanoute had nodded a Daniel Alves free-kick into his path. 

Capello sent on playmaker Guti 15 minutes into the second half in the hope of giving his side more control of the ball and the midfielder had an instant impact on the game. 

With almost his first intervention Guti surged up the middle, threaded a perfect pass into the path of Van Nistelrooy who rounded Palop and then turned the ball into the net with his right foot. 

Sevilla fullback Daniel Alves missed two great chances to restore his sides lead, but it was Real who went in front after another timely intervention from Guti. 

This time he slipped a pass through the Sevilla defence for Robinho and the Brazilian finished off coolly past keeper Andres Palop although he was sent off after picking up a second booking for taking off his shirt as he celebrated. 

Sevilla suffered another blow when they too were reduced to 10 men, defender Aitor Ocio receiving his marching orders for tussling with Diarra in the area and Guti soon took advantage to set up Reals third goal. 

This time he caught Sevilla out when clipped the ball wide out to the right for defender Sergio Ramos whose shot was blocked by Palop but van Nistelrooy was on hand to head in from point blank range to take his tally for the season to 20 goals. 

Sevilla substitute Ernesto Chevanton cracked home a free kick from the edge of the area deep in injury time but it came too late to influence the result. 

Meanwhile, Juventus scored two goals in a minute to draw 2-2 at Cesena on Sunday and keep their promotion juggernaut on course for Serie A. 

Emiliano Salvetti struck on 11 minutes to give the Serie B leaders a scare before David Trezeguet and Pavel Nedved netted in quick succession just before halftime. 

Cesena forward NDiaye Papa Waigo then grabbed an equaliser 10 minutes into the second half when he ghosted in at the far post to slam home from close range. 

Juventus are now eight points clear of third place with five matches remaining and look certain to make an immediate return to the top flight after they were relegated last season for their part in a match-fixing scandal. 

The Turin club would have been promoted already had it not been for a nine-point penalty also incurred because of the match-fixing verdict. 

Ascoli and Messina were relegated from Serie A after defeats on Sunday while Champions League finalists AC Milan could only draw 0-0 at home to Fiorentina.

 Valencia: Valencia will stage the European Grand Prix starting next year after Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone signed a seven-year contract with event organisers Friday.

 The Valencia regional government confirmed that Ecclestone signed the agreement with Valmor Sport, which owns the rights to organise the street circuit race. The regional government has a 25 per cent stake in the private business.

 The agreement to bring a second F1 race to Spain after the Spanish GP in Barcelona was originally announced on May 10. Ecclestone said at the time that the contract would only be signed once the outcome of the regional and municipal elections were confirmed.

 Reports said Valmor would pay euro26 million ($35.17 million) annually to Ecclestone for the rights to stage the race, an event previously held in Nuerburgring, Germany. The Valencia race is likely to be held in August.

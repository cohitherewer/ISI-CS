The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Lack of continuity is an impediment

 -With the FIH project in place ,we 

 are optimistic

After fall from the grace, Its 

 time to feel the pressure. Indeed, there has been pressure 

 both from within and out to make headway in bringing 

 Indian hockey back on track. Our continuing streak of pathetic 

 displays has remained a grave concern for International 

 Hockey Federation (FIH) and it has already identified some 

 areas to look into and is putting pressure on 

 the Indian counterpart to ensure these are properly addressed.

 In connection with the project, 

 called Promotion Indian Hockey, the FIH official and project 

 leader Bab Davidzson of The Netherlands has already discussed 

 several issues with the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF). 

 We are all hopeful of putting together a roadmap that will 

 help us bounce back into international reckoning soon.

 Ive received some papers 

 regarding the issue. Strategic options need to be discussed 

 and evaluated as fast as possible so that some plans are 

 put into place. 

 During the ongoing Premier Hockey 

 League (PHL), the dearth of women umpires came up for discussion 

 during our meeting with Davidzson and other FIH officials. 

 In case of other nations, both 

 mens and womens federation are single entity. 

 However, FIH has asked both IHF as well as Indian Women 

 Hockey Federation to address this area of concern. 

 We are on the final stage of the 

 PHL in Chennai before it shifts base to Chandigarh. The 

 meet so far has been characterised by a lot of resentment 

 from the coaches end against umpiring decisions. 

 The way AK Bansal of Orissa Steelers 

 uttered foul languages against the match officials during 

 a match, it smacked of utter bad taste. 

 I must say that in international 

 hockey, India and Pakistan players and officials are the 

 most bad-mouthed ones and this is why, we usually end up 

 receiving so many cautions. 

 So far the standard of hockey 

 in the PHL has not been quite up to the mark. Despite presence 

 of so many international players, matches lack certain degree 

 of cutting edge, something which usually provides an air 

 of extraordinariness to the tournament. Hopefully, we will 

 get to see a change in the trend when the Chandigarh leg 

 commences the next week. 

 Coming back to the roadmap of 

 our recovery, a pain in the neck remains our lack of continuity 

 in the various age-group sides. 

 Truth to tell, this has impeded 

 our progress to a significant extent. Our thrust in the 

 past has been on developing one senior side and another 

 junior one. 

 But now, the IHF is planning to 

 come up with four national sides from the sub-junior level 

 to the senior one. However, the big question remains who 

 will coach them?

 It, thus, leads us to the issue 

 of that lack of continuity. In todays hockey, tactics 

 play a vital role. Formation-wise, players are learnt to 

 flourish on 2-3-5 or 2-4-4. In Indias case, the problem 

 lies in the very process of the learning. With no proper 

 system in place, players in various age groups learn to 

 play the game under different coaches, who have their own 

 styles and set-up. 

 So when the boys face the moment 

 of graduating into the big league that is to say, representing 

 the country as a member of the senior side they struggle 

 to cope up with new tactics and strategies. This issue needs 

 to be addressed immediately at a time when the IHF starts 

 looking into the FIH project.

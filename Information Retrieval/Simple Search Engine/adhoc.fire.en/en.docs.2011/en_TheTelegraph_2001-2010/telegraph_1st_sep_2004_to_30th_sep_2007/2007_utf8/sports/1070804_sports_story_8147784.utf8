 Arjun Atwal at 14th spot

Wichita (US): Arjun Atwal, putting like a dream, rode a five-birdie streak to bring in a five-under 66 and lie 14th on a crowded leaderboard at the Preferred Health Systems Wichita Open on the Nationwide Tour in the US. 

Atwal, who is now topping the putting averages on the Nationwide Tour needed just 22 putts for the round at the Crestview Country Club on Thursday. 

Atwal, former Asia No. 1, was four shots behind leader Nicholas Thompson, who shot a flawless 62 to take a two-stroke lead after the opening round. 

Playing at the shortish 6,886-yard, par-71 which affords a lot of birdie opportunities, Atwal started on the tenth and birdied the 11th. 

But he dropped a shot on 12th hole, which brought him back to par. 

Then came the superb stretch from 14th to 18th where he birdied each of the five holes and then added another birdie on second. 

He was six-under at that stage. A dropped shot on fourth meant he finished at five-under. 

Atwal, who topped the PGA Tour putting averages in 2004, is currently leading the Nationwide Tour putting averages by more than half a shot. 

At 43rd on the money list, Atwal needs to get into the top-25 to earn a full card for 2008 PGA Tour.

 Title for Goosen, Jeev finishes 22nd 

Doha: Jeev Milkha Singh finished a disappointing 22nd while South Africas Retief Goosen clinch the 10th Commercial Bank Qatar Masters golf tournament on Sunday. 

Goosen sank a sensational 30-foot putt for an eagle to dramatically end his title drought, his last win coming in December 2005. The in the process he handed Australian Nick Hern, who has never won on the European Tour, a record seventh career second place on said Tour. 

Jeev shot 70 in the final round to end up 22nd, while Shiv Kapur finished 27th and S.S.P. Chowrasia tied 65th. 

Goosen birdied the 17th and at 13-under needed to birdie the 18th to get into a tie with Hern who was at 14-under coming to the 18th tee. 

Goosen, who hadnt found the fairway at the 18th on the three previous days, finally did on Sunday and then hit a brilliant second shot to within 30 feet of the cup. He sank that putt to go to 15-under. 

Hern needed to sink a birdie putt of less than 10 feet to send the tournament into a play-off. But he missed, staying at 14-under to once again finish second-best. 

Kapur overcame a disastrous stretch of three bogeys in three holes as he finished with two birdies on the last three holes to bring in a one-under 71 for a total of five-under 283. Chowrasia had a final round two-over 74 and a total of four-over 292. 

At the start of the week I was looking for a top-10 finish, but I will take this as I was happy with the way my game was looking in the last round, said Jeev, who is headed for the Dubai Desert Classic next week. 

I was hitting well, and also rolling the putts well. Sure the score of 70 did not look so great, but considering I did not practice much during the off-season break, I think I am getting back slowly into shape after the last couple of weeks of play.

Calcutta: Around 35 club representatives gathered at the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) to discuss who to support at the February 1 special general body meeting of the association. They have formed a three-member core committee, who will speak to the candidates for the presidents post. 

According to sources, among minor divisions, many of the representatives want a good leadership and they are completely averse to any politician being at the helm of affairs. We have to see which way things are going and then take a decision as we are not opportunists We want a clean and sporting environment at the CAB, a veteran club representative said. 

According to the discussions that took place at the meeting on Monday, the majority were for a consensus candidate. In case there is an election, the affiliated units will support the city police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee. 

Another source confirmed that even though sports minister Subhas Chakraborty hasnt announced his candidature, few people close to Jagmohan Dalmiya have already started campaigning for him. The last date of filing nominations is January 24.

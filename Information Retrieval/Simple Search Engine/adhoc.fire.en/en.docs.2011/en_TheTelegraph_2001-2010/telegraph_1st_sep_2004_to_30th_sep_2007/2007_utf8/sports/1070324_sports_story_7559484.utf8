 Flintoff return a boost for England 

Gros Islet: England battle Kenya for a place in the Super Eight on Saturday with both sides hoping their troops can remain focused after the tragic news that Bob Woolmer had been murdered. 

England captain Michael Vaughan is well aware that Kenya, surprise semi-finalists in 2003, pose a credible threat to his sides chances of qualifying for the second round and any loss of concentration could be crucial in the final group C match. 

Its very difficult to talk about the game of cricket when an incident like this has taken place but thats what we must do, he said. 

(Cricket) has taken a big hit. Its been a very strange week but we have to try to get the preparation right for tomorrows game. We realise Kenya are a very good team and can cause a huge shock on their day. 

A tame defeat to New Zealand followed but Steve Tikolo is confident his side can pack England off home and make the Super Eight. 

Our chances are good if we do the basics right, said the 35-year-old mainstay of four World Cups. 

Kenyas impressive spin attack of Jimmy Kamande and Hiren Varaiya may cause England problems although Vaughans side will be greatly improved by the return of Andrew Flntoff. 

The allrounder was stripped of the vice-captaincy and banned from Sundays win over Canada after a late night drinking binge. 

The 29-year-old will be desperate to make his mark for the right reasons, with England badly missing his penetrative bowling in the laboured 51-run win over Canada. 

His destructive batting has been less consistent of late though and he made a first ball duck in the opening defeat by New Zealand last Friday. 

Ravinder Bopara is likely to make way for Flintoff with the rest of the England line-up expected to be the same, meaning James Anderson and Liam Plunkett will continue as the front-line seamers despite mixed displays so far. 

If the game is a washout on Saturday and Sundays reserve day then England will go through because of their better net run rate. 

However, Paul Collingwood believes Flintoff will put his off-field problems be hind him when England play Kenya in their final group league clash. I think Freddie (Flintoff) will respond well, the whole team will. I faced him in the nets the other day and it was proper gas. It was up there.

 Pradeep to return home

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Midfielder N. P. Pradeep, currently with the Indian team in Portugal, has been rushed back to India on Saturday because of his fathers death. 

Pradeeps father has died in Kochi, said an AIFF official. He should be here by Sunday evening. 

Meanwhile, India will meet GDR Monsanto at Torres Novas Stadium on Sunday for the last match of the tour. 

Chief coach Bob Houghton said he would like to start with first team that includes skipper Bhaichung Bhutia. The captain, however, is unlikely to play as he has been advised five-day rest by the doctor.

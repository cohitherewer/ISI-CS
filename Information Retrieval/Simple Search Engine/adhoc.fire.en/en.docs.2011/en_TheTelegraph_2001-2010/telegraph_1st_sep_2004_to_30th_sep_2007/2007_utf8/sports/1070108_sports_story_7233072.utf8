 Jeev to begin season in Woods company

 Dubai classic 

 Jeev has learnt a lot from Woods 

Dubai: After a brilliant season last year, Indias Jeev Milkha Singh will begin his New Year in the company of Tiger Woods at the Dubai Desert Classic at the Emirates Golf Club from February 1 to 4. 

Jeev, the winner of the UBS Asian Tour Order of Merit, is currently ranked 37th following his four wins on three Tours. 

The Chandigarh pro will be accompanied by three other Indians Jyoti Randhawa, Shiv Kapur and Harmeet Kahlon. 

Both Randhawa and Kapur have full playing rights in Europe as well as Asia, while Kahlon qualified for the Dubai Classic by winning the Emaar-PGTI title. 

I am looking forward to playing in the Dubai Desert Classic, a tournament which I believe is one of the best-organised events in the world, Jeev said. 

I know there are a lot of Indians out there in the UAE, who will be keenly watching our progress and all I can say is that we will try and give our best to ensure they are not disappointed, he added. 

Jeev, who went seven years without a title, won the Volvo China Open and then added the Volvo Masters in Spain and back-to-back wins in Japan, on his way to a first Asian Tour Order of Merit title. 

Finishing inside top-50 of the world has also assured Jeev starts in all four majors as well as the high-profile and lucrative World Golf Championships events. 

It was an uphill battle for me, but I am fortunate to be back in the winning circle, Jeev said. It was a dream year for me. I think Asians have a lot of talent and that they can play with the best in the world. 

Playing against some of the top golfers will always be tough, but I have seen Woods playing and have learnt a lot from him, said Jeev. 

Jeev, meanwhile, has opted out of the Pakistan Open, where he had finished runner-up in the last edition. 

Jeev has decided to give the January 15-18 event a miss, apparently because of a cramped schedule in the coming months. 

However, India would be sending a 22-member contingent to the championship that has a prize money of $300,000 and is part of the Asian Tour calendar. 

The Indian federation has sent us their confirmation and their participation will lift the interest in the event, Pakistan Golf Federation secretary Taimur Hasan said. 

Also competing in the event here would be golfers from England, the United States, South Africa, Australia and Japan. 

In Jeevs absence, Gaurav Ghei and Koreas Suk Jong-yul are contenders for the title. 

As many as 30 Pakistani golfers will also feature in the event.

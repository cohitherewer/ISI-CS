 NZC panel for coach

Melbourne: New Zealand Cricket has formed a five-man sub-committee to determine who will coach the national team. 

The sub-committee will determine whether John Bracewell, whose contract expires in July-end, should be retained or not. 

No date has been set by which the group hoped to make an announcement. Vaughan is currently overseas with ICC commitments. (PTI)

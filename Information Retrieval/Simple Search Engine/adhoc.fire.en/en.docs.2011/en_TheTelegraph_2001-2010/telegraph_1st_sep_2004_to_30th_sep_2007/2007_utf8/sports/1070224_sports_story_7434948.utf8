Karachi: The majority of Pakistans World Cup squad members and reserve players Friday cleared the dope tests but the Pakistan Cricket Boards anxiety still remained with fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif yet to get a clearance for the mega-event. 

The tests we had on 11 selected members of the team and seven reserves have all come negative for any sort of banned substance, a senior PCB official said. 

We are happy at the outcome of the tests but obviously we are anxious to complete the dope tests on Shoaib and Asif as soon as possible, he said. 

The official said the two bowlers, who had tested positive for a banned substance, nandrolone last year, reported for the training camp which started Friday at the Gaddafi and would appear for dope tests Saturday. 

The results of the tests conducted on captain Inzamam-ul Haq and Shahid Afridi were still awaited. 

The official reiterated PCBs policy of not sending any player to the World Cup who did not clear the dope tests or was not passed fit by a medical panel of the board. 

The players who cleared the tests include Younis Khan, Mohammed Yousuf, Danish Kaneria, Shoaib Malik, Abdul Razzaq, Kamran Akmal, Rao Iftikhar, Umar Gul, Rana Naved-ul Hasan, Imran Nazir and Mohammed Hafeez. 

Shoaib and Asif remain the main worry for Pakistan after they were banned last year in November for their positive tests and were than cleared by an appeals committee. 

Shoaib, Asif and Gul face a fitness test next week before they become certain to play in the World Cup. Shoaib has a knee problem while Asif is nursing an elbow injury. Gul is recuperating from an ankle fracture. 

PCB director, cricket operations, Saleem Altaf said Pakistan wanted to ensure they were no doping issues in the World Cup and would hopefully have results on Shoaib and Asif by next week. 

We are paying extra to get the results of the test from the accredited laboratory in Malaysia within 48 working hours, he said.

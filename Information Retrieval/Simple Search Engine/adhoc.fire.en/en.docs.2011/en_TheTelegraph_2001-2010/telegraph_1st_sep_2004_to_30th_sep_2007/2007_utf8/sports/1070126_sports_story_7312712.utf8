 Sachin ducking for cover 

Cuttack: Sachin Tendulkar is fast approaching a record he would not like to be associated with. 

The worlds most successful batsman registered his 17th duck in 376 matches against the West Indies in the second one-day International in Cuttack. 

The Mumbai batsman is fast catching up on this count with Jawagal Srinath and Anil Kumble, who, however, are not known for their batting prowess. Srinath leads the Indian list with 19 ducks, just ahead of Kumble on 18. 

The dubious world record for the highest number of ducks in one-dayers is surprisingly held by Sri Lankan marauder Sanath Jayasuriya (29). Wasim Akram (28) and Romesh Kaluwitharana (24) come next. (Agencies)

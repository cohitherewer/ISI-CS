 Vision Delhi runs into darkness

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Light has gone out of the All India Football Federations Vision Delhi project, literally. All works in the dream project of AIFF president Priyaranjan Das Munshi have come to a standstill following disconnection of electricity by SAI in the Nehru Stadium office of the federation for non-payment of bills. 

In an embarrassing development, SAI decided to disconnect electricity after the federation failed to pay up an outstanding bill of Rs 1,15,000. This has put us in deep trouble, said Nasir Ali, the chief co-ordinator of Vision Delhi. This is an important AFC project, but for the past 15 days we dont even have a place to sit, leave alone work. We have informed the AIFF, but nothing has been done so far. 

An AIFF official, when contacted said one should not read too much into it. There are other sports federation offices in the Nehru Stadium, whose outstanding electricity bills have run up to more than Rs 10 lakh. But SAI has not disconnected their supply of electricity.

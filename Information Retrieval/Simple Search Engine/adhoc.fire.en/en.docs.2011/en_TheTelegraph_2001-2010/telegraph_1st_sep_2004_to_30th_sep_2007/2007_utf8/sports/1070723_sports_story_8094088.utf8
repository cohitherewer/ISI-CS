 Years sixth title for Nadal

Berlin: World No. 2 Rafael Nadal won his sixth title of the year on Sunday, seeing off a stiff challenge from unseeded Stanislas Wawrinka to win the Stuttgart Cup final 6-4, 7-5. 

The French Open champion, competing in his 16th straight claycourt final, was made to work hard by the Swiss world No. 50 and came back from 2-5 down in the second set to clinch victory in just over two hours. 

It was Nadals second win in Stuttgart and he improves his 2007 win-loss record to 56-8, with 31-1 on clay. 

Wawrinka was out for three months earlier this year with a knee injury but pushed the 21-year-old Spaniard harder than any of his opponents at the Weissenhof this week and broke the top seed three times. (Reuters)

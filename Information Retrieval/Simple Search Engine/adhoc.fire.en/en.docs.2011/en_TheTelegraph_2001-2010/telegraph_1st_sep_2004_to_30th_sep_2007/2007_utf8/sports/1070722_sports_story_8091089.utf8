 Houghtons new strategy

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: After a competitive 1-1 draw in the first match in Portugal, national coach Bob Houghton is planning an altogether different strategy in the next outing. 

On Sunday night, when India take on second division side Recreativo Agueda at the Aguedas Municipal Stadium, Houghton in all likelihood would field a second string, at least in the first session. 

Against Odivelas FC, we started with the first teams and fielded others in the later stages, team sources said. The coach is likely to reverse it tomorrow. 

As per the plan, skipper Bhaichung Bhutia along with his regular striking partner Sunil Chhetri would warm the bench in the first-half leaving Abhishek Yadav and Tariq Ahmed to start with. 

The India team will be welcomed by the city mayor, who would be hosting a dinner. 

Indias presence in Portugal has already attracted some media attention mainly because of Houghton. In the 80s, Houghton was tipped to be the Benfica coach but eventually lost out to Sven Goran Eriksson.

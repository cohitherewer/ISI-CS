The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pawars idea out of the blue 

A STAFF REPORTER AND AGENCIES 

Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will seek the opinion of former captains on April 6 to decide the future of the game in the country following Team Indias ignominious first-round exit from the World Cup. 

The BCCI office-bearers will meet a few former captains, whose names will be decided later, on April 6 in Mumbai a day before the working committee meets, chief administrative officer Prof. Ratnakar Shetty said on Monday. 

Though the names have not been finalised, there is likely to be a contemporary feel to that list of captains. Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, Dilip Vengsarkar, Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Ravi Shastri are likely to be invited. Perhaps even Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi. 

BCCI president Sharad Pawar, the vice-presidents, secretary, joint secretary and treasurer are all expected to meet the ex-captains. 

Confirming the development, Pawar said: We will sit with former captains like Gavaskar and Kapil to get their advice on Indian cricket based on their experiences. We will discuss in detail Indias World Cup performance. 

We will see the manager Sanjay Jagdales report and also ask his personal observations during the tour. We will also give a chance to the coach and listen to what he has to say and discuss about the captaincy as well, he told a TV channel. 

Asked specifically if the BCCI was contemplating a change in coach, Pawar said: First we have to decide if we want a change If we do, we have to see who will perform the job better. It is not an individuals decision. We will take such a major decision with the help of knowledgeable peoples advice. 

Incidentally, Pawar also said that the BCCI is thinking of having two teams, in a bid to provide exposure to young players. 

We want to give exposure to young players but it is possible that everyone may not get a place in the main team. So, to give exposure to the newcomers at international level, we can have two teams India Seniors and India Blues, so that they can get experience on foreign pitches, the BCCI chief said. 

However, no BCCI official has any idea about it and even selection committee chairman Vengsarkar is in the dark. 

Meanwhile, BCCI vice-president Dayanand Narvekar described the World Cup squad as most indisciplined and on an enjoyment spree. 

 While on the West Indies tour (in April 2006) I had seen these boys loitering around till 1 clock at night, smoking, the Goa Cricket Association chief was quoted as saying by an agency in Panaji.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Test thrown wide open

 - Dhoni caught in controversy on second afternoon 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Wasim Jaffer

London: Were in for a fascinating Test at Lords, an advertisement both for the three-match npower series and the sport itself. 

Up against Englands 298, the Indians were 145 for four in their first innings at stumps on Day II. At the wicket were Sourav Ganguly and nightwatchman Rudra Pratap Singh. 

Familiar with just about every blade of grass (having got a hundred on debut 11 summers ago), Sourav has been around for 76 minutes and must build on the 25 runs already in his account. 

Conditions are conducive for the exponents of swing and lanky debutant Chris Tremlett who sent back Wasim Jaffer (58) could prove a tough customer. 

Hopefully, the face-off wont be remembered for the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-Simon Taufel incident, where the worlds No.1 umpire for the last three years upheld an appeal against Kevin Pietersen which (as replays showed) wasnt legitimate. 

Pietersen had begun to walk back when the England balcony shouted that he stay put. By then, Taufel had begun conferring with on-field colleague Steve Bucknor. Soon enough, the decision was reversed. 

Till late on Friday, though, it wasnt clear whether the TV umpire had come into play. 

Its another matter that the highly-rated Pietersen didnt add to his score and, in the next Zaheer Khan over, got taken by Dhoni. 

Having done the unexpected (going by their bowling on the first day), the Indians had an excellent opportunity to start big and, then, consolidate. That didnt happen, with Dinesh Karthik and captain Rahul Dravid (out to a beautiful outswinger from James Anderson) falling early. 

Jaffer and Sachin Tendulkar did have a 79-run partnership for the third-wicket, but the latter couldnt significantly improve on his best in Tests at Lords. Sachin became another Anderson victim. 

After doing all the hard work, Jaffer gave it away not many minutes from the close. 

Earlier, in a collapse as dramatic as the confession by seven members of Prime Minister Gordon Browns cabinet that theyd smoked cannabis, the last six England wickets fell within 26 runs and 10.5 overs in exactly an hour after a delayed start. 

Play did get underway well behind schedule, but full marks to the Lords ground staff for reducing the time which couldve been lost. That the Home of Cricket has a superb drainage system helped. 

For India, the second new ball did the trick, with RP getting a wicket (nightwatchman Ryan Sidebottoms) on the very second delivery. 

Zaheer was the next to strike as Pietersen, who has been complaining of fatigue, didnt move his feet and made nothing of the reprieve. Sreesanth then got three lbws before Zaheer ended the innings by claiming Ian Bell. 

The combative Sreesanth finished with three for 67. Souravs bowling yesterday inspired me... As for myself, Id probably got carried away (by the Lords aura)... he said. 

The Indians bowled in the right areas... They were far more disciplined than on the first day... Plus, the wicket got quicker and the batsmen didnt adjust, former India captain and cricket manager Ravi Shastri told The Telegraph. 

Clearly, adapting to the movement and pace will be the name of the game on Day III as well.

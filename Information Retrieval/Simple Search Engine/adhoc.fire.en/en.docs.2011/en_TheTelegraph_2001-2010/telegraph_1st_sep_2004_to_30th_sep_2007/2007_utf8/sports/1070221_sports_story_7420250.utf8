 Memphis: Former world No.1 

 Venus Williams made a winning comeback after four months 

 out through injury as she beat Japans Akiko Morigami 

 6-1, 2-6, 6-4 in the first round of the Memphis International 

 on Monday.

 In only her second match since 

 July because of knee and wrist problems, the seventh seed 

 was understandably rusty but overcame eight double faults 

 to battle to victory.

 Im really excited 

 to win my first match back and excited to be back full stop, 

 Williams said. It was tough because so many things 

 were going through my head, wanting to do well. Towards 

 the end of the match I started getting a bit more clarity 

 but she lifted her level too, so it was tough.

 Williams, who has slipped to 54 

 in the rankings, won the first set in 25 minutes but as 

 her serve malfunctioned, she was broken three times as Morigami 

 levelled the match.

 But two poor e rrors from the 

 world No. 65 handed the American the break in the seventh 

 game of the decider and Williams held on to advance to a 

 meeting with 16-year-old Dane Caroline Wozniacki.

 I am pleased I was able 

 to lift my level when I needed to and close out the match, 

 she said. I think I am only going to get better with 

 each match.

 American sixth seed Shenay Perry 

 was pushed hard before squeezing past Youlia Fedossova 6-7, 

 6-3, 7-5, while eighth seed Jill Craybas was another first-round 

 winner.

 In the mens event, fifth 

 seed Xavier Malisse had to retire in the second set of his 

 match with Russian Teimuraz Gabashvili after injuring his 

 right wrist.

 I hit a backhand and kind 

 of snapped my wrist a little bit, Malisse said. 

 I think I just kind of snapped 

 something. Ive got to see what it is. I hope its 

 not too bad but today its not possible to play on 

 because I couldnt hold my racket.

 Sixth seed Jurgen Melzer needed 

 a third-set tie-break to get past American qualifier Jesse 

 Witten 1-6, 6-3, 7-6 while another Austrian, Stefan Koubek, 

 also advanced.

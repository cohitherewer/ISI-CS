 CAB gets ready for India camp

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal will leave no stone unturned to make the conditioning camp (May 2-6) for the Bangladesh tour at the Eden successful, even as the threat of unexpected showers looms large. 

Besides the pitch covers, two super soppers will be kept ready to deal with any emergency, said CAB joint secretary Saradindu Pal. 

Two wickets in the main square will be made available, beside the four practice wickets. 

He also added that adequate security arrangements will be made around the stadium during the five-day camp. Nobody, including the media, will be allowed inside the stadium without a pass, he said. 

The CAB was informed about the camp by the BCCI through an e-mail on Thursday afternoon. The BCCI has mailed us the itinerary and tomorrow I will chalk out the detail plans, Pal said. 

The players will assemble in the city on May 1. For the record, the team will play three ODIs and two Test matches during their tour. The squad for the ODIs and Tests will be picked on April 20 in Mumbai. 

Former India captain Sourav Ganguly, meanwhile, had a physical training session for about half an hour at the Eastern Railway Sports Complex, near his Behala residence, on Thursday. He is expected to sweat it out at the Eden on Friday. 

Sourav will leave for Ahmedabad on Sunday to play Bengals last two National Twenty20 matches against Madhya Pradesh (April 17) and Mumbai (April 19).

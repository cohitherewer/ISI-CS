 BCCI threatens to take action against Kapil Dev over ICL

 Kapil Dev 

New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Tuesday threatened to take appropriate steps against former captain Kapil Dev for aligning with Indian Cricket League (ICL) despite occupying the post of National Cricket Academy (NCA) chairman. 

The BCCI said that it had made it very clear that no cricketer or official should be part of the ICL and it was for Kapil to relinquish one post. 

The board does not recognise the ICL. It was a decision of the working committee that any cricketer or official involved with the ICL would have no role within the BCCI. It is for Kapil Dev to decide what he wants to do, joint secretary M.P. Pandove said on Tuesday. 

Asked what the board would do if Indias lone World-Cup winning captain did not relinquish the NCA chairmans post, Pandove said, we will discuss the issue and take appropriate steps. 

After the BCCI had shot off a letter to Kapil asking him not to align with the ICL, the iconic former allrounder sent his reply and dared the Board to sack him. 

They can remove me from the NCA if they wish to. They wanted me to contribute to the game. They cannot challenge me for doing so. If I do something for the game and young cricketers through the ICL, I will not budge, he asserted. 

Pandove said the BCCI chief, Sharad Pawar, had authorised some officials to talk to Kapil on this issue. 

He is a respected cricketer and we wanted to know his views. But we havent got any feedback from them, he said. 

Kapil was not bothered by the fact that siding with the ICL may cost him his pension. 

I did not go to them asking for it If they want to stop it, what can I do? Let them, the iconic former captain had said. 

Recently, former India wicketkeeper and ex-chief selector Kiran More quit the BCA secretarys post to join Kapil at the ICL executive board. 

Another former Indian player, Sandeep Patil, has also joined the group.

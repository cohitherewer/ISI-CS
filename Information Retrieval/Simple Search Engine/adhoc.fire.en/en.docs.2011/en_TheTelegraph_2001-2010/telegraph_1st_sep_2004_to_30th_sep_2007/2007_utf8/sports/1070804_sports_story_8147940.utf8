 Sania sets up quarter-final date with Sharapova

 - SAN DIEGO CLASSIC 

 - Indian bows out of doubles 

San Diego: Sania Mirza swept past Russian eighth seed Dinara Safina 6-1, 6-2 to set up a quarter-final clash with world No. 2 and defending champion Maria Sharapova at the $1.3 WTA Acura Classic on Thursday. 

The Indian, who has won 10 of her last 12 matches, will take on top seed Sharapova after the Russian outplayed Frenchwoman Tatiana Golovin 6-0, 6-3 in her third-round match at the Tier I hard court event. 

Sania and Sharapova have clashed only once the Russian demolishing her 6-2, 6-1 in the pre-quarter finals of the 2005 US Open. 

The unseeded Indian, who was playing Safina for the first time, outpaced her on the baseline and struck powerful strokes to take a 5-0 lead in the first set. 

Safina, younger sister of Marat Safin, threw her racquet in frustration after sending a forehand wide to drop serve for the third time in the set. 

Safina managed to break back in the sixth game when Sania double-faulted on break point, but that ended up being the only game the Russian won in the opening set. 

In the final game with Safina serving, Sania earned a break point after the world No. 14 double-faulted but squandered the opportunity by sailing a forehand beyond the baseline. 

However, the 20-year-old got a second chance with an inside-out forehand down the line. She closed out the set with a service return winner. 

Safina tried to claw her way back into the match and broke Sania at love to open the second set. 

The Indian broke back immediately and went on to take a 4-1 lead. 

Two games later, Safina was serving to stay in the match trailing 2-5, but Sania broke her to love to seal the match after an hour and four minutes. 

Sania and Shahar Peer, however, crashed out in the second round of the doubles event. The seventh seeds lost to Su-Wei Hseih of Chinese Taipei and Alla Kudryavtseva of Russia 6-3, 3-6, 10-12. 

In other singles play, Russias Maria Kirilenko stunned second seed Jelena Jankovic 6-2, 3-6, 7-5, while ninth seed Elena Dementieva of Russia beat fifth seed Marion Bartoli of France 6-4, 7-5. 

Third seed Chakvetadze overcame Japans Ai Sugiyama 6-4, 6-4, and No. 4 Nadia Petrova took down Katarina Srebotnik of Slovenia 6-3, 7-6. 

Switzerlands Patty Schnyder upended compatriot Martina Hingis 6-1, 6-7, 6-3 and will face Petrova in the final eight. 

Wimbledon champion Venus Williams continued her strong play, defeating sixth seed Daniela Hantuchova 6-0, 6-3 to set up a match with Chakvetadze.

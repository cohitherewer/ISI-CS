 Pak board seeks BCCI help

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has sought help from other boards, including the BCCI, in its bid to prepare new central contracts for the players and make them more performance-based. 

The PCB has already obtained copies of central contracts issued by the Australian, South African and England cricket boards. 

The idea is to study all of them and see how these boards pay their players. We will then try to incorporate the finer points in our own contracts which will be issued afresh now by June, a senior PCB official said. 

The board had suspended the central contracts awarded to 20 players after the team was knocked out of the World Cup, which included a shock defeat at the hands of minnows Ireland. The PCB said it would issue contracts which would be more performance-based. 

Definitely the idea is to make the players sweat for their just rewards. We will have more stringent clauses dealing with the individual endorsement and sponsorship deals the players sign with companies and media houses, the official said. 

The PCB will also advertise for the post of national coach following the death of Bob Woolmer. The advertisement posted on their website has called for interested candidates to submit their applications by May 15. 

We have set certain standards to apply for the post. Anyone meeting our criteria, including foreigners, are welcome to apply, Zakir Khan, director, cricket operations of the board said on Tuesday. The Pakistan board said in the advertisement that the appointment of the coach would be initially for two years. 

We are keeping an open mind. We will complete our selection process by June, Zakir said.

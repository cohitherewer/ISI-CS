 Atwal struggles

Boise (US): Arjun Atwal continued to struggle as he hit a one-over 72 that placed him at a lowly 121 after the first round of the Albertsons Boise Open on the Nationwide Tour. 

Atwal shot three birdies and four bogeys on Thursday and will need to shoot a low card on Friday to make the weekend rounds. 

There was a four-way tie at the top with Jim McGovern, Nicholas Thompson, Jeff Klauk and Brendan Pappas shooting eight-under 63s.

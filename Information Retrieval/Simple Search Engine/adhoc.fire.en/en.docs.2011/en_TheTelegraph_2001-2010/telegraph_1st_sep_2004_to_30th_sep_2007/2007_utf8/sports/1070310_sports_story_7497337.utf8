 We may cause some upsets: Whatmore

Bridgetown: Bangladesh underlined their intentions of springing a few surprises at the World Cup after they finished their warm-up games undefeated with a comprehensive seven-wicket win over Scotland on Thursday. 

Following on from their stunning two-wicket upset of New Zealand on Tuesday, Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar led from the front with an unbeaten 57 to overhaul Scotlands 152 for nine with more than 15 overs to spare. 

Were improving all the time and I just feel its becoming more of a reality that the Bangladesh team may cause one or two upsets, coach Dav Whatmore said. Were ranked ninth ... and most judges around the world will expect the opposition to beat Bangladesh every time. So its also fair to say we may cause an upset or two. 

Batting first, the Scots made a promising start to reach 73 for two but the dismissal of Ryan Watson in the 23rd over sparked their collapse as Bangladesh unleashed the spinning expertise of Abdul Razzak and Mohammed Rafique on their opponents. 

With the duo combining to take five wickets, Whatmore believes the spinning wickets in the Caribbean and the results over the past week will hold his team in good stead.

 Zaheer up 10 spots to 27th

Dubai: Indias left-arm seamer Zaheer Khan has jumped ten places to 27th position in the latest LG ICC ODI rankings. Another Indian pacer Munaf Patel leaped eight spots to 39th to record his career best haul of rating points. 

Zaheer was rewarded for his match-winning five for 42 against Sri Lanka in Margoa on Wednesday while Munaf gained substantially following his consistent performance. 

Mahendra Singh Dhoni, moved up one place to third-place off the back of his unbeaten 67 to secure victory over Sri Lanka on Wednesday. 

Dhoni is now one rating point behind Ponting and if he produces another such innings in the final match of the series, he can bag the second spot. 

Michael Hussey of Australia is still leading the batting table while South Africas Shaun Pollock heads both the bowling and allrounder charts.

 Task cut out for Team India

 - Flintoff asked to be ready to lead 

 Manchester: A sloppy India have plenty of problem areas to sort out as they go into the fourth one-dayer against England here Thursday, fully aware that another defeat could tilt the balance heavily in favour of the hosts. 

The Indians, trailing the seven-match series 1-2, have been a pale shadow of themselves and Rahul Dravids men would need a huge slice of inspiration to restore parity in a series which has thoroughly exposed their fielding and bowling shortcomings. 

Fielding has been the biggest worry for the Indians who have not only spilled catches but have also been pathetic in ground fielding and throwing. It is an area which needs drastic improvement if the visitors entertain hopes of winning the series. 

Clearly, the Indians have their tasks cut out for the day-night encounter at the Old Trafford where the conditions would again suit the batsmen. 

The Indians would also have to give a serious thought to their team composition and batting order for the crucial game. 

The team management has opted to go in with five specialist bowlers in the last two games but the strategy has not really paid dividends as England have managed to pile up big scores. 

With no genuine allrounder in the team, the five-bowler theory has weakened the batting considerably as was evident in the last match in Birmingham where India lost their last five wickets for just 29 runs. 

The Indians will also have to find the right person to bat at the vital No. 3 slot. Gautam Gambhir, Yuvraj Singh and Dinesh Karthik have been tried out in that position in the matches so far but without much success. It remains to be seen who will bat in that position Thursday. 

There were problems for England, too. Struck by a stomach bug, captain Paul Collingwood is a doubtful starter at Old Trafford. Andrew Flintoff could lead England in case Collingwood is out of the game. 

Talking to reporters on the eve of the match at Old Trafford, Flintoff said he was asked to be ready to lead the side even though the allrounder exuded confidence that Collingwood would recover in time. 

Hes said if he has to go off then I will take over. But after that, there is nothing that has really been discussed and, as I say, we are expecting Paul to play, Flintoff said. 

Flintoff lost vice captaincy in the West Indies after the embarrassing Fredalo episode, where he, along with a few teammates were found in a rocking boat in the wee hours. 

England does not boast of a great one-day record but Flintoff felt things were finally looking bright for the side. 

Asked about his fitness, the allrounder said, Ive come through my training session. Ive bowled, batted and done what I need to, and hopefully it doesnt flare up and I can get on with it tomorrow.

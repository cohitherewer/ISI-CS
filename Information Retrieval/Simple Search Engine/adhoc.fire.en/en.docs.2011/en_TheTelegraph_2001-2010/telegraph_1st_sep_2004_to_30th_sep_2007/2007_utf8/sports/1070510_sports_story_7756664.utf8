 USPGA Tour Randhawas next target

 Jyoti Randhawa 

Gurgaon: Having made his mark at the Asian and European Tour, ace Indian golfer Jyoti Randhawa has set his sights on American shores and is aiming to qualify for the PGA Tour next year. 

The 34-year-old, who has had five top-10 finishes in the European Tour, is planning to cut down on his Asian Tour appearances to realise his dream of clinching a European title this year and eventually move to the US. 

I have limited myself to Europe now. That means I will not participate in the Asian Tour beyond eight or nine tournaments. I plan to play 20 to 25 events in Europe, said Randhawa, who is here to play the PGTI DLF Masters, said. 

I have been trying to win a European title for the past three-four years and hope to realise my dream soon, he added. 

By the end of the year, I want to qualify for the US Tour through the qualifying school. But personally, Europe is very special. The culture and history makes you feel so much at home.

 Topalov beats Sasi to title

 Topalov 

Sofia: Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran had to be content with a shared second-place finish after going down to former world champion Veselin Topalov in the 10th and final round of the Mtel Masters on Sunday. 

The title was there for the Indian GMs taking as he led the field from the start of the second half. 

A draw in the final round would have sufficed, but he succumbed after a hard-fought struggle with the Bulgarian GM. 

Topalovwon the title on home turf for the third time on the trot. He ended with 5.5 points. 

The Indian along with Gata Kamsky (US), Shakhriyar Mamedyarov (Azerbaijan) and Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu (Romania) finished on five points each. 

Sasikiran played the Nimzo Indian defence with black pieces. 

 Topalov went for a piece sacrifice in the ensuing queen and minor pieces endgame and caught Sasikiran off guard. 

With the clock ticking away, the Indian failed to spot the best defence and made the wrong queen retreat which cost him the game after 59 moves.

 Great to have Becks back, says Terry

Watford: David Beckham and Michael Owen return to an England squad which is balancing a glamour friendly against Brazil at the new Wembley Stadium on Friday with a must-win qualifier at Estonia next week. 

Beckham has been called up for the first time under coach Steve McClaren, who dumped him after last years World Cup. 

Owen has recovered from a knee injury and brings much-needed experience to an England front line missing the suspended Wayne Rooney. Midfielder Joe Cole also returns after numerous injuries. 

Theres different reasons why we have been away, but we have all got the same reasons for being back, Owen said Thursday. 

England captain John Terry said Beckhams return meant the team was back to normal. 

Terry became skipper after Beckham relinquished the captaincy following Englands loss to Portugal in a penalty shootout in the quarter finals of the World Cup in Germany. 

Its great to have him back, Terry said. Hes a familiar face and we know his quality. Hes brought that into training and we are looking forward to him playing. 

The form he has been in has been exceptional since he came back from injury, Terry said. It could not go unnoticed and the manager has brought him back in and rightly so. 

England have only defeated Brazil three times in 21 games dating back to 1956 and the last win was seven games ago in 1990. Their last meeting was at the World Cup quarter finals in Japan in 2002, when Brazil won 2-1. 

The Brazilians are using this match and a friendly on Tuesday against Turkey in Dortmund as warm-ups for the Copa America next month in Venezuela. Ronaldinho and Kaka wont be at that tournament, but are very much in the in the squad for the friendlies. 

For me, the pair of them are the best in the world and a danger to any team, said Robinho, who plays at Madrid with Beckham. I expect an open match with many goals. We have an excellent team and the magic of Brazil is better than the physical power of England. 

England also have one eye on the European Championship qualifier at Estonia on Wednesday. 

England are fourth in Group E with 11 points from six games. Croatia lead the group with 13 points, followed by Israel and Russia with 11 and only the top two teams qualify for the tournament in Austria and Switzerland next year. 

The standings will change on Saturday, when Russia host Andorra, Israel are at Macedonia and Croatia travel to Estonia.

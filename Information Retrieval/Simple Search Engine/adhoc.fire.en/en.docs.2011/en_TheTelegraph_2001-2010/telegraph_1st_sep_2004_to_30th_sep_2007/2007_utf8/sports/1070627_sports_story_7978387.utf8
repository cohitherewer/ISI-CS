 Dad lets out Serenas injury secret

Wimbledon: When Serena Williams talked about her chances of winning a third Wimbledon title, she never mentioned anything about an injury. 

She didnt count on her father revealing that shes not 100 per cent fit. 

Im going to have to talk to my dad. Ill probably let him slide this time, Serena said. 

Serena reluctantly acknowledged that she has been receiving treatment for what she called a tight hamstring, which may explain her erratic start in her first-round match at the All England Club on Monday. 

Serena was down 4-5 in the first set, spraying unforced errors and looking out of sorts. She managed to lift her game and win eight straight games to beat Lourdes Dominguez Lino of Spain 7-5, 6-0. 

Its good she got through the match, but it looks like shes playing a little hurt. I dont think she should be playing. I told her she shouldnt, her father and coach Richard said after watching the match. 

Then, with a laugh, he added: Youll have to ask her about what the injury is or I might lose my job for talking. 

On Saturday, Serena said she and her sister, three-time champion Venus, were healthy and ready to go. When told of her fathers remarks, she wasnt enthused about discussing the ailment and gave few details. 

Its doing okay. Im just taking it a day at time. Its flared up, but getting better slowly but surely. 

Pressed on how it could affect her tournament, the eight-time major Grand Slam winner said: Im hoping and praying it will get better in time. Its gotten better since Ive been getting treatment. 

Serena didnt think the leg problem affected her serve, even though she served six double-faults. Honestly, I did feel a little limited. But I think if things had been tougher, I would have fought through it. 

I raised my game on some points, which I think was the big difference. Out of a 10, I was probably at a 2, maybe. 

The state of her fitness will surely be of interest to her main title rivals. That includes top-seeded Justine Henin, who beat Argentine qualifier Jorgelina Cravero. (AP)

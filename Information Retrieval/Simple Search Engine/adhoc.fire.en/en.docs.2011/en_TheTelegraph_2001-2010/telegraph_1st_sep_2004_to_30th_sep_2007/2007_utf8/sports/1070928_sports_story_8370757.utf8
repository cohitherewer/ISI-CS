The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dhonis calm from outside, very aggressive within

 - Whoever performs is going to play... Its not a question of being a senior or a junior, says former Team India captain Sourav 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Bangalore: Dada, six sixes baki raha... Yaad rakhna is how former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly was greeted here on Thursday morning. 

The fan, whod apparently come on another flight which landed around the same time as Souravs Jet service from Calcutta, was actually echoing an across-the-country sentiment following our World Twenty20 success in South Africa. 

That Sourav played no part in the campaign isnt of relevance. Bottomline today is that the expectations from all wearing the India colours have risen sky high. 

Sourav, who spoke to The Telegraph during the two-and-a-half hour Calcutta-Bangalore flight, is of course aware of that. 

The following are excerpts 

On the euphoria generated by the World Twenty20 win 

It was expected... I suppose theres more joy because we didnt do well in the World Cup earlier in the year... The boys have excelled and deserve to be feted. (Adds laughing) The only time I took a ride in an open bus was in Belfast, earlier in the summer. But it was so cold that I had to quickly take shelter in the covered deck. 

On whether the title has, to an extent, reduced his disappointment of having lost the 2003 World Cup final (in South Africa) to Australia 

Oh, yes... It has made all of us feel good... Losing a final can crush you... Its not just the 2003 World Cup, the disappointment of having lost the mini-World Cup final to New Zealand in 2000 (actually, the ICC KnockOut in Nairobi) still rankles... 

On whether he regrets having made himself unavailable for the World Twenty20 

Absolutely. 

On whether seniors like him will now be under more pressure from youngsters 

Whoever performs is going to play... Its not a question of being a senior or a junior. 

On whether hed expected an India versus Pakistan final 

No... Id thought Australia would surely be one finalist... Because of the amount of Twenty20 played in England, Id expected (Paul) Collingwoods team to do well too. 

On Mahendra Singh Dhoni as captain 

Hes done very well... Hes calm from the outside, but very aggressive within... I like his body language... Dhoni captained well in pressure situations and, yes, I liked his bowling changes. 

On whether, being a former captain, hes obliged to make Dhoni (captain in the ODIs as well) feel comfortable in the dressing room 

I dont think its necessary to really say or do something special... Dhoni has played with Sachin (Tendulkar), Rahul (Dravid) and me for almost three years... He knows us and we know him... 

On whether he would have given the finals last over to Joginder Sharma 

I wouldnt have given it to Harbhajan (Singh) as, in that kind of a situation, its easier to go after a spinner... So, my answer is yes. 

On Misbah-ul Haq being crucified for the finals last hit 

Perhaps, he ought to have waited for a couple of balls, but then pressure does funny things. Obviously, he felt the need to try and finish it off quickly... In a tight situation, you need to have strong nerves. Otherwise... 

On whether the pace of the Twenty20 game makes captaining tough 

Look, because of the duration, youre always in the game... Dhonis real test will be in the ODIs... 

On Dhonis comment that small town boys are tougher mentally and physically than the cricketers living in metros 

Im not sure in what context he said that... Till I get to know, I wouldnt like to react. 

On Yuvraj Singh, regarded as one of his boys early on, being in such superb form 

As captain, I backed Yuvraj because of his ability... Its not about being somebodys boy or not being somebodys boy... Hes doing very well because he has ability. Im happy for him. 

On the most improved Indian cricketers this year 

Rudra Pratap Singh and Sreesanth... RP has been outstanding... He has grown in confidence and thats reflected in the quality of his bowling... As for Sreesanth, he has been brilliant. He should be judged on his bowling, not by his behaviour. 

On Team Indias chances in the seven-match ODI series against world champions Australia which begins on Saturday 

Very good... Whatever the form of cricket, weve been playing exceedingly well over the past few months... Then, Glenn McGrath has retired and Mike Hussey isnt available because of injury... Also, theres a question mark over (Ricky) Ponting being available for all matches. 

Finally, a year ago, where did he expect to be now 

(Smiles) Cricket is unpredictable... I was then determined to come back but, frankly, didnt know where I would be in 12 months...

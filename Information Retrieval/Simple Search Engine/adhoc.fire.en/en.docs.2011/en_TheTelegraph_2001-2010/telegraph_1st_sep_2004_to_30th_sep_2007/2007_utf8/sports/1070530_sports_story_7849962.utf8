 Sachin back in top-20

A STAFF REPORTER

 Sachin Tendulkar 

Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar is back in the top 20 of the LG ICC players rankings for Test batsmen after a memorable trip to Bangladesh. 

The 34-year-old scored a century in each match, in Chittagong and Dhaka, compiling a total of 254 runs at an average of 127. This marks a significant return to form for the Little Master as he gained six places to jump to 15th spot in the rankings, according to an ICC release. 

Now with a total of 672 ratings points, Sachin has Stephen Fleming of New Zealand and Englands Paul Collingwood in his sights, although he is a long way off his own career-best rating of 898 set in 2002. It was a good series for Indias bowlers too with Anil Kumble moving up to third place. 

Kumble is now level with South Africas Shaun Pollock. 

Meanwhile, Kevin Pietersens maiden double century against the West Indies has catapulted the English batsman to an Elite club of Test batsmen with more than 900 rating points. 

Pietersen became 21st batsman of all time to pass the 900-point mark in rankings to join, among others, Sir Don Bradman.

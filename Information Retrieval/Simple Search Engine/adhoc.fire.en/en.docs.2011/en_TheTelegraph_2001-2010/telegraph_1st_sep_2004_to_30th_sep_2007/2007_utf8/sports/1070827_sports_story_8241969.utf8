 Better to treat this as a 5-game series

 - England will be on backfoot if Flintoff doesnt play: Dhoni

Birmingham: Mahendra Singh Dhoni feels its better to treat the ongoing ODI series as a five-game affair. 

Its a 1-1 situation now Though there are seven games, its better to think this is a five-game series, said the Team India vice-captain at a press conference here on the eve of the third match versus England. 

We have been batting and bowling well, just that we have struggled a bit on the field. But we are working on our fielding looking to attack the ball and give less time to the batsmen, said Dhoni. 

The wicketkeeper-batsman added that the mood was good in the dressing room and the confidence high. 

The fact that Andrew Flintoff was a doubtful starter was also being seen as a positive. Describing him as a perfect allrounder, Dhoni said: If he is not playing, the England team will be slightly on the backfoot. 

He has lifted them a lot (since returning from an injury lay-off). He is the kind of player who always has an impact on the game. In one-day cricket he is the perfect allrounder, the swashbuckling Dhoni said. 

Flintoff had hurt his right knee after crashing into the boundary hoardings in Bristol on Friday. A scan revealed inflammation in the knee and the England team management is keeping options open for Mondays game. Jon Lewis has been drafted into the squad as Flintoffs cover. 

Dhoni said the success of spin Piyush Chawla and Ramesh Powar has given India more options in bowling. 

Our strength is spinners and they always come up with good performances, Dhoni said. 

When the ball turns, its a bit of worry for the England batsmen. It is not that they dont play spin well, but at times the pressure builds up. It is not easy to clear the field against our spinners, said Dhoni.

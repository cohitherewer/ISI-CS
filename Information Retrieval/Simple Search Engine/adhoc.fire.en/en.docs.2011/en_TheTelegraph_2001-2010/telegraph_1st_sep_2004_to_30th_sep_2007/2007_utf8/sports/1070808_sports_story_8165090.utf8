 Robin not fit to be Indias fielding coach: Bedi

 Bishan Singh Bedi 

New Delhi: Former captain Bishan Singh Bedi feels the current Indian teams fielding is quite ordinary despite having a specialist coach in Robin Singh. 

The fielding standard of the current side is no better than what it used to be during my playing days despite having a specialist to improve things, Bedi said. 

When you have a fielding coach, you would expect the team to be nice and trim but he (Robin Singh) is the fattest of them all. 

I am not trying to insult him. I admit that he was one of the finest fielders we had, but he is not fit to be Indias fielding coach, he added. 

Bedi said G.R. Vishwanath was the all-time best Indian batsman and only Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman came close to be as good as him. 

In terms of aesthetics, Vishwanath is the best Indian batsman of all time. He was an artist. Sunil Gavaskar, in my opinion, was just an accumulator of runs. 

Regarding the Indian Cricket League (ICL), Bedi felt the BCCIs opposition to it is grounded in its fear of being exposed as an inefficient organisation. 

The BCCI cannot ban players for playing in the league. Suppose you are working for a company and join another after some time, your former employers cannot stop you from earning your livelihood. Thats illegal, Bedi said on the sidelines of a book release function here on Monday. 

Cricket is not their personal property and they have no right to stop anybody from joining this league. Actually the board is scared that if the ICL turns out to be a well organised event, their own failures would be exposed, he added. 

Bedi felt though the ICL organisers are only trying to mint money out of the countrys obsession with cricket, players cannot be barred from being a part of the league. 

I dont think it is something on the lines of the Kerry Packer series, so there should not be any objection in the first place. I dont know whether this league would be good for the game in the long run but there is no harm in allowing it to take place. 

Bedi also came out in support of National Cricket Academy chairman Kapil Dev. 

I dont think it would be appropriate to take away his job on this ground, he said. The former captain, however, made it clear that he would not become a part of the ICL. 

I will not join the ICL for the simple reason that I dont think I would be able to fit into this bunch of vultures, he remarked. 

Speaking on recent incidents such as the Jelly Bean controversy and pacer Sreesanths antics in the second Test against England, Bedi said the menace had become rampant and Indians were no lambs when it came to having a go at the opponents. 

Cricketers may be perceived as demi-gods but let me assure you, most of them are pretty daft at sledging. The Indians are no lambs, he said. 

He criticised Team India captain Rahul Dravid for trying to cover up for Greg Chappell after the Australians obscene finger gesture to fans in Calcutta last year. 

Chappell was being booed rightly on that occasion. When I asked Rahul about the entire episode, he said Chappell was only showing an injured finger. I told him dont defend an act which was an insult to the entire nation, Bedi recalled. 

The former captain also took a dig at the ICC, saying chuckers such as Muttiah Muralidharan are monsters who are killing the game. 

That man (Muralidharan) is the best shot-putter in the history of cricket. People like him are just killing the game, Bedi said.

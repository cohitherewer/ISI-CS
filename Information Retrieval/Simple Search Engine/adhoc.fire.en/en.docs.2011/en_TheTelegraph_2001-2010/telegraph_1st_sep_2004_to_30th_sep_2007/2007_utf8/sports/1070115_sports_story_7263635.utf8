 Anand outwits Motylev

 - WIJK AAN ZEE Meet 

 Negi defeated Dutchman Spoelman in Round I 

Wijk Aan Zee (The Netherlands): Viswanathan Anand displayed his best defensive resources to beat two-time Russian champion Alexander Motylev in the second round of Group A of the Corus Chess Tournament here. 

It turned out to be an excellent day for Anand after a cautious first round in the category-19 super tournament. 

Teimou Radjabov of Azerbaijan was trying to convert his material advantage into a full point against Sergei Karjakin of Ukraine to retain sole lead that he held after the first round with victory over Loek van Wely of Holland. 

Interestingly enough, Anands arch-rivals in the event top seed Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria and world champion Vladimir Kramnik of Russia also scored emphatic victories against Van Wely and Alexei Shirov of Spain respectively, to maintain their placing at par with Anand in this 14-players round robin tournament. 

Anand really had to pull himself together for the game against motylev who is making his debut in the a group of this elite event. 

Playing black, the Indian ace was up against the most dangerous variation against his Sicilian Najdorf and showed great defensive acumen to keep white forces at bay. 

Motylev continued in his search for an elusive advantage with repeated attacking manoeuvres against Anands king but the Indian was always one up in defence, finding out the best resources in quick time. 

Anand won in just 31 moves. 

Meanwhile in Group C, being held simultaneously, worlds youngest GM Parimarjan Negi drew his second-round game with Stellan Brynell of Sweden in the second round. It may be recalled that Parimarjan had won his first game in great style against IM Wouter Spoelman of Holland. 

Earlier, against Ruslan Ponomariov, Anand showcased his deep preparation in Catalan opening, leaving the Ukrainian with little chance to fight for an advantage in the game which lasted just 22 moves. 

On a day when caution was the name of the game, Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan turned out to be the sole winner, defeating Van Wely in a finely crafted game. 

The other six games of the day ended in draws resulting in Radjabov emerging as the sole leader in this category-19 event played on a round robin basis between 14 players.

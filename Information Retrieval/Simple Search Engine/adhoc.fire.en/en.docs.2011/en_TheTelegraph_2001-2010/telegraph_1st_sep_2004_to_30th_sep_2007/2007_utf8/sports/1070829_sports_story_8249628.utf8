The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dora survives scare

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) refused to finish their Sahara CFL Premier Division match with Peerless on Tuesday, protesting the absence of a doctor at the Mohun Bagan ground when goalkeeper Prasanta Dora lost consciousness. 

Referee Udayan Haldar later declared the match abandoned. The IFA league sub-committee will decide on the fate of the match. 

Pandemonium reigned supreme when in the 16th minute Dora collapsed following a collision with Peerless striker Subair Muritala. He was unconscious for sometime. 

With no doctor present, players and match officials rushed to attend to the goalkeeper. Some of them even tried to perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on him, but in vain. 

Under the guidance of match commissioner Kamal Rakshit and CPT coach Amal Datta, Prasanta was taken to SSKM Hospital, where he regained consciousness. 

Datta and his players then refused to continue playing. Haldar waited for another 40 minutes before abandoning the match. At that time, no team had managed to score. 

Im going to send the report to the IFA and its up to them to decide on the fate of the match, Rakshit said. 

Once we get the match commissioners report, appropriate action will be taken, said an IFA official. 

According to hospital sources, Dora was out of danger, but will stay under observation for the next 24 hours. 

Three players previously faced similar situation in the second division, but all survived thanks to the match officials timely intervention. 

Meanwhile, in another Premier Division match, Antony Soren scored the winner for Eastern Railway against George Telegraph at the Mohammedan Sporting ground.

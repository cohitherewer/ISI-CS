 Beleaguered England brace up for crucial tie

 - TRI-SERIES clash versus New Zealand

Perth: England could be without three key players for Tuesdays must-win tri-series match against New Zealand at the WACA. 

Fast bowlers James Anderson and Jon Lewis will both miss the ODI because of niggling injuries while captain Michael Vaughan remains doubtful with a hamstring problem. 

Englands stand-in skipper Andrew Flintoff said a final decision on Vaughan would not be made until the day of the match but the signs were not encouraging. 

There is a doubt surrounding Vaughans fitness, Flintoff said on Monday. Hes done some running today but I think a final decision will be made in the morning. 

The absence of all three players would be a massive blow to Englands chances of beating a New Zealand team that is brimming with confidence after suddenly finding form. 

The Black Caps thrashed England by 90 runs in Adelaide last week and then smashed 335 for five against Australia in an eight-run loss on Sunday. 

Another defeat against New Zealand on Tuesday would leave England needing to win their last two matches, one each against Australia and the New Zealand, just to make the play-offs and salvage something from a disastrous tour. 

I think the one thing now is we cant dance around it, we have got to be honest with ourselves, Flintoff said. 

We have just got to stand up. I could sit here and tell you all types of different things but we have got to score some runs. 

The English have been heavily criticised over their performances on tour, but Vaughan said the players were desperate to make amends. 

When you are getting beat up most days for the whole of the tour, it has to have some kind of effect, Vaughan said. 

I am feeling a group of players who really want to put it right, and I havent heard any of them talking about the plane home or what they are going to do in February. 

New Zealand are set to recall pacers Shane Bond and James Franklin, who missed the previous game. 

Jacob Oram, who on Sunday hit the fastest century by a New Zealander, had been spurred by comment in an Australian paper. 

He was irked by one of the papers calling him a poor mans Chris Cairns, Fleming said. That really spurred him, surprisingly, because he is a fine player. He can strike the ball as well as anyone in world cricket. 

The towering allrounder made 86 against England in Adelaide last week and then smashed his maiden ODI century against the Australians at the WACA on Sunday, making 101 not out. 

Oram, who averages just a fraction under 40 with the bat in Tests, took just 71 balls to reach his century and cleared the fence six times in the process. 

Fleming conceded Oram was yet to regain his best form with the ball, but expressed confidence that his bowling will improve as he plays more games and will further strengthen the team. 

Wed like a little more with the ball and that would give us more options in terms of the two spinners, he said. But with the bat, and his off-field contribution, it is great to have him back.

 Left high n dry

- Absece of Pakistan trio and Aussie star sure to take some sheen off cricket's showpiece event 

Had they been fit to play, they could have made one hell of a difference not just to the teams who would be missing them, but also to crickets quadrennial showpiece. The 2007 edition would be a lot poorer sans two of this planets fastest bowlers, one premier allrounder and a very accurate mediumpacer. This motley crew would have added an extra dimension with their contrasting personalities and ability to make rival batsmen hop and skip. While a sore ankle kept Australias Brett Lee out, dope-tainted Pakistani pace duo Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif had to sit out with a troubled knee and a dubious elbow, respectively. Abdul Razzaq, the fourth on this unhappy list, was also sidelined with a knee injury. Though the Australians have recouped somewhat with 24-year-old quick Shaun Tait shaping up well (he bagged four for 33 off 8.3 overs in a warm-up match against England), Pakistan are likely to be hit hard without the services of their three premier players. 

Brett Lee (Australia) 

Mere stats wont reveal the true nature of Lees importance to the Australian side. Taking over the pace spearhead mantle from fearsome senior pro Glenn McGrath is no childs play, and it wasnt one for Australian crickets pin-up boy. One of the fastest bowlers in the world along with contemporaries Shoaib Akhtar, Shaun Tait and Shane Bond, Lees Test debut was in December 1999 against the Indians at the MCG. He bowled first-change and finished with dream figures of five for 47, including the wickets of Sadagopan Ramesh and Rahul Dravid. He took 40 wickets in his opening three series, helping him bag Australias inaugural Sir Donald Bradman Young Player of the Year Award in 2000. 

In one-day Internationals, Lee debuted against Pakistan on January 9, 2000, in Brisbane. ICCs No. 1 ODI bowler in January 2006, Lee achieved a hattrick against Kenya in the 2003 World Cup. But sticking to facts would be akin to missing the real point. When Lee starts his run-up, batsmen find a familiar shiver rolling down their spines and fans catch their breath in anticipation. The leaping action may produce a toe-crunching yorker, a devilish slower ball or a fast outswinger. Hes got style, too. Peroxide hair, a trademark post-wicket-celebration leap, a pop group (Six and Out), and you have a designer fast bowler straight out of the books of Milans High Street. 

Lees 2007 World Cup dream came crashing down when on February 23 this year he was ruled out with an ankle injury sustained earlier in the week during a training session. Australia would miss his athletic fielding, more-than-useful late-order contributions and searing pace. 

Shoaib Akhtar (Pakistan) 

What can you say within a limited space about world crickets enfant terrible? The kid who refuses to grow up. The screaming Rawalpindi Express, who lives his life just like his bowling in the fast lane. Pakistan will miss him, for sure, and so will his countless fans. The quick with a cult-following in the subcontinent had been ruled out with an injury, so said the PCB. But even in his absence he has made more headlines than his ilk who are in the Caribbean. 

Shoaibs Test debut was against the West Indies in 1997 and on March 28, 1998, he made his ODI debut against Zimbabwe in Harare. But his first brush with the big stage came during the 1999 World Cup in England. A long bustling run-up coupled with express speed, a great mop of hair, a talent for show-boating and an extravagant lifestyle soon made a star out of Shoaib, but controversy and injuries were always just a stones throw away. A huge ego and a blind ambition to break the 100mph barrier seemed to matter more to him than cementing his place in the Pakistan XI. In November 2006, he copped a two-year ban for testing positive for the banned drug nandrolone. Teammate and partner-in-crime Asif was handed a one-year ban. The suspensions were later lifted (much to the displeasure of the World Anti-Doping Agency and ICC) on appeal, but it left another deep scar in his controversial CV. 

On March 1, Shoaib and Asif were ruled out of the World Cup minutes before the Pakistan squad was to depart for the West Indies. The team management and the PCB said the injuries, which both had picked up during Pakistans tour of South Africa this year, were too severe to risk inclusion in the Caribbean-bound flight. Interestingly, the move came as ICC CEO Malcolm Speed said that the duo would have been subjected to target tests in the Caribbean. Whatever may be the case, Pakistan are sure to miss the services of their most controversial but highly talented star. 

Mohammed Asif (Pakistan) 

Depending more on his accurate line and length rather than raw pace, the profoundly-talented Mohammed Asif is the latest addition to Pakistans chequered list of enigmatic personalities. During his debut against Australia at Sydney in January 2005, he was plain ordinary, bowling 18 overs without a wicket. However, coach Bob Woolmer said Asif was the most improved player in the country in late 2005. By taking 10 wickets in a warm-up game against England, he proved Woolmer right. He made an impressive ODI debut against England in Rawalpindi, 2005. Never flamboyant, the lean and hungry Asif is always on cruise control mode. He has a sharp brain, good stamina and the ability to seam the ball both ways on most pitches. Touted by the iconic Imran Khan as a possible great in the making, Asif had everything going for him. But this is just when the script went a little awry. 

On October 16, 2006, Asif was suspended by the PCB along with Shoaib and was pulled out from the Champions Trophy after the duo failed drug tests for nandrolone. He was subsequently banned by the PCB on November 1, 2006, for a year and acquitted in December. After a long period of speculation over his (and Shoaibs) availability for the World Cup, both were finally ruled out on March 1 for failing to recover from injury. The promising Asif would have lent a cutting edge to Pakistans bowling attack in the mega event. 

Abdul Razzaq (Pakistan) 

Ask Sachin Tendulkar. One of the greatest batsmen of our times will tell you how often that sharp in-cutter has disturbed his timber or found an errant leg before the stumps. Ask Glenn McGrath what a lethal Abdul Razzaq can do with the bat. Misfortune struck Razzaq when a knee injury during a practice session at the Gaddafi Stadium ruled him out of what would have been his third World Cup appearance. 

Without the flamboyance or the swagger of a Shoaib Akhtar or a Brett Lee, Razzaq is more than a handful with his galloping run-up, accuracy and incisive reverse swing. But he is more lethal as a batsman in the lower order with a strike rate of over 80 in ODIs, making him as good an allrounder as any. He boasts of a prodigious array of strokes and is particularly strong driving through cover and mid-off, both off front and backfoot. His method is very simple block or blast. 

After making his ODI debut against Zimbabwe in Lahore in November 1996, Razzaq suffered a period of slump in bowling. Lately, he was showing signs of regaining top form. During Pakistans Test win over India in Karachi in January last year, Razzaq gave ample display of his abilities with a timely 45 and 90, along with a match haul of seven wickets. Pakistan will surely miss this utility cricketer in Calypso land.

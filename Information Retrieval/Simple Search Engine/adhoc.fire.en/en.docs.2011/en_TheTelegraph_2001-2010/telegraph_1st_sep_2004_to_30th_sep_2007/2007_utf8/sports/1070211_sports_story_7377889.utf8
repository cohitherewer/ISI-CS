The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Injury woes continue to plague India

Rajkot: After the washout at Eden Gardens, India and Sri Lanka go into the second one-dayer of the Hero Honda Cup here on Sunday, with the home team still grappling with injury worries. 

The three injured players Yuvraj Singh, Irfan Pathan and Ajit Agarkar who had to sit out of the first match had still not recovered fully and were doubtful starters for the day match at the Madhavrao Scindia Stadium. 

In view of the injuries, the Indian team management would wait till Sunday to decide on the playing XI for the match which is of vital importance to Virender Sehwag and paceman Munaf Patel who need to prove their form and fitness ahead of the World Cup team selection on Monday. 

Yuvraj has been down with a sore back, while Pathan had still not recovered from a sore shoulder. Agarkar, down with flu, was still weak though he did take part in the practice session. 

Among the trio, Agarkar has a better chance of playing. He bowled a few overs at the nets, but looked a little flat, captain Rahul Dravid said. 

It will be a test of character for the out-of-form Sehwag, who was recalled into the team after being dropped for the series against the West Indies, as he gets just one opportunity to impress the selectors who meet in Mumbai on Monday to finalise Indias 15-member World Cup squad. 

The selectors would also keep a close watch on players ridden with injuries as fitness issues have been a major cause of worry for the team of late. 

Rain seems to be following the teams, however, with even Rajkot experiencing a smart shower for 15 minutes on Saturday. If there are any more spells, then it is debatable whether the match will start on time on Sunday. 

For India, the major plus point in the rained out tie in Calcutta was the bowling of lanky right arm pacer Munaf Patel who was close to his best form after having struggled with an ankle injury for the major part of the South African tour. 

Patel bowled at a good pace to and picked up two wickets to impress the team management. The bowler finished with impressive figures of two for 25 from seven overs while the other two pacers Zaheer Khan and Sreesanth were mauled by Sri Lankan opener Sanath Jayasuriya. 

Sreesanth continued his wayward ways by conceding 36 from 4.2 overs after his disappointing show in the previous series against the West Indies, which could be a point of concern for the selectors. If Agarkar is available, he is expected to replace Sreesanth in the bowling attack. 

Interestingly the only bowler to have taken four wickets at this normally high-scoring venue, left arm pacer Rudra Pratap Singh, is out of the selectors radar for now. 

The new-look Indian opening combination of Sourav Ganguly and Robin Uthappa is set to continue while the Indian middle order looks very formidable with the return to form of Sachin Tendulkar and the solidity of skipper Dravid to weather any kind of storm. 

Harbhajan Singh, the lone frontline spinner picked in the Eden playing XI, is expected to perform the same role here too on what seems to be a perfect batting pitch prepared by curator Rasik Makwana. 

The team batting first would score over 300, said Makwana, indicating perhaps that the team which wins the toss is almost certain to bat first. 

Like Manoj Tewari in Calcutta, the Saurashtra Cricket Association has kept two of its Ranji players on standby to do duty as 12th man.

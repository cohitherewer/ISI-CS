The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Officials need to be professionals first

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: After Joseph Blatters plain talking, it is introspection time for the clubs. 

The Fifa president called for putting in place a proper technical and administrative infrastructure after his visit to the three big clubs of the Maidan as well as the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. 

Asian Football Confederation boss Mohamed bin Hammam went a step further by warning that India should not dream of playing the World Cup in the next 100 years with the existing structure. 

With the Professional League set to start next season and a Fifa windfall on the cards following Blatters visit, its high time we seized the opportunity with both hands. 

The officials frequent interference in team selection has long been the bane of Indian football. The leading clubs are being run by officials with vested interests who are hardly aware of players basic needs. 

Of the Big Three clubs, only East Bengal president Dr Pranab Dasgupta is based in the city. Swapan Sadhan Bose and M.J. Akbar, the Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting heads, operate from Dubai and New Delhi, respectively. 

In the captains absence, one wonders how the ship can be guided to its desired direction. 

So, are we ready to take this opportunity, post-Blatter visit? 

The Telegraph spoke to a number of former India players and coaches on Monday, who were unanimous in the view that professionalism must cover the entire spectrum of the game, from players to officials. 

India is a sleeping giant. But if we want a revolution, it cant be realised only through emotions. There has to be a whole-hearted effort to put a professional system in place everywhere. I would say people who run the game here need to be professionals more than the players, the legendary P.K. Banerjee pointed out. 

Subhas Bhowmick, a former India forward and a successful club coach, echoed similar thoughts. 

You cant think of professionalism with amateur people at the helm of affairs. The board of directors who run club football here must include technical people and those who are aware of sports management, Bhowmick remarked. 

Syed Nayeemuddin is of the same opinion. 

You have to develop the game at the grassroots level. But we need to have paid people in our talent search programmes, he said from Dhaka. 

Both PK and Nayeem, however, feel that the absence of club presidents is not a major issue. 

Subrata Bhattacharya, another successful coach, talked of the clash of power between coaches and officials. A coach is supposed to take care of the team while an official should concentrate on developing the game. But the game is hardly run this way, he rued. 

Involvement of more technical people in the administration is needed. Unfortunately, the club management here lacks transparency and most of the officials behave like autocrats, former Mohun Bagan coach said. 

He has a supporter in Aloke Mukherjee. I can tell you from a coachs perspective that most officials want us to be their yes-men. They can allow you to stay as long as you toe their line, Mukherjee, a former India left-back, said.

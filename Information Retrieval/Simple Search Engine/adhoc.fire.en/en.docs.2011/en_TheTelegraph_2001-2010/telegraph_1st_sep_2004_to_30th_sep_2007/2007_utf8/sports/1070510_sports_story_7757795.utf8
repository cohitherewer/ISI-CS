 Good we now get respect from opposition: Bashar

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Dhaka: Bangladesh are bound to feel the pressure with the burden of expectation soaring following their World Cup performance. On the eve of their first home series after the quadrennial showpiece in the West Indies, Bangladesh coach, captain and vice-captain shared their views with the media. 

The following are excerpts 

DAV WHATMORE 

On the motivation factor 

Motivation is never a problem with this Bangladesh team. After the World Cup, we moved up one place in rankings and now weve the opportunity to move up even further. 

On Bangladeshs chances 

Weve a slight advantage, but the Indian team that has come here is a bit different from the ones weve encountered in the recent past. 

On the absence of Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly from the ODI side 

Whoever the Indian selectors picked have the ability to play at this level. 

On the emotional factor, this being his last series as Bangladesh coach 

Yeah, if you stop and think about it Perhaps one cant help being a little emotional. But Im leaving with more fond memories than bad ones. 

On Mashrafe Mortazas back problem 

He will be given every opportunity to prove his fitness before the match. 

On the number of youngsters in the Bangladesh team 

They are all a product of what is happening below the level of International cricket. Theres a good academy structure in place and theres also the A team. 

HABIBUL BASHAR 

On the pressure element 

Pressure is always there when you are playing at home. It may be a little more this time because of our performance in the World Cup. Its good that nowadays Bangladesh get respect from the opposition. I love this sort of pressure The pressure to win. 

On Mortazas injury 

Hes an important player in our ranks. Were not just focusing on Thursdays match but the rest of the series. Also we must not forget that our back up players are not bad. 

On India deciding to rest Sachin and Sourav 

I dont wish to comment on that. It would be wise to focus on our players and strategies. 

On whether the duos absence will make a difference 

Their absence will surely be felt. But I believe the players picked in their place are good. 

MOHAMMED ASHRAFUL 

On the series 

We can end up losing 0-3, but at the same time can also win it. 

On being set to play his 100th ODI 

Obviously Im happy. But Im treating it as another important match. Not thinking much about personal achievements. 

On his thoughts before his debut as vice-captain 

It means more responsibility. Not much as regards pressure. As for batting, I always look to improve. Ive in the past taken tips from Sachin. 

On the pressure element 

Pressure is bound to be there. It affects everybody but the trick lies in approaching it with a positive outlook.

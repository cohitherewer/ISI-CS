 State permits cellphone use 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: The state government has finally succumbed to corporate pressure, giving the stamp of approval to the use of mobile phones in the city racecourse from Friday. A two-tier tariff has been fixed for users. RCTC will charge Rs 1,500 a day on live race days and a similar amount during the off-course fixtures of premium turf centres. Charges for less popular centres such as Delhi, Hyderabad, Mysore (summer), Chennai and Ooty will be Rs 1,000 per day, said Boman Parakh, secretary, RCTC.

Calcutta: It appears to be a fight between foreigners Mohammedan Sporting have three and Mahindra United two when they meet in their Round V National Football League match at the Barasat Stadium on Saturday. The Calcutta outfit has Prsitan, Eric Mputu and Guy Ndem while Yusif Yakubu and Pomeyieh Mensah will turn out for the Mumbai side. 

Much of Mohammedan Sportings hopes will bank on new Liberian recruit Pristan, who has impressed coach Subhas Bhowmick in a big way. Being basically a left-footed player, Pristan has also got fine touches, Bhowmick said after practice on Friday. 

The black-and-white side has already started thinking about a replacement for suspended Mike Okoro. Now, only time can say whether Pristan will be able to fit into Okoros shoes. 

Mahindra have two men, who will be vested with the job of scoring. Yakubu has nothing to prove and is one of the best foreign recruits of this country, Bhowmick remarked hinting that he will keep both under strict vigil. 

The home side, it seems, will play a cautious game and try to ensure a valuable point. We will first ensure one point and then if opportunity comes, we will go for a win, Bhowmick said. 

Mohammedan Sporting, lurking at the bottom with four points from as many outings, will be without the services of Habibur Rehman Mondal, Noel Wilson and Jatin Bisht all the names figure on the injury list. But it is almost certain that veteran Debjit Ghosh will play as a defensive screen while Surajit Roy will replace Habibur in the defence. Bijen Singh will play upfront with Pritan by his side. 

On the other hand, Mahindra United, at the top of the table with seven points from four matches, would love to have full three points in their kitty after getting the required amount of rest. 

Our boys are fresh and fit and we will depend on the team game tomorrow, Derick Pereira said after the days practice session at Central Park. 

With so much confusion surrounding the NFL fixtures, the two coaches sounded contradictory as to the facilities at the Barasat Stadium. While Bhowmick expressed full satisfaction with the venue, Pereira wasnt happy.

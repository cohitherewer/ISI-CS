The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Port of Spain shadow falls on BCCI meet

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Greg Chappell and Rahul Dravid 

 Calcutta: Team Indias performance in 

 the ongoing World Cup wasnt on the agenda of the Boards 

 working committee meeting in New Delhi on Thursday, but 

 the possibility of an early exit overshadowed just about 

 everything. 

The members collectively expressed concern The topic kept being raised between discussions on what was officially listed, a

 top Board official told The Telegraph late in the evening. 

He added: Members asked whether the five-wicket loss to Bangladesh had anything to do with a lack of preparation or whether the players didnt apply themselves in that opener On the other hand, some wondered whether the shock defeat was actually nothing more than a one-off 

Apparently, individuals werent discussed as any leak would add to the pressure being faced by Rahul Dravid and Co. in Port of Spain. 

Thats the last thing we want. 

According to the top official, some members felt that the Board shouldnt sponsor goodwill delegations if the team didnt make the second round (Super Eight). 

It wont look good if were there and our team is back home, is what they said. 

As of now, the goodwill delegations will comprise one member from each of the affiliated units, with all being sent (in batches) to three Super Eight matches in Barbados. 

Meanwhile, for at least two individuals associated with the team, theres more riding on Fridays face-off against Sri Lanka than a ticket to the Super Eight. 

One is talking of Dravid and coach Greg Chappell. 

While Dravids term finishes with the end of Team Indias campaign in the World Cup, Chappells contract gets over as well. 

Dravid has been captain from October 2005; Chappell came on board in May of that year. 

Before leaving for the West Indies, Chappell had indicated he wasnt averse to an extension, but the Board wont move towards a decision till the World Cup picture is clear. 

Lets see what happens Theres little point speculating at this moment Moreover, our next engagement (tour of Bangladesh) is in May, the top official pointed out. 

As for Dravid, failure to qualify for the Super Eight may compel him to make himself available as an ordinary player only after the World Cup. 

The last time we didnt do well in a World Cup was 1999 and the then captain, Mohammed Azharuddin, was quickly given the boot. 

If the fans wrath after the loss to Bangladesh is any indication, hell will break loose if we cant beat Sri Lanka. 

Many are unlikely to sleep well at the Trinidad Hilton.

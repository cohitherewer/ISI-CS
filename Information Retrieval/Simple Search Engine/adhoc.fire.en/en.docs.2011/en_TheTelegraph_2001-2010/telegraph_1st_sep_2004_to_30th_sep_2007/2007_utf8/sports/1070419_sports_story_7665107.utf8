 HASC stun Mahindra

 Bangalore: A Satheesh Kumar strike in stoppage time helped HASC stun leaders Mahindra United in a National Football League (NFL) match on Wednesday. 

Mahindra United continue to lead the standings with a tally of 26 points from 14 matches, but their gap with Dempo (23 from 13 games) and East Bengal (22 from 14 games) has narrowed. 

In Ludhiana, a brace by Nigerian Edeh Chidi helped JCT beat Air India 3-0. Chidi scored once on either side of half-time, before Sunil Chhetri got a third. JCT now have 23 points, while Air India remained at the sixth place with 17 points. 

On Thursday, Dempo will come up against Churchill Brothers in Margao. Victory will take Dempo within touching distance of Mahindra. (PTI)

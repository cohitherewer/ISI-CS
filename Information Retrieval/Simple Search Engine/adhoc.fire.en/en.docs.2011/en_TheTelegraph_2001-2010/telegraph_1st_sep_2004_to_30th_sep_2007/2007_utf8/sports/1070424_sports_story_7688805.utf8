 Eusebio surgery 

Lisbon: Former Portugal striker Eusebio had surgery to unclog an artery Monday. 

Doctors said an hour-long procedure went well and Eusebio was recovering in intensive care. 

Eusebio, 65, was admitted to a Lisbon hospital Friday after complaining he felt unwell. Doctors said a cartoid artery had narrowed and was reducing the flow of blood to his brain, putting him in danger of a stroke. 

Eusebio da Silva Ferreira, who was born in Mozambique when it was still a Portuguese colony, became known as The Black Panther for his powerful performances in the 1960s for Benfica and Portugal.

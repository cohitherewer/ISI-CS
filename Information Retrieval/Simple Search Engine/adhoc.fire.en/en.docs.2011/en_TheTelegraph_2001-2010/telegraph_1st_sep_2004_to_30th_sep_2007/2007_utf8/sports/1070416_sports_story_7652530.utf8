 Bernard: Edmilson absence helped 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Both East Bengal and Mohun Bagan coaches felt Edmilson Marquess absence in the second-half was the turning point in the match. 

Edmilson sustained a head injury following an aerial clash with Douglas da Silva in the 18th minute. He was taken to the hospital during the break. 

Mohun Bagan coach Bernard Oparanozie said: Edmilsons absence helped us as their attack became weak in the second-half. 

East Bengal coach Roberto Carlos Pereira echoed the same: His injury was a setback for us. Its difficult (to eye championship title) from here on.

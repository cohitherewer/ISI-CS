 India free in April 2008: BCCI

Mumbai: The BCCI has informed the PCB that the Indian team wont be free to take part in the Asia Cup before April 25, 2008. 

We want four to five days adjustment as our series at home against South Africa, comprising three Tests, is likely to end on April 15, 2008, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said on Friday. It can be held after April 25 and spill over into May as they want 15 days to complete it. We are free during that time. 

As things stand at present, the tournament, scheduled to be held in 2006 but had to be put off due to Indias unavailability, is unlikely to be held in April 2007. (PTI)

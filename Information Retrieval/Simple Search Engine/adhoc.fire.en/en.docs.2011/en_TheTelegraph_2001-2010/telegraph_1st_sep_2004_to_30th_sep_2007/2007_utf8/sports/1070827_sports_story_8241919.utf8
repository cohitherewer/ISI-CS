A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Jose Ramirez Barreto was involved in yet another controversy after Mohammedan Sportings Nirapada Mondal accused the Brazilian of slapping him in the players tunnel after the goalless tie at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

The spitting row involving the Mohun Bagan forward and East Bengals Madhab Das is still to be sorted out. 

Barreto threatened me during the match As I was making my way through the tunnel, he slapped me Coming from a player of his stature, its unfortunate, Mondal said later. 

Mohammedan Sporting have lodged an official complaint with match commissioner K. Shankar. 

Barreto alleged Mondal had thrice spat at him on the ground. I only pushed him in the tunnel, the star forward said. 

Shabbir Ali, however, said he did not notice the incident. 

Ali, satisfied with the teams showing, said: I always said the arrival of foreigners would make the difference That is what has happened. 

Mohun Bagan Carlos Roberto Pereira didnt offer any excuses. 

 Our key players didnt play well. Mohammedan Sportings goalie also made a big difference. We were very slow in attack. This happens sometimes But I am confident of winning the title.

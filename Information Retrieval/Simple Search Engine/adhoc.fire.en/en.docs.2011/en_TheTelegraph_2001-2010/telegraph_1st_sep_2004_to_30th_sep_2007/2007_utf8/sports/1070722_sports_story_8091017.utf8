 3 on BCB shortlist

Dhaka: The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has drafted a short-list of three coaches to interview for the job of running the national team. 

They are Australians Jamie Siddons, 43 and John Harmer, 65 and Zimbabwean Dave Houghton, 50, BCB general secretary Mahbub Anam said on Saturday. 

The new coach could be selected in time for the Twenty20 Cricket World Cup in South Africa in September. 

Bangladesh are in need of a coach after Sri Lanka-born Australian Dav Whatmore declined to renew his contract in May this year. 

Whatmore coached Bangladesh from 2003 until end of the last World Cup in the West Indies and steered Bangladesh to the second round for the first time.

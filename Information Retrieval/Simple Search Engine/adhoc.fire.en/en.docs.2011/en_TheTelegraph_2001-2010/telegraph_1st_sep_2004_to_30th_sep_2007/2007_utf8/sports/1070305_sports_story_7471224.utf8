The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Toronto: An allround performance by Atul Wassan helped Indian veterans beat their Pakistan counterparts by seven wickets at the Rogers Centre. Wassan opened the innings to score 41 after bagging three wickets. Harvinder Singh also had a three-wicket haul as Pakistan were skittled out for 109 after the Indian captain Ajay Jadeja elected to field. Wasim Akram posted a brave 52. Over 15,000 Indians and Pakistanis watched the match organised by the Canadian Cricket Association to raise funds for the Heart and Stroke Foundation. 

 New Delhi: Anup Sridhars fine run at the Yonex German Open badminton meet came to an end as he went down to top seed Lin Dan in the semis. The Chinese won 21-14, 21-12 in 27 minutes to set up a clash with second-seeded compatriot Yu Chen. Chen benefitted as another Chinese, Yun Yong Wu, withdrew with injury in the second game. The unseeded Sridhar had earlier scalped fifth seed Bjoern Joppien of Germany, Kaspar Oedium of Denmark and Koreas Sung Hwan Park. 

 Manchester: World footballs rule-making body moved a step closer towards sanctioning the introduction of goalline technology. The International Football Association Board made up of Fifa and the FAs of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland agreed that a system could be introduced to decide whether a ball had crossed the line or not. But after deciding that no satisfactory system currently exists, the board stopped short of setting a timetable for introducing new technology. The body also made it clear it would not permit the use of any other electronic assistance to help referees.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Will Greg stay on?

 - TEAM INDIA COACH 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Greg Chappell 

Johannesburg: Coach Greg Chappell appears to have kept open the option of continuing with Team India once his contract ends after the World Cup, which begins in March. 

I cant say whether this (Newlands) Test was my last... Depends on the Board of Control for Cricket in India, he told The Telegraph when asked if hed said goodbye to Tests as coach. 

There are no Tests between now and the World Cup and, so, the next will only be in England. Unless, of course, something develops on the Bangladesh-front. 

Chappell came on board in May 2005, succeeding John Wright, whod worn the coachs hat from November 2000 to April 2005. 

Unlike the last two full tours, where India won either the ODIs (Pakistan) or the Tests (West Indies), we drew a blank in both forms in South Africa. 

Its not what Chappell would have liked.

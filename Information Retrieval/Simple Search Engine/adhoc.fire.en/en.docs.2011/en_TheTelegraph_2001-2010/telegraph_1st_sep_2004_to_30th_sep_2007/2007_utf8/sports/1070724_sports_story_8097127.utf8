The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Conscience vote to the fore 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: It may be touted as a clash between the Prasun Mukherjee and Jagmohan Dalmiya camps, but the Dalmiya group candidates are banking more on their individual acceptability. 

Dalmiya insisted that fighting the BCCI dispensation, not the CAB, was his top priority. On Monday, he reiterated at the Writers Buildings where he had gone to meet commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen that his remaining out of the CAB management would not make any difference to its functioning. 

An official running in the joint secretaries race said the former presidents absence could be a factor but his acceptability counts the most. I dont know what the others are thinking. But success will essentially depend on how efficient and popular you are. We are asking the members to vote according to their conscience, he said. 

Mukherjee will conduct the polls as the members have unanimously decided against any court-appointed observer like last year. 

Meanwhile, the CAB officials held a meeting with the BCCI pitch consultant (East) Prabir Mukherjee and other curators to discuss Edens preparation for the Test, versus Pakistan in November.

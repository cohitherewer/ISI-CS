 Saqlain pitches for Harbhajan

Hove: Saqlain Mushtaq is convinced that India would prove to be tough customers in the Test series against England but the former Pakistan off-spinner is baffled that they didnt bring along Harbhajan Singh. 

Saqlain mentioned Harbhajans impressive record and felt India can ill afford to leave him out. 

How can Indian selectors drop a bowler of Harbhajans calibre? He has taken wickets in a heap against the best sides. That is the hallmark of a great bowler, Saqlain said. 

Only when you play quality sides and put in an impressive performance under pressure does it reflect how good you are. 

The former off-spinner has been granted British citizenship last week. 

Unfortunately, both in Pakistan and India, we do not treat players well. It just takes one bad series to lose the selectors confidence, Saqlain said. Apart from Harbhajan, Saqlain heaped praise on Anil Kumble too, describing the leg-spinner as a great bowler. 

Kumble has been bowling consistently well over the years. He commands a lot of respect. 

Despite Harbhajans absence, Saqlain predicted India would make life difficult for the hosts in the Test series. 

India have players such as Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly and V.V.S. Laxman, all of whom have got class and experience. Theyve played together for a number of years now. I believe India can put up a strong challenge, the off-spinner said. 

Saqlain refused to buy the argument that the side would be handicapped once these players eventually retire. 

Its true that you cant replace quality players overnight. But I have no doubt that theres no dearth of talent in India and Pakistan. 

Saqlain, however, took a dig at the way the Indian and Pakistan boards function. 

The talent in these two countries is amazing, but theres a problem with the people running the game. There are not enough scopes to nurture raw talent. The system doesnt support players from the grassroots. (PTI)

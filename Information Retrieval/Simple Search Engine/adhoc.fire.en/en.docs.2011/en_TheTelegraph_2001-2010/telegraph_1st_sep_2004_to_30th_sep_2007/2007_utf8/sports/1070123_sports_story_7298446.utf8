 Nadal sees off Murray in five-set thriller 

 - Clijsters, Hingis to clash in quarters 

 Clijsters smiles after beating Hantuchova on Monday 

Melbourne: Second-seeded Rafael Nadal survived a relentless challenge from Briton Andy Murray, rallying twice from a set down Monday to advance to the Australian Open quarter finals. 

Murrays withering serve, winners from the baseline and crisp volleys repeatedly had Nadal off-balance. But the super-fit Spaniard had more left at the end of the four-hour match than the slender, 19-year-old Murray, taking a 6-7 (3-7), 6-4, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 victory. 

It was very, very, very tough, Nadal said. He is playing at an unbelievable level. All the time I was trying my best, trying to fight for every point. I needed one match like this against a big player. 

He earned a match-up with No. 10 Fernando Gonzalez of Chile, who earlier ousted No. 5 James Blake 7-5, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4) in another display of high-energy, high-quality tennis. 

Tommy Haas also advanced with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 win over eighth-seeded David Nalbandian and next plays third-seeded Nikolay Davydenko, who dropped a set for the first time before beating No. 13 Tomas Berdych 5-7, 6-4, 6-1, 7-6 (7-5). 

Blake, however, refused to make excuses. He played well; Gonzalez was simply too good. 

Im sure theres a million reasons, a million excuses I could come up with, a disappointed Blake said. He played better than me today. Served better, returned better. There were a few points there Id love to have over again, but thats the way it goes. He played great on the big points. 

Like Gonzalez, fourth-seeded Kim Clijsters stayed hot, too, beating No. 15 Daniela Hantuchova 6-1, 7-5 after dropping only nine games in her first three matches. She next faces off-court friend Martina Hingis, the three-time champion here who struggled before dispatching 19th-seeded Li Na 4-6, 6-3, 6-0. 

Its always a pleasure to play her again here, Clijsters said. Shes just a great champion. 

Top-seeded Maria Sharapova had to work hard to get past No. 22 Vera Zvonareva 7-5, 6-4 in an all-Russian match and plays another Russian in the quarter finals 12th-seeded Ana Chakvetadze, a 6-4, 6-1 winner over No. 8 Patty Schnyder. 

I thought I played a lot better today than in the previous rounds, Sharapova said. But I will definitely have to step it up again. 

Tommy Haas ended eighth-seeded David Nalbandians endurance run, advancing to the quarter finals with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 win. Haas will next play third-seeded Nikolay Davydenko, who dropped a set for the first time in the tournament before beating No. 13 Tomas Berdych 5-7, 6-4, 6-1, 7-6 (5). 

Nalbandian twice rallied from two sets down and saved match points in earlier rounds, but ran out of gas after taking the opening set against the 12th-ranked Haas. 

As Blake took court for his first outdoor match after three stints with the roof closed due to weather, strong sun had people fanning themselves, and umbrellas sprouted during changeovers. Pockets of Chilean fans waved national flags, chanted, danced and unsuccessfully tried to start the wave. 

It was mostly power against power, but both players were mixing in changes of speed and slice to keep each other off-balance. When they missed, it was by inches. 

Hingis, the Swiss star who swept the 1997-99 titles and reached the finals the next three years before retiring due to nagging foot and ankle problems, weathered an early challenge from Li. She came out on fire,Hingis said. 

Last year, the 23-year-old Clijsters, in her final season on the tour, ended Hingis first run at a major since returning to the Tour. She has won their last two matches, too, tying their head-to-head record at 4-4. 

Sharapova, who played in broiling heat her first match and in steamy conditions with the roof closed and the air conditioning malfunctioning in her last, had a chilly night this time. 

She put constant pressure on Zvonarevas serve and finally cashed her 10th break point to pull ahead 6-5, then held serve to finish off the first set. 

Zvonareva double-faulted twice on break points in the second set as Sharapova raced to a 5-2 lead. Sharapova faltered while serving for the match the first time and fell behind 0-40 the second, then double-faulted on her first match point. She finally took advantage on her third opportunity on a forehand down the line.

 Shiv 2 shots off lead

Wentworth: Shiv Kapur remained on course for an impressive finish in the BMW PGA Championship after a steady round of one-under 71. He was in tied fifth place after the second round. 

Following his solid 67 in Round 1, Kapur the Asian Tours rookie of the year in 2005 was six-under-par 138 at the Wentworth Club. 

Two other Indian stars Jyoti Randhawa (75) and Jeev Milkha Singh (69) also made the cut. 

Kapur was just two shots behind the leading duo of Angel Cabrera of Argentina (66) and Englands Justin Rose (70). 

Randhawa slipped down the ladder with a three-over 75 that included four bogeys, a double bogey and three birdies. He was one-under 143 and tied 27th down from overnight tied seventh. 

There was some cheer for Jeev. He came back from a tough round of 77 on the first day with a 69 that saw him squeeze inside the cut line at tied 60th place. 

Kapur made a strong start with birdies on the first two holes and another on the fifth. But two quick bogeys, on the seventh and ninth, followed by a double on the 4 15th threatened to ruin his day. But back-to-back birdies salvaged his round and put him in a good position to make a charge over the weekend. 

Randhawa had birdies on the fourth, 12th and 18th, while he dropped shots on the fifth, sixth, 10th and 13th. He also had a double-bogey on the 16th. (PTI)

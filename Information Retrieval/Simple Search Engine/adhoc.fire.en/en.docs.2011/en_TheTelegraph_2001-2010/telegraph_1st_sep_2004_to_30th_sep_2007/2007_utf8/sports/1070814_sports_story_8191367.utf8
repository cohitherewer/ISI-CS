The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Series is Team Indias but England salvage pride

 - Vaughan says he wouldnt have enforced follow-on either

London: Preparations for Christmas have begun across England, but the gifts havent been sent out. Being generous visitors, the Indians had offered one well in advance and Michael Vaughans men grabbed it with both hands. 

The bubbly, though, was still uncorked by Rahul Dravid and Co. 

Ironically, for the first three days of the final npower Test (at the Brit Oval), Indias hands had been on Englands jugular. Till Dravids inexplicable no-follow-on act that is. 

So, instead of hurtling to another morale-crushing defeat, England walked away with a thoroughly honourable draw, on Monday. 

Thanks to the seven-wicket win at Trent Bridge, the Indians took the three-match series 1-0 the first such success here in 21 years. It ended Englands unbeaten six-year run at home. 

However, its the present which gets magnified and one cant help but speak about the fourth morning. 

That, indeed, is the only thing to talk about... I still cant believe we didnt have confidence in our 319-run lead, diplomat and author Shashi Tharoor who, with a bit of luck couldve been heading the UN, told The Telegraph. 

Tharoor summed up the feelings of a vast majority of Indians from London to Ludhiana. 

Dravid, though, strongly defended his decision. My bowlers were tired and I needed to look after them... I know them best and can read their body language... People sitting in their living rooms may have been disappointed but, as captain, Ive got to take decisions and stand by them... Have to back my judgement. 

He added: We gave ourselves the best chance of making it 2-0... Its not often that we win overseas and Im very proud of the entire squad... At critical moments, we played better cricket... This is going to rank very high among my achievements... Its a very special moment... 

Somewhat surprisingly, given that hes seen as a captain with a difference, Vaughan said he wouldve done the same. They were 1-0 up and wanted to make sure they won the series... Of course, its disappointing to lose, but credit to Dravid and his team. We need to learn from mistakes. 

Actually, the series shouldve ended 2-1 in Indias favour. England deserved to win the first Test, at Lords, but the elements saved India. At the Oval, the Indians didnt land the killer-punch, content to finish with a 1-0 scoreline. 

A 2-0 result wouldve carried India to joint second (with England) in the ICCs Test rankings. One isnt diluting the series win a major achievement, after all but theres no point pontificating on positive cricket if the approach essentially is anything but that. 

For the record, requiring a never-before achieved 500 to square the series, England finished on 369 for six. Kevin Pietersen hit his second hundred of the series and there were contributions from everybody else as well including Matt Prior, who anchored one end in fading light. 

Anil Kumble, who scored his maiden Test hundred in his 151st innings, got the MoM award. Zaheer Khan, with a record 18 wickets, was Indias Man-of-the-Series. For England, the award went to James Anderson (14 wickets) and not Pietersen. 

Throughout the series, the Indians produced a team effort that Kumble emerged as the lone centurion underlines it perfectly. 

Zaheers coming good is no surprise, but his partner-in-swing Rudra Pratap Singh was an absolute revelation. Among the batters, Dinesh Karthik excelled and Sourav Ganguly proved age is no factor. 

What counts is class and he showed that in plenty. There were crucial innings from Sachin Tendulkar and Mahendra Singh Dhoni as well. 

As the Indians did an emotional lap of honour, egged on by a huge contingent of fans, two memories left a sour taste the jelly beans at Trent Bridge and poor umpiring from Lords to the Oval. 

The seven-match ODI series begins next week.

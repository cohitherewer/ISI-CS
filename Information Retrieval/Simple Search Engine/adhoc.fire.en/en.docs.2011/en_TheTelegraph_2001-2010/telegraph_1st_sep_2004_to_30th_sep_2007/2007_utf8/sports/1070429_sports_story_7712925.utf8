Confirming the development, Mhambrey told The Telegraph: Owing to some personal reasons Ive opted to move out of Bengal. My family wants me to be closer home (Mumbai). Ive communicated this over phone to CAB president (Prasun Mukherjee), secretary (Saradindu Pal), captain (Deep Dasgupta) and manager (Samir Dasgupta). 

An emotional Paras then went on to add: Obviously Im going to miss Bengal But in life youve to move on. It has been a fruitful association with Bengal. We were a great bunch. Paras, however, said he may think about coming back to Bengal a year later It is learnt that Mhambrey is going to join Baroda, though he also has offers from Rajasthan and Maharashtra. 

On the offer, Paras said: At the moment I dont want to discuss that. However he hinted that Baroda may be a possibility. 

The CAB, by the way, is still hoping that Mhambrey will change his decision. According to Mukherjee: Its 95 per cent sure that hes leaving. On whether the CAB has thought of any replacement, Mukherjee said, In the next few days, Ill discuss the issue. 

Physio R. Krishnan too has sought not to extend his contract with Bengal. Krishnan is going to America to complete a one-year postgraduate course. Krishnan hails from Tamil Nadu. 

Following the downpour Saturday, the CAB is keeping the indoor facilities ready for the Team India camp from Wednesday.

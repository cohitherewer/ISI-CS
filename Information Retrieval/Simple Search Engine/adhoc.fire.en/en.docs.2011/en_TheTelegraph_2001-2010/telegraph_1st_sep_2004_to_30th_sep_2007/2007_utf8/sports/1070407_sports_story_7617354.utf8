 Shoaib, Asif need more rest: PCB

Karachi: Pakistani fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif need more time to recover from the injuries that kept them out of the World Cup, a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official said on Friday. 

Akhtar and Asif were withdrawn from the World Cup squad after being declared unfit by the boards medical panel. Pakistan were knocked out of the World Cup in the first round after losing to West Indies and Ireland. 

Shoaib has a knee injury and Asif an elbow problem. 

They need at least two more weeks of rest before they are examined again by our medical panel, Zakir Khan, the boards director of cricket operations said. The medical panel will decide when they can resume training. (REUTERS)

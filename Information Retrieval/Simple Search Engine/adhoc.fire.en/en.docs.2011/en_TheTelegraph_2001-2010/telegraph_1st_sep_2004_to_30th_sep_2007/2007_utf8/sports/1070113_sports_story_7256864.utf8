 Ranty Martins scored two for Dempo 

Duler (Goa): Riding on Anthony Pereira and Ranty Martins brace, Dempo thrashed Mohammedan Sporting 5-0 to garner their first full points in the 11th ONGC National Football League played here Friday. 

Dempo, who led 3-0 at half time, scored through Anthony Pereira (1st, 41st), Ranty Martins (11th, 67th) and substitute Peter Carvalho. 

Dempo took early lead through a defensive error. A long kick by Dempos goalkeeper Satish Kumar into the rival box saw rival goalkeeper Gopal Das and defender Madhab Kumar Das fail to clear the ball in a misunderstanding, the loose ball fell on the path of Pereira who tapped the ball into the net. 

Medio Climax Lawerence set up Clifford Miranda on the left flank who in turn relayed the ball to Pereira and the latter sent a deep goalmouth cross which beat the defence. Ranty, who was left unmarked, guided the ball in from close. With four minutes left for the interval, Pereira second his second. Ranty, combining well with Pereira upfront set up defender Valerian Rebello. Valerian moved up on the right to send a measured cross to Pereira who made it 3-0 for Dempo. 

Ranty scored his second in the 61st minute, chesting the ball off a measured cross by defender Valerian into the net. 

Substitute, Carvalho then completed the rout, heading home a well-directed corner kick taken by Clifford Miranda. 

Meanwhile, at the Cooperage, an injury-time goal from substitute Narendra Meetei helped local club Air India hold Sporting Clube de Goa to a 1-1 draw. Dudu Omagbemi had drawn forst blood for the Goan club.

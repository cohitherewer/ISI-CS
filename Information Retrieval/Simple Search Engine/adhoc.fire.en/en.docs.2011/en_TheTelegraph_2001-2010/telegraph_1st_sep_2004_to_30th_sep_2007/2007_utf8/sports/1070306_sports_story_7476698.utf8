 1999: If you dont remember

26 may 1999, India vs Sri Lanka India won by 157 runs. It was a match that broke all kinds of records and an emotional one for Sachin Tendulkar who had just a few days ago lost his father. It was a complete demolition. When Arjuna Ranatunga put India into bat he had no clue about what was coming. From 6/1 the Indians raced to 324/2 as Sourav Ganguly (183) and Rahul Dravid (145) plundered the bowling. The pair added 318 runs for the second wicket. After that a few more wickets fell in the frenzied final overs and India posted an imposing 373/6. Sri Lanka were never in the chase. Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana falling for 3 and 7 respectively, only compounded their problems. Sri Lanka were bundled out for 216 with Robin Singh (5/31) cleaning up the tail. Aravinda de Silva (56) was Lankas top scorer. Heroes became zeroes in vastly different conditions as compared to 1996. Jayasuriya, the dominant figure of the last World Cup in the sub-continent, scored 82 in five matches. 

8 june 1999, India vs Pakistan India won by 47 runs. In a match that was probably the most hyped in World Cup history thus far, India prevailed yet again. In the back drop of the Kargil war, the political tension between the two countries spread onto the cricket field. The match itself was quiet a sober affair. India electing to bat first made a modest 227/6. Rahul Dravid (61), Mohammed Azharuddin (59) and Sachin Tendulkar (45) were the main contributors. Pakistan began the chase in a hurry but kept losing wickets and momentum. Despite a sore finger, Inzamam-ul Haq made a brave 41 along with Moin Khan (34), but it was Venkatesh Prasads 5/27 that ensured an Indian win. 

17 june 1999, Australia vs South Africa Match tied. It was a few moments of complete cricketing madness that cost South Africa a place in the final yet again and resulted in the World Cups first ever tie. South Africa won the toss and put the Aussies in. From 3/1, it soon became 68/4. A middle-order revival from Steve Waugh (56) and Michael Bevan (65) and Australia plodded to 213 with Shaun Pollock (5/36) being the wrecker in chief. Herschelle Gibbs (30) and Gary Kirsten (18) began confidently but South Africa were soon reduced to 61/4. There was again a mid-innings revival from Jacques Kallis (53) and Jonty Rhodes (43). Lance Klusener was soon left with the tail. Damien Fleming bowled the last over with South Africa needing 9 runs with 1 wicket in hand. Two balls later, the scores were levelled by Klusener with two screaming fours! The yes and no between Klusener and Donald resulted in the latter being run out off the fourth ball of the over leaving his teammates shattered. Australian skipper Steve Waugh later acknowledged that it was the best cricket game he had ever played.

 Its all a dream, says Inzaghi

Athens: Filippo Inzaghi justified Carlo Ancelottis decision to go for trusted experience rather than youthful vigour by scoring both goals in AC Milans 2-1 Champions League final win over Liverpool on Wednesday night. 

The 33-year-old striker got the nod ahead of Alberto Gilardino to spearhead Milans attack, and the reliable veteran didnt let the side down. 

Inzaghi, nicknamed Super Pippo, was ruled out of the 2005 Champions League final due to injury. He had watched in horror from the stands as Milan were beaten by Liverpool on penalties. 

This season Inzaghis appearances have been limited by more injury problems, but his full recovery several months ago was great news for Ancelotti. 

Inzaghi, nine years older than Gilardino, never stopped believing that he would play an important part in Milans season, which began with a double-leg third-round qualifier to reach the Champions League back in August. 

I am an optimist and always believe in myself, said the former Italy international, who had helped Milan to victory in the 2003 Champions League final as well. 

Obviously this night is deeply rewarding for me, and the most important thing was that we won the Cup. 

Its a feeling of great joy. There arent words to describe it... I feel like its all a dream. 

Ive had my injury problems this season, but nobody doubted I would come back. There is a lot of trust in me at this club. 

According to Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez, Inzaghis first goal was a fluke. It was luck but that is football, the Spaniard said of the goal that deflected off Inzaghi from Andrea Pirlos free-kick. 

Inzaghi insisted the goal wasnt by chance. It was something that we rehearsed in training, said Inzaghi with a grin. Sometimes it just comes off.The first goal opened up the game but the second was certainly better, he said. 

Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi said he knew Inzaghi would find the target. I told Inzaghi before the match that he was guaranteed to score, said the former Italian Prime Minister. 

Inzaghi, whose brace took his Champions League tally to 38 goals, said he was looking forward to the summer break after a long season. 

Dont forget we were on the pitch on August 9 for the preliminary round, he said. 

I will take a well-earned rest over the summer, as I didnt have any real holiday this year. It will be a very enjoyable time. 

Ancelotti claimed his team had restored the credibility of Italian football. (Agencies)

Cape Town: The series-deciding third Test between India and South Africa was delicately poised at stumps on Day IV with the hosts needing another 156 runs with eight wickets in hand on a deteriorating fifth day track. 

Chasing 211 for victory, South Africa were 55 for two in their second knock at close on fourth day and would get three sessions on the final day on Saturday to claim the three-Test series after trailing 0-1 at one stage. 

Anil Kumble would be crucial to Indias plan of scripting their first-ever series win in South Africa but with not enough runs to defend, even the veteran leg spinner may find it difficult to stop the Proteas. 

India have themselves to blame for squandering an advantage of 41 runs in the first innings, managing only 169 in the second after being 90 for two at one stage. 

Ironically Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid batted listlessly in the afternoon and allowed the South Africans to roar back. 

Sachin made 14 from 88 minutes of uninspiring batting in which he faced 66 balls and hit just one four. Dravid, in this stretch, made 11 from 88 minutes and in between them, Indias golden chance to win the match went abegging. 

They wasted the good stand of 84 for the third wicket between Dravid and Sourav Ganguly (46) who came to the wicket in weird circumstances in the morning. 

Dravid was the first one to leave in the afternoon session, during which India scored only 48 runs at the cost of four wickets.

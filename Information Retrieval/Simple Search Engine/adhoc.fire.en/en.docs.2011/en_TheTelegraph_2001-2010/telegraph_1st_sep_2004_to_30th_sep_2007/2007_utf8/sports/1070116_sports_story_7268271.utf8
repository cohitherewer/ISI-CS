 CA keen to host 6-Test series

 2010-11 Ashes 

Sydney: Not satisfied with humiliating England 5-0, Australian cricket authorities are now proposing that the next Ashes series they host are played over six Tests. 

Australia wants to add an extra Test to the 2010-11 series after this seasons five Tests were all sold out. 

The additional match would be played in Hobart, along with the traditional venues of Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide. 

Cricket Australia (CA) is keen in principal to have six Test matches the next time we have an Ashes series in four years, CA spokesman Peter Young said on Monday. 

The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) are aware of our ambition, but discussions are a long way off being finalised. 

England coach Duncan Fletcher, who oversaw Englands first 0-5 series loss in 86 years, said he was opposed to the idea because of the risks of player burnout. 

Somewhere along the line, weve got to have a break, he said. To introduce more cricket is just going to complicate the issue. 

Although the majority of Ashes contests have been played over five Tests, there have been eight six-match series, the last in 1997, which Australia won 3-2. (REUTERS)

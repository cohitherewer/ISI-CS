 Tewari: U-22 captaincy helped me

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The man who steered Bengal to their 13th Ranji Trophy final Manoj Tewari doesnt care much about personal achievements. 

I always feel good when I score, but I feel better when my score contributes to Bengals success, Tewari said after Bengal wrapped up a six-wicket win over Karnataka at the Eden on Saturday. 

Tewari, the 21-year-old from Howrah, feels that leading the Bengal U-22 side in the CK Nayudu Trophy had helped his mature as a batsman. As captain, I had to take the responsibility, which is being reflected here, Tewari stated. 

Tewari didnt forget mention Avishek Jhunjhunwalas contribution. He played really well and we complemented each other, he said. 

Meanwhile, Bengal mediumpacer Sourav Sarkar got accolades from Karnataka coach Venkatesh Prasad after his eight-wicket match haul. 

I had a session with Venky and he told me few things which I will try to follow, Sourav told The Telegraph. 

Prasad has asked the seamer to support Ranadeb, who is in very good form at the moment. He asked me to give Rana the support he needs. 

Prasad felt that there are a lot of talents in India such as Sarkar and others who just need to tapped. Both Sarkar and Ranadeb are good prospects and they shouldnt bowl too long spells. 

Captain Deep Dasgupta also showered praise on Tewari. He (Tewari) and Avishek displayed some good batting to see us through, Deep remarked. 

Prasad rued the lack of a breakthrough in the initial hour on Day V. Had we got one wicket in that period, it could have been a different story.

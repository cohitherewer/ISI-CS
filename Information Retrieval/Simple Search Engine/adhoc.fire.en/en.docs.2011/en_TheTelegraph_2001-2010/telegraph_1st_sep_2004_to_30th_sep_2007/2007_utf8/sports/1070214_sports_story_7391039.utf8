 Tikolo retained Kenya captain

Nairobi: Kenya named the 15-man squad on Tuesday for the World Cup in the West Indies retaining the same side that won the world cricket division one title they hosted earlier this month. 

Long-serving skipper Steve Tikolo retains his place with allrounder Thomas Odoyo as his deputy, but the selection left out three other experienced players, two of whom failed to beat the selection deadline and a third down with injury. 

Wicketkeeper-batsman Kennedy Otieno and left-hander Hitesh Modi failed to make the deadline while opening bowler Martin Suji is still nursing a knee injury.

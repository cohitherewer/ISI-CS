Milan: World champions Italy face a tricky trip to Ukraine on Wednesday and England host Russia knowing defeats would hamper their Euro 2008 qualification hopes. 

Third-placed Portugal are also far from comfortable in group A and need a home win against hard-working Serbia to follow up on Saturdays 2-2 draw with leaders Poland, who travel to Finland. 

Stuttering Spain are level on points with second-placed Northern Ireland in group F despite Saturdays lacklustre 1-1 draw in Iceland. 

Group Ds crunch match comes in Prague where the Czech Republic in second can pull clear of third-placed Ireland with a win and almost put group leaders Germany through to next years finals. 

The Netherlands can build on the weekends 2-0 win over group G rivals Bulgaria when Marco Van Bastens men visit Albania, although Bulgaria will be more confident of the points at home to Luxembourg. Leaders Romania do not play. 

In group C, holders Greece travel to second-placed Norway, looking to extend their two-point advantage at the top while Turkey, two points behind the Scandinavians, entertain Hungary. 

Roberto Donadonis Italy will be without midfielder Gennaro Gattuso for the group B game in Kiev after the AC Milan player picked up a booking in Saturdays 0-0 draw with leaders France. 

Daniele De Rossi, Andrea Pirlo and Gianluca Zambrotta are doubts for the Ukraine match while striker Luca Toni is again out with a thigh strain and has been replaced by forward Vincenzo Iaquinta. 

His Juventus teammate Alessandro Del Piero was off the pace at the San Siro on Saturday and may be fearing for his place for a game Italy cannot afford to lose despite second-placed Scotland also visiting France on Wednesday. 

France, who are without the suspended Thierry Henry, have 19 points, Scotland 18, Italy 17 and Ukraine 13. 

England still lie third in group E despite Saturdays morale-boosting 3-0 home win over Israel. Guus Hiddinks Russia, one point ahead in second, will be much tougher opponents at Wembley but Steve McClaren may name the same team with Frank Lampard and Owen Hargreaves again ruled out with injury. 

Striker Emile Heskey performed well against Israel in his first international match since Euro 2004 and will hope to keep his place alongside Michael Owen despite Liverpools giant forward Peter Crouch being available after suspension. 

Spain host Latvia in Oviedo with coach Luis Aragones still upset by their performance against Iceland, when they scrambled a 1-1 draw following Xabi Alonsos early dismissal for stamping.

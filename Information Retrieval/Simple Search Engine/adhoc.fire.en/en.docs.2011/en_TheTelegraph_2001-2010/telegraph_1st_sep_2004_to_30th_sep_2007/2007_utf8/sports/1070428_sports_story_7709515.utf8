The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Non-event has left an empty feeling

MICHAEL HENDERSON

 Kevin Pietersen was

 truly impressive 

At last! The ninth, and by some distance the least involving World Cup concludes Saturday when Australia, the holders, defend their status against Sri Lanka, who defeated them in the last match of the 1996 tournament. In other words, the final throws together the teams who were expected to prevail when this bloated enterprise began, seven long weeks ago. 

The redeveloped Kensington Oval, one of the greatest stages in the cricketing world, will be packed. The organisers have seen to that. Embarrassed by their mismanagement of the World Cup, which has not posted a house full notice until now, the International Cricket Council have rounded up corporate guests from every nook and cranny, and distributed tickets to anybody sound of mind and body who will have them. 

For one day Barbados will become crickets very own Potemkin Village, with Malcolm Speed, the ICC chief executive, cast in the role of Catherine the Great, the monarch who Grigory Potemkin tried to please by erecting villages of joyful Russian rustics overjoyed to receive the royal visitor. What wonders we have performed, he may think. The game is expanding all the time, and the next shindig will be better still. 

There is an alternative view, and it has been expressed freely by those observers who do not hold official titles. This has been the worst tournament imaginable; short of spectators and memorable games, it has also been far too long. 

If the worlds footballers can find a winner in a month, there is no excuse for the cricketers to be given three weeks more to determine which of them will meet Australia in the final. The first World Cup, staged in England in June 1975, was over and done within two memorable weeks. 

Reflecting on the events of this tournament, there have been a few highlights, most foreseen. Glenn McGrath, the worlds best opening bowler, has justified his ranking with 25 wickets, a World Cup record, and 70 in all World Cup matches, another record. Matthew Hayden, the most destructive opening batsman, has plundered three centuries. Ricky Ponting looks what he is, the best batsman still playing. 

There have been three special events: Ireland beating Pakistan, and Bangladesh walloping India and up-and-down South Africa. As a consequence, neither Pakistan nor India advanced to the not-so-super Super Eight. 

Brian Lara retired after the West Indies lost to England at the Kensington Oval in the tightest match, though the fixture lacked importance because neither side could progress to the semi-finals. 

And Herschelle Gibbs, the South African opener, belted six sixes in an over off a hapless Dutchman. So what? When it came to hey-lads-hey the South Africans, not for the first time, revealed themselves to be chokers. 

But the other side of the inventory is not encouraging. The ICC have had to paper the house time and again because the tickets have been prohibitively expensive for the locals. In St Lucia on Wednesday, more than 6,000 tickets were given away so that television viewers would not see a half-empty ground for the Australia-South Africa semi-final. Also, those grounds have been zealously policed by killjoys instructed to ban anything and everything that is not officially endorsed by the sponsors. 

So a competition that was supposed to reflect the best of the Caribbean has been nothing less than a disaster for this part of the world, whose people have given so much to the game. 

The tragic and so far unexplained death of Bob Woolmer in the second week hardly helped matters, but even if he was still alive the common perception would remain of a tournament without soul, spirit or momentum. 

This was the World Cup that never really began. Even this weeks semi-finals were non-events. The first contest to engage the popular imagination will also be the last. 

From an English viewpoint the tournament was nothing less than a shambles. They went into the World Cup not having the foggiest idea what their best team was, and they left it as the butt of off-colour jokes after Andrew Flintoff fell into the ocean off St Lucia, not entirely sober, and Duncan Fletcher, a fine coach who had shown too much loyalty to his men, paid for that indulgence with his job. 

It would be nice to think that England will regroup after this latest debacle, or take positives from the experience, as some of the players like to put it, but dont bet on it. That road could lead to the poor house. Since reaching the final in Melbourne in 1992, they have failed to compete in the closing stages of the last four tournaments, and their performance here was inept in conception and execution. 

Only Kevin Pietersen, who made two centuries, truly impressed. Flintoff, chastened by his one-match ban after the pedalo incident, and stripped forever of the captaincy, appears a shadow of his forceful personality. The Prestonian is so important to England, and should have two more fruitful years left at the highest level, but it is not clear that he is receiving the best advice, or keeping the best company. Perhaps it is time for Neil Fairbrother, his agent, to sit him down once more, and tell him what he may not want to hear. 

Flintoff, and England, may learn from this experience. Sadly, the ICC will not. The games global governors are already looking forward to the next bloated World Cup, unaware of the overwhelming evidence: that cricket, a game played by no more than a dozen nations, cannot supply an international spectacle lasting nearly two months. Because the money men will ignore this, each tournament will become more tedious than the one before. 

The West Indies World Cup: a complete non-event. How sad.

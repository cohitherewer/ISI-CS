New York: Sania Mirza had a rollercoaster day at the US Open as she advanced to the quarter finals of the doubles with an upset win over former champions Lisa Raymond and Samantha Stosur, but crashed out of the mixed event in the last-eight stage. 

Sania and American partner Bethanie Mattek on Monday rallied to shock the second-seeded American-Australian pair 2-6, 7-5, 7-5 (as reported in Tuesdays Late City edition). 

The unseeded Indo-American duo will next take on fifth seeds Yung-Jan Chan and Chia-Jung Chuang of Chinese Taipei for a place in the semis. 

In the mixed doubles event, Sania and Mahesh Bhupathi were outplayed 4-6, 1-6 by Belarussian pair of Victoria Azarenka and Max Mirnyi. 

But Leander Paes made sure that the Indian challenge continued in the mixed event. He and his American partner Meghann Shaughnessy beat Ashley Harkleroad and Justin Gimelstob 6-3, 6-4 to advance to the semi-finals. 

They will now be up against the British-American pair of Jamie Murray and Liezel Huber, who defeated Polands Agnieszka Radwanska and Mariusz Fyrstenberg 6-1, 6-2. 

Sania and Matteks win over the 2005 champions was the highlight of the womens doubles event. The Indo-American pair was in trouble as Raymond and Stosur broke them thrice to clinch the opening set in just half-an-hour. 

But the momentum shifted in the second set as Sania started to return with more pace and also exhibited better strokeplay at the nets. 

Sania and Mattek finally got a break of serve at 5-5 and served out to even the match. The decider could have gone either way as there were seven breaks of serve with both sides struggling to hold. 

Sania had an opportunity to close out the match while serving at 5-4 but she was broken. However, that hardly made any difference as Raymond and Stosur once again lost their serve, giving Mattek the chance to end the match. 

This time, the Sania did not miss the opportunity and held serve to advance. (PTI)

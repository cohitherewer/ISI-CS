 Shoaib fitness

Karachi: Pakistan quick Shoaib Akhtar has been asked to prove his match fitness to be eligible for selection for the one-off ODI against India in Scotland next month. 

Akhtar, who has not played a competitive match in the past 14 months, was on Wednesday included in a provisional squad of 20. Shoaib is back because he has been training hard and working overtime on his fitness. But we still need to see his fitness, chief selector Salahuddin Ahmed said. (PTI)

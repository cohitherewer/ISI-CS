The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 New trophy unveiled 

by AIFF

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: In 1982, when the All India Football Federation (AIFF) launched the Nehru Cup, the glittering trophy was unveiled by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in front of a capacity crowd at Eden Gardens in Calcutta. 

On Thursday, the AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi officially launched yet another trophy for the Nehru Cup after the federation failed to recover the original trophy, which was last seen in 1997. 

While unveiling the highly impressive new ONGC Nehru Cup, Das Munshi said the new trophy had to be made as Iraq, who won it in 1997, are yet to return it. 

Federation sources, however, said teams are generally not allowed to take home rolling trophies like Nehru Cup. 

The old Nehru Cup, which once attracted stars like Enzo Francescoli, Laszlo Kiss, Jorge Luis Burruchaga, Euzebiusz Smolarek, Rinat Dasayev and Alexei Mikhailichenko to India, seems to have lost for ever. 

India received a favourable draw in the Nehru Cup, which was officially released on Thursday. India start their campaign on the inaugural day with a match against Cambodia, tournaments lowest ranked team. 

All matches in the five-team tournament will be played under the newly-installed floodlights at the Ambedkar Stadium. 

The President of India, Pratibha Patil will inaugurate the tournament.

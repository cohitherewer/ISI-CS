Calcutta: Hari Lal was among those watching Nigeria take on Bangladesh in their first match of the second Commonwealth Volleyball Championship for men on Tuesday. 

The analyst of the Indian team, sitting beside head coach G.E. Sridharan, was busy jotting down a few points. It was basic homework on eve of Indias match against Nigeria, and it helped on Wednesday evening at the Netaji Indoor Stadium. 

If it took Bangladesh 75 minutes to blank Nigeria 3-0, India finished off the job in 54 minutes. Earlier in the day, Australia had drubbed Nigeria 3-0. Both the hosts and Australia whose semi-final entries had been put on hold following Nigerias delayed entry are now safely through without any doubt. 

Guruchand Singhs furious serves and top-scorer Pradeeps spiking skills helped India bag the first set 25-6 in just 14 minutes. The African team showed some fight in the second set before conceding it 19-25. 

The third set saw Sridharan give his reserves an outing. Even with three substitutes, India clinched the issue with a 25-15 set. 

India will clash with Australia on Thursday to decide the group A toppers. 

Earlier, Pakistan beat South Africa 3-0 to top group B. Both teams had already made the last four. 

In an inconsequential group A match, Sri Lanka rallied past Bangladesh 3-1.

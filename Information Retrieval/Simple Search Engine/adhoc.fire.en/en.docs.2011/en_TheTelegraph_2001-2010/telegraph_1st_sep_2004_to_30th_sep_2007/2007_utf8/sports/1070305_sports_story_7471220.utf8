Calcutta: Darmen Sadvakasov of Kazakhstan surged into sole lead after Round VIII of the Calcutta Open at Gorky Sadan on Sunday. 

Sadvakasov, who had beaten top seed Sergei Tiviakov of The Netherlands on Saturday, was a trifle fortunate against the 17-year-old G.N. Gopal of Kerala as he erred towards the end. 

Gopal, who required a draw against Sadvakasov for his maiden GM norm, can still make it if he settles for a truce with Sriram Jha in his penultimate round match on Monday. Jha is also on verge of getting his maiden GM norm and needs a draw. 

Sitting pretty on seven points, Sadvakasov later told The Telegraph: I won a pawn in the end-game, but it was heading towards a draw since the pawns were on the same side... Gopal should have put his pawn on h4, g3 and f2 for the draw. 

P.D.S. Girinath, who drew with S. Kidambi in the eighth round, needs to win his next match for a GM norm. 

While Lalit Babu has confirmed his IM norms, other prospects of the same are national under-13 boys champion Vidit Gujarathi, K. Ratnakaran, S.P. Sethuraman, Vikramaditya Kamble, Aditya Udeshi, B.T. Muralikrishnan and Arghyadip Das.

 Gayle: Ill push him out there, even if on one leg

 - Prolific Chanderpaul doubtful for final ODI

 Chanderpaul in action on Wednesday 

Shivnarine Chanderpauls fitness for Saturdays final, decisive one-day International at Trent Bridge is in serious doubt after he damaged ankle ligaments during his match-winning 116 not out on Wednesday. 

A West Indies team spokesman said his fitness would be re-assessed on the morning the match. 

But Chris Gayle, the West Indian captain, promised on Wednesday night to push Chanderpaul out on one leg if he has to. I will push him out there, even if on one leg, he jokingly told reporters after the series-levelling victory, achieved with four overs to spare. 

It doesnt matter how he gets there. He is our in-form batter. We rely on him a lot. He has carried the guys and we play around him. It worked in this game, and hopefully it will work again on Saturday. 

It is one thing to collect not outs in Test matches, when time rarely presses, and quite another to do so against the clock. The crab-like Chanderpaul has now made 169 runs in two one-day Internationals without getting out, which takes his average from seven games on this tour to 184. Even Don Bradman, in his halcyon summer of 1930, only averaged 139 in Tests. 

He is one of the best batsmen in the world, said Gayle. I have said that Shiv can destroy any attack when he wants. He can step it up whenever he needs to. I have opened with him several times and he has outscored me many times already. 

I dont know how he manages to be so consistent, but the rest of our team could certainly learn something from that. 

Hes been very hard to dislodge all the way through this trip, admitted England ODI captain Paul Collingwood. 

Hes looking very calm at the crease at the moment but, hopefully come Saturday, we can have that little bit of luck or magic ball that gets him out early. Hes been exceptional, he doesnt give his wicket away easily. 

You have to give a lot of credit to the West Indies. The way they kept wickets in hand for the last 10 overs when they scored a lot of runs, they played it perfectly. 

England were short of penetration in the middle of the innings without Monty Panesar, left out in the search for what Collingwood called balance. 

There is a problem with that theory, however: without Andrew Flintoff in the side, England have no one else with the guile to break partnerships like Chanderpaul with Marlon Samuels. 

Gayle took a philosophical stance about a game that contained a few verbals. We are aggressive people, he said. Sometimes you forget its a gentlemans game and it can be a rough sport out there. 

England fast bowler James Anderson has been fined 50 per cent of his match fee after shoulder-barging West Indies batsman Runako Morton during the second ODI, adds an agency. Anderson, 24, appeared to deliberately walk in to Morton at the end of an over late in the West Indies innings on Wednesday, sparking an angry reaction from his opponent who gestured with his bat before umpire Brian Jerling intervened.

 Dravid knows what it takes to win 

Bangalore: Former captain Sourav Ganguly on Saturday said the absence of a coach during the forthcoming tours of Ireland and Scotland wont affect the teams performance as captain Rahul Dravid knows what it takes to win matches. 

Rahul has played enough cricket to know whats required to win matches. He has played more than 400 games for India. Its quite a lot. I am sure they (Sachin Tendulkar, vice-captain for the Tests versus England) know whats required, Sourav said. 

The Bengal left-hander said the senior players in the squad would have to take added responsibility. 

Of course, there will be responsibility (on senior players), Sourav said on the sidelines of a promotional event here. I believe the captain is the main man. Of course we (senior players) will be there to support him. 

England are a good side. We need to play well. I need to play well personally. Its an important tour for us, he said. England is a good place to play cricket in. Performances are noticed all over the world, the former captain felt. 

Sourav said left-arm spinner Monty Panesar, the first Sikh to play cricket for England, was a quality bowler. 

He has been Englands main wicket-taker in the last 4-5 Tests. Even in the early part of summer when wickets dont help (bowlers) that much, he bowled well. 

He is a quality spinner. But at the same time Panesar will have to bowl against a side who play spin bowling well. Itll be a good challenge for him. 

Allrounder Andrew Flintoff is doubtful for the series and the left-hander felt his absence would benefit India. (PTI)

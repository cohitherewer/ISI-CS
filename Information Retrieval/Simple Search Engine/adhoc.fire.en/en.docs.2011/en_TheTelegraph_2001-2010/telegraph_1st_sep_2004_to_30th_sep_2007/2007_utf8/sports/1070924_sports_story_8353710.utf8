 New coach before Pak series

Rajkot: India will play under an interim coach in the forthcoming ODI series against Australia and a full-time coach would take over before the home series against Pakistan, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said on Sunday. 

We (BCCI) have received some applications for the job of coach which would be reviewed during the boards working committee meeting to be held at Bangalore on September 29, Shah said. 

However, he did not disclose the name of any of the applicants. 

Shah said full time coach would be available only before the Pakistan series and India will have to play against Australia with an interim coach.

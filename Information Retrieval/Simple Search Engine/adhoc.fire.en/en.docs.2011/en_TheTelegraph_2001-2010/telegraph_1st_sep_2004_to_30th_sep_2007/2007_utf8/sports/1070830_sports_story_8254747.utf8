The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We are proud of Bobs boys: Chuni

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Wednesday became a memorable day for Indian football as Bob Houghtons boys lifted the Nehru Cup under Bhaichung Bhutias captaincy at the floodlit Ambedkar Stadium. 

Leading the accolades for Bhaichung amp; Co. was Asoke Ghosh, who was the AIFF secretary when the tournament was started in 1982. 

The Telegraph spoke to some former India internationals who have made India proud in the past. Following are the excerpts (alphabetically): 

SHABBIR ALI: This victory is good for us We should carry on from here. But we need more foreign exposures. I was in favour of foreign coaches from the beginning. I would give credit to Houghton who has done a great job.. 

BISWAJIT BHATTACHARYA: The players, officials and obviously coach Houghton will get the credit. I would congratulate Bhaichung for this marvellous performance.. 

SUBRATA BHATTACHARYA: We have very few instances of international success. This comes as a great relief for every Indian. But credit must be given to everyone. Coach Houghton also deserves a lot of praise. He has injected self-confidence and team spirit among the footballers. Support staffs should also get pat on their backs.. 

SUBHAS BHOWMICK: I had sent an SMS to Bhaichung early in the morning as I was almost sure of Indias victory. It appeared a completely different Indian unit as the players were positive and focused. There were many flaws, but the positive approach and optimism helped them achieve this success. The Federation should listen to Houghton and follow his methods. This is only a launching pad.. 

CHUNI GOSWAMI: We are all proud at the way Houghtons boys played. Congratulations to Bhaichung and his teammates. This victory has provided us a great opportunity to progress further, develop further. I am sure football will now get a fillip.. 

SYED NAYEEMUDDIN: We now have to pick up from here. It is a historic win. The way Indian footballers played showed their self-confidence and their firm belief.

 Soper, Clarke in ECB fray 

London: The England and Wales Cricket Board will choose between two candidates to replace outgoing chairman David Morgan. 

The ECB said Tuesday that its deputy chairman Michael Soper and Somerset county chairman Giles Clarke had been nominated to stand for election. 

The ballot will be sent out to Englands county teams and the Marylebone Cricket Club on July 30. The vote will close August 13 and the result announced August 28, subject to endorsement by the ECBs members. 

Morgan is set to step down on September 30 to take up the position of president of the International Cricket Council. 

Morgan takes over for two years from June 2008 and will be succeeded by Sharad Pawar of India. (AP)

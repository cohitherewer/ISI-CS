 Wilson ahead by a shot

Miami: American Mark Wilson birdied his last hole to take a one-shot lead over Boo Weekley into the final round of the Honda Classic at Palm Beach Gardens on Saturday. 

Wilson, who has just one top-three finish in 110 PGA Tour starts, remained on course to claim his first career title, carding the days joint top round of four-under 66 at the PGA National for an aggregate of six-under 204. 

Weekley, another American chasing his first maiden PGA win, matched Wilson with a 66 to sit alone at five-under 205 with Swedens Daniel Chopra one shot further adrift after a 68.

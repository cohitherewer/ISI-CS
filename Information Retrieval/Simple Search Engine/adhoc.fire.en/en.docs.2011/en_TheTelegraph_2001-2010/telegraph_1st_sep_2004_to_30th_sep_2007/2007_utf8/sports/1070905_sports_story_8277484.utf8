 Injury rules out Bosman

Johannesburg: South African opener Loots Bosman will miss the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 after he was ruled out with a back injury on Tuesday. 

Bosman was injured when he dived into the boundary boards during a one-dayer against Zimbabwe last month. 

A statement released by Cricket South Africa (CSA) said Bosman needed six weeks rest to recover from an injury to the lumbar spine. 

It is with deep regret that we had to take this course, Norman Arendse, the CSA president, was quoted as saying. 

But we have to look at the bigger picture, particularly as it affects his long-term career.

Melbourne: Rafael Nadal was feeling more than mental anguish after his run at the Australian Open was halted by swashbuckling Chilean Fernando Gonzalez in the quarter finals on Wednesday. 

He was playing at a very good level. It wasnt good for me... I couldnt play at 100 per cent, the world No. 2 said after his 2-6, 4-6, 3-6 defeat. I have problems in my leg so I couldnt run a lot. It was difficult to play a quarter final like this. 

The Spaniard said he picked up the injury after his late night five-set encounter with Briton Andy Murray in the fourth round two days ago. 

He was at a loss to explain how he sustained the injury but said the four-hour marathon with Murray had taken its toll. 

Attempting to reach the semis here for the first time, he took an injury time-out in the third set but that only delayed the inevitable for the normally combative Nadal. 

I have pain not just in one place, I have it in my famous arse, he added pointing to his backside. 

I had problems in my leg so I couldnt run properly. I just felt very tired. It was disappointing for me. Walking right now I have a lot of pain. Its more than just feeling tired. 

Nadal, who has now failed to reach a final of any kind since losing to Roger Federer in the Wimbledon showpiece last July, wants to overcome his injury woes before the Davis Cup clash against Switzerland next month. 

He plans to have the injury assessed once he flies back to Spain on Friday. I want to play in Davis Cup after one week. Thats my goal anyway, said Nadal, who had pulled out of the Sydney International earlier this month with a thigh strain. 

I want to be 100 per cent fit. Playing for your country is always special. 

Gonzalez, meanwhile, was trying to keep his feet on the ground. The 10th seed beat Australian Lleyton Hewitt and fifth seed James Blake in the previous two rounds. 

I never played three matches in a row at this level, Gonzalez told a news conference. Ive been playing really good, serving really well and hitting my forehand all around the court. 

Gonzalez, 26, said he was not surprised by his form. There is no secret, he said. Ive been working at trying to stay calm at important moments. Ive been really improving in the last month, working hard with my coach. 

The Chilean acknowledged he still relied on his forehand as his main attacking stroke. 

I won a lot of points with my forehand and that was the key to the match. My forehand is my weapon but Ive also been working a lot on my slice, trying to keep the ball really low so I can get into the net. 

Gonzalez said he was aware Nadal was struggling with injuries but did not feel they affected the outcome of the match. 

He was moving well, hes a great fighter and runs a lot, Gonzalez said after improving his career record against Nadal to three wins in four matches. 

Gonzalez will play German 12th seed Tommy Haas in the semi-finals. Tommy is a great player and we know that its going to be a tough match, he said. We have very similar games, we are baseline players but we try to go in.

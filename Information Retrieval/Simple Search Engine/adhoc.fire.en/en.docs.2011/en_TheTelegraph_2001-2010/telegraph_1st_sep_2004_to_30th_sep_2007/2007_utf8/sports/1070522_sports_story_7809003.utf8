 How Drogba inspired Chelsea

London: Didier Drogba backed his words with deeds, following up his inspirational pre-match speech with an FA Cup-winning display. 

Chelsea captain John Terry revealed that Drogbas most significant contribution on Saturday when he delivered an emotional address before the final. He went on to score the winner late in extra-time. 

The Ivory Coast striker called his teammates into a huddle moments before kick-off against Manchester United in an attempt to help settle any nerves. He admitted he was feeling anxious about the 90 minutes ahead, but would never stop fighting for the side and called for the same commitment from the rest of the team. 

Terry was convinced that was exactly what Chelseas players needed to hear as they prepared to dredge up one final effort from their weary bodies at the end of a gruelling campaign. 

Didi called everyone together and it was a great speech, Terry said. He said, guys Im nervous, were all nervous but one things for sure: Im going to fight and give everything. Not for anyone else but for every player. 

He looked them in the eye and it touched people. It was very good. We didnt know he was going to do it. He just called everyone together. 

Hes unbelievable. Hes just such a great guy, on and off the pitch. 

Drogba was keen to play down his Churchillian speech. 

It was just between us, he said. This is what we have to keep because its not easy to be a Chelsea player and we know that. We are all together and everybody tried to keep working hard. 

Our spirit has always been there. Its difficult to lose a Champions League semi-final and come here two weeks after to win the FA Cup final against the champions he said. (AFP)

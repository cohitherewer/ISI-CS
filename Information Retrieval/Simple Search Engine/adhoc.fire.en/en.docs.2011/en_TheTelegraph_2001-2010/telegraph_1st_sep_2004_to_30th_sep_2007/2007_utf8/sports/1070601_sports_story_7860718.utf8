 Mahesh-Radek in Round II

Paris: Mahesh Bhupathi and Radek Stepanek upset the 12th seeded pair of Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski in straight sets to move into the second round (mens doubles) of the French Open here on Thursday. 

The unseeded Indo-Cezch pair beat their fancied Polish rivals 6-4, 6-0. 

Earlier, Leander Paes and Martin Damm quelled the challenge of local hopes Jeremy Chardy and Jonathan Eysseric 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-2) to advance into the second round, as reported in Thursdays Late City edition. 

Paes and Damm were stretched by the local combination but the Indo-Czech duos experience saw them through. 

Paes and Damm will face the winners of the match between Michael Kohlmann and Rainer Schuettler of Germany and the Russian-Chilean pair of Teimuraz Gabashvili and Nicolas Massu.

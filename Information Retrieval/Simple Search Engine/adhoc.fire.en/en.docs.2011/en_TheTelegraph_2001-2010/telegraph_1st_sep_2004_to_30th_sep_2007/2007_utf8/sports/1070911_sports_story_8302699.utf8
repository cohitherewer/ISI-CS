Calcutta: Bengal allrounder Manoj Tiwary considers the forthcoming South Africa A home series as a golden opportunity to make his way back into the national side. 

Tiwary, who on Monday afternoon flew to Delhi to join the squad, termed this as the best chance of his life. I know that if I can prove myself, I can again be part of the national side, he said. 

India A are scheduled to play two four-day matches followed by three limited-over games against the South Africa A side. The first match begins on Thursday at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in New Delhi. 

Confident of a good allround performance in the series, the 21-year old Bengal captain said: I am confident of doing well and I know that I have to deliver in all the three departments (batting, bowling and fielding) I have no option left now. 

I am mentally and physically fit to deliver my best, he added after signing for the Mohun Bagan club for this season. It is learnt that Tiwary, who represented Sporting Union for last three years, has been offered a record sum. 

Conceding that getting into the national side in the forthcoming home series against Australia is always on the back of his mind, Tiwary said: Yes, that obviously is my sole goal I have to score runs and prove that I am in the same touch as I was during the Bangladesh tour. 

Tiwary has been included in the India A squad after recovering from a shoulder injury which he sustained during the Indias Bangladesh tour, last May. 

With former Bengal coach, Paras Mhambrey taking over as the India A coach, Tiwary believes that it would be an added advantage for him.

 Pawar now says winning and losing is part of the game

Pune: Three days ago he promised harsh decisions in the wake of Indias disastrous performance in the cricket World Cup, but BCCI president Sharad Pawar on Tuesday softened his tone to say winning and losing is part of the game. 

Even England, the country from where the game originated, has not won the World Cup so far. But their players were not subjected to mindless protests and condemnation by cricket fans, he said on the sidelines of a function here. 

Pawar maintained that Indian cricket teams performance was below par and he was not very happy with it. He also disapproved of the media hype that preceded the tournament, contributing to the pressure on the team. 

Our players should not play under tension. Before their match, Rahul Dravid told me on phone that all team members were under tremendous pressure to perform. 

We have to accept that Bangladesh are a much improved team who had beaten both Australia and Sri Lanka. 

On the future of Greg Chappell as Indias coach, Pawar said his term was coming to an end and a decision on extension or otherwise would be taken after the deliberations of BCCI meeting scheduled for April 6-7. 

On the choice of coach, Pawar said a decision in this regard would be taken after consulting all concerned, including former India captains. 

It does not matter whether the coach is Indian or foreign as long as he is able to train the team and boost its morale, he said. 

Taking a soft line on the commercial endorsements by Indian cricketers, the BCCI president said there is a tendency to exaggerate this issue. There is nothing wrong in the players earning money through endorsement, so long as they can do it. 

The board would also spend Rs 50 crore on training and scholarships of promising young cricketers in an effort to groom them for future, Pawar said.

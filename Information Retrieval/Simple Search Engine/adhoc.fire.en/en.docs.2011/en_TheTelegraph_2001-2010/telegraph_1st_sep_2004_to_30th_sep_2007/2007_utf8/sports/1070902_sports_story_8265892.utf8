 Ranty Martins, Olushola hospitalised 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Dempo Sports Club striker Ranty Martins and Sporting Clube de Goas new Nigerian recruit Olushola Ogunari have been hospitalised on Friday night after they suffered food poisoning. 

The Nigerian duo had severe lose motion and vomiting after they had food in a local restaurant in Goa. 

It is a kind of setback for both the Goan teams as they are preparing to leave for the Federation Cup to be held in Ludhiana from September 4. 

According to Sporting Clube de Goa coach Clifford Chukwuma, Ogunari will not be available for the opening match against Army XI. I dont think Olushola will be able to play. He will miss the first game for sure, the coach said. Since last night, they have been vomiting. I have no clue when they will get back on their feet. 

On the other hand, Dempo coach Armando Colaco was hopeful that Ranty will definitely play in their first match against Chirag United on September 6. Hopefully, Ranty should recover by then, he said. 

Meanwhile, Sporting Clube de Goa suffered another jolt on the eve of the Federation Cup when their star striker Dudu Omagbemi decided to join a club in Poland. 

According to Sporting sources, Dudu is joining Polish club Wista Krakow SSA on a three-year deal. He is now awaiting the ITC clearance.

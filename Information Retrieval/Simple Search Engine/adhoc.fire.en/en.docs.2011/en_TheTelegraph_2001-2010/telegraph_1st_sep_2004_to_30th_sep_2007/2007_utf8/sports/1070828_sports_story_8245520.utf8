The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bengal squad to be picked today 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Bengal selectors will pick a new-look squad for the Moin-ud-Dowlah Gold Cup, following the exodus of some key players to the Indian Cricket League. 

With Deep Dasgupta, who had led the side to back-to-back Ranji Trophy finals, deciding to join the new league, young Wriddhiman Saha is all set to stand behind the stumps for Bengal in the tournament, starting in Hyderabad on September 4. 

Soham Ghosh, Arindam Ghosh and Partha Sarathi Bhattacharya may also make the senior cut to shoulder batting responsibility in absence of Abhishek Jhunjhunwala and Shubhomay Das. 

Left-arm spinner Iresh Saxena is another player waiting for the big league entry. 

Laxmi Ratan Shukla, who has backed out despite showing up in the ICL function in Mumbai, is out of reckoning with injury and Manoj Tiwary will lead the side in Hyderabad. 

Meanwhile, Deep and five others will leave for Chennai on Wednesday for the ICL camp.

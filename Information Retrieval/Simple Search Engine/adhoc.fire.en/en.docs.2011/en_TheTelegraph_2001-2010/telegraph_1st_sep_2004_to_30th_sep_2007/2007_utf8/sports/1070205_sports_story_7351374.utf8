 We have the X-factor: Sangakkara

Mumbai: Sri Lankan vice-captain Kumar Sangakkara says his side has an all-round attack and the X-factor to succeed in the upcoming four-match one-day series against India. 

Sangakkara said while the visitors boasted a variety of pacers, the arrival of sling-shot Lasith Malinga in particular had given their bowling the extra ammunition to blast out any line-up. Malinga has brought that X-factor into the side, that bit of unpredictability, the wicketkeeper-batsman said. 

He bowls at 150 kmph-plus regularly. He is very accurate and got a very positive attitude. 

That rubs off on all the guys in the team and when we play with him we tend to be a bit more aggressive, a bit more positive, follow him along. 

We have got an all-round pace attack. We got a good balance, got guys who bowl fast and guys who bowl line and length. Even those who bowl fast are pretty accurate and have come a long way. 

Sangakkara said the team from the Emerald Isle had the confidence from consistent performances in recent months going into the series. 

Our confidence is pretty high with us playing good cricket for the last six months. We have been improving steadily, he said. 

Its just been a case of challenging ourselves, getting out of comfort zones and making sure we do everything right. So all the guys are looking forward to a good competition, said Sangakkara after his team defeated Mumbai XI by a 156-run margin in a warm-up tie, on Sunday. 

We are talking of a very well balanced pace attack. But performance in one-day cricket depends on how well you do on a particular day and how well you prepare for it, Sangakkara said. 

We all get confidence from the fact that the bowlers have been doing well. Lets see what happens in the first ODI in Calcutta (February 8). 

He did not feel that Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah Muralidharan would miss out on the India experience ahead of the World Cup. They have played such a long time for Sri Lanka and four more matches, I dont think, would make a difference as long as they put hours in practice and do the preparations very well, he said. 

They are taking a break from games but not from training. Back home they are working very hard. If we can safeguard those two people who are kind of lynchpins in our side we will have a great chance in the World Cup. 

Welcoming the series ahead of the World Cup, he said: Any kind of cricket before a big tournament is good because you tend to keep good habit and the more cricket you play the better prepared you are. 

He felt after Tom Moodys entry as coach the Lankan attitude to fielding had changed but not skills, and they had become more aggressive in attacking the batsmen. 

Our change has been more in our attitude than skills. We had always been a good fielding side. Just that little shift in attitude that has made us a more focused unit. We have little competitions going to see who turns up trumps in a game, and who turns up trumps in practice. When you introduce a bit of competition the guys lift themselves, so we have changed our attitude, become a bit more aggressive on the field. We dont fall back on the circle, we keep coming at the batsmen, he elaborated. 

He also said the Lankan batsmen were prepared to play at any position in the order when asked about captain Jayawardene opening the innings in the warm-up game. 

You never know. But everyone is prepared to bat at any position. It doesnt matter whether you are used to one position throughout your career. 

Thats what we try and work on, coming out of our comfort zones and making sure that no one gets comfortable in one set matter and always try and improve. The final decision is of the coach and the captain, he said.

 India to play SA in Ireland

Mumbai: India will play South Africa in a three-match, one-day International series in Ireland in June, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said on Thursday. 

[The Telegraph had reported on Thursday that India were likely to play South Africa in the three-match series.] 

Indias original opposition for the series were Australia, but Shah said that was never finalised. 

We were in discussions with everyone, including Sri Lanka. We played against Australia (in Malaysia last year), so we thought well play against South Africa now, he said. 

Shah said the dates have not been fixed yet, but would be in the last week of June. 

India will also play Pakistan in a one-off, one-dayer in Glasgow before heading for England in July for three Tests and seven one-day Internationals. 

Shah brushed aside reports that the originally planned India-Australia series had fallen through because Cricket Australia asked for an equal share of the revenue.

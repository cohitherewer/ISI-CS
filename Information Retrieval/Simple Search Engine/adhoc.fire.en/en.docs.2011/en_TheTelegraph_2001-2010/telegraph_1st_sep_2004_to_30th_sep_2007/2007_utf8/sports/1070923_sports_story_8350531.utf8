 Summons for Inzy

Ivo Tennant

Inzamam-ul Haq, the Pakistan captain when they were accused of ball-tampering at the Brit Oval last year, was served with a witness summons at Headingley Carnegie Friday that will compel his attendance for cross-examination at the Central Office of London Tribunals next month. 

Darrell Hair, one of the umpires in the final Test of the series against England, is suing the ICC and Pakistan Cricket Board for racial discrimination. Hair has not officiated in an international match since then. 

Finers Stephens Innocent, his lawyers, wrote to Inzamam requesting his attendance, but did not receive a reply. The summons was served in the presence of Stewart Regan, the chief executive of Yorkshire, for whom Inzamam is playing. 

He now has to decide whether to fly back to Pakistan and return to England before the hearing commences on October 1, or stay in London. 

Witness expenses can be recovered from the tribunal. 

If Inzamam had remained in Pakistan rather than play county cricket, the tribunal would not have had the power to call him. The hearing is expected to last for two weeks.

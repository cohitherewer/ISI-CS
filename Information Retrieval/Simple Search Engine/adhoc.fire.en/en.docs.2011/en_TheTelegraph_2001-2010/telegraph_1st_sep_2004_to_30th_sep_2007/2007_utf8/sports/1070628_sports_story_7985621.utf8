 Butt promotion irks seniors

Karachi: Salman Butts surprise elevation as the vice-captain of the Pakistan cricket team has triggered dissent in the side with sources in the team claiming that senior players are sulking over the appointment. 

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has spent the last few days trying to put up a bold face, saying there is no discord over Butts appointment as Shoaib Maliks deputy till the end of the year. 

Shahid Afridi, Abdul Razzaq and Mohammed Asif are particularly upset with the decision, sources in the team said. These players are not happy although Mohammed Yousuf the senior most player in the side has decided to keep quiet for the moment. But the fact is that the mutterings and whispering campaigns have already started in the team, one source said. 

Afridi, apparently, is the most upset as he had the backing of selectors for the job but was overlooked by the board. 

Butt has played only 14 Tests and 36 one-dayers since his debut in 2003 because of his inconsistent form and still does not have a regular place in the side. 

Sources said things worsened in Abbotabad when, after an argument over seating arrangement in the team bus, Afridi refused to return to Lahore. He told the manager he was not going and he (Talat) can do what he wanted, sources said. 

Ali has taken pains to assure that all was well with the team but he himself has admitted to being involved in an argument with Afridi in the team bus over the seemingly simple issue of seat occupation. (PTI)

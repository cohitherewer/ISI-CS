The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Chima in dark about Mehraj

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Seeing a barefooted Chima Okerie in Mohun Bagan practice is a bit amusing, but the Nigerian was caught on the wrong foot on the issue of Mehrajuddin Wadao on Tuesday. 

The defender featured very much in the coachs plans for the match against Tampines Rovers till the morning practice session on Monday. 

The reality was that Mehrajuddin was not registered with the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) for the match and the coach was kept in the dark about it. 

Is it? But I dont know anything about it at all, Chima asked in utter surprise, when the subject of Mehrajuddins non-availability was brought to his notice.

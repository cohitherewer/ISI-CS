 Ed Joyce ready for strange encounter 

Gros Islet: England opener Ed Joyce said it would be strange to face his former Ireland teammates in the World Cup second stage following his match-winning contribution against Kenya on Saturday. 

Dublin-born Joyce played for Ireland in the ICC Trophy for minor cricket nations between 2001 and 2005 and his performances were key in helping them reach this tournament. 

However, the left-hander switched to England in 2006 in the hope of playing Tests and more one-day series. 

Ironically his first one-day cap was against Ireland in June last year and he will now face them again in Guyana next Friday after Irelands surprise qualification following a shock win over Pakistan. 

Its obviously a bit of a strange one being an Irishman, he said. But my first game for England was against Ireland so hopefully Ive got that out of my system. 

Joyce, who scored 66 in Sundays win over Canada after a duck against New Zealand, was pleased with his return to form. Im just pretty happy with the way Im playing at the moment. Ive got two fifties in the last two games so hopefully I can just continue on against Ireland. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Big bucks and captaincy

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: There seems to be no end to the big bucks in cricket and its widely believed that the Team India captaincy brings with it the unstated perk of climbing the endorsements ladder. 

However, the reality is quite removed from the janatas assumption. A case in point being Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the Twenty20 captain who has also been given the top job in ODIs. 

According to management company Gameplan, which handles Dhonis commercial interests, there hasnt really been a queue Tuesday onwards, the day he got promoted. 

Right now, Dhonis appointment is only for the 12 ODIs at home (versus Australia and Pakistan). So, while companies have approached us after he got the ODI captaincy too, we havent actually been flooded with calls to negotiate fresh deals 

Generally, people have adopted a wait-and-watch policy Things could change if Dhoni gets a longer tenure. Also, to an extent, theres a corelation between individual endorsements and the teams collective performance, a spokesman for the management company told The Telegraph on Saturday. 

He added: Its worth noting that Rahul Dravids stock hasnt fallen because he has chosen not to captain any more 

Dhoni is No. 3 (among cricketers) in terms of earnings from endorsements behind numero uno Sachin Tendulkar and Dravid. 

Apparently, the difference between Dravid and Dhoni isnt as much as between Sachin and Dravid. 

Sachin, clearly, cant be touched not in the near future, at least. By the end of this season, it will be known whether the No.2 position is going to have a new occupant.

 Were not in a comfort zone: Dravid

 - The left-armers are a huge threat when the ball is swinging: Vaughan

Rival captains Rahul Dravid and Michael Vaughan interacted with the media (at the Brit Oval) on Wednesday afternoon. 

The following are excerpts: 

 DRAVID: I wouldnt say were in a 

 comfort zone... Were excited and realise that England 

 are going to bounce back... Theyll be hurt by the 

 Trent Bridge loss and are going to come back hard... 

Were just focusing on five days of good cricket, not that weve got a chance to win the series... If the weather stays good, then 450 overs will be enough for a decisive result... 

Were taking to the Test with the mindset that theres going to be a result and we can win... We arent looking to draw... However, Im not thinking of the past... That our last series win in England was 21 years ago... Those things will come up when the job is done... 

Yes, I did well here on the last tour (217 in the only Indian innings, in 2002)... Ive got good memories... Such memories inspire, motivate... 

Usually, the Oval has good wickets... Theres something in it for everybody and theres an opportunity for good cricket... The wicket is fair, but one may have to adjust and adapt to the extra bounce... 

Who knows whether this is going to be Sachin Tendulkars last Test in England... He has given a lot of pleasure to people across the world, not just in England... Im sure he would like to go out on a high... 

The lack of form can bother you, but its different when the team is winning... As in the past, Ill be trying to do my best... Id like to go out and make an impact. 

 VAUGHAN: Its a great challenge for the 

 team... Were 0-1 down against a decent Indian team... 

 This ground has produced some great cricket over the years 

 (just two draws in the last 11 Tests) and with the weather 

 being good, we know a result is going to take its natural 

 course... 

Weve played some decent cricket in this series, but havent got big first innings scores... Thats a challenge... Getting runs on the board is very important and if we can do that, then weve got enough in our attack to force a result... 

Stuart Broad is in contention but, if Im honest, if everyone gets through the night without picking up a virus, well probably go in with the same team... 

I feel Ive been playing well... Feel in control at the crease... But you know that you start (afresh) on nought... 

Zaheer Khan did very well for Worcestershire last year and, so, we knew he would be a big threat... We hadnt seen much of R.P. Singh... The left-armers are a huge threat when the ball is swinging... Theyve got the ball to swing and thats why theyve made it difficult for us... 

Ive looked back at the last Test (Trent Bridge) and I do think there were a couple of occasions where we got close to stepping over the line... As international cricketers, we must not cross the line... 

I dont want to see swearing on the pitch, but Id still want to see the bowlers doing a bit of gamesmanship and chirping... However, its wrong to swear at and attack a player.

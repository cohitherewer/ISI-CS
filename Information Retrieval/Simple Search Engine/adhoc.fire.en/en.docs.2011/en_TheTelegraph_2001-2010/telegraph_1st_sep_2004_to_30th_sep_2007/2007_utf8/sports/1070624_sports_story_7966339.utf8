 Snow best in Cup 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Trainer 

 S.Padmanabhans Rhapsidion Snow won the Karnataka Sub-Area 

 Cup in Bangalore on Saturday. The trainer, however, missed 

 out a smart treble when his winner, Southern Charge, was 

 disqualified by the stewards, in the Manjri Stud Plate, 

 following dangerous riding tactics of his jockey, M.Zahra.

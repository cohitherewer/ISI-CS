 Bates back in Leeds control

London: Ken Bates won his battle to regain control of Leeds United on Wednesday when his group of investors bought the debt-ridden third division club from administrators. 

The club was put up for sale last week after Britains Revenue and Customs service had challenged a proposal by chairman Bates to take it out of administration with an offer to creditors of eight pence in the pound. 

Administrators KPMG said the club, who are fallen giants of English football, had been sold to Leeds United Football Club Limited, headed by Ken Bates, for an undisclosed sum. 

Joint Administrator Richard Fleming added: We received several offers for the business which we considered carefully. 

The approved deal represents the best result for creditors in the circumstances and we believe provides the club with the best chance of survival. (Reuters)

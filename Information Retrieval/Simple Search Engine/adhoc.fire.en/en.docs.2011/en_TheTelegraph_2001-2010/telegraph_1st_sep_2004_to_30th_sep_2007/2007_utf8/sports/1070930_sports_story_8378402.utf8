The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Raja: Today, Yuvraj is the cleanest hitter 

 - Former Pakistan captain, who had TV assignments during the World Twenty20, picks his Dream XI 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Bangalore: Former Pakistan captain (and ex-chief executive of the Board) Rameez Raja was in South Africa during the just-ended World Twenty20. Another TV assignment has drawn him to India and, on Saturday, he chose his Dream Twenty20 XI. 

The following are excerpts from Rameezs interaction with The Telegraph: 

On whether, after the success of the World Twenty20, Test cricket and ODIs are under threat 

The ICC must ensure a balance and needs to control the impact of Twenty20... Its a good form to attract a new audience... Its a good vehicle for globalisation... Its a good form to get youngsters involved... Theres space for all three, but the Twenty20 shouldnt be overdone. As theres so much entertainment and the stroke-filled game is so fast, people are bound to get attracted. 

On whether Twenty20 can actually improve the quality of cricket 

Indeed, yes... The batsmen are going to use their feet a lot more and will hit more cleanly... The bowlers have a challenge ahead of them and weve already seen the improvement in fielding (during the World Twenty20). The impact is definitely going to be positive. 

On his Dream Twenty20 XI (in batting order) 

Gautam Gambhir: Was consistent throughout the tournament and showed good temperament... Can deliver in the big matches and has a big heart. 

Matthew Hayden: Was the tournaments highest scorer and has such an imposing presence at the top... He has the ability to fire on any wicket and do so consistently. 

Kevin Pietersen: Is so talented that he can take the game away from the opposition at any stage. 

Misbah-ul Haq: Hes probably the best in situations where the team is chasing... He has the ability to perform under pressure and, as weve seen, Twenty20 games can get very tight. 

Yuvraj Singh: Well, he can change the course of a match inside six balls... Today, hes the cleanest hitter... In fact, hes so classy and a joy to watch. 

Mahendra Singh Dhoni: Hes efficient behind the stumps and is a good batsman... So, hed be my wicketkeeper-batsman. 

Shahid Afridi: Because of his style, hes best suited for Twenty20... Down the order, hes tremendous with the bat and can be counted upon with the ball as well. Plus, hes a good fielder. 

Irfan Pathan: Its to strengthen the batting that Ive chosen him and not a specialist bowler... Hes learnt things the hard way and, in the World Twenty20, made a nice comeback... Technically and mentally, he has come back stronger. 

Daniel Vettori: Was the best spinner on view in the World Twenty20... Actually, he was brilliant and is quite handy with the bat too. 

Umar Gul: Probably the best new ball-bowler in the tournament... He was quick and fired lethal yorkers... As important, he didnt crack under pressure. 

Rudra Pratap Singh: He has the ability to take wickets upfront and, clearly, is a much more intelligent bowler now than when I saw him on the 2005-06 tour of Pakistan... He swings the ball well and is pacy. 

On his Dream XI captain 

Dhoni... For his calmness... He never allowed pressure to get to him and was outstanding in the World Twenty20... 

Finally, on the World Twenty20 moments he wont forget 

(Grins) Yuvrajs six sixes in an over (off Stuart Broad)... Just watching it in person was awesome... Then, I wont forget the two India versus Pakistan matches (group league stage and the final)... Both had so much excitement and brought out the essence of Twenty20.

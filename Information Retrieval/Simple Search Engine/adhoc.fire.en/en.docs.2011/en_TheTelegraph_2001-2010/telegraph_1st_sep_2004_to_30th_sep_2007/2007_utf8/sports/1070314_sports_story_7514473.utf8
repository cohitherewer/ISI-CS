 Kallis: Playing in four editions an absolute bonus

Frigate Bay: Jacques Kallis will join the elite ranks of South Africans who have played in four World Cups when his team takes on The Netherlands in St Kitts on Friday. 

Fellow allrounder Shaun Pollock will also earn his membership of the club in the West Indies assuming both remain fit and are selected. 

Fast bowling great Allan Donald and fielding ace Jonty Rhodes, who have both retired, are the other two South Africans with four World Cups to their credit. I would have been happy to have played in one World Cup so to play in four is an absolute bonus, Kallis told reporters at South Africas training session on Tuesday. 

Kallis said the already considerable intensity of playing international cricket was heightened further during the global showpiece of the one-day game. The pressure of playing in a World Cup is so much greater because the eyes of the whole cricketing world are on you, he said. 

Batsmen would need to make the most of any advantage they were handed by the conditions during the tournament, Kallis pointed out. 

Generally, conditions in the West Indies arent great for batting, he said. So when you do get on a good deck youve got to make it count. 

South Africa bore the brunt of lively pitches in their warm-up games against Ireland, where they dwindled to 91 for eight before recovering to 192 and victory by 35 runs, and against Pakistan, who beat them by seven wickets. 

Conditions werent great in our warm-up games, Kallis said. We would have liked to have more time in the middle but its not the end of the world. Once you make it past the new ball, conditions for batting do become better. 

The tournament culminates in the final in Bridgetown, Barbados on April 28. Kallis agreed that the event was lengthy, but said that might help players who were injured during the tournament. 

It is a long tournament and I suppose thats not ideal, he said.

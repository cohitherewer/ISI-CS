 Flintoff not ready to give up drinking

Melbourne: He promises never to be out in the sea again sloshed, but Andrew Flintoff is not ready to give up drinking so what if it may have cost him the England vice-captaincy. 

Flintoff, who had to be rescued from the sea after falling off a pedal boat in an inebriated state, was stripped off the vice-captaincy and dropped from the match against Canada for breaching team discipline. 

The incident occurred hours after England lost their opening World Cup match to New Zealand. 

Flintoff repeatedly apologised for the misdemeanour and promised to keep things under control, but has also made it clear that giving up alcohol for the rest of the tournament was certainly not on the cards. 

All I can say and do is hold my hands up and say sorry. I am not going to say I am going to have an alcohol-free trip. A glass of wine with my dinner is one thing and the events of Friday night quite another, Flintoff was quoted as saying by an Australian paper.

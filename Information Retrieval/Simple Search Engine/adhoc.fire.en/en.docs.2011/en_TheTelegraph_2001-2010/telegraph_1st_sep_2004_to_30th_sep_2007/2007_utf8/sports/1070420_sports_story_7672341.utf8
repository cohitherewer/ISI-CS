Karachi: Former India coach John Wright has expressed his interest to take over as the coach of Pakistan team, a top PCB official said on Thursday. 

We have spoken to Wright on this issue and he was interested, the official said. 

The PCB is finding a suitable replacement for Bob Woolmer who died while in the West Indies with the World Cup squad last month. 

The board has still not ruled out the possibility of appointing a foreign coach in place of the late Woolmer. 

The official confirmed that several foreign and local candidates were under consideration including Wright, also a former captain of the New Zealand team. 

Wright was coach of the Indian team from 2000 to early 2005 and led the team to its first series win in Pakistan in 2004. 

The PCB official said Tim Boon who is with Leicestershire was another contender for the post. 

It has not been possible to reach a decision on the coach because there are many issues involved in this appointment. We will be very careful before taking a final decision, he said. 

Woolmer was found unconscious in his hotel room in Kingston, Jamaica, on March 18 and died later in hospital, a day after Pakistan were beaten by Ireland and eliminated from the World Cup. 

Woolmers death continues to remain a mystery and since passing away he has been eulogised in the Pakistani cricket circles with a memorial being held for him in Lahore and a hall and practice area being named after him in the National Cricket Academy in Lahore. 

He was coach of the Pakistan team from June 2004 till his death, although his contract was due to expire in late June this year. 

The PCB official said former Test pacer Aaqib Javed, former captain Intikhab Alam and some other locals were also being discussed. 

The board, he said, might even appoint a temporary coach for next months one-day series against Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi before making a long-term appointment.

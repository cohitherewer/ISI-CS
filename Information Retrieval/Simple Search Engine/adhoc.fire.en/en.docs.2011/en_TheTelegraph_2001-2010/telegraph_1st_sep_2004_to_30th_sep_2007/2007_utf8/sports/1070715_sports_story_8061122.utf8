 Dope tests in September

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) will conduct out-of-competition dope tests on the 30 probables for the ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa in September. 

A PCB official said on Saturday that the dope tests would be conducted soon as part of Pakistans zero tolerance policy against drugs in sports. 

Meanwhile, Pakistan played down Shoaib Akhtars criticism of a new no-ball rule as his personal opinion. The free hit rule after a front foot no-ball in ODIs was endorsed at an ICC meeting and Pakistan agreed to the change, PCB director of operations Zakir Khan said. (AGENCIES)

 Indonesia lose to Saudi Arabia

Bangkok: Saudi Arabia inflicted a cruel injury-time defeat on hosts Indonesia and put one foot in the Asian Cup quarter finals Saturday with a dramatic 2-1 win. 

In Saturdays other fixture, Uzbekistan crushed Malaysia 5-0 in group C to eliminate the co-hosts from the competition after just two games. 

Saudi Arabia were good value for their victory, dominating the last half hour of the match, but the nature of the defeat was tough for Indonesia, which had performed doggedly, and the 88,000 fans at Gelora Bung Karno Stadium. 

The result leaves three-time winners Saudi Arabia atop group D with 4 points, and on the brink of the quarter finals. 

Indonesia, who have three points, now need to pick up points against Asian giants South Korea in their final game to progress.

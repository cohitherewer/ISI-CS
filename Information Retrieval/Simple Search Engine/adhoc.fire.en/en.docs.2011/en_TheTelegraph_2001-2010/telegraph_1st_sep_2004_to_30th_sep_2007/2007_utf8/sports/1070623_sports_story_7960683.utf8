 Tough contests await India 

Antwerp: A revamped India renew their bid to get back into the elite bracket of world hockey when they begin their campaign in the six-nation FIH Champions Challenge with a game against New Zealand here on Saturday. 

Coach Joaquim Carvalho expressed confidence that his wards would deliver the goods even if some tough contests were on the card. 

The stakes are obviously high as this tournament gives us a chance to qualify for the 2008 Champions Trophy and also a favourable draw for the Olympic qualifying tournament next year. 

It is going to be a tough competition, but I am confident of a strong showing here, the Indian coach said after the teams arrival here last night following a 10-day training sojourn in Germany. 

Also at stake are valuable FIH ranking points. India, winners of the inaugural Champions Challenge tournament in 2001, are currently ranked eighth with 1,293 points, behind Argentina (seventh, 1,325) and followed by England (ninth, 1,249), New Zealand (10th, 1,220), Japan (12th, 825) and Belgium (13th, 801). 

Saturdays fixtures (IST): India vs New Zealand (5.15pm); Belgium vs Japan (7.30pm); England vs Argentina (10pm).

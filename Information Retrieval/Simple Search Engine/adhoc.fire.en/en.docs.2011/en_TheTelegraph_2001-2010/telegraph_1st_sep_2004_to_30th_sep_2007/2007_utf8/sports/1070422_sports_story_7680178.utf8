 Atwal crashes out

Avondale: Daniel Chopra turned in a tidy four-under 68 to move into tied sixth place, but the struggle continued for Arjun Atwal as he shot a forgettable 82 and missed the cut by a long margin at the Zurich Classic golf tournament. 

Chopras putter was on song as he needed just 24 putts for a round of four-under 68. He found only 61 per cent greens in regulation but his putting was superb. He started well with birdies on second and fourth and then added three more on 10th, 13th and 15th as he went five-under. 

A late bogey on par-3 17th saw him drop to four-under but that helped him get to tied sixth place. (PTI)

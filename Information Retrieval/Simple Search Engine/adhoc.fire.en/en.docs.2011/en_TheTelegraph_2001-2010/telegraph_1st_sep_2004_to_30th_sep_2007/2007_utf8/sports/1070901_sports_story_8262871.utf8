The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Rahul has to bat at No. 3, Yuvraj at 4

 - It may not look nice if I call with my thoughts: Vengsarkar 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: The senior selection committee chairman, Dilip Vengsarkar, favours Rahul Dravid at No. 3, followed by Yuvraj Singh. 

Both are, of course, in form. 

Vengsarkar, however, isnt keen on conveying that personally either to the captain or his own colleagues (Sanjay Jagdale, Ranjib Biswal) whore on duty in the ODI series. 

My view is that Rahul has to bat at No. 3 and Yuvraj must be our regular No. 4 Dinesh Karthik should be at No. 6 (after Mahendra Singh Dhoni) Having said that, it may not look nice if I call with my thoughts as the ones closest to the action know best, Vengsarkar, whod been in England during the Test series, told The Telegraph on Friday. 

Dravid at No. 3 with Yuvraj next hasnt been seen in any of the first four matches. Three remain. 

Yuvraj, though, took guard at No. 3 and Dravid followed in Bristol the only ODI won by the Indians. While Yuvraj scored 49, Dravid registered an unbeaten 92. 

Speaking some hours after Team India suffered another defeat (to trail 1-3), Vengsarkar added: The Old Trafford wicket wasnt all that batsman-friendly and, so, Id been confident 212 would be a winning total Yet, we couldnt do it even after reducing England to 114 for seven I couldnt believe what I was seeing (on the TV) 

However, being an optimist, Vengsarkar maintained all wasnt lost. In the same breath, he agreed that the fielding had been embarrassing. 

Frankly, I dont know what to comment The desire to improve has to come from within Just because theres a fielding coach (Robin Singh) doesnt mean everybody is going to become a Jonty Rhodes 

A coach can only do so much Its a clich, but while you may take a horse to the water, you cant force him to drink The horse has to do so himself 

Vengsarkar, who is known to talk straight, remarked he was very disappointed that Ajit Agarkar and Ramesh Powar hadnt been contributing with the bat. 

Each of them has featured in three matches and, collectively, their contribution stands at a paltry 31. 

Agarkar has a Test hundred (Lords, 2002) and Ive seen Powar play handy innings But theyve been failing in every ODI, making the tail look longer than it actually is On the other hand, look at what Ravi Bopara and Stuart Broad did last (Thursday) night 

The young pair added a match-winning 99 for the unfinished eighth wicket, a performance fit for Ripleys Believe It Or Not! 

While Indias wait for an allrounder continues, England have unearthed another: 21-year-old Stuart, son of former opener (and present-day Match Referee) Chris, who was present at Old Trafford. 

The way MoM Stuart batted wouldve done his father proud and he has helped put England, underdogs when the series got underway last week, on the way up the ICC rankings ladder. 

The last bilateral ODI series, in early 2006, had seen Dravid and Co. trample England 5-1.

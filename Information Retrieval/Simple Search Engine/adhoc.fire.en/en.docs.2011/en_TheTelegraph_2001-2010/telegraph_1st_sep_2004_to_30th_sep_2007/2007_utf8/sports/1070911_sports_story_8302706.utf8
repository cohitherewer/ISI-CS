 South Africa wary of West Indies

Johannesburg: The first ever ICC World Twenty20 championship will commence on Tuesday, when host South Africa face the West Indies in the opening game of the 12-team competition. 

The West Indies will look to Dwayne Bravo as their star performer. 

Graeme Smiths home team will be wary of the West Indies who stunned them in the opening match of the 2003 World Cup in Cape Town, a defeat that cost the hosts a place in the second round. Hope we can do something like that again, said Marlon Samuels.

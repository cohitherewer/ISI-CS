 Owen brace in 3-0 win

Michael Owen left Russia reeling like a bear with a sore head on Wednesday night, the England striker twice showing his magnificent predatory instincts to put Steve McClarens men back on track to qualify for Euro 2008. The poacher also turned goal-maker, setting up Rio Ferdinand to really get the party started at Wembley. 

When Owen came calling in the first half, Russias centre-halves displayed all the woodenness of Babushka dolls. Poor in the air, slow on the ground, they were left utterly exposed when Englands No. 10 gained possession, and utterly distraught at his emphatic finishes. 

In typically clinical fashion, Owen lifted his international tally to 40 goals in 85 appearances, within sight of Jimmy Greaves 44. Greaves would certainly have enjoyed Owens nervelessness and accuracy in placing the ball past Russias hapless goalkeeper, Viacheslav Malafeev. 

If Russias marking was non-existent, the visitors also paid for Guus Hiddinks cautious first-half tactics which invited England to attack, almost at will, with Gareth Barry again outstanding alongside Steven Gerrard. McClaren appears to have realised that partnerships work best, not a collection of individuals. Gerrard clearly enjoyed operating with Barry. 

This has not been a good few days for Frank Lampard. Ditto Wayne Rooney, who returns to the fray shortly for Manchester United, but must prove he can form a proper England alliance with Owen. 

Emile Heskey was terrific as the broadsword to Owens rapier, making his accomplices second with a powerful flick, and he deserves a continued run in the side. 

McClaren may have an unconvincing air in public, but no one can now question the belief coursing through his players. Suddenly, all the old doubts seem distant. England do boast some class acts, Gerrard and Owen in particular. A summer sojourn in the Alps looms into focus. 

[In other action across Europe, French sporting pride took another hammering when Scotland won 1-0 in Paris on Wednesday to leave Frances Euro 2008 qualifying hopes in the balance, add agencies. Scotland, who beat France 1-0 in Glasgow, are now the unlikely leaders of the group from Italy who showed their mettle to beat Ukraine 2-1 in Kiev. France are sweating in third. 

Champions Greece drew 2-2 with Norway in group C while Germany now have one foot in the finals thanks to the Czech Republics 1-0 win over Ireland. 

The Netherlands needed a stoppage-time winner from Ruud van Nistelrooy in Albania to go joint top of group G with Romania. 

In group A leaders Poland drew 0-0 with second-placed Finland in Helsinki but Portugal failed to capitalise after Serbias Branislav Ivanovic scored a late goal to secure a 1-1 draw in Lisbon. 

Uefa, meanwhile, is expected to open a formal investigation into Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolaris behaviour during the match. 

When Portugal winger Ricardo Quaresma and Serbias Ivica Dragutinovic squared up to each other after the final whistle, Scolari intervened. 

TV pictures showed the Serb slapping away the Brazilians arm. In reply, Scolari aimed a left-handed punch at Dragutinovic.]

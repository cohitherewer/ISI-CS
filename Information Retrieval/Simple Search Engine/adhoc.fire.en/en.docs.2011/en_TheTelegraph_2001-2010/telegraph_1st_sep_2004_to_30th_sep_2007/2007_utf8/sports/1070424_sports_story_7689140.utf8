 Yousuf welcomes Malik appointment

Karachi: Despite being overlooked for captaincy, senior pro Mohammed Yousuf on Monday supported Pakistan Cricket Boards (PCBs) decision to appoint young allrounder Shoaib Malik as skipper, saying the move was futuristic. 

Yousuf, the seniormost player in the side with 75 Tests and 236 one-day Internationals under his belt, said he wanted to lead after the World Cup and was disappointed at not getting the captaincy, but keeping in mind the future, the PCB had taken the correct decision. 

I am confident this decision will produce good results, he told a television channel on Monday. 

I have no problems and I can assure Malik 100 per cent support. I also hope other senior players will support him wholeheartedly, he said. 

Yousuf, who enjoyed a record-breaking run last year, scoring over 1700 runs in 11 Tests with nine hundreds, also said he would like to see Malik continue as captain for a long period of time. 

Malik was named captain last week after Younis Khan refused to take up the mantle from Inzamam-ul Haq, who stepped down and retired from one-day Internationals in the wake of a disastrous World Cup campaign. 

Yousuf hoped that Malik would treat senior players with respect and show patience with the youngsters. 

He expressed dismay that in the ongoing World Cup, the sort of pitch on which Pakistan suffered a humiliating loss against minnows Ireland had not been seen again in the competition. 

It does raise questions that why we were forced to play on such a topsy-turvy seaming pitch. I would like to see the PCB talk to the ICC about this. 

There must be consistency in pitches prepared in a major tournament like the Champions Trophy or the World Cup, he said.

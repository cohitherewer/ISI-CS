 Atwal ends tied 16th

Bridgeport: A bogey spree crushed Arjun Atwals chances of having a top-five finish as he ended with a one-over 73 to be tied 16th at the National Mining Association Pete Dye Classic on nationwide tour. 

Atwal had bogeys from seventh to ninth besides another one on the 15th, taking his total to eight-under 280. 

Jimmy Walker pulled off one of the biggest comebacks to win by a stroke.

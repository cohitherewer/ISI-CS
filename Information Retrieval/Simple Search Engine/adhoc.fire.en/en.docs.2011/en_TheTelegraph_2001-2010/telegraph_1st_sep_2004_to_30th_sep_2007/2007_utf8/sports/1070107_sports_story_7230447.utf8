The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 He has proved a point... Hes more mature now

 - The one and only Barry Richards on Sourav Ganguly 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE

 Barry Richards 

Cape Town: The iconic Barry Richards is not known to mince words. A spade, therefore, is going to be called just that. On Saturday, during a Sourav Ganguly-specific chat with The Telegraph, he was candid as usual. 

The following are excerpts 

On Sourav emerging the highest rungetter (214 at an average of 42-plus) among Indians in the three-Test series 

It has been a bonus for India... I think Greg Chappell will be happy with the way Sourav played, but he has to sort out problems with the short-pitched deliveries... Till thats done, question marks are going to remain... The Newlands wicket suited Sourav, but full marks to him. Im not taking anything away from what he did in the series... He has proved a point by averaging over 40 and good luck to him. 

On whether hes surprised that Sourav became the topper 

Well, not really... Sourav had as much to prove coming back into the team as the others had to stay in it... He set out wanting to prove a point and Im sure he was driven by the desire to play the World Cup. As Ive said, he did well and hats off to him. 

On tips for handling the ones pitched short

Its a mental thing... Once you turn your head and take the eyes off the ball, then youre asking for trouble... Sourav wears a helmet, has the thigh guard and protection for the chest... He must tell himself he wont get injured even if hes hit... Its all in the mind and he has to convince himself... Has to watch till the last split second... Perhaps, Sourav should play squash and get into the habit of watching the ball till the last... The cure is mental because its the mind which influences technique. So, he has to train his mind to watch the short-pitched deliveries till the very end. 

On whether he liked any of the Sourav innings 

His comeback one, at the Wanderers, when he got that unbeaten 51... The wicket had been challenging, it was the most difficult of all three... Sourav was brave there... Whats disappointing both from his and the Indian point of view is that he couldnt really build on the starts... In six innings, he had two fifties and a forty... The hard part is getting to fifty, the next hardest part is to get from fifty to hundred... More runs translate to more confidence. 

On Sourav and one-day cricket 

He has done enough to convince people... I am sure hell be back and is going to stay till such time that somebody better comes along. Of course, he must work on his fielding... Souravs a fine catcher, but has to improve work on the ground... Generally, Indias fielding isnt good and cost quite a few runs. The South Africans, for example, couldve gained around 50 runs in each Test. 

Finally, on the future he sees for Sourav 

He has a few good years left within the cricket environment... Hes a more mature cricketer and theres that humility about him now... He can, hopefully, continue to contribute to Indian cricket.

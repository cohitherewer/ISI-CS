 Sao Paulo put 3 past JCT

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: For the first 45 minutes, it appeared the men from JCT could truly turn out to be the Superstars of India. In the second half, Sao Paulo made sure no one got an opportunity to question their Supermen status, at least in India. 

It was a day when nothing was conducive for good football. The pitch of the Ambedkar Stadium was slushy and waterlogged in some places. To add to it, the chilly wind and extreme overcast conditions further dampened the spirit. 

Yet, Sao Paulo Football Club from Brazil wrapped up their Super Soccer series campaign with a 3-0 victory, despite being at the receiving end of some unexpected resistance from the Punjab team. The courageous approach of the JCT boys caught the Brazilians on the wrong foot in the first session but they organised themselves well in the later half to keep their reputations intact. 

Goalkeeper Karanjit Singh was the pick of the lot for the local team, but he had no answer when Alex Francisco intercepted a cross from the left in the 65th minute to find the target with a terrific shot from just inside the box. 

 Francisco struck again 10 minutes later and Casao scored the third off a flag-kick in the 81st minute. 

In the five-match series, Sao Paulo have scored 17 goals without conceding any.

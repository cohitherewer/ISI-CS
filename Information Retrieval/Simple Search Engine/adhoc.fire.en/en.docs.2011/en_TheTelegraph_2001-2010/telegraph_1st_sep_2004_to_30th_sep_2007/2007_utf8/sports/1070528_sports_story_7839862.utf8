 Safin delivers a warning

Paris: Former world No. 1 Marat Safin signalled that he could threaten the favourites for the French Open title after brushing aside Spains Fernando Vicente 6-1, 6-3, 6-1 on Sunday to reach the second round before rain halted play for six hours. 

Serena Williams recovered from a sluggish start to beat Bulgarias Tsvetana Pironkova 5-7, 6-1, 6-1 in a rain-hit match. 

The Australian Open champion, who won the Paris tournament in 2002 but has missed it for the last two years, struggled at first against an opponent ranked a modest 91st in the world. Making clumsy errors, the eighth-seeded Williams dropped serve straightaway and found herself 2-5 down after just 28 minutes. 

The American then survived a set-point but Pironkova later earned three more, while leading 5-4, wasting all of them. 

The 19-year-old Pironkova, who beat Venus in the first round of last years Australian Open, did not give up and broke her opponent again to lead 6-5. 

The match was then stopped for nearly six hours because of rain. When it resumed, Pironkova won her service game to love to wrap up the set. 

The 25-year-old Williams then turned on the power, taking the second set 6-1 in 30 minutes with a service winner on set point. 

The decisive set was also a formality for Williams, who earned two match-points with a blistering return winner. 

She hit a return long on the first but on the second Pironkova fired a backhand wide to bow out after two hours 12 minutes of play. 

Justin Henin opened the defence of her crown with a battling 6-4, 6-3 win over 20-year-old Russian Elena Vesnina on Sunday. 

Henin, who also had to wait nearly six hours, came from 1-3 down in the second set to clinch victory and set up a clash with Austrian Tamira Paszek. 

Belgian Henin was broken when serving for the first set at 5-3 but the lapse was only temporary as she broke in the next game to clinch the set. 

Vesnina, the world No. 65, showed her potential as she broke on her way to a 3-1 lead in the second set but Henin then reeled off five consecutive games to advance to round two. 

Safin, a semi-finalist in 2002 but beaten in the first round last year, needed just one hour, 24 minutes to advance. 

I need to get the rhythm and the timing in order to play good tennis, he said. (But) I think I can manage to pass two rounds and, if I do, then Im going to be dangerous. 

Vicente, in the draw as a lucky loser, has not won a Tour match since June 2006 a run of 11 straight defeats and once Safin won the first set, the result was rarely in doubt. 

Safin won just three matches on clay in the build-up to Roland Garros and his expectations were low coming into the second Grand Slam event of the year. 

(My form) wasnt even ups and downs, it was just downhill, he said. I didnt do anything special on the clay courts. I lost difficult matches in Monte Carlo, Rome and Hamburg. But here is a little bit of a different story because its five sets and a big tournament. 

Even though you might feel youre not playing well, you have enough time to catch up and start to play better and better. You have always a chance. 

Safin, the No. 22 seed, maintained his concentration in light rain in the third set to set up a match with the winner of the all-Serbian clash between Janko Tipsarevic and qualifier Dusan Vemic. 

Safin said that as his confidence grows he could be a threat to the favourites. I need to stick around and get through a couple of rounds to get the groove, he said. 

He added that champion Rafael Nadal or world No. 1 Roger Federer would win the tournament. Nobody even can come close to beating them on clay, especially here, Safin said. 

Roger beat him 6-0 in the third set in Hamburg and it looks like he has finally found out how to play against Rafa. But Im pretty sure that Rafa had been playing many tournaments already and was tired. I dont the final in Hamburg will make a difference. It is 50-50 (here).

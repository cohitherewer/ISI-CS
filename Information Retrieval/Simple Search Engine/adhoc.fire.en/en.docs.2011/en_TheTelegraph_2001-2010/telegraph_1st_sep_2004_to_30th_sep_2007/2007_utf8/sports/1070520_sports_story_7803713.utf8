London: The West Indies fought back to reach 363 for seven at stumps on Saturday, Day III of the first Test at Lords. They trail England by 190 runs. 

Shivnarine Chanderpaul scored 63 not out from 161 balls, putting on stands of 92 with Dwayne Bravo (56) and 83 with Denesh Ramdin (60) to rebuild the innings after Panesar had taken four for 33 at one stage. 

Monty Panesar took four wickets of the top five wickets. 

He bowled Devon Smith (21) with his first ball just before lunch, and had Daren Ganga (49), Ramnaresh Sarwan (35) and Runaka Morton (14) out in identical leg-before-wicket decisions afterward. 

Panesar finished with four for 102 from 31 overs bowling 29 straight to carry the attack because Matthew Hoggard didnt return after leaving the field in the first session due to a strained abductor muscle. 

England captain Andrew Strauss had declared before the start of play on 553 for five, and opening batsmen Chris Gayle and Ganga started carefully until Gayle started hitting out. 

Hoggard was replaced by Liam Plunkett in the 13th over, and within two balls Gayle was bowled by a seaming yorker that hit off-stump to leave the West Indies on 38 for one. 

Gayle hit five boundaries for 30 off 39 balls. 

Panesar came on in the 27th over, with lunch imminent, and immediately got the breakthrough. 

Smith played inside Panesars first ball which didnt deviate and was bowled to end a 45-run stand with Ganga. The West Indies added 14 more to go into lunch on 97 for two. 

Ganga and Sarwan were largely untroubled immediately after the break to take the total to 150 against a wayward Steve Harmison before Panesar removed both batsmen within four overs. 

Panesar had Sarwan lbw for 35 to make it 151 for three in the 41st over and then dismissed Ganga in similar fashion 14 runs later. 

Next over and one run later, Morton edged a short ball from Plunkett to Collingwood at second slip, but he could only knock the overhead chance up and the ball eluded a diving Strauss at first slip. 

Panesar had his fourth wicket in the 53rd over with a similar lbw decision. It hit Morton above his pads knee-roll to leave the West Indies on 187 for five. 

Chanderpaul and Bravo brought up their 50-run stand off 72 balls and then took the total past 250 in the 66th over.

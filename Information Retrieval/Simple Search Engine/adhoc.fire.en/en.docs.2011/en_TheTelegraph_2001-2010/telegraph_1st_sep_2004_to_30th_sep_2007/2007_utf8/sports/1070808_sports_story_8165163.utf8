London: Englands premier batsman Kevin Pietersen is down with high fever and missed Tuesday afternoons work-out at the Brit Oval. 

According to a spokesman for the team, Pietersen is on antibiotics and his condition will be assessed on Wednesday morning, some 24 hours before the start of the third and final Test. 

The Indians are ahead 1-0. 

Its to be seen whether Michael Vaughan and Peter Moores are forced to make a change. If it comes to that, Middlesexs Owais Shah could be recalled. 

Theres talk, by the way, that rookie Stuart Broad is being strongly considered for the berth currently occupied by James Anderson. 

The general belief is that Broad is going to be more effective on a wicket which promises much bounce. 

As for the Indians, The Telegraphs sources have revealed that the XI which won at Trent Bridge by seven wickets will be retained. 

Thered been speculation that offie Ramesh Powar would replace Sreesanth. 

Meanwhile, the England amp; Wales Cricket Board has directed captain Vaughan and coach Moores to ensure theres no repeat of the jelly beans episode. 

The stern message was conveyed by the Big Two chairman (and the ICCs president-elect) David Morgan and chief executive David Collier.

Calcutta: Chima Okerie has been appointed Mohun Bagan coach. He will take over on Tuesday itself and will be in charge till the end of the season. 

Following a string of lacklustre performances the last being Sundays 1-2 defeat against Dempo SC Mohun Bagan decided to relieve Robson of the coachs job and give Okerie the responsibility. Robson will revert to the physios job. 

The Mohun Bagan executive committee members, who met Monday evening, discussed the coachs issue for over an hour before unanimously appointing Chima. 

After five roudns in the ongoing National Football League (NFL), Mohun Bagan have a solitary win to their credit. More significantly, they have lost three matches and drawn one to be at the bottom of the table. 

Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra, explaining the removal of Robson, said the Brazilian had himself opted out of the coachs job following Sundays National League loss to Dempo. 

He wanted us to relieve him from the coaching assignment but was keen to continue as physio, Mitra said. We were very happy with Robson we became Federation Cup champions under his guidance, so there was no reason to be dissatisfied with his work. 

Whatever Mitra may say, its no secret that the Mohun Bagan supporters and a section of the officials wanted Robson replaced. 

Mitra explained that after Biswajit Bhattacharya (Robsons predecessor) resigned, the assignment was given to Robson temporarily. 

Nigerian Bernand Oparanozie, another former player, will continue as the assistant coach, Mitra added. 

Chima, who arrived from Mumbai on Monday evening, is a very popular figure in the Calcutta football circles. 

He was a very prolific scorer for the green-and-maroons, and was mobbed by fans even recently when he came for an NFL TV commentary assignment. 

He knows our football culture very well, said Mitra, justifying the Nigerians appointment. 

This will be Okeries second term coaching assingnment. He earlier was in charge of Bengal Mumbai Football Club, albeit briefly. Now 39, Chima hung up his playing boots in 2002.

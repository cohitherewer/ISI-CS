 Vaughan eyes ODI revival 

 Michael Vaughan 

London: Michael Vaughan reckons being without the burden of the England captaincy could revive his fortunes with the bat in the one-day game. 

He hopes his decision to stand down could unleash the shackles on his run-scoring potential, if he is given another chance in ODIs. 

Vaughan gave up the one-day captaincy following Englands disappointing World Cup campaign in the Carribbean earlier this year. He has since been dropped from the England squads for the ongoing seven-match one-day series against India and next months inaugural ICC World Twenty20. 

Vaughan, 32, says he remains available for one-day cricket, if selected. 

He has also regularly admitted to being mystified at his mediocre limited-overs average of 27.15 compared to a Test figure in the mid-40s and is hoping that the new freedom from leading the team could help him perform. 

Maybe by playing as a non-captain will just unleash the shackles, and I just go out and just have a go and I become a better player, he said. (AFP)

 Uthappa ready

Robin Uthappa and Cheteshwar Pujara said on Friday they were raring to perform for the country. While Uthappa was picked for the first two ODIs against the West Indies as well as in the World Cup probables, Pujara was named among 30 probables. 

Following is what they had to say: 

ROBIN UTHAPPA: I love opening. But if the team wants me to bat down the order, it is absolutely fine. If given an opportunity I will do my best. Now, Im concentrating on the next two games (against the West Indies). 

CHETESHWAR PUJARA: I am happy my name features in the list of Indias top 30 players. But I have a long way to go. This is a good boost for my career. Im looking to improve on my fielding, fitness and strokeplay. (PTI)

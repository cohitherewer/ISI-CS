London: Fourth division Wycombe Wanderers piled on the misery for Chelsea as they deservedly held the Premier League champions 1-1 in the first leg of their League Cup semi-final on Wednesday. 

Chelsea had seemed on course for a 1-0 win after a 36th-minute Wayne Bridge goal, but were stunned 13 minutes from time when Jermaine Easter trickled a shot past Hilario. 

Chelsea, who have drawn their last three league games to slip six points behind Manchester United, would still expect to progress. 

But Wycombe, who knocked out Premier League Fulham and Charlton Athletic on their own grounds earlier in the competition, will visit Stamford Bridge for the second leg unfazed by their millionaire opponents. 

The return game takes place on January 23 with the winners playing Arsenal or Tottenham Hotspur in the February 25 final at Cardiffs Millennium Stadium. 

Salomon Kalou exposed the home defence with a long ball into the path of Bridge and as goalkeeper Ricardo Batista charged out, Bridge bravely kept his eye on the ball to hook it beyond the keeper and into the net.

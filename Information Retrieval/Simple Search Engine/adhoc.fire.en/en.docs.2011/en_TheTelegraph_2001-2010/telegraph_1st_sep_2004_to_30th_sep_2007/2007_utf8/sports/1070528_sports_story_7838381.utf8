 Djokovics talent matches ambition

CHRISTOPHER CLAREY

 Novak Djokovic 

There is something ominously methodical about Novak Djokovic at work, despite his lively mind and tendency to call for the trainer in times of duress. He says he wants to be the best player in the world. Thats a huge goal in the era of Roger Federer, but his talent is matching his ambition. 

It is evident as he bounces the ball at great length before he serves, and in his slightly mechanical, undeniably huge ground strokes. It can be seen in the way he fields the questions that attempt to pin him down on his ultimate goal in the game. 

Other, less overtly confident youngsters might keep the details to themselves, but Djokovic is no diplomat, at least not yet. I want the same thing Ive wanted since I was 7 years old, he said. I want to be No. 1. 

Quite a statement for someone to make in the golden age of Federer, and surely Djokovic heard a few snickers along the way as he laid bare his plans and his soul. 

No Serbian man ever amounted to much in tennis when Serbia was still part of Yugoslavia. Serbia later became an international pariah, and so many other youngsters were generating more sparks and sponsorship: Richard Gasquet and Ga Monfils of France; Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic; Andy Murray of Britain; and, above all, Rafael Nadal of Spain. 

Nadal, at nearly 21, is only 11 months older than Djokovic and already a two-time French Open champion and sports icon. 

But the snickers have died down, and Djokovic has firmly established himself as the salutatorian of his class in the past two seasons. He has won five singles titles on the ATP Tour, including this years Masters Series event in Miami. In that tournament, he beat Nadal. He is currently ranked sixth in the ATP rankings and is seeded sixth in the French Open, which begins Sunday. 

Like Rafa, Djokovic has a catchy two-syllable nickname, Nole (pronounced No-lay). At last years French Open, he ribbed Nadal by wearing Vamos Nole on his own sneakers. They may meet again this year in Paris, with both in the bottom half of the draw. 

Clearly, self-assurance is not an issue, and Djokovics progress in the computer rankings also looks ominously methodical. At the end of 2003, he was No. 679. At the end of 2004, his ranking was 186. At the end of 2005, he was No. 78. At the end of last year, he was 16th. 

Now, on the eve of another French Open, he is ahead of all the youngsters, except the No. 2 Nadal. Although it would be a jolt to see Djokovic, with his thick dark hair bristling, holding the champions Coupe des Mousquetaires at Roland Garros, given all the focus on Nadal and Federer. But it is no longer unthinkable, even if Djokovic does not consider clay his best surface. 

We know who the biggest favourites are, said Djokovics coach, Marian Vajda. But Novak is in the small group which has a chance to make a surprise. 

It has been nearly a year since Vajda began working with Djokovic. They started together on the grass before Wimbledon, but his job interview came in Paris during the French Open, where Djokovic made a run to the quarter finals before retiring against Nadal. 

The nice thing was that they still called me to start work after he reached the quarter finals, Vajda said. 

Djokovic, who turned 20 on Tuesday and celebrated with a party for 200 in Belgrade, has had some fine mentors in his short life. His first was Jelena Gencic, one of the leading womens players in the former Yugoslavia and a former adviser to Goran Ivanisevic; and to Monica Seles, who was born in the former Yugoslavia. 

Pretty much what I know on court, I owe to her; shes the one who developed my game, Djokovic said of Gencic. Whatever she told me, I did. And she kept telling me I had the talent to be No. 1. I believed her, and I still believe her.

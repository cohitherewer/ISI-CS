The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sachin, Sourav set to be rested

- Ranadeb likely to get a look-in against Lanka A

 Ranadeb Bose 

Leicester: India would rest some of their key players when they take on Sri Lanka A in a three-day practice match here on Friday after having taken a 1-0 lead in the three-Test series against England. 

Big guns such as Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Zaheer Khan and even promising left-arm seamer Rudra Pratap Singh are likely to get a breather before the third Test gets underway at The Oval from August 9. 

In fact, Leicester experienced light drizzle on Thursday and the senior cricketers chose not to practice. 

With the pitch wearing a greenish look, the tie is going to be crucial for the likes of Yuvraj Singh, Ranadeb Bose, Ishant Sharma, Gautam Gambhir and Ramesh Powar, who are yet to feature in the Test series so far. They will be keen to grab the opportunity and prove their worth ahead of the one-dayers. 

The morale boosting seven-wicket win in Nottingham has put India on course for a rare overseas series win and the team management would be eager to ensure that most of the players get some useful practice before moving to London for the third and final Test. 

The form and on-field behaviour of Sreesanth has been a worrying factor and the young Kerala seamer will be looking to rediscover his rhythm. Only seven members of the squad captain Rahul Dravid, Gambhir, Wasim Jaffer, Yuvraj, Ranadeb, Ishant and Powar turned up for the optional practice session on Thursday. 

TEAMS 

India (from): Rahul Dravid (captain), Wasim Jaffer, Dinesh Karthik, V.V.S. Laxman, Yuvraj Singh, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Sreesanth, Anil Kumble, Ramesh Powar, Gautam Gambhir, Ishant Sharma, Ranadeb Bose.

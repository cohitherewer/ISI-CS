Mumbai: Acknowledging that his eleven-year long career in Formula 1 racing did not have too much success, Panasonic Toyota racing team driver Ralf Schumacher said the Japanese team looked very promising for the season and would need patience for their success. 

Ralf finished eighth in the season-opener in Melbourne, but said his third season with the Japanese team was looking promising. Certainly it hasnt been as successful as I wished it to be... One thing is very clear, you cant buy success. You cant buy experience too, he said. 

The 31-year-old German pointed out that despite most of the big Formula 1 teams having similar budgets, many of the European teams had between 15 to 30 years of experience while the Japanese teams were fairly new to the circuit. 

When asked whether he missed his brother on the track, Ralf said: Its a strange thing not to have him on the track. But he deserves his retirement and it was very good timing. 

Ralf, who was also in Goa and Varanasi, said he was very interested in seeing Formula 1 arrive in India soon.

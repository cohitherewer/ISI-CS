 NZ contract for Gillespie

Christchurch: Daryl Tuffey, Andre Adams and Mathew Sinclair were left out as New Zealand named their new list of contracted players with two new faces in it. 

Right-arm mediumpacer Mark Gillespie and rookie stumper Gareth Hopkins made the cut, while veteran Craig McMillan retained his place in the 20-player list after being reinstated last year following the retirement of Nathan Astle. 

Twenty-five players are ranked by the selectors against set criteria for the Tests as well as ODIs. 

There is a weighting of 1.25 points per match for the Test rankings and 1.00 point for the ODI rankings. 

The 20 players with the highest aggregate score are then offered contracts. 

CONTRACTED PLAYERS 

Shane Bond, Stephen Fleming, James Franklin, Peter Fulton, Mark Gillespie, Gareth Hopkins, Jamie How, Brendon McCullum, Craig McMillan, Hamish Marshall, Chris Martin, Michael Mason, Kyle Mills, Jacob Oram, Michael Papps, Jeetan Patel, Scott Styris, Ross Taylor, Daniel Vettori and Lou Vincent.

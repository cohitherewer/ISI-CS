The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Involve cricketers more in set-up, say ex-players 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: As the scenario gets murkier in the lead-up to the election for the Cricket Association of Bengals (CAB) presidents post, the common refrain is that whoever comes to power should work towards the improvement of the game by involving players. The Telegraph spoke to a few personalities on the issue of sports minister Subhas Chakraborty coming into the fray. 

The following are excerpts (alphabetically): 

JAGMOHAN DALMIYA: I have resigned and am not involved with the happenings Im busy with court cases. 

DEVANG GANDHI: Please keep me out of all this. Im not getting involved 

ARUN LAL: This is a democratic set-up and anyone can contest. 

ASHOK MALHOTRA: What is happening is not cricket. This is out and out politics 

I would only hope that whoever comes into power does something for the game. I hope he involves cricketers more in the functioning of the association. Here cricketers have to ask for everything from tickets to taking up coaching offers. Lets have a situation where former players, who have played at least 50 Ranji matches, should be given membership and voting rights at the CAB. Every other state has it and we shouldnt be left behind. 

I hope things are sorted out in time I dont want to see a situation where Bengal reach the final of the Ranji Trophy and weve the state body contesting the elections the day before the match. 

PRANAB ROY: Whoever comes to power should work towards the good of the game. He should have the vision and has to devote time. The CAB has a professional set-up and work more like a corporate house with a chief executive officer. The office-bearers posts should no longer be honorary. 

The president should be an active team member and involve cricketers more in its working. The cricketers can look after the cricketing part while the administrators can take care of their duties. We should all work together to produce quality players on a regular basis. Whoever sits at the helm should also look at improving the infrastructure.

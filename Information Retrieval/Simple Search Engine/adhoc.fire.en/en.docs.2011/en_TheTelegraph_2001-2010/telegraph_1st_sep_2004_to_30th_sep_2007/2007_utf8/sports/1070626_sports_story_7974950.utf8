 Doshi ruffles Hampshire

THE TIMES, LONDON

Nayan Doshi, the left-arm spinner, who, with 50 scalps, is fast becoming the most successful bowler in Twenty20, strangled the life out of Hampshire at the Oval on Sunday, allowing Surrey to knock off just 72 runs in a match reduced to 10 overs. 

Doshi, who entered the fray in the fifth over with Hampshire on 37 for one, varied his pace and line impeccably, inducing errors from Adam Voges, Chris Tremlett and Greg Lamb to return figures of three for six from two overs. 

The two left-handed Michaels, Carberry (20) and Lumb (19), added 36 for the first wicket, but the Hawks imploded against Doshi and Chris Schofield. In reply, Alistair Brown, who made 31, smashed Lamb for two sixes in the fifth over to ease any nerves before Azhar Mahmood, with 21 not out, saw the Brown Caps home.

 Batting wasnt easy: Mahela

Port of Spain: Sri Lankan skipper Mahela Jayawardene is hoping that their 243-run win over Bermuda on Thursday will set the pace for a good tournament. 

We put our heads down and concentrated on having a good start. Once we did that, things fell in place, Jayawardene said. 

The last two years we have been playing good cricket. Its only in the last two months that we have not had a big win. Hopefully, this will be the start of a good tournament. 

Jayawardene said that although his side posted 321 for six and there were three solid half-centuries, batting was not easy on the Queens Park wicket. 

The first 20 overs were very difficult. Upul Tharanga and Sanath Jayasuriya had to really work hard, said the captain who top-scored with 85. Sangakkara (76) and I decided to keep wickets in hand and accelerate in the last overs. Chamara Silva (55 not out) played a good knock in the end. 

Bermuda skipper Irving Romaine said the big defeat notwithstanding, the experience of playing a big team mattered more than the result. 

We were all emotional and it showed in a couple of early overs. The experience is amazing for us, Romaine said. It was a wonderful experience. Some of the old players were also there. They are disappointed with the result, but they know it is a special day for Bermuda.

Calcutta: Expectedly, Bengals Sushmita Singha Roy and Pinki Pramanik cantered home in separate events before an empty Salt Lake Stadium on Day II of the Indo-Bangla Games here on Monday. 

Boosted by five gold medals from the athletics arena and five more from swimming, Bengals golden haul swelled to 16, four more than Bangladesh. 

With the mens and womens football team winning 4-1 and 2-0, respectively, the hosts are assured of two more gold medals. An official announcement, though, will be made only after the inconsequential third match. 

There was never any doubt over Sushmitas and Pinkis gold as they outclassed their opponents with far superior timings, but for the duo participation was important, coming as they were in an off-season. 

I picked up my boots almost two months after the Asian Games in Doha, Pinki, world No.27, said. 

For Sushmita, who lost out to J.J. Sobha in the National Games, it was time to pick up the pieces. 

I am targeting the Asian championship in Lebanon and a few circuit meets in Italy, Germany and France. This meet is as important as any one of those, she said. 

After Day II, Bengal have 49 medals (14 silver, 19 bronze) to Bangladeshs 35 (14 silver, 9 bronze).

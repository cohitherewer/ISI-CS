 Kapur tied third 

 - Chowrasia, Ghei share sixth spot 

Jakarta: Shiv Kapur excelled with a fine four-under 67 and stood at tied third place after the first round of the Indonesia Open on Thursday. 

Kapur, who missed the cut last week in Malaysia, was two behind the leader Chawalit Plaphol (66) and one behind second-placed Finn Mikko Ilonen (66). 

It was a good day for the Indians, as both S.S.P. Chowrasia and Gaurav Ghei landed an eagle each on the same par-5 13th hole and came in with a three-under 68 each. They were both tied at sixth. 

Amandeep Johl went one over 71 and was tied 56th, while Rahil Gangjee had a bad day with a six-over 77. 

Plaphol enjoyed a blemish free round and took the early opening round lead and maintained it till the end of play. Chawalit, 32, took charge with six birdies and was followed closely by Finlands Mikko Ilonen who was a stroke adrift. 

However, not all players were able to finish their first round as threat of lightning brought an early end to play and 36 players were still to finish their round. The best among them was Park-jun Won who was four-under with six more holes to play. 

Kapur, who started on the back nine, kept a steady pace in the opening round firing five birdies before dropping a shot at the eighth hole which pushed him down to joint third spot. 

Ghei had a sedate start with one bogey and nine pars in his first ten holes and then he had birdies on 11th and 12th and eagle on 13th followed by yet another birdie on 17th. But he spoilt his run with a bogey on 18th and ended at 68. 

Chowrasia, who had a bogey on 11th, eagled the 13th and then had three birdies and one bogey on back nine. Johl had three birdies and four bogeys, while Gangjee had no birdies and had four bogeys and one double bogey for 77 in 129 th place. 

Tied with Kapur in third place was Mads Vibe-Hastrup of Denmark who carded a 67 and Park Jun Won who was four-under through 12 holes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Team India improve already high ratings 

 - Dravid amp; Co. pay for pre-match dinner 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Nottingham: Thanks to their clean image, the Indian cricketers are quite easily the most popular anywhere. On Thursday, their ratings got even higher when they insisted on paying for the customary match-eve team dinner at a distinctly upmarket restaurant. 

Wed offered to host the team (with family) and the support staff, but they insisted on being presented the bill... I must confess that surprised me, the 4550 Miles From Delhi owner, J. Vig, told The Telegraph. 

He added: With no option, we billed at a flat rate of pounds 20 per person... It included everything starters, main course... The Rahul Dravids mainly tucked into prawns, chicken and paneer preparations. 

The chefs, of course, had been advised to use minimum oil and butter. 

The match-eve team dinners, it may be recalled, were started in the Sourav Ganguly-John Wright era. 

According to manager Rocky Rufus, a senior Vadodara-based Customs officer, the bill gets reimbursed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). 

Among those who joined the team dinner was the BCCIs chief administrative officer, Ratnakar Shetty.

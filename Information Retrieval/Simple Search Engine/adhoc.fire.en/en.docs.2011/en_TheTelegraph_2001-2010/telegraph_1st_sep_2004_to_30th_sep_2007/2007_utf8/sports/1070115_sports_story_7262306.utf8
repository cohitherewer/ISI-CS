 Not the end of my England career: Beckham 

 - Ouster from national side has led ex-captain to semi-retirement with Galaxy, feels Bobby Robson 

London: Former captain David Beckham has not given up hope of resuming his England career despite agreeing to leave Real Madrid for Los Angeles Galaxy. 

I dont believe it is the end of my international career because I have always said, and I will always say, that while I am still playing football I will be available to play for my country, Beckham told a newspaper on Sunday. 

The 31-year-old midfielder is due to begin his new career in Major League Soccer in August after agreeing a five-year contract with the Galaxy worth $1 million a week, the biggest deal in world sport. 

Beckham was dropped by England after the 2006 World Cup in Germany but still hopes to add more caps to his haul of 94. 

Of course, I am (still) going to be available and if I get the call, its amazing, said the former Manchester United player. 

If I dont, then Ive had an amazing career for my country anyway. 

Beckham, however, is bemused by Real Madrid coach Fabio Capellos decision to exclude him from the team until he leaves for Los Angeles Galaxy at the end of the season. 

As far as David is aware he has a contract for the remainder of the season and he remains dedicated to the club and the supporters, Beckhams spokesman Simon Oliveira said on Saturday. 

David is surprised at the quotes from Capello as no one from the club has informed him of this intention. He will continue to give his full commitment in a professional manner to the club. 

At a news conference earlier in the day, Capello said: Beckham will train with the team but he wont play. He has always been a great professional but if a player has such an important contract with another club you cannot count on him. You cant have the same enthusiasm when your mind is on other things. 

If Capello stands by his decision, the former Manchester United players last game for Real will have been last Sundays 0-2 defeat at Deportivo Coruna. 

In a related development, former England manager Bobby Robson has claimed it was Beckhams ousting from the national side which resulted in him moving to semi-retirement with Los Angeles Galaxy. 

Robson is convinced the decision of national boss Steve McClaren to overlook Beckham for the Euro 2008 qualifier in Croatia last October, despite a long injury list, convinced Beckham his days at the top were numbered. 

The decision killed Beckhams aspiration and hope and, in my view, led directly to this weeks announcement that he is off the United States for a very lucrative semi-retirement, 73-year-old Robson claimed in his column for an English daily. 

You have to say now that McClaren was right. Those of us, including myself, who wanted Beckham to be involved did so because we felt he was among Englands top 25 players. 

In principle he still should be but, in reality, he hasnt done anything this season to prove it. Even if the legs havent gone, the motivation has. 

Meanwhile, the latest wave of the British invasion is under way. Victoria Beckham, former pop star princess and wife to Beckham, arrived in Los Angeles. 

She landed at Los Angeles International Airport aboard a British Airways flight from London shortly after 3 p.m. on Saturday. 

Paparazzi pushed and shoved around Victoria and security guards as she raced through the airports international terminal to a black sport utility vehicle waiting outside. 

Victoria, who wore a gray cap, white blouse, black slacks and sunglasses, did not answer questions from the media.

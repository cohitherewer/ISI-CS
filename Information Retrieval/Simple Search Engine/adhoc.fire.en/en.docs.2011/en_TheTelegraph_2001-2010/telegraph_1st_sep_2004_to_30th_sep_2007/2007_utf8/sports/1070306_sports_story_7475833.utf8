The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Jagdale may be sole manager

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president, Sharad Pawar, has called a meeting of office-bearers on Tuesday. 

The agenda wasnt exactly revealed, but those assembling in New Delhi are likely to deliberate (among other things) on the number of affiliated units which need to be obliged with an all-expenses paid trip to the West Indies during the World Cup. 

Organising tickets and booking accommodation at this late hour wont be easy, though. 

Also, whether a replacement has to be named as the senior manager-designate, joint-secretary Mohinder Pandove, is unlikely to join Team India even at a later date. 

Im not sure of my travel plans The issue will be discussed with the president tomorrow, Pandove told The Telegraph on Monday evening. 

Pandove is a senior Punjab government official and the shift in power the Akalis are back in the state could be a big reason why he may not go at all. 

Till the other day, the BCCIs stand had been he would reach the West Indies after the two warm-up matches (Tuesday and Friday). 

Perhaps realising he couldnt go, Pandove didnt get himself photographed with the World Cup squad and support staff last Wednesday. 

The previous evening, however, hed been present for an informal group photograph at the BCCI HQ in Mumbai. 

Assuming Pandove doesnt go and no replacement is named, then Sanjay Jagdale (a senior national selector) is going to be the sole manager. He left with the Rahul Dravids last week. 

Because of Jagdale, theres a question mark over chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar making it to the West Indies at some point during the World Cup. 

The World Cup-related matters apart, Pawar and Co. could discuss the Nimbus-Prasar Bharati telecast row.

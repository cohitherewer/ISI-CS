 Non-bailable warrant against Lalit Modi

Jaipur: A court here on Saturday issued non-bailable warrants against Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) president Lalit Modi and three others for allegedly preventing two proxy votes at the annual general meeting of the sports body on November 19, 2006. 

Additional chief judicial magistrate D.C. Gupta issued the warrants to Modi, his personal security guard Sujeet Kumar and two RCA members Kuldeep Srivastav and Aamin Pathan since they did not appear before the court despite sending four summons to them. 

Petitioners Anil Shekhawat and Vasant claimed that when they came as proxy for Kishor Rungta and Neeraj Rungta, they were allegedly manhandled and taken hostage at the instance of Modi. 

The court has directed all four to be present in the court on January 18.

 Liverpool must stifle Kaka

 - CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL 

 Bentez needs to inflict on Milan what Mourinho did to United

The secret of lifting the Champions League has been simple in recent years: outwit Jose Mourinho first. No one managed it in 2004, so his Porto side prevailed. Liverpool seized the 2005 trophy after defeating Mourinhos Chelsea in the semi-finals, Barcelonas 2006 success involved a first knock-out stage victory over Mourinhos men, who were again eclipsed by Rafa Bentezs clever, determined unit last month. 

And now to Athens. Boasting such talents as Kaka, AC Milan are favourites for the 2007 edition being contested here Wednesday but, as Liverpools more historically-inclined followers will argue, they love an omen and an oracle here in Greece. Even the wise men at Delphi are whispering, Youve stopped Mourinho, now stop Kaka. 

Mourinho sides are incredibly difficult to overcome. Bentez needs to inflict on AC Milan what the Special Ones Chelsea did to Manchester United at Wembley on Saturday: close the space around their most creative force. Mourinho ordered his right-sided players, Paulo Ferreira and Shaun Wright-Phillips, to double on Cristiano Ronaldo and the skilful winger faded from view, starved of the oxygen of space. 

It may not tickle the taste buds of Roman Abramovich and Chelseas board but Mourinho has turned the science of negativity into an art form. Bentez dislikes the Portuguese peacock but he must follow suit if Kaka is not to run the show here at the Olympic Stadium. 

The arena itself is a monument to one virtuosos creativity: the Spanish architect, Santiago Calatrava, transformed the stadium for the 2004 Olympics with some design pyrotechnics. 

Few are predicting such extravagant outpourings of flair Wednesday, but the one footballer capable of real magic is Kaka. That is why Liverpool must control him. It may stymie the spectacle, but it will open up the road to a sixth European Cup. 

The low-key Bentez would rather enter the Eurovision Song Contest than appear in harmony with Mourinho, but he must echo the Chelsea coachs pre-Wembley question to his players: Do you want to enjoy the final or after the final? 

Such an approach may not seduce the neutral, but Mourinho has his eyes only on the big prize, the European Cup, not plaudits for espousing the Beautiful Game. Kill Kakas space must be Liverpools strategy. Stop a star from shining. 

Kaka, the best footballer in the world along with Cristiano, can win the game for the white shirts of Milan if given carte blanche. Athens boasts a Gene Kelly School of Dance and Kaka could enrol with the ball as his partner and pass out top of the class. 

United went all cavalier in San Siro and the elegant Brazilian ripped them apart with his passing and dribbling. Steven Gerrard reckons he has never seen a midfielder run so fast with the ball as Kaka, who gave Liverpool a high-speed, high-class chasing for 45 minutes in Istanbul in 2005. Only when Didi Hamann arrived at the break was Kaka, the man from the fashion centre of Milan, fitted for a straitjacket. 

Liverpool are forewarned. Gerrards midfield colleague, Xabi Alonso, has already talked this week about the importance of stifling Kaka. We will work on closing him down and trying to be compact, the Spaniard said. Sounds like a typical Bentez training session. 

Publicly, Bentez insists he will not man-mark Kaka. Jamie Carragher, the sharpest mind in the Liverpool party who landed here Monday, gives a wry view on preparations, observing: We wont decide until nearer the game whether picking Kaka up is a job for the defence or the midfield. Im hoping its the midfield! 

And this is the problem presented by the zephyr blowing in from Milans midfield. Kaka moves around off the front-runner, dropping deep, drifting wide and always capable of finding top gear in a split-second. He must be midfields responsibility. 

Meanwhile, AC Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti is confident captain Paolo Maldini will be fit to line up against Liverpool in the Champions League final on Wednesday, adds a Telegraph Online report 

Maldini has been struggling with a knee injury, which saw him ruled out of the semi-final return leg against United earlier this month. 

He has postponed an operation in order to play in the final and Ancelotti said: Maldini is fine, if we were playing the game Tuesday he would be on the pitch. 

He said: I know who will play but I have not even told my players yet. All my players merit to play in this final but its not possible. 

Ancelotti said: We have had to work so hard in order to get here and few people believed we would be able to go so far. For that reason, I believe this is a dream.

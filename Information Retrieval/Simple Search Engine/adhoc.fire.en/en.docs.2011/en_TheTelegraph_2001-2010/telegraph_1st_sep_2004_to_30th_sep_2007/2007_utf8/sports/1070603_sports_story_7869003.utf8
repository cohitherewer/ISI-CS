 Federers money 

on Kuznetsova 

Paris: Roger Federer has picked Svetlana Kuznetsova to win the womens title at the French Open. The top-ranked Federer, when asked to name who he thought would claim the Grand Slam title, shot back an answer almost as quickly as one of his forehands. 

Kuznetsova, Federer said on Friday. I like her game. She plays well. 

The third-seeded Kuznetsova reached the third round when she beat Meghann Shaughnessy on Thursday. (AP)

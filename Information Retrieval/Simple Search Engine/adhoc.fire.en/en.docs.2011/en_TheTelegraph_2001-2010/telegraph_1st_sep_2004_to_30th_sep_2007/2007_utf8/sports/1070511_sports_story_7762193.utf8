 ECB objects to India-SA series

London: The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has objected to Ireland holding two India-South Africa ODIs on days clashing with Englands ties against the touring West Indies. 

But Ireland Cricket Union (ICU) is determined to go ahead with Indias scheduled series in June, saying the series was significant to cash in on the countrys unexpected show in the World Cup. 

They dont want us to host these matches and they have asked us not to, but we have taken the decision that we will go ahead as these matches are too important for us, ICU chief executive Warren Deutrom said. 

The ECB fears that Zee TV could sell the pictures for broadcast in the UK, a step that is potent enough to dilute the television audience. (PTI)

 Warne ends speculation

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

Australians can sleep easily again as Shane Warne on Sunday ended speculation that he is about to swap his Australian nationality for a German passport. Warne said on Friday he was investigating whether he qualified for a German passport so he could play for Hampshire as a non-overseas player. 

The story has become front-page news in his home country, but he said on Sunday: I am Australian, as simple as that, and I always will be. Im not going to be Adolf Warne or anything like that Ill alwa ys be Shane Warne.

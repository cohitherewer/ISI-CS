 Atwal at tied 130th spot

Oregon: Arjun Atwal returned a three-over 75 in the opening round of the Oregon Classic on the Nationwide Tour on Thursday. 

The poor start dealt a blow to his quest of regaining his US PGA Tour card and he was also left at tied 130th spot. Atwal will need a very low second round card to make the halfway cut.

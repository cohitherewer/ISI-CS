The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Plucky start by Bangla

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Port of Spain: Come for cricket, stay for the party! Thats the invitation sent out across the world. 

Trinidad is renowned as the home of calypso, Caribbean carnival and steel pan. Rahul Dravid had hoped for the right atmosphere and the locals did not disappoint. With music blaring from all corners of the Queens Park Oval, they tried to make up for those who missed out on the February carnival. 

Bangladesh were 80 for three after 16 overs in pursuit of 192 at the Queens Park Oval on Saturday. Having done superbly to restrict the strong Indian batting line-up to below 200, Bangladesh seemed to be cruising at 69 for one before Munaf Patel struck twice. He first got rid of opener Tamim Iqbal (51 off 53 balls) and then Aftab Ahmed (8). Zaheer Khan had drawn first blood when he trapped Shahriar Nafees leg-before for 2. Zaheer, however, went for 37 in his first spell of six overs, while Ajit Agarkar conceded 15 in three. 

On the streets leading to the historic venue, the carefree and cacophonous crowd ruled as colourfully attired men and women sparked off the dhaks and dhols, dancing and singing. 

Inside, though, the party wasnt as smooth. Dravids decision to bat first backfired as Bangladeshs opening bowlers Mashrafe Mortaza and Syed Rasel made good use of the life and carry on the wicket. The ball didnt fly around as during the good olden days, but it was enough to send the Indians flinching. 

Thankfully, his teammates ineptitude didnt rub off on one Indian. Not sure of his berth in the squad till a few months ago, Sourav Gangulys determination and application helped them tide over the initial crisis. None of the top-order batsmen showed responsibility and the intention to stay at the wicket. 

The consistent shouts of Come on I-N-D-I-A, come on, from the Dos Santos and Jeffrey Stollmeyer Stands hardly made any impact on the players. Even the sense of the occasion hardly enthused our players. 

Credit, however, should go to the Sourav-Yuvraj Singhs 85-run partnership for the fifth wicket that helped India reach 191. The pair mainly concentrated on consolidation, only rotating the strike and occasionally stepping out against the spinners. Souravs 66 was the highest as the Indians didnt even last the full quota of overs. Yuvraj fell three runs short of a half-century. 

Munaf Patel (15) and Zaheer Khan (15) restored some parity as the last wicket pair put on a smashing 32-run stand after the team was in danger of being all out with a few overs to spare. 

As Sehwags nightmare continued, Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid also failed to show the way. Mahendra Singh Dhoni didnt show any responsibility either. 

If the Bangladesh bowlers proved their worth, the fielders complemented their efforts with an agile and athletic display. Mortaza was the most successful with four for 38 and it was his first seven-over burst during which he claimed Sehwag and Robin Uthappa that shook India, a position from where they never looked back. He returned to polish off the tail. 

Incidentally, the opening blues had haunted Team India during their 2003 campaign as well.

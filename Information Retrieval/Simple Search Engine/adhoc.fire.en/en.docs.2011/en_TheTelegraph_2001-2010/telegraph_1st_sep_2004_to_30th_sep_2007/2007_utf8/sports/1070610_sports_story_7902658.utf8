Chennai: Asia clinched the Afro-Asia Cup 2-0 on Saturday, posting a 31-run victory over Africa in the second limited-overs International. 

The Asian line-up, who had won the first match by 34 runs Wednesday, again piled up a huge score of 337 for seven in 50 overs that proved too much for the African batsmen. 

Despite aggressive half-centuries from Mark Boucher (73) and Boeta Dippenaar (67), Africa were bowled out for 306 with one ball to spare. 

Pace bowler Dilhara Fernandos four-wicket burst dashed Africas hopes of mounting a winning chase. Fernando dismissed opener Vusi Sibanda (35) and skipper Justin Kemp (0) in this first spell then returned to claim the wickets of Boucher and Johan Botha. 

Part-time spinner Yuvraj Singh dismissed Dippenaar, who revived the African challenge after the loss of three wickets. 

Asias total featured a composed 88 from Sourav Ganguly and confident half-centuries from opener Virender Sehwag and Mohammed Younis. 

Asia got off to a rousing start thanks to Sehwags 38-ball 52 that featured nine boundaries and a six. 

Sehwag dominated the attack after losing opening partner Sanath Jayasuriya (11) cheaply. Jayasuriya miscued a drive off Thomas Odoyo to Dippenaar at mid-off. 

Africas attack wilted under Sehwags strokes before he lofted a slower delivery from Elton Chigumbura to Morne Morkel at long-on. 

Sourav then took centrestage, hitting nine boundaries and one six from 112 deliveries as he chased his 23rd limited-overs half-century. 

Big hitter Mahendra Singh Dhoni justified promotion to the No. 4 spot by smashing two sixes in his cameo knock of 33 before he was bowled by Albie Morkel. 

Skipper Mahela Jayawardene hit a rapid 45 before being run out in a mix up with Sourav unable to regain the crease after being sent back by Sourav and Younis then punished the African attack with big strokes. 

Sourav fell 12 runs short of the century, dismissed by substitute Peter Ongondos running catch from deep square-leg as he tried to smash a full-toss from Chigumbura. 

Younis hit three boundaries and two sixes in his 44-ball 51 before edging Morne Morkel to wicketkeeper Boucher in the last over of the innings, while left-hander Yuvraj Singh remained unbeaten on 30.

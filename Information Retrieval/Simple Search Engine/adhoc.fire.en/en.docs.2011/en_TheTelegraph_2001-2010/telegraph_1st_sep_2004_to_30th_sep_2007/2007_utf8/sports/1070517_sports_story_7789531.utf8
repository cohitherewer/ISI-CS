 Federer struggles to beat Monaco

Hamburg: Roger Federer, who is going through his worst slump since taking over the No. 1 ranking, struggled to beat Juan Monaco 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 Wednesday in the second round of the Hamburg Masters. 

Federer who needs to win the French Open to complete a career Grand Slam, has gone four straight tournaments without a title his worst stretch since becoming the top-ranked player in February 2004. 

Playing under a closed roof of the centre court on a rainy and cool day, Federer broke Monaco for a 5-4 lead in the final set and then served out the match, converting his first match point with a service winner. 

Federer has won the Hamburg Masters in three of his last four visits. 

Carlos Moya rallied to upset 10th-seeded Tomas Berdych 3-6, 7-5, 7-6 (6). 

Earlier, Lleyton Hewitt, looking sharp after a practice session with Rafael Nadal, continued his comeback from injury with a 6-2, 7-6 victory over Juan Ignacio Chela in the second round. 

The Australian, who hit with the Spanish clay court supermo the day before the match, broke Chela in his opening service game and hardly looked back. 

Hewitt went into the 2.1m euros claycourt meet with just one match under his belt in two months.

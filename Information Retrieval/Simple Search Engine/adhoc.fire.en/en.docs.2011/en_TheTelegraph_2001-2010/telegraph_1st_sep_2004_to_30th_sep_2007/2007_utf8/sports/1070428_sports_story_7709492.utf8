 Mahela does a Sourav

Melbourne: Ahead of the World Cup final, Mahela Jayawardene has taken a cue from Sourav Gangulys ploy to unnerve the Australians. 

Much to the annoyance of Ricky Ponting, the Sri Lankan captain turned up an hour late for a scheduled beach photo shoot with the Australian captain and the Cup to promote Saturdays final, according to a media report here. 

Ponting made the appointment despite having to travel from St Lucia to Barbados and had to twiddle his thumbs before Jayawardene arrived. 

Bit late are you? the report quoted Ponting as saying to Jayawardene. I did not know about this, seriously, Jayawardene said blaming a communication breakdown and peak-hour traffic jam for his late arrival. 

Sourav had kept Steve Waugh waiting for the toss on several occasions during Australias tour of India in 2001 which irked the then Australian captain. (Agencies)

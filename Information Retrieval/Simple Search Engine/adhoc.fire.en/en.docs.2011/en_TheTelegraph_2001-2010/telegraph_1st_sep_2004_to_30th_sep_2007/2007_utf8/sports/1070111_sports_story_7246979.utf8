 Chhetri brace floors Mohun Bagan 

 - Maria red-carded, to miss tie vs Mahindra 

 Sunil Chhetri turned out to be the wrecker-in-chief for his former team 

Ludhiana: Mohun Bagan seem to be heading back to their disappointing past. 

While everybody thought the victory in the Federation Cup would herald a new hope around the combination of Bhaichung Bhutia and Jose Ramirez Barreto, its fast turning out to be an act of self-deception. 

For, either Mohun Bagan have been too complacent to gauge the ground reality or they have simply lost the winning touch. 

If the ONGC National Football League opener against the lowly HASC, which ended in a draw, was a warning, it clearly showed that Mohun bagan under the interim coach Robson, didnt pay heed to it. The result was immediate as the green-and-maroon brigade lost to JCT 0-2 in the second match at the Guru Nanak Stadium on Wednesday. 

Their nemesis in the match turned out to be former player Sunil Chhetri. The striker scored both the goals in the seventh and 36th minute as JCT enjoyed complete domination over Robsons side. 

Both Bhaichung and Barreto played on Wednesday, but the duo failed to make any significant mark in the match. 

More worryingly, Mohun Bagan defender Sanjeev Maria received the marching orders after getting two yellow cards. He will miss the teams next match against defending champions Mahindra United in Mumbai on Sunday. 

The win couldnt come any better way for JCT coach Sukhwinder Singh, who had to watch his team go down to Mohammedan Sporting 1-2 in the NFL opener, despite holding sway over the rivals. 

Its also the redemption time for Chhetri, who missed at least a couple of sitters against Mohammedan Sporting on Friday last. 

For Mohun Bagan, perhaps its time to ponder over appointing a proper guide for the team. Under an interim coach, who is in essence a physio, Federation Cup could be a flash in the pan. But doubts have already started cropping up over the possibility of Robson helping the team survive the marathon league, which is highly competitive as well.

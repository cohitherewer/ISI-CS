The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Prasun: They know what theyre doing

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The ICL buzz can be heard from South to East. After having roped in eight Hyderabad players, a number of Bengal cricketers, including captain Deep Dasgupta, have been lured by the Essel Group. 

However, for Ranji runners-up Bengal, this is not a setback and will not hamper their performance during the forthcoming season, according to the Bengal coach, former players and the CAB president. 

Following are their reactions (alphabetically): 

Bharat Arun: Its their own choice. Weve to look ahead, taking this in our stride. We will definitely miss them They were part of the Bengal team that has done quite well. In terms of experience its a setback for Bengal as it will be difficult to find their replacements. 

But weve been the under-22 champions so that means we do have the talent. We just have to nurture them. Its a challenge for us and for the young boys of the team. 

Sambaran Banerjee: Obviously they are going for better money. I dont have much to say. That is their choice. Of course, Deep (Dasgupta) and Laxmi (Ratan Shukla) are very close to me and they are very important players of Bengal. 

Snehashish Ganguly: Weve got a good second line-up. This development wont hamper much. Our second line-up may be better. Its their personal decisions. Obviously, money is factor they have been offered good amount of money. 

Some of them were approaching the end of their career so Im not quite surprised. Unless I know the format and they start functioning its difficult to say whether ICL will be a hit. 

Arun Lal: I cant react on that. Ive no idea Cricket will go on. I dont think it (the players joining ICL) will make any difference They still can represent their state. 

Prasun Mukherjee: They are all mature persons and obviously they know both sides of the coin. On one hand there is money and on the other hand there is official recognition. Its their choice; I cant tell somebody to hold on 

This is not at all a setback for Bengal. Some of them were good cricketers and have done quite well for the state but dont forget that were the reigning under-22 champions so weve bench strength to replace them. If they are not available there will be somebody else. 

PRANAB ROY: This is a result of the deteriorating relationship between players and CAB officials. The officials treat players as slaves. The growing insecurity among the players is a matter of concern Moreover there is no one to speak for our players at selection meetings. This will continue since there is no accountability.

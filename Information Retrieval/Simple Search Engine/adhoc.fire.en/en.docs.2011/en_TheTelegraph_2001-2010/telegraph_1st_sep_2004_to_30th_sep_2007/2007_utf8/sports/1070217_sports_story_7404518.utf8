 Chopra lies tied 15th

Pacific Palisades (California): Daniel Chopra had an eventful round with six birdies, two bogeys and one double bogey as he returned two-under 69 in the opening round of the $5.2-million Nissan Open Golf Tournament. 

Chopra was lying tied 15th as the leader was Padraig Harrington playing his first Nissan Open. Harrington shot a eight-under 63. 

Chopra opened with birdies on first two holes before dropping a shot on sixth, but he picked up a birdie on seventh. A double bogey on ninth saw him turn in even par and a bogey on tenth sent him over par. However, Chopra fought back with birdies on 11th, 12th and 17th to end the day two-under 69. 

Irelands Padraig Harrington notched 10 birdies in an eight-under 63 to seize the first-round lead. (PTI)

 Harper: Kenya have turned the corner 

Nairobi: Kenyan coach Roger Harper believes the African nation has come out of one of the worst phases in its cricketing history and is confident that the team can replicate its 2003 performance at the World Cup . 

Kenya created a sensation when they reached the semi-finals at the last World Cup in South Africa. But it has been all downhill since. 

Harper, however, says that the team has finally turned the corner with their triumph in the World Cricket League, an ICC tournament for associate countries. 

The team is delighted to have won the WCL. The victory was a reward for hard work, effective teamwork and execution of team plans, Harper said. (PTI)

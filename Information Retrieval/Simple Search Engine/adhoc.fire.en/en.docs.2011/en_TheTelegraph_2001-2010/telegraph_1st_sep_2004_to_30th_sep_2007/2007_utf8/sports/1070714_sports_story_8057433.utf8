 EUROPEAN CLUB UPDATE 

Mourinho praises Ben Haim

London: If Jose Mourinho is smiling more than

 usual through his training drills in California, it is because he is savouring

 the restoration of Chelseas ravaged defence. Ashley Cole is completing his comeback from the ankle injury that ruined his last season, Glen Johnson is back in the frame from Portsmouth, and now uncomplicated tackler Tal Ben Haim promises to be the final link in the teams iron-clad back line. Ben Haim is a multi-functional defender, capable of leaving his central station to deputise on the left or right, and after six hours of studying his movement on the UCLA football fields, Mourinho admitted he was very happy to have secured the Israelis services. We need multi-functional players, people who can save my skin when we are in trouble. What Essien did last season, Tal will do the same, Mourinho

 said. 

Fabregas no to Real 

London: Cesc Fbregas, the Arsenal and Spain midfield player, told Real Madrid that he would not be joining them this summer. After a meeting with Arsne Wenger, the Arsenal manager, on Wednesday, Fbregas decided to reject the advances of the Spanish champions and informed them of his decision on Thursday. However, Real Madrid signed Javier Saviola from FC Barcelona on Friday. 

Latest player in Tevez affair 

London: Manchester Uniteds bid to sign Carlos Tevez has taken another twist after a Brazilian judge issued an arrest warrant for the Argentine forwards agent on alleged money-laundering charges. Judge Fausto Martin de Sanctis on Thursday ordered the overseas arrest of agent Kia Joorabchian, Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky and Nojan Bedroud in a case involving sports management group MSI and Brazilian club Corinthians. The development came as Joorabchian was talking to British media in London about his hopes of securing a transfer for Tevez to Old Trafford from West Ham United. However, West Ham have made it clear that Tevez is under contract to them until 2010, that they expect him back for pre-season training. 

Chopra deal with Sunderland 

Sunderland: Michael Chopra signed with Sunderland on Friday in a four-year deal worth up to 5m. The striker moved from League Championship side Cardiff, where he was the second top-scorer with 22 goals in 42 games. He joins Greg Halford and Russell Anderson as new recruits at Sunderland, which is managed by former Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane. Hes a natural goal-scorer who will bring competition with our other quality strikers to the side, Keane said. Im very confident he will score goals for this football club.

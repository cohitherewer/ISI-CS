Chon Buri (Thailand): Defending champions Europe stormed to an emphatic Royal Trophy victory after the team registered five victories in the eight singles matches against Asia at the Amata Springs Country Club on Sunday. 

Dominating the Ryder Cup-style match play event from the opening day, the visitors took six of the eight points available in the singles, with their 12 to 3 triumph ensuring the trophy went back to Europe for a second successive year. 

Europe started the day with a 6 to 1 lead and the contest was decided after the first two matches, with a 4 amp;3 victory from Lee Westwood and a half from Darren Clarke giving Seve Ballesteros team an 8-2 lead with six ties remaining. 

Ballesteros said the quality of his teams performance showed why Europe were the dominant force in team golf. 

We really showed our potential over the last three days, everyone played fantastic, the Spaniard said. 

The Asian team didnt play badly. Europe played unbelievable golf thats why they beat the Americans (at the Ryder Cup). 

Ballesteros, who captained the team in the inaugural contest last year, added: The Asian team must be very proud of what they did, but the European team was just so much better. 

Westwood trailed for much of the front nine against Japans Toru Taniguchi but birdies on the 10th, 11th, 13th and 14th holes helped the Englishmen continue his unbeaten run on the European team. 

Thats 13 matches in a row for me representing Europe without losing theres nothing unlucky about 13 for me, he said. 

Asia picked up their second half of the day after Swedens Henrik Stenson bogeyed the 12th hole and doubled bogeyed the par-four 13th to surrender a three-stroke lead to YE Yang. 

The South Korean made three straight birdies on the back nine to go one ahead before Stensons magnificent approach at the 18th hole set up a match-squaring birdie. 

Swedens Robert Karlsson made six birdies for a convincing 3 amp;2 win over Asian No. 1 Jeev Milkha Singh. 

Anthony Walls five birdies to Tetsuji Hiratsuka four bogeys helped secure a 4 amp;2 win, while Thongchai Jaidee notched up Asias only victory of the three-day contest, with a 2 amp;1 win over Swede Niclas Fasth. 

Asia never looked like winning the contest against a team containing five members of Europes victorious 2006 Ryder Cup side and the hosts appeared overawed as they were trounced in both the foursomes and fourballs on the first two days. 

Europe won last years Royal Trophy 9-7.

 their former coach Bob Woolmers residence has been 

 warmly appreciated by his wife Gill. According to the Pakistan

 Town for their ICC World Twenty20 campaign were keen to 

 call on Bob Woolmers wife and offer their condolences 

 personally at her residence.

6 Pakistanis game for IPL

 Karachi: Six Pakistan cricket team members want to play in the officially sanctioned Indian Premier League (IPL) Twenty20 competition, a top cricket board official said on Thursday. 

The official said that six players had informed the PCB they were keen to play in the IPL, which was launched earlier this month in New Delhi by the BCCI. 

Six of our players are keen to play and we will be informing the Indian board and the other stakeholders about their availability, the official said.

McGrath rsquo;s mission

 Melbourne: Having joined the Indian Premier League (IPL) post-retirement, former Australian pacer Glenn McGrath now wants to explore other business opportunities there. 

Like fellow Aussie Brett Lee, McGrath realises India is the biggest market for cricketer. The pacer has no qualms in admitting that IPL would give him the opportunity to look at those options. Im keen to be involved in it and whether thats playing or whatever, well see what happens, he was quoted as saying. 

No play on second day

 Dharamsala: The second days play in the second and final four-day match between India A and South Africa A was called off without a ball being bowled. 

Heavy overnight rain left the outfield soggy at the HPCA Stadium. The skies opened up again around noon, forcing umpires S.K. Tarapore and G. Pratap Kumar to call off play after their second inspection at 1 pm. 

The South Africans made 264 for four in 70 overs on Day I which was also curtailed because of a wet outfield. Ashwell Prince was unbeaten on 17 and Justin Ontong was on 22 at stumps on the first day.

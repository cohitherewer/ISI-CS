 BCCI hardliners to handle contracts 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: It may appear that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has conceded ground to the cricketers on the contracts issue. A closer look will, however, reveal that it has a long-term plan to tighten the noose. 

On Saturday, when senior BCCI officials met at president Sharad Pawars residence here, they agreed to appoint a two-member committee to review the contentious issues in the contracts after the tour of Bangladesh. At the same time, the BCCI also chose to name two well-known hardliners in the committee, who are in favour of introducing a performance-linked payment for the players. 

Our treasurer N. Srinivasan and vice-president (Central) Shashank Manohar will form the two-member committee that will look into the contracts issues after the Bangladesh tour, said Rajeev Shukla, vice-president (East) after the meeting. He added that the decision has been conveyed to captain Rahul Dravid. 

On Sunday, secretary Niranjan Shah was scheduled to discuss the issue with the players in Calcutta. It has been put off now, Shukla informed. 

He said that the committee has been formed after the players expressed their desire to discuss certain clauses in the contracts with the board. We have decided to accept that, he said. 

Besides Pawar, the others who attended the meeting were Shah, joint secretary M. P. Pandove, chief administrative officer Prof. Ratnakar Shetty and Shukla. 

Shukla, however, refused to divulge the issues that have been stopping the players from signing on the dotted line before leaving for Bangladesh. I cannot reveal it at the moment, he said. The relation between the players and the BCCI is absolutely cordial. There is no confrontation between the two parties. 

Asked whether the formation of a separate committee to look into the contracts issue is a kind of climbdown on BCCIs part, Shukla said it was a wrong way of looking at things. Players are a part of the BCCI family. There is no question of climbing down. Players wanted to discuss a few things and we are only doing that. 

Besides the contracts, the appointment of a new Team India coach and womens cricket were also discussed. The search committee will meet in the third week of May.

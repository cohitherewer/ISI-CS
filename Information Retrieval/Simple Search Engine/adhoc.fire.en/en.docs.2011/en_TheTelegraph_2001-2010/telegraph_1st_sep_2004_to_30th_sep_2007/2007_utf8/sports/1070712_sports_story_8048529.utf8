 No pressure in tie vs India

 Nayeemuddin 

New Delhi: All set to take over the reins of the Bangladesh football team, Syed Nayeemuddin asserted he would not have divided loyalties when his wards take on India in the upcoming international tournaments. 

India and Bangladesh are scheduled to lock horns in the ONGC Cup next month, followed by the SAFF Championship in December. 

Nayeemuddin insisted he would not be under any pressure. 

There will be no pressure on me in the ONGC Cup. My job is to work on the field and produce champions and I will work for that. I will do my job sincerely and without any pressure, Nayeemuddin said from Bangladesh. 

Nayeem, who is presently in his second stint with Dhaka Club Brothers Union, said it was a great honour for him to be offered the coaching job of a foreign team. 

To work in a country that gave birth to legendary footballers like Samad is amazing and I am thankful to the authorities here for reposing faith in me, he said. 

The terms and conditions of Nayeems contract, initially for a few months, are being finalised, the coach said. 

Praising Bangladeshi players, Nayeem said they are enthusiastic but need to work on all aspects of the game. 

They are good but need to improve in some departments. They should mainly focus on fitness and their skills. My priority would be to make them at least play to a general standard, said Nayeem, who was picked to play in all time best Asian Stars team in 1967. 

Nayeem also opined that financial constraints are affecting development of the Bangladesh football. 

The problem here is money. There are not many sponsors here and the players are not well paid. In India, you can get sponsors but here this is a problem. But the good sign is they love the game very much. 

Clubs should be corporatised to back players and the game. Only then they will be able to travel extensively to get exposure, said Nayeem.

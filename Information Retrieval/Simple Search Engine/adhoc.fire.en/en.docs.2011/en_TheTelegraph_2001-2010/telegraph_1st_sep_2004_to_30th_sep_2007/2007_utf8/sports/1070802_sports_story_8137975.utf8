 Portugal trip careers best

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhaichung 

New Delhi: It was a quiet touchdown for the Indian football team that arrived from Portugal late on Tuesday night here. 

There was no media hype surrounding the boys who returned from the four-match tour unbeaten and all one could see were two staff members of the federation waiting to ferry the team to the hotel. 

It, however, couldnt fade the smiles on the face skipper Bhaichung Bhutia. With four goals in his kitty from the tour, he looked tired but a completely rejuvenated man. 

This is probably the best tour of my career with the Indian team, said Bhutia, who struck some eye-catching goals. It was not because I got goals. In recent years, I never had so much pleasure playing for the Indian team. 

Bhaichung said his mental make up has gone through a sea change in the last few months. Last year, there was a time when I seriously contemplated retiring from international football, Bhaichung confessed. I was getting bored as we were not going anywhere. I was not learning anything. 

The tour of Portugal, the Indian captain said, has taught him a few lessons. Under Bob (Houghton) we have realised what the team game is all about. Now we are much more confident and ready to take up international challenge. 

What impressed Bhaichung most was the way the tour was planned. It was even better than the three tours we made in England a few years back. There we were only playing matches. In Portugal, it was training-cum-match practice. Both the things were blended wonderfully. It helped us immensely. 

Bhaichung was extremely impressed by Portugals style of play and facilities available there. Unlike England, they play more of a passing game. Even the teams we played (in lower divisions) have a strong base. 

Bhaichung, at the moment, is nursing a slight muscle injury and will take rest for a few days. On August 5, we all will join back the camp and start preparing for the Nehru Cup, said the Sikkimese striker in a triumphant tone.

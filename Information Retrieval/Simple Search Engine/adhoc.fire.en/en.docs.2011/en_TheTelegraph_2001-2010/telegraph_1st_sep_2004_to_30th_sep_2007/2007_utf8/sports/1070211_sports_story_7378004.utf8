Calcutta: The AIFF has been sitting idle on it; the IFA hasnt given any thought to it either. But the newly-formed Football Players Association of India (FPAI) did it, and with an overwhelming response, on Saturday. 

The Bhaichung Bhutias and Jose Ramirez Barretos played an exhibition match organised by FPAI to raise funds for the families of late India captains Sudip Chatterjee and V.P. Sathyan at the Howrah municipal corporation ground. And Bhaichung was moved when the cheque of Rs 2 lakh each was handed over to their respective families. 

In an out-of-the-box move, FPAI also announced a financial help of Rs 25,000 for the ailing international referee Pradip Nag. 

I am astonished to see such a crowd response to the match. This is touching and we are bound to draw huge inspiration from this effort in our next course of action. 

We all earn money and make names by playing football. But we also have a social responsibility to fulfil, Bhaichung said. 

P.K. Banerjee also felt that the FPAI would now have to handle a huge challenge in future. People will now start expecting more from the Bhaichungs and FPAI, he said. 

For the record, Barreto XI consisting of foreigners playing in India, including one Chima Okerie beat Bhaichung XI 1-0, the winner coming from the Brazilian himself early in the first half. But it could have easily been a 10-1 scoreline for the Bhaichungs. The captain himself missed the open nets twice, while Saumik Dey, Basudeb Mondal and Dipendu Biswas squandered one chance after another. 

Rolling back the years, Chima, Chibuzor and Bernard the trio who dominated the Maidan in the 90s took the field. I played only because I was so close to Sudip and Sathyan, Chima said.

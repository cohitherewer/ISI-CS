 Sachin has 2-3 years left: Wadekar

Mumbai: Former India captain Ajit Wadekar and Ashok Mankad differed with Ian Chappells view that Sachin Tendulkar should retire. 

Following are excerpts from what ex-India players had to say on Chappells observation on Sachin: 

 CHANDU BORDE: Everyone has a right to express 

 his opinion. 

 ASHOK MANKAD: I dont think Sachin has 

 that kind of mindset to play for statistics, he is far above 

 all those petty things. Having worked with him for three 

 years and followed his career, I found out that he is full 

 of positive energy and always puts in 100 pre cent and expects 

 that from others as well. 

 AJIT WADEKAR: We cannot blame Sachin for the 

 debacle. Its not right. He has two to three years 

 of good cricket left in him.

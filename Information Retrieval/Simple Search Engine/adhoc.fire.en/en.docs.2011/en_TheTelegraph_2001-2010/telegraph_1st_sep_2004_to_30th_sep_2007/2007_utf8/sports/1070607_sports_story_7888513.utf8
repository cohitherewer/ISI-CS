 Atwal eyes a decent finish

Memphis: Arjun Atwal will be eyeing a decent finish at the Stanford St Jude Championship his sixth start this season on the PGA Tour. 

The Indian has had a forgettable season with four missed cuts in five starts and has not made one cut on the PGA Tour since his first event of the year, the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. 

Atwal can take heart from his improved putting, and the fact that he finished tied 14th and 18th in the last two weeks on US Nationwide Tour. 

Atwal tees off with Tripp Isenhour and Jeff Overton on Thursday. 

Meanwhile, Phil Mickelson is unsure about his start at the event after pulling out of the Memorial meet last week. This is the last event before the US Open at Oakmont from June 14. 

Gaurav Ghei, meanwhile, will spearhead the Indian challenge at the Bangkok Airways Open, which tees off at the Santiburi Samui County Club on Thursday. 

Ghei heads an eight-member Indian squad which comprises Rahil Gangjee, s.s.p. Chowrasia, Amandeep Johl, Digvijay Singh, Arjun Singh, Amardip Malik and Gurbaaz Mann.

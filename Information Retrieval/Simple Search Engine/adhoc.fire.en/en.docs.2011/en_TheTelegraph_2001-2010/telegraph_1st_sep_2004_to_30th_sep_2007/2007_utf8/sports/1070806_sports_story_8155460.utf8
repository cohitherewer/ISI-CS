 India escape with draw

 - WARM-UP TIE 

 - Vandort cracks strokeful 117; Laxman, Dhoni fail again 

 Michael Vandort scored 117 

Leicester: Indian batsmen stumbled in the second innings even as their three-day warm-up tie against Sri Lanka A ended in a draw at the Grace Road Ground here on Sunday. 

Set a target of 294 in 55 overs, the Indians struggled before ending at 187 for six as time ran out for the Lankans. 

This was after opener Michael Vandort struck a stroke-filled century that enabled Sri Lanka A to declare their second innings at 265 for seven. 

Of particular concern to the Indian camp ahead of the third Test, starting at The Oval on Thursday, would be the second failure of V.V.S. Laxman (3) and Mahendra Singh Dhoni (1). 

Captain Rahul Dravid, who showed hint of form with an unbeaten 67 in the first innings, dropped himself down the order but could manage only 15. 

However, opener Wasim Jaffer produced another impressive knock of 55 at the top of the order. Left-hander Gautam Gambhir held one end up with an unbeaten 53. Ramesh Powar was the other unbeaten batsman on 14. 

Despite the fact that the teams had agreed to bat for 60 overs each in the second innings, the Lankans didnt declare till 15 minutes after lunch. 

Dinesh Karthik (9) was an early casualty when he played across and was castled by Welegadara. Yuvraj Singh (33), who came in at No.3, flexed his arms and smashed a few boundaries before departing, while Dhoni also made a quick exit. 

Jaffer, however, stuck it out to play some attractive shots and kept the Sunday crowd entertained in the afternoon. 

Vandorts innings of 117 came off 186 balls with 18 shots to the fence. 

The 27-year-old had also impressed with his skill and patience in the first innings when he made 52. 

In the second, he continued to make light work of the Indian bowling, playing some delightful strokes all round the wicket. He featured in a 113-run partnership for the second wicket with Dilruwan Perera (49) who missed his half-century by a run when he was run out in a mix-up with his partner. 

Vandort had another useful stand of 81 for the third wicket with captain Thilan Samaraweera (24). 

Such was his control and composure that even in the 90s, Vandort showed no signs of nerves. He struck Anil Kumble for two boundaries in an over to bring up his hundred. He eventually fell trying to force the pace. 

Captain Samaraweera followed him to the pavilion just before lunch when he offered a return catch to Powar. 

As the Sri Lankan wickets tumbled, Dravid pressed his part-timers into operation in the few overs before lunch. Laxman ended up picking the wicket of Kaushal Lokuarachchi, who made 16.

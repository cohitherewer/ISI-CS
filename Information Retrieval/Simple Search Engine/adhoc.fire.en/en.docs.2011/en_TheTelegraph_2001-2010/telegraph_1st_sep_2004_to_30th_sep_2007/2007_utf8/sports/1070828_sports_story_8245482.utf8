The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No favourites, says Lawson

Karachi: Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson believes that the battle in the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 is open and no team is favourite to win the title in South Africa next month. 

Since this is the first time the Twenty20 world meet is being organised, it is premature to nominate any team as a favourite to win the title. As far as Pakistan is concerned, the guys have worked hard and I have passed on some winning tips to them, he said. 

I am hopeful that the Pakistani players will not disappoint their countrymen, the Australian added.

 Melbourne: Cricket umpire Simon Taufel has been named Official of the Year at the Australian Sports Awards presentation here.

 Taufel won the award from other stand out officials Mark Shield (soccer) and Scot Butler (basketball) at a ceremony on Wednesday night.

 The 36-year-old said the recognition of umpires and officials was important to continue building the value of sport in Australian culture.

 I hope that this form of recognition creates awareness that officials are an integral part of the game and encourages other members of the community to look at match officiating as a way of contributing to their chosen favourite sport, he said.

 Rome: Sampdoria captain Francesco Flachi was suspended by the Italian soccer league on Thursday, a day after the Italian Olympic committee (CONI) announced that the 31-year-old striker had tested positive for cocaine. Traces of the drug were found in the players system in a random anti-doping test after Sampdorias 0-2 home defeat to league leaders Inter Milan on January 28.

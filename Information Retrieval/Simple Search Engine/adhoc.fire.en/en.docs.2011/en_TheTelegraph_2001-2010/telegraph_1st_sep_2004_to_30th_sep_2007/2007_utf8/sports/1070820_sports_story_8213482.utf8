Mumbai: Zaheer Khan was upgraded from C to B grade and can leapfrog to the topmost tier, A, in the Indian cricket boards central contracts, if he continues with his impressive show, sources revealed after the BCCIs finance committee meeting here on Sunday. 

Grade B players get Rs 35 lakh annually while grade A players take home Rs 50 lakh annually. For grade C it is Rs 20 lakh. 

Meanwhile, Dinesh Karthik, who was highly successful as a makeshift opener in the recent Test series in England, has qualified for the boards contracts as per the eligibility criteria.

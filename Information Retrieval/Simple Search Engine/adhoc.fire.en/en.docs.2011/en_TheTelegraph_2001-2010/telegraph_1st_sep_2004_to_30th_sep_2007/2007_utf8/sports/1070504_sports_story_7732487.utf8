Calcutta: There is no need to worry about Sachin Tendulkars injury. He is fine. The maestro himself sent out this message during Thursdays afternoon practice session at Eden Gardens. 

When the players were sweating it out in the morning, Sachin was receiving ice treatment at the team hotel. Some five hours later, he was back at the ground. 

As Ravi Shastri and Co. was forced to start the second session indoors, owing to the wet outfield after a steady drizzle, Sachin did some knocking that lasted nearly half an hour. He later joined teammates on the field but did not bat at nets. 

No ice pack strapped to his ankle and in no visible discomfort, Sachin was all ears to a discussion between Shastri and Virender Sehwag. 

Though Sachin has shown encouraging signs of improvement, the final call on his return to full-fledged net sessions will be taken by physio John Gloster on Friday morning. 

Sachin sprained his right ankle while negotiating a bouncer from Sreesanth on Wednesday afternoon. 

It has also been learnt that some heavy bats were delivered to Sachin on his request. 

Chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar will join the camp on Friday and will be with the players till Sunday. 

If yoga guru Sukhdev Kumars pranayam was an addition to the camp on Day II, the emphasis during the first session was on physical fitness and fielding drills. 

An easygoing ambience may have replaced the strict regime of Greg Chappell, but the players getting continuously engaged in catching practices, pick-ups and throws under the vigil of Team India thinktank was quite reminiscent of the old days. 

Bengals Manoj Tiwary got a pat from fielding coach Robin Singh and a clap from captain Rahul Dravid for his agility and excellence during the drills. 

Former captain Sourav Ganguly was the first to bat in the afternoon session on a grassless track after the indoor nets. The young Piyush Chawla and Rajesh Pawar were disdainfully despatched all around the park as Sourav and Yuvraj Singh were aggression personified. 

Back at the team hotel, Venkatesh Prasad sat down with the bowlers, explaining their shortcomings and suggesting ways to sort them out. He also encouraged feedback from the players.

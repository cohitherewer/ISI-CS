 Hes stupid, says wife Rachael

London: Andrew Flintoffs wife Rachael and their two children will fly to the West Indies next week, according a tabloid report appearing here. 

In an interview with the tabloid, Rachael, a 28-year-old model, said the first thing she will say to her husband is: stupid bugger! 

Flintoff, the star of Englands 2005 Ashes success, was one of six players fined following a late-night drinking session after a six-wicket defeat to New Zealand on Friday. 

He was also stripped of the vice-captaincy and dropped for the match against Canada. His alcohol-fuelled exploits culminated in him being helped to shore after falling off a pedalo. 

Rachael, however, defended him. Andrew is extremely hard-working and extremely loyal. What you see is what you get. You can see how hard-working he is with his cricket. He can be in complete pain and covered in blisters and will still keep going for five more days.

 Atwal ends in tied 54th position

Wichita (US): Arjun Atwal ran into a disastrous triple bogey on a par-five on the back nine and ended with a two-over 73 that saw him drop to tied 54th at the Preferred Health Systems Wichita Open Golf Championship. 

Atwal, who is attempting to climb back to the US PGA Tour via a top-25 finish on money list on Nationwide Tour, saw his hopes suffer a setback with two bogeys and one triple bogey though he did have four birdies. He finished at five-under 279. 

Brad Elder (65) emerged winner by four shots over Argentine Fabian Gomez. It was Elders second win in the tournament, the first having come in 1999, when he won two events in the Nationwide Tour. 

Atwal had bogeys on first, eighth and 17th and a triple bogey on par-five 14th. He birdied the third, seventh, 13th and 15th. 

The $90,000 winners cheque moved Elder from no. 45 on the money list to no. 15 and on pace to finish inside top-25 to earn his 2008 PGA Tour card. 

Gomez shot a bogey-free 65 for his first top-10 finish of the rookies career. The runner-up finish moved him to 60th on the money list. (PTI)

 CA, players tussle likely after Cup

Melbourne: Australian players are ready to tackle the Cricket Australia (CA) head-on as they feel their latest contract was too stringent and did not allow them to pursue personal sponsorships. 

The players are angry that CAs three-year multi-million-dollar deal with the Commonwealth Bank has been so heavily protected that it does not allow players to deal with other companies in any way associated with the broader financial market. Commonwealth Bank sponsors the annual tri-series, the one-day team and the Centre of Excellence. 

It is understood that up to four players have missed out on thousands of dollars because of the deal and the Australian Cricketers Association (ACA) has briefed player managers, who are ready to back the ACA. 

The players are looking at some action against Cricket Australia, a prominent manager said requesting anonymity. I think something will hot up very soon. At the end of the day, there were three or four players who had minor deals in that category he was quoted as saying by an Australian daily. 

ACA chief executive Paul Marsh said he would be ready to take action once the World Cup was over as he didnt want the issue to distract players in their quest for a third World Cup title. There is going to be a fight but we will wait until after the World Cup before we take our next steps, he said.

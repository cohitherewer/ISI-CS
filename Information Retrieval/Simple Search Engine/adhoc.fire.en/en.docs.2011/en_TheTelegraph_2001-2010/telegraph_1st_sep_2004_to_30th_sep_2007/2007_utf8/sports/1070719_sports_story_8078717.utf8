The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 As captain, 

 Dravid should be more aggressive

 - The iconic Kapil Dev on the India-England series 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 

 Kapil Dev

 London: Kapil Devs 

 credentials are well-known. Indeed, among other things, 

 it was under his captaincy that India last won a Test series 

 in England (1986). Thats the tour when we won our 

 only Test at Lords too. On Wednesday, the New Delhi-based 

 chairman of the newly-formed Indian Cricket League spoke 

 to The Telegraph on the India-England series which 

 gets underway some hours from now.

 The following are 

 excerpts

 On having won the 1983 

 World Cup final at Lords and also having been the 

 captain when we won our only Test there

 Its a special ground... 

 Theres so much of history... Im proud of what 

 we did at Lords in 1983 and three years later... Lords 

 is the home of cricket and performances dont go unnoticed. 

 On his thoughts ahead of another 

 face-off at Lords

 Weve got to play smart... 

 The bowlers must be disciplined and the batsmen have to 

 plan session-by-session... Our approach has to be to win, 

 otherwise the team should come home... In the Eighties, 

 a total of 250-260 in a day was considered good, but today 

 youve got to score in excess of 300... The bar has 

 been raised and youve got to play according to the 

 times. 

 On the favourites

 Playing at home, the advantage 

 is definitely with England... After all, the weather can 

 be a big factor and the Englishmen know the conditions better 

 than us... As you must have seen, the weather may change 

 twice within a session... The batters, therefore, have to 

 plan sensibly. 

 On his message for the Indian 

 batsmen

 Take responsibility... One delivery 

 can change everything, so be cautious. At the same time, 

 dont get into a negative mindset... A smart approach 

 should do the trick. 

 On tips for the new-ball bowlers

 Bowl within yourself and dont 

 get carried away... Trying to do too many things could cost 

 dear... Stick to the basics of a good line and length... 

 We dont have bowlers with express pace, but theyve 

 got the ability to move the ball. Its an important 

 quality.

 On whether Anil Kumble will 

 have a big role to play

 Its possible... (Adds 

 laughing) I dont need to tell him what to do... 

 He knows his role only too well.

 On Englands attack being 

 hit by injuries

 Its part of life and part 

 of the game...

 On Monty Panesar

 Hes a much improved bowler 

 and is in form... In the past, we havent played some 

 of the spinners well overseas... There has to be a strategy 

 for Panesar and we must take the attack to him... He was 

 raw in the last series (early 2006, in India), but not so 

 now.

 On Rahul Dravid getting closer 

 to completing two years as full-time captain

 Look, as captain, Dravid should 

 be more aggressive... He needs to plot to win, not play 

 safe.

 On Michael Vaughan as captain

 Hes rated very highly but, 

 frankly, I havent seen enough of him to form an opinion... 

 Finally, on Team India functioning 

 without a coach

 Do we have to follow the rest 

 of the world? We must look at whats best for our team, 

 not at what the world is doing... Weve got two specialist 

 coaches (Venkatesh Prasad, Robin Singh) and theres 

 a cricket manager (Chandu Borde)... At the highest level, 

 I dont think you need a coach... The requirement is 

 that of a man-manager. Aap samjhe?

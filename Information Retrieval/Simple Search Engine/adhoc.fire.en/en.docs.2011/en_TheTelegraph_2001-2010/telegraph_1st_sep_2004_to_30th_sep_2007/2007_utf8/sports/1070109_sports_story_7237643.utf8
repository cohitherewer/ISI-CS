 Baskaran to stay, says IHF

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Despite Indias rank bad performance in the just-concluded Asian Games, the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) is in no mood to replace national coach Vasudevan Baskaran in the next few months. 

While IHF secretary K. Jyothikumaran said that Baskaran, in all probability, would be in charge during the next international assignment India-Pakistan series in April federation sources indicated that Baskaran-Harendra Singh combination is likely to continue in spite of the recent debacle. 

Speaking to The Telegraph on Monday from Chennai, Jyothikumaran said the IHF has no plans to replace the national coach. 

At the moment, we are in the midst of a major domestic tournament (Premier Hockey League). 

We hope pick up fresh talents from this meet. I dont think there will be any major change in the technical department. 

IHF sources said poor performance in the Asian Games, where India finished outside the medal bracket for the first time, raised demands for Baskarans removal, but lack of a suitable replacement has forced the federation to think otherwise. 

The IHF, at the moment, has no one in hand to replace Baskaran, sources said. The coaches who have been picked for PHL are either too young (like Mukesh Kumar) or veterans (like Sodhi), who cannot be considered for the national job, they said.

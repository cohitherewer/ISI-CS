 Explosive start to Twenty20

- Hosts SA overhaul 

 West Indies rsquo; 205/6

Johannesburg: Chris Gayle slammed the first century in Twenty20 Internationals, but it wasnt enough as aided by West Indies wretched bowling and poor fielding, South Africa scripted a stunning chase and won the opening match of the ICC World Twenty20 by eight wickets with 14 balls to spare. 

Earlier, the 27-year-old Gayle opened the innings and hammered the South African attack for a record 10 sixes as he made 117 off just 57 balls. The West Indies posted a mammoth 205 for six. 

But Herschelle Gibbs, with a dazzling unbeaten 90, guided the hosts with utmost ease. He got good support from captain Graeme Smith (28) and Justin Kemp (46 ..). 

To give an idea of the visitors slipshod ways, they conceded as many as 28 extras, a world record in Twenty20 Internationals. 

Gayle started as he meant to continue, with a square drive so powerful that it burst through the hands of backward point on its way to the rope. And after a relatively uneventful over from Makhaya Ntini, sporting a new hairdo, Gayle teed off against Shaun Pollock, with an astonishing whip off his pads that landed next to his team-mates in the dug-out square of the wicket. 

South Africa went wicketless until the 14th over as Gayle and Devon Smith put on an opening stand of 145 off 86 balls, the highest in Twenty20 history beating the unbroken 132 made by South Africas Graeme Smith and Loots Bosman against Pakistan in Johannesburg earlier this year. 

The left-handed Gayle preferred the aerial route, hitting seven fours and his 10 sixes doubled the record of five shared by Australians Ricky Ponting, Damian Martyn and Adam Gilchrist. 

Gayle was eventually dismissed in the 17th over when he attempted a hook off Johan van der Wath.

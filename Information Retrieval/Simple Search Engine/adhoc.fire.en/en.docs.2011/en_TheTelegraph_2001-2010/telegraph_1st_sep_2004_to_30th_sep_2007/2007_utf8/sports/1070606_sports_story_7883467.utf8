 England eager to keep up the good show

 Gerrard has been Englands guiding light through a dark, storm-tossed season 

Steven Gerrard has never ducked a challenge, as some opponents have found to their painful cost, and he has been Englands guiding light through a dark, storm-tossed season. Gerrard sat in his Salford hotel Monday, and talked passionately about his support for Steve McClaren, for colleagues like Frank Lampard and David Beckham, and how all Englands players need to prove themselves. 

Im one of the more experienced players now, and to see the criticism Steve took was unfair because he was doing everything right, said Gerrard, ahead of Wednesdays vital Euro 2008 qualifier in Estonia. He was preparing us right, telling us the right things. And he believed in us as players. I believe a manager can only do so much. The players have to do the main part of the job on the pitch. 

Dont get me wrong: hes the England manager and stick comes with the job. But its no good us as players hiding behind that. We cant just think its all right because the managers taking all the flak. Weve got to get out there and take the heat off him. We are the so-called best players in England. 

England have not turned the corner just yet. I dont think, after one good performance against Brazil (last Fridays 1-1 draw), you can sit here a couple of days later and say everythings great, weve turned the corner. That would be wrong, because we might go back to the way we were in a couple of days time. Weve got to prove it over a long time. Weve got to beat Estonia and move up this group. Then we can go and prove to people we are a good team by doing well in a tournament. 

In training at Carrington, Gerrard lined up in central midfield with Lampard flanked by Beckham and Joe Cole and working the ball quickly towards Michael Owen and Alan Smith in attack. Peter Crouch is an option for Smith, as is Wayne Bridge for Nicky Shorey at left-back, while McClaren also looked at Kieron Dyer and Wes Brown in the right-back role. 

Dyer made his international debut as an attacking right-back against Luxembourg in 1999, and would make a useful impact if England struggle to break down Estonia. Dyers introduction would provide some useful pace behind Beckham. 

Results in Group E over the weekend were hardly kind to England, with Croatia, Israel and Russia all winning to move further clear of McClarens side. Croatia lead the group with 16 points from six games, Israel have 14 after seven, Russia 14 and England 11 from six. 

They werent great for us but Im not going to concede that we are playing for second straight away, added Gerrard. All those teams have still got to come to Wembley. If we play like we did against Brazil we can beat all of them. As for finishing top, I still think its wide open. 

Gerrard believes the Wembley factor will inspire England and intimidate visitors. It is an amazing stadium inside and when you walk out. Because it took so long there was a lot of excitement there. Its great to be part of the England team knowing that thats our home ground for every game. I dont think anyone else has got a stadium like that. 

Kaka and Ronaldinho were duly closed down by Gerrard and Lampard, whose booing by some England fans angered Gerrard. It was a shock to me actually. I was aware of it before the game. You hear it on the tannoy as they go through the names. The majority of the team got a cheer but not for Frank. He got a few jeers. I never said anything to him but I was quite shocked. 

As a football player it can affect you two ways: you either go into a shell or you puff your chest out, take it on the chin and get on with it. You use it to drive you on. Ive had a few jeers in my time. You get on with it. I know the way Frank will go. He will beat them. 

Hell score a wonder goal in the next few games or put in a wonderful performance. Lets have it right we all know Frank. Hes a world-class player. We are so lucky to have Frank Lampard in an England shirt. I play against him when hes at Chelsea and hes a nightmare to play against. You see him every week scoring goals. For me the ability is there. 

The great Gerrard-Lampard debate has been given an added twist by Beckhams recall. Gerrards eyes flickered with amusement at the suggestion that Beckhams return to the right flank guarantees the Liverpool dynamo will start in the middle. Id be a liar if I said I didnt have a little smile when I saw his name back in the squad. 

I welcomed him back because I felt he was still a top player. Hes hit a great spell at Real Madrid, you watch him and think hes still good enough to play for England. I dont think it changes my game.

 Plane crash cuts short Australian practice

Kingston: Australias first training session, ahead of their World Cup campaign in the Caribbean, was cut short by a plane crash just 200m near their practice venue, officials said on Sunday. 

A light plane crashed near the Arnos Vale ground on the St Vincent island which led the world champions to reduce their practice stint to 30 minutes. 

Mike Hussey was batting in the nets at the far side of the ground when the accident happened near the 12,000-seat capacity cricket ground. 

There were no serious injuries. The pilot, co-pilot and two passengers from St Vincent sustained minor bruises and were able to walk away from the overturned plane, witnesses said. 

The single-engine Cessna 172, which airport director Cordel Robinson said was a private plane registered in Barbados, was attempting to touch down at ET Joshua airport in Kingstown when it crashed into a fence and came to rest in a stream. 

Phillip Hope, spokesman for the Australian squad, said the players were unfazed by the crash. 

I do not think this is really going to create any panic among the players, Hope said. 

Meanwhile, Australians say they will approach the ninth World Cup as hunters rather than the prey after losing their No.1 ranking to South Africa. 

Speaking to reporters after a practice session on Saturday, Hussey said it had been disappointing to lose the top spot to South Africa. 

The two teams meet in the final group A match in St Kitts on March 24. 

I guess we become the hunters rather than the hunted, said Hussey, who captained Australia in the absence of the injured Ricky Ponting in their 0-3 whitewash to New Zealand last month. 

We really enjoyed being the No.1 side in the world and we tried harder and harder to increase the gap between the No.1 amp; 2. 

We now have to try to get that place back, we have to try and make the gap bigger again. 

Australia play a warm-up match against Zimbabwe on Tuesday followed by a game against England four days later before travelling to St Kitts. 

Opener Matthew Hayden and allrounder Andrew Symonds will not be considered for Mondays match while they recover from a broken toe and torn left arm muscle, respectively, but Ponting and allrounder Michael Clarke played full part in Saturdays practice. 

Ponting had been suffering from a hip injury while Clarke had a sore back. 

Hayden walked briskly around the outfield several times and Symonds had a few gentle throwdowns in the nets with a tennis ball. 

Hussey said Australia had put the New Zealand defeats behind them and were ready for the challenge of the biggest World Cup yet. 

The Australians are meticulous about their preparation, he said. 

They are an experienced side who know their own game so well and what they need to do. 

I just want Australia to win, thats all. If thats in the first over or the 50th over, the most important thing is the result.

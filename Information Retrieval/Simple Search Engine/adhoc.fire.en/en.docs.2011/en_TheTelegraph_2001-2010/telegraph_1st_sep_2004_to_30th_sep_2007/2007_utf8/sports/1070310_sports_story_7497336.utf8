 Zimbabwe sail past Bermuda

Kingstown: Sean Williams nearly gave up on Zimbabwe but on Thursday he was glad he kept the faith after leading them to a six-wicket win over Bermuda in their final World Cup warm-up match. 

The 20-year-old, who once refused a call-up when his father urged him to stick with his studies, hit 72 not out as Zimbabwe reached their target of 137 in 29 overs. 

Administration wrangles have ripped the heart out of the Zimbabwe side and led to their Test status being removed, although they are due to return to the five-day arena in November. 

Williams almost turned his back on the side again last year given the problems within the board but his cool knock boosted Zimbabwes confidence after Tuesdays 106-run defeat to Australia in their first warm-up. 

Asked if he was glad he had stuck by Zimbabwe, Williams said: Yes definitely. I went away to try to get some experience and came back and continued where I left off, he said at a news conference. 

Bermuda, who were bowled out for 45 and lost by 241 runs to England on Monday, made 136 with Janeiro Tucker making a cultured 52 off 88 balls. 

Paceman Anthony Ireland was Zimbabwes best bowler with three for 22 off eight overs including three maidens. 

Burly Bermudan left-arm spinner Dwayne Leverock, who weighed in with two for 32 against England despite his 19-stone frame, took another two wickets.

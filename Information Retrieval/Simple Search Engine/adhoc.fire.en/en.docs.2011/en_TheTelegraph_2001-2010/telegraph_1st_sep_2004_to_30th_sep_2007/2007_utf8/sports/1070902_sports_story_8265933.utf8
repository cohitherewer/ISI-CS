The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Flintoff doubtful

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The ECB has said in a statement that allrounder Andrew Flintoff has been experiencing some discomfort in his left ankle and did not bowl during Saturdays practice session. 

According to information received here, Flintoff suffered a reaction following Thursdays match and has undergone scans on the ankle which require further review. 

His ankle discomfort, however, is in no way related to the knee injury he sustained earlier in the series. 

A decision on Flintoffs availability will be taken later, the statement added.

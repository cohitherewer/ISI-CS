 on opening day 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta:

 on Wednesday, the opening day of the monsoon season. Determined 

 to boost his last seasons tally of seven, Khan saddled 

 three winners in the afternoons card. Much was expected 

 from the city schoolers, Javed Khan and Robin Corner, but 

 the duo could manage only a winner apiece. While Javeds 

 Helegonia just about prevailed, Corners Body And Soul 

 picked up the main event, the Vagabond Cup. Trainer Vikash 

 , however, led in a brace of winners Schumacher and Qba.

 Not going overboard: Bhaichung

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi: Indias victory celebrations over Portuguese side Recreativo Agueda turned sour on Monday morning when the team management was informed about the death of midfielder Clifford Mirandas father in Goa. 

Clifford is rushing back home immediately though he has not been told of his fathers death, said a team member from Portugal. Miranda knows that his father is serious and has been admitted to hospital. The Dempo player is expected to reach Goa by Wednesday afternoon. Mirandas father, Patrick, 57, passed away after prolonged illness. 

Barring this shocking news, Indian footballers were in a relaxed mood throughout the day. Happy with the teams 3-0 win (as reported in Mondays Late City edition), chief coach Bob Houghton decided to give the players a day off from practice. 

The coach was happy, but told us not to read too much into this victory, said captain Bhaichung Bhutia, who played a major role in the win. 

The coach said that at the moment our focus should be on the ONGC Cup. What we are going through here is only pre-season training, the seasoned striker said. 

Bhaichung praised Houghtons plan to field all players in both the matches. Normally, second line players dont get much chance to showcase their skills. This system has left the team with a lot of options. 

Manjit Singh, who scored Indias first goal on Sunday, was fielded in the midfield by Houghton. The Mahindra striker did well in the unusual position and struck off a pass from Sunil Chhetri.

 Sachin, Sourav set for ODI recall

 - TEAM INDIA SELECTION 

 - Ranadeb in contention for Test berth 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly 

Calcutta: Former captains Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly are set to be recalled for the four ODIs in Ireland and one in Scotland. 

Both had been rested for the ODI series in Bangladesh, Team Indias first engagement after a disastrous World Cup. 

Theres no reason why they wont be back, one of the five selectors told The Telegraph on Monday evening, the eve of the selection committee meeting in New Delhi. 

While the first ODI is against Ireland on June 22, the next three are versus South Africa. The ODI in Scotland (July 3) is against Pakistan. 

The selectors will also pick a 16-man squad for the three-Test series in England. 

Indications are that Virender Sehwag is again only going to be selected for the ODIs, while Harbhajan Singh could make a return to the Test squad. 

Harbhajan was ignored for both the ODIs and Tests in Bangladesh. Its a tough phase in his career. 

Rookie mediumpacer Ranadeb Bose, by the way, is in the running for a place in the Test squad. 

Ajit Agarkar, dropped after the World Cup, may come into the reckoning for the ODIs. 

The squad for the seven ODIs versus England, after the Test series, will be picked at a later date. 

Footnote: The Graham Ford-development has stumped the selectors, too. Wed been planning to have his views on the telephone Now, its all so hazy, remarked one of the quintet. Thats an understatement.

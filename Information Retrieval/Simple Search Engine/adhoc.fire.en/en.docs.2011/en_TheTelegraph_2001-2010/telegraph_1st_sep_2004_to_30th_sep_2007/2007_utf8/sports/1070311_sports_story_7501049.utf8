The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Time to inject fresh blood

Stickwork

Gurbux Singh

The recently-concluded Professional Hockey League (PHL) has shown, in more ways than one, what Indian hockey needs at present. On the one hand, it has given us a fair idea of how to revamp the internal structure, and more importantly, it has shown us that its time to reject the old-timers and inject fresh blood. 

Several youngsters were in the thick of action during the PHL, but not many impressed me. But it should not change our focus from the youth policy. 

Baljit Singh Dhillon, who had a good career, announced his retirement before the best-of-three finals in Chandigarh. Many of his contemporaries are past their prime as well. 

Theres no point in persisting with the old guard. A dose of fresh blood may not help us get success immediately, but its worth a try as we are not achieving anything with the old hands. 

Coming back to the PHL, Orissa Steelers emerged deserving champions. The fitness of youngsters obviously played a key role against the relatively older Sher-e-Jalandhar outfit. 

The Steelers also owed their success to the time-tested experience of captain Dilip Tirkey and Pakistan goalkeeper Salman Akbar. 

That the finals would go the distance was beyond my expectations. However, when Rs 40 lakh was there to be won, it surely was incentive enough to play for. 

In the first final, I think Steelers were overawed by the big names of the Jalandhar side. But they got the confidence, composure and the necessary cutting edge when it mattered most. 

The decider, which Steelers won 4-3 after an engrossing battle, was also a bad advertisement for Indian hockey. Jalandhar players were not gracious in defeat, pushing and manhandling senior international umpire Satender Sharma to protest Tirkeys winner towards the end. Video replays had to be seen before the goal was confirmed, but the damage was already done by then. 

Though I want to reserve comments about the decision on that goal, I was surprised to see Sharmas refusal to continue following the ruckus. The Jalandhar players remonstrations against reserve umpire Suresh Kumar were also uncalled for and its high time the guilty need to be strongly disciplined. 

The players have no right to take the law into their hands and should have realised the implication of such behaviour when the match was telecast live in about 40 countries. What is more worrying is that many team officials have also been found wanting on discipline and restraint. 

The Indian Hockey Federation is exploring the idea of selecting a pool of 100-odd players for the next PHL, and then divide them into various teams. It will not only provide a balance to the teams, but also give us a chance to look into the future of Indian hockey more thoroughly. 

The players will now be assembling at the national camp for the Azlan Shah meet. Then, we will be playing the Champions Trophy qualifiers also involving England, New Zealand, Belgium, Argentina and Japan. This will be followed by the big test of qualifying for the Beijing Olympics. 

The Doha disappointment is a thing of the past and lets hope for a bright future.

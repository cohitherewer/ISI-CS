The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 2003: If you dont remember

24 february 2003, Kenya vs Sri Lanka Kenya won by 53 runs. Eight thousand-odd cheering fans watched in shocked disbelief as Sri Lanka committed harakiri and ensured a second position for Kenya in the Pool B table ahead of New Zealand (who refused to travel to Kenya), West Indies and South Africa. Put in to bat, Kenya began enthusiastically racing to 46/1 in the 7th over. Kenedy Obuya (60) led the way. Muttiah Muralidharan contained the flow of runs in the middle overs and Kenya posted a modest 210/9. Sri Lanka did not realise what hit them until they were 105/5. Aravinda de Silvas (41) effort in the later half went in vain as the Lankans fell to the guiles of Collins Obuya (5/24). Sri Lankan skipper Sanath Jayasuriya later said that this was the worst match of his career. 

26 February 2003, India vs England India won by 82 runs. After winning the toss India elected to bat and cheered by a hugely partisan crowd put up 250/9 in their allotted overs. Sachin Tendulkar (50) and Virendra Sehwag (23) gave the early impetus and 75 runs came in the first 11 overs. The middle overs were somewhat subdued, but Rahul Dravid (62) and Yuvraj Singh (42) ensured India had something to defend. The last four Indian wickets failed to add a single run. England began disastrously when Nick Knight, after calling for an optimistic sharp single from the first ball of the second over, was thrown out by the diving Mohammed Kaif at extra cover. They failed to recover and were put on the backfoot by Zaheer Khan (2/29) and Ashish Nehra (6/23) and at 62/5 the chase was all but over. A swollen ankle did not deter Nehra (10-2-23-6) from putting up a masterful display of seam and swing bowling. The night before the match Nehra remained doubtful of participation but the physio and trainer ensured that he was fit enough to take the field the next day. His brilliant show in this match ranks fifth in the all-time list of World Cup bowling performances. 

3 march 2003, South Africa vs Sri Lanka Match tied.With this match one can say that South Africa completed a hattrick of bizarre exits from the World Cup. Batting first Sri Lanka posted an imposing 268/9 largely due to Maravan Atapattu (124) and Aravinda de Silva (73). South Africa began the chase confidently with Graeme Smith (35) and Herschelle Gibbs (73). The rain came, and as a result of the revised target, the hosts needed 229 in 45 overs. At one stage, the hosts needed 40 runs from 30 balls. In the greatest example of miscommunication on a cricket field ever, only after Mark Boucher played the last ball defensively and didnt attempt a single did South Africa realise that they had only tied the match and not won it. Despite best efforts of the groundsmen, the match couldnt resume. The curse of the host nation continued to haunt the World Cup yet again.

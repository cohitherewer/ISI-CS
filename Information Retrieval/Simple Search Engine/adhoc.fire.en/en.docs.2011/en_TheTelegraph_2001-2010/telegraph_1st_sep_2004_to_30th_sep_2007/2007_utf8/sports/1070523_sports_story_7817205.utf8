 Bashar counts positives

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chittagong: Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar believes his team will enjoy a psychological advantage going into the second and final Test in Dhaka, starting from Friday. 

According to Bashar, his team would draw inspiration from their show in the first Test and put pressure on India in Dhaka. 

We have shown a lot of character in this match. The way we fought back from 149 for eight and denied India enforce follow-on is the highlight of the match. It gives us a lot of inspiration and I think we now have a little psychological advantage ahead of the final Test, the middle-order batsman said after the rain-marred first Test ended in a draw here on Tuesday. 

Coach Dav Whatmore echoed the same sentiment. Its very satisfying to see how our boys fought back. Full credit to Mashrafe Mortaza and Shahadat Hossain for helping us stay alive in the match, said the Australian, who will relinquish his post after the series. 

In fact Bashar said they were fancying for a win in the Test after Rahul Dravids declaration, setting a target of 250. 

We wanted to keep our wickets intact in the first few overs. After seeing off the initial overs, we thought of going after the target at one point of time. But chasing 250 in 43 overs was not an easy task, he said. 

Whatmore believed draw was a just result in the end. 

We were shaky in the first innings and India were right on top. It would have been a lot harder for us to draw the match had not many sessions been lost to rain, he said.

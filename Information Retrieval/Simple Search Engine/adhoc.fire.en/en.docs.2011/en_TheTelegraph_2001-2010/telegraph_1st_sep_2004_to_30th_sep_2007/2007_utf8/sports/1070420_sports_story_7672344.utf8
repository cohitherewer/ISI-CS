 Sarwan lifts Windies to 230/5

 Ramnaresh Sarwan after his unbeaten 91 in Bridgetown on Thursday 

Bridgetown: Ramnaresh Sarwan slammed an unbeaten 91 in host West Indies modest 230 for five against Bangladesh at the World Cup on Thursday. 

Sarwan came close to his maiden World Cup century as he helped resurrect the West Indies from a top-order slump and slow run-rate in the Super Eight game. 

Seeking their first limited-overs International win over the West Indies, Bangladesh pinned the hosts down. Sarwan then shared an innings-building partnership of 81 for the fourth wicket with Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who compiled an 85-ball 50. 

Sarwan struck two sixes and five boundaries off 90 deliveries to keep the West Indies moving as the once all-conquering side sought to avert their fifth successive Supers Eight defeat. 

Brian Lara contributed a 27-ball cameo of 33 which featured two sixes before he lofted Razzak to Javed Omar in the covers. 

The West Indies are the only team not to have won a match in the Super Eight stage that even featured victories for unheralded Bangladesh and debutants Ireland. 

Two-time World Cup winners West Indies and unheralded Bangladesh are both out of title contention having failed to make it to the last four. Defending champions Australia, Sri Lanka, New Zealand and South Africa have already filled in the semi-final spots. 

The West Indies are hoping to salvage some pride from their last two outings after being outplayed in the previous four matches, while Bangladesh are looking to post their third shock win of the tournament against a Test-playing nation. They have already stunned former champions India in the preliminary round and South Africa in the Super Eight. 

The hosts still have another game left, Saturdays match against England in what will be a precursor to their Test and limited-overs series in England starting next month. The game in Barbados is expected to be Brian Laras last in one-day cricket. 

The West Indies got off to a torrid start, losing openers Devon Smith (5) and Chris Gayle (1) with just eight runs on the board. The Bangladesh seamers justified captain Habibul Bashars decision to put the opposition in after winning the toss. 

Smith perished in the third over as he played inside the line of Mashrafe Mortazas outswinging delivery that hit his off stump. 

Five deliveries later, paceman Syed Rasel removed out of form Chris Gayle, whose poor run of scores continued as he was trapped leg before. 

Marlon Samuels survived a first-ball edge to the slips and took time to get settled. He then unleashed some pleasant strokes as he posted a 66-ball 31 that contained four hits to the fence. 

Samuels struck Rasel for three boundaries, but was deceived by left-arm spinner Shakib al Hasan who found the edge for wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim to take the catch. 

Chanderpaul and Sarwan then grafted for runs against the accurate left-arm spinning trio of Shakib, Mohammad Rafique and Abdur Razzak, who managed to extract spin from the bare pitch. 

Sarwan showed his aggressive instincts by swinging Hasan to the midwicket fence and then lofting Rafique over extra-cover. 

Chanderpaul departed after completing his half-century, clean bowled by seamer Aftab Ahmed and Lara then helped Sarwan add 59 brisk runs.

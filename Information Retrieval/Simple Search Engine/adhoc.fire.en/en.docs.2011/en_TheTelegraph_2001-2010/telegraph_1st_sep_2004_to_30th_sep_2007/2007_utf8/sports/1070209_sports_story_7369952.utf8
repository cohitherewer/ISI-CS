The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Focus shifts to on-field action

 - Sonia Gandhi to inaugurate games in guwahati today 

Guwahati: After all the off-field suspense and drama, attention will shift to on-field action when curtains go up on the 33rd National Games here on Friday. 

The United Liberation Front of Assam (Ulfa), which had earlier given a boycott call against the Games and threatened to disrupt it, relented just a few days before the start after an appeal from eminent state sportspersons, much to the relief of everyone. 

We are relieved that Ulfa has withdrawn the boycott call. Sports can usher in peace in Assam, Indian Olympic Association president Suresh Kalmadi has said. 

The stage is now set for the Games to be inaugurated by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi at a colourful opening ceremony at the Sarusajai Sports Complex in Guwahati. 

Contingents from several participating states including those of Delhi, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Bihar, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and the north-eastern states have already arrived at the village and several more are expected over the next 24 hours. 

The torch relay converged here on Thursday from all district headquarters and were ceremonially received by chief minister Tarun Gogoi. 

The relay torch bearers arrived at the Games secretariat after a two-day run. It was then carried to the Sarusajai Sports Complex, venue of the inaugural function on Thursday, to be lit by Arjuna Awardee and 1966 Asiad gold medallist Assam Bhogeswar Baruah of Assam. Hes also the chef-de-mission of the 908-member state squad. 

Despite Ulfa withdrawing their boycott call, security forces have not let their guard down.There is a sizeable police presence in the city and stringent checks are being carried out with drivers having to furnish relevant documents on demand. 

The weather may play spoilsport on the big day, too. It has been raining for the last four days. (PTI)

 Inzamam on ICL radar

Karachi: Inzamam-ul Haq has been approached by the organisers of Indian Cricket League (ICL) to play for one of the participating teams and the former Pakistan captain is considering the proposal. 

I am excited at the prospect of playing alongside other great players. If the terms are right I will certainly play in the league, Inzamam said. 

I think the official boards have cold feet about it because of the long term repercussions they fear will occur. Obviously if the league pays good money to players, then other players would be demanding the same sort of treatment from their boards, he said. (PTI)

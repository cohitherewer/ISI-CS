 ROBERT 'BOB' ANDREW WOOLMER (1948-2007)

The Last Words 

The bookmakers and many sound judges in the sport think that Australia will win this World Cup. They are the country to beat, but I reckon South Africa are the favourites. I have seen at first hand recently how good they are

Before Pakistans World Cup opener against the West Indies 

It was our goal to take the two points through but we now will have to do the hard yards Its too early to talk about being in tight corners. Lets make sure we remain positive for the rest of the tournament

After losing to the West Indies 

We have to deal with the team we have. We are very fluid but most of all we have to make sure that we get our strategies right on the field

On the eve of the Ireland match 

I would like to sleep on my future as a coach Its what I do best, what I try to do best. Therefore Im not going to throw away coaching just like that. However, internationally I will give it some thought. Travelling and being involved non-stop in hotels and so on takes its toll

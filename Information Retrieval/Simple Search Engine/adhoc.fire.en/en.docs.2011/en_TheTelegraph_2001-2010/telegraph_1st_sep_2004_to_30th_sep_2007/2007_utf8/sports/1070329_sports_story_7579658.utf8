Once was shocking enough, twice doubly so. For the second tournament in succession, Roger Federer experienced the unthinkable against Guillermo Canas when Switzerlands world No. 1 was beaten in the fourth round of the Sony Ericsson Open by the Argentine qualifier. 

Canas, competing at only his second Masters Series since returning from a doping ban, has now exasperated Federer at both those tournaments. When was the last time that Federer looked as unhappy and uncomfortable on court as he did Tuesday? It was just over a fortnight ago when Federer was also dumped out of the draw early by a man who became one of the sports most controversial figures when he tested positive for a diuretic. 

On his second match-point, Canas, the world No. 55, slammed an ace down the middle of the court. It may well have been an air-shot from the Wimbledon champion. Anyway, Canas achieved a 7-6, 2-6, 7-6 victory which was nothing short of astonishing. 

Federer lost only five times last season, four times to Rafael Nadal and once to Andy Murray, and suddenly he has been beaten twice in his last four matches by an opponent who is far from being a Hollywood name. 

In Indian Wells earlier this month, Canas ended Federers 41-match unbeaten run, a result which prevented the Basle right-hander from moving past the record of 46 consecutive wins set by Argentine Guillermo Vilas. Here in Miami was an immediate opportunity for Federer to avenge that loss, and you sensed as the players walked out on court that Federer was desperately keen to get one over Canas. But it was not to be. 

With tennis rocked by the news that Serena Williams was subjected to racist heckling by a male spectator, and was told to hit the ball into the net like any negro would, Zina Garrison said that she felt shocked and saddened at how her friend and fellow African-American had been treated. 

Playing in her first tournament since winning Januarys Australian Open, Serena reported the racist abuse to the umpire during her third-round victory against Czech Lucie Safarova late on Monday, asking for the man to be ejected from the centre court here. 

Garrison, a former Wimbledon finalist who has close links with the Williams family, was appalled at what Serena experienced. 

Im shocked and saddened to hear what Serena had to go through in Miami. Im really disappointed that this had to happen. Im shocked that someone would say that to Serena. 

The race-abuse controversy even overshadowed Serenas fourth-round 6-1, 6-1 drubbing of Russian world No. 2 Maria Sharapova (as reported in Wednesdays Late City edition) a result was which was every bit as emphatic as the Americans one-sided success in the Australian Open final.

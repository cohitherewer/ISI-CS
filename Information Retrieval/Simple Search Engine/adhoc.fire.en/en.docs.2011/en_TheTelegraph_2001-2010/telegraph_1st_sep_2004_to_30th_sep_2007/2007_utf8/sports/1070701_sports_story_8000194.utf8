 Atwal makes the cut

Grand Blanc (US): Arjun Atwal holed a tense putt for par on the 18th and just qualified for weekend action at the Buick Open. 

Atwal, who was cruising along at four-under for the day, hit a roadblock with three bogeys and needed that short par putt to stay on for the last two rounds. With his round of one-under, the Indian was tied 57th down form 46th. 

Daniel Chopra slotted five birdies and just one bogey in a fine round of 68 that saw him rise from 46th to tied 20th at six-under 138. Brett Quigley (69) shared the lead with world No. 3 Jim Furyk (68) and Kenny Perry (63) at 10-under 134.

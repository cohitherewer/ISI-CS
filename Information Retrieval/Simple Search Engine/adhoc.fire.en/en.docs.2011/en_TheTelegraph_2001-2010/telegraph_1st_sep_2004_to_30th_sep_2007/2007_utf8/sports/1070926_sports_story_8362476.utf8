 Asif reservations

Karachi: Pakistan pacer Mohammed Asif has urged administrators to keep the number of games in the shortest format to a minimum. 

Once in four years is okay for a Twenty20 world championship because too much of it will harm Test cricket, Asif, one among the 11 Pakistani players who returned home after losing in the final to India, said. 

On the final loss to India, Asif said:They kept their nerves under pressure better than us at critical moments.

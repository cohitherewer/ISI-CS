 SA in a spot of bother

 - Ntini bags 300th scalp 

 Inzamam-ul Haq on Saturday 

Port Elizabeth: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq cracked an unbeaten 92 to dampen the celebrations of Makhaya Ntini, who took his 300th wicket for South Africa in the second Test on Saturday. 

South Africa were 115 for three in their second innings at stumps on Day II, a deficit still of 26 runs. 

Pakistan were dismissed for 265 in their first innings in reply to South Africas 124. 

Ntini, who went into the match with 295 victims and took four wickets on Friday, reached the milestone in the eighth over of the day when he had Mohammed Sami caught behind for 10. He ended the innings with six for 59. 

Pakistan slipped to 191 for nine after fast bowler Jacques Kallis had Shoaib Akhtar caught by Boucher for four and Pollock had Danish Kaneria caught by Herschelle Gibbs.

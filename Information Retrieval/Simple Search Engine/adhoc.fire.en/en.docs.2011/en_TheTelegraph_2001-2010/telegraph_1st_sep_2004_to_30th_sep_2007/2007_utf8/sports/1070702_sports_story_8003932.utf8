 Im not missing cricket: Lara

London: Brian Lara on Sunday said that he was not missing cricket at all. 

The former West Indian captain surprised everyone by announcing his retirement from international cricket following his teams early exit from the World Cup. 

My teacher said 20 something years ago that I was going to miss school. I did not, and Im not missing cricket, the 38-year-old said. Ive had 17 years of international cricket. Ive enjoyed it and thats enough. 

Lara, however, did not rule out a comeback in the Indian Cricket League or in English County cricket. 

Im still capable of playing the game, so I wouldnt say Ive hung up my boots... I can still play cricket. At what level, I dont know, he added.

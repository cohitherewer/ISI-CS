 Enthralling series in offing, feels SA coach Arthur

Karachi: Coach Mickey Arthur said on Wednesday South Africas tour of Pakistan was a chance to bring on younger players. 

We have a couple of good series coming up. So we have a chance to blood a young team that could carry us for a couple of years, Arthur said hours after South Africa arrived for two Tests and five one-day Internationals in Pakistan. 

Both teams want to go up the Test rankings and that could make this series enthralling. 

The South Africans arrived amid heavy security and captain Graeme Smith said this was part of international sport and teams had to get used to it. 

I am not going to lie. It is different (from) back home. But it is not the first time we are coming to Pakistan. We are realistic about it, he said. 

We have security personnel travelling with us round the world and it is something we have come to terms with. The security here is also fantastic. We trust the people on the job and that allows us to go out there and focus on cricket. 

Smith said he was looking forward to a good series in Pakistan, with a number of his players having had the experience of playing in the sub-continent. 

Hopefully they can pass on their thinking and thought process and planning to the younger guys in this series, he said. 

Smith, who lost the 2003 Test series in Pakistan, said his team may feel the need for another specialist spinner on Pakistani pitches. 

But to have good bowling options you must have options back home. Right now we have Paul Harris and he has worked and prepared hard for this tour. He is a good bowler and hopefully he will deliver for us, he said. 

Smith said he was not worrying about whether senior Pakistan players Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Yousuf and Inzamam-ul Haq would play in the Test series. 

We believe in going about our usual thought process. But obviously Yousuf is a top-class player and was Test Player of the Year, he said. 

But I think Pakistan are also going through a rebuilding process and must get used to it. 

Praising his Pakistan counterparts captaincy skills, Smith said Shoaib Malik was a very talented player but the people and selectors needed to be patient with him. 

He is 25 years and he showed good stuff in the Twenty20 world meet. For him, I think the real challenge will come against us and in coming series against India and Australia. But I wish him well, he said. 

Smith has expressed his concerns about the flight of young players to County cricket in England but said he understood why some veterans chose to join the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL).

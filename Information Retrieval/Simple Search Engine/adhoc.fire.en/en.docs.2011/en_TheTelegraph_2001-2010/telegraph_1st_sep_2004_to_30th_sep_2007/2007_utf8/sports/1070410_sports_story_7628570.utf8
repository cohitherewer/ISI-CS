 The last round hurt me, says Jeev

Augusta: Jeev Milkha Singhs performance in his first US Masters, where the course was not kind to anybody, was creditable despite a final round 79 on Sunday that saw him finish at tied 37th. For three days, he had been patient and managed the course so well, but lost all focus on the final day. 

I learnt a few things, but frankly I am really disappointed. I enjoyed everything except for the last round at the Masters. I dont normally take things too hard and often take it as another round but the last round hurt me, Jeev said. 

Maybe I will learn something from here. I started off badly and did not get back into shape after that, said Jeev, who totalled a 14-over-par 302 for the tournament. 

I couldnt get my focus back after that bad start. I kept trying hard on every shot but I could not do anything. I had some bad breaks as well but thats golf. 

Hopefully I will be back soon at Augusta. I am not proud of the way I finished. I am happy I made the cut and I would love to come back as I like the course. Its set up perfectly for my game. Well see what happens next year, he said. 

Jeev plays at the Verizon Heritage on the US PGA Tour at Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, next week and will then take some time off for a break. 

I need to take some time off to sort out some things that are bothering me. My scores in the last rounds have been disappointing this year. I need to sort that out before I get out on the golf course. Its more a mental thing, he said. (PTI)

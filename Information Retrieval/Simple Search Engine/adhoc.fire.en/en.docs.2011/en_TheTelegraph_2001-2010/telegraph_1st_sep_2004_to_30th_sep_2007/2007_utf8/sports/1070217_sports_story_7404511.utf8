Bangalore: Defending champion Mara Santangelo of Italy cruised past Japans Yurika Sema 6-1, 6-4 Friday to book her spot in the Bangalore Open semi-finals. 

Unseeded Russian Yaraslova Shvedova knocked out second-seeded Sania Mirza 6-7 (2), 6-4, 6-4 in another quarter final. 

Shvedovas semi-final opponent will be another unseeded player, Tzipora Obziler of Israel, who continued her impressive run by overcoming Hungarys Melinda Czink 6-4, 7-6 (3) to advance to the final four. 

In a late match, unseeded Ukrainian Olga Savchuk upset fourth seeded Jelena Kostanic Tosic of Croatia 6-3, 6-4 in straight sets in the quarter-finals. 

She will face top seed and reigning champion Mara Santangelo of Italy in the semi-finals. 

With Jelenas exit, only the top seed remained in the singles semi-finals. 

Sania clinched the first set tiebreaker after all games went with service, but Shvedova bounced back by putting pressure on Sanias backhand. 

I think Sania was a bit nervous in front of her home crowd and seemed scared to go for shots. That helped my confidence, said Shvedova, who sought to avoid Sanias strong forehand. (AP)

 Ex-captains not to apply for Pakistan coaching job

Karachi: Miffed with the decision of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to advertise for the coachs post, former captains Javed Miandad, Intikhab Alam and Rashid Latif have decided not to apply for the job and have also called on other national greats to boycott the same. 

I dont understand what they are trying to do. This is a technical post and requires a proper selection process. The board should not allow everyone to apply for it. I have served Pakistan cricket for long. I dont think I now need to get into line for this job, Miandad said. 

The PCB has brought out an advertisement inviting applications for the job left vacant by Bob Woolmers death. 

Miandad, who has served as coach for three separate terms, said it seemed as if the board was only interested in hiring a foreign coach. 

Alam was also unhappy with the conditions set and said the board was turning the process into a joke. He called on the PCB to take a cue from its Indian counterpart in dealing with the situation. 

The Indian board has constituted a committee to look into the credentials of prospective candidates. We should have done the same thing. 

I think a persons background, cricketing and coaching experience in practical terms and his man-management skills should be the chief criteria for selecting the national coach, he said. 

Latif, too, said that by advertising for the post on the website, the PCB has shown it is more interested in appointing another foreign coach. Our former players should not really bother to apply for this position, he added. 

The PCB has virtually ruled out a number of former Test greats as contenders for the post as it has asked for candidates with an England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) level three coaching course or an equivalent degree. 

Several Pakistani stars like Hanif Mohammed, Javed Miandad, Zaheer Abbas, Intikhab Alam, Imran Khan, Moin Khan and Latif have never completed a coaching course, leaving only a few like Haroon Rasheed, Jalaluddin, Aaqib Javed, who have the documentary qualifications, in the fray. 

Asked if the PCB would consider dropping the condition for the coaching degree if some former greats wanted to apply, a senior official of the board said, the condition can only be relaxed if the ad-hoc committee decides to do so. 

However, he insisted that the condition has not been kept to rule out local candidates. 

We had no such intention. The fact is a coaching degree is considered very important in modern day cricket and helps in man management and other drills, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Paladin may do the trick 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Saturdays seven-event card is so poor that it looks like it will be a complete waste of a day. In fact, the RCTC could have taken a cue from their southern counterpart, the Hyderabad Race Club (HRC).

 The HRC regularly adds the inter-venue cards to their own to give respectability to the days programme. The two trophy events on the RCTCs card, in fact, should have been scrapped.

 Nevertheless, trainer Shafiq Khans ward, Paladin, is fancied to lift the 1,400m Gable Of Love Cup. The Concordial son is definitely better off at the weights, compared to his stablemate, Vrikodara, who had recently humbled Mr Darcy, the likely favourite in the race. Vinay Jaiswal partners the horse. Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

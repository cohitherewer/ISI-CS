 India face the Korean test

Chennai: Holders India will be looking to keep the winning momentum and brighten their semi-final chances when they take on Asian Games Champions South Korea in a crucial pool B league match of the seventh BSNL Asia Cup mens hockey tournament here on Monday. 

After two back-to-back wins, India would not like to lose to Korea at any cost, as they will meet the minnows in their next two pool matches. 

India have equalled the record for the highest margin of victory in the tournaments history after crushing Sri Lanka 20-0 on Saturday. 

The hosts have to maintain the same aggression to win the title and qualify for the easier group for the Olympic qualifiers next year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav should lead in Cup, reiterates Jadeja

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Ajay Jadeja on Tuesday reiterated that Sourav Ganguly be made the captain of the one-day side. Ive said it before and am repeating again that Sourav should be made the one-day captain ahead of the World Cup. 

In the city for the Ranji Trophy tie against Bengal, Jadeja was all praise for Souravs performance in South Africa. The way he has been batting of late, we may have to end up fielding for three days at the Eden, Jadeja remarked on a lighter note. 

Despite Rajasthans none-too-impressive showing so far, Bengal are not taking them lightly. Its true that Rajasthan have nothing at stake, but you cannot go into a match thinking about such things. 

There is no major difference between teams in the Super League. I think we should just concentrate on our game, Deep Dasgupta said.

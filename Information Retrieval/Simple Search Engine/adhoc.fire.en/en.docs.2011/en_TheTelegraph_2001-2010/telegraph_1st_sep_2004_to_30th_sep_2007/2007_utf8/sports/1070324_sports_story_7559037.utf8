 Win must vs AI: Pereira

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: East Bengal coach Carlos Roberto Pereira is desperately looking for a win against Air India (AI) in their Round X NFL match on Saturday. 

Tomorrows game is vital for us. Im not ruling out my teams chances so early, but we have to win this one. We need to get some confidence back, the Brazilian said on Friday. 

East Bengal, however, will be without Alvito DCunha and M. Suresh due to double bookings. But Pereira believed his other players are competent enough to fill in. 

We should have won against Mahindra (in Mumbai). Then the Sporting Clube de Goa game was a disaster and we were morally down. But the league has a long to way. Im quite confident that things will fall in place for us, Pereira remarked. 

He, however, praised Air Indias Suley Musah. Hes a good player and we need to keep a vigil on him, Pereira added. 

Ghanaian Musah is a former captain of East Bengal.

 McGrath, Hogg run over West Indies

 Teammates congratulate Glenn McGrath after one of his three wickets on Wednesday 

St Johns: Australias varied attack dominated the West Indies batsmen Wednesday to give the defending champions a 103-run win in the opening Super Eight match of the World Cup. 

Glenn McGrath, supported by Nathan Bracken and Shaun Tait, took three wickets as the pacemen frustrated the top order. Spinner Brad Hogg also claimed three victims, including the prize scalp of captain Brian Lara. 

Only Lara offered the home team any hope of avoiding a humiliatingly heavy loss with 77. But the bowlers prevented him from getting the support he needed. He and Ramnaresh Sarwan temporarily halted the fall of wickets putting on a 71-run partnership for the fourth wicket. 

Later, Denesh Ramdin hit 52 from 43 balls before falling to Bracken, and Tait wrapped up the innings in the 46th over. 

Australia had hit 322 for six on Tuesday, led by Matthew Haydens second straight century. 

Persistent rain at the new Sir Vivian Richards stadium then prevented the tournament hosts from replying until Wednesday, when they did so in bright sunshine. 

Lara had won the toss Tuesday and sent Australia in to bat in dull, overcast conditions, hoping for extra movement from the ball. 

However, Australia passed 300 for the fourth time in four matches this tournament. Hayden scored 158, three days after scoring the fastest ever World Cup century off 66 balls against South Africa. 

Powell and Bravo each took two wickets, with Bravo dismissing Hayden in the 47th over. That left Australia on 297 for six before Watson, who finished with 33 off 26 balls, and Hogg put on 25 off the last 17 balls to finish unbeaten. 

Australia added 55 from its last five overs, while the West Indies never even made it that far.

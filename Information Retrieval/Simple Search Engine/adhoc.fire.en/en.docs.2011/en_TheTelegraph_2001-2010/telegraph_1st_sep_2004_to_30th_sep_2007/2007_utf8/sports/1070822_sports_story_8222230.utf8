 Yousuf signing a shock: PCB

Karachi: A day after Mohammed Yousuf joined the rebel Indian Cricket League, a shocked Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said the loss of the senior batsman was a big setback. 

Shafqat Naghmi, chief executive of the PCB, however, played down the signing of the three other players, Inzamam-ul Haq, Abdul Razzaq and Imran Farhat. 

Yousufs signing is the biggest setback for us because he was required by the team, Naghmi said. 

I spoke to Yousuf on Tuesday and he confirmed that he has signed up with the ICL. It came as a shock to us because the team and Pakistan cricket still needs him. He is a quality player and will be missed, he said. 

He said as far as Razzaq was concerned he had not been performing well for the last two years. 

To be honest he has not been in the best of form and it was getting difficult for him to get a place in the team. In that sense if he has signed up with the ICL, he has done what is right for himself. 

He said that Inzamam had contributed a lot to Pakistan cricket and was one of the greats.

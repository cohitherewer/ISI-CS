 United supporters stabbed

Rome: Two Manchester United fans who were stabbed during clashes before a Champions League match with AS Roma remained hospitalised Thursday. 

Rome prefect Achille Serra said the fans were stabbed in either the groin or backside during clashes with Roma supporters. He also said that at least three of the 18 fans reported injured were Italian. 

Serra insisted that police had acted properly and that the clashes inside the stadium lasted no longer than two minutes. 

Meanwhile, three United fans who were arrested by Italian police in a separate clash during Wednesdays quarter final first leg at the Stadio Olimpico will face fast-tracked trials, the British embassy in Italy said. It was not immediately clear what charges the three Britons will face. 

British officials said their government is gathering evidence from embassy staff and witnesses. 

In Rome, the British embassy said that it had supplied a report on the match to the Home Office, and that Manchester police were working in partnership with Italian police. 

Uefa expects to announce later whether it will open any disciplinary hearings. (AP)

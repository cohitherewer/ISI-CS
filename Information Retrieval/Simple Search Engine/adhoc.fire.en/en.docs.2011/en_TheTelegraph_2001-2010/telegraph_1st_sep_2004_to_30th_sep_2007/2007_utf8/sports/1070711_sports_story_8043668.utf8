The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 It will be a sterner test of revival under Moores, says Botham 

 - India pose a bigger threat than the West Indies: Vaughan 

 Ian Botham

London: Ian Botham and Michael Vaughan have warned England of a bigger threat from Team India, asking the players not to bask in the glory of a 3-0 Test win against a depleted West Indies. 

While Botham, who has been recently knighted, feels England face a sterner test of their revival against India, current captain Vaughan admits his team needs to raise the bar against Rahul Dravid amp; Co. 

Englands Test side has rebooted promisingly since the Ashes horror show. But sterner tests of their revival under new coach Peter Moores lie ahead against India, the legendary allrounder said on Tuesday. 

They will pose probably a bigger threat (to us) than the West Indies. We might have to raise our bar just a little bit to ensure we get a good series victory against the Indians, echoed Vaughan. 

Lords hosts the first Test from July 19, while Trent Bridge (July 27-31) and The Oval (August 9-13) are the venues for the subsequent matches. 

Back in the side after a nagging knee injury that kept him out of action for a whole year, Vaughan sent out the warning to his teammates that the upcoming challenge wouldnt be a stroll in the park. 

They bring a batting line-up thats formidable and full of experience.

The bowlers there are a couple of left-armers (Rudra Pratap Singh and Zaheer Khan) and the young Sreesanth, who I think is a real quality seamer, and (Anil) Kumble with all his experience, Vaughan said in an interview with a television channel on Tuesday. 

The Yorkshire batsman also paid attention to Team Indias middle order, which sports an aged look with the trio of Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly being on the wrong side of the 30. 

Youve got no chance of getting me to say Sachin Tendulkar is ageing, Vaughan said. I think they are all quality players and experience is a great thing. 

He praised coach Moores for his job during the series against the West Indies, but demanded more from his wards against the Indians. To live up to the challenge, Botham wanted Englands fast bowlers to be more aggressive. 

Although there were some cheap runs and wickets on offer at times against the West Indies, I have no problem with Englands 3-0 win in the Test series and Moores scores high marks there. 

(But) some of our6 pace bowling will need to be more aggressive and consistent when Indias formidable top order come to the town, Botham was quoted as saying by a daily. 

Botham, however, lashed out at the one-day side, saying they could not have given a worse performance than what they had put up against the West Indies. 

And as for the one-day team... We are still bloody woeful. Englands one-day cricket is another kettle of fish, however. I didnt think it was possible for them to play any worse than they did at the World Cup, but somehow they managed to by losing the NatWest Series against the Windies. 

Lets not mince words: we are going backwards and sliding down towards the bottom of the pile. Right now, Englands level of performance in limited overs cricket is so bad the Eskimos would beat us... Our whole approach is embarrassing, Botham pointed out.

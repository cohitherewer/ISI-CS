The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Nigeria allowed delayed entry

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: This is the mother of all miscommunication. 

On Monday, the organisers had ruled out Nigerias participation in the second Commonwealth Volleyball Championship for men, saying they had failed to turn up. A day later, the organisers did a volte-face, informing newsmen that Nigeria are participating. 

Though tournament rules do not permit Nigerias delayed entry they were scheduled to play their first match on Monday the organisers agreed to take them in as a special case. 

Tournament director Ramana Rao said the Nigerians missed their scheduled flight as they were coming after participating in the African Games. They had to spend 18 hours at the airport and could not communicate this to us. We had to accommodate them as they would have incurred huge losses otherwise, Rao said. Nobody is to blame It was a case of miscommunication, he added. 

Following Nigerias reinstatement, the complexion of group A has changed. India and Australia, by virtue of two wins each, had qualified for semi-finals from a group which had been reduced from five to four teams. Now, they have to play against the Nigerians, and beat them to ensure the African nation doesnt finish among the top two in their group. 

Nigerian opened their campaign with a 0-3 loss to Bangladesh and have to win their remaining three matches. 

Nigeria will take on Australia and India on Wednesday, and Sri Lanka on Thursday.

 Bungled post-mortem fuelled confusion 

 Tim Reid in Kingston 

 Bob Woolmer 

Bob Woolmer was not murdered but died from a heart attack, the head of Jamaicas police will announce next week. Three internationally renowned pathologists have now concluded that the former Pakistan cricket coach was not strangled. 

Lucius Thomas, the head of the Jamaican police force, will also say that Woolmer was not poisoned, it is learnt. Toxicology reports show that there was nothing in Woolmers body that could have killed or incapacitated him. 

Crucial to the conclusion, The Times can disclose, was that the postmortem examination was filmed with high-quality digital colour video that helped outside pathologists to rule out murder. Colour digital photographs were also taken before, during and after the examination, as were multiple tissue and body fluid samples. 

The key piece of evidence that pointed to murder was the contention by Ere Seshaiah, a Jamaican government pathologist, that the hyoid bone in Woolmers neck was broken a classic sign of strangulation. 

Amid previously undisclosed doubts about whether this was the case, Mark Shields, the Deputy Police Commissioner, instructed that the bone should be removed from the body for further examination. 

It has been photographed and X-rayed, helping pathologists to reach their conclusion. Woolmers body was recently cremated. 

The outcome represents a humiliating reversal for the Jamaican police after a sensational public declaration ten weeks ago that the former England allrounder had been throttled after Pakistans exit from the cricket World Cup. It will also fuel criticism of Shields, the former Scotland Yard detective who became the public face of the investigation. But he is likely to argue that without the modernising techniques and forensic science expertise that he brought to the Jamaican force, the case would have remained a murky and unresolved murder. 

Gillian Woolmer, the coachs widow, and their sons, Russell and Dale, were informed at their South African home last month that Woolmer, a diabetic who slept with an oxygen mask, died of a heart attack, probably brought on by high stress and an enlarged heart. 

The last of the three concurring pathologists reports was received on Tuesday from a strangulation expert in South Africa. With the two other independent reports, it provides overwhelming consensus that the original postmortem examination was bungled. That had prompted the announcement that Mr Woolmer had been asphyxiated due to manual strangulation. 

A week after the murder investigation began, Mr Shields brought in a Metropolitan Police team led by Detective Superintendent John Sweeney. They returned to London with video footage and photographs of Dr Seshaiahs postmortem examination and gave it to Nat Carey, a Home Office pathologist. He said that Mr Woolmer died of natural causes.

 Vaughan wanted help from Boycott, under the radar 

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH 

Geoffrey Boycott on Friday has revealed that the England captain sought him out for extra batting practice but was afraid coach Duncan Fletcher would find out. 

Boycott hits out at the fear culture that Fletcher built up as England coach. Fletcher on Thursday broke down in tears as he announced he was resigning as coach after Englands final World Cup match against the West Indies in Barbados. 

In an audio interview to Simon Hughes, Boycott also criticises Fletcher for surrounding himself with yes men, of failing to control Andrew Flintoff and Steve Harmison, and that the captain as well as selectors were afraid of him. 

Boycott said: This winter I had a captain of England requesting to have dinner with me to get my help on his batting but he said he must not be seen with me. He said it must be, I quote, Under the radar. 

Because I have been critical of the coach, an England captain is now frightened to have dinner with me. What a farcical situation is that? That cannot be good for the team. 

Boycott says Fletcher also failed to admit his mistakes: What did he do when England went out of the World Cup? He went and played golf with the captain. Surely he had to front up. It is almost as if he is saying go to hell the English public, I will write a book one day and make a load of money. 

The other thing is man management. Andrew Flintoffs drinking off the field should have been sorted out long ago. Also we have Steve Harmison who has all the equipment to be the best in the world but we have allowed him to bowl sloppily get disenchanted.

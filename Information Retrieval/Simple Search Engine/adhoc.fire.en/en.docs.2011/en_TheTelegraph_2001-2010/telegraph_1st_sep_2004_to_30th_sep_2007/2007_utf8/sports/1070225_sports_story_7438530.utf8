 Tiviakov top draw among 54 titled players

 - Well insist on random searching, scanning of players for any electronic device, says Surya Sekhar

Calcutta: The 21 Grandmaster-strong Calcutta Open gets underway at the Gorky Sadan on Sunday. 

The 10 round Swiss tournament, organised by the Alekhine Chess Club features 54 international titled players a record for any Open meet in India. 

The biggest name is top seed Sergei Tiviakov, the Russia-born Dutchman. Armed with a rating of 2681, he will start as the favourite. 

Chess connoisseurs in Calcutta may remember him from his Goodricke Open title-winning visits in 1993 and 1994. 

The Indian GMs who will seek to make life difficult for Tiviakov are Surya Sekhar Ganguly, Abhijit Kunte, Tejas Bakre, Dibyendu Barua, R.B. Ramesh and Deepan Chakravarthy. 

Despite the presence of so many highly rated players, a lot of focus will be on an Indian Diwakar Prasad Singh though for the wrong reasons. 

Singh, the highest rated Indian IM with a rating of 2523, has been under the scanner for some time as the countrys top players suspect that he has been receiving external help during tournaments. 

Singhs moves matched those of chess engine Deep Junior with uncanny accuracy over a period of time last year when he gained 260 Elo points and made it into the Olympiad team. 

The AICF has formed a committee under the chairmanship of R.M. Dongre to investigate the matter. 

It may be recalled that another Indian player, Umakant Sharma, was recently banned by the AICF for 10 years after he was caught with a hidden blue-tooth device under his cap during a rating tournament in Delhi. The AICF introduced frisking of the players with metal detectors during the National A Championship in Valsad in December. 

National champion Surya, who arrived in the city on Saturday after playing in the Aeroflot Open, told The Telegraph: All top Indian players will insist on random searching and scanning of the players for any electronic device before the games. 

Surya said though he had a jet lag after playing a strong tournament, he was confident of doing well at home.

 Team India end 21-year wait 

 - Pietersen (101) in verbal duel with Kumble 

 England draw final Test 

 Anil Kumble celebrates the dismissal of Alastair Cook on Monday with Dinesh Karthik, Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid 

London: India ended 21 years of agonising wait for their first Test series win in England but the rare feat lost some of its gloss with the beleaguered hosts salvaging a draw in the final encounter of the three-match series on Monday. 

Chasing 500 for an improbable win, England could not rewrite history but at least showed enough guts and gumption to bat out the entire final day and deny India a 2-0 win in the series. 

The hosts, in their second innings, were 369 for 6 at stumps with Matt Prior (12 ..) and Ryan Sidebottom (3 ..) in the middle, leaving India four wickets away from a win. Kevin Pietersen topscored for the hosts with 101, while Ian Bell (62) played a gutsy knock down the order. 

The series defeat, however, snapped Englands glorious six-year unbeaten streak in home series. 

Indias 1-0 win, secured through the seven-wicket victory in the second Test at Trent Bridge, made them the first touring side to take a series in England since Australia in the 2001 Ashes. 

It was also Indias fourth Test series win on tour against major opposition in 21 years. They also won in Sri Lanka in 1993, Pakistan 2004 and the West Indies in 2006. 

England were left to rue the drawn first Test, when they dominated before bad light and rain denied them the chance to take the final wicket needed for victory. 

Undoubtedly, Pietersens century, crafted in just over three and a half hours, was the highlight of the final day. During his innings he had a heated verbal exchange with the normally mild-mannered Anil Kumble after the bowler collided with non-striker Pietersen trying to field off his own bowling. The umpire intervened and Dravid calmed his agitated bowler. 

The Indian fielders too contributed to the home teams cause with Dravid dropping Vaughan early on off Kumble and Mahendra Singh Dhoni letting off Collingwood on 13 off a delivery from Tendulkar.

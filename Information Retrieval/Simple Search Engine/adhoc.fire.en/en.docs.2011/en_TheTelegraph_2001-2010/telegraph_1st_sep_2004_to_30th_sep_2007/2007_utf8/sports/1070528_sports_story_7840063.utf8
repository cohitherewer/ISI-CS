 Jeev tied 12th

Wentworth: Jeev Milkha Singh shot a superb five-under 67 in the third round to keep his hopes alive for a top-ten finish at the BMW PGA Championship of Europe. 

Jeev moved up to tied 12th spot from 60th on the third day of the event on Saturday. The 2006 Asia No. 1, who was in danger of missing the cut after a first round five-over 77, made the right moves in second and third rounds. 

The field is led by Paul Broadhurst (68) and Ross Fisher (69), both at 10-under. 

Jyoti Randhawa (76) slid to tied 53rd and Shiv Kapur (81) dropped to 53rd. While Randhawa was seventh after the first round and 27th after the second, Kapur was fifth and seventh after the first and second rounds respectively. 

Jeev had six birdies and one bogey in a superb third round. Aided by focused putting, he found 13 of the 14 fairways and 11 greens in regulation and needed just 24 putts for the round. 

He made par both times he went into the bunker and scrambled to par or better on the seven occasions he missed the greens in regulation. (PTI)

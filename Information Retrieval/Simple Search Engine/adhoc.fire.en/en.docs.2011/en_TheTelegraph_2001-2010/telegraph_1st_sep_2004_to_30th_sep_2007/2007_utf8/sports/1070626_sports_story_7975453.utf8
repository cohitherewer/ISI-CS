 BCCI warns umpires

Mumbai: After cautioning its players, officials and associations, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has now turned its attention towards the umpires by warning them not to get associated with unapproved tournaments. 

According to sources, the BCCI has dashed off a letter to all the umpires asking them not to get linked with any unapproved tournaments. The letter, however, does not refer to the Essel Groups pet project of the Indian Cricket League (ICL). 

Three former India players, Kiran More, Sandeep Patil including the countrys lone World Cup-winning skipper Kapil Dev have already joined the ICL in various capacities. 

Kapil heads the ICLs executive board in which More is a member while Patil has been roped in to coach one of the six teams the league proposes to field. 

Meanwhile, a former player-turned-coach, who did not want to be identified, has received an offer to take charge of the ICLs proposed academy.

 Akhtars target is India tour 

Karachi: Controversial Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has said he was dropped from Pakistans World Cup squad due to injury and not because he had flunked a private dope test in London. 

I was dropped from the team because of my injury. We underwent no private dope tests, Shoaib insisted. 

Shoaib, who is training under Mudassar Nazar, the chief coach at the National Cricket Academy in Lahore, said that he had given himself four months to recover from a knee injury. 

I have given myself four months to get back into action probably in the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa, Shoaib said. 

After the disappointment of not being there with the team in the World Cup, my main target now is to be fit for our tour of India in November this year. I missed the last tour there in 2005 because of fitness problems. I want to play in India and deliver something, he said.

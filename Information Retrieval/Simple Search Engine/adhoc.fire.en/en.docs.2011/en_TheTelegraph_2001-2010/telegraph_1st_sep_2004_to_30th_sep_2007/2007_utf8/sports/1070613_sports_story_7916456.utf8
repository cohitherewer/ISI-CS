 Drogba likely to quit Chelsea

London: Chelseas Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba admitted on Tuesday that he was tempted by a move to either Spain or Italy. 

Spain and Italy attract me a lot and, although I am a long way from saying farewell to Chelsea, you ever know what can happen, Drogba told a British newspaper. 

Im at the last big turning point of my career. 

Its time for one final big choice should I stay or should I go? I am tempted to discover another world and to see what footballing life is like outside England. 

It would be a big disappointment if I never manage to play for teams that I dream of playing for. That would be terribly frustrating. 

The Ivory Coast start striker has concerns over the clubs ambition following rows between owner Roman Abramovich and boss Jose Mourinho. 

Drogba, whos very close to Mourinho, added: If I think the club lacks ambition, then it is sure I will not stay too long. Im 29 and I dont have much time to lose. 

I believed in being loyal to a stable club. But it is clear that, in such matters, players dont control anything. 

Drogba extended his contract with the Premiership runners-up last November until 2010.

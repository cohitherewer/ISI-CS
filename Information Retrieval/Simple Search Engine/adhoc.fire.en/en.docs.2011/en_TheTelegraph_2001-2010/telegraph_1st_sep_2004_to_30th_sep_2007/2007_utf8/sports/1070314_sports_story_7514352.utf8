The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Will India respond like WI?

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Towards the end of the 1990s, Ricky Ponting was close to earning a dubious label: Australian crickets enfant terrible. 

For the Tasmanian, breaking with tradition appeared to come easy. 

After a settled period (in which he soared as a batsman), so to say, Ponting is back to departing from accepted practice. 

He did just the other day, making an adverse comment about Team India. 

Among other things, the Australian captain said we are also not forgetting their negatives as bad travellers. 

Rahul Dravid will be the first to accept that Indias away-record needs to improve. No matter how patriotic, nobody is going to disagree. 

The issue, of course, is whether Ponting needs to lecture on an Indian weakness. That he should look at his own teams recent record isnt the point its about tradition. 

Be it a Brian Lara or Graeme Smith, captains refrain from (publicly) commenting negatively about the opposition. 

Usually, its Id rather talk about my side or its not for me to speak about some other teams problems. 

Ponting has chosen to be different, but surely wont attract cheers. 

Its to be seen whether Dravid and Co. respond with a mighty on-field performance on March 31, when India and Australia should meet in a Super Eight fixture in Antigua. 

[Incidentally, a former Indian captain declined to react. After the Sunil Gavaskar-Ponting war, its best that Dravid alone responds if he wants to, that is, the gentleman told The Telegraph.] 

Laras men, it may be recalled, taught Greg Chappell a lesson for his ill-advised the West Indies have forgotten to win observation after the first ODI (Kingston) in last summers bilateral series. 

They won the next four, forcing the Team India coach to swallow his words. 

Then, back in 1976, Clive Lloyds team made England captain Tony Greig pay for his utterly insensitive well make the West Indies grovel comment before the start of a five-Test series. 

They won 3-0.

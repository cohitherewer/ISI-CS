The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Settling down wont be much of a problem, says Sourav

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly did not field when Rajasthan batted a second time in their Ranji Trophy Super League tie on Friday. After being dismissed for 122 in the morning, the former India captain spent time mostly indoors even as the handsome turnout waited eagerly for a glimpse of their Dada. 

As he engaged himself in an impromptu adda with Sambaran Banerjee a little before tea the only time he stepped out in the afternoon sending the crowd into a tizzy he heard about his one-day comeback from a CAB staff. There was no show of emotion or exhilaration, only a quiet sense of contentment. 

I was expecting this to happen, he said. I dont think I ever had a point to prove to anybody. 

How would he view his comeback? One-day cricket is different. One has to get used to both formats in modern cricket. Ive been out for more than 14 months. I will have to settle down. But with my experience, I dont think that will be much of a problem, he remarked. 

He felt comfortable batting at any position. I am ready to bat at any position. I am comfortable batting anywhere the team needs me to Even opening the innings with Robin Uthappa will not be a problem. 

How tough a challenge will West Indies provide? Most of the West Indies players are in form. They are a good one-day team and have been winning matches. Then there is Brian Lara. As Ive said earlier, he was the best captain during the Champions Trophy. 

It will be a close series. The key will be batting. Weve got to put up enough runs on the board, Sourav explained. 

India have fared poorly in the last few one-day series and tournaments, but Sourav preferred to look ahead. Everyday is a new day I dont think the past counts much. Its important we win these eight games. We must go into the World Cup confident about winning matches. 

He, however, preferred to concentrate only on the forthcoming matches. The World Cup is still a couple of months away. Lets finish this series first. Then theres another four matches against Sri Lanka. We should take one series at a time. 

Will he be ready to take the captaincy if the need arises? At present Dravid is the captain, Sachin the vice-captain Let us stick to that. I have offered suggestions whenever it was needed in South Africa and it will always be the same. 

Post South Africa, is this comeback turning out to be his best? Just two months have passed by Lets wait for a year.

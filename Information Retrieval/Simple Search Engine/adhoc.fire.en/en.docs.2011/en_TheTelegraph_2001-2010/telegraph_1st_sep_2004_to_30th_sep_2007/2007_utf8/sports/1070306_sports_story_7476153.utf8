The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Doha: Belgiums Justine Henin defeated Russias Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-4, 6-2 to win the Qatar Open and complete a Gulf double on Saturday. Henin, who had beaten Kuznetsova in the semi-final before she won the title in Dubai last week, continued her mastery over the Russian, extending her head-to-head lead to 14-1. Henin took home $222,000 while Kuznetsova pocketed $117,000. 

 Despite her win, Henin will remain No.2 in the WTA rankings, but she has closed in on Russian Maria Sharapova. Henin was broken in the sixth game by Kuznetsova but broke back immediately and then again two games later before taking the set after saving three break points on her own serve. An immediate break gave the Belgian a quick advantage in the second set and she never relinquished her grip.

 Melbourne: Australian distance champion Grant Hackett said a late change of training base has affected his chances at the world championships starting in Melbourne later this month. The 26-year-old, the most decorated swimmer in world championship history, swapped his Gold Coast training camp for Melbourne and ended a 21-year relationship with coach Dennis Cotterell in favour of new mentor Ian Pope last month.

 But Hackett, a double Olympic 1500m freestyle champion, said the switch may adversely affect his efforts during the March 17-April 1 FINA championships.

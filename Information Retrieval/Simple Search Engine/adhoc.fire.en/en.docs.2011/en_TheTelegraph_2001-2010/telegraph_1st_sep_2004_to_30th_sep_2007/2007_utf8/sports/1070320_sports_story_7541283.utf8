 West Indies 76/2 after 20 overs

Kingston: Left-hander Sean Williams hit a career-best, unbeaten 70 here Monday to lift Zimbabwe to 202 for five off 50 overs in their Group D Cricket World Cup match against the West Indies at Sabina Park. 

West Indies were 76 for two after 20 overs, with Marlon Samuels on 2 and Ramnaresh Sarwan yet to open his account. Chris Gayle fell to Christopher Mpofu for 40 while Elton Chigumbura dismissed Shivnarine Chanderpaul for 21. 

The left-hander lashed seven fours off 88 balls as Zimbabwe recovered from losing their first two wickets in 2.2 overs. 

Williams shared restorative stands of 83 with Brendon Taylor (50) and 60 unbroken with Elton Chigumbura (30 not out). 

Jerome Taylor took two for 42 while there was a wicket apiece for Daren Powell and Dwayne Smith. Taylor rattled Zimbabwe in the second over as 18-year-old Friday Kasteni, in only his second one-day International, was bowled first ball. 

Zimbabwe, with all 11 players under the age of 24, slumped to two for two in the next over. Vusi Sibanda, who took a half century off Ireland in the opening match, was bowled for one as he played no stroke an in-dipper. 

Wicketkeeper-batsman Taylor and Chamu Chibhabha settled the early wobble in a third-wicket stand of 29 before Jerome Taylor struck again at 31 for three.

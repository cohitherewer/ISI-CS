 Ive always played the way I think is right

 - Sachin dedicates MoM, MoS awards to family

Vadodara: On a day the Tatas made a huge statement globally, Team India took steps towards being recognised as contenders with steel for crickets showpiece event, the World Cup, which begins in six weeks. 

That, of course, is the big picture. 

On a smaller scale, Wednesday probably saw the last Sachin Tendulkar-Brian Lara showdown in India and its the former who emerged a runaway winner. 

Besides the MoM award for his unbeaten 100 off a mere 76 deliveries (10x4, 1x6), Sachin took the MoS presentation for totalling 191 and three wickets in the four-match Pepsi Cup. 

It was, as Sir Viv Richards would put it, a terrific day in office. 

The last ODI was an absolute disaster for the West Indies, though. Were unpredictable... We either win easily or lose easily, had been captain Laras admission on match-eve. 

At the IPCL Cricket Stadium, his team added another chapter to the we lose easily saga. The scars of the 1-4 thrashing in the West Indies eight months ago wont disappear but, for now, the Rahul Dravids can toast a confidence-lifting 160-run win. 

Its significant that conditions in the West Indies, hosts of the World Cup, arent going to be much different. 

[According to Board secretary Niranjan Shah, the squad will be picked in Mumbai on February 12.] 

Sachin, who reached his 41st ODI century on the last ball of the innings, did have let-offs (85 and 91), but his breathtaking innings came as a sledgehammer blow for the Doubting Thomases. 

Id been getting decent scores, but wasnt able to convert into big ones... To win the series, somebody had to put his hand up... Ive always played the way I think is right... Ive been playing long enough to know whats right and whats wrong, he asserted while receiving the awards. 

The last comment drew shouts of hear, hear from bubbly teammates. Later, briefly interacting with The Telegraph, Sachin revealed the awards were dedicated to his family. 

Having taken the series 3-1, Dravid could afford to look different and actually smile. The first point he made, at a Q amp;A session with the Media, was that neither he nor the team had been worried about Sachins form. 

He quipped: Maybe now everyone else can stop worrying about him... We could have some peace around... But, then, there wont be anything to discuss! Maybe we could find something... Sachin showed why hes such a great player... Today, he played one of his best innings... Certainly about the best Ive seen... 

Sachin was the cynosure, but there were very useful contributions from everyone else too: Openers Sourav Ganguly (68) and Robin Uthappa (28 off 17 deliveries), Dravid (78) and Mahendra Singh Dhoni who exploded in, well, trademark fashion 40 not out in 20 balls (1x4, 3x6). 

It was a turbo-charged display and while he didnt admit it, Lara must have cursed himself for not batting first on what looked a belter even before Sourav and Uthappa got into the act. 

Weve got to put this (defeat) behind us... We were competitive in the first two matches and won the third... We knew it would be difficult to beat India at home... Today, we didnt bowl in the right areas... We started poorly and got outplayed, Lara remarked. 

Delighted with such a powerful performance in a must-win situation, Dravid said: Its a good way to end a series... We were under a bit of pressure and there are going to be more must-win matches, in the World Cup... The guys were splendid... The way we won is a tribute to them... 

He didnt offer anything definite on Irfan Pathan, who made a comeback on home turf, but praised Yuvraj Singh for a truly outstanding catch (off Pathan) which dismissed Dwayne Smith. He also had positive words about the left-handers bowling. 

Dravid, whod gone off with cramps early in the West Indies innings, maintained hed recovered and there was no reason to worry. 

The next (last before the World Cup) series, against Sri Lanka, begins in Calcutta on February 8. Barring Sourav and the Mumbai players, the rest have a few days off. Coach Greg Chappell, for one, intends spending some days in Goa. 

The next vacation, even if its short, wont come in a hurry.

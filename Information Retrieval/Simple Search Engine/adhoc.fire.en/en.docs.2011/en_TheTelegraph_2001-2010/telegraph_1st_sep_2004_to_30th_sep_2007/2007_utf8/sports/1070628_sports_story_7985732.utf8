 Sasi draws 

vs Svidler

Yalta: GM Krishnan Sasikiran squandered a winning position allowing top seed Peter Svidler to escape with a draw in the eighth round of the Aerosvit International Grandmasters meet. 

Sasikiran played the Breyer defence against the Spanish opening. His superb handling of the opening and early middle game saw him grabbing the initiative. 

However, he got into time trouble and made some slips, missing an excellent opportunity on the 35th move. Soon it was Svidler, who held the advantage and the Indian appeared in danger of losing. He fought back resolutely and managed to save a half-point with stubborn and accurate defence in the queen endgame.

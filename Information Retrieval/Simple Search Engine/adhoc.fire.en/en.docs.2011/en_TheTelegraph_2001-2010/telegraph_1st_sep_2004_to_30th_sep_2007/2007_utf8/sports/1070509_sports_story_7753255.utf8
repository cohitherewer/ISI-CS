 Imran Farhat under fire

Karachi: Imran Farhat could face strict disciplinary action after the national selectors reported him to the PCB for misbehaving with them following his omission from the ODI series against Sri Lanka. 

We have filed a written complaint with the board chairman. Farhat called us up and used unparliamentary language wanting to know why we had dropped him, chief selector Salahuddin Ahmed said. 

Miffed at the omission, even Farhats father-in-law Mohammed Illyas, a former Test player barged into the selectors room and allegedly misbehaved with them. 

Farhat, however, claimed that the selectors were exaggerating the matter and denied using foul language with them. 

Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan Cricket Board accepted a request from their Pakistani counterpart to allow the Abu Dhabi Cricket Club two more days to deposit their appearance fees of $750,000 for playing the three-match one-day series against Pakistan from May 18-22. (PTI)

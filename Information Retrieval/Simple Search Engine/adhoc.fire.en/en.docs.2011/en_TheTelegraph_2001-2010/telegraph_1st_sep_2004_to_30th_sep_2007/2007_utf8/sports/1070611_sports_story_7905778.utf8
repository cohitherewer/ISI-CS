 Ghei ends tied 22nd

Koh Samui (Thailand): Gaurav Ghei played a steady round to end tied 22nd even as S.S.P. Chowrasia and Gurbaaz Mann, who seemed headed for a top-10 finish, faltered in the final round of the Bangkok Airways Open. 

Korean stalwart Lee Sung completed a dominant wire-to-wire success for his maiden triumph on the Asian Tour. 

Lee, who fired a course record of 62 in the third round, remained steady with an even-par 71 in his final stretch at the Santiburi Samui Country Club. 

With a winning total of 16-under-par 268, he finished three strokes ahead of local star Prayad Marksaeng, who carded a 66 to finish in lone second place. 

As Ghei carded an even-par 71 for a total of 284, Maan slipped from overnight 15th to 22nd with a round of 73. 

Slipping even more was Chowrasia, whose seven-over 78 saw him end up tied 40th after being tied 15th after three rounds. 

Among other Indians, Rahil Gangjee (73) and Digvijay Singh (72) finished four-over par 288 and tied for 35th, while Arjun Singh carded a 73 and ended with a total of seven-over 291 and in tied 46th place. 

Lee dedicated the win to his family, especially his brother and caddie Lee Sung-joo as he walked away with the top prize of $47,550.

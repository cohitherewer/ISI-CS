 All depends on form: Fleming

Bridgetown: Stephen Fleming is not putting too much emphasis on New Zealands recent wins over Australia, saying form going forward is all that counts at the World Cup. 

Flemings New Zealand line-up faces Bangladesh in a warm-up match on Tuesday, where teams are allowed to rotate 13 players to help acclimatise to Caribbean conditions. 

Its our first taste of a West Indies pitch, he said. If thats going to give us an indication of what the others are going to be like, then weve got to assess it well and make sure ... we start getting combinations that best fit. 

The New Zealanders are high on confidence after defeating Australia in a three-match series at home last month.It was good, Fleming said. But the World Cup is not necessarily about form going in, its about form during it. (AP)

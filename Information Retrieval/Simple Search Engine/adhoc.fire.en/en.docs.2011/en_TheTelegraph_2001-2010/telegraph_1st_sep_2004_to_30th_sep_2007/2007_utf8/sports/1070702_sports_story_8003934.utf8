 Becker slams system

London: Triple Wimbledon champion Boris Becker has hit out at the wildcard system used to give British players a chance of Grand Slam action. 

Becker, who now works as a television commentator, says that it is pointless giving players in their 20s wildcards because if they need one by that age, they will never make it as a top level player. 

What strikes me is there are no good British teenagers appearing, he said. The wild cards are given to people in their early 20s. If you are not in the top 150 by the time you are 23 or 24 you should look for another job. (AFP)

Colombo: Sanath Jayasuriya became the first player to achieve the one-day double of 10,000 runs and 300 wickets as Sri Lanka thrashed Bangladesh by five wickets here on Monday. 

The 38-year-old veteran put in an impressive all round performance, taking 4 for 31 before making 24 to help the hosts take an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. 

Jayasuriya, who has 12,108 runs from 397 one-dayers, took his 300th wicket dismissing last man Syed Rasel as Bangladesh were bowled out for 137 in 46.5 overs. Sri Lanka overhauled the target with 19 overs to spare and Jayasuriya was named man of the match. 

The World Cup runners-up hardly broke sweat in their chase despite losing Jayasuriya and Kumar Sangakkara in the space of three overs. 

Jayasuriyas knock was cut short when he played a short one off left-arm spinner Abdur Razzaq straight into the hands of Aftab Ahmed at backward point. Sagakkara was adjudged caught behind, a decision, which left him clearly unhappy. 

Mahela Jaywardene was caught by Ahmed at midwicket after the Sri Lankan skipper mistimed a pull off Syed Rasel, the most impressive Bangladesh bowler, with figures of 2-39 from 10 overs. 

Tillakaratne Dilshan and Chamara Silva put on 57 runs for the fifth wicket to ensure their teams emphatic win. 

Earlier, Sri Lanka rode on fine bowling performances by Lasith Malinga and Jayasuriya after electing to field. 

While Malinga (3-22) inflicted the early damage, Jayasuriya (4-31) polished off the Bangladesh tail.

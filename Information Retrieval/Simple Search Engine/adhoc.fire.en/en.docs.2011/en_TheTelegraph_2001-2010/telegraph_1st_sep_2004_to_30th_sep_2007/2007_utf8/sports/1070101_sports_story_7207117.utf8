The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 NZ clinch thriller

 Queensland: Tailender Michael Mason hit the last ball of the match for four to give New Zealand a thrilling one-wicket win over Sri Lanka in their second one-day International in Queenstown on Sunday. 

Mason drove Sri Lankan spinner Sanath Jayasuriya over his head for a boundary to help New Zealand finish with 228 for nine in reply to Sri Lankas 224 for seven as the home side squared the five-match series. 

New Zealand needed just one run off the final over but with James Franklin unbeaten on 45 at the non-strikers end, Mason was left with the responsibility. 

The No. 11 batsmen failed to score off the first five balls from Jayasuriya, including a gifted waist-high full toss outside off-stump, before dancing down the pitch and chancing his arm off the last delivery. 

New Zealand always looked to have the match in control until a late stutter with the bat. 

They restricted the visitors to 224 for seven despite a fine 89 off 122 balls from Kumar Sangakkara, 31 from Chamara Silva and 29 from Farveez Mahroof.

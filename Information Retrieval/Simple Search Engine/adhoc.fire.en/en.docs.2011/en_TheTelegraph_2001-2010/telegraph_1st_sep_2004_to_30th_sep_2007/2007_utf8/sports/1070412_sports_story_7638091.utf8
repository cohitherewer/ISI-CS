 My game is over in ODIs, says Lara

St Georges: Brian Lara, one of the most fascinating, prolific and enigmatic cricketers of all time, confirmed on Tuesday that he will be ending his illustrious ODI career once the World Cup is over. 

Lara, in his third and most impressive stint as the West Indies captain, wanted to go on a high but the 67-run defeat to South Africa all but put paid to the hosts semi-final hopes. 

I think this is the end of my one-day career, for sure, Lara told the ICC. I honestly feel my game is over and we should give it to one of the younger players. Its really tough playing one-day Internationals out there. 

After the World Cup, the next one-day tournament for the West Indies is in June in England and Id love to sit back and watch the team do well, he said. 

Lara will be leading the West Indies against Bangladesh (April 19) and England (April 21) in their remaining Super Eight matches in Bridgetown. And though only a series of freak results could propel the hosts to the last four, Lara said the matches did matter a lot for the side. 

These might be my last two one-day Internationals but I still want to see the team moving out of this competition having learnt something from it, he said. 

The dejected captain put his hands up on behalf of the team at the post-match media conference, saying that they had played bad cricket, failed to handle the pressure and dont deserve to be in the semi-finals. 

We did not act well at all. It is hard to sit here and pinpoint exactly where we went wrong, other than the fact that if you look at the stats, we were beaten badly by better teams, Lara said. 

 We are very disappointed and sad that we have let down the people of the Caribbean and people who support us around the world. 

We feel it a lot and know that the man in the street is definitely disappointed. When we go to training, we see people waving and understand what cricket means to them we would not go out, not wanting to perform. 

It just happens that we have played bad cricket and dont deserve to be in the semi-finals... sorry to our people about that and lets hope we can pick ourselves up, said Lara. 

They (South Africa) were also in a do-or-die situation they came up trumps, showed their class and why they were number one until a few days ago. They were outstanding, and we were outplayed, he remarked. 

Lara said he was sad that he was unable to quit ODIs in better style. 

It is definitely a huge disappointment. It is a situation where you are playing your last few one-day Internationals and hoping to play in a World Cup semi-final or final I am hugely disappointed. 

Ive had a very fruitful career, Ive enjoyed playing for the West Indies in the one-day arena and I will continue to enjoy for the next couple of games. 

But what is more important is the state of the younger players who have to carry forward the team, he said. 

Asked whether the sides poor showing had led him to consider his future as Test captain, Lara said: Im going to be in the World Cup for the next two games and am not going to talk about that part of it. May be the best time to talk about it is the end of the World Cup.

 That Brian Lara would not continue with ODIs after the World Cup was reported by The Telegraph on February 1st this year

 Extraordinary nets session for Hayden

 Matthew Hayden 

Gros Islet: Matthew Hayden decided he needed some more batting practice on Monday and had everyone running for cover. 

For an hour after his teammates had finished their work, the burly Queenslander was fed deliveries in the tiny nets at the Beausejour Stadium, where Australia play South Africa in the World Cup semi-final on Wednesday. 

The nets couldnt contain Haydens mighty blows and balls flew, once every 30 seconds, out of the nets, over grandstands and onto the outfield, where groundstaff were preparing the wicket and dozens of others were in danger of becoming victims of Haydens big hitting. 

Its continual persistence and the pure joy of playing for your country. Ive got runs and been consistent, Hayden said after the extraordinary nets session. 

Hayden is streets ahead in the Cup batting statistics. In eight innings, he has scored 580 runs at 82.85 an innings with three centuries. He also topped the Super Eight batting figures, with 390 runs from five innings. 

At age 35, Hayden is one of the fittest and strongest cricketers. He regularly trains longer and harder than anyone else in his side and spends long hours in the gym. 

He said a recent talk from British Olympic rower Steve Redgrave in which the five-time gold-medallist discussed how to stay top of ones game despite advancing years was a revelation. 

Scheduled to speak to the press after the Australian session on Monday, Hayden chose to make his point with the bat rather than words. He kept journalists waiting for an hour yards from his nets session. Photographers were scattered and support staff were stationed around the ground as the bowling machine ran out of ammunition for the left hander. 

Its hard to believe that a year ago, Haydens ODI career was over. He was recalled in October, however, and has been among runs ever since with his bludgeoning style. Hayden says he sometimes sees fear in bowlers eyes. 

My role is to make sure we get off to a good start, its as simple as that, he said. 

Hayden said he had given no thought to winning the best player of the tournament award. 

Frankly I couldnt care less about player of the tournament, he said. Its just great to be part of a side thats playing so confidently. 

Hayden, the designated gourmet chef of the Australian side for his barbecuing ability, said there was plenty of good-hearted rivalry in the same luxury St Lucia hotel where the teams are staying. 

He said he had plenty of respect for South Africa and had learned a lot in the mid-1990s when he toured the country as a young Test player. 

Ive enjoyed the competition against them probably more than against anybody else, he said.

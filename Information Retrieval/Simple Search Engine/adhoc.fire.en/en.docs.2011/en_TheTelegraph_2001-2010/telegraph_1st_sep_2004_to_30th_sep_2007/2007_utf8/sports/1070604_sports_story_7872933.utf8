 Penney turns down Moores offer

THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

Englands new coach Peter Moores suffered the first setback to his recruitment drive when Trevor Penney turned down his offer to become Englands first full-time fielding coach. 

Moores had recruited Andy Flower to be his batting coach and No 2, and Allan Donald to be his bowling consultant. 

Penney, 38, a former Warwickshire batsman and, like Flower, a native of Zimbabwe, would have made up a trio of southern African coaches for the England team. 

Penney is understood to have turned down the England offer because he did not want to become branded as a specialist fielding coach.

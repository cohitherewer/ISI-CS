 Dav: A degree of friction inevitable in any position

 - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 

 World Cup-winning coach opens up 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Dhaka: Dav Whatmores moustache has certainly turned more grey and he has stopped smoking. Barring that, theres no noticeable change. Yet, the 53-year-old Australian has changed the face of Bangladesh cricket and wont be forgotten in this part of the world when his innings comes to an end later this month. The other evening, Whatmore (a World Cup-winning coach) spoke to The Telegraph for around 45 minutes. 

The following are excerpts: 

On being weeks away from closing shop in Bangladesh 

(Grins) Its an unusual period... Its a new thing for me, for never before have I projected a departure date... Everybody knows it, yet Im in-charge for an important ODI and Test series... However, I never attempt any job unless I can do it to the best of my ability and my priority is to leave on as good a showing as possible. Im leaving on good terms with my employer (Bangladesh Cricket Board) and my players. Indeed, Im leaving with doors open and with happy memories. 

On the lessons learnt by coaching international sides Sri Lanka (twice) and Bangladesh 

That its important to quickly understand what makes for success... To quickly get the combination which works best and quickly grasp whether there are players to fit into the best combination... There have been instances when Ive wanted Bangladesh to play in a particular manner, but we didnt have the personnel... In a nutshell, what Ive learnt most is identifying whats going to work best at any one point in time. 

On improving the technical skills 

Its definitely part of the job... One needs to be a good communicator, otherwise how will any message get across? Communicating is as important as spotting a weakness. The communication gets better when the coach understands the players and they understand him... Its a two-way flow and this education never comes to an end. 

On the extent of actual coaching at the highest level 

Not a lot, really... Whats important is to make each player understand his role. People feel a lot warmer when theyre aware of the requirements and when they have the confidence of the captain and coach. Individual work and feedback helps. 

On having worked with very strong individuals in Sri Lanka, the Arjuna Ranatungas 

There were differences between Arjuna and me, but its the captain who is the boss on the field... Arjuna was a tough customer, but he wasnt that much of an authoritarian in the dressing room... A fair portion of him was democratic and he was open to suggestions... 

On whether, given the profile of the players, it was much easier settling down in Bangladesh 

It helped... But, then, the team was at rock bottom when I took charge... Because of the situation, I had more power than in Sri Lanka... Having said that, Ive never been one to abuse authority... If anything, Ive always trod carefully to eliminate the possibility of mistakes in judgement. (After a pause) Actually, in some ways, the spotlight has been more on me in the past four years... Ive been expected to perform. 

On whether, having expressed his keenness for the India job, hes apprehensive about the star-culture which prevails 

A degree of friction is inevitable in any position... Its natural that there will be areas of conflict... If that doesnt happen, then were looking at a very unusual situation... An unreal one... Failures, for example, will be there... Whats important is how you handle failure. Similarly, because were human, a degree of conflict has to be there... Again, its how you handle it... You dont allow it to get out of hand... There must never be a breakdown in communication between the players and the coach... People will get emotional about certain things and if thats an issue, a dialogue can do wonders. 

On the marks he would give himself as Bangladeshs coach 

Its for others to rate me. 

On the marks he would, for example, give Greg Chappell 

(Grins again) No comments. 

On the present lot of Bangladesh players 

Theyre good... Theres no doubt that their heads are above water and, unlike in the past, arent in danger of drowning... Theyre heading in the right direction. Ive been impressed with a number of youngsters... Theyve come with less baggage... They arent weighed down by the past and, so, are less intimidated. Its a group which can be very competitive. 

On whether he has been a father-figure for the youngsters 

Ive been a professional and, yes, at times one has had to behave like a father. There are times when coaches have to be disciplinarians and there are times when theyve got to cajole. Ideally, the temperament ought to be even... The performance, obviously, too. (After a pause) If the players need to be yelled at, the coach wont step back and, when he yells, its for the right reason and not because he hates somebody. 

On whether he had to motivate himself a lot more when he took charge four years ago 

In some ways, the pressure was less... But its awful when the team loses... Ive gone through periods of frustration and those times do get difficult. One shouldnt get too emotional, but try and focus on the areas which need improvement. I must confess there have been occasions when, in the privacy of my hotel room, Ive been reduced to tears. 

On whether coaches have a shelf life 

Yes... But the period varies... After four years here, I need a break... Need to get away and recharge batteries... Four years is enough in this environment... Back in 2003, though, Id thought I still had much to give even after four years (second innings) with Sri Lanka... It depends on the individual, depends on the circumstances... Duncan Fletcher and John Buchanan put in over seven years... Theres always a time when one has to move on. 

On whether the coachs profile is important 

Its important to have a good coach. Period. 

On who is the boss in the dressing room 

Look, it becomes a problem if you start looking at it from a who-is-the-boss angle... Dont the captain and coach have a common goal? 

On coaches nowadays drawing more and more attention 

Well, we play an important role... Perhaps, its inevitable. 

On Bangladesh having pulled off terrific ODI wins during his tenure 

To be honest, the players behaviour after some of the successes left me quite unhappy... They seemed to get carried away and, the next morning, I had to ask them not to behave in a manner which suggested theyd achieved the ultimate... If thats the attitude, then you wont win another big game. 

On whether, had he been Sri Lankas coach, their approach would have been different in the last World Cup final 

Its an unfair question... The Sri Lankans played well in the tournament, but it didnt help that they lost the toss... They would have done better setting a target. 

On Muttiah Muralidharan, who regards him as a mentor of sorts, looking to continue for two-three years 

Hes hungry, but needs to be managed well as his bowling shoulder takes such a pounding... We did interact during the World Cup... The best thing about Murali is that he speaks his mind... There are no shades of grey. 

Finally, his advice to whoever succeeds him 

(Laughs) Be patient... Be understanding... Have the will to win and dont rest till youve reached your goal.

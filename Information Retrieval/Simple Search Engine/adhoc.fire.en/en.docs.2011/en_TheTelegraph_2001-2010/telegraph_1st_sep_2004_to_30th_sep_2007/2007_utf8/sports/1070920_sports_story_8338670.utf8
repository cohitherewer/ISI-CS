The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

SREEMOY TALUKDAR

Calcutta: The fear was very real. 

On Tuesday night, top seed Marion Bartoli was expected to bulldoze US teenager Vania King. Well, the Frenchwoman took the long flight home on Wednesday. 

So when Daniela Hantuchova stepped into the court in the evening, the tension was evident. 

The sleek Slovak swaggered in with the air of someone long used to the glare of spotlight. Dressed in a black outfit with white piping, she took in the flashes and cheers before getting down to business. 

In the 62 minutes that followed, the Giorgio Armani fan waltzed her way to a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Marta Domachowska to move into the Sunfeast Open second round. 

It was surgically done, the breaks coming at the right junctures. A professional at work. Not an inch out of place. 

The first set, lasting all of 30 minutes, was over even before Domachowska could find her feet. The very first point saw the rose-cheeked Slovak beauty use the drop shot to good effect. She didnt overdo it, but out it came when her forehands had pushed the Polish qualifier a few feet behind the baseline. 

The US Open is history. The first-round shock against Julia Vakulenko had served her well. Making the title round in Bali brought back her confidence and it showed at the Netaji Indoor Stadium. The second seed looked sharp and absolutely in control of her game. She needed two breaks to close out the first set 6-2. 

In the second, world No. 188 Domachowska had her sole break-point in the match. That she failed to take advantage ended all hopes of an unlikely comeback. Hantuchova was not in a mood to be profligate either. 

She expectedly achieved a couple more breaks and thanked the crowd after a job well done. The world No. 11 will take on Anastasia Rodionova in a battle of the models on Thursday. 

If Day II was brutal, the third day proved kind to the seeds. 

Maria Kirilenko, the fourth seed, brushed aside Ekaterina Ivanova 6-1, 6-4. Barring a few moments in the second set, Sharapovas friend was generally in command. 

Following the Hantuchova match, Indian wild card Tara Iyer came and promptly went home losing 3-6, 1-6 to seventh seed Flavia Pennetta. 

It was not all bad news for the home fans, though, as Sunitha Rao teaming up with Monique Adamczak of Australia defeated the US-Polish pair of Neha Uberoi and Domachowska 6-1, 6-4 to reach the quarter finals. 

No such luck for Ankita Bhambri and Rushmi Chakravarthi as the Indian pair went down 1-6, 1-6 to Vania King and Alla Kudryavtseva. Ashvarya Shrivastava and Kyra Shroff also lost by the same scoreline. 

In the afternoon, Tzipora Obziler shook off Tuesday nights fatigue to shut out Casey Dellacqua 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 in another gruelling baseline battle. 

The days first second-round tie saw Yung-Jan Chan making short work of Jarmila Gajdosova from Slovakia. The eighth-seeded girl from Chinese Taipei won 6-1, 6-2. 

In two first round encounters, British girl Anne Keothavong defeated Italys Sara Errani 6-4, 6-4, while Mariya Koryttseva of Ukraine put it past Adamczak 6-3, 6-3.

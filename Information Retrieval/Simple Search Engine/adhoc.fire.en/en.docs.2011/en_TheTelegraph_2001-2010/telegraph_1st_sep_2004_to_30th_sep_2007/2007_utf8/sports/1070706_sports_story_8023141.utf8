The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Season opener cancelled 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: The RCTC stewards have cancelled the July 12 race meeting, the scheduled opening day of the monsoon season, because of the heavy rains which have forced horses to remain indoors for four days.

 Even if the weather had been conducive, the opening day would still have been cancelled because of the stable hands refusal to bring out horses for trackwork since Monday. They were demanding their pending dearness allowance be cleared. Their dues were cleared on Thursday. The season may now begin on July 18, provided the rain gods relent.

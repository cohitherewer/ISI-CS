 Bowling is a real bonus for me, says McMillan

St Georges: Craig McMillan, reduced to looking for alternative employment after he was dropped by New Zealand at the end of 2005, played a key part in his countrys march to the World Cup semi-finals on Saturday. 

Man-of-the-Match McMillan picked up his first World Cup wicket in three tournaments when he bowled South Africas top scorer Herschelle Gibbs for 60. 

 He followed up with two more cheap victims, including the dangerous Mark Boucher, to finish with three for 23 in the Super Eight fixture. 

After captain Stephen Fleming left for 50, McMillan accelerated the New Zealand scoring rate to finish with an unbeaten 38 off 55 balls including a massive six into the stands to take his team to a five-wicket victory and the semi-finals. 

McMillan, who bowled five overs, said Fleming usually called on him to break a partnership. 

So its usually for maybe two or three overs, max, to try and get a wicket and then he goes back to the main bowlers, he said. 

They were my first wickets at a World Cup so its been a long time coming. 

From a personal point of view batting is my main art, bowling is a real bonus. 

Its good to show Flem that I can take a wicket here and there. I love bowling but its something that Im doing less and less. 

Recalled to the one-day side in 2006, McMillan gave some typically robust performances with the bat in the tri-series against Australia this year. 

The fastest one-day century by a New Zealander in the ensuing 3-0 series whitewash over Australia followed, ensuring a place in the World Cup squad. 

But it was as a medium-pace change bowler that McMillan made his mark in Saturdays match. 

Captain Stephen Fleming had turned to the 30-year-old because one of his usual medium-pace options, Scott Styris, was jaded after scoring a century and a half-century in the space of three days. 

Macca has the ability to get a wicket way out of the blue, Fleming said. 

The fact that he got three was a massive bonus for us. 

It was also timely to throw somebody out there who they hadnt thought about too much. Bouchers, in particular, was a massive wicket for us. 

Fleming sympathised with the plight of South Africa after New Zealands victory on Saturday. 

Its difficult for them to push the net run-rate at this late stage of the competition. They are in minus anyway and so perhaps Graeme (Smith) is right in suggesting that they are looking to win every match rather than worry about net run-rate, remarked Fleming. 

South Africa have a -0.21 run-rate after six games and have only the match against England left to turn things around. 

New Zealand, in contrast, have already qualified and their net run-rate (+1.07) is second only to Australia (+2.30). 

Fleming also backed South Africa to do well in their final game against England in Barbados on Tuesday. 

Its a tight game for both teams. Both are pretty similar sides and the pressure would be immense on them. But South Africa are expected to go through. 

Fleming acknowledged that the luck of the toss had played a critical role in his sides win over South Africa on the day. 

The toss played a big role. I learnt from my lesson in the previous game where the ball had done a lot in the first 10-15 overs. But Graeme had said after the toss that he would have batted anyway, Fleming said. 

Fleming looked ahead to his teams final encounter against Australia on April 20 at this very venue but said he wouldnt experiment now that his team has qualified for the finals. 

The time of experiment was before the World Cup. We wouldnt experiment, the only way a change is going to come is if there is an injury in the side.

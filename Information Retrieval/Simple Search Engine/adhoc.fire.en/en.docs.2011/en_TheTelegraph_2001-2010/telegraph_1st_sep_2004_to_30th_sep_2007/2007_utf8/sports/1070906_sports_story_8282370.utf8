London: It is no secret that batting enters a different zone in Twenty20 matches, but if you are still thinking of what to expect in the first world championship of crickets new avatar in a few days time, sample this. 

Sri Lanka A allrounder Dhanuka Pathirana smashed an incredible 277 off just 72 balls in a Twenty20 match and helped his side Austerlands to a remarkable win against Droylsden in Lancashires Saddleworth League. 

It was a breathtaking innings from the 25-year-old Sri Lankan, who went on to hit 29 sixes and 18 fours in his violent knock. 

A veteran of 46 first class matches, Pathirana powered his side to 366 for 3 in 20 overs, eclipsing Somersets county record of 250. 

Austerlands won on a better run rate as rain stopped play with Droylsden at 37 for 2. 

An amused Pathirana later described his innings as a fairytale knock. I was seeing it like a football. It was like a dream ... I think I did some serious damage to some of the vehicles in the car park, he was quoted as saying by a newspaper. 

Interestingly, the cricketer had not brought his bat, expecting the match to be washed out. He demolished the Droylsden with a borrowed bat. (PTI)

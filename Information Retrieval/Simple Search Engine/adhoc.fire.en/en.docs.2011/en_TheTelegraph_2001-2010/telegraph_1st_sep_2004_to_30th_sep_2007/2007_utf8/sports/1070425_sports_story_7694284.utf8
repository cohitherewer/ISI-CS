 Nixons future rests with Moores

CHRISTOPHER MARTIN-JENKINS 

 Paul Nixon 

There will be a new broom in the England dressing room when the team for the first Test against the West Indies has their first full practice three weeks from now, but for the time being it will be kept in the corner. The only clean sweeps that Peter Moores will be thinking about will be the ones that Michael Vaughans team inflicted on New Zealand and the West Indies when all was well with Duncan Fletchers world in 2004. 

Until the Schofield committee recommends otherwise, only the name and nature of the head coach will have changed when the new selection committee meets under David Graveneys familiar chairmanship very soon, no doubt to discuss the best XI to play at Lords from May 17. The very fact that Graveney and Geoff Miller remain two thirds of a selection committee that for the moment merely substitutes Moores for Fletcher and which will again be strongly influenced, no doubt, by the views of Vaughan, means that rabbits are not about to be plucked from the hat unexpectedly. 

The last of very few selections of this nature while Fletcher was the strongest voice in selection matters was Paul Nixon and whether he should now win a first Test cap at the age of 36, having made a great personal success of his World Cup adventure, is one of a number of tricky decisions to be made by Sunday week, when the team will be announced. Undoubtedly he could fill the gap as wicket-keeper-batsman if necessary because there is no worthier county professional, but only if the new committee and Moores, as a wicketkeeping expert, in particular are not sure who the next long-term wicketkeeper should be. 

It is a vital question because it affects the balance of the whole side. If Nixon plays it should be at No. 8, with Andrew Flintoff one place ahead of him. That would save a delicate decision created by the return of Vaughan. If England do not play six specialist batsmen, one of Andrew Strauss, Alastair Cook, Paul Collingwood and Ian Bell is going to have to make away for Vaughan. 

Other than Vaughan, already confirmed as captain, Kevin Pietersen is at present the specialist batting certainty. It may not be long before Marcus Trescothick comes back into the mix, too, and if Ravi Boparas form justifies consideration in the next fortnight, there is no reason why he should not be considered a Test prospect as well as one of the main building blocks in the reconstituted one-day team. 

Hindsight says that the decision to bring Trescothick back too early this time last year without having overcome bouts of a stress-related illness was a mistake based on wishful thinking and after repeating the error for the trip to Australia, it would be foolish to take further gambles, tempting though they might be. It could be argued, too, that England failed to beat Sri Lanka in the equivalent Test last year despite playing four specialist bowlers plus Flintoff, who, as captain, felt the need to bowl 68 overs and three balls himself. 

In fact it was mainly a series of dropped catches that prevented England from winning that game, even with three very inexperienced bowlers in Monty Panesar, Sajid Mahmood and Liam Plunkett. Panesar and Vaughan, who has to become a more regular bowler because he is a proper off-spinner, should balance Flintoff, Stephen Harmison and Matthew Hoggard this time. If conditions demand a fourth fast bowler, my preference would be for Stuart Broad or Graham Onions, unless Plunkett or James Anderson has provided compelling evidence of red-hot form in county cricket in the next fortnight. When Simon Jones has proved his fitness, the selectors will be choosing from a rich mix. 

Moores is fortunate to inherit this strong hand of fast bowlers but his crucial contribution as far as selection is concerned will be to choose the right man to keep wickets. He is well placed to do so, not just because of his own experience but because he was able to compare at first-hand during the A tour to Bangladesh the batting and wicketkeeping abilities of Matthew Prior and Steven Davies. Nixon, in fact, is only one of a long list of alternatives with little to choose between them: apart from Prior and Davies, Chris Read, James Foster, Jonathan Batty, Tim Ambrose and Phil Mustard could all make a case in the next two weeks. 

 The ideal is a truly top-class 

 wicketkeeper capable of batting at No. 6 in a Test order, 

 or, to put it another way, capable of averaging 35 in Test 

 cricket.

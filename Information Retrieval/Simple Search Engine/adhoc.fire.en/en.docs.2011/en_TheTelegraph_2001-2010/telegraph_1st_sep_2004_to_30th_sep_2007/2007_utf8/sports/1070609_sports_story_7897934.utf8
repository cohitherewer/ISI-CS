The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Md. Sp. blame ex-coaches

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting have held both their former coaches, Subhas Bhowmick and Biswajit Bhattacharya, responsible for the teams poor performance during the recently concluded 11th National Football League. Goalkeeper Gopal Das and defender Madhav Das were also held accountable for the below par showing. 

While Bhowmick was held solely responsible for the teams relegation from NFL first division, Bhattacharya was blamed for the clubs 0-9 drubbing at the hands of Mahindra United in their 18th round match. 

According to club general secretary Sultan Ahmed, a three-member committee has held the four guilty. 

Bhowmick was never serious... His selection of players were inept and in the process he wasted our time, the secretary said. 

Bhattacharya was very reluctant in that match against Mahindra He had no gameplan and was aggressive even after conceding five goals he explained. Both Gopal and Madhav have sabotaged us They have done it in a planned way and we can prove that from the match clippings. 

The club will not suspend any of the players but the executive committee has decided to send letters to the AIFF and IFA requesting them to take necessary action against the players. 

Bhowmick declined to comment anything on the issue and Bhattacharya could not be contacted. 

Current coach Shabbir Ali, meanwhile, is likely to go to Brazil or Nigeria to look for a striker. 

Basudeb Mondal, Akshay Das and Rajib Ahmed were the noted players who were roped in by Mohammedan Sporting on Friday.

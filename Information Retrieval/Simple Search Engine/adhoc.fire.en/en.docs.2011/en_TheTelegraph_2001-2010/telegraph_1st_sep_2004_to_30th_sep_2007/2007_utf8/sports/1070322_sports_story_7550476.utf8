 Sobers likes Australias aggression

Melbourne: The Australian teams on-field aggression may not be endorsed by Indian icon Sunil Gavaskar, but West Indies legend Gary Sobers is a huge fan of the world champions attitude as it reflects their intense passion for the game. 

Australians have always played cricket like the West Indians. I always enjoyed playing in Australia because they are a team that tried to play the game attractive, tried to win not at all costs but tried, Sobers said. 

Sobers said the Aussies should not be bothered by the criticism of their tough style of play as their on-field attitude was worth emulating. 

That is a great attitude to have. You learn when you play Australia, there is a toughness about them, Sobers was quoted as saying in a local daily. 

The former allrounder said the game had become much bigger than it was during his playing days, so the players needed a much hardened attitude to cope with on-field pressures. 

The West Indies played the game because they loved it, there was no monetary element involved It was sheer love and enjoyment, and we went out there and played the game, he said. 

Now its different. Today there is a lot of money involved in the game. Players are paid quite well and they are more professional than when we were playing. People expect so much more these days, he said. 

Gavaskar had raised a furore when he said if the Australians acted in a bar the way they did on the field, they would probably end up being bashed. 

The former India captain linked the death of ex-Aussie cricketer David Hookes to the behaviour of Australian teams led by Steve Waugh and Ricky Ponting. 

Gavaskar later apologised for his reference to Hookes, but remained defiant about his original comment, that the Australian team would be more admired if it curbed its aggressive on-field behaviour. (PTI)

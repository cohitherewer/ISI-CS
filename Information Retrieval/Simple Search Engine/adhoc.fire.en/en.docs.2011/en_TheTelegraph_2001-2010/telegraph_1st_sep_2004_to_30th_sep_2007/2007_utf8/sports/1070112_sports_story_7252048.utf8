The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I am mentally ready to return: Yuvraj

Mumbai: Having made satisfactory progress since being laid down by a knee injury late last year, Indias key middle-order batsman Yuvraj Singh is looking to prove his match fitness through a series of practice games in the coming days. 

Yuvraj, who underwent a half-an-hour batting stint at the nets before the watchful eyes of BCCI physician Dr Anant Joshi, said he was confident of making a comeback soon. 

Im mentally confident to be back (into the Indian squad). I will prove my fitness through the four matches that I intend to play for Indian Airlines over the next few days. Then its up to the selectors, the left-handed batsman said. 

Yuvraj was put through his paces, which included running backwards, sideways and stretching, and also batted in the nets against both pace and spin. 

He also ran between the wickets as Joshi and his physiotherapist son Mithun watched from the sidelines. 

Yuvraj, who wore a knee brace when practising, said he did not feel any discomfort at all. I am playing a match tomorrow (with the Mumbai under-19 probables at the Bandra-Kurla Complex). I am an employee of the Indian Airlines and will play three matches later in the month with my team in Calcutta, he said. 

Dr Joshi also expressed his happiness over the progress made by the batsman, but cautioned that his fitness could be determined only under match conditions. (PTI)

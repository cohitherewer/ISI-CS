 Stepney ready to reveal all

Rome: The ex-Ferrari employee at the centre of the Formula One espionage saga says he is ready to spell out names in a bid to prove his innocence. 

Nigel Stepney has been the subject of an investigation by Italian police after being accused of supplying McLaren chief designer Mike Coughlan with secret technical information on the Italian team. Ferrari has since sacked Stepney. 

Speaking on the Stepneys behalf, Italian lawyer Sonia Bartolini said her client was prepared to name those who he believes are really behind the scandal in attempt to clear his name. 

Stepney has stressed he is innocent and is ready to give the names of the people he suspects, Bartolini said on Tuesday. 

He has reiterated that he has nothing to do with the business to which his name has been associated, and he wants those who are guilty identified. 

Coughlan is facing legal action brought by Ferrari at Londons high court, while McLaren have been summoned to an extraordinary meeting of the FIAs World Motor Sport Council in Paris on July 26. 

The council will hear McLaren answer a charge that they breached Article 151c of the International Sporting Code. 

The rule relates to any fraudulent conduct, or any act prejudicial to the interests of any competition, or to the interests of motor sport generally. 

If they are found guilty of industrial espionage, the British team could face a points deduction in this years Formula One world championship, or even expulsion.

 Loss a blessing in disguise: McGrath

 - Sundays match vs England will mark pacers final appearance at the SCG 

Sydney: Australias defeat to England in the first tri-series one-day final on Friday could be a blessing in disguise, according to fast bowler Glenn McGrath. 

The Australians were hot favourites to win the first of the three finals and avenge their surprise loss to the same opposition a week ago, but produced one of their poorest displays of the season to suffer a four-wicket defeat. 

McGrath, who was dismissed for a duck, dropped a catch and failed to take a wicket, said Australias embarrassing defeat against England was just the wake-up call they needed before the World Cup. 

Last night was probably one of the worst performances that Ive been involved in for a long, long time, McGrath said at the Sydney airport on Saturday. Sometimes you need that, especially leading into a big series like the World Cup. 

We let ourselves down last night but hopefully we can learn from it. 

McGrath said he was confident Australia would learn from their mistakes when they play England in Sydney on Sunday, needing to win to force a third and deciding match. 

To have something like that makes us all refocus again and realise whats important and get out there and do the job properly, he said. 

Im not sure what it is but it definitely wasnt one of our better games. 

Hopefully we can turn that around come tomorrow and really put a good performance on the board. 

McGrath has extra motivation to ensure Australia win on Sunday with the match marking his final international appearance at his home ground after the lanky paceman announced he would retire after the World Cup in March and April. (Reuters)

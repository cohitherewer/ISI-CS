 Saudi Arabia, Iraq in final

Hanoi: Iraq brought widespread joy to their war-torn country on Wednesday by sinking South Korea to reach their first Asian Cup final. 

The Iraqis 4-3 penalty shootout victory over the Koreans set up an all-Arab clash with Saudi Arabia, who shattered Japans dreams of a third straight title with a pulsating 3-2 win here. 

Goalkeeper Noor Sabri was Iraqs hero, after he saved South Koreas fourth spot-kick from Yeom Ki-hun to leave the 2002 World Cup semi-finalists shell-shocked in rainy Kuala Lumpur. 

Id like to congratulate all my people in Iraq for this great victory, Sabri said. We know we are struggling inside Iraq and we have to struggle on the field. This is a very modest thing we can give to our people. 

Iraq had never before advanced further than the last four of the continents premier competition. 

There was also high drama in Hanoi as Saudi Arabia finally broke their Asian Cup jinx against holders Japan with Malek Maaz scoring twice in an end-to-end game. 

The Saudi striker sent his country into their sixth final in the last seven tournaments with a fine solo goal, wriggling past three defenders before smashing the ball into the top corner. 

Saudi Arabia, who lifted the Asian Cup in 1984, 1988 and 1996, face Iraq in Jakarta on Sunday. Saudi captain Yasser Al Qahtani had volleyed his side in front in the 35th minute but Japan took just two minutes to pull level through defender Yuji Nakazawas towering header. 

Maaz restored Saudi Arabias lead with a bullet header two minutes into the second half only for Yuki Abe to equalise again for Japan with an acrobatic volley in the 53rd minute.

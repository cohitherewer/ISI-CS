Puerto La Cruz: Paraguay, inspired by a Roque Santa Cruz hattrick, thumped Colombia 5-0 while Argentina overpowered the United States 4-1 in a glut of goals at the Copa America on Thursday. Hernan Crespo equalled Diego Maradonas Argentine goal count. 

Favourites Argentina survived an early fright against inexperienced opponents, going behind to an Eddie Johnson penalty before two Hernan Crespo goals set them on the way to an impressive win. 

Colombia striker Alvaro Dominguez missed a penalty two minutes before Paraguay opened the scoring in the first game of the group C double bill in Maracaibo. The result prompted Colombia coach Jorge Luis Pinto to apologise to his countrymen. I lament the score, he said. Im sorry for Colombia and for my country. 

Argentina had Juan Roman Riquelme back in the side after going back on his decision to quit and Juan Sebastian Veron playing his first competitive international since 2003 but looked in trouble early on. 

Johnson won and converted a ninth-minute penalty to give the United States, who are playing as Copa guests and brought an experimental team, a shock lead. 

Crespo equalised two minutes later but Argentina were then frustrated by a packed US defence for nearly an hour. Crespo finally put Argentina ahead in the 64th minute, running onto to Lionel Messis pass to place his shot beyond Kasey Keller. 

Crespo equalled Maradonas 34 goals for La Albiceleste. The achievement was made special by the presence of Maradona at the game. Retired striker Gabriel Batistuta is Argentinas all-time top scorer, with 56 goals. Its an immense honour for me to equal the achievement of Diego, Crespo said. 

Substitutes Pablo Aimar and Carlos Tevez added two more late in the game as their opponents were forced to open up. 

The United States successfully defended the Concacaf Gold Cup on Sunday, but only four members of that winning side played against Argentina two as second-half substitutes and they were outgunned by an Argentina side which is close to full strength.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sehwag picked for No. 3 slot

 - Next months tour of Bangladesh 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Virender Sehwag 

Mumbai: Rahul Dravids Suitable Boy Virender Sehwag hasnt been picked as an opener for the three ODIs in Bangladesh. 

Gautam Gambhir and Robin Uthappa will, as of now, open... Sehwag has been selected for the No. 3 position, a top source told The Telegraph on Saturday. 

In recent times, Sehwag has been both opening and batting down the order. 

Where the Test squad is concerned, the two positions at the very top of the order are going to be taken by Wasim Jaffer and Dinesh Karthik. 

The duo opened in Team Indias last Test, in Cape Town, earlier this year. Did well too, after Sehwag got demoted. 

Perhaps, its premature to say anything definitely, but veteran V.V.S. Laxman and Yuvraj Singh will probably have to fight for one of the middle-order berths. 

Barring the unexpected, Ramesh Powar is going to make his Test debut in Chittagong, which hosts the opening match of that series. 

While the ODIs are from May 10-15, the Test series has been scheduled for between May 18-29.

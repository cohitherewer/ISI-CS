 Narains effort goes in vain

New Delhi: Narain Karthikeyan battled through a tough feature race but his efforts bore no fruit as A1 Team India finished 18th in the ninth rounds of A1GP in Mexico City. 

The Chennai-born racer was behind the wheel for his third race but it was another tough day for the F1 test driver as he struggled to find a good set-up. 

The ace driver salvaged an 11th place finish in the sprint race but fortunes turned in an incident filled feature race, which saw the team cross the line in 18th. Germany won the race. (PTI)

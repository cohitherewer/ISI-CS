 An attempt to catch attention

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Cuttack: A day after the manhandling of Greg Chappell shocked the cricket fraternity all over, both India and the West Indies camps condemned the incident describing it as very sad and unfortunate. 

However, Rahul Dravid packed a punch to it, saying it was done to gain public attention. It was a very sad and disappointing thing to happen. But incidents such as this do not surprise me these days its so easy to become famous overnight, Dravid said. 

A day ago, nobody knew about Kalinga Sena and see, overnight, how famous they have become, he explained. 

With so much publicity around, more and more incidents like this keep happening. And people are doing funny things to catch attention, he added. 

His counterpart in the West Indies Brian Lara who will though skip the second ODI due to knee injury also felt it was unfortunate. Greg Chappell is a big man. So its very unfortunate and uncalled for Lara said. 

The hosts, Orissa Cricket Association (OCA) however sees vested interest in all this. The incident was intentionally done by some crooked people who want to tarnish the OCAs image, secretary Asirbad Behera said. 

Kalinga Sena is nothing but an association of 20-25 members. And they have paid money to somebody to carry this out, Behera claimed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Good to get a billions support, says Bermuda captain

Port of Spain: More than a billion Indians will be desperately hoping Bermuda score an upset World Cup victory on Sunday when they face Bangladesh in the final group B match. 

While Bangladesh would be eyeing a place in the second round for the first time, Indian fans will be praying the debutants pull off an unlikely win which could allow India to sneak through on net run rate. 

Tomorrow (Sunday) Indian fans are really banking on us to play well, a smiling Bermuda skipper Irvine Romaine said on Saturday. It is good to have that support. 

Bangladesh only need to avoid defeat to enter the Super Eight with group leaders Sri Lanka. 

We still want a victory against Bangladesh, Romaine said. The nerves have definitely calmed down going into the match. 

We played Bangladesh in Antigua and scored over 200, he said. Weve the ability to post a total against them. They are very good and young team, but inconsistent. Sunday may be an off day for them and we may catch them napping. 

Bangladesh, making only their third World Cup appearance, were trying to keep their emotions in check. 

Tomorrow we have a fair chance to go to the Super Eight, captain Habibul Bashar said. 

Were bracing for one of Bangladesh crickets biggest moments, I hope my young boys can hold their nerves as the expectations have increased a lot, Bashar said after Saturdays nets session at the Queens Park Oval. 

Crickets a big game in our country, making the Super Eight will be a very significant moment for us, said Bashar.

 Jyoti falters

Kildare: A triple bogey on the 13th hole dashed Jyoti Randhawas hopes for a top-10 place and his par-70 final round earned him a tied 25th finish at the Smurfit Kappa European Open on Sunday. 

Jeev Milkha Singh had a bogey-free round of 68 for a three-under 277. He finished in tied 34th place. 

Randhawa was in contention for a top-10 finish after lying second on the first day. Dropping three shots on the par-four 13th hole on Sunday, however, wrecked his prospects and the Indian totalled four-under 276 for four rounds. 

Scotlands Colin Montgomerie claimed his 31st European Tour title when he won by a stroke from Swedens Niclas Fasth. 

Meanwhile, Arjun Atwal sank eight birdies in his final round to finish tied third at the $525,000 Legend Financial Group Classic golf tournament on the Nationwide Tour on Sunday. 

 Australian Jason Day carded a 67 to win the title 

 with a record 16-under 268.

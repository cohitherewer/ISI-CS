The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Well have a tough tour in India

Calcutta: There is something that always keeps Michael Kasprowicz going. 

If its not (international) cricket which he has not played since being left out of Cricket Australias central contracts following a recurrence of groin injury its the University of Queensland that keeps the 35-year-old busy. 

Kasprowicz, here as a goodwill ambassador of the university, still cherishes his moments in India. Bowling to 5 feet 4 inches Sachin Tendulkar is what Kasprowicz remembers most. 

A veteran of 38 Tests nine against India Kasprowicz considers Sachin as the toughest. He was the toughest to bowl to. Especially in the Indian conditions, he was hard to contain. Its very difficult to stop him from scoring runs, the 35-year-old said. 

In the five Tests where he bowled against the Master Blaster, Kasprowicz scalped Sachin twice (caught and bowled in the second innings of the Bangalore Test and caught by Greg Blewett in the first innings of the Eden Test, both in 1997-98). But he still cherishes the caught and bowled dismissal where the Little Master was flummoxed by a slower one. And that was when Australia won the Test by eight wickets. He has all the footage recorded as part of his personal collection. 

Sachin, who missed out on another century by 18 runs at the Brit Oval on Friday, should continue playing, felt the Aussie. If he enjoys his game, then why not 

Kasprowicz, who is certain to miss out from the Australian seven-match ODI tour to India in September-October this year, said: Indians are performing quite well at the moment The series will be very competitive. It will be a good test for them in India as the conditions are tough here. 

Kasprowicz is still optimistic about a comeback. Im recovering very well. Ill make a comeback in this summer (October). With (Glenn) McGrath not playing, a good performance and with the experience factor Im hopeful... I know itll be hugely tough, Kasprowicz, who had become the fifth youngest player to represent Queensland as a 17-year-old, added. 

On the proposed Indian Cricket League, he said: Im not approached by them and nor Im interested in it At the moment my focus is to play for Queensland.

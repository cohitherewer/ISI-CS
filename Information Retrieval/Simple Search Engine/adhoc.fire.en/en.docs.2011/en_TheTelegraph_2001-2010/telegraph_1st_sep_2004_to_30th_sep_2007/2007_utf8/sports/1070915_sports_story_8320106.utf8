The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Shock at Dravid decision

A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: Rahul Dravids decision to step down has come as a shock and surprise to the cricketing fraternity. The Telegraph spoke to some of the city-based former India players. 

The following are excerpts (alphabetically): 

DEEP DASGUPTA: The decision was shocking. I dont know the reasons behind it. We won the Test series after 21 years in England and went close in the one-dayers Theres nothing much to say. It boils down to what the team is looking at and what direction the selectors are hoping to give the side Theres quite a few seniors around. 

 Let one thing be clear, you cant groom a captain at this level. Whoever is captain I dont think it should be a big issue. 

ARUN LAL: I was surprised and disappointed at the decision. In a sense, Dravid was trying to get the team in an even keel after the World Cup disappointment. I was happy with the performance in England, both Tests and ODIs. 

The media also played its part in our country theres no right way of doing anything, specially for the Indian captain. Dravid is a bit of an emotional kind of guy. 

ASHOK MALHOTRA: Its shocking to say the least. Ive never heard of a captain stepping after having done reasonably well with the bat. Has the decision got only to do with his batting or theres some- thing more to it than meets the eye? 

Why did no one try to convince him. Why did Rahul send the letter to the president and not the chairman of selectors? I would prefer Sourav in Tests and Dhoni in one-dayers. 

PRANAB ROY: The decision was unexpected and surprising after the series win in England. 

 But I think its been a good decision as it would give him the opportunity to concentrate on his batting. 

Having Sachin as vice-captain in Tests was a mistake. Now if we dont make him the captain, it will be a bigger mistake. As for one-dayers, Dhoni should be ideal.

BOARDSPEAK

SHARAD PAWAR (BCCI president): He (Dravid) wants to continue playing and improve his performance. Accepting his resignation is not in my hands. The decision rests with the selection committee, but we should respect it. Dravid first told me during the recent tour of England that he wanted to step down. He said captaincy was affecting his batting and he now wants to concentrate on his game. 

RAJEEV SHUKLA (BCCI vice-president): He has been requesting it for the past couple of days. He was feeling burdened as a player and captain. The BCCI will now consider the options. I think reasons are personal. He must have pondered over it.

NIRANJAN SHAH (BCCI secretary): We all like Dravid because he has done well for the Indian team. The (BCCI) president has spoken to him and the selection committee will also speak to him. Players at a certain age decide for themselves. 

CHANDU BORDE (former captain and cricket manager on the just-ended England tour): The decision has come as a complete surprise to me, a bolt from the blue. He never discussed this even once when we were on the long tour. 

LALCHAND RAJPUT (cricket manager in Twenty20): We were all surprised... He must be having his reasons to do so and we must respect his decision.

 Maria sticks to tennis over modelling

Hong Kong: The biggest draw in womens tennis, Russian beauty Maria Sharapova, said on Tuesday she had no plans to quit tennis in favour of a lucrative career in modelling. 

The 19-year-old world No. 2 said she was still hungry to win on the court even though she earned an estimated $22 million in endorsements, including the promotion of fashion products, last year. 

Im happy with the way my career is going at the moment, said Sharapova, who is in Hong Kong for a weekend invitational warm-up tournament ahead of the Australian Open. 

Im working hard on my game and I can hardly say that for the modelling, Sharapova added. 

The 2004 Wimbledon and reigning US Open champion said she was still determined to extend her list of tennis titles and that she had not even considered retiring. I cant tell you how I may feel in the future you never know, I may wake up in the morning and not want to play anymore, she said. But at the moment I want to play and when that feeling goes, thats when Ill stop. 

Sharapova dismissed suggestions she was now more famous as a model than as a tennis player. I have won two (Grand) Slam tournaments I think its all a matter of perception and opinion, she said. I have been a tennis player since I was four years old. 

Sharapova takes on the cream of womens tennis, including world No. 5 Kim Clijsters and 2004 US Open champion Svetlana Kutznetsova, in the Watsons Water Champions Challenge, beginning Thursday. (AFP)

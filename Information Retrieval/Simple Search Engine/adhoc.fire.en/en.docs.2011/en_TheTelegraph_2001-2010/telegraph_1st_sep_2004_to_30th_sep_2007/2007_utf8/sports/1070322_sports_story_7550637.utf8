 Bangla look for first Test tour of India

Dhaka: Bangladesh authorities said on Wednesday that a comprehensive victory over India could pave the way for the national teams first Test tour to its mighty cricketing neighbour. 

Bangladesh, perennial minnows in the cricket world, made a glorious start at the World Cup with a five-wicket win over India in their opening match on Saturday. 

This victory has brightened our chances for a full-fledged tour of India in the near future, Bangladesh Cricket Board chief executive officer Mahmudur Rahman said. 

Certainly our case has been strengthened with this win and India will now look at it with importance, he said, adding the victory also reflected the countrys growing cricket potential. 

India were the opponents when Bangladesh played its debut Test match at home soon after the country was inducted as the 10th Test cricket nation in late 2000. 

Since then, India has toured Bangladesh once, and has also announced the date for a three-week tour to the country in May this year. But India are the only country among the Test-playing nations which has not hosted any Test series against Bangladesh at home, a fact that recently drew sharp criticism from some of Bangladeshs cricket experts.

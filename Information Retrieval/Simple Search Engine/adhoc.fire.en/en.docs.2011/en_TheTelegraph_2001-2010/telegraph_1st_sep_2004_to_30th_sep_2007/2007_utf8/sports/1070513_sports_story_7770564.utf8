 Gambhir, Chawla script series win in style

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

 Piyush Chawla, who bagged three for 37, in Dhaka on Saturday 

Dhaka: March 17, 2007 will remain a black day in Indian cricket. Saturdays series win can in no way erase the memories of that fateful evening in Port of Spain when Team India struggled to come to terms with the reality. 

Then, a shell-shocked Rahul Dravid was at loss of words saying it was the one of the lowest points in his career. Having taken a revenge of sorts at the Sher-e-Bangla Stadium, there was no show of emotion on the captains face. He rather wished to focus on the tougher battles ahead. 

Bangladesh seemed destined to lose even before they began their chase in the second ODI. The opening match had a demoralising effect on them even as the Indians were bubbling with confidence. That they had to get 285 in such trying conditions also took its toll mentally. 

Like true professionals, the Indians played their roles to perfection. Their batting revolved around Gautam Gambhirs century and useful contributions from the middle-order. The bowlers got it right this time as India registered a 46-run win to clinch the three match series with a 2-0 lead. 

Despite one Dinesh Mongia over in which Mashrafe Mortaza hit four consecutive sixes the bowling looked impressive. 

Piyush Chawla, preferred over an unfit Sreesanth, impressed on debut with three for 37. He bowled Mohammed Ashraful with a googly and deceived Habibul Bashar and Mohammed Rafique with flight and deviation. Offie Ramesh Powar and the pacers stuck to their plans too. 

But it was Man-of-the-Match Gambhirs innings (101 off 113 balls) that made the difference. 

Realising that run making wasnt going to be easy, the Indians concentrated on rotating the strike to maintain a run-rate of around five an over right through out the innings. 

Even somebody like Mahendra Singh Dhoni curtailed his slam-bang approach. 

His new style may not inspire his die-hard fan, but it certainly did a lot to the teams cause. Dhonis 36 off 54 balls, courtesy a few dropped chances, was painful to watch, but the 87 runs he set up with Gambhir gave direction to the total. 

This has been one of Shastris biggest achievements on this tour. He has managed to send across the message of sacrificing individual flair and interest towards a common goal. 

One Virender Sehwag, however, refuses to learn. The comeback of Mortaza meant that Bangladesh had more options, but as he failed to settle into a line, Sehwag took advantage. But being over-ambitious once again brought about his downfall. 

Having been in and out of the side, Gambhir knows the importance of making use of the limited chances. With clever dissection of the field and energetic running, he frustrated the bowlers. After a breezy start, he settled down into a groove. 

A typical demonstration of his enduring skill and indomitable spirit helped Gambhir reach his second ODI century. 

The hosts fielding also played its part he was dropped twice, the last time when he was on 95. The oppressive conditions did take its toll in the later part of his innings as he suffered cramps and was forced to use a runner (Sehwag). 

Dravid was left to wage a lone battle towards the end once old ways returned to haunt the Indians. As the India captain nudged around hitting only one boundary in his unbeaten 42 off 47 balls, the late-order attempted some rash strokes in a suicidal manner. 

It didnt prove dear since by then the hosts had thrown in the towel.

 Davydenkos semis date with Federer

 Justine Henin after her win over Serena Williams on Tuesday 

Paris: Serena Williams failed to end Justine Henins record run at the French Open. 

Keeping Serena on the move with versatile stroke-making, two-time defending champion Henin advanced to the semi-finals by winning 6-4, 6-3 on Tuesday. With this victory, Henin extended her Open era record winning streak at Roland Garros to 31 consecutive sets. 

The Belgian is two rounds from becoming the first woman to win three consecutive French Open titles since Monica Seles in 1990-92. 

Serena, who had won her past 11 Grand Slam matches, was the lone remaining American in mens or womens singles. 

Among men, top-ranked Roger Federer set an Open era record by extending his winning streak in Grand Slam matches to 36 consecutive sets then lost the next set. 

He regrouped and hit a series of brilliant shots down the stretch to beat No. 9-seeded Tommy Robredo in the quarter finals 7-5, 1-6, 6-1, 6-2. 

I was struggling, its true, Federer said. I was like, OK, this could start becoming really bad here. Thank God I played a great third and fourth set. 

In the final two sets, he had 26 winners to five for Robredo. 

Federer, who has reached the semi-finals in a record 12 consecutive major events, is seeking the only Grand Slam title he has yet to win. Hell next play fourth-seeded Nikolay Davydenko, who defeated No.19 Guillermo Canas 7-5, 6-4, 6-4. 

Federer is 8-0 against Davydenko, including a semi-final win at the US Open last year. 

Henins opponent Thursday will be No. 4-seeded Jelena Jankovic, who beat No.6 Nicole Vaidisova 6-3, 7-5. 

The other womens semi-final will be between No.2 Maria Sharapova and No. 7 Ana Ivanovic. Sharapova beat No.9 Anna Chakvetadze 6-3, 6-4, and Ivanovic defeated 2006 runner-up Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-0, 3-6, 6-1. 

For Sharapova, Ivanovic and Jankovic, its their best showing at the French Open. The 19-year-old Ivanovic is a first-time Grand Slam semi-finalist. 

Serena revived her career by winning the Australian Open in January for her eighth Grand Slam title, and she was considered Henins most formidable hurdle this week. 

The meeting was their first at Roland Garros since 2003, when a semi-final victory by Henin included boos for Williams and left a bitter aftertaste on both sides. 

 The lone jeers this time came 

 when a frustrated Serena slammed her racket when she lost 

 serve in the opening game of the second set. The boos quickly 

 subsided, and while the crowd favoured the French-speaking 

 Henin, they applauded Serena when she left the court after 

 the match.

 Robredo in Round III

Barcelona: Third seed Tommy Robredo demolished fellow Spaniard Feliciano Lopez 6-2, 6-2 on Tuesday to cruise into the third round of the Barcelona Open. 

Robredo, runner-up to Rafael Nadal last year and the winner in 2004, needed just 69 minutes to advance to a clash with 15th seed Agustin Calleri of Argentina or Italian qualifier Paolo Lorenzi in the last 16. 

Fourth seed David Nalbandian breezed into the last 16 with a 6-2, 6-0 drubbing of Spaniard Alberto Martin. 

Argentine Guillermo Canas eased past Max Mirnyi of Belarus 6-2, 7-6 in a first-round battle. But there was another defeat for former world No. 1 Marat Safin as he went down 4-6, 6-7 to Simone Bolelli.

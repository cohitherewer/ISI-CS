The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We dont deserve to go into the second round, says Dravid

 - No one understands the enormity of this more than the players 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Port of Spain: There was no show of emotion, but their faces said it all. As dreams lay shattered and reputations were laid to dust at the Queens Park Oval, not many knew how to react. An eerie silence prevailed as players and fans alike struggled to come to terms with the harsh reality. 

The autograph seekers had disappeared and there was none around, except for the odd security men, as the players trooped out of the dressing room and into the waiting bus. For some their last World Cup had turned out to be Indias worst since 1979. 

The post-mortem has begun. If Rahul Dravid struggled for words to express the disappointment, Greg Chappell tried to play it safe saying this was not the right forum to discuss such issues post-Bob Woolmer. 

Considering recent incidents, youve got to be concerned. Im sure things are in place. There will be lot of disappointment and anger, but they should realise its just a game, said Chappell. 

Dravid hoped the players were not in any physical danger. There will be lot of people disappointed and angry back home fair enough They had invested a lot of hope in this team and we havent delivered. 

Dravid owned responsibility and was spot on when he said that India did not deserve to go into the second round. Its too early to collect my thoughts, he said at the media conference. Its really disappointing, a lot of hard work had gone into it over the last year. We did not play well in this tournament and dont deserve to go into the second round. 

I am not sitting here and trying to shirk responsibility. I am the first one to stand up and say that we should have done better, and it starts with me. I am not trying to put the responsibility on anyone. 

People have been asking me whats the way forward and what do we do? I havent really thought about it. Till about 24 hours ago, I truly believed that we would still be in this tournament. I didnt have the time to think whats ahead of us. I am not trying to say I dont take any responsibility. I take full responsibility for the fact that we havent progressed to the next round. 

Dravid, though, was forthcoming. Thats the nature of one-day cricket, we had a bad game against Bangladesh where we did not really bat well up front. That sort of put pressure on us. Today again we did not bat well enough 255 was gettable and we failed to stitch together a single partnership. 

Has he found any reason for the batsmen time and again crumbling under pressure? Some of these guys have had success before as well. Its a question of the guys going back and looking at their performances in critical games Yes, we have not batted anywhere near our potential. It is definitely something to think about. 

It will always remain a disappointment. Its not an ideal scenario. Its not something that, if you were writing a fairytale, you would write it this way. But thats what sports is all about. Sometimes things dont work out the way you want. Thats the beauty and cruelty of sports. 

Even as he spoke, the disappointment came through. No one feels worse about it than the players. I know you guys feel bad and disappointed. The players also feel similarly. A lot of their dreams, a lot of their hopes go into tournaments like this. When it doesnt work out for them, they feel more than anyone else. 

Nobody realises the enormity of the defeat than the players themselves. The players are the ones who put in a lot of time and hard work. It is an opportunity they get once in four years. It is something that you really look forward to in your career. So no one understands the enormity of this more than the players. There is a lot of introspection and disappointment in the dressing room. 

Does he feel some of the players shouldnt have been in the side? Its too early, and its not for me to say these things. I guess there is a month now People who make decisions will have to sit down and think about it and see what they feel is the best way to take things forward or how things should move forward. 

Will he continue as captain? I was appointed captain till the World Cup. So I am not even the captain at this point of time. So its not my decision to make.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I have the experience to contribute, says Shastri

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former India captain Ravi Shastri, who was appointed cricket manager for the tour of Bangladesh on Saturday, believes with his experience he could play a part in putting Indian cricket back on track. 

It did surprise me but having said that if you look at the state of Indian cricket at the moment, I thought it was a good time to put your hand up and asked to be counted, Shastri said on ESPN-Star Sports. 

For the years you have played the game and the years you have been part of the media, I do believe I have the experience to contribute, he added. 

Shastri also said that the World Cup debacle did not make the Indian team bad overnight. 

You are not going to change the team overnight and I do not believe this team can be bad in seven days I dont think this outfit can be a very good team in 14 days. There is a lot that can be done to make sure that the path is set for the team to move forward, he explained. 

Shastri also expressed happiness with the Board of Control for Cricket in Indias (BCCIs) offer to Greg Chappell to continue his association with Indian cricket. 

His presentation was outstanding. I am so happy that BCCI has offered Chappell a role in Indian cricket. The man has tremendous knowledge, he might not be happy with the way things have gone for the last year and half. But I believe he has still a lot to offer to Indian cricket, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 United held by Boro

London: Manchester Uniteds hopes of repeating their 1999 treble remained alive on Saturday after a 68th-minute penalty by Cristiano Ronaldo secured a 2-2 draw at Middlesbrough in their FA Cup quarter final. 

United, top of the Premier League and into the last eight of the Champions League, took the lead with a Wayne Rooney shot after 23 minutes. 

Uniteds star striker broke the deadlock after taking his time to drill a low shot past the outstretched arm of Mark Schwarzer. 

The Red Devils looked on course for a record-equalling 25th FA Cup semi-final while seeking their 12th triumph. 

However, Boro, finalists just once, appeared to have turned the game around either side of halftime with a swivelled volley by Lee Cattermole and a header by unmarked captain George Boateng from a corner. 

Boatengs afternoon took a turn for the worse, however, when referee Rob Styles ruled he had handled Rio Ferdinands flick-on in the 67th minute. 

Boateng said of the decision: I am devastated. I cant believe it really I feel the referee has robbed us and it is painful. 

Its a natural instinct that when a shot comes in you try and protect your face and neck. 

I was not deliberately trying to handball it. The referee gave a bad decision again, said Boateng. 

Middlesbrough were worthy of the result, which may have created some kind of record as Gareth Southgates men have now required replays in every round of the competition. 

The three other quarter-finals take place on Sunday when Chelsea play Tottenham Hotspur, Blackburn Rovers host Manchester City and Plymouth Argyle take on Watford.

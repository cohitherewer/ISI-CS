 Sourav loses out to Tharanga 

 - Afro-Asia Cup 

 Captaincy split between Jayawardene, Malik as Dravid makes himself unavailable 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Dhaka: Asias captaincy for next months Afro-Asia Cup has been split, not between Indias Rahul Dravid and Sri Lankas Mahela Jayawardene, but Pakistans Shoaib Malik and Jayawardene. 

Despite the tournament being held in India (Bangalore, Chennai), Dravid made himself unavailable to stay fresh for the long tour of England. Had he been game, the captaincy would almost surely have been split between him and Jayawardene. 

Dravid routed his excuse-me request (Mentally I wont be there) through the Board of Control for Cricket in India. It was conveyed to Indias nominee on the selection panel, Chetan Chauhan, shortly before Friday mornings meeting. 

Chauhan, apparently, tried to convince Dravid to change his mind. He failed. 

That there could be different captains for the Twenty20 International (June 5) and the three ODIs (June 6, 9, 10) was reported by The Telegraph in the lead-up to the selection meeting. 

The Afro-Asia Cup is an Afro-Asian Cricket Cooperation venture. The body is headed by Sharad Pawar, who is also at the helm in India. Its hardly original, but Cricket for Unity is the tournaments theme. 

Only five Indians Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Harbhajan Singh figure in the XIV-man squad for the ODIs. Munaf Patel stands alone in the Twenty20 XI. 

Despite an excellent comeback in ODIs, Sourav Ganguly hasnt been picked. According to sources, he lost out to the younger Upul Tharanga. 

Sanath Jayasuriya has consistently done enough over the past year... He had to be there... Sourav was considered for an opening slot, but the younger Tharangas claims were eventually seen as being stronger, a source pointed out. 

Sourav wasnt selected for the inaugural edition as well, in August 2005. Indias nominee on that selection panel was the current cricket manager, Ravi Shastri. 

His (Souravs) name was discussed, but we decided to focus on a young team, Chauhan explained at the media conference. He wasnt convincing. 

Jayasuriya turns 38 next month and, so, isnt young. However, once he made himself available, Sri Lankan selector Lalith Kaluperuma had no choice but to ensure he got picked without debate. 

The question being asked is: Shouldnt Chauhan have pushed for Sourav? Unless, of course, there was a suggestion from influential quarters that the former captain had to be kept out. 

Harbhajans inclusion is interesting as he has been dropped for the ongoing tour of Bangladesh. He got the nod as Muttiah Muralidharan made himself unavailable. 

Like Murali, Kumar Sangakkara and Younis Khan werent considered as they too have County commitments. 

Pretty scandalous has been the scandal-inviting Shoaib Akhtars selection. He hasnt played for months, but got picked as he can attract crowds and TV audiences. Sponsors as well. 

Pakistans nominee (Mohsin Khan) insisted hes fit... Thats why we selected him, remarked Chauhan, who has been a national selector. 

Mohsin, for his part, said: Shoaib wasnt available for the forthcoming matches in Abu Dhabi, but told the Board he would be fit for the Afro-Asia Cup... Its after being fully convinced that I put forward his case... 

Given Shoaibs track record, though, one wonders whether Jayawardene is actually going to be delighted with his presence in the dressing room. 

Shoaibs inclusion worked against Zaheer Khan and Bangladeshs lead quick, Mashrafe Mortaza. Look, we couldnt pick everybody... Some have been adjusted in the Twenty20 XI... is how Chauhan defended himself and his colleagues. 

That adjustment got Mortaza a place in the shortest version, but it did send out an unfortunate signal: That names often do matter most. 

Indeed, Bangladesh selector A.F.M. Farooque admitted as much when he spoke of good names and famous names. 

Mortaza, however, is one of four stand-bys for the ODIs. The others are Dinesh Karthik, Shahid Afridi and another Bangladeshi, left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak. Afridi and Razzak have been selected for the Twenty20 International. 

The stand-bys havent been officially announced. 

In keeping with its commitment towards helping charities/organisations doing social work, the Afro-Asian Cricket Cooperation will donate 10 per cent of profits to Sight Savers International.

 Henry balm

London: Thierry Henry has told Arsenal fans the club can survive without him. 

An emotional Henry said: Hopefully they will do it. As soon as you know they can do it, they will forget about me, thats the way it is. 

I dont believe what everybody is saying about the club collapsing, having a lack of players and everyone leaving. I think it is untrue. (AP)

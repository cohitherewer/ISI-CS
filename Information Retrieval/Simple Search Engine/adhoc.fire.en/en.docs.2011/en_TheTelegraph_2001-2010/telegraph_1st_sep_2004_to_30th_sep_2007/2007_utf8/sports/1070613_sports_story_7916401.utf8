Calcutta: In 1996, Sourav Ganguly had scripted history in England. Eleven years later another cricketer from the state has made the cut in the England-bound Test squad. For Ranadeb Bose, the year-long struggle has finally paid-off. 

The mediumpacer is confident that his kind of bowling will suit the English conditions. I dont rely on pace and so the windy conditions there would definitely be of great help, Ranadeb said. 

Adapting to the conditions will be of the utmost importance. I will have to adapt to the conditions and make full use of the opportunity, he said. 

Coach Gopal Bose apart, the lanky pacer is eager to talk to people who have a fair idea of the conditions. 

Ranadeb will look to former India captain Sourav Ganguly and ex-Bengal coach Paras Mhambrey for some tips. I will speak to them, he said. 

Asked whether, the experience of playing club cricket in England will come in handy, the Bengal bowler said: Yes to some extent it will definitely help, but it is a different platform. 

Ranadeb has gained a lot of experience during the last few days spent at the fitness-specific camp for bowlers in Mysore. 

But for now he just wants to enjoy the moment. After a long time I am feeling really good, though the call wasnt unexpected, he rounded off.

 More backs Vengsarkar

New Delhi: The policy of rotation and giving rest to senior cricketers must be done with great care, feels former India wicketkeeper Kiran More. 

The former chief selectors comments assume significance on the backdrop of the decision to rest seniors such as Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly for the ODIs against Bangladesh. 

More, while backing chairman of selectors Dilip Vengsarkars move, said the players have to be taken into confidence. 

For tours such as Bangladesh, you have to rest top players. Someone like Sachin Tendulkar, who has been playing for so long, has to be spoken to and encouraged to look for tougher tours, the former India wicketkeeper said on Tuesday. 

Players such as Sachin and Anil Kumble have to be preserved for tougher outings because the wear and tear is more in their case, More added. (PTI)

 Injury scare for Flintoff

London: England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff is undergoing treatment for an ankle injury four days before the start of the first Test against the West Indies, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said on Monday. 

Flintoff reported some discomfort in his left ankle following the County Championship match between Lancashire and Hampshire on Saturday, the ECB said in a statement. 

He has undergone a scan and the results will be reviewed later. A further re-assessment of his injury will be made by the ECB medical team on Tuesday, prior to the teams scheduled net practice at Lords. 

Flintoff missed much of last season with ankle trouble and has twice undergone surgery. 

Meanwhile, Flintoffs booze antics in the Caribbean was not behind the decision to appoint Andrew Strauss as captain for the first Test, according to chairman of selectors David Graveney. 

It is a purely cricketing decision and I know that Peter Moores has already said that every player starts with a clean sheet. 

The pedalo incident had no relevance to this decision we were looking at Andrews current form and allowing him to focus on that, Graveney said.

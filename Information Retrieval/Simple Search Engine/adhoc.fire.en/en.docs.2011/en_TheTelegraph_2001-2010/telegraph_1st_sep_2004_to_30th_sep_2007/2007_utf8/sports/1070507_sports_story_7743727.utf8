 Rare weed-killer found in Bobs body

London: Bob Woolmer may have been poisoned with a rare weed-killer, traces of which were found on his champagne glass, according to a report in a British daily. 

The paper on Sunday quoted sources close to the Jamaica police as saying that high concentration of a herbicide was found in the murdered Pakistan coachs stomach and traces were found on the inside and outside of a glass from which he had been drinking champagne. 

Everything was contaminated the stomach content, the glass. There was enough to kill him, a source said. 

The weed-killer is so rare that the police are yet to establish whether it is available in Jamaica and they are focusing on two bottles of champagne gifted to him. One had been emptied and the other was left untouched. 

We think its something very unusual, that you cant even buy in Jamaica. We dont know what form it was in, whether liquid or crystal. 

The weed-killer was certainly in the glass. We are not sure whether it was in the bottle. Until we get further results, we cant confirm it, the source added. 

It is not known whether he shared the bottle of champagne with another person, the paper said. 

The 58-year-old Woolmer, who was cremated in Cape Town last week, was found unconscious in his Jamaica hotel room on March 18, hours after Pakistan had been shocked by Ireland and knocked out of the World Cup. 

Pervez Mir, spokesman of the Pakistan team during the World Cup, confirmed that Woolmer had received the champagne. 

I was told that somebody had brought two bottles, he said, but added that the coach was not particularly fond of champagne. 

He (Woolmer) told me he was mostly a beer drinker because he was diabetic and it suited his blood sugar, Mir said. 

Toxicologists say there are hundreds of weed-killer compounds that could be used as poison. Some have no smell or taste, are soluble in water and can cause an acute reaction within hours.

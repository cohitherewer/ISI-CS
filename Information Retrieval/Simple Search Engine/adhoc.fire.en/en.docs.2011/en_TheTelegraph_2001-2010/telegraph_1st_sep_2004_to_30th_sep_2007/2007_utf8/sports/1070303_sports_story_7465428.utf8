The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its a guarantee each of us will put his best foot forward

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 

 Sachin opens up days before his fifth World Cup appearance 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Despite the heavy demands, senior-most pro Sachin Tendulkar managed to spare some time for a one-on-one with The Telegraph. The questions, with good reason, were largely confined to the forthcoming World Cup. Incidentally, with 1,732 runs (a fantastic average of nearly 60), Sachin is the most prolific scorer in crickets showpiece event. He turns 34 next month. 

The following are excerpts 

On being days away from his fifth World Cup 

Every World Cup is huge for any cricketer Yes, theres satisfaction that Im going to make my fifth appearance. Its definitely a nice feeling Whatever happens, it will remain special. 

On whether the World Cups ninth edition is going to be his last 

Cant say I dont know whats in store for me 

On Sunil Gavaskars hope that he continues till 2011, when the World Cup returns to Asia and India 

(Laughs) As Ive said, I dont know In any case, I wouldnt like to jump four years Id rather stay focused on the World Cup which is about to begin. 

On Team Indias chances 

Wouldnt like to talk too much about what may happen Nobody can predict Putting in everything is in our hands, giving that one hundred per cent But some factors are out of our control Its a guarantee that each of us will put his best foot forward. After that, its upto the Almighty. 

On captain Rahul Dravids comment a lot of guys realise this is going to be their last (World Cup) and Im hoping they will give that extra effort 

My response is that nobody is going to be found wanting. 

On the burden-imposing expectations of a billion and more 

Frankly, its difficult to keep everyone happy Nobody should complain if the effort is there Personally, Im pleased when I know Ive done the right things Im satisfied and can then put my hand on the heart and say Ive done the best I could Doing everything for the country drives me and is a very important part of my life (After a pause) I feel fans must not become so emotional that they become irrational. 

On the Indian teams in the 1992 (his first), 1996, 1999 and 2003 World Cups 

You know I dont like making comparisons Every team has something special Has character and has its importance I wouldnt like to take anything away from any team. Doing so wouldnt be fair. 

On tips for the six Irfan Pathan, Dinesh Karthik, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Sreesanth, Munaf Patel, Robin Uthappa whore in a World Cup squad for the first time 

Well, its easy to get excited and to get carried away, but they should play normally. After all, its still cricket. 

On the 2007 World Cup being the last chapter in the Sachin Tendulkar versus Brian Lara rivalry in ODIs 

People keep projecting one rivalry or the other Over the years, Ive featured in so many, but I see rivalries as between countries. Sure, there could be a personal element, but we must not get stuck on individuals whore only part of a team. 

On the tremors across India when he opted out of the February 17 Vizag ODI (against Sri Lanka), Team Indias last big engagement before the World Cup, owing to a bad back 

I had stiffness and needed rest, there was nothing more to it The pain, thankfully, wasnt of the kind I had before the 1999 World Cup In my opinion, the Media tends to give some things more attention than they deserve. 

On what made him accept the vice-captaincy after the defeat-packed tour of South Africa 

Nothing except that I could make a contribution Obviously, the World Cup was in (the selectors) mind 

Finally, on whispers that he could take over from Dravid after the World Cup 

(Laughs again) No No No Im not getting into all that Today, my mind is on the World Cup. Thats it.

 Vaughan backs Flintoff to fire

Derek Pringle in St Johns

 England badly need World Cup points, Australia need to avenge their recent one-day defeats by the old enemy, but which will prove the more powerful motivation when the teams meet on Sunday at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium? 

Followers of English cricket know what happened when Michael Vaughans team took the Ashes off Australia in 2005. Vengeance, in the shape of a 5-0 shoeing, was brutal and absolute. But Australia, despite their unbeaten run in this World Cup, are more vulnerable in one-day cricket than in Tests, as England winning the Commonwealth Bank series revealed. 

Since the last World Cup, when Australia won in Port Elizabeth, Englands win ratio against them in one-day cricket is 46 per cent higher than against any major Test-playing opponent (discounting Bangladesh and Zimbabwe) except Pakistan, where it is 50 per cent. Essentially, as their seventh place in the rankings reveals, England are pretty poor at one-day cricket but less bad against Australia. 

Some feel Australia are apprehensive when they play the Poms at one-day cricket, though that may be because England are prepared to be less cautious than against other sides, where there is a greater expectation to succeed. Australia are clear favourites to win Sundays game and the World Cup, so Vaughans side can be afford to be bold. 

The Aussies certainly tend to bring the best from Englands captain, whose struggles with the bat on the sluggish pitches here are reaching Promethean proportions. Before he made 90 against Zimbabwe, his highest one-day score was 86 against Australia in a stirring victory in the semi-finals of the 2004 ICC Trophy. He also top-scored against them with 62 in the practice match last month, though his form since has dipped alarmingly. 

With Ed Joyce also looking out of sorts, there will be pressure to play Andrew Strauss, though that change should ideally have taken place against Sri Lanka if only to remind Strauss, who last played on February 11, what happens in the middle. There seems little logic in bringing back Strauss against a side which so thoroughly deconstructed him. But these are desperate times for England, so logic may be scrambled as Vaughan more or less admitted. 

We havent been firing at the top of the order and it is an area of concern, Vaughan said. We have an idea of where we want to go, and if Andrew Strauss gets a game on Sunday, Ill have no qualms about his lack of cricket. Sometimes a break from the game can be good mentally. Hell have a fresh mind, with no thoughts about the ball other than hitting it. 

Englands opening problems are part of wider malaise with the batting, which is not threaded together. Kevin Pietersen, Ian Bell and Paul Collingwood are getting starts but rarely going to the big score that punishes the stronger sides. England got so close to Sri Lanka only because Ravi Bopara and Paul Nixon produced some sublime batting an event unlikely to occur every day, despite the confidence banked. 

Andrew Flintoffs batting is also failing, though Vaughan claimed not to be concerned. Freddies a wonderfully instinctive batsman, and the last thing I want is for him to go into his shell and be defensive, Vaughan said. I want him to take the opposition on thats when he plays his best cricket. 

Apart from the absence of Brett Lee, one factor that could enhance Englands chances is the eight-day gap Australia have needed to fill since their last Super Eight game. Practice can keep skills and fitness levels sharp, but there is nothing like proper match cricket for keeping players fair dinkum. England experience similar deprivation when they move to Barbados on Monday, with three games in 13 days, but they need to exploit the hiatus now if they are to take more than the two points gained against Ireland with them. 

Unless they meet in the knockout stages, Sundays match could be the last time England compete against the iconic Glenn McGrath, Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden. For some players, that will be a source of relief. In 32 one-day matches against England, McGrath has taken 50 wickets, while Gilchrist has brought more than one bowler to the edge of madness with his savage hitting. 

In this tournament, Hayden has been the chief brute, powering his way to 405 runs at an average of 101.2. His recent record against Englands bowlers is not great, though something they will be keen to preserve. 

It is a big occasion, and one Ricky Pontings team will try to use to eliminate England from the World Cup. But Easter Sunday is about resurrection, and a win for Vaughans team might just start the process.

Monaco: Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso won the Monaco Grand Prix for the second year in a row on Sunday, with teammate Lewis Hamilton completing a dominant McLaren one-two. 

The Spaniards second victory of the season, and 17th of his career, took him back to the top of the Formula One championship on race wins but level on 38 points with 22-year-old rookie Hamilton. 

The Briton, runner-up for four races in a row, crossed the line four seconds behind Alonso with Ferraris Felipe Massa 69.1 seconds and almost a lap behind. The Brazilian remained third overall with 33 points. 

It was a fantastic weekend, said Alonso, who won from pole with the fastest lap, after collecting his trophy from Prince Albert. 

I have never won with more than a minute to the third guy, he added. For sure, this is the easiest and probably nicest victory so far. Its not easy to enjoy driving here, but I did thanks to a fantastic car. 

Hamilton continued his stellar start to the season with his fifth successive podium finish after repeatedly skimming the unforgiving barriers as he roared around the harbour-side circuit. 

I hit the barrier many times and I was fortunate that weve got a solid car, said the youngster, who was told to take it easy by his team in the closing laps. Its strong enough to take the hit. 

Renaults Italian Giancarlo Fisichella was fourth for the champions best result so far this year. 

McLaren extended their lead over Ferrari in the constructors standings to 20 points. 

McLaren showed a really incredible pace, said Massa. Even if I had pushed 150 per cent of the limit, we would have stayed the same in the end. Im just happy to finish on the podium. 

In an uneventful race through the metal-fenced streets, the top four followed their grid positions with Alonso champion with Renault last year lapping all but his teammate and Massa. 

Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen, watched by retired predecessor and seven-time champion Michael Schumacher, finished eighth after a costly error in qualifying forced him to start 16th at a circuit where overtaking is rare. 

The Finn remained fourth overall, 15 points adrift of the McLaren drivers. 

Polands Robert Kubica and Germanys Nick Heidfeld were fifth and sixth, respectively, for BMW Sauber. Austrian Alexander Wurz opened his tally for Williams in seventh place. The two points allowed Williams to pull clear of Toyota in fifth place. 

Only four of the 22 drivers failed to finish Toro Rossos Italian Vitantonio Liuzzi stopping on the second lap with a broken rear diffuser and Australian Mark Webber retiring with a gearbox problem in his Red Bull. Neither Spyker driver made the distance.

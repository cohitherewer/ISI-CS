 SHARP SINGLES 

 Wired-up Taufel lauds 

 ICC 

Bridgetown: Some umpires may not be liking the idea

 of being wired up to new technology at the World Cup to improve decision-making,

 but Simon Taufel the best in business feels it is money well spent. I regard it as money well spent by the ICC. I would like to see it continue, and especially in series like India against Pakistan which have huge intensity and noise around the grounds, said

 35-year-old Taufel. 

There is a dual nature to the technology and the assistance it gives to umpires. There is the functionality that allows us to hear bat on ball in noisy environment, but in addition to that, it provides digital communication between match officials. We dont get radio interference as we may have got in the past through use of walkie-talkies and the closed-loop communications network really does help with match management and clearer communication with the third umpire in the issue of referrals.

 Majola move

 Bridgetown: A report into allegations of late-night drinking within the South African World Cup camp are to be discussed between the team and management. 

Some South Africa players, who were not named, were seen on an alleged drinking spree after their defeat by New Zealand on Saturday in St Georges and fans complained to the media. CSA promised to investigate the incident and released a statement saying that chief executive Gerald Majola had received a report on the matter which would be discussed with the squad and the management before deciding on further action.

To quit or not

 St Georges: Ireland captain Trent Johnston is considering retirement from international cricket following his teams exit from the World Cup. Ireland were whipped in just over three hours by Sri Lanka on Wednesday. Many of Irelands players, including Johnston, face the prospect of returning home to regular jobs including those of postman and fitness instructor. Johnston wants to take some time out to decide on a future that may see several more players turning professional. (Agencies)

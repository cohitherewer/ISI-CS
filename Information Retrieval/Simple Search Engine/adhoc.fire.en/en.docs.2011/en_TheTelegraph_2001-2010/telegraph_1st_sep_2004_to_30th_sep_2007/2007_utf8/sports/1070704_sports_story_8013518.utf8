 ATP year-end event moves to London

London: The mens international tennis circuit will end with a prestigious final in London from 2009 under a four-year contract announced on Tuesday. 

The Masters Cup, staged in Shanghai for the last two years, is being renamed the ATP World Tour Final and is being switched to Londons O2 Arena, formerly known as the Millennium Dome. 

The worlds top eight singles players and doubles teams from the ATP Tour will compete for a prize pot of $4.5 million. Any current holder of a Grand Slam title, who is not ranked in the top eight, is also invited to participate. 

Four-time Wimbledon champion Roger Federer welcomed the venue switch, saying: I love to come to London for the (Wimbledon) championships each summer so I am delighted the end of season championships will be moving to one of my favourite cities.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tiwary check-up in England

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bengal batsman Manoj Tiwary, who underwent a surgery under Dr Andrew Wallace, will visit England once again for a post-surgery check-up. Tiwary will be in England for a post-surgery check-up by Dr Wallace on Thursday, CAB preside Prasun Mukherjee told The Telegraph on Monday. 

Mukherjee had a discussion with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Sharad Pawar over telephone and finalised Tiwarys visit. Board will bear all the expenses like the previous time, Mukherjee said. 

Tiwary, who was admitted to King Edward VII Hospital in London and was operated upon on May 23, will leave the city on Wednesday and will be back by Friday. 

The Bengal batsman injured himself during a training session in Dhaka ahead of the ODI series against Bangladesh, last May. He was forced to return and consulted Dr Anant Joshi in Mumbai. However, he was later referred to Dr Wallace. 

Meanwhile, according to a source, former Bengal batsman Snehasish Ganguly is set to be one of the assistant secretaries while the other hasnt been decided yet. Aloke Nandy, who still has one year left in his term, is unlikely to continue and may be replaced by V. Kumar. Its not confirmed but we are still thinking whether to retain Nandy or bring someone new, the source revealed.

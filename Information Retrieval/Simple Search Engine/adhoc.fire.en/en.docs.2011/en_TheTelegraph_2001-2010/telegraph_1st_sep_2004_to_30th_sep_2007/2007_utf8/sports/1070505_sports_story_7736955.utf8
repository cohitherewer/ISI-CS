 AC Milan older, but Liverpool wiser

 - Theres no escaping that the Italians face a tougher task in Athens than they did in Istanbul 

 Gabriele Marcotti 

Second chances are rare in football and AC Milan know 

 fully well that they were handed one this week. I 

 know I am supposed to say that Istanbul is long forgotten 

 and this game has nothing to do with what happened two years 

 ago, Gennaro Gattuso, the Milan midfielder, said. 

 But its not true. It was not easy to come to 

 terms with what happened and this is a chance to put things 

 right. 

AC Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi was more emphatic. Were going to Athens to take back the Champions League, a cup which we simply gifted to Liverpool when it was already safe and sound in our trophy cabinet, he said. 

While the atmosphere in the Milan camp is bullish, there is no escaping that this team face a tougher task in Athens than they did in Istanbul. Liverpool have grown under Rafael Bentez. 

At the same time, while the Rossoneris style, approach and personnel have largely remained the same, there is no escaping the fact that the team is two years older and, for some, the passage of time has taken its toll. 

Two seasons ago Dida, the Brazil goalkeeper, appeared to be at the height of his power, drawing comparisons to Gianluigi Buffon of Italy and Petr Cech of Chelsea and the Czech Republic. 

Today he is the epitome of inconsistency, equally liable to produce a dramatic blunder or a show-stopping save. 

At right back, Massimo Oddo is a natural replacement for Cafu, who at 36 plays a bit-part role. Oddo provides plenty of energy and a cultured right foot, although in terms of charisma and experience he cannot match his predecessor. 

Alessandro Nesta remains the rock of the defence and, back to full fitness, looks sharper and quicker than he did in 2005. 

His partner in Istanbul was Jaap Stam; in Athens it will be Paolo Maldini, who, at 38, will be playing in his eighth final. 

While it may be churlish to question a living legend such as Maldini, the team was more solid with Stam, particularly because injuries have slowed the Milan captain. 

Marek Jankulovski is likely to line up on the left, the position Maldini filled in Istanbul. The main difference here is the way the players interpret the position. 

Jankulovski is an adjunct winger who loves to get forward, whereas the Maldini seen in Istanbul was almost a third central defender. 

Tactically, Milan is different in midfield and attack. Two years ago they played 4-3-1-2, with Kak sitting behind Andriy Shevchenko and HernCrespo. 

Today it is 4-3-2-1, with the Brazilian and Clarence Seedorf pushed up in support of a lone striker either Alberto Gilardino or Filippo Inzaghi and an additional holding midfield player, Massimo Ambrosini. 

It may look more conservative, but it allows the full backs to get forward more than before. 

Kak is better than he was in 2004-05. Seedorf and Gattuso have had excellent campaigns and remain at the peak of their powers, whereas Andrea Pirlo appears to have dipped. 

Comparing Ambrosini (who was suspended for the Istanbul final) and Shevchenko is impossible they play in different positions. 

But it is clear that whereas Ambrosini is a precious cog in the machine, Shevchenko was the inspirational goalscorer the team now lack. 

Up front, the 2005 version have a clear edge thanks to Crespo. 

Gilardino has struggled to score this season and has been forced to make do with being the workhorse lone striker. 

 Inzaghi, 33, is not a regular any more, although he 

 can provide the odd spark off the bench. 

 While the ethos of the team remains 

 the same keep possession, commit men forward, impose the 

 short passing game the impression is that Milan were a 

 superior team two years ago. Of course, if they overcome 

 Liverpool, no one will remember (or care).

 Guwahati likely to host Pak ODI now 

Mumbai: The Indian cricket board wants minor changes in the itineraries of the forthcoming tours by Australia in September-October and the subsequent visit by Pakistan in November-December. 

The changes have been necessitated following the desire of the Haryana Cricket Association to host the ODI against Pakistan at Chandigarh instead of the originally scheduled Faridabad, board secretary Niranjan Shah said. 

As per the programme finalised at the boards working committee meeting in New Delhi earlier this month, the fourth ODI against Australia was to be held on October 8 in Guwahati. 

Shah said that as per the changes mooted, this match could be moved to Chandigarh in which case Guwahati would get to host the ODI against Pakistan, scheduled for November 6 at Faridabad. (PTI)

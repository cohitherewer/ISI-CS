 Tottenham bid for Mourinho

Jeremy Wilson

Tottenham offered to match Jose Mourinhos 5.2 million-a-year salary at Chelsea in an attempt to lure him to White Hart Lane. 

It is understood that Spurs chairman Daniel Levy made several direct attempts to contact Mourinhos representatives on Thursday, just hours after his departure from Chelsea had been confirmed. 

However, Mourinhos severance package with Chelsea includes a clause which prevents him from joining another Premier League club this season, meaning Martin Jol can sleep a little easier in the knowledge that another potential replacement for his Tottenham job is unavailable. 

Tottenham were last night forced to deny that they had made any offer and insisted that Jol retained the support of the club. We have a manager and that is who Daniel has given his support to, said a club spokeswoman. Nobody else has been spoken to about the managers position. 

Jols position has been the subject of intense scrutiny this season after a Tottenham delegation were photographed in the same hotel as Sevilla coach Juande Ramos. 

Mourinho shed his first tears of a tumultuous week Friday when his children left their school in London as the Special One prepared for a new challenge. 

After struggling with the internal politics at Chelsea for much of the past year, Mourinho signalled his relief that his time at Stamford Bridge had ended and also gave the clearest indication yet of his involvement in the decision to leave. 

Sources in Portugal say his final pay-off was just under 17 million. Mourinhos agent was quoted as saying that there had already been an offer from a serious European club and interest from the Portuguese national team.

 Injured Sania withdraws

Doha: Sania Mirza on Wednesday pulled out of the Qatar Open due to a knee injury, announcing the decision just before her second-round match against Ukraines Kateryna Bondarenko. 

The 20-year-old had sustained the injury during her win against Italys Romina Oprandi on Monday. Sania will undergo a scan after returning to Hyderabad on Thursday. 

Top seed Justine Henin shrugged off a determined challenge from Australias Alicia Molik to reach the quarter finals with a 6-2 ,7-6 win. 

The Belgian was joined in the last eight by seeds Svetlana Kuznetsova, Patty Schnyder and Francesca Schiavone. 

Fifth seed Schnyders reward for a 6-3, 6-4 win over Spains Anabel Medina Garrigues was a date with Henin. 

Kuznetsova, a 7-5, 6-1 winner over Germanys Julia Georges, will next face Schiavone. 

Schiavone, seeded eighth, was made to work hard against Mara Santangelo before her opponent quit with a left wrist injury while trailing 4-6, 7-6, 1-0. (Agencies)

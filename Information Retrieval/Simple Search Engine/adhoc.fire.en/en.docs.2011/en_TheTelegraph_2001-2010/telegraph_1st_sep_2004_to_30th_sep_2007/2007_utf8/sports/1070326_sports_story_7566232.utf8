 Martin replaces Tuffey; injury blow to Vincent

Port of Spain: New Zealand have been given permission by International Cricket Council to replace injured seamer Daryl Tuffey with Chris Martin at the World Cup. But at the same time the team on Sunday received another jolt in the form of Lou Vincent. 

According to the team, the opener suffered a suspected broken wrist in the nets. Spokesman John Durning said he had been taken to hospital and that the extent of the injury would become clear when Vincent returns to the team hotel. 

New Zealand, who won three group C games out of three to reach the Super Eight, have suffered several injuries to their squad. 

Tuffey has been ruled out of the tournament with a right bicep problem. Martin replaced his fellow fast bowler after medical reports indicated that Tuffey suffered a serious injury to his right bicep during the Black Caps 114-run win against Canada in St Lucia on Thursday.

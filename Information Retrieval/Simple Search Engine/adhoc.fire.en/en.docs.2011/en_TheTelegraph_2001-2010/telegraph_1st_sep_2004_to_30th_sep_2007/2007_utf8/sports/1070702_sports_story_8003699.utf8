 Jyoti ends tied seventh

Versailles: Indias Jyoti Randhawa bounced back brilliantly to finish tied 7th at the Open de France Alstom on Sunday. Randhawa, who had slipped to tied 11th in the third round, finished ahead of Jeev Milkha Singh. 

Asian Tours No.1 in 2006, Jeev ended on a disappointing note at tied 12th, down from tied fifth after Round III. 

Britains Graeme Storm won the title by a shot from Denmarks overnight leader Soren Hansen after starting out five strokes behind. 

The former British Amateur champion became the European Tours 14th first time winner of the season as he closed with a five under 66 for a seven-under 277 total. 

Eight-time European No.1 Colin Montgomerie led with four holes to go but two late bogeys left the Scot in a share of third place. (AGENCIES)

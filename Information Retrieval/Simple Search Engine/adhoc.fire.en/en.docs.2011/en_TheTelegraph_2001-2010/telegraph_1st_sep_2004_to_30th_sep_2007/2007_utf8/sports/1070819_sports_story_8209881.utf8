 Flintoff mentally fresh for ODIs

 London: Englands star allrounder Andrew Flintoff has said he was feeling mentally fresh after his long injury lay-off as he is set to return for the upcoming one-day series against India. 

I believe the injury could actually help extend my career because I feel mentally very fresh, Flintoff said and added his best years were still ahead. 

I wont be playing when Im 50 but Im only 29 and theres a lot left in me. I hope my best years are ahead of me, he was quoted as saying by a British newspaper. Flintoff missed the Test series against India as he was recovering from surgery on his troublesome left ankle in May. 

He also regretted the setback at the World Cup. 

For two or three years, most things went the way I wanted. But Ive had some setbacks with injury, losing the Ashes, struggling in the World Cup and even the pedalo business. 

But I really feel I can get better. My bowling is improving and Ive been working hard on my batting. 

The ankle feels great. The operation was something I needed and everyone is pleased with what Ive been able to do since, Flintoff said. (PTI)

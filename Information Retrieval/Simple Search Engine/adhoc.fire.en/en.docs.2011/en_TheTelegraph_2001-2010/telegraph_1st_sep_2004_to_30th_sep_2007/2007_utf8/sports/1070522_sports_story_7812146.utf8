 Real cling to top spot 

Madrid: Real Madrid held on to the leadership of the Primera Liga by the skin of their teeth after a last-gasp 3-2 win over Recreativo Huelva on Sunday. 

Recreativo fought back from 0-2 to level at 2-2 with five minutes to go, but Roberto Carlos scored in injury time. 

Barcelona bounced back with a 6-0 destruction of Atletico Madrid, to inflict a heaviest-ever home league defeat on the Rojiblancos.

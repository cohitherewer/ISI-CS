Bangalore: Former India captain and senior pro Sourav Ganguly will be Asias vice-captain during the three-match (second) Afro-Asia Cup, which gets underway here on Wednesday. 

Ironically, Sourav hadnt even been picked in the original XIV. He only made it as a replacement for Sachin Tendulkar. The maestro withdrew for personal reasons. 

Asias selectors didnt name a vice-captain when they chose the squad some three weeks ago, but captain Mahela Jayawardene suggested that Sourav be anointed the No. 2. 

Mahela said that he would like Sourav to take charge if he happened to go off the field... Being the vice-captain, Sourav would also then be part of the selection committee during the tournament, Asian Cricket Council chief executive officer Syed Ashraful Huq told The Telegraph. 

Sourav, it may be recalled, had been Asias captain during the high-profile tsunami fund-raiser at the MCG, in January 2005. Seven months later, however, he wasnt found good enough for the inaugural Afro-Asia Cup. 

Edition No.2, of course, marks Souravs return to limited overs cricket: Hed been rested for the three ODIs in Bangladesh. 

Its not exactly going to be a comeback, still... Ive always enjoyed ODIs... Its nice that Ive got an opportunity, Sourav remarked, adding that hed been touched by Jayawardenes gesture. 

Asias manager Sultan Rana, meanwhile, arrived in the early hours of Tuesday. On Sunday night, hed been deported to Kuala Lumpur for no fault of his. 

I didnt make an issue of the incident then and wouldnt like to make one now, Rana, who was humiliated because of an error on the part of the Indian high commission in Kuala Lumpur, maintained. 

Hes a Pakistani passport-holder.

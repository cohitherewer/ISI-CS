 Becks back in fold and raring to go

 - Former England captain likely to start in friendly international vs Brazil

 David Beckham 

David Beckham was back in an England shirt Monday for the first time since limping out of the World Cup quarter final against Portugal in Gelsenkirchen 330 days ago. It was only a training top, but it still bore the three lions that he must have feared would never adorn his pectorals again short of calling in at a sports shop on the way to Los Angeles. 

Recalled to the England squad, Beckham was surrounded once again by a host of familiar and mostly friendly faces from the World Cup squad in Germany when he wore the captains arm-band. 

He finished on the winning side in a ten-a-side game as a probables team beat the possibles in the first training session before Englands friendly international against Brazil at Wembley on Friday. To judge from the line-ups, Beckham is likely to start on the right of a midfield four with Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Joe Cole. 

However, Rio Ferdinand was absent and will miss that match and in all probability, also the European Championship qualifying tie against Estonia in Tallinn with a recurrence of the groin injury that he first suffered in the FA Cup semi-final against Watford last month. 

The Manchester United defender is expected to have a scan, but the prognosis is unpromising. 

Jamie Carragher played alongside John Terry in defence Monday and would be the logical choice to deputise for Ferdinand in both matches, with Ledley King of Tottenham Hotspur more likely to feature as an understudy for Owen Hargreaves, if a holding midfield player is required. Nicky Shorey, of Reading, lined up at left back but Wayne Bridge was doing some light running with Gary Lewin, the physio, and is expected to be available. 

In the absence of any comment from players or coaching staff, speculation was the order of the day. 

How significant was it that Beckham was one of the last off the team coach? Was it a deliberately low-key entrance, so as not to risk upstaging Terry, his successor as England captain? Or was he simply trying to stay out of the cold rain and biting wind for as long as possible? 

As the players warmed up in front of an invited audience of about 50 competition winners and about the same number of photographers at Arsenals headquarters in London Colney, one wondered whether some of the players who were rumoured to be less than pleased at the return of Beckham, may be tempted to make their feelings known in subtle ways - a hospital pass here, an overzealous challenge there. Did Lampard, for example, leave his foot in a challenge a fraction longer than normal in a keep-ball exercise? 

Beckham had no opportunity to demonstrate his prowess with free kicks and corners, and he also kept the so-called Hollywood passes to a minimum. The two long crossfield passes he tried on the narrow pitch went out for throw-ins, but he could claim a partial assist in the only goal. The former England captain swept the ball out to the left for Michael Owen, whose cross was converted by Alan Smith, surprisingly preferred to Peter Crouch and Jermain Defoe in the first team. 

Owen was energetic on his return to the full squad after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament in the match against Sweden at the World Cup, even though Newcastle Uniteds share price was in the balance with every twist, turn and robust challenge. 

Meanwhile, Fifa was looking out for Beckhams interests by insisting that the Los Angeles Galaxy must allow him to play in all England matches if selected, even if they clash with club fixtures. 

Alexi Lalas, the Galaxy general manager, had suggested that Beckham would be released only for competitive matches after he joins the club in July, but the world governing body mandates that players must be free to play for their countries. 

The same rules apply for everybody, a Fifa spokesman said. For all national associations, for any club, for any player. Players must be released for friendly or competitive games if they are on the international calendar and the required notice is given.

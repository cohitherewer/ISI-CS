 Batting with Sourav always a pleasure

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Chittagong: Sachin Tendulkar said batting with Sourav Ganguly is always a great pleasure and that they keep exchanging ideas and encouraging each other to stay focussed. 

The senior pros stitched together a 189-run stand against Bangladesh in the first Test, before perishing immediately after their centuries here on Saturday. The fourth-wicket stand bettered their own record against the same opponents (164) in Dhaka in 2004. 

We have been playing together for over a decade and its been a pleasure to bat with Sourav. He is a wonderful player and its fun in the middle, Sachin said after India finished Day II on 384 for six. 

We enjoyed our partnership. The idea was not to get bogged down. We remained focused. The conditions were tough, so we tried to keep each other going by encouraging each other, added the batting maestro, now the owner of 36 Test centuries. 

Sourav expressed relief and satisfaction over his 13th hundred. Speaking exclusively, he said: Its always good to score a big knock. I was looking to convert a good start into a century. 

Sachin denied he was out to prove a point or two. 

Under pressure following the first-round World Cup exit and having been rested from the ODI series, Team Indias seniormost pro made it clear the century had come at the right time, but it was not meant to answer his critics. 

Scoring a hundred is always a happy feeling. I was looking forward to playing such an important innings. But after playing for 17 years, I dont think I have anything to prove, he said, dismissing any immediate plans of retirement. 

Dedicating the knock to his father Friday was his eighth death anniversary Sachin admitted it had been an emotional ride for him following the teams debacle in the Caribbean. 

We were disappointed after our World Cup performance. Not because people demonstrated their anger at home or elsewhere, but because the ultimate dream was to go out there and play well. When you fail to achieve the biggest goal, it always hurts. 

My family has always been with me. The people close to me were disappointed too... My friends, brother, mother, wife and kids... spending time with them in troubled times helped. 

Nobody wants to go out there and not perform, everyone wants to win. When it does not happen, its tough to overcome the disappointment, the maestro signed off.

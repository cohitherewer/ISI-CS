New Delhi: A month before Ricky Ponting arrives in India with his team for an ODI series, Zaheer Khan after his dazzling display in England has become the subject of research for the Australians, revealed their pace spearhead Brett Lee. 

The Australians will be in India for playing seven ODIs starting September 29 and Lee felt Zaheer would be a big threat to their aim of a series sweep. 

We have been watching him very closely and I must say that he has done amazingly well in England. In fact we are doing a bit of research on him, Lee, who is in the capital for a promotional told reporters Tuesday. 

Zaheer won the Man of the Series award in the recently concluded Test series after picking up 16 wickets. 

I am very impressed with his determination. He has tremendous control over the ball and it looks he has worked very hard after being on the sidelines for some time. 

But ultimately its all about putting the ball into the right areas and he has been doing it with consistency. Considering that he was not even in the team till some months ago, his comeback is just great. 

Lee, who will return to the field in next months Twenty20 World Championship after being sidelined by an ankle injury in February, said although the stars of the Indian team were now on the wrong side of 30s, they would still be a handful for the Aussies. 

I dont think that age would have any effect on the likes of (Sachin) Tendulkar, (Sourav) Ganguly, (Rahul) Dravid or VVS Laxman. These guys never let anything affect them when they are playing against us. 

They have this knack of coming up with their best when they play Australia. Well have to be wary of that, he said. 

On the upcoming ICC World Twenty20 championship, Lee felt South Africa and England would start favourites as these sides have had the most experience of playing the shortest form of the game. 

South Africa and England are favourites because they are more experienced. I think we also have good chance but we have not been exposed to Twenty20 much and it would be a challenge adapting to the format, he said. 

And we are taking the whole thing very seriously. After all, it is a world championship. As a bowler, I know it would be hard on me but I am preparing myself. I think 40 runs in four overs shouldnt be too bad, he said. 

Despite Twenty20 being hard on the bowlers, Lee said he was all for the format as it would popularise the game. 

Twenty20 has lot of merit. It lasts barely four hours. It is entertaining for the crowd and children are not going to get sunburn if they turn up at the stadium, he remarked. (PTI)

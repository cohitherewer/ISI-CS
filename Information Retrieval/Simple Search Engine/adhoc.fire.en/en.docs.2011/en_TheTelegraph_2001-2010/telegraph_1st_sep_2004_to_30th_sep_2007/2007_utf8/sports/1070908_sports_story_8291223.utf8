 Chidi hattrick in Dempo win

Ludhiana: Chidi Edeh scored a splendid hattrick to help Dempo earn a 3-0 win over United SC and move into the quarter finals of the 29th Federation Cup here on Friday. 

The burly Nigerian struck in the 39th, 80th and 84th minutes as the Goan outfit dominated the match throughout. 

The scoreline, however, appears a bit harsh on the Calcutta club who created some fine moves even though they lacked the cutting edge in their attack. Dulal Biswas was their best player. 

Chidi, who had spent the last season in JCT before moving to Dempo this year, was cheered by the small crowd at the Guru Nanak Stadium. 

The National Football League champions took the lead with a move involving two of their foreign stars. 

A through pass from Brazilian Roberto Silva caught the United defence off guard and sent Chidi marching onto the goal. Sensing danger, custodian Somnath Khara left his line but Chidi kept his composure and found the net. 

Apart from that setback, there was little to suggest in the first half that United were overmatched. 

Meanwhile, in the other match, Churchill Brothers hammered newly promoted Salgaocar 4-1 to qualify for the quarter finals to face Dempo. Stepen N. Mbanyam scored twice in the 34th and 87th minute for Churchill while Robert Lalthlamvana and Odafe Okolie added to the tally. For Salgaocar Badamos Babatunde scored the consolation goal in the 14th minute.

 Jeev five shots off leader

DAMON HACK

 Augusta: The last red number at Augusta National Golf Club fell at 6:34 p.m., sending the Masters to a place it has never been. 

As a frigid day crossed into chilly night, white scoreboards highlighted an Australian named Stuart Appleby chasing a countrys first Masters title and the imposing figure of Tiger Woods chasing him. 

After a third consecutive day of taxing conditions, Appleby shot a one-over-par 73 on Saturday to take a one-shot lead over Woods and Justin Rose at two-over 218. Applebys total was the highest to lead a third round in the history of the Masters. The previous high was even-par 216, set in 1966. 

Trailing Appleby by two shots were Padraig Harrington, with a 75, Zach Johnson, who shot 76, and the Augusta native Vaughn Taylor, with a 77. Bradley Dredge, who shot 76, stood three shots back. Phil Mickelson, with a 73, was four shots behind. 

Woods, seeking his fifth Masters title and third consecutive major championship, carded an even-par 72 the second-best score of the day despite bogeying the final two holes. Retief Goosen shot the best round of the day, a 70, in temperatures that never left the low 50s. 

[Meanwhile, debutant Jeev Milkha Singh shot a 76 that looked certain to be much better before he ran into unexpected late double bogey on the 15th, adds PTI. At the end of the day, he had totalled 223, which was only five shots off the leader Appleby. The Indian was placed tied 16th, a position, if he maintains, will guarantee a return to the Masters next year. 

My course management was good today except for one hole. Thats alright, I made one mistake. I am human, I am allowed to do that, said Jeev. 

It was a tough day, one of the hardest of my career. I was going well and the only mistake I made was on the 15th. I got too cute with the third shot and I paid for it with a seven. I was trying to play for the middle of the green but I just tried to fly it in and it rolled back into the water. It was the mistake of the tournament so far, the Indian added.] 

Woods, despite his late errors, earned a spot in the final group, from which the winner has come in the past 16 Masters. In each of his 12 major victories, however, he has never come from behind to win. He will share the stage with Appleby, an occasional practice partner in Orlando, where they live, and frequent Presidents Cup opponent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Reserve bench 

 has to be excellent

 - The flamboyant Mohsin Khan on Pakistan cricket 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 A Telegraph Special

 Mohsin Khan 

 Dhaka: Mohsin Hasan Khans 

 filmstar-like looks made the women drool each time he entered 

 the field Reena Roy was one to be bowled over completely. 

 He was, of course, a dashing opener too and is credited 

 with very fine Test hundreds in, among other centres, Adelaide 

 and Melbourne. Plus, he scripted a double hundred at Lords. 

 Mohsin, who played 48 Tests and 75 ODIs in almost a decade 

 from 1977, has served as coach and manager of the A teams 

 and colts outfits as well.

 In town as Pakistans nominee 

 (actually, Majid Khans replacement) on the Asian selection 

 panel, the Karachi-based Mohsin spoke to The Telegraph 

 for almost an hour on Thursday.

 The following are 

 excerpts

 On Pakistani cricket regularly 

 being in the headlines for wrong reasons

 But other countries also have 

 problems... My opinion is that things get magnified in Pakistan... 

 It doesnt help when people whore out of the 

 Board start criticising the very things they themselves 

 encouraged when in power.

 On Pakistans first-round 

 exit from the World Cup

 We went out because we didnt 

 play well... People shouldnt attribute other reasons. 

 The problem is that everybody is so passionate in the subcontinent... 

 We dont just love, but adore... That has drawbacks... 

 Im convinced things would be far better and the players 

 under less pressure if people were less emotional.

 On whether an obsession with 

 religion contributed to the disaster

 Rubbish... Not at all... Did anybody 

 stop batting or bowling to offer prayers in the middle? 

 In fact, being religious has positives... If I was the captain, 

 Id much rather have players with a religious bent 

 of mind than those who may have damaging distractions. As 

 Ive said, we lost because we werent good enough.

 On whether Inzamam-ul Haq ought 

 to quit completely

 Its a personal thing... 

 Hes confident that he could be around for a couple 

 of years... That he still has a contribution to make in 

 Test cricket. My thoughts on that are irrelevant.

 On whether new captain Shoaib 

 Malik could feel uncomfortable with Inzy in the dressing 

 room

 Im sure such a situation 

 wont arise.

 On Malik being preferred over 

 the more experienced Mohammed Yousuf

 I dont have much of an opinion... 

 Im neither happy, nor am I unhappy...

 On Imran Khans view that 

 Younis Khan ought not to have accepted the vice-captaincy 

 if he didnt want to be captain

 Is Imran aware of the circumstances 

 in which Younis refused to lead? I doubt it... Imran tends 

 to comment without having gone into details... Its 

 obvious that Younis had good reasons.

 On the path-breaking appointment 

 of paid selectors

 Its an excellent move... 

 Now, there will be accountability and selectors wont 

 turn around and say they cant travel here or cant 

 go and watch X match there... The Board needs to be complimented.

 On the other changes he would 

 like

 Oh, Pakistan must have an excellent 

 reserve bench... Ideally, there should be two challengers 

 for everybody who is in the XI... The Australians 

 bench strength is enviable... We must work towards achieving 

 the same degree of healthy competition. A lack of competition 

 breeds complacency.

 On who is best suited to take 

 the vacant coachs chair

 Its difficult to list the 

 best, but I feel we should have a Pakistani... Im 

 not in favour of foreigners, for theyre largely driven 

 by the handsome remuneration. Moreover, can a coach from 

 overseas ever have the passion which a Pakistani would have?

 On whether the profile of a 

 coach is important

 No... Look at Greg Chappells 

 tenure with your team... Everybody knows he was a great 

 batsman indeed, he was one of my idols, the other being 

 Majid but failed as a coach... Somebody like John Buchanan, 

 on the other hand, did a great job... No one had heard of 

 him when he got appointed (in late 1999), but he guided 

 Australia to World Cup wins in succession...

 On the role coaches play at 

 the highest level

 We didnt have coaches... 

 Hanif Mohammed didnt have a coach... Sunil Gavaskar 

 didnt have a coach... At the international level, 

 a coach is only needed to toughen players in the mind... 

 Its a mental game and the mental side has to be taken 

 care of. Of course, lets be clear no coach has a magic 

 wand.

 On the late Bob Woolmer

 Its sad that were 

 talking of somebody who is no more... Bob was a good coach 

 and got along with his players. He once told me they were 

 like his children and I know that the players liked him. 

 Some even saw him as a father-figure.

 On the Pakistan team being 

 treated as suspects by the Jamaica police

 Investigations have to follow 

 a procedure... Theres no need for anybody to get offended.

 On Pakistans problems 

 with the opening pair

 (Laughs) Weve tried 

 far too many combinations in the last couple of years... 

 The selectors ought to have given Salman Butt and Imran 

 Farhat more opportunities... Perhaps, even Yasir Hameed 

 and Mohammed Hafeez... The more you chop and change, the 

 bigger the problem. More than the players concerned, frequent 

 changes dont reflect well on selectors.

 Finally, on whether hes 

 going to lobby hard for the Pakistani players during Fridays 

 meeting to pick the Asian XIV

 No... Ive come to help select 

 the Asian team... Im aware of my responsibilities. 

 Because of the competition, some good players are bound 

 to be left out. But, then, thats the name of the game.

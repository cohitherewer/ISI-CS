 Kapur, Jeev slip

Doha: Jeev Milkha Singh and Shiv Kapur had a bad day in office and slipped down to tied 26th place on the third day of the Commercial Bank Qatar Masters golf. 

It was the kind of a day Jeev would like to forget in a hurry as he shot three-over 75 and had compatriot Kapur (72) for company. 

Meanwhile, there was a three-way tie for the lead with Retief Goosen (71) and two left-handers Richard Green (71) and Nick Hern (69) all placed at 12-under 204 after contrasting finishes.

 Malinga doubtful against Australia

St Georges: Injured fast bowler Lasith Malinga is doubtful for Sri Lankas Super Eight match against Australia on Monday. I dont know whether we will risk him against Australia, he is doubtful for that match, Sri Lankan team manager Michael Tessera said on Friday. It may be better to keep him for the game against Ireland (on Wednesday). 

Tessera said Malinga was on the mend. He was walking around this morning and he is feeling much better. We will have to assess him in practice and take it from there. 

Australian skipper Ricky Ponting, meanwhile, is contemplating bringing injured Shane Watson back into the side for the semi-finals even without a fitness test. (AgeNcies)

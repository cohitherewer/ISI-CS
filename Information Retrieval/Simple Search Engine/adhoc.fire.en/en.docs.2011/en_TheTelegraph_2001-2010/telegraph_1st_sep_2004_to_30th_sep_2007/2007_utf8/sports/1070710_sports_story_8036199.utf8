The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pro League opener may be in Barasat 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Barasat may host the inaugural match of the Professional League on September 30. 

The AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco, who on Monday paid a visit to the stadium on the outskirts of the city, expressed satisfaction with the facilities. 

The fixtures are yet to be decided. Also, the AIFF executive committee (which will meet in Delhi on July 20) has to clear the way for Barasat to hold the inaugural match, Colaco said, who also hoped that floodlights would be installed at the stadium by September. 

The launch of the much-anticipated league is still over two months away, but Colacos visit to the city reflected the familiar organisational mess. 

Mohun Bagan went unrepresented in both meetings the AIFF official held with the local organisers. The government officials also gave them a miss. 

Colaco refused to comment on the issue, but the IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly admitted it was an organisational failure. 

The Professional League which may be called I-League, a la J-League will be non-operational from December 1 to 22 because of the SAFF Cup.

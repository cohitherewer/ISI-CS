 TFA hopes to strike deal with Sao Paulo

SREEMOY TALUKDAR

Jamshedpur: The Tata Football Academy (TFA) is in talks with Brazilian outfit Sao Paulo for a player exchange programme that may push Indian soccers arterial supply line to a next level. 

Apart from the Brazilian powerhouse, the TFA is also holding discussions with two UK-based clubs, Arsenal and Southampton, for a tie-up that is likely to see collaboration in the areas of sports medicine, training facilities and coach exchange programme. 

Sao Paulo took major interest in our model of functioning when they visited Jamshedpur this year for the Super Soccer match. They offered support in various infrastructural areas including foreign exposure for our cadets, A.N. Singh, Tata Steel deputy managing director, said to a group of visiting reporters. 

TFA chief Satish Pillai had earlier flown to Southampton to initiate a similar agreement. 

However, a new management is at the helm of Southampton since our visit and we are holding a fresh round of talks. Though it is still at a nascent stage, we expect an MoU within the next three-four months, Singh said, adding Arsenals junior training programme is also something which we are looking at with great interest. 

If the deal goes through, TFA, which has emerged as the major contributor of fresh talent to Indian soccer, will be sending two-three cadets each year to these clubs, he said. 

The academy saw 11 of its boys figure in under-23 squad who played against Thailand in the Olympic qualifier in Bangkok recently. 

The TFA, whose cadets include former Indian captains Aloke Das, Carlton Chapman, Deepak Mondal, Rennedy Singh and Kalyan Choubey, has also lined up a new recruitment policy. 

With national coach Bob Houghton placing a great deal of emphasis on players of good height, the TFA, which has seen 92 of its 129 cadets so far representing India, has decided to recruit boys with a minimum height of 5feet-8inches and a body weight of 52 kgs. 

According to coach Ranjan Chowdhury, aptitude and IQ tests have now been made mandatory for the cadets to be inducted into its residential complex spread across 25,000 square feet. 

But the TFA bosses sounded diplomatic on whether they would want the AIFF to adopt a more pro-active role. 

A case in point is that Houghton never found time to visit the academy. 

It is not for us to say what the AIFF should do... They have been supportive in their own way. But we would definitely like to have better coordination with them, Singh said.

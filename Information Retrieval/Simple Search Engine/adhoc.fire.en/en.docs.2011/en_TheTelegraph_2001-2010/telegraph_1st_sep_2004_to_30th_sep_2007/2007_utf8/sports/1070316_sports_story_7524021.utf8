 Moody does a Ponting now

 Tom Moody

Port of Spain: After Ricky Ponting, former Australian allrounder and current Sri Lanka coach Tom Moody has also dubbed India bad travellers. 

According to Moody, India are a formidable side at home but they are not the same force abroad and he said his wards are looking forward to their critical Group B clash against Rahul Dravids men next week. 

Its another game of cricket in the Caribbean. Playing India in India, as every cricketing person knows, is different from playing India outside India. So we are looking forward to playing them at a neutral venue, remarked Moody on Wednesday. 

India had completely dominated the Lankans in a home series prior to coming to the West Indies, securing a 2-1 margin even though Chaminda Vaas and Muthiah Muralidharan were missing in the Lankan line-up. 

We are in the Caribbean now. The conditions and the environment here are so different. This is what counts and not what had happened in India. Moody argued. 

Ponting had said on Sunday: India is a dangerous side and has improved noticeably from the time when it was performing badly and the current coach (Greg Chappell) was being much criticised. But we are also not forgetting their negatives as bad travellers. 

Both India and Sri Lanka would be keen to win Group Bs final clash next Friday since the teams would carry over the point from the group level to the Super Eight stage. 

Moody, while rating his side as a strong contender for the World Cup, stressed that depth in batting and versatility could well make the difference among the teams in the competition. 

He also batted for the minnows and did not rule out major upsets. 

There are pretty good teams out there. Bangladesh are a side that have beaten top teams, including us, in the past. Scotland, Ireland, Kenya are decent sides, so I am sure every nation that consider itself in the top bracket will be very much on their toes when they play these minnows, he said.

 BCCI satisfied with replies

 New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Sunday said it was satisfied with the explanation of Sachin Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh for their remarks about ex-coach Greg Chappell but warned all players against speaking to the media directly in the future. 

The BCCI said it had gone through the letters of the two players in reply to the show cause notices issued to them and will now consider the matter as closed. 

We have received the replies of Sachin Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh. The replies are satisfactory and the chapter is now closed, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah told reporters in Rajkot. 

In future if any player speaks to the media, he will be given notice by the board. Every player should remember that the game is more important than individuals, he said. 

The BCCI, in its working committee meeting on April 7, had decided to issue showcause notices to Sachin and Yuvraj for breaching the code of conduct. 

Sachins showcause issue had come up for discussion at the managing committee meeting of the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) Friday evening with its vice-president and national selection panel chairman Dilip Vengsarkar supporting the master batsman.

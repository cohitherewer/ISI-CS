Calcutta: Ranadeb Bose is on a roll. If his 10-wicket match-haul against Hyderabad was not enough, he issued another reminder ahead of the national selectors naming the World Cup probables. 

Against Rajasthan in their concluding Ranji Trophy Super League tie at the Eden on Wednesday, the Bengal mediumpacer claimed six for 34 as he and Sourav Sarkar (four for 78) dismissed the visitors for 193. At stumps on Day I, the hosts were firmly placed on 80 for one. 

Ranadeb, with 37 scalps, is the second highest wicket-taker in the competition so far. His 13th five-wicket Ranji haul and fourth this season was the result of some controlled and disciplined bowling that put the Rajasthan batsmen in disarray. Utilising the morning dew and fair sprinkling of grass on the wicket, he got the ball to move both ways and preyed on batsmens weaknesses. 

It was scintillating stuff as he stuck to a line and the batsmen were left clueless. Having gone wicketless in his first spell, Ranadeb switched ends to reap the rewards. Despite being on a hattrick twice, he could not pull it off. 

For someone who has developed himself in the Jason Gillespie mould, Ranadebs success speaks for the hard work he has put in on the fitness front. He can bowl long spells tirelessly and the manner in which he dismissed Ajay Jadeja proved his worth. He allowed the seasoned Jadeja to shuffle and lunge forward for the outswinger in the first five balls of one over. On the last, he brought one back to surprise the batsman and catch him plumb in front. 

 Sourav Sarkar, who took four wickets on Wednesday

If Ranadeb hogged the limelight, Sarkar wasnt too far behind and gave him adequate support from the other end. Sarkars four-wicket haul was reward for his consistent line and length. 

There was very little by way of resistance from the Rajasthan batsmen. If Jadeja used all his experience to drop anchor at one end, Rahul Kanwat tried to disturb the bowlers rhythm with an attacking display with Sarkar being the worst sufferer for a brief while. That was the only time when the Bengal bowling looked slightly out of sorts, but Ranadeb once again came to the teams rescue. 

Kanwats 62 came off 63 balls, and included 12 hits to the boundary. 

Bengal were lucky not to have been made to pay heavily for dropped chances. The hosts fielding has not been of the highest standard this season, and it could hurt them in the long run. As many as three straightforward chances were put down on Wednesday. 

Bengals reply began shakily, Arindam Das being dismissed off the very first ball. But Subhomoy Das and Avishek Jhunjhunwala played sensibly and with responsibility thereafter. 

It seems two points and a semi-final berth are almost assured for the hosts. We will bat the whole day tomorrow No doubt about that, Deep said. 

With lots of batting to follow on an easy wicket, Rajasthan will have to gear up for a tough day on the field.

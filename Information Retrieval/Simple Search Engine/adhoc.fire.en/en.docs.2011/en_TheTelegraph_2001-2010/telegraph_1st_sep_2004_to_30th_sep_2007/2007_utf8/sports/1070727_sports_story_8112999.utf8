The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 RP bowled intelligently, which is why hes on the Honours Board

 - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 

 Former England quick Angus Frasers report card 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Nottingham: With 177 Test wickets under his belt, Angus Fraser (now 41) knows a thing or two about bowling with the cherry. On Thursday, the former England quick, who is a widely respected columnist, spoke to The Telegraph on the specialist new-ball bowlers who did duty in the first Test (at Lords). 

The following are excerpts 

On whether the new-ball bowlers need to keep anything in mind while bowling at Lords 

The slope factor can get overplayed, but theyve got to keep that in mind Theyve got to use it to their advantage I mean, if you bowl badly, you could look very foolish Lords rewards excellence and exposes those who bowl poorly. Except the first spells from a couple of Indians, the quality of bowling was very high. 

On the Trent Bridge wicket 

Usually, it helps swing In the days when Clive Rice and Sir Richard Hadlee turned out for Notts, the ball would do everything The wicket has settled a bit somewhat, but with all this rain, I do expect the new-ball bowlers to enjoy an advantage. 

On how Indias (specialist) new-ball bowlers fared at Lords 

ZAHEER KHAN: Hes like a daisy Sometimes, he does it, at other times, he doesnt Zaheer is classy when he gets it right, but has the tendency to bowl many four-balls Having played for almost seven years, one expects him to be consistent The way he bowled on the first morning was disappointing Instead of setting the tone for India, he allowed England some free runs He wasnt the only culprit, but those runs made a difference 

First Test: Two for 62, four for 79. 

RUDRA PRATAP SINGH: Very impressive I wasnt impressed the first time I saw him in person, during the India-England ODIs in India last year He didnt have pace and looked rather innocuous At Lords, though, the left-armer surprised me He showed variety, was aggressive Indeed, he was bowling with purpose and richly deserved the five wickets in the second innings RP bowled intelligently, which is why his name is on the Honours Board (at Lords) and not Sachin Tendulkars To qualify, batsmen need a hundred, while bowlers must return a fiver. 

First Test: Two for 58, five for 59. 

SREESANTH: Had a bad first spell, like Zaheer But hes young and less experienced and, so, one could partly excuse his showing that first morning However, he does have the potential to take big wickets and is quite an exciting bowler Has the ability to make things happen Isnt short on energy either I suppose nerves played a big part that day. Hes bound to get better. 

First Test: Three for 67, none for 62. 

On how Englands (specialist) new-ball bowlers fared at Lords 

JAMES ANDERSON: Hed made a positive impression when he first played for England in 2002-03, but didnt really repeat his debut-showing He was, of course, outstanding at Lords He had good pace, swung the ball and kept a challenging line He showed he could do things, but the bigger challenge is to be consistent Consistency separates the good bowlers from the ordinary. Somebody like Anil Kumble is great because hes so consistent. 

First Test: Five for 42, two for 83. 

RYAN SIDEBOTTOM: He lends such variety to the England attack Hes left-handed, swings the ball and is quite aggressive The way he bowled his first spell (second day) was in contrast, for example, with the way Zaheer bowled his on the opening morning Sidebottom straightaway put the Indians under pressure Hed made his debut six years ago and there was a time when people were wondering why he was still playing Hes 29 now At Lords, he showed just how good a package he was. 

First Test: Four for 65, two for 42. 

CHRIS TREMLETT: He has all the attributes of a fast bowler Height, pace, bounce Any team would love to nurture somebody like him He comes across as a bit too nice, though Im not suggesting he has to swear after every ball, but needs to let the batsmen know he means business His was a risky selection, ahead of Stuart Broad, but it paid off The debutant didnt disappoint. 

First Test: One for 52, three for 52. 

Finally, on whether he has interacted with the Andersons 

Unofficially, with Anderson. Weve chatted quite a few times That hasnt happened with the other two. 

Note: Fraser made the Honours Board twice. First, when he got five for 104 versus India in 1990 and, then, when he claimed five for 66 against the West Indies. That was five years later.

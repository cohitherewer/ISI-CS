 Nothing illegal, says MCC

London: Adam Gilchrist did not contravene the rules by using a squash ball in his glove during the World Cup final, the MCC (Marylebone Cricket Club) said on Tuesday. 

Apparently the addendum to the inside of the gloves was not for protection from injury but to improve the way the batsman gripped the bat handle. This should not be considered unfair, said the MCC, guardian of the laws of cricket, in a statement. 

The incident could not be classed either as contravening the law or as breaching the spirit of the game. 

Gilchrist revealed using the squash ball at the post-match press conference after smashing a match-winning 149. It was a chaotic, rain-marred final which ended in darkness, but the left-handers blazing knock overshadowed everyone else. 

He used the ball on advice from his coach Bob Meuleman, who believed it would help him with his grip.

 Negi puts Kuzubov in place

Kirishi (Russia): Parimarjan Negi scored a thumping victory over higher-ranked Grandmaster Yuriy Kuzubov of Ukraine to remain in joint lead after the fourth round of the World Youth Stars chess tournament here. 

Negi methodically outplayed Kuzubov and took his tally to 3.5 points out of a possible four. The Indian shares the top spot with world junior champion Zaven Andriasian of Armenia. The two meet in the next round where the Armenian has the advantage of playing with white. 

Negi stuck to Sicilian Closed against Kuzubov and masterminded an impressive king side attack to force the Ukrainian GM on backfoot. 

The middle game saw Negi exerting pressure on both flanks and Kuzubov was saddled with a passive position for the rest of the game. The Indian exchanged queens at the right time to reach a better endgame where his rooks did the damage. The game lasted 47 moves. 

If Negi displayed allround qualities to beat Kuzubov, Andriasian beat IM Falco Bindrich of Germany in quick time too. (PTI)

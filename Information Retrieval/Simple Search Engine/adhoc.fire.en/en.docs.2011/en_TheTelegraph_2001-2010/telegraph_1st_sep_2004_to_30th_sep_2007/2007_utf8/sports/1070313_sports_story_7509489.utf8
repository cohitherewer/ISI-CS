 Gurung passes away

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Indian football lost yet another of its illustrious players of the 80s when midfielder Narender Gurung, 47, passed away at Dera Baba Nanak in Punjab after he suffered a brain haemorrhage on Sunday. He is survived by his wife and two children. 

Gurung, a Deputy Commandant with the BSF, woke up in the morning and vomited blood a few times before losing consciousness. He was rushed to the hospital but in vain. 

A highly talented footballer of his time, Gurung was a picture of refinement and elegance and a member of the great Indian midfield club that dominated the Indian football in the 80s. 

If Prasun Banerjee, Prasanta Banerjee, Krishanu Dey and Sudip Chatterjee were the ones who ruled the Maidan in Calcutta, Gurung and Parminder Singh were Punjabs fitting reply to the brilliance of the Calcutta players. 

In his decade long association with BSF, Gurung, along with Jagmohan (who, too, has died at an early age), turned the para-military side into a winning combination and won two Durand Cup titles in 1981 and 1988. 

His best moment, however, came in Cuttack in 1980 when his dazzling display won the Santosh Trophy for Punjab, thus stopping Bengal from winning it for the sixth consecutive time. 

In the 1981 Federation Cup, Gurung was once again the star performer and walked away with the Player of the tournament Award.

 Yuvraj, Zaheer back in top 20

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Yuvraj Singh and Zaheer Khan were back in top 20 of LG ICC ODI rankings following their impressive performances in Indias 2-1 series win over South Africa. 

The dashing left-hander scored an unbeaten 49 to help India level the three-match series against South Africa and then stroked a masterful 59 not out on Sunday to enable the side clinch the series. 

These stellar performances have moved Yuvraj up two places to 19th position in ODI batsmens rankings, according to an ICC release. 

Having missed the opening game against Ireland, Zaheer took three wickets in as many games against South Africa. This has helped him rise two places to 20th in bowlers rankings.

 Kaneria feels let down by ODI snub

Karachi: Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria has criticised his omission for the South Africa one-day series starting on Sunday and said it could dash his World Cup hopes. I am very much disappointed, Kaneria said. I feel like the team management has let me down. I was expecting to be given a chance in this one-day series before the World Cup. 

Although Pakistan lost the series 1-2, Kaneria was among his teams leading wicket-takers, finishing with 15 victims despite a number of dropped catches and missed stumpings. 

Captain Inzamam-ul-Haq had said he does not fit into the one-day combination. I dont understand why I am not considered for the one-dayers, Kaneria said. I have worked so hard and have given 110 per cent for my captain and the team. (Reuters)

 Symonds urges Aussie crowd to respect Murali 

Melbourne: Allrounder Andrew Symonds has urged Australian crowds to applaud Muttiah Muralidharan if the controversial off-spinner breaks Shane Warnes Test wickets record when Sri Lanka tour Down Under in November. 

The 35-year-old Sri Lankan became the second player in history to reach 700 victims in the final Test against Bangladesh in Kandy earlier this month, and lies eight scalps behind leg-spinner Warnes record haul. 

Symonds, a former teammate of Muralidharan at English county Lancashire, said he hoped Australian crowds would respect his achievements despite him twice being called for throwing on tours there in the 1990s. 

I just hope the beer drinkers in the sun dont give him a hard time and late one afternoon if he breaks the record they start on him, Symonds said. I hope that doesnt happen, I hope people can stand up and actually applaud him for what he is, a legend of the game. 

Sri Lanka play a two-Test series against Australia starting in Brisbane on November 8, but Muralidharan has only played three Tests on Australian soil largely due to the throwing controversies. 

He was also called for throwing by match referee Chris Broad after taking 28 wickets in a three-Test series on home soil against the Australians in 2004. He later that year skipped the tour of Australia after Prime Minister John Howard apparently agreed with a reporters comment that Muralidharan was a chucker. 

The fact that the retired Warne only smashed through the 700-wicket barrier at the Boxing Day Test against England last year may also add spice to the barracking. 

Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said the prospect of Muralidharan breaking of Warnes short-lived record in Australia was a reason to celebrate.

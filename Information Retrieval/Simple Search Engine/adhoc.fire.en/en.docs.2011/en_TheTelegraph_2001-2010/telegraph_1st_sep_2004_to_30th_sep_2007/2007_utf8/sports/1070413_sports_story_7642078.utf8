 Kapur at tied 27th 

Shanghai: Shiv Kapur overcame a poor start to finish with an one-over 72 that put him in tied 27th place at the end of the Volvo China Open on Thursday. 

The 24-year-old was the best among the five Indians in the field and was four shots behind on the first day. 

The joint leaders were unheralded Huang Ming-jie, who provided the sparkle for the local fans, and Raphael Jacquelin of France, both of whom shot 68 each. 

Huang, 26, fired a three-under-par 68 with seven birdies against four dropped shots while Jacquelin fired five birdies against two bogeys on a tough scoring day at Shanghai Silport Golf Club. 

Gaurav Ghei closed with two birdies in last four holes en route to a two-over 73, while S.S.P. Chowrasia had a ninth hole eagle and two double bogeys, two bogeys and two birdies in his eventful round. They were both tied 41st. 

Rahil Gangjee and Amandeep Johl were in danger of missing the cut at five-over 76 each and were at tied 97th place. (PTI)

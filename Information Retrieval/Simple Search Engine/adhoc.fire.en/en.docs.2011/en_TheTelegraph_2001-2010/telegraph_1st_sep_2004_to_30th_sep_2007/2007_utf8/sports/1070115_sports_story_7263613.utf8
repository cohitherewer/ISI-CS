Hobart: New Zealand lost their last seven wickets for just 23 runs on Sunday as Australia wrapped up another crushing win in the second tri-series one-day International in Hobart. 

The Australians followed up their eight-wicket demolition of England in Melbourne on Friday with another easy 105-run win over New Zealand, raising fears the limited-overs series will be just as one-sided as the Ashes. 

Australias batsmen overcame a middle-order slump to pile on 289 for eight from their 50 overs before their bowlers ripped through New Zealands lower-order to restrict the tourists to 184 in less than 39 overs. 

New Zealand fast bowler Shane Bond took a hattrick in the final over of Australias innings, but only after the world champions had amassed another daunting total. 

Allrounder Andrew Symonds top scored with 69 of 70 balls to win the Man of the Match award after Adam Gilchrist got the innings off to a flying start with a typically cavalier 61 from 58 deliveries. 

I suppose youd have to say that were having a fairly good run, but were not satisfied by any means, Symonds told a news conference. 

Weve still got a bit of improving to do. I think weve still played pretty good in the first two games, but there are things there we can still pay some attention too. 

We still see this as a very important process because weve still got the World Cup coming up... were building our whole summer around to hopefully being in a World Cup final. 

New Zealand managed to slow down Australias scoring rate when they reduced the home side to 196 for five in the 42nd over before Symonds and Cameron White smashed 90 runs in nine overs at the end to take the total close to 300. 

We kept them reasonably contained but the last four or five overs hurt us a lot, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming told reporters. Suddenly a score of 240 or 250 became 290 with some good hitting from White and Symonds.

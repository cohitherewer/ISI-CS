St Georges: After Sri Lanka snapped the streak, New Zealand hoped to return to their winning ways when they face South Africa in a World Cup Super Eight clash on Saturday. 

Rattled by their crushing loss to Sri Lanka on Thursday, New Zealand are keen to settle their anxiety on a semi-final spot as quickly as they could. It doesnt appear an easy task as the conditions here suit the batsmen and South Africa have any number of power-hitters in their ranks. 

New Zealand have eight points from five games and need at least one win to absolutely seal a place in the last four. Sri Lanka, Australia appear certainty for the moment and South Africa has made a strong statement after that upset loss to Bangladesh in Guyana. New Zealands worry has as much to do with the form of their top batsmen. 

The Black Caps have two games remaining in the second round and both appear tricky oppositions South Africa (the No. 1 ODI team till few days back) and Australia, who are keen to avenge the 0-3 defeat in New Zealand before the World Cup. 

As for batting, it appears too heavily reliant on captain Stephen Fleming and Scott Styris. 

Fleming has 290 runs from seven games while Styris is on top with 379 runs from as many games. Understandably the two alone have hit centuries in this competition now that Lou Vincent, another centurion, is cooling his heels in New Zealand because of a broken wrist. 

Peter Fulton, Ross Taylor, Hamish Marshall and Craig McMillan havent hit straps and in conditions which are overtly in favour of batsmen, it can be a serious handicap. 

South Africa, in contrast, have a batting line-up which has contributed right through the order. Jacques Kallis (441), Graeme Smith (351), AB de Villiers (315) and Herschelle Gibbs (243) have all come to party. 

Its been to an extent that the failure of Justin Kemp hasnt even registered with the Proteas. 

New Zealands best chance appears to be the early strike they could inflict on the opponents and they have the right man for the job, Shane Bond. As Sri Lanka showed on Thursday, early strikes could derail the opposition and limit the score even on flat pitches.

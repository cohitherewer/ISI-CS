 Kulasekara, Arnold in 15

Colombo: Sri Lanka named middle order batsman Russel Arnold and fast bowler Nuwan Kulasekara in their final 15-man World Cup squad on Monday. 

Sri Lankas selectors plumped for the experience of Arnold, a 33-year-old veteran who has scored 3744 runs in 167 matches, ahead of teenager Chamara Kapugedera. 

Kulasekara, a handy lower order batsman and sharp fielder, claimed the final bowling place ahead of Akalanka Ganegama, Nuwan Zoysa and Ruchira Perera. 

Leg spinner Malinga Bandara, who impressed against India at Rajkot on Sunday, claiming two for 36 including the key wicket of Sachin Tendulkar, was selected ahead of the more experienced Upul Chandana as the second spinner. 

Kapugedera, Ganegama, Chandana and Perera were named official reserves. 

The squad, captained by Mahela Jayawardene, included eight specialist batsmen and seven bowlers. 

Sri Lanka, the 1996 World Cup winners, are in Group B with 1983 champions India, Bangladesh and Bermuda.

 Easter break for Shields

 Mark Shields 

London: Even as the Bob Woolmer murder mystery deepens with the addition of new theories every day, chief investigator Mark Shields is set to fly home this week for Easter holidays. 

Shields, the deputy commissioner of Jamaica police who is leading the probe, insisted that he could not change his plans for the break, according to a report published in a British newspaper. 

Shields will make a nine-hour journey to London on Thursday. This will give him just two days to interact with detective superintendent John Sweeney and his three-man team from Scotland Yards specialist crime directorate. 

Shields decision to go on leave, which might provide more stuff for his critics, is already being compared to the break taken by Cambridge chief constable Tom Lloyd, who went to France during the Soham investigation while a huge hunt was underway for the two missing girls. 

During the break, Shields will visit his son and daughter, who live in the Suffolk countryside with his former wife Julia. 

On his holiday, Shields said: Dont read anything into it. I had always planned to see my kids over the Easter holidays, and that is set in stone. I wont change it for anything. 

Meanwhile, the Scotland Yard detective team led by Sweeney, has been asked to review every aspect of the inquiry. 

Sweeney is expected to adopt a low key approach to the investigation in contrast to that of the media savvy Shields.

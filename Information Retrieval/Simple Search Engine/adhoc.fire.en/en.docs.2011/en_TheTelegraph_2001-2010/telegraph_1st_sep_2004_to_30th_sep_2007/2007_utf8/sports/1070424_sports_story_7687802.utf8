Calcutta: The countdown for Manoj Tewari began on a steamy Monday morning at the Sporting Union ground. The Bengal batsman had a rigorous two-hour session his first since being selected in the Team India ODI squad for the series in Bangladesh. 

The 21-year-old is banking on Sourav Gangulys advice to play his natural game. He (Sourav) spoke to me during the Twenty20 meet I may again speak to him before leaving for Bangladesh, said Manoj. 

Manojs workout got underway at 10.30 am under the watchful eyes of coach Manabendra Ghosh. He practised with wet tennis balls thrown at him from 12 yards. He also batted against two under-22 Bengal left-arm spinners keeping in mind Bangladesh have the likes of Mohammed Rafique, Abdur Razzaq and Saqibul Hasan in their ranks. 

Bowling from 12 yards with wet tennis balls on a cement track generates more pace and bounce It was purposeful and quite effective, Manoj told The Telegraph. 

The coach also made him step out to the left-arm spinners. The aggressive batsman said he is high on confidence. I dont have any pressure at the moment and Ill play my natural game, said Manoj. 

About his preferred batting position, Manoj said: No. 4 and 5 are the two slots where Ive made the most runs. But it depends on the team management Im ready to play at any position.

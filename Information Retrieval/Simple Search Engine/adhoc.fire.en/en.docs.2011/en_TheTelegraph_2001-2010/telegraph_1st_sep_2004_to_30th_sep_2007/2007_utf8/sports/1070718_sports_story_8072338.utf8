 UPDATE 

Urawa hold United 2-2

Tokyo: Manchester United were held 2-2 draw

 by J-League champions Urawa Reds in a friendly at Saitama Stadium on Tuesday.

 United scored through Darren Fletcher and Cristiano Ronaldo, with Urawa getting

 goals from Hideki Uchidate and Shinji Ono. We considered the game a good test for us and a good test for Urawa Reds and it was a fair result, United

 manager Alex Ferguson said. 

Chelsea in no hurry 

London: Bruce Buck has risked disturbing the sense of equilibrium that has developed on Chelseas pre-season tour by warning John Terry and Frank Lampard that they may have to wait until later in the season to be given new contracts. The chairman said on Monday that Chelsea are in no rush to finalise extended deals for the two England internationals in stark contrast to the attitude of the two players, who have made it clear that they want to stay at Stamford Bridge. 

Giuly poised to leave Barcelona 

Madrid: French midfielder Ludovic Giuly is poised to leave Barcelona and sign a three-year deal with AS Roma for a fee of up to $6.21 million, the Primera Liga side said on Tuesday. The agreement with Roma is closed but the player has yet to sign his contract, Barcelona sporting director Txiki Begiristain was quoted as saying on the clubs website.

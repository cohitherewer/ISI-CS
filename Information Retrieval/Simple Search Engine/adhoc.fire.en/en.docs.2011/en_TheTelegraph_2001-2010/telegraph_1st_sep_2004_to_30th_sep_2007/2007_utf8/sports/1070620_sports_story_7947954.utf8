 PCB to take players feedback on coach

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) will consult the national team players while appointing a new foreign coach for the senior team. 

Chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf would hold a meeting with the players to discuss the appointment of a new coach after the shortlisted candidates Australians Dav Whatmore, Geoff Lawson and Richard Done have been interviewed. 

Lawson and Done have already been interviewed by board officials while Whatmore is due in Lahore later this week. 

The new coach has to work with the players and what they want is very important to us. The players feedback will count a lot, Ashraf said. 

Meanwhile, former captain Javed Miandad flayed the PCB for allegedly bypassing its own rules and regulations while negotiating with Australians Whatmore, Lawson and Done. (PTI)

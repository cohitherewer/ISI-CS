Madrid: Real Madrid outcast David Beckham should be playing for the club, not sitting in the stands on match days, midfielder Guti said on Tuesday. 

Beckham has not played for Real since January 7 in the 0-2 defeat away to Deportivo Coruna. Soon after, the former England captain announced his decision to join Los Angeles Galaxy at the end of the season. 

Coach Fabio Capello said he would not pick Beckham again for the remaining six months of his contract. He has not been included in the last six squads for the league or Kings Cup. 

First, I would say David is a friend of mine and that he is a great player. He has chosen a change in his career and he deserves the utmost respect from everyone, Guti told a news conference. 

We would all like to see him not only training with us but playing as well, but it is a club decision that is out of our hands. We want every player to participate, especially ones as important as David. 

Both Capello and sporting director Predrag Mijatovic have said they want to blood some of the younger players in the side, as they seek to rejuvenate the team for the future.

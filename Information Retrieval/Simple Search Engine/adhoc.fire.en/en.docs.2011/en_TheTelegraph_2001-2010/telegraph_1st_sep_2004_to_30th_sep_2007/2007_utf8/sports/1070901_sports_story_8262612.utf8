 Felix retains 200m title 

Osaka: American Allyson Felix foiled Veronica Campbells gold rush on Friday, streaking past the Jamaican to win the 200m title by the largest margin in world championships history. 

Jeremy Wariner kept the stars and stripes fluttering in Japan with an expected victory in the 400m and Liu Xiang finally gave China something to cheer about when he stormed to the 110m hurdles title. 

Campbell had been bidding to emulate Tyson Gays mens sprint double, having won the 100 metres on Monday, but was no match for Felix who retained her title in the years best time of 21.81 seconds. 

She beat Campbell by 0.53 seconds the biggest margin in 11 championships and her time was the quickest by a woman over the distance since compatriot Inger Miller won the 1999 championships in a time 0.04 seconds faster. 

Wariner retained his world title in style, the Texan powering off the final bend to clock 43.45 seconds. LaShawn Merritt took silver in 43.96 with Angelo Taylor completing an all-American podium with a time of 44.32. The US became the first nation to sweep the mens 400m.

 Twenty20 cash influx sparks hockey threat

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Carvalho 

New Delhi: A highly embarrassed Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) bigwigs got down to damage control on Wednesday after national coach Joaquim Carvalho said some of his players would go on hunger strike, protesting the governments step-motherly treatment towards the hockey players. 

On a day when cash awards were being showered on the Indian cricket team, Carvalho alleged that politicians and state governments had a bias against hockey players. Why are hockey players, who won the Asia Cup, treated like orphans and why are politicians biased against the game? he asked. 

Carvalho announced that four players Vikram Kanth, V. Raghunath, S.V. Sunil and Ignace Tirkey along with coach Ramesh Parmeshwaran and manager R.K. Shetty, would go on hunger strike in front of the Karnataka chief ministers house to protest the announcement of Rs 5 lakh cash award for each ICC World Twenty20 winning member, while treating hockey players like dust. 

[Karnataka government announced late on Wednesday Rs 2 lakh cash award each to the four players and the coach from the state. I regret the lapse on my part. I thank the hockey players for bringing it to my notice, chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy said.] 

When contacted, IHF secretary K. Jothikumaran was at pains to explain that everything was in order. I have already spoken to the coach and the manager. No one is going on hunger strike, he said. 

Jothikumaran also said that each member of the Asia Cup team would be given Rs 1 lakh. Asked why the announcement came so late, the IHF secretary had this to say: It was announced then itself (after Indias win in Chennai), but no one took notice 

What has peeved the IHF most is Carvalhos criticism of the Sahara Group, which is also the main sponsors in hockey. Sahara has announced a house for each cricketer but hockey players were not even given a match box, Carvalho said. 

IHF president K.P.S. Gill refused to comment on the issue. 

Incidentally, three of the four players, who, according to Carvalho, were to go on strike, are currently playing in the national league in Germany. Only Sunil is available in India. 

Some in the hockey circles felt the national coach had remained surprisingly silent on the fact that the IHF had very little to offer after India won the Asia Cup. After the Asia Cup, the team was promised only Rs 57,000 for scoring 57 goals. Why didnt he raise his voice at that time? asked a senior member of the team. 

Some also wondered why the Mumbai-based Carvalho had not asked the local players to go on a similar strike in front of the Maharashtra chief ministers house. 

After all, three players from the Asia Cup team (Adrian DSouza, Shivendra Singh and Gurbaj Singh) are from Carvalhos home state, said an IHF official. 

Gagan Ajit Singh, meanwhile, backed Carvalhos view, saying hockey players are ignored by all despite bringing laurels to the country. Despite our Asia Cup win, what did the get in return? Just peanuts, he was quoted as saying so by an agency. 

Carvalhos outburst, however, has had an immediate impact. 

Civil aviation minister Praful Patel also didnt escape the national coachs diatribe for offering out-of-turn promotion to Air India cricketers and ignoring hockey players. There is a competition going on between politicians and state governments in announcing cash prizes to only cricketers, Carvalho said. A couple of hours later, Patel announced that hockey players, too, would be rewarded for their achievements.

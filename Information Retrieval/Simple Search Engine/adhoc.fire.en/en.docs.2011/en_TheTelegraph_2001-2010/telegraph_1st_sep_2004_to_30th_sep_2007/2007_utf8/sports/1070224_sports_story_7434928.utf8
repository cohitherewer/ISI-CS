 Ricky Pontings admission

Melbourne: Ricky Ponting has conceded that shuffling in team selection had contributed to Australias recent poor form in ODIs and said they have to find ways to improve. 

Weve got to look at what we havent done in the last few games and find ways to improve. It was only a month ago that everyone was saying we were odds-on favourites to win the World Cup, and all of a sudden now, we cant win it. 

If we had all those guys fit at the start, we would have given those guys Tait, Watson and (Stuart) Clark some cricket at the start of the series and been able to build up to our best team when the finals came around, but we werent able to do that, Ponting was quoted as saying in a newspaper here.

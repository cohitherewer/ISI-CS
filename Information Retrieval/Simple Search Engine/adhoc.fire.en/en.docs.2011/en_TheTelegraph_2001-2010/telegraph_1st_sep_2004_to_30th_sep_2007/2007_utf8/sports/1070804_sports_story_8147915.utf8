 Cloud over Nikolay tie 

 Nikolay Davydenko 

London: Tennis officials are investigating suspicious betting patterns on a match involving top-seeded Nikolay Davydenko of Russia, who retired with an injury against a low-ranked opponent at an ATP tournament in Poland. 

In an unprecedented move, British online gambling company Betfair on Friday voided all bets that were placed on Thursdays second-round match at the Prokom Open in Sopot between the defending champion and No. 4-ranked Davydenko and No. 87-ranked Martin Vassallo Arguello of Argentina. 

Betfair said it received about $7 million in bets on the match 10 times the usual amount and most of the money was on Arguello to win, even after Davydenko won the first set 6-2. 

Arguello won the second set 6-3 and was leading 2-1 in the third when the Russian retired. Davydenko said he aggravated a left foot injury in the second set. He received medical attention from a tournament trainer before deciding to quit. 

I dont think he (Davydenko) has something to do with this, Arguello said on Friday. 

I was playing against him, but he was playing also with an injury, and thats all that I know about the match. 

Betfair said it was concerned with the volume of wagers coming in on Arguello from the start. Betfair said it would turn over its betting records for the ATP to investigate. 

ATP officials said on Friday that Davydenko had left Poland. 

Since losing in the fourth round at Wimbledon to Marcos Baghdatis, Davydenko lost three straight first-round matches before beating Andrei Pavel, 6-3, 6-4 in the opening round in Poland. 

Arguello lost 2-6, 6-4, 6-2 on Friday in the quarter finals to another Argentine player, Jose Acasuso. 

Arguello said nobody contacted him about the match beforehand. (AP)

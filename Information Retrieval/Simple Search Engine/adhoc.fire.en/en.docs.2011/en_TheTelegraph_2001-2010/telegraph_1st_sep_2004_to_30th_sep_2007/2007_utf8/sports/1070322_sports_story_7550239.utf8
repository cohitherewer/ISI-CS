 Planning paid off against Kenya, says Fleming 

Gros Islet: New Zealand were so in control of their game against Kenya, they could afford to experiment. 

New Zealands 148-run win on Tuesday secured a place in the Super 8 stage and allows for even more tinkering in their final group game against Canada. 

It was pretty much to plan, the whole innings today, a satisfied New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming said. The tempo was about spot on. You can get too complicated in what youre trying to achieve but todays blueprint was pretty much seen out there. 

New Zealand were sent into bat and their total of 331 was their World Cup best and the highest ODI score at the Beausejour Cricket Ground. Kenya were dismissed for 183 in the last over. Fleming said it was harder to prepare for a match against a non-Test side. 

Its tough when you play the so-called minnows because they bowl different length, different pace and it provides a different challenge, Fleming said. You dont practise for this type of play, and the pace, you cant generate what you usually generate so youve got to adjust your game. 

Ross Taylor adjusted well, hitting 85 despite struggling late in his innings with a hamstring strain and needing a runner. That earned him Man-of-the-Match honours even though he didnt field. He wont play against Canada. 

Its a bit sore at the moment but hopefully come tomorrow, well have a bit more of an idea of where its at, Taylor said. Its not related to cramp. 

Rain twice interrupted play, and the key concern for New Zealand was completing 20 overs so there would be a result. That meant a change of bowling order, with Craig McMillan and spinner Daniel Vettori coming on earlier than planned. 

There was talk about losing the rest of the day, and because weve only got a day in between, we wanted to get those 20 overs and get out of here, Fleming said. We were desperate to do that and once we did that, it was a little bit of free falling, we just got guys some work under their belt. The game wasnt secondary but we were going through some processes of loading. 

Kenya captain Steve Tikolo, however, was unhappy over his side being forced to bat on in persistent rain.His batsmen went off twice for rain and although the game resumed quickly both times, the 35-year-old felt the umpires took too long in suspending play. I thought we should have come off. But I dont want to get into controversies, the mainstay of four World Cups told a news conference.

 Indians script shock win over Czechs

 HOPMAN CUP 

Melbourne: Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna provided a good reason for new year celebrations by lifting Hopman Cup debutantes India to an upset win over Czech Republic in Perth on Sunday. 

Sania and Bopanna won the group B tie 2-1 after clinching victory against the third seeds in the deciding mixed doubles match which witnessed a nail-biting finish. 

Sania got India off to a perfect start in the womens singles defeating the 42nd-ranked Lucie Safarova 6-2, 6-2 in just 55 minutes. 

However, the Czech Republic bounced back in the mens singles, where 13th-ranked Tomas Berdych trounced Rohan Bopanna 6-2, 6-2 in 46 minutes, tying the tie 1-1. 

Bopanna, world No. 277, had no answer to the allround play of the much-higher ranked Berdych. 

In the crucial mixed doubles clash, Sania and Bopanna kept their cool to edge past the fancied duo of Safarova and Berdych 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 (10-5) after an 89-minute battle. 

Sania credited Bopanna with getting India through the doubles, after the Czech team rallied from a set and a break down to force a match tie-breaker. 

Rohan played unbelievable in the mixed, I literally didnt have to do much. He was flying all over the court He had a banana before we went on, Mirza said. But I had to let loose also, I couldnt just let the boys hit it. 

In the other Group A tie of the eight-nation mixed team event, France defeated the US with Jerome Haehnel and Tatiana Golovin winning their singles matches. 

Golovin took nearly two hours to defeat Ashley Harkleroad 6-3, 4-6, 6-2. 

Haehnel won a third-set tie-break 7-3 to beat the more experienced Mardy Fish 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 and give seventh-seeded France the win. The Frenchman later admitted he had needed to overcome a dislike of flying to make it to Australia to play for his country. 

The United States, seeded fourth, were awarded a walkover for the dead doubles rubber.

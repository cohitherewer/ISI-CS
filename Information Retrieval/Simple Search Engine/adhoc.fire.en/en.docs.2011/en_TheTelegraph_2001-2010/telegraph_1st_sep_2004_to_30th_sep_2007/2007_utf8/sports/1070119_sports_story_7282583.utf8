 Ashim goal inconclusive: Chima 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Controversy surrounded Ashim Biswas goal against Mohammedan Sporting in Barasat on Thursday. While East Bengal coach Carlos Roberto Pereira insisted it was a perfect goal, his counterpart Subhas Bhowmick pointed out that his goalie Gopal Das seemed to have saved it in a right manner. 

Chima Okerie one of the greatest scorers the Maidan has ever had packed further punch to it, saying that the goal remained inconclusive despite TV replays. 

The Nigerian, who was present at the ground as a commentator of the official channel, maintained that the goalkeeper didnt seem to have crossed the line while blocking Ashims header. 

Its not clear if the goalie was inside his line but youve to respect the referees decision, he added. 

Addressing the media, Pereira said he was happy to keep his teams winning momentum going. He, however, didnt pay much attention to the suggestion that his team could have won it by a much bigger margin. Its not possible that a team will convert all chances. To me the result was 2-1 and Im happy with it, the Brazilian said. 

He also brushed aside the idea that his defence looked susceptible under counter-attacks. We came out in the middle for a win, not for a draw. So, little mistakes here and there could be visible. Jayanta (Sen) was not at his best today, and he allowed Habibur (Rahman Mondal) a free-header inside the box. Still my defence fought bravely and denied Mohammedan Sporting on other occasions, Pereira added. 

Bhowmick, on the other hand, stressed that East Bengals series of openings, especially in the second session, was a fallout of his teams strategy of all-out attack. 

We played badly in the first-half, but came back strongly after the break. But sadly, the defence committed a silly mistake, letting Ambani score, he said. 

Thereafter, we had to go on the offensive. For me, 0-1 or 0-5 (the scoreline by which Mohammedan Sporting lost to Dempo) remain the same because its a defeat after all, he reasoned. 

Pereira declared that he would also go for victory against Churchill Brothers in the next match while Bhowmick promised to fight on with the available resources. 

Meanwhile, the police heckled some mediapersons before the match. They refused entry to the journalists challenging their valid passes. A heated exchange of words between the two parties followed, but senior police officials intervened in time to settle the issue.

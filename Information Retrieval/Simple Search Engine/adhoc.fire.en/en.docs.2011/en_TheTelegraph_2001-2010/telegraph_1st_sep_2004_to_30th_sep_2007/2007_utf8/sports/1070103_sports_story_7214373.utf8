The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Lifes a big party for Makhaya Ntini

 - On the field it has to be a different ball game 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ntini 

Cape Town: South African spearhead Makhaya Ntini, who is close to completing a decade in international cricket, believes life should be enjoyed. 

Among the most carefree of cricketers anywhere, the 29-year-old told The Telegraph the other day: Theres so much fun to be taken in Life must be enjoyed But, once on the park, its serious business Thats my approach 

So, while Ntinis all fired up bowling at the Indians, nothing stops him from indulging in match-making (between a member of the support staff and a lovely fashion designer) on a flight carrying the South African team. He tried that, unsuccessfully, on the two-hour service from Durban. 

Ill laugh and joke Have a party but, boy, I can switch on without any effort... On the field it has to be a different ball game and Im up for it, he added. 

According to a survey conducted by BMI, an independent company focusing on the sports and sponsorship market, Ntini is the most popular South African sportsperson both among juniors and adults. 

Ntini, incidentally, has been awarded a Benefit Year (June onwards) by his province the East London-headquartered Border and Cricket South Africa. Things are being put in place, he informed. 

The controversy at the start of his career notwithstanding, Ntini deserves to reap the benefits of an awesome career.

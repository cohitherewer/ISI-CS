 PCB asks Shoaib, others to keep mum

 Karachi: Pakistan rsquo;s players should keep quiet about the spat between Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif in South Africa which led to Akhtar being sent home from the Twenty20 World Cup, officials said on Sunday.

 ldquo;Shoaib and the others should keep their mouth shut on this issue. It is not helping either the team or the image of Pakistan cricket, rdquo; Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf said.

 Pakistan rsquo;s ICC World Twenty20 team management sent Akhtar home on Friday after he hit Asif on the thigh with a bat during a nets session.

 On Saturday, Akhtar told a news conference he had hit Asif accidentally and blamed allrounder Shahid Afridi for sparking the incident by making an offensive remark.

 Ashraf said Akhtar would get the opportunity to defend himself and give his version of events before a three-member inquiry committee. ldquo;Until the inquiry begins he should remain quiet, rdquo; he added.

 PCB chief executive Shafqat Naghmi left for South Africa on Sunday to start the inquiry.

New Delhi: Captain Bhaichung Bhutias fine effort early in the match brought India full points against Bangladesh in the ONGC Nehru Cup at the Ambedkar Stadium here on Monday. 

However, for the 8,000-odd spectators, the 1-0 victory came as a disappointment. The form that India displayed in their 6-0 win over Cambodia on the opening day was totally missing except for a brief period in the second half when they launched a ferocious onslaught on the Bangladesh goal. 

This was the period when India could have slotted in at least three goals, but narrowly missed the target on all occasions. Sunil Chhetri and substitute Clifford Miranda rattled the Bangladesh goal with fine attempts but both shots missed the target by a whisker. 

The goal by Bhaichung was a beauty that made the difference between the two teams. 

Bangladesh coach Syed Nayeemuddin had promised to pay special attention to Bhaichung. Defenders Waly Faisal and Rajni Kanta Barman were seen closing on the Indian captain from the very beginning. Unfortunately for Bangladesh, the ploy didnt work for more than five minutes. 

Bhaichungs sense of positioning was once again evident when he struck the goal. Chhetri controlled the ball on the left and lobbed in the Bangladesh goalmouth. A misdirected clearance by the defence landed the ball in front of Steven Dias, who made a wild swing at the ball. 

The shot was feeble and ill-directed. As the ball was going out, Bhaichung appeared from nowhere to quickly pounce on it and take a shot from an acute angle. The shot eluded the goalkeeper Biplab Bhattacharya, hit the far post and rolled in. 

For the rest of the first half, Bangladesh played on even terms. They had more say in the midfield and they did trouble India in their own area. The visitors, still without a point in the tournament, dug in deep into the Indian defence, which didnt look too comfortable against constant pressure. 

The absence of NP Pradeep in the midfield told on the overall game that the home team produced. Pradeeps replacement, Mehrajuddin Wadoo was not up to the mark except for the initial period. It helped Bangladesh open up the Indian defence a number of times. Its a pity that neither Jahid Hasan Ameli nor Zahid Hossain could cash in on the chances in the first half. 

So intense was the Bangladesh pressure at one point of time that Indian goalkeeper Subrata Paul was adjudged MoM for his fine showing under the bar. The AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi came down at the end of the match to congratulate Nayeemuddin.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We have to take game to grassroots: Sachin

 - We need proper infrastructure to attract more kids: Borde 

Belfast: Putting the right infrastructure in place and widening the base to ensure a steady supply of quality players should be Indias priority to keep pace with international cricket, according to maestro Sachin Tendulkar. 

If the infrastructure is good, the next generation will definitely be more talented and more knowledgeable, felt Tendulkar. 

On the occasion of 75 years of India in Tests, the former captain, considered one of the best batsmen the game has witnessed, said: Cricket is changing very fast and we need to keep pace with it. When you have more players taking up the game, you will have more to choose from. That will ensure a good supply of quality players in the long run. 

Tendulkar also stressed on the need to tap talent in remote areas. 

Its extremely important to take the game to the grassroots and Im sure thats one of the major points on the BCCIs agenda. Thats how this game will get bigger and better. 

Players from remote areas simply do not have access to the game. They need to be given opportunities to prove themselves. We need to introduce cricket in every nook and corner of the country. 

Chandu Borde, Team India (cricket) manager, echoed similar sentiments. 

I had the privilege of attending the captains meeting and we suggested that the game needs to be taken far and wide, said Borde, also a former captain and chief selector. 

We need proper infrastructure to attract more kids. All these years there was a lot of interest in schools and colleges. They formed a major supply line. That is now gone. 

Now we have endless number of academies that serve little purpose. They have more or less the same coaching style for every player. Its like feeding the machine to get the same product. I strongly believe that cricket in schools and colleges should be revived.

 Kapur ends tied 37th

Zandvoort: Shiv Kapur dropped two late bogeys on the back nine to shoot a one-over 71 and finish tied 37th at the KLM Open golf meet. 

Kapur bogeyed third, birdied the ninth and then again birdied the 12th only to drop shots on 13th and 15th for a total score of two-under 278. 

Ross Fisher survived a rules enquiry at Kennemer before learning that he had won the title. He birdied the final hole for a closing of three-under par 67 and a 12-under par 268 aggregate and claimed the title by a stroke from young Dutchman Joost Luiten. 

However, he had a terrible day with the putter as he needed 32 putts in the day. Fisher, after completing the round, had to return to the 12th hole to prove he had not broken a rule by lifting a bramble runner and then check out the incident on video before he was cleared to collect the first prize. 

A thorough examination of the incident following a spectators observation to the officials revealed Fishers actions were not illegal. 

Fisher, a first-time-winner, led Luiten, who also birdied the last for a 66, by two strokes with three holes to play. But bogeys on the 16th and 17th holes, both by three-putting, left Fisher needing to hole an eight-footer for birdie on 18th.

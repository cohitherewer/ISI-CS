 Lanka to miss Murali, Vaas

Colombo: Sri Lanka will be without some of their star players for the ODI series against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi later this month, a senior official said on Sunday. 

The World Cup runners-up, who will play three one-dayers with Pakistan from May 18-22, will be without three key players Muttiah Muralidharan, Chaminda Vaas and Kumar Sangakkara. 

The three will be going to England to play County cricket and we have told the Abu Dhabi organisers that we will be sending the best available team, said K. Mathivanan, secretary of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC). (AFP)

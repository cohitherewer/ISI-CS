 Early test for groom Younis

Karachi: The PCB will conduct an early dope test on vice-captain Younis Khan as the date of his marriage clashes with the pre-scheduled dope tests session. 

Younis had apprised the PCB of his unavailability for the tests to be conducted in Lahore on Friday, saying that he is getting married on the same day in Karachi. 

A PCB official confirmed that they had received Younis request from South Africa. 

What we are trying to do now is to get the dope test done on Younis in Karachi as soon as the squad returns from South Africa early on Friday, the official said. 

Meanwhile, Azhar Mahmood has been added to Pakistans reserves for the World Cup. National selector Iqbal Qasim said on Wednesday that Mahmood had been included in place of uncapped Mansoor Amjad as cover for pace bowlers Shoaib Akhtar, Umar Gul and Mohammed Asif. 

All three will undergo fitness tests this month and, if required, can be replaced in the squad. (PTI)

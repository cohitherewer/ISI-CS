 Ojha stars in India A win

New Delhi: Left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojhas five-wicket haul helped India A record a 44-run victory over Sri Lanka A in a tri-series match in Nairobi on Sunday. 

India A, dismissed for 198 in 46.3 overs, bundled out Sri Lanka A for 154 in 41.3 overs, thanks to Ojhas exploits at the Gymkhana Club ground. Ojha returned enviable figures of five for 21 off 7.3 overs while Team India discard Irfan Pathan captured two wickets. 

Gayan Wijekoon (46) emerged top-scorer. 

Put in , India A did not impress against the Sri Lankan seamers. Left-arm pacer Sujeewa de Silva (four for for 33) was the wrecker in chief. Arjun Yadav showed resolve to notch up a half-century.

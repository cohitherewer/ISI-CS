 Its a pretty hard thing to swallow, says Lee

Sydney: Brett Lee tried to remain philosophical after being ruled out of the World Cup on Friday. 

The 30-year-olds dream of helping his country defend their title in the West Indies ended after seeing a specialist in Sydney. Ive come to the conclusion that Im not going to be a part of the World Cup, its a pretty hard thing to swallow, but youve just got to accept things sometimes, Lee said. 

I think now its just a matter of letting the ankle settle down and really giving it a chance to heal up and the possibility of within two to three weeks that there might be some surgery happening just to clear out a bit of old bone floating around in the ankle, Lee added. 

Lee is to be replaced in the squad by New South Wales teammate Stuart Clark. Im really happy for Stu, hes a great guy and deserves everything that comes his way, hes a fantastic player, hes really good around the team, Lee said. 

Im sure he will play a major part during the World Cup and I wish him all the very best of luck. 

Lee said he was not too concerned about Australias current form slump in which they have lost five ODIs in a row. 

Its now a matter of trying to find that form again, Im sure its only a game away and once you find that right sort of form again, really concentrate on our momentum going forward, then Im sure that the Australian team will be back to where it was, Lee said. 

Lee said his injury, sustained during fielding practice last week in New Zealand, was far too serious to even think about playing in the latter stages of the World Cup which starts next month but goes on until the end of April. 

Its an eight-week minimum injury for people that run down the road, if youre asked to bowl a cricket ball at 150 kilometres per hour, slamming your foot down at 15 times your own body weight, its certainly a lot more than eight weeks, Lee said. 

Trying to fit that into a four-week period, the mathematics just dont work. (Reuters)

 Ishant may play vs England A

Chelmsford: In an effort to fine tune their bowling combination ahead of the Test series, India may include 19-year-old seamer Ishant Sharma in the three-day warm-up game against England A, starting here on Friday. 

In the tour opener against Sussex, Indian bowlers had the English County champions on the ropes before letting off the hook. When it mattered most, the visiting teams pacers failed to polish off the tail and Sussex escaped with a draw. 

Manager Chandu Borde said at the end of the third days play that he was unhappy with the way the mediumpacers had bowled and that they needed to be sharper and more accurate. Captain Rahul Dravid may aim at testing other seamers in the squad. Sharma, who made his Test debut against Bangladesh in May, is likely to replace Bengal mediumpacer Ranadeb Bose. Zaheer Khan is expected to come in for Rudra Pratap Singh. 

The Indian camp would try to find out why the bowlers failed to finish the job against Sussex in both innings after having run through the top order. 

In the first innings, India did well to reduce Sussex to 144 for five before allowing them to declare at 300 for six. In the second innings, India reduced Sussex to 123 for seven in 32 overs, with just the tail to be taken care of in the next 23 overs. However, Robin Martin-Jenkins stuck it out with a fighting innings and batted for two hours for his unbeaten 45. 

Sussexs last wicket pair of Martin-Jenkins and Jason Lewry blocked no less than seven overs as the Indians failed to deliver the knockout punch. 

The Indians, meanwhile, had to endure a long nightmare as their bus journey from Hove to Chelmsford took an agonising eight hours, instead of the usual two and a half, because of heavy traffic. The team left straight from the Hove ground for Chelmsford at 7.30pm (midnight IST) on Tuesday and reached the Five Lakes Resort at 3.30 am (8am IST) on Wednesday. 

We were stuck in a heavy traffic jam. There were serpentine queues on the road and we reached our hotel at 3.30 am, team manager Rufus Rocky said. We will be staying at the hotel. There is nothing on the agenda and the players want to rest, Rufus added.

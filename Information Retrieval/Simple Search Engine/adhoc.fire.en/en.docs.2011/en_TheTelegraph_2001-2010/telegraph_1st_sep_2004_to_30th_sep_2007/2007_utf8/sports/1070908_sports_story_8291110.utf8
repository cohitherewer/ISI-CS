 Sachin awaits crowning glory

London: Sachin Tendulkar on Friday described his farewell tour of England as a memorable summer but said a win in the seventh and last one-day cricket match at Lords would be its crowning glory moment. 

As he looked back on his final journey in Old Blighty, Tendulkar said Indias triumph in the Test series was something very special that has seen the team showcase great fighting spirit and collective effort. 

Tendulkar has played some vintage cricket in the one-day series. So far on this tour, he has smashed 548 runs from his 10 innings, with four 90s, at a strike rate of 84.3. 

Saturday, as Tendulkar walks out on the sacred turf at Lords he will again be carrying the hopes of an entire nation on his strong shoulders looking to slice a piece of history at the famous venue for himself as much for his team. 

It has been a great summer of cricket for the entire team. The victory in the Test series was very special, Tendulkar said. 

This is my fourth tour of England and we waited for a long time to beat England in England. It was highly commendable and special and I was extremely happy to be a part of it, said the star batsman. 

Playing in England is part of your cricketing education just as it is when playing Australia or South Africa. Every country is different and you face different challenges and learn to deal with different wickets and different bowlers, Tendulkar said. 

While not many would have given the Indians a chance after their great escape at Lords in the first Test, Tendulkar reckons the team never lacked self-belief and eventually turned it around with a great show in the second Test at Nottingham. 

After beating South Africa the confidence was high. We knew if we played to our potential, then we had a real chance, he said. (PTI)

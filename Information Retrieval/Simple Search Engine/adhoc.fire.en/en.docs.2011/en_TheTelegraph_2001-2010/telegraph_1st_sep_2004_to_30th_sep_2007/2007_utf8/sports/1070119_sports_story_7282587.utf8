 IWF eases rules for India

New Delhi: Happy days, it seems, are here again for Indian weightlifters. 

In a major breakthrough, the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) has agreed to allow India to take part in international meets if the national body pays up 50 per cent of the fine imposed on it as a penalty. 

It may be recalled that last July, the IWF announced a one-year ban on Indian weightlifters (effective till March 2007) and a fine of $50,000 after two Indian weightlifters, Edwin Raju (56kg) and Tejinder Singh (85kg), tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs at the Commonwealth Games. 

Speaking to The Telegraph on Thursday, secretary of the Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWF) Balbir Bhatia said that though the international body had recently lifted the ban on India and asked it to pay and play, the Indian federation failed to raise the fine amount of $50,000 and join the international arena. 

Iran paid a fine of $400,000 and took part in the Asian Games, said Bhatia. 

For us it is not easy to raise even $50,000, especially in the light of the fact that the government was not ready to help us in this matter. 

The IWF has asked us to pay 50 per cent of the fine amount and the rest within six months. We have managed to collect $25,000 through some of our well-wishers and would be paying the amount in a week. The rest will be paid in six months, Bhatia said. 

Encouraged by international bodys decision, the IWF may call up its first national camp in a year immediately after the National Games in Guwahati.

 Fame did Beckham in, says Charlton

Manchester: David Beckham should be playing in England, not the US and his celebrity lifestyle has damaged his career, according to former England and Manchester United great Sir Bobby Charlton. 

(Beckham) was a really, really great footballer a marvellous talent, Charlton said on Thursday at the launch of his autobiography. I saw it when he was about 10 and he has a terrific talent, but his lifestyle has gone in a different direction. 

He wanted to be a footballer as much as any young player Ive ever seen and I wonder sometimes if he thinks whats happening (now), Charlton said at Old Trafford. 

Hes in America, hes committed to making millions of pounds, Charlton said. I would rather he was playing here in England than anywhere else, thats for sure. (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav bets on young

Calcutta: Former captain Sourav Ganguly exuded confidence that the young Indian team would quickly adjust to the South African conditions and would perform well in the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 championship. I am sure they will do well. They will not have any problem in adjusting to the conditions, Sourav told newspersons here on his return home from England. 

Sourav said the Indians had an outstanding series in England. May be we did not win the one-day series but apart from that the tour went off very well. We played outstandingly. 

Sourav did not agree that the Indians choked at Lords in the finals of the Natwest Series against England. 

Just because we lost that match, it would not be proper to brand us chokers. Prior to the England series, we came back from behind to beat South Africa 2-1 at Belfast, he said. 

Sourav said that the Indians did not feel any extra pressure in the final. Pressure is part and parcel in international cricket. We are used to it. 

The former Indian captain who put up a good show in the Test and one-day series said that back-to-back tours of Ireland and England did not pose any problem for the Indians. This is how international cricket schedule is. And we are familiar with it. 

On none of the established batsmen reaching a three-figure mark in England, Sourav said so what? They will get it in the next series. 

Asked about the chemistry behind the success of his opening partnership with Sachin Tendulkar, the left-hander said definitely, there are reasons. We are playing together for a long time. 

Sourav regretted that he could not see off his teammates who left for South Africa for the World Twenty20 meet. They left so early in the morning that I could not wish them. 

I will definitely talk to them later, he said.

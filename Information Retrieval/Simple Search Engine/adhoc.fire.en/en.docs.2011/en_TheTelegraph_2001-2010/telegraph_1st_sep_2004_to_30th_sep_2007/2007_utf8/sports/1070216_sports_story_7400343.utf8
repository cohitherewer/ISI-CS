 Sharapova named UN ambassador

United Nations: Maria Sharapova has become the latest celebrity appointed goodwill ambassador of the UN Development Program (UNDP), pledging to use her charisma and fame to galvanise support for the fight against world poverty. 

At a crowded news conference at the UN headquarters, the 19-year-old Russian star also donated $ 100,000 to eight UNDP recovery projects in rural communities in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine still affected by the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster. 

My first step is to focus on the Chernobyl-affected region, where my family has roots, the tennis ace said. Today, it is poverty and lack of opportunity that pose the greatest threat for young people in the Chernobyl region. 

UNDPs efforts in the fight against poverty are crucial for young people everywhere to achieve their potential, she said. 

Sharapova was born in Siberia and spent two years there after her family fled the Belarus city of Gomel in the wake of the disaster. In 1995, she left Russia for the US to become a student at a tennis academy. 

On behalf of UNDP, Sharapova will promote international efforts to achieve the poverty-reduction millennium development goals in the areas of education, health, womens rights and sanitation by the target date of 2015. 

 The 19-year-old Sharapova, who won the 2004 Wimbledon and 2006 US Open titles, has earned more than $9 million (euro 6.9 million) in her six-year career. (AFP)

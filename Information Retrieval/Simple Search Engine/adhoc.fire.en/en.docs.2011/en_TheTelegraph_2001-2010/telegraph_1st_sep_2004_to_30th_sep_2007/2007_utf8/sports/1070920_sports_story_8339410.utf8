 Sunny hails Dhonis elevation

New Delhi: Mahendra Singh Dhonis elevation to one-day captaincy Wednesday got a thumbs-up from batting great Sunil Gavaskar, who complimented the selectors for looking to the future. 

I dont think they (selectors) had much of an option, simply because I think the selection committee must be wanting to look forward rather than back, otherwise you would have (Sourav) Ganguly and (Sachin) Tendulkar back in contention again, Gavaskar said. 

The former captain said going to the old guard would not have solved any problems and it was right that they should be looking forward. 

Gavaskar, however, said Dhoni would not have things easy as he starts his ODI captaincy stint. 

He is playing against world champions Australia in seven one-dayers and it is not going to be easy, he said during a cricket commentary. 

But he was impressed by the way Dhoni showed composure in the ongoing ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa, especially during the bowlout against Pakistan. (PTI)

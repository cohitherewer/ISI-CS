The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Meet fails to draw crowds

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The third edition of the Sunfeast Open has failed to live up to expectations. Empty stands and lack of demand for tickets present a sorry picture. Something very unlike what was witnessed in the previous two years. 

So poor has been the response to the tournament that, despite the gates of the Indoor Stadium being thrown open for free on Thursday and Friday, theres been no crowd to speak of. 

Tournament director Jaidip Mukerjea admitted that demand for tickets and crowd presence has been poor. He said it was certainly not because Calcuttans have lost interest in tennis. 

There are two reasons, I feel, said Mukerjea. One is the World Twenty20 meet and the other the absence of Sania Mirza. 

This year the build up to the tournament has not been what it ought to have been, despite the fact that the line-up boasted of a world No. 10 and a No. 12. 

So much so that the exhibition mixed doubles on Tuesday, between Sachin Tendulkar/ Maria Kirilenko and Bhaichung Bhutia/ Mahesh Bhupathi, was played before a sparse crowd.

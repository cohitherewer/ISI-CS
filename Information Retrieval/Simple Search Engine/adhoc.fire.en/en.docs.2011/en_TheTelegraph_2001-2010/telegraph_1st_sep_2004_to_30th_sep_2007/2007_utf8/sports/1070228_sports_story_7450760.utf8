 Dynamos pip Jalandhar 3-2

Chandigarh: Chandigarh Dynamos earned a hard-fought 3-2 win over finalists Sher-e-Jalandhar to remain in the race for the bronze medal in the Premier Hockey League at the Sector-42 Hockey Stadium here on Tuesday night. 

In cold and windy conditions both the teams played at a slow pace and took time to settle down and the hockey dished out was dull and dreary. 

Shers, who have already qualified for the best-of-three finals, rested some of their key players. Dynamos drew the first blood in the 17th minute following a long corner. (PTI)

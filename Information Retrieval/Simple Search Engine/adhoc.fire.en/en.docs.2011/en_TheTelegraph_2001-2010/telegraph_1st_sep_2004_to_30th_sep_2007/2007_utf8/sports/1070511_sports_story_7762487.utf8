Dhaka: Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Dinesh Karthik may have done the star turn on Thursday, but Rahul Dravid did not forget to remind the top order that it needed to get its act right. 

We need to bat a little well at the top. We should not have lost as many wickets as we did, but I am quite happy and I am sure as the games go on, the top order will fire, quot; he said on Thursday. 

The victory, though, left him satisfied. There are some areas where we can do better. But it is a big credit to the boys to come back from the position we were in and to win. A win is a win and we will take it. It was a hard-fought win, there were really tough conditions out there. We probably got the slightly rough end of the conditions. 

Fielding first is not really going to be easy in these conditions and then having to chase 251 against three quality spinners. The boys deserve praise for the way they stuck at it. We are playing after a while, so it was a good win. 

Will the conditions mean India will go in with five bowlers? We will see how the conditions stay. Today Dinesh Mongia did a good job as a bowler as well. Ramesh (Powar) and Veeru (Virender Sehwag) also chipped in well. It will be a case of looking at our combination and how we work them in the next game, said Dravid. 

He also praised Bangladeshs performance. Bangladesh are playing some good cricket, no doubt. With the runs they put up today, they would have definitely beaten a few around the world in these conditions. 

Habibul Bashar felt Bangladeshs failure to take wickets at crucial junctures led to the defeat. They batted well. Then we should have managed to break the Dhoni-Karthik partnership that got them victory. Dhoni made all the difference. 

We couldnt keep our cool under pressure. We will have to work hard. We can push India hopefully in the next couple of game if we dont commit the same mistakes, he explained. 

Bashar admitted missing Mashrafe Mortaza. He is a wicket-taking bowler and we missed him. Hopefully he will be available on Saturday. 

The team management is monitoring Mashrafes progress and dont want to rush things. His progress will be monitored on Friday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Empire may avenge defeat 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Southern Empire gets a chance to settle scores and also return to winning ways when the Placerville-Stunning son takes on Diabolical in the 2,400m Indian Turf Invitation Cup on Sunday. The S. Ganapathy-trainee was a victim of misjudged pace in the Indian Derby which had ended his winning streak at ten. The highest rated youngster in the country has a point to prove and with Colm Donoghue in the saddle, there is no looking beyond him in the showpiece event, whatever the result of the Indian Derby may have been.

 Haunting Memories, the facile winner of the Sprinters Cup on Saturday, is out to do a Bergamo in the Maj. P.K. Mehra Memorial Super Mile Cup. The Placerville-Haunting Beauty daughter is known to be more comfortable over a mile-trip and may achieve the goal she has set for herself.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

Calcutta: East Bengal seem a determined bunch ahead of their ONGC Cup National Football League match against Mohammedan Sporting on Saturday. A rejuvenated Mohammedan Sporting, on the other hand, will try to draw inspiration from their spirited 3-2 win over Dempo Sports Club last Monday. 

They will be on a high after having performed so well against Dempo and that motivation can drive them ahead, East Bengal coach Carlos Roberto Pareira said on Friday. 

Agreeing that the Dempo match will be a motivating factor, Pareiras counterpart Biswajit Bhattacharya however stressed that there will not be inferiority complex among the boys. 

No one knows better than the East Bengal coach that each and every match now holds a great significance. Every match is crucial for us every game is toughevery game is important if we want to win the title this time. 

Pareira informed that M. Suresh will come back in place of injured Covan Lawrence, who was injured in the last match against HASC. Jayanta Sen will also have to sit out for injury and he will be replaced by Hardeep Saini. Hardip is a very good marker, though may not be a good a distributor like Jayanta. But we have Chandan for distribution part, Pareira pointed out. 

An alert Bhattacharya remarked: There is no such weakness in the East Bengal side but our side is also charged up entirely. This will be a good fight as we dont want to let it go. 

Mohammedan Sporting, though wanted to hold on to the winning combination, will have to make one change in the starting XI either Raman Vijayan or Bijen Singh take injured Harwinder Singhs place while AS Firoz may start as the sweeper. 

Red-and-golds are placed third with 19 points. Mohammedan Sporting with 10 points occupy the ninth position. Both have played 11 matches.

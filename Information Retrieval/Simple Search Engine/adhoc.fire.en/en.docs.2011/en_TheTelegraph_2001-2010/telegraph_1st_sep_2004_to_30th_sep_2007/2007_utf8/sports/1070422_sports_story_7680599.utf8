 The Highlights

 This was Australias 657th ODI match, which is the most played by any team in ODI history. Pakistan have played one less (656), while India are third in the list (646). 

 Matthew Haydens 103 was the 100th three-figure score in the World Cup. The first century in a World Cup was scored by Englishman Dennis Amiss (137 against India at the Lords on June 7, 1975) and the 50th was by Australian Mark Waugh (110 against New Zealand in Chennai on March 11, 1996). 

 Hayden (580 runs) became the only second batsman after Sachin Tendulkar (523 in 1996 and 673 in 2003) to cross 500-mark in a single World Cup. 

 During this calendar year, Hayden has amassed 1186 runs (average: 65.89, five centuries) in 22 ODIs. 

 Haydens two sixes en route to his 103 took his tally to 17 the most by any batsman in a single World Cup. Indias Sourav Ganguly had 15 in 2003 World Cup. 

 Shane Watsons 28-ball fifty was the fastest by an Australian batsman in the World Cup, equalling Tom Moodys effort against Bangladesh in 1999. 

 Australias 348 for six was the highest total by any team against New Zealand in the World Cup, bettering the 322 for six in 60 overs by England at The Oval in 1983. 

 Mark Gillespies figures of 6-0-67-0 was the worst bowling performance (in terms of economy) by a New Zealand bowler in an ODI match. It also equals the worst performance by any bowler (bowling at least six overs) in a World Cup match. Kenyan pacer Rajab Ali had identical figures against Sri Lanka at Kandy in the 1996 edition. 

 Glenn McGrath has taken his tally of wickets to 22, equalling the most by an Australian bowler in a single World Cup. Injured teammate Brett Lee also had claimed 22 wickets in the 2003 WC. Now only Sri Lankan Chaminda Vaas (23) has more wickets in 2003 edition. 

 Brad Hogg became the second bowler, after Sri Lankan Farveez Maharoof, with two four-wicket hauls in this World Cup. 

 Australias 215-run victory was the biggest between two Test playing nations in the World Cup. Previously England had beaten India by 202 runs at Lords in 1975. 

 The win was also the fifth biggest between two Test teams in ODIs.

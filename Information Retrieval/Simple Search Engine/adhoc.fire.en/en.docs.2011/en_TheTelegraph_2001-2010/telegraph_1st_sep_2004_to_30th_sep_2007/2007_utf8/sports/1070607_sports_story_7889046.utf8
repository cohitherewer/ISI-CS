 Pollock: Fordie has been fantastic

Former South African captain Shaun Pollock, who authored

 a terrific hundred in the Afro-Asia Cup opener on Wednesday, spoke about Graham

 Ford during a media conference. 

The following are excerpts: 

Fordie has been fantastic as a coach... I first got to know him in 1991 (in Natal)... He helped my career... I dont know what the Indians are looking for from him, but I do know hes a good coach... He didnt lose his job (with South Africa) because of the match-fixing scandal... Hed continued for around two years after that...

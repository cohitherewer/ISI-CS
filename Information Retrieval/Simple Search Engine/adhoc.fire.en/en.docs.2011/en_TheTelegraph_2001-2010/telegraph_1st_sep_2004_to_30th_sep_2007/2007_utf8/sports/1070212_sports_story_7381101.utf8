 Afridi not to appeal ban

Cape Town: Pakistan allrounder Shahid Afridi has decided not to appeal against a four-match ODI ban handed down Saturday for pushing his bat at a spectator. 

An unsuccessful appeal would have delayed Afridis ban and he might have missed Pakistans first four World Cup matches. Instead, he will miss the last two matches of the series against South Africa, as well as Pakistans first two World Cup matches, against the West Indies and Ireland. 

Meanwhile, Shoaib Akhtar on Sunday said he fears he could miss the World Cup after suffering a knee injury that may take three to four weeks to heal. (AFP)

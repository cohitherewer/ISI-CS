 Blame Premier League, not West Ham 

SUE MOTT

 There is delicious irony in that West Hams escape was scripted by Carlos Tevez 

All the forces of civilised Christendom seem to have been ranged against West Ham United on Sunday, but as they say at the sort of nightclubs Anton Ferdinand frequents: What yer gonna do about it? Nothing is the answer. West Ham stayed up. Sheffield United went down and, for all the outraged talk of the London club being beneficiaries of ill-gotten gains, the fault lies squarely with the Premier League, who refused to endorse its own rules. 

Spare us the sermonising claptrap demanding that natural justice be done against the lying, cheating Hammers. If the rules had been properly upheld for West Ham admitted the offence of fielding ineligible players and were fined 5.5 million as punishment offering prayers to the deities of Just Causes would not have been necessary. 

Were always being told that the Premiership is the best league in the world, a super-sophisticated industry, in which case, what a strange way to do business. It is like the boss of ICI tying a bunch of lucky heather to his bedpost instead coming up with a marketing strategy. 

Meanwhile, those moral guardians of the game, the FA, were keeping very quiet or perhaps they were all kidnapped and gagged by Sir Trevor Brooking, West Hams beloved old boy, who sits among the elders of the game. 

Now were being told that a legal insurrection is being mounted against the Premier Leagues failure to dock points from West Ham, but watch this space. Sheffield United might be adamant, but the interest of the survivors will vanish like the morning mist. 

West Ham have got away with it in every sense. For more than half the season, they were dreadful on the pitch as well as off. 

The manager was swapped, the chairman was replaced, they lost 0-6 to Reading and Matthew Upson, bought for 6 million from Birmingham, played 41 minutes before being injured for the rest of the season. 

The arrogance of the players who had appeared in last seasons FA Cup final knew so little bounds that the laughably-appointed captain, Nigel Reo-Coker, played like a god. 

The look on new manager Alan Curbishleys face after a couple of weeks said it all. Burdened, bewildered and bowed, he must have wondered why he had emerged from blissful retirement to partake of this brand of torture. 

Beset by Harewood, hubris and two Argentine players who suddenly turned up on the doorstep, West Ham were so going down. Then to the earnest shock-horror of the Premier League, who thought their certain relegation would make the controversy go away, the East Enders unaccountably perked up. 

There is delicious irony in the fact that the leader of the escape committee was none other than the scar-faced Argentine embarrassment, Carlos Tevez, who played passionately for the Hammers as though hed been born in Bethnal Green rather than Buenos Aires. 

He was lethal and irresistible and with every celebrated goal he scored, including the one that beat Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday, the suits at the Premier League headquarters quivered more desperately in their pinstripes. 

There seems to be some muddle-headed thinking that West Ham should have done the decent thing and gone down. But that is the trouble with not punishing miscreants. They are thrilled and unrepentant. They tend to find this in the world of criminal justice too. Let off a burglar with one of those nice detachable tags and instead of volunteering for social work, he jemmies open another window and makes off with more loot. 

Having failed to punish West Ham properly, Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, had to watch as they appropriated another 35 million the rewards of being in the Premiership. He can argue it was an independent tribunal that made the crucial decision. Who appointed the independent tribunal? 

No one should blame West Ham for this failure of moral justice. 

Survival is a highly-tuned human instinct, to which many a moral has been sacrificed down the centuries. West Ham remain a Premiership club because the Premier League was too feeble to back its own rules. It is the story of the chicken and the egg. And this time theres no question which one came first.

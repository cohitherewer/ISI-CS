 Randhawa champion

 Jyoti Randhawa 

Gurgaon: Jyoti Randhawa overcame an erratic start to claim the Rs 65 lakh-DLF Masters golf title with a 10-stroke margin here on Sunday. 

The Indian ace had three bogeys in the front nine to shoot two-under 70 in the final round that gave him a 15-under 273 overall and his third crown of the season. 

Shiv Kapur, Randhawas closest rival at a distance of six strokes going into the day, faded out after a brilliant start and ended up with two-over 74. 

The Busan Asian Games gold medallist began with three birdies in the front nine and reduced his deficit to three strokes after the fifth hole. But five bogeys in the back nine, four of them on the trot, wrecked his chances. 

Randhawa was a relieved man. 

It feels great. Everybody expects, sometimes too much, when you come back and play on home turf. But it has helped me get focused and play well, he said. 

Randhawa pocketed a winners purse of Rs 10.53 lakh, which adds on to the cheques of Rs 9.7 lakh and Rs 11.34 lakh he won by clinching the AIS Open and Bilt Open earlier on the inaugural PGTI Tour. 

Although it was his home course, the 35-year-old had to master it as the fairways had grown and changed in his absence. And the pin positions tested his putting skills. 

I have raised the bar. Yes, I would say that. But it is also time that Indian golf came up, the champion said. 

Randhawa said he was assured of the title once he birdied the 12th hole. 

I knew I had won after the 12th because after that he had to birdie the next five, he said. 

He found the green from the second shot and putted from 15 feet for the crucial birdie. 

Kapur two-putted for a bogey there and followed it up with three more bogeys in succession. 

After the 13th, I knew I had not a chance. He (Randhawa) made great putts on the ninth and the 12th. He played some solid golf, every time he fell back he came up with a birdie. After the 12th he shut the door on me, Kapur said. 

The team championship was won by Amardip Sinh Malik and Raghav Malik with a total of 15-under-par, 129. Gaurav Ghei and his partner Naurath finished second, while Ashok Kumar and APS Kang finished third.

 Atwal at 26th

Glenview (US): A poor front nine cost Arjun Atwal dearly as he slipped to 26th spot after returning an even-par 72 in the third round of the Lasalle Bank Open on Saturday. The Orlando-based golfer, who had a superb 66 in the second round, is now seven-under 209. 

The lead is held by the threesome of Jason Day, John Riegger and Tad Ridings, all of whom shot 68 each. (PTI)

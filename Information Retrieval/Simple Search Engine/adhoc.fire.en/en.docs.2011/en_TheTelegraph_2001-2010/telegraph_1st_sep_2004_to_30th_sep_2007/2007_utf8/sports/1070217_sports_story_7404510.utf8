 Surya Sekhar downs Motylev

Moscow: Grandmaster Surya Sekhar Ganguly continued with his dream run and cruised past former Russian champion Alexander Motylev in the second round of the Aeroflot International Chess Tournament here on Friday. 

Second seed Krishnan Sasikiran suffered a shock defeat at the hands of little-known International Master Igor Lysyi of Russia and P. Harikrishna miscalculated his chances against local hopeful Valerij Popov and went down after a tactical battle. 

Also ending on the losing side was worlds youngest GM Parimarjan Negi, who found a tough customer in Wang Hao of China while S. Vijaylakshmi proved no match for another Russian, Evgeny Tomashevsky. 

Apart from Surya, only womens GM Dronavalli Harika managed to hold her fort, holding the highly regarded Darmen Sadvakasov of Kazakhstan after an intense game. 

Surya emerged as one of the seven leaders, with two points from as many games. 

The biggest surprise among the leading group is 12-year old Chinese wonder girl Hou Yifan who impressed everyone with a scintillating victory over former European and world junior champion Emil Sutovsky of Israel. 

Playing the white side of a winawer variation, surya masterminded a fine positional plan in the middle game to retain his miniscule advantage and had to wait for over five hours before the Russian finally succumbed to the pressure.

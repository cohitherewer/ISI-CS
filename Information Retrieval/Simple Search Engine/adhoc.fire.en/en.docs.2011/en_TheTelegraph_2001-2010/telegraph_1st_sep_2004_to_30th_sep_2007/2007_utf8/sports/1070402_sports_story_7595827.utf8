 Aussies hopeful of quick Watson recovery 

St Johns: Australias World Cup team has reason to be thankful for an irregular tournament schedule. 

After two games in five days, Australia have an eight-day break between Saturdays 10-wicket victory over Bangladesh and their next game against England. That may give allrounder Shane Watson time to recover from a calf strain. 

Watson was running up to bowl the fourth ball of his second over in Saturdays rain-shortened Super Eight match against Bangladesh when he showed obvious discomfort and left the field. 

The reason was a left calf injury that, if it doesnt clear up, would necessitate a rethink by captain Ricky Ponting for the game against Australias old rival on April 8. 

Losing an allrounder out of your side does throw the balance out, Ponting said. If hes going to miss the next game, I have to really think about what our best line-up is. Hes been playing as our fifth fast bowler whos a bit handy with the bat. 

Watson had only just come on to bowl in his teams second Super Eight match. Im disappointed for him, Ponting said. 

Hes got what looks to be a really minor strain in his left calf. Were lucky it happened now and hopefully with some good treatment hell be available for that (England) game. (AP)

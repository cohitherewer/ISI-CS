 Federer quells Stepanek challenge

Melbourne: Roger Federer pulled through a stern opening test to subdue Radek Stepanek 7-6 (7-2), 6-7 (4-7), 7-6 (7-5) and begin his Australian Open build-up on the right note at the Kooyong Classic on Wednesday. 

Holder Andy Roddick won a re-run of last years final, dominating German Tommy Haas 6-2, 6-3, while Russian Marat Safin needed a set to get accustomed to the hot and windy weather before beating David Nalbandian 5-7, 6-1, 6-2. 

There was a debut win for British teenager Andy Murray, who moved into the championship round with a win over Ivan Ljubicic 6-4, 6-2. 

World No.1 Federer found himself involved in a battle lasting for more than two hours in steamy conditions at the suburban Melbourne venue against Stepanek. 

The Czech, to be married to Swiss star Martina Hingis, looked like he might embarrass Federer with just days to go before Mondays opening grand slam of the season. 

But the ice-calm Federer played it cool in the heat, fighting through a run of ragged play to eventually secure the victory. 

The Swiss recovered after losing a break which had given him a 3-3 scoreline in the final set, staging a rally from 2-5 down in the final-set tie-breaker. 

I came here last year from winning in Doha, said Federer, 92-5 last season and playing for the first time in 2007. Im trying to find my way into the new year. (AFP)

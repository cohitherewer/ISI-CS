 Kanpur mourns great cricketer

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Kanpur: While crickets leading figures mourned Bob Woolmers death, a hospital in this city stopped all surgeries as they remembered the big-built man with a bigger heart. 

Doctors and nurses in Kanpurs McRoberts Hospital lit candles and held special prayers in an operation theatre where the late Pakistan coach was born on May 14, 1948, at 2.15 in the night. 

We would miss the great man and a great cricketer, said Dr M. Datta, the woman in charge of the hospital. 

When he visited us in 2005 during the Pakistan tour, he offered each of us a T-shirt, recalled A.K. Bhatnagar, another doctor. We took him to the labour room where he was born. 

The operation theatre was today cleared and converted into a prayer hall where the doctors, nurses and an old security guard who remembered Woolmer observed a minutes silence. 

It was a great moment for us on March 14, 2005, when he visited this hospital. He was sentimentally charged as he stepped into the room where he was born. We searched the records and told him where he was born, said Dr Chaudhary, the hospitals superintendent.

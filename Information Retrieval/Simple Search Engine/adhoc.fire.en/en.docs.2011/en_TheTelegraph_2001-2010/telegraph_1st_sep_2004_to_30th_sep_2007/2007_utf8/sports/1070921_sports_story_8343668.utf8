 Gelfand catches up with leader Anand

 Viswanathan Anand 

Mexico City: Viswanathan Anand defended skilfully as he split the point with Hungarian Grandmaster Peter Leko to remain in lead after the sixth round of the World Chess Championship here. The draw, however, allowed Israeli GM Boris Gelfand to catch up with Anand at the top after beating Russian Grandmaster Alexander Morozevich. 

Anand and Gelfand have four points from six games and have a slender half-point lead over their nearest rivals. 

Anand faced the Spanish opening in his game against Peter Leko and he replied with the Archangelsk variation. He sacrificed a pawn in the opening but Leko returned it in a couple of moves in an attempt to wrest the initiative. 

The position looked dangerous for Anand but the Indian Grandmaster defended skilfully to neutralise all the threats. The players agreed to split the point after 21 moves in an equal position. 

Gelfand was the only winner in the sixth round. Defending champion Vladimir Kramnik had to be content with a draw against Levon Aronian and Alexander Grischuk split the point against Peter Svidler. 

Gelfand continued his superb form and played the solid Finachetto variation against the Queens Indian defence and obtained the better endgame after exchange of queens on the 17th move. 

Morozevich is not a player who likes to defend quietly and he reacted in his usual style by sacrificing an exchange to create complications. 

Gelfand played with tactical accuracy and simplified the position with a nice combination on the 26th move. It was plain sailing thereafter and Gelfand pocketed the point in 50 moves. 

Kramnik faced the Catalan opening in his game against Aronian. The defending champion had little difficulty in obtaining equality from the opening. 

He made a risky pawn grab in the early middlegame, which put him in some danger, but managed to survive with tricky play. 

Aronian saw his chances evaporate and the draw was agreed to after 22 moves. 

The most exciting game of the day was a wild slugfest between Alexander Grischuk and Peter Svidler. Svidler won a pawn in a complex variation of the semi Slav defence and allowed Grischuk to dominate the centre.

 Karnataka bounce back

 - Ranji semis

Calcutta: Bengal surrendered some of their advantage while Karnataka showed signs of bouncing back in their Ranji Trophy Super League semi-final at the Eden on Wednesday. At stumps on Day II, the visitors tried to make up for their first innings debacle by reaching 97 for no loss in their second essay after bowling out Bengal for 238. 

Karnataka, who were bowled out for 89 in their first innings, showed grit and determination with both their openers remaining unbeaten at the close. 

Bharat Chipli was going strong on 64 off 85 balls at one end while a poised Barrington Rowland held fort at the other. Chiplis 64 came in just 59 balls, and was studded with 12 hits to the boundary. Barrington took 96 balls for his 26. 

The second morning never started well for the hosts as they lost wickets in quick successions and failed to capitalise on the ground that was made by the Ranadeb Bose-Sourav Sarkar pair. 

Arindam Das, who resumed at his individual overnight score of 45, looked to carry on from there till he edged one to forward short-leg on 88. Das hit 14 boundaries during his 204-minute stay at the crease. 

Ever since Das gifted his wicket, only Laxmi Ratan Shukla tried his bit with a well-made 41. Shukla, who played a calm and important innings, had only five hits to the fence in his 161-minute show. Shukla was shown the door by S. Dhananjay who caught Shuklas half-hearted drive on his followthrough. Actually it was Das and Shukla, who fetched Bengal the 149-run crucial first innings lead. 

Captain Deep Dasgupta who was down with a slight fever on Tuesday, came in to bat at No. 7, but his stay was short-lived. Dasgupta was adjudged leg-before off B. Akhil just after the new ball was taken. After Dasguptas departure, the others didnt last long. Sourashish (20), Sourav Sarkar (0), Ranadeb Bose (0) and Ashok Dinda (2) were the other contributors. 

For Karnataka, S. Dhananjaya and B. Akhil claimed three wickets each giving away 45 and 52 runs, respectively. Vinay Kumar and Sunil Joshi got two wickets each. 

Karnataka didnt make any mistake in the second essay. Bharat Chipli (64 batting) and Rowland Barrington (26) were never in any spot of bother after Bengal bowlers failed to bang the ball in the right areas in the last session. 

Ranadeb resumed from the pavilion end but after only one over he was brought on from the High Court end, but of no use. With a packed off-side field, the lanky pacer was never spot on. He was erratic which helped the batsmen to settle down. 

Among the two Karnataka batsmen, Chipli was at his prime as he never let the loose ball go by while his partner Ronald played the role of sheet-anchor. For the record, Chipli smashed 12 boundaries from 85 balls and Roland had only two hits to the fence off 96 balls. 

With Karnataka just 52 runs behind, it is still an open game with three more days to go.

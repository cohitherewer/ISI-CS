Hobart: Andrew Flintoff scored a brilliant half-century to steer England to a morale-boosting three-wicket victory over New Zealand in the third tri-series one-day International in Hobart on Tuesday. 

Flintoff made an unbeaten 72 off 75 balls to help England reach their victory target of 206 with just one ball to spare and register their first win on their disastrous tour of Australia. 

Weve won a game of cricket, Englands relieved captain Michael Vaughan told a news conference. It was an important day for us all. We had to win today for the whole momentum of the tour. 

Now weve got the season up and running, we must take the momentum from this game into a big game against the Aussies on Friday. 

England looked to have the game well in control after James Anderson captured four wickets to restrict New Zealand to 205 for 9 until things started to go wrong and the Black Caps almost stole the game. 

Vaughan strained a hamstring and Englands batting wobbled before Flintoff came to the rescue, slamming seven boundaries to win the Man of the Match award. 

Its one thing I wanted to do for a while, especially in the one-day form is finish a game, Flintoff said. To be there at the end and knock the runs off... Im pleased to have done that today. 

New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming said both teams had been nervous but Flintoff proved the deciding factor. 

Tentative batting probably led to sub-standard batting and it was England who were a bit more match-hardened than us, Fleming said. 

One guy made a difference and it was just a slug-fest between two sides that were nervous. 

Flintoff, who has been in great form since being relieved of the captaincy, had a lucky escape in the 47th over when he was caught by Taylor at mid-off from a full-toss from Mark Gillespie but the umpire ruled it was a no-ball because the delivery was above his waist. 

England seemed to be back in control needing 12 off the final two overs, but that became four off the last over when New Zealand dismissed Jamie Dalrymple and kept Flintoff and Jon Lewis to two singles. 

But Lewis managed a single off the first ball of Craig McMillans last over to put Flintoff back on strike and he chalked up the final three runs required for victory. 

New Zealands batsmen failed to make the most of a bright start on a perfect day for batting at Bellerive Oval. 

Nathan Astle top scored with 45 off 63 balls but no one else made it to 30, even though everyone except Taylor made double figures. 

Flintoff and Paul Collingwood got two wickets each while Monty Panesar finished with one, but it was Anderson who did most of the damage, claiming three wickets with the new ball and another off the last ball of the innings. 

New Zealand signalled their intentions early when Brendon McCullum smacked the second ball of the match from Lewis high over extra cover for a six but it was not long before England were on top. 

Anderson dismissed McCullum when he spooned a catch to Vaughan at mid-off then bowled Stephen Fleming for 12 when the New Zealand skipper dragged a wide delivery back on to his stumps. 

Anderson struck again when Taylor, who made a sparkling 84 against Australia, mistimed a pull to Vaughan at cover before Collingwood bowled Astle when he was starting to look dangerous.

 Hingis pulls out of French Open

Paris: Former world No. 1 Martina Hingis has pulled out of the French Open with a hip injury, organisers said on Wednesday. 

The Swiss, who is yet to win the claycourt Grand Slam event, was joined on the withdrawal list by Russian Evgenia Linetskaya, who pulled out of the tournament for personal reasons. 

On the mens side, Thailands Paradorn Srichaphan and German Nicolas Kiefer will both miss the tournament due to wrist injuries. 

Hingis and Linetskaya will be replaced in the main draw by Swiss Emmanuelle Gagliardi and Denmarks Caroline Wozniacki, while Srichaphan and Kiefers places will be taken by Australian Chris Guccione and Italian Andreas Seppi. 

In doubt for the years second major is Tatiana Golovin because of an ankle injury. 

The French girl, who won her maiden WTA Tour title in Amelia Island last month, said the problem usually required about six weeks rest to cure. (Reuters)

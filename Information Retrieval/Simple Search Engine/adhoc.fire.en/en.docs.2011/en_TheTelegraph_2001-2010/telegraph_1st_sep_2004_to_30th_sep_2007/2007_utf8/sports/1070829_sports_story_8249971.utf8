 Gilchrist boost for ICL

Melbourne: The Indian Cricket League (ICL) might end up as a positive development for the game, Adam Gilchrist said. 

Gilchrist did not see anything bad in the rebel league. I dont see it as a particularly bad news story. Competition in the market place is always healthy, Gilchrist was quoted as saying by a daily here. 

And if that helps establish a better bond between players and the respective boards its great, he said. (PTI)

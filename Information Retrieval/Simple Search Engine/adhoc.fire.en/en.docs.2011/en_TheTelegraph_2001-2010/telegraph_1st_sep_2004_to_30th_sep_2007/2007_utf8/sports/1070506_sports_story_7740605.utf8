 Police probing Barton attack

London: Manchester Citys Ousmane Dabo has reported fellow mid-fielder Joey Barton to police after his teammate attacked him during training this week, Greater Manchester Police said on Saturday. 

Greater Manchester Police have received a report from a 30-year-old man that he was assaulted. Inquiries are ongoing, a police spokeswoman said. 

Frenchman Dabo needed hospital treatment after he was allegedly knocked out by a punch from Barton that earned Barton a club suspension for the remainder of the season, missing Saturdays derby against Manchester United. 

The incident followed a heated exchange after each caught the other with bad tackles in a practice game on Tuesday. (Reuters)

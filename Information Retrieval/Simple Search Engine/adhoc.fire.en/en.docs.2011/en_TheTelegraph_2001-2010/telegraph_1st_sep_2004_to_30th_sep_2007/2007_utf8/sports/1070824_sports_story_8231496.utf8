 Subhas bats for Bengal players

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Sports minister Subhas Chakraborty is willing to approach the BCCI, if needed, to ensure that the players, who have joined the Indian Cricket league (ICL), represent Bengal. 

The ICL is a different platform, but what is surprising is the way the BCCI has imposed ban on those who have agreed to play there. Im requesting the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) not to become severe towards the players (who have joined the ICL) and, instead, let them continue playing. 

If the CAB can allow them to play in County or Bangladesh as well as find no problem in outstation players playing here, why the objection to them playing in the ICL? If needed, Ill ask the BCCI to allow the players to represent Bengal in future, Chakraborty said on Thursday. 

He also lambasted the BCCI for sacking Kapil Dev as the NCA chairman, saying its a blot on the games image as a whole. 

Taking reference to the Kerry Packers World Series Cricket, Chakraborty maintained the ICL would provide more exposures to Indian cricket. 

The Kerry Packer formula was accepted later and todays game is essentially based on it. I hope the BCCI will treat the new league positively and let the game grow on a larger scale, he said.

 Madugalle 200 not out

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former Sri Lanka batsman Ranjan Madugalle became the first Match Referee to officiate in 200 ODIs during the Super Eight clash between England and Ireland in Georgetown on Friday. The next most experienced is Clive Lloyd (133). 

Before the match at Guyana National Stadium, ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed made a presentation to Madugalle in recognition of his enormous and ongoing contribution to the game, according to a release. 

I am happy that I have been able to discharge my duties in a professional way for the past few years, said Madugalle. 

It has been a fascinating experience graduating from being a player to being a match official and it has been great to work with different umpires, top captains and everyone involved with this great game, he said. 

I also feel honoured to have been part of the transitional phase in which the Match Referees profile increased from an enforcer of players on-field behaviour to effectively being chief executive of the match, he added.

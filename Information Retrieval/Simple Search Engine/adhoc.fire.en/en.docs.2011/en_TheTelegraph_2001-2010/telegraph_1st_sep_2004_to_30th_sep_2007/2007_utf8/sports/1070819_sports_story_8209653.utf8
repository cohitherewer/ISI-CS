 We can play even better: Bhutia

 - As we progress, our teamwork will be more compact

 Bhaichung Bhutia 

New Delhi: A day after registering one of their biggest wins, the Indian camp is bubbling with confidence. 

So much so that captain Bhaichung Bhutia announced that his teammates were capable of dishing out a much better display than they did against Cambodia. 

A 6-0 victory in any form of football is always special, Bhaichung said. But let me tell you that we are capable of better things. I am sure, as we progress into the tournament, our teamwork will be more compact. 

Teamwork figures on top of the priority list for the present lot of Indian footballers, courtesy Bob Houghton. The British coach gives so much importance to this aspect that he even refused to reveal his final squad for the Nehru Cup before talking to the excluded players personally. 

The Indians on Saturday spent the morning session in a relaxed manner. The coach didnt even call a team meeting and asked the players to report for a practice session at 4.30pm at a local college ground. 

Some footballers are upset that there is an attempt in some quarters to project Indias big win in poor light. 

It is difficult to score six goals even in a school match. Why undermine our achievement by raising questions about the standard of the opposition, asked Rennedy Singh. 

When it was pointed out that India didnt look too menacing against Cambodia, especially in the first half-an-hour, Bhaichung defended his boys. Thats our style of play. We were playing pressing football. You dont always get to watch individual brilliance in such type of football. 

The players are aware that they will have to encounter a bigger battle against Bangladesh on Monday. 

It will be more of a match against the personality of Nayeemuddin, admitted Syed Rahim Nabi. After all, he was our previous coach and had to leave the team under controversial circumstances. 

The injury to N.P. Pradeep is certainly a setback for Houghtons boys. In between trying to get Pradeep fit for the next match, Houghton has asked Mehrajuddin to be mentally prepared to come as a replacement.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 More needed than Pietersen heroics 

Derek Pringle

Its a knockout, with England hopefully springing their batman, rather than their joker, against South Africa at the Kensington Oval on Tuesday. 

Kevin Pietersen has yet to save Gotham City but his deeds with a cricket bat have prevented his team being overwhelmed to the point, incredibly, where victory over South Africa on Tuesday would almost certainly win them the fourth semi-final berth. 

Lose, however, and it is all over for England and the other theoretical contenders like West Indies and Bangladesh. 

Pietersen made his considerable reputation against the country of his birth, scoring three hundreds in six innings (all his one-day centuries have been in losing causes) under immense duress, during the limited-overs series there early in 2005. 

Yet the stakes, if not the levels of abuse, will be far higher this time, a situation that excites the boy from Pietermaritzburg. 

Its going to be a big game with a lot of needle, Pietersen said. South Africa are vulnerable in this World Cup because they dont have a spinner. But therell also be a lot of nerves in the game because its a quarter final. Whoever wins will be in St Lucia, facing the Aussies in the second semi-final. 

In different circumstances Pietersen might have been wearing South Africas green and gold rather than the royal blue of England. 

But lack of opportunity due to racial quotas (a reason disputed in South Africa) saw him seek his future with England, a decision he says sits easily, if not with Graeme Smith, then with most South Africans he meets. 

I think everyone knows we dont get on for whatever reasons, but thats done and dusted, Pietersen said. 

Its not about me or Graeme Smith, or Andre Nel and Michael Vaughan anyway, its about the collective effort and we need a big, big team performance on Tuesday. 

Although not overtly critical of his teammates, you sense he is frustrated by Englands batting here, which has mostly relied on the Pietersen show, certainly against the best teams like Australia and Sri Lanka. But then he is Englands best big-match batsman. 

I want to challenge myself against the best players in the world and to enjoy myself doing it, he said. When I wake up on Tuesday, a little trigger inside me, that I get when we play games against the really big nations, will switch on. 

Its an important game for me and Im going to play to the best of my ability. Hopefully that, and a load from the other players, will be good enough to get England to a semi-final. 

One of those players, Andrew Flintoff, is currently taking antibiotics prescribed to him on Saturday following tests for a persistent chest infection. 

Although Flintoff batted and bowled at the nets on Sunday, he has looked out of sorts for some time, though glandular fever, often the problem when sportsmen feel enervated without good reason, has been ruled out. 

The most likely culprit is an opportunistic infection taking hold in a man run down after a physically and emotionally demanding winter plus the odd late night out. 

Until he was dropped from the Canada match for disciplinary reasons, Flintoff would have played in every international match since the start of the Champions Trophy in early October. It is a feat only Ian Bell has managed, though without the pounding overs. 

Andrew Flintoff is a world-class performer, and world-class performers turn up for big, big games, Pietersen said. 

One thing for sure is that Freddie Flintoff is due and hopefully it will all come on Tuesday.

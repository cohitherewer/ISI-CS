The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Divided loyalty may come into play

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Biswanath Dutt, still an influential factor in Maidan politics, has decided to keep himself away from this years CAB elections but many believe Prasun Mukherjee will enjoy his support. 

But the clubs that are thought to be close to the former CAB president, may think twice before voting for candidates belonging to Mukherjees panel (Samar Paul, Amitava Banerjee and Tushar Sarkar). This could have a huge impact on the outcome of the elections. 

The annual general meeting will witness contests for the two joint secretaries and the treasurers posts. 

Initially we had thought of voting for candidates backed by the president. But both Saradindu Pal and Biswaroop Dey (Dalmiya backed) are close to many clubs that enjoy Dutts patronage. This may force us to ignore an unofficial diktat to vote for Mukherjees panel, a club representative said on Wednesday. 

Pranab Roys decision to join Indian Cricket League (ICL) has also sparked a debate, with some accusing Mukherjee of insulting former state players. 

There will be no contest for the vice-presidents posts. Arijit Roy of Measurers Club has decided to withdraw his candidacy on health grounds. Roys withdrawal means Russi Jeejeebhoy, Indranath Dey, Nemai Charan Dutta and Subhasish Sarkar will be the next vice-presidents. 

In another development, Dey has formally written to the CAB president requesting him to be neutral when conducting the polls on Saturday.

 McLaren ready to launch offensive 

KEVIN GARSIDE 

Nuerburgring: Thursday cannot come soon enough for Ron Dennis. The McLaren team principal sends one of the most expensively assembled legal teams in Formula One history into battle in Paris later this week to answer a charge of fraudulent conduct. 

Dennis has endured a torrid fortnight during which a series of systematic leaks, relating to the conduct of McLaren chief designer Mike Coughlan and the 780-page Ferrari dossier in his possession, have hacked away at the integrity of his team. 

McLarens lawyers formally submitted their case files to Formula Ones ruling body, the FIA, last Friday ahead of Thursdays hearing by the World Motor Sport Council. If found guilty, McLaren face censures ranging from a fine to expulsion from the constructors and drivers world championships. 

Dennis wasted no time in venting his spleen at those behind attempts to make capital out of McLarens position. The fact that sensitive information from investigations in Italy and the High Court in London found its way into Italian newspapers first would suggest that the sources of the leaks were Italian. 

I am eager to get into the process and put it behind us, Dennis said. Probably few people really understand what the circumstances surrounding this process are. Or they certainly lack the understanding of the deeper implications of not adhering to the instructions of the court. The High Court ruling led ultimately to three recipients of Mike Coughlans affidavit being told in no uncertain terms that it was privileged information, and that they would be committing a legal breach in the event of any of it being shared with third parties. 

I am sure the FIA understands the nature of the court order, so I can only assume the other parties who had this material have chosen to share distorted excerpts with other people. 

It is important to remember that it is the sworn statement of one individual and, as such, one would expect it to be the truth as he sees it. But weve not had any input in the process. Up until today I have not even acknowledged that Mike Coughlan is the suspended employee. There is a way to go through life and that is to follow the correct procedures. 

If other people choose to go down a different path that leads to the very damaging process where people have seen fit to make derogatory remarks about the integrity of McLaren, fine. But thats not my style. 

We have given a full dossier to the FIA. The FIA are going through a process. If there are any unanswered questions after that, we will provide them. The Daily Telegraph

 Dr Joshi to operate on Habibur

OUR BUREAU

Calcutta/New Delhi: Key defender Habibur Rehman Mondal, who has suffered a torn cartilage on his right knee during the pre-Olympic camp in Calcutta, has flown to Mumbai on Monday night for an immediate operation. 

According to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources, the Mohammedan Sporting defender, who was enjoying a highly successful season, will be operated upon by famous Mumbai surgeon Dr Anant Joshi and could be out of action for at least four weeks. All cost for the operation will be borne by the federation. 

Injury to Habibur, one of the best players of the team, was not the only problem that the Indian team encountered on Monday. According to team sources, the players were made to sit in the lobby for quite a few hours when they checked into a reputed city hotel in the morning. 

Twenty rooms were booked by the federation at least two days ago and even the list of the players who will share the rooms was submitted to them, said a team official. 

Yet, the hotel management gave us only 11 rooms in the morning and some of the boys were forced to sit in the lobby. 

Finally, they offered just one room for those who were sitting in the lobby to change their dress and go for practice. We were allotted our rooms well after we returned from the ground and that, too, after much persuasion, the official said.

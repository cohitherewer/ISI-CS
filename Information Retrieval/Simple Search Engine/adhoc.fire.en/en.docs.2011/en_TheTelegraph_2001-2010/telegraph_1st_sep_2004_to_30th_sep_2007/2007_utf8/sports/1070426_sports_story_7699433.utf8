Colombo: Cricket fever has gripped Sri Lanka, diverting attention at least for the time being from a worsening civil war. 

Cricket-mad fans sat glued to their television sets until the early hours of Wednesday morning to watch Sri Lanka defeat New Zealand by 81 runs in the first semi-final in Kingston. 

The success of the team in the Caribbean has provided a welcome distraction from the worsening military conflict between the government and Tamil Tigers, which has left a 2002 ceasefire agreement in tatters. 

The two-decade civil war, which has claimed around 68,000 lives, has intensified in the past year with almost daily battles, denting business confidence and contributing to spiralling inflation. 

But for now, cricket is in focus. 

You can feel this great sense of excitement and growing feeling of confidence that Sri Lanka really can win this tournament, former Sri Lanka batsman and selector Sidath Wettimuny said. 

Victory will be a huge boost to everybody considering the countrys situation, giving all Sri Lankans a great sense of pride. 

Multi-faith religious ceremonies are being planned in the lead-up to Saturdays big game to bless the team, and President Mahinda Rajapaksa will even fly to Bridgetown for the final. 

As the excitement has built, businesses are cashing in on the teams success, especially bars, clubs and restaurants that have erected giant TV screens to show the matches live. 

Everyone is getting behind the team and that has ensured record sales for us during the past month, said Harpo Gooneratne, the owner of the popular Bay Leaf restaurant in central Colombo. 

The Excise Department has even delayed the start of an alcohol sales ban for Buddhist Wesak holidays by one day. It will now come into effect after the World Cup final. 

An estimated 14 million people, or 65 per cent of the islands population, watched Sri Lanka thrash New Zealand, said a spokeswoman for state broadcaster Rupavahini, which owns exclusive terrestrial television rights for the tournament. 

Advertising sales have soared, with the price of a 30-second spot increasing by 150 per cent, she said. 

Even many Tamil Tigers, who control swathes of land in the north and east of the country and are fighting for independence, are watching. 

There are people in the controlled areas watching, rebel military spokesman Rasiah Ilanthiraiyan said. 

But he added: Our activities will not change because of these matches. These matches are not going to make any difference. 

Win or lose Saturdays final, the team will get a ticker-tape reception when they return home, with plans already underway for a public parade from the airport and a ceremony in Independence Square. 

An attempt earlier in the tournament by Amnesty International to use cricket as a vehicle for drawing attention to the deteriorating Human Rights situation in the island created a public furore.

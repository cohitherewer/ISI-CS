The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ill play final Test if Im destined to

A CORRESPONDENT

Leicester: Ranadeb Bose got a five-wicket haul in Leicester on Friday, but he is not taking a Test berth at The Oval for granted. 

Ive done my job Now its up to the team management Im grateful to all the team members for the confidence they have shown in me. 

Maybe I will feel bad if I dont get a chance at The Oval. But the experiences gained on this tour will be of immense help. I will play if I am destined to. But I am not thinking about it at the moment, he told a press conference. 

I never thought I would play for India. Ill not have any regrets too if I dont get a chance in the third Test. Zaheer Khan is the most experienced, R.P. Singh and Sreesanth have been with the team long enough to merit a place I cannot hope to replace them, he said. 

Former captain Sourav Ganguly also praised his efforts. He bowled well he has done his job. The more he plays, the better for him. He has improved a lot since joining the team.

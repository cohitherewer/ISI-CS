 Argentina seeking revenge vs Brazil 

 - Copa America final Dunga describes rivals as favourites 

Maracaibo: Argentina have Brazil right where they want them in the final of the Copa America. 

Irked by the way in which they lost the Copa final to Brazil three years ago in Peru, Argentina were glad both teams set up a rematch in the final on Sunday. 

Argentina were moments from winning the 2004 final in injury time until Adriano scored for 2-2 in the last act of regulation, forcing a penalty shootout in which Brazil prevailed 4-2. 

Its a thorn I still have nailed to my back and I want to take it out, Argentinas Carlos Tevez said upon arriving in Venezuela three weeks ago. 

That defeat, the first by Argentina to Brazil in nine Copa finals, made it easier for coach Alfio Basile to convince some of his best players to keep their boots on after the long European season. They havent disappointed, justifying their pre-tournament favouritism by sailing through the first South American championship hosted by Venezuela. 

Inspired performances by Lionel Messi, Tevez and Juan Roman Riquelme have helped the Albiceleste to a perfect 5-0 record, racking up a tournament-best 16 goals. 

However, since making the final, the Argentines have been determined to play down hype that they were out to pay back Brazil. 

To focus in on the word revenge generates an obsession that can have a negative impact on the teams psychological health, midfielder Esteban Cambiasso said. For us, the game is great opportunity to be crowned champions, against a rival that we all want to play. 

Argentina midfielder Esteban Cambiasso, however, said that he was not even contemplating losing to Brazil. 

It hasnt crossed my mind that Argentina could lose the final, said Cambiasso. I still havent thought about it and I hope I dont have to. 

Cambiasso was not in the team which were beaten on penalties in 2004. 

Basile has named an unchanged Argentina side for the final. According to him, Carlos Tevez would partner Lionel Messi in attack while Hernan Crespo, who has recovered from a sprained thigh muscle, would start on the bench. 

It was an easy decision, Tevez has been playing and he has done well while Crespo has not played for 12 days, said Basile. 

Brazil coach Dunga on Friday declared Argentina as favourites to win the final. 

From what Argentina have done so far, they are the favourites, he told reporters. Weve done our part by reaching the final, now we have to surpass that. But I always want to win, this is a final and anything can happen, he added. 

We have conviction in our work, we knew it would not be easy, that there would be innumerable difficulties on the way. 

Argentina is a mature team which has played together before, Brazil is a new team with only two players from the last World Cup, added Dunga. 

Unlike Argentina, Brazil were blown off by Ronaldinho and Kaka, who wanted a holiday. Robinho, whose six goals make him the tournaments top scorer, has filled in nicely but Brazils younger team has still been inconsistent. 

They opened with a 0-2 loss to Mexico, edged Ecuador 1-0 in their last group match, crushed Chile 6-1 in the quarter finals, and needed a penalty shootout to knock out Uruguay in the semi-finals.

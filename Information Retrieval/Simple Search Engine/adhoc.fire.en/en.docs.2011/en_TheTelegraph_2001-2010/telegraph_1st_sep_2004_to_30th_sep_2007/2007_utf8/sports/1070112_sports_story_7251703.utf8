 EB post 3-1 victory over HASC

Bangalore: East Bengal cashed in on local outfit HASCs lackadaisical approach to garner full points from their 11th National Football League (NFL) second round tie for the ONGC Cup with a convincing 3-1 victory here on Thursday. 

Although the glamour side led by two first half goals, it was HASC who put the visitors under pressure by scoring early in the second half through Kuttymani at the Bangalore Football Stadium. 

However, HASC failed to convert the chances that came their way before a 80th minute goal by substitute Izumi Arata sealed their fate. 

East Bengal drew first blood through an Ashim Biswas right footer off Kenyan Boniface N. Ambanis cross from the right, making the most of a defensive lapse. 

Gumphe Rime failed to collect Ashims goalbound effort after both HASC defenders Pawan Kumar and Prashanth Jaggi did very little. 

Unable to come out of this first goal bungle, Rime fumbled again 17 minutes later, as Bibiano Fernandes shot on the run when Biswas squared the ball to him. 

East Bengals two-goal cushion lasted only till two minutes into the second half, throwing the match wide open. 

HASC Captain Xavier Vijay Kumars cross was headed back by Nanda Kumar for a well-positioned Kuttymani to make it 1-2. 

The crowd began vacating the ground once Arata scored from the near post following substitute Chandan Das lob 10 minutes from close with Rime rooted under the bar. 

Biswas, adjudged Man of the Match, was instrumental in the first two goals.

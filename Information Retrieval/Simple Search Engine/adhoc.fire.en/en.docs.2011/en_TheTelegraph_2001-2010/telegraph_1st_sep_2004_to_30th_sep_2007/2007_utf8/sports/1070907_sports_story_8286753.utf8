 Chelsea deny Ballack rumour

 Michael Ballack 

London: Chelsea have denied that Germany captain Michael Ballack has been left out of their Champions League squad because he has no future with the London club. 

Playmaker Ballack has failed to produce his top form since joining from Bayern Munich last year and has not played for Chelsea since April because of an ankle injury. 

Chelsea Football Club would like to reiterate that Michael Ballacks omission from the Uefa Champions League group phase squad was taken only because of injury, a club statement said.

 Inquest delay

Kingston: The inquest into the death of Bob Woolmer has been delayed with the coroners office still awaiting a police report five days after the inquiry was ordered. 

Sources in the coroners office, which was expecting the report Tuesday, said coroner Patrick Murphy had not yet received the report from the police but they have begun the process of summoning potential jurors. 

But deputy commissioner of police Mark Shields said the report, which is virtually ready, will be sent as soon as possible. 

Asked if this meant by the end of the week, Shields told a local newspaper, Certainly. Yes, yes. (PTI)

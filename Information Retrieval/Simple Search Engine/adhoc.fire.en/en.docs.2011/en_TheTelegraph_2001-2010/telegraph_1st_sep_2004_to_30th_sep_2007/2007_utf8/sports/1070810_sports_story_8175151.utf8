 Alonso and I not at war: Hamilton

Woking: Formula One leader Lewis Hamilton says he is not at war with McLaren teammate Fernando Alonso and the two drivers are back on speaking terms following their dispute at the Hungarian Grand Prix. 

For the record, Fernando and I are fiercely competitive and respectful of each other, Hamilton said in a statement released on Thursday by McLaren. We are both ambitious drivers who want to win. However, we are not drivers at war, as has been widely reported. 

The rookie British driver initially refused to let Alonso by at the start of the final 15-minute qualifying session in Hungary, despite instructions to do so over the team radio. The Spaniard then impeded Hamilton in the pitlane, preventing him from setting another lap at full speed lap and winning pole position. 

Alonso was demoted from pole position to sixth on the grid for the incident. Hamilton won the race on Sunday for his third victory of the season, with Alonso fourth. 

Although we did not speak on Sunday, we have spoken since the weekend and continue to have a professional working relationship, Hamilton said on Thursday. In fact, Fernando and I plan to meet up over the holiday period. 

The FIA penalised McLaren by withholding the 15 points the team won in the constructors championship in Hungary. Hamilton has an 80-73 lead over two-time champion Alonso in the drivers standings with six races left. 

As an individual in my first year in Formula One I have done my utmost to conduct myself in a professional and open manner, Hamilton said. Of course, I have made mistakes, not least during the last weekend, and those are open to public scrutiny. 

However it is disappointing that inflammatory and untrue material is given to the media and published which may damage reputations. 

McLaren also denied that Hamilton had used a vulgar expletive in a heated conversation with team boss Ron Dennis over the team radio after the qualifying session.

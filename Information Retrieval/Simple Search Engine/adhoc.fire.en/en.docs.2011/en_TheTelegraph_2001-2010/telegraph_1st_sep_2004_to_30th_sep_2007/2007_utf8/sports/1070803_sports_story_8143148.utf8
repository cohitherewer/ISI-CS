 BCCI is scared of ICL, says Kapil 

 Kapil Dev 

New Delhi: Indias World Cup winning captain Kapil Dev again came down heavily on the cricket board on Thursday, saying it was scared of the Indian Cricket League (ICL). 

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has warned current players against joining the new venture. 

Hitting out at the BCCI move, Kapil said that it should not be threatening players because they cannot perform under fear. 

The BCCI is scared of the ICL. That is the only reason it is not willing to talk to us, Kapil, who is the ICL executive board chairman, told a television channel. He also reacted strongly to the BCCI president Sharad Pawars comment that the new league would be a flop as it would fail to find enough spectators. 

The statement the BCCI president has made is shameful. If the BCCI thinks that only the national XI can attract crowds, then it should stop conducting any domestic tournament, he said. 

The BCCI is like a king and I am its subject. If it wants to sack me from the NCA then I cannot stop it, he said. 

The PCB has also followed the Indian counterparts suit. Our policy on this ICL is crystal clear. No current player can go and play there while even our former players who hold jobs with us cant accept any offers, PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf said. (PTI)

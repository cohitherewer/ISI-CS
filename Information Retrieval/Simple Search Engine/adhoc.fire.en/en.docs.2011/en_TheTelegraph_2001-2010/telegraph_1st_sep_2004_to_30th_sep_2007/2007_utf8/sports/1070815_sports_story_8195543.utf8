 WI recall Collins

Bridgetown: Left-arm fast bowler Pedro Collins has been recalled to the West Indies squad for the ICC World Twenty20 meet after a year in the wilderness. 

The 31-year-old received the news shortly after returning to Barbados from a professional contract in Newcastle, England. 

I think my recall was long overdue, Collins told reporters. I was being overlooked and I was wondering why. 

I was waiting my turn to play for the West Indies again and now my turn has come. Im delighted to be back in the team and I have a point to prove. 

Left-handed batsman Narsingh Deonarine, who last played two years ago in Sri Lanka, was also recalled. 

The team will be led by Ramnaresh Sarwan, who has recovered from a shoulder injury sustained on the recent tour of England.

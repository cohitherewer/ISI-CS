 Mourinho draws first blood

 Mourinho 

Jos Mourinho has begun the mind games in the build-up to the FA Cup final between Chelsea and Manchester United at Wembley on Saturday by launching another thinly veiled attack on Cristiano Ronaldo, Uniteds Portugal winger. 

The Chelsea manager had been critical of his compatriot as the Premier League title race reached its climax, calling him a liar and mocking his lack of education, but on Wednesday returned to one of his favourite themes by warning Ronaldo not to spoil Wembleys show-piece occasion by diving. 

Mourinho also sought to put pressure on Steve Bennett, the referee for the final, by expressing the hope that he would enjoy an anonymous afternoon. 

I hope Ronaldo enjoys the game like I hope Im going to enjoy it and we can make Portugal proud of us, Mourinho said. I hope he plays well, has no injuries and, as the big player he is and wants to be, is fair with his opponents. 

I would be very disappointed if some of the players were diving and provoking, and trying to get people red cards. And I think Mr Bennett has enough experience and has had a very discreet season. 

I think being low-profile is the best quality a referee can have. I would be very, very sad, very disappointed, if the final is not a good event, a fair event, without problems, with a good winner and a proud loser. 

Mourinhos latest dig at Ronaldo will not go down well with Sir Alex Ferguson, the United manager, whose desire for a good match on Saturday seemed more sincere. We want to see a good final and I think it would be fitting, Ferguson said. Im pleased were there because when we were knocked out last year I was hoping it wouldnt be finished as we wanted to be one of the teams at the new Wembley. I think it will be a good game because there are fantastic players on both sides. 

While United have enjoyed a settled build-up, Chelsea continue to be troubled by injury, with Mourinho Wednesday casting doubt over the ability of Ashley Cole and Arjen Robben to play for 90 minutes and describing John Obi Mikel as a big risk, despite his recovery from a hamstring injury. 

Mourinho may also have been concerned to discover that he will not be given huge funds to strengthen the squad this summer.

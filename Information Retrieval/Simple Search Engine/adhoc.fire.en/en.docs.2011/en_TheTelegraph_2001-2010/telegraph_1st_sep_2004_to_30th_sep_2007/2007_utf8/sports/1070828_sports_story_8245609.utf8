 Klinsmann likely to coach LA Galaxy

 - Former Germany striker is comfortable dealing with high-profile players

Juergen Klinsmann could be about to take over as the head coach of the Los Angeles Galaxy after Frank Yallop, the incumbent, admitted to feeling the strain of managing a losing team under an increased media glare since the signing of David Beckham. 

The Galaxy have only three wins in 17 games this season and their hopes of reaching the Major League Soccer (MLS) play-offs are dwindling after the 0-3 defeat on Thursday by Chivas USA. 

Beckhams contributions have been restricted by injury, but the hype surrounding the former England captain has been undiminished, especially since his recall to the national team. 

Its not been easy because of the spotlight thrust on us, Yallop said. AEG, the Galaxy owner, has invested $250 million in the Beckham project and expected more in return. Unfortunately for Yallop, Klinsmann, who is comfortable in the international spotlight, not to mention more familiar with dealing with high-profile players, is more or less on their doorstep. 

The former Germany striker, who has not had a coaching job since he left Germany after the 2006 World Cup finals, lives near the beaches of Orange County, about 20 minutes drive south of the Galaxy base in Carson, where he was seen last week, though that is not unusual. 

He worked as a technical adviser for the Galaxy in the 2004 season before accepting the offer to coach Germany, is a regular visitor to the ground and has even played there in a testimonial match. 

AEG powerbrokers are believed to have sounded out the former Tottenham Hotspur forward. However, he wants to stay in southern California and is not interested in anything other than a high-profile job, so the Galaxy appear to fit the bill. He turned down the head coach position with the US team last December over issues of executive control. 

Certainly, Klinsmann would expect to be allowed to select teams based on footballing rather than marketing reasons, and he would have been big enough to tell both Beckham and the clubs front office that he was not fit to play against Chivas. 

Yallop, according to a local reporter, looked haggard after the Chivas game and cancelled training the next day. Alexi Lalas, the Galaxy general manager, has always expressed full confidence in Yallop, but the coach may walk before Lalas feels he has to push him. 

Beckham did not even travel to Sundays match against the Colorado Rapids (which they lost 0-3), when Yallop was also set to be without up to seven other first-team regulars, including Landon Donovan, the United States forward. 

 There has been talk that Donovan might return to San Jose. That would allow the Galaxy to sign another player who does not fit under the salary cap, and, if Klinsmann is in charge, expect that player to be a member of the 2006 Germany squad.

Mumbai: In the wake of the Indian teams showing in South Africa, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has decided to act tough when the selectors meet in Rajkot on Friday. 

I am going to tell the selectors to have a deep look at the non-performing players when choosing the team. I am talking on behalf of the Boards members who also feel in similar fashion. They (selectors) have to review the players performance, secretary Niranjan Shah said. 

Shah said he could not give a directive to the selectors to drop a particular player, but could tell them broadly what they were required to do following the teams 0-4 loss in ODIs and 1-2 loss in Tests to South Africa. 

I cannot say how many players will be dropped. Its entirely up to the selectors. But I will certainly ask them to have a re-look at the players performance, he said. 

The selection committee should not go only by the history of some players Consistent performance is important. 

Virender Sehwag faces the axe after a disastrous performance in South Africa. 

The selection panel, headed by Dilip Vengsarkar, will choose the 30 probables for the March-April World Cup in the West Indies as well as choose the squad for the first two home ODIs against the West Indies. 

The first ODI is scheduled in Nagpur on January 21 followed by the second in Cuttack three days later. 

Meanwhile, the players contract will be taken up by the BCCI within the next few days. 

We will be sending the senior players a draft copy of the contract around January 13 or 14 to get their feedback before they are signed, Shah said. 

The BCCI wants performance-linked pay structure to be introduced from this year and it remains to be seen how well it goes with the players who, at present, may not have much bargaining power in the wake of their performance. 

Dressing room damage 

Meanwhile, after the disappointing 1-2 Test series defeat, more embarrassment seems to be in store for India as Cricket South Africa (CSA) is planning to send a bill claiming recovery for the damages done by the tourists during celebrations of the Wanderers win in the dressing room, says a report from Cape Town. 

It is learnt that Gauteng Cricket Association (GCA), the host body, is moving their parent body CSA to seek compensation from the BCCI for the damages done by the players in the dressing room while celebrating their first Test win.

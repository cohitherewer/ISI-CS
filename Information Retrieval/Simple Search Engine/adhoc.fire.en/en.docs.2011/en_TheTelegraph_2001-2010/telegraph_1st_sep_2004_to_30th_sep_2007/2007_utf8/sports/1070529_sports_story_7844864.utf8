 As a coach Im still learning: Whatmore

Dhaka: Dav Whatmore is keeping a cool head. He knows the next few days will be crucial for him. 

Talking to Indian journalists at a Dhaka hotel on Monday, Whatmore said he was aware of the problems faced by former coach Greg Chappell and had the confidence to handle such things. 

I dont want to comment on Gregs methods. I personally know him and he is a fantastic person. 

India have a rich cricketing tradition and there will be a lot of superstars. So a coach should be able to communicate differently with different players. 

He must be able to do the right thing at the right time, Whatmore said. 

A day after India recorded their biggest Test victory in Whatmores farewell match, he made it clear that he didnt have any regrets or legacy to leave behind. 

There has been a lot of speculation, but I am not Indias coach yet. To say that I have already been appointed is not true. It is just that I had a talk with the BCCI, he clarified. 

Asked what made him interested in taking up the India job, Whatmore said: It is a logical extension to a bigger challenge. As a coach, Im still learning and going to India will be the right step towards that. 

After four years in Bangladesh you need a different challenge. The Bangladesh Cricket Board had asked me to continue after the World Cup, but I thought it was time to move forward and seek a new atmosphere, a new challenge, the 53-year-old, who played 7 Tests and one ODI, pointed out. 

It is also a humbling experience for me to see that so many countries have approached me. It makes me feel that I am a little capable for this job, said Whatmore, who was also sounded out by Pakistan. 

When The Telegraph asked him what would be his blueprint for India if he got the job, Whatmore said: Honestly speaking, I have not given much thought to it and Im still waiting for the June 4 meeting (of the BCCI special committee to select the new coach). 

However, I always believe winning is important, so is the players self-belief. 

He said that he would have preferred a break following his four-year stint with Bangladesh, but hes prepared to take the Indian challenge from next month itself. 

About a coachs shelf life, Whatmore said: It relates to the success they have had and does not necessarily deal with the World Cup every four years. 

Is he leaving any legacy behind? 

I dont believe in such philosophy. I wanted a process to be in place and players tried their best to respond to it. Bangladesh are still in a developing process. 

What they need is consistency, Whatmore said.

 Maria moves up, Safin falls

Paris: Venus Williams unleashed the fastest serve by a woman at a Grand Slam as the American kept the Stars and Stripes fluttering at the French Open on Wednesday. 

Just hours after Robby Ginepris 4-6, 6-1, 7-5, 4-6, 2-6 defeat by Argentinas Diego Hartfield condemned the US men to their worst showing at Roland Garros in at least 40 years, Williams lit up a dank Court One with a 206 kmph thunderbolt. 

The milestone, a shade slower than Brenda Schultz-McCarthys overall record of 209 kmph hit in qualifying in Cincinnati last July, made up for an otherwise unimpressive 6-1, 7-6 second-round victory over fellow-American Ashley Harkleroad. 

I loved it. I lost my focus a little bit because I saw the 206, said Williams, who had let slip a 5-1 lead in the second set. 

I was so excited because I broke my record. 

The defeat of Ginepri, the last of nine US male competitors to fall in Paris, meant that for the first time in 34 years no American man had reached the second round of one of the four majors. 

Maria Sharapova showed there was no room for sentiment when she led a batch of Russian seeds into the second round. 

Playing under menacing clouds and in a rush to get off court before the heavens opened again over Roland Garros, the world No. 2 was in unforgiving mood as local darling Emilie Loit hobbled around the court with a thigh strain. 

Sharapova made light of her own patched-up shoulder as she powered to a 6-3, 7-6 victory. She was joined in the last-64 by 2006 runner-up Svetlana Kuznetsova and ninth seed Anna Chakvetadze a 6-2 6-3 winner over Australias Alicia Molik. 

Wimbledon champion Amelie Mauresmo began her 13th tilt at winning her home Grand Slam with a 6-0, 7-5 triumph over American Laura Granville. 

Kuznetsova avenged one of the most painful defeats of her career when she blew fellow-Russian Ekaterina Bychkova off court 6-0, 6-3. 

The third seed was humiliated by Bychkova at the 2005 US Open when she became the first defending champion to lose in the opening round. 

Fast forward two years and Bychkova felt the full force of Kuznetsovas wrath. 

The roller-coaster careers of another pair of Russians former champion Anastasia Myskina and 22nd seed Marat Safin took another nosedive. 

Making her comeback after undergoing foot surgery in January, Myskina was embarrassed 1-6, 0-6 by American Meghann Shaughnessy. 

Defending champion Justine Henin made light work of Austrias Tamira Paszek, cruising into the third round with a 7-5, 6-1 victory. 

Safin raged, rolled in the red dirt and smashed a racket but his histrionics could not prevent a 6-4, 6-4, 7-5 mauling by Serb Janko Tipsarevic in the second round. (Reuters)

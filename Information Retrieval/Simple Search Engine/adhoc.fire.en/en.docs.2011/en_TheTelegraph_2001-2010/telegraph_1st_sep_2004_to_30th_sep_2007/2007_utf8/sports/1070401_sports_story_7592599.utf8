 Wet outfield plays spoilsport

 - Umpires hopeful of delayed start

St Johns: The start of Australias match against Bangladesh in the World Cup Super Eight on Saturday was delayed because heavy overnight rain soaked the outfield. 

Umpires Billy Bowden and Aleem Dar made several inspections of the pitch at Antiguas Sir Vivian Richards Stadium and continually put back the scheduled 9:30 am (13:30 GMT) start. 

The outfield was especially patchy and sparse on the slope toward the northern end of the ground, with sand scattered about to dry the soggy turf. The umpires were concerned that players could get injured slipping over. But they expected play to start Saturday rather than being held over to Sundays reserve day after clouds broke to let through warm, drying sunshine. Its drying out very naturally and hopefully we can get a game, Dar said. 

The super-sopper worked only intermittently, so a lone groundsman tried to move some moisture away with a hand-pushed roller and volunteers trod down pieces of foam to soak up water from the worst affected areas. Fans in the sparse crowd tried to find alternative entertainment. 

Australia captain Ricky Ponting, who on Friday twice bowled Andrew Symonds in training, continued to show his all-round sporting prowess by cleanly punting an Aussie rules football to fans. Loud cheers greeted each catch. 

Australia fans in the west stand, some wearing gold and green body paint instead of shirts, splashed about in the pitchside pool under the big video screen and slapped around an inflatable beach ball to the reggae music pumped from huge stadium speakers. There was a further inspection scheduled at 12:45 pm (local time).

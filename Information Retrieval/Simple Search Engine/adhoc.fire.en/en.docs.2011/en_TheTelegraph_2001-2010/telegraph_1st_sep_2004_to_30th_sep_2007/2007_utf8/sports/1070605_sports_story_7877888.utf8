 Jayasuriya rested for Tests

Colombo: Discarded former Sri Lanka captain Maravan Atapattu will make a comeback this month against Bangladesh after selectors decided to rest veteran Sanath Jayasuriya in the Test series. 

Atapattu, whose last Test match was in December 2005 against India in Ahmedabad, was overlooked by the selectors throughout the World Cup in the West Indies. 

The 37-year-old faced a similar fate in the 1996 World Cup which Sri Lanka won. 

We will give Jayasuriya a rest in the Tests but he is most likely to be included in the one-day series, a Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) source said on Monday. 

The Bangladeshis are due to arrive in a fortnight for a three-match Test and one-day series under their new captain Mohammed Ashraful. 

The first Test starting June 25 was to have been played at the R. Premadasa Stadium but has been shifted to the SSC ground. (AFP)

 ITF to examine Belgians bribery claim 

Mark Hodgkinson

London: The International Tennis Federation (ITF) are keen to talk to Gilles Elseneer, after the little-known Belgian player alleged he was offered a bribe of 70,000 to throw his first-round match against Italian Potito Starace at Wimbledon in 2005. 

Elseneer claims he refused the offer, as Wimbledon meant everything to me and it was impossible to contemplate deliberately losing the match. He went on to beat Starace in straight sets. 

Elseneer was on Thursday quoted as telling the Belgian media that the approach came from a figure who is active in the tennis world, but not a player or a coach. I thought at first it was a joke because it involved an awful lot of money. But rest assured that it happens a lot, he reportedly a television station in Belgium. 

Bill Babcock, the ITFs grand slam co-ordinator, indicated that they would like to speak to Elseneer, although he emphasised that the 29-year-old from Brussels did not appear to have committed an offence, since he turned down the offer to throw the contest. 

The ITFs president, Francesco Ricci Bitti, admitted that the sports integrity was threatened by the potential problems thrown up by the betting industry, and especially online gambling. It is important that we are vigilant, said Bitti. 

A spokesman for the ATP, the body who control mens tennis away from the slams, emphasised on Thursday that any player proven to have been involved in match-fixing would be banned for life.

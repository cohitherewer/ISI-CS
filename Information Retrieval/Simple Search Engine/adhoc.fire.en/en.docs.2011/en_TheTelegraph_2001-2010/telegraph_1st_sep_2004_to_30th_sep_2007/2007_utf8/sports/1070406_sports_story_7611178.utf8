 Inzy blames it on senior batsmen

 Inzamam-ul Haq 

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq on Thursday blamed the teams first-round exit from the World Cup on poor performances of the senior players. 

Speaking in front of a committee appointed by the Pakistan Cricket Board to evaluate the World Cup debacle, Inzamam said poor batting had led to their early elimination. 

He said the senior players had not delivered as expected although the bowlers did their best, a member of the committee said. 

Pakistan were knocked out of the tournament after they were beaten by the West Indies and debutants Ireland in two of their three group-phase matches and Inzamam relinquished his captaincy before flying back home. 

Their coach, Bob Woolmer died the day after the Ireland defeat. Jamaican police are investigating his death as a murder. 

Inzamam also stressed that the standard of domestic cricket needs to be improved if Pakistan are to regain their stature in world cricket. 

He said there was need to have more quality cricket instead of quantity. And unless the domestic structure was improved Pakistan would always struggle to be consistent, the committee member said. 

The committee is headed by former Test player Ejaz Butt and includes Saleem Altaf and Salahuddin Ahmed, two well-known and senior faces in Pakistan cricket. 

In another development, Inzamam also suggested to have one captain for both the Test and one-day sides for practical reasons. 

I just feel that when you have one captain the players are also comfortable in both formats of the game as they know their captains style and thinking. It is not easy for players to adjust under different captains in different forms of the game, he said. 

On the charges that he was an autocratic captain and ran a one-man show, Inzamam said in the Pakistan cricket history their were quite a few captains who were strong and did things their own way. 

Imran Khan is a prime example. He was a very strong captain compared to others. So if I tried to be strong what is wrong with that. But to say I didnt consult the selectors or other players while taking decisions is wrong. I always believed in seeking other opinion before deciding on something important regarding the team, Inzamam said. 

Inzamam disclosed that he had also wanted to announce his retirement from Test cricket but some of his friends advised him against doing this. 

I was terribly disappointed after what happened in the World Cup and I wanted to announce my total retirement. But my friends said I can still contribute a lot to the team in Test cricket, the 37-year-old batsman said. (Agencies)

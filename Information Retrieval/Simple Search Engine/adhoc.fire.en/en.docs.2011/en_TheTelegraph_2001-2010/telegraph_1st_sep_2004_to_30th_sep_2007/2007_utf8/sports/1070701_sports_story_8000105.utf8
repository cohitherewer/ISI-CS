 Indias chance for a rare triumph

Belfast: India will depend heavily on their strong batting line-up for a morale-boosting overseas series triumph as they go into the third and final one-day International against South Africa here on Sunday. The series is levelled 1-1. 

The six-wicket victory in the second game on Friday has not only restored parity in the three-match series but has also presented India with an ideal opportunity to revive their sagging fortunes following the World Cup debacle. 

Captain Dravid has said the viral flu that affected nearly two-third of the team has proved to be a blessing in disguise as it had helped India discover a couple of new talents. 

Indias pace department bore the brunt of the bug as seamers Sreesanth and Ajit Agarkar were laid down by illness and sat out of the two matches played so far. 

Their absence forced the team to go in with two slow bowlers, offie Ramesh Powar and rookie leg-spinner Piyush Chawla. Both acquitted themselves well, particularly the 18-year-old Chawla who had played just one match before the series. 

One of the really gladdening things for me is to have seen how these young spinners have bowled, especially in these tough conditions, Dravid said on the eve of the decider. 

They are used to playing in India, where it is warm and sunny and the ball grips and turns. But they have come here and immediately adjusted. 

Sachin Tendulkar, who has shown glimpses of his vintage form with scores of 99 and 93 in the series, will have to play a big role in the crucial game at Stormont where India will again miss the services of paceman Sreesanth, who has not recovered from flu. 

Agarkar, who was out for the last two matches with cold and fever, was expected to be available for the game. 

South Africa, on the other hand, would like to field a full-strength side which would ideally have seamer Dale Steyn, who was down with flu, and Justin Kemp, nursing a leg injury. 

Dales come a long way, while Kemp has been having treatment and hopefully, by Sunday well have a full squad to choose from, said South African captain Jacques Kallis.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Match Referees to have final say

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The ICC Chief Executive 

 Committee has recommended an amendment to the ICC Playing 

 Condition that relates to Law 21.3 (Umpires awarding 

 a match). 

According to an ICC media release, the members of CEC have recommended that the final decision in relation to the termination of a match should rest with the Match Referee. This recommendation, which is obviously a fall-out of the Oval fiasco involving Darrell Hair and Pakistan, will be considered by the ICC Board in South Africa in March. 

 The two-day CEC meeting also considered a range of 

 issues relating to anti-doping. The members of the committee 

 agreed that the ICC should take an active role in monitoring 

 the anti-doping programmes of its members on Saturday.

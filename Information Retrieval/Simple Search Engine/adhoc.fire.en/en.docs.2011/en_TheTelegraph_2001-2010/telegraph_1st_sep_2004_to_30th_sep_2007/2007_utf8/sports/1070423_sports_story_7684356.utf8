The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 More than just an entertainer: Fleming 

As Brian Lara brought the curtains down on his 17-year, record-breaking international career on Saturday, contemporaries and former players saluted the legend. The following are some reactions (alphabetically): 

MARK BOUCHER: I learnt things keeping behind him and watching him play. Brian and I have played a lot of golf. So Im hoping to continue that rivalry... He has been a gentleman on the field and off. 

STEPHEN FLEMING: I heard him say he wanted to be an entertainer; he was all that and more. He was a player who created interest in New Zealand and around the world so he brought more players to the game. He was inspirational to watch and play against. 

MATTHEW HAYDEN: Brian is probably unheralded as far as technique goes. Hes got an unusual, unorthodox technique which makes bowlers look embarrassed at times. I love the way he manipulates the field. Its a pretty sad day for cricket because he is a tremendous ambassador for the game. 

JACQUES KALLIS: It has been a privilege playing against him. Running in to bowl, you certainly have to make sure you are on top of your game. His is one of the wickets you remember as a prize wicket. He has certainly taken the West Indies and world cricket to a new level. 

KIRAN MORE: He is a genius. He is a great player to watch and a great entertainer. I have never missed Laras innings wherever he has played since most of the matches are played on TV. Today also, if any old match of Lara is being showed, it is a pleasure to watch. 

MICHAEL VAUGHAN: He is a legend of the game, he has done wonders for cricket, not just in the Caribbean but the world.

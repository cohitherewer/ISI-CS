 Dravid opts out, Sachin to lead

 - WARM-UP TIE 

 Sourav, Zaheer to be back; Ranadeb may miss out 

 Sachin Tendulkar 

Chelmsford: Sachin Tendulkar will lead the Indian team against England Lions after Rahul Dravid on Thursday pulled out of their three-day warm-up cricket match due to a calf injury. 

Dravid, who suffered the injury during the four-day tour opener against county champions Sussex, opted to take rest ahead of the first Test beginning at the Lords from July 19. 

The Indian captain had not done any fielding practice in the last three days but the team management played down the injury, saying it was not serious. 

Sachin, who was appointed the vice-captain but had not taken part in the opening warm-up match, will now have the additional responsibility of leading the side. 

It will also be the first match for Sourav Ganguly, who also sat out of the first game. 

Thus the return of old guards in Sachin and Sourav gives a much solid look to the Indian batting. 

The Indians hope that they have a good workout ahead of the first Test, beginning at Lords from July 19. 

In the bowling department, Zaheer Khan is set to come back to the playing XI while young Ishant Sharma will be given an opportunity to showcase his skills. 

The Indians however have also left out veteran spinner Anil Kumble, opener Gautam Gambhir and paceman Rudra Pratap Singh from the 12 shortlisted for the game. 

Bengal paceman Ranadeb Bose, who is in the XII, is likely to be left out from the playing XI. 

With the England Lions also boasting a strong attack in Stuart Broad, Chris Tremlett and Graham Onions, the Indian batsmen should expect no favours although the wicket is likely to play true. 

Warwickshire wicketkeeper Tim Ambrose, who has had an impressive season, has been given a chance ahead of Paul Nixon. 

Englands Test opener Andrew Strauss will be leading a promising side that also includes Owais Shah and Jonathan Trott, who were part of the one-day squad, and Ravi Bopara who is recovering from a thigh injury which ruled him out of the one-day series against the West Indies. 

Strauss himself would be looking to get into the groove as he struggled with his form scoring just one half-century in the Test series against West Indies. 

The English selectors would expect the left-handed opener dropped for the one-day series to get some runs ahead of the Test series.

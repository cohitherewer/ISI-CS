The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Shastri ducks, for once

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sehwag 

Dhaka: Cricket manager Ravi Shastri has steered clear of the vice-captaincy controversy. Or, well, he has ducked. 

I dont know what (selector Venkatapathi) Raju said yesterday... I havent read or heard his comment, so I dont wish to say anything... Bottomline is that the vice-captaincy issue hasnt been discussed. It will, if need be, Shastri told The Telegraph on Monday. 

Dilip Vengsarkar and Co. set a poor precedent by not naming Rahul Dravids deputy for the Bangladesh tour and a controversy arose when Dravid got hit at nets on Saturday. 

The selectors didnt react then but, on Sunday evening, a news agency quoted Raju as saying Virender Sehwag (sacked as vice-captain in end-November) would lead if injury kept Dravid in the dressing room. 

Vengsarkar, by the way, didnt contradict what his colleague said. However, not only has Sehwag done nothing in the past few months to win back the No.2 position, he has been dropped for the Test series which follows the three ODIs. 

Unusually, if the situation so warrants, Shastri and Dravid have the authority to select the vice-captain/stand-in captain.

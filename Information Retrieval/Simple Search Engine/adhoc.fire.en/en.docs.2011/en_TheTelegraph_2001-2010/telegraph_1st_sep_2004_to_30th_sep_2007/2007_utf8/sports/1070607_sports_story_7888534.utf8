 Imran: PCB should sue the Jamaican police

London: Legendary captain Imran Khan has demanded that the Pakistan Cricket Board file defamation suits against the Jamaica police as well as former fast bowler Sarfraz Nawaz for damaging the countrys reputation after coach Bob Woolmers death. 

Imran said the PCB should sue the Jamaica police for maligning Pakistan teams image by putting it to the trauma of DNA testing, fingerprinting and interrogation like suspects after wrongly diagnosing the reason for Woolmers death. 

Pakistan cricket really took a bashing after there was a completely wrong diagnosis of Woolmers death. The team became suspects. At first everyone had assumed it was a natural death, Imran said. 

When the Pakistan media manager saw Woolmers body he thought it was a straightfor ward case of natural death. The Jamaica police should have had more evidence before they raised suspicions of murder. 

In my opinion the Pakistan Cricket Board should sue for defamation. If I was the Pakistan captain I would have asked for damages, he was quoted as saying by a British paper. 

Imran also lashed out at Sarfraz for levelling allegation of match-fixing against the team. They (PCB) should also sue Sarfraz Nawaz, because he was the first one to raise allegation of the Pakistan teams involvement with bookies, he said. 

Sarfraz had alleged that Woolmers death was connected with the match-fixing mafia and that the Pakistan World Cup games were fixed.

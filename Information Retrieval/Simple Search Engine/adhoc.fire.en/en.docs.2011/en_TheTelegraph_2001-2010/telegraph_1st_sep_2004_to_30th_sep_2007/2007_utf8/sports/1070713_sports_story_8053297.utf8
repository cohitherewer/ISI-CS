 Messi sets up final date with Brazil

 Lionel Messi 

Puerto Ordaz (Venezuela): Lionel Messi scored a breathtaking goal, arguably the best of the tournament, as Argentina beat Mexico 3-0 in their Copa America semi-final on Wednesday. 

Collecting a pass from Carlos Tevez, Messi spotted keeper Oswaldo Sanchez off his line and chipped the ball delicately into the net to score Argentinas second as they set up a final against old rivals Brazil. 

The 61st-minute goal, which came as Mexico were pressing for an equaliser, turned the game and Juan Riquelme added a third from a controversial penalty, his fifth goal of the tournament. Defender Gabriel Heinze had put Argentina ahead on the stroke of halftime with his second international goal as the favourites kept up an average of over three goals per game. 

Only a genius could do this, said Argentina coach Alfio Basile of Messis effort. 

Mexico, with coach Hugo Sanchez celebrating his 49th birthday, made a fight of it. They had slightly the better of the first 40 minutes and twice hit the woodwork in an enthralling game. 

We tried but the opponents were superior, said Sanchez as Mexico, beaten 2-1 by Argentina in last years World Cup second round, lost to the same opponents again. 

Earlier, Venezuela president Hugo Chavez, who counts Argentina as a close ally and has frosty ties with Mexico, had predicted an Argentina victory. 

With Argentina surely going to win today, we will have an amazing final to crown the tournament, he said. 

Mexico, 6-0 conquerors of Paraguay in their quarter final, made a lively start and nearly went ahead in the 18th minute when Andres Guardado, free on the left, cut inside his marker and hit the outside of the post. (REUTERS)

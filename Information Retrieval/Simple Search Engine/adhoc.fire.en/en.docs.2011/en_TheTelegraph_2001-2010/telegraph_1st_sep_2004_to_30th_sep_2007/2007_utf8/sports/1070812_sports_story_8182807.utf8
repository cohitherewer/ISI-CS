 Chopra opens up new horizons

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Michael Chopras goal not only gave Sunderland manager Roy Keane a memorable Premiership debut, but also provided hope for England. Chopra scored late in the Premier League opener on Saturday to ensure victory against Tottenham Hotspur. 

Viewed in the larger context, the 23-year-old son of an Indian shopkeeper could provide England coach Steve McClaren with an interesting option up front. 

With Michael Owen constantly dogged by injury problems, Peter Crouch not that successful, Wayne Rooney too erratic and Theo Walcott too young, Chopras deft touches and blistering pace could have caught McLarens attention Saturday. 

Making the national side wont be a piece of cake for Chopra, but he does have some international experience. In 1999, the fleet-footed striker became the first player of Indian origin to play for the junior England team. 

After his initial flourish at Newcastle, where he spent a season on loan, Chopra moved to first division team Cardiff FC before his 5 million transfer to Sunderland. 

Indian coach Bob Houghton once said that Chopra would be the first foreign footballer of Indian origin that the AIFF would manage to convince to play for the national team. 

When Houghton came face to face with Chopra in Canada, the British coach had a closed-door meeting with the then Cardiff player. 

Chopra politely turned down Houghtons offer of doing duty for the Indian team. Chopra, after all, had set his sights on England.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We wanted to assess the wicket: Mahela

Bridgetown: It was mission accomplished for Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene after his team enjoyed a 159-run victory over Scotland in their opening World Cup warm-up match on Monday. 

Coming into the World Cup and playing a side like Scotland whom we havent played before, we wanted to make sure that we concentrate really well, focus on the game in hand and we did that, Jayawardene said. 

All round we played really good cricket. We had a 100-run stand, we had a couple of 50-run stands. The only thing we would have liked doing was one of the guys batting through the innings and getting 100. 

Despite the emphatic nature of the result, the Lankans had begun cautiously but Jayawardene said that had all been part of the strategy. 

We wanted to assess how the wicket would play here, he said. We felt that it was a bit slow and if we had given away early wickets it would have been difficult for us. Once the openers got used to the pitch and the wicket, we got our target, we got 120 in 20 overs.

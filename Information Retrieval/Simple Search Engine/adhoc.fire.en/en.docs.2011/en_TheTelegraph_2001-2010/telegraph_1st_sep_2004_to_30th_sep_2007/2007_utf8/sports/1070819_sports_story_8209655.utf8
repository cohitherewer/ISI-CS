 Syria put two past Bangladesh

JAYDEEP BASU

 New Delhi: The Ambedkar Stadium once again proved to be an unlucky venue for Syed Nayeemuddin. 

Exactly 15 months ago, on an warm May afternoon, the Dronacharya coach had walked out of this stadium a dejected man, after India were vanquished by Yemen in the World Cup qualifiers. A week later, the former India captain had been unceremoniously shown the door by the All India Football Federation. 

On Saturday in the ONGC Nehru Cup, Nayeemuddin, now Bangladesh coach, had a chance to make amends. But all his planning failed in the face of a fierce second half onslaught by Syria. 

Bangladesh, who play India on Monday, lost 0-2 aganst the tournament favourites and were distinctly lucky not to concede at least four more. 

Interestingly, the Bangladesh coach was not the only one who looked unhappy at the end of the match. India coach Bob Houghton, who sat throughout the 90 minutes period, also looked a worried man. 

Syria, who dished out a pedestrian display in the first half, were a transformed lot in the second session. They accelerated the pace at will and attacked in sudden bursts to leave the Bangladesh midfield and defence completely rattled. 

After an encouraging first half, few would have expected Bangladesh to cave in so meekly. 

Syria took the field after the change of ends with a fresh game plan. Their sudden burst of speed completely caught the rival defence on the wrong foot and Syria forged ahead within three minutes in the second half. 

The first goal by Man of the Match Maher Al Sayed was a beauty. The pass by Ali Dyeb landed on the edge of the box and Maher slammed an angular right footer that crashed into the net. 

Thereafter Syria created at least half a dozen chances as the Bangladesh defenders completely gave up. But Syria had to wait till the 79th minute for the second goal that came through Zyad Chaabo, who cashed on yet another defence splitting pass by Ali Dyeb.

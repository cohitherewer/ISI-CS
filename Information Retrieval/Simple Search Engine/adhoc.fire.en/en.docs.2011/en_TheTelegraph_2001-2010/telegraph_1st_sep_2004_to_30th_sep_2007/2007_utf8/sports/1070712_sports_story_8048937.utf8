 Sachin greatest batsman of modern era, says Cairns

 Sachin Tendulkar 

Dubai: Sachin Tendulkar is the greatest batsman of the modern era, according to former New Zealand allrounder Chris Cairns. 

Cairns, who is playing for Lashings World XI after an illustrious career with the New Zealand team, was asked to name the best batsman of his era and he picked Sachin. 

Among the bowlers, Pakistani great Wasim Akram was Cairnss choice. 

Blessed with six-hitting abilities and lively pace, Cairns was hailed as one of the few genuine allrounders of his era. He, however, rates Ian Botham, Imran Khan and Kapil Dev as the three best allrounders of the modern era. 

In my view Ian Botham tops the list. He has won more matches and could easily turn a match with his effort, Cairns told a daily. 

Imran Khan is next as the Pakistani allrounder could bat at number four and also used to open the bowling. 

Third in my list is Kapil Dev simply because the man took so many wickets and mostly on the sub-continent pitches which are not too helpful to pace, Cairns explained. 

He revealed he was planning a new career after retirement but ruled out full-time coaching. 

 I am currently enjoying myself with my family and with Lashings. 

For over 12 years it has been a hectic schedule and I have yet to decide on my future, said Cairns, who quit Test cricket in 2004 and ODIs last year. 

Maybe I would not mind short stints of consultancy in helping out young bowlers or all-rounders. 

However, I am yet to make my move, he said. 

Cairnss retirement seemed little premature. The player, however, felt that it was a right decision to walk out with his head held high rather than wait and allow someone to come and show the door.

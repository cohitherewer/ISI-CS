 Chawlas 10 in India A win

 Piyush Chawla 

New Delhi: Leg-spinner Piyush Chawla came up with match haul of 10 for 58 as India A thrashed a Zimbabwe XI by an innings and 233 runs in a four-day match at the Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo. 

After his first innings figures of four for 12, Chawla captured six for 46 on Wednesday to rock the Zimbabwe batting line-up and help the visitors sweep the two-match series. 

The home team was on the backfoot when they resumed their first innings on Day III at 67 for five. 

Chawla and Pragyan Ojha claimed four wickets each to wrap up the Zimbabweans for 143. After being asked to follow on, the Zimbabwe openers Tino Mawoyo and Hamilton Masakadza again provided a good start to their team, notching up 63 runs before allowing any damage to happen. 

However, once India A achieved the breakthrough, the Zimbabwe batsmen fell like nine pins as six of them failed to open their account. 

Masakadzas defiant knock of 73 was the only bright spot in the hosts batting as they were all out for 148 in the second essay. 

The wrecker-in-chief Chawlas six wickets helped him finish with 18 scalps in two matches. 

Apart from Chawla, paceman Irfan Pathan emerged the most successful bowler for the Indians. 

The Baroda seamer, who was wicketless in the first innings, had three wickets for 12 runs in the second. 

India A will fly to Kenya for two three-day matches and a one-day tri-series involving Sri Lanka A as the third team.

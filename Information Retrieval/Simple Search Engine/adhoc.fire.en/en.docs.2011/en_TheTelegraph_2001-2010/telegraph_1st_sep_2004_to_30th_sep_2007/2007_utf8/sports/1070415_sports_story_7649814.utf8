 Australia a class apart: Johnston

Bridgetown: Ireland had another eye-opening experience in their first World Cup facing the blazing pace of Australias Shaun Tait. 

Weve never faced anyone bowling at the speed of 150 kilometres per hour (93 mph), it was a different experience from what were accustomed to, said Ireland captain Trent Johnston, whose team was bundled out for 91 in 30 overs Friday. 

Australia then blasted 92 in 12.2 overs for the loss of opener Adam Gilchrist to post their seventh successive win in this World Cup. 

We were outclassed by a superior team, Johnston said. We went out to set ourselves to be competitive, but it didnt work out against a team thats been the best in the world for 10 years. 

Our top order didnt come to the party. If the top four batsmen get two runs between them were always going to struggle. We finished with the ninth worst World Cup total we were ticking off the scores sitting in the dressing room. 

Still, Johnston looked for the silver lining. I hope the batsmen would have learnt something from this exposure to Taits speed, which was backed by top-class pace bowlers Glenn McGrath and Stuart Clark, said Johnson, reminding his batsmen that they would soon have to face Sri Lankas Lasith Malinga. 

People said well struggle against fast bowling, but I think we faced quick bowling quite well until today, he said. 

Johnston said Ireland needs more exposure to top international competition. 

We still have one-day International status for two years, the Irish team needs more exposure, possibly high-level games against top teams, he said. 

Adrian Birrell, Irelands South African coach, said his team had taken a bruising and had been ruthlessly put away by Australia. 

Ireland, now eliminated, must raise their game and their spirits before they face Bangladesh on Sunday.

Calcutta: Rahul Dravid had a reassuring word for those who are worried about his nose injury ahead of Team Indias departure for Bangladesh. 

I am fine Theres no cause for worry, Dravid said after a photo-session at the team hotel in the evening. 

Dravid was hit on the nose while negotiating a bouncer from Rudra Pratap Singh on Saturday. An X-ray showed no fracture. 

The captain didnt make an appearance at the Eden for the final nets session of the five-day conditioning camp, but was in a jovial mood in the evening. There was no trace of the injury, with the tape having been removed from over his nose. 

According to a team spokesman, no further tests are required and he would lead the side in the first ODI in Mirpur on Thursday. 

Ravi Shastri also sounded confident. Rahul is doing fine. He is a tough cookie. I am sure he would be wanting to take guard in Bangladesh from the first ball, the cricket manager said, adding that his condition was being monitored. Injuries can happen You must know that we are not playing marbles, we are playing cricket. 

The 15-member ODI squad will leave for Dhaka on Monday morning. 

Incidentally, the newly-wed Dinesh Karthik joined the camp on the concluding day. He knocked about a few balls but didnt take part in the nets proper. 

Sachin Tendulkar, however, slogged out at nets for the second consecutive day following his ankle injury. 

 The players were made to negotiate the bounce on a grassy pitch. The solitary session also focused on catching practice and throwing techniques. 

The players then had a session at the hotel swimming pool and practised yoga with Sukhdev. 

The Singapore-based experts association with Team India ended with the conclusion of the camp.

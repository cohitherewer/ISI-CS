 Nazir, Raza on Pakistan list

 - WORLD CUP PROBABLES 

Karachi: Opener Imran Nazir and middle-order batsman Hasan Raza were on Wednesday recalled among the 30 probables shortlisted for the World Cup with no major surprises by the PCB. 

The list also includes pacers Mohammed Asif and Shoaib Akhtar, who are still under a shadow of doping scandal despite being cleared of charges and having their bans lifted by an appeals commission of the PCB. 

They will be considered for selection despite the reservations being raised by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) against their exoneration by the appeals commission, PCB spokesman said. 

Rookie allrounder Fawad Alam is not in the list as reported earlier by the media. 

Malik said Pakistan stood by their stance that they have conducted an impartial and just trial of both players and they were given an opportunity to defend themselves. 

THE PROBABLES 

Inzamam-ul Haq, Mohammed Yousuf, Younis Khan, Mohammed Hafeez, Imran Farhat, Shoaib Malik, Kamran Akmal, Abdul Razzaq, Abdul Rehman, Salman Butt, Faisal Iqbal, Rana Naved-ul Hasan, Rao Iftikhar, Imran Nazir, Shahid Afridi, Umar Gul, Shahid Nazir, Danish Kaneria, Yasir Hameed, Shabbir Ahmed, Mohammed Sami, Mohammed Khalil, Bazid Khan, Mansoor Amjad, Zulqarnain Haider, Yasir Arafat, Mohammed Asif, Shoaib Akhtar, Misbah-ul Haq, Hasan Raza.

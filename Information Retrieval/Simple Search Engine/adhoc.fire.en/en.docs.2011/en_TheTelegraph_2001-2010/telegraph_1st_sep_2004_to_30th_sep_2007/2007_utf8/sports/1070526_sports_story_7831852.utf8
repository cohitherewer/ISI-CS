Leeds: Former South Africa fast bowler Allan Donald has been appointed as fast bowling consultant to assist the England team. 

Donald, 40, will aid the England teams fast bowling programme on a short-term consultancy basis, a media release by the ECB said on Friday. 

He will begin his work from the run-up to the third Test against the West Indies at Old Trafford starting on June 7. 

His assignment will continue till the end of the five-match one-day series in July. 

Donald is the latest addition to Englands new-look coaching team after Peter Moores replaced Duncan Fletcher as head coach following the World Cup. Former Zimbabwe captain Andy Flower succeeded Matthew Maynard as batting coach this month. 

Donald played 72 Tests and 164 one-day Internationals for South Africa. He has an English wife and a home in Birmingham in central England, having played for county team Warwickshire throughout the Nineties. 

Englands fast bowlers have struggled since bowling coach Troy Cooley departed in 2005 and subsequently went to work with his native Australia. 

Cooley was credited with helping players such as Andrew Flintoff and Matthew Hoggard develop their reverse swing, which was crucial to England regaining the Ashes in 2005 after an 18-year wait.

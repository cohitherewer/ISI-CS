Los Angeles: Sania Mirza launched her doubles campaign on a winning note in the $600,000 East West Bank Classic tournament on Wednesday. 

Sania and American partner Bethanie Mattek beat the Slovak-Dutch pair of Janette Husarova-Michaella Krajicek 6-3, 2-6, 11-9 in the WTA Tier II hardcourt meet to enter the last 16. 

The Indo-US pair next faces second seeds Kveta Peschke (Czech) and Rennae Stubbs (Australia). 

Sania, who beat former world No. 1 and current No. 12 Martina Hingis on Tuesday, will meet French Virginie Razzano in the singles pre-quarter final. Razzano beat 10th seed Shahar Peer of Israel 6-1, 4-6, 7-6 (8-6) in the second round. 

Top seed Maria Sharapova reached the third round when an ailing Eleni Daniilidou retired in the second set. 

Sharapova, who won her first title of the season in San Diego on Sunday, battled to take the first set 7-6 (7/5) and was up 3-1 in the second when the Greek lady couldnt continue. 

She said she was still feeling the effects of an illness that had prevented her from practising. 

Jelena Jankovic, runner-up to Elena Dementieva here last year, managed to shrug off the after-effects of a cold to defeat Chinas Peng Shuai 6-1, 6-1. Third seed Ana Ivanovic also advanced, defeating American Ashley Harkleroad 6-4, 6-2. 

Ivanovic, playing for the first time since falling in the Wimbledon semis to eventual champion Venus Williams, booked a clash with Czech Lucie Safarova, who beat Ai Sugiyama. 

Defending champion Dementieva needed just 54 minutes to dismiss American wild card Madison Brengle 6-2, 6-0.She next faces fifth-seeded Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia, who was a 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) winner over American Jill Craybas. 

Fourth-seeded Russian Nadia Petrova also advanced, beating American Lilia Osterloh 7-5, 6-3. (AFP)

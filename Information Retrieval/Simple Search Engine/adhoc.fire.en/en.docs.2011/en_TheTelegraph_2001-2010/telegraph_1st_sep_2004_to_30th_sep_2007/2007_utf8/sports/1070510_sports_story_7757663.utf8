 Mourinho still furious over Ballack surgery

 Ballack 

Sir Alex Ferguson on Tuesday took a swipe at Jose Mourinho by saying that he knew Manchester United could win the Barclays Premiership title the moment Chelsea signed Michael Ballack and Andriy Shevchenko last summer. 

It is a provocative statement that the continuing deliberations at Stamford Bridge over the contributions of the German midfielder and the Ukraine forward are doing little to disprove. 

The fallout from Ballacks unauthorised ankle operation continues to rage and could have implications for Dr Bryan English, the widely respected head of Chelseas medical department. 

Ballack was given reassurances over his future by Mourinho at the clubs training ground on Tuesday, although the Chelsea manager remains furious at being denied the services of one of his key players at such a crucial stage of the season. 

The 30-year-old flew to Germany for surgery to remove a piece of chipped bone in his ankle without the clubs permission on April 27, ruling him out of Chelseas Champions League semi-final against Liverpool and the remainder of their Premiership fixtures. 

Mourinho has finally accepted that an operation was necessary but his anger has moved on to his medical team, who initially judged that Ballacks injury was not serious after he was substituted 18 minutes into the goalless draw with Newcastle United on April 22. 

The German player insists that the injury was misdiagnosed by the clubs doctors and that the responsibility lies with English, who has already clashed with Mourinho this season. 

Frazer resigned after a heated row with Mourinho in front of Chelseas first-team squad after the doctors decision to rule Robben out of the Carling Cup final against Liverpool. 

Mourinho is notoriously demanding of his medical team, though he has enjoyed a largely successful relationship with English after he joined from UK Athletics in 2005. 

English shares a philosophy of pushing players during their rehabilitation and has helped return Ashley Cole, Wayne Bridge and Terry to the first-team squad with remarkable speed this season. 

Still he could be made the scapegoat for the row over Ballack, who retains an outside chance of returning for the FA Cup final against Manchester United.

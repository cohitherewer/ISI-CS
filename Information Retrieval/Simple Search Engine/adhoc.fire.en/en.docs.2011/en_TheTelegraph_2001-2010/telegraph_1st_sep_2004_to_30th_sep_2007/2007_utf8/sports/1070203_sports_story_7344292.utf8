 AIFF to fly in foreign refs

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Referees from Singapore may arrive during the second leg of the National Football League (NFL) to supervise crucial matches, according to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources. 

The AIFF has initiated the move to fly in foreign referees for key NFL matches after a host of clubs complained about poor supervision in the first four rounds. 

It could have been done earlier, an AIFF official said. 

But most of the top referees are busy with AFC commitments. The federation has now decided to fly in referees from Singapore as they, too, sometimes get officials from India for their crucial domestic encounters. Our Fifa referee Suresh did one such match in Singapore, the official said. 

The move has certainly not gone down well with Indian referees. According to sources, many of them felt that the AIFF is succumbing to pressure from the clubs. 

Referees from Malaysia and the Maldives have supervised matches in NFL on many occasions and this has nothing to do with the standard of Indian refereeing, the official said. 

But at the same time, the federation is seriously thinking of forming an independent committee to look into complains made by the clubs quite frequently. 

The committee could comprise former referees, footballers and officials who have knowledge about the laws. They can look into the recordings of matches and offer their opinion.

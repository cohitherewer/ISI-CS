 Operation Jayasuriya for Bond

 Shane Bond

Kingston: New Zealand speedster Shane Bond will target veteran Sanath Jayasuriya early on to stop Sri Lanka from getting a flying start in Tuesdays World Cup semi-final clash. 

He (Jayasuriya) is the kind of cricketer who gives them early momentum. If he gets going, they are able to raise 250 on the board. My job is to ensure that it does not happen, Bond said. 

The battle between the two will certainly have a bearing on the game. Jayasuriya has been in fine nick in the tournament and if he gets going, Sri Lanka will have a good chance of putting up a healthy score and allow their bowlers to take a good shot at New Zealand. Bond will look to cut-off that blood supplying artery. 

Bonds record against the veteran is not very impressive. He has played against Sri Lanka in nine matches, and claimed Jayasuriya in only one of them. In the last five matches against the Black Caps, Jayasuriya has scores of 101, 1, 0, 71 and 64 and Sri Lanka have emerged winners in three. 

The present World Cup has been outstanding for both. With an average of 12.83, Bond is the best among the bowlers while Jayasuriya, with 403 runs from nine matches at 50.37, is among the tournaments best batsmen. 

Bond expects the Sabina Park pitch to be his ally in this battle for supremacy against the veteran Lankan. 

I have spoken to a few players and happened to chat up with Darren Powell on the flight. The Sabina pitch generally gives good carry to fast bowlers and when there is humidity, as it is here, the ball will swing. 

There will be an attempt to keep the pitch flat, but I suspect the humidity will allow the ball to swing. We, somehow, back ourselves to do better in such conditions. 

Bond expects Sri Lankan bowlers, especially Chaminda Vaas, to make things difficult for his side as well. 

Vaas has been a class act and he has got the better of Stephen (Fleming) on occasions. The conditions here will suit him as well. Generally I sense this match will go a long way towards the team which is able to pick 3-4 early wickets. 

Bond generally means trouble for the opposition top-order and everyone, including Australia, gives him respect. 

When I bowl to them (Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist), I try to have a clear plan and persist with it. They try to put pressure on you and if you back off they tend to be all over you. I sense if I stick to my plan, I will create opportunity. 

Bond dismisses Ricky Pontings comment that the Black Caps would be under pressure after being beaten by the highest margin ever last week. 

This is the typical Australian way. They tend to speak about themselves and talk down the opponents. They are certainly beatable. If you can take early wickets, they too can get under pressure. (PTI)

 Shiv tied third, Jyoti seventh

 Shiv Kapur 

Wentworth: Four birdies on the back nine saw Shiv Kapur in tied third place after Day I of the BMW PGA Championship of Europe on Thursday. 

He carded a superb five-under 67 after finishing the round with three birdies over the last four holes. 

Jyoti Randhawa shot a four-under 68 that gave him a share of the seventh spot with, amongst others, world No. 5 Ernie Els. 

Els had five birdies over the back nine to post a 68. Finishing alongside Els on four under par were Mikko Ilonen of Finland, Y.E. Yang of South Korea, Alejandro Caqizares of Spain and Richard Sterne of South Africa. 

Things were not so good for Jeev Milkha Singh, who stumbled to a 77 to be at 125. 

Englands Justin Rose was in a share of the lead with fellow-Englishman Paul Broadhurst. Each shot a 66. 

Close on their heels are Englands Simon Khan, Australian Marcus Fraser, Kapur and Francesco Molinari of Italy. 

Kapur, who finished way down the order last week at the Irish Open, is recovering from a strained back. His driving was top notch and he found 13 of the 14 fairways and reached 14 greens in regulation. (PTI)

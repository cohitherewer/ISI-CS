The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Standard on the decline, says Viv

Bridgetown: Australia and Sri Lanka, the two best teams at the 2007 World Cup, are contesting the final but the poor standard of cricket is drawing a yawn from experts and former cricketers. 

Its not as it used to be, the standard of world cricket is declining, remarked Viv Richards ahead of the summit clash here on Saturday. 

The sight of New Zealands No. 3 batsman Ross Taylors inability to put his bat to ball against Lasith Malinga in the first semi-final in Jamaica drew much flak. 

This is a World Cup semi-final and you have a top order batsman unable to put his bat to any delivery from a young bowler who is promising but by no stretch of imagination great yet. And this is a pitch which is a batsmans beauty, lamented former West Indian fast bowler Wayne Daniel. 

Richards though admires the present-day Australians for the way they approach their cricket. You can sense it in the way Ricky Ponting walks up to the crease. He is sending out a message to opponents and fast bowlers, he said. 

The thing is you need to be mentally very tough out there. If you dont convey the feeling, if you dont back yourself, they would be all over you. 

Colin Croft, former West Indian fast bowler, feels the final will be an interesting battle. While the Australians are playing very good cricket, I feel Sri Lanka have a better team. (PTI)

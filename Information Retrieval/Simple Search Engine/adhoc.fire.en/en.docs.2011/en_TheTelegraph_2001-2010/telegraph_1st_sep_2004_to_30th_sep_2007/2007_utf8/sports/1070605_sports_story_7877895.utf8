 Bangla recall Razzak, Rahim

Dhaka: Bangladesh have recalled left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak and batsman-cum-wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim in a 15-man Test squad for the Sri Lanka tour. 

They will replace left-arm spinner Enamul Haque junior and batsman Tushar Imran. 

Meanwhile, newly appointed Bangladesh captain Mohammed Ashraful has taken his new role as a challenge. 

I dont feel any additional pressure of captaincy. But yes, its a challenging assignment, Asharaful said. 

Aftab Ahmed, Tamim Iqbal, Tushar Imran, Farhad Reza and uncapped off-spinner-cum-batsman Mahmudullah Riyad will join the squad before the start of the one-day series.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 EB move to bring Subrata could be a master-stroke

FREE-KICK

 The Premier division of the local league hasnt yet kicked off, but I can already feel a buzz in the air. Subrata Bhattacharyas appointment as East Bengal coach, Mohun Bagans decision to hire Carlos Roberto Pereira and Shabbir Alis arrival at Mohammedan Sporting have added up to give the ensuing local season a special flavour.

 East Bengals decision could well turn out to be a master-stroke. Its no secret that Subrata, the man who guided Mohun Bagan to two NFL titles and one runners-up finish, was fired two years ago before the season had ended. Though Subrata hasnt talked about that humiliation in public, Im sure he hasnt forgotten the treatment either.

 I get this feeling that deep inside, Subrata is nursing a burning desire to prove something this season. Mohun Bagan better watch out.

 The man who was considered to be a die-hard Mohun Bagan loyalist has made the right start in his first ever stint with the arch-rivals. He convinced East Bengal officials to bring over Dipendu from Mohun Bagan, where he didnt get his due. 

 I liked Subratas opening statements after joining East Bengal. He said he was absolutely overwhelmed by the fans response and that he wanted to treat every match in the season as a final. He isnt making too many noises, just the right ones. 

 Subrata needs to win over the supporters because there are bound to be some disappointing results during the long season. He will also need support from the officials, which Im sure hell get. Whichever group wins the elections will wholeheartedly back the coach. This is a pleasing trait all East Bengal officials share.

 Talking of Mohun Bagan, they have got together a useful team. By retaining both Barreto and Bhaichung, the officials have sent out a clear message that they have full faith in the star duo despite their below-par performance last season. The decision to appoint Bhaichung as captain, thus giving him an added responsibility, was also a smart one. He revels in the role of a leader.

 As far as their coach is concerned, Pereira is a thorough gentleman but the Maidan has not always been kind to nice men. I have nothing against Pereira, but I wish Mohun Bagan had gone for Subhas Bhowmick. The Subrata versus Subhas angle would have generated the kind of hype and excitement that defined Calcutta soccer when Amal Dutta and I were in charge of the two big teams.

 Theres renewed hope in Mohammedan Sporting as well, with the induction of Shabbir. I expect a strong show from Shabbirs men in the local league to set the tone for their ultimate challenge to regain a berth in the NFL top tier.

 Just as Im looking forward to some gripping competition on the field, Im expecting the new set of IFA office-bearers to usher a new dawn. I have no doubt that they will help the association tide over the scandalous patch and put Bengal football back to its position of eminence.

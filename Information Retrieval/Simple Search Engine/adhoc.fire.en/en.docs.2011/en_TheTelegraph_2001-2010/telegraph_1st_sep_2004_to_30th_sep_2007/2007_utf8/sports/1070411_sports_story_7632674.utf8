 Sachin, Yuvraj get seven days to reply

Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh, slapped with notices for talking to the media, have been asked to explain their conduct within seven days. 

The notices, seeking an explanation, were sent on Monday and they have been asked to respond within seven days, a BCCI source said on Tuesday. 

The two players were pulled up by the BCCI working committee for their comments on former coach Greg Chappell as a violation of the code of conduct. 

Tendulkar was quoted as saying that he was deeply hurt by Chappells questioning of the senior players attitude. 

Yuvraj had said that Chappells alleged criticism of some senior players and in particular Tendulkar had brought the team together. 

The show-cause notice has been issued under Rule 38 of the memorandum and the rules and regulations of the BCCI.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tough battle on cards

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Round VI encounter of the 11th ONGC National Football League between East Bengal and Dempo Sports Club promises to be a tough battle at the Barasat stadium on Saturday. 

With both teams having 10 points each with three wins, one draw and one loss, the equation between East Bengal and Dempo could not have been more neck-and-neck. Incidentally, both teams in their last match scored identical 2-1 victories over their respective opponents. While Dempo beat Mohun Bagan, East Bengal got the better of JCT in their last matches. 

The match will also be a contest between tournament top-scorer Ranty Martins (five goals) and Boniface Ngairah Ambani, (three goals), to prove supremacy. As Dempo will bank on Martins and Anthony Periera while the red-and-golds on depend heavily Ambani to clinch the winner. 

In fact such was the confidence of East Bengal coach Carlos Roberto Perreira that he has decided to keep the same line-up (4-4-2) for the big match. The visitors, on the other hand, will have to manage without Sameer Naik who will not be available for double booking. 

After their one-and-half hour practice on Friday morning, Perreira stressed that there would be no special strategy to tackle Ranty but their boys will play their natural game. He however added, It will be a tough match but we will certainly play for a win.

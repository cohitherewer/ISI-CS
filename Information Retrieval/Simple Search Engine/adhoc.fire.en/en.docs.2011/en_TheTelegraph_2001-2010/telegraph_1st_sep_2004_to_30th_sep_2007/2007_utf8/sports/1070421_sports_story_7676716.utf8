The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sachin snubbed twice over

 - NEXT MONTHS TOUR OF BANGLADESH 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sachin and Yuvraj 

Mumbai: Less than a fortnight ago, Sachin Tendulkar was asked to explain why hed given interviews. On Friday, days before his 34th birthday, the maestro was kept out of the Team India XV for the three ODIs in Bangladesh. 

Of course, chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar emphasised both he and Sourav Ganguly had been rested and not dropped, but... 

After all, both Sachin and Sourav have had a high average in their last ten one-day innings 45.63 and 60.00, respectively, and there can be little justification for resting them. 

Sachin, in fact, has even lost the vice-captaincy. That too suggests theres more than meets the eye. He has, in effect, been humiliated. 

Frankly, it didnt make much sense when Sachin got the No.2 position in January; the latest turn of events makes little sense either. 

Vengsarkar and his colleagues could have appointed Yuvraj Singh as vice-captain, but didnt because hes in the bad books of the Board. 

Yuvraj has quite some ground to recover, remarked a well-placed source of The Telegraph, adding that even the Punjab star was asked to explain comments given to the media. 

If Yuvraj doesnt recover lost ground, then Mahendra Singh Dhoni is likely to be the biggest beneficiary. Provided, he performs. 

Board secretary Niranjan Shah and Vengsarkar chose not to read much into the vice-captains chair remaining vacant, but its debatable whether such a move will actually help team unity. 

Apparently, the Boards constitution has been breached as theres no provision for not appointing a vice-captain on tour. 

Captain Rahul Dravid and interim cricket manager (or coach) Ravi Shastri have been given the authority to choose the vice-captain as and when necessary. 

Didnt they already have much on their plates?

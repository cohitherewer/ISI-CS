 Daughter for Elin, Tiger

New York: Tiger Woods is a daddy. 

Less than 24 hours after Woods finished second at the US Open on Fathers Day, his wife gave birth to a daughter. 

Woods announced on his website that Sam Alexis Woods was born early Monday morning. Both Elin and Sam are doing well and resting peacefully, Woods wrote. 

We want to thank our doctors and the hospital staff for all their dedicated and hard work. 

This is truly a special time in our lives and we look forward to introducing Sam to our family and friends over the next few weeks. We thank everyone for their well wishes and continued respect of our privacy. 

Woods said he would miss a major if it meant seeing the birth of his child. Now he wont have to, but its not clear how his upcoming schedule will be affected. 

I dont know how much Im going to play after that or how much Im going to play before that. A lot of that is depending on what happens and the health of Elin and our child.

 Owen eases pressure

Duncan White

Pessimism had clouded the approach to Saturdays European Championship qualifier, with Wayne Rooney, Frank Lampard and David Beckham injured and the team struggling to score. But the return of another iconic figure from the surgery table dissolved the anxieties about how England were going to break down Israel. 

England emerged triumphant in their first competitive game at Wembley, winning their first home international in more than a year. And Michael Owen capped it with the goal of the day. Im delighted. Id have taken 1-0, McClaren said. The performance was the icing on the cake. The way we went about the game made Israel look ordinary and they had proved a difficult side to beat. 

Man of the Match Shaun Wright-Phillips scored first on 20 minutes with a neat far-post finish from Joe Coles in-swinging cross and Micah Richards claimed his first England goal with a thumped header after 66 minutes. Sandwiched between them was a moment of brilliance from Owen. 

Receiving Gareth Barrys clever, disguised pass just outside the box, Owen chipped the ball up for himself, and lashed it into the net in one fluid, swivelling half-volley. It was his 38th goal for his country and he is only 11 short of Bobby Charltons record. It bore the mark of a confident, world-class finisher. I like to think Ive come back just as good and its lovely to be back in team and back scoring goals, Owen said.

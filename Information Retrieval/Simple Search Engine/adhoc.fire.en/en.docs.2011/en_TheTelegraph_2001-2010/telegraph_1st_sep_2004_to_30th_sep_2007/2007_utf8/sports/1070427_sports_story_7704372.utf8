 Wettimuny urges Lanka to be aggressive

Colombo: Sri Lankas mild-mannered cricketers should be more aggressive if they want to beat the Australians in Saturdays World Cup final, former Sri Lankan player Sidath Wettimuny said. 

Sri Lankans need to show aggression in all departments of the game, Wettimuny, remarked the star opener of Sri Lankas early years in international cricket. 

Wettimuny, also a former chairman of the selection committee, said the Australians bat far down the order and that the Sri Lankans should look to attack right through. 

They must look for wickets than go on the defensive. They are a very powerful batting side, so no point in trying to contain them, Wettimuny said. 

The Sri Lankans will have their full-strength attack to use against the Aussies in Saturdays final in Bridgetown. 

Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah Muralidharan were controversially rested in the Super Eight game against the world champions in Grenada, while Lasith Malinga sat out with an injury. 

The Australians comfortably won that game. 

Wettimuny said the return of Sri Lankas main bowling weapons could be a reason for skipper Mahela Jayawardene to bat first should he win the toss. 

I am a firm believer in batting first in a one-day game under any circumstances, Wettimuny said. 

The Lankans chose to bat first against New Zealand in Tuesdays semi-final and put in a solid performance. 

The Australians are yet to lose in the World Cup since the tie against South Africa in the 1999 semi-final. Their unbeaten run has extended to 22 games.

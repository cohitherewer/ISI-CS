 Harbhajan bags 4

London: Harbhajan Singh produced a potentially match-winning spell to put Surrey in box seat against Worcestershire in a County Championship Division One match at Guildford on Friday. 

The Punjab off-spinner claimed four for 64 to skittle out Worcestershire for 217 and force them to follow on after surrey made 369 in the first innings. 

At stumps on the fourth day, Worcestershire were 46 for none in the second innings, still 106 runs away from avoiding an innings defeat. 

Harbhajan used the footmarks of rival left-arm seamer Doug Bollinger to great effect after being introduced as early as in the 14th over. 

Harbhajan, overlooked for the Test series against England, was well supported by Aussie seamer Matt Nicholson who picked three for 43.

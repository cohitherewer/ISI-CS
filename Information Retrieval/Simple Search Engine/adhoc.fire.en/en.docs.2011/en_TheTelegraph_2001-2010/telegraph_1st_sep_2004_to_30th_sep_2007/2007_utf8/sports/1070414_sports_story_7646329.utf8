 Lanka cut NZ down to size

Until Thursday, watching New Zealands smooth and silky progress through this tournament had been a little like watching an advert for an expensive car. This result a thumping six-wicket defeat to Sri Lanka was the moment when the driver blew a tyre. 

The explosion came as early as the first three overs. Swinging the new ball intelligently, Chaminda Vaas inflicted ducks on two key batsmen, including New Zealands captain Stephen Fleming. The shock appeared to incapacitate the whole team: with the worthy exception of Scott Styris, Flemings men spent the rest of the day veering wildly around the road. 

Many people had expected this match to be a dress-rehearsal for the World Cups first semi-final. But then, those same people had viewed New Zealand as serious contenders for the title. On the evidence of the rout, they have been flattered by a series of easy wins over average teams. You could hardly blame them for losing their edge. 

Sri Lanka have something that none of New Zealands six previous opponents could claim: a balanced and incisive attack. Even without the wacky, round-arm pace of Lasith Malinga, whose ankle ligament injury sadly will keep him out for the next fortnight, they still have Vaas swing, Dilhara Fernandos pace and Muttiah Muralidharans incomparable mystery spin. 

If Australias World Cup balloon is to be burst, one suspects that Muralidharan will be the man wielding the drawing pin. 

New Zealand were four for two when Styris walked to the crease. Not for the first time since Hurricane Ivan swept through Grenada, Queens Park Stadium had become a rebuilding zone. And Styris who would look just as comfortable in a hard hat was perfectly suited to the job. 

It took him six overs just to get off the mark, but from that point he played with lumbering assurance, picking off singles like a barrel-chested Paul Collingwood. The problem was at the other end. Wickets kept falling in daft ways, mainly through sweep shots that ballooned into the air. This was batting from the England manual. 

Styris kept rumbling on to his century, which eventually became an unbeaten 111, and a handy cameo from James Franklin saved New Zealand from total meltdown. Still, 219 for seven was a feeble effort on a ground where South Africa set a target of 357 only two days previously. 

New Zealands one real hope was Shane Bond, who came in with a tournament average (10.20) some four points better than the next man. Bond did produce one spectacular dismissal, but it was a catch at third man, taken high above his head from an Upul Tharanga uppercut that would have cleared the rope. 

Sri Lanka suffered a few soft dismissals, but really the game was over as a contest by the end of the first powerplay. As Sanath Jayasuriya carved and whipped his way to yet another half-century, the New Zealanders missed three hard one-handed chances. 

New Zealand had spent six weeks in the Caribbean without playing a competitive match against one of the worlds top six. Now they have lost their place at the top of the Super Eight table. 

But the next 10 days will be rather more challenging: South Africa here on Saturday and Australia next Friday. They could still end up scrapping it out with England for the last semi-final place, though their run-rate should give them an advantage. 

As the runners enter the final phase of this marathon tournament, the pacemaker looks like he is coming back to the pack.

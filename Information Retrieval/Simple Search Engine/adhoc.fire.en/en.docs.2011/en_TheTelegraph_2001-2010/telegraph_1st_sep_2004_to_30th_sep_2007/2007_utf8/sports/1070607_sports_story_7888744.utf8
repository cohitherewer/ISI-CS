 Mahesh, Radek in last 4

Paris: Mahesh Bhupathi and Radek Stepanek stormed into the semi-finals of the mens doubles at the French Open on Wednesday. The Indo-Czech pair upset second seeds Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden and Max Mirnyi of Belarus 3-6, 6-1, 7-6 (8-6). 

Leander Paes campaign, however, came to an end with a quarter-final defeat in the mixed doubles. Paes and his American partner, Meghan Shaughnessy, went down to Sun Tiantian of China and Julian Knowle of Austria 6-4, 4-6, 7-10, also on Wednesday. 

After losing the first set, Bhupathi and Stepanek responded by converting two breakpoints and saving three to take the match into a third set. They took two and a quarter hours to get past Bjorkman and Mirnyi. They will now meet Mark Knowles (Bahamas) and Daniel Nestor (Canada). for a place in the final. 

Paes and Shaughnessy seized the initiative by grabbing the first set against Sun and Knowle, but they could not tighten the noose.

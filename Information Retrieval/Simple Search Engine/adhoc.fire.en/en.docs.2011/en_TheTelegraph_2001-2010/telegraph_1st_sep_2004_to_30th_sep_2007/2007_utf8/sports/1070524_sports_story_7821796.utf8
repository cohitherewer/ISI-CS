 Endorsements cap to stay

Mumbai: The BCCI said on Wednesday that the decision to cap players endorsements at its last working committee meeting will stay in spite of the displeasure expressed by the players and sponsors. 

We have streamlined the players endorsement policy . We want to take it forward, vice-president Lalit Modi said. 

The working committee had decided that a player can endorse not more three products (excluding cricket gear) and no sponsor can contract more than two players at a time. 

The BCCI also dismissed captain Rahul Dravids concern over the cramped international schedule. 

I dont agree with the fatigue factor. Our cricketers dont play more than our tennis players. Even the Australian and English cricketers play more. We are playing the same amount of cricket as in the past. Its just that we have marketed it better, Modi said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Malinga up to 9th spot

A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: Sri Lanka cricketers gained some and lost some in the LG ICC ODI player rankings list that was released on Thursday. Following their teams 3-0 series win over Bangladesh, Lankan pace sensation Lasith Malinga moved up four places in the bowling list to be ninth overall. Malinga, who took four wickets in two ODIs, replaced Bangladeshs Abdur Razzak, according to an ICC release 

Malingas teammates Fervez Mahroof and Dilhara Fernando have climbed 10 places each. 

While the Sri Lanka bowlers have made the best of the series against Bangladesh, the same cannot be said for the batsmen. The experienced trio of Sanath Jayasuriya, Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara have all dropped in the rankings for ODI batsmen.

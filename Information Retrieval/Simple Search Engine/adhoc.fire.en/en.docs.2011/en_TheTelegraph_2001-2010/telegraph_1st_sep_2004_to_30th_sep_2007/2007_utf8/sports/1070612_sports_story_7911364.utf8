 Pak, Australia tour fixtures on agenda 

Bangalore: The player contracts and Zee groups proposed Indian Cricket League (ICL) will be key items on the agenda of the BCCIs working committee meeting in Delhi on Tuesday. 

Other important issues to be taken up for discussion by the committee include finalisation of itinerary of the upcoming series against Australia and Pakistan, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said on Monday. 

The itineraries of the Australian and Pakistan tours, including dates and venues, will be discussed in the working committee meeting tomorrow, he told reporters. 

The letter of Zee Group (on the ICL) is also an item on the meetings agenda, he added. 

But Shah refused to say whether the future of Kapil Dev as the National Cricket Academy chairman would be discussed. The Indian legend has recently joined the ICL as head of its board of directors. 

The official also said the redrafted contract with Nimbus, which came to the BCCIs rescue after Zee pulled out of telecasting the off-shore ODI series against South Africa and Pakistan in Ireland and Scotland, would also come up for ratification. 

Nimbus, which has signed a deal for $612 million with the BCCI for telecast rights of all international matches played in India, have been given a concession of Rs 357 crore following the governments decision to ask all private broadcasters to share the feed of matches played by India with public broadcaster Prasar Bharti.

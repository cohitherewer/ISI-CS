The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Countdown to crickets biggest show

 1999

The World Cup returned to England (as the ICC World Cup) after 16 years, though this time Ireland, Scotland and The Netherlands also hosted some games. In an altered format, the 12 contesting teams were divided into two groups in the league stage. The top three from each group advanced to the Super Sixes, where each qualifier from group A played against each qualifier from group B. The teams also carried forward points from games against the other two qualifiers from their group. The top four in the Super Sixes qualified for the semi-finals. 

The Steve Waugh-led Aussies rode their luck to the title round. In a one-sided final against Pakistan at Lords on June 20, the Aussies notched up a thumping victory. Pakistan, despite the early promise under the leadership of Wasim Akram, failed to put up a semblance of resistance as Australia cantered to an eight-wicket win. 

The going hadnt been at all easy for the Australians who were in danger of an early exit. They would have perhaps been shown the door had Herschelle Gibbs not celebrated too soon and literally thrown away a catch offered by Steve Waugh in their last Super Six match. 

In the semi-final four days later, as Damien Fleming bowled to Lance Klusener who was adjudged Player of the Tournament with South Africa needing one to win, the Aussies were practically resigned to losing. One of the greatest games in ODI history produced a final twist that no one could have foreseen. Klusener and Allan Donald had a horrendous mix-up resulting in a run out. The Aussies had kept their cool when it mattered most. The match was tied, and Australia went through on net run-rate. 

In the end, what made the difference was Steve Waughs astute leadership, the bowling performances of Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne, and the Aussies big-match temperament. 

Pakistan, on the other hand, lost three successive games but that didnt matter as they returned to form in time to blow away Zimbabwe and New Zealand. 

The overall quality of the Australian team meant that very few could begrudge their right to the title. But Pakistan and South Africa could have been worthy winners as well. 

Net run-rate was responsible for the failure of both England and the West Indies to reach the last six. If the West Indies had won quicker against Bangladesh, they would have qualified. 

Indias match against Pakistan at Old Trafford had taken place in the backdrop of full-scale warfare back home. The Manchester match, played under heavily policing, passed off calmly. India won by 47 runs, thanks largely to Venkatesh Prasads five-wicket haul. 

Heroes became zeroes in vastly different conditions as compared to 1996. Sanath Jayasuriya, the dominant figure of the last World Cup, scored 82 in five matches. The Sri Lankans failed to make any impact and, after the South African quicks blew their batsmen away in Northampton, they never threatened to make the final six. The reigning champions were the least competitive of the nine Test-playing nations. 

The biggest shock of the tournament happened on the final day of preliminary competitions when Bangladesh, already eliminated, beat Pakistan, already qualified, in an extraordinary match in Northampton. Only the previous evening, Bangladesh coach Gordon Greenidge had been given the sack, but he stayed with the team till lunch on match day. Bangladesh also beat Scotland, and so finished a respectable fifth in the group B table. 

In the Super Six, after incorporating the relevant results from the first phase, Zimbabwe had enough momentum to reach the semis. But New Zealand finally managed to beat India and squeezed out Zimbabwe on net run-rate. 

India struggled to progress further because the results they carried through to the Super Six were both defeats. Though they won the battle against Pakistan, they never had much chance of reaching the semi-finals. The highlight of their campaign was the blazing hitting by Sourav Ganguly (183) and Rahul Dravid (145) in Taunton, the duo collaborating 318 runs for the second wicket. India won by 157 runs. 

India suffered early when Sachin Tendulkar had to miss a game because of the death of his father. They also suffered because their back-up bowling was weak. Dravid, with 461 runs, was the leading scorer of the tournament. 

Zimbabwe and India went out after the Super Six. New Zealand, the surprise semi-finalists, quietly did just enough to stay afloat having won only one game of consequence against Australia in Cardiff in the group phase. In the Super Six, New Zealands match against Zimbabwe was abandoned due to rain, they lost to South Africa and won against India, who had already been eliminated. New Zealand played shrewd cricket and their bowling fully suited the conditions. 

One Shoaib Akhtar won Pakistan the semi-final against New Zealand. His raw pace and Saeed Anwars unbeaten 113 took them to the final. 

If Klusener emerged the most feared batsman, the most controversial decision involved South African coach Bob Woolmers plan to advise captain Hansie Cronje on the field via an earpiece. He was ultimately forced to abandon his hi-tech plan.

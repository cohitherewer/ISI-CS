 BCCI hasnt paid players for 7 months

New Delhi: The BCCI is the richest board in the world but, strangely, hasnt paid its players for the last seven months. 

Team India members have not got their dues since the Champions Trophy in October last year. Since then, the players have toured South Africa, played home series against the West Indies and Sri Lanka before flying to the West Indies for the World Cup. 

BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla sought to play down the issue and said arrears would be cleared once the contracts are signed. 

Once the contracts are signed, everything will be cleared. This is not a problem at all, he said. 

This is not the first time the cash-rich board has delayed payments. 

Former team physio Andrew Leipus and even John Wright faced similar treatment. 

Senior cricketers are unhappy that payments have been delayed, but the World Cup debacle along with the boards gag order has forced them to keep mum. 

Meanwhile, the board on Thursday said all players picked for the Bangladesh tour would be given a flat retainership of Rs 5 lakh. 

In addition to the flat retainership of Rs 5 lakh, the players would be entitled for match fee and bonus, said BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah on return from the West Indies. (PTI)

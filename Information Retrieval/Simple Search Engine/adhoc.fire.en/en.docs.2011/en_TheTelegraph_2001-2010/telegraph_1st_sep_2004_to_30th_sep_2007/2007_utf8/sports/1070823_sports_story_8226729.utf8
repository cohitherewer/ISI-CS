 Zaheer, RP appear tame sans swing

 - Bells century more eye-catching than Cooks Freddie back to his furious best

Maiden one-day hundreds by Alastair Cook and Ian Bell, followed by an incisive three-wicket burst from James Anderson, proved too much for India at the Rose Bowl, after England made 288 for two. Chasing such a big target is challenging whatever the conditions but under lights on a gloomy August evening it proved beyond even the visitors stellar batting line-up. 

It was a demolition, though the 104-run margin of victory will give England less cause to be happy than the manner, which oozed control. There was even a wicket for Andrew Flintoff, his first for England on home soil for more than 14 months after suffering a series of ankle injuries. 

Big Freddie bowled fast and furious, his choirboy haircut at odds with the brutal energy he imparted on the ball, which, according to the speedgun, occasionally reached 92mph. It was certainly too much for Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Indias big hitter, taking 60 balls before gloving a short ball from Flintoff behind. 

All of Englands pace bowlers shone, though their task was made easier following Andersons triple strike once, following Monty Panesars nifty run-out of Sourav Ganguly, he had dismissed Gautam Gambhir, Sachin Tedulkar and Yuvraj Singh in his opening six overs. 

Englands one-day cricket has suffered a paucity of hundreds, so to get two in the same match is riches indeed. But if you thought it might have rarity value, given Englands recent poor record in one-day cricket, the feat was also achieved against Bangladesh in 2005 and West Indies in 2004. 

Of the two here, Bells was the more eye-catching, his 126 made at better than a run-a-ball, with 10 fours and a six. He played quite beautifully too, a man whose tactics, shot selection and execution were in perfect harmony. 

The conditions certainly seduced India into putting England in to bat, though the nip in the air was not followed by any off the pitch. The lack of movement did not induce a flurry of strokes and when the third powerplay had ended in the 20th over, only eight shots had reached or cleared the rope. 

Despite the lack of boundaries, Cook and Bell gelled well in their 178-run partnership. One of their tactics was to run India ragged in the field. With the visitors containing three players older than 30 and two pace bowlers inclined to move like 40-year-olds, the pair pinched at least 25-30 runs a more athletic side would have prevented. 

Their other ploy was to ensure that Indias small army of part-time bowlers, Sachin Tedulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Yuvraj Singh, were treated like the lower ranks rather than top brass. 

With barely a slog played they ensured the trios 13 overs cost 79 runs, expensive given their use in the middle part of the innings. 

It was not the only shortcoming among Indias bowlers. Without swing, Zaheer, Ajit Agarkar and R.P. Singh present a fairly tame bowling force, one made weaker by geriatric fielding. Dravid rang the changes, but they could not stem the heavy toll extracted by Bells bat and Cooks clips and cuts. 

Cook eventually went for 102.

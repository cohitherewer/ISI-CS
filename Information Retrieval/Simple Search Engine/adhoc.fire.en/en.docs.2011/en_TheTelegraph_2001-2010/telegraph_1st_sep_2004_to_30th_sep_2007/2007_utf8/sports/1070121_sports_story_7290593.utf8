 BCCI accepts ICC rules 

Chennai: The BCCI on Saturday decided to accept the ICCs rules and regulations on Twenty-20 cricket by introducing them in the domestic circuit from either in the last week of March or first week of April. A decision to this effect was taken at the meeting of the BCCI technical committee, chaired by Sunil Gavaskar. 

The national one-day format would be adopted for Twenty20 and two teams each from the five zones would play a round-robin league at the national level. The top two teams would qualify for the final. 

The inter-zonal meets like Deodhar Trophy and Duleep Trophy would now be played in neutral/best venues . (PTI)

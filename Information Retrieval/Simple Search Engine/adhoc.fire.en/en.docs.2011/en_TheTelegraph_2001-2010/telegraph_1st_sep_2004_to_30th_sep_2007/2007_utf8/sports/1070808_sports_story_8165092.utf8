 PCB cant stop ICL-bound players: Javed

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Javed Miandad said that the PCB is an unconstitutional body and has no right to stop the cricketers from earning their livelihood. 

The players who have got offers to play in the Indian Cricket League (ICL) should join it for their better future, Miandad said on Tuesday. 

The board has been operating on an ad-hoc basis for the last eight years and constitutionally it is an illegal body. Thus it is not in a position to stop any player from earning his livelihood, he said. 

Miandad also advised PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf to stop threatening the players from taking part in the league. He should avoid doing it because the judiciary is totally independent in Pakistan and any player can easily approach it to get justice and this would put the board in an embarrassing position considering its legal status, he added. 

The board is trying to prevent the players from exercising their fundamental rights to earn a decent livelihood, he said. Otherwise the board should adequately compensate those players who have got concrete offers from the league organisers. (PTI)

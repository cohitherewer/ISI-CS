The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Im a natural leader, says Dhoni

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni 

Leeds: Mahendra Singh Dhoni does not subscribe to the safety-first notion when he wields the willow but the stumper-batsman reckons he would have to find a balance between caution and aggression when he leads India in the upcoming ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa. 

Dhoni, the ODI vice-captain, said batting and captaining are two distinctly different aspects of the game and an aggressive captain would need a judicious blend of both caution and aggression. 

Its different being an aggressive batsman and an aggressive captain. Of course, that instinct will be there but you need to balance both. 

A lot depends on how the team responds to your leadership, he said. Dhoni said he would like to pick up his skippers composure even when the situation is tense. 

He (Rahul Dravid) has ability to stay calm and cool under pressure... As a captain you got to be in control even when things are not going your way. It helps if you keep your nerves in a tense situation and avoid doing things in a rush. 

Asked if leadership comes naturally to him, Dhoni said: Thats for you guys to decide. But I am natural I like to do things my way and I take my own decisions in whatever I do. 

Dhoni reckons it has been a fairytale career for him to rise from the obscurity of Jharkhand to right at the helm of the team (for ICC World Twenty20). 

To be honest, I never dreamt of playing for India. I just played the game for the love of it. So just to play for India was like a good fairytale. 

To be named captain is a bit more special because Im just three years old in international cricket. Its a big opportunity. Its a big responsibility given to me and Ill give it my best shot. 

Dhoni would lead a team with seniors like Virender Sehwag, Ajit Agarkar, Yuvraj Singh and Harbhajan Singh and juniors like Joginder Sharma, Yusuf Pathan, Piyush Chawla, Rohit Sharma. And Dhoni says he is happy with the bunch. 

Its a nice blend of youth and experience. Its nice to have a bit of experience to deal with a tight situation because they have been there and done that before.

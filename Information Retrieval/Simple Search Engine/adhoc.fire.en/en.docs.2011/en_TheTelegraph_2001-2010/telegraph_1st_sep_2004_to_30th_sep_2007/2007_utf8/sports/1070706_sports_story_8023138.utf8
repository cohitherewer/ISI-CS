 Soma plans to quit after Olympics

A STAFF REPORTER

 Soma Biswas 

Calcutta: Heptathlete Soma Biswas is all set to hang up her boots after the Beijing Olympics next year. 

For the 29-year old, who had tied the knot a couple of months ago, the priority has now shifted to a family life, but before that, she wants to give one final shot at the elusive Olympic glory. 

Its time to concentrate on my personal life. Whether I make the Olympics cut or not, I have decided to quit after that, the Arjuna Awardee told The Telegraph on Thursday afternoon. 

But a hattrick of participation in the Olympics is what every sportsperson will relish. My sole focus is now on qualifying for the Beijing Games, Soma, who took part in the 2000 Sydney and 2004 Athens Olympics, said.I am satisfied with the way my career has shaped up so far But there is a time when every athlete should put a stop to it, she added. 

Soma, based in Ranaghat, won silver medals in heptathlon at Busan and Doha Asian Games in 2002 and 2004, respectively. 

The lanky Bengal girl, who had skipped the 13th Federation Cup because of her marriage, has resumed training recently. The break in the rigorous practice regime, she believed, wouldnt affect her in regaining momentum and claming a place in the Olympics. 

I know its a tough job, but I am confident of regaining the lost touch, she pointed out.

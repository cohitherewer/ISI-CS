 Torres ready to take a pay cut

 James Ducker 

Fernando Torres may be on the verge of becoming the most expensive signing in Liverpools history, but the Spain striker will take a pay cut to hasten his move to Anfield. Torres has also indicated that he is prepared to cut short his holiday to sign for Liverpool this week. But, failing that, the Atltico Madrid forward will fly to Merseyside to sign what is expected to be a five-year contract worth about 90,000 a week when he returns from the Polynesian Islands in seven days time. 

Although the deal will put him among the clubs best-paid earners, alongside Xabi Alonso and Jamie Carragher, it is still less than the annual 5.4 million he presently earns with Atltico and some way short of the reputed 120,000-a-week salary of Steven Gerrard, Liverpools highest-paid player. 

Liverpool have agreed a deal in principle with Atltico, although it is thought to be significantly less than the 27 million release clause stated in the players contract. It is thought that Liverpool will pay between $26-30 million, with Luis Garca, who is valued at about 4 million, moving the other way. 

The Torres transfer will not collapse if Garca rejects a return to his former club, however, and whatever the eventual cost, it will still comfortably eclipse the 14.2 million that Liverpool paid for Djibril Ciss, who is expected to complete his move to Marseilles early this week. 

The deal was held up over the weekend in the wake of late intervention from West Ham United.

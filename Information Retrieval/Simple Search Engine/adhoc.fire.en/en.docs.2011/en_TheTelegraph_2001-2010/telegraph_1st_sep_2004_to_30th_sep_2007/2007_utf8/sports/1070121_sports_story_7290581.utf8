London: Liverpool beat Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday for the first time in two and a half years, winning 2-0 to strengthen their hold on third place and dent the Blues title defence. 

Leaders Manchester United, on 57 points, can open a nine-point lead over second-placed Chelsea, beaten for the third time in the League, if they win at Arsenal on Sunday. Liverpool, third on 46, moved within five points of Chelsea and four clear of Arsenal. 

Liverpool, beaten 1-4 by Chelsea in the corresponding fixture last season, took just four minutes to go ahead. 

Peter Crouch glanced Jamie Carraghers long ball out of defence into the path of Dirk Kuyt and the Dutch striker rounded Paulo Ferreira and steered the ball past keeper Petr Cech, playing for the first time since a serious head injury in October. 

Liverpool went two up in the 18th minute with a superb strike from Jermaine Pennant, scoring his first goal for Rafa Benitezs side since arriving at Anfield last July. 

Were in there and we just have to keep hoping other (teams) keep slipping up, said Liverpool captain Gerrard, whose team have won eight of their last nine league games. 

The London side has been rocked lately by rumours of Mourinhos departure and a string of injuries and suspensions to key players including captain John Terry. 

When a team is very fragile on the pitch and mentally, this makes them not so self-confident, Mourinho told a TV sports channel. (Agencies)

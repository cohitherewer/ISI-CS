The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Vijay left waiting on No. 999 

 STAR RACER

 Mystros defeat, at the hands of Starlite and Active Asset, last Thursday, delayed celebration in trainer Vijay Singhs camp. The trainer scored a treble on the day but Mystro could have provided him the dream tally of 1000 wins. He is, however, in a far better position compared to a cricketer, who has to start afresh after his over-night score of 99 not out. 

 He is going to get umpteen number of chances in days to follow. Saturdays opener may in itself provide the champion trainer with the opportunity. Wish him a good luck.

 Mystro, a 11-10 favourite, was, nevertheless, beaten fair and square, though jockey C.Rajendra tried his hardest after assuming the charge of running from Errol Bhungards Starlite at the halfway stage of the 2,000 Pearson Surita Memorial Cup.

 Errols Remarquable also gave a scare to Vijays hot-favourite, Clockwork, in the 2,000m Baqlava Cup. The gutsy mare, however, responded well, despite her topweight, to Rajendras hard drives for a narrow win.

 Wild Mystery completed the win No. 998 for Vijay in the 1,400m Star Contender Handicap. Ridden by S.Shanker, the heavily-fancied mare thrashed Blazing Ability, who had lost nearly six lengths at the start but recovered fast in the hands of Jockey Gajender Singh.

 Rajendra had an armchair ride on Vijays baby, Secret Trooper, for winner No. 999, in the 1,400m Tambourine Man Plate. The Storm Trooper colt, a debutant, allowed a solidly fancied stablemate, Mazzano, to dictate terms till the 600m before decimating the opposition.

 Javed Khans Fighting Force, too, lost about six lengths at the start but apprentice Shane Domingo nursed the mare well in the rear till the final turn before making his winning move.

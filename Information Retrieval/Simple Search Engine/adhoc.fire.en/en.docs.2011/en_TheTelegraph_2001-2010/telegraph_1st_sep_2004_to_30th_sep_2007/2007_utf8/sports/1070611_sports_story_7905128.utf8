 Mansher bags Beijing berth

New Delhi: Shooter Mansher Singh has become the ninth Indian to qualify for next years Beijing Olympics after finishing fifth in the mens trap event at the ISSF World Cup in Lonato, Italy. 

Mansher shot a total of 140, including a superb 122 in the qualifiers, with three perfect series of 25 and a below-par final round in which he carded only 18 out of 25 on Saturday. 

The Delhi-based shooter, who was tied with Abdulrahman al Faihan of Kuwait and Masimo Fabbrizi of Italy, edged out the Kuwaiti in the tie-shoot for the quota place. 

According to the ISSF rules, one country can have only two Olympic berths. Manavjit Singh Sandhu had earlier bagged the other berth. (PTI)

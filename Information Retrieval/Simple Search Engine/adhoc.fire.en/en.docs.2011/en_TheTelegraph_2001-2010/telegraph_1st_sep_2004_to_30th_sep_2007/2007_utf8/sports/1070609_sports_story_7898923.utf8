 Chowrasia shares fourth position

 Chowrasia 

Koh Samui (Thailand): Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia found form with a round of five-under 66 that carried him to tied fourth place at the Bangkok Airways Open here on Friday. 

When play ended early in the second round due to darkness, Chowrasia was two shots off the lead held by Lee Sung Man, who turned in a two-under 69 to take a one-shot lead. 

Even as Chowrasia made some great birdies with his changed putter, another fine Indian performance came from Gurbaaz Mann who also shot 66 to move to tied ninth at three-under 139. 

Rahil Gangjee (72) and Gaurav Ghei (70) were tied 22nd at even par 142, while Arjun Singh (71) and Digvijay Singh (71) were four-over 146 in tied 52nd. 

Amandeep Johl had a better day at one-over 72, but because of his first round 78, he was sure to miss the cut at 150. 

Also missing the cut was Amardip Malik who followed his 83 with a 77. 

Chapchai Nirat (64) and Lin Wen Tang (67) occupied second place behind Lee at the scenic par-71 Santiburi Samui Country Club. Chowrasia was tied for fourth spot alongside Singapores Mardan Mamat and Adam Blyth (68). (PTI)

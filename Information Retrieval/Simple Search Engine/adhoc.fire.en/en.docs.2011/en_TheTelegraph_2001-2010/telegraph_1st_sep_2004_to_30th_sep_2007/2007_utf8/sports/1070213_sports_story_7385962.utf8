 Lankans fined for slow over-rate

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Sri Lanka team has been fined for maintaining a slow over-rate during its five-run win over India in the second ODI in Rajkot on Sunday. 

ICC Match Referee Alan Hurst imposed the fines after Mahela Jayawardenes side was ruled to be two overs short of its target at the scheduled finish of the Indian innings when time allowances were taken into consideration, according to an ICC media release. 

In accordance with the ICC Code of Conduct regulations governing over-rate penalties, players are fined five per cent of their match fees for every over their side fails to bowl in the allotted time, with the captain fined double that amount. 

As such, Jayawardene has been fined 20 per cent of his match fee while his players have each received ten per cent fines. 

The punishment is a Level 1 offence under the Code of Conduct; for such offences, the decision of the Match Referee is final and binding. 

PTI adds from Margao: Skipper Mahela Jayawardene said on arrival in Margao: We want to keep our winning momentum going. Its a big challenge to play in India and we want to go home by clinching the series at least with a 2-1 margin.

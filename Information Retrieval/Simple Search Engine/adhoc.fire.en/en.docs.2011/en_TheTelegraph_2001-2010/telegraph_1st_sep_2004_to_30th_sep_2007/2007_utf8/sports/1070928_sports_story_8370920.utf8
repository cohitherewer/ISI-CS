 Prove yourself first: Usha 

Kozhikode: P.T. Usha thinks sportspersons should first prove their mettle before demanding incentives, rejecting suggestions that sports other than cricket received step-motherly treatment from state governments. 

The multi-Asian Games gold medallist also endorses the BCCIs decision to reward Mahendra Singh Dhoni amp; Co. in cash and kind for their World Twenty20 triumph and believes that this will only intensify competition in other sports and they can also expect such accolades once they prove their might. 

Usha, who earned Rs 2 lakh in cash and a house when she had won the Asian championship gold in 1985, said on Thursday: There were days when athletes alone used to bring laurels to the country and athletes including me were given top attention. (PTI)

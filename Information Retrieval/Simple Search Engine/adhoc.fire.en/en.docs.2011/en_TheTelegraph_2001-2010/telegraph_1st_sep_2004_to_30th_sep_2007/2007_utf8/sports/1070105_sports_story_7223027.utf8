The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Md. Sporting hope to snatch a point vs JCT

 - Stadium doors shut on footballers for security reasons 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: A day before the 11th edition of the National Football League (NFL) kicks off at the Ambedkar Stadium here with a match between JCT and Mohammedan Sporting, the doors of the stadium were closed for footballers. 

With the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh set to inaugurate the high-profile league on Friday afternoon, the Special Protection Group (SPG) in-charge of VVIP security has simply taken over control of the Mecca of Delhi football. So much so, that the two contesting sides for the opening encounter have been denied the rights to have a feel of the pitch for 45 minutes each on the eve of the match. 

While the refusal of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) to allow the two teams to practice as per the tournament rules have left the two coaches bitter and furious, a full-strength SPG force with sniffer dogs and the Bomb Disposal Squad have barricaded the entire ground and monitoring each and every person coming into it. 

Two seasons back, Subhas Bhowmick, then East Bengal coach, made a big hue and cry after his team was kept waiting for a long time in the NFL opener at Calcuttas Salt Lake Stadium. On Thursday he looked a man resigned to his fate. 

They didnt allow us to practice, he complained but said he was not going to raise his voice against it. The Indian football is full of injustice. I am tired of pointing it out. Let someone else do it this time, he said. 

Perhaps, the Mohammedan Sporting coach has too many other problems on his hands than fighting over the practice stint at the Ambedkar Stadium. Without a foreigner and a sharp shooter upfront, Bhowmick is hoping against hope to steal at least one point from their more fancied rivals. 

We have played well in the last three tournaments but lost out because of our lack of goal scoring ability, he said. I have Harvinder and Bijen Singh, but induction of either Mike (Okoro) or Omolaja (Olalekan) would have been much better. We should be better off if we get Basudeb Mondal in the next few days. 

Bhowmick said his team would not be too defensive. I promise to deliver good football, he added. Ironically, JCT coach Sukhwinder Singh also believes that Mohammedan Sporting might play good football. 

They did well in Durand and the Federation Cups. There is no question of taking them lightly, said the former India coach. In 1998, we had a team full of Punjab boys, yet we held mighty Mohun Bagan to a goalless draw. The presence of foreigners cannot be the sole reason for calling us the favourites, he said. 

Sukhwinder is trying to play down things for obvious reasons, but there is no doubt that the Phagwara side stands taller than the Calcutta club at least on paper. With two skillful Nigerians Adebayo and Edeh Chidi leading the attack and Rennedy Singh and Shivraj Singh manning the midfield, it would be a sort of upset if Mohammedan Sporting manage to snatch a point from the Punjab outfit. JCT, however, will miss the services of midfielder Sukhjinder Singh and defender Narender Singh, who are injured. 

Though the programme of the Prime Minister has been finalised minute by minute, the local organisers have yet not been able to spell out the exact kick off time of the match. The likely starting time is 2.30 pm.

 Vaughan relies on youth brigade

Montego Bay: Englands inexperience could work to their advantage in the World Cup. Captain Michael Vaughan feels that his young brigade will rise to the challenge. 

A young team can sometimes be surprising, Vaughan said on Sunday at Sabina Park. 

They can sometimes have no fear. I see that in some of the young players they dont fear many situations and that is exactly what they will have to be like in the next few weeks. 

We have an environment where not necessarily the oldest player in the squad comes up with the best idea... 

Who is to say that the youngest guy in the squad doesnt have the best idea?, Vaughan said.

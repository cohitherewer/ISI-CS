The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Players need to take initiative: Steve

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AND AGENCIES

Barcelona: Former Australia captain Steve Waugh said players have to take the initiative if the problem of match-fixing is to be eradicated from the sport. 

I dont want it in cricket. I think it is terrible, disgusting, Waugh told reporters on Monday at the Laureus sports awards here (as reported in Tuesdays Late City edition). But what do you do to stop it? I dont think the ICC or anyone knows how to stop it or it would have been stopped before. 

They formed a committee years ago and nothing much seems to have changed. Really its about the players, they have to put their hands up and say Im 100 percent or sign declarations but something has to be done because it is damaging the sport. Something serious has to happen now or the game will be damaged for ever. 

The World Cup in the Caribbean has been overshadowed by the death of Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer, who Jamaican police say was strangled. Speculation has been rife that his death more than two weeks ago could be linked to match fixing. 

Waugh said that it would be wrong to believe that the problem was just confined to Pakistan. It would be pretty naive to say it was just one or two countries. I dont know who is involved but the odds are it is more than one or two countries. 

With security for players and coaches such a live issue, Waugh said he would not advise the Australian team to tour Zimbabwe later this year. 

Its easy for me to say that because when youre a player its your career and you dont want to get too involved in things like that, Waugh said. But I think it will be tough for them to go in that environment with whats happening in Zimbabwe. Ive got the feeling they probably wont go. 

Its a difficult question for Ricky (Ponting) but I feel the Australian players probably generally feel they dont want to go. I might be speaking out of school, but Ive got the feeling they think it is not the right thing to do. 

Steve also criticised the ICC and the World Cup organisers, insisting that the empty grounds were a clear indication that they have got it wrong. 

Waugh said: Its crazy. I dont get it. The Caribbean is a great place to play cricket, it was my favourite place in the world to play cricket the crowds were so into the game, there was a lot of music, they got stuck in and talked about the game, they had fun. Then all of a sudden we see nothing for the World Cup. There is something clearly wrong there, with no music, no instruments. 

Someone has got it wrong, the pricing of tickets is too dear, they would not let instruments into the grounds, and it is part of the essence of Caribbean cricket. Thats what its all about. 

The ICC tend to get blamed for most things, so I dont know if it the fault of the ICC or the authorities in the Caribbean. Surely, getting local people and youngsters into the matches should have been one of the motivating factors of hosting the World Cup on the islands. They should have listened to the local people and what they wanted. 

On the tournament itself, two-times winner Waugh said his compatriots looked the form side. Australia are not doing anything wrong and can only get better. They are shaping up, but at the moment I could see any one of four sides winning it. 

Australia are good, New Zealand look good, South Africa I have an inkling that it is maybe their time and Sri Lanka are a strong unit. Any of these four sides can win it. 

England, Waugh believes, do not look strong and are relying on two world-class players, in Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff. To be honest, England have not looked good for four months, even though they beat Australia, who ran out of puff and were fatigued. England are not a great side on paper and have only two world class players. If Flintoff and Pietersen do well, England do well, if they dont, they wont.

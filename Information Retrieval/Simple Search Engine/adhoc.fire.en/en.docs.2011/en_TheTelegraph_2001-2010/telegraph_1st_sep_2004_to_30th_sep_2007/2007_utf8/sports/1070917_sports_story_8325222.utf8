Calcutta: Chaos and confusion reigned at the airport as thousands gathered to welcome Federation Cup champions East Bengal on Sunday evening. 

The champion side, which beat Mahindra United 2-1 in the final in Ludhiana, was greeted to live music, the blowing of conch shells and the beating of drums. Some even offered a pair of hilsas to Edmilson Marques, the Brazilian who scored six goals (including two in the final) in three matches. 

Coach Subrata Bhattacharya, however, managed to dodge the enthusiastic fans while the players were taken to a dais for an impromptu felicitation. 

The Telegraph spoke to the coach and some of the players. The following are excerpts (alphabetically): 

Subrata Bhattacharya: A big achievement in my career... I am extremely happy. I knew they (the players) had it in them... I only guided them and counselled them in the right direction. The whole credit goes to the players. The secret has been hard work and team spirit All of them played total football and gave their best. 

Asim Biswas: Its been long since East Bengal last won the Federation Cup. I am happy that we have succeeded in our endeavour. Its great to see the fans so happy. 

Dipendu Biswas: I cannot describe my feelings now A dream come true. Babluda has played a huge role behind this success The team spirit kept us going. Nice that our hard work has paid off. 

Madhab Das: I am really very happy I cannot say much Let me enjoy the moment I want to be part of this celebration. 

Alvito DCunha: The victory is one of the biggest achievements in my life Its always great to see all these fans happy and celebrating. We played as a unit and stuck to what Babluda told us It has paid off and we are the champs. It would be great if we can hold this momentum I feel honoured. 

Edmilson Marques: Feels great I have never seen such huge crowd celebrating I am honoured. 

Subrata Paul: I never dreamt of such a hearty welcome I am flabbergasted I cannot say anything more. 

Jayanta Sen: Its one of the best days of my life I was also part of the Mohun Bagan squad that won the Federation Cup last year This victory is the reflection of our team work Our game matured as the tournament progressed and we grew confident.

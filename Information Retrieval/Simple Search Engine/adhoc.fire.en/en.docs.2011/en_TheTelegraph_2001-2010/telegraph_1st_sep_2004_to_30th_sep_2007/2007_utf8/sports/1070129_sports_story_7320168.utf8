 Australia edge NZ by 8 runs

 - 3 centuries in high-scoring tie 

Perth: Matthew Hayden and Ricky Ponting made centuries and shared a 200-run second-wicket partnership as Australia scraped in an eight-run win over New Zealand in a tri-series one-day International on Sunday. 

Hayden made 117 from 111 balls and Ponting 111 from 122 as Australia reached 343 for five after winning the toss and batting first. This was the highest score by any team in a limited-overs match at the WACA. 

Jacob Oram smashed 101 not out from only 72 balls, putting on 137 in an unbroken partnership with Brendon McCullum (46 not out), as New Zealand reached 335 for five in reply, failing narrowly to overhaul Australias massive total. 

Orams century from 71 balls contained four fours and six sixes and was the fastest by a New Zealander in an ODI. It was also his first ODI century.

 Baghdatiss confession

MARIO RODRIGUES

 Marcos Baghdatis 

Mumbai: Hes pulled out of the tournament due to injury and put the promoters of the Kingfisher Airlines Tennis Open in a bit of pickle as a result. 

Yet, the promoters rolled out the red carpet for Marcos Baghdatis who was able to get all the flashbulbs popping and all the television cameras rolling when he hauled up in town to make amends. 

Mumbai tennis lovers will not get a chance to see Marcos play but those who encountered him off the court were taken up by the refreshing candour of the 22-year-old Cypriot. Baghdatis freely admitted to his faux pas and his follies that saw him slide down a bit after showing high promise as an Australian Open finalist in 2006 and a Wimbledon semi-finalist the same year. 

Baghdatis frankly confessed that he was unable to handle all the attention that followed his Melbourne final appearance: My life changed a lot after that tournament and its never been the same since. It became a bit difficult to cope and it was tough trying to find my way through as I was not mature in my head; and besides, my team was not so experienced. But you learn from your mistakes and hopefully things will get better from here. 

Baghdatis suffered a wrist injury at the China Open in Beijing earlier this month where the defending champion was knocked out in the quarter final by Ivan Ljubicic. Incidentally, Baghdatis had beaten the same player in the Zagreb final earlier this year. 

He plans to start hitting on Wednesday after which he will also see a doctor to get a low down on his recovery process. Reflecting on that defeat, Baghdatis said the Croat was playing very well on that day but he did not take his chances.

Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutia apologised for his red-card and said he should have kept his cool during the match against Sao Paulo on Sunday. 

Im sorry for the team and fans. I knew I shouldve kept my cool but I reacted only when the Sao Paulo physio (Marco) insulted me, Bhaichung said late in the evening. 

Bhaichung was red-carded for a clumsy foul on Sao Paulo defender Flavio and then pushed Marco down to the ground. 

While Mohun Bagan club officials decided to have a discussion with Bhaichung over his conduct, captain Jose Ramirez Barreto defended his teammate, saying that receiving red card is a part of the game. 

Bhaichung wanted to win the match for us and thats why, he was so excited and energetic in the match. But it (getting the marching orders) sometimes happens its part and parcel of the game, Barreto said after the match. 

The Brazilian, however, admitted that Bhaichungs departure had a serious impact on the teams plans. 

Hes our key player and, obviously, his red-card has upset our plans. We had to defend a lot once he left the ground, Barreto maintained. 

Sao Paulo coach Antonio Carlos echoed the same feeling and said Bhaichungs exit has helped us a lot as we were able to gain the upper hand in the match. 

A senior club official said he would talk to the player over the issue. Bhaichung must remember that he is not an ordinary player. He is a role model for so many young players and he should have been aware of the position he is in, the official added. 

About five months ago, during the CFL Premier Division match against East Bengal, Bhaichung did an act of similar proportion when he refused to leave the ground and watched the rest of the match on the players bench after being red-carded. 

Bhaichung apologised later on, promising to better his on-field image. 

If Bhaichungs is a case of disgrace on Sunday, the best compliment came for Barreto when the Sao Paulo coach said hes capable of playing in a medium-level club in the Brazilian first division league. 

Asked for his reaction, Barreto laughed and brushed aside any possibility of returning home. 

Im happy with Mohun Bagan and theres no question of going back home.

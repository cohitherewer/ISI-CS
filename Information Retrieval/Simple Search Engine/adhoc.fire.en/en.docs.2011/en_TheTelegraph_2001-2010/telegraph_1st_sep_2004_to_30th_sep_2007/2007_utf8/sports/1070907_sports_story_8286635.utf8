 Dempo refuse to release players for Dubai tour

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The feel-good atmosphere in Indian football was marred on Thursday when Dempo Sports Club coach Armando Colaco said he wont release his players for the national teams tour of Dubai beginning September 25. 

The AIFF has arranged the exposure-cum-training tour on the insistence of national coach Bob Houghton ahead of Indias World Cup qualifiers against Lebanon on October 8 (away) and 28 (home). 

Dempo, who are the National Football League champions, are currently in Ludhiana for their Federation Cup campaign and would play their first match against Chirag United on Friday. 

The Goan team has three players Climax Lawrence, Mahesh Gawli and Clifford Miranda who played a stellar role in Indias recent triumph in the Nehru Cup. Another footballer defender Samir Naik has also been called for the camp. 

Speaking from Ludhiana, the Dempo coach said he was upset that his players were taken away to play matches which had nothing to do with Fifa-recognised tournaments.

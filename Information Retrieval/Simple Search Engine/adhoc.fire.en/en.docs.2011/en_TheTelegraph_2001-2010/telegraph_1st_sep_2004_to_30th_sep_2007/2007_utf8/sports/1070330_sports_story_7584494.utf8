The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its never easy to be a part of this team: Hayden 

St Johns: Matthew Hayden knows better than most that is not easy to play for Australia and the record-breaking opening batsman wouldnt have it any other way. 

The 35-year-old left-hander achieved the highest score by an Australian at the World Cup in making 158 against the West Indies as the reigning champions began the Super Eight stage of the tournament with a thumping 103-run win over the hosts in a match split over two days because of rain. 

Early in his career, hayden had to battle past the likes of Matthew Elliott and Michael Slater for a Test spot and, more recently, he was dropped from the one-day side for the best part of a year after the 2005 tour of England with Phil Jaques, Shane Watson and Simon Katich all given a run instead. 

But he forced his way back in and last month scored an Australian one-day record 181 not out against New Zealand in Hamilton a match where his toe was broken by fast bowler Mark Gillespie. 

Ive had a lot of commitment and passion, to get back into the one-day side, said Hayden, whose innings topped Queensland pal Andrew Symondss previous Australian tournament best of 143 not out against Pakistan in Johannesburg four years ago. 

In particular, to represent Australia at the World Cup is an enormous privilege and honour, Hayden added. Its a special side to be a part of and its never meant to be an easy thing to play for Australia. 

There are guys who arent here right now and one or two who are with us who deserve the right to be playing. Thats the way the Australia cricket team keeps its edge and its intensity. Im sure someone like Brad Hodge has a brilliant career ahead of him but he just cant get in right now. 

You have to be very determined to go out there and prove to the side and the people that you are good enough to play, said the hard-hitting Hayden in Australias preceding victory over South Africa. 

I said when I got dropped a couple of years back that I didnt feel I was ready to let the (one-day) game go that world-class players play both forms of the game. 

Im just very happy that its coming off right now. (AFP)

the highlights

 Matthew

 Hayden rsquo;s 158 was the highest by an Australian batsman in the

 World Cup. Teammate Andrew Symonds rsquo; unbeaten 143 against Pakistan at

 Johannesburg in the 2003 edition was the previous best.

 Hayden rsquo;s 158 was the second-highest score by any ODI batsman against

 the West Indies after Mark Waugh rsquo;s 173 at Melbourne in 2001.

 Hayden also became the fourth batsman to record

 back-to-back centuries in World Cup. Compatriot Mark Waugh, India rsquo;s Rahul

 Dravid and Saeed Anwar of Pakistan are the others to do so.

 Australia (322/6) became the first team in ODIs

 to make six 300-plus scores in as many matches. Australia rsquo;s run began in the tour of New Zealand

 (Auckland mdash; 336/4, Hamilton mdash; 346/5) and the sequence continued

 during this World Cup mdash; their scores being 336/4, 346/5 and 377/6 in

 St Kitts against Scotland, The Netherlands and South Africa, respectively and

 322/6 against the West Indies in Antigua.

 This

 was the first ODI since 2004 to be spread over two days.

 The 103-run loss was West Indies rsquo; worst

 defeat in World Cup. The team had lost to Kenya at Pune in 1996 by 73 runs.

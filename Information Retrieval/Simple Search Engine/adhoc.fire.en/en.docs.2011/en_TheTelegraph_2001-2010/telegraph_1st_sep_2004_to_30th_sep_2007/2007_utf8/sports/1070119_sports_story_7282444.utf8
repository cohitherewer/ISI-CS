Mumbai: The West Indies cricket team, scheduled to play four one-dayers against India, arrived in batches here on Thursday. 

A group of five Chris Gayle, Marlon Samuels, Daren Powell, Dwayne Bravo and Ian Bradshaw along with manager and former captain Clive Lloyd, reached the city early on Thursday. They were joined later by the rest of the team, including captain Brian Lara. 

The series provides the West Indies one last chance to look at a few players before finalising their combination for the World Cup.

The line-up, however, looks pretty settled for the Caribbeans, who in their last series against Pakistan faced reversals in both the Tests and one-dayers. 

The performance of Trinidad and Tobago allrounder Reyad Amrit would be viewed with great interest while the same applies to Devon Smith and Darren Sammy, who have been recalled. 

The visitors would play their opening match of the series at Nagpur on Sunday, followed by matches at Cuttack (January 24), Chennai (January 27) and Vadodara (January 31). 

They would leave for Nagpur, the venue for the opening match, from here on Friday. 

The squad 

Brian Lara (captain), Ian Bradshaw, Dwayne Bravo, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Reyad Emrit, Chris Gayle, Runako Morton, Daren Powell, Denesh Ramdin, Darren Sammy, Marlon Samuels, Lendl Simmons, Devon Smith and Jerome Taylor. 

Coach: Bennett King. Manager: Clive Lloyd.

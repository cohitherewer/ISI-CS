The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sachin to quit ODIs first

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar was in the city on Tuesday for a promotional. He did not entertain any query on captaincy, as was announced on Monday. But he did answer a couple of other cricketing questions. 

Asked about the ICC World Twenty20, Sachin said: Its been fantastic, watching the Twenty20 matches. India have been playing well, though the last match didnt quite go our way. But the tournament is still open and my good wishes are with the team. 

[Later in a TV interview, Sachin said he would first stop playing ODIs before quitting cricket altogether.] 

India toured England without a coach. How much of a role did the seniors play? 

Whether there is a coach or not, I always share my thoughts with the youngsters. 

If I find something missing in their game, I always point it out and I encourage even the youngest member to approach me with any problem whatsoever, in their game or even in mine, he said.

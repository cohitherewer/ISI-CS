 Woolmer threatened to quit, says report

 Bob Woolmer

Karachi: Shoaib Akhtar was fined $2,500 for his alleged misbehaviour with coach Bob Woolmer, who had threatened to resign if disciplinary action was not taken against the pacer. 

Team manager Talat Ali imposed the fine on Shoaib only after Woolmers threat, a newspaper reported on Wednesday. 

Woolmer had threatened to resign if no action was taken against Shoaib who, he claimed, had misbehaved with him on the second day of the Port Elizabeth Test. 

The altercation occurred on the ground before the start of the days play and carried into the dressing room after Shoaib informed the management that he could not bowl on the second day due to a hamstring problem. 

When Woolmer learnt about this, he pointedly told Shoaib that if he was not fit, he should not have come to South Africa and his absence in the middle of the match would create a lot of problems for the team. This incensed Shoaib who had a war of words with the coach, the report said. 

Woolmer is reported to have told Ali that he was going to resign if the matter was not investigated into. Ali, a former Test player, asked the other players about the incident and although many of them wanted Shoaib to be forgiven, the team manager decided to fine the bowler. 

Former Pakistan captain Imran Khan backed Shoaib, saying he should have been kept with the team despite his injury problems. You keep your match winners with the team and Shoaibs only two bursts put Pakistan in the match winning position in the Port Elizabeth Test, Imran told reporters. 

The PCB, meanwhile, has turned down a request from captain Inzamam-ul Haq to send Shabbir Ahmed to South Africa. 

The team management requested that Shabbir be sent before Fridays final Test, but the selectors felt he is still not match fit and there are issues over bowling action, PCB official Ehsan Malik said. (PTI)

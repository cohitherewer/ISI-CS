 Federer close to 12th Slam

New York: Top seed Roger Federer remained on course for his fourth consecutive US Open title by beating combative Russian Nikolay Davydenko 7-5, 6-1, 7-5 in the semi-finals on Saturday. 

In Sundays final, the Swiss maestro will face Novak Djokovic, who became the first Serbian man to reach a Grand Slam final when he defeated Spains David Ferrer 6-4, 6-4, 6-3. 

Federer said Djokovic has done an incredible job this year by climbing up the rankings to his current spot at No. 3. 

I can only be impressed by his performances because at this young age I never had results like this, Federer said of the 20-year-old Djokovic. First Grand Slam final, obviously its a big occasion for him. 

Hes done an incredible job, because I remember the first time I played him in Monaco. I beat him in three sets. Everybody was wondering, What do you think? I was like, Not crazy impressed. 

But hes had a great run and hes really improved his game. 

Federer committed an uncharacteristic 25 unforced errors against Davydenko and had his serve broken five times. 

But the 26-year-old Russian was broken nine times and won only 32 per cent of his second serves while losing to the Swiss for the 10th time in a row. 

The wind definitely played a factor, said Federer. It was much easier to hold serve from the one end, obviously serving with the wind. 

We had to adjust our games and maybe not chase the lines so much, play more safe. 

Fourth-seeded Davydenko broke Federers serve in the first game of the match and led 3-1 before the world No. 1 recovered to take the set in a steamy Arthur Ashe Stadium. 

Davydenko had two set points in the third set but Federer, aiming for his 12th Grand Slam crown to join Roy Emerson in second place on the all-time list behind Pete Samprass 14, fought back to secure the victory in two hours and 21 minutes. 

Federer, 26, holds a 4-1 career record over Djokovic, but lost to the talented Serb in their last meeting, a three-set match last month at the Montreal Masters. 

He played great, I mean, from the baseline. I have to say he was very consistent. He played very effective as well on his forehand side. He just hit the ball really well, said Federer of that match. 

On Saturday, Djokovic trailed 1-4 in the opening set against Ferrer but recovered with service breaks in the seventh and ninth games to win the opening frame and set the tone for the match. 

I started really nervous, Djokovic said. Ive played a lot of difficult matches, (spent) a lot of hours on the court these two weeks so I didnt have a lot of energy. 

Djokovic served and volleyed well, winning 18 out of 22 points at the net. 

It was very important for me to serve well in the important moments, which I did, said Djokovic. 

It was a relief for me that I won in straight set. If I had lost that third set, who knows what could have happened. 

Djokovic said his success in reaching the showpiece match in New York would be greeted with delight in Serbia. 

Its the No. 1 sport now, he said. Certainly everybodys following me, and the girls. If you win against the best player in the world, and we all know how Rogers playing, hes basically unbeatable, its a big success for my country.

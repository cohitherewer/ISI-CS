 Chopra slips to tied 62nd

Honolulu: Daniel Chopra ran into putting problems and ended with a two-over 72 that dropped him to a tied 62nd place after the second round of the Sony Open, the seasons first full field event of the year on US Tour. 

The Swede, who was placed 24th at the end of the first round, however, made the cut, just on the line as it came at even par 140. Luke Donald shot a four-under-par 66 in the second round to retain a share of the lead with American Paul Goydos. (PTI)

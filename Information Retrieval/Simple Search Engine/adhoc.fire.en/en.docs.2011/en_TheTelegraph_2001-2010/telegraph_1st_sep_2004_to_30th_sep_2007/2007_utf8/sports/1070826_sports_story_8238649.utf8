London: Chelsea went top of the Premier League when they beat Portsmouth 1-0 at Stamford Bridge on Saturday and Manchester City lost 0-1 at Arsenal. 

Frank Lampards 31st-minute strike was enough to extend Chelseas record unbeaten home league run to 65 matches and move them on to 10 points from four this season. 

Manchester City goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel saved a 66th minute penalty from Robin van Persie, but had no chance of stopping a shot from Cesc Fabregas 14 minutes later, ending Citys perfect start to the season. They have nine points from four games. 

Liverpool moved on to seven points from three games after winning 2-0 at Sunderland in an early kick-off at the Stadium of Light. 

Mohamed Sissoko scored his first goal after 75 matches at Liverpool the 7,000th in their league history to put Liverpool ahead, while Andriy Voronin added the second three minutes from time. Liverpools Sami Hyypia broke his nose after a collision and had to be replaced after 16 minutes by Daniel Agger. In the second half, defender Jamie Carragher was taken off with a rib injury and went to the hospital for X-rays. 

Bolton picked up their first points after three straight defeats with goals from Gary Speed, Nicolas Anelka and substitute Daniel Braaten giving them a 3-0 win over Reading. 

Aston Villa beat Fulham 2-1 at Villa Park for their first win of the season, Birmingham City won 2-1 at Derby County, while Wigan Athletic drew 1-1 at West Ham United to keep their place among the early season pace-setters. 

In Bundesliga, Bayern Munich beat Hanover 96 3-0 at the Allianz Arena to make it three wins out of three and take a two-point lead at the top of the table. 

Bayern took the lead in the 28th minute when Luca Toni struck with his third goal of the season. 

 Hanover 96 had Altin Lala sent 

 off before the end of the first half and Bayern helped themselves 

 to another satisfying victory with goals from Mark van Bommel 

 and Hamit Altintop.

 Chance for Giggs to crown his greatness

TIM RICH

Should Ryan Giggs lift the FA Cup for Manchester United on Saturday, he is unlikely to celebrate by standing on his head in front of Wembleys main stand, which is how Arthur Kinnaird marked his fifth FA Cup winners medal after the Old Etonians had overcome Blackburn in 1882. 

Aside from five winners medals a feat also achieved by Charles Wollaston for Wanderers, there is not much to link Giggs with Lord Kinnaird. 

Whereas the former is the one of the most graceful players ever to set his boots on a football field, Kinnaird tackled like a Victorian version of Vinnie Jones. Even if he finishes Thursday, he stands high in the history of our club given the number of games he has played, Sir Alex Ferguson said Wednesday. He has been tramping up and down that left wing for 15 or 16 years and there has been no player who has done that in the history of the Premier League. 

With Gary Neville due to undergo an operation on an ankle injury, Giggs will lead United at Wembley, 13 years after his first final and against the same opponents, Chelsea. 

When they come into a dressing-room, young players, even Rooney and Ronaldo, are influenced by what Giggs has achieved, said Ferguson, who acknowledges that he is not a vocal captain in the style of Neville or Roy Keane. There is no doubt, though, that in a quiet way, Ryan will give the right advice to all the players, Ferguson said.

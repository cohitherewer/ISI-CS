Calcutta: It seems Bengal will once again bank on their medium-pacers to give the start they have been giving sor far in the Super League, when they take on Karnataka in the Ranji Trophy semi-final beginning at home on Tuesday. 

One man obviously can gauge this better than anyone else Venkatesh Prasad, the Karnataka coach. I have been watching the Bengal medium-pacers progress and so have specific plans for them, Prasad said on the eve of the crucial tie. 

Out of the 92 wickets picked up by the bowlers, 82 were bagged by the medium-pacers Ranadeb Bose, Sourav Sarkar, Ashok Dinda, Sourav Ganguly, Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Eklakh Ahmed. 

With the Eden wicket already having a greenish look, Ranadeb, Sourav and Dinda were all itching to get on to their act. The star performer Ranadeb, however, was yet to inspect the pitch. I dont see the wicket before the match. I walk around it but never inspect it, Ranadeb told The Telegraph, while the junior Sourav had a different approach. 

There are no plans but to run through the opposition batting order on a wicket like this, he said. 

Coach Paras Mhambrey and captain Deep Dasgupta have all the reasons to smile and speak highly of their teammates, who played like champions all through the premier tournament. We have played good cricket and want to continue that in the next two matches (provided they win this match), Deep said. 

Both the captain and the coach defended their opener Arindam Das who is not in the best of touches. Every cricketer passes through this phase and Im sure he (Das) will be back among runs and well do well in the batting department too, Mhambrey said. 

There are very less chances of making any changes in the final XI that played against Rajasthan even as former India A medium-pacer Shib Shankar Paul was trying his best to stage a comeback. Paul, who was out due to injury, was however ignored by the selectors on the pretext of not disturbing the winning combination. 

On the other hand, Karnataka coach Venkatesh Prasad will mainly depend on the teamwork. And Anil Kumbles absence will not be problem for his team. 

Anil needed rest and he has been granted that. Its okay with us, Prasad said. 

Karnataka will also miss the services of Robin Uthappa, the highest run-getter in Ranji Trophy so far with 854 runs in seven matches with four centuries. Their next best batsman captain Yere Goud has amassed 450 in six matches. 

Robin has scored in all matches and so we will miss but that is part of the game, Prasad said. 

Prasad was all praise for the wicket and went on to the extent of saying its a model track. This sort of wicket should be there in all matches and then only the game can develop in all aspects, he said. 

As bowling coach of the Indian colts, Venkatesh Prasad did a great job and it is to be seen whether Karnatakas bowling attack led by D. Vinay Kumar can turn the tables on Bengal at their own backyard.

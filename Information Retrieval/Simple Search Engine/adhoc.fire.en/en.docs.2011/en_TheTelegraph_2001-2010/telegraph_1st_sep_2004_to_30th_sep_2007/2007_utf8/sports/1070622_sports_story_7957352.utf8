 Sri Lanka go easy on Atapattu

 Maravan Atapattu 

Colombo: Former Sri Lanka captain Maravan Atapattu will not be subjected to a disciplinary inquiry despite his self-imposed absence from the home series against Bangladesh, officials said here on Thursday. 

It was initially expected that the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) would ask the 37-year-old right-hander to show cause for his decision to stay out of the team despite being included in the 15-man squad. 

We will speak to him on his contractual obligations (with Sri Lanka Cricket), but stop short of taking disciplinary action, a senior SLC official said. 

Jayantha Dharmadasa, the SLC chief, said they would go easy on Atapattu. We will have to consider Marvans services to the country as a player and captain, he said, suggesting that the national governing body would not pursue any drastic action. Atapattu is one of SLCs 18 contracted players. 

The last of his 88 Tests was in December 2005 and he was overlooked for the entirety of the World Cup and the subsequent series with Pakistan in Abu Dhabi. Atapattu was recalled to the side for the Bangladesh series. He announced his surprising pullout last week, citing personal commitments. 

Upul Tharanga injured a foot and has been ruled out of the first two Tests against Bangladesh, an SLC official said on Thursday. Tharanga was hit on his foot by a Lasith Malinga delivery this morning (Thursday), SLC secretary Kangadaran Mathivanan said. (AFP)

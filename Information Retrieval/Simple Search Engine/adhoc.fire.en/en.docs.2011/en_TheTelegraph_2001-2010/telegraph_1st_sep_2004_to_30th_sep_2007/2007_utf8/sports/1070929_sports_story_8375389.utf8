 No deadline for coach: BCCI

Mumbai: The BCCI has postponed Saturdays meeting in Bangalore and made it clear that it was not fixing any deadline to appoint a new coach for Team India. 

We are not going to say when hes (coach) going to be appointed. It will be done in reasonably quick time, treasurer N. Srinivasan said at a press conference. 

Our president (Sharad Pawar) was not available for the meeting. We have not met yet and gone through any applications for the job that have been received by us, he said. 

There was little time. Players have just come back from England and then from the World Twenty20 meet. We have back-to-back matches against Australia, he added. (PTI)

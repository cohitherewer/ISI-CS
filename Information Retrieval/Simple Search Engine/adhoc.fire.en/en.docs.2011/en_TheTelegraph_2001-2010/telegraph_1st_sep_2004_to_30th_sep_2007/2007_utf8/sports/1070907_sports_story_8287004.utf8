The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I still respect the Board: Kapil

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Kapil 

Calcutta: I dont know what you mean by the possibility of a compromise, but Ive still got respect for everybody in the Board Only, Mr (Inderjit Singh) Bindra shouldnt go around telling lies 

The Indian Cricket League (ICL) chairman, World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev, made his point rather firmly. 

Speaking to The Telegraph as he waited to board the last New Delhi-bound flight on Thursday, he added: The ICL didnt start with the idea of fighting with the Board However, Im the type that if you push me against the wall, Im definitely going to fight back. 

Despite the respect bit, its an all-out war now. 

Kapil, who is a brand ambassador for Birla Sun Life Insurance, was in the city for a few hours on a promotional visit. 

Elaborating on the Bindra issue, he said: The former Board president has told the world that hed spoken to me about the National Cricket Academys chairmanship, that I couldnt continue in that post Fact is, wed just met casually in the Delhi Golf Club bar! Is that the place to convey anything officially? 

Whatever, last month, the Board gave Kapil the boot and the Bangalore-located Academy is without a full-time head. 

Asked if he was satisfied with the progress made by the ICL, Kapil replied: Im happy, but lots remain to be done Today, my biggest concern is to look after the dozens of young cricketers whove come on board I cannot let them down. 

Kapil declined to comment (Im focusing on what we need to do) on the Boards plans to launch its own version of Twenty20 cricket with an international flavour. 

As for news that the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission had ordered an inquiry against the Board, Kapil played safe: Im not aware of the details, so Id rather not speak 

According to Kapil, he didnt get the time to meet the hugely supportive state sports minister, Subhas Chakraborty. 

Even Subhasbabu is such a busy person Actually, because hes a good friend, its not even necessary to have a face-to-face meeting Hum dono ki baat to hoti rehti hai Kaam chalta rehta hai 

Kapil added: Had I not been pressed for time, I wouldve gone and met Mr (Jagmohan) Dalmiya as well Had Sourav (Ganguly) been in the city, I wouldve gone and met him too Mera kisi se koi problem nahin hai. 

Theres always a next time.

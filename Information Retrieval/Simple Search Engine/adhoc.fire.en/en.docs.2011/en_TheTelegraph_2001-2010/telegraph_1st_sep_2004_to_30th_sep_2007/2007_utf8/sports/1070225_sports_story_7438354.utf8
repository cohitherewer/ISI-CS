 Denver: Tour de France champion Floyd Landis claims more mistakes were made in his doping case, this time involving technicians who handled his two positive urine samples.

 Landis attorneys say the cyclists positive doping tests could be invalidated because the same technicians were allowed to work on both samples. Lab rules prohibit technicians from participating in both tests to prevent them from validating their own findings.

 The lawyers want the technicians from the French lab to be questioned for his arbitration case against the US Anti-Doping Agency, scheduled for May 14.

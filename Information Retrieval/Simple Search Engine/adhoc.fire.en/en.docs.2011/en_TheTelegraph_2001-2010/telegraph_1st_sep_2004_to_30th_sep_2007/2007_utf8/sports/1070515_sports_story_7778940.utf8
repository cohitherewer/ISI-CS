 Hayden is relieved

Melbourne: Prolific opener Matthew Hayden is grateful to the Australian government for the decision to cancel the national teams Zimbabwe tour as he was contemplating pulling out of the series if it went ahead. 

The left-hander, who emerged top-scorer in the recent World Cup, said he had grave concerns about whether he should tour Zimbabwe. 

I was seriously considering my position this time, as to whether I would go if the tour went ahead, Hayden said. 

I considered not going last time (2004), but went in the end. This time I was considering it a lot more seriously. I think this time it could have been a case of once bitten, twice shy. I felt our safety was compromised a bit (in 2004), the whole tour became a farce, he was quoted as saying by an Australian newspaper. 

Vice-captain Adam Gilchrist also expressed relief at the governments decision. Im glad its not a decision we have to finally make, he said. 

The wicketkeeper-batsman, however, said he was open to the idea of playing at a neutral venue. 

If we can play them elsewhere if our government and administrators allow us to do that then Im very supportive of the idea, said the World Cup finals Man-of-the-Match. Their cricketers should not be affected by their regime. If we can accommodate them in any other way, I think that makes a great deal of sense, Gilchrist said. 

Ricky Ponting responded carefully to the idea, saying as captain of Australia, Ive never had a problem against cricketers from Zimbabwe.

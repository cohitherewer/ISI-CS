Pattaya: Fifth seed Sania Mirza went down fighting 6-4, 7-5 to sixth seed Gisela Dulko of Argentina in the semi-final of the $ 170,000 Pattaya Open on Saturday. In the final, Dulko will meet unseeded Austrian Sybille Bammer who defeated fourth seed Shuai Peng of China 6-4, 6-2. 

A 12-minute first game set the tone for the Sania-Dulko last-4 battle where there was little between the two baseline specialists. Dulko won the first set after breaking Sanias serve at 4-4 and returned everything the hard-hitting Indian threw at her. 

Sanias frustration began to show midway through the second set after she over-hit a series of forehand drives, before committing two double faults at 5-5 to allow the Argentine to break her serve and reach her second tour final. 

I knew it was going to be tough every game was close, Dulko told a news conference. I was very focused and I had to be there all the time, 100 per cent, because she hits the ball so hard. 

Bammer reached the first tour final of her 11-year professional career when she defeated Peng. Playing in only her second WTA semi-final, the 26-year-old Bammer took one hour 19 minutes to get past the tenacious Peng. (Agencies)

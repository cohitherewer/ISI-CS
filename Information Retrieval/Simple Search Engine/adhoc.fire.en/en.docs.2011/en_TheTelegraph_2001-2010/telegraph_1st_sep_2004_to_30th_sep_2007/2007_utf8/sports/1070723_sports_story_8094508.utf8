 London: Graham 

 Gooch, who has been helping promising cricketers with funds 

 from the 2002-instituted Graham Gooch Scholarship, now intends 

 sponsoring the Essex Cricket Academy, which is in Chelmsford. 

 Ive been happily doing 

 my bit towards returning something to cricket... Sponsoring 

 the Academy will be an extension of what Ive been 

 doing, Gooch told The Telegraph. 

A former England captain (mentor to the likes of Nasser Hussain) and one of the all-time great openers, Gooch added: The sponsorship could be in the region of 120,000 over a period of three or four years... 

The deal with the Essex County Cricket Club should be inked soon. Gooch is the Countys ambassador. 

Incidentally, Alastair Cook and Ravinder Bopara are among those whove benefited from Goochs Scholarship. The beneficiaries have, for example, been sent to Paul Terrys Academy in Perth (three months) and the World Cricket Academy-run camps at the CCI in Mumbai (a fortnight). 

This winter, right-handed opener Varun Chopra (whose roots are in India), will be one of the two heading for Perth. Hes a former England U-19 captain. The other youngster is right-handed middle-order batsman Tom Wesley. 

Gooch holds fund-raisers for the Scholarship and theyve been held at Lords and in Essex. Earlier this year, during the World Cup, he organised a fund-raising cruise in the Caribbean as well. 

The principal aim of the Scholarship is to ... Enhance and develop the cricket skills of young Essex professionals, Essex Academy-based players and potential England stars... 

Towards that end, the Scholarship even funded the purchase of E-cricket, a digital video analysis system, for use by the County. 

As a cricketer, Gooch was respected for his work ethic. More than a decade after he quit, hes also respected for initiatives such as the Scholarship. 

 If only more followed his path.

 Wadekar, Borde for Sehwag as opener

 World Cup 

Mumbai: Two former captains Ajit Wadekar and Chandu Borde on Friday advocated the inclusion of out-of-form batsman Virender Sehwag in the 15-member World Cup squad as the third opener besides Sourav Ganguly and Robin Uthappa. 

Sehwag needs to get back his confidence, but hes a contributor to the teams cause. Like Sachin Tendulkar, who showed (in Vadodara) what hes capable of after struggling a bit earlier, Sehwag too can murder the bowling. He should be picked for the upcoming Sri Lanka series. But I would not put him in the middle order as its already packed, Borde said. 

Looking at his past performances and prowess, especially in the shorter version of the game, Sehwag should be included and the upcoming one-day series against Sri Lanka is an ideal opportunity for him to get back among the runs, echoed Wadekar. 

According to Borde, emergence of young talents like Uthappa and Dinesh Karthik had given the side more utility players and reminded him of Kapils Devils of 1983. 

The 1983 team (led by Kapil Dev) had a lot of players of utility purpose who could bowl, bat and field. The present side too seems to be progressing in that fashion and I am impressed by the young talent which has come up, Borde maintained. (PTI)

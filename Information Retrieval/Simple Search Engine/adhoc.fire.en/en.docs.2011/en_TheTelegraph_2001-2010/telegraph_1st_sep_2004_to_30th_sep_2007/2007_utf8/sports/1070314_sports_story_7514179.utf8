 Adaptation is the key, says Plunkett 

Gros Islet: Liam Plunkett has been forced to change the way he bowls to get the best out of the West Indies wickets. 

The 21-year-old fast bowler is one of four seamers targeting two spots in Englands starting XI for their World Cup Group C opener against New Zealand on Friday, and knows it will take something special to get the selectors nod. 

You cant just run up these wickets and bowl your average seam up, Plunkett said Monday. You need to adapt to these wickets really early. 

If the ball stops after two overs, were probably going to have to get into the offcutters really early, so thats why practice over the last couple of days has been focused on that really. 

Plunkett put Englands five-wicket loss to Australia in the warm-up match last Friday to the fact the Aussie quicks superior use of slower balls, off-cutters and leg-cutters. 

It was a massive part of the game and I think thats what helped them win that game, Plunkett said.

 IOA backs Carvalho 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Indian Olympic Association (IOA) on Thursday came out in support of national coach Joaquim Carvalho saying that the Olympians achievements mostly go unnoticed in the country. 

Carvalho on Wednesday threatened to put four national team players on hunger strike in front of Karnataka chief ministers house to protest step-motherly treatment meted out to hockey players after their triumph in the Asia Cup. 

The IOA, currently at loggerheads with sports minister Mani Shankar Aiyar, has certainly found it the most appropriate moment to embarrass the government. 

In a press release signed jointly by IOA president Suresh Kalmadi and secretary Randhir Singh, the association said: At present, while the entire country celebrates the achievements of the Indian cricket team that won the Twenty20 World Cup, there is a strong feeling that the splendid achievements of Olympic sportspersons who bring glory to the nation are not given due recognition. 

We feel the success of all sportspersons who excel at the international level should be adequately appreciated and all sports persons, who toil for the prestige of the country, should be equally recognised and rewarded, the release added. 

We appeal to all sports lovers, corporate houses and state governments to be generous and equally acknowledge and reward the achievements of all Indian sportspersons, it said. 

The Indian Hockey Federation on Thursday received a promise of financial support from an unexpected quarter as Non Resident Indians of the US and Canada vowed to raise $1m to assist hockey players, add agencies.

 Im at ease with my game: Hall

Port of Spain: Allrounder Andrew Hall is happy to be South Africas man for a crisis. 

After all, after surviving getting shot at point-blank range during a robbery, the 31-year-old takes a game of cricket in his stride. 

Never was that calm-headed approach more needed than on Monday when he rode to rescue South Africa from potential embarrassment against Ireland when, coming in at No. 9 with his team 91 for eight, he hit an unbeaten 67. 

We back him 100 per cent, we back his ability especially in tight situations, said South Africa coach Mickey Arthur. The performance (against Ireland) proved how valuable he is to our squad. 

Im glad to make a contribution and I would like to continue the good cricket Ive been playing Im comfortable with my cricket at the moment, he said. 

Meanwhile, South Africa face Pakistan here in their final warm-up on Friday with Arthur hoping to see conditions at the Sir Frank Worrell ground a little quicker. 

It looked a good wicket (against Ireland). It might have done a bit more in the morning, but a really good wicket. (AFP)

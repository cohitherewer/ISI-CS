 Greg: Not relying on individuals 

Montego Bay: Team India coach Greg Chappell has said the team will rely less on a players star value in their bid to win the World Cup. 

We will not be relying on any special players because the team is fairly well balanced, the former Australian captain said. 

The players had their first practice session on Saturday. 

Sachin Tendulkar might have to cope with a new role in batting and the extra responsibility of being the vice-captain, but Indias star batsman said he felt no pressure and was keen to contribute with both bat and ball. 

I am hoping that both my batting and bowling will come good. I am not under any pressure. I feel quite confident, Tendulkar said at the Indian teams first press conference in the Caribbean. 

Tendulkar is the all-time leading run-getter in one-day cricket with 14,783 runs, and having played in 381 one-dayers since his debut in 1989, will be the most experienced cricketer at the event that begins on March 13. 

Captain Rahul Dravid said he was confident of a strong show by his team in the tournament. 

I know that all the other teams are ready to play their best cricket but we are very confident that will be a very good tournament for us, he said. 

Dravids confidence stems from the fact that India have a strong, balanced side combined with youth and experience. He stressed on this aspect on the eve of the teams departure in Mumbai. 

Besides, strong batting, the variation in bowling gives Dravid more options. He insisted there was no fitness problems in the side. 

The home series wins over the West Indies and Sri Lankans have given the Indians hope after the reversals in South Africa, and they are not willing to look back. 

The familiarity with the conditions in the West Indies, having toured there last year, also puts the Indians in good stead. 

The opening ceremony of the event is slated for March 11. India, placed in group B, are scheduled to play their opening match on March 17 against Bangladesh in Port of Spain. Sri Lanka and Bermuda are the two teams in the group.

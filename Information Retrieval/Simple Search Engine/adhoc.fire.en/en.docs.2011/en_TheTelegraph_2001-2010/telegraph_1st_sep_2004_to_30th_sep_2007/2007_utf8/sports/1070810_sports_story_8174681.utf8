 Giles forced to retire at 34

England spinner Ashley Giles has decided to retire from cricket with immediate effect because of persistent hip problems. The 34-year-old Giles, who played a key role in Englands 2005 Ashes success, made the decision after consulting his hip surgeon. Giles claimed 143 wickets in 54 Tests and hit a brilliant 59, his highest score for England, as he shared in a crucial 109-run eighth-wicket stand with Kevin Pietersen to help secure the Ashes at the Oval two years ago. 

Giles said: Following guidance from my hip surgeon, Dr Marc Philippon, I am very sorry to announce that I am retiring from all forms of cricket with immediate effect. I had hoped to make a full recovery and return to playing over the next few months but the advice I have received means that there is no chance of me returning to cricket at any level. 

It has been a huge honour to play for my country and to play a part in one of the most successful periods in its cricketing history. I dreamt of playing cricket for England and winning the Ashes as a child and so to be part of that magical summer of 2005 was truly a dream realised. 

The hip problems recovered sufficiently for Giles to be selected for the opening two Tests of last winters Ashes series ahead of Monty Panesar. But after returning home early from Australia for family reasons, he broke down again and has had three operations in the last 18 months. 

England captain Michael Vaughan said: Ashleys retirement is very sad news and everyone in the England dressing room will miss his professionalism and, of course, his sense of humour. 

In my view, Ashley has to be one of the most underrated cricketers ever to pull on an England shirt. He was a key member of the England Test side and I know how much his teammates valued his contributions.

New Delhi: Less than two years ago, Mateus Versolato Junior came down to Yokohama to play the final of the World Club Cup championships against Liverpool, but beyond that he knows little about football in the Asian continent. 

The lanky goalkeeper, who has arrived in the capital on Wednesday morning with the 20-member Sao Paulo squad from Brazil to play the five-match Super Soccer series, made no secret of his lack of knowledge about Indian football. 

All I know that we are meeting a club named Mohun Bagan in one of the matches. They could be our strongest opponents in India. This is a piece of information I received before leaving for India. 

Mateus, however, was the most sought-after footballer when Sao Paulo had a more than one hour training session at the Ambedkar Stadium on Wednesday evening. Having done duty for the club in the World Club Cup final in 2005 he has become a recognisable face for those who follow the game on the telly. And then, Mateus is an understudy of Rogerio Ceni, who, according to Fifa, has scored maximum number of goals as a goalkeeper. 

Talking about Ceni, Mateus said his senior had been a great inspiration for him throughout his career. Forget about his ability to score goals from free-kicks. You should watch the way he practises to hone his skills. For hours, he would keep on practising. Naturally, he is our best bet when it comes to taking free-kicks. 

The team coach, Antonio Carlos Silva said he was happy that he could take the Brazil champions to India to play some really exciting matches. 

We may not have brought our best team, but these young boys are capable of playing good football. We are one of worlds best clubs. We not only win tournaments, but also take pride in producing future stars, said the coach of the four-time Brazil champions. 

Among the 20 players, there are only six who have donned the colours of the team when Sao Paulo won the Brazilian national championships this season. A few of them, like midfielder Marco Antanio and striker Roger da Silva have done exceedingly well in the domestic tournaments and are expected to show their magic in the opener against East Bengal in Siliguri on January 27. 

The rest of the team comprises junior members of the Sao Paulo coaching scheme.

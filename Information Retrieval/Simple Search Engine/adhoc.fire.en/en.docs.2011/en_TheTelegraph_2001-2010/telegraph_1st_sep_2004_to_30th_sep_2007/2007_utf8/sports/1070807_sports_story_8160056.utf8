 Charlton pat for EB colts

Manchester: East Bengals under-15 team finished 18th in a 20-team event. However, the team returned from the Nike Manchester United Premier Cup (MUPC) not without a word of praise from English legend Sir Bobby Charlton. 

Charlton pointed out that East Bengal had done better than Mohun Bagans last place finish in 2006 and patted the boys for their grit. 

This team from India did better than the team we saw last year. I know short stature and frail physique are major handicaps for them but it was still good to see them come and compete at this level and actually do better, the English legend said. 

I saw a few matches, including one featuring this Indian side. They had certain handicaps but what struck me was their stomach for fight, which was astounding. It was really impressive to see how eager they were for a fight, Charlton said. 

In his speech, Charlton advised the youngsters to go back and practise hard to master whatever they learnt during the premier under-15 tournaments. 

You have learnt different defensive and attacking strategies, different drills. Now go home and practise them. No player ever reached the top without practising hard. Pele, Maradona, Beckenbauer they all became great because they practised. Ill very satisfied if I see some of the players who are present here making it big some day, Charlton said. (PTI)

 Nadal overcomes pain, Jones

On the eve of the US Open, Rafael Nadal was preparing to take the next flight home to Spain. His left knee was so painful after practising on Sunday, it was impossible, according to his uncle and coach, Toni Nadal, for him to play. 

Two days of rest and treatment later, Nadal the worlds No. 2-ranked player found himself battling on Arthur Ashe Stadium Court against the unseeded and little known Alun Jones, a 27-year-old from Australia making his Open debut. 

Jones once dug holes for his fathers dam construction project while temporarily retired from tennis three years ago, having earned more recognition in the sport for his bit part in the movie Wimbledon. Until Wednesday. 

Jones had broken Nadal for a 4-3 lead in the third set, moving two games away from a two-sets-to-one lead. 

But Nadal called for the trainer, had the tape on his left knee replaced, and quietly gritted out a first-round victory 7-5, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 that cast a shadow on his remaining Open path. 

Maybe if I was in another tournament, I would not have gone to the court today, Nadal said. 

But the US Open is a very big tournament for me. Two days ago I was much worse. Today I didnt move much but I played, so thats good news. 

Nadal who has tendinitis and inflammation in his left knee compounded the tendinitis in his right knee that he dealt with during his epic five-set loss to Roger Federer at Wimbledon. 

But at least that was on a more forgiving grass surface. On the pounding hardcourts, a surface he is still trying to conquer when healthy, the injury adds yet another obstacle. Sure, is difficult to play like this, especially here, no? he said. 

Nadal said he had a magnetic resonance imaging exam on Tuesday that did not show the injury to be a big problem. And even though he said he first felt the tendinitis four years ago, at age 17, he again insisted it was not an important injury.

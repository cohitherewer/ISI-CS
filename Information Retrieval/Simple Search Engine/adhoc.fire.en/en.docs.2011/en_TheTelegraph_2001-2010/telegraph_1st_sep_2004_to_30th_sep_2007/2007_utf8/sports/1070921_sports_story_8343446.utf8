 Pak through to last four

Cape Town: Shahid Afridi blasted 39 from 15 balls to smooth Pakistans way to a comfortable four-wicket victory against Bangladesh in their final ICC World Twenty20 group F match at Newlands on Thursday. 

Australias earlier 10-wicket victory over Sri Lanka ensured Pakistan had already qualified for Saturdays semi-finals while Bangladesh were eliminated following two opening Super Eight defeats. 

Debutant Junaid Siddique smashed a quickfire 71 from 49 balls in a Man of the Match performance to lift Bangladesh to a respectable total of 140 but Afridis composed innings allowed Pakistan to cruise to victory with an over to spare. 

Siddique struck six fours and three sixes but none of his teammates were able to reach 20 against Pakistans bowlers, with off spinners Mohammed Hafeez and captain Shoaib Malik leading the way with figures of two for 27 and two for 15.

Ipoh: A 50th minute goal by Edward Ockenden carried Australia to a 1-0 win against India in their opening group A match of the eight-nation 16th Sultan Azlan Shah Cup mens hockey tournament here on Saturday. 

Australia, pushed on the defensive in the first-half, showcased their bench strength after crossing-over with Ockenden, playing in only his ninth international, getting a deflection to a Robert Hammond pass. 

Playing without seven of their World Cup stars, the Aussies nevertheless underlined the depth in talent to emerge winners. But then, it was a match that India gifted to the 2006 World Cup runners-up, wasting at least half-a-dozen clear scoring chances. 

Shivendra Singh, one of the better players in Indias doomed World Cup campaign last year, repeatedly fumbled in front of the rival goal while Prabhjot Singh, Rajpal Singh and Tushar Khandkar were as guilty in blowing away scoring opportunities. 

India played a pleasing game in the first-half as they contained the Australians with tight midfield marking. Even granting that the Aussies appeared listless, struggling to put together an effective move, the Indians still looked decidedly superior side. 

In fact, the Indians began the proceedings on an aggressive note and twice came close to scoring the opening eight minutes. The Aussies continued to press hard and struck in the 50th minute when Ockenden got a touch to Robert Hammonds free-hit. The Indian deep defence, for once, was caught flat-footed. 

Pakistan, meanwhile, rebounded from a one-goal deficit to force a 2-2 draw with Malaysia in a group B match. 

In an exciting match marked by physical play, Malaysia led twice on goals by Zulkifi Rejab (sixth) and Ismail Abu (29th). But the Pakistanis kept their nerves and banked on their experience and superior collective talent to stay in the match as Ehsan Ullah (13th) and Imran Warsi (42nd) scored. 

Also Asian Games champions South Korea struggled to a 1-0 win against Canada in group B. The Korean match-winner came in the 44th minute when Jeong Yun Sang converted a penalty corner.

 BCCI: No talk of dropping seniors

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Wednesday made it clear that there has been no talk about dropping some of the senior players for the tour of Bangladesh. 

This is rubbish, said BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla when asked whether Sachin Tendulkar or Sourav Ganguly would be ignored for selection for the Bangladesh tour. 

How can you predict the team when the selectors are yet to meet? We cannot say who should be there in the team. It is up to the selectors to pick the right team for the Bangladesh tour, Shukla said on the sidelines of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) meeting. 

The board official felt that one should know the facts before taking a stand on this issue. 

So much has been written in the media in the past few weeks that it is difficult to know what the exact truth is, Shukla said. We have sought an explanation from the two players whether they have really said so. Lets see what happens. 

Clearing the board stand on the issue of endorsement, Shukla hinted that the parent body would be much softer on the players after its initial outburst. 

A final decision on the number of endorsements a player would be allowed to will only be taken after talking to the cricketers. 

After all, these players are part of our large BCCI family. We will not put anyone in trouble like that. 

Shukla, however, pointed out that a large section of the BCCI is convinced that too many endorsements by players are affecting their performances. 

Some of the former captains also said the same in the Mumbai meeting. Thats why decided to put a cap on that. We only want to ensure that cricketers dont overdo such things. 

The BCCI vice-president was quite upset when it was pointed out that there has been allegation of involvement of players agents behind the selection of some cricketers. 

This is total rubbish, he fumed. The selectors are doing an honest job and agents are nowhere near it.

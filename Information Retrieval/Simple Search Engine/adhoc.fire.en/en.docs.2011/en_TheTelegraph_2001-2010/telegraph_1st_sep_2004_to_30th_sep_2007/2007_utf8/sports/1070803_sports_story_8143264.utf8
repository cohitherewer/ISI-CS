The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India may host next meet, too

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Commonwealth Volleyball Confederation (CVC) is contemplating awarding India the next edition of the meet, though the dates are yet to be decided. 

Impressed with the successful organisation of the meet, chairman of CVC control committee (Oceania Zone), Allan Brodie said: We are very happy with the way things have progressed here. We plan to bring it back again here the next time. 

For the record the second edition of the meet hosted by India is held after a gap of 26 years. London hosted the inaugural edition. 

Asked what kind of participation he expected in the next tournaments, Bordie said, I would like to include 10 top teams from America, Latin America, Oceania, Asia and Africa.

 Diabetic? Not when victory is sweet

ANANYA SENGUPTA

Mumbai: The first thing that 20-year-old Rohit Sharma asked his coach Dinesh Lad moments after India lifted the ICC World Twenty20 trophy in Johannesburg on Monday was: How did I do? 

Very well indeed, according to Lad. 

Rohit, who contributed an unbeaten 30 in the final against Pakistan, comes from a middle-class background and almost didnt make it to the cricket pitch. 

He was 11 when I first saw him. He bowled off-spin. He was a very humble boy, and kept a low profile. I wanted him to join the school in which I was a coach but his parents said they couldnt afford the fees. But I was determined to coach him, he was that good. 

I requested the director of Swami Vivekanand School to give the boy a chance, and he did. I am happy I made the effort, for he has made me the proudest man alive, says Lad. 

Even more proud are Rohits parents. 

When his father Gurunath lost his job in a transport company, the responsibility of the entire family fell on Rohits young shoulders. 

But his father also wanted him to complete his studies. I always tell Rohit that it is important to finish his graduation. He is doing his first year B.Com from Rizvi College. He isnt too interested in studies he would rather play cricket all day in the streets! 

Rohits mother Poornima, who is a diabetic, said she was nervous every time India played, so much so that she forgot to take her medicines. After Indias win on Monday, she threw caution to the wind and celebrated by gorging on ladoos and dancing till her feet were sore. 

She has been crying Ye toh khushi ke aansoon hain (these are tears of joy). Soon she will be busy preparing for her sons return, says Gurunath. 

The team returns on Wednesday and will go on a victory march from the Mumbai airport to Wankhede Stadium. 

The Sharmas, though, will be at the Wankhede to take part in celebrations that have been planned by the BCCI. 

And the one thing thats sure to be waiting for Rohit when he gets back home will be his favourite kanda-poha (onion with rice flakes). 

He just cannot do without his mothers poha. Thats the last thing he has before he leaves for a tour, and the first thing he wants when he gets back! says Gurunath.

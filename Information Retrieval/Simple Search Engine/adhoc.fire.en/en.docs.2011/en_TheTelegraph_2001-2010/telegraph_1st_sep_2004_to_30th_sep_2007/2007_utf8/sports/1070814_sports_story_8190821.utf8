Tulsa: There was a different texture to this five-mile walk, an appearance of tension and conflict in Tiger Woodss midst as he stepped into the furnace of Southern Hills Country Club on a broiling Sunday on the Plains. 

As an old foe and a hot-tempered journeyman prodded at his perch, Woods pushed back during the 89th PGA Championship, throwing a roundhouse punch into the air after an early birdie as he tried to navigate toward another milepost. 

After he made par on the last hole and thrust his arms in victory, the 31-year-old Woods walked into the scorers room to sign his scorecard and found his wife, Elin, and daughter, Sam Alexis, waiting. 

The baby, born in June, was dressed in red, just as her father was. Woods said that was when he felt the goose bumps. To have her here brings chills to me, even now, Woods said. 

With a one-under-par 69 in the final round with two dogged competitors in pursuit, Woods snared a two-shot victory over Tour journeyman Woody Austin to claim his first major championship of the season and the 13th of his career. Austin shot a 67 and Ernie Els, a three-time major winner, shot a 66 to finish three shots back. 

With an eight-under-par 272 total, Woods won his fourth PGA Championship and claimed at least one major title for the third year in a row. He also improved to 13-0 when holding at least a share of the lead after 54 holes in a major. 

Although he won four PGA Tour events earlier in the year, Woods had said on Saturday night that his year in golf could only be great if he won a major title. 

He is now five behind Jack Nicklauss record of 18 majors. Nicklaus did not win his 13th until his 53rd professional start in a major. Woods captured his 13th title in his 44th major as a pro. 

I could not ask for a better start to my career, said Woods, who now has 59 PGA Tour victories. If you would have told me that 12 years into my career I would have had this many wins and this many majors, theres no way. Ive exceeded my own expectations. 

After runner-up finishes at the Masters and the US Open and a tie for 12th at the British Open, Woods was able to manoeuvre his golf ball through the doglegs and tall trees of Southern Hills on a 102-degree day to win back-to-back PGA Championships for the second time. He also won in 1999 and 2000. 

With a three-shot lead over Stephen Ames (76) heading into the final round, Woods bogeyed No. 2 after driving into the left rough, but he quickly recovered with birdies at No. 4 and No. 7. 

When Els rolled in a short birdie putt on No. 14 and Austin made his third straight birdie on 13, Woodss lead had been trimmed to two shots. 

After Woods made bogey on the par-3 14th with a three-putt from 35 feet, his lead was down to a single stroke. 

With Els and Austin closing in, Woods unfurled his final flourish on No. 15, knocking an iron shot to 15 feet after berating himself for his bogey on the previous hole. After hitting his putt, Woods watched as it tumbled into the hole. He clenched his right fist, then pointed at the cup in a scene that has become familiar. 

So, too, was his walk up the 18th fairway, as Woods doffed his cap and slapped hands with his caddie, Steve Williams. About the only thing different was Woodss feeling about winning major titles, a view that became clear as he walked into the scorers shed and embraced his family.

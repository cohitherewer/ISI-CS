 Simone: Its all over with Warne 

Sydney: The wife of former Australian cricketer Shane Warne says their marriage reconciliation is over after he mistakenly sent her an incriminating text message. 

Simone Callahan, who reunited last December with the spin bowler known also for his womanising, told a womans magazine she caught Warne cheating on her while he was in London. 

As Callahan got the couples three children ready for school in Melbourne, a text dropped into the inbox of her mobile phone, she told a magazine. 

Hey beautiful, Im just talking to my kids, the back doors open, the message from Warne said. You loser, you sent the message to the wrong person, Callahan sent back. 

For her to know her way to the back door means shes been there before so this has obviously been going on for some time, Callahan said. 

She told the magazine the message confirmed her suspicions that Warne was again cheating on her and that his lover had been to their London home before. 

He confirmed there was someone else and told me he was sorry. I gave it to him big time I left him in no doubt as to what I think of him and that was it.

 Double blow for Bengal

 - NATIONAL GAMES FOOTBALL

 Guwahati: The mens football event in the National Games will witness a new winner. 

With Bengal, the runners-up in the Hyderabad edition, following defending champions Punjab this afternoon, the stage is set for a new champion in the event. 

It was a double blow for Bengal as they were ousted by Manipur 0-2 in womens event as well. 

In the mens category, hosts Assam made the most of home advantage and beat an apparently clueless Bengal side to reach the final, pumping in three goals in the second half to register an emphatic victory. 

Mrinal Boro more than made up for the off-colour and jaded Sanjiba Rongpi, scoring a brace in the 55th and 73rd minutes. Substitute Birjab Mushahary took the issue beyond any doubt, heading Assam to a 3-0 lead during injury time. 

After some disoriented football in the first half, Assam stepped up the ante after taking the lead and maintained that till the end. 

Bengal coach Biswajit Bhattacharya was, however, happy with the show. With four or five days of practice, my boys played well. Assam are a good team and were well prepared, Bhattacharya said. 

Bengal will now play for the third place against the losers of the match between Meghalaya and Tamil Nadu. 

The womens section saw defending champions Manipur set up a summit clash with Orissa on Saturday. 

Manipurs goals were scored in the 7th and 81st minutes through Bem Devi and Mani Tombi. In the other semi-final between Orissa and Goa, the former won by a solitary goal scored in the 32nd minute to move into the final. Sarita Behera scored the goal.

Johannesburg: The morning after they lifted the inaugural ICC World Twenty20, skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni told his ecstatic teammates that they should not get carried away by success. 

Sab kuch normal rakhne ka (keep everything normal), said Dhoni as they savoured their World Cup triumph over Pakistan. Just live in the present, keep your feet on the ground, enjoy your success but dont get carried away by success, he said on Tuesday. 

Attributing their victory to teamwork, Dhoni said: Whatever is destined to happen will happen. But I believe, unless your do the required hard work you dont achieve it. 

In this competition, we played a few games that went down to the wire. But everyone who has done well in those crunch games, when it mattered, will relish his performance for the team cause, Dhoni said. Its not just my own destiny, it was the destiny of the whole team. 

We had the determination and will to do well because we didnt do well in the last World Cup. Besides, we enjoyed this format of the game. And since no one expected us to do well, there was no pressure. The team showed the right attitude and gave more than 100 per cent, the wicketkeeper-batsman said. 

We enjoyed our cricket and we enjoyed each others performance. If I get a fifty, I am bound to enjoy it. But if my knock can get a smile on the faces of other players in the side, it means a lot. Thats what the team wants and thats what my team did, Dhoni said. 

It was a great team effort. Theres no batsmen or bowler who hasnt done well in the tournament. And the fielding was top class. Yuvi was brilliant, RP too bowled brilliantly, Harbhajan too bowled well, everybody was great. Whoever was given the responsibility did it to the best of his ability to the needs of the side, the skipper said. 

Asked to compare his teams triumph to Indias World Cup victory in 1983, Dhoni said he would rather live in the present. 

I was just two years old when India won the World Cup in 1983, so, obviously, I didnt see it and I have no idea how big cricket was then. 

But as I said before, I live in the present and I think my team and my support staff was very involved and very focused, he said. 

We landed here after travelling for two-and-a-half months in Ireland and England, so it wasnt easy. But the way the things were planned, it worked well for us. We always felt fresh because we didnt get carried away by practising too hard before big games, Dhoni said. So its not fair to compare. Our victory in 1983 was very special and so was this triumph. 

Asked whether he ever thought that India could lose the game after Misbah-ul Haq turned on the heat hitting those towering sixes, Dhoni said he was backing himself to get a wicket. We knew they didnt have too many wickets in hand. We knew if we could pick up a wicket or two things would change pretty quickly. In pressure games, on the big stage, how you handle pressure is very important. 

I was backing myself on the fact that, as the overs go by, and the asking rate gets tougher, our chances would get better, the Jharkhand cricketer said. Harbhajan, despite being hit for three sixes, bowled well. Joginder bowled an excellent over under pressure in a crunch situation. 

The Indian captain also praised Rohit Sharmas effort in making those 30 crucial runs in the final overs that gave his team something to bowl at. 

His runs were very important. It added to the total and that added to the confidence and to the morale. We were looking to get 140 and we got 157. Rohit really batted well in the chances he got in this tournament. 

The captain attributed Indias slow progress in the last 10 overs to some excellent bowling by Pakistan pacers. Pakistan bowled well, and their bowlers were up to the mark. In the last 10 overs they bowled lot of yorkers and that worked well for them. 

Dhoni also acknowledged that his team was mentally strong on the big stage as compared to the opposition.

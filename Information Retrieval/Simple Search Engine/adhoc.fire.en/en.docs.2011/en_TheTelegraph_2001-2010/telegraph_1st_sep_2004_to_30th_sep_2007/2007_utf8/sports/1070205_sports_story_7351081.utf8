The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Better horse won on the day: MAM 

 HONKY DORY

 Mumbai: The Derby favourite, Southern Empire, stood a better chance of winning had Bangalore been closer to Mumbai. Originally, Secret Memory was supposed to make the trip to the western metropolis after the horse won the Bangalore Derby on January 26. However, MAM Ramaswamy changed the plan following Diabolicals victory in the Golconda Derby in Hyderabad. The journey time from Hyderabad was nearly eight hours less compared to a trip from Bangalore, said Ramaswamy.

 Another reason that necessitated Diabolical to travel to Mumbai was his breeder Shapoor Mistrys insistence that either of his two Derby winners make the Indian Derby line-up. Secret Memory, the winner of the Pune Derby last season, is also bred by Mistry. My horses do better after a long journey from Hyderabad, joked Mistry after the race. It is irony of fate that Secret Memory lost the Deccan Derby in Hyderabad but won the Pune edition, while the stables Real Excellence was favourite.

 Nevertheless, Ramaswamy was all praise for Diabolicals efforts and the Derby victory. A Derby win is a always special, be it a favourite or a rank outsider like Diabolical, he said and added, Both horses tried their hardest and the better horse on the day won.

 However, for trainer S.Ganapathy the Mumbai mission has been accomplished and the next target is Calcutta. Southern Empire is a good horse. Dont write him off. He is capable of turning the table, he warned before signing off.

 Vijay Mallya, the UB Group supremo the sponsor of the Derby gave away the prizes. He said: The effort that started two decade ago is paying off. We wanted to add a lot of glamour to the Derby. Todays big crowd has proved our point.

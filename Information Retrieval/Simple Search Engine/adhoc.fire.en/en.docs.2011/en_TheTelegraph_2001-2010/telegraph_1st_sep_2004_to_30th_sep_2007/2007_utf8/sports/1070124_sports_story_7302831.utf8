Cuttack: Sachin Tendulkar dropped Chris Gayle, who went on to smash a 46-ball 52 in Nagpur. Then Sreesanth dropped Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who remained undefeated on 149 and came close to snatching the first ODI from Indias grasp. 

The 14-run win on Sunday may have overshadowed the fielding loopholes, but it was time for some serious introspection and scrutiny on the eve of the second ODI. 

Rahul Dravid faced the inevitable question: Was fielding a concern despite the Nagpur win? We are working very hard on it Giving extra effort. 

He admitted seniors are not great natural athletes. We got to accept it. 

He said further: When we picked youngsters, critics said that we were overlooking experienced players. Now that we have experienced players in the side, everybody is complaining about fielding There will obviously be plusses and minuses everywhere We have to accept that and strike a balance. We should know how to deal with it. 

He did, however, add that all the seniors were trying to be good if not brilliant. 

Talking about the opponents, Dravid once again praised Shivnarine Chanderpaul. Obviously we will have some specific strategy for Chanderpaul. He, Lara and Gayle are the pillars of the West Indies batting. 

The final question was a tricky one: Is Sourav Gangulys running between wickets a worry? Theres a chance for improvement in all the departments bowling, batting, fielding, catching and not just the running between wickets.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bangladesh bowled out for 62 

Colombo: Opening batsman Malinda Warnapura and Kumar Sangakkara hit half-centuries Tuesday and backed up a splendid Sri Lankan bowling display to extend their lead over visiting Bangladesh in the second Test. 

Warnapura on 79 with Sangakkara 51, combined for an unbeaten 113-run partnership for the second wicket to take Sri Lanka to 154 for one at stumps on the first day at Colombos P. Saravanamuttu Stadium. The total gave Sri Lanka a 92-run first innings lead with nine wickets in hand. 

Michael Vandort scored 14 before being bowled out by seamer Mashrafe Mortaza when the total stood at 41. 

Earlier, Bangladesh crumbled to their lowest Test total ever 62 all out in just 25.2 overs, facing the assault of pace bowler Lasith Malinga and offspinner Muttiah Muralidharan who snared four wickets apiece after the host captain Mahela Jayawardene won the toss and invited Bangladesh to bat first. 

Rajin Saleh was the only Bangladeshi batsman to reach double figures, scoring just 21 runs. The visitors are already one down in the series after their ignominious innings and 234-run defeat by Sri Lanka within four days in the first Test last week. 

The slide began immediately, with Malingas pace proving too much for the Bangladeshis. The top order perished without a fight. Malinga had opener Shahriar Nafees plumb in front in his first over without scoring. 

He bowled a nagging line and with the score on 14 he got his second wicket when Javed Omar was caught behind by for eight. The 23-year-old bowler struck twice in the 10th over removing Habibul Bashar for five and Mohammed Ashraful without scoring within three deliveries. 

Malingas first spell of seven overs fetched four wickets for 14 runs. 

Muralidharan and Dilhara Fernando (2/16) further tormented the visitors.

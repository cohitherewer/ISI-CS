 Stop player-agent nexus: Ex-chiefs 

Chennai: Three former BCCI presidents on Tuesday claimed that the player-agent nexus regarding endorsements was ruining Indian cricket and called for stern measures to check the menace in the wake of the World Cup debacle. 

The former presidents said that the captain should be left out of the selection process to ensure personal endorsements do not affect the teams performance. 

Speaking on condition of anonymity, one of the former Board chiefs said that the players agents have a negative influence on the selection process by way of leveraging their hold on the captain or senior players. 

During my tenure as president, only one or two players were involved in commercials, that too on a much smaller scale. Even then, I had information that the players agents were instrumental in undeserving cricketers getting picked for tours, he said. 

Clarifying the typical modus operandi of an agent, the former BCCI chief said, he charges 30 per cent commission on total contract. He enrols a senior player who has a say in selection, and then ropes in other players (for advertisement). The agent shares his 30 per cent with the concerned senior player in exchange for the inclusion of other players named by him in the squad. 

He also suggested that the captain should be allowed only to place his views about team requirements and not be made a part of the discussion in the selection committee meeting. 

If these allegations, what I have heard, are true, the captain should put forward his suggestions on inclusion of players, but he should not be allowed to sit through the meeting, he said. 

Another former BCCI president said that the World Cup debacle has provided the right opportunity for the Board to take a bold step. 

It is a god given opportunity for the Board to stop this (player-agent nexus) menace. The BCCI should ban advertisements and endorsement contracts of players who are generally under the clutches of their agents, he said. 

The third ex-president also agreed. 

In every method there are certain grey areas and those have to be eradicated. It has always happened and this is the right time for the Board to crack the whip on the non-performing players, he said. 

The players should obtain permission and in fact, share a percentage with the BCCI. This is prevalent in Australia and some other countries, one of them said. 

The Board is entitled to get a percentage because it is giving them the forum to play and thereby make a fortune, he added. 

According to the ex-BCCI chiefs, the senior players formed a committee for dialogue with the BCCI on players contracts and they agreed to pay a percentage to the Board from their advertisements and endorsements. 

Anil Kumble drafted the agreement on behalf of players and it was to be signed by the Board but afterwards there was no information on it, one of them said.

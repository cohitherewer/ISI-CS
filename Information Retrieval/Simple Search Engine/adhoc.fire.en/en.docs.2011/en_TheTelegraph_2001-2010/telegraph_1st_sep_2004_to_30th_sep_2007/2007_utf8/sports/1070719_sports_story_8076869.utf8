The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Treasurers post may be contested too

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: CAB president Prasun Mukherjees meeting with the affiliated units on Wednesday was nothing but an assessment of the vote bank ahead of the annual general meeting on July 28. 

The informal meeting was called to find a consensus candidate for the second joint secretarys post. Samar Pal is one of the candidates for the post. Everyone reposed faith in me and I will decide on the panel in a couple of days, said Mukherjee. 

However, according to CAB sources, Amitava Banerjee is all set to be the presidents choice for the second joint secretarys post. 

Tushar Sarkar will be the Mukherjee camps choice for the treasurers post though few of his associates wanted incumbent Shiv Kumar Kalyani to complete his term. 

Kalyani is likely to contest as part of the Jagmohan Dalmiya-backed panel. 

Incumbent Saradindu Pal will also contest as part of the Dalmiya-backed panel along with Biswarup Dey for the joint secretaries posts. 

LIKELY PANELS 

Prasun Mukherjee-backed: Samar Paul and Amitava Banerjee (joint secretaries); Tushar Sarkar (treasurer); Indranath Dey (vice-president); 

Jagmohan Dalmiya-backed: Biswarup Dey and Saradindu Pal (joint secretaries); Shiv Kumar Kalyani (treasurer).

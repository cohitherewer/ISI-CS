Bangalore: Mahendra Singh Dhoni came in for rich praise on Tuesday from Rahul Dravid, who felt India deserved to win the ICC World Twenty20 because of their amazing consistency. 

Congratulation to Dhoni and his team. They played fantastic cricket throughout and certainly deserved to win the tournament, Dravid said. 

The former captain said, in every match they got one or two scintillating performance and that contributed to the success. Those were critical performances. 

It was a total team effort all along. I think the support staff also deserve a pat for their efforts. It was great fun watching the tournament and the way they played, Dravid said. 

Batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar said Indian cricket is now in safe hands. It was a brilliant team effort and along with the players, the entire nation is celebrating. Dhoni led the team to a fabulous victory and I can say that Indian cricket is in safe hands, he said. 

Sourav also heaped praise on Dhoni and said India had found an able leader in the star Jharkhand player. Dhoni is special. We needed a leader like Dhoni. It was a fantastic win and the team needed this kind of performance. The temperament the boys have shown under pressure is outstanding.

 Can Churchy do it for Punter?

 Adam Gilchrist 

Bridgetown: Come April 28, Punter will fancy his chances of having his hands on the World Cup. But Virgil also harbours similar ambitions. 

In the colourful world of one-day cricket, players nicknames are about as mystifying as a Muralidharan doosra. 

Punter is Australia captain Ricky Ponting, a name earned due to his liking for a flutter, while England captain Michael Vaughan is Virgil, not as a result of any epic performances, but because of a reputed likeness to a character from the thunderbirds childrens show. 

A lot of mind-power has gone into some nicknames, said Australia wicket-keeper and vice-captain Adam Gilchrist. 

Glenn McGraths nickname, Pigeon, came courtesy of his New South Wales teammates early on in his career, when he was a skinny country lad. 

They felt that somewhere in the world there was a pigeon flying non-stop, as he could not land while McGrath used the birds legs as his own. 

McGrath has also been dubbed Millard, in honour of a brand of caravan in which he first lived when he first moved to Sydney. 

Gilchrist said he has picked up the name of Churchy. 

A young autograph hunter once approached me and said: Excuse me Eric Gilchurch, can I have your autograph? 

However, the Australian team is most proud of fast bowler Brett Lee, sadly injured and not involved in the World Cup. Amongst his many nicknames is Oswald. 

Apparently at the start of one game, the batting order was being read aloud, comprising Lee behind brother Shane and allrounder Ian Harvey. 

Former captain Steve Waugh announced the names Lee, Harvey And Oswald came out of the dressing room. 

Matthew Hayden, with his dedication to physical fitness, is known as Hulk and Unit. 

Michael Clarke has always been referred to as Pup for his youthful looks on debut in 2003 as a raw 22-year-old. 

Being called Pup is fine, said the in-form Clarke. But they dont look at me like that any more. 

Elsewhere in the Australia squad, Brad Hodge is Dodgeball while Brad Hogg is the Postman, in reference to his former job. 

As well as Vaughans Virgil, the England team have Ian Bell who has been called Boyband as well as the Shermanator by tormentor Shane Warne, after the geeky character in the film American Pie. 

Andrew Flintoff has been Superfred, Mr Infredible, but more recently Fredalo, after his now-infamous late night trip in a pedalo in the early stages of the World Cup. 

Monty Panesar is Parmesan Tony, an anagram of his own name. 

Among the New Zealanders, batsman Peter Fulton is called two-metre Peter. At 6ft 8in, Fulton is believed to be one of the tallest-ever players. 

Curiously, all the Bangladesh players are known by their nicknames, not just to teammates but also fans and the media. 

Former captain Khaled Mashud was known as Pilot; current opening batsman Javed Omer is Gullu. 

Bangladesh nicknames are usually thought up by parents. 

Calling others names can backfire, however, as Flintoff discovered when he inadvertently riled Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar. 

Freddie Flintoff made a comment. He was talking about my physique. He said: he may be Tarzan but he cannot bowl, Shoaib recalled. 

All I say is: thanks for keeping me focused. It made me realise that something needed to be done, that I definitely had a point to prove. 

Shoaib took 17 wickets in three Tests as Pakistan beat England 2-0 in 2005.

 Singapore gets 5-year GP deal

Singapore: Singapore has won a five-year deal to host a Formula One race from next year, the government said on Friday. 

The race may be held in September or early October 2008, and the city-state has the option to extend the deal for another five years after 2012. 

The race could be the first-ever night Grand Prix. 

Singapore could potentially stage the first-ever night race, S. Iswaran, minister of state for trade and industry, told a press briefing. 

He said the race would only be held at night if safety requirements were fully met. 

The sports supremo, Bernie Ecclestone, speaking by teleconference, said he was confident a night race would be held and that safety conditions would be met. 

Its going to be lit as if its daylight, he said.

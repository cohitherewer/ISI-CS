The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Inzy to quit ODIs tomorrow

Kingston: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq announced his retirement from one-day Internationals, barely a day after his teams shocking exit from the World Cup and hours after the mysterious death of coach Bob Woolmer. 

The 37-year-old captain, the mainstay of Pakistans batting for years, said the World Cup group tie against Zimbabwe on Wednesday would be his last ODI, a match he wanted to dedicate to Woolmer. 

Inzamams decision, which was very much on the cards after the teams botched World Cup campaign, means that Pakistan will have a new ODI captain who will have to revive the fortunes of a talented but unpredictable team. 

Although the burly batsman, one of the top performers for Pakistan with 11,702 runs from 377 ODIs and 8,813 Test runs from 119 matches, wants to continue playing in the longer version, his future as captain would be decided by the PCB. 

Inzamam said that he discussed the issue with his coach, the late Woolmer, before making up his mind. 

A lot of people may think that this was not the right time to announce retirement, but Woolmer had agreed with me, he said at a press conference here on Sunday. 

I had a very strong attachment with the coach and I myself felt very bad, Inzamam said. But I had already decided anyway. 

The Zimbabwe match will be my last ODI. Leading Pakistan was a great honour and these last three years have been the most memorable for me. 

It was his fifth World Cup and his dream of winning it as a captain would remain unfulfilled. I wanted to go on a high, but this was not in my fate, he said. I also talked with my father and decided to retire from one-day cricket after the Zimbabwe match, Inzamam said. 

Inzamam burst on the international scene in the 1992 World Cup when his sizzling knocks in the semi-final and final helped Pakistan to their maiden crown. (AGENCIES)

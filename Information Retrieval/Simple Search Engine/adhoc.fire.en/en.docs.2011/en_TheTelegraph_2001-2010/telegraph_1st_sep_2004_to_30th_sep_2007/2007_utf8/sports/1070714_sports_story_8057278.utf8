 Tough course a challenge for me: Jeev

Kuala Lumpur: Jeev Milkha Singh, preparing for his British Open debut next week, says he is looking forward to the challenge of the tough links layout at Carnoustie. 

I love playing on a tough course. It is a challenge for me. I have more patience when I play a tough course. I tell myself I will make mistakes just like everybody else, so its just a matter of making fewer, he said. 

The Asian Tour No. 1, who finished 37th on his US Masters debut in April and improved by a notch at the US Open last month, will make his fifth major appearance at Carnoustie. 

The US Open was some experience. It was the toughest major I have ever played in my life. It was a true test of patience. I just hung in there. The greens were so tough, tougher even than Augusta national, he said. 

After a relatively quiet start to the year, Jeev, who bagged four titles last year and topped the Asian Tour Order of Merit, feels he is finally hitting top form, with three top-20s boosting his confidence ahead of the years third major. 

I am feeling good. I have just had to deal with a few minor injuries. I am looking forward to the Open. I have played at Carnoustie at the Dunhill Links previously and I enjoyed the course. It will be a great test of golf, he said. 

The 35-year-old is not too worried about the side effects of playing 40 weeks a year. I have a busy run until the USPGA championship next month, which means nine weeks in a row for me.

 United thrash Shenzhen 

Macau: Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo, Ryan Giggs and three others scored as Manchester United gave Chinese side Shenzhen Xiangxue Eisiti a 6-0 drubbing in the southern Chinese gambling enclave of Macau on Monday. 

Picking up a short pass, Rooney dribbled into the penalty box at Macau Stadium and passed to the middle to Giggs for the follow through in the 11th minute. 

Rooney himself found the net by delicately curving the ball from inside the penalty box into the top right corner of the goal in the 19th minute. Then Nani drilled the ball into the bottom left corner of the net in the 22nd minute. 

Ronaldo tapped the ball to John Shea inside the penalty box and the latter made it 4-0. (AP)

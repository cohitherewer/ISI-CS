 Rixons no to Pak offer

Karachi: Former New Zealand coach Steve Rixon has reportedly pulled out of the race for the Pakistan job. According to a PCB official, Dav Whatmore is now the frontrunner to succeed Bob Woolmer as Pakistan coach. 

[The Telegraph had reported last Saturday that Rixon was the PCBs No. 1 choice. He, however, had indicated to it that he had reservations.] 

I am grateful that they (PCB) did make contact with me but at this point in time I have decided to coach private schools in Australia. I am not inclined to take an international assignment, he was quoted as saying by an agency. 

Senior PCB official Zakir Khan, who also heads the special committee to shortlist prospective candidates, did say Whatmore remained the frontrunner now. (PTI)

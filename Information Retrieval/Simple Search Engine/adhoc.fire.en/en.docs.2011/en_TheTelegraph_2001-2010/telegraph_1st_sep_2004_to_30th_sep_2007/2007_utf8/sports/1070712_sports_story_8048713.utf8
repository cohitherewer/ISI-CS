 PCB mulls dope tests

Karachi: To avoid further doping controversies, especially involving Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is contemplating dope tests on all the probables for the upcoming ICC World Twenty20 meet. 

The PCB has now made its anti-doping regulations compliant with those of Wada following the recent verdict of the Court of Arbitration for Sports in the Akhtar-Asif case. 

Both the pacers are in the 30-member preliminary squad for the ICC World Twenty20, to be held in South Africa in September, and are expected to be in the final 15-man squad. 

In another development, PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf said his country was safe to host international teams despite recent clashes between security forces and militants at the Lal Masjid. 

We are going ahead as with our programme and at this moment we are confident we will face no problems with security issues raised by touring teams, Dr Ashraf said. (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Md. Sp. hope to do an HASC

Calcutta: Its certainly a do-or-die match for Mohammedan Sporting when they face three-time champions Mohun Bagan in the ONGC National Football League clash at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. 

A loss to Mohun Bagan will surely push the black-and-whites more into relegation zone. But the side looks to take a cue from Bangalores Hindustan Aeronautics Sports Clubs (HASC) upset win over Mahindra United. 

Mohammedan Sporting have 11 points from 14 matches, while Mohun Bagan have 16 points from 13. 

We know that another loss will confirm our relegation. But HASCs win has been an inspiration for us to go all out and give our very best tomorrow. In fact, we have been in similar positions before but even then we turned it around. So, I do not see any reason why we should not do it this time as well, said Mohammedan Sporting coach Biswajit Bhattacharya. 

Bhattacharya made it clear that there will not be any separate strategy for Mohun Bagan duo Bhaichung Bhutia and Jose Ramirez Barreto. 

Mohammedan Sporting may miss the services of midfielder Noel Wilson and defender Madhab Das. 

Having pulled off a stunning win over arch-rivals East Bengal on Sunday, Mohun Bagan on the other hand look alive and are confident of a win. 

Despite injury, Bhaichung will take the field. 

In Fatorda, Ranty Martins scored a brace as Dempo rallied from a goal deficit to beat Churchill Brothers 3-1 .

 Bashar stays unfazed

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Chittagong: The buzz is that Bangladeshs outgoing coach Dav Whatmore is the frontrunner for the Indian job after the ongoing series. 

The news that BCCI president Sharad Pawar is coming here on Saturday has added further credence to the belief following Whatmores self-admission that he is interested taking up the offer. 

While Dravid didnt comment on the issue, Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar remains unfazed by the emerging developments. 

We are not unsettled by the Dav issue, Bashar told reporters on Thursday, ahead of the first Test. 

When we were in the West Indies for the World Cup, the same thing happened but that could not upset our gameplan. Dav is a professional coach and we are also professional players. 

We are aware of our duties and that is to do our best for the country. Our focus is very much on the game. Dav is also giving his hundred per cent as a coach and as part of the team management. 

We are not bothered about what is coming out in newspapers, Bashar pointed out. 

Dravid, however, bypassed the issue, saying our focus is solely on the match and nothing else.

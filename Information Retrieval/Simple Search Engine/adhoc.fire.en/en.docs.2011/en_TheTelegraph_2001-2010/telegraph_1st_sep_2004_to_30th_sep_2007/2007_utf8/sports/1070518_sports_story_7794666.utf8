 Fine start 

by Ghei 

Macau: Gaurav Ghei, returning to the Asian Tour after his win in Beijing last month, shot a flawless six-under in the opening round of the Macau Open on Thursday. 

Ghei, with his 65 at the par-71 Macau Golf and Country Club, was one shot behind sole leader and Asian Tour rookie Australian Leigh McKechnie. 

There was a lot to cheer about in the Indian camp as Arjun Singh, Digvijay Singh, Uttam Singh Mundy and Rahil Gangjee brought in four-under 67 each to be tied 13th on a good scoring day. 

Youngsters Gaganjeet Bhullar and Sujjan Singh shot one-under 70 each to be tied 51st. Amrtinder singh and S.S.P. Chowrasia were one-over for tied 90th. Harmeet Kahlon and Gurbaaz Mann were two-over 73, while Firoz Ali (74) was tied 114th. 

McKechnie was one shot clear of a bunch of five.

 4-day training session from Jan. 17

Nagpur: The Indian cricket team will have a four-day training session prior to their opening ODI against the West Indies on January 21, Vidarbha Cricket Association sources said on Thursday. 

The team members will assemble by January 16 night here and go in for a rigorous practice session from January 17 to 20 before the Sunday ODI here, sources said. 

They dismissed reports of a conditioning camp prior to the West Indies tour. 

Meanwhile in another development, coach Greg Chappell and BCCI selection committee chairman Dilip Vengsarkar had a detailed discussion with BCCI vice-chairman Shashank Manohar on Wednesday. 

They sought time from Manohar for a discussion and since he had his professional commitments in city and could not make it to Mumbai, the duo flew in here and later left for Delhi, sources said.

 Hair rejects ECB offer

London: Darrell Hair has rejected an offer from the England and Wales Cricket Board to stay on its reserve umpires list. 

The Australian umpire whose accusation of ball tampering against Pakistan led to the first forfeit in Test crickets 129-year history had been on the list for the past two seasons. 

The England and Wales Cricket Board has been informed by Darrell Hair that he is unable to accept their offer to be a member of the ECB reserve umpires list for the forthcoming season, English crickets governing body said in a statement Monday. 

The ECB acknowledge Mr. Hairs contributions in the previous two seasons as a reserve umpire. 

Reserve umpires provide cover for the ECBs 25 full-time umpires at domestic games.

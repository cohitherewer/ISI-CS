 Bashar hopes to give Dav a special gift

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Dhaka: Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar hopes to give coach Dav Whatmore a special farewell gift. Whatmores contract with Bangladesh Cricket Board ends with the final Test, starting here on Friday. 

He has injected self-belief into us. We are keen to do something which will please him. We are hoping to give him something special, Bashar said. 

Drawing inspiration from the teams fight back in the first Test, Bashar also sent out a warning to Rahul Dravid and Co. 

There were a lot of positives from the Chittagong Test. We kept coming back when they pushed us. Its a different ball game now, but we are confident going into the match, he said. 

True we have been playing Test cricket after a long time. In ODIs, you can triumph on a given day. But to win a Test you have to perform consistently over five days. We are keen to prove ourselves. Ill not be surprised if we can draw this game or even win it, Bashar said. 

Anil Kumble, he said, could prove to be a key factor in the match. Kumble is a champion bowler. Every team is proud to have a bowler like him. We have to be cautious against him.

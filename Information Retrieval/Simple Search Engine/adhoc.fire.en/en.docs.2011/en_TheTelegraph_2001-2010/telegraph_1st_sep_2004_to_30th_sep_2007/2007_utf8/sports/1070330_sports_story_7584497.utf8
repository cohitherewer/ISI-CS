 Gillian: Speed up probe

Kingston: Bob Woolmers widow Gillian has requested the police investigating into the death to speed up their probe. I just hope this thing can be done so we can find out who committed this terrible act, Gillian told a Jamaica newspaper. 

A coroners inquest ordered into the coachs death means the family would not be able to bury him until the inquest is over. Its been a hard time for us. But it cant be released because thats Jamaican law, she said. 

Meanwhile, PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf said the probe should end early. We realise that a case like this it takes time. But we would ask the Jamaican authorities to expedite the probe and reach a conclusion as early as possible, Ashraf said. (agencies)

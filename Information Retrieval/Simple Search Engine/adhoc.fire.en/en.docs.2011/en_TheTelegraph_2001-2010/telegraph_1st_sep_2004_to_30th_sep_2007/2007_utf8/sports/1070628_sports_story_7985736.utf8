The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Club football can wait, says Bhutia

New Delhi: Indian captain Bhaichung Bhutia feels that time has come to attach more importance to the national team than club engagements. 

On Wednesday evening, the ace striker reached the capital to join the national camp for the ONGC Cup and immediately welcomed All India Football Federations plans to hold longer camps for the senior national team this season. 

The camp, which is beginning in Gurgaon on Thursday, is likely to be one of the longest in the recent past. Barring a weeks gap in between, the players will remain engaged here till the end of August. 

It hasnt, however, dampened Bhutias spirit. Speaking exclusively to The Telegraph, the Indian captain said it was the only way to improve Indias performance at the international level. 

I know some of us here will miss the greater part of the Calcutta league this season as we will be busy playing for India, Bhutia said. But club football can wait. Our football will only improve if we can make a mark at the international level. 

According to Bhutia, national team fixtures should be given preference above all domestic tournaments, including the National Football League. Playing around in domestic tournaments gets us into a groove. It doesnt take us anywhere really. 

The seasoned goal-scorer is pinning a lot of hopes on the current national side that is set to play 15 matches on the trot this season. 

This team has a chance to develop into a fine side, Bhutia said. Some of the players here like Sunil Chhetri and NS Manju have bright future. I am sure they will shoulder the national teams responsibility for a long time. 

The charismatic footballer is particularly excited about the fact that he will be playing in a full-fledged international tournament on home soil after 10 years. 

In 1997, we played in the Nehru Cup in Kochi and reached the semi-finals. In Delhi, we hope to perform even better.

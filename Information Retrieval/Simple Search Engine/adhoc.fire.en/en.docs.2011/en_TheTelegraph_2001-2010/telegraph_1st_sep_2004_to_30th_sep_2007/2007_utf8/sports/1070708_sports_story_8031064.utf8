 Atwal moves up to tied 26

Highland Heights (Ohio): Arjun Atwal rode a hattrick of birdies in his back nine to return a card of three-under 68 and move up to tied 26th spot after round two of the Legend Financial Group Classic on the US Nationwide Tour. 

Atwal is four-under 138 after two rounds and six off the lead, held by Australian Scott Gardiner (66). 

The Orlando-based golfer is playing on the Nationwide Tour after a gap of six years. He made four cuts in 2001 and now has a Nationwide Tour record of 11 cuts after having made the cut in each of seven starts this season.

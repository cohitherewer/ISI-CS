 Humpy clinches Kaupthing title

Luxembourg: Koneru Humpy beat German International Master Sebast Siebrecht in the ninth and final round to clinch the Kaupthing Open chess title here. 

The Indian GM took home a prize money of 3,000 euro along with a special prize of 1,500 euro, which was set aside for a woman winner. 

Humpy finished level with Israeli GM Hannes Stefansson at seven points but won the title by virtue of her better overall performance. 

Humpy and Stefansson were half a point clear of their nearest rivals. Overnight joint leaders GM Erdos Viktor of Hungary and his Czech counterpart Petr Velicka were among the five tied at 6.5 points. 

While Viktor drew his final game against French IM Gharamian Tigran, Velicka suffered a loss to Stefansson. (PTI)

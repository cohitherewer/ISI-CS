 Atwal slips to 46th

Moosic (US): Arjun Atwal hit two birdies in the final two holes but still found himself way down in 46th place at the end of Round III of the $500,000 Nationwide Pennsylvania Classic golf meet. 

Atwal shot a two-over 74 with four birdies and six bogeys, three on either side on Saturday. 

Earlier in the second round, Atwal started from two-under after six, when rain and poor light stopped play on Friday. On Saturday morning, he finished the round in three-under 68 with three more birdies and two bogeys. 

Richard Johnson shot a 4-under-par 67 to take a one-stroke lead over D.A. Points. 

Atwal started on the 10th and had bogeys on 11th, 15th and 16th, before he pulled back one with birdie on 18th. 

On his second nine, he birdied fourth and again dropped a shot on fifth. Birdies on eighth and ninth gave him some hope for the next round. 

Atwal is 46th on Nationwide money list and needs to get into top-25 to earn a PGA Tour card for 2008.

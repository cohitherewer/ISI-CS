Calcutta: Manoj Tewari was on his way home from the airport hoping to share his Mumbai exploits with family and friends the Ranji Trophy final and the domestic awards function Tuesday night when buddy Avishek Jhunjhunwala called on his cell phone to convey the big news. 

Manojs Bengal teammate had just heard about his inclusion for the Eden one-dayer. 

 A little later, Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Prasun Mukherjee spoke to Manoj, confirming that he has been called up to do duty as 12th man against Sri Lanka on Thursday. 

This follows fitness doubts over three key players in the Team India squad. More so because the team management doesnt want to take any risk ahead of the World Cup. 

Expectedly, people from his para at the Railway quarters in Howrah broke into impromptu celebrations as Manoj reached home. 

Things, however, didnt fall into place as Manoj would have liked as confusion and drama followed. He was asked to report at the team hotel, but on arrival was told that there was no room earmarked in his name. 

As Manoj waited anxiously in the lobby, the excitement in his eyes was not to be missed. 

This is unexpected This is a dream come true. It will be a great honour to share the dressing room with the likes of Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid. I will try to prove myself, even if it means only fielding, Manoj told The Telegraph. 

The 21-year-old then spoke to Mukherjee who asked him to come to the Eden. He was told that he would stay at home and report straight to the ground. 

But as he got ready to pick up the kits he had left behind at the hotel, came the news that the BCCI had arranged for a room. Another change in plans and around eight, Manoj finally checked in. 

The former India under-19 captain was the second highest run-getter in Ranji Trophy this season with 796 from seven matches at an average of 99.50. 

The Ranji Trophy final experience has been of great help. I have never faced bowlers of the calibre of Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar before It was nice to get runs against them, he remarked. 

What was Sunil Gavaskars advice to him at the awards function? He asked me to focus on my temperament and try and improve, informed Manoj. 

That is what he wants to do in the coming days.

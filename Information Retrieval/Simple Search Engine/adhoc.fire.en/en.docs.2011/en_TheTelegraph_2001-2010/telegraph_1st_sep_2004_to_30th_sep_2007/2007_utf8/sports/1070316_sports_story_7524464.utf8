 South Africa full of self-belief

Basseterre: South Africas record pursuit of 434 last year against Australia has given Proteas a belief that anything is possible in one-day cricket. 

Speaking ahead of South Africas opening World Cup match against the Netherlands on Friday, captain Graeme Smith pointed to the 3-2 series win over Australia in March 2006, capped by scoring 438 in the final game, as proof. 

Once you achieve targets of chasing over 400, you almost break the barrier in terms of thinking whats possible, he said on Wednesday. To chase 434 and win the game really gives you a lot of confidence in all facets of what you want to achieve, and I think this team broke a lot of barriers that day. 

Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath had accused South Africa of fearing defeat and a lack of self-belief, echoing comments from former Australia skipper Steve Waugh. 

But Smith returned the retort, and spiced up the key group A clash between the worlds two top-ranked teams at Warner Park on March 24. 

I think weve handled pressure a lot better than Australia of late, in the big games, Smith said. In the last 10 one-dayers, weve been under pressure at times and got out of it superbly. Weve been four or five (wickets) down and weve still got close to totals of 300. 

Australia have struggled of late before this tournament, in some finals and obviously in New Zealand, but both teams come into this tournament with the same amount of pressure on their shoulders. 

South Africa have to first play the Netherlands and Smith will be without fast bowler Makhaya Ntini, who rejoined the squad on Wednesday after staying home to attend the birth of his second child. 

We wanted him to sort out his family business first, we dont want him worrying about his wife and new daughter, Smith said. 

Ntini is likely to be replaced by either paceman Roger Telemachus or left-arm spinner Robin Peterson, but Smith is concerned by the size of Warner Park and hinted that pace might be preferred. The ground looks pretty small. Its not very big the straight boundaries look small, he said. With our ability to hit the ball out of the ground, its certainly going to play into our hands. 

Smith has acquired television footage of the Netherlands and Scotland, whom they play on Tuesday, and says he knows little about both. However, Shaun Pollock has done his homework on the Dutch. 

They dont have too many express bowlers and I know their keeper stands up to the stumps pretty much for the whole innings, which means you have to adopt a different game plan when youre batting because you have to keep your feet in the crease, Pollock said. 

Jeroen Smits is the wicketkeeper who will keep South Africa honest, but Pollock will be wise to not underestimate the Dutch attack after Ryan Ten Doeschate took five for 57 in a warm-up match against India. 

Ten Doeschate, who also made 31 in that game batting at No. 4, is likely to be one of three South Africa-born players in the Dutch team, along with medium-pacer Billy Stelling and batsman Eric Szwarczynski. 

Apart from the fact that there are one or two South Africans in there that we do know there are one or two South Africans in most teams we dont know a lot about them, Smith said.

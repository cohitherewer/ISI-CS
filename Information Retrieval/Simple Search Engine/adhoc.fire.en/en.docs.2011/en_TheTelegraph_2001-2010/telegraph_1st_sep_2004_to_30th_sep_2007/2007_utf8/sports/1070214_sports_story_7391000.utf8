 Nominations to be considered today

 - ICC PRESIDENTS POST 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The ICC Nominations Committee will meet in Dubai on Wednesday to consider the two nominations for the next ICC presidents post. 

According to an ICC media release, the members of the committee will make a recommendation to the Executive Board scheduled to meet in Cape Town on March 1. 

Chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, David Morgan, and President of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, Sharad Pawar, are the two nominees to succeed current president Percy Sonn after his term ends in 2008. 

A new system for appointing the president was put in place in June 2005. The Nominations Committee, which is the first step of a three-stage process, will report to the Board which in turn will forward a recommendation to the ICC Annual Conference in London in June where final voting will take place. 

In order to be successfully voted in as ICC President, a candidate must secure support from two-thirds of the ten Full Members at the Annual Conference. 

The ICC Nominations Committee consists of Dr AC Muthiah (Chairman) (India and Sri Lanka), Bob Merriman (Australia and New Zealand), Mueen Afzal (Bangladesh and Pakistan), Stephen Camacho (West Indies and England), John Blair (South Africa and Zimbabwe) and Imran Khwaja (Associates and Affiliates). 

The report of the committee will be confidential and is unlikely to be communicated until after the ICC Executive Board meeting.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Hard to say Australia wont be in Cup semis 

On Tuesday afternoon, West Indies captain Brian Lara had some things to say about the World Cup. 

Here goes: 

We wanted this (four-match) series very badly... We had a lot to gain and (some) guys got the opportunity to present their case for selection in the World Cup 15... If we (West Indies and India) get past the first round, then well be meeting in the Super Eight, so its important to win tomorrow... 

Today, its hard to say Australia wont be in the semis... Once there, I hope theyre going to falter... However, weve got the ingredients to get there, too... Were quietly confident as weve got the game to make the last four (at least)... 

The Australians have matchwinners in plenty and Im looking for more matchwinners in our team... Right now, weve only got a handful... The good thing is that weve got a team which is gelling and its just a matter of cleaning up a few things in our act (before the World Cup)... 

Ive spoken about the semi-finals... It will be a different game once that stage is reached... Any of the four teams could win the World Cup...

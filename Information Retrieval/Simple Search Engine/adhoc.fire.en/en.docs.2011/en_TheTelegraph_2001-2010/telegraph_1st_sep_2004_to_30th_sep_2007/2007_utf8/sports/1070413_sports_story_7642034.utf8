 Peter Crouch ensures an England treble

The English annexation of Europe intensified on Wednesday night when Liverpool joined Manchester United and Chelsea in the semi-finals of the Champions League. 

Before the campaign began, everyone thought such Premiership domination would have been a tall order, so it was thoroughly appropriate that it was Peter Crouch, with his seventh European goal of the season, who confirmed Liverpools place in the last four (briefly reported in Thursdays Late City edition). 

Crouch took his goal well, turning in a clever cross from Robbie Fowler, although Liverpools night was scarred by the knee ligament damage sustained by Craig Bellamy. Crouch and company now face Frank Lampard, John Terry, Joe Cole and the rest of Jose Mourinhos Chelsea all-stars in a semi-final brimming with English talent. 

To the delight of the watching Steve McClaren, English players were to the fore. Pennant clearly fancied his chances against PSVs left-back, Carlos Salcido, and he ran at the Mexican international dubbed the Ironman. 

The nickname must have been laced with irony. Salcidos mettle was well and truly tested by Pennant, who constantly twisted the left-back inside out. 

After 20 minutes, Pennant left Salcido staring at a cackling Kop as the Liverpool winger eluded him. Pennants cross was perfectly judged for Crouch, who adjusted his gangling body well to meet the ball, and then threw himself into an athletic hooked volley that Gomes saved brilliantly. 

It was Liverpools best chance of the half, barring a Bolo Zenden free-kick just wide after Salcido had brought down Fowler. Liverpools beloved No. 9 had scampered on after 16 minutes following injury to Bellamy. 

The Dutch had desperately missed the commanding presence of the injured centre-half, Alex, in Eindhoven although they reached half-time with few scares. 

The camaraderie between supporters soon extended between the PSV and Liverpool parties. After Crouch had fired just wide, the Eindhoven supporters launched into You Only Sing When You Are Winning, in perfect English, and then began chanting the Ring of Fire tune adopted by Liverpool fans in Istanbul. 

The Kop greatly appreciated the gesture and returned the compliment with a flurry of Eindhoven, Eindhoven. The game was a sideshow as the Kop auditioned for choir of the year. The Benitez song rolled from side to side, interspersed with chants of support for PSV. 

Liverpools empathy for PSV increased after 62 minutes when Marcellis was harshly dismissed for mistiming a tackle on Zenden in a match played at testimonial pace. The right-backs challenge was far from malicious and Roberto Rosettis stone-hearted decision to brandish a red card angered both PSV and Liverpool alike. Marcellis was applauded from the field.

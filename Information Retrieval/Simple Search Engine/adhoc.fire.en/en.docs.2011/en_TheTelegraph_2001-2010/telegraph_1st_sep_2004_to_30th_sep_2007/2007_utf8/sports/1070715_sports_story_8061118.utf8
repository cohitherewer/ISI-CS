Kandy: Muttiah Muralidharan became the second player to claim 700 Test wickets in guiding Sri Lanka to an innings and 193-run victory over Bangladesh in the third and final match on Saturday. 

Bangladesh were dismissed for 176 shortly before tea on the fourth day after Sri Lanka had declared on their overnight total of 500 for four, condemning the tourists to a 3-0 series whitewash following a pair of equally heavy defeats in Colombo. 

Cheered on by a raucous hometown crowd, Muralidharan followed his six for 28 figures in the first innings with another six for 54 in the second to capture his 20th 10-wicket haul in Tests. 

Sri Lankas talismanic off-spinner reached the landmark when he took the last wicket of match, tricking Syed Rasel into spooning up a catch to Farveez Mahroof at mid off. 

The 35-year-old is now just eight wickets short of Australian leg-spinner Shane Warnes world record tally, a figure he appears set to pass during Sri Lankas two-Test tour of Australia in November. 

Muralidharan was later named Man of the Match and the Man of the Series, having claimed 26 wickets at an average of 10.84.

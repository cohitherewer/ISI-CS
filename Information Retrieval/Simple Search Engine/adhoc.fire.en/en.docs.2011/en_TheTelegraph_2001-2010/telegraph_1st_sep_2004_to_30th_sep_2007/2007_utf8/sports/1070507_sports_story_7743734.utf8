 Parthiv shines, Armaan falters

New Delhi: Armaan Ebrahim had a nightmarish day but Parthiv Sureshwaren more than compensated with a second-place finish in the second race of the Formula Renault V6 Series in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday. 

Sureshwaran, who signed a last-minute deal with Eurasia Motorsport and got into the car for the first time on Friday, had managed a seventh in the first race on Saturday, according to information received here. 

Armaans team Tara-DTM was stripped of pole on technicalities following protest from rivals. Starting from fourth position, Armaan finished 10th (last) in the first race and eighth in the second. 

Akhil Khushani, the other Indian in action, finished fifth in the second race.

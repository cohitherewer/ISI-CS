 Kimi cruises to victory

 Melbourne: Kimi Raikkonen led Ferrari into a post-Schumacher era on Sunday as if nothing had changed, with the team starting the season in triumph just as they ended last year. 

Formula Ones Flying Finn, taking the place of retired seven times champion Michael Schumacher, cruised to a comfortable victory on his debut for the Italian team at the Australian Grand Prix. 

It was the 10th victory of Raikkonens career and he made it look as easy as a Sunday stroll in Albert Park in becoming the first driver to win on his Ferrari debut since Briton Nigel Mansell in Brazil in 1989. 

 It was a good race for us. I didnt have to push too hard, just have to pace myself a bit and look at what the others were doing, he said. Of course its always nice to come to the first race and win straight away, Ive never done that before. 

The 27-year-old punched the air with both fists as he crossed the line 7.2 seconds ahead of McLarens double world champion Fernando Alonso. Its a long time since I heard the Finnish anthem, Raikkonen said. The Italian one I have heard quite often. 

McLarens 22-year-old British rookie Lewis Hamilton completed a stunning weekend for the youngest man on the grid by overtaking Alonso at the start and leading his first Grand Prix for four laps before finishing third. He became the 55th driver to score points in his first Formula One race. Sundays race was also the first season-opener since 1991 without Schumacher.

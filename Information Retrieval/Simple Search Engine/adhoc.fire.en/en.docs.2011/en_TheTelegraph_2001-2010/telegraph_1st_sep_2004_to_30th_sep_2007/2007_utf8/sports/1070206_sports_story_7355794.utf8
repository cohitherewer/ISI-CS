The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Umpires need to be good managers too

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: When the youngest umpire to have officiated in 100 ODIs takes a seminar, sharing his experience on and off the field, the response will obviously be overwhelming. 

At the CAB conference hall, on Sunday, that was evident when Australian Simon Taufel (here to officiate in the first India-Sri Lanka one-dayer on Thursday) took the dais. In fact, such was the enthusiasm among the city umpires that the seminar refused to end. Prolonging well over three hours with a snacks break in between, it eventually ended up with a Q-A session and the three-time ICC Umpire of the Year awardee looking impressed. 

Talking to The Telegraph following his 6-9 pm seminar (on 25 lessons to become a good umpire), Taufel who turned 36 on January 21 said: With so many umpires turning up for the seminar, it was great to share some ideas with them they showed willingness to learn and their attitude was encouraging. 

Asked what was it all about, he said that he shared his experience with them. 

Umpiring is not just about decision-making, but to become a good manager for players and coaches of both teams Its about developing a relationship to facilitate the great game of cricket. 

An international Francis Gomes, who has umpired in two ODIs, termed this an excellent experience. 

If we remember and implement what he said today the standard of the umpiring among us could improve dramatically.

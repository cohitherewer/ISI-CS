 Murali can handle taunts: Bayliss

 Trevor Bayliss 

Colombo: Sri Lankas new coach Trevor Bayliss on Monday said talismanic spinner Muttiah Muralidharan should not worry about being taunted during their upcoming tour of Australia. 

Muralidharan is one of the worlds best bowlers and I am sure the Australians will look forward to see him performing in the two Tests, Bayliss said, responding to possible anti-Murali sentiments among the fans Down Under. 

Muralidharan has endured a turbulent relationship with Australian crowd since he was no-balled for throwing by Australian umpire Darrell Hair in the 1995 Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. 

The Sri Lanka off-spinner needs nine wickets to surpass retired Australian leg-spinner Shane Warnes world record tally of 708. 

Bayliss will allow his boys to stick to their naturally attacking style, a strategy that clicked for predecessor Tom Moody. 

The Australian, who took over from compatriot Moody after the World Cup in April, said he would continue the tactics that helped Sri Lanka reach the final. 

Sri Lanka have been successful with their attacking style. Not a lot would change as they have proved successful during the last 18 months or so, Bayliss said on Monday. 

Under Moody, the Sri Lankans shed their tag of poor travellers by drawing the Test series in New Zealand and England. (AGENCIES)

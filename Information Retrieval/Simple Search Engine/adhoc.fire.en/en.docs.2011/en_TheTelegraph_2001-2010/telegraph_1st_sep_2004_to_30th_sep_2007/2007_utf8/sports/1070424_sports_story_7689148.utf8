 Police mum on suspect

 Bob Woolmer 

Kingston: Playing down media reports of a suspects identification in the Bob Woolmer murder case, Jamaica police have refused to confirm or deny any such development. 

Police have opted to maintain silence on the issue despite having the CCTV footage of the hotel, where the Pakistan coach was found murdered, back in their possession after digital enhancement. 

British media had reported that a suspect had been caught on the CCTV from the Jamaica Pegasus where the incident occurred a little over a month ago. 

The footage had been sent to Britain for digital enhancement and is now with the Jamaica Police, who said they would inform about the result later. 

When that is so, the media will be officially informed, director of communications of the Jamaica Constabulary Force, Karl Angell, said. 

Yes, we have received some of the footage from Scotland Yard, but I cannot comment on the matter, another high-ranking officer was quoted as saying by a Jamaican newspaper on Monday. 

Earlier, the British media had given a new twist to the case by reporting that snake venom may have been used to poison Woolmer.

Mumbai: Young Sri Lanka opener Upul Tharanga said on Saturday that he enjoys batting with veteran Sanath Jayasuriya, but never tries to match the flamboyant batsman in stroke-play. 

Tharanga, who scored successive centuries in the ICC Champions Trophy in India, said they complement each other. 

I never try to match him. Batting with Sanath has been very good for me. He goes for the shots leaving me free to play my game, said Tharanga, after the visitors first practice session at the Bandra Kurla Complex since landing in Mumbai on Friday. 

Tharanga, who celebrated his 22nd birthday on Friday, also felt that playing against India would be beneficial as they are in the same group in the upcoming World Cup. 

Playing against India here gives us a good chance ahead of the World Cup as we are in the same group, he said. 

The islanders will play a warm-up game at the CCI on Sunday against Mumbai XI. They have a rest day on Monday before leaving for Calcutta for the series opener on Thursday at Eden Gardens. 

The left-hander felt the recent tour of New Zealand has been a learning experience. 

It helped us learn how to bat in conditions different from the sub-continent and the necessity to be patient, he said.

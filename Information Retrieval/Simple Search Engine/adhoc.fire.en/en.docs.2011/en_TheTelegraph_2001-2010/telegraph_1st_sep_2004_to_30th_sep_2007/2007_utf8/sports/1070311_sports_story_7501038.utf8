 Sehwag can do a Sourav: Pawar

Bangalore: Beleaguered Virender Sehwag on Saturday received some support from Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Sharad Pawar, who said the swashbuckling batsman would soon rediscover his touch and silence his critics in the same way as former captain Sourav Ganguly did. 

This (bad patch) is part and parcel of the game. A year back, people were talking in same terms about Sourav. All that has stopped now after he performed so well. Now Sourav has become an asset to the team, Pawar said. 

Sehwag has been struggling for runs in the past few months. The rough patch continued in the World Cup warm-up matches where he was out for 28 and 0, respectively. 

The BCCI chief said the top order batsman was a match-winner and a vital cog in the team. 

Sometimes you perform and sometimes you dont. You dont have to ponder too much about such players. He is a run-getter, Pawar said.

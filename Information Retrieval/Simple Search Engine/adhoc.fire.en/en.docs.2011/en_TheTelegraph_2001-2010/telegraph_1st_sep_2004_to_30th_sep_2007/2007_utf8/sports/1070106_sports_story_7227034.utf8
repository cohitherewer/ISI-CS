 Captaincy shortens careers

 - While ability is required, being mentally tough counts for a lot: Wessels 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL

 Kepler Wessels 

Cape Town: A centurion on debut for Australia, Kepler Wessels went on to become united South Africas first Test captain. His international career spanned 12 years (1982-1994) and he was recognised as somebody who was solid with the bat (Test average of 41.00) and solid in the mind. Now 49, Wessels was Northants coach till recently and is into private coaching in the country of his birth. The other day, he took time off from Media commitments to talk to The Telegraph. 

The following are excerpts 

On having been regarded as mentally very tough

Mental toughness was definitely one of my strongest points... I was strong from a young age... It had much to do with the way I grew up... In fact, to succeed (in Australia), I had to be physically and mentally strong... As you know, only the strongest survive in Australia. 

On mental toughness being an asset 

I did go through difficult periods trying to qualify for Australia and, at that time, being strong in the mind helped... I had to first qualify and, then, keep my place... Later, it helped when I began playing for South Africa, at the end of the period of isolation... Again, the times then were difficult... There was a lot of pressure, including political... 

On mental toughness 

Being mentally (and physically) tough is a decision which individuals have to make consciously... You can teach yourself to be mentally strong, be able to cope with difficult situations... The more you work on it, the easier it becomes. 

On whether he admired somebody for mental toughness alone 

Ian Chappell... Mentally, he was incredibly tough and had the ability to make you believe you could walk through a wall! That was Ian. He made his players believe there was nothing they couldnt achieve. Among present-day cricketers, somebody I admire is Mike Hussey... Hes gifted, his concentration is excellent and has loads of patience... I worked with him at Northants. 

On having consistently praised Sourav Ganguly for mental toughness 

Well, if he didnt have the right stuff in the head he wouldnt be having such a fine record as a player and captain... He came back because of his desire to play the game... That hunger is important... Thats why Sourav has a future... 

On the importance he would give to mental toughness if asked to choose from a pool of players 

At the top level, everybody has ability... While ability is required, being mentally tough counts for a lot... For me, it will be 70-30... The ones consistently successful are those who have more than just talent. 

On his advice to present-day cricketers 

Allow your performance to speak for you... If performances are there, I dont think theres any situation which cant be handled... Of course, never get too involved with anything thats not connected with the playing of the game... If it happens, then the pressures build up. Cricket is a game of ups and downs and youve got to be ready for situations when the times arent good. 

On being remembered for having instilled mental toughness in the South African team 

We didnt then have international experience and, to compete, needed to be strong in other areas... The mind being one, fitness and fielding the others... I decided to cash in on the passion and commitment... Both are big drivers... (After a pause) I knew we had a good pace attack, spearheaded by Allan Donald, and could do well if the batters put runs on the board. 

On his Australian experience 

I think I used 99 per cent of that experience... Having played Tests and ODIs, I knew exactly how a team had to be prepared... In the Australian system, after all, the preparation is perfect... It was about following the Australian guidelines and having people buy that philosophy... Once done, you cant go wrong. After I retired, Hansie (Cronje) carried that forward. 

On handling the pressures associated with captaining a team short on experience 

My approach, or call it philosophy, was to lead from the front in every respect... Also, I had to know individual players as everybody may not respond to the same motivation... I had to mould my style keeping in mind the personalities in the South African dressing room... The pressure was huge, but the stand I took is we wouldnt compromise on anything when up against the opposition. Absolutely no quarter would be given. 

On having had a hand in grooming Cronje for the captaincy 

He had a very good work ethic... He worked incredibly hard... As captain, I didnt have to worry about Hansie... I didnt have to worry about a Jonty Rhodes either... They did what was expected. 

On Cronje as captain 

Initially, he did very well... He continued with the disciplines Id been working on... He formed a nice partnership with (coach) Bob Woolmer and they brought innovation to South African cricket and the game... What happened to Hansie afterwards is a tragedy... Even today, I dont think anybody really knows how that (match-fixing) situation unfolded... 

On captaincy 

(Grins) Well, captaincy shortens careers... 

On whether captains, in any case, have a shelf-life 

Both captains and coaches... The intelligent ones know when their time is up. 

Finally, on the captain-coach relationship 

Their personalities have to complement each other... Its not that the individuals have to like each other, but you cant have a conflict-situation... I personally feel that the coachs role hasnt been properly defined. Mickey Arthur got the job in South Africa because the authorities felt his personality would gel with Graeme Smiths... Increasingly, that could become the trend. Lets wait and watch.

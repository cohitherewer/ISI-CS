 Four clubs seek legal advice

London: Four clubs are taking legal advice after the Premier League decided against deducting points from West Ham United over the signings of Argentines Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano, reported a TV channel on Friday. 

Charlton Athletic, Fulham, Sheffield United and Wigan Athletic are unhappy West Ham were fined a record 5.5 million last week, rather than receiving a 10-point deduction for breaching ownership rules. 

The channel reported that representatives of the four clubs met at the Harrods offices of Fulham owner Mohammed al Fayed on Friday. 

You should understand we are separately in the process of obtaining legal advice arising out of the terms of the decision, the four clubs told the Premier League in a statement. 

You can expect to hear from us in relation to this in the early part of next week. 

It was earlier reported that six clubs were considering legal action against the Premier League. 

With Watford already relegated, West Ham, Charlton, Wigan, Fulham and Sheffield United are all fighting to avoid the drop. West Ham boosted their chances of survival by beating Wigan 3-0 last Saturday. A points deduction would have almost certainly condemned them to relegation.

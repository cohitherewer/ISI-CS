 Buchanan: Gilchrist act a non-issue

Melbourne: Former Australian coach John Buchanan has said that Adam Gilchrists using a squash ball in his gloves in the World Cup final is a non-issue and asked people not to make fuss over it. 

More than a week after the final in which Gilchrist belted a match-winning 149, the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) secretary Kangadaran Mathivanan alleged Gilchrists using of the squash ball was as unethical as Trevor Chappells infamous under-arm delivery. 

Describing it as a disappointing comment, Buchanan said, everybody will be disappointed about this. The final should be a celebration of cricket and Adams innings was outstanding. Comments like these should be ignored by the public, and be dealt with harshly as quickly as possible. 

Its a non-issue. If you want to go down this road, where do you draw the line? Should it be illegal for players to receive strapping to injuries, or for batsmen to use extra grips on their bats? Buchanan told an Australian daily. 

He urged all to remember Gilchrists inning just for its sheer beauty and ignore everything else. (PTI)

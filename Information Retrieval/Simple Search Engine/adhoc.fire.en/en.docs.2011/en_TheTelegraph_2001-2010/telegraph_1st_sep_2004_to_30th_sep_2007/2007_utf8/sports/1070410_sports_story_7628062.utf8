 Pontings power play stole the show

Mark Nicholas

Perhaps by default, Ricky Ponting taught himself something on Sunday. The Australia captain had chosen not to take the third power play until the 27th over of Englands increasingly cultured assault on his bowling attack. With his hand forced, Ponting went on the attack and the result was the beginning of the end for Michael Vaughans team. 

Obliged to recall all but two of his fielders from far-flung pastures, the punter in a hitherto conservative Ponting set one at slip and the rest to save the single. This brought energy to the Australians, who responded by harassing the previously untroubled Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen with a touch of the verbals. 

During a riveting five-over passage of play, England slipped from 146 for two to 168 for four. More importantly, the batting lost momentum. Bell drove into the hands of cover and new players were unable to find touch or timing. 

The frustrated Pietersen lost strike and Australia, sensing their moment, closed in for the kill. To fall from 164 for two to 247 all out on a good pitch was careless to say the least. It was also the story of the game. 

The power plays have confused many a captain. The first period of 10 overs remains obligatory; the next two periods of five overs are optional. They can be taken at any time the fielding captain chooses. Generally, this is when the ball is new and the fast bowlers are searching for wickets, not when damage limitation sets in with second-string bowlers. 

Ponting brought Michael Clarke, a part-timer, into the attack for the 11th over and saved Shaun Tait and Glenn McGrath for the middle of the innings. Certainly, it helped him that two early wickets had gone Australias way, but it was bold nevertheless and earned him great reward later. 

The loss of the tri-series really niggled Ponting, but now the record is set straight. 

All this was in contrast to Vaughan, who lost the game heavily after winning a handy toss. After 83 matches, he averages just 26 clearly an aberration for one so gifted. But an 83-match aberration is no good and will soon undermine his leadership. That and Andrew Flintoffs astonishing loss of form with the bat are very serious issues.

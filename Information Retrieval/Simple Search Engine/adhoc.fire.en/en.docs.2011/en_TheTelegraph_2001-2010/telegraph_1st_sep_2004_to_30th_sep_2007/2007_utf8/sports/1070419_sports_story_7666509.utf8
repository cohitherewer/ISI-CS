 Rafael Nadal extends record on clay

 Nadal in Monte Carlo on Wednesday 

Monte Carlo: Rafael Nadal extended his record claycourt winning streak to 63 matches with a 6-3, 6-1 victory over Argentine Juan Ignacio Chela in the Monte Carlo Masters Series second round on Wednesday. 

The double French Open champion, who also won in the principality in 2005 and 2006, wrapped up a straightforward win on his third match point. 

Following an early exchange of breaks, the left-handed Spaniard twice stole his opponents serve to get a grip on the contest. 

Second seed Nadal broke again in the third game of the second set before going on to secure a meeting with Belgian Kristof Vliegen. 

Swede Robin Soederling caused a major upset when he beat Russian third seed Nikolay Davydenko 6-4, 6-7, 6-3. 

Sixth seed Novak Djokovic overcame a loss of concentration to advance with a 6-1, 3-6, 6-1 win over former French Open champion Gaston Gaudio. 

The 19-year-old Serb only conceded 11 points in the first set. 

Argentine Gaudio, who won at Roland Garros in 2004, took advantage of several unforced errors from Djokovic to level the match before the Serb regained his focus to open a 4-0 lead in the third set. (Reuters)

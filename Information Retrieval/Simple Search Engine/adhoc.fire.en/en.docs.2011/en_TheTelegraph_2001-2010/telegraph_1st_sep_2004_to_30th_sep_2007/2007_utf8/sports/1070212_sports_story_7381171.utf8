 Becks scores on return

Madrid: David Beckham scored on his return after a month on the sidelines to inspire Real Madrid to a 2-1 comeback win at Real Sociedad in the Primera Liga on Saturday. 

The former England captain netted his third league goal of the season when he sent a 25m free-kick skidding under goalkeeper Claudio Bravo to cancel out an early header from Sociedads Mikel Aranburu. 

Ruud van Nistelrooy grabbed the winner three minutes after the break.

 Kumbles tweak with a difference is as deadly

 - What an innings and what an attitude... Dhoni was terrific: Vengsarkar

 second day of the third and final Test against England 

 at the Oval on Friday

London: Absolutely no disrespect to Anil Kumble, but nobody wouldve bet even one pence on the leggie becoming Team Indias first centurion in the ongoing Test series. 

Yet, at the Brit Oval on Friday, Kumble gave such a tweak that it broke Englands back beyond repair. He did so with a first of his own an unbeaten hundred (110 in 216 minutes and off 193 balls; 16x4, 1x6). 

With the veteran, used to making headlines for wrong uns of the conventional kind, creating that little piece of history with the bat, India reached an awesome 664 (highest against England) in innings No.1 of the final npower Test. 

While twists and turns can never be totally discounted, its inconceivable that England will be able to force a win and, thereby, draw the three-match series. 

Realistically, its more a matter of how quickly Michael Vaughans men capitulate. The wicket is quite good, but... 

By stumps on Day II, England were 24 for one and an early finish is projected. It shouldve been two down, but the truly disgusting Ian Howell denied Sreesanth nightwatchman James Andersons wicket. 

Before anything else, England must score a further 441 to avoid the follow-on. So, everything points to Rahul Dravid becoming the third Indian captain (after Ajit Wadekar and Kapil Dev) to win a series in these parts. 

Lucky to get away with a draw at Lords, the Indians have upped their game since. Evidence came quickly, at Trent Bridge. The good work has continued at the Oval, where the Wadekar-led team scripted history 36 summers ago. 

Resuming at the overnight 316 for four, the Indian innings continued till 36 minutes before the scheduled close. A minute more and the Dravids wouldve batted for 12 hours! Not that enough records hadnt been rewritten by then. 

The innings saw eight 50-plus partnerships and, as significant, every single Indian reached double figures. The tally of fours and sixes was no less impressive 81 and nine. 

In looking for culprits, Englands supporters are going to zero in on keeper Matt Prior. He dropped Sachin Tendulkar on 20 (Thursday) and, in the second days seventh over, let go V.V.S Laxman on 41. Eventually, they scored 82 and 51, respectively. 

Besides the misses, Prior conceded 33 byes. Enough reason for him not to socialise with his mates for the next few days. At least. 

While Kumbles achievement is bound to get more kudos, the fiesty Mahendra Singh Dhoni played a lovely innings after the overnighters departed. 

Dhoni, in fact, picked on the England bowlers to celebrate his appointment as Indias Twenty20 captain. He also used the outing to warm-up for the forthcoming ODIs. 

A second Test hundred was there for the asking when Dhoni got a trifle carried away, falling in attempting a hattrick of sixes off Kevin Pietersen. Dhonis 92 came off only 81 balls (121 minutes, 9x4, 4x6). 

What an innings and what an attitude... Dhoni was terrific... Once he was back, I asked what was on his mind. His answer was simple two balls remained in that over... I was looking for a six and a four... Dhonis special, awe-struck chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar told The Telegraph. 

Kumble, who has always had a sound defence and could give the leather a whack, said he was absolutely happy and enjoyed himself. 

Not wanting to deny No.11 Sreesanth his due, Kumble added: Id been 24 short of the hundred when the ninth-wicket fell, but Sreesanth promised he would hang around for me to get there... He did. 

Englands coach, Peter Moores, cut a brave face. Away from the public glare, though, hes sure to admit hes aged after Lords. 

For the record, he maintained: Weve got to take it session by session... For a chance, weve got to win all nine (sessions) that remain... You dont (first) try to save the game as thats a negative approach... 

Good luck to Moores and England.

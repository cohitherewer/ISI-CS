 Sania-Yung in last 8

New Delhi: Top seeds Sania Mirza and Chinese-Taipeis Yung-Jan Chan sailed into the quarter finals of the $200,000 Istanbul Cup with a 6-3, 6-1 win over the Romanian pair of Sorana Cirstea and Agnes Szatmari on Tuesday. 

Sania and Yung-Jan will take on the Greco-German duo of Anna Polunina and Stella Menna in the last eight stage of the Tier-III WTA Tour event. Sania and Yung-Jan were broken twice in the first set but made up for that with four breaks of their own in the opening set. 

The duo put up an even better display in the next set and held serve. They broke the Romanians twice to clinch the match. 

Sania had bowed out of the singles first round. (PTI)

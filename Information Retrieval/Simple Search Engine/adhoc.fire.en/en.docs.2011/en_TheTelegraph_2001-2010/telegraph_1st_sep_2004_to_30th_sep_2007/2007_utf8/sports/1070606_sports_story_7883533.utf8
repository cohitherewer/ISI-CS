The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A steady progression

 Graham Ford 

The unassuming Graham Ford ascended gradually to the position of South African coach bypassing several bigger and more familiar names along the way. An allround sportsman, Ford is a former provincial tennis champion, played football for a provincial side and is a qualified rugby union referee to go with his cricketing credentials. 

The South African had an eight-year first-class career with Natal B during the 1980s, but as a coach he moved steadily through the ranks to become senior Natal coach in 1992. 

He had Malcolm Marshall and Clive Rice to help him guide a crop of outstanding youngsters, including Shaun Pollock, Jonty Rhodes, Lance Klusener, Neil Johnson, Dale Benkenstein and Errol Stewart. His approach proved effective when in 1996-97 Natal won the domestic and first class competitions. 

At the beginning of 1999, Ford was appointed assistant to Bob Woolmer in New Zealand, a role he carried through to the 1999 World Cup, before taking over the senior position when Woolmers contract was over. Under his guidance, South Africa won nine of the 11 series. He was fired in 2002. 

Many believed he paid the price for internal power struggle within South African cricket. He moved to Kent as director of cricket in 2005. 

 He briefly moved back home to take charge of the Dolphins. In 2006, he agreed to a new contract with Kent till 2008 and has been there since.

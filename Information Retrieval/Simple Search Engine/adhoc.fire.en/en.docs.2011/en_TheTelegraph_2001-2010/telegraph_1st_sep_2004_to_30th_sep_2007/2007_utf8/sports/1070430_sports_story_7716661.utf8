The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Arsenal tame Fulham

London: Arsenal scored twice in the last six minutes to secure a 3-1 home victory over Fulham that left their London rivals deep in relegation danger on Sunday. Saturdays results had already guaranteed Arsenal a top-four finish and a place in the Champions League qualifiers, but they are now only a point behind Liverpool in the battle for third which brings only pride and some extra income. 

In a separate incident on Saturday, Sam Allardyce resigned as Bolton Wanderers manager after eight years at the club. 

After careful consideration and dialogue with my close family and senior officials, I will be resigning as manager with immediate effect, Allardyce said.

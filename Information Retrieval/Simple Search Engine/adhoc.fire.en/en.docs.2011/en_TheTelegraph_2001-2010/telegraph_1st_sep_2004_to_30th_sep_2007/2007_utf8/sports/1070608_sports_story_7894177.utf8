 Boys from the Bridge shine by the Baltic

 - Michael Owen overtakes Gary Lineker with 23rd goal as England thrash Estonia 3-0

England banished their recent blues with a wonderful touch of the Blues last night, Chelseas Joe Cole setting Steve McClarens purposeful side on their way to a thoroughly professional victory over Estonia with a fine strike before half-time (as reported in Thursdays Late City edition). Suddenly, confidence flowed into Englands players and second-half goals from Peter Crouch and Michael Owen, both created by the hugely influential David Beckham, heightened hope of qualification for Euro 2008. 

Whatever the widespread doubts about McClarens suitability for such a demanding position, at least events in this delightful, sun-dappled Baltic resort provided encouraging confirmation that real class exists among the players. 

Apart from a lingering concern about McClarens shabby treatment of Jamie Carragher, demoted to the substitutes bench , there is no appetite in the England dressing room for a regime change, and they certainly kept a natural No. 2 in a No. 1s job here. 

Never mind the manager; feel the quality of the players. Beckhams gears may be rusting up, and Kieron Dyers whippet-like arrival highlighted the Real Madrid midfielders declining mobility, but the former captains ability to manipulate a ball into the danger zone remains a potent weapon. 

I will be there at Euro 2008, promised Beckham, 32. I believe I can carry on for a long time. Even hobbling on a twisted ankle, a condition that will alarm Madrid, Beckham delivered. He was not alone. Far from it. 

Good performances could be found throughout the side. Frank Lampard was busily effective in midfield, his work-rate warmly appreciated by the fans. Crouch took his headed goal with timing and conviction, and showed what an awkward customer he can be against average defences. Crouchs one mistake was a stupid booking which rules him out of Israels visit next season, although McClaren will have Wayne Rooney free of suspension. 

Again, it strains incredulity that a coach should struggle in a relatively straightforward qualifying group with such a rich array of talent. Even McClarens reserve left-back, Wayne Bridge, excelled here, providing pace and penetration and some decent crosses. 

On a night when the boys from the Bridge shone by the Baltic, Chelseas captain, John Terry, exuded his usual determination at centre-half, making a crucial tackle on Vladimir Voskoboinikov in the first half and denying Tarmo Neemelo with a goal-line clearance late on. 

England needed a leader last night, and Terry led by example. People talk of Steven Gerrard as being Englands moral leader, their serial saviour and inspiration, but the armband fits well on the muscular arm of the vocal warrior that is John Terry. 

Gerrard was typically assertive in the centre, often tackling back or bursting forward to link up with Owen, who selflessly played the link-man on occasion. 

Englands third goal was a sweet moment for Owen, whose long spell on the sidelines with that devastating World Cup knee injury had encouraged some to fear the Newcastle United flier would never regain that goal-scoring spark. 

No chance. Such a competitive streak runs through Owen, such a desire to break Sir Bobby Charltons England goal-scoring record of 49, that he buzzed around relentlessly. Such industry was rewarded. So there was Owen, chasing down the channels, always gambling on a ball coming his way, when it came marvellously from Beckham. Now within a dozen strikes of matching Charlton, Owen claimed one England mark at the Le Coq Arena: his 23rd competitive strike in 49 internationals broke Gary Linekers record. 

Buoyed by the excellence of Owen and Beckham, McClaren left the ground with his job secure but fingering a piece of paper, a print-out of group E. This showed that even with three goals and three points for the Three Lions, England remain fourth in the group. 

So as the sun sets on a torrid season, when his mistakes have elicited derision but his players have ultimately fought for him, McClarens thoughts will now turn to the challenge awaiting in the autumn. England have three ties at Wembley, entertaining Israel, Russia and Estonia, before travelling to Moscow and then hosting Croatia in November. 

Russias draw with Croatia in Zagreb on Wednesday night means that Slaven Bilics side has not disappeared over the horizon, so leaving a four-way fight for two places. England will need to keep showing patience, and a goal-scoring knack, to reach Austria and Switzerland.

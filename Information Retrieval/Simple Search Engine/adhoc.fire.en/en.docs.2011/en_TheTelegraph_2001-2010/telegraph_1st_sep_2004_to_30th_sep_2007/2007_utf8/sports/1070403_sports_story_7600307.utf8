 Bob case caught up in court chaos

Catherine Elsworth in Kingston

The inquiry into the death of Bob Woolmer is in danger of becoming mired in Jamaican bureaucracy, a system so plagued by inefficiencies that some cases dating back 10 years remain unresolved. 

With the islands coroners courts facing a backlog of almost 4,000 killings, a swift start to the inquest into the death of the Pakistan cricket coach, who police say was strangled, appears highly unlikely. 

Reporting on the gross inadequacies of Jamaicas justice system, the Caribbean islands Sunday Herald has claimed the backlog numbered killings that occurred up to 10 years ago, including a 1997 hit-and-run death and the case of a man shot dead by a Jamaican police officer in 1998. 

An inquest into the latter case was opened in 2000 but subsequently adjourned more than 20 times. 

The watchdog Jamaicans for Justice described the delays as horrific for the families concerned. 

The majority of outstanding cases are before the Kingston and St Andrews Coroners Court, where Woolmers inquest is to be held. The court has come under severe criticism for its seeming ineffectiveness. 

Woolmers inquest will be held by Patrick Murphy, the Kingston coroner, who, according to reports, has yet to even read the file on the coachs death. Dean Jones, a coroners assistant, said there had not been time to read it. 

The Jamaican police have yet to uncover any motive or suspects. Detectives say much hinges on the results of toxicology and blood tests, and CCTV footage of the hallway outside Woolmers 12th floor room at the Pegasus Hotel, Kingston, where he was found dead on March 18, a day after his teams World Cup defeat by Ireland. 

The lack of progress in the investigation has brought increasing pressure on the man heading the inquiry, Mark Shields, Jamaicas deputy police chief. 

His ex-boss in London has leapt to his defence, saying the former Scotland Yard detective was a very capable and experienced policeman. 

Everything that has been done sees to have been perfectly standard textbook procedure, said Tom Dickinson, a retired detective superintendent with the City of London Police. 

Dickinson also dismissed suggestions that the arrival of a team from Scotland Yard indicated that Mark is in any way mishandling the investigation into Woolmers death. 

The Metropolitan Police confirmed that a senior detective from Londons Homicide and Serious Crime command, two detectives and a crime scene officer are to review the investigation after a request from Jamaican authorities.

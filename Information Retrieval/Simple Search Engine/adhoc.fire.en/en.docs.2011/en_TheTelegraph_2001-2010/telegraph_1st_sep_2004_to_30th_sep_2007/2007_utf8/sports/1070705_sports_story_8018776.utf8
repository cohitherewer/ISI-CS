 Roger relaxes as rivals suffer water torture

Neil Harman

For Roger Federer, the past four days have been spent indulging in boats and fast cars. Yes, there has been a little grass-court practice to shake off the mothballs, but as the rest of the field has slogged on and off court, gentle ferment giving way to kick-the-cat rage, the Wimbledon champion has been urging his landlocked country to victory in sailings greatest race while fantasising about trying his hand as a presenter of Top Gear. 

Federer was invited by Alinghi, the Swiss syndicate who triumphed in the Americas Cup on Wednesday, to board their yacht when it was being put through its final paces in Dubai, where the world No 1 owns a holiday home. He is also a huge fan of Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond, the hosts of the BBC show, although one wonders if his views on Clarkson would change had the Swiss absorbed his recent reportage on Wimbledon crowds. 

Clarkson wrote: I often wonder what these sophisticated people from abroad are going to think of Britain when they see some hysterical fat woman with raspberry ripple arms and American tan tights, fanatically applauding a pigeon that has landed on Court One. Theyre going to think were all ugly and mad. 

It has been an ugly, mad eight days. Federer is a round ahead of everyone in the mens draw bar Juan Carlos Ferrero, whose reward for a straight-sets victory over Janko Tipsarevic to secure a place in his first Wimbledon quarter final is the match no one wants Federer on grass. 

And what of Rafael Nadal and Robin Sderling, who started their third-round match on Saturday afternoon and have spent four days locked, then unlocked, in frenetic combat. Nadal had a match point at 5.30 on Monday, missing the simplest of forehands. On Wednesday, the fourth day (Sunday was an off-day), the match resumed at 4-4 in the final set with the French Open champion wrapping it up 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (7), 4-6, 7-5 and no one can recall a match that has lasted so long. 

Ferrero has never treated grass with the disdain prevalent among his compatriots. That is all well and good, but then you see that Federer has dropped only one set to the Spaniard in their six most recent matches. How can it end any other way than prolonged Swiss success?

 Sania makes a winning return

 - MOROCCO OPEN 

New Delhi: Sania Mirza returned from an injury lay-off with a win. Sania, pairing up with American Vania King, won her first round doubles match in the $145,000 Morocco Open at Fes. 

The Indo-US pair came back from 4-7 down in the super tie-break to win 6-3, 5-7, 10-8 against Alla Kudryavtseva of Russia and Olga Savchuk of Ukraine on Tuesday. 

It was the 20-year-olds first competitive match in nearly two-and-half months. Its always good to win a match when youre coming back after so long, especially a close one, Sania said after the match. 

Sania, who had played with Liezel Huber of South Africa most of last season, said she combined well with Vania. 

I think its a good thing we got the toughest unseeded team first. Its for the first time we are playing together and we played well, she said, adding further: There were a few hiccups, but at the end of the day its good to come through. 

Talking about her knee, Sania said: It is holding up well. 

While I was playing today, I was thinking about how much Ive missed the feeling of competing, she said. 

At 9-8 in the tie-break it was my serve, and I just remembered how it felt to be on the court at tense moments like that with all the nerves And I am just so happy Im back. Ive missed the joy of winning, the joy of screaming come on after winning a point. 

Meanwhile, India-born American Neha Uberoi sailed into the second round after a convincing 6-2, 6-3 win over Romanian Sorana Cirstea on Tuesday. (PTI)

 Alvarita gets first call 

 HONKY DORY

 Mumbai: The stage is set for the weekends festival of racing. Nine-events will be held on Saturday and as many on the following afternoon, the Derby Day. 

 Needless to say that the sport is going to be competitive on each day. In Saturdays main attraction, the Breeders Produce Stakes over 1,400m, Alvarita gets the first call. The Deepak Khaitan-owned filly by Jade Robbery out of an Arabian mare, Shanley, seems to doing exceedingly well in her workouts, over longer sprints, since winning her debut run over a 1,000m scurry. 

 The Imtiaz Sait-trainee may, however, have to watch out for Lauban and Clairet, the two promising youngsters. Lauban is known to come with a late but threatening run while Clairet is expected to do better after faring poorly in her last run, which needs to be ignored. The in-form Czarina, also from trainer Imtiaz Saits yard, may be hard to toss in the 1,000m Peninsula Cup. The Glory Of Dancer daughter is unbeaten till date and she is expected to continue with the good work.

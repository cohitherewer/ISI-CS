 Pro League postponed 

 - AIFF may allow clubs to register 3 foreigners for state 

 leagues 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The inaugural Professional Football League, scheduled to kick off on September 30, will now start either in mid-October or November, according to the All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources. 

The federation, however, may allow the clubs to register three foreigners for the state leagues if the state associations put in such requests. 

In a meeting with representatives of the local organising committees here on Tuesday, AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco said the Pro League fixtures could only be finalised till the dates for Indias World Cup qualifiers against Lebanon are known. 

The AIFF has written to its Lebanon counterparts requesting an early dates for the home and away matches, said a federation official. If they agree to play in the first half of October, then the league could be started by October 15. It all depends on Lebanons response to our request. 

Lebanon, too, have quite a few problems. Other than the World Cup qualifiers, their players are also involved in Olympic qualifiers and AFC Club Cup matches in September-October. 

Given the tight schedules of both federations, it seems the AIFF may find it difficult to start the Pro League before November. In that case, both Bengal and Goa will have a golden opportunity to complete their local engagements before the commencement of the Pro League.

KEY FEATURES OF AIFF MEETING 

 Pro League unlikely to start before mid-October or November.

 AIFF sends request to Lebanon federation to play the World Cup qualifiers (home amp; away) by mid-October.

 Short camps for World Cup qualifiers likely.

 Clubs may be allowed to register three foreigners for state leagues.

 SAFF Cup and Durand Cup unlikely in December.

 Indians begin slowly

Loch Lomond (Scotland): It was a none-too-impressive beginning for the Indians as they were all way behind after the first rounds of play at the Barclays Scottish Open at the par-71 Loch Lomond Golf Course. 

Jyoti Randhawa (71) at even par was the best of the three with Jeev Milkha Singh carding one-over and Shiv Kapur two-over 73. 

Randhawa had three each of birdies and bogeys and was tied 63rd, while Jeev had two birdies and three bogeys for 96th and Kapur one birdie, one bogey and a double bogey at 128th. 

The early leaders were Soren Hansen and Phil Mickelson, both of whom brought in six-under 65 each. Also shooting a 65 was Graeme Storm. 

All three leaders started at the 10th. While Hansen and Storm were flawless, Mickelson had one bogey, but also made an eagle at the par-five 13th hole.

 Afridi, Yousuf not keen on Dav

Karachi: Dav Whatmore maybe the front-runner to take over as the next Pakistan coach but some of the senior players, including Shahid Afridi and Mohammed Yousuf, are apparently not too keen to work under the Australian. 

According to a source, the players are apprehensive about Whatmore who has established his reputation as a hard task master. 

Some of the players are not comfortable because of Whatmores reputation of being a no-nonsense person who is not afraid of taking on the players in his team on important issues, the source said. 

Former captain and ex-chief executive of the board Rameez Raja, meanwhile, said in an interview that he would like to see Richard Done get the job. (PTI)

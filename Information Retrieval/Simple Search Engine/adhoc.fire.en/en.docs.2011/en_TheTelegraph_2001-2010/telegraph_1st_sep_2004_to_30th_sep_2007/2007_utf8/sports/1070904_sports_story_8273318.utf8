 Case for a player challenge 

Mark Nicholas

 Players wait for the third umpires verdict 

It took 24 hours for the phone to ring. Twenty-four hours from writing last week that the use of technology for umpiring decisions should be restricted to line calls alone until both the technology and the referrals system were perfected. The call came from Martin Crowe in New Zealand, whose work as a television producer pays every bit as much attention to detail as his glorious batting used to do. 

Arent you being a bit simplistic? he began. I was leaning towards umpires having greater access to all technology, including Hawkeye, he said, but it was clearly and rightly pointed out by the International Cricket Council (ICC) that umpires would then refer to it for every decision, slowing the game down terribly. 

The solution must be to use technology via a player challenge system as in tennis. That way the worst umpiring gets policed and the best still stands, he added. 

Here is the rub. The key though is to offer all the best technology to the third umpire, not just the stuff available at the moment for the benefit of television viewers, and for a proper, transparent system of referrals to be in place to test it. Fair enough, I thought, but how? 

Crowe sits on the MCCs influential World Committee, which next meets after the World Twenty20 meet final. Along with Paul Hawkins, who invented Hawkeye, and Gary Franses, the producer of Channel 4 cricket who brought Hawkeye to our screens, he will present a paper on the use of technology in cricket. 

At the core of his proposal is a series of meetings with Hawkins about Hawkeyes predictive path the mysterious bit after the ball hits the pad which Crowe has long believed to be the flaw of an otherwise brilliant invention. When he ran Sky Televisions cricket coverage in New Zealand he refused to buy it because, in his view, it was neither consistent nor accurate. Now Hawkins is considering dropping the predictive path and developing the actual elements. This has so excited the ICC that a joint venture is being investigated. 

Understandably, the ICC would go into partnership with technology only if it was accurate, reliable, cost-effective and practical. And it would need Hawkeye to work in conjunction with a new player challenge system, one that had far more thought given to it than the experiment of referrals in County cricket this summer that has seen not one umpiring decision overturned. Frankly, any system of referrals without Hawkeye is doomed because the third umpires have so little to go on. 

As in this seasons Friends Provident Trophy, each team will have three challenges per innings. These will be exercised by the fielding captain or the batsman himself at the moment of the decision against him and without influence from the dressing room. If the on-field umpires decision stands, the team loses one of their challenges. All the captains, players and coaches will be fully briefed and walked through the process before its trial. 

Pressure point 

Most of us feel pressure from the outside though Sir Ian Botham is dismissive of this, saying that pressure makes kettles whistle and it increases the more we consider failure or letting others down. For some sportsmen, and for those actors who take to the stage, the fear of failure can be almost unbearable. This terrible fear has ruined many a talent. 

At a young age, when it became apparent to Sachin Tendulkar that he was to live his life within an extreme and often unreasonable spotlight, he decided to be his own critic. To be fair but also firm and to have an inner circle of friends and family to whom he could turn when he became uncertain. 

Thus, he reads little but listens keenly to the circle. He charts his own course, understanding that things, people, life all change but that they also stay the same. 

All of which is why he can bat as he did on Sunday and has done throughout the one-day series in the free-wheeling and free-spirited style of his untarnished youth. 

He might as well be a different person from the one who searched for the ball during the Test matches and then, on the occasions that he found it, rarely put it away with conviction and never with abandon. He was studious, timid even and frustrated by the shackles of time that overcame him. 

Sunday, Sachin set a tone of imperious control that even this Indian one-day team, at its profligate best, would not relinquish.

 Chauhan: Let an Indian do the job

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chetan Chauhan 

Dhaka: Just a couple of days after Mohsin Khan said hed prefer a desi coach for Pakistan, another one-time opener, Indias Chetan Chauhan, echoed that sentiment. 

Look, weve had two foreigners (John Wright, Greg Chappell) in succession, now lets have a change and let an Indian do the job, he told The Telegraph. 

Chauhan, who came here for the Afro-Asia Cup selection meeting, added: In my opinion, weve got four former players who can sit in the coachs chair... In no particular order, Ravi Shastri, Sandeep Patil, Mohinder Amarnath and Robin Singh... The Board should look at them... 

While calling for the appointment of a permanent (administrative) manager, he felt specialist bowling and fielding coaches spread the accountability. 

Let the coach seek the help of consultants, as and when necessary. Thats it, Chauhan signed off.

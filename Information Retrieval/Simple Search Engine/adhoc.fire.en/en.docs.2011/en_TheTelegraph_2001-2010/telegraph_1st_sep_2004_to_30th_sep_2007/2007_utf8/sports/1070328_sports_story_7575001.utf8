 Format led to India, Pak ouster: Ranatunga 

 Arjuna Ranatunga 

Colombo: The World Cup has been shorn of its fun by the early exit of crowd-pullers India and Pakistan, former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga said on Tuesday. 

Ranatunga, who had tipped India to win the showpiece event, said he was shocked to see the two former champions knocked out in the first round. 

I was shocked the way India played, especially against Bangladesh, said Ranatunga, who led Sri Lanka to World Cup glory in 1996. 

Guys like Sachin (Tendulkar), Sourav (Ganguly), Rahul (Dravid) and (Anil) Kumble will be disappointed as they might not play another World Cup. 

Ranatunga said the tournaments new format, which had 16 teams divided into four groups with the top two in each advancing to the second round, contributed to the ouster of 1983 champions India and 1992 winners Pakistan. 

The format was such that one bad game was enough to send a team out, he said. India had a bad day against Bangladesh while Pakistan were not at their best against Ireland. 

Earlier, teams had an opportunity to bounce back. For instance, Sri Lanka were beaten by Kenya in 2003 but still we went on to qualify for the semi-finals. 

In the previous World Cup where 14 teams were divided into two groups, we had six first round matches, but here its just three games. 

Ranatunga praised the Sri Lankan team, which cruised through with three straight wins against India, Bangladesh and Bermuda. 

The Sri Lankans have played smart cricket, he said. They have not only created opportunities but grabbed them as well. 

Theres enthusiasm in the squad. Look at Muttiah Muralidharan, hes 34 now, but his exuberance is the same as that of a 20-year-old. 

Ranatunga also said he hoped the murder of Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer would be solved soon. 

Bob was a great man, I had great respect and regard for him, he said. 

At the moment, people are pointing fingers at the betting mafia. I am surprised at the things the betting mafia can do to have their way. 

Officials and governments must take the initiative to safeguard the sport, but I wonder if the best efforts are being made to stop these people.

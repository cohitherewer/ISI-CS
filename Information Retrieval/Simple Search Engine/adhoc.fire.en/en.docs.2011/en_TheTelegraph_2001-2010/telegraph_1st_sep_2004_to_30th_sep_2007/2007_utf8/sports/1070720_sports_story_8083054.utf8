The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I am sure somebody will break my record

 - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 

 Ex-captain Vengsarkar looks back on his Lord's feat 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Dilip Vengsarkar

London: Sir Jack Hobbs and Michael Vaughan have had three Test hundreds in as many innings at Lords, but former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar is the only one to score a hundred in three consecutive appearances (1979, 1982, 1986). The 51-year-old chief selector, who played 116 Tests (6,868 runs, 17x100) and 129 ODIs (3,508 runs, 1x100), has been in England for some days and is going to remain with Team India through the Test series. He had a one-on-one with The Telegraph on Wednesday evening. 

The following are excerpts 

 On whether hes surprised 

 that his record of hundreds in three consecutive Tests at 

 Lords is intact 

Well, yes and no Yes, because records are meant to be broken and Im sure somebody will break my record At the same time, nowadays, you wont have a situation where one team tours England thrice in seven years For example, our last visit was in 2002 So, if you take an average career into account, the opportunities are somewhat less. 

On Lords as a venue 

Oh, its difficult to describe The aura is too much I had goose pimples while walking through the Long Room yesterday Everything about Lords is special and, believe me, Ive never walked on a better grass Its not another cricket ground and, when its a full house, the atmosphere is electric. 

On whether he was under pressure on his fourth appearance, in 1990 

Indeed, I was.. Everybody wanted me to score another hundred I got 52 and 35 In the first innings, Id certainly been looking to get a hundred Trying to flick, I got out to a long-hop from Angus Fraser I shouldnt have. 

On his first hundred at Lords (103 in the second innings, 1979) 

Id wanted to silence the critics whod felt I wouldnt succeed in England Many had written me off, saying my front-foot style of play wouldnt get me runs I got a duck in the first innings and, while walking out the second time, told myself I must get at least one run. I wouldnt, after all, like to be remembered as somebody who got a pair on his first Test appearance at Lords! That hundred helped us draw the Test (Gundappa Viswanath) Vishy also got a hundred and we had a significant partnership. 

On his second hundred (157 in the second innings, 1982) 

Having scored a mere 128 in the first innings, we were fighting a losing battle We were made to follow-on and had I continued, I could have helped save the Test I got out to a top-edge off Bob Willis Hed been bowling with the second new ball Actually, Id been looking good for a double The bigger regret, of course, is that I couldnt save the match 

On his third hundred (126 not out in the first innings, 1986) 

Remains very special as we won that Test and went on to win the series The openers (Sunil Gavaskar, Krishnamachari Srikkanth) went pretty early and Mohinder Amarnath and I had to put together a big partnership Later, Kiran More also played a hand The partnerships helped us take a (47-run) lead and that proved very handy Kapil (Dev) bowled brilliantly in the second innings. 

On what gave more satisfaction the hattrick of hundreds or the Test win 

The Test win A first at Lords Hopefully, we can do it again this time. 

On neither the legendary Gavaskar nor Sachin Tendulkar having a hundred at Lords 

(Grins) Sunil was a great batsman and Sachin is one Im sure not having had a hundred at Lords is at the back of his mind 

Finally, on tips for the present-day batters 

The wicket at Lords is a beauty and, once it has settled down, youve got to get a handsome score At the biggest venue, think big. 

Footnote: Vengsarkar, who is an honorary life member of the MCC, has one of his India blazers displayed in the Long Room. I donated it last year Id been thinking its in the Lords museum Hes not complaining, though.

 Cooley boost for Aussies

Melbourne: Australian bowling coach Troy Cooley will accompany the team to the World Cup in the West Indies to help its beleaguered bowlers get back to form. 

Australian bowling attack came under heavy criticism and was held largely responsible for their 0-3 loss to New Zealand in the Chappell-Hadlee series. The loss cost the world champions their coveted top spot in the one-day rankings. 

Cooley, who did not travel to New Zealand, confirmed that he will accompany the team for the World Cup. 

Originally I wasnt going to tour but I am now. In the original plans, no I wasnt going, but in light of proceedings in New Zealand its probably a smart move to be with the guys full-time and provide some input, Cooley was quoted as saying in Australian media. (PTI)

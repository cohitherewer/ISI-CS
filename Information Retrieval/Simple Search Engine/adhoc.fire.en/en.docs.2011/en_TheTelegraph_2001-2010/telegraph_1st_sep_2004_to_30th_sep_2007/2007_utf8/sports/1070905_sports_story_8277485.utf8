 ICCs turn to look for Yousuf

Karachi: Pakistan batsman Mohammed Yousuf appears to be the most in-demand, but hard to trace these days. 

After the Pakistan Cricket Board, the International Cricket Council is now trying desperately to contact him regarding his nomination in three categories of the ICC awards. 

PCB officials confirmed that the ICC had also failed to locate Yousuf as they need him to provide a personal message for a special brochure being published for the awards ceremony. 

He is not traceable again. The last time we were able to contact him was when the board chairman spoke to him on telephone and he promised to meet him on September 22 to discuss the Indian Cricket League issue, one official said. 

Yousuf has been nominated in three categories of the ICC awards after scoring a record breaking 1,788 runs in 11 Tests with nine hundreds in 2006.

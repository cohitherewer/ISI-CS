 Hamilton up there with Fangio: 

 Moss

 -Lewis is the same sort of person, very humble and 

 tremendously fast

The elderly, balding gentleman looks slightly incongruous playing on the games console in a dimly-lit room in central London: the antithesis of the Boy Racer, you might say. The steering wheel appears comfortable between his hands as he races, tyre perfect, around the Silverstone circuit shown on a giant screen in front of him. Perhaps, in his idle moments, he is dreaming of becoming the next Lewis Hamilton. 

In fact, he neednt bother: he is Sir Stirling Moss, the Lewis Hamilton of his day, more than half a century ago, and he knows every bump, turn and chicane at Silverstone better than any living man. 

Moss, who raced from 1948 to 1962, was a pioneer in the British Formula One racing scene and placed second in the Drivers Championship four times in a row from 1955 to 1958. He is often called the greatest driver never to win the World Championship. 

And he would have loved to have diced with Hamilton, 55 years his junior, at Silverstone. Oh, certainly, he says. When there is someone as good as that it is always nice to have a go at them. In the modern cars, at my age, I wouldnt think about it. But in the sort of cars I was driving, Id like to have a go at him, yes. 

As to who would have won the race between drivers who span Britains Grand Prix history, Moss is not so sure. Thats the big question, he admits. I dont know how you beat a guy whos as good as that, and doesnt make mistakes. You hope that you push them that hard that they make mistakes. And most people do. Michael (Schumacher) made lots, but so far Lewis hasnt. 

Moss, 77, is a fully paid-up member of the Lewis Hamilton Appreciation Society. Hes the best thing Ive ever seen, Moss says without a hint of hyperbole. Ive been connected with racing for nearly 60 years and theres never been anyone whos come in like that. Never. Not from being nowhere to leading the title. 

Its difficult to compare drivers of this era, when its quite safe, with the era of my time, when it wasnt safe, because its a different mental effect. But when one talks talent, I cant think of anybody who has shown that much talent. 

My all-time great was (Juan Manuel) Fangio, and one of the great things about Fangio, apart from his enormous ability, was the sort of man he was. And, I have to say, Lewis is the same sort of person: he is very humble; he is tremendously fast; he has great concentration. Lewis certainly has the qualifications to be up there with Fangio. 

With the retirement of seven-time world champion Schumacher last year, it seemed there would be a void in the Formula One hierarchy with no one to challenge Fernando Alonso, champion for the last two seasons. I thought it was going to be Kimi Raikkonen, Moss says. Kimi has disappointed a lot of people, including myself, because I dont think he is doing what he had the abilities to do. But thank goodness Lewis has come in. 

I must say Michael did a terrific job getting Ferrari back to where they belonged. But I never felt Michael was that great a driver. He has always been exceptionally good, but not a great, whereas Lewis has shown that he is a great driver already. 

He has done extraordinary things, and I think if Michael had been there, he (Hamilton) would have beaten him just as easily as he can beat anyone else. The one person who might have been nearest to him was probably (Ayrton) Senna. Like Senna, he gets in the car, takes it by the scruff of the neck and does what he wants to do. 

Senna enjoyed a memorable rivalry with Alain Prost nearly 20 years ago, and Moss believes Hamilton versus Alonso, his McLaren teammate, could be just as intense. Theres no doubt that until he arrived Alonso was the best, and I feel sorry for Fernando. After all, hed probably never heard of the guy until earlier in the year, and suddenly heres a man as great as Fangio and (Tazio) Nuvolari, beating him. 

Now Fernando is making mistakes, and he cant afford to make mistakes; hes got to up his game very considerably. Whether he has the ability to do that is, quite honestly, pretty doubtful. 

Hamilton is not so much breathing down Alonsos neck as skipping towards the finish line.

 A shot in the arm for world cricket

SIMON BRIGGS

 You can always tell when Indias cricket team is on a hot streak, because the Bollywood film stars roll into town. Delhi heartthrob Shah Rukh Khan led the celebrations on Monday night, after a Twenty20 campaign that could have been scripted with the cinema in mind. 

Just think of it: India, the country whose administrators had made every effort to smother Twenty20 cricket at birth, go on to win the inaugural world championship. More than that, they did it without any of the giants who have dominated the team for the past decade. 

Appointed captain of a young and much derided squad, Mahendra Singh Dhoni used negative media coverage as a spur. He livened up press conferences by quoting criticisms back at their perpetrators. Who was it who said Yuvraj Singh was a liability? he asked, after Yuvraj had just lashed six sixes in an over. I dont think we need to hear any more about that. 

Twenty20 cricket has its detractors, yet no one who watched Mondays final could have failed to enjoy the drama of the occasion. The past fortnight has done much to reinvigorate the sport around the world, and nowhere more so than in India and Pakistan Perhaps, as the nay-sayers suggest, some of them will turn out to be technically under-equipped for Test cricket. But they have shown the temperament to flourish in this ultra-pressurised form. 

The tournament will be remembered for a great final, but also as two weeks of grand entertainment. By the time England host the next World Twenty20 championship in two years time, we should have a better idea of how the upstart child will fit into crickets family. As in any normal family, its arrival has alarming implications for the older siblings especially when people like Allen Stanford, the Texan billionaire, start getting involved. 

Stanford is offering a 2.5million prize to the winners of a one-off match between the World Twenty20 champions and his own invitation West Indies side, to be played next spring. 

And then there is Indias Champions League concept, involving the best domestic Twenty20 teams from around the world, which is scheduled for October 2008 and also features a 2.5million purse. 

Money talks, Geoff Lawson, the Pakistan coach, said.

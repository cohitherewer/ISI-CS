 Pakistan duo to scout for ICL

Karachi: Two Pakistani cricketers have reportedly been entrusted with the job of roping in players for the Indian Cricket League (ICL). 

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), however, said it was not worried about any possible exodus of players signing up for the league which is not approved by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). 

Any possible move towards the ICL by players who will be awarded central contracts and those who are getting retainerships will be dealt on a case-to-case basis, Shafqat Nagmi, the CEO of the PCB said on Sunday. 

 Meanwhile, after insisting the Australian security delegations visit was a routine affair, the PCB now admits that it would be hard to convince them to play here in the wake of the Red Mosque operation in Islamabad. A four-member Aussie security delegation will arrive in Pakistan on Monday. (PTI)

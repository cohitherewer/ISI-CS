The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India may not 

 play 2nd division sides

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Portugal Tour

 New 

 Delhi: Contrary to All India Football Federations 

 (AIFF) initial claims, India are unlikely to play second 

 division league sides during their forthcoming tour of Portugal 

 later this year.

 While the AIFF said that India 

 will be playing at least two friendly matches 

 against Portuguese second division teams and one against 

 a top division side, Football and Friends promoters of 

 Indias first ever tour to Portugal have arranged 

 two matches against 3rd Division teams and a yet to be decided 

 friendly. 

 The Indian National team 

 will play against 3rd Division sides Atletico Clube Marinhense 

 and Recreio Desportivo de Agueda, besides a select team 

 from Vila Nova de Gaia and an I Liga club, Nuno Mousinho-Esteves, 

 a representative of Football and Friends told The Telegraph.

 The dates and venues for all the 

 friendlies, however, are yet to be finalised. We will 

 finalise the plan with coach Bob Houghton, Nuno disclosed.

 Zee Sports may telecast this match, 

 Nuno claimed.

 Back in Gurgaon, Indian footballers 

 had a rest day after one week of gruelling training. Chief 

 coach Bob Houghton has decided to take 25 footballers to 

 Portugal. Only two campers goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharya 

 and defender Sanjiv Maria are likely to stay behind because 

 of injury.

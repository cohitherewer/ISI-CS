 Pietersen doesnt want to lead now

Vicki Hodges

Kevin Pietersen has ruled himself out of the running to succeed Michael Vaughan as England one-day captain. The Hampshire batsman has said it is not the right time for him at this stage of his career, but will give full support to whoever is appointed in the role. 

Pietersen was thought to be among the frontrunners for the position, along with the favourite Paul Collingwood and Andrew Strauss, ahead of Fridays announcement. 

But the 26-year-old has made the decision easier for Englands selectors by withdrawing from the frame. 

Pietersen, who informed coach Peter Moores of his decision, said: At this stage of my career, I dont think it is the right time for me. I thought about it long and hard, but right now I am happy playing and supporting the team like that. 

I would be humbled in the future to be given the opportunity to captain my country, but now I dont think is the right time for me. 

Whoever gets the job will get my full support. It is a new era with a new coaching staff and a good time for England to move forward. 

Pietersen believes the new one-day captain will have a tough job turning around Englands fortunes in the limited overs game. 

He added: Ever since I have been playing in one-dayers, for almost the last three years, we have not won too many trophies. The one-day scene has been neglected. But we have to turn that around now because the World Cup wasnt the best of months for us.

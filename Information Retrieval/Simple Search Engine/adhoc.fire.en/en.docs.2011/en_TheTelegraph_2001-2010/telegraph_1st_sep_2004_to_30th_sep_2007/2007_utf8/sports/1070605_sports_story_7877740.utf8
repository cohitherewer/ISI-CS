 Uefa slams Liverpools rowdy fans

FRANK PRAVERMAN and Agencies

Uefa have blamed Liverpool supporters for 25 incidents over the past four years. 

A report to be presented to Richard Caborn, the sports minister on Tuesday, has branded Liverpool supporters the worst in Europe. 

The leaked Uefa document was compiled by undercover police over the last four years and states there have been more incidents involving Liverpool fans than anyone else. 

The incidents involving Liverpool fans have been well known to us before the trouble at the Champions League final which involved Liverpool fans last week, William Gaillard, the Uefa spokesman, said. 

 That was just the latest example. What other set of fans steal tickets from their fellow supporters or out of the hands of children? 

We know what happened in Athens, and Liverpool fans were the cause of most of the trouble there, he said.

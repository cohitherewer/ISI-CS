 Do-or-die battle for India

Belfast: Grappling with a cold bug and struggling to stay afloat in the three-match series, a depleted India face a do-or-die battle when they meet South Africa in the crucial second one-dayer here on Friday. 

Paceman Sreesanth was on Thursday ruled out of the match. The Kerala bowler will sit out for the second successive game, while there is also a question mark on the availability of Gautam Gambhir who is down with fever. 

Sreesanth has not recovered as yet and will miss Fridays game, captain Rahul Dravid said. 

With a flu virus reducing the dressing room virtually to a medical ward, India struggled to find 11 fit men in the first one dayer and the think-tank was forced to field two spinners Ramesh Powar and Piyush Chawla. 

The Indians, however, have something to cheer about on Thursday with wicketkeeper-batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who has sat out all the matches so far, expected to take the field in the crucial tie. 

Heavy rain meant that the Indian team could not have an outdoor practice session at Stormont on Thursday afternoon and instead had to hit the gymnasium. 

Dravid is looking for an improvement in both departments of the game. 

We could have batted better at the death and could have bowled better in the middle overs, he said. 

He, however, said only a captains knock from Jacques Kallis denied the Indians a victory.We probably missed an extra seamer in the last game. I thought we gave away too many runs in the first 20 overs. Hopefully, well have the right balance for tomorrows game, the skipper said. 

Despite being up 1-0 in the three-match series, Kallis refuses to be complacent and the seasoned campaigner said he was expecting an Indian backlash. Its definitely an advantage to go one-up in the series. But you have two more matches to go and I think its going to be interesting, he said.

 Dont write us off: Woolmer

Karachi: Coach Bob Woolmer on Thursday said his team may be badly hit by injuries ahead of next months World Cup, but those writing off Pakistan are making a big mistake. 

I dont think we have performed that badly in South Africa. We had our chances despite a depleted bowling attack but we couldnt capitalise on them. It will be a mistake to write us off, Woolmer said. 

Pakistans World Cup campaign after losing the Test and one-day series in South Africa has been thrown into jeopardy with fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Asif and Umar Gul still plagued by injuries. 

It is like we have burnt our boats and have to just play to the best of our abilities with the available team, said Woolmer, who took charge of preparations after returning from South Africa. Woolmer said he would meet Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) officials and doctors to find out the exact position of the fast bowlers but would not like to take risk with any injured player. 

Obviously, we would like to have the first-string bowling attack at our disposal. We have a conditioning camp and time before the World Cup to get our bowlers in top shape, he added. 

The Pakistan coach said the quadrennial showpiece is wide open this time and there are no clear favourites. Australia were clear favourites in the last World Cup in 2003, but this time the World Cup would be more close and evenly contested, he said. (PTI)

 IN THE CITY

 The derby clash between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan on February 27 may end up being staged in a neutral venue because of lack of security personnel here. Police said that there wont be adequate staff on that day so we are still in a dilemma. We may have to shift the match to one of the neutral venues, a source in IFA said. However, there are only three neutral venues Delhi, Gurgaon and Calicut at the moment. According to the IFA, they have already informed the All India Football Federation for necessary arrangements.

 Cup may be Kumbles last ODI meet

New Delhi: Anil Kumble has said the World Cup would probably be his last one-day tournament and that would be an added incentive for him to do well. Crickets showpiece event begins in the Caribbean on March 13. 

Kumble also defended himself against the criticism of his fielding ability, saying he could not suddenly become a Jonty Rhodes. 

It will probably be my last one-day meet and it will be challenging. I hope Ill be able to play a much bigger role this time, Kumble said in a TV interview. 

The World Cup is a tournament everyone looks up to. The last World Cup was good for India, we played really well as a team. We have a very good chance of winning the title. 

The 36-year-old Bangalorean has bagged 28 wickets in 17 World Cup matches. He is Indias leading wicket-taker in both forms of the game 334 scalps in ODIs and 547 in Tests. 

Irked by questions about his current form, Kumble said: It is unfair to judge performance spread over three matches on good batting surfaces. 

You cannot always get three-four wickets in a match. The main purpose is to restrict runs. I have the experience and hence am not worried. 

The veteran spinner didnt think fielding is a weak area for him or the rest of the Indian team. 

You can only do what you can as a fielder. We are all safe on the field. Im not the most athletic. I have been like that ever since I started. I cant change suddenly and become a Jonty Rho- des. 

I always put in a hundred per cent. As a unit, we have worked hard and fielded well, said Kumble.

 Hamish Marshall to play today

Georgetown: Brian Lara will be hoping West Indies overcome the effects of defeat and fatigue very quickly when they take on New Zealand in a World Cup Super Eight match on Thursday. 

The hosts will be taking centre stage at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium for a third day in a row after their opening second-stage match, against defending champions Australia, was carried over into the reserve day because of rain. 

Although West Indies were only required to bat on Wednesday, the match would have taken its toll, especially since they slumped to a 103-run defeat after being bowled out for 219. 

A relaxed New Zealand side, who prepared routinely without the stresses of match action, would be ready to exploit any signs of weakness in their dejected opponents. 

While the Kiwis will be keen to preserve their 100 per cent record at the tournament, Laras men will want to ensure they do not drop any more points if they are to stay in the race for one of the semi-final spots. 

For New Zealand, Hamish Marshall will bat at No. 3 due to a top-order revamp forced by injury. 

Peter Fulton is expected to open the innings with skipper Stephen Fleming after Lou Vincent (broken wrist) and Ross Taylor (hamstring strain) were forced out. 

Marshall flew in on Tuesday after Vincent was forced to return home having been hit by pacer Shane Bond during nets. 

New Zealand topped group C ahead of England despite a series of injuries. Pacer Daryl Tuffey has also been ruled out with a bicep injury and has been replaced by Chris Martin. 

It has been a very dramatic week, Fleming said on Tuesday. Obviously Lous not playing and having Hamish back changes the balance of the side. I guess the best thing is the bowlers are still intact. They are the usual suspects.

 to go by, with the Caribbeans wining 23 of the 45 ODI clashes so far. While

 the Black Caps have won 17 times, five games have ended in no-result. However,

 in what may be termed as a telling statistic, the New Zealanders have won

 seven of their last 10 encounters, with the West Indies winning just one

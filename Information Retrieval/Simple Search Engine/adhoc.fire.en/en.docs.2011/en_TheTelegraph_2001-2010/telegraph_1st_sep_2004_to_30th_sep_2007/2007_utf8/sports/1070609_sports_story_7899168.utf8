 Justine out to douse Ana fire

 Henin 

Paris: Justine Henin plans to douse the youthful exuberance of Serbias Ana Ivanovic and rekindle an old love affair in the final of the French Open on Saturday. 

The Belgian has sought solace on tennis courts around the world ever since her marriage to Pierre-Yves Hardenne broke down at the turn of the year, and nowhere does she feel more at home than on the Philippe Chatrier Court. 

It was the stage of her first Grand Slam triumph in 2003, and with successes in 2005 and 2006, she will be the favourite to overcome a teenager contesting her maiden major final. 

A Grand Slam final is a very special match and I have far more fun being on the court than in the past. Im just enjoying every moment of it. Id like to get the reward for all the effort Ive put into this tournament, she said. 

Although the French Open was the only major she captured in 2006, if she beats Ivanovic she will become only the second woman in the professional era to win a hattrick of titles at Roland Garros. 

The only other woman to have achieved the feat was Monica Seles, who inspired Ivanovic to pick up a tennis racket. Seles won the French Open from 1990-92 playing under the Yugoslav flag, but was born a Serb. 

I started playing because of Monica. She was the woman I always looked up to, said 19-year-old Ivanovic. 

Growing up in war-torn Serbia, Ivanovic has come a long way from starting out her training in a drained swimming pool. It was very expensive to keep it warm during the winter, and there were not many people using it, Ivanovic said. 

Ivanovic has faced Henin only once, losing in straight sets at Warsaw in 2005. But Henin knows better than to take the youngster lightly.

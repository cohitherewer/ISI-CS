 Hick crosses 40,000 mark

Birmingham: Graeme Hick became the 16th player to pass 40,000-run mark in first-class cricket Sunday, and the first since Graham Gooch 13 years ago. 

The Zimbabwe-born batsman, who played 65 Tests for England, hit 49 for Worcestershire against Warwickshire at Edgbaston to reach the landmark in his 841st innings. 

The 41-year-old Hick has been playing in for Worcestershire since 1983 and, despite his failure to make an impact in Tests, passed numerous domestic landmarks throughout his career. 

Before his highest score of 405 against Somerset in 1988, he became the youngest player to reach 2,000 runs in a season in 86. (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Countdown to crickets biggest show

 Kapil Dev with the World Cup 

1983

It could easily have been a big party for two-time

 champions West Indies, but for the Indians who spoilt their plans in the Summer

 of 83 at Lords. The third edition was full of surprises. First it was India who beat the then world champions in the preliminary stage, then first timers Zimbabwe upset Australia, and finally the icing on the cake was the biggest surprises of all, when India stopped the West Indies juggernaut to be crowned as the world champions at Lords. 

With Sri Lanka being a Test playing nation by then, the remaining spot was filled up by Zimbabwe who qualified through the ICC Trophy. Their side included several players with first-class experience. Apart from beating Australia, Zimbabwe gave the West Indies a scare at Worcester. 

This time around, each team got to play two matches against each of the teams in its pool. India were grouped with the West Indies, Australia and Zimbabwe in Group B, while England, Pakistan, New Zealand and Sri Lanka formed Group A. For India, the unexpected success came under a young and a new captain Kapil Dev who fired along with two other allrounders Roger Binny and Mohinder Amarnath to pull India out of any critical situation. 

Opening their campaign against the West Indies, India stunned the critics with a 34-run victory, set up by an 89 from Yashpal Sharma. India totalled 262 in 60 overs before winding up the West Indies for 228, thanks to a quick three wickets from Ravi Shastri. A confident India then chased Zimbabwes 156 with 23 overs and five wickets to spare. Madanlal was the wrecker-in-chief with his three wickets. Their joy however was short-lived as India were dealt out a 162-run thrashing by Australia two days later. India collapsed to 158 attempting to climb Australias Mt 320. 

 Their miseries compounded in the second-half of the group stage. The world champions avenged their first round defeat with a 66-run win. Vivian Richards 119 propelled the West Indies total to 282 in 60 overs, a score that India failed to chase despite Mohinder Amarnaths 80 from 139 balls. However, what followed from thereon heralded a new beginning in Indian cricket. 

 With two more matches to go (against Zimbabwe and Australia), India needed two wins on the trot for a semi-final berth. And they did it in style. Especially the one against Zimbabwe will be remembered as one of the greats in the history of the game. 

 Against Zimbabwe, India were precariously placed at nine for four when Kapil came in to bat. Minutes later they were 17 for five. A defeat could have ended Indias Cup dreams. But Kapil turned the tide in Indias favour with a unparalleled 175 not out (and a 126-run ninth wicket partnership with Syed Kirmani). Kapils immaculate innings included 16 fours and six sixes. India scored 266 for eight and in reply, Zimbabwe batsmen were cut to size by Kapil and Madanlal who took four wickets between them. India went on to win by 31 runs. 

 Ironically, the memorable Kapil Dev innings at Tunbridge Wells, though got into the record books, could not be watched by fans back home. They had to content themselves with only the semi-finals and final shown live on Doordarshan. 

 The marauding Indians made light work of Australia in their last group match winning by 118 runs thanks to four-wicket hauls by Madanlal and Roger Binny. India evicted the inventors of the game, England, in their semi-final with a six-wicket win. Yashpal Sharma and Sandeep Patil hit fifties, while Kapil Dev picked up three for 35 to seal the victory. The West Indies, in the other semi-final strutted on, brushing aside Pakistan by eight wickets with more than 11 overs to go. 

The final was an anti-climax. Favourites, the West Indies, skittled India out for 183 and were cruising on for yet another victory at 57 for two. After Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes, Vivian Richards started ominously, and fans who were watching it live on Doordarshan lost all hope and began to wander away. However, Kapil again brought on the turnaround when he brilliantly caught Richards at mid-wicket off Madanlal. They were 66 for five and it soon became 76 for six before being bundled out for 140. 

In the low-scoring encounter, the performers for India were Mohinder Amarnath (three for 12 and 26) and Krishnamachari Srikkanth (top scorer with 38). And, India lifted the Prudential Cup, with a 43-run win on June 25, 1983. The win was worth 20,000 pounds for India. It was a dawn of a new era. 

The West Indies were no more the champions, and as it turned out, the fourth edition in 1987 too moved out of England, to be co-hosted by India and Pakistan.

 BCCI plans cash bonanza

Mumbai: The BCCIs finance committee has recommended a substantial increase in match fees for domestic cricketers on the back of a net profit of Rs 231.64 crore during the last fiscal. 

The panel met Sunday under the chairmanship of Sudhir Nanavati. This cant be a coincidence, obviously its linked to so many signing up by the ICL. 

The committee has recommended that the upfront payment to domestic cricketers be increased from Rs 4,000 to Rs 10,000 per day. But the final approval will have to be given by the general body, sources said. 

As to the calculations arrived at by the committee, domestic cricketers, who are entitled to just over 10.4 per cent of the BCCIs gross revenue, would get Rs 25,000 as match fees per day for the recently-concluded season out of which they have already received Rs 4,000. 

The recommended match fees per day for the forthcoming domestic season as per the finance committees projected gross revenue for the current fiscal works out to Rs 35,000 per day, according to the sources. 

If a player takes part in all the Ranji Trophy matches till the final in the coming season he will take home Rs 14 lakh in match fees. The least that a player who plays all matches in the league stage (Elite division) will get, in Ranji Trophy, is Rs 10 lakh. 

Players who take part in Duleep, Deodhar and Challenger Trophies would also be entitled to the recommended Rs 35,000 per day for the coming season.

 Lukewarm interest

Ludhiana: A Mohun Bagan-versus-East Bengal match being played in empty stands is an unlikely sight in Indian football. Come Tuesday, the Federation Cup semi-final between the arch-rivals in Ludhiana may turn this into reality. 

The countrys No. 1 knockout tournament at the Guru Nanak Stadium has miserably failed to attract crowds. 

Sundays quarter final match between East Bengal and JCT saw the biggest turnout so far, though the estimated figure didnt cross 2,500 in the 25000-capacity stadium. 

It could be worse on Tuesday as the local side, JCT, have made the exit. Spectators participation in the tournament is likely to go down further with JCTs ouster, said a visibly worried member of the organising committee. 

I cant imagine that a Mohun Bagan-East Bengal match is being played in front of empty galleries, said Mohun Bagan assistant coach Satyajit Chatterjee. 

Chatterjee, a former Mohun Bagan footballer, had the experience of playing in Mohun Bagan-East Bengal outings in different cities in India. In every venue, according to him, there were sizeable crowds. 

During my playing days, the two teams met regularly in Delhi and Mumbai. There used to be big crowds always.

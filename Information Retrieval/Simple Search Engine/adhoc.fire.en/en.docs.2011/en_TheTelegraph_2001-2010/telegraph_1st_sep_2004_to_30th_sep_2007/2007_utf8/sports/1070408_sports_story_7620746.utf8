 We still have a chance: Bradshaw 

La Sagesse: The West Indies bowler Ian Bradshaw believes his team can play near perfect cricket and still become the first host nation to win the World Cup despite losing their three Super Eight games so far. 

Second-stage defeats to Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka have left the Caribbean side facing possible elimination from the competition if they fail to beat South Africa on Tuesday. 

It is pretty straightforward for us from here on in we have to try and win each game and win as convincingly as possible, Bradshaw said after Fridays practice. 

Now we must improve each and every aspect of our game and leave nothing to chance. We have to play near perfect games from here on in. 

If we work hard we can get out from the Super Eight then we are confident that we can play two good games, in the semi-final and the final, to win the Cup. 

We still have dreams of lifting the Cup on the 28th, it is not beyond us but first and foremost we have to take care of these three games, said the left-arm seamer. 

The West Indies side have come in for some strong criticism from ex-players and the local media and Bradshaw said the players had taken note of the reaction. 

You are conscious of it. Family, friends and the fans are disappointed because they are looking for more from the team and we ourselves are really disappointed because we started well and just fell off in the last three games, which were unfortunately critical games for us. 

That has put us in the situation where we have to win the last three games and have other results turn our way.

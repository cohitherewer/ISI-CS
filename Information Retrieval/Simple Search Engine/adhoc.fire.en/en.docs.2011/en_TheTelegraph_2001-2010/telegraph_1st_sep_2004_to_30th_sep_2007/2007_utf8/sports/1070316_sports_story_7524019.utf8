 ICCs English norm for 

Pak players

Kingston: The ICC has asked the Pakistan team management to ensure that the players speak in English during all media events inside the playing field. 

However, during media events outside the playing field, the players can speak in the language of their choice, the ICC clarified on Thursday, denying an earlier agency report that Pakistan have been asked to avoid holding press conferences in Urdu. 

At no point of time did the ICC say it wont allow Pakistan team management to hold press conferences in Urdu. The ICC does not tell the participating teams which language they have to speak in press conferences, an ICC spokesperson said. 

The issue of Pakistan players speaking in Urdu during the presentation ceremony was discussed with PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf in Kingston. 

He (Ashraf) agreed with the ICC that for all media events inside the playing field, Pakistan players will talk in English, while for all media events off it, they will converse in Urdu, he said. 

Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq was unhappy when the media manager decided last week that the players would address the news conferences in Urdu and he would translate it in English. 

Inzamam felt the timing of the decision was wrong and didnt reflect well on the players. 

Meanwhile, the source also said the players were unhappy that the board had not accepted their request of sending a Pakistani cook to the West Indies where they are facing a lot of dietary problems.

 A set batsman has to go on: Dravid

Montego Bay: Team India captain Rahul Dravid believes crucial World Cup games could be decided on how one settled batsman performs if pitches played slow in the Caribbean. 

Dravid took the lead on Tuesday by top-scoring with 74 to lead his teams 182-run rout of minnows Netherlands after electing to bat on a pitch with early life and seam movement. 

Sachin Tendulkar weighed in with a fluent 61 and the experienced duo put on 116 runs for the fourth wicket to help reach 300 for nine. The Dutch were all out for 118. 

We spoke about this game and wanted to be as clinical and professional as possible, he told reporters. We did that. 

We decided to rest Ajit Agarkar and Zaheer Khan, our frontline bowlers, just to give a bit of a bowl to others. 

Occasional left-arm bowler Yuvraj Singh took four for 12 to boost Dravids options for a fifth bowler. 

Dravid said slow pitches could mean teams will have to revise their batting plans. 

The wickets will remain a bit slow, he said. In tighter and closer games, the one batsman who gets set on these wickets will have to go on. It is not going to be easy for a new batsman to come in and rotate the strike easily. In this tournament we will see (only) one or two big scores in each innings. 

He felt conditions could be the same in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad where India play their group B matches against Bangladesh, debutants Bermuda and 1996 winners Sri Lanka. 

Trinidad cant be very different from this, he said. We just have to be flexible and play according to the game. 

Dravid also hinted that he could try out Yuvraj and Dhoni up the order in the final practice game against the West Indies. 

Sachin and I used up a few overs so we could promote Yuvraj and Dhoni. My position in the team is that of a floater who could bring himself up or down depending on the situation. 

Dravid revealed that he had deliberately opted to bat first on a damp and slow wicket as he sensed there would be moments in the tournament when his side could find themselves in a similar situation. 

The wicket was damp and slow and we wanted to test ourselves. But as I said, somebody who is set has to go on, he said. 

Dravid was happy with Virender Sehwags performance. 

We had a good opening partnership, Sourav and Sehwag are fairly experienced Sehwag has been playing well recently, in the last one-day International against Sri Lanka and in the first practice game here, Dravid said. 

Dutch captain Luuk van Troost praised allrounder Ryan ten Doeschate for claiming five wickets but bemoaned the inability to try to chase the big total or last 50 overs. 

Our gameplan was to chase 300, he said. We adjusted our goal, to bat 50 overs, because in the last World Cup in most matches we didnt do that. Im very disappointed that didnt work out. (Agencies)

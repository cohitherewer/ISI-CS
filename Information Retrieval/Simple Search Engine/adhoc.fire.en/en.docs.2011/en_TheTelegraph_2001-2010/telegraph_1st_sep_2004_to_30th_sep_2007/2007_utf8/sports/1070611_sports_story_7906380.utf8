 Im sad for Roger, says Nadal

Paris: No nerves, no doubt, no messing with Rafael Nadal on clay. 

Even Roger Federer, the world No. 1, had to admit it after having lost to the King of clay yet again. 

Rafael is tough on break points. Its one thing to create chances but you have to convert them. I came back in the second set but had a bad start in the third set that killed it for me. Rafael played an excellent match and deserved to win, said Federer at the post-match press conference on Sunday. 

Nevertheless, the Swiss was down but not out. 

Of course, Im a little upset. The doors still open, though. The later it comes, the sweeter it will be. I know I can do it now, thats for sure. Ive played very good French Opens, but Rafa came along and swept them all. 

Analysing the match, Federer said: It was a very physical match from the start more physical than mental. The sets were long and I was ready for it, but I missed too many opportunities. I couldnt really impose my game, make the game happen with my forehand. It was just disappointing I couldnt turn it around. 

However he did not take away any credit from Nadal, who earned his third Roland Garros title in a row after saving 16 of 17 break points to settle the issue at 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. 

Congratulations Rafael, once again. I missed too many opportunities, but I hung tough. I tried and I came up short. Ill fare better next time. Id like to thank the crowd and all the fans that came from Switzerland to support me. 

For Nadal, it was a dream come true. To win here for a third time is a dream come true and I have only positive things to say about the tournament. 

While losing serve only once, Nadal broke four times in 10 chances. He had 27 unforced errors to 59 for Federer. 

Rooting for history, the crowd was pro-Federer and occasionally chanted Ro-ger! Ro-ger! But when Federers final shot landed long, fans roared for Nadal as he collapsed on his back to the clay in jubilation. 

 I am very happy, he 

 said during the presentation ceremony. But I am really 

 sad for Roger. He is a friend and I know he is a great champion, 

 whether he wins or loses.

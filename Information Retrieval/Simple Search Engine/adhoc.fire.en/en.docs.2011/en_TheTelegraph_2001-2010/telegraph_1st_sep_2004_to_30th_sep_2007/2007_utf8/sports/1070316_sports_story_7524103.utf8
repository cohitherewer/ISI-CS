The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Im prepared to work harder, says Dwayne

Kingston: Dwayne Smith repaid the West Indies selectors faith in him when he starred with bat and ball to inspire his side to victory over Pakistan in their World Cup opener. 

When the West Indies 15-man squad was announced last month, there were strong objections throughout the Caribbean even in Smiths native Barbados to his inclusion, and his selection also seemed to have caused ripples in the selection room. 

Gordon Greenidge, the legendary former West Indies opener, now convenor of selectors, openly stated that he was not convinced that Smith had earned the right to take part in crickets showpiece. 

However, head coach Bennett King disagreed and he strongly tipped the vote in Smiths favour when he challenged his fellow selectors to identify a player similarly gifted, who could blast late runs, bowl a mean, steady, but penetrative medium pace, and move around the field like a cat. 

King got his way and his confidence was justified when Smiths allround performance earned him the Man-of-the-Match award and gave West Indies the perfect start to the first World Cup on Caribbean soil. 

Im always confident of myself and I dont worry too much about what people say, said the 23-year-old. I just go out there and do my job, and do it to the best of my ability. 

Smith slugged a vital 32 off 15 balls to lead a late batting charge that beefed up the West Indies total to a workable 241 for nine off 50 overs in Tuesdays Sabina Park opener. 

Although I have been pushed lower and lower in the batting order, it has not really affected my confidence, he said. It has just made me realise that I have to work harder and harder in the nets, and that is what I am prepared to do.

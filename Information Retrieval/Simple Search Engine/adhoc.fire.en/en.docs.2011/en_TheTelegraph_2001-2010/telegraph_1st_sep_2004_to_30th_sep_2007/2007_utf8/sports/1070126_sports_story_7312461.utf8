 Lara dreams of India, WI final

 World Cup 

Chennai: Brian Lara on Thursday said an India-West Indies title showdown at the World Cup would be a delight for the fans of the two nations. 

One cannot expect a better finale than one with India and the West Indies. It becomes all the more special since over 50 per cent of the people in the Carribean Islands are Indians, the West Indies captain said during an interactive session here. 

India and the West Indies have been playing so much cricket for the past 8-10 months, it is very likely that both teams will reach the finals of the World Cup to be held in my country, Lara said. 

To play against India is tremendous, he added. 

Lara, who was out of action in the Cuttack one-dayer owing to an injury, said he hoped to play in the third match at Chennai. 

I am still sore in the left knee but I hope to get better within the next 24 hours. I will hopefully play on Saturday, the West Indian captain said. 

The final decision though, will be takes prior to the toss. 

Showering encomiums on Sachin Tendulkar, Lara said he shared a very cordial relationship with him and it was wonderful to have a friend like him. 

Sachin and I are very happy in each others company and we share a lot of views on cricket whenever we get together. It is very good to talk to an extremely talented cricketer who has billions of people behind his back, pressurising him to perform well, Lara said. 

For him, Sachin is an icon and an inspiration and he hoped to extend their friendship past the boundary too. 

On the present series, Lara said these matches would help them choose the list of 15 for the World Cup. 

Lots of young people, all either in their early twenties or even less, are getting a chance to play. 

This will help pick the best West Indian team for the World Cup, he said. 

Lara, who has donned the captaincy mantle for the third time, said the team has a lot of scope for improvement.

 Sreesanth aims to play a big role 

 Port of Spain: Pace bowler Sreesanth dreamt of representing India in a World Cup from the moment he saw his national team turn out for the final four years ago. 

Sreesanth was playing in the domestic Ranji Trophy when India lost to Australia in the 2003 World Cup final in Johannesburg. He hoped things would be different four years on, and aspired to be in the Indian side for the next World Cup. 

Now the 23-year-old Sreesanth made his international debut in 2005 and saw part of his dream came true when he was included in Indias 15-member World Cup squad. 

 In 2003, I saw the final on a big screen with my state teammates and everyone was screaming in support of the national team, he added. I wish India had won, they had a great chance... anything can happen this time. 

Hopefully well win the World Cup this time and I will be part of it, were all very optimistic, Sreesanth said. 

I have set a goal for myself and I am sure its going to help the team. I have been working on it and Im sure I will play a big role in the World Cup, said a confident Sreesanth. 

The Kerala speedsters propensity to bowl a fuller length serves him well in Tests but the same ploy is not working in one-dayers where the batsmen are tonking him over the head of a restricted field. 

The pacer, however, believes that of late he has got a solution and the results are very encouraging. 

One of the things I did to get my length right was to bowl from within the crease in the last couple of one-dayers in India, as well in the practice games here. I think its working fine, he said. 

Sreesanth admitted it would be quite hard work for the bowlers trying to bowl the perfect length on slow Caribbean wickets. 

I was lucky to play in all the games here last year. What I learnt is that you have to be really patient on the slow wickets here. You shouldnt really try to get wickets, but wait for the wickets to come your way, Sreesanth said. 

The grounds are small and wickets are really slow, so you have to work doubly hard as a fast bowler, he said. 

More than bowling fast, you have to use your common sense and play with your brains, you will do well, he added. 

Sreesanth also acknowledged the enormous help which Sourav Ganguly passes on to him in his quest to become a better fast bowler. 

Dada has been more of an allrounder, so he knows exactly what a bowler should be doing. He tells Zaheer if I had your pace, trust me, I would have got many more wickets. 

Seniors like Zaheer and Ajit Agarkar keep helping us, even at the nets. When you really go off at the nets, they come and talk to you. Not just the bowler, Sachin Paaji and Rahul Bhai too offer valuable advice, said Sreesanth. (Agencies)

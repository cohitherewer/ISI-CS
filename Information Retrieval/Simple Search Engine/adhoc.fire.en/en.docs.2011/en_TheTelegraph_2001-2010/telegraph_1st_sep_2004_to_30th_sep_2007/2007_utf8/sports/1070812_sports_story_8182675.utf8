 Jeev, Chopra miss cut

Tulsa: Jeev Milkha Singh ended the day at four-over 74 to crash out of the PGA Championship on Friday. 

Jeev began well with two birdies in his first three holes, but then made a series of mistakes that took his tally to 10-over 150. He failed to make the cut. Jeev has now missed the cut for a second major in a row. 

Also missing the cut was Daniel Chopra, who added a 73 to his first round 76 and finished at nine-over 149. 

K.J. Choi added a second straight one-over-par 71 for a tied 19th spot. His two-day total of 142 left him eight shots behind leader Woods, the world No.1.

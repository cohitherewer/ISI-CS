 Indian driver may make cut

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: An Indians participation in the Production World Rally Championship (PWRC) may soon be a reality, according to information received here. 

After two days of rigorous testing at the Subaru World Rally Team (SWRT) facility in Banbury and Wales under different conditions recently, chances of Coimbatore-based Indian champion driver Naren Kumar competing in the PWRC looked high. 

Naren Kumar, who went through a number of physical and reflex tests, was put through the paces by Geoff Jones, former British Rally driver and chief evaluator for SWRT. 

Geoff had high praise for Naren Kumar. I think Naren is capable of a top five finish in the PWRC, he added.

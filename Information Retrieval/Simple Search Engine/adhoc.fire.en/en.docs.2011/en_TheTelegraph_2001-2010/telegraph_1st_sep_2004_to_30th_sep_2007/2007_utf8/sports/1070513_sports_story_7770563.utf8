The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Indians a little better than us: Whatmore

 - Were looking at 3-0, says Shastri 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Dhaka: The Bangladeshis have won few points on the field, but that didnt stop outgoing coach Dav Whatmore from needling the team he could soon be coaching. 

Indias a little better team than us... Weve got the ability to scare, he commented with a straight-face, shortly after Rahul Dravids men took an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the ODIs. 

For cricket manager Ravi Shastri, though, it was a bit too much. What? Has Whatmore said that? Well, ask him after the third (and final) match, he countered during an interaction with the media after Saturdays face-off. 

Chittagong hosts the last ODI on Tuesday. 

Shastri added: Bangladeshs best chance was in the first ODI... They wont get another opportunity... Weve come here to show no mercy... Take no prisoners... Were looking at 3-0... 

One doesnt wish to belittle Bangladesh but even a whitewash, so to say, wont exactly mean much. Thats why, perhaps, Dravid is looking at the challenges ahead. 

For the record, the last series win outside India was in Pakistan 15 months ago. Its not terribly exciting as Bangladesh and Pakistan are no more than a hop away. 

Back to Shastri... 

Asked whether no mercy and no prisoners figured in pep talks, he replied: One only plays to win... Thats the way I played. 

Shastri, of course, had an excellent record as (stand-in) captain. Now, hes tasting success in a different role. I feel proud... I have curd and honey every morning! 

He confirmed he wouldnt be available once this tour ends. 

Shastri, by the way, praised Whatmore. Youve got to give him credit... He identified a group of players with talent and worked hard with them... It shows in Bangladeshs body language... Its a very fine fielding unit... 

Its not insignificant that Shastri is on the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)-appointed committee to decide on Greg Chappells successor. 

 Apparently, BCCI secretary Niranjan 

 Shah is expected in a couple of days and, so, there may 

 be a dialogue with Whatmore. Ive already stated 

 that Im keen... Ive got nothing else to add, 

 Whatmore told The Telegraph after learning 

 that Shah could soon be in Bangladesh. 

 Being too keen, after all, may reduce his bargaining 

 power. 

 Footnote: 

 Irrespective of what was said at the media conference, 

 Whatmore warmly congratulated Shastri as they met in the 

 foyer on returning to the Sheraton. Shastri couldnt 

 have flashed a broader smile.

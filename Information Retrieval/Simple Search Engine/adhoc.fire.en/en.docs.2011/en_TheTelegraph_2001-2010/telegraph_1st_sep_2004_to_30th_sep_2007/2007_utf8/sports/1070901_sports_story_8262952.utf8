 Maria roars past another rival

New York: Defending champion Maria Sharapova shoved aside Australias Casey Dellacqua 6-1, 6-0 in a mere 51 minutes in the second round of the US Open on Thursday. 

It was Sharapovas second straight steamroll, having dropped only one game in her first round match as well. It also featured Sharapovas revamped service motion, one of the significant changes she has made in her game since she won here last year. 

But even Sharapova had no illusions that she had served as well as the automatic serve timer said she did. At one point in her match, on a second serve, it flashed 129 miles per hour. That would tie a Grand Slam record set by Venus Williams, well known for her powerful serves. 

It was definitely a mistake because one, Ive never hit 129 in my life, let alone a second serve, she said. Two, it definitely didnt feel like a 129. So it was definitely wishful thinking. 

But Sharapovas efforts to change her serve also illustrate a maturity that might not get noticed under her designer dresses and photogenic smile. She has been prompted to change by a shoulder injury, which highlighted the pressure her natural service motion put on the joint. She laboured for months to make the change, to shorten her motion without losing power. 

I felt like I served pretty well, she said after beating Dellacqua. 

Sharapova became one of 10 Russian women to reach the third round. That means nearly one-third of the remaining women in the draw hail from one country. And even though Sharapova, born in Siberia, has lived in Florida since she was 7, she said she took pride in that wave of success. 

Its incredible to see the growth of Russian tennis through the years, Sharapova said, pointing back to 2004 when she won Wimbledon, Ana Myskina won the French Open and Svetlana Kuznetsova beat Elena Dementieva for the US Open title.

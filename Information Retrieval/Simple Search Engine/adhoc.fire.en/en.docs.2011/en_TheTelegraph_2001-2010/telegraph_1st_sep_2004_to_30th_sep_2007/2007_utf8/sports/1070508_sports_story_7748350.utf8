The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Two arrivals, each with a point to prove

 - Revenge not on our minds, says Team India captain Rahul Dravid

Dhaka: There was a six-hour gap between the arrivals, but both Team India and Sheikh Hasina landed with more than a point to score. 

Rahul Dravids men need to prove that the loss to Bangladesh in the World Cup wasnt anything more than an aberration; the Awami League chief needs to establish that she has nothing to hide. 

While one is seeking to play beautifully, the other is preparing for bold moves. Indeed, the next few weeks are crucial for both. 

We arent here with revenge on our minds... Thats not how international sport is played... Bangladesh did well in the World Cup, but weve prepared well for this tour, emphasised Dravid. 

The Team India captain looked relaxed as he checked-in at the Sheraton. Im fine... Ill be fit for the first ODI (on Thursday), he told The Telegraph. 

Dravid has made a quick recovery after being hit by young Rudra Pratap Singh at nets the other day. Just as well, or else the tour wouldve started with a controversy over the stand-in captain. 

In what is an unhealthy first, the Indians have arrived without a vice-captain. 

The firsts, actually, are many. Sachin Tendulkar has been rested and the team is accompanied by specialist bowling (Venkatesh Prasad) and fielding (Robin Singh) coaches. 

Also, the flamboyant Ravi Shastri is wearing the coachs hat, but with a different designation cricket manager. 

Its a different feeling, yes, and theres certainly excitement... How different and how exciting is something that remains to be seen, Shastri said in an exclusive interaction. 

Earlier, talking to local newspersons, he promised hard, entertaining cricket. 

If Shastri was superstitious, though, he would lose some sleep: Power went off the moment he entered the hotels elevator and, when the supply got restored, it wouldnt accept his key-card! 

He chose to spare the hotel staff greater embarrassment by stepping out and taking the other elevator. 

Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Ramesh Powar and Munaf Patel encountered the same problem. However, they stayed put and got off once the elevator stopped on a higher floor the 11th. Lets take the emergency stairs... Its better to walk down than climb up, Dhoni quipped. 

The most enthusiastic nod came from, you guessed it, Powar. 

With Sourav Ganguly also rested, Bengals lone representative is rookie Manoj Tiwary. Uni kothay... bole deben please... was the request from more than one local. 

As for Tiwary himself, hes bahut khush and not weighed down by pressure. The conditioning camp in Calcutta was great... It felt great travelling with the team too, he pointed out. 

Therell be nothing like a great debut. 

Footnote: The dashing Tamim Iqbal is a bit under the weather, but should be available for the tour-opener. Theres more concern over the weather, though. It rained for a while on Monday afternoon and longer spells arent ruled out later in the week.

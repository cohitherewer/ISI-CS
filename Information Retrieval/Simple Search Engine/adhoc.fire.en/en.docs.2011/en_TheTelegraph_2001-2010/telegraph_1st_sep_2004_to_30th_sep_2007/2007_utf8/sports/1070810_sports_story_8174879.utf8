David Beckham revealed on Wednesday night he had already spoken to Steve McClaren about the ankle injury that has halted his start to soccer life in the United States and questioned whether the England manager will get much out of his trip. 

McClaren has flown to the States to meet Beckham, Los Angeles Galaxy manager Frank Yallop and general manager Alexi Lalas. 

But Beckham said that if McClaren was hoping to watch him play against DC United, he would see him coming off the bench for a few minutes at best. The midfielder is struggling with an ankle injury that threatens to prevent him from playing in Englands August 22 friendly against Germany. 

McClarens plans ahead of the Wembley friendly and the subsequent European Championship qualifiers against Israel and Russia have been unsettled by injuries to key players, such as Beckham and John Terry. 

While the trip to Washington will not be a waste McClaren is keen to meet those in charge of Beckhams playing career ahead of a vital international season while checking the level of MLS football the coach will be disappointed over the players injury. 

I spoke to Steve a couple of days ago, Beckham said. We spoke about how my fitness was and how my ankle was. But whether its worth him coming over to see me for just 10 minutes Im not so sure. 

Beckham took part in light training with his teammates at the RFK Stadium on Wednesday the first time he has practised along with the rest of the team since joining the club but his ankle injury continues to bother him. 

Beckham, 32, added: Its an injury that everyone knew about when I first arrived. There will obviously be people who dont understand, but I cant really apologise for being injured, its a way of life for a sportsman. THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

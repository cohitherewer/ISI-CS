Paris: His back creaks these days and his shots lack venom but Lleyton Hewitt proved again on Thursday the value of guts when he hit back from two sets down to crush former champion Gaston Gaudio at the French Open. 

The tenacious Aussie hustler, a former Wimbledon and US Open champion, came through 4-6, 3-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 against the Argentine to take his place in the third round alongside reigning champion Rafael Nadal and two of the young guns of mens tennis. 

Twice champion Rafael Nadal showed no mercy on Italian qualifier Flavio Cipolla, sweeping him aside 6-2 6-1 6-4 to reach the third round of the French Open on Thursday. 

World number two Nadal, attempting to become the first man to win three successive titles at Roland Garros since Bjorn Borg in 1980, was in control straight away, opening up a 3-0 lead in the first set. 

Leading 5-1, the Spaniard was then broken but he underlined his determination by capturing Cipollas serve immediately to take the set in 34 minutes 

The second set was even more one-sided, Nadal going 3-1 up, breaking Cipolla again in the sixth game before serving for the set, which he took courtesy of an astute drop shot. 

The 20-year-old Nadal, whose 81-match streak on clay was ended by Roger Federer in the Hamburg final earlier this month, slowed down a bit after an early break but did enough to stay in control until he earned three match points. 

A superb cross-court forehand winner on the first ended world number 227 Cipollas suffering in a one-sided contest that lasted under two hours. 

I was not able to play my best tennis but it was a good warmup, Nadal told reporters. 

The powerful left-hander, favoured to challenge world number one Federer in the June 10 final, will next meet fellow Spaniard Albert Montanes or Latvias Ernests Gulbis. 

Im playing better and better every day and Ill fight every day a bit more, Nadal said. 

Theres only one way you can eliminate pressure and thats by playing well. 

Serbian sixth seed Novak Djokovic, tipped to challenge the Federer-Nadal monopoly, breezed past French qualifier Laurent Recouderc 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1. 

Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis, a year older than Djokovic at 21, also laid down an impressive marker on the clay when the 16th seed reached the third round for the first time with a 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Dane Kristian Pless. 

Everybody expects me to be one of the guys who can actually hurt the best two players in the world and Im aware of that, Djokovic, who beat Nadal on the way to winning the Miami Masters series, told reporters. 

Theres a lot of expectation and pressure but Im trying not to think about it too much. 

World No. 2 Maria Sharapova, still mastering the claycourt craft, showed no ill effects from the shoulder injury that has disrupted her season when the 20-year-old Russian thrashed American Jill Craybas 6-2, 6-1. 

Australian Open champion Serena Williams, winner here in 2002, also reached the third round, although she was made to work overtime in the second set, coming from 0-3 down to win 6-0, 7-6. 

Im not really used to the clay, I was just kind of a little bit everywhere today, eighth seed Williams said. 

I pretty much went crazy. It was weird. I honestly didnt feel my game at all today, said Williams. 

Even when I was up 6-0, I didnt feel like I was playing my best tennis. I was kind of struggling out there to get the rhythm. Maybe because I had too many days off. 

Rising Serbian talent Ana Ivanovic, the seventh seed, and experienced Swiss Patty Schnyder also booked their places in the third round with straight sets victories. 

Gaudio, who beat Hewitt on way to winning the title here in 2004, looked set for a repeat of that result before the demons that have left him feeling like quitting this year returned. 

Hes a great shotmaker and you dont really know what hes going to come up with, Hewitt, who had an eight-week lay-off with back trouble, said. 

In the first two sets he played great but once I got the fourth I felt pretty confident. 

Hewitt broke in the first game of the fourth set, courtesy two Gaudio double faults, and he made an early breakthrough in the fifth to leave the Argentine, one of 10 to reach the second round, despondent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Becker sees it live at Lords

 - I know Flintoff and Lara... But not any Indian 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Boris Becker 

 London: Big W 

 is over, but Boris Boom Boom Becker, who revolutionised 

 grasscourt tennis in the mid-Eighties, likes returning to 

 the city which made him a superstar. 

Becker (who is Zurich based) arrived in London on Thursday night and put in a surprise appearance at Lords on Friday afternoon, Day II of the opening India-England Test. 

Accompanied by lady love Lily, he spent around half an hour in the media centres lounge before heading for the Investec box. Investec are the centres sponsors. 

However, despite turning up at a cricket match, Becker chose to position himself in front of a monitor showing the British Open golf. He sipped coffee, while Lily played with his blond hair. 

Ive seen a bit of cricket on TV, but todays the first time Ive actually come to see it live, Becker pointed out. 

Asked whether he had a favourite, Becker replied somewhat hesitantly: I know (Andrew) Flintoff and (Brian) Lara... Some of the others too... But I dont know any Indian cricketer... 

Not keen to take queries, the pinstripe suit-attired Becker politely said he was on a private visit and enjoying coffee. 

The svelte Lilys attention as well. 

 While walking to the Investec 

 box, though, Becker did take a question from The 

 Telegraph. Who do I like watching among todays 

 tennis players? Its (Roger) Federer... Yeah, its 

 him... 

Federer grew up watching him. 

After an hour with his hosts, Becker emerged to meet former England captain David Gower. While they were sharing a joke about the BBC, Sir Ian Botham came from his commentary position to greet Becker with a gentle kick from behind. 

Theyd obviously met a number of times, for Becker turned around and hugged Sir Ian. He introduced Lily (my girlfriend) and began discussing the British Open. 

Really, its all up in the mind, Becker remarked as Sir Ian made some point about top gun Colin Montgomerie. 

Briefly, the conversation shifted to cricket and Sir Ian asked Lily if she knew anything about the sport. Her response was to take a cricket ball out of her bag! Apparently, somebody had just gifted it to her beau. 

Becker gripped the cherry reasonably well but, despite Sir Ians encouragement, declined to attempt anything more. I think we must leave now, he said grinning. 

 Lily nodded and off they went.

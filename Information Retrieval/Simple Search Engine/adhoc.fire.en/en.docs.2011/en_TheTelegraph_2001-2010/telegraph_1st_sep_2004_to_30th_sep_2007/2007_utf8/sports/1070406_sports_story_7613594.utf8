 Rough start for Mickelson

Augusta: Phil Mickelson got off to a rough start in defence of his Augusta Masters title on Thursday, hitting his second shot from the pine straw and his third from the sand en route to a bogey on the first hole. 

Ryder Cup participant J.J. Henry took the early lead, making two birdies over his first four holes to go to two-under par. 

Henry was one stroke ahead of Ryder Cup teammate and Augusta native Vaughn Taylor, 2003 champion Mike Weir and 57-year-old Tom Watson, a two-time champion who had two birdies over his first six holes. 

The tournament kicked off when Arnold Palmer hit the ceremonial tee shot.

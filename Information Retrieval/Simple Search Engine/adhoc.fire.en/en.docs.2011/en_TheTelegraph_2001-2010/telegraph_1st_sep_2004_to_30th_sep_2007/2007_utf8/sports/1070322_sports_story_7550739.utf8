 We are staying positive: Yuvraj

 in Couva on Wednesday

Port of Spain: The National Cricket Centre in Couva is a good 45-minute drive from the heart of the city. Along the countryside, overlooking the Clifford Roach Drive and surrounded by sugarcane plantations, the Indians practised for close to two hours. After an off day on Tuesday, preparations for the battle for survival on Friday has begun in right earnest. 

We are all focused on the big game Its an important match and obviously there is pressure. But we are not thinking about anything We are staying positive and want to put up a good performance, Yuvraj Singh summed up the mood in the camp. 

With the batsmen getting runs against Bermuda, the bowlers are under the scanner now. The way even the lowly Bermudans held fort for 43.1 overs en route to 156 has exposed the limitations in Indian attack. 

The thinktank is undecided on the bowling combination for Fridays clash against Sri Lanka. One school of thought suggests that a five-pronged attack with two specialist spinners should be ideal. The wicket usually becomes easier and assists the tweakers after the first hour. That will pave the way for the return of Harbhajan Singh. 

The Indians are also not ruling out the inclusion of Irfan Pathan in place of Robin Uthappa. 

The wicket does a bit in the morning. Lets see how it goes. A score of around 240-260 will be good on this wicket. Chasing that will be difficult, felt Yuvraj. 

The decision to bat first against Bangladesh has also caused ripples. At the post-match media conference, the captain tried to make it clear that the decision was supported by everyone. Coach Greg Chappell also voiced his support for Dravid the next day. 

But there are whispers that not many supported the move. A wiser captain wouldnt have exposed his batsmen to a damp pitch in the very first match of the tournament, especially when they have a good record chasing targets. 

Dravids leadership on the field, too, has been unimaginative. The target of 192 was defendable had the captain managed his resources well. He was late in bringing on Sehwag, who gave two vital breakthroughs towards the end. With Harbhajan Singh going great guns at the other end, Sehwags early introduction could have made a difference. 

Pathetic field placing also paved the way for Bangladesh to score freely. For most of the second session, the Indians drooping shoulders made it easy for their opponents.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Well win: Sehwag

- Sehwag promises to deliver in SA

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Banished from the Test and ODI squads, out of the very spotlight which had defined life in the fast lane for six years, a receding hairline. One would have thought Virender Sehwags life had changed. 

But no, it hasnt. His attitude towards life and cricket is still very forthright and uncomplicated. And hes still the daredevil that characterised his whirlwind batting during his prime. 

So when the question was thrown at him whether he had changed his batting style in an effort to regain consistency, Indias sole Test triple centurion pulled no punches. I dont have to change my technique or style I still bat the way I used to, he said on Wednesday afternoon shortly after opening the biggest Adidas store in eastern India. 

He was an hour behind schedule, thanks to a delayed flight and traffic congestion. The big media contingent was getting restless, but not the much bigger crowd which had assembled outside the new store on hearing that Sehwag was soon to make an appearance there. 

How difficult was it to adjust to club cricket after having been accustomed to a five-star life for so long? I didnt have a problem in adjustment because the primary aim was always to play cricket, came the quick retort.He admitted that he had been looking for an opportunity to play in the County circuit this summer as he didnt have India duty. I was interested in playing in England, but no one called me. It seems fast bowlers were in demand this season, not batsmen. 

The ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa later this month will provide Sehwag the chance to show the selectors that he was still capable of playing in the big league.Will India will be missing the services of Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly? They wont be there, but even then we have a fine side India are the favourites to win the tournament, predicted Sehwag, who will be leaving for South Africa on Sunday. 

Souravs form inevitably cropped up. I have always said hes a great player. What a comeback he has made, hes been performing so consistently, said Sehwag.

Calcutta: Riding Tamil Nadu vice-captain Rajagopal Sathishs sparkling effort, Chemplast Sanmar Limited pulled off a penultimate-ball one-wicket victory over Indian Airlines to claim The Telegraph Twenty20 Cricket Tournament title presented by McDowell No.1 at the CC amp;FC on Sunday. 

Thus, Indian Airlines had to finish second best again. 

The final could not have been more thrilling. Chasing Indian Airlines 142, Chemplast kept losing wickets at regular intervals, but for Sathish. 

While skipper S. Badrinath made 14 (16 balls), Hemang Badani managed a nine-ball 13. Man-of-the-Final Sathish, however, kept the scorers busy. But his departure following a 31-ball 60, laced with six sixes and one four, made things difficult for Chemplast with just the last pair at the crease. In the final over, Indian Airlines needed one wicket, and Chemplast four runs; the latter succeeded as Tamil Kumaran hit a boundary in the second-last ball of the match. 

For the Yuvraj Singh-Mohammed Kaif studded Indian Airlines, Rajat Bhatia top-scored with an unbeaten 70. Having faced two balls, Yuvraj got out without bothering the scorers; Kaif, on the other hand, made a 11-ball six in his lacklustre Twenty20 stint. Yuvraj got a wicket as well. 

CAB XI, meanwhile, took the third place with a 11-run win over ONGC.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bagan labour past Viva Kerala

JAYDEEP BASU

 Jose Ramirez Barreto scored the first goal 

Ludhiana: Defending champions Mohun Bagan entered the semi-finals of the Federation Cup at the Guru Nanak Stadium here on Sunday. 

Pitted against an opposition that lacked in confidence, the Calcutta side, without star striker Bhaichung Bhutia, huffed and puffed for most part of the proceedings before showing debutant Viva Kerala the door with an unconvincing 3-1 victory. 

The scoreline does not reflect the true nature of the proceedings as the Kerala side, with little more precision involved in their game plan, could have stretched the battle further. My boys were overawed by the opposition. We had our chances, but Mohun Bagan was better, said Viva Kerala coach A. M. Sreedharan. 

Mohun Bagan coach Carlos Roberto Pereira, however, didnt look too bothered about the unimpressive manner in which his team made the penultimate round. 

According to him, seven of his players Jose Ramirez Barreto, Rauf Khan, Peter Odafe, Ishfaq Ahmed, Peter Sidiqui, Dharamjit Singh and Bhaichung Bhutia were suffering from food poisoning since late on Saturday. 

Seven of my footballers are suffering from food poisoning and that is why we had such a tough match, he said. It was difficult for them. The whole night they have been running to the toilet. I am carrying medicine for them. I dont know how many of them would be fit for the next match. 

I am happy that despite all this the team could win, continued the Brazilian. There were some flaws, which we should be able to iron out before the next outing. 

That Mohun Bagan went up 2-0 before half-time and survived a barrage of attacks came as a big relief for the green and maroon bench. In the absence of Bhaichung, the agile Barreto did the trick to put the team in the lead in the 15th minute. 

Barreto looked weak and sluggish, yet made most of the opportunity when Peter Odafe headed the ball into the goalmouth from the right, after Manipuri medio Dharamjit Singh started the move from the left. The Brazilian darted in to slide the ball home in the nick of time. 

Dharamjits replacement, Ishfaq Ahmed, scored within four minutes of coming in. Put through by India discard Venkatesh in a counter-attack, the Kashmiri footballer rushed through two lazily moving Viva Kerala defenders to find the target. 

Goalkeeper Sangram Mukherjee was to be blamed for allowing Viva Kerala to close the gap in the 51st minute. He had little reason to advance when an over-lapping wing-back Sajesh floated the ball into the Mohun Bagan goal. It dipped in, leaving Mukherjee, desperately retreating, stranded. 

Mohun Bagan were able to widen the gap with a goal from Lalwmpuia in the 56th minute.

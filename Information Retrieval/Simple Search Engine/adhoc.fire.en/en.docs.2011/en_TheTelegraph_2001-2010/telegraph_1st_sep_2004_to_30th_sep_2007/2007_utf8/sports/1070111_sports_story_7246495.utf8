 Rahman grabs sole lead

A STAFF REPORTER

 Ziaur Rahman 

Calcutta: Grandmaster Ziaur Rahman grabbed the lead after the tenth and penultimate round of the Alekhine Chess Club-organised Bengal Peerless FIDE rating chess tournament at Gorky Sadan on Wednesday. 

Rahman played out a quick draw with experienced IM S. Satyapragyan in the morning session and then justified his top billing against IM elect Saptarshi Roy in the crucial tenth round to sit pretty at the top of the heap. 

Six players who have half-a-point less follow him. It will be difficult to dislodge the Bangladeshi GM from the top; he needs only a draw to be assured of at least joint first position. Saptarshi Roy crumbled under the pressure created by the top seed in a Catalan Opening. 

IMPORTANT RESULTS 

Round IX: Saptarshi Roy (7.5) bt Abdullah Al Rakib (7); S. Satyapragyan (7) drew with Ziaur Rahman (7); Enamul Hossain (7) bt Dilip Das (6); Swapan Mitra (7) bt Suvrajit Saha (6); Venkat Sundaram (6) lost to Abhishek Das (7); Nisha Mohota (6) drew with Shanker Roy (6).

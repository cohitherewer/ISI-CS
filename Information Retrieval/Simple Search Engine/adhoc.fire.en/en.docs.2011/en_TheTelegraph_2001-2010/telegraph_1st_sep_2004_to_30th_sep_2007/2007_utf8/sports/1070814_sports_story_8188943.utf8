 Mickelson for Singapore meet

Singapore: World No. 3 Phil Mickelson will make his Asian Tour debut in the $4 million Singapore Open golf tournament later this year, organisers said on Monday. 

The American joins a field that includes two-time US Open winner Ernie Els, world No. 5 Adam Scott and current US Open champion Angel Cabrera at what is billed as Asias richest national Open. 

Scott, of Australia, will attempt to claim his third straight title at the November 1-4 tournament on the par-71 Serapong course on the resort island of Sentosa. 

Also bidding for the title are world No. 6 Vijai Singh of Fiji, former US Open champion Michael Campbell, Ryder Cup star Darren Clarke and Japans Shingo Katayama.

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The new Indian Football Association (IFA) secretary Utpal Kumar Ganguly will initiate moves to set up a new stadium. 

In a meeting with the media on Monday, Ganguly said that stress will be on improving infrastructural facilities. 

I have different ideas and I would adopt some of them according to the need of the situation. But setting up a new stadium will be our prime objective. Ill talk to the government in this regard, said Utpal Kumar Ganguly said at the IFA office. 

We need a composite package. We also need to develop a corporate culture around the game, added Ganguly, who is also president of the Chirag United Sports Club. 

Praising his predecessor Subrata Duttas role for the games development in the state, Ganguly emphasised his regime would like to keep the momentum going.

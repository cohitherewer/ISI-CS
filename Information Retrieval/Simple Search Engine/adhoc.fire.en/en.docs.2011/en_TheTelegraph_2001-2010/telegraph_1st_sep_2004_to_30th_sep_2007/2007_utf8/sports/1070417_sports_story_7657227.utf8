 My best game, says Johnston

Bridgetown: Captain Trent Johnston described his teams World Cup Super Eight win over Bangladesh on Sunday as the best game of cricket he has played with Ireland. 

The World Cup debutants defeated Bangladesh by 74 runs after scoring 243 for seven and then dismissing them for 169 in the 42nd over. 

It was the best game of cricket Ive been involved with in my four years with these guys. It was the best all-round performance that weve had -- all three disciplines were outstanding, Johnston said in a news conference. 

We had to bounce back from the disappointment against Australia when a lot of people were saying a lot of things about us. We had a good chat after that game and we set new goals, he added. 

Australian-born Johnston was as pleased for the fans who had travelled to Barbados, having seen the team qualify unexpectedly, as he was for himself and his teammates. 

Lots of people spent a lot of money to come over and watch us play two games of cricket, and in a huge game against Australia we were nothing short of disappointing. So we had to turn that around quick smart and the guys did that, Johnston said. 

Im pleased with the level of effort the guys put in because it was a first-class effort from a team that deserves to be playing this level of cricket. 

Weve got a pretty big game on Wednesday, Johnston added. So we will have a couple of quiet ales tonight. But after Wednesday we have got three or four days (spare) so, as the coach says, we can set the dogs loose then. 

Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar admitted Ireland had been a more consistent team in the World Cup than Bangladesh. 

The way we played today, we deserved to lose, Bashar said. It was one of those days when nothing went right for us. We fielded pretty ordinary, we bowled poorly and when chasing, we lost too many early wickets. 

Its very much frustrating for me, he added. Weve done a very good job in this World Cup so far by beating two big teams. One day we look brilliant and the next we are ordinary. We need to be more consistent. 

His comment referred to the way Bangladesh beat India in the group stage to oust the 1983 winners and then South Africa eight days ago when the Proteas were still ranked world No. 1. 

It looks like we are going to be number eight (in the Super Eight) after this match and we had hoped we would be sixth or seventh, Bashar said. I must give credit to Ireland, though. They played very well and put us under pressure.

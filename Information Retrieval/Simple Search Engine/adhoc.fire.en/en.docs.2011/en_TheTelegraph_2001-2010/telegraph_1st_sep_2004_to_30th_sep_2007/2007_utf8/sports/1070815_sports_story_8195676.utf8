 Team India arrive in Glasgow 

Glasgow: Fresh from their first Test series win on English soil in 21 years, the Indian team reached here Wednesday for their one-off one-day International against Scotland on August 16. 

The match would serve as a warm-up for the seven-match ODI series against England starting August 21. 

The players, obviously in high spirits, took the day off and would be practising Wednesday. 

However, the weather forecast for the match was not encouraging and the organisers are keeping their fingers crossed hoping the game would not be affected.

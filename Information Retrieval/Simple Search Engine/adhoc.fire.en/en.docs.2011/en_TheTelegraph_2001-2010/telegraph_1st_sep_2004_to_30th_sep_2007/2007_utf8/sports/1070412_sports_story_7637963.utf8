The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 United in seventh heaven

HENRY WINTER in Manchester

 The executioners: Michael Carrick (2), Alan

 Smith, Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo (2) and Patrice Evra, who scored

 in Manchester United's 7-1 demolition of AS Roma 

 during their Champions League quarter final, second leg, at Old Trafford

 on Tuesday

This was one of those enchanted evenings that Manchester United supporters fantasise about, when the self-styled Theatre of Dreams lived up to its name, and when one of Europes most vaunted opponents were brutally put to the sword. Not only did Sir Alex Fergusons pacey passion-players race to their biggest European win in 39 years, but they conjured up a sublime performance that will live even longer in the memory. 

Liverpool and AC Milan reached the Champions League semi-finals on Wednesday. A goal from Peter Crouch helped Liverpool beat PSV Eindhoven 1-0 in the second leg and advance 4-0 on aggregate. Milan downed Bayern 2-0 to progress 4-2 on aggregate. Clarence Seedorf scored Milans first goal in the 27th minute and set up Filippo Inzaghi for the second in the 31st. 

This was one of those magical nights when it seemed every United touch turned to gold, when every move brought a goal, a remarkable hour and a half of relentless attacking when the outstanding Michael Carrick and Cristiano Ronaldo both bagged braces, and when Wayne Rooney, Alan Smith and even little Patrice Evra scored. Rome wasnt built in a day, but it took only 90 minutes to destroy Romas defence. 

This was one of those games when fans ran through the record books, let alone the songbooks, when they took photographs of the scoreboard as a reminder that seven goals were indeed put past a side who had entered the quarter finals with the best defensive record around. 

This was one of those routs when United were in such command that Ferguson was signing autographs even before the final whistle confirmed passage to a semi-final against either AC Milan or Owen Hargreaves Bayern Munich, at Old Trafford on April 24 and in the shadow of the Alps on May 2. 

Victory was made all the sweeter following last weeks troubled trip to the Olympic Stadium where United fans were baton-charged by police, but at least they came away with Rooneys away goal. For a lover of Westerns like Ferguson, last night was a case of The Magnificent Seven following The Good, The Bad And The Ugly. 

So Fergusons pursuit of a craved second European Cup continues apace, this astonishing triumph moving him to within 270 minutes of true greatness. His players filled the headlines, and their boots, but this was a script with one author: Ferguson set United up so well temperamentally and tactically that Roma were swept away. 

Uniteds nervy weekend display at Fratton Park seemed a world away, a distant planet, from the devastating attacking that accounted for Roma here. The Italians drowned in a cauldron of English adrenalin. First came Carrick after 11 minutes, setting the scene for an extraordinary evening with a majestic strike. The creative catalyst was Ronaldo, who cut in from the right, eluding Alessandro Mancini, but rather than continue on a mazy run, the Portuguese cleverly slipped the ball inside to Carrick, who brilliantly chipped Doni: 1-0. 

The poacher turned goal-maker moments later. Carrick rolled the ball wide to Gabriel Heinze and suddenly red shirts were flooding forward from every angle, teeming with menacing intent. Heinze found Ryan Giggs, who elegantly transferred the ball towards Smith, a blur of movement down the centre. Cristian Chivu, belying his experience, failed to cut the ball out, and Smith was through. Doni advanced but Smith was too focused, too determined. 

He had waited 15 months for his first European start, and such a committed footballer who lives for football, whose idol was Francesco Totti, was driven by a huge desire to make life uncomfortable for Tottis team. Smiths finish was emphatic, superbly placed past Doni: 2-0. And to think that Smith almost joined Cardiff City on loan after Christmas. 

There was more, thrillingly so. Ronaldo and Smith combined, Giggs crossed and there was Rooney, angling a shot across Doni: 3-0. The party really got started. With goals from three Englishmen, no wonder the watching Steve McClaren wore a huge grin. Romans were being devoured by lions. Then Englands World Cup nemesis took centre stage. Ronaldo collected the ball from the lively Giggs, and caught Doni cold at his near-post: 4-0. Uniteds glee club chanted attack, attack, attack, their words brimming with irony. 

The torture for Roma continued after half-time. Rooney picked up possession 40 yards out and calmly directed the ball left to Giggs. The Welshman, the embodiment of all that is good about the Ferguson era, sped towards the Stretford End, and crossed low and hard. Ronaldo slid in at the far-post: 5-0. 

Still United came. Heinze cut the ball back for Carrick to drive in a wonderful strike: 6-0. Easy, easy reverberated around Old Trafford. Daniele de Rossi then netted with a fine volley but it was simply a twitch of rigor mortis setting in. All life had drained from Roma, like the Trevi Fountain in a drought.

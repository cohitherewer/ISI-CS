The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India in fifth spot

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: India moved into fifth place, two rating points behind New Zealand, in the ICC one-day rankings following their 2-1 series win over Sri Lanka in the just-concluded series. 

According to a media release, South Africa have taken over at the summit of the table following Australias five-wicket loss to New Zealand in Auckland on Sunday which cost Michael Husseys side two rating point. 

And even if Australia win the final match of the three-match series against the Black Caps, in Hamilton on Tuesday, it will not be enough for them to regain top spot. 

South Africa have taken over thanks to an outstanding recent run of form in the past 12 months. 

Since they failed to qualify for the finals of the tri-series against Australia and Sri Lanka last February they have won 15 of the next 21 matches. 

The side that leads the table on April 1 stands to win $175,000, with $75,000 going to the second-placed team, and so, with the World Cup starting in the Caribbean on March 13, there is still an opportunity for Australia to regain the top spot ahead of that cut-off date. 

If Stephen Flemings side can complete a 3-0 clean sweep on Tuesday, then they will overtake Inzamam-ul-Haqs side.

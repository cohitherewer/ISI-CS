 Wessels ire

Durban: Former captain Kepler Wessels has criticised Graeme Smiths men for taking Bangladesh lightly. 

Wessels said the team was guilty of underestimating a Bangladesh team which is looking like world-beaters now. Bangladesh had accounted for India and I dont think we should have taken them lightly, he said. 

Meanwhile, former chairman of selectors Omar Henry blamed poor selections made without analysing the pitch conditions. (PTI)

 Mumbai claim title

Jaipur: Brilliant batting by Vinayak Mane (86) and impressive bowling performance by Nilesh Kulkarni (3/15) helped Ranji champions Mumbai trounce Rajasthan by 72 runs in the final of the National One-dayers at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium on Wednesday. 

Rajasthan captain Mohammed Aslam put Mumbai in and the visitors had piled up 287 for six in 50 overs. In reply, the home team were dismissed for 215 in 46.1 overs. For Rajasthan, the 288-run target was a tough task to achieve on slow wicket. 

Chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar, who watched the proceedings, was pleased with Mumbais performance. I thought Mumbai played very well. It is not that Rajasthan has played badly, but Mumbai was better, said Vengsarkar.

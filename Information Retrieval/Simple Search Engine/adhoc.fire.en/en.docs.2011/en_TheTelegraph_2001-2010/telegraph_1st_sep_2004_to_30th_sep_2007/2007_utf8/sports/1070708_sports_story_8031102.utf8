 Leeds up for sale

London: Debt-ridden English club Leeds United could go out of existence next week after being put up for sale by the clubs administrators. 

A statement from KPMG (an audit firm) Friday said it had made the decision because of a legal challenge by Britains Revenue and Customs service over 7.7 million owed to the government by the 88-year-old Yorkshire club. 

The tax man is also disputing chairman Ken Batess proposed plan to take the club out of administration by offering creditors just eight pence in the pound.

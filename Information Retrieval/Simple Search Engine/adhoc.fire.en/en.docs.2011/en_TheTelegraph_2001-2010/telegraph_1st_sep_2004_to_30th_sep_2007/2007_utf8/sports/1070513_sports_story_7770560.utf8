Calcutta: Anuradha Biswal stopped the clock at 14.01 seconds on Saturday evening at Salt Lake Stadium. It was slower than her national record (13.38 in 2002) and meet record (13.48 in 2006) efforts, but still good enough to fetch her the 100m hurdles gold in the Eveready Federation Cup Athletics Championships. 

The Orissa sprinter, all of 30 and a mother of a three-year-old, left Poonam Bojwana and J.J. Shobha in her wake. Bojwana clocked 14.13 for silver, while Shobha (14.32) had to be satisfied with silver. 

I owe this to my husband He has been my inspiration, said Biswal, adding that she would now be working hard for success in the Asian Championships. 

Seema Antil retained the womens discus title, edging out Krishna Punia of Rajasthan. Antils winning throw travelled 58.09 metres, whereas Krishnas best was 57.02. Punjabs Harwant Kaur won the bronze. 

Manjeet Kaur of Punjab Police failed to live up to expectations in the womens 400m and managed no more than bronze. Chitra Soman clinched gold with a career-best timing of 53.43. Andhras Iyleen Samantha (53.47) got silver. 

The Bengal athletes, who had a great second day, failed to bag a single medal on Saturday. They came last in the womens 4x100m relay, while Ratna Naskar was nowhere near her best in discus. Tuli Deshmukh disappointed in the womens 100m hurdles. 

In mens events, Bengal came a cropper in the 4x100m relay in which Jharkhand (41.49) won gold. Army and Tamil Nadu claimed second and third positions, respectively. 

Tamil Nadu won the womens relay race clocking 48.43. 

Anil Kumar braved an ankle injury to retain the mens javelin gold. A heave of 73.61 metres clinched it for him. Sunil Goswami of Delhi was second (72.72) and Om Narayan of Haryana third (71.08). 

Josheph Abraham of CRPF won gold in mens 400m with a timing of 46.88. Armys Sarish Paul (47.37) and UPs Vinay Chaudhury (47.63) followed Abraham.

 A dream come true: Sreesanth

Kochi: Medium-pacer Sreesanth, on Monday, said it was a dream come true for him to book a berth in the next months cricket World Cup squad and a great opportunity to perform well. 

It is a dream come true for me. It is Gods grace. It is really a great opportunity for me to do well, Sreesanth. 

I am focussing on the next two games against the Sri Lankans, said Sreesanth, the second Kerala player after Tinu Yohannan to don the Indian colours. 

On Indias chances in the World Cup, he said: We are confident of putting up a good performance in the World Cup. Sreesanths father Shanthakumaran said: I was tense after the Rajkot match but I was confident that my son would be in the team. 

We had been to the temple in the morning and our neighbours too had gone to the temple to pray for Sreesanths selection, he added.

 Turning point was Nazirs run out: Malik

 Shoaib Malik 

Johannesburg: Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik said Imran Nazirs run out was the turning point of the see-saw final of the ICC World Twenty20 on Monday. 

Pakistan have never won a World Cup match against India but Malik insisted the summit clash did not put his team under pressure. Chasing 158, he said, Pakistan were well on course before Nazirs run out laid them low. 

Imran Nazir has been our in-form batsman in this tournament and he was batting very well today. Then, he started to struggle with his groin. 

We lost early wickets, but his run out was the turning point. Had he not been run out, we would have won easily, rued Malik after his side lost by five runs on Monday. 

Malik paid tribute to Indian bowlers, especially left-arm pacer Rudra Pratap Singh. 

The difference was R.P. Singh, though all of them bowled very well, he added. 

The way he bowled up front, and in the 19th over, was tremendous. I didnt get to face him this time, but from what I have seen of him here, he is a vastly different bowler to the one I played against last year. He is quicker and his line and length were just outstanding. 

As for their game plan, Malik said Pakistans plan was to restrict India to between 150 and 160. 

We were successful in our plan. Unfortunately, we lost too many early wickets. We only lost by five runs, and the runs Rohit Sharma made towards the end of the innings really helped the Indian team. 

Misbah-ul Haq had just hit Joginder Sharma for a towering six when 12 were needed off the last over. He then played a cheeky scoop, which resulted in his dismissal and Indias triumph. Malik acknowledged that he spoke to Misbah about it. 

I asked him about that at the end of the game. He said he was intending to play down the ground and wound up towards that effect, but somehow ended up playing that paddle at the last minute. Its just one of those things. 

Meanwhile, after his first assignment with the Pakistan team in the meet, coach Geoff Lawson praised the players, saying they were a terrific bunch and not a disjointed and inharmonious side. 

Im a little bit tired of reading how disjointed and inharmonious the Pakistan team is, as people just dont know what goes on in the dressing room. Theyre a terrific bunch of guys, and weve got all the ingredients to be a good side, Lawson said. 

Results apart, Ive been really happy with the consistency our guys have shown. Theyve shown fight when theyve been under pressure, and today was no exception, he was quoted in the British media. 

The Australian also defended batsman Misbah-ul, whose unorthodox shot saw him caught at fine leg. 

Hes played it well in this tournament and with a little more bat on it, it would have gone for four. I could see him playing it because fine leg was up A yorker was coming so the shot was pretty much on the cards, he said. (PTI)

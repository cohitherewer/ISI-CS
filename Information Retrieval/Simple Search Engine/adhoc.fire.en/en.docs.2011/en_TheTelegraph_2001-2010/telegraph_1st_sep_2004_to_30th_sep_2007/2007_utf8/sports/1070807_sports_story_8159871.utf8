 McGrath: It is tempting

 - Different views on ICL 

 Glenn McGrath 

Sydney: Glenn McGrath says he wants to play in the breakaway Indian Twenty20 Cricket League, even though confirmed high-profile signings are scarce. 

Former West Indies captain Brian Lara is the only prominent contemporary player to confirm he has joined the Indian Cricket League, which is proposing to run a Twenty20 series in October in direct opposition to a one-day series between India and Australia. 

McGrath and his former Test team-mate Shane Warne, who both retired from Test and one-day cricket earlier this year, have been linked with the ICL, but negotiations continue and so far neither of them has signed on. 

Its tempting, McGrath said on Monday, two months after he bowed out of international cricket by taking a record 26 wickets at the World Cup. 

McGrath, 37, said a short-term Twenty20 tournament would be ideal to give him his fix of cricket without taxing him. 

Obviously, you can make a little bit of money. Probably a month of cricket, get back, give me that fix of playing again it might be all I need. 

The BCCI is determined to ensure the failure of the rebel ICL, which is bankrolled by the countrys largest listed media house, Zee Telefilms.

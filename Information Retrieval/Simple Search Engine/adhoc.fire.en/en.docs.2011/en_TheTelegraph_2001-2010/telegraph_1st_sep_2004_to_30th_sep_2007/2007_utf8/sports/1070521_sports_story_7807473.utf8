 Inzamam autocratic, say players

Karachi: Inzamam-ul Haq was perceived as an autocrat by different players of his team, a member of the Performance Evaluation Committee (PEC) that probed Pakistans World Cup failure said. 

Inzamams teammates gave their feedback to the PEC about his attitude and their statements had been recorded on audio cassettes, said an official, claiming that the PEC had no bias against the former captain. 

Inzamam had become an introvert and autocratic captain, particularly after The Oval fiasco when his refusal to go to the field was overlooked by the then PCB chief Shaharyar Khan, said the report. (PTI)

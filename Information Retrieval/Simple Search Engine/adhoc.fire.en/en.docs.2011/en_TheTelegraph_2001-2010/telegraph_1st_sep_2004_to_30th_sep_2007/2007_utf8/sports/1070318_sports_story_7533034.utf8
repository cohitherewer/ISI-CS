 It was a nervy win: Fleming

Gros Islet: New Zealand match-winner Scott Styris said the competition for places within the side had spurred him on to score an unbeaten 87 and take two wickets in the World Cup win over England on Friday. 

The allrounder was pleased to show his worth in the six-wicket Group C victory, especially with in-form batsman Peter Fulton unlucky to miss out on a place in the side. 

I havent played very well since I came back from a back injury so it is great to contribute, Styris said. I knew the heat was on me to go out and deliver. It is the sign of a good side when you cant take your position for granted. 

Asked if opposition sides underestimated him because of his quiet manner, the 31-year-old said: Ive been around for a while. I dont have a point to prove to anyone. 

With Michael Vaughans men lumbering to 209 for seven, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming said Shane Bonds bowling and the removal of Englands middle order in quick succession was key to the victory. 

Today it was ideal to have got the big guns, Flintoff and Pietersen, so quickly. It really cut down the 250 score, he said. 

It was a nervy win. It is a great relief to get the two points in the bank. This first game could have a massive bearing, certainly on the next stage. 

He added: It was a poor top-order display that put the pressure smack back on us but we responded well. 

England captain Vaughan said New Zealand had put them under a lot of pressure with the ball and he bemoaned the fact that none of his players went on to score a century, a common problem in their one-day displays. 

New Zealand were 72 for four at one stage in their chase but England could not capitalise. In the field we had a small sniff of an opportunity to beat them when they were four down, he said. (Agencies)

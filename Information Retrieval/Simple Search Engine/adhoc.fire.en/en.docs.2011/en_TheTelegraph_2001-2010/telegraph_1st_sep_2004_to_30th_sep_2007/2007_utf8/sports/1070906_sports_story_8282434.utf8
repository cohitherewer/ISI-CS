Chennai: Underdogs Malaysia wiped out a three goal deficit to hold three-time winners Pakistan 3-3 to make the semi-finals from group A in the 7th Asia Cup hockey here Wednesday. 

Pakistan, who went into the match in a must-win situation, that too needing a margin of over six goals to qualify for the semi-finals, is virtually out of medal contention for the first time since the inaugural edition of the Asia Cup in 1982. 

Pakistan finished their league engagements with seven points behind Malaysia (10). 

Japan, who shocked Pakistan in their league match, is all set to take the other semi-final berth from the group as they are sitting pretty with six points and a match to go against lowly Singapore, who have lost all their three matches so far. 

Pakistan, who won three consecutive golds since 1982, the silver twice and bronze once, now have to pray for a miracle Singapore beating Japan. 

Malaysia pulled off a sensational draw through a penalty stroke conversion minutes before the end of regulation time by Megat Azrafiq after hardworking T Ahamad Tajuddin reduced the margin with a brace (43rd and 57th minutes). For Pakistan, Shakeel Abbasi (17th and 26th) and Akhtar Ali (33rd) scored. 

In group B the semi-final line up is not clear yet, as China held Korea to a 3-3 draw. The first half of the Pakistan-Malaysia match saw the rivals making some moves but both lacked finish. 

Pakistans attempt to try variation in penalty corners by going for indirect hits did not bear fruit. Malaysia did not play to their potential. The aggressive game play seen in the 2-0 defeat of Japan was absent as they allowed Pakistan to start dominating. 

The Pakistani frontline, spearheaded by captain Rehan Butt put the Malaysian defence under pressure and soon tasted success. Latching on a neat cross from Butt, Shakeel Abbasi put his team on to a 1-0 lead. Abbasi increased the lead a few minutes later, pouncing on a defensive lapse. A gentle push was all that was required and he made no mistake. 

Close to the end of the first half, Pakistan scored their third goal with Akthar Ali getting the deflection to a long pass from the midfield to take the break with a 3-0 lead. But the second half was a different story altogether with Malaysia fighting back.

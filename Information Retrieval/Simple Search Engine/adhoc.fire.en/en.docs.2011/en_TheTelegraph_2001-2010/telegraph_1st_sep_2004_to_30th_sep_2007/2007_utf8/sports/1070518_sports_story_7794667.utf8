 Dempo refuse to play in Gurgaon

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Armando Colaco 

New Delhi: The Super Cup match, scheduled to be held in Gurgaon on May 27 between Federation Cup winners Mohun Bagan and NFL champions Dempo, has run into problems. 

The Dempo coach-cum-secretary Armando Colaco has threatened not to play the match unless the venue is changed, while Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra sounded extremely unhappy over the terms and conditions offered to the teams. 

In a letter to the AIFF, Colaco said Dempo would not play in Gurgaon as the ground is unsuitable for an important match like the Super Cup, which offers a prize-money of Rs 10 lakh. 

During the last Santosh Trophy, almost all coaches condemned the surface and playing conditions in Gurgaon, Armando pointed out. 

Its 40 degrees there I dont think its fair for the AIFF to force us play an important match in such hot and humid conditions. If the AIFF still insists on the match being played there, we will not be a party to it, Colaco concluded. 

Mitra said playing in Gurgaon was not a problem, the terms and conditions offered were. 

The AIFF is paying only us Rs 400 per player as food allowance which I feel is pretty low, Mitra said. In the NFL, a team is allowed to reach the venue 48 hours before a match. Here we can go just 24 hours prior to the encounter.

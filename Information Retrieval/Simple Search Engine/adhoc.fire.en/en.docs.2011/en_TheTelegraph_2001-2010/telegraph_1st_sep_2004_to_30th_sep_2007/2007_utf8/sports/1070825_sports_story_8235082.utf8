 PCB to offer incentives to get back Yousuf

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has stepped up efforts to convince Mohammed Yousuf to change his mind with regard to his decision to join the Indian Cricket League (ICL). 

Sources in the Pakistan camp on Friday said board officials were considering the option of giving financial incentives to woo Yousuf back. 

All the indications are there that Lawson and the board might have a discussion with him about his decision and some financial incentives might be given to induce him back into official cricket, a source said. 

Yousuf, former skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq, Abdul Razzaq and Imran Farhat had recently joined the ICL. 

The PCB had said it will not consider players, who go and play in the ICL for selection in the national team. 

Some former players have suggested that the board should allow players to play for both the ICL and the national team. 

It is not so easy because even if the PCB adopts such a policy it cant do it alone. Because this would have an effect on the policies of the Indian board and others. Things have got complicated today with the ICL now going to court against the Indian board and its policies, the source said. 

Pakistan manager Talat Ali admitted that discussions were held to chalk out a strategy to convince Yousuf. 

Talat, sources said, is one of those people who believe that if the selectors had handled the omission of Yousuf and Abdul Razzaq, from the Twenty20 squad, more diplomatically the current crisis would not have developed. 

Lawson has openly said Yousuf joining the ICL is a big loss to Pakistan cricket and he would like to see him review his decision on playing in the ICL.

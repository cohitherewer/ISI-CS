Phuket: Gaurav Ghei started his final day with an eagle-two and rounded it off with a 40-footer for birdie to compile a record-equalling round of eight-under 64 that carried him from 50th to a tied sixth place at the Johnnie Walker Classic here on Sunday. 

Gheis performance at the demanding Blue Canyon Country Club course was his best finish in the year so far. 

The overall honours went to 20-year-old Anton Haig (71), who won a three-way play-off to become the youngest winner of the event, erasing the name of Tiger Woods who was 22 when he won the event in 1998. 

Ghei, winner of the Mercuries Masters last year, shot six birdies and an eagle in a flawless round, with the next best for the day being a five-under 67 by Mike Weir, who ended fifth, one spot ahead of Ghei. 

Haig, winner of Pulai Springs Malaysian Masters last year, claimed the biggest cheque of his career ($409,000) besides an exemption on the European Tour till the end of 2009. 

Among other Indians, Jeev Milkha Singh (74), the best placed after the third round at tied 11th, was done in by a bad back nine, where he shot three bogeys and a double in the last six holes to finish tied 25th at four-under 284. 

The Chandigarh golfer looked set for at least a top-10 finish as he birdied the 11th and 12th and was eight-under at that stage. 

But he double bogeyed the 13th and dropped another shot at the 14th. He made a birdie on 16th but had a bogey-bogey finish to crash down. 

Rahil Gangjee (74) was stymied by three bogeys in a row from 10th to 12th and ended with another bogey on 18th. Overall, he had six bogeys and four birdies and with a total of two-under 286 ended tied 37th. 

Shiv Kapur (73), with three birdies and four bogeys, was at two-over 290 and tied 60th. 

Award for Jeev 

Meanwhile, Jeev continued to reap the harvests of a dream 2006 as the Indian ace was named the Johnnie Walker Asian Player of the Year. 

The 35-year-old Indian, who won four titles worldwide last year, was honoured at the Johnnie Walker Keep Walking golf awards at the Sheraton Grande Laguna hotel here on Saturday night. 

The other award winners were local hero Chinarat Phadungsil of Thailand, who picked the Asian Rising Star Award, while Spaniard Alvaro Quiros earned the Young Player Of The Year award.

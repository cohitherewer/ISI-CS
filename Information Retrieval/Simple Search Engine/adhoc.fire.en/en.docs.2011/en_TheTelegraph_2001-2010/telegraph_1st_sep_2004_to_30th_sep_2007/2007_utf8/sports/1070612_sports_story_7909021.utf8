 Safety car rules draw flak

Montreal: McLaren boss Ron Dennis criticised Formula Ones new safety car rules after an accident-strewn Canadian Grand Prix on Sunday. 

McLarens Lewis Hamilton won the race but Dennis was still unhappy with regulations that close the pit lane for the first lap after the safety car is deployed to allow all cars to bunch up. 

The rule change was designed to prevent drivers speeding up to get back to the pits for refuelling at a time when there is obvious danger on the track. The safety car was deployed four times at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on Sunday. 

I was genuinely frustrated by the impact of the safety car on our race. This is something that has been raised by the Grand Prix Drivers Association as being unfair on drivers because it is out of the teams control, Dennis told reporters. 

It is one of those changes that was made for good reasons but has had too much of a repercussion on this race and will have on other races. 

Meanwhile, Robert Kubica was released from hospital here on Monday, one day after a crash on Sunday left him with a slight concussion and sprained ankle. He hopes to be behind the wheel for Sundays race in Indianapolis. The Poles car went off the track on a turn on the 27th lap and smacked a wall head-on before sliding across the course.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Introduce rugby in schools: Coach

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Its high time that India should introduce the rugby at school level, with the sport being one of the disciplines at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi, said UK-based coach Nick Hyde. 

The 32-year-old Hyde who coached Furture Hope to emerge champions in the Calcutta Cup on Saturday, said the sport cannot grow in India unless introduced at the school level. 

Its hugely important to make the sport competitive at school level. In that way, street children and children from middle class families can come into the fray. This will give a huge impact at the Commonwealth Games, said Hyde who has taken a two-year sabbatical from London-based academy Harlequins. 

Hyde is associated with Future Hope, an NGO, which helps street children in the city. Having already coached in India for last two years, Hyde feels the rugby players in India are not strong enough to compete at international level.

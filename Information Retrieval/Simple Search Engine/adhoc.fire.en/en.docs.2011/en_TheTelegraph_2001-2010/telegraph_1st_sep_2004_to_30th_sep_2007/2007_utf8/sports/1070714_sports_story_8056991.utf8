The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Telegraph golf from Tuesday

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The seventh edition of The Telegraph Cup Golf will be played at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club from Tuesday to Friday. 

Begun in 1906, the tournament has evolved with time and now has been broken into two categories the Merchants Cup and Challenge Cup. 

The Merchants Cup will see 43 teams in action, while the number of participants for the Challenge Cup, introduced in 2000, is 30. 

We have more teams this year, so obviously there will be stiff competition. But were confident of retaining the Merchants Cup, said Jaydeep Chitlangnia, head of the tournament committee. 

He is a member Madhya Bharat Papers Ltd team, the defending champions. 

The scoring format for the meet will be a scratch stroke-play competition with players in different handicap categories being permitted to discard their poorest holes. 

Each team will consist of four players but not less than three. 

This year, individual prizes like the Colorplus Straight Drive, Adidas Straightest Drive and In the Kingfisher Zone will be up for grabs.

 Sasikiran in joint lead

Sofia: Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran put it across GM Michael Adams of England in the sixth round of the Mtel Masters chess tournament to move into joint lead. 

Playing white, Sasikiran punished an erratic Adams and romped home on a day that saw leaders facing a reversal of fortunes. 

Sasikiran used his white pieces effectively in a Queens Indian Defence game and won in 34 moves. 

Apart from Adams who was sole second before the start of sixth round, tournament leader GM Shakhriyar Mamedyarov was defeated by Gata Kamsky of the US, while former world champion Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria outplayed Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu of Romania. 

Sasikiran and Mamedyarov now share the lead on 3.5 points out of a possible six, while Adams is stuck on the third spot on three points with Topalov. Nisipeanu and Kamsky are at the bottom on 2.5 points each. 

Sasikiran opted for an age-old variation in the opening and the players blitzed out the moves in quick time. 

Nothing went right for Adams as he went for some unwarranted complication in an opening and Sasikiran quickly exploited the situation. 

In the 18th move, Adams made another error by going for an exchange sacrifice and for the remainder of the game, kept looking for the elusive compensation. 

With clinical maturity, Sasikiran showed the nerves of a champion. He thwarted all counterplay and coasted to a fine victory. (PTI)

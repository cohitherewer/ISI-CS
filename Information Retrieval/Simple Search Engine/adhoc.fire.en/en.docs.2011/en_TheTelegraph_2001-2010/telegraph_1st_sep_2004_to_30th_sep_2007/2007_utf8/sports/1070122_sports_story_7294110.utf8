London: Late goals by Robin van Persie and Thierry Henry gave Arsenal a thrilling 2-1 win over Manchester United on Sunday, shattering the visitors bid to open up a nine-point lead in the Premier League. 

A day after second-placed Chelsea lost 0-2 to Liverpool, England striker Wayne Rooney headed United into a 53rd minute lead that could potentially have decided the title race. 

But Van Persie came off the substitutes bench to score an 83rd-minute equaliser and captain Henry headed a stoppage-time winner. Victory completed a league double over United after Arsenals 1-0 win at Old Trafford in September. 

United, chasing their first league title since 2003, have 57 points after 24 games, Chelsea, champions for the last two seasons, have 51 points, Liverpool 46 and Arsenal 45. 

Arsenal, who flirted with their first defeat at their new Emirates Stadium, were ultimately rewarded for some relentless second-half pressure after getting off to a poor start. 

United seized the early initiative, with Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo and Henrik Larsson stringing passes through a hesitant Arsenal defence. 

Years of rivalry, along with the current title stakes, meant there were plenty of crunching tackles, with Arsenals Kolo Toure and Uniteds Ryan Giggs booked within 20 minutes.

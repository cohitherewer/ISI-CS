 Inzy: One of my biggest wins

Port Elizabeth: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq ranked his teams second Test victory over South Africa on Monday as among the most important of his tenure. 

Its not easy for teams from the sub-continent to win in South Africa, Inzamam said on Monday. Winning here and in Australia is very important for the boys, he said. Its one of my biggest wins as a captain. 

The match was Inzamams 118th Test, and his 11th victory in his 30th match as captain. Inzamam also praised his teams fighting qualities. 

Pakistan slumped to 92 for five after lunch before Younis Khan, who scored 67 not out, and keeper Kamran Akmal, who was unbeaten on 57, took the match away from South Africa with an unbroken stand of 99. 

We were under pressure, but Younis and Kamran Akmal played very well, he said. Especially Younis, who accepted the responsibility to finish the game. 

South African captain Graeme Smith said: When you get bowled out for 124 on the first day its going to be difficult, he said. We played some very good cricket to keep ourselves in the game for as long as we did. 

But Pakistan were ahead of from day one, and we really had to fight to stay in it.

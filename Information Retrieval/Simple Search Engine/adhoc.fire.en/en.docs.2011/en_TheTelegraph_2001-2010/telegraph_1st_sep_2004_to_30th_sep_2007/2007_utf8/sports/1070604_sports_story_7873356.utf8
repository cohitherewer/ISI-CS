 12 crushed to death

Lusaka (Zambia): A stampede killed 

 12 soccer fans and injured more than 40 in northern Zambia 

 as supporters left the stadium after Zambia beat Congo Brazzaville 

 in a key match late on Saturday, police said on Sunday. 

Copperbelt police chief Antonnell Mutentwa said 46 injured fans were admitted to hospital in Chililabombwe, a copper mining town bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo, 450km north of Lusaka. 

Mutentwa said fans trampled each other as they rushed to leave the stadium after Zambia beat Congo Brazzaville 3-0 in an African Cup qualifier. 

The cause of the stampede was not clear, but one witness said members of the crowd, larger than the stadiums capacity, crushed and trod on other fans as they rushed to catch free buses after the match. 

Sports minister Gabriel Namulambe said all but one of the injured had been discharged from hospital. A team of investigators would deliver a report on the incident by Friday. 

 He also said the state would help 

 families of the victims.

 European Tour meet in India

 - Asian body unhappy with decision 

 Jeev welcomes the fantastic news 

New Delhi: India will host a European Tour golf tournament for the first time next year, it was announced in Dubai on Monday. 

The $2.5 million Indian Masters is to be played in New Delhi from February 7-10. 

The tournament will be sanctioned by the European Tour and the Indian Golf Union, and will be the richest-ever held in the country. India currently hosts only one Asian Tour event, the Indian Open. 

The Indian Masters will be organised by Golf in Dubai, which promotes events like the Dubai Desert Classic and Dubai Ladies Masters. 

Jeev Milkha Singh, the highest ranked Indian golfer at No. 58, welcomed the news. This is just fantastic news for Indian golf, he said. I think it is also an acknowledgement of the superb results posted by Indian golfers across the globe. A tournament of this stature is sure to boost the growth of the game in the country. 

The growth of the Indian economy has coincided with the emergence of golf as a major sport in the country, European Tour chief executive George Grady said. 

We are always keen to expand our tournament portfolio into new territories and we believe that the Indian Masters offers huge potential on that front. 

Thanks to Indian pioneers such as Jeev Milkha Singh and Arjun Atwal, both popular champions on the European Tours international schedule along with Jyoti Randhawa and Shiv Kapur, professional golf in India has taken a massive step forward over the past decade. 

It is a historic moment for Indian golf, said Indian Golf Union president J.J. Singh. 

The event is the result of the growing status of the game in India, augmented by Indian performances across the golfing globe. 

The Asian Tour, however, is angry that the European Tour will stage the tournament without its approval, describing the move as unethical, adds a report from London. 

The Asian Tour is appalled by the European Tours plans to stage a tournament in India without the sanction of the Asian Tour, executive chairman Kyi Hla Han said in a statement on Monday. 

This move is clearly unethical and against the protocol that exists within the framework of the International Federation of PGA Tours, of which both tours are full members. 

Asian Tour is unhappy about the lack of consultation. There has been no approach or communication to inform the Asian Tour about the event or its intentions, said Han. 

Since the Asian Tour became a member of the International Federation, all new events the European Tour has been involved with in Asia have been co-sanctioned with the Asian Tour. 

This action reflects the European Tours aggressive direction without any concern for the protocol of the international federation and highlights an invasive position on Asia. (AGENCIES)

 Graded payments in football on the cards 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The AIFF is planning to introduce graded payments for national footballers, taking a cue from cricket. 

On Thursday, the AIFF president, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, met the Indian footballers in Gurgaon on the eve of the teams departure for Portugal and promised a gradation of payments for national players. 

I have been thinking about it for a long time. After the Portugal tour, I will sit down with you and the senior officials of the federation to take a final decision, Das Munshi told the players. 

At the moment, the AIFF has no uniform rule for the payment of national players. 

In the Gurgaon camp, the players have been paid Rs 12,000 each as pocket money. During the Portugal tour a daily allowance of $20 each will be given, while the AIFF takes care of all the other expenses including food and lodging. 

The 25-member Indian team, led by striker Bhaichung Bhutia, left for Portugal on Thursday for a three-match preparatory tour. The three matches will be played on July 22 (vs Recreio Desportivo de Agueda), July 26 (vs AC Marinhense) and July 29 (opponents yet to be finalised).

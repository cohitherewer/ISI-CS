 Proteas pile up 356/4

St Georges: AB de Villiers struck a brilliant maiden one-day century as South Africa powered to a commanding total of 356 for four in their World Cup Super Eight match against hosts West Indies on Tuesday. 

De Villiers innings of 146 leaves the West Indies facing a fourth successive defeat and near certain elimination from the competition after another lame bowling performance from Brian Laras side. 

The total is South Africas record tally in a World Cup match, surpassing the 353 they scored against 

The Netherlands in the group stage of this competition. 

The 23-year-old De Villiers put on a 170-run partnership for the second wicket with Jaques Kallis after skipper Graeme Smith went early, caught behind off Corey Collymore. 

On an ideal batting track and with a fast outfield, the pair rarely looked in trouble although Kallis was dropped by wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin when on 40. 

Showing intelligent shot selection and smart running between the wicket, the pair built up a momentum which a mediocre West Indian bowling attack was unable to interrupt until the damage had been done. 

Kallis eventually went for 81 and De Villiers went on to complete his century but, struggling with cramp, he was forced to take Smith as a runner.

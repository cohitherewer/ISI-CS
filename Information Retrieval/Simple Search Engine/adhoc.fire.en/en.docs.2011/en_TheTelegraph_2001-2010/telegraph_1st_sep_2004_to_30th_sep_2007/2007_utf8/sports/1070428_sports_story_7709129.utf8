 Murali wants to win it for strife-torn nation

Bridgetown: Its not for any personal or collective glory, Sri Lankan spin ace Muttiah Muralidharan wants to win the World Cup to apply balm on the wounds of his strife-torn motherland. 

A member of Sri Lankas 1996 World Cup winning team, Murali knows the value of such a triumph and is keen for an encore when his team locks horn with Australia in the final. 

It would be a bigger achievement than all my personal records. Team success is something we all strive for. It will act as an inspiration for youngsters and we being a team of different nationalities, it could also help tide over the problems our nation faces. 

We are going through a bad situation in our country but this could achieve something different, he said. 

Murali, however, knows that its not going to be a cakewalk Saturday. 

When we did it in 1996, I was very young and didnt know what it takes to win the World Cup. Now I know how tough it is to do it, said the ever-smiling Murali. 

The ace spinner doesnt see many similarities with the 1996 team. 

There is a fair bit of difference. In that World Cup, we needed to progress through the quarter final, semi-final to the final. In that sense, all the games were knock-out moments. 

We were also then a team which was very good in chasing down targets. In contrast, the present team has the strongest bowling attack ever assembled in a Sri Lankan team. 

Personally too, Murali, poised to become the highest wicket-taker in Test history in the near future, feels he has come a long way. 

 I was only 22 in 1996 and didnt know much about my craft. I did what I was asked to do and picked six or seven wickets. Its different now.

 Sania-Peer in quarters

Stanford: Third seeds Sania Mirza and Shahar Peer survived a scare from Tatiana Poutchek and Anastasia Rodionova to advance to the doubles quarter finals of the $600,000 Bank of West Classic tournament here. 

The Indo-Israeli pair came through 6-1, 0-6, 11-9 in over an hour against the unseeded Belarussian-Russian duo at the WTA Tour hard court event on Wednesday. 

Sania and Peer will now be up against the Uzbek-German team of Akgul Amanmuradova and Angalika Bachmann. 

Sania, who is aiming for a second successive doubles title after her triumph in Cincinnati with Bethanie Mattek last week, and Peer failed to convert two breakpoints in the third set which saw them being broken thrice. 

But, Sania and Peer got their act together in the super-tiebreaker to advance to the quarters.

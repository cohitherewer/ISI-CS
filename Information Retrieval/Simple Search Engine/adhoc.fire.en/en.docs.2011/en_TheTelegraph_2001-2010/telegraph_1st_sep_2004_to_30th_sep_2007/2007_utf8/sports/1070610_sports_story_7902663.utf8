 Six Indians make cut

Koh Samui (Thailand): Gurbaaz Mann and SSP Chowrasia stayed on course for a top-10 finish as they hung on despite their lacklustre performances in round three of the Bangkok Airways Open on Saturday. 

Mann shot a one-over par 72 for a total of two-under 211 for three rounds. The runaway leader after three rounds is Lee Sung of Korea who set a new course record of nine-under-par 62 for a seven-stroke lead. 

Six of the eight Indians in the fray made the cut. While Chowrasia and Mann were tied for 15th, Gaurav Ghei shot an even par round to be tied 22nd. Rahil Gangjee with a round 73 is tied 29th, while Digvijay Singh (70) was tied 35th and Arjun Singh (73) was tied 47th. (PTI)

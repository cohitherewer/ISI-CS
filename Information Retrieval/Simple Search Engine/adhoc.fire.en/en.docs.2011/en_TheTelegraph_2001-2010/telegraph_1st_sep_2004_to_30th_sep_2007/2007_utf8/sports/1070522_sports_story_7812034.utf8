 Surgery on Wednesday

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Manoj Tiwary will leave for London on Tuesday afternoon for an operation on his injured shoulder. 

The Cricket Association of Bengal president Prasun Mukherjee on Monday said that renowned orthopaedic surgeon Dr Andrew Wallace will operate on Tiwary at the King Edward VII Hospital in London on Wednesday at 11.30 am. 

Tiwary injured himself during training in Dhaka ahead of the ODI series. 

After consultation with Dr Anant Joshi in Mumbai where he was recommended arthroscopic surgery, Tiwary expressed a desire for a second opinion. Accordingly, he was examined by orthopaedic surgeon Dr Ronen Roy and physician Dr T.K. Banerjee in the city. The doctors recommended surgery by a specialist. Dr Roy personally spoke to Dr Wallace in London, who agreed to give his opinion after examining the MRI images. 

In his diagnosis, Dr Wallace said: There is a large detachment of the anterior labrum of the socket in his shoulder. This is unlikely to heal naturally and he should consider an arthroscopic stabilisation, a process in which the labrum is repaired using a keyhole approach 

It may be recalled that Dr Wallace had successfully operated on Sachin Tendulkar. 

According to Mukherjee, the entire expenses will be borne by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). I have spoken to BCCI president Sharad Pawar who felt that a promising player like him (Tiwary) should get the best possible treatment, the CAB president said. 

After the operation, Tiwary is expected to return on May 30. He will then undergo physiotherapy and rest for a period of eight to 12 weeks.

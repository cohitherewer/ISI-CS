 Doubt over Flintoff, Bopara

 Flintoff 

London: Injuries of star allrounder Andrew Flintoff and Ravi Bopara seem to be a major concern for hosts England as it may also hamper their chances of taking part in the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 starting in 10 days time. 

Flintoff has been bothered by a troublesome left ankle that forced him to miss the fifth one-dayer at Headingley while Bopara dislocated his right thumb in dropping a return catch from Gautam Gambhir during the India innings on Sunday. Bopara, however, had come out to bat in pain. 

Both Flintoff and Boparas fitness will be assessed on Tuesday at the Oval. 

Its a quick turnaround after the one-day series but they will both be gauged in the next couple of days and hopefully they are not as bad as they may seem at the moment, said England captain Paul Collingwood. 

Obviously the medical staff will assess them over the next couple of days and then make a decision. Ravi is in a little bit of pain but these things tend to be sore for 24 hours and we will assess it tomorrow. (PTI)

London: Israel held struggling England to a 0-0 draw and European champions Greece lost their lead and tumbled 1-4 to visiting Turkey in their qualifying matches for the Euro 2008 finals. 

England stay level on points with Israel but five behind group leaders Croatia, who beat Macedonia 2-1, and three behind Russia, who won 2-0 at Estonia. 

Despite remaining third in group E with seven games to go, both teams above England won and moved further ahead. 

Turkeys win left them three points clear of Greece in group C with 12 points from four matches. 

There was another upset in the group for all the wrong reasons as the Norway-Bosnia game in Oslo was halted shortly after it began when fans threw flares on to the field, some hitting players, while one set an advertising hoarding ablaze. 

The match resumed 30 minutes later after English referee Mike Riley took the players off the field. Bosnia eventually won 2-1 to move above Norway into third place behind Greece. In group D, Germany won 2-1 in the Czech Republic, while Ireland beat Wales 1-0. France and Scotland stayed neck and neck in group B and remained on course for the finals. France won 1-0 in Lithuania. 

Portugal routed Belgium 4-0, with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring a brace.

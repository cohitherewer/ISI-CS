 Agarkar keen to prove mettle

Montego Bay: Indian paceman Ajit Agarkar is looking forward to playing an important role in his third World Cup after the first two ended in disappointment. 

Agarkar, 29, played a minor part in 1999 and did not get a game four years later in South Africa. However, a good rhythm over the past season coming to the Caribbean has raised hopes for Agarkar after a career blighted by injuries and inconsistency. 

Try to play at least one game, that is the first goal, Agarkar said on Tuesday. It is nice to get another opportunity. 

When you play a World Cup as a 21-year-old you dont know whether you will get another opportunity, said the Mumbai player who had not quite lived up to his early promise as a durable bowling allrounder. 

Ive obviously gained a little more experience in the last three to four years, he said. The mindset towards the approach to bowling has also changed.

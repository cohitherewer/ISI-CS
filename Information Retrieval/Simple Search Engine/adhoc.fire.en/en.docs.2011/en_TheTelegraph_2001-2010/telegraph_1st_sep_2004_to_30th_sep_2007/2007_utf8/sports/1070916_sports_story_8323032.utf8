 Innings win for India A

New Delhi: Left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha claimed eight wickets to help India A win by an innings and 242 runs against South Africa A with a day to spare in their four-day cricket match at the Kotla here on Saturday. 

The Hyderabadi spinner took three wickets in the first innings and followed it up with a five-wicket haul to skittle out the visitors cheaply. 

Earlier, resuming at 93 for two, the Africans could add just 52 runs as Ojha and Amit Mishra took three wickets each to spin them out for a paltry 145 for nine as Alviro Petersen did not bat. 

Overnight batsmen M. van Wyk (67) and skipper Boeta Dippenaar (26) added 46 runs for the third wicket before Delhi paceman Ishant Sharma sent back Wyk, who was dropped on 64 by Pankaj Singh, to open the floodgates. 

No batsman reached the double figure mark after this, as African batsmen succumbed to spin magic of Ojha and Mishra. India A captain Mohammed Kaif applauded his team for the huge victory. 

We have been playing well for quite some time and did well in all departments. Badrinath, Pragyan (Ojha) and Aakash (Chopra) all performed well.

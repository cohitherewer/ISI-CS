 I havent had time to think of my future

 Inzamam-ul Haq after Pakistans loss on Saturday 

Kingston: Beleaguered captain Inzamam-ul Haq and coach Bob Woolmer refused to speculate about their future after Pakistan crashed out of the World Cup following a stunning defeat to Ireland. 

The subcontinent giants conceded their second straight loss on Saturday. Hosts West Indies handed them a 54-run defeat in the World Cup opener on Tuesday. 

I have not had time to think about my future, said Inzamam after his teams shock three-wicket defeat. 

I have other things on my mind right now. There are bound to be changes, but I do not know what they would be. 

On his World Cup career, which began with the 1992 triumph under Imran Khans captaincy, Inzamam said: Every player has to go one day and Ive had my innings. My departure hasnt gone very well but thats the name of the game. 

As far as a reception at home is concerned, I dont think we will have a welcome one, he said. 

Inzamam also praised Ireland for playing competitively and silencing the critics that felt ICC associate sides had no place in the World Cup. 

You are always under a lot of pressure when playing these countries because they really have nothing to lose, he said. 

Coach Bob Woolmer indicated his sides performance ranked pretty highly as one of the worse days of his life as a coach. 

I think the worse was at Edgbaston in 1999 (when he was South Africas coach in a losing semi-final to Australia), but I think its important to remember that this is a game and in a game, things like these happen, he said. 

I would like to sleep on my future as a coach, Woolmer said. Its what I do best, what I try to do best. Therefore Im not going to throw away coaching just like that. 

However, internationally, I will give it some thought. Travelling and being involved non-stop in hotels and so on takes its toll. 

Woolmer had no excuses to make about his sides performance. 

I think we had a good team, but we didnt play as well as we should have, or could have. 

Quite frankly, a lot of credit must be given to Ireland and a lot of credit should be given to the ICCs high performance programme. We deserve to take stick because we have not performed. 

This is a game of cricket, and everyone should try to remember this. We are sorry that we have performed in the way we have. We didnt mean to, but all credit to Ireland and good luck to them. 

Woolmer admitted the Sabina Park pitch was difficult, but Ireland bowled well and his team batted poorly. 

I thought it was a pitch that evened out the sides, and winning the toss was an important factor, he said after Pakistan were dismissed for 132. I still think we should have scored between 190 and 200 against Irelands attack, we worked really hard in the field and had hoped to bowl them out for 90. 

Ireland now eye a likely passage into the Super Eight stage and Pakistan have a game against Zimbabwe that will now be just for pride on Wednesday.

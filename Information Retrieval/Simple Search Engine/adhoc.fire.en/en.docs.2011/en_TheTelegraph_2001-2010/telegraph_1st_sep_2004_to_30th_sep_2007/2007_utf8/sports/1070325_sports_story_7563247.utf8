The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I feel Bobs loss more than our ouster

 Inzamam-ul Haq 

Basseterre: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq said on Friday he wanted to forget the traumatic World Cup campaign which saw coach Bob Woolmer being murdered the morning after the team got knocked out in the group league stage. 

Its been a tournament which I and millions of Pakistan supporters would like to forget, but that wont be easy, Inzamam said over telephone from Montego Bay. 

Pakistan lost their opening match to the West Indies by 54 runs before suffering an ignominous three-wicket defeat at the hands of debutants Ireland. They signed off with a consolation win over Zimbabwe. 

Woolmers death has become the subject of a murder investigation. The Pakistan team has been finger-printed and has had to provide DNA samples. 

Inzamam, who announced retirement from ODIs and said he wanted to play Tests in any capacity, said the suffering had become unbearable. 

We failed to reach the second round and lost a great mentor who was also an inspirational figure in the dressing room. I feel Bobs loss much more than our elimination. 

My heart goes out to his family and I want to assure them on behalf of the team and entire nation that in this tough time we are right behind them. I will leave the Caribbean for the last time (as a player) with a very heavy heart. 

Inzamam said the team was in a good frame of mind when they landed in the Caribbean, despite a poor build-up during which they lost key fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Asif and allrounder Abdul Razzaq due to fitness/injury problems. 

When I landed here, I had high hopes but things changed and became so tragic that we are still struggling to cope. Most of the guys are still in a state of shock and when I try to talk to them, I can see blank faces. 

They are there physically, not mentally. 

Inzamam, second behind Indias Sachin Tendulkar (14,847) on the all-time one-day run list with 11,739 runs, said his team is still a good unit. 

I still believe my team is good enough, but we just couldnt click. I am disappointed that we failed to live up to our supporters expectations and also for Bob who gave his heart and soul throughout his three years as coach, hoping that we could fulfil his dream of winning the World Cup. 

Inzamam believes Pakistan can recover from the World Cup trauma. 

Pakistan cricket is strong and I dont believe it is in a crisis. In fact, I believe we will get stronger from here because we have good cricketing brains and exceptionally talented players to put things back on track. 

The current Pakistan team has all the ingredients to beat any opposition. Its just a matter of getting our act together. Over the years, Pakistan cricket has faced several crisis and every time the team has come out of it successfully. 

Thats the beauty of Pakistan cricket. 

Inzamam said he didnt know his plans after retirement. 

I havent had a chance to think about my future because events have happened so fast. But looking back at my career, I think every match that I played was worth it. 

I had tough times, but it came in the package I guess. I had the honour of representing Pakistan for 16 years, the privilege of playing against some of the greatest players, being part of the 1992 World cup squad and most importantly the respect and appreciation of the people. 

I couldnt have asked for more. 

Inzamam also backed the decision continue the World Cup despite Woolmers death. 

The World Cup is a great event and should go on despite the tragedy because we cannot allow this sport to be held to ransom by anybody. Bob would have wanted his event to be a huge success and lets make him happy by supporting the competition.

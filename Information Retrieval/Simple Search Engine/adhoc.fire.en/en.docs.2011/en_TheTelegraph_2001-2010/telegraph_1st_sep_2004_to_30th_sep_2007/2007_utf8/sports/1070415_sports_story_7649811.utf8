 Ashraf appointment challenged again

Islamabad: As if having to deal with the leadership crisis in the Pakistan team was not enough, the PCB is now facing a legal battle over the appointment of its chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf, which has again been challenged in the Supreme Court. 

According to a newspaper report, an application seeking the restoration of a previous petition filed against Ashrafs appointment has been moved in the Supreme Court. 

The original petition, filed last month, was dismissed on April 2, but the counsel for the applicant has said the rejection was the result of a misunderstanding. 

We did not receive the intimation that the case was fixed for April 2 despite the fact that I was present that day at the Supreme Court in Islamabad, barrister Farooq Hasan told the paper. 

I even met the registrar at the Supreme Court in this connection and moved an application that why my case has not been fixed. He told me that he would look into the matter. But the case was called the same day and dismissed for non-appearance, he added. 

Farooq said he was hopeful of getting a proper hearing this time as the matter was of national improtance. 

This matter is very important and invokes the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. I hope the petition will be restored and we will be able to contest the appointment of Ashraf, he said. 

The petition seeks Ashrafs removal as chairman of the PCB on the grounds that he does not have the requisite experience to run it.

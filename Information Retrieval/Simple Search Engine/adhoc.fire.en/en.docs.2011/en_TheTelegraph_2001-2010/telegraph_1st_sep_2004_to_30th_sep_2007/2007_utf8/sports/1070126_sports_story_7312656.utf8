The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Eden may get Pune one-dayer

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Barely 24 hours after it was confirmed that Prasun Mukherjee would be the unanimous choice for the CAB presidents post, the BCCI suggested that Eden Gardens host the opening one-dayer against Sri Lanka, originally slated to be held in Pune, on February 8. 

While the CAB was informed that it was their turn (on the basis of the rotation policy) to host a match after Pune was facing logistical problems, there was an unusual coincidence in its timing. The change of guard at the CAB helm, however, had not prompted the offer. 

The city police commissioner had lost to Jagmohan Dalmiya at the CAB annual general meeting in July last. Dalmiya, who has been expelled by the BCCI, has resigned as CAB president since. 

The BCCIs tour, programme and fixtures committee chairman Shashank Manohar called up Mukherjee Thursday morning, and asked him if CAB could stage the ODI at such short notice. 

CAB joint secretary Saradindu Pal said that the BCCI would send the letter of request by Friday. But the decision to stage the match must be ratified by the working committee, and an emergent meeting will be held on Saturday. 

According to the rotation policy, Eden was supposed to get a match after these two series (West Indies and Sri Lanka), and so will be eligible if Pune fail to stage it, Pal said. 

BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah told The Telegraph: The final decision will be taken tomorrow after a round of discussion.

Mumbai: Piyush Chawla has been ruled out of the seven-match ODI series against Australia starting September 29 in Bangalore. 

Chawla is out of the ODI series against Australia. But we will wait for some more time, may be till the team returns from South Africa, before naming a replacement, chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar said.

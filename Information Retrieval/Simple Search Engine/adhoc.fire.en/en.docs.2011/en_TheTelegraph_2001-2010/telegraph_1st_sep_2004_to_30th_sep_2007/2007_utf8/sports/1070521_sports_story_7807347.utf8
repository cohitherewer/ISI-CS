 Top-10 finish beckons Randhawa

Adare Manor: Jyoti Randhawa came close to yet another top-10 finish this season as he surged to tied 12th despite returning a one-over 73 in the penultimate round of the Irish Open here. 

Randhawa, at three over 219 with rounds of 76, 70 and 73 is seven shots behind local hero Padraig Harrington, who is bidding to become the first Irish to win this event in 25 years. 

Randhawa made a poor start and dropped a shot on the second hole followed by a double bogey on the par-five seventh hole. He rallied from there with birdies on ninth, 12th and 15th and looked set for a top-10 position, before stumbling to a bogey on the 17th. 

Shiv Kapur, meanwhile, dropped eight shots over his last six holes, six of which came in last three. He ended with a triple bogey. 

Harrington remained on course to end the 25-year wait since John Leary after moving three shots ahead of the field on Saturday. (AGENCIES)

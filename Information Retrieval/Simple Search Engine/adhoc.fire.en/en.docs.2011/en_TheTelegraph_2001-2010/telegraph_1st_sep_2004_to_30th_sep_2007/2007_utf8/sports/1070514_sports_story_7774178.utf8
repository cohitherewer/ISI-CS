 Akram starts camp

Karachi: The iconic Wasim Akram on Sunday started a two-week coaching stint with the Pakistan Cricket Board and asked fans to be patient with the national team after the World Cup debacle. 

What happened in the World Cup was regrettable and disappointing. But its history and we must look ahead. Pakistan still have a lot of talent but we have to be patient and give them time to settle down, the former captain said. 

Akram, who has largely been dissociated with Pakistan cricket since retiring in 2003, is conducting a coaching camp for fast bowlers and opening batsmen with former Test player Mudassar Nazar, who is also the head of the National Cricket Academy in Lahore. 

I see this assignment as an opportunity to give something back to Pakistan. It has always been my desire to work with young players and help them improve their skill and trade, the iconic former fast bowler said. 

The PCB has picked some young pacers and openers for a two-week crash course, part of a rebuilding process after a disastrous World Cup. 

Akram supported Inzamam-ul Haqs decision to step down but refused to comment on the senior pros insistence to continue playing Tests at the age of 37. 

Every player, no matter how great he is, has to go. Inzamam has also played his innings for Pakistan. It is a natural process but there is no doubt he was one of the great batsmen, he said.

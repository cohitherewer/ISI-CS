 Bangla, Pak doors still open for Dav 

Dhaka/Karachi: Dav Whatmore may have been rejected by India, but the Australian still has options to explore. 

While Bangladesh authorities have said they are open to the idea of Whatmores return, Pakistan have also focused their attention on him. 

Our door is still open to Whatmore. He is a great coach and the team has improved a lot during his four-year tenure, BCB general secretary Mahbub-ul Anam said in Dhaka on Wednesday. 

Pakistan have shown renewed interest in Whatmore. We have always been interested in Whatmore but he had not responded positively We will make a fresh approach, a PCB official said.

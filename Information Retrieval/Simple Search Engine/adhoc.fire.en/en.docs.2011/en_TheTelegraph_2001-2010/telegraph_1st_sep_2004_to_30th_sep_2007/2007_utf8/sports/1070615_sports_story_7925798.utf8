 Beckham firm on leaving Real

 Thursday

Madrid: David Beckham clarified on Thursday that Real Madrids failure to offer him a contract renewal was behind his decision to leave the nine-time European champions and sign for MLS side LA Galaxy. 

I first realised I would be leaving Real Madrid six months ago in January when I was told my contract wouldnt be renewed, the 32-year-old former England captain said on Thursday. 

That was the time when I knew I had to decide my future. Leaving a club like Real is very difficult but I think my future is bright and its something Im really looking forward to now. 

Real have said they were in the process of offering Beckham a new contract when he decided to sign his $250 million deal with Galaxy, but the former Manchester United midfielder said the offer had never materialised. 

Beckham also said that contrary to club president Ramon Calderons recent statements, he had not been approached by Real to persuade him to stay and denied there was an escape clause by which he could back out of the Galaxy deal. 

Ive had no contact with the president about anything, he said. The contract was signed a few months back, everyone knows when I signed it. My last game will be on Sunday. 

There is no clause with Los Angeles saying it could be changed. Ive played for Real Madrid for four years. It has been an incredible time. Hopefully, it will end with winning the league. But this is it. 

A somewhat nervous-looking and red faced Beckham, who will win his first title with Real if they beat Real Mallorca at the Bernabeu on Sunday, refrained from direct criticism of the club. 

But he made it clear he believed that his lack of games in the first part of the season and the decision to ostracise him after the announcement of his departure to LA were based on club politics rather than his performances on the pitch. 

I definitely agree that there was more to it than the manager, but Im not going to criticise Fabio Capello because I have too much respect for him as a person and as a manager. 

Beckham said this season was even harder to cope with than the aftermath of his sending off for England in the 1998 World Cup after kicking out at Argentinas Diego Simeone. 

 It has been possibly the 

 toughest season of my career on and off the field, 

 he said. After 1998 it was difficult, but this season 

 Ive gone through things that I never thought were 

 possible.

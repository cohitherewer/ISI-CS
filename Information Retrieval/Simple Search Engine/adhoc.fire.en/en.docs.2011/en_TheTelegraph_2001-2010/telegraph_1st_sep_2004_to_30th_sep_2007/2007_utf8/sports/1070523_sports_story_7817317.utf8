 The key men

AC MILAN 

KAKA (25): Brazilian Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite, better known Kaka, suffered a serious spine injury in a swimming pool when he was 18, but went on to become one of worlds best midfielders. Having scored three goals in the semi-final against Manchester United, Kaka is expected to be the focal point of Milan attack. Widely believed to be worlds best footballer at the moment, Kaka is immensely skilful, a great opportunist and has a tremendous big-match temperament. 

ANDREA PIRLO (28): A defensive midfielder, Pirlo is an accurate passer. His game is focused around his ability to dictate play and control the tempo. He is not physically strong but compensates with his technique. In free-kicks, he is lethal. A specialist in this section, Pirlo, who boasts of the World Cup under his belt, is certainly the best in business in Europe. Thrice named Man of the Match in the World Cup, Pirlo could a key factor in Milans endeavour. 

LIVERPOOL 

STEVEN GERRARD (27): Captain Gerrard is one of Liverpools main hopes. An inspirational and versatile midfielder known for his long-range shots and trademark defence-splitting passes, Gerrard is a man of tremendous energy and can play box to box football. In 2005 final, he was the man who inspired Liverpools great comeback. Unafraid to commit himself to hard tackles, he controls the middle of the pitch and picks up strikers with brilliant long-ball passes. For the Liverpool faithful, Gerrard is the man. 

JAMIE CARRAGHER (29): Considered by many as the best natural defender in England, Carragher is a long-time Liverpool faithful. He is fiercely determined, has a do or die attitude on the field, but off the pitch extremely humble in nature. In the final against Milan his experience will be in great demand. He often joins the attack from central defence. Milan should be wary of him.

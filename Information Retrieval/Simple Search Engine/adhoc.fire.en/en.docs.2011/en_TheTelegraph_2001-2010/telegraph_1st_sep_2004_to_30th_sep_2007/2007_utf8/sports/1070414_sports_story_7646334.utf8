 McCullum fined

St Georges: New Zealand wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum has been fined 20 percent of his match fee for showing dissent in the World Cup Super Eight loss to Sri Lanka on Thursday. 

McCullum lingered at the crease after he was given out, lbw to Muttiah Muralidharan for one and was clearly unhappy with the decision. New Zealand went on to lose by six wickets. 

At a hearing held after the game, Match Referee Mike Procter found McCullum to have breached 1.3 of the ICCs Code of Conduct which relates to quot;showing dissent at an umpires decision by action or verbal abuse quot;. 

The wicketkeeper-batsman pleaded guilty to the charge and apologised to the umpires during the hearing. (Agencies)

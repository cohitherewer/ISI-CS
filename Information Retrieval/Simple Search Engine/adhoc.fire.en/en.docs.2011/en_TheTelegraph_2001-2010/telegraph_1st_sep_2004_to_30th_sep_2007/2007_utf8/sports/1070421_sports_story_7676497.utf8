 Stage set for Lara swansong 

 Michael Vaughan and Andrew Strauss during practice 

Bridgetown: The West Indies captain Brian Lara will bid an emotional farewell to international cricket on Saturday when he plays his final match before retiring against England at Kensington Oval. 

The last game of the World Cup Super Eight had looked to be a meaningless affair, with both sides having failed to make the semi-finals, but Laras surprise decision to quit on Thursday has transformed the occasion. England coach Duncan Fletcher will also stand down after Saturdays match. 

Lara had already announced he was quitting ODIs at the end of the World Cup but had been expected to lead the side on the tour of England which begins in May. 

Fletcher has been in charge nearly eight years. His finest moment came in 2005 when England beat old enemy Australia 2-1 at home to win the urn for the first time since 1987. England may decide to give some of their fringe players a game on Saturday with bowlers Stuart Broad and Liam Plunkett and allrounder Jamie Dalrymple coming into contention.

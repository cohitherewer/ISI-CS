The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Hope its not a tear, says Sourav

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Bangalore: Former captain Sourav Ganguly is keeping fingers crossed. 

I hope its not a tear... Whatever, Ive got to wait for the scan tomorrow (Sunday) morning, Sourav told The Telegraph, shortly after returning to the Grand Ashok. 

Sourav went off in the 27th over of the opening ODI, on Saturday, after pulling his right hamstring while sprinting. 

Im undergoing treatment, but things will only be clear after the scan... Lets hope for the best... If its not a tear, I may just have to miss the next ODI (Kochi, on Tuesday), he added. 

At 35, Souravs the oldest member of this ODI squad. 

Incidentally, Australias regular captain Ricky Ponting is recovering from a hamstring injury during the World Twenty20. Apparently, Robin Uthappa also has a hamstring problem. 

The teams, by the way, leave for Kochi on Sunday evening.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Wenger unlikely to be disloyal

RUSSELL KEMPSON

 Arsene Wenger 

Arsne Wenger will not remember last season with fondness. Not only did his Arsenal team fail to win a trophy, but the normally placid Frenchman frequently lost the plot on the touchline, berating match officials and incurring the wrath of the FA. It was a stain on the most thoughtful of characters, an unpleasant if rare blemish, but what Wenger is not is disloyal. 

It is why, despite the turmoil that will inevitably cascade round the Emirates Stadium after Thierry Henrys departure this weekend, Wenger is unlikely to tread the same path to the Nou Camp. 

Not yet, anyway. Wenger is a firm believer that his word is his bond and that, even in the hypocritical world of football, he can be trusted. He has one year remaining on his contract and, as he has repeatedly stated, he will honour it. 

Barcelona may have found it easy to tempt Henry for one last big payday, but they will find it nigh on impossible to do the same with his French compatriot. Wenger has laboured long and hard since moving to Highbury from Japan in September 1996, he has a job to finish and it is unlikely to be concluded until May 2008. 

Then and only then the gloves will be off. What happens after his contract is up? Nigel Winterburn, the former Arsenal left-back, asked. I can assure you, a lot of clubs will be desperate to take him. 

Wenger could stay. Many times in the past, it has been mooted that he could end his career with a stint in the boardroom. Yet that was before David Dein, the vice-chairman, departed suddenly this year. 

It was Dein, the chief powerbroker at Arsenal, who identified the talent of Wenger and persuaded him to leave the Far East. It was Dein who forged a strong working and personal relationship with Wenger as the media and many supporters continued to ask: Arsne who? And it was Dein who left a huge void when he fell out with Peter Hill-Wood, the chairman, and headed for the exit. 

 To say that Wenger had lost his 

 soul brother would not overemphasise Deins importance 

 in the running of the club. That he sided with Stan Kroenke 

 the American billionaire, who now owns more than 12 per 

 cent of the shares and is reported to be considering a takeover 

 was his undoing.

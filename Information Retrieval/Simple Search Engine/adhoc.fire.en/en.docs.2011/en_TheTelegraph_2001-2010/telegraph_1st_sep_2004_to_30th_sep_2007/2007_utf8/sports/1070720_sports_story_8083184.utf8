 Bopanna sails into quarters

New Delhi: Rohan Bopanna came back from the brink of defeat to post a three-set win and reach the singles quarter finals of the $25,000 ATP Challenger mens tennis event in Manchester on Thursday. 

Bopanna saved two match points at 4-5 in the decider, on his way to a thrilling 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (6) victory against Dominik Meffert of Germany in the second round. 

The 27-year-old had lost at the same stage the last time he played in the event in 2005. 

Earlier this week, Rohan Bopannas hope to pocket back-to-back ATP challenger doubles title was crushed as his partner Pablo Cuevas and he faltered in the final match of the Siemens Open tennis tournament in Scheveningen, Holland.

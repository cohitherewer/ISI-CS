The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Virk has a busy day

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: N.S. Virk, the International Cricket Councils regional security officer for India and Sri Lanka, met CAB president Prasun Mukherjee, who is also the city police commissioner, at the Eden on Thursday. 

Virk is carrying a picture of a suspected bookie, who is believed to be overseas. 

This is part of the Anti-Corruption Units co-ordination process with the local authorities and assumes greater significance in the light of the Marlon Samuels issue. 

It is learnt that the ICC is likely to send a special investigation team to look into the Nagpur affair, involving Samuels.

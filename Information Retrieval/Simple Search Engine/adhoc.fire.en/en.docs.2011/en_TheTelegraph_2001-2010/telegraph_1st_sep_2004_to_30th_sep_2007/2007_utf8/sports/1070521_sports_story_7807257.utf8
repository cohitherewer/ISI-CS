 India, Bangla weigh options

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chittagong: In case Bangladeshs proposed tri-series in India fails to materialise, the BCCI may send its team to play a tri-series in Bangladesh, with Pakistan being the third team. The matter came up for discussion at a meeting between the Sharad Pawar-led BCCI delegation and Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) officials here. 

We are planning to invite Bangladesh to India. If this doesnt happen, India may feature in a tri-series in Bangladesh It can take place either in 2008 or 2009, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said before heading home. 

When contacted, BCB secretary Mahbabul Anam said the proposal came from his guests. 

India have a busy international calendar in the next couple of years. We have to see how best adjustments can be made in the already chalked out programme, he said. 

India are scheduled to play a tri-series in Bangladesh in February-March next year. Anam, however, didnt confirm if Pakistan would replace South Africa for that tournament.

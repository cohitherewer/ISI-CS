The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Vijay crosses 1000-win mark 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: It was the victory of Dramatikos in Saturdays opener, the 1,600m Aazish Handicap which fulfilled trainer Vijay Singhs cherished dream of saddling 1000 winners. The trainers milestone, in fact, was the focus of attention during the felicitation ceremony, making the Calcutta Champions Sprint Trophy a stellar event. As expected, it was lifted by the hot-favourite, Romantic Fire.

 Vijay was ecstatic when presented with a memento for his achievement. He thanked everyone, barring the Fourth Estate.

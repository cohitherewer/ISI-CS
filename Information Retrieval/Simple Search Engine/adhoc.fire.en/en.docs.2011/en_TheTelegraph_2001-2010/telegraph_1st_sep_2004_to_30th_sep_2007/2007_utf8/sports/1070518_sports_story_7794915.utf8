 Centurion Cook dominates Day I

 Alastair Cook in action on Thursday 

London: Alastair Cook hit 102 not out to steer England to 200 for three at stumps Thursday on the opening day of the first Test against the West Indies. 

Playing in just his 15th Test, Cooks fifth hundred anchored Englands innings after Daren Powell had taken two wickets in five balls after lunch with Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip in attendance. 

The 22-year-old Cook hit 10 fours from 173 balls in more than four hours at the crease at Lords. 

He shared stands of 88 with stand-in captain Andrew Strauss, 59 with Kevin Pietersen and an unbroken 38 with Paul Collingwood in a day punctuated by four delays due to bad light or rain. 

Cook, who scored 104 not out on debut at India in March 2006, scored two Test hundreds against Pakistan last year and another in the following 0-5 Ashes defeat to Australia. 

Powell was the pick of the bowlers with two for 52 in 18 overs and Corey Collymore one for 60 in 19, while Devon Smith took three catches in three different fielding positions. 

West Indies captain Ramnaresh Sarwan had won the toss and sent England in to bat under a gloomy sky that promised to help swing bowling after a 30-minute delay due to persistent light rain. 

Thirteen balls after lunch with two runs added to his score, Strauss on 33 drove at a delivery from Powell and scooped a catch to Smith at backward point to leave England on 88 for one. 

Owais Shah, playing in only his second Test after scoring 88 on his debut against India in March 2006, was hit on the back of the head while on 0 by an errant throw from Jerome Taylor. 

Soon after, Shah edged an outswinger from Powell to Smith at third slip, and England was 103 for two in the 29th over.

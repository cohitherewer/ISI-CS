 Anand leads in rapid

 Viswanathan Anand 

Mainz: Viswanathan Anand displayed top form in the familiar rapid chess territory and scored two fine wins to emerge the sole leader after the first day of the Mainz Chess Classic rapid chess tournament underway here. 

After his mixed results leading to a second-spot finish in the Chess 960 World Championship, Anand was in his elements in the version he likes best and made a strong case of winning the title for the 10th time here. 

The Indian ace defeated Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan and Levon Aronian of Armenia before signing off for the day with a draw with Etienne Bacrot of France. 

While Anand, with on 2.5 points in his kitty, got off to a flier, Bacrot and Aronian now follow him a full point behind with 1.5 points apiece. Kasimdzhanov is on just half a point with only a little chance of staging a comeback. 

In the Finet Chess 960 Open tournament, Viktor Bologan of Moldova emerged clear first tallying 9.5 points out of a possible 11. 

Among the Indians, Krishnan Sasikiran emerged as the best performer on 8.5 points while P. Harikrishna got 7.5 points in all. Worlds youngest Grandmaster Parimarjan Negi won the best under-14 award on 7 points. 

All these players will now reappear in the Ordiz Open rapid tournament. 

Playing white in the first game against Kasimdzhanov, Anands Ruy Lopez turned into a structure akin to the Sicilian wherein the Indian sacrificed a pawn to establish a permanent knight in the centre. 

The Uzbek was saddled with a bad black-squared bishop and was gradually pushed to the wall with his weak pawn structure. 

With less time on the clock Kasimdzhanov could not defend against the increasing pressure, and in the end his bishop was trapped. 

Aronian, meanwhile, won a nice game against Bacrot in Round 1. The Frenchman went for unwarranted complications and had to pay dearly. 

In the second round, Anand had white against Aronian and yet again displayed top technique.

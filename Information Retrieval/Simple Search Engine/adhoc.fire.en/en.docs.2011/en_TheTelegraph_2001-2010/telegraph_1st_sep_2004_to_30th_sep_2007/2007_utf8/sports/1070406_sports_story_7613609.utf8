Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutia turned out to be Mohun Bagans saviour as he scored a last-gasp goal to help his team hold defending champions Mahindra United 1-1 in the 12th round match of the ONGC National Football League at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. The India captain equalised Pomeyie Mensahs 56th-minute strike. 

Having missed many gilt-edged chances, Bhutia found the target in the 94th minute, bringing a sense of relief to the under-pressure coach Chima Okerie and, also to some extent, the East Bengal camp. 

Mahindra United, having dropped two crucial points, are now on 23 from 12 matches, but the title-race is very much open now with Dempo (20) and East Bengal (19 from 12 matches) are breathing down the neck of the reigning champions. No doubt, East Bengal coach Carlos Roberto Pareira, who came to watch the match, returned a satisfied man. 

With both teams sharing possession of the ball, a brilliant cross from Yusif Yakubu led to the breakthrough the visitors were looking for. Mohun Bagan goalie Shilton Paul couldnt read the trajectory of the ball and allowed it to drop in front of Mensah. The Ghanaian striker had no difficulty in pushing the ball in. 

Undaunted by the setback, Mohun Bagan went on the offensive. But they left the job unfinished till Bhutias opportunism.

 Federer, Nadal under fire

Rome: James Blake and Andy Roddick have taken exception to Roger Federer and Rafael Nadals defence of the Monte Carlo Masters. 

Last month, Federer and Nadal held a press conference in Monte Carlo to declare that the ATP is moving too fast with its plan to restructure the 2009 calendar. 

The ATP wants to trim the Masters schedule from nine to eight tournaments by cutting Monte Carlo and Hamburg and adding Shanghai. I agree the tour does need to listen to its players but I think we need to do that behind closed doors instead of just airing it out in front of everyone, Blake said on the eve of the Rome Masters, on Sunday. 

If it gets to a desperation point then maybe we have to use the media and get your point out that way, Blake said. But I really dont think were at that desperation point yet, especially since were dealing with the 2009 calendar. 

Federer, Nadal, Nikolay Davydenko and Tommy Robredo are among the players who have signed a petition opposing the ATP reform proposals. 

Neither Blake nor Roddick played at Monte Carlo this year. What no one is talking about is the finances of it, Roddick said. This is not a knock on (Monte Carlo). The tournament is amazing. Its the most beautiful stadium we have. (AP)

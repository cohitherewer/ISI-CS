 Woods reveals rare vulnerability

 - For the first time in his career, the world No.1 has finished second in two consecutive Majors

When Tiger Woods tapped in for par Sunday on the final hole at Oakmont Country Club, his work in the 107th US Open was not finished. It is protocol for the runner-up to return to the 18th green for the trophy presentation, and Woods and Jim Furyk, who tied for second, were asked to help fill the background of bodies flanking the champion, ngel Cabrera. 

Woods clapped his hands and made small talk with Furyk as Cabrera hugged his prize as if it were a teddy bear. Finishing second is never fun, he said after the round. 

For the first time in his career, Woods has posted second-place finishes in consecutive Majors. In a golf year past its midpoint, Woods could face difficulty in adding to his career haul of Majors, which stands at 12, still six behind the legendary Jack Nicklauss record total. 

The British Open at Carnoustie Golf Links begins July 19. But Woodss presence at the tournament is not certain because his wife, Elin, gave birth early Monday to their first child, a daughter named Sam Alexis Woods. 

I dont know how much Im going to play after that or how much Im going to play before that, he said of the birth about two weeks ago. A lot of that is depending on what happens and the health of Elin and our child. 

The PGA Championship presents another challenge. It begins on August 9 in Tulsa, Okla, at Southern Hills Country Club, a narrow course filled with doglegs where Woods finished tied for 12th in the 2001 US Open. 

Woodss recent stretch in the Majors reveals at least some vulnerability for a player ranked No. 1 in the world. 

His back-to-back runner-up finishes at the Masters and the Open put him in company with the games greatest champions and some of its hard-luck cases. 

Greg Norman, whose Hall of Fame career was peppered with near misses in Majors, finished second in the 1986 PGA Championship and the 1987 Masters. Ernie Els, sometimes referred to as a modern-day Norman, was the runner-up in three majors in a row the 2000 Masters, the US Open and the British Open. 

Even golfs icons have been back-to-back bridesmaids. 

Tom Watson, an eight-time Major champion, finished second at the 1978 PGA and the 1979 Masters. And Nicklaus was often seen shaking the victors hand. He finished second at the 1964 British Open and the PGA Championship, the 1968 US and the British Opens, and the 1971 Masters and the US Open six of his record 19 runner-up finishes in Majors. 

In pursuing of Nicklauss record, Woods has been 12 for 12 when going into the final round with at least a share of the 54-hole lead. But that accomplishment has its opposite, as well he is 0 for 29 when trailing going into the final 18 holes. 

I havent gotten it done, he said Sunday. Put myself there and havent gotten it done. 

At Augusta National Golf Club in the final round, with the little-known Zach Johnson making birdies in front of him, Woods made an eagle on the 13th hole but stalled to lose by two shots. 

On Sunday, with Cabrera grinding out birdies, pars and two late bogeys, Woods closed with a bogey and seven pars and lost by a shot. 

During the third round, Woods hit 17 of 18 greens in regulation and 9 of 14 fairways in a round of 69 that would have been lower if not for several missed birdie putts. 

The final round and most of the championship was similar for Woods. 

I certainly played well all week, he said. I just need to analyse it and see where I went right and see what went wrong. 

So for two Majors in a row, Woods has had to watch someone else stand where he has so often basked in adulation.

 Kaka not to be sold to Real

Rome: AC Milans Brazilian playmaker Kaka will not be sold to Real Madrid, the European champions said again on Tuesday. 

Transfer speculation in Spain and Italy has linked Kaka with a move to Real despite repeated declarations by Milan that the player is not for sale. 

Earlier this month, Milan said Kakas father had held a meeting with Real Madrid. 

Ive asked Pedrag Mijatovic (Reals sporting director) to drop this business about Kaka. Ive told him enough is enough in a polite way of course, vice-president Adriano Galliani was quoted as saying on Milans website. 

Kaka will absolutely be staying in Milan. He has a contract and I believe he is happy to be in Milan. Certainly, these things are disturbing, but its proof that we have got the best player in the world.

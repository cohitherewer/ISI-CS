 Mumbai rally from 0/5

 Irfan Pathan

Vadodara: India discard Irfan Pathan roared back to form as he and Rakesh Patel rocked Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy semi-final here on Wednesday. 

Pathan and Patel reduced Mumbai to a catastrophic none for five before Vivek Samants unbeaten 51 helped the visitors reach 109 for seven at stumps on Day 2. 

At the end of an eventful day, which saw 17 wickets tumbling, Mumbai were 200 runs in front. 

Baroda, having bowled out Mumbai for 233 in the first innings on Day 1, were themselves in trouble while batting and were dismissed for a paltry 142. The only resistance came from Yusuf Pathan, who hit a fighting 70. Yusufs younger brother Irfan then took three for 39 and Patel four for 27 to counter-punch Mumbai. 

Five Mumbai batsmen failed to get off the mark as as the second innings scoreboard of the 36-time Ranji winners read zero for five in 3.2 overs. 

Pathan had Sahil Kukreja caught by Rajesh Pawar in the fourth ball of the first over. Patel had Wasim Jaffer caught-behind in his next over. 

Pathan then struck twice in his following over. Hiken Shah was caught by Satyajit Parab, while Rohit Sharma was trapped leg-before. Patel followed it up by dismissing captain Amol Muzumdar. 

Baroda resumed in the morning at nine without loss, and collapsed like a pack of cards. They were 63 for six at one stage. 

Mota was the most successful bowler with three for 15.

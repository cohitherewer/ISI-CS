 Vettori vote for mentally sharp teams

Johannesburg: New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori said that mentally sharp teams would have an advantage in the tournament. 

Theres not a lot of time to think but I think the guys who are able to predict scenarios in the game and also to think pretty quickly will play a role, Vettori said, ahead of New Zealands ICC World Twenty20 opener against Kenya on Wednesday. 

The clock is running the whole time because you have to get your overs in, so the ability to stay on top of the game is going to be important, he said. 

According to Vettori, Australia are everyones favourites. I would say they are the favourites and then you can throw a blanket around the rest. (Agencies)

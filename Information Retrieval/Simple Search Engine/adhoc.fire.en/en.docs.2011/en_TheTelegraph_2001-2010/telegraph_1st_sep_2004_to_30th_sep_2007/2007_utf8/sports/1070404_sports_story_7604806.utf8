 Younis ready to lead, on his terms

 Younis Khan 

Karachi: Younis Khan has agreed to take over as Pakistan captain, but on his terms. 

According to PCB sources, Younis met PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf Monday night and had a detailed discussion over captaincy and the future of the national team. 

The sources said he told Ashraf he was ready to accept the responsibility. 

Younis said he had no problems captaining the side, but PCB officials should be fully aware of certain things. Younis made it clear that he would speak his mind if he felt any player was not giving his 100 per cent or if the team was not responding to the captain, the source said. 

He told Ashraf the PCB should keep this in mind as he would not compromise when it came to the national teams performance, the source disclosed. (PTI)

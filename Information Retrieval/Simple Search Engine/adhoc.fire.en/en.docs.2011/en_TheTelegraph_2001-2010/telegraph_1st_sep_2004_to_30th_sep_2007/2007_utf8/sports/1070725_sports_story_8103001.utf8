The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Gordon model to be followed

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: A mental toughness programme with National Cricket Academy (NCA) sports doctor Kinjal Suratwala will kick off the season for Bengal players on Friday. Dr Suratwala, who has been associated with Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) for the last 17 years, will deliberate on Ideal Performance State (IPS) and how to achieve it during his four-day stint. 

Developed by sports psychologist Dr Sandy Gordon, who had worked with Team India during the Sourav Ganguly-John Wright era, the programme has been slightly modified to suit the Indian psyche, Dr Suratwala told The Telegraph from Mumbai. 

Well cover four of the seven aspects of the programme which is also used at the NCA and zonal academies. To help youngsters identify with our grades, weve included batting clips from the likes of Sachin Tendulkars and Sourav Gangulys. 

Stressing the need for a mental skill coach on a consultancy basis, he added: Indian cricketers are quite talented. However, we need to develop two aspects physical and mental. 

The board has already taken steps to develop the physical aspect Rainas and Karthiks are the examples. The area that needs to be taken care of is psychology. If given inputs at the right age, it will help in handling pressure, setting up goals and belief in oneself. 

Dr Suratwala is arriving on Thursday.

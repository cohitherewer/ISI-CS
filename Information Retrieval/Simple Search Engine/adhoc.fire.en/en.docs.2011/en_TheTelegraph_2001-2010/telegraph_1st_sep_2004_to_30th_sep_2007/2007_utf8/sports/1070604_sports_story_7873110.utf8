 Team Paes survives a scare

Paris: Leander Paes and Meghann Shaughnessy survived a scare but Sania Mirza and Fabrice Santoro were knocked out of the mixed doubles at the French Open on Sunday. 

Paes and American Shaughnessy played well in patches but managed to beat Marcin Matkowski of Poland and Sybille Bammer of Austria 6-2, 0-6, 10-8 to advance to the quarter finals. 

Sania and Santoro were not so lucky as Katernia Srebotnik of Slovakia and Nenad Zimonjic of Serbia snuffed out their late challenge to win 6-2, 7-6 (7-1) in a second-round tie. 

The defeat marked the end of Sanias campaign at the clay court Grand Slam. 

The 20-year-old Hyderabadi girl was already out of the singles and doubles events. 

While Sania lost in Round II in singles, she failed to cross the opening round hurdle in doubles.

 Aussie selection process questioned

 Katichs omission from CAs 25 contracted players has angered NSW officials 

Melbourne: Simon Katichs surprise omission from the Cricket Australias list of 25 contracted players has prompted outrage from his state with a senior New South Wales official questioning the credibility of the selection process. 

Simon Katich continues to be one of the best performed batsmen in Australian first-class and one-day cricket and his sacking beggars belief, New South Wales chief executive Dave Gilbert said in a statement from the West Indies. 

With the retirements of Justin Langer and Damien Martyn, his sacking is even more bewildering and seriously questions the credibility of the selection process, Gilbert was quoted as saying in an Australian daily. 

The other to miss out was Michael Kasprowicz whose contract was not renewed. 

Leg-spinner Cullen Bailey, batsman Chris Rogers and fast bowler Ben Hilfenhaus were among Cricket Australias 25 contracted players for 2007-08 named on Tuesday. 

Allrounder James Hopes and batsman Adam Voges were added to the list missing the retired Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath, Damien Martyn and Justin Langer. 

The other newcomers in the list were batsman Adam Voges and allrounders James Hopes and Cameron White. 

Jason Gillespie, 32, was retained as one of seven pace bowlers, despite having played little international cricket since fading on the Ashes tour almost two years ago. 

With the recent retirements of great players in Warne, McGrath, Langer and Martyn, Australian cricket is presented with a great challenge over the next 24 months, chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said in a statement. 

While we are thrilled with the teams recent performances in claiming the Champions Trophy, the Ashes series and the World Cup we can now look forward to what can be seen as a new era for Australian cricket. 

This list of players still represents a very experienced group but also includes some exciting young talent that will ensure our reign as champions in both test and one-day cricket can continue. 

The retirement of Warne is a significant issue for Australian cricket. While he is obviously irreplaceable we are pleased that we have experienced spinners in Stuart MacGill, who has a great Test record, and Brad Hogg, who has just finished a highly successful World Cup. 

We will also look to Cullen Bailey and Dan Cullen to continue with their exciting development and realise their potential. 

Bailey and young off-spinner Dan Cullen, who was lucky to retain his contract after a poor season, are among four spinners in the squad. 

But the debate that has surfaced is whether Hogg should challenge Stuart MacGill for a Test place next summer after the left-arm chinaman bowler had such an impressive World Cup. 

While Hogg has an outstanding one-day record 133 wickets at 27.11 in 111 matches to be Australias most successful limited overs spinner, he has only nine wickets at 50.22 in four Tests spaced from 1996 to 2003. 

In his last Test, against Zimbabwe in Sydney, Hogg was out-bowled by Katichs occasional left-arm wrist spin. 

Katich bowled Australia to victory with a second innings six for 65, while Hogg claimed one for 70. 

Despite playing in the shadows of Warne for most of his career, MacGill has still claimed an exceptional 198 wickets in 40 Tests to have one of the best strike rates for a spinner in world cricket. (AGENCIES)

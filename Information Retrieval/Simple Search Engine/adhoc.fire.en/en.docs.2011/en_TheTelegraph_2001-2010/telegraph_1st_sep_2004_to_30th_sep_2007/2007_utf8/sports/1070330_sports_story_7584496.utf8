 Now, al Qaida whiff in murder

London: Pakistan coach Bob Woolmers mysterious death took a new twist with a report in local tabloid here linking his murder to al Qaida and Dawood Ibrahim. 

A report in a tabloid claimed a Pakistan-based bookie was thrown out of Woolmers room after an altercation with the coach. 

The tabloid quoted sources claiming that the bookie, who had vanished after Woolmers death on March 18 (Sunday), is an associate of Dawood Ibrahim, who is wanted over funding al Qaida and also for the 1993 Mumbai blasts. 

The report quoted intelligence officials, who tour with the Indian cricket team, as saying that the bookie was seen at the World Cup in Jamaica with Dawoods brother Anees. 

Jamaican officials, however, said they were not told by the Pakistan cricketers about any such row between the coach and the bookie. 

The report, however, claimed that two Pakistan players, in their statement to police, did mention about the furious bust-up. 

Bob said he had thrown a bookie out of his room. He didnt give a reason, an official said. 

Jamaicas deputy commissioner of police Mark Shields said, This issue has come up before but we have so far been unable to substantiate it. 

But we are prepared to consider it further now that we have names and more details. We will be investigating.

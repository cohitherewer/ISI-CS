 Bowden adds to Calypso colour

Bridgetown: At the 2007 World Cup, umpires boast stories as colourful as some of the players. None more so than William Billy Bowden. 

The crooked finger to indicate out, a staggered raising of the arms for a six, and a bizarre, crouched sweeping movement for a four all make the New Zealander a favourite with camera and crowd alike. 

The 44-year-old Bowden, who has arthritis in his elbow, started using the hooked finger for giving a batsman out in 1996. Bowden says its all a feature of his love of the game. 

It just came naturally... its just the way I express myself I love the game, Bowden said.

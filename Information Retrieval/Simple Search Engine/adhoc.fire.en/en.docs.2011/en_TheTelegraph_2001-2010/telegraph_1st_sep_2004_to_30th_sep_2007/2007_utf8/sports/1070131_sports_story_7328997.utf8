 The French Open will be Rogers Federer's 

 real test

 Federers celestial journey 

 continues. Jostling now with the likes of Bill Tilden at 

 the 10 Grand Slam-level, he has in his sights Laver and 

 Borg at 11 each, Emerson at 12 and Sampras at 14. Four more 

 to draw level with Sampras seems well within Federers 

 range, provided he is not injured.

 But the French Open in May-June 

 will be Federers ultimate test. Victory at Roland 

 Garros on the slow clay will, when the final total count 

 is done, put him rightfully ahead of the great Sampras, 

 who as we all know, failed to win the French crown.

 Looking down from Federers 

 silken trapeze act, one sees the emergence of a new star 

 Fernando Gonzalez. Though there are many who think that 

 things would have been different if Gonzalez had won the 

 first set he was serving for the set at 5-4, 40-15 I 

 disagree because Gonzalez had run out of steam, and the 

 errors had started to creep in. But, what Gonzalez had achieved 

 en route to the final, was by any standards exceptional.

 By thrashing Hewitt, Blake, Nadal 

 and Haas for the loss of only one set, Gonzalez took his 

 game to a higher level and one wondered if he could topple 

 Federer. He raised his game by hitting his explosive forehand 

 even harder than before and at the same time increasing 

 his level of consistency. Some of his forehand shots were 

 clocked at more than 150 kmph! A speed beyond the legs of 

 the likes of Hewitt and Nadal who grind their opponents 

 to the dust by running down every shot.

 Gonzalez has fine-tuned his game 

 to a level between the extreme spin of Nadal and a totally 

 flat shot. He has raised the bar of mens tennis. What 

 Gonzalez has achieved is fantastic, as it has come at a 

 time when mens standards are at the highest ever.

 At a lower level, Gonzalezs 

 style is similar to Sanias. Unfortunately, Sanias 

 game is not supported by a big serve, and a reliable sliced 

 backhand which keeps you in the hunt till you can unleash 

 a crushing forehand. But Gonzalezs game has its shortcomings 

 it lacks balance and variety. He tends to constantly run 

 around his backhand. This leaves a large vacant space on 

 the forehand side, which forces him to cover more court 

 space and at a higher speed. In long matches, this tells 

 on your physical condition, no matter how fit you are.

 At 26 years of age, I cannot see 

 Gonzalez emerging as a threat to Federer or, for that matter, 

 to a currently very talented group in the teens and early 

 twenties. Andy Murray, the fiery 19-year-old Scot, is the 

 one Federer has to watch out for. Coached by Brad Gilbert, 

 who has been hired by the British Lawn Tennis Association 

 reportedly at a fee of 1 million, Murray has a powerful 

 and complete all-court game.

 If Murray has the heart and stays 

 on track, he could be Britains next Wimbledon champion. 

 As compared to the other youngsters, Murray is more aggressive 

 and not afraid of going to the net. He will benefit greatly 

 from Gilberts experience.

 A transformed Andy Roddick, under 

 the guidance of blood-and-guts Jimmy Connors, 

 patiently outrallied and ground his way to the semis. His 

 6-2, 6-2, 6-2 victory over Mardy Fish made him seem like 

 a potential threat to Federer. But Federer thrived on the 

 metronomic rhythm of the restrained Roddick groundshots, 

 peaked to his very best form and annihilated the American. 

 If Roddick can develop a winning groundshot from the back 

 court, he could get to the top of the pack chasing Federer.

 Serenas victory in the womens 

 singles final against Sharapova added lustre to the Championships. 

 Comebacks of great champions strike a special note in peoples 

 hearts. They have a rare soul-lifting quality, because it 

 is in the comeback that the real champion emerges and reveals 

 his or her true self. It was more so in Serenas case 

 because it was in response to a universal condemnation of 

 the Williams sisters, not entirely untrue, of seemingly 

 losing focus and flagrantly frittering away their enormous 

 talent and potential.

 Serena emphatically redeemed herself 

 and one can understand the incongruous clockwork type bobs 

 of joy at the moment of victory. Kipling would have condemned 

 it, but there is much merit in actions which are the manifestation 

 of a free spirit.

 In more ways than one, the final 

 was a contrast in styles in physique, fashion and style. 

 Six-foot-two Sharapova, blond, slim and sleek, versus the 

 chunky power-packed glistening ebony of Serena. 

 Serena is a great champion. With 

 each round, she upped her game a notch, and miraculously 

 produced what could be her best ever match in the final. 

 Serenas victory has confirmed that the Williams sisters, 

 at their best, are a class apart. In the absence of the 

 Williams sisters no great champion has emerged in the womens 

 ranks and standards at the top levels seem to have come 

 down a rung.

 Seventeen-year-old Nicole Vaidisova 

 of Czechoslovakia is a tall, strong and fuller version of 

 Sharapova. She has the potential to move up to higher levels. 

 After defeating the No. 7-ranked Dementieva 6-3, 6-3 in 

 the pre-quarters, she gave Serena a close fight in the semis, 

 losing 6-7, 4-6.

 The Australian Open was a great 

 tournament to begin the year with. One will watch Federers 

 journey with bated breath. Will he win the next three Slams 

 and stand alongside Sampras, with victory in the French 

 tilting the greatest-ever title in his favour. 

 Will Gonzalezs style of play succeed and will the 

 players tend to flatten out the spin and hit harder or was 

 this the single swallow in Gonzalezs summer?

 Will Serena be able to sustain 

 the inspired level of play (believe me it is a very difficult 

 job) and bring back the reign of the Williams sisters with 

 Venus? We have so much to look forward to.

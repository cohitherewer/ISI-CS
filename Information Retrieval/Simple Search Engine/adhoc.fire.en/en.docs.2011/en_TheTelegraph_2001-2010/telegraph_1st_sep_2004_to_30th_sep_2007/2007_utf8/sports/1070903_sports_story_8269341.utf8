 Find it difficult to play Anna, admits Sania

New York: The Sania Mirza caravan halts abruptly at a speed breaker called Anna Chakvetadze and, after the US open third-round loss, the Indian ace is scratching her head over how to clear the obstacle off her way in future. 

Sania was tamed by Chakvetadze 2-6, 3-6 at the Flushing Meadows on Saturday and it was the fourth time in her career that the Hyderabadi fell to the world No.6 Russian meekly. 

I find it very hard to play her. She is very hard for a lot of players. I had to do something different. I didnt change it up enough, Sania said after her US Open dream came crashing down. 

In the tune-up to the majors last Grand Slam, Sania was in great form and defeated four top-20 players. But every time she met Chakvetadze, it was the same script. 

Sania lost to the 20-year-old Russian in the finals at Stanford, in the semi-finals in Cincinnati and in the last-four encounter at Hobart in January. So far, in all the four meetings, Sania has been able to win just one set. 

You have to find a way to win. There are very few Grand Slam champions and finalists. We are all trying to get there, Sania said. 

On Saturday, the 20-year-old Indians very first service game came unstuck, and then in the last game Chakvetadze, after being denied two set points, broke Sania to pocket the first set. Sania was trailing 1-5 in the second set before rallying to break Chakvetadze and ignite some hopes. But, after some nervy moments, the sixth-seeded Russian wrapped up the encounter in 53 minutes and advanced to the round of 16. 

I did not play an ugly match. I was always running. She was dictating terms. I like to dictate. She served well. I didnt expect her to serve that well. When I cant dictate I start putting pressure on myself. 

I lost to a player who is within the top-10 in the world in the third round of a slam. Its not that easy, Sania said. 

Chakvetadze will take on Austrias Tamira Paszek who ousted Swiss 11th seed Patty Schnyder. If I play like today I should win every match. My body is ready and Im mentally strong. I feel good. I feel consistent on court.

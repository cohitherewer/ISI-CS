 England look to Flintoff for fresh heroics

London: Most cricket fans, especially when they are young, dream of hitting the worlds best bowlers for huge sixes, taking wickets with searingly fast deliveries, holding sharp slip catches, captaining their country to improbable victories and still being thought of as one of the lads by teammates and opponents alike. 

Then they wake up. But Andrew Flintoff has come as close as anyone in recent times to living that dream and the Lancashire allrounders importance to Englands World Cup bid cannot be under-estimated. 

In an era where batsmen increasingly lord it over bowlers in ODIs, Flintoffs record of 122 wickets in 115 matches at an average of 26.41 is especially impressive. 

Much was made, and rightly, of Paul Collingwoods batting during Englands 2-0 tri-series final victory over world champions Australia. But in the first final, it was Flintoffs three for 41 in 9.3 overs that played a vital role in keeping Australias score in check. 

Now England supporters will hope that Flintoff, who has had his fair share of injuries, including most recently a left ankle problem, can stay fit. 

Flintoff has scored only three ODI hundreds. That can be explained in part by the fact that the 29-year-old often comes in at No. 6 in the knowledge that, if he gets out, there is not much batting to come. 

But a few quick fifties in the Caribbean could make all the difference. For example, his 72 not out off 75 balls was vital to Englands three-wicket victory in their tri-series match against New Zealand in Hobart in January. (AFP)

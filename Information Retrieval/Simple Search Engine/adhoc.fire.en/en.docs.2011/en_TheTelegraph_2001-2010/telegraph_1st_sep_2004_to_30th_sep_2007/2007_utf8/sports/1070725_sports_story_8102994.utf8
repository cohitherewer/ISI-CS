The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its a relief... but Im not worried

 - Vengsarkar satisfied with Team Indias bowling at Lords 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Dilip Vengsarkar 

Nottingham: Like the others in Team India,

 chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar is relieved that the first Test got drawn. 

Under the circumstances, its a good result Its a relief, but history shows we rarely do well in the opening Test of an overseas series Im not worried, but we do need to lift our game, Vengsarkar, wholl

 be around during the three-match series, told The Telegraph. 

He lauded Mahendra Singh Dhonis match-saving unbeaten 76, but said that the weather really proved to be the No.1 saviour at Lords. 

I dont think we couldve gone for the target (380) It was too big In any case, once Sourav (Ganguly) and (Dinesh) Karthik got out early on the last morning, there was no question of even trying There was no option but to play for a draw 

The chief selector seemed satisfied with Team Indias bowling, though. Zaheer Khan didnt get a five-wicket haul, but deserved it R.P. Singh bowled very well for his five in the second innings, but Sreesanth needs to get disciplined He has to be careful with line and length 

The second Test gets underway here on Friday. After days of rain, the sun took centrestage on Tuesday.

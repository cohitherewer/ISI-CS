 Raina among 10 to watch out for

 Suresh Raina 

London: Suresh Raina may have lost his place in the Indian team due to indifferent form but he figures among the 10 players who will define cricket in the next decade. 

The latest issue of the Wisden Cricketer clubs Raina with Australians Michael Clarke, Shaun Tait, Shane Watson; Englands Kevin Pietersen; Pakistans Mohammed Asif; Sri Lankas Lasith Malinga; West Indian Dwayne Bravo, New Zealands Ross Taylor and Bangladeshs Mohammed Ashraful as the players who will define crickets next decade. 

The writer says that Raina has the talent to be a left-handed Sachin Tendulkar with even more intuitive flair. But he needs to be sensitively handled by India. The way he dismantled England during an ODI in Faridabad in March 2006 hinted at a rare genius, and Greg Chappell never stopped singing his praises. Aged 20, he has plenty of time on his side. 

Paying glowing tributes to the hard-hitting Pietersen, the article said he finished the World Cup at the top of the one-day ratings and he has the ability to stay there. 

Only if he grows fed up with his teammates failings, will his potential be threatened but Pietersen flamingo shot, left-handed sweep, bottom-handed cover drive and all is well on course to fulfil Pontings prediction that he is world crickets next great phenomenon, it said. 

On Pakistan paceman Asif, the writer said if he could put the drug scandal behind him and rise above Pakistans intriguing politics, anything was possible. 

There are few more apparently effortless fast bowlers in the world; willowy, snaking, subtle and accurate, he already has figures to die for (49 Test wickets at 20 with a strike rate of 39). Expect them to get better. 

The writer was full of praise for Clarke. Australia will relax in the knowledge that once Ricky Ponting and Mike Hussey have packed it in, they will be able to base their batting around a man with a strong enough sense of his own destiny to tattoo carpe diem on his fore-arm. (PTI)

 Dibyendu in sole lead 

New Delhi: Grandmaster Dibyendu Barua emerged sole leader after defeating Arghyadip Das in the fifth round of the Parsvnath International Open on Wednesday. 

He is followed by a bunch of 13 players, including top seed GM Alexey Dreev of Russia. 

Reigning national champion GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly (3.5) was upset by G Rohit, who played a finely-crafted endgame to come out on top and take his tally to 4.5 points. 

On the top board, GM Abhijit Kunte and GM-norm holder Abhijeet Gupta shared the point. 

Earlier in the fourth round, Kunte continued his good form and defeated talented youngster S.P. Sethuraman. 

However, the major upset of the day was V. Haribalu getting the better of GM Neelotpal Das. Playing black, Neelotpal was shocked by the 19-year-old, who has a reputation of being a giant-killer, in quick time. 

Surya, with white, played Ruy Lopez against N. Sudhakar Babu, who had held Dreev to a draw on Tuesday. 

Among younger players, former world U-10 champion Sahaj Grover lost his first game of the meet against Swapnil Dhopade in 21 moves. Deepan beat P.D.S. Girinath in 39 moves. (PTI)

 Gambhir sees series win

 Gautam Gambhir 

Leicester: Their superb on-field performances and an upbeat dressing room atmosphere following the Trent Bridge Test win have Indians in high spirits ahead of the third and final Test against England at The Oval, says left-handed batsman Gautam Gambhir. 

To be honest, winning a Test overseas is always a great feeling. And to be a part of the dressing room in such an atmosphere gives you more happiness, Gambhir said. 

With the kind of cricket we are playing, weve got a fantastic chance of winning the series. The batsmen and the bowlers are doing a great job, he said. 

Gambhir, who scored an impressive 67 in the first innings against Sri Lanka A in the three-day warm-up match, stressed the importance of getting runs in tour games after a long break. 

They (the Lankans) were bowling well in the morning. I was playing after 25 days and there was a bit of rust in my game. So my game plan was to spend a long time at the wicket and play a big innings. 

You may bat as long as you want in the nets but its a different ball game in a match. Theres no practice like match practice, he said. 

Whatever opportunities you get on tour, if you put runs on the board, it gives you a lot of confidence. My aim is to cash in on every opportunity. 

Asked what he did to keep himself motivated during such long breaks, the Delhi batsman said: Playing for India is in itself a great source of motivation. (PTI)

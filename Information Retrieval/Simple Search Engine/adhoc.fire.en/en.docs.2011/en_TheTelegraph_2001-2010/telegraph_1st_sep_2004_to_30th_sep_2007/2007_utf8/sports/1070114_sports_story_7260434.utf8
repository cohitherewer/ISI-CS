 Its important for me to play a few games before the World Cup

Mumbai: Stylish left-hander Yuvraj Singh is targeting the last two one-dayers against the West Indies to stage his international comeback, three months after tearing his knee ligament in Mohali. 

Yuvraj said it was important that he played some matches before the World Cup in March-April and if he could not make it to the series against the West Indies, he would definitely like to compete against the Sri Lankans whom India play next. 

I would like to play the last two ODIs against the West Indies (January 27 in Chennai and January 31 in Vadodara) or the matches against Sri Lanka, its important for me to play a few games before the World Cup, Yuvraj said. 

But I cant give a time-frame, the Punjab batsman, who has been named in the provisional 30-member World Cup squad, told reporters here on Saturday. 

Yuvraj said he would be training with the Indian team in Nagpur on January 17 and 18 before proceeding to Calcutta to play three Twenty20 games for his employers Indian Airlines. 

I played a game (50-over match with Mumbai under-19 probables) yesterday after two and a half months. I wanted to field first for 50 overs and then bat, and did so for 25 to 30 overs. I felt really good, he said. 

Yuvraj also underwent a test by the Primus RS (Rehabilitation System) machine at the Saifee Hospital here on Saturday in the presence of BCCI physician Dr Anant Joshi, former Indian teams physio Andrew Leipus and Joshis physiotherapist son Dr Mithun, who has been treating the player of late. 

Dr Joshi described the outcome of the machine test as very satisfactory. It gave us an objective report of the rehab process while the physical test done at the CCI (two days ago) was a subjective analysis, he said. 

Joshi said it was important that Yuvrajs return began at the lower level and not a first class game straightaway. 

Thats the way to go during a rehab process. Hes to play some lower level games and not be subjected straightaway to first-class level games, he said. 

Joshi also said it was now left to Indian team physio John Gloster to monitor the players progress, but the final call, whether he was ready to play at the top level, would be entirely Yuvrajs. 

John Gloster will monitor his progress now. But finally its up to the player to decide when hes mentally and physically fit to play (top level cricket), Joshi said. 

The Boards physican also said Yuvraj was lucky that he did not have to undergo surgery for the injury which would have put him out of the game for upto nine months. 

When we examined the injury after ten days we felt it could be set right without surgery. Hes lucky as otherwise it would have taken between six to nine months for him to make a comeback, Joshi said. 

The player was also very determined and showed a lot of grit, and the rehab staff also did phenomenal work, he said.

 NZ-Bangla highlights

 For

 Javed Omar, who has appeared in 53 ODIs, it was his first World Cup match.

 He made his ODI debut on April 5, 1995 

 The 55-run stand between Omar and Tamim Iqbal was Bangladeshs only second 50-plus partnership for the opening wicket in World Cups. The first came in 1999, when Mehrab Hossain and Shahriar Hossain put on 69 against Pakistan at Northampton. Bangladesh won the encounter by 62 runs. 

 The last wicket stand of 34 runs between Mohammed Rafique and Syed Rasel was Bangladeshs best in a World Cup match. The previous best was of 26 runs between Manjural Islam and Mashrafe Mortaza against Sri Lanka at Pietermaritzburg in 2003. 

 The last wicket stand was also the best by any team against New Zealand in the World Cup. Previous best was by Pakistans Abdul Qadir and Rashid Khan who had put on 28 at Birmingham in the 1983 edition. 

 Scott Styris (4/43) became the first New Zealand bowler to claim a four-plus wicket haul in an ODI match at the bowling position No. 7! Former teammate Nathan Astle had the previous best figures of three for 34 against Sri Lanka at Bloemfontein in the last World Cup. 

 Stephen Fleming became the first New Zealander and the ninth overall to aggregate 1,000 World Cup runs. He now has 1,002 runs after 28 matches. 

 Fleming, meanwhile, extended his tally of runs as captain to 809 runs in 22 matches the most by any captain in the World Cup. 

 Flemings second century as captain in the World Cup also equalled that of former New Zealand captain and opener Glenn Turner. Fleming is still one behind Indian Sourav Ganguly and Ricky Ponting who have made three World Cup centuries as captain.

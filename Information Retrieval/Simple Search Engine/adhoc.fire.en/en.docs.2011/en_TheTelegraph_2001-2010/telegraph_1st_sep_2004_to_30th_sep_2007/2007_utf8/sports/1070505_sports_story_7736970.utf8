London: Sevilla will defend their Uefa Cup crown in an all-Spanish final against Espanyol later this month after their irresistible blend of Brazilian magic knocked out Osasuna on Thursday. 

Trailing 0-1 from the first leg in Pamplona, goals from Brazilians Luis Fabiano and Renato secured a 2-0 win for the holders in the second leg at the Sanchez Pizjuan. 

Sevilla meet Espanyol, the 1988 runners-up, at Hampden Park in Glasgow on May 16 after the Catalans added to their 3-0 first-leg victory with a 2-1 triumph over Werder Bremen in Germany. 

Werders task, despite an early goal from Hugo Almeida, was made all the harder by Germany striker Miroslav Kloses red card after 19 minutes at the Weserstadion. 

Espanyol took full advantage, replying with second-half goals from Ferran Corominas and Mari Lacruz. 

Getting to the final is a great achievement especially for a team like this, Espanyol coach Ernesto Valverde said. 

Sevilla are having a great season. They are still in with a chance of winning the league and the (Kings) Cup as well as the Uefa Cup but I dont expect theyll be giving anything away to us. 

Sevilla could become the first side since Real Madrid in 1986 to make a successful Uefa Cup defence. 

Getting to two consecutive finals is an achievement which is within reach of very few teams and weve done it, Sevilla coach Juande Ramos said. 

Sevillas pressure eventually worked when Fabiano, who scored the first goal in the 4-0 demolition of Middlesbrough in last years final, levelled eight minutes before halftime. 

The decisive second goal arrived eight minutes after the break, Renato meeting a cross from fellow Brazilian Daniel Alves with a clinical volley. 

Lacruz outjumped Daniel Jensen at the far post to head in the second on the hour. (Reuters)

 Powell surges to victory 

Stuttgart: Jamaicas Asafa Powell closed out his season with a sizzling run of 9.83 seconds to win the 100 metres at the World Athletics Final on Saturday. 

Powell, who lowered the world record to 9.74 earlier this month in Italy, clocked the third fastest time of the season to finish well clear of Jaysuma Saidy Ndure and take the $30,000 first prize on day one of the two-day competition. 

Croatian world champion Blanka Vlasic easily won the high jump, clearing 2.0 metres at the first attempt, but Russian world and Olympic champion Yelena Isinbayeva was in much less commanding form in a pole vault thriller. 

Isinbayeva needed a jump-off with Polands Monika Pyrek to clinch victory and extend an unbeaten run that goes back to August, 2006.

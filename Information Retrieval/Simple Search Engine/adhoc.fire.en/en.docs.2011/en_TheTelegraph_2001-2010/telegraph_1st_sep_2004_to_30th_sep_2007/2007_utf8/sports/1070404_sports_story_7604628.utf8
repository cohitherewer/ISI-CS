The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 League idea dates back to 90s

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Will any of these players join the Indian Cricket League? 

Calcutta: Its somewhat ironical that

 Lalit Modi is one of those to decide on whether Subhas Chandra should be allowed

 to launch the Indian Cricket League (ICL). 

Ironical because back in the late 1990s, when he wasnt a Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) vice-president, Modi himself sought to be part of a private inter-city league! 

Mr Modis company was to run the show, while the late Madhav Rao Scindia got his association (Madhya Pradesh) to place the proposal before the BCCI However, things didnt work out, former

 India opener Arun Lal told The Telegraph. 

Lal was one of those closely involved with the planning. 

Fingers are still pointed at one-time supremo Jagmohan Dalmiya for scuttling that proposal, but a confidant clarified he wasnt an office-bearer in 1998/1999. 

 Arun Lal 

Dalmiya was then the International Cricket Council president, though. 

Nobody may go on record, but key Indian players had even been paid a signing amount and negotiations were on with the Arjuna Ranatungas and Inzamam-ul Haqs. 

Initially, the plan was to involve six cities The telecast rights for the limited overs matches were being finalised and industrial houses had been sounded out for sponsorship But then Lal added. 

Commenting on the Chandra development, he said: Its exciting The way forward for Indian cricket is to lift the domestic action If the ICL is to be run like a tournament, then I dont see why theres going to be a confrontation with the BCCI. 

Lal, incidentally, revealed even the inter-city league was to be called Indian Cricket League!

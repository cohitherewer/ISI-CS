 Vaughan: We put undue pressure on ourselves

Gros Islet: England captain Michael Vaughan said Sundays World Cup win over Canada had been made much harder by some of the players going on a late night drinking session two days earlier. 

Allrounder Andrew Flintoff was sacked as World Cup vice-captain and dropped for the group C game after he and five other players were fined for breaching team discipline following the six-wicket defeat by New Zealand on Friday. 

With the incidents on Friday night, we put a lot of undue pressure on ourselves, Vaughan told a news conference following the 51-run win (as reported in Mondays CM edition) which put their campaign back on track ahead of the final group game with Kenya on Saturday. 

England made 279 for six after being sent in but, despite reducing Canada to 65 for four, were unable to bowl out the minnows without their pace-bowling allrounder. They were held up first by a fifth-wicket stand of 96 between Abdool Samad (36) and Ashif Mulla (60). 

Although both batsmen fell within the space of four balls, with the score of 161 Canada finished with 228 for seven their best total at the World Cup in 11 matches after they had made 202 against the West Indies at Centurion in 2003. It was also 29 more than the 199 they managed four days ago in their seven-wicket opening group C match thrashing by Kenya. 

On Saturday all the players realised what they had done and they were all angry with themselves. Hopefully the victory today and us having a decent run in the World Cup is the only answer, the skipper said. 

Vaughan said there had been no thought about sending Flintoff home. 

Freddie, I would have guessed, could have played today and done very well. That is Andrew Flintoff, he is an immense talent, Vaughan said. 

But drinking two nights before any game, you are certainly going to have some sort of actions on your body or your mind because it is still in there sometimes. 

Unfortunately, incidents like this have taken one of the greats of the game out of todays game. 

Vaughan said the episode might bind the team together. It could do. Only time will tell, he said. 

Vaughan fell five runs short of a half-century 45 after his slashed square-cut from spinner Samad was caught by Canada captain John Davison at backward point. Vaughan faced 64 balls with seven fours. 

Davison said England definitely missed Flintoffs presence and was pleased with how his side, with only one full-time professional, competed. 

We put them under a bit of pressure. The England attack missed him (Flintoff) in the middle stages, he said.

The HIGHLIGHTS

 The first wicket stand of 101 between England rsquo;s Ed Joyce and Michael Vaughan was the first 100-plus partnership against Canada in ODIs. The previous best was the 67 between Bas Zuiderent and Eric Szwarczynski for The Netherlands at Potchefstroom on November 26, 2006.

 The above 100-plus stand was England rsquo;s first in 27 games. The last occasion being when Andrew Strauss and Ian Bell put on 107 against India in Jamshedpur on April 12, 2006.

 The 96-run partnership between Abdool Samad and Ashif Mulla was Canada rsquo;s best for the fifth wicket in ODIs. The pair just sneaked past the previous best of 95 between Desmond Chumney and Don Maxwell against The Netherlands at Potchefstoom on November 26, 2006.

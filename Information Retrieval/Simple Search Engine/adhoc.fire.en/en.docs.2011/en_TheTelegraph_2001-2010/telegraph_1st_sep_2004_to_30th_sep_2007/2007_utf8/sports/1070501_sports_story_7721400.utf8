 Eesha closer to final IM norm

Dubai: WGM Eesha Karavade inched closer to her third and final IM norm defeating Mehdi Mahdavirad of Iran in the eighth and penultimate round of Dubai International Championship. 

Eesha took her tally to five points out of a possible eight. A draw in the final round against Qatar IM Al Sated Mohamad should be enough to give the Pune girl the norm. 

Eesha is set to meet international master al sated mohamad of qatar in the last round. 

It wasnt smooth going for most of the other Indian norm hopefuls. P. Girinath and D Harika suffered defeats at the hands of Gadir Guseinov of Azerbaijan and Ashot Anastasian of Armenia, respectively. 

The win against Girinath enabled Guseinov remain in joint lead with Levan Pantsulaia of Georgia (6.5 points each), who had it easy against Tigran Kotanjian. 

GM Koneru Humpy bowed out of contention for top spot after drawing with Georgian GM Zurab Sturua. Humpy inched to 5.5 points and will meet Girinath to determine the best Indian in the championship. (PTI)

 Ecclestone shows interest in Arsenal 

JAMES MOSSOP

Formula One billionaire Bernie Ecclestone insists he has not spoken to Arsenal but on Saturday said that he has not ruled out the possibility of challenging Stan Kroenke, who recently paid 75m to own 12.2 per cent of the club, to take over at the Emirates Stadium. 

[Arsenal are not about to be sold despite persistent rumours, managing director Keith Edelman said on Sunday, adds a report from Reuters.] 

Should Ecclestone take over at Arsenal one of his first moves would be to restore former director David Dein to the boardroom and launch a concerted bid to keep Arsene Wenger as manager by offering him a new four-year contract. 

Ecclestone, who is thought to have aligned himself to director Danny Fiszman at the club, said: I dont know too much about it actually. Its good if somebody is saying that because maybe I will get approached and maybe it will be cheap enough. 

Ive not spoken to anybody at Arsenal. I obviously talked to David [Dein] when they chucked him out. But if somebody offers me something that I think has got good value, I will have a go. 

Ecclestone has a connection with Dein in that his daughter, Tamara, is romantically involved with Deins son, Gavin. Dein left Arsenal after a row with chairman Peter Hill-Wood when, ironically, he argued that Kroenkes affluence would be good for the club. 

 Kroenke has launched his own 650m 

 bid for the club and any offer from Ecclestone might force 

 him to up his price. Hill-Wood, however, may support an 

 Ecclestone bid since he said when Kroenke first came on 

 the scene: We do not need his money and we do not 

 want his sort at the club.

 Yuvraj may be back vs WI, says physio

New Delhi: Yuvraj Singh could be available for the latter part of the one-day series against the West Indies, the sports physiotherapist treating the Punjab cricketer said Tuesday. 

Mithun Joshi said the batsman was in the final phase of recovery and could be fit to play in the second half of this month. 

He (Yuvraj) is in the final phase of rehabilitation. He is doing light fielding, functional agility, netting, Mithun, son of Dr Anant Joshi, wrote in a report to the BCCI. 

It is likely he will be able to return to a Twenty20 match by the 19th of this month. He could be with the team for the preparation for the West Indies series and be available to play in the latter part of the series against the West Indies, or for the series against Sri Lanka, Joshi was quoted by a website. 

The left-hander said he had worked hard to get fit. 

Its hard to come back so quickly without surgery. I have really worked very hard over the last 40 days. The problem is that it plays on you mentally, especially when fielding. Youre wondering whether you might get a recurrence of the injury and that could put you out for a long time. 

Im about 90-95 per cent fit at the moment. But its always different being in a match situation. Its just about getting some match practice under the belt. Hopefully I can play three or four practice matches, and then declare myself fit and eligible for national selection, he said.

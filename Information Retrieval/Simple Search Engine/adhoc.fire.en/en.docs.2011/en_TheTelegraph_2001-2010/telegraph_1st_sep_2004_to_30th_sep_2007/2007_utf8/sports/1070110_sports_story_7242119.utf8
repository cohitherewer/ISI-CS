 Sehwag faces a dual challenge

 Sehwag 

Rohtak: Virender Sehwag will look to come out of a prolonged form slump as well as keep Delhi in the Elite Division when he leads the side in their Ranji Trophy Super League match against Haryana starting here on Tuesday. 

The beleaguered batsmans place as Team India opener has come under pressure following a prolonged form slump and the tie might be his last chance to prove his credentials. 

The swashbuckling right-hander will also need to carry the teams hopes of preserving its place in the Elite Division, for which at least the first-innings lead has to be ensured. 

Delhi have eight points while Haryana have seven in Group A, which is topped by Baroda (17) and followed by Karnataka (15). 

Tamil Nadu and defending champions Uttar Pradesh, with four points each, are staring at the relegation zone but an outright win with a bonus point, against Baroda and Andhra (12), respectively, could see them make the great escape. 

Uttar Pradesh, however, have suffered a setback before the match as two of their in-form players Piyush Chawla and Tanmay Srivastava have been chosen for national under-19 squad, which would play a series against New Zealand. Tahir Abbas and Anshul Kapoor have replaced them. 

Delhi will also see the return of Gautam Gambhir, who was in the Test squad for the tour of South Africa. 

There are nerves. But we are not looking for just the first innings lead. We have not won a match this season although we have done well. We want to win this one, Gambhir said. 

In Hyderabad, while the hosts will feel rejuvenated with the return of V.V.S. Laxman as captain, Punjab will also be in their full strength. 

Led by veteran wicketkeeper-batsman Pankaj Dharmani, Punjab will throw up challenge Hyderabad with the likes of Dinesh Mongia, Vikram Rajvir Singh, Harbhajan Singh, Reetinder Singh Sodhi and Gagandeep Singh. 

Elsewhere, Rahul Dravid didnt join the practice session, but he is expected to lead Karnataka against Saurashtra in Rajkot. (Agencies)

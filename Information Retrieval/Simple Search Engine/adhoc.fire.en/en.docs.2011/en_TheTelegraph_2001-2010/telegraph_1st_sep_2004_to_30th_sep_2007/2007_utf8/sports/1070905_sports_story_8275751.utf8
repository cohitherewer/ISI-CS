 Sarwan not to take ICL plunge 

Bridgetown: West Indies captain Ramnaresh Sarwan has scotched rumours that he is set to join the Indian Cricket League (ICL), saying he does not have any idea about the event and the people backing it. 

Sarwan said neither anyone contacted him to be part of the rebel league nor was he aware of any such offer being made to his West Indies teammates. 

Media reports earlier claimed that a number of West Indian players had been approached with offers ranging from $350,000 to 500,000 to join the league, which has already roped in former West Indies captain Brian Lara. 

Im not one of them. I dont know who they are and I dont know if they are any players at all, but Im definitely not one of them. 

I have not been contacted by the ICL, Sarwan was quoted as saying by a newspaper. 

Sarwan, who flew to South Africa where he would lead the West Indies side in the ICC World Twenty20, said he was too pre-occupied with the West Indies cricket to think about the ICL. 

I have not thought about it at all. I have been concentrating on West Indies cricket and trying to get back on course. I have not put any thought into anything else, he said. 

Before the teams departure, Sarwan had said he had no problem with them being considered underdogs in the inaugural meet.

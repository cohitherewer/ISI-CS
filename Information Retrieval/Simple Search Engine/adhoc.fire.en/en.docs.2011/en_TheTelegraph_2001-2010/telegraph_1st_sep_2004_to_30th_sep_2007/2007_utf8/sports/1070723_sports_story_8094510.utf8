 Prasun says he will be neutral

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: CAB president Prasun Mukherjee assured members on Sunday that he would be neutral when conducting elections during the AGM on Saturday. Many are saying that there would be discrimination, but I can assure you that I will be neutral, Mukherjee said. 

Mukherjee had suggested having an observer for the elections but the working committee decided against it and put faith on the city police chief. I personally wanted an observer as I felt that it was illogical for me to conduct the elections while representing a panel at the same time, but the working committee decided against it, he said. 

Jagmohan Dalmiya loyalist and joint secretary candidate Biswarup Dey cleared the air further by announcing an observer was not needed. We have faith in Mukherjee and so didnt ask for an observer Also as an office-bearer we dont want to spend around Rs 10 lakh for appointing an observer, Dey said. 

Dalmiya, who was invited to the CAB awards function on Sunday, didnt turn up for personal reasons.

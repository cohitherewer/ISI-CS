 - RANJI TROPHY - Rajasthan suffer innings defeat; Hosts top group

 Nikhil Doru at the Eden on Saturday 

Calcutta: Bengal needed just 47.3 overs on the final day to inflict an innings defeat on Rajasthan and set up a semi-final clash at home against Karnataka. 

The celebrations didnt last long as it was back to business for Paras Mhambrey and his players. Not wanting to waste an opportunity, the team got together for some fitness drills late in the afternoon on Saturday. 

With the team management deciding not to risk Ranadeb Boses side strain further, Bengal were a bowler short. But the rest ensured his absence was not felt as the innings and 62-run victory was achieved with consummate ease. 

Sourashish Lahiri and Laxmi Ratan Shukla bagged two each while Sourav Sarkar added one more to his kitty. The other one was a run out. Bengal thus topped their group with 17 points. 

Shukla, who bowled for the first time after the Gujarat match, completed 100 first-class wickets when he scalped Pankaj Singh. He was on target and concentrated on the basics. 

The ability of the youngsters to shoulder responsibility in times of crisis has been the hosts strongest point this season. Be it Ashok Dinda, Bose, or Sarkar, the mediumpacers have made their presence felt whenever the situation demanded. Deep Dasgupta acknowledged as much. 

Its good to win 50-50 matches. The biggest plus for us this season has been the way we have won every close game, the captain said. 

Mhambrey was also looking ahead with optimism. 

There was never any doubt about this sides potential. I knew if we could plan properly, the results will show. Last season we made the final. To follow it up was more important. 

That way this was the most important season It will be important to win the trophy and try and channelise our energy in that direction, he explained. 

Nikhil Doru was the most successful batsman for the visitors, though his first century of the season failed to save his side from the ignominy of an innings defeat. 

He showed application and discipline during his 401-minute knock, which included nine boundaries. If the others succeeded in showing some of his qualities in both the innings, they may have put up a better show. 

Jadeja, who batted at No.9 having known in advance that there was nothing at stake from this match, remained unbeaten on 25.

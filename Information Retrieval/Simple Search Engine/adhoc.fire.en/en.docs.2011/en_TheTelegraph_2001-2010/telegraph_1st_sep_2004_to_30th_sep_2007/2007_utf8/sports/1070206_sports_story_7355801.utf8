 Vaughan: Im fit and ready

Sydney: A knee injury is threatening to force New Zealand paceman Kyle Mills out of the World Cup. 

At the other end of the spectrum, England captain Michael Vaughan has declared himself available for Tuesdays crucial tri-series one-day International against New Zealand in Brisbane. 

The winner would face the Australia in the best-of-three finals and Vaughans availability is another boost to an England. 

I got through everything, batting in the nets and fielding okay, so I will be available, Vaughan said here on Monday. 

Meanwhile, Mills, who has been troubled by knee problems for the past year, aggravated the injury playing against Australia in Perth on January 28 and has been in pain ever since.

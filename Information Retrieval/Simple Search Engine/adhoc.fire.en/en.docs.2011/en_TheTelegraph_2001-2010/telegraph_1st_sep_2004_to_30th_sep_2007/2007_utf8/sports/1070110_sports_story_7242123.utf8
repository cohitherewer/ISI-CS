 No respite for England

 - Twenty20 international 

 Adam Gilchrist on the rampage on Tuesday 

Sydney: Australia continued their dominance over England with a record-breaking 77-run victory in their one-off Twenty20 match on Tuesday. 

Despite missing almost half the team that humiliated the visitors 5-0 in the Ashes Test series, Australia racked up a world-record total to leave the tourists winless in all forms of the game since arriving Down Under more than two months ago. 

Australias batsmen went on the rampage, piling up 221 for five to eclipse the previous international record of 214 for five they set against New Zealand in Auckland in 2005. 

England replied with 144 for nine, narrowly avoiding the heaviest defeat in the short history of Twenty20 Internationals. 

The home team belted 15 fours and 14 sixes, Adam Gilchrist (48) and Ricky Ponting (47) sharing a 69-run partnership for the second wicket off 29 balls while Cameron White (40 not out) and Andrew Symonds (39 not out) added an unbroken 66 in less than six overs. 

Gilchrist, who scored a hundred off 57 balls in the Test series, bludgeoned two fours and five sixes including three maximums in a row off James Anderson.

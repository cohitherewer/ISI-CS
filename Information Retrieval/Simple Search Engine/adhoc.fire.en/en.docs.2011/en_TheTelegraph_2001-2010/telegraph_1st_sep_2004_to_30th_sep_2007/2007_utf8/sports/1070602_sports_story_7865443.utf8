 CA recce team to visit Pak

Karachi: The PCB will have to wait for a final word from a high level security delegation of Cricket Australia before they can start planning for tours by the Australian junior and senior teams this season. 

While the Australian U-19 and A teams are due to tour Pakistan from late August to October onwards, the senior team would be coming in February-March next year to play three Tests and five ODIs. 

A senior official of the board on Friday said the Australian board had confirmed that it was sending its inspection team on a reconnaissance visit sometime in July.

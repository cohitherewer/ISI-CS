The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 CSA quite happy with coach

 - Mickey Arthurs contract up for review 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mickey Arthur 

Cape Town:Mickey Arthurs performance as South Africas coach from the start of the 2005-06 season will be reviewed by the committee which appointed him, in Johannesburg, on Tuesday. 

The three-Test series against Pakistan begins two days after that. 

Mickeys appointment is till the end of the forthcoming World Cup, but theres a clause in his contract which says a review has to be done three months before it ends... Thats why Tuesdays meeting a top Cricket South Africa (CSA) source told The Telegraph. 

Speaking on Saturday, the gentleman added: Where were concerned, were quite happy with Mickey... However, lets see how his meeting with the full committee goes... Also, right now, we dont know what Mickey has in mind... 

The committee, by the way, has five members: CSA chief executive Gerald Majola, Mike Procter, Andrew Hudson, Errol Stewart and advocate Norman Arendse. 

Its significant that Mickey and captain Graeme Smith have forged an excellent partnership. Smiths own appointment is till the end of the World Cup, but he wont be subjected to a review before that. 

Meanwhile, South Africa may travel to Sri Lanka for a tri-series later in the year. If the visit does take place, then its going to be a goodwill gesture after what happened last August. 

Back then, the South Africans abandoned the tour (on grounds of security), leading to the cancellation of a tri-series. The third team had been India.

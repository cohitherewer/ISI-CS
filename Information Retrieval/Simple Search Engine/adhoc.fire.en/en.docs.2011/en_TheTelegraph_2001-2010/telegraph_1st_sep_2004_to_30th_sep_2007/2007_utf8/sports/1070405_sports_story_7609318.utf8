Cape Town: Bob Woolmers family and friends attended a memorial service on Wednesday near the slain coachs home. 

The service in the Cape Town suburb of Pinelands was led by Anglican priest Jerome Francis, who was one of hundreds of poor black and mixed-race boys coached by Woolmer in the 1980s. 

Tears and tributes flowed as Woolmers widow Gill and sons Dale and Russell heard how he defied apartheid to create one of South Africas first mixed-race teams. 

Here was a man with so much worth to humanity, Francis told 300 mourners at the Wynberg Boys High School where Woolmer spotted a young Jacques Kallis. 

Woolmer coached South Africa before his Pakistan assignment and guided the Proteas to the 1999 World Cup semis. 

He was a players coach. He was my mentor, former fast bowler Allan Donald said. He put South Africa on the map and well remember him for that. 

At the height of Woolmers success, the former England Test batsman trained deprived kids and became a father to a generation of cricketers. 

He encouraged the boys to ignore the bullets and tear gas fired by police in Cape Towns restive townships. 

Hes still the most successful coach South Africa has ever had, spin bowler Paul Adams said. We have lost a great soldier of the game. 

During the service, longtime friend Tim Noakes denied rumours that Woolmer was about to blow the whistle on match-fixing in a coaching manual they were writing. 

Not once in the past five years did he mention match-fixing to me. The theory is completely without substance, sad Noakes, whose book with Woolmer was in its final stages before the murder. 

Woolmer was South Africas coach at the height of the match-fixing scandal involvig Hansie Cronje, but was never implicated. 

He was found unconscious in his hotel room in Kingston on March 18, the day after Pakistan were shocked by Ireland. He was taken to the hospital and declared dead. 

We fear for what may yet emerge and pray that our fears are groundless and there may be a simple explanation, Noakes said. 

After a stint as the high-performance manager for the ICC, Woolmer took charge of the Pakistan team in 2004. 

He truly loved the game, PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf said. He lived cricket, he loved cricket and, unfortunately, he died for cricket.

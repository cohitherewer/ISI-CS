 Sania makes quarters 

 WTA PATTAYA MEET

 Sania Mirza in Pattaya on Wednesday 

New Delhi: Sania Mirza survived a scare before overcoming home favourite Tamarine Tanasugarn with a hard-fought three-set win at the $170,000 WTA Tour event in Pattaya, Thailand, on Thursday. 

The fifth-seeded Indian was tested to the full by the blustery conditions and a spirited opponent before coming through a 6-4, 2-6, 6-1 win and advance to the quarter finals. 

Serving for the first set at 5-3, Sania committed two double faults to hand back the advantage to Tamarine. 

But the 20-year old Hyderabadi lass immediately broke back, sealing the set with a return winner on the local girls second serve. 

In the second set, Tamarine was the dominant player as she moved Sania like puppet on strings. (PTI)

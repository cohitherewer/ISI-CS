 Demand for a memorial

London: Former Warwickshire Cricket Club chief executive Dennis Amiss has said a permanent memorial to Bob Woolmer at Edgbaston would be a fitting tribute for his services to the County team. 

Amiss, the former colleague of Woolmer who coached Warwickshire team to several titles, said the club was proud of the South African. 

He brought great honour to the club. I know the club was thinking of doing something to honour Bob and everyone at the club is very proud of what he achieved for Warwickshire, Amiss was quoted as saying by a news channel. (PTI)

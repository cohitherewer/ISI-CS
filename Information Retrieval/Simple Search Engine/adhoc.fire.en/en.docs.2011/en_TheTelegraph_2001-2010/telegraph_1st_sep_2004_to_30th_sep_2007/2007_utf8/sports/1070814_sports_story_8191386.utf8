 Ex-players pin hopes on movie

New Delhi: At a time when hockey has been hitting the headlines for all the wrong reasons and its popularity has been slipping into a comatose state, the film Chak De India seems to have given a fresh lease of life to the game. 

Former players to octogenarian fans, who used to relish Indias dominance in the game decades ago, are now thronging the theatres with great enthusiasm and hoping that the Shah Rukh Khan-starrer will mark the revival of hockeys fortunes. 

Its a fantastic film. I think for the first time, a film on hockey has been made and it is an amazing piece of work, said Zafar Iqbal, who was the captain of the 1982 Asian Games silver-winning Indian team. 

I hope it has some positive effect on the game and the administrators alike, especially the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) president K.P.S. Gill, he quipped. 

Harbinder Singh, who was a gold medallist in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and played alongside the great Dhyan Chand, felt the filmmakers have made a brave attempt by choosing such an unconventional theme.

 Rio De Janeiro: AC Milan striker Ronaldo should be fit to return from his thigh injury in three weeks, the Brazil national team doctor said on Wednesday.

 I believe in three weeks Ronaldo will be ready to resume his activities as the injury has healed, Jose Luis Runco told a television channell. He denied Italian media speculation the player had used growth factor therapy.

 There has been some confusion because the day Ronaldo was here, another player, Maxi from Flamengo, was here and he had some growth therapy treatment, said Runco.

 It seems the information was confused when it got to Italy, thats all.

 Runco said growth factor therapy was not banned in any case. Growth factor is a worldwide technique which has been in use for more than seven or eight years and at no time has it been questioned as possible doping, he said. 

 The Brazil striker sustained the injury at the end of July and Milan initially said he would be fit for the start of the season.

 Ronaldo travelled to Antwerp last week for a second opinion before seeing Runco in Rio on Friday. 

 London: Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich has denied media reports he offered bonuses to Russias players to defeat England in their Euro 2008 qualifier at Wembley.

 In a statement issued on the clubs official website (www.chelseafc.com), the Londoners said Abramovich has never offered, proposed or promised any bonuses to the Russian team to beat England.

 Miami: The United States are waiting to hear if Spanish soccer authorities will change their mind and allow a friendly against Catalonia to go ahead next month.

 The US had agreed to play the Catalan regional side in a friendly at Barcelonas Nou Camp on October 14 but as the Catalans are not members of Fifa, the match must be endorsed by the Spanish Football Federation.

 To date, the Spanish Federation hasnt approved it. We are waiting to see if they will approve it, said US Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati in a statement.

 Phoenix: Former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson is scheduled for a hearing this month in which he could change his plea in a narcotics case.

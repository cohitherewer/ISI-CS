The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 All credit to India, says Gilchrist

Australia needed 22 in the last over from Joginder Sharma. The world champions managed only seven. As the final clash with Pakistan in the ICC World Twenty20 was confirmed, the Indians went wild.If Yuvraj Singh set the tone for the victory with a scintillating 70, Sreesanth and Harbhajan Singh were excellent with the ball. 

The following is what the players had to say: 

MAHENDRA SINGH DHONI: I and my boys are very happy that we have proved a lot of guys wrong Yuvraj was outstanding He was our trumpcard. Im glad he responded to the challenge. We expected him to come out and score and he did. The bowlers just bowled in the right areas I had banked on Joginder and knew it would be hard to score off him Ive never wanted my team to be under pressure My message to them at every team meeting has been to go out and perform. The pacers bowled really well today Some were amazing. Harbhajan was brilliant right through the tournament. The Aussies were under pressure to perform. My message to Joginder in the final over was just go out there and enjoy the moment. We expect a tough game and healthy rivalry in the final. 

ADAM GILCHRIST: It was an amazing spectacle. This tournament has been enjoyable India were the deserving winners and there were a couple of moments when they performed better than us. Certain Indian bowlers did a very good job There was very little room for error. The Indians bowled straight and maintained a good line. All credit to them. 

YUVRAJ SINGH (MoM): Just wanted to play positive cricket To beat Australia we needed to play well and have runs on the board. We had a few good overs and that paid off in the end. All credit to India, says GilchristThe elbow is still a bit sore but as long as we win its okay. It will be a great final against Pakistan. The entire world will be watching Its like a dream for us.

 Worrells home torn down

Bridgetown: The boyhood home of the late Sir Frank Worrell was torn down to make way for a museum for the West Indies cricket great. 

Bostonville, as the house was named, was demolished at the weekend after being in a state of disrepair for several years. It was built just outside the gate of the historic Empire Club in the suburb of Bank Hall. 

The government decided to tear down the house after it became a home for vagrants and drug dealers. The ministry of works is leading a project to rebuild the home into a tribute to Worrell, who died in 1967. 

The centre will be restored as it was before to become a faithful reproduction of Bostonville, ministry spokesman Lionel Weekes said on Monday. (AP)

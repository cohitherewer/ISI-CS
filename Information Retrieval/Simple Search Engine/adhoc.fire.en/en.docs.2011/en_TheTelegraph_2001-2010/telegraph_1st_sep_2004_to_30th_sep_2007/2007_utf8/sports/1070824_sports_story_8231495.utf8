The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sponsors wont be blacklisted

Mumbai: Indian cricket board said on Thursday that the decision to debar players joining the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL) from its activities would not apply to its sponsors. 

The BCCI will continue to deal with all their sponsors irrespective of whether they get associated with the Essel Group-floated ICL or not, its vice-president and marketing in-charge Lalit Modi said. 

We decided not to be associated with the players who join the ICL as we have trained them and spent money on their development. But the companies who are our sponsors are individual entities and are free to get associated with any other organisation. We will continue our relationship with them, Modi said. 

The BCCI had, at its Special General Meeting on August 21, passed a resolution unanimously that while players were free to join any other organisation, they would be barred from taking part in any activities by the board and would also not be entitled to any benefits from it. 

However, despite its ongoing tussle with the ICL, the BCCI will not stop payment of past dues to the players who have joined the ICL and all such pending amounts till the 2006-07 season will be cleared. (PTI)

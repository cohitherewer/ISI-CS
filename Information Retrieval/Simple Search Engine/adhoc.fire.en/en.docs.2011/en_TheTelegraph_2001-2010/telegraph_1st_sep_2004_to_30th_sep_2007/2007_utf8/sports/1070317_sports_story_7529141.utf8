 Mahindra deny EB win 

Mumbai: East Bengal let a two-goal cushion slip out of their hands and settled for 2-2 draw with the defending champions Mahindra United in the 11th ONGC Cup National Football League at the Cooperage on Friday. 

Edmilson scored for the Calcutta side in the 31st minute and then extended the lead 13 minutes after the break. The Brazilian forward was adjudged Man of the Match. 

Carlos Roberto Pereiras side, however, was guilty of defending too deep after taking the 2-0 lead and allowed Mahindra to stage the fightback. Dempo are currently leading the pack with 17 points, but Mahindra are in second place thanks to a better goal difference. 

Abhishek Yadav pulled one back for the hosts in the 78th minute and Andrew Menshah made it all square in the final minute. Both Mahindra and East Bengal are now on 15 points after Round VIII. 

Settling in quickly, Mahindra started off brightly as they looked good with their movement and quality of passing but failed to make the most of it due to poor finishing. East bengal keeper Abhra Mondal denied Mbaka Dady in the sixth minute. Against the run of play, Mahesh Gawli tripped Edmilson inside the box and the Brazilian neatly converted from the spot. 

Mahindra pushed hard in hunt of the equaliser but were undone by another awful piece of work at the back in the 58th minute. Edmilson scored following a goalkick, even though keeper Sandip Nandy and Gawli were stranded confused, without challenging the rival. 

East Bengal retreated to their zoneonce Alvito DCunha and Edmilson were substituted in the second half. But all credit to Mahindra who regrouped and fought back to gain something from this important clash. 

East Bengals Izumi Arata, Abhra and Jayanta Sen and Mahindras NP Pradeep were cautioned in the match.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Million-dollar boost for WI

Melbourne: The cash-strapped West Indies

 cricket board has received a boost with Texas billionaire Allen Stanford

 announcing a fresh US$ 100-million investment to revive the games fortunes

 in the Caribbean. 

This wont be just cricket, this will be a life-changing experience, Stanford said. 

We cant wait two decades to regain the golden era of the West Indies cricket. We are stuck in the 1950s and 60s. We cant allow ourselves to stay stuck forever. We have to come into the 21st century, he was quoted as saying by an Australian daily. 

The money would be spent on developing cricket at the grassroots level and grooming youngsters for the second edition of the Stanford Twenty20 tournament early next year in which 21 teams will compete for US$ one million. Stanford had reportedly spent over US $ 35 million on the first edition last year. 

Im investing a lot of money in this thing and at some point I expect to make a profit something that needs to happen for the longevity of the programme and will provide essential funding for the West Indies cricket, Stanford said. 

I have committed my resources and I believe that within those five years well have a world-beating the West Indies team again, he added. 

The Stanford Twenty20 project incidentally has former greats like Sir Garfield Sobers, Viv Richards, Curtly Ambrose and Michael Holding as its board of directors. 

Meanwhile, former West Indies fast bowler Courtney Walsh believes that Cuba has natural cricketing talent and could become a force in the game. 

There is some very good talent in Cuba and they are natural cricketers there but they do need help and Im happy that we will be going there to advance the sport, said the Jamaican, who took 519 wickets in 132 Tests. (PTI)

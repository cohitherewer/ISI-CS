 Hingis sails into Round II

 Australian Hardcourt 

Sydney: Martina Hingis capped off her first full year back in professional tennis with a straight sets win over Austrias Sybille Bammer in the opening round of the Australian womens hardcourt championships on Sunday. 

Back playing at the same Gold Coast centre court where she relaunched her career in January, Hingis swept to a 6-0, 6-2 win and a second round clash with either Russian Elena Bovina or Australian wildcard Nicole Pratt. 

Ill have a day off tomorrow and I can probably toast the win at midnight, Hingis told reporters after her match ended just before New Years Eve celebrations were in full swing. She had to take a high risk because I wasnt missing. 

I was very focused and didnt have ups and downs. That was quite surprising after a six week break. 

Hingis made the semi-finals in her comeback at the Gold Coast despite being a bundle of nerves in her first tournament for three tears. 

But the 26-year-old was a model of composure this time.

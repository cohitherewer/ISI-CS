 Harikrishna wins, back in joint lead

Montreal: P. Harikrishna regained the lead in the eighth Montreal International tournament, outplaying Canadian Grandmaster Mark Bluvshtein in an intense fifth round battle here. 

The Indian GM bounced back from his fourth-round loss with a hard-fought victory to join Vassily Ivanchuk, Sergei Tiviakov and Gata Kamsky in the lead with 3.5 points each. 

Ivanchuk and Kamsky stayed in the lead by drawing their mutual encounter, while Tiviakov displaced erstwhile leader Pavel Eljanov by beating him in a thrilling game. 

Eljanov is in the fifth place with 3.0 points, half a point behind the leaders. 

Meanwhile, British GM Nigel Short ended his nightmarish run in the tournament by drawing against GM Emil Sutovsky of Israel after four losses in the first four rounds. 

In another match, GM Kamil Miton improved his standing with a victory against GM Pascal Charbonneau (Canada).

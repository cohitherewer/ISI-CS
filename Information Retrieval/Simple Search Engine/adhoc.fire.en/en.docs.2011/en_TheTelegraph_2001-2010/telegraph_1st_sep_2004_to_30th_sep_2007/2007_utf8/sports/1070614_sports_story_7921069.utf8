 Vaughans one-day value is low

Derek Pringle

 Michael Vaughan 

One of the more interesting topics aired by Michael Vaughan in last weeks controversial interview, and one overlooked once furore Fredalo took hold, was his take on one-day cricket and the role he might play as England prepare for the next World Cup in four years time. 

Ever the candid captain, he said he didnt think he would make the next World Cup, adding that if new coach Peter Moores wants to groom only those who will be around, he might well have to step down. 

It appears, on the face of it, to be a selfless gesture, but in the same breath Vaughan slips in that splitting the captaincy has never worked. The subtext being that he should continue to lead England in both forms of the game despite his and the teams moderate record in the one-day field. 

Perhaps it is not ideal to have more than one skipper, but Ricky Ponting and Steve Waugh rubbed along pretty well together while England won six matches out of 14 when Adam Hollioake took the one-day reins off Michael Atherton back in 1997. Hollioake had a higher win percentage than Vaughans if you exclude Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and the Associates countries. 

Few can carp about Vaughans pedigree as a Test batsman and captain. With an Ashes victory on his CV, he has just become Englands most successful Test captain with 21 wins, usurping Peter May at the head of the list. But his one-day batting average after 86 internationals is 27.13, as compared with 43.4 in Tests. Captaincy has a tangible worth but with the averages of seven other leading inter-national captains ranging from 32.4 to 44.2, it has got to add exceptional value. 

He also says in the interview that his failings must be due to something mental rather than technical. I always feel form is not down to technique, he said. Its all about where you are mentally. There must be something holding me back in one-day cricket but Im baffled by it. When you average 27, you know you can play, but youre too inconsistent. 

Vaughan may be right about the mental block, as his one-day average for Yorkshire, at 28, is not much better. 

But he definitely has technical limitations too, ones shared by Andrew Flintoff, a player Vaughan singled out for Englands one-day failings in the last World Cup. Their shortcomings as one-day batsmen stem from striking the ball with the full face of the bat, hitting it back roughly from where it came rather than at an unpredictable angle. 

While recommended in the longer game, where scoring in front of the wicket is preferable, using the full face of the bat in one-day cricket makes shots and areas of scoring more predictable. 

To cash in, bowlers (at least those with control) simply set a straight field, use the short ball sparingly and dry up the runs, something Shaun Pollock did brilliantly against Vaughan in the World Cup. Once that happens and the pressure builds, bad choices of shot are made and wickets fall. 

Flintoff, at least when he is confident, has the means to overcome the squeeze by using his power to hit over the top for six. Vaughan doesnt possess the weight of stroke to do that regularly, despite his bold claim that he played with greater freedom for the 79 he made against the West Indies during his last one-day innings. 

Indeed, he averages 2.6 boundaries per knock for England, not the figures of a man about to re-invent himself as a pinch-hitter.

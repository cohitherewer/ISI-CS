 Akmal to be rested vs SA

 - No place for Kaneria in ODIs now, says captain Inzamam 

 Inzamam feels Kaneria can take 500 Test wickets, but he does not fit into the ODI side 

Karachi: Pakistan are set to rest wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal for the one-day series against South Africa after his horrendous performance behind the stumps in Test matches. 

Chief selector Wasim Bari, who is due to leave for South Africa soon to discuss with captain Inzamam-ul Haq and coach Bob Woolmer the final World Cup squad, said he had advised the team management to rest Akmal in the one-day series to allow him regain his confidence. 

He apparently has lost his confidence. Rashid Latif and Moin Khan have given him advice and I have also spoken to him, but he has not improved, Bari, himself a top-class wicketkeeper and former captain, said. 

Meanwhile, Inzamam believes that leg-spinner Danish Kaneria has improved a lot during the South Africa series but ruled out a place for him in the one-day team at the moment. 

Inzamam said Kaneria has the potential to take 500 Test wickets but does not fit into the one-day squad because the requirements of the shorter version of the game are different. (PTI)

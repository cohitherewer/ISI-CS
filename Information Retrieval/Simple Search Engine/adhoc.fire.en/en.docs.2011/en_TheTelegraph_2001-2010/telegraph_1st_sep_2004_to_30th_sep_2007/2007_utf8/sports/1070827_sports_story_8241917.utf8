 SA sweep series 

Harare: A record 186-run third wicket stand between AB de Villiers and Albie Morkel paved the way for South Africa to complete a 3-0 sweep of their one-day series against Zimbabwe on Sunday. 

De Villiers smashed 107 and Morkel made a career-best 97 to lead the visitors to a 28-run victory. 

Looking to overhaul South Africas total of 323 for nine, Zimbabwean captain Tatenda Taibu led from the front by scoring his maiden one-day century (107 not out) but the hosts ran out of overs and finished with 295 for seven.

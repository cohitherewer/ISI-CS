 We wont follow PCB: Shah

Mumbai: A day after the PCB took tough action against players by suspending their contracts, the BCCI made it clear that it wont follow suit. 

We dont have to follow the example of any other Board, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said on Sun-day. 

Indias dismal performance in the World Cup will be discussed at a specially convened BCCI working committee meeting on Friday in Mumbai. 

Shah said the players contracts, which would come up for discussions, may even be ratified in the meeting. 

The Indian team was travelling or was engaged in matches and the contracts could not be signed. Now the contracts are ready and may even be ratified at the meeting, Shah said. 

On whether the coach and managers reports would be tabled in the working committee meeting the next day (Saturday), the BCCI secretary said that only the very important portions, if they dealt with player disciplines, would be given to the members and not the entire reports which are confidential.

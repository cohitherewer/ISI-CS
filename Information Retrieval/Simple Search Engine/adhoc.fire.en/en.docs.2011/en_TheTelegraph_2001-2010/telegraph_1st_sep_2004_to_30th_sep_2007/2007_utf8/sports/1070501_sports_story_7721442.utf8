 Controversial exit for Barthez

Paris: Fabien Barthezs flamboyant career has almost certainly ended with a controversial exit in keeping with one of the worlds best but most eccentric goalkeepers. 

The former world and European champion had a fight with a Nantes fan after a home defeat on Saturday, turned in the keys to his club house and drove out of the Atlantic port city with his family in his car en route to an unknown destination. 

The 35-year-old said on Monday he had left Nantes because he feared for his safety and would not return. 

I will not play for Nantes again, Barthez told a French radio station. This has got nothing to do with football. I no longer feel safe there and its better for me to leave.

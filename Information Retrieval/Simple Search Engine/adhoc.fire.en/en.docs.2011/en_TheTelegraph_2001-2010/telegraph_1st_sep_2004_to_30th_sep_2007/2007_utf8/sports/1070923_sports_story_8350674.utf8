 India A win series

Dharamsala: India A won the series against South Africa A 1-0 after the second four-day match ended in a draw following abandonment of final days play due to heavy rains here on Saturday. 

No play was possible in the last three days due to heavy rains. Umpires S. K. Tarapore and G. A. Pratap Kumar after inspecting the ground called off the match at 10am as morning showers had left the outfield waterlogged on Saturday. 

South Africa, hoping to level the series, were 264 for four in 70 overs on the opening day after captain Boeta Dippenaar elected to bat but rain played spoilsport. 

Indian coach Paras Mhambrey was satisfied with the result and said the Mohammed Kaif-led team had won the first match in Delhi with an allround performance. 

We were looking forward to win the game and get the series 2-nil, but cant help the elements. I am happy with the first match in which we clinched the victory in three days. Our spinners troubled their batsmen and our batsmen scored doubles centuries. So it was a satisfying series for us, Mhambrey said. 

The coach agreed that the visitors were on their way to make a comeback into the series and it would have been a close match had it gone its full length. 

It would have been an interesting game and keenly contested. They have a number of Test players in their team and we were not taking them lightly. The match could have gone either way, he said. 

The former Mumbai player said he was not surprised to see the way South Africans handled the Indian spinners at the HPCA Stadium here. 

No, I wasnt surprised by their handling of the spinners. In the last game their strategy didnt work but they are good players who have played Tests and were expected to come up with a plan to bounce back, he said. 

The two teams will now shift their focus to the three-match one-day series starting on Wednesday. (PTI)

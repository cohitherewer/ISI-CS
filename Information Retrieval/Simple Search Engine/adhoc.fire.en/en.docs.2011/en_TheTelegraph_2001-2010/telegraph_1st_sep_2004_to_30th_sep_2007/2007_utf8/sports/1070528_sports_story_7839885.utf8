The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 3rd days play washed out

Leeds: The third day of the second Test between England and the West Indies was abandoned without a single delivery being bowled at Headingley on Sunday. 

The visitors will enter Day IV on Monday still needing 402 runs to avoid an innings defeat. 

West Indies captain Ramnaresh Sarwan is almost certainly not going to bat because of a shoulder injury. 

Sundays washout means that the ECB will have to refund 450,000 to the spectators who were due to attend the sold-out match. (Agencies)

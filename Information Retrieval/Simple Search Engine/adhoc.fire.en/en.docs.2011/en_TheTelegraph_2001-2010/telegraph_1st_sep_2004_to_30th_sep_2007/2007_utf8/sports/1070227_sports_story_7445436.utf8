The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 DP Singh showcaused 

A CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: Diwakar Prasad Singh, at the centre of a controversy for allegedly taking external help during his matches, has been showcaused by the AICF. 

Disclosing this to The Telegraph, R.M. Dongre, chairman of the committee and AICF vice-president, said: We have sent him a set of 24 questions to which he has not replied. We have gone through his games during the period in question and prima facie they match with a particular chess playing programme. 

Singh, however, said: I have replied to the AICF questionnaire a couple of days back. My moves have matched with the computer because I had practised with it for nearly 12 hours.

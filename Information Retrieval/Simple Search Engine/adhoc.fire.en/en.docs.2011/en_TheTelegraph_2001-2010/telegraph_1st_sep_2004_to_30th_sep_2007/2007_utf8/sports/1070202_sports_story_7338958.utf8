 Nightmare should end with change in hotel

 - Accommodation problem for Deep and Co. 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai: The accommodation problem faced by the Bengal Ranji squad, which is in the city for the final, should end on Friday the opening day of the face-off against Mumbai. 

Owing to the absolute non-availability of rooms in quality hotels, the squad had to be booked at a vague place in Tardeo. The locality The rooms Weve had a nightmare, one of the seniors told The Telegraph. 

Apparently, it got to such a stage that captain Deep Dasgupta had to sleep on the floor, otherwise roommate Ranadeb Bose couldnt have (diagonally, at that) slept on what obviously was an apology of a double bed! 

From Friday, however, the Mumbai Cricket Association has been able to book rooms at the Taj President. 

Sourav Ganguly, who flew in from Vadodara on Wednesday night itself, checked-in at the CCI as the Tardeo hotel could have posed a security problem too. He may choose to stay on there. 

Because of the distances involved in intra-city travel, the Mumbai squad has been put up at the CCI, which is pretty close to the Wankhede.

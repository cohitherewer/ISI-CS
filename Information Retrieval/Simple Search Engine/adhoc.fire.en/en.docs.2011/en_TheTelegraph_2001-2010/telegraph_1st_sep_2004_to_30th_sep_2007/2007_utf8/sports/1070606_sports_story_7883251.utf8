The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 John Emburey is candidate No. 2 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Bangalore: Englishman John Emburey, whod turned down an invitation from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to appear for an interview 25 months ago, is the mysterious candidate No. 2 for the coachs job. 

As in 2005, when Greg Chappell eventually got it, Sunil Gavaskar is the one who took the initiative to get Emburey invited. The former captain is one of seven members on the special committee empowered to select the next coach. 

One of Gavaskars colleagues on the committee, though, wasnt impressed. I think Embureys name got proposed because another former captain (Ravi Shastri) had made out a case for Graham Ford, the gentleman told The Telegraph. 

Both Ford and Emburey, who is Middlesexs director of cricket, have to make a presentation in Chennai on Saturday.

 Zaheer accepts apology

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Nottingham: Man-of-the-Match Zaheer Khan has accepted England captain Michael Vaughans apology (conveyed through the media) for the jelly beans episode at Trent Bridge. 

If he has said that, then its okay... Weve won the Test and have taken the lead... Now, its time to look ahead and prepare for the third and final Test, Zaheer told The Telegraph late on Tuesday. 

 The Indians leave for Leicester on Wednesday morning.

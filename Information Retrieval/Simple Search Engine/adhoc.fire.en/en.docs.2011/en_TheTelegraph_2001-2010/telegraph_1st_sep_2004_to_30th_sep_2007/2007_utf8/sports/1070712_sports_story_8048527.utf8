Kuala Lumpur: Three-time champions Iran recovered from an early setback with two second-half goals for a 2-1 win over Uzbekistan in their opening Asian Cup match on Wednesday. 

The win put Iran in second place behind China in group C on goal differences. They are now slated to face China on Sunday. 

The Iranians had the best early shot against Uzbekistan, with Vahid Hashemian unable to finish off a good chance created by Ali Karimi, but it was a defensive blunder that cost them the first goal. 

Defender Rahman Rezaeis attempt to clear a long lob from Uzbek midfield playmaker Server Djeparov in the 16th minute resulted in an own goal. 

Iran threw everything in search of the equaliser but were lucky not to concede a second goal when Uzbeks midfielder Timur Kapadzes glancing header from Djeparovs freekick just missed the target. 

Javad Kazemian replaced Rassoul Khatibi after the break and Irans attack intensified, resulting in goals in the 55th and 78th minutes. 

Seyed Hosseinis header from Mehdi Mahdavikias corner gave Iran the equaliser and Kazemian latched onto a pass from Karimi to fire the winner. 

In between the Iran goals, Djeparov created another chance for Kapadze, who was unable to convert his one-on-one position against Iran goalkeeper Hassan Roudbarian in the 72nd minute. 

Iran coach Amir Ghalenoei, who was banished to the bleachers for excessive arguing with the referee late in the second half, said his team deserved the three points. 

Uzbekistan is a well-prepared team but it was the mistake of our defence which gifted the goal, he said. We changed the tactics in the second half and that produced the right results for us. 

Uzbekistans next match is against Malaysia on Saturday. 

Meanwhile, Indonesia have promised to improve ticketing for the next Asian Cup match after a chaotic first tie saw hundreds of fans break through an emergency exit and thousands more unable to get seats despite sections of the stadium being empty.

 SPORT BRIEFS 

 Aussie A tour on, says PCB

 Karachi: The Australia A cricket team would continue with their tour as per the schedule despite the twin blasts that rocked Rawalpindi on Tuesday, board officials said.

 Shafqat Naghmi, chief executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), said the Australians had not expressed any concerns and were given a detailed briefing on the security situation.

 ldquo;These incidents are sad and shocking. They don rsquo;t help our cause at all. There was also a blast in Lahore when they were here last time in 2005 hellip; But they stayed on. Even when their inspection team was here last month a blast took place in Islamabad, rdquo; Naghmi said.

 PCB may rope in Buchanan

 Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is trying to secure the services of former Australian coach John Buchanan for improving the standard of its National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Lahore.

 ldquo;We want to use Buchanan rsquo;s expertise for the cricket academy and training our coaches, rdquo; a board official said.

 Buchanan stepped down as coach of the Australian team after their World Cup win in March.

 The PCB chief executive is currently in Australia where he met Buchanan to discuss the planned appointment. 

 According to the official, Buchanan had shown interest in working with Pakistan cricket. Chances are that the Aussie would visit the country early next year for a couple of days to implement his ideas and system. ldquo;We are keen to work with Buchanan because he is one of the best coaches right now hellip; He is behind the success of the Australian cricket system, rdquo; the official said.

 Jaipur inspection

 Jaipur: The Sawai Man Singh Stadium, seeking the official nod to become a permanent Test venue, was on Tuesday inspected by ICC representative and former Australian player Allan Hurst.

 The stadium hosted one Test (India versus Pakistan) in 1986, but thereafter it has hosted only ODIs which included the Champions Trophy ties last year.

 Hurst, a former pacer, was reportedly happy with the facilities.

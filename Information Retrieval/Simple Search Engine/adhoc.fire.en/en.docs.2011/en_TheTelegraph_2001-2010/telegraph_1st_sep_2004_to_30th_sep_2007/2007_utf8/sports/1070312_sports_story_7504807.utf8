 Empire romps home to Invitation 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Trainer S. Ganapathys prized horse Southern Empire on Sunday had an easy measure of his stablemate Diabolical in the 2,400m Indian Turf Invitation Cup, the star event in the Indian racing calendar. Jockey Colm Donoghue partnered the Placerville-Stunning son to a distance victory and, in the process, avenged the defeat he had suffered at the hands of Diabolical in the Indian Derby barely a month ago. 

 The victory for Southern Empire, a 6-10 hot-favourite, looked almost certain from the 600m marker after Donoghue had established a marginal lead over Daibolical. The Indian Derby winner had earlier assumed the charge of running from Red Apache halfway through the trip. Once in front, the favourite stretched out well and it was an armchair ride for the Irish jockey.

 The Maj. P. K. Mehra Memorial Super Mile Cup went to another Ganapathy favourite, Secret Memory, who handed a sound thrashing to his stablemate, Haunting Memories eyeing for a rare double after winning the Sprinters Cup on Saturday. 

 The afternoon, on the whole, was well attended and was very enjoyable for punters, bookmakers and the visiting Turf Authority of India delegates. The weekend fields were small but very competitive. We had a good day, said S.K.Sharma, RCTC bookmakers president. Five favourites obliged in a card of eight events, leaving punters in a happy frame of mind.

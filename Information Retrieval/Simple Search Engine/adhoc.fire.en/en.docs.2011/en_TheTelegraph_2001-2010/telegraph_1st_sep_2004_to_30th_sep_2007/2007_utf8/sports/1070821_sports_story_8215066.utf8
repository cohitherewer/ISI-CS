 Federer 

Cincinnati: World No. 1 Roger Federer raced to a 6-1, 6-4 victory over American James Blake on Sunday to win the Cincinnati Masters and claim his 50th career singles title. 

The Swiss broke the American twice in the opening set and once in the second to wrap up his 14th Masters Series title in 65 minutes. 

The scoreboard may not show it but today I definitely had to play my best to win. It was a great week for me and Im now really excited about the US Open. (Reuters)

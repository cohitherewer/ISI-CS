 Paes in mixed final, Sania out

 Leander Paes celebrates his victory in the mixed doubles on Tuesday 

New York: Leander Paes and Meghann Shaughnessy fought back from a set down to beat Liezel Huber of the United States and Jamie Murray of Britain and storm into the final of the mixed doubles competition of US Open here. 

The Indo-US pair came through a gruelling semi-final encounter to score a 6-7 (4), 7-6 (5), 10-5 win. They set up a clash with Victoria Azarenka and Max Mirnyi of Belarus in the final. 

Azarenka and Mirnyi got the better of Zi Yan of China and Mark Knowles of Bahamas 7-6 (5), 6-4 in the other semi-final. 

Meanwhile, Sania Mirza and her partner Bethanie Mattek of US crashed out in the quarter finals, losing 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to Chan Yung-Jan and Chuang Chia-Jung of Chinese Taipei. 

Paes will be aiming at his eighth Grand Slam win of his career. Paes, along with Martin Damm, won the mens doubles title here last time, but the Indo-Czech pair was ousted in the very first round this year. 

That was Paess last win in a Grand Slam. He has so far won four mens doubles titles three of which came alongside Mahesh Bhupathi and three mixed doubles crown. 

His first mixed doubles title came with Lisa Raymond as partner in Wimbledon 1999, and thereafter he won twice with Martina Navratilova in 2003 Wimbledon and Australian Open. Sania, meanwhile, believed she and Mattek were well-matched on and off the court despite the loss. 

I guess opposites attract, said the Indian, who wore a red shirt and white shorts, while flamboyant partner Mattek sported an outlandish leopard-skin outfit with matching visor. 

I think girls are dressing up a lot. I think its a very personal thing. I dont know if its good for the sport but if it attracts people, then fine. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No fears, reiterates minister

A STAFF REPORTER

 National Games 

Calcutta: Caught in a precarious situation between threat from Ulfa militants and the prospect that some of the countrys top stars may skip the National Games, the Assam government has insisted that the meet will be the biggest-ever and will truly capture the cultural and social mosaic of the state. 

Addressing the media here on Wednesday, Assams power and industries minister Pradyut Bordoloi claimed that 33 states with about 10,000 athletes have already confirmed participation in the 10-day event, starting on February 9. 

We are determined to break the myth about Assam being unsafe and insecure. Apart from 20 company of paramilitary forces, we are also going to set up a special cell to make the Games security full proof. Like Phantom in the comic strip, you may not see our security personnel but they will be omnipresent to ensure nothing untoward takes place, Bordoloi said. 

However, Bordoloi described as unfortunate the news that top names in Indian sports such as Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, Jaspal Rana, Gagan Narang, Anju Bobby George and Kunjurani Devi may stay away on security grounds. 

I cant verify. But if they dont come, it will be unfortunate, Bordoloi, who is also chairman of the Games reception committee, maintained.

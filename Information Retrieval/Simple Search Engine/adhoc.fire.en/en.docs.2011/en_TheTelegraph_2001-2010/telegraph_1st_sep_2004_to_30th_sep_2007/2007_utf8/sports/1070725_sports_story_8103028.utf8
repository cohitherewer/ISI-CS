The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Toast of the British media

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mahendra Singh Dhonis heroic unbeaten 76, which to a large extent helped India avoid defeat in the first Test at Lords on Monday, has earned him a lot of accolades in the British media. The following is what the British newspapers had to say about him on Tuesday, a day after the swashbuckling wicketkeeper-batsman curbed his natural instincts to stay put at the crease and frustrate England (in alphabetical order): 

DAILY MAIL: If England deserved to win because of superb displays by their inexperienced attack and a worldclass innings from Kevin Pietersen, India could take immense credit for recovering so well. At the centre of their resistance Monday was a batsman known more for his explosive rather than adhesive qualities. 

When Mahendra Singh Dhoni was in this situation against England last year in Mumbai, he lost his head and offered not one, but two, steepling catches to Panesar. This time Dhoni, ill at ease against the moving ball in the first innings, rode his initial luck to become the man England could not remove, finishing unbeaten on 76 and offering glimpses of his undoubted talent for striking a cricket ball extremely hard. 

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH: India and their legion of fans will thank their wicketkeeper, Dhoni, who played a fine, controlled innings of 76 not out. With a poor forecast, again, England bowlers had known they could not tarry and they did not. That it was thwarted was due to some fine batting from Dhoni. 

THE GUARDIAN: India escaped defeat thanks to the bad weather and an unbeaten 76 from Dhoni. Over the three and a half hours he was at the crease, female Indian hearts will have been throbbing like diesel engines. 

Given that England could not wait to get Dhoni to the crease, such is their lack of regard for him in any capacity other than as a colossal striker of the ball, he batted with considerable skill and character. 

THE TIMES, LONDON: Dhoni, in need of a good innings, was Indias final saviour, resisting his temptation to attack with abandon, yet refusing to get bogged down.

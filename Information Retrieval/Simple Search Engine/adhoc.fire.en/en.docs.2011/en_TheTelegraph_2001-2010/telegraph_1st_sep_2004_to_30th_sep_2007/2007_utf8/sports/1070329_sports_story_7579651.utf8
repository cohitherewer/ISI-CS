 Md. Sporting lose to JCT

Mumbai: Former champions JCT started off their second-leg campaign in the 11th National Football League with a 2-0 victory over Calcutta outfit Mohammedan Sporting here Wednesday. 

Enjoying the better of the exchanges for a major part of the game, JCT got their campaign back on track courtesy first-half goals from Baldeep Singh and Sunil Chettri. 

JCT, thus, took their tally to 12 points from 10 matches, while Mohammedan Sporting (seven) continue to remain in the shadows of relegation.

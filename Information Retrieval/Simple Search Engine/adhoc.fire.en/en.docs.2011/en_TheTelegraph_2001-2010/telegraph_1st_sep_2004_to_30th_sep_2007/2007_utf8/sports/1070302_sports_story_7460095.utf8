 Mahmood cleared by ICC

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The World Cup Technical Committee has approved Azhar Mahmood as a replacement for Abdul Razzaq in Pakistans squad. 

According to information received here, the confirmation was conveyed to Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) in an email from David Richardson (ICC General Manager Cricket and chairman of the Technical Committee) on Thursday. 

Mahmood replaces Razzaq after the latter was reportedly advised to take at least three weeks rest following a knee injury during a training session in Lahore earlier this week. 

Mahmood is the second replacement to be called up for the tournament after Australias Stuart Clark.

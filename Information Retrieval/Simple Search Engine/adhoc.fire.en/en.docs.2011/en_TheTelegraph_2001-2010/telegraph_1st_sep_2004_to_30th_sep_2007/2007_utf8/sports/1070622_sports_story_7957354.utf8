 Shane Warne takes Hampshire to final

 Shane Warne 

London: Shane Warne claimed two crucial wickets to help Hampshire set up a Friends Trophy Provident summit clash with Durham on Wednesday. 

Hampshire looked as if they could be in trouble against Warwickshire after managing a total of 206 for seven from their 50 overs. 

But Warne took the wickets of Heath Streak and left-hander Jim Troughton as Warwickshire fell 40 runs short of the target. 

John Crawley top-scored for the home side with 65, outshining Kevin Pietersen, whose attempt to flay the bowling of his Maritzburg college-mate Tim Groenewald ended on 18. 

In the other semi-final, discarded England bowler Liam Plunkett took four for 15 and then hit an unbeaten 30 with the bat to steer Durham to victory over Essex. Plunkett claimed his career best figures as Essex were skittled out for 71. (AFP)

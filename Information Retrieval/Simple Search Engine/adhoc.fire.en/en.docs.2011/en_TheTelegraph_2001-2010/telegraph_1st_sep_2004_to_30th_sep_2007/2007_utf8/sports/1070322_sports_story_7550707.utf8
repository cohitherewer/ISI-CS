 Inzamam bids tearful farewell to ODIs

Kingston: Imran Nazir cracked a sparkling 160 as Pakistan scored 349 for their highest World Cup total, against Zimbabwe in their final match at Sabina Park on Wednesday. 

In an emotion-filled morning, which included a one-minute silence following the death of Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer on Sunday and then a guard of honour send-off for departing skipper Inzamam-ul Haq, Nazir dominated. 

Pakistan were playing for pride having already been eliminated following defeats to the West Indies and Ireland. 

Nazirs career-best, made off 121 deliveries, included 14 boundaries and a joint World Cup record eight sixes. Only Australia captain Ricky Ponting has scored as many at a World Cup, in the 2003 final. 

Nazir was the mainstay of Pakistans innings by a long way as the next highest scorer was Inzamam with 37, his final innings in a one-day International and as captain. Inzamam left the field in tears. 

Zimbabwe, though, required a win to maintain hopes of a Super Eights place. That looked to be unlikely as they required about seven runs an over. 

Nazir was fortunate to survive when he was on 31 after Gary Brent trapped him on the crease and television replays suggested he should have been leg before.

He also skied Brent to deep backward square leg when on 81 but Friday Kasteni dropped a straightforward catch and Nazir picked up a single. But he deserved his luck with some exhilarating stroke play. 

When past three figures, Nazir crashed left-arm spinner Sean Williams for six over midwicket and then showed enough composure to dab the next ball to the vacant third man boundary for four. Nazirs previous highest score was 105 not out, his only other one-day century, also made against Zimbabwe. Pakistans total was also the eighth-highest in a World Cup match. 

Inzamam went in to bat at number four, a place higher than usual, and he immediately set about the Zimbabwe attack in the penultimate Group D match. 

It was clear he was keen to go out in style before his eventual cameo was halted on 37 from 35 balls. 

Playing his final ODI and last match as captain he still intends to play Tests Inzamam cracked two boundaries and three sixes before miscuing a big hit to mid-off. 

All of the Zimbabwe players sportingly shook Inzamams hand on his way off the field and his teammates formed a guard of honour through which he passed wiping tears from his face. 

Emotions were running high for other reasons also, as Pakistan lost their coach Bob Woolmer on Sunday, when he was found unconscious in his hotel room and later died. His death was regarded as suspicious by Jamaican police. 

Inzamam, 37, was playing his 378th one-day International and finished with 11,739 runs in ODIs at an average of 39.52. 

Only Sachin Tendulkar has scored more one-day runs with 14,847, and only the Indian maestro (383) and Sri Lankas Sanath Jayasuriya (381) have played in more ODIs. 

PAK-ING TROUBLE

 Pakistan have never had smooth trips to the West Indies in the past and at

 least on three occasions, they have been involved in police cases in the Caribbean.

 The following is a brief look at those incidents: 

 1987 mdash; Leg-spinner

 Abdul Qadir clashed with a spectator and faced legal action 

 1993 mdash; Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Mushtaq Ahmed were hauled for

 illegal possession of marijuana from a beach in Grenada and jailed and the

 case was only dropped after hectic efforts from the Pakistan Cricket Board.

 1997 mdash; A Pakistan under-19 cricketer, Zeeshan Pervaz was accused of

 raping a married woman in Jamaica and had to face a court case before he was

 released.

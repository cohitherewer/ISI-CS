 Morozevich holds Anand

Mexico City: Viswanathan Anand settled for a draw in the fourth round against Alexander Morozevich in the World Chess Championships in Mexico. 

Anand, with a draw in 57 moves, stays in shared lead with Vladimir Kramnik, both having 2.5 points from four games. 

Four players, including Moro, Alexander Grischuk, Boris Gelfand and Lev Aronian have two points. Peter Leko and Peter Svidler have 1.5 points each. 

For the third day in a row Anand was in a featured game considered to be one of the most original top class players. Moro had just recovered from the second-round loss to Kramnik and the outplayed Svidler in third. 

The Moro-Anand game went into the fashionable Meran variation of the Slav defence. The duo played at a blitz-like speed along well known lines. 

Anand, showing good preparations, came up with a new plan and Morozevich had to find how to react, as such positions could easily turn in blacks favour. 

In another game, Kramnik was held to a draw by Grischuk in 60 moves from a Catalan. Grischuk fought well and held out for a good draw. 

Aronian handed Leko a solid defeat in 45 moves and Svidler and Gelfand were engaged in a short 24move draw from Petroff. (PTI)

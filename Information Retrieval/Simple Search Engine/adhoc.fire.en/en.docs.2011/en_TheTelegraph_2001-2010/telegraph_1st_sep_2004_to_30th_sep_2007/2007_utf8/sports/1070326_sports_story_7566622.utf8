 AUSTRALIA-SA HIGHLIGHTS

 Ricky Ponting (when on 8) became the seventh batsman and the first Australian to aggregate over 10000 runs in ODIs. He now has 10083 runs in 272 matches for Australia and World XI. 

 Matthew Haydens maiden WC hundred, which came in just 66 balls was the fastest ever in the WC. He just managed to outdo the previous best of 67 balls by Canadian John Davison (against West Indies in Centurion in 2003). For the record, Haydens previous best in WC was the 88 (in 73 balls) against Namibia in Potchefstroom in 2003. 

 In achieving the above, Hayden now holds the record for the quickest hundred by an Aussie in ODIs. Fellow teammate Adam Gilchrist had made a 67-ball century against Sri Lanka in Brisbane in February 2006. 

 It was also the eighth fastest hundred in terms of balls in ODI history and the quickest ever against South Africa in ODIs. Englands Kevin Pieterson had made a 69-ball century at East London in February 2005. 

 Incidentally, it was the first by an Aussie opener in the WC since Mark Waughs 104 against Zimbabwe at Lords in the 1999 edition of the WC. 

 Meanwhile, Hayden, when on 71, became the tenth Australian to aggregate 5000 runs in ODIs. He now has 5030 runs in 137 matches. 

 Pontings two sixes has taken his tally of sixes in the WC to a record 27, which takes him past the 25 sixes by Sourav Ganguly. Just behind them is South African Herschelle Gibbs with 22 sixes. 

 For the second time in two matches, Michael Clarke (92) was missing WC hundred (he had made an unbeaten 93 against The Netherlands in the previous match). He now becomes the seventh batsman in ODIs to record two consecutive scores in the 90s. However Clarke becomes the first to do so in the WC tournament. 

 With both Ponting (91) and Clarke (92) missing their hundreds in the same match it provided the seventh instance in ODIs of two batsmen making scores in the 90s. It was also the second instance in the WC after West Indians Gordon Greenidge (90) and Viv Richards (95*) did so against Australia at Lords in 1983 WC. 

 For the first time in ODI history, three batsmen made scores in the 90s in the same match. Ponting (91) and Clarke (92) for Australia and De Villiers (92) for South Africa. 

 Shaun Pollock (0/83 in 10 overs) has now conceded the most runs by a South African bowler in a WC match. 

 With teammate Charl Langeveldt (1/82 in 10 overs) also conceding over 80 runs in the match, it provided the only second instance of two bowlers from the same team conceding 80-plus runs in a WC match. In the 1999 WC match in Taunton Sri Lankan bowlers Chaminda Vaas and Eric Upashantha conceded 84 and 80 runs, respectively, during their 10-over spells against India. 

 Australias 377/6 was their second highest total in ODIs and their highest in any WC match. Interestingly, Australias best is the 434/4 they made against the South Africans when the last time the two teams met each other in an ODI. This means in their last two ODI matches against the South Africans, the Aussies have managed to aggregate 811 runs in 100 overs. 

 Australia became the only second team after Sri Lanka to score 300-plus runs in five consecutive innings in ODIs. Incidentally the Aussies also became the first team to do this four times in a row in the WC. 

 AB de Villiers (on 20) became the 19th South African batsman to aggregate 1000-plus runs in ODIs. 

 The stand of 160 runs between de Villiers and Graeme Smith was South Africas best against the Aussies for the first wicket. Their only other 100-plus opening stand before this against Australia was the 118 run partnership put on between Andrew Hudson and Gary Kirsten in Indore in 1996. 

 Nathan Bracken claimed his 100th wicket (Ntini) to become the 13th Australian to do so. By doing so in his 60th match, he has achieved this landmark the second quickest, in terms of least ODIs, by an Australian bowler after Brett Lee, who needed just 55 matches. In fact, two other Australian bowlers, Dennis Lillee and Shane Warne, also needed 60 matches to achieve their respective landmarks of 100 ODI wickets. 

 The match aggregate of 671 runs (Australia 377 and South Africa 294) was the highest for any WC match. The previous best was the 652 runs in the WC match between Sri Lanka (398) and Kenya (254) in Kandy in 1996. 

 This win was Pontings 108th as captain in 141 ODIs. This is now the most by any captain in ODIs. He went ahead of Allan Borders record of 107 wins in 178 matches as captain in ODIs. For the record, among current skippers New Zealands Stephen Fleming has most wins (94) after Ponting. 

 Australia have not lost a WC game in their last 21 matches. This sequence includes 20 wins and one tie! Their last WC defeat came against Pakistan in Leeds by 10 runs on May 23, 1999.

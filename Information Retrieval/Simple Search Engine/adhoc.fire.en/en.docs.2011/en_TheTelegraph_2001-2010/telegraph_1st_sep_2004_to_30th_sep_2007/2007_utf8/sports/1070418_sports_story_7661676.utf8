 Pakistan, Lanka may play in Sharjah

Karachi: International cricket could return to Sharjah in May if Pakistan and Sri Lanka accept an offer from the Cricketers Benefit Fund Series (CBFS) and shift a proposed ODI series from Abu Dhabi, where the local association is facing a funds crunch. 

A PCB official confirmed that the series with Sri Lanka had become doubtful after the Abu Dhabi Cricket Council (ADCC) conveyed to both the Pakistan and Sri Lanka boards it was facing financial problems. 

Now we have an offer from the Abdul Rehman Bukhatir-led CBFS which says they can host the matches at a short notice and meet all financial guarantees asked for by the teams, the official said. 

Pakistan and Sri Lanka have expressed keenness to play the series after the World Cup, and sources said neither board was happy about the fact that the ADCC was struggling to put together the series despite getting support from them. 

Incidentally, the ADCC conveyed its problems to Pakistan and Lankan officials after failing to convince their patron to give them a special $3m grant for the tournament. 

Abu Dhabi debuted as an international venue last year when India and Pakistan played two ODIs. The CBFS has not been able to host any tournament in Sharjah since April 2003. 

The CBFS offer is there and we also have in mind that Sharjah has been a popular venue for Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Also, with no international cricket having been held in Sharjah since 2003, it is guaranteed their will be full houses for all matches, the PCB official said. (PTI)

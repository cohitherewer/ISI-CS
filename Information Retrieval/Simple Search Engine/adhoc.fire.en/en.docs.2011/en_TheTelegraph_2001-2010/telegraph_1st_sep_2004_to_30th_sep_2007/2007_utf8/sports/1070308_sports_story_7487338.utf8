The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Port of Spain: The Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation (TTFF) has suspended all of its national team programmes except its under-17 side due to a funding squabble with the government, threatening the Soca Warriors participation in the Concacaf Gold Cup, its secretary general Richard Groden said on Tuesday.

 Groden said the Trinidad government has failed to live up to promises made by minister of sport and youth affairs Roger Boynes last year to provide funding to the federation, which Groden said had largely been supplied by Concacaf president and former TTFF president Jack Warner.

 New Delhi: Reigning champions JK Tyres have pulled out of the Indian National Rally Championship to protest the new rules framed by Motorsport Association of India (MAI).

 According to Sanjay Sharma, the head of motor sport, JK Industries, MAI has asked participants to compete with group N-Plus specifications (1400-1600cc). This would mean rise in costs as the cars would have to be modified. Also, the winners will now be assessed on the performance of three cars, instead of two.

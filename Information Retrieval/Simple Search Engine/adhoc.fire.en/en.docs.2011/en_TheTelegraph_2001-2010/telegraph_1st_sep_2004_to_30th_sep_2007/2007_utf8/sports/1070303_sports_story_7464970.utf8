Calcutta: Three Grandmasters Sergei Tiviakov, Tigran Petrosian and Darmen Sadvakasov share the lead with five points each after round VI of the Calcutta Open chess at Gorky Sadan on Friday. 

With no clear leader in sight, the meet is still wide open. 

On the top board, overnight leaders Petrosian and Sadvakasov preferred to slug it out in a sharp Sicilian Dragon. Sadvakasov obtained a passed e-pawn, but his weakness on the kingside allowed Petrosian to force a draw. 

Top seed Tiviakov made short work of Sriram Jha in a Ruy Lopez opening. The Dutch won two minor pieces for a rook in the 27th move. His two strong bishops coupled with Jhas weakened kingside forced the latters resignation. 

Diwakar Prasad Singh once again produced a dazzling game, this time against GM Mekheil Kekelidze of Georgia. 

Kekelidze was stunned by Diwakars pawn sacrificeon the 25th move in a Queens Indian defence. By move 33, Diwakar was already better, though the game lasted 50 moves.

 Pollock takes 5 as Pak fall for 153

 - FINAL ODI 

Johannesburg: Shaun Pollock took five wickets on Wednesday to help dismiss Pakistan for 153 in the teams fifth and final ODI. 

Pollock took the first five wickets to fall, bowling unchanged for his full 10-over spell. 

Pakistan, attempting to tie the series at 2-2, won the toss and elected to bat at the Wanderers. However, Pollock struck in his first over with Mohammad Hafeez edging a catch to Mark Boucher before a run was scored. 

Imran Nazir tried to hit back and top edged an attempted pull for Pollock to take a return catch and dismiss him for 22. 

Younis Khan then dragged a delivery onto his stumps for 19, and Pollock trapped Mohammad Yousuf leg-before-wicket for five. 

He got his fifth wicket when he got Inzamam-ul-Haq to attempt a cut, only to edge to Jacques Kallis at second slip for a duck. 

Shoaib Malik attempted to hold the innings together, but the rest of the South Africa bowlers kept up the pressure, and he was left undefeated on 43 with the innings over in 41.5 overs. 

Kallis took two for 19 off six overs, and Makhaya Ntini, Andrew Hall and Charl Langeveldt took one each. (AP)

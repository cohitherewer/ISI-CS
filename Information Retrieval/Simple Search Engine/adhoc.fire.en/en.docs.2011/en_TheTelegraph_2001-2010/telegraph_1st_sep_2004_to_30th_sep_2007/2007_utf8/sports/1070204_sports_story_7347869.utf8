 Maliks ban may be lifted

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Salim Malik could have the life ban on him for alleged involvement in match fixing lifted by the Supreme Court, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) sources said Saturday. 

Malik moved the Supreme Court after his appeal was rejected in all the lower courts of the country. His petition is now being heard by a bench headed by the chief justice of Pakistan. 

The chief justice appears keen to reach a conclusion on the appeal. At the first hearing on Thursday he made it clear he wanted to know under which laws was Malik banned and also talked about the evidences to support the ban, a PCB source said.

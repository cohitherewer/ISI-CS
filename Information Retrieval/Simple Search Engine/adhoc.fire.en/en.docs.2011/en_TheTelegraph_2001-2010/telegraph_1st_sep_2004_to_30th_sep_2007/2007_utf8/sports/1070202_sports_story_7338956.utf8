 More injury woes for England 

Sydney: Embattled England received another injury setback Thursday, losing fast bowler James Anderson for the rest of the Tri-series ahead of their do-or-die clash against Australia. 

The tourists, who must win here Friday to have any realistic chance of making the finals, will also be without captain Michael Vaughan, while Australian skipper Ricky Ponting will undergo a late fitness test. 

Batsman Brad Hodge has also been called up as cover for Ponting who has a hip injury. 

Ricky suffered a slight strain in the hip region during training this afternoon and will be reviewed tomorrow morning before play where a final decision will be made on his availability, team physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said in a Cricket Australia statement Thursday. 

Australia, already through to the finals after six wins from six matches, will also hand a one-day debut to lightning quick Shaun Tait. 

Englands Anderson was flown home after suffering a recurrence of a long-standing back problem, with officials keen to make sure he is available for next months World Cup. 

Brett Lee was set to make way for the talented Tait and Stuart Clark was recalled at the expense of Mitchell Johnson. (Agencies)

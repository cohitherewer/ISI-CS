The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Laras birthday gift for a special Sachin

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sachin and Lara 

Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar, who turns 34 on Tuesday, couldnt have hoped for a more comforting present, particularly with the Establishments knives out for him. 

He has a couple of years left in him, maybe even another World Cup. Hes a special player and knows what to do Besides being an outstanding cricketer, hes a wonderful person off the field 

Really, what can I say to him at this point Like me, he had a disappointing World Cup, but I think he knows best what to do Many cricketers have brought me a lot of joy, among others, friends like him 

That was Brian Lara during his last press conference (early hours of Sunday) as an international cricketer. 

The talismanic Trinidadian was referring to Sachin, with whom he had an epic batsman vs batsman rivalry. 

Sachin believes rivalries are between nations, but for over a decade and half, bilateral face-offs focused more on him and Lara. 

Of course there were occasions like when the West Indies toured India in late 2002 or when we visited the Caribbean last summer when one or the other wasnt available. 

Team Indias early exit from the ongoing World Cup meant another rivalry-chapter wouldnt be added. 

On the eve of the tournament, though, Sachin told The Telegraph: People keep projecting one rivalry or the other. Over the years, Ive featured in many, but I see rivalries as between countries. Sure there could be a personal element (between him and Lara), but we must not get stuck on individuals whore only part of the team. 

With Lara having called it a day, one cant think of any rivalry to match the one between him and Sachin. 

Ricky Ponting has been awesome in recent years, but he has been competing with himself! 

Then, theres the solid Rahul Dravid, who received the ultimate compliment from Lara: Rahul Dravid is one player I could go and watch. Come to think of it, if I wanted someone batting for my life, it would be Rahul. 

Kumar Sangakkara seems to be heading for greatness and one cant forget Jacques Kallis and Kevin Pietersen 

Terrific batsmen, yes, but one cant spot a rivalry. 

In fact, with Glenn McGrath just days away from joining Lara, there wont exactly be a riveting bowler vs batsman rivalry either. 

Footnote: I admit being in the limelight is tough, yet I make the effort to have a few quiet moments. I quite like the US where I simply get lost in a crowd. No cameras, no fans had been a Lara response during an exclusive interaction. Given the flood of emotions in Bridgetown, its inconceivable that fans and cameras wont continue to chase him.

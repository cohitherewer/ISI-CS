The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav skips indoor nets

 - Theres stiffness in the back from Lords, but its not a concern... 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Nottingham: Former captain Sourav Ganguly skipped Wednesdays indoor nets at the England amp; Wales Cricket Boards National Academy in neighbouring Loughborough, but insisted he would be fit for the second Test, which begins on Friday. 

Theres stiffness in the back from Lords, but its not a concern... I didnt bat only because nets was indoors... There are two days to go and Ill be fine, quot; he told The Telegraph. 

Besides receiving treatment from Team India physio John Gloster, Sourav engaged in physical training at the awe-inspiring Academy, which is part of the National Cricket Centre. The facilities are on the University of Loughborough campus. 

Even if one neednt be concerned about Souravs back, the weather is definitely causing concern. It rained throughout the day, ruining the Indians plans for a session at Trent Bridge. 

It was, by the way, a day off for the four specialist bowlers who played at Lords Zaheer Khan, Rudra Pratap Singh, Sreesanth and Anil Kumble. 

If Souravs back gets stiffer, then Yuvraj Singh is going to benefit. 

Making the XI or not isnt in my hands... Of course, Id love to play, he said, adding: Its disappointing that the batsmen didnt get many runs in the first Test (Lords), but a draw is a draw... Some of our batsmen have each played over 100 Tests and they need to be given respect... 

Yuvraj had a pretty long hit indoors and among the locals helping out was the patka-wearing offie, Suroop Singh. He doesnt bowl like Monty Panesar, but remarked that the England star had been an inspiration. 

Footnote: Its rare for Sourav to be presented with a bill after eating out in Calcutta. On most occasions, he gets nothing more than a token piece of paper. On Tuesday, even that wasnt presented after Sourav and family (wife Dona, daughter Sana) finished dinner at the enigmatically named 4550 Miles From Delhi restaurant. Weve been privileged, explained manager Lucas Lewis, while requesting Sourav to pose with his chefs.

 Miandad wants Yuvraj in XI

New Delhi: Thanks to a packed middle-order, Yuvraj Singhs chances of playing in the first Test against England look slim but former Pakistan captain Javed Miandad feels it would be a folly if the dashing left-hander is ignored. 

Heaping praise on Yuvraj, Miandad said the Punjab players abundant talent and electrifying fielding made him an automatic choice. 

It would be a great folly to ignore a player of Yuvrajs calibre, Miandad said. 

He is a supreme talent, one of the best in the game today. Besides, he brings the X-factor to the side with his fielding, the former Pakistan captain was quoted as saying by a website on Tuesday. 

Asked how could Yuvraj be accommodated, Miandad said Dinesh Karthik, despite his modest success, could be left out with flamboyant Mahendra Singh Dhoni continuing behind the stumps. (PTI)

Calcutta: East Bengal rode their luck to a 2-0 win over Eastern Railway in their second Premier Division match of the Calcutta Football League on Friday. 

On a sultry afternoon, the home team dished out soccer as dull as ditch-water to frustrate their supporters. 

East Bengal had won their first match by the same margin, but didnt impress that day as well. 

On Friday, fans vented their ire on referee Debasish Mishra, whose inept supervision added to the tension as the teams were locked goalless till the 70th minute. 

Ten minutes earlier, a free-for-all in the middle of the park culminated in East Bengal custodian Abhra Mondal and Obribai Benjamin of Eastern Railway being shown the red card. 

With the minutes ticking by and the home fans getting desperate, East Bengal launched fresh inroads. One such move brought them luck as the referee pointed to the dreaded spot after substitute Dipendu Biswas was pushed inside the box. 

The cross from the right flank had brushed Edmilsons hand and Dipendu tried to break free from the melee. The referee initially wanted play to go on before changing his mind. 

The infuriated Eastern Railway players protests fell on deaf ears. Edmilson Marques opened the scoreline with a neat placement. The Brazilian had scored in the opener also. 

Alvito DCunha out with a double booking was missed in the midfield as the supply line was snapped. 

Chandan Das was terribly out of place, while Dipankar Roy and Jayanta Sen looked incapable of taking the initiative. 

With no snatching or blocking in the midfield, Eastern Railway players enjoyed a free run inside the rival territory. 

The railway pressure almost got to the East Bengal defence. 

The porousness showed as Obribai Benjamin and Co. made use of the open spaces. With a little more luck, Eastern Railway could have scored. 

Phool Chand Hembram and Rajib Ekka missed sitters. 

The one to stand out amid the insipid show was Edmilson. 

The Brazilian showed the urgency to pressurise the railway defence with some intelligent moves down the middle. 

It was only after the introduction of Dipendu that he got the desired support up front. 

Edmilsons long-rangers often took Eastern Railway by surprise. His scorching free-kick from 20 yards in the first session was well saved by goalkeeper Tapan Karmakar. 

The second goal was the result of the Edmilson-Dipendu combination. The Brazilians cross was nodded in by Dipendu. The striker, who switched over to the red-and-golds from Mohun Bagan this season, could not reach the ball in a similar situation a few minutes earlier.

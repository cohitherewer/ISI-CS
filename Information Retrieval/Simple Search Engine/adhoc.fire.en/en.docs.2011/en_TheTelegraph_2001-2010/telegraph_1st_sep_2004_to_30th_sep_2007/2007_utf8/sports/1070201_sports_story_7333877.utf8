The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Prasun to take charge today

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) will get its new boss officially on Thursday. 

Police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee will formally assume office after CABs special general meetting (SGM), which will be held at 6 pm. 

Following a volte-face from sports minister Subhas Chakraborty, who chose to pull out of the race last week, Mukherjee remained the unopposed candidate for the post. As a result, the SGM is expected to last for only a few minutes before formally announcing Mukherjee as the new CAB chief. 

Mukherjee will thus replace Jagmohan Dalmiya, who was forced to resign after being charged with misappropriation of funds by the Board of Control for Cricket in India.

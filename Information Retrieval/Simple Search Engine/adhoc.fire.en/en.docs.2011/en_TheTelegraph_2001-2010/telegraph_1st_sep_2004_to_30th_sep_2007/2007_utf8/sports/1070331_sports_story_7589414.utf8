Georgetown: Paul Collingwood lifted England to a reasonable 266 for seven with a belligerent 90 on Friday after Boyd Rankin struck two early blows for Ireland in the World Cup Super Eight match. 

 Ireland were 

 151/6 after 40 overs. Trent Johnston (8) and Andrew White 

 (4) were at the crease. Niall Brien made 63 while 

 opener William Porterfield scored 31. Monty Panesar claimed 

 two wickets while James Anderson and Andrew Flintoff took 

 one each. Eoin Morgan was run out. 

Collingwood went in with England at 89 for three in the 21st over and salvaged the innings with his second half-century of the tournament. After reaching his 15th ODI 50 in 65 balls, he lifted the tempo with three sixes until he was run out three balls from the end of the innings. 

Collingwoods 82-ball innings also included eight boundaries and involved valuable stands of 81 for the fifth wicket with Andrew Flintoff (43) and 51 for the sixth with Paul Nixon (19). 

Rankin got the Irishmen away to an ideal start, bowling former teammate Ed Joyce for one to start the second over and having England captain Michael Vaughan caught behind for six to make it 23 for two. 

Ireland were not expected to win a match on debut at the World Cup. After advancing to the second round with an upset of Pakistan and a tie with Zimbabwe, suddenly another shocker loomed. 

Kevin Pietersen (48) and Ian Bell (31) steadied the innings, putting on 66 in 15 overs until the Brien brothers combined to halt the stand. 

Kevin Brien ended Bells 71-ball knock when the England No. 3 brushed an edge off the back of his glove to wicketkeeper Niall Brien. 

Pietersens run-a-ball 48 contained only five boundaries. He fell with the total at 113, chipping Kyle McCallan to William Porterfield at short mid-wicket.

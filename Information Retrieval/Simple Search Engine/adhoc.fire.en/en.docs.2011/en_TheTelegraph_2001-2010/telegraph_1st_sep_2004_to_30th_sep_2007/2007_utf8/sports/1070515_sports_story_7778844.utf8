 IOA is behind schedule: CGF

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) was in for major embarrassment on Monday. 

The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) officials, who are currently in the capital to review progress made by the 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games Organising Committee (CGOC), rapped the IOA for being behind schedule. 

CGF treasurer Austin Sealy said in the co-ordination commission meeting: Being the host Olympic Committee, all the responsibilities lie with you You wouldnt want to lose sight. 

Sealy said that though Suresh Kalmadi has been doing his best, there is a lot of work to be done. 

 There are three years to go and we will review the progress at the full meeting of the CGF six months later in Colombo. We are not a police force but are here only to help you out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Melbourne: The next Australian Open will be played on a new acrylic court surface. Organisers of the 2008 edition have started replacing the Rebound Ace at Melbourne Park in favour of new technology. 

 The new cushioned acrylic surface will have a different cushioning system to the Rebound Ace product, including a lower rubber content, and will be firmer under foot, tournament director Craig Tiley said Wednesday.

 There is less rubber in the new surface, that organisers expect will retain less heat and makes it better suited to Australian conditions. The Australian Open, formerly played on grass, has been using a Rebound Ace surface since it moved to Melbourne Park in 1988.

 Salvo (US): Olympic 100m champion Justin Gatlins arbitration hearing on doping charges will be held in Atlanta, Georgia, on July 30-31, his attorney said on Tuesday. The American joint world record-holder tested positive for testosterone or its precursors at the Kansas Relays in April 2006, but has denied knowingly taking the banned substances.

 The US Anti-Doping Agency capped Gatlins maximum possible penalty at eight years last August after he agreed to the accuracy of the laboratory results . Gatlin would not be eligible to run until July 2014 unless he receives a shorter ban. 

 La Paz: Bolivian President Evo Morales, who is leading the opposition to a Fifa ban on high-altitude soccer games, said on Tuesday that his country would host a protest meeting uniting delegates from 20 Latin American cities on June 6.

 The decision by Fifa to set a limit of 2,500m (8,200 feet) above sea level is a blow for Andean countries, including Bolivia, which has the benefit of playing World Cup qualifiers at 3,600m in La Paz.

 Barcelona: Barcelona midfielder Ronaldinho will miss the penultimate league game against Espanyol after the Spanish football federation handed the Brazilian a one-match suspension on Wednesday.

 The Catalan club had appealed the red card Ronaldinho received for kicking out at Getafe captain David Belenguer after being on the receiving end of three hard tackles in the 10th minute of Barcelonas 1-0 league win Saturday. 

 Munich: Italy striker Luca Toni is set to join Bayern Munich from Fiorentina. We have agreed with the player, Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said on Wednesday. He will sign a contract with us through June 30, 2011.

 The 30-year-old striker will cost Bayern 11 million euros ($14.8 million), Rummenigge said. Toni will travel to Munich on June 8 for a medical examination and will be then officially presented.

 Madrid: Spain striker Fernando Torres has injured ligaments in his left ankle and will miss European championships qualifying matches against Latvia and Liechtenstein. Luis Garcia will probably replace the striker, a Spanish sports daily said on its website. 

 Torres sprained his ankle when Sergio Ramos tackled him during training with the Spanish national team on Tuesday.

Bangalore: Sania Mirza moved into the pre-quarter finals of the Sony Ericsson WTA Bangalore Open, knocking off the experienced Slovak Martina Sucha 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 in her first round match on Wednesday. 

On a day of major upsets, three seeded players bite dust while three others ensured last eight berths. 

Qualifier Yurika Sema of Japan advanced to the quarter finals of the WTA Bangalore Open, defeating Yulia Beygelzimer of Ukraine 1-6, 6-4, 6-1. Coming into the tournament through a qualifying round, Sema had shocked fifth-seeded Yuliana Fedak, also of Ukraine, in the first round on Tuesday. 

The singles campaign is now over for third seed Vasilisa Bardina of Russia, sixth seed Yung-Jan Chan of Chinese Taipei and eighth seed Alberta Brianti of Italy. 

Tzipora Obziler, who has served for two years in the Israeli army, thrashed Bardina 6-1, 6-2 in mere 52 minutes to storm into the quarter-finals. 

However, in a match that lasted little more than two hours, Sania was kept on her toes by the 26-year-old Sucha, who had advanced to her first quarter finals of the year at Pattaya last week. 

Its difficult playing here in Bangalore at altitudes of 1,000, 1,200, said the second-seeded Sania after failing to muster enough confidence to hold her serve in the second set. Sania dropped four games in the second set as Sucha forced the match into the decider. 

The Indian, ranked 46th on WTA rankings list, will meet Tatiana Pouchek of Belarus for a place in the quarter finals. 

Hungarys Melinda Czink overcame sixth seed Yung-Jan Chan in three sets 1-6, 7-5, 6-2. Czink, who had a third top-100 season last year, plays Su-Wei Hsieh of Chinese Taipei. 

Reigning champion and top seed Mara Santangelo of Italy outplayed Shengnan Sun of China 6-2, 7-6 to set up a clash with Akgul Amanmuradova of Uzbekistan for a place in the quarters. (PTI)

 Pereira hurt in practice

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The Indian football team, currently on a preparatory tour of Portugal, had a minor hiccup on Monday when striker Anthony Pereira suffered an injury during the training session. 

According to team manager Pradeep Chowdhury, Pereira suffered injury when he collided with Syed Rahim Nabi during Indias practice session in the outskirts of Lisbon. 

Everything is fine at the moment, Chowdhury assured over the phone from Portugal . We took the youngster to a nearby hospital where an X-ray was done on his knee. Though nothing was found, we would not like to take any chance. We might do an MRI on him tomorrow, the team manager informed. 

According to Chowdhury, the tour organisers, Football and Friends, have made excellent arrangements for the Indian team. The team has been lodged in a very good hotel and has been provided with top class practice facilities. 

The turf of the practice ground near our hotel is absolute lush green and smooth, the manager said. The surroundings are picturesque and the boys are really enjoying their stay out here. 

India are set to play three friendly matches during their first-ever 18-day Europe tour in six years. Their first match is against a third division club side Atletico Clube Marinhense on June 22, but there could be some changes in the schedule. 

We might play our first match on June 19, Chowdhury said though he could not name the opposition. The entire schedule is being worked out by Bob (Houghton) with the organisers.

 Jelena pays the price for tough schedule

WILLIAM JOHNSON

Jelena Jankovic is rightly proud of the progress she has made this year to break into the worlds top 10, make further improvement into the top five and enter Wimbledon with only Justine Henin and Maria Sharapova ranked above her. 

That achievement has come as reward for her almost incessant activity in the first half of the season, but now the 22-year-old Serbian might well be regretting putting herself through such a demanding schedule after crashing out of The Championships on Tuesday to an opponent she had hammered 6-1, 6-1 at the equivalent fourth-round stage of the French Open last month. 

Marion Bartoli, a portly French woman ranked 19 in the world, out-stayed the super-fit Jankovic in what became a mental and physical battle which lasted 2 hours 25 minutes but spanned 4 hours 38 minutes after five rain breaks interrupted the match. 

When they came out for their final session midway through a tense final set, Jankovic was leading 3-2, but the third seed did not win another game. She had nothing left in the tank at that stage and lost 6-3, 5-7, 3-6. 

Jankovic became the fastest woman to record a half-century of victories in a year since Chris Evert in 1974 when she won a quarter-final match in Rosmalen four days before the start of The Championships. 

That was Jankovics 16th tournament this year but surely there was no need to play in it, especially as she had excellent grasscourt preparation after winning the Edgbaston tournament by overcoming Sharapova in a long, thrilling final.

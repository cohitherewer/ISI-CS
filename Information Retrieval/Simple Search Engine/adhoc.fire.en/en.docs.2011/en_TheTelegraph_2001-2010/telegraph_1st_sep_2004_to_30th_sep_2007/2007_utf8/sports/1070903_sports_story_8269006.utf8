 Sourav: Only guy catching was Dhoni

A CORRESPONDENT

Leeds: The only guy catching today (Saturday) was him, MoM Sourav Ganguly said of Mahendra Singh Dhoni after the fifth ODI at Headingley on Sunday. 

That was a fitting praise for the Team India wicketkeeper, who equalled the world record of six dismissals (five catches and one stumping) in an ODI. 

On a day when Indias fielding wasnt faultless not for the first time in the series Dhoni did the rescue act behind the stumps. 

Sourav was quick to praise the India stumper, but the former India captain played no less a role. His allround performance in his 300th ODI helped India register a 38-run win by Duckworth/Lewis method. 

Sourav (59) stitched together a 116-run stand with Sachin Tendulkar (71) for the first wicket. Sourav then took the wickets of Matt Prior and Ian Bell to put the brakes on Englands innings. 

In fact Sourav was the most economical, giving away 26 runs in seven overs. 

Yes, I did quite a bit of bowling. The wet conditions really helped A lot was there in the wicket. I was lucky to put the ball in the right position, Sourav said while receiving the MoM award. 

About his knock, which was peppered with seven boundaries and two sixes, Sourav said: I got a few good starts, but did not really convert them though I have been consistent, he said. 

He is just one wicket shy of another landmark 100 wickets and 10,000 runs which only Sanath Jayasuriya and Sachin Tendulkar have achieved in ODIs. 

Yes I know Im approaching that feat Only two persons have this record So, obviously, this is not a tough one to guess, Sourav said when asked whether he knew about that milestone. 

I just have to carry on and play according to the situation. 

Sourav said he was enjoying not leading the side. 

Im enjoying this phase Theres not much of responsibility Ive lots of free time which is important, Sourav signed off.

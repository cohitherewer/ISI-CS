The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ill get a chance one day, says Ranadeb

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Ranadeb Bose believes he will get a chance to wear the Indian cap one-day, leaving behind the disappointment of returning from England without playing a Test. 

I have no regrets. I know that getting into the Indian XV is difficult but making the final XI is even more difficult. But I firmly believe that Ill get a chance one day, the medium-pacer said on Thursday. 

He revealed that he wanted to meet England bowling coach Allan Donald, but the former South African spearheads busy schedule came in the way. 

Back home, Ranadeb is now preparing for a grinding of domestic challenges. Probably Bengal will go to Sri Lanka for a few practice matches.

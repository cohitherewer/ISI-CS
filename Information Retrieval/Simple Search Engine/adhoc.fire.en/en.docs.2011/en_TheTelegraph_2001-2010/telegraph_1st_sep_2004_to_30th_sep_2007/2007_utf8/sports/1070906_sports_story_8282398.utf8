 Nadal bites the dust

 Rafael Nadal after his loss on Tuesday 

Rafael Nadal and David Ferrer slid all over the brilliant blue hardcourt on Tuesday as if it were red clay, forgetting for a moment that this was not their favourite surface. The two friends from Spain played on as night turned to morning, slugging groundstrokes and grunting furiously before thousands of hearty, transfixed fans. 

For fans watching in different time zones of California or Hawaii or even those breakfasting with the television on in Spain this tennis interplay was a treat. 

Nadal, the No. 2 player in the world, will not remember it as such. Ferrer, 25 and seeded 15th in this tournament, came up with the biggest victory of his career, when he knocked off Nadal, the three-time French Open champion 6-7 (3), 6-4, 7-6 (4), 6-2 in the Round of 16. 

After 3 hours 28 minutes, Nadal hobbled out of the Open under the cover of a half-moon. Tomorrow, I dont want to run more, Ferrer said in his on-court interview. Now I am very tired. To beat Rafa, I have to run a lot. Im sorry for that, for my friend, for my partner, Rafa. Thanks a lot for the people to support me. 

Nadal left the court quickly after the match, dispirited that his aching knee and sore hand had failed him. Ferrer, meanwhile, advanced to the quarter finals to play Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina. 

Sure disappointed, but thats tennis, thats the sport, Nadal said in the post-match news conference. I was having a very good season. Im disappointed, I couldnt play 100 percent in the tournament because of the knees, and maybe that affected a little bit my physical performance. 

But Nadal also said he did not want to use his physical problems as an excuse and was quick to compliment his countryman. Hes a very good player, hes having an unbelievable season, Nadal said. Earlier this summer, in Cincinnati, Ferrer also defeated Andy Roddick. 

Nadal defeated Roger Federer at the French Open for his third consecutive title in Paris. But after losing to Federer in the Wimbledon final, Nadal did not have the chance to renew his rivalry with the worlds No. 1 player and prove he could win on this surface. At just 21, he is breaking down on the hardcourts.

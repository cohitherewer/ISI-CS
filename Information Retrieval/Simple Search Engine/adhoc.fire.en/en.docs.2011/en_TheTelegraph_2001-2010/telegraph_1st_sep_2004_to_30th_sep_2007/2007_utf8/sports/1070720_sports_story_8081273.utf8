 Racism, drugs row mar Open

Claire Middleton amp; Lewine Mair 

Before a ball has been hit in anger here, the R amp;A have been embroiled in two unlikely rows, one over allegations of racism and the other over performance-enhancing drugs. How the governing body must long for the good old days of 1999, when only the course was being lambasted. 

The racism issue was the first to rear its head. It concerned a speech made at the Association of Golf Writerss annual bash by Graham Brown, a former captain of Hoylake and a member of the R amp;As rules committee. In it, he referred to the Japanese as Nips, and when Peter Dawson, the chief executive of the R amp;A, who was at the dinner, appeared for a press conference he was asked whether Brown would be made to resign. 

Dawson was also pumped on remarks made by Gary Player, a winner of nine majors, who has claimed that 10 professionals are on drugs. 

Dawson said he had spoken to Brown, who had apologised, but insisted that Brown had been acting in a private capacity and was not representing the R amp;A.

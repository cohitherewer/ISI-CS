 A dream come true: Djokovic 

Montreal: Novak Djokovic defeated world No. 1 Roger Federer 7-6 (7-2), 2-6, 7-6 (7-2) in the final of the Montreal Masters on Sunday (as reported in Mondays late City edition). 

The 20-year-old Serb thwarted a fightback from Federer, who was aiming to lift the 50th trophy of his career. 

But Djokovic, who had beaten world No. 2 Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals, calmly ripped through a final set tie-breaker to win a second masters shield this season, after Miami Masters five months ago. 

I cant describe my feelings, Djokovic said after the win. Its like a dream come true. To win those tie-breakers against Federer was just incredible. 

Despite failing to close out a victory and keep his 16-match win streak in Canada alive, the 26-year-old Federer was far from concerned, calling the loss insignificant.

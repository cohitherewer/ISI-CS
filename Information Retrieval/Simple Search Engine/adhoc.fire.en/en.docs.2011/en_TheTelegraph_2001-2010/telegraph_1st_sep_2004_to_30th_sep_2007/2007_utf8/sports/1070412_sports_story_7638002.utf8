The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Series vs Aussies doubtful

Melbourne: The proposed India-Australia one-day International series to be played in Ireland in June appears doubtful following lukewarm response from the BCCI. 

[According to The Telegraphs sources, the three-match series in Ireland is likely to feature India and South Africa. Apparently, the Australians are out of the equation where Ireland is concerned, adds Our Special Correspondent in Calcutta.] 

Cricket Australia (CA) spokesman Peter Young said only a little more than two months remained for the series but negotiations between the two boards seem to have stalled as CA was still awaiting written confirmation from the BCCI. 

We have been discussing with the BCCI about New York, about Toronto and most recently the discussion has been Ireland, Young said. 

We are waiting for them to give a written reply as to where we stand. We certainly have not had confirmation from them, he was quoted as saying in a newspaper. 

Young, however, denied there was any cooling in the relations of the two boards. 

I dont think the way we liaise with the BCCI has changed in the time I have been here, he said.

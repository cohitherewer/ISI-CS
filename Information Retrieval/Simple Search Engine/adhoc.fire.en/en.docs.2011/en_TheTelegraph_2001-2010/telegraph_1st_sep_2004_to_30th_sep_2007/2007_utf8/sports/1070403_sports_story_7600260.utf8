 I am an eternal optimist, says Brian Lara

Georgetown: Desperation has given way to crisis for Brian Lara and his West Indies World Cup squad. 

A 113-run loss to Sri Lanka on Sunday followed heavy defeats to defending champions Australia and New Zealand, and left the West Indies needing to win their last three matches and rely on other results. 

We are in a crisis situation, pertaining to cricket, Lara said. Were in a hole, and weve got to take ourselves out of that hole. 

That performance was not up to scratch. We know that. 

After a promising start, having the Sri Lankans at 35 for 2 in the ninth over, the West Indies bowling and fielding started deteriorating in the face of Sanath Jayasuriyas onslaught. 

Jayasuriya made a slow start before belting 27 runs in the 17th and 18th overs. He ended with 115 from 101 balls, helping Sri Lanka to 303 for five. The West Indies batting line-up crumbled, again, to be all out for 190 in 44.3 overs. 

Lara also blamed the gruelling schedule for the teams flop shows in the Super Eight stage and insisted playing four matches in 10 days had been energy-sapping for the side. 

True, we didnt field well. But it was very tough today. This was our fourth match in 10 days and you could see that some of the guys were really flat in the field. 

Daren Powell has lost 10kg in the last few days and its all very unfortunate, he said. 

An eight-day rest before matches against top-ranked South Africa, Bangladesh and England should give the West Indies time to regroup, he said. 

I am an eternal optimist. I still see it. To win a World Cup takes a lot of skill and a lot of luck, the 37-year-old left-hander said. Weve still got an outside chance, and Im still focusing on that. 

The West Indies chase at Guyanas National Stadium faded on Sunday when Lara was cleverly stumped by Kumar Sangakkara, standing up to seamer Chaminda Vaas, for two in the 11th over. 

Lara said the team and its supporters had to concentrate on its slim chance of reaching the last four. 

We have time to improve. Weve got to stay upbeat, he said. 

I know everyone is disappointed around the Caribbean. But weve still got a job to do. There is a little bit of light. 

To make it back to the semi-finals, the West Indies need England, Bangladesh, South Africa and Ireland losing matches. 

Lara said he would like the West Indies last Super 8 match against England to have a semi-final spot resting on it. There are permutations, he said. But, It still boils down to us beating South Africa, Bangladesh and England to give ourselves any chance. Nothing will help if we dont do that. 

Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene was elated that his side had bounced back from the defeat against South Africa in the previous match. 

After the last game, we realised we had made too many mistakes. Today we wanted to make sure that we bat out the difficult morning session. The ball wasnt initially coming on to the bat but in the end it was a great performance, he said. 

Wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara, who shone with his glove work behind the stump, felt the side had shown its character during the match.

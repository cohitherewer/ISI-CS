The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bagan hope to turn tide

A STAFF REPORTER

 Nfl tie vs Air india 

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan began the 2007 with a bang when they bagged the Federation Cup, pipping a spirited Sporting Clube de Goa in a riveting final at Salt Lake Stadium. But the progress has just stopped thereafter. In fact, its been a disastrous performance for them so far in the 11th ONGC National Football League. From the initial three rounds two losses and one draw so far, they have conceded six goals with only one point in the kitty. 

But for the Jose Ramirez Barreto boys theres a silver line, ahead of their Round IV tie against Air India at the Barasat stadium on Saturday. 

Their first home match what they can expect a boisterous crowd support at least to boost their sagging morale in the League. If the senior pros, Barreto and Bhaichung Bhutia, would be hoping to make use of this home advantage, custodian Sangram Mukherjee vulnerability in conceding easy goals may give them jitters. 

Nevertheless, during their two-hour practice session at their home ground on Friday morning Mohun Bagan appeared unperturbed. 

On the other hand, going by current form, Air India appear heavyweight against the Calcutta giants. In contrast to Mohun Bagan, the Mumbai outfit has two wins and a draw from three outings and are on a high at the moment. Having scored one each in their 3-1 win over HAL, Bashiree Mohammed Abbas, Noel Fernandes and T. Narendra Meetei will look to continue their momentum against a morally-down Bagan. 

Md. Sp. protest 

Meanwhile, Mohammedan Sporting have written to the AIFF voicing their protest over Ashim Biswas goal in their NFL match against East Bengal on Thursday. 

Mohammedan Sporting on Friday signed veteran medio Basudeb Mondal who will be eligible for the black-and-whites next match.

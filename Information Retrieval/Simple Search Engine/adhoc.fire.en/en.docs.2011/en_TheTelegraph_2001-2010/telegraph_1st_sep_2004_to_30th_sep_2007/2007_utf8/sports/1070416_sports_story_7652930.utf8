 Ballack sets up date with United

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AND AGENCIES

 Michael Ballack scored in the 19th minute of extra 

 time kept Chelseas ambitions of winning an unprecedented 

 quadruple of titles this season alive with victory over 

 Blackburn in extra-time. 

Ballacks left-foot strike in the 109th minute booked Chelsea an FA Cup final date with rivals Manchester United on May 19. 

Chelsea were 1-0 up after 16 minutes through Frank Lampards 21st goal of the season. 

But they failed to make the most of their dominance in front of goal and were pegged back by Blackburn midway through the second half. 

Jason Roberts provided Mark Hughes with the lifeline they needed when he scored his first goal for the club in the 64th minute. 

Blackburn were much improved during the second half and were denied a late victory in normal time when Petr Cech came to Chelseas rescue with a ine save from the head of his own captain, John Terry. 

Chelsea took advantage of this near-miss when Ballack grabbed the vital winner in the second half of extra-time after neat work by Shaun Wright-Phillips down the left flank. 

They could have put the game to bed with three minutes to go but Michael Essiens piledriver struck the crossbar and rebounded to safety. 

 Blackburn, beaten three times previously by the Londoners 

 this season, levelled when Jason Roberts cleverly turned 

 in a Morten Gamst Pedersen free-kick in the 63rd minute.

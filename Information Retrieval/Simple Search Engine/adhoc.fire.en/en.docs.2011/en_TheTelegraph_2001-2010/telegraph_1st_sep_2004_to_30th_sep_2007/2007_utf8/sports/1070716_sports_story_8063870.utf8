 Austria beat US to semis

Toronto: Austria beat the US in extra-time on Saturday to go into the semi-finals of the under-20 World Cup where they will meet the Czech Republic, who beat Spain on penalties. 

Austria came from behind for a surprise victory after the US took the lead in the 15th minute when Josmer Altidore headed in Freddy Adus cross. 

Two minutes before the break, Austria drew level when Rubin Okotie slotted home the loose ball. 

The game turned Austrias way two minutes before the end of the first period of extra-time when American defender Anthony Wallace was dismissed with a second yellow card and from the resulting free kick, substitute Erwin Hoffer knocked in the winner. 

In the other match, after a goalless 90 minutes in Edmonton, the Czech Republic went ahead through a powerful Lubos Kalouda drive late in the first period of extra-time. 

Juan Manuel Mata equalised for Spain with five minutes remaining. 

The Czechs won 4-3 in the shoot-out, Marc Valiente and Gerard Pique failing to score their penalties for Spain.

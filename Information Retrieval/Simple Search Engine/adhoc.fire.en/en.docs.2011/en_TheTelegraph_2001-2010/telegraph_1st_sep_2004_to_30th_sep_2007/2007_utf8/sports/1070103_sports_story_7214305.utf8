The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bopanna may get the nod

 - Vacant Davis Cup doubles slot up for grabs 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chennai: Indias Davis Cup ambitions lie well and truly restricted to the confines of the Asia-Oceania zonal territory. Hopes of a re-entry to the elite World Group seem a distant dream. In fact, the challenge these days is to make sure we dont slip to the second rung (group II) of the zonal competition. 

India will launch another year with a tie in Uzbekistan from February 9-11. The Uzbeks have chosen an indoor claycourt venue in a place called Namangon. Thats the Indians least preferred surface and Leander Paes amp; Co. will have to put on their best show in order to take the first step towards retaining their place in group I. 

The squad hasnt been announced yet, AITA secretary Anil Khanna saying that the selection committee will meet sometimes towards the end of this month. Now that Mahesh Bhupathi has finally retired from India duty (he may reconsider his decision if India qualify for a World Group tie, according to Khanna), it should be a fairly straightforward choice (Paes, Rohan Bopanna, Prakash Amritraj and Karan Rastogi), unless Harsh Mankad comes into the picture afresh. 

It wont be a tough job for the selectors at all, now that Mahesh Bhupathi has finally retired from India duty (he may reconsider his decision if India qualify for a World Group tie, according to Khanna). The players choose themselves: captain Paes, Rohan Bopanna, Prakash Amritraj and Karan Rastogi, who won his maiden Futures title last weekend in Delhi. 

One interesting decision will still have to be made. And that is, who replaces Bhupathi as Paes partner. Rastogi is not in the picture, so it will be a toss-up between Bopanna and Amritraj. As of now, The Telegraph understands Bopanna is ahead in the race to win the vacant doubles slot. 

Both like playing doubles, as was seen during their dream run to Chennai Open final last year, when they beat the second and third seeds before bowing to Petr Pala and Michal Mertinak. Since then, though, Bopanna has made the steadier progress, while Amritraj has kind of stagnated after a long lay-off.. Bopanna came very close to playing the Asian Games doubles event after Paes felt Bhupathi was not in the best of shape and form. He missed that chance, but subsequently got the chance to pair up with Sania Mirza in the Asian Hopman Cup. 

The Indians qualified and the duo did well to upset the higher-ranked Czech team in the tournament proper now in progress Down Under. 

What Paes has to consider before making his choice finally is the Beijing factor. He is very determined to feature in the 2008 Olympics. So he has to decide who will be the better option.

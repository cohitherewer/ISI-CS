 Weve got back 

 some rhythm

 - Tougher challenges lie ahead, cautions Dravid; Bashar 

 quits as ODI captain

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Dhaka: Team India captain Rahul Dravid kept his feet firmly on the ground despite winning the final Test against Bangladesh within three days here on Sunday. 

He took positives from the win, but reminded his team of tougher challenges ahead. 

I dont get excited by most situations. My belief is to keep things in perspective, be it victory or defeat. We will take some heart from this win, some positives. But we mustnt forget that tougher challenges lie ahead of us, Dravid said after India won the second Test and the series by an innings and 239 runs. 

He insisted that the series victory against Bangladesh is no consolation for the World Cup debacle. 

The World Cup is history. You cant look at something to salvage something else. Theres nothing we can do about that loss (to Bangladesh) in the World Cup. 

We were here to play some good cricket, get some rhythm, form and confidence back. I thought we did that, Dravid said. 

He did acknowledge that this (series) was always a lose-lose situation. 

Had we not done well, people would have said, Whats happening? Had we won, its not a big deal Theres a bigger challenge awaiting us in England. The conditions, opponents will be different. 

Wasims comeback has been good for us. He needs to be consistent now. Dinesh, on the other hand, hasnt put a foot wrong in the last three games. 

He showed character, attitude, hunger and desire. Hes already started thinking about the challenges in England, the Indian captain said. 

Meanwhile, Habibul Bashar, under pressure after the way Bangladesh capitulated, has decided to step down as captain of the ODI side. 

I have already informed the selectors and the BCB of my decision. Im available for selection in ODIs, but I dont want to claim the berth as a captain, Bashar said. 

According to him, losing the match in such a manner was disappointing.

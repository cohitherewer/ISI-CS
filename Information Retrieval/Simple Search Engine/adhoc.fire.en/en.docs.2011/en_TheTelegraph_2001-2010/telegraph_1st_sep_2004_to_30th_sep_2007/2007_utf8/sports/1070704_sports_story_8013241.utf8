 RCTC syces stall trackwork 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: RCTCs monsoon season is barely 10 days away and syces have started their tricks. Horses have not been taken out for the morning trackwork since Monday and the indication is that stalemate may continue for at least another day. Syces are demanding their dearness allowance, due since December 2006, be cleared. 

 The strike is illegal as they (syces union), have not given an adequate time for it, said an RCTC official. The matter is expected to be settled on Wednesday, hoped a trainer.

Ive got to give a report to the Board, so I cant go into details... However, Suresh has been doing very well, Gloster told The Telegraph. 

Raina has been batting at nets only and will resume playing after Glosters okay. Hes among the probables for the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 meet, some seven weeks from now.

 Hawkeye is nonsense: Federer

- World no.1 wants more tournsments in Asia, not Europe

Melbourne: Roger Federer says the Hawkeye electronic line-calling technology is nonsense because it puts the onus on players rather than umpires to get it right. 

The review system was partially adopted worldwide last season after it was first introduced at the ATP Masters in Miami last March. 

The system allows fans to see on a giant video screen what the off-court umpire uses for review and encourages players to challenge calls. 

But the Swiss world No.1 is not a fan and says all it does is embarrass the players with the replay outcomes. 

Im not a big fan of it. I think its nonsense anyway in the first place, said Federer after advancing to the third round of the Australian Open here on Wednesday. 

Now they (match officials) can hide even more behind these calls, thats for sure. But thats really our problem. 

It makes it really hard for us. Of course, we would like to be able to rely a little bit on umpires as well. 

They tend to now just let us do the work, the tough stuff. They let us get embarrassed basically with the two challenges there to be used. 

Federer also does not think very highly of the ATP experiment with a round-robin format at 13 tournaments on different surfaces in different countries throughout the 2007 season. 

The round-robin format is where players are placed into groups and the top player in each group progresses to the knockout phase of the tournament to enable them play more matches. 

From my end, Im not a round-robin guy. Im not playing one of these events, he said. 

Im happy about that this year. I hope theyre not going to be around in 2008. 

But look, Im not the only guy playing on tour. There are other players as well who have to agree with those things. 

I think its going to be interesting to see where the game goes from here really. 

The world No.1 also wants Asia rather than Europe to host more top tennis events, saying it is an important region for the sport to prosper. 

There are reports that ATP is considering moving the Hamburg Masters for a joint mens and womens event in Madrid in a May timeslot. 

Both tournaments are important build-up events for the French Open. 

But Federer, with nine Grand Slam titles to his credit, is opposed to the move and wants Asia to be the beneficiary of any venue change. 

Its all speculation at the moment, Federer said. 

Im actually for tournaments to move more to Asia than Europe or in the US. 

I think Asia is a very important market. Ive always loved playing over there. I dont really care where it goes in Asia, but I think its important to have big events there. 

We have the Australian Open, but thats all the way down here. We need something in Asia, as well. Its good we have the Masters Cup. 

Federer said he wasnt opposed to Madrid getting an indoor/outdoor event as long as it wasnt at the expense of Asia. 

When this goes maybe to somewhere else, its good you have maybe a Masters series over there. Thats my main concern, he said. If Madrid gets an indoor/outdoor event, I dont really care seriously. 

As long as we have good events, thats what we care about, that the fans attend and they enjoy it. Thats whats important, Federer said.

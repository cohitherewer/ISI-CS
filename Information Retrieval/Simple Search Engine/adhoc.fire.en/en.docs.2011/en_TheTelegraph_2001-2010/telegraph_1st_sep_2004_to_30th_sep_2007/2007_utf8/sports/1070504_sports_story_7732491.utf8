 Ponting: We have widened gap

Sydney: Australia captain Ricky Ponting believes his team will continue to dominate world cricket for years to come unless their opponents improve. 

Rival countries had been hoping Australia would lose their grip on world cricket with the retirements of Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath, Justin Langer and Damien Martyn. 

But those hopes look to have been dashed after an Australian team featuring the next generation of players hardly broke sweat on the way to winning the World Cup for the third time in a row. 

The victory capped a remarkable season in which Australia also won the Champions Trophy and completed a 5-0 series cleansweep in the Ashes. 

The skills that were on display at the World Cup were probably never seen before in international cricket and that is something we should be very proud of, Ponting told reporters after the team arrived home on Thursday. 

Ponting said the recent exodus of senior players would not necessarily allow other countries to close the gap. 

I think if anything we have increased that margin between the teams through this tournament, Ponting said. 

I think we have just gone ahead and even widened that gap so it is up to the opposition countries to address that fact and look at what we are doing, he said. And look at how they are playing their cricket and make sure next time they played against us, they can compete better against us. 

Ponting and his teammates touched down at the Sydney airport just before dawn. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Glamour quotient to the fore

MADHUMITA GANGULY

Calcutta: If womens tennis is here, can glamour and fashion be far behind? 

The sport has become more competitive in recent years. And more glamorous as well. Maria Sharapovas 600 Swarovski crystal-studded red dress, Serena Williamss black leather jacket, Sania Mirzas catchy slogan written T-shirts, Bethanie Matteks leopard-printed outfits the clothes are as much a topic of conversation as their tennis. 

With several members of this tribe gracing the city with their presence during the ongoing Sunfeast Open, the glamour quotient is evoking no less an interest than expertise on court. 

Daniela Hantuchova, the second seed here, has twice (2002 and 2004) topped the ACE tennis magazines Hot List of the worlds sexiest tennis players and is currently at No. 3. The 24-year-old Slovaks 44-inch legs ensure that she is one of the crowd favourites wherever she plays. 

Sharapovas namesake and her best friend on Tour, Maria Kirilenko, is not to be left far behind, The 19-year-old Russian was selected in 2006 to be the face of Adidas by the Stella McCartney tennis range. She is at No. 4 on the Hot List. 

Yes, style and fashion have come a long way from the days when tennis was played in staid whites. Human beings are naturally attracted to colours, says fashion designer Agnimitra Paul during a chat with The Telegraph. 

Not only is there a lot of colour now, there have been a good many other changes too. For instance, the cuts in skirts have changed, a lot of accessories have come in like danglers, nose pins and hand bands. Not to speak of stylish shoes. 

Take Sania, for instance, adds Agnimitra, The young lady is very fasionable indeed. She is cool, dresses well and carries herself with a lot of grace. 

And yes, I would love to be her personal designer. I would give her clothes funky cuts, since she carries things with elan. And maybe add an Indian symbol to it, which would be her style statement. Which would make her a trendsetter, she adds. 

For a Sharapova or a Hantuchova, a westernised outfit with a little more daring is more appropriate, feels Agnimitra. 

Designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh says the world has moved on from a generation which only opted for what was comfortable, without bothering about what the spectators wished to see. 

Experimentations are interesting, says Kiran, but only in so far as they do not interfere with the play. 

Kiran adds that it was Andre Agassis style, class and spirit which had attracted her to tennis in the first place. 

Sania has a tongue in cheek style of a young witty girl which appeals to Kiran. She however emphasises that what is most important is that Sania is playing some great tennis. 

That the cuts have become more interesting, whether in skirts or shorts, is what appeals to Pali. Watch the matches is that much more interesting as they are visually appealing too, she signs off.

 Speeds defence

St Johns: ICC chief Malcolm Speed defended the governing body on Sunday against criticism over poor turnout, security measures and high ticket prices at the World Cup. 

We are at the halfway mark... very hopeful we can finish the World Cup in the manner we would expect with some great cricket being played where every match counts one way or the other, Speed said on Sunday. 

The event has been criticised by local fans and media for running for 47 days, featuring as many as 51 games and six Associate teams. 

Many have also complained about the absence of a Caribbean flavour due to the absence of crowds and conditions since lifted imposed for bringing musical instruments to the ground. 

There is a Caribbean flavour about this match, Speed said in response to the criticism, referring to champions Australia playing England in the Super Eight which he attended. (Reuters)

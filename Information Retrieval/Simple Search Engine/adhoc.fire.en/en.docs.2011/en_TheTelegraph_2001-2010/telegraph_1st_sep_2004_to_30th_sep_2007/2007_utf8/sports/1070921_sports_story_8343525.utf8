 Cristiano sets up United victory 

 - Arsenal, Barcelona have it easy

 Cristiano Ronaldo after scoring Uniteds winner against Sporting Lisbon 

London: Sevilla witnessed first hand the chasm between Uefa Cup football and the Champions League on Wednesday during a humbling 0-3 defeat at Arsenal. 

The Andalucians, winners of Europes second-tier club competition for the last two seasons and tipped to make an impact among the big boys, were pulled apart at the Emirates Stadium with Cesc Fabregas, Robin van Persie and Eduardo da Silva scoring for the Gunners. 

Czech side Slavia Prague, the other debutants in action, had a more enjoyable baptism. They joined Arsenal on three points in group H with a 2-1 home victory over Steaua Bucharest. 

Seven of the eight matches in groups E to H produced home wins with only Manchester United bucking the trend when Cristiano Ronaldo headed the winner for the English champions against Sporting Lisbon. 

Barcelona, who beat Arsenal in the 2006 final, turned on the style in their group E opener at the Nou Camp. Lionel Messi and Thierry Henry were on target in a 3-0 win for the Catalans against Olympique Lyon. 

It was a mixed night for Italian clubs. 

Inter Milan began with a 0-1 defeat in Istanbul against Fenerbahce in group G but AS Romas perfect start to the season continued when they saw off Dynamo Kiev 2-0 at the Olympic Stadium. 

Francesco Totti and Simone Perrotta were on target in the clubs 100th European victory. 

Wayne Rooney returned for Manchester United after breaking his foot on the opening day of the season but it was Cristiano Ronaldo who stole the limelight in front of his old fans. The Portuguese showman struck with a diving header to earn United a valuable away win. 

There were always going to be goals at the Nou Camp as Barcelona paraded an attacking trio of Messi, Henry and Ronaldinho, but it was a Lyon player who opened the scoring. Francois Clerc turned the ball into his own net after 21 minutes. 

Barcelona had to wait until the 82nd minute to seal the points against Lyon when Messi side-footed in after a flowing move. Henry put the icing on the cake in stoppage time with his 43rd goal in the competition. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Organisers have got it all wrong

MARTIN JOHNSON 

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH]

There are doubtless millions of people tuning into the World Cup cricket on television, and most of them will be wondering as the cameras pan around the ground where have all the spectators gone? Its been a bit like watching a Pro40 Division Two match between Leicestershire and Derbyshire, where the car park attendants are permanently braced for the imminent arrival of a couple of Reliant Robins and a bicycle. 

Why this should be is hard to say. In Englands case, not even the Barmy Army were barmy enough to organise their traditional en-masse invasion when they were appraised of the prices for eating, drinking and sleeping during the tournament. 

Based around the old pirates of the Caribbean principle, its a wonder that the local hoteliers were not all issued with cutlasses and told to wear a stuffed parrot on their shoulders. 

Small wonder, when they hand you the bill for a bottle of rum, its not accompanied by a chorus of yo ho ho. It may also have something to do with the fact that this World Cup is so bloated that if the Sky commentary team decided not to shave for its duration, theyd all come home with the kind of beards that would make WG Graces resemble teenage bum fluff. 

There was some nonsensical blather about needing 47 days to find a winner to give the players plenty of rest, but the real reason is to keep the tills jingling for as long as possible. 

Then there is the romantic notion that the West Indies consists of entirely idyllic, sun-kissed islands. Well, thats true up to a point, but more and more people may have discovered that Guyana is not only not an island, but would make Milton Keynes look attractive. 

If youre into surly waiters, Antigua is a must-visit destination. For traffic jams, try a week in Barbados, and if you want to treat yourself to a shopping expedition for new clothes, take a flight with LIAT. You might get where you want to go (although I once presented a boarding pass to Dominica and was transported to Martinique) but your luggage is 50-50 to get there with you at best. 

This World Cup, in many ways, is best watched on television, as many people appear to have decided. One or two stay-at-homes may have regretted it, especially when with many games affected by rain you find yourself being quizzed by your wife into the precise machinations of the Duckworth-Lewis system. 

Well, dear, one side scores 200 in 50 overs, the other side goes into bat, then it rains, and when they come back out they need more runs from fewer overs than when it started raining. Couldnt be simpler, really.

 Gros Islet: South Africa 

 tumbled to their lowest total in a World Cup match on Wednesday 

 when they were dismissed for 149 from 43.5 overs by defending 

 champions Australia in the second semi-final.

 Australia roared into their fourth consecutive 

 World Cup final with a seven-wicket victory over South Africa. 

 After dismissing the Proteas for 149 in 43.5 overs, Australia 

 coasted to 153 for three in 31.3 overs to set up a showdown 

 with Sri Lanka in Saturdays final in Barbados. For 

 the world champions, Michael Clarke top-scoed with an unbeaten 

 60. 

 South Africas previous lowest total was 184 in their 

 upset loss to Bangladesh in this editions Super Eight. 

 The winners will meet Sri Lanka in the final in Bridgetown 

 on Saturday. Justin Kemp top-scored with an unbeaten 49 

 from 91 balls while Herschelle Gibbs, who looked fortunate 

 to survive an appeal for caught behind after scoring four, 

 reached 39. 

 The remainder of the batting succumbed meekly to a combination 

 of excellent pace bowling and culpably loose shots with 

 Shaun Tait taking four for 39 and Glenn McGrath three for 

 18 to regain his place at the top of the tournaments 

 wicket-taking list.

 When Graeme Smith won the toss and chose to bat he was 

 as close to a smile as was possible on a morning of such 

 huge pressure. 

 He knew it was probably his sides best chance of 

 challenging Australia, but within 10 overs his dream was 

 turning into a nightmare. 

 Their top order was blown away as they lost five wickets 

 for 27 runs inside the opening ten overs.

 Smith was first to go, bowled by Nathan Bracken after 

 an ugly heave across the line intended to sail over the 

 covers. The delivery from left-hander to left-hander moved 

 away in the air to clip the off-stump.

 South Africas senior batsman Jacques Kallis made 

 room to drive McGrath but was bowled next ball for five 

 trying to cut a delivery far too full for the shot. Ponting 

 introduced Shaun Tait in the ninth over and AB de Villiers 

 greeted the fast bowler by pulling the first ball fiercely 

 for four. 

 ait immediately worked up a high pace and with his fifth 

 ball de Villiers was beaten for speed and caught behind 

 by Adam Gilchrist for 15.

 Ashwell Prince followed in the next over to McGrath, also 

 caught behind, for a duck to yet another loose shot to a 

 ball wide of the stumps. 

 Mark Boucher was out next ball caught by Matthew Hayden 

 at first slip. Kemp survived the hattrick ball.

 Gibbs sliced Tait to third man for four and followed up 

 with a lovely cover-drive for a second boundary. 

 In combination with Kemp he restored some order to the 

 innings with Kemp hooking Shane Watson fiercely for six 

 to bring up the 50 partnership. 

 The 60-run stand between Kemp and Gibbs for the sixth wicket 

 was the only positive phase during the South African innings 

 who otherwise did little to erase the image of chokers.

 Tait was recalled and Gibbs responded with a drive over 

 covers for his sixth four but was then caught behind two 

 balls later.

 Andrew Hall and Shaun Pollock returned to the pavilion 

 in quick succession, leaving the innings in tatters at 103 

 for 8. Andre Nel (8) then blocked 41 balls before Taits 

 extra bounce did him in. Kemp, realising that he was running 

 out of partners, decided to open his shoulder and tasted 

 some success.

 None of the tailenders, however, could stick around with 

 Kemp, who got to within one run of his half-century when 

 Watson bowled Charl Langeveldt for six to finish the innings.

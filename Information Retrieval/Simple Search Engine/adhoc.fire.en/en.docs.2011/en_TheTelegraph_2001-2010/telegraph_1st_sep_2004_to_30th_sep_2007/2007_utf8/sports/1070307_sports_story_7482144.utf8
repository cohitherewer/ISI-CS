 Louis Saha ruled out 

Manchester: Louis Saha was injured in training on Tuesday and will miss Manchester Uniteds Champions League match with Lille on Wednesday. 

Midfielder Darren Fletcher, who picked up an ankle injury last week, will also miss the game after a scan showed ligament damage worse than first thought and is expected to be sidelined for at least two months. 

Louis was injured in training and was sent for a scan and wont be fit although we are not yet sure exactly what the injury is, manager Alex Ferguson said. (Reuters)

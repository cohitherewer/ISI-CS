 Flintoff absence will help us: Dravid 

 Dravid 

Hove: Skipper Rahul Dravid says India have a good chance of doing well in the upcoming Test series against England as the hosts were most likely to miss the services of their star allrounder Andrew Flintoff. 

Flintoff, who underwent an ankle surgery, was still recuperating and is doubtful to play any part in the three-match series beginning at Lords on July 19. 

Fast-bowling allrounders are like gold and England have a problem replacing him. His absence makes things far more equal this time, Dravid told a news agency. 

Flintoff has picked 22 wickets in nine Tests against India. As captain, he took three for 14 as England won the final Test in Mumbai to level the series in 2005-6. 

When England came to India last time he was brilliant. He led really well and he was outstanding with bat and ball, Dravid added. 

Things have not gone so well for Flintoff since that tour losing the Ashes 0-5 as captain and then being stripped of the vice-captaincy at the World Cup after some late night adventures in the Caribbean. 

The 29-year-old is working hard with long-term physio and mentor Dave Roberts to recuperate and might feature in the seven-match one-day series beginning at the Rose Bowl on August 21. 

Dravid also said England were strengthened by the selection of Sussex wicketkeeper-batsman Matt Prior, who has scored a century and two 50s in his first six Test innings. 

Prior lends a lot of balance, but weve got to play the whole team. England are ranked second behind Australia so obviously they have a good set-up and I followed their series against the West Indies closely, he said. (PTI)

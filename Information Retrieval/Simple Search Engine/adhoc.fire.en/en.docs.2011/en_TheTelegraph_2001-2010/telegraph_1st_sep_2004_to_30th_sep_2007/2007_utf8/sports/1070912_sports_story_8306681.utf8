 This win is for the fans: EB coach

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Ludhiana: East Bengal coach Subrata Bhattacharya on Tuesday dedicated their win to their supporters. 

I wanted to give something to my supporters for their faith in the team. This victory is for them, said Bhattacharya, following their 3-2 semi-final victory over Mohun Bagan in the Federation Cup. 

I am very happy for the boys. They played their hearts out. Mohun Bagan did well but we were better. It was a very competitive match, he said. 

On bringing in Dipendu Biswas for Debabrata Roy, he said: I took a chance. I had a plan and we did accordingly. The substitution was to ensure we did not stop attacking. 

Bhattacharya denied there was any complacency after the team went 3-1 ahead. You cant afford to be complacent at this level. 

Asked why they went on the defensive in the last 15 minutes, Bhattacharya said: It is an Indian phenomenon. Most Indian teams tend to become defensive after taking the lead. 

Bhattacharya had a word of praise for Dipendu and Rahim Nabi. They were crucial today. Nabi is one of the best in my team. 

Mohun Bagan coach Carlos Roberto Pereira said, I wish we had played the first-half like the second-half. We took the lead and tried to sit on it. It was a mistake. 

Pereira noted: The goals we let in came from midfield lapses. My man of the match was Barreto. He played everywhere.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bose well-placed for England

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai: Ranadeb Bose need not feel too dejected as the senior national selectors have him in mind for the forthcoming Test series in England. 

Bose was discussed during the selection meeting, but we felt his style of (swing) bowling is more suited for England rather than conditions in Bangladesh. Im very hopeful hes going to be in the Test squad for England, Easts representative on the committee, Ranjib Biswal, told The Telegraph. 

Ranadeb, by the way, has been called for the May 2-6 conditioning camp in Calcutta before Team Indias departure for Bangladesh. Four other new-ball bowlers (including Ishant Sharma) have been asked to report as well.

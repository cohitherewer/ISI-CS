Panaji: East Bengal face the tough challenge of Dempo in a crucial National Football League tie on Sunday. 

Dempo, after losses to Mahindra United, Mohammedan Sporting and JCT, fell to second spot, but the win against Churchill Brothers put them back on track. They share the top spot with Mahindra United on 26 points from 14 rounds. East Bengal are third on 22. 

East Bengal need to win Sunday and then against Sporting Clube de Goa before facing Mahindra at home.

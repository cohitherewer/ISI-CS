The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Double by Lagat

Osaka: The finale of the World Athletic Championships belonged to the glittering US track team on a Sunday night spiced up by charismatic European performances in the field. 

American Allyson Felix, assisted by DeeDee Trotter, Mary Wineberg and Sanya Richards, ran away with her third gold of the meet in the womens 4x400m relay. 

She was joined as a multiple gold medallist by compatriots Jeremy Wariner, anchor of the triumphant mens 4x400 team, and Bernard Lagat who became the first man to win the 1,500 and 5,000 titles at the same worlds. 

Sundays victories meant the US became the first nation to sweep all four relays in world championships history. 

I feel truly blessed, Felix smiled after becoming only the second woman to win three gold at the same world championships after East German Marita Koch in 1983.

 Anju manages ninth

Osaka: Anju Bobby George was nowhere near her seasons best, let alone personal best, and the lanky long jumper cleared 6.53m to finish a disappointing ninth in the final of the World Championship here on Tuesday. 

The lone Indian athlete to make it to the final of the World Championship for the third time, Anju cut a sorry figure and her show was well below her personal best of 6.83m which came at the 2004 Athens Olympics and her seasons best of 6.65m. 

The Indian could clear just 6.10m in her first effort before fouling her next jump. 

It was in her third attempt that Anju managed 6.53m, which was even below her 6.60m effort in Mondays qualifying round. 

Meanwhile, Russias pole vault queen Yelena Isinbayeva easily retained her title but was unable to break her own world record. 

With her opponents all eliminated, the Olympic champion attempted to break her world best of 5.01m but failed with three vaults at 5.02m in sultry conditions. 

Isinbayeva won with a vault of 4.80m, while Czech Katerina Badurova took silver with 4.75 and Russias Svetlana Feofanova bronze after taking an extra vault to clear the same height. 

The 25-year-old pumped her fist and shrieked with joy after sailing over 4.80m at the second attempt. 

She came closest on her third attempt but her failure to raise the bar for the first time since 2005 did not dampen her delight at defending her world title. 

The Kenyan steeple chasers turned their traditional domination into the first clean sweep at these championships. Allowing for Kenyan-born two-time champion Saif Saaeed Shaheen of Qatar, out with an Achilles injury, runners from the African nation have won the last nine world titles. 

This time Brimin Kipruto took the honours, with Ezekiel Kemboi earning silver for the second time in a row. Richard Kipkemboi Mateelong finished third. 

Buoyed by that success, Janeth Jepkosgei led from start to finish to win the womens 800m with such poise, grace and speed, former world champion Maria Mutola just gave up with a grimace with 70m to go, unable to catch up. (AP)

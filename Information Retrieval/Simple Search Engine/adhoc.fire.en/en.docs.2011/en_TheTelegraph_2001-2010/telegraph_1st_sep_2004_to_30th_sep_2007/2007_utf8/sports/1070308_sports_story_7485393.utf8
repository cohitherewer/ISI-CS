 Biswajit predicts tough match

Panaji: Churchill Brothers will go all out for a win when they lock horns with Mohammedan Sporting at home in the National Football League for the ONGC Cup on Thursday. 

Churchill, who have seven points from as many matches, had defeated Sporting Clube de Goa and held defending champions Mahindra United. However, lack of bench strength was exposed as they failed to win any of their last five games. 

Mohammedan Sporting, who are at the bottom of the table with six points from seven matches, will be inspired by their good showing against Sporting Clube, whom they held goalless the other day under new coach Biswajit Bhattacharya. 

Thursdays match is crucial for us and we need to win it. Churchill are a good side and will have the home advantage. With both teams under pressure to perform, it should be a close contest, Bhattacharya said. 

Bhattacharya took over Subhas Bhowmick recently after a series of poor results by the black-and-white brigade. 

For Sporting, striker Odafa Okeli has struggled up front in the absence of George Ekeh, while the midfield has failed to click in the absence of Chandam Chitrasen. 

But the return of Ekeh and Vinu Jose will bolster the team.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Team from Brazil or Venezuela likely 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Come August, a national-level team from Brazil or Venezuela may be seen in action in India as the All India Football Federation (AIFF) is planning to hold an eight-nation international tournament in collaboration with ONGC. 

The tournament, first of its kind in India since the Millennium Cup in 2000, might cost the Indian oil majors at least a couple of crores of rupees and will be held from August 1 to 12. 

Apart from a team from Latin America, the national teams from countries like Vietnam, Myanmar, Russia, Nigeria and Sudan are expected to take part in the tournament. 

ONGC has been working in at least 15 countries all over the world, a company official told The Telegraph. We would like to invite national teams from some of these countries to play in the tournament, he added. 

Though the venue for the tournament has not yet been finalised, the organisers hope to get a clearance from the AIFF for holding it in Delhi. 

ONGC, which has been sponsoring the National Football League (NFL) for two years now, might be rewarded by the AIFF by giving their Mumbai-based football team a place in the second division NFL.

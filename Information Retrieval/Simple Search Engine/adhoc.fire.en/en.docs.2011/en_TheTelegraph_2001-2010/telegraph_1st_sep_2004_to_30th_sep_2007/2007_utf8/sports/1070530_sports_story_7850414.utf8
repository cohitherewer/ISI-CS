The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The most obscure world No. 4

Barry Flatman

 Nikolay Davydenko 

As sporting put-downs go, David Colemans infamous pronouncement from the 1968 Olympics of who cares whos third? as John Sherwood heroically strode to the bronze medal behind David Hemery takes some beating. But considering 128 male players began the first round of the French Open on an equal footing, the assumption that only two matter has never been quite so overbearing. 

Of course its perfectly understandable why the spotlight is so firmly focused on Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Rivalries are the lifeblood of any sport and the prospect of another glorious showdown between the Swiss and the Spaniard in a fortnights time is something that excites anybody who cares about the sport. 

But rarely has a highly ranked player been treated with quite so much disinterest as Nikolay Davydenko. 

Even the Russian media refers to the man, who stood at third in the world rankings behind Federer and Nadal till a few months ago (currently No. 4), as Kolya (apparently the given nickname for anyone named Nikolay in what used to be the Soviet Union) the Obscure. 

Here in Paris, he truly should merit a little more attention after winning the years concluding Masters Series event at Bercy last November. And just a few weeks ago he pushed Nadal as far as the reigning champion would want to go, in a stunning semi-final in Rome. 

Yet nobody really seemed too bothered as the fourth seed wasted barely a minute of the dry spells between showers to post an emphatic first-round victory over Stefano Galvani on Monday. Davydenko allowed his unfortunate Italian opponent just five games and wrapped up victory in little more than an hour and a half, but still nobody seemed that interested. 

There are reasons of course. Davydenko may be an absolute comedian in his native Ukrainian tongue or even German after living in Salmtal near Koblenz for several years. 

But his English is limited, so he does not possess the ability to express himself in any other way besides monosyllables in press conferences. 

And his game is not particularly spectacular. There are no big shots in his armoury, but a determined doggedness to chase down every ball. In fact his reputation in the mens locker room is that of a human wall. 

Finally, until recently being signed up to wear the Airness brand of clothing, he habitually dressed dull on the court with grey regularly being his chosen colour of shirt.

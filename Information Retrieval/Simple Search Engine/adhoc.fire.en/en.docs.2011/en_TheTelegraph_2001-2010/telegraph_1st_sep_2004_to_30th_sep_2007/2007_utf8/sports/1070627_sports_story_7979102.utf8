 Wimbledon fears call of the wild

London: Squirrels, pigeons and mice Wimbledons Centre Court has attracted a menagerie of animals over the years who brought many a tense match to a halt with their unwelcome intrusions. 

Nowadays, though, it is streakers who are the bigger menace, prompting the tournament authorities last year to contemplate putting up a fence between spectators and players. 

The problem of animal intruders came to a head in 1999 when German players Boris Becker and Nicolas Kiefer were twice dive-bombed from the grandstand roof by pigeons. 

So the All England Club gratefully accepted the services of a full-time falconer to patrol the courts with a swooping bird of prey, named Finnegan, acting as a highly effective deterrent. 

Wimbledon librarian Alan Little, who boasts an encyclopaedic knowledge of tournament history, has compiled for his annual Wimbledon compendium a history of the most intriguing Centre Court invasions. 

Back in 1949, the Centre Court ball boys had to chase a squirrel off the hallowed turf while the players sat down to await the all clear. 

Pam Shriver once had to contend with a swarm of bees. One stung her opponent, Kathy Rinaldi, on the arm and Shriver gallantly went over to remove the sting. 

John McEnroe and Stefan Edberg had their razor-sharp concentration disturbed in the 1989 semi-final by two sparrows swooping in low. 

But the humans win the top prizes for the most eccentric interruptions. 

In the 1957 mens final, a Mrs Helen Jarvis invaded the court, shouting and waving a banner calling for a new world banking system. 

A female streaker first took to the court in the 1996 mens final and, since then, the publicity-seeking temptation has proved overwhelming on several occasions. 

Last year, Maria Sharapova was startled by a streaker who leapt on to Centre Court during her quarter final against Elena Dementieva. 

She averted her gaze as he cart-wheeled naked in front of her before being bundled off court by security guards who wrapped him in a red blanket.

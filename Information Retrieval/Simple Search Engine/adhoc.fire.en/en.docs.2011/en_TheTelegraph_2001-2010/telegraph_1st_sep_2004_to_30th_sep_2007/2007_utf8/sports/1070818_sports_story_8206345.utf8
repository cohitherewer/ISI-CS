 Turf did the trick, says Houghton

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: A smiling Indian coach Bob Houghton on Friday dedicated his teams emphatic 6-0 victory over Cambodia to the newly-laid turf at the Ambedkar Stadium and steady display by his team. 

Mobbed by the media immediately after the match, the British coach said his team has given an allround display to win the match convincingly. 

The Ambedkar Stadium turf was really good. If we get to play more on such turf, the team will fare better. I have been saying this for a long time. Today it proved how right my assessment was. 

The Indian coach was not ready to take any question on the fact that India were a struggling lot in the first 20 minutes. The first and last 20 minutes is always different, he pointed out. We scored four goals in the last 15 minutes. When did India score so many goals in a match? he asked. 

Houghton, in fact, said that India played aggressively in the first half. We should have been up by at least four goals in the first half. We missed chances. 

Houghton was right. The only time India won by a bigger margin was 44 years ago in the Olympic qualifier against Sri Lanka in 1963. India then won 7-0. It is good that we scored a lot of goals after a long time in an international match, the coach said. It will be confidence booster for the boys for the rest of the tournament.

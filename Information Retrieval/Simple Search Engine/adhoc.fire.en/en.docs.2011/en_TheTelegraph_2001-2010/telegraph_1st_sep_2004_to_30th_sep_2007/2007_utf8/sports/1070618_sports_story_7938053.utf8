 Ireland name depleted squad

London: With their star players missing due to injury, Ireland have announced a severely depleted 13-member squad for their one-dayers against India and South Africa beginning June 23. 

In the bowling department, Andre Botha, Dave Langford-Smith and Boyd Rankin have failed to recover from their respective injuries in time. 

The batting also lacks depth and to compound their troubles, both Jeremy Bray and Eoin Morgan have declared themselves unavailable while allrounder Peter Gillespie has decided to call it a day. 

Theres no doubt we have been badly hit by injuries, coach Phil Simmons was quoted in their official website. 

Morgans case is a great concern as more and more Ireland players pledge their future to England. Morgan has informed me that he isnt available for the ODIs because of his commitments with Middlesex, Simmons said. 

THE SQUAD 

Trent Johnston (Capt), Kenny Carroll, Alex Cusack, Thinus Fourie, Dominick Joyce, Gary Kidd, Kyle McCallan, Kevin Brien, Niall Brien, William Porterfield, Roger Whelan, Andrew White, Gary Wilson. (PTI)

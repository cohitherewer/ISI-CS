 ICC denies Pawar claim 

Bangalore: The ICC has denied Sharad Pawars claim that the games governing body has set up a committee to look into the jelly beans incident during the Trent Bridge Test. 

BCCI president Pawar told reporters on Friday that the ICC has appointed a two-member committee and the issue is expected to figure at an ICC meeting in Dubai on Monday. 

However, when contacted, this is what the ICC spokesman Brian Murgatroyd said: Nothing of this sort has happened. Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle is there to look into the affairs. He has said that he will speak to the two captains before the third Test. That is where it stands. That is the end of it. 

Meanwhile, Monty Panesar said that the jelly bean prank played on Zaheer Khan during the Test was unintentional. I think it is probably a bit misinterpreted. It was maybe accidental or maybe a mistake at the drinks interval, the English spinner said. (agencies)

 Four from Yard to join probe

London: Four British police officers, led by an expert, will travel to Jamaica to help authorities investigate the death of Pakistan cricket coach Bob Woolmer. 

Londons Scotland Yard said on Saturday that a senior detective from the Homicide and Serious Crime command, two detectives and a specialist scenes of crime officer will arrive in Jamaica next week. 

We received a formal request from the Jamaican authorities to review the investigation, a Scotland Yard spokesperson said. 

She could not confirm precisely when they would arrive. 

Woolmer, 58, was found unconscious in Jamaica Pegasus on March 18 (Sunday) and pronounced dead at a hospital, the morning after his teams surprise defeat to Ireland at the World Cup. 

Jamaica police blamed the death on strangulation and requested help from London police. The four British officers will review the work carried out by local law enforcement authorities. 

It is normal practice for a review to take place a short time after a murder investigation has begun, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement. The Jamaican Constabulary Force remains the primary investigating force. 

A pathologist who conducted the autopsy initially ruled the cause of death as inconclusive, but four days later announced that Woolmer had died from strangulation. 

No suspects have been identified, but police are investigating match-fixing as a possible motive.

 Roger way ahead of the rest

Serve Volley

On Monday, Wimbledon 2007 gets underway. Roger Federer, in quest of his fifth consecutive title, takes on a little known Russian Termuraz Gabashvili. During the fortnight, half a million people will come through the turnstiles, while close to 700 million homes will receive television coverage for one of the worlds greatest sporting events.

The ivy clad centre court, alas, is topless. The roof has been taken off, and is being replaced by a translucent retractable roof, which will be completed by July 2008. When I saw the court last week I was devastated. The stadium looked naked and the bare bones of the Centre Court gave it an eerie look. Two huge television screens were being erected so that all the spectators could see the results of a player challenging a line decision with a HawkEye replay. 

Modern technology, thank heavens, has driven away unsavoury John McEnroe type protests forever. Happily, and inevitably, Wimbledon continues to cloak 21st century facilities in robust British traditions. 

Federer and Nadal tower above what seems to be a mediocre field. The only danger comes from Andy Roddick the third seed. With his 150mph serve clicking, and his burgeoning confidence after his narrow victory at Queens, Roddick may prove to be a handful for Federer in the semi finals. 

His experience of winning a Grand Slam title will stand him in good stead. There is little doubt, that Federer is head and shoulders above the rest. But one is concerned about Federers comprehensive defeat at the hands of Nadal in the French Open, and how this may have affected his confidence. 

Federer looked shattered at the prize giving ceremony. He withdrew from Halle, a grass court tournament and went back to Switzerland to recharge his batteries. Rest, significantly, took precedence over vital grasscourt practice. 

In contrast, Nadal, bouncing with energy was at Queens club on the Monday after the French. In the first two rounds at Queens Nadal produced sparkling grasscourt tennis. He hit an early ball and made several sorties to the net. He was so impressive, that experienced television commentators made him an odds on chance for Wimbledon. 

Their hopes were short lived. In the quarter finals, a 25-year-old Frenchman, Nicolas Mahout, who won junior Wimbledon in 2000, gave Nadal a lesson in grasscourt play. Mahout produced a vintage serve and volley attack which unsettled Nadal who could not find the timing to unleash his top-spin forehand. 

It was refreshing to break away from the boring base line rallies that dominate modern tennis. Mahout is a dangerous floater in the tournament, but has a very tough draw. However, with a bit of luck he could be playing against Roddick in the last eight. He held a match point against Roddick in the final at Queens Club. 

Federers section of the draw is very strong. Marat Safin, looms large in the third round. Safin can, on his day, defeat anybody. The next challenge to Federer is likely to come in the quarter finals from Tommy Haas of Germany, a bold never-say-die competitor. It is in the semi-finals that Federer will confront his strongest adversary, Andy Roddick. 

Nadal seems to have a good draw, but has a tough first-round match against Mardy Fish of the US. With the exception of Tomas Berdych, the other seeds in Nadals quarter are unlikely to pose any problems. The top quarter of the lower half is packed with talent. 

Novak Djokovic, Nikolay Davydenko, David Nalbandian, Marcos Baghdatis, Lewitt Hewitt and Guillermo Canas are the seeded players in the quarter with the 6-foot 10-inch Croat Ivo Karlovic as a dangerous floater. In what will surely be a bitterly contested quarter, Davydenko or Djokovic may eventually contest for a place in the semi-finals. 

Nadal seems to have the measure of any player in the lower half and Wimbledon 2007 seems to be headed, once again, for a Federer-Nadal final. Federer at his best is unbeatable on grass and seems poised to collect his fifth consecutive title. 

The womens singles is wide open. Justine Henin, Amelie Mauresmo or Maria Sharapova could win the Championships. Sharapovas powerful aggressive style could tilt the balance in her favour. Henin and Mauresmo have smooth all court games. 

Both have powerful single-handed backhands and are good volleyers but are much better on higher bouncing surfaces. The womens ranks are full of young talent. Ana Ivanovic, Nicole Vaidisova, Tatiana Golovin, Dinara Safina and Anna Chakvetadze all have Grand Slam potential but will require a little more time to break through. 

The hottest prospect is the third seed, Jelena Jankovic of Serbia. She is capable of upsetting Henin in the semi-finals. 

For those who favour a flutter, Serena Williams is a good outside bet to win this year. 

Indias Sania Mirza could not have asked for a better draw. 

Not much is known about her 80th ranked Russian opponent Yaroslava Shvedova, but one feels confident that Sania can hit her way into the second round where she will meet the 11th seeded Russian Nadia Petrova. 

Petrova last week pulled out of the semi-finals in Eastbourne due to a pectoral injury. This will be Sanias big chance. If she plays like she did against Dementieva last year, she can pull it off. A victory against Petrova would stop the slide in Sanias rankings and put her back on track to the top 20. 

Wimbledon 2007 could be the defining moment of Sanias career. One hopes she can raise her game and meet the challenge.

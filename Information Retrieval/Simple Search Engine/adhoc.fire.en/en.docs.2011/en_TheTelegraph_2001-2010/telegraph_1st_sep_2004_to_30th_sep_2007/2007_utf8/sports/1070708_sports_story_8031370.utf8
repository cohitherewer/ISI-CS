 Federer, Nadal back in Big W final

 - It has become sort of a routine, but Im still so excited, says defending champion 

Wimbledon: Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal will meet in another Grand Slam final. 

Four-time defending champion Federer reached his ninth consecutive Major final on Saturday, beating Richard Gasquet 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 on the grasscourts of the All England Club. 

It has become sort of a routine, but Im still so excited to be back in the final, said Federer, who beat Nadal to win last years title but lost to the Spaniard in the last two French Open finals. 

Nadal set up a rematch at Wimbledon when No. 4 Novak Djokovic withdrew while trailing 3-6, 6-1, 4-1. 

Im going to have a very difficult match tomorrow (Sunday), but Im going to try my best, said Nadal, a three-time champion at Roland Garros. 

The win was Federers 53rd straight on grass. He finished with 20 aces, including one on a second serve in the final game of the match. 

Gasquet matched Federer for most of the first set, but the top-ranked Swiss player saved all three break points he faced, including two at 5-5. Federer saved the first with an ace and the next with a forehand winner before winning the next two points. 

Including those four points, Federer won 44 of the final 54 points on his serve. 

If I did this break point, everything can happen if I win the first set, Gasquet said. 

With Gasquet serving at 6-5, the Frenchman was only two points away from forcing a first-set tie-breaker, but Federer won four straight points to take the set. 

The first set was crucial, Federer said. He should have at least got to the tie-breaker. I came out somehow and played really well for 10 minutes and was up a set and a break, and that was pretty much it after that. 

In the second set, Federer held in the first game and then broke again, eventually taking a 3-0 lead. 

After the set ended, the 12th-seeded Gasquet called for a trainer to look at his left ankle. His ferocious backhands and whipping cross-court forehands again won him points, but Federer was too good, breaking Gasquet to lead 4-3 in the final set. 

The 25-year-old Federer, who is the oldest of the four mens semi-finalists, is trying to win a fifth consecutive Wimbledon title, something only Bjorn Borg has done in the past 100 years. Borg, who won his titles from 1976-80, watched the match from the stands, wearing a purple-and-green tie the colors of the All England Club. 

It is tricky when you see him sitting there because he is a living legend, Federer said. I have so much respect for him that it is great that hes here. I hope I can do the job tomorrow (Sunday). 

Gasquet came back from a two-set deficit to defeat Andy Roddick of the US on Friday in the quarter finals. 

Everything was difficult because I finished at so late on Friday, Gasquet said. I have to play at noon, so thats not easy. I was tired. 

Federer didnt look tired. The 10-time Grand Slam champion dropped his first set of the tournament in Fridays quarter finals, but hadnt played a full match in one day since beating Marat Safin in the third round last Friday. 

Nadal pressured Djokovic early, earning three break points in the first game but failing to convert. Djokovic then broke Nadal in the second game, and only conceded three more points on his serve for the rest of the set. 

I started the match playing bad tennis, Nadal said. But I was practising even worse before the warm-up, too. 

The second set started with Nadal holding and then breaking Djokovics serve. After Nadal evened the match at one set apiece, Djokovic called for a trainer. He got the little toe on his left foot bandaged. 

In the first game of second set, second game, I had the break, Nadal said. That was decisive in the match Because I get confidence there. 

In the third set, Djokovic continued to hobble but saved two break points in the opening game. 

Then, serving at 1-1, 30-30, he put a forehand wide and dropped to the grass, rocking on the balls of his feet. His next shot was a forehand into the net. 

Nadal held easily to lead 3-1 and forced two more break points in the fifth game. Djokovic saved one but hit a forehand into the net on the second. 

The trainer immediately returned and Djokovic soon decided to retire. 

Djokovic also withdrew against Nadal in the quarter finals of the French Open last year. 

Both players have spent a lot of time on court over the past few days because of the massive backlog created by persistent rain throughout the tournament. 

Nadal played two five-setters before reaching the semi-finals on Friday with a straight-set win. But Djokovic needed five sets on Friday in the quarter finals, and four sets in each of the previous two rounds.

 Mixed CAB panel on the cards

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The CAB annual general meeting is still a few weeks away. As of now, it looks like the next set of office bearers could come from different camps. 

There are three distinct groups president Prasun Mukherjees men, one backed by former president Jagmohan Dalmiya and the other led by Goutam Das Gupta. There are two posts, so there will be a contest unless one group decides not to field a candidate. 

The possibility of a mixed panel is there, though with different secretarial candidates (from those who are in office now), a source said on Sunday. There will be strong objections if Saradindu Pal contests. 

Amitava Banerjee, the other joint secretary, has already made it known that he doesnt want to continue. 

It has been learnt that the Das Gupta-led group has suggested to the president that he should continue, along with treasurer Shiv Kumar Kalyani. What they have asked for are two effective secretaries. Pal doesnt figure on their wish list. 

The opposition group may pick assistant secretary Biswarup Dey as their joint secretary candidate, while the presidents men are almost sure to field Samar Paul. Indications are that Das Guptas camp will nominate former joint secretary Bablu Kolay for the post. 

Many of those who supported the police chief last July, are not satisfied with the way things have gone since Mukherjee replaced Dalmiya as president. They feel that there hasnt been enough transparency in the running of CAB.

 More misery in store for England

 - Fine fielder needed to lift unexceptional bowling 

 SCYLD BERRY

 Much will depend on Andrew Flintoff 

Englands best is yet to come this summer. Or, more likely, their worst. If they are to avert a wipe-out by India in the seven-match one-day series, England would have to enjoy all the luck of the toss in the three day/nighters, so they can bat first and then watch the white ball zip around on dewy late August evenings under less than brilliant floodlights. 

After the World Cup, England have gone backwards in 50-over cricket, an impressive achievement considering how lacklustre they were in the West Indies. 

Englands new coach, Peter Moores, may argue that it was necessary to go backwards in order to go forwards. Trouble is, the normal state of Englands one-day team is going backwards, and there was no end in sight as West Indies beat England in early July by a far wider margin than 2-1 suggests. 

What is it that makes England so feeble at 50-over matches? 

The Ashes-winning team of 2005 was the only one-day side England have had since the 1992 World Cup which looked as though it may win a decent pot. The batting was led by Marcus Trescothick and Kevin Pietersen, the fielding was sound if not spectacular and the old-ball bowling of Steve Harmison, Andrew Flintoff and Simon Jones took wickets to make good the lack of a penetrative spinner. 

Since the summer of 2005 and you had better put your tea-cup down to avoid sudden spillage England have played 42 one-day Internationals against Big Boys (forget Kenya, Ireland and their ilk), and they have been bowled out in 22 of them. In four more, they have finished with nine wickets down. This is feeble in the extreme. 

How can grown men, equipped with bats what is more, be bowled out time and again in only 50 overs? As the black Bradman, George Headley, used to say about his teammates in the immature West Indian teams of the 1930s: Why dem no like to bat? 

So long as England are being bowled out in the majority of their one-dayers, such subtleties as power plays will have to wait. 

Falling between stools neither scoring quickly by making use of the fielding restrictions nor keeping wickets in hand England dribble to 90-odd for three from their 20 overs of power play. But even more important is reaching the 40th over with two batsmen set and wickets in hand, so the last 10 overs can be hit for 100-plus, as West Indies did in the last two one-dayers. 

The one redeeming feature of Englands batting in that series was Owais Shah, who wristily found the gaps to hit 138 off 168 balls. A caveat is that he scored all but three of his boundaries behind the wicket, but at least he has brought teeth to Englands post-Pietersen middle-order. 

Since the summer of 2005, England have bowled out Big Boy opponents 10 times only: they themselves are dismissed in 50 overs more than half the time, and they dismiss opponents less than a quarter of the time. In other words, England completely miss the plot of one-day cricket. The objective is to bowl the other side out, as Australia and Sri Lanka almost invariably did to reach the World Cup final. 

At least Flintoff will return against India. Ryan Sidebottoms left-arm swing may translate into new-ball wickets, if not old-ball reverse-swing from round the wicket, like Indias left-armers or Australias Nathan Bracken. 

Stuart Broad is going to be a winner by 2010-11. But England still have no wicket-taking spinner. Monty Panesar took one wicket and that a tail-ender, Daren Powell in his two games against West Indies, and has yet to learn how to fish for batsmen by offering bait. 

No less disappointing was Englands fielding against the West Indies. Comparisons with the bazaars of Samarkand and Tashkent were far-fetched, but the fielding was at best sound, and some fleetness of foot and hand has to be found beyond the captain, Paul Collingwood, who started taking himself away from the pivotal position of point to concentrate on his bowlers. 

Michael Vaughan had to go as Englands one-day captain a) to protect his right knee and b) to allow Englands fielding to regenerate. His earnest example at mid-on was not enough. He dropped the biggest dolly of the World Cup against Bangladesh. 

The only time Australia might have stumbled came when Vaughan picked up at midwicket a push by Ricky Ponting, who had a moment of madness, started running and gave up. Australia would have been 97 for three in the 23rd, chasing 248 on a sluggish pitch, if Vaughan had hit. 

England need inter alia a crackerjack fielder to lift their unexceptional bowling. The next three weeks will tell us if Ravi Bopara, who missed the West Indies series, is one of the answers.

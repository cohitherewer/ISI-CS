 Tait undergoes surgery 

Sydney: Australian fast bowler Shaun Tait underwent a minor operation on Tuesday in a bid to be ready for this years inaugural Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa. 

Surgeons carried out arthroscopic surgery to remove scar tissue from Taits right elbow that had been troubling him since the limited-overs World Cup in the West Indies. 

Tait was one of the standout players of the Australian team that won the World Cup for the fourth time after being called into the side as a late replacement for the injured Brett Lee. 

Tait is expected to be out of action until August but could return for the Twenty20 World Cup a month later.

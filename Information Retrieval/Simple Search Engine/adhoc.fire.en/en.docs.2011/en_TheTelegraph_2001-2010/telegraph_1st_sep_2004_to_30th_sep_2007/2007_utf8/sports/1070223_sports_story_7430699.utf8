 Aussies may dump batting-first policy

 - Move will ease pressure off bowlers, says Ricky Ponting 

 Ponting doesnt feel Australia are in dire straits 

Sydney: Captain Ricky Ponting on Thursday hinted that Australia may consider changing their preference of batting first in one-day Internationals to ease the pressure on their under-performing bowlers in the upcoming World Cup. 

Australia have been on the wrong end of the four biggest run-chases in one-day cricket history, all in the past 14 months, raising concerns about the ability of their bowlers to contain the opposition. 

Australia have generally followed conventional thinking by batting first when they win the toss, but Ponting said they may have to consider changing their policy. 

Were going to come up against some small grounds in World Cup, so the consideration of batting second in ODIs is something to think about, Ponting said in Sydney on Thursday. 

That straightaway eases a bit of the pressure on the bowlers. 

Ponting is one of five senior Australian players who missed the teams short tour of New Zealand, where they were drubbed 0-3. 

He accepted the team had not played to its full potential but dismissed suggestions that they were on the slide because they had lost five games in a row. 

I dont think the teams in any dire straits at the moment, he said. 

Weve had a few injuries and lost a few guys, but Im pretty confident that well be ultra competitive in every game we play. If you sat back and look at the results only and you notice that weve lost five games in a row, it doesnt read that well. 

But I think right through everyone of those games weve done lots of things well, but we havent done them well enough for long enough. 

Ponting said the results had not reduced his confidence in the team but admitted they have boosted the morale of their opponents. 

I think other teams around the world will be thinking Australia are beatable now, where only a few weeks ago everybody was wondering how any other team in the world was going to compete with us, Ponting said. 

Meanwhile, concerned by Australias ineffective bowling in the recent 0-3 series loss in New Zealand, Cricket Australia will give injured Brett Lee until early next week to prove his fitness, reports said on Thursday. 

Lee, who damaged ankle ligaments just before the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy series, was initially to have a second round of scans on Friday, but such is CAs desire to take him to the World Cup that the paceman will be tested on Tuesday, a local newspaper said. (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 EB camp may move to Barasat

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: East Bengals residential camp may be moved from Kalyani to Barasat next week. 

According to a club official, the hotel charges in Kalyani are quite high and it may not be feasible to have the entire length of the camp there. 

Subrata Bhattacharya has planned a three-week residential programme. The camp in Kalyani got underway Monday. 

East Bengal didnt get the accommodation they had availed of last time because of some renovation work there. The one they have booked this time is charging exorbitantly, according to the official. We pay far less for boarding and lodging even in Mumbai, he said. 

The officials will have a discussion with the coach and shift the camp to Barasat, if he agrees. 

Mohun Bagans first practice session of the new season will be under former players Satyajit Chatterjee and Hemanta Dora on Monday, as coach Carlos Roberto Pereira is expected to arrive later next week. The Brazilian had some visa problems, which have been sorted out, according to a Mohun Bagan functionary. 

The training schedule including the issue of a residential camp will be worked out after Pereiras arrival. 

Mohammedan Sporting, who have started training under Shabbir Ali with the target of regaining their NFL elite division berth, will have a two-week camp in Jonai from Monday.

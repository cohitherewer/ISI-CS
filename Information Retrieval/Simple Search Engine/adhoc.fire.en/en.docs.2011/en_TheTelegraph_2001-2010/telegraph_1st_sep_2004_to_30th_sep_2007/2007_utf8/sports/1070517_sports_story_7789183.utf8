 Alas, here comes another Test series

Simon Hughes 

 Harmison is looking sharp 

Are the elements trying to tell us something? The weather has been glorious these past three weeks as some world weary England players went back to their roots to play County cricket. Still on stage, but out of the limelight, they rediscovered their natural rhythms. The batsmen made runs, the bowlers took wickets. 

Then just as they had got back into the groove and were enjoying being cricketers again, along comes another Test series with all the attendant duties and expectations. Right on cue the heavens opened, as if a higher authority was voicing its displeasure at such a relentless international schedule. 

Test series in England used to begin in the first week of June. There might have been a couple of one-day Internationals before that, but essentially the domestic game and the players within it were allowed time to breathe before the international programme started. By then the wider public, too, had had their appetite whetted for something more meaningful than Northants versus Derbyshire, at Wellingborough. 

This year, the third Test of the summer will have already begun inside the first week of June. By the end of that match (June 7-11) the visitors, West Indies, will probably have lost the series. Certainly their lack of preparation (partly weather-inflicted) points to that outcome, and they only have one other three-day match to break up the intensity of four Tests (against the MCC at Durham). 

Test series have become pile-em-high sell-em-off-quick events with no scope to savour or reflect. As a result, the general appetite is dulled. Lords will not be full this week. 

England, to their credit, got down to earnest business on Tuesday. Driven inside by the weather, they gathered in the MCC Indoor School and undertook a lively fielding and fitness session run by new coach Peter Moores. 

 Peter Moores has been very enthusiastic 

Moores barked and clapped enthusiastically and the two injury concerns, Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff, moved around freely, though Flintoff subconsciously favours his right leg when he brakes. His left ankle will never be 100 per cent again, but it is an occupational hazard he has learnt to manage. 

A rhythmic looking Steve Harmison effortlessly got the ball to bounce and shape away from batsmens outside edge. Harmison looks, and sounds, more like the predatory animal of 2004 than the inhibited version of this time last year. 

Moores worked with Ian Bell a glorious timer of the ball who just needs to eradicate the occasional half-hearted stroke and the belligerent Owais Shah. Perhaps deliberately, Moores left his Sussex protege, Matt Prior, to one of the other coaches. 

He knows Priors game inside out. In fact, Prior is just a slightly better version of the cricketer Moores was himself. A fit, lively keeper and a pugnacious batsman. At the crease Prior has a power and physical presence that England havent had in a wicketkeeper since Alec Stewart retired.

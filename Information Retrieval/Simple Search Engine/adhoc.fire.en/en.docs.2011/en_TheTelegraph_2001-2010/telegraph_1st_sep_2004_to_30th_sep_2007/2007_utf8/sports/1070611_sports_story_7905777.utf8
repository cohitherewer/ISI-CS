 Arjun Atwal misses cut

Memphis: Arjun Atwal missed the cut by two shots after a four-over 74 in the second round of the Stanford St Jude golf classic here. 

The Indian golfer, who has been struggling to make a mark lately in the occasional starts on the USPGA Tour this year, missed his fifth cut in a row. 

Atwal lost his USPGA card last year and has since been largely playing on the US Nationwide Tour. 

World no. 4 Adam Scott got himself in a position for a start-to-finish win in the lead-up to the second major of the year the US Open at Oakmont. 

He leads the field by three shots after a third round 68 that gave him a total of nine-under 201. 

The second place was shared by David Toms (66) and Brian Gay (70) at six-under 204. 

Scott has now played three straight rounds in the 60s on a 7,239-yard course where no one has shot better than 66. 

His compatriot Andrew Buckle, a former Asian Tour player who was third after the second round, struck a 75 on Saturday that pulled him down to tied 21st place at one-over 211.

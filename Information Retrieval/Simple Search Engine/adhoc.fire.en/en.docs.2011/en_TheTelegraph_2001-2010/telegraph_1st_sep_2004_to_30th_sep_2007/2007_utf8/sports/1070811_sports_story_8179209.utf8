 Sourav at an English wedding!

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

London: Former England Universities captain Tom Peters is tying the knot with Kavita Verma, whose roots are in Amritsar. 

The wedding (in Slough) is scheduled for Sunday and while such marriages arent uncommon, the groom has chosen to depart from custom and name the tables 22 of them after his favourite England and Indian cricketers. 

Sourav Ganguly is somebody he admires and, so, one table will be in his name Tables are also, for example, going to be named after Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid, brother Sam (a journalist) told The Telegraph. 

Where Englands cricketers are concerned, Geoffrey Boycott, Graham Gooch and Michael Vaughan are among those wholl have tables in their name. 

Peters, who was a left-arm opening bowler, is now a businessman.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A cricket team is never complete, its a work in progress: Chappell

 - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 

 - Symonds injury has thrown open the World Cup 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Visakhapatnam: Like captain Rahul Dravid, Greg Chappell could do with a 30-hour day as the demands on his time are enormous. On Thursday evening, however, he spared almost two hours at the Taj Residency for three newspapers The Telegraph and one each from Bangalore and Mumbai. Despite being late for dinner, the coach (whose contract is till the end of the World Cup) answered all questions.

The following are excerpts

 On Indias chances in the World Cup

Its impossible to tell and I dont have a crystal ball... I cant predict, but weve got as good a chance as most teams... Im of the view that any of the eight seeded ones could take the trophy... Till a couple of weeks ago most would have thought Australia were outright favourites, but Andrew Symonds injury has changed that. In fact, the injury has thrown open the World Cup... The toss, I guess, could make a difference as also the ability to create opportunities and take advantage. Whats certain is that no match can be taken lightly... Bangladesh beat Australia less than two years ago... England beat Australia to win the just-ended tri-series... As a first step, we want to make the semi-finals. From then on, it will be a different ball game and no team is guaranteed anything. 

[If Symonds injury wasnt bad enough for Australia, Fridays development is that the fast and furious Brett Lee could miss the World Cup...] 

On there being no surprise in Indias 15-man squad 

(Grins) Its the squad India wanted... There were options, but only time will tell whether selection being on expected lines is a good thing or not. All 15 must see themselves as frontline players, for if you go into a World Cup relying on key players alone, then youre dead. 

On whether having toured the West Indies last summer is going to be an advantage 

Maybe, may not be... It will be if conditions are the same as last year when most wickets were slow and low... Having said that, the team that does well on the day is the one which will win... Its about the quality and intensity of play over the 100 overs. 

On Team Indias performance in the recent series against the West Indies and the ongoing one versus Sri Lanka 

Were playing better than in South Africa... The balance is definitely better, but the team generally plays well at home. However, what weve done in the last six ODIs isnt necessarily going to have a bearing on the World Cup. (After a pause) Yuvraj (Singh) being in form is going to make a big difference... When in form, hes one of the best in the world... Hes superb in the middle stages and the 30-40 overs period is going to be crucial... Teams which play well there will have the best chance of progressing. 

On the composition of Indias attack in the World Cup 

Three seamers will almost surely play in every match... Ideally, we would like to field five bowlers, but that may not be possible... Our advantage is that weve got three top-order batsmen (Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj) who bowl more than adequate spin. Spinners could decide quite a few matches. 

On Dravids comment that weve got to be smart with the placement of certain fielders and whether hes concerned that the quality of our fielding may not be high 

Concern isnt too strong a word, its probably not strong enough! To be frank, theres no doubt were going to concede runs to the better teams... We knew that when the squad was picked and weve got to organise ourselves accordingly. Weve got to place men in positions to get the best out of them... I expect a few medium-scoring (below 200) matches and, so, runs will have to be saved and weve got to try and keep improving. To get over our weakness on the field, the batsmen must find 30 extra runs... If some feel weve got a Dads Army, then I cant do anything about it. The positive side is that no team has our experience. I would like to look at that. 

On whether Sourav Gangulys exceptional catch to dismiss Sanath Jayasuriya in Goa lessens his worry somewhat 

If the concern is that we may give away 30 runs in every match, then weve got to look at ways to bring that down to 10... Such catches will help. 

On the possibility of Sehwag getting to regularly open with Sourav 

Hes a proven matchwinner at the top of the order and if hes in form, thats where he will do the maximum damage. Thats the ideal situation, but flexibility is going to be the name of our game. The best XI will largely depend on form. Bottomline is that weve got to get the key players in form at the right time... Its going to be a delicate act... Im happy weve got the balance which gives good flexibility. Some weeks back, we were less sure about certain things. Except for Veeru and Yuvraj, the other batsmen are in form and weve got a formidable line-up. A lot of teams would like to have the experience of our top six (Sourav, Sehwag, Sachin, Yuvraj, Dravid and Mahendra Singh Dhoni theyve played a mind-boggling 1,368 ODIs and scored an awesome 46,301 runs)... Actually, we need all 15 to be in form as one never knows who can get injured. Keeping all fit is going to be a challenge. Key players, particularly, will have to be managed very well. 

On Sachin getting a middle-order slot 

He has the talent, the experience and has the creativity... Sachin has the mind to deal with different situations... To have someone with the experience of almost 400 ODIs in the middle-order is terrific... Initially, he was a bit reluctant to take on this role at this stage in his career... He needed a few matches to settle down and has done very well. I spoke to Sachin the other day (about his changed role) and he said he was feeling more comfortable with each day... Personally, I would like him at No.4 and, today, weve got a more dimensional batsman if we need him back at the top... At this stage, Im not unduly worried about his back problem. Hopefully, his form and fitness will hold throughout the World Cup. 

On Dinesh Karthik 

He has come from a long way back... I think hes going to have an important role in the World Cup and beyond... If people think hes a wicketkeeper who bats, then theyve got it all wrong. Karthik is a batsman who keeps... Ive been impressed from the time I first saw him at a camp in Bangalore... Hes a thinking cricketer and took my advice that he should mould himself as a batsman who keeps... Ive always seen him as an investment and its a huge bonus that he keeps. Karthik has taken the limited opportunities very well and gives us options. 

On first-choice keeper Dhoni 

Oh, hes one of the most improved cricketers anywhere in the past 12 months... He has worked hard on his batting... His keeping... Dhoni is one of our key players... In fact, there are some who are more so and he fits that category. Not too long ago, he was seen as somebody would blaze away at the end of the innings. Now, hes a quality middle-order batsman. 

On the difference mental toughness can make in tournaments such as the World Cup 

The mental side is a critical area in cricket... The better state that youre in mentally, the better your chances of succeeding... All teams will be under pressure and the ones which handle the stress of a World Cup better are the ones which will do well... India reached the final of the last edition and must have handled the pressure well. Losing in that final (to Australia) wasnt a failure... Simply getting there, I would say, had been a success. But, then, what happened four years ago will become irrelevant when we start the 2007 campaign (March 17, against Bangladesh). 

On whether Sourav and Zaheer Khans comeback signalled the failure of his looking-ahead policy initiated in late 2005 

If somebody looks at it that way, then the person has no idea what hes talking about. Blooding youngsters was part of the development programme and they havent been failures... If you want to win, youve to keep developing players... Its a process... The one who has come under the most criticism is Suresh Raina... Well, if you look at his (ODI) record and compare it with Sachins at the same stage in his career, you wont find a difference... Nobody walks into international cricket as a complete product... They need opportunities... Yes, there were a few senior players who needed to be dropped for them to reassess and return stronger... They have... One of the dangers of fielding the same players match after match is that you end up with a lost generation... If some dont get opportunities at the right time, theyre lost forever. Im convinced that the pressure of younger players knocking on the door has been good for the older ones. I dont think we would have been in the position were in if we didnt do the things we did in the last 21 months. I strongly defend what weve done... Nothing has been a failure... Everybody got opportunities for the right reasons; everybody got left out for the right reasons... If I may add, VRV Singh is as good a cricketer as Craig McDermott was when he first played for Australia... Or Merv Hughes... Or Carl Rackemaan... Nobody comes in and takes the world by storm.. If somebody does, he probably has a setback sooner rather than later... Please remember that the need to develop players never stops... A cricket team is never complete, its a work in progress. You can only go backwards if you stop looking at it that way. Indian cricket will be stronger by what happened in the last 21 months... Much of the critical comment came with an agenda and if you only look at wins and losses, youre missing half the story... No cricketer, after all, develops by sitting on the sidelines. 

On whether he expected the 34-year-old Sourav to make such a splendid comeback 

I hope he keeps improving... Even 17 months ago in Zimbabwe, he had three-fours years ahead of him but, at that point, wasnt in the right place mentally... He needed to go away and, then, come back stronger... Sourav has done that and though batsmen are at their peak from the age of 27 to 33-35, theres no reason why his career cant go on for some time... He will only stop improving if he stops striving... He has improved his batting, his fielding, his fitness... Ive never seen Sourav fitter... The manner of his comeback hasnt surprised me for I knew he had the ability. The question was whether he could... He had to do what he did, nobody else could have done it for him... Sourav does have a fantastic record and having somebody like him in the squad is wonderful for the balance. If we hadnt taken the decision (to drop him) when we did, I dont think he would have been back in time for the World Cup. 

On Sreesanth being more effective in Test cricket 

I dont know why the Media has got after him... Believe me, he can bowl in limited overs cricket, its just that his personality is probably more suited for Tests... Sree is developing... Hes only 24, but I would rather have somebody I have to pull back than somebody whom I have to keep pushing and motivating. The Media should leave him alone... Im not convinced he wont play an important role for us in the World Cup. He has come through in leaps and bounds and Ive been most pleased with his development as a person and a cricketer. Remember that hes an exceptional kid... For me, he has been a success story... Occasionally he has fallen over and weve had to pick him up and dust him, but more often than not he has met the teams high requirements. For him to take the occasional two steps back isnt a bad thing, for he has taken 10 forward... That he has coped so well shows character and resilience. Sree has the ability to visualise the future... Hed been dropped for the Champions Trophy because he needed to be dropped... He needed to learn lessons and he did... (After a pause) In India, the pressure on somebody who gets dropped is enormous. Cricket, in any case, is so tough on the mind... The one sport which comes close is golf... In India, a tough sport becomes tougher for the cricketer who gets dropped... An RP Singh, for example, is a good kid... He got dropped because hes going through the process of development and will emerge stronger... 

On his stand in selection committee meetings 

If you hide behind statistics, then youre going to make mistakes... That youve got to look beyond statistics... When a bowler is up for selection, look at the opportunities he creates, not just the wickets. Look at the talent. 

On whether Dravids leadership will make a difference in the World Cup 

Strong and creative leadership will be important... Teams which are led well are definitely going to do well... Hes learning all the time... By and large, Rahuls captaincy has been very good... Of course, there are times when captains run out of ideas...There have been days when weve sat down and he has admitted he could have done a better job, but like it is for batsmen and bowlers, captains also learn from mistakes... Flexibility with bowling changes and field placements will be important in the World Cup... I have no doubt that Rahuls leadership will serve us well... Like any captain, though, hes going to be limited by how his players perform... They could, on the odd day, let him down... I believe Rahul will have to lead by example in every manner. Not just him, every captain will have to be more creative and flexible than theyve ever been... The World Cup is going to demand that. 

On his 21 months as coach 

A coach, too, has limitations... It has been toughest for me... The coachs job in India is probably the biggest fish bowl of them all, but Im glad Ive had this experience... (After a pause) Given the amount of cricket, we may soon need separate teams and coaches for Tests and ODIs... Both need to get away from it all and reflect... To come back refreshed... A coach needs a break in order to say something different month after month... The calendar, as it is now, isnt allowing that... I doubt if Sachin could have played for 17-18 years if his career had started a year or two ago... The fast bowlers careers will be halved from ten years... Players will burn out at 27, not 35. This Indian team is playing around 30 per cent more cricket than most (top) teams... 

Finally, on whether he will continue with Team India after the World Cup 

I cant say... I know as much as you probably do... Right now, Im thinking about the World Cup.

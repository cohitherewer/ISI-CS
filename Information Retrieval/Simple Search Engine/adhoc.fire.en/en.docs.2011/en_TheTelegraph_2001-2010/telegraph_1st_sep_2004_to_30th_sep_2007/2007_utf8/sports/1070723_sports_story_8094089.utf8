 Mixed luck for Sania

Cincinnati: Sania Mirza went down fighting to world No. 8 and top seed Anna Chakvetadze in the singles semi final of the $ 175,000 Cincinnati Open here. 

The Indian star, seeded third, pushed her more fancied Russian opponent to the limit but lost the three setter 2-6, 7-5, 3-6 in the WTA Tier III event on Saturday. 

In the doubles, Sania and her American partner Betahnie Mattek, the top seeds, advanced to the final after pulling off a 2-6, 6-3, 10-3 win over Liga Dekmeijere of Latvian and Ipek Senoglu of Turkey in the semi-finals. 

In the final, the Indo-US team will meet Russian Alina Jidkova and Tatiana Poutchek of Belarus, who thrashed Japanese pair of Morigami and Aiko Nakamura 6-2 6-1. 

Sania, who played her fourth three-setter in as many matches, tried hard to keep herself in contention by pulling off the second set but Chakvetadze came back stronger to race out to a 4-0 lead in the decider and eventually sealing the matter. 

Making her first semi-final appearance here after quarter-final exits at the last two editions of the tournament, Sania confessed that she ran out of steam towards the end. 

She played a great match; shes a tricky player. After the second set, I was mentally drained after playing so many close points. I think my level dropped a bit and hers raised and when you are playing the top 10 you cant afford to do that, she said. (Pti)

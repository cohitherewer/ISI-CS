 Chowrasia sole 2nd

Kuala Lumpur: Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia paid due respect to the famed and tricky cobra course at the Saujana Golf and Country Club and reaped big dividends on the opening day of the Maybank Malaysian Open here on Thursday. 

Chowrasia carded a five-under 67 that placed him in sole second place and just one shot behind leader Robert Rock (66) at the $1.29 million championship, co-sanctioned by the Asian and European tours. While Chowrasia was second, Rahil Gangjee was tied 11th with his 70. Jeev Milkha Singh (71) was tied 21st, Gaurav Ghei (72) was tied 36th and Amandeep Johl (73) tied 49th. 

Indias other challengers were in a precarious position as Shiv Kapur (76) and Jyoti Randhawa (77) were tied 107th and 122nd, respectively. (PTI)

 Im hungry: Harbhajan

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Harbhajan 

London: Harbhajan Singh wouldve loved a Test comeback but, for now, has to be content with being selected in the Twenty20 squad. 

Of course, theres nothing like Test cricket... Being part of the squad which is currently in England wouldve been great, but... Harbhajan, who is turning out for Surrey, told The Telegraph. 

Speaking from Canterbury on Tuesday evening, ahead of a four-day match against Kent, he added: Its not that Im not happy (at being picked), but its for a Twenty20 competition... 

The offie has been out of favour after the World Cup. 

Theres plenty of big-ticket cricket in the 2007-08 season and Harbhajan is hopeful of being recalled not just for the Tests, but the ODIs. Im in good shape mentally and physically... Yeah, Im hungry, he said. 

Harbhajan, incidentally, is among those on the cover of the latest edition of the Surrey magazine, which has highlighted Turban Regeneration.

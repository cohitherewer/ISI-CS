The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 When soccer took a backseat

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: For six minutes, soccer took a backseat at the East Bengal ground on Friday. 

It all started 15 minutes into the second session, when Eastern Railway forward Obribai Benjamin elbowed East Bengal goalkeeper Abhra Mondal. 

As Abhra protested and got into an argument, Benjamin pushed him. East Bengal players rushed to the spot and a free-for-all ensued. The referee tried to cool tempers without success. 

Policemen had to rush in to separate the warring players. The excitement spread to the galleries and soon it rained bottles and planks, the target being referee Debashish Mishra. 

The two players were given marching orders, but it took a while for normalcy to be restored. The assistant referees found the sidelines insecure. It took appeals from Subrata Bhattacharya and Edmilson Marques to finally pacify the fans.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Legends meet likely this year

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: If he gets the right kind of sponsorship, Mahesh Bhupathi will invite some of the games greats for a legends tennis event in India sometime later this year. 

I am seriously looking for sponsors if I get one, Ill have the legends playing in our country this year, Bhupathi told The Telegraph during a personal visit to the city. 

The list of legends will depend on the kind of sponsorship he can raise. The possible venue could be New Delhi, one city Globosport hasnt had an event in so far, but that also is flexible. 

He informed newsmen that the proposed Calcutta branch of the Mahesh Bhupathi Tennis Academy could get functional in August 2008. 

On the controversy generated by Rohan Bopannas pullout from the David Cup tie against Uzbekistan to pursue his doubles goal, Bhupathi said: Ideally he should have played for the country, but since he got a direct doubles entry to the Delray Beach meet, he opted to go there. 

It will obviously be a tough tie for our team on indoor clay in Uzbekistan, what with three youngsters in the squad. But its also a good opportunity for them to get a feel of high-level competition, said the man who has announced he wont be playing for India any more. 

Bhupathis choice for singles is Rastogi and Somdev Dev Varman. In doubles, Leander (Paes) should play with Karan.

Bangalore: Qualifier Yurika Sema of Japan caused the first major upset by sidelining fifth seed Yuliana Fedak of Ukraine in the opening round of the Sony Ericsson International Bangalore Open tennis tournament which began here on Tuesday. 

The 237 ranked Japanese clinched the affair 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 to advance to the second round of the prize money $175,000 WTA event at the KSLTA Signature Kingfisher Tennis Centre. 

One of the 21 debutants in the main draw here, 20-year-old Sema dropped the first set to Fedak, who had lost in the quarter finals to the eventual winner Italian Mara Santangelo here last year. 

The action here started one day late due to a state-wide Cauvery bandh on Monday. Indias 18-year-old wild card entry Tara Iyer, ranked 550, lost in straight sets 0-6, 2-6 to Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia. 

Fourth seed Jelena Kostanic Tosic of Croatia struggled in first set of her first round match against wild card Sophie Ferguson of Australia. 

But Jelena, who was the runner-up here last year, came back with a full force winning 2-6, 6-1, 6-1 after firing on all cylinders in the next two sets. 

Seventh-seed veteran Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand had a facile victory over one of the qualifiers and debutants Chin-wei Chan of Chinese Taipei 6-3, 6-3. 

Other qualifier Nudnida Luangnam of Thailand lost to Yulia Beygelzimer of Ukraine 6-2, 6-1 while in an all-Ukrainian encounter, Olga Savchuk beat Mariya Koryttseva 6-4, 6-4. 

In the first doubles match of the tournament, Olga and Sunitha Rao of the United States ran out of luck failing to match the serves of Alberta Brianti of Italy and Mariya Koryttseva, who won 7-5, 6-4.

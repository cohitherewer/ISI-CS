 Abu Dhabi series now from May 18

Karachi: With organisers struggling to find sponsors, the planned three-match one-day cricket series between Pakistan and Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi has been rescheduled to May 18. 

The tournament, which was supposed to begin on May 9, will now take place from May 18-22. 

Though the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) maintains that the delay has been caused by Sri Lankas request for rest period after the World Cup, sources in the board say lack of sponsors has led to the postponement. 

The organisers expenses on staging the three match series is around $ 2.4 million while at the moment the money they are getting for sale of television rights, in stadium advertisements and title sponsorship is some two million dollars, a PCB source said. 

Sources said the Abu Dhabi Cricket Council (ADCC) was struggling to even cover the cost of hosting the hastily-arranged series for which they have not yet been able to get full sponsorship. 

Organisers had sold title sponsorship and in stadium rights for 1.2 million dollars but were still negotiating with some Pakistani channels for the sale of terrestrial and satellite television rights as no international broadcaster has shown interest in the series. 

The position is that the organisers will go ahead with the series even if they break even, the source added. 

Warid Telecom and Al-Falah Bank have reportedly offered to buy title sponsorship and stadium rights in a repackaged deal after the company, which was initially awarded the rights, defaulted on its first payment. (PTI)

 England 279/6 vs Canada

Gros Islet: Ed Joyce hit a half-century to help England tally 279 for six against Canada in their World Cup group C match on Sunday, but the action was overshadowed by Andrew Flintoff being dropped from the XI and stripped of vice-captaincy after a late night drinking binge. 

Joyce, who formerly played for Ireland and watched their victory over Pakistan on St Patricks Day on Saturday, enjoyed the luck of the Irish on his way to 66. The Dublin-born opener, who has struggled so far in the West Indies, was dropped by Desmond Chumney and wicketkeeper Ashish Bagai before completing his second ODI fifty. 

Joyce had shared an opening partnership of 101 with Michael Vaughan before the captain was caught at backward point by his opposite number John Davison off Abdool Samad for 45 in the 20th over.

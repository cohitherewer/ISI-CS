The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Relief for EB, Bagan

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The unwritten ban that restrained Mohun Bagan and East Bengal footballers from switching clubs during the transfer season for the past few years, has finally been lifted. 

Instead, in a meeting held in Bangalore on Wednesday, the two Calcutta majors, along with their common sponsor United Breweries (UB) and Mumbais Mahindra United, have decided to start paying transfer fee for taking each others players. 

From now on, all these three clubs will have to pay 25 per cent of the footballers existing salary as transfer fee to take each others players, said a club official. 

This is a major relief for Mohun Bagan and East Bengal as the sponsors of the two clubs earlier made a rule that both the clubs will have to pay Rs 10 lakh for signing any footballer from the other team. 

Bhaichung Bhutia, however, managed to exempt himself from this rule.

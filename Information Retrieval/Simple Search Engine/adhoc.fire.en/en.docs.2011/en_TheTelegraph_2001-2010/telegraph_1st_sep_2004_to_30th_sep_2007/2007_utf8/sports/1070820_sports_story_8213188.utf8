 Lin retains crown

Kuala Lumpur: China, with Lin Dan in the ascendancy, won three titles and Indonesia two as the world badminton championships drew to a noisy close on Sunday. 

A year ago in Madrid the Chinese had claimed four gold medals but this time round they missed out on the mens doubles after the defeat earlier in the week of defending champions Cai Yun and Fu Haifeng. 

On Sunday, Lin was at the peak of his powers to retain his mens singles crown, fifth seed Zhu Lin won the womens singles and Yang Wei and Zhang Jewen won an all-Chinese affair in womens doubles. 

China first got on the board when Zhu beat Hong Kongs sixth seeded Chen Wang 21-8, 21-12 in the womens event, avenging Wangs semi-final defeat of Chinese top seed Zhang Ning. 

Lin battled to beat Indonesian ninth seed Sony Dwi Kuncoro 21-11, 22-20 victory.

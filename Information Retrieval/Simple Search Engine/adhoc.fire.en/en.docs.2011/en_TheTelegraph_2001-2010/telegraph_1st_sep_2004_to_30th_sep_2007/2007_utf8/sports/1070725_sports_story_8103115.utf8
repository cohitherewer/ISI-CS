The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Lack of funds 

 behind postponement 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 AFRO-ASIAN GAMES

 New 

 Delhi: Financial constraints, in all probability, led 

 to the postponement of the second edition of the Afro-Asian 

 Games in Algeria. 

 Afro-Asian Games was first held 

 in Hyderabad in 2003. Algerian capital Algiers was supposed 

 to host the Games from Thursday but now has been postponed 

 indefinitely.

 According to the highly-placed 

 IOA sources, the organising committee in Algeria refused 

 to follow the manner in which the Games was held in India 

 and was not ready to pay the air fare of the athletes.

 In the Hyderabad Games, 

 we took care of everything, which covered major expenses, 

 said an IOA official. The Algerian Olympic Committee 

 perhaps doesnt have enough resources to bear these 

 expenses. We believe they didnt receive enough assistance 

 from their government also.

 Though the IOA president Suresh 

 Kalmadi has blamed the Algerian organisers for the postponement, 

 lack of interest on the part of the participating nations 

 could also be a major reason behind it.

 With the Beijing Olympics 

 to be held next year, most of the countries are not ready 

 to expose their top athletes in the Afro-Asian Games, 

 the sources said. Kalmadi, however, said that the Games 

 would be held later.

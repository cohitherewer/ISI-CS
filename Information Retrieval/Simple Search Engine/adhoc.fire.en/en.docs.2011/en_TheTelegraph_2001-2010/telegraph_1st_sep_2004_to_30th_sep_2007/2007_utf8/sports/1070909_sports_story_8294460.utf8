 Nisha holds Tania

Teheran: National womens champion and GM norm holder Tania Sachdev signed peace with compatriot WGM Nisha Mohota in the fifth round and slipped to joint third spot in the Asian womens chess championship here. 

On the recovery path after losing in the previous round, Tania missed some chances against Nisha in a long drawn game and eventually had to split point to take her tally to 3.5 along with Nisha. 

Chinese Huang Qian recorded the biggest upset of the tournament, defeating compatriot Lufei Ruan on the top board. Ngyen Thi Thanh An of Vietnam joined Qian in lead on four points after beating country mate Le Kieu Thein Kim. 

With four rounds still to go, Tania and Nisha share the third spot along with Ruan, Le Thanh Tu of Vietnam, Ju Wenjun of China and Atousa Pourkashiyan of Iran. 

Woman Grandmaster Aarthie Ramamswamy is in the next lot of three pointers, still in with a chance of making it among medal bracket. 

It turned out to be a better day for Indian girls as none of them lost. While Aarthie was held by Ghader Pour Shayesteh of Iran, Eesha Karavade too failed to break the ice and shared the point with another Iranian Navabi Shirin. 

WGM Swati Ghate scored a fine victory over Wang Ziaohui of China. 

Playing black, Swati, who had appeared out of sorts in the previous rounds, gave an emphatic performance. 

The other Indian winner was Amrutha Mokal, who had it easy against Salman Mahini Mona of Iran. 

Tania faced the Slav Defence from Nisha who played black. 

Banking on her recent preparation in the opening, Tania got a slightly better position in the middle game and even exchanges at regular intervals did not deter the Delhi-based girl from pressing hard. 

Nisha, on the other hand, was content with her position as she went for an endgame with equal chances. 

Tania tried to make headway after declining draw once, but a later error led to a perfect balance.

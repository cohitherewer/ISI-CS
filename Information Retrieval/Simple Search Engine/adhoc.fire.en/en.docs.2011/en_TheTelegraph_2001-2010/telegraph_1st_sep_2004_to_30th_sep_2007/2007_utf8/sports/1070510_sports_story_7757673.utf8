 Sujata takes Bengal to final

Rourkela: Bengal stormed into the final of the 15th Senior National Womens football championship by trouncing hosts Orissa 4-0 in the semi-final at the Ispat Stadium here on Wednesday. 

Despite their impressive run in the tournament so far having scored 49 goals in five matches and conceding just one, Orissa could hardly match Bengal who scored two goals in each half. 

Bengal were awarded a penalty which was converted by Rinku Ghosh in the 15th minute. Striker Sujata Kar then registered a hattrick with goals in the 30th, 59th and 79th minute. (PTI)

Calcutta: International Master Abdullah Al Rakib (Bangladesh) outwitted overnight leader IM Shanker Roy in the morning session and then went on to win a long endgame against Sk.Nasir Ahmed in the Round Six game to climb up the ladder with a narrow half point lead over five others, in the Alekhine Chess Club-organised Bengal Peerless FIDE-rating chess tournament at Gorky Sadan. 

At a time when the game was heading towards a draw, Al Rakib capitalised on an Ahmed error to settle the issue. Al Rakib had faced Scotch Opening from Ahmed. 

IM-elect Saptarshi Roy won his morning session against Shyam Nikhil and also held the advantage against Woman Grandmaster (WGM) Nisha Mohota in the next round. He squandered his advantage after he won a piece and had to settle for a draw against the local WGM. 

Showing his class, GM Ziaur Rahman (Bangladesh) overcame his countryman Abu Sufian Shakil in 42 moves after his draw in the morning session. 

IM S. Satyapragyan carved out a positional game to outwit his fellow IM R. Balasubramanium. Satyapragyan transferred his attack from the queenside to the kingside and won a piece and the game in 35 moves. 

Continuing his fine run, unfancied Venkat Sundaram to get the better of eight-seeded Vinoth Kumar. 

Meanwhile, Joydeep Dutta was penalised full point by the chief arbiter after his opponent objected to his mobile phone ringing in the playing venue. 

Owing to Mondays bandh call, there will be double rounds on Tuesday and Wednesday.

 Jeev stays 47th 

Crans Montana (Switzerland): Jeev Milkha Singh had three bogeys on the back nine in the third round of the Omega European Masters golf tournament on Saturday to stay in 47th place. 

Jeev shot a one-over 72 and was one-over 214 for three rounds. Compatriot Shiv Kapur was worse off with a five-over 76 that included seven bogeys and two birdies. He was 72nd of the 72 players who made the cut. He is now five-over for 54 holes. 

Jyoti Randhawa, who carded 75 and 77, missed the cut. 

Welshman Bradley Dredge was in sight of a second straight European Masters victory by moving into a share of the lead with Australias Brett Rumford. 

The duo finished on 13-under 200, a stroke better than the leader over the first two rounds, Oliver Wilson of England. Rumford shot a five-under 66, while Dredge had a 68. 

Rumford and Wilson stayed in contention despite both suffering sore necks. The Englishman was almost forced to pull out before starting his round after he had neck spasms. 

An hours treatment with a physio loosened the problem enough for him to be able to play but it was a battle all day as he posted a one-under 70. 

Triple European Tour winner Gonzalo Fernandez-Castaqo of Spain finished with an 11-under 202, after a 65 alongside another Welshman Sion Bebb, who shot a sensational eight-under 63, the low round of the week.

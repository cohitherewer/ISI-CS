 Its tough to get into our middle-order 

 - Ive had a lot of disappointments... I have to wait for my chance: Yuvraj 

 Yuvraj Singh 

Chelmsford: Yuvraj Singh, who last played in a Test more than a year ago, is reconciled to the fact that he would in all probability end up warming the bench during the three-Test series against England. 

Indias final Test at Kingston against the West Indies last year, which the team won to record its first series win in the Caribbean in 35 years, was the last time Yuvraj wore the India whites. 

A packed middle-order and injuries have kept the Punjab middle-order batsman out of the playing XI despite some strong performances in the one-dayers. 

And with the top six batsmen selecting themselves for the first Test, starting Thursday at Lords, Yuvraj admits that he has to wait for some more time to get a look in. 

In the last couple of years Ive had a lot of disappointments so this is probably just another one, Yuvraj said on Monday. 

You all know that our middle-order has been doing well, so its tough to get in there. I also know that guys who are in there ahead of me have played a lot of Test cricket and are much more experienced. So I just have to wait for my chance. 

The 25-year-old, who has played only in 19 Tests since making his debut in 2003, took solace from the fact that he was at least part of the Test squad whereas on his last visit he was forced to fly home after the one-dayers due to a finger injury. 

I am very optimistic about this series since this is the first time I am coming to England for the Tests. For the first time, I will be involved in a Test series in England, he said. 

Its the most important tour of my life. You never know when you tour England again. Whatever comes next for me whether its a Test match or a one-day game I am eagerly looking forward to it, Yuvraj said. 

Wasim Jaffer hasnt been among runs on this tour. But if there was any speculation about the Mumbaikar being made to sit out, it was dismissed when Yuvraj said performance in warm-up matches should not be taken seriously. 

You cant make any serious judgement out of side games. We came here from Ireland and tried to get into the groove. England is a top side we are hopeful that our batting will come good in the Tests, he said. 

For someone eagerly looking forward to break into a strong middle-order, Yuvraj admitted that he made a mistake by throwing his wicket after making 59 in the first innings against England Lions. 

When I went in there was a bit of pressure so I had to get a partnership going with Sachin, who was batting really well. I took my time to settle down, he said. 

But once I did that, I got out at the wrong time. I just got to learn from that and carry on. (PTI)

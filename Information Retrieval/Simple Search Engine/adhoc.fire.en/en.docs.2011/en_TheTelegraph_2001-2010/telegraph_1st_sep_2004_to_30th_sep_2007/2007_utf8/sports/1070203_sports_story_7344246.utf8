OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

New Delhi: The AITA president Yashwant Singh on Friday reacted strongly to Rohan Bopannas decision to pull out of the Davis Cup team. 

Enraged by Bopannas decision, Sinha said in a press release that national duties should be the primary concern for any tennis player than trying to raise his personal doubles rankings. 

Sinhas reaction came after Bopanna decided to play the ITF Futures tournament instead of the Davis Cup match against Uzbekistan. 

As per Mahesh Bhupathis decision not to play the tie, Sinha said it was taken after full consultation between AITA and the player. 

According to the official, the AITA decided that it would be better off having a team consisting of youngsters and three singles players in zonal matches.

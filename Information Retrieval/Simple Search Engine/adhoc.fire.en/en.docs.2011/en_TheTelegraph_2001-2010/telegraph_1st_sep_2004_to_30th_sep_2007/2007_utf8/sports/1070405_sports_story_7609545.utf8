 Greg didnt contribute to Indian cricket: Srikkanth

A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES

Greg Chappells decision not to continue as Team India coach evoked mixed response. Following are excerpts from what some former players and coaches had to say (alphabetically): 

AUNSHUMAN GAEKWAD: I was a bit surprised because Greg has been been saying that he is contracted until the end of the month and would arrive at a decision after the meeting with BCCI... Instead of indulging in mud-slinging, we should look ahead. I dont want the blame game to continue. We should aim to rectify our problems. I am not against foreign coaches, but would want an Indian to take charge at this hour. An Indian coach will know best about the boys abilities and shortcomings. He should be a man of integrity and confidence. 

MADANLAL: I would only say that I am very sad today The state of affairs in Indian cricket has been depressing. We are slipping down the ladder. We have to find ways to come out of this mess. I dont know who is best suited for the coachs role. May be the players views should be taken. They had ruled in favour of John Wright and when his term got over, they felt Greg Chappell was the best man for the job. 

KIRAN MORE: I think the main issue is getting diverted... I am surprised at his resignation, but I guess it was only to be expected. At the end of the day, performance is most important, but I feel the blame cannot totally be put on Chappell. 

K. SRIKKANTH: From what we can gather, it looks like Chappell was trying to dictate. It is unfortunate what we are hearing, that he was trying to divide the team. He will not be remembered in Indian cricket because he has not contributed anything. Wright will be remembered because he gave something to the team. Everything has slipped since Chappell took over It was his philosophy that you perform or perish. He has not performed and so has perished. He was a great cricketer and batsman, thats why he thought he had every right to do whatever he wanted.

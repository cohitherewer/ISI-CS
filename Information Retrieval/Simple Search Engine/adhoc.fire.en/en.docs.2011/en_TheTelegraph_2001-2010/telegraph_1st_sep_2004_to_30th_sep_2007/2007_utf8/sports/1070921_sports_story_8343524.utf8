The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its only tennis for Kirilenko

Calcutta: Maria Yuryevna Kirilenko. Ranked 35 in the world, she draws attention as much for her game as for her looks. 

A member of the Russian brigade which has taken the world by storm and a close friend of the other Maria (Sharapova), Kirilenko is the fourth seed at the ongoing Sunfeast Open. 

She is into the quarter finals, courtesy a pair of straight-set wins over Neha Uberoi and Ekaterina Ivanova. And, as she prepares for Fridays duel with Flavia Pennetta, Kirilenko says she is completely focused on her game. There is no life beyond tennis for her right now. 

I am still young and will think about life after tennis when my playing career is over. Not now, she says while answering a few queries from The Telegraph. 

Kirilenko is perhaps a trifle different from her breed in her love for classical music. And the ballet. 

Bach, Beethoven Vivaldi and Mozart are among her favourites. Does she get the time to listen to music now, given her hectic schedule on the Tour? 

Classical definitely, I also like listening to other music. But yes, I dont get the time to listen to it all as much as I would like to, given the time constraints. 

I used to dance ballet as a child. In fact, I had started dancing when I was five (and began playing tennis at the age of seven). No, there is no time to practise ballet anymore. But I do enjoying watching it, whenever I get the time. 

Cello is an instrument I love listening to. I am a great admirer of Mstislav Rostroprovich. It is a regret that I never actually did get to meet the great musician. 

Who are her idols? Kirilenko skirts the issue, saying, I have many from a wide range of area. 

Asked to talk about good friend Sharapova, Makiri as Kirilenko is popularly called says: Ive known her since we were 13 years old. We have much in common. 

For the record, both the Marias are 20 years old. 

Kirilenko, who looked stunning in a sari that she donned on Thursday, closely follows fashion and always likes to wear the latest styles. No wonder, then, she is ranked No. 4 on the ACE tennis magazines Hot List of the worlds sexiest players. 

Kirilenko has been selected as the face of Adidas by the Stella McCartney tennis range. How does it feel to be both talented and glamorous? 

It was an honour to be chosen to wear Stella McCartney. The clothes are attractive, stylish and comfortable. 

However, adds the young Russian firmly, though it is nice to know that people find me attractive, I would rather be known for my tennis than my looks.

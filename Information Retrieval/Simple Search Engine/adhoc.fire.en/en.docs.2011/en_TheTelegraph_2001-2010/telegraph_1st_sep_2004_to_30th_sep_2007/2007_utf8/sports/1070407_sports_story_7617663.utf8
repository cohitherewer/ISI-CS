 Captains recommendations

 THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN

The Board of Control for Cricket in Indias (BCCIs) meeting in Mumbai on Friday was attended by the following former captains: Chandu Borde, Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, Srinivas Venkatraghavan, Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, Ravi Shastri, Krishnamachari Srikkanth.

Their recommendations are as follows: 

1. Strengthening of domestic cricket, particularly the participation of international cricketers in major domestic tournaments. The international calendar should be adjusted to ensure that at least six to eight weeks in a year are available for domestic cricket. The BCCI should try their level best to amend the FTP in the general interest of Indian cricket. 

2. Improving the quality of wickets in domestic cricket. The BCCI must ensure that the matches are played on sporting and lively wickets, which are prepared under the supervision of members of the Pitch Committee. The venues for important matches of the senior tournaments should be allotted by the BCCI instead of the existing home and away rotation policy. 

3. The Ranji Trophy Elite Group should be reduced to 10 teams from the existing 15 and the matches should be played on a round robin league basis to improve the quality and competitiveness of domestic cricket. 

4. The structure of our junior cricket, which is the best in the world, should be supported by providing good wickets and umpires. 

5. India A tours should be undertaken on a regular basis to Australia/New Zealand/South Africa/West Indies. The tour may be organised ahead of the senior teams tour to that country. 

6. Selectors should be appointed on a full time basis on payment. Eligibility should be decided for appointment of both junior and senior selectors. Greater care should be taken in the appointment of selectors for the junior selection committee. 

7. The Indian team must have a pool of at least 30 cricketers who should be rotated, so that a cricketer does not play more than 80 days of international cricket. 

8. The National Cricket Academy must be supported by starting zonal cricket academies in each zone till all the state units set up their Indoor State Academy. 

9. Players endorsements: The players must take Board permission before entering into an endorsement contract. 

A copy of the endorsement contract should be submitted to the BCCI to ensure that there is no clause therein related to performance-based incentives. 

Limit the number of endorsements of a player. 

Not more than two to three players must endorse a product other than the BCCI sponsor. 

10. A cricket committee may be constituted from among the captains to advise on cricketing matters and the committee should meet every quarter.

Earlier on Friday, the BCCI released the following press note:

 Greg Chappell made a detailed presentation on his experiences with the Indian team for last 23 months. As a coach, he too felt that he was partly responsible for the poor performance. He pointed out the shortcomings and suggested measures to improve Indian cricket. He emphasised the need to promote youngsters and concentrate on fitness and strength for the team to do well in fielding and running between wickets.

 Sharad Pawar complimented Chappell on his role as the coach of the Indian team and his professional approach.

 Pawar was of the opinion that Chappell could be associated with Indian cricket and help in the implementation of the long term plans although he is no more the coach of the Indian team.

 In his report Chappell confined himself to issues and did not make any reference to individual players.

 Sanjay Jagdale, in his report, explained the performance of the team in the tournament and was of the opinion that the entire team, particularly our batsmen failed in the matches against Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. He too was of the opinion that the youngsters should be inducted to improve our cricket.

 Rahul Dravid told the committee that his team left for the World Cup with high hopes but failed to do well. Rahul accepted responsibility on behalf of the team for the poor performance which led to early exit from World Cup. He offered suggestions for the im- provement of Indian cricket.

 Dilip Vengsarkar felt that the team did not perform to potential. He was of the opinion that we should strengthen our domestic cricket and that have a pool of 25-30 cricketers from which the Indian team could be selected.

 PM: Losing 2014 bid was unfortunate

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Saturday expressed his disappointment for Indias failed bid to host the 2014 Asian Games, but said things would improve in near future. 

Speaking during the inauguration of Olympic Bhawan here, the Prime Minister said: It is unfortunate that Delhi has missed an opportunity. I am sure there will be many more opportunities like that in future. 

Stressing on the need to make sports and games a compulsory part of the educational syllabus in schools and colleges, he said: Countries that stand out in the world of sports are the ones that have in fact made them an integral part of their educational curricula. 

To improve the sporting standard in the country, the Prime Minister felt the Indian Olympic Association should work more closely with the Government, both at the centre and in the state. Greater attention is needed for athletics and gymnastics, apart from the team sport like cricket, hockey and football. 

The Olympic movement should be seen as advancement of the cause of healthy living, he said. India, he said, was yet to fully harness the talent of its youth. 

After IOA president Suresh Kalmadi said Indian shooters are facing problems in getting enough ammunitions for their practice sessions, Prime Minister assured he would do his best to look into these problems. 

Many of these demands are for financial assistance, said the Prime Minister. I cannot make any commitment. I assure to look into it.

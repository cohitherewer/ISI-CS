The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I wasnt tired, says Zaheer

 - Team India Pace spearhead contradicts captains claims 

 Zaheer Khan 

London/New Delhi: Indian skipper Rahul Dravid, already under attack for his timidity in not enforcing the follow-on against England in the third Test at the Oval, has more embarrassment on Wednesday, when Zaheer Khan contradicted his explanation that the reason for his decision was that bowlers were tired. 

Zaheer, who took 18 wickets to emerge as the man-of-the-series, said in London: As far as I am concerned, I have given my everything to this series. I dont think I was tired or anything on the fourth day... Not really. 

Zaheers disclosure is bound to strengthen the criticism that the Indian captain had not enforced the follow-on despite a 319-run lead over England because he wanted to play absolutely safe, an argument that flies in the face of any cricketing logic. 

After choosing to bat a second time, India got a fright when reduced to 11 for 3 before Dravid took 96 balls to make a laborious 12 runs while Sourav Ganguly hit an excellent 57 to put the team beyond danger. 

A stubborn Dravid has stood by his decision, arguing that he knew his bowlers well and that they were tired which has now been dismissed by Zaheer. 

In fact, Zaheer had bowled 22 overs in Englands first innings, taking 3 for 32, with R. P. Singh bowling 18 overs, Sreesanth 21 and Kumble 29.1 a total of 103.1 overs. In comparison, Englands four main bowlers Ryan Sidebottom (32 overs), James Anderson (40), Chris Tremlett (40) and Monty Panesar (45) bowled 170 overs. 

Prompted by Zaheers comment, former India captain Gundappa Viswanath said: I was very disappointed when the Indians chose not to enforce it (follow-on)... I dont buy this theory about the bowlers being tired, after all they are professional players. 

Also it was the last two days of the series, wouldnt that have been incentive enough for the bowlers to go all out one more time? And if it was a case of not wanting to bat last, surely they would not have had to bat for more than a hour or so... I am afraid no excuse is good enough for me. 

I understand that such decision are usually taken based on the consensus reached by the senior members of the team but in this case, they got it all wrong, he said. 

Another ex-captain Ravi Shastri also said that Dravid should have enforced the follow-on. 

Dravid did not opt for it which cricketwise might have been up to question but in terms of a nation starved of overseas wins made sense. Between two goods Dravid went for the better one. 

The fact that none of the party had experienced an overseas win as big as this has to be taken into account. On the other hand a few of the same in the past would have made the entire unit look at it in a different light. 

Follow-on, going for the kill, giving a knock-out punch or even a kick in the ribs when you have someone on the mat would have been a foregone conclusion, Shastri added. 

Meanwhile, former skipper Krishnamachari Srikkanth, also could not see any logic in Dravid not enforcing the follow-on. 

Perhaps Dravid wanted to play it too safe. His priority was to win the series, he said. If I was the skipper I would have gone for the kill because England could not have won the from that situation. They could not have taken a big lead to put any pressure on India, he added. (PTI)

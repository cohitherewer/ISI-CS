 It was murder, insists pathologist

Kingston: The Jamaican police might have closed the Bob Woolmer chapter, concluding the death as natural, but Indian born pathologist Dr Ere Seshaiah, whose autopsy report formed an important part in the police launching a murder probe, stands by his medical examination. 

I am sticking to my findings. He was murdered, Seshaiah was quoted as saying by a Jamaica newspaper. I am confident he was murdered. Woolmer is not a first for me, I have been doing autopsies here since 1995. 

Declaring Woolmers death as natural, after pursuing it as murder for almost three months, Jamaican Constabulary Force (JCF) commissioner Lucius Thomas on Tuesday said three foreign pathologists and toxicology tests had ruled out any foul play in the death of the Pakistani coach on March 18. 

The JCF accepts these findings and has now closed its investigation into the death of Bob Woolmer, Thomas told a news conference. 

Deputy commissioner Mark Shields, the high-profile British police veteran who headed the investigation, defended himself against accusations that the probe had been botched. 

He also said he would not resign in the wake of the wrong judgement by the police. If anybody should ask me why I should resign, I would ask why. We did a thorough investigation. We could not guess and we had to keep an open mind, Shields told a news conference in Kingston. 

I love my job and I love working in this country. I am looking forward to the next two years of my contract. We are not pathologists and if we had not sought other opinions we would have also been criticised, Shields said.

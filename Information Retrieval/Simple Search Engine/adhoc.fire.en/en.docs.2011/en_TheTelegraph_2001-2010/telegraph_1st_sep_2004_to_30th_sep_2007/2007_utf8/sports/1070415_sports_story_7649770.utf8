 Run-rate was at back of my mind: Ponting

Bridgetown: Australia captain Ricky Ponting said his side had got all they wanted out of Fridays one-sided victory over debutants Ireland which booked their place in the World Cup semi-finals. 

Ponting had commented before the game that he was considering using the Super Eight match to give some of his lesser-used players some time at the crease and with the ball in hand, but said a desire to maintain a high run-rate had been his aim. 

The Australia captain won the toss and fielded, his side bowling the Irish out for just 91 before knocking of the total inside 13 overs. 

We wanted to look after our run-rate in this game if we could. The best way to be in control of that is to bowl first and hopefully get teams out cheaply and then the runs quickly, said Ponting. 

That was in the back of my mind in the morning but I hadnt mentioned it to the guys during the week because I didnt want us going into the game taking things a bit lightly that was the main reason I bowled this (Friday) morning, he said. 

We bowled really well with the new ball and used the bounce that was there. Weve got what we wanted out of this game, I dont think we really needed anyone to have a glorified net session as such. Our top-order batting has been good throughout the tournament. 

I said before that I wanted Hussey and Symonds to get some time in the middle, but we didnt really think we would bowl them out for 90. I thought they might have got 150 or something like that and so those guys would have had more time out there. But everything is on track, we are going well. 

Ponting said that the Irish may have been overawed by coming up against the world champions. 

I think the Irish boys would have been a little bit nervous about playing against Australia, probably playing against some people who they have sat back and watched on television over the years. 

It can become a bit daunting in that situation but when you have got McGrath and Tait bowling at their best on a new wicket with the new ball, it is always going to be difficult that could have happened to any team today, that we knocked the top order over, he said. 

Ponting defended the Irish from the view that their dismal display had devalued the competition. 

They won their way here and did what they had to do to get to this stage and won more games than other teams. Sure, India and Pakistan might have put up more of a fight, more of a game, but they had their chance to be here and werent good enough, he said.

Manchester United have said England striker Wayne Rooney is likely to be out for two months after suffering a hairline fracture in his left foot. The forward is likely to miss Englands next four Euro 2008 qualifiers after suffering the injury in Sundays Premier League opener at home to Reading. 

After taking on Germany in a friendly next week, England face qualifiers at home to Israel and Russia on September 8 and 12 and the following month meet Estonia at home and Russia away on October 13 and 17. 

The incident occurred near the end of the first half of the 0-0 draw at Old Trafford when Rooney hit a low cross from Michael Carrick just over the crossbar. In attempting to make a tackle, Michael Duberry accidentally trod on Rooneys foot. 

It was clear instantly Rooney, 21, had a problem, as he went down and removed his boot. Although he was able to continue briefly, he did not reappear for the second half, with Ferguson sending him for a scan. 

Although the United manager expressed the hope the damage would not be too bad, his worst fears now appear to have been confirmed. 

Certainly, he will miss Uniteds forthcoming Premier League matches against Portsmouth, Manchester City and Tottenham this month and games against Sunderland, Everton, Chelsea and Birmingham in September. 

With Rooney out and both Louis Saha and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer only returning to training after long-term injuries last week, Ferguson seems certain to hand Carlos Tevez his debut at Fratton Park on Wednesday.

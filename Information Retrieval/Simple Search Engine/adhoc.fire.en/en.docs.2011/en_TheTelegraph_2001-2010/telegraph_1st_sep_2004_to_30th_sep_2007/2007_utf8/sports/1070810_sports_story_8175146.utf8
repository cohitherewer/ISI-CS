 Howell howler fails to ruin Team Indias day

 - Sourav gets another poor decision; Karthik emerges Day I hero

London: Privately, the Indians have reservations over Steve Bucknor. At the Brit Oval on Thursday, though, Ian Howells howler left everybody save Michael Vaughan and his men aghast. 

If England do make a miraculous recovery, then Sourav Gangulys dismissal given out leg-before despite his bat making contact with the Duke ball is bound to be a turning point. 

For Sourav, it was the second poor decision in three innings. At Trent Bridge, the damage had been caused by Simon Taufel. As Sourav walked off, after a solid 37 (India 276 for four), his wry smile didnt leave anything unsaid. 

The umpire-inflicted blow notwithstanding, India ended Day I of the third and final npower Test on an authoritative 316 for four. Rahul Dravid and Co. remain on course to claim the series. 

At the wicket are Sachin Tendulkar, playing another dour knock, and V.V.S. Laxman the newest entrant in the 5,000 club. The second new ball, by the way, is still quite fresh. 

Sachin did get a life on 20 (dropped by the unimpressive Matt Prior off Ryan Sidebottom), but stood rooted when the England bowlers targeted his rib cage. 

Clearly, Sachin has shown character and the longer he stays, the lesser Englands chances of forcing a win and drawing the series. 

Coach Peter Moores, however, is hopeful. Weve got four days left... Thats a lot of cricket... 

Dravid did India (and himself) a big favour by winning the toss yet again. The openers, Wasim Jaffer and Dinesh Karthik, continued the good work by putting together another 50-plus partnership. 

They collaborated 62, before Jaffer fell to a smart piece of captaincy from the usually shrewd Vaughan. Dravid and Karthik added 127 for the second-wicket, with the captain finally getting a fifty. 

Dravid went to a swinging beauty from James Anderson on 189 and, with the classy Karthik getting a small nick on the threshold of what wouldve been his second Test century, ten runs later, England appeared to have clawed back. 

Strangely, till the fourth hour, the ball had done little. An unexpected cloud cover, though, made the cherry do quite a bit. Its then that Dravid and Karthik returned to the pavilion. 

Karthiks departure for 91 (218 minutes, 151 balls, 10x4, 1x6) brought the golden oldies Sachin and Sourav together. Another wicket and Indias advantage wouldve withered. 

They held firm and would surely have seen through the day. But, then, Howell came into play. 

Easily the days hero, Karthiks band of supporters keeps swelling and his outstanding innings came just a day after former England captain David Gower picked him as one of the five batsmen to watch out for. 

He began slowly but, once settled, didnt let go of scoring opportunities. Particularly pleasing was the inside-out six off Monty Panesar. 

Karthiks a busy opener... Hes positive and likes to get on with the job... He doesnt allow himself to get bogged down and thats one quality I admire, quot; former England captain (and opener) Graham Gooch told The Telegraph. 

A wonderful compliment that. 

As for Karthik, he said: I think I batted very well... Im happy at the way I consolidated, but Im definitely disappointed at the way I got out... It was at the wrong time... 

Given the way hes been batting, that second century should come sooner rather than later.

KARTHIKSPEAK

Ive opened up my stance and tried to get my left shoulder to face the bowler... Thats the slight adjustment Ive made (in England)... Im very happy with the way things have gone... Once you get set on these wickets then you can play your shots... Ive been doing that...Tomorrow (Friday), the first hour is going to be very crucial...The (second) new ball has been taken and there are two very experienced batsmen in the middle... If they get a start, then any total is gettable... At the moment, theres no figure in mind...

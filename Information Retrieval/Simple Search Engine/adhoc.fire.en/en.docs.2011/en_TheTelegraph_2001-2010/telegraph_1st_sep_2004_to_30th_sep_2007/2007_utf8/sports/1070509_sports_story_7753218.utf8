 Boxer in fatal crash

London: Former WBC and WBO lightweight champion Diego Corrales has died after a motorcycle accident, US media reported on Tuesday. 

The 29-year-old American, who also won a world title at super-featherweight, was reported to have collided with a car at high speed 10 miles west of Las Vegas late on Monday. 

His gruelling victory over Jose Luis Castillo in 2005, in which he was knocked down twice before gaining a 10th-round stoppage, was voted by The Boxing Writers Association of America as the fight of the year. (REUTERS)

 Present WI batsmen lacking in technique, says Taylor

Melbourne: Former Australian captain Mark Taylor believes the current Caribbean cricket crop has technical flaws which are keeping them behind in modern cricket. 

Taylor said the West Indian batsmen have also forgotten that legends like Sir Viv Richards were more than just dynamic stroke players. 

In the time they have slipped from No.1 I believe players coming through to replace that great era lacked technical proficiency. 

A lot of the batsmen who emerged had the same attitude as the great Viv Richards, Desmond Haynes, Gordon Greengages and Clive Lloyds, but they did not have the basic technique to go with it, Taylor was quoted in an Australian daily. 

The West Indians are currently ranked eighth among the ten major Test-playing nations, above Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. 

Taylor recalled the fifth Test in Adelaide in 1989, when Richards batted throughout the last day and remained 68 not out to draw it finally. The West Indians ultimately win the series 3-1. 

Not enough young West Indian players witnessed innings like that. They just saw Viv, the master blaster take the bowling by the scruff of the neck from the word go and score 100 from 80 balls. 

He could smash an attack, but at other times he used his excellent technique to make it difficult to get him out, he said. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Curtains for Indians

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Indian hopes at the ONGC-ITF Juniors were over on Friday when second seed Prajnesh Gunneswaran and wild card Yuki Bhambri were outplayed by their opponents in the boys singles semi-finals at DKS Sports Complex. 

While a lower-seeded (7) Jeong-Han Seo stunned second seed Gunneswaran 6-0, 6-4, Kittiphong Wachiramanowong of Thailand proved Yukis nemesis, beating him 6-2, 6-4. 

In the girls singles summit clash, Nanuli Pipiya of Russia will face Nadia Lalami of Morrocco. 

Meanwhile, Ukraine duo Yulia Golborodko and Anastasia Vaslyeva clinched the girls doubles title.

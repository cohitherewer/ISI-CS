Calcutta: Sunil Gavaskar, on Thursday, felt for Eden Gardens, the crowd and the city. 

The Little Master had said that he would never play at the Eden after he and his wife were pelted with oranges following his failures in the Eighties, but at the GD Birla Sabhagar he chose to bury the past. Subsequently, he didnt play the Test against Pakistan in 1987. Had he done so, that would have been his last Test appearance at the Eden. 

At the Calcutta Sports Journalists Clubs golden jubilee awards function, the former India skipper was presented a Lifetime Achievement award for his contribution to the game. Bollywood star Mithun Chakraborty handed over the award besides a citation, a plaque and a trophy, mementos, a caricature and, of course, the traditional doi, mishti. 

Referring to the unsavoury incident, Gavaskar said: The hurt was only temporary. Only people who are close to you, feel for you. As you go on in life, you realise that they hurt you because they felt for you Today when I look back, I understand that the crowds gesture was only spontaneous, not deliberate and they were quite well-meaning. 

In fact, he went on to say that the Eden is one of the three best venues in the world. He also thanked the city for giving his son Rohan a career in cricket. 

Among those present at the well-attended function, of which TVS was the principal sponsor, were Chuni Goswami, Gurbux Singh, Arun Lal, Sambaran Banerjee, Subrato Bhattacharjee, CAB president Prasun Mukherjee and IFA secretary Subrata Dutta. 

A pair of gloves worn by Sachin Tendulkar during the Multan Test (2004), was auctioned by Mithun Chakraborty in the first half of the function. It fetched Rs 1.11 lakh which will be donated to the ailing Fifa referee, Pradip Nag (also a journalist) .

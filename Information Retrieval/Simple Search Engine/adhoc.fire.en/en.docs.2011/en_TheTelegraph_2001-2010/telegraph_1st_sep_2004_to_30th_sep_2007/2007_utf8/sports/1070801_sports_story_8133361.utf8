 Englands jelly beans strategy turns sour

 - Such things always come back and bite you... Stay away from them: Gooch 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Nottingham: If at all, the only consolation for England is that Indias winning runs at Trent Bridge, on Tuesday, came via byes. 

That wont figure in Englands post-mortem of the second npower Test, but there are bound to be questions over who gave the bright idea that Zaheer Khan be greeted with jelly beans on Day III. 

Given the way it backfired, the author is unlikely to own up, even though captain Michael Vaughan insisted England didnt lose (by seven wickets) because of the jelly beans. 

The reality, of course, is that an insulted Zaheer bowled like a man possessed in the second innings and his smart aggression pushed England behind in the three-Test series. 

[For those who swear by statistics, England havent lost a home series for six years, the last defeat was in the 2001 Ashes.] 

Really, England couldnt have thought of a more childish strategy to try and unsettle the Indian spearhead, who walked away with his second MoM award in three Tests. 

You know, such things always come back and bite you... So, stay away from them, a

 less than amused former England captain, Graham Gooch, told The

 Telegraph. 

Vaughan has apologised for offending Zaheer, but Team India captain Rahul Dravid seems to have enjoyed the episode. 

Dravid didnt, by the way, enjoy James Andersons bouncers on the final morning. They didnt even shake hands after the Test and appeared to have an exchange of sorts. 

If the jelly beans upset Zaheer and inspired him, then please upset him that way in every match... Get him all fired up... I wont mind that! he remarked. 

Well, there will be more champagne-baths in the dressing room then. 

To talk of the other captain, Vaughan has to take the rap for that fiasco. In fact, when he was heading for the post-match ceremony, there were boos from a section of Trent Bridge. 

For different reasons, umpire Simon Taufel got booed as well. 

Peeved that he had to take questions on jelly beans, Vaughan said: It has all been blown up as its a great story for you guys... There were a couple on the floor... I guess one of the players must have left them by the crease as a prank... If we offended him (Zaheer), we apologise... 

Moving away from jelly beans, Dravid saluted his team for the superb win the second big one overseas within eight months (last being at the Wanderers). 

Weve been improving overseas in the past few years... When we go abroad, the expectations from us are little and, so, anything achieved is (seen as) great... 

Winning the toss was important, but so was the 147-run opening partnership (between Wasim Jaffer and Dinesh Karthik) on the second day... Then, Zaheers bowling throughout... R.P.Singh also picked up crucial wickets in both innings... 

Dravid added: Sreesanth is young and very excitable... But all he has to do is look at Zaheer at the other end... Look at his controlled aggression...Zaheers a great example... 

The Indians, incidentally, made heavy weather of getting the remaining 63 runs. Indeed, in registering victory No.5 in England (in the 200th Test overseas), they lost three wickets. 

The third and final Test, at The Oval, begins on August 9. 

Footnote: According to Vaughan, hed raised Sreesanths behaviour during a one-on-one with Dravid before play began. The Indian captain declined to comment. Vaughan also pointed out that theyd accepted Sreesanths explanation (an accident)

 for the beamer at Kevin Pietersen.

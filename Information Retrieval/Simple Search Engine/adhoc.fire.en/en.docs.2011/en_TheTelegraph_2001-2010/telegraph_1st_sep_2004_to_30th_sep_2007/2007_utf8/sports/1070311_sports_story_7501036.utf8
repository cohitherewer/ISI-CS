 It was a tale of two pitches: Arthur

St Augustine: A sell-out crowd was an important factor in the decision to continue the World Cup warm-up match between Pakistan and South Africa in St Augustine on Friday, rival coaches Bob Woolmer and Mickey Arthur said. 

Play was interrupted for seven minutes after the South Africans, put in to bat, expressed concern over what they considered was an unfit pitch. 

Play resumed after umpires Peter Parker and Ian Gould decided the pitch was not dangerous. South Africa were dismissed for 199. Loots Bosman was top-scorer with 53, while Ashwell Prince contributed 35. 

Pakistan replied with 200 for three in 44.3 overs to win by seven wickets. Younis Khan was their chief architect with 79. Mohammed Hafeez (49) and Mohammed Yousuf (48 ..) also chipped in. 

It was a tale of two pitches. When we batted it was wet and difficult, but later it dried up and became easier, Arthur said. 

In the end, consideration for a bumper crowd carried the most weight. 

You couldnt just cancel it, it was a sold-out game and there would have been repercussions down the line if it was called off, Arthur said. 

Woolmer concurred with Arthur that the crowds interests received top priority. 

There was concern, because five balls really took off and a few went along the ground, he said. 

But there were over 3,500 people in the ground and we felt we had a duty to continue with the game.

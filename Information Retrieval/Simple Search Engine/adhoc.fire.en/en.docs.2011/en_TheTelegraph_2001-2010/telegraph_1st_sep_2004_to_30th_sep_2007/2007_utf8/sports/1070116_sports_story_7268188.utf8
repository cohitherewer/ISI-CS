The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Two for key posts in RCTC 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: Two advisors Lt. Gen (rted.) J. R. Mukherjee, ex-chief of staff (Eastern Command, HQ) and A. Kapur are set to join RCTC. Their appointments follow recent resignations at the top after the financial mismanagement was exposed in these columns last July.

 Mukherjee will be advising stewards on the club matters, while Kapur is to head the finance department, said an RCTC insider. The two executives may be promoted as the CEO and CFO if they manage to turn around the financially-sick club, added the source.

 Deadly De Villiers leaves Windies devastated

Simon Briggs in St Georges

 South Africas unheralded opener, AB de Villiers, produced one of the most bizarre innings in World Cup history Tuesday. Struggling so badly with cramp and heat exhaustion that he could hardly stand, De Villiers struck a stunning 146 from 129 balls to usher the West Indies towards the exit door. 

De Villiers was in total command, both of the bowling and his own body, as he reached his maiden one-day International century. But no sooner had he jumped up and punched the air (as universal a celebration these days as a simple bat-wave used to be) than his right leg locked up on him. From then on, he moved with all the fluidity of the Tin Man. The extraordinary thing was that he proceeded to spank another 46 runs from just 16 balls. 

You might imagine the West Indies would have fancied their chances against a man batting on one leg. But they were in that hangdog, defeatist mode that so infuriates their supporters. They bowled without thought and fielded without any sense of national or even regional pride. 

Jacques Kallis, so often a killjoy at No. 3, soon pricked the West Indian bubble with a flourishing assault on Dwayne Bravos first over. As he drove handsomely over extra cover for six, you could sense his lingering fury at all the flak he has taken since the Australia game. Though he twisted his ankle moments later, restricting his movements and taking the edge off his attacking verve, Kallis still made 81 from 86 balls before missing a booming drive. 

Finally granted a pitch with a bit of pace and bounce in it, South Africa were like a team reborn. The stodgy, sluggish surface in Georgetown had gradually drained their batting line-up of momentum, to the point where Bangladeshs spinners could reduce them to virtual strokelessness. 

But at Grenadas National Stadium you could swing through the line with confidence and that is exactly what they did. 

De Villiers, in particular, was unrecognisable from the man who tried to late cut a ball off his middle stump on Saturday. He pulled and drove with abandon in a 170-run stand with Kallis. Further spectacular hitting from Herschelle Gibbs and Mark Boucher whose 22-ball half-century was the third-fastest in World Cup history set the West Indies an improbable target of 357. 

South Africas return to form should blow away the various internal squabbles that afflicted the squad during their two-week stay in Guyana. Georgetown is a picturesque backwater, ill-suited to a bunch of international sportsmen on tour, and these players were all too happy to leave. 

If World Cup tradition is observed, South Africa could yet become the late-breaking side who turn around their fortunes just in time to mount a charge for the title. The West Indies, meanwhile, seem destined to lurch through further crises before the tournament is done. 

And though it is still mathematically possible for them to reach the semi-finals, given wins in their two remaining games against Bangladesh and England, the permutations are so freakish and unlikely that they might as well be discounted right now.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sehwag, Harbhajan set to be recalled

 - Zaheer may be rested for ICC World Twenty20 meet; Change unlikely in ODI squad 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Zaheer Khan 

Calcutta: Unless theres a rethink over Sreesanth, the national selectors are tipped to retain the XV which did duty in the four ODIs (winning three) in Ireland for the seven-match series against England. 

If theres some uncertainty, its over the XV for the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 meet in South Africa. 

Look, the selection for the ODIs should be a smooth affair I dont think therell be any change, unless Sreesanths attitude becomes the subject of a debate The Twenty20 could be a very different cup of tea, one of the five selectors told The Telegraph on Saturday. 

Except for chairman Dilip Vengsarkar, who is on tour with Team India, the other four Venkatapathi Raju, Bhupinder Singh (Sr), Sanjay Jagdale and Ranjib Biswal are to assemble in Mumbai on Tuesday afternoon. 

A tele-conference is planned with Vengsarkar and the Test and ODI captain, Rahul Dravid, at the London end. 

As first reported in these columns (July 8), Mahendra Singh Dhoni is set to lead India in the Twenty20 meet. As for the vice-captain, its either going to be Yuvraj Singh or Dinesh Karthik. 

According to the selector, its possible that the in-form Zaheer Khan will be rested. 

Significantly, the Big Three Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly arent in the picture as they made themselves unavailable before the probables were picked last month. 

Weve got to be careful After a long tour of England, Zaheer is bound to need some rest If he goes to South Africa as well, then he wont have time to recover before the home (ODI) series versus Australia We cant afford to over-bowl him, the selector said. 

Eventually, Zaheer may get the option to decide himself. 

While the tour of England ends on September 8, Indias opening Twenty20 engagement (against Scotland) is a mere five days later. 

Whats more or less confirmed is that Virender Sehwag and Harbhajan Singh are about to be recalled. Mohammed Kaif (leading India A in Africa at the moment), one learns, has an outside chance. 

Suresh Raina wouldve been a certainty, but theres no official word yet on where he stands after surgery on his left knee. 

Raina, however, is going to turn out for Air India in a Bangalore tournament. His teams first match begins on Monday. 

Manoj Tiwary, though, hasnt fully recovered from shoulder surgery. Hes unlikely to make it. 

Two rookies have emerged dark horses. One is Irfan Pathans elder brother Yusuf (a right-hand batsman and off-spinner) and teenaged mediumpacer Yo Mahesh. 

THE SQUADS 

ODIs in England (likely): Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid (capt.), Yuvraj Singh, Gautam Gambhir, Robin Uthappa, Rohit Sharma; Dinesh Karthik, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (vice-capt.); Ramesh Powar, Piyush Chawla; Ajit Agarkar, Zaheer Khan, Rudra Pratap Singh, Sreesanth.

 Roddicks time is coming, says coach Connors

 - American refuses to accept DVD of his match after losing to Andreev 

JULIET MACUR in PARIS

 Andy Roddick with Igor Andreev after losing to the Russian on Tuesday 

To figure out how Andy Roddick was faring in his first-round match Tuesday at the French Open, spectators did not have to see the score. 

Roddick, seeded third, had a temper tantrum during his match against Igor Andreev. He mumbled to himself, shook his fists and bounced his racket off the red clay. He looked to the heavens and shouted, Andy, just give yourself a chance on some of these points! 

For everyone in earshot, it was obvious: Roddick was about to lose early at the French Open, once again. For the second year in a row, and for the fourth time in his career, Roddick lost in the first round. 

This time at Roland Garros, where he and players from the United States in general seem to be cursed, Roddick lost to the 125th-ranked Andreev, 6-3, 4-6, 3-6, 4-6. 

Roddick was one of eight United States men who lost on Tuesday in the worst American showing at the French Open in decades. Even Robby Ginepri, the last American hope, went out on Wednesday. 

For years, the clay courts of Roland Garros have perplexed American players. It remained that way Tuesday, when the eighth-seeded James Blake lost to Ivo Karlovic, 4-6, 6-4, 7-5, 7-5. The unseeded Americans stumbled, too. 

Blake, with his Yankees cap pulled low, said he and his countrymen had drawn tough opponents. I promise we wont have all eight guys losing the first round at Wimbledon, he said. 

If, or when, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal who advanced without much sweat meet in the final, Roddick will be watching from the sideline, wondering what went wrong. He had hoped to win at least two matches here, especially with his coach, Jimmy Connors, leading the way. 

After Roddicks loss, Connors said that he had one or two pointers for him, but that he would not have suggested much more. 

A loss is never any good. But the good thing is, from my standpoint, I can understand, said Connors, who won eight Grand Slam tournament singles titles but, like Pete Sampras and John McEnroe, never won the French Open. I can understand, because I had some tough times here myself. 

His times coming, Connors said of Roddick. When asked if he meant next year at the French Open or the year after, he clarified, saying, Hes got his grasses coming up, in reference to Wimbledon and other grass-court matches. 

Roddick, whose big serve makes him more of a threat on hardcourts and grass, has won consecutive matches at Roland Garros only once, in 2001. But he often shines at the other majors. He is a two-time Wimbledon finalist and the winner of the 2003 United States Open. 

That did not intimidate Andreev. He said he knew he would beat Roddick, even though Roddick is ranked 122 places higher than he is. 

Roddick, he is a great player, but still maybe not on the clay court, Andreev said, still enjoying his coup. 

Russell, who lost to Federer, had been hoping to be in Andreevs place in his David-versus-Goliath match. He knew his chances were slim. 

Several days before the tournament, he was eating lunch in the cafeteria at Roland Garros when a fellow player gave him the bad news about his opponent for the first round. It happened to be one of the best players in history. 

He said, Dont look at the draw, Russell recalled. 

The 29-year-old Russell, who has advanced past the first round of a Grand Slam event only once in 12 tries, said he did not panic. He simply thought of the 2001 French Open. 

That year, he qualified for the tournament, then upset player after player. In the fourth round, he found himself facing Gustavo Kuerten, who was No. 1 at the time. And in a near miracle, he came one point from winning before Kuerten took over. 

Kuerten went on to win his third French Open, but the memories remained with Russell. That one moment gave him hope that underdogs can surprise even the best players, however tiny the chance the way Andreev surprised Roddick. 

Theres always an awe factor playing a top player, but in the end, you always figure out they are still human beings, Russell said, adding that he was impressed Tuesday with Federers aggressiveness and ability to put spin on the ball. 

Sometimes players are not lucky, like Roddick, Blake or the other Americans who exited early. 

When a tournament employee handed Roddick a DVD of his match, he immediately handed it back. 

No, thanks, he said, shaking his head. Dont ever want to see that again.

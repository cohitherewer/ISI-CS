 Boycott blames ICC for sledging

TIMES ONLINE 

Geoffrey Boycott, the former England captain, has blamed the International Cricket Council (ICC) for the ugly confrontations which have marred the second Test at Trent Bridge. 

England and India players have been seen to verbally abuse each other at regular intervals over the first four days of the current contest, while seamer Sreesanth has been fined for barging Michael Vaughan at the non-strikers end on Monday. 

The same bowler was also accused of running through the crease bowling from far over the popping crease at Paul Collingwood and bowled a beamer at Kevin Pietersen, while Zaheer Khan accused England players of dropping jellybeans on the wicket when he was batting on Sunday. 

The incidents have reopened the debate over what levels of gamesmanship are acceptable in cricket, and Boycott believes the ICC should have set out clear guidelines for officials before matters came to a head. 

The ICC is to blame for not telling umpires to be much firmer with the players, Boycott said. 

They are the guardians of the game, they run it. You bowl a beamer, it can slip out of your hands, he said sorry and I accept that. You can be cynical and say he meant it but I dont accept that. 

What I dont accept is when he runs a yard through the crease, thats deliberate, and the umpire should have got hold of the captain straightaway and said Im not having it, if he does it again hes off, hes not bowling again.

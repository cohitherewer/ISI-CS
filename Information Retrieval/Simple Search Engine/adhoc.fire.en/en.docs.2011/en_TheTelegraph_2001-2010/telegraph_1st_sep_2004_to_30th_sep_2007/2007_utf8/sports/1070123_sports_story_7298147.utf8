The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Basudeb praised

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: No loss, but just a point gain for each team. Maybe that was the reason why coaches Subhas Bhowmick and S. Krishnaji Rao had no reason to be disappointed, but few reasons to be delighted too. 

If it was Basudeb Mondals sparkling show in his first outing for Mohammedan Sporting that pleased Bhowmick, Rao was glad to have logged one point in an away match. 

Playing after a gap of three months, Basu (Basudeb) really lived up to my expectations I am especially happy that he could sustain the entire 90 minutes. Also, he came close to scoring a couple of times. I think he will do well in times to come, Bhowmick said in the post-match press conference. 

Reiterating the need for strikers, Bhowmick said: Our team has too many juniors. Im not saying they are not playing well but they cant take the pressure. However, Im not complaining also. 

Bhowmick stressed that he is very happy with his job and has no plans to move. 

Reacting to their goalless draw, Rao said three points would have been very welcome, especially when neither team had any foreign strikers. But we did not lose either. We are happy to have got a point in an away tie.

 Different view points on the death

 Jamaican police remain convinced Pakistans coach was murdered by manual strangulation. The autopsy found a broken bone in the 18-stone Britons neck but no marks on his throat. 

 Some suspect poisoning could behind the death. One tip-off reportedly received by police suggested Woolmer was given aconite, which causes asphyxiation. 

 There is also growing speculation that Woolmer, who suffered from type 2 diabetes, could have died from natural causes, perhaps suffering a seizure in his hotel room. 

 Others believe the death was accidental. According to some reports, Woolmer, had been drinking heavily and could have fatally injured himself in a fall.

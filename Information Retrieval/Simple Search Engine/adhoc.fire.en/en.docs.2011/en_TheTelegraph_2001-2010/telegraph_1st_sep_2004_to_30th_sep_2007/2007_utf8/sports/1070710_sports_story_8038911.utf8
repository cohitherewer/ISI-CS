 Sydney: An Australian weightlifter and a powerlifter have been banned for two years for doping offences, officials said on Monday, less than a month after weightlifting coach Sevdalin Marinov received a life ban.

 Weightlifter Deborah Groves and powerlifter Damien Thompson had accepted the two-year sanctions, the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) said.

 Groves failed to comply with an official request to provide a sample during an out-of-competition test in Sydney on March 7.

 Powerlifter Thompson was suspended for possession and use of a prohibited substance bought over the internet.

 Iraq stun Australia 

Bangkok: Iraq pulled off a stunning 3-1 upset win over Australia at the Asian Cup on Friday to leave the tournament favourites in danger of an embarrassing early exit. 

Nashat Akram scored from a free-kick in the first half after a terrible mistake from goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer and Hawar Mulla Mohammad and Karrar Jassim Mohammad capitalised on further defensive errors to find the net after the interval. 

The Socceroos briefly drew level when their captain Mark Viduka scored just after halftime, but were otherwise outplayed by a team who had to train and play qualifiers in neutral Jordan because of the war in their homeland. 

Japan got firmly back on course with a convincing 3-1 victory over United Arab Emirates on Friday. Takahara (22, 27) and Shunsuke Nakamura (41) scored for Japan, who rebounded from a disappointing 1-1 draw with Qatar in their opening match to go top of Group B on goal difference above Vietnam.

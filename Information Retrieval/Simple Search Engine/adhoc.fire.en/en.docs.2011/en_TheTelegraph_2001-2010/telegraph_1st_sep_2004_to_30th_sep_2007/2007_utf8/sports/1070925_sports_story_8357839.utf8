 Bonanza for Indian cricketers

Johannesburg: There was windfall for the Indian cricket team after lifting the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 trophy beating arch-rivals Pakistan in the finals on Monday. 

The BCCI president Sharad Pawar, who was present on the occasion, declared an award of $2 million after Mahendra Singh Dhonis boys clinched the nail-biting encounter by five runs. 

Another Rs 1 crore prize money was announced for Yuvraj Singh for emerging as the first batsman to hit six sixes in an over in the shorter version of the game.

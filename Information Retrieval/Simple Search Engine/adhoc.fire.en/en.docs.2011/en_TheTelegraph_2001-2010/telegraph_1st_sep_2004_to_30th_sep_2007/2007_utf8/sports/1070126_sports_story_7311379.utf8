The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 250 will be challenging: Raghu

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Though Deep Dasgupta put up a brave front when asked about Bengals chances, Karnataka are hoping to set a target of around 250. Around 250 would be a challenging target for them on this track, Karnataka allrounder Chandrasekhar Raghu, who remained unbeaten on 78, said after the days play at the Eden on Thursday. 

After drawing blank on Wednesday, Bengal bowlers opted for a leg-side line on Thursday to frustrate the Karnataka batsmen. But Raghu took it calmly. 

Yes I got a bit frustrated but I never try to do fancy things, Raghu stated. Karnataka coach Venkatesh Prasad sounded pretty confident. 

The match is evenly poised but everything depends on the first few hours on Friday, Prasad said, ruing Thilak Naidus dismissal. Thilak is one of the most prolific run-getters for us.

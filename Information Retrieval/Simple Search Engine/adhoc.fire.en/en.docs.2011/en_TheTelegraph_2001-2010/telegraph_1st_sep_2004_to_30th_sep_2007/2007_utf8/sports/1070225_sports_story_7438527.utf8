 Interpol help for Cup hosts 

Kingston: Interpol will provide Caribbean hosts of the World Cup with direct access to its database of stolen documents. 

Interpols MIND/FIND technology will allow law enforcement officers at airports and seaports to instantly check passports against a database that contains information on more than 13 million stolen and lost travel documents from more than 120 countries. 

This is the first event where countries will have the system at every checkpoint, Interpol secretary general Ronald Noble said during a one-day visit to Jamaica on Friday. 

Noble said the Canadian government helped set up the database in the nine Caribbean host countries. 

Interpol, based in Lyon, France, began using the database in Switzerland in late 2005. 

The 16-nation tournament starts on March 13, hosted by Antigua, Barbados, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, St Lucia, St Kitts, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago.

 New policy raps IOA 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The war of words between Union sports minister Mani Shankar Aiyer and Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president Suresh Kalmadi once again came to the fore on Thursday when the Centre released the draft of the new sports policy. 

Ridiculing the IOA efforts to host mega events like Asian Games and Formula One race, the policy said these would only generate short-term benefits for the country. 

The policy also pointed out that hosting of events like Afro-Asian Games, Commonwealth Youth Games, Commonwealth Games and World Military Games would not help develop the standard of sports in India unless there was an urge to adopt long-term programmes. 

The policy took a dig at the Athletics Federation of India (AFI), of which Kalmadi is also the president, saying it should eradicate doping in athletics. 

High priority must be accorded to capping, reversing and eventually ending the scourge of doping in Indian athletics and other sports, the policy said.

 Pakistan to probe Shoaib, Asif bust-up in Benoni

Johannesburg: Pakistans ICC World Twenty20 management is investigating a bust-up between fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif. 

There has been an incident between Shoaib and Asif and the team management is carrying out an investigation, media manager Ehsan Malik said on Thursday. 

The result will be known on Friday morning. 

A team source said that during a heated argument between the two players in the nets at their camp in Benoni, Shoaib had struck Asif on his thigh with a bat. 

It developed into a serious altercation and got out of control before the captain, manager and coach intervened, said the source, who declined to be identified. 

Pakistan, who arrived in Johannesburg from Nairobi on Thursday after winning a four-nation tournament, are in group D alongside India and Scotland. 

Shoaib, meanwhile, has described the doping scandal that engulfed him last year as the worst time of his life and hit out at the disciplinary committee that initially found him guilty. 

A PCB disciplinary committee banned Shoaib for two years and Asif for one year. The ban was overturned on appeal, however, as the committee had used the World Anti-Doping Agency Code (Wada) regulations instead of PCBs own anti-doping policy, which allows for ignorance of the law to be used as a defence. 

The 32-year-old also strongly criticised rules changes in the game. 

Cricket should be about fast bowlers, not batsmen. The charm has gone down in cricket because you dont have fast bowlers running in and bowling at 90mph anymore, he said. 

The spectators like to see fast bowlers running in, hurting people, and pitches that make batsmen struggle for runs. But nowadays we play on good batting tracks all the time; theyve made laws about bouncers and now theres the free hit rule for a no-ball. (Reuters)

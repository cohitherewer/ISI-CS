 Lee hattrick in Aussie victory

Cape Town: Brett Lee claimed the first international Twenty20 hattrick to help restrict Bangladesh to 123 for eight before Matthew Hayden powered Australia to a nine-wicket victory in their ICC World Twenty20 group F match on Sunday. 

Lee tore the middle order apart in the 17th over once Bangladesh had been sent in to bat. He had Shakib-al Hasan caught by Adam Gilchrist for 16, bowled Mashrafe Mortaza and then trapped Alok Kapali leg before for first ball noughts. 

Hayden, who finished unbeaten on 73 from just 48 balls with nine fours and three sixes, added 104 with Adam Gilchrist to confirm a thunderous victory at Newlands with 37 balls to spare. 

Known for their big hitting skills, the opening pair of Hayden and Gilchrist plundered the rival bowlers all over the park. Gilchrist made a 28-ball 43, studded with a boundary and four sixes, before being run out in the 12th over. 

Captain Ricky Ponting (6 not out) joined Hayden to see the world champions home without any further damage. 

Nathan Bracken and Stuart Clark had earlier frustrated the normally free-scoring Bangladeshi batsmen with some clever and disciplined bowling as the world champions continued their surge back to form after a shock first-match loss to Zimbabwe.

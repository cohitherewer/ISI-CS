 Jeev, Jyoti to tee off in Hamburg

Hamburg: Jeev Milkha Singh, who missed the cut in a major for the first time in five starts, will hope to make up for that as he tees up for the Deutsche Bank Players Championship of Europe. 

At the Gut Kaden Golf Club in Hamburg, Jeev will have for company his fellow Indians, Jyoti Randhawa and Shiv Kapur, who had a much-needed break last week. 

Joining the trio for the first time in Europe this season will be Gaurav Ghei, who has got himself a special spot. Interestingly, it was Kapur who got a special spot last year, but since he has a full card this year, Ghei also gets a chance to test European conditions. 

Jyoti though waited on tenterhooks till Thursday, as he was first reserve for the British open. He however did not get a chance.Jeev has been given a star pairing with the charismatic Miguel Angel Jimenez and Paul Mcginley, while Randhawa goes out with Simon Khan and Peter Hanson. (PTI)

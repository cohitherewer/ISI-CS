 Ireland not overawed by Windies

Kingston: Irelands historic place in the World Cup second round is assured, but wicketkeeper Niall Brien cant wait to pit his wits against the West Indies skipper Brian Lara in Fridays match in group D. 

Both sides have already guaranteed their Super Eight slots, but the winner in the Sabina Park clash will have the advantage of taking an extra two points into the next stage with them. 

For feisty keeper Brien, who has just signed for Northants in the English county championship, thats incentive enough to lock horns once again with superstar Lara. Back in 2004 the two men had a vociferous fall-out in a one-dayer at Stormont in northern Ireland when the teams shared a two-match series. 

Irelands Australian-born captain Trent Johnston, who hit the winning six against Pakistan, said his team will not be overawed by the West Indies, the world champions in 1975 and 1979. Well take on the West Indies with confidence and give a good performance, said Johnston. We will give it 100 per cent and be very competitive. 

The West Indies coach Bennett King disclosed that they may consider changing their winning line-up. He feels it is essential to give playing time to a couple more players ahead of the tough Super Eight stage.

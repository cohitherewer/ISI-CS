The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sharad Pawar may wait, provided...

 - International Cricket Councils top job 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sharad Pawar

Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket

 in India (BCCI) president, Sharad Pawar, doesnt seem averse to reaching an understanding with David Morgan provided the England amp; Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chairman agrees to an Asian as the chief executive once Australian Malcolm Speeds

 contract ends next year. 

Pawar and Morgan are locked in a battle over the biggest off-the-field prize full-time president of the International Cricket Council (ICC). The term of the acting president, Ray Mali, gets over in June 2008. 

A stalemate exists as neither has the support of seven of the 10 Test-playing nations. Thats a mandatory requirement. While Pawar is stuck on six, Morgan has the backing of just four. 

Besides the Asian nations, Pawar is being supported by South Africa and Zimbabwe. Australia, New Zealand and the West Indies are backing Morgan. 

According to The Telegraphs sources in London,

 Pawar and Morgan should definitely have a one-on-one by Wednesday morning. 

Mr Pawar probably wont mind waiting for two years as he will then be the president when the subcontinent hosts the World Cup (2011)... Morgan, however, has to agree on an Asian succeeding Speed, explained one of the sources. 

He added: In fact, the four co-hosts of the next World Cup can only benefit if Pawar is the ICC president in the lead-up to and during that event... But, then, the Speed-issue has to be addressed. 

 David Morgan

Clearly, Asias Big Four arent in a mood to accept a Morgan-Speed partnership. 

If an arrangement is worked out, then Morgan is going to be elected vice-president later this week. That post will go to Pawar once the Englishman moves into the presidents chair. 

As first reported in these columns, if an understanding cant be reached between the two, then the option of the toss is very much there. 

Meanwhile, its not confirmed, but one learns that the chief executives (who met on Sunday-Monday) have approved the cricket committees recommendation for a free hit in ODIs on the delivery after a foot-fault no ball. 

Also, it appears theyve okayed the proposal for a third fielder to be moved out of the circle during the second or third power-play. The limit, right now, is two. 

The final say, though, rests with the ICCs executive board. The cricket committee is headed by Sunil Gavaskar.

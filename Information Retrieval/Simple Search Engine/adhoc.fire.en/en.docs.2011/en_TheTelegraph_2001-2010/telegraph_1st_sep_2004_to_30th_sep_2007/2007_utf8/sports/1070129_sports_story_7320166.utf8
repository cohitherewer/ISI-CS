 Moody opts out of race

Sydney: Sri Lanka coach Tom Moody has withdrawn from the race to succeed John Buchanan as Australias next coach, leaving Tim Nielsen as the likely candidate. 

Moody, a former Australia Test and one-day International player, was interviewed by Cricket Australia (CA) but told them he was not interested in the position. 

I just felt the timing wasnt right, Moody told an Australian newspaper. 

I had to think long and hard about it but from a personal point of view it wasnt right and I wanted to let CA know as soon as possible. 

Moody, 41, has also been mentioned as a possible successor to England coach Duncan Fletcher should he step down after the World Cup, but the Australian said his only concern was with Sri Lanka. 

Sri Lanka is my main focus and this had started to become a bit of a distraction to myself and the team, which is the last thing it needs in the countdown to the World Cup, he said. 

It was a bit unfair on the team and my employers because my focus at the moment has to be on preparing the side for the World Cup. 

However, Moody did leave the door wide open for a change after the world cup. 

Lets just see what unfolds over the coming months, he said. I wouldnt discount any opportunity.

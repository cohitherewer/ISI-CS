 Someone has to miss out and be unlucky

NILESH BHATTACHARYA

Chittagong: Team India have a problem of plenty in the batting department going into Fridays first Test against Bangladesh. 

As the sun played hide-and-seek throughout the day, causing occasional drizzles, uncertainty appeared to grip the Indian thinktank who to leave out, who to pick as sole specialist opener Wasim Jaffers partner. 

Any problem is as confusing as its creation. The only thing Dravid could reveal on the eve of the match is that there will be a bit of surprise. 

Its never easy to drop anyone, especially when someone is playing well. But in this case, we have to... its a part and parcel of the game. You have to take these decisions keeping in mind what is the best combination under the circumstance and what will help you win the game. All of them are good batsmen and so someone has to miss out and be unlucky, Dravid said. 

We have discussed what we want to do and what we want to achieve, but are yet to arrive at a decision, he added, after morning nets session at the stadium. Dravid and cricket manager Ravi Shastri had a late night meeting with other members of the support staff, but couldnt decide on the playing combination. 

It was learnt that Yuvraj Singh and Rudra Pratap Singh have been left out of the XV, with the playing XI to be finalised on Friday morning. What is more or less confirmed is that India will go in with five bowlers, taking into account the bald nature of the pitch. 

Munaf Patel has looked out of sorts at nets and is expected to undergo a fitness test before the match. If he fails to make the cut, Rajesh Pawar is likely to make his debut. 

Dinesh Karthik, who has been in exceptional form in ODIs as a specialist batsman, could launch the innings with Jaffer. 

It remains to be seen if V.V.S. Laxman is sacrificed as part of Dravids surprise package. If the Hyderabad batsman misses out, Mahendra Singh Dhoni will make the cut. 

Experience, stats and stars make India look really imposing, especially in the longer version of the game. Bangladeshs record in Tests is an appalling 39 losses and a solitary win in 44 appearances. Against India, they have lost all three Tests. 

We have done reasonably well in ODIs over the past few years, but our Test record needs improvement, said Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar. Its a challenge for everybody in the team and we must get ready for a new start, he said at a press conference. 

Fit-again vice-captain Mohammed Ashraful is a welcome boost for the hosts. Allrounder Shakib-al Hasan is set to become the 46th Bangladeshi to wear the Test cap. 

Interestingly, the hosts may include a trio of left-arm spinners Mohammed Rafique, Enamul Haque (Jr) and Shakib a ploy that has worked well for them in recent ODIs. 

Over four months have elapsed since Dravid amp; Co. last played a Test, in South Africa. In case of Bangladesh, that gap is 13 months --- when they lost 0-2 to Australia. 

Since then, of course, Bangladesh crushed Indias World Cup dream in Port of Spain two months ago. The Greg Chappell era has ended and Team India is in search of a new direction. 

Dravid quashed the suggestion that the 2-0 victory in the ODI series was a thing of the past. What we have done in the past has no relevance to this new challenge. Its now 0-0 and we have to take fresh guard, the Team India captain remarked. 

A winning start is always welcome. But it defends on how you perform on a given day. You can have a wealth of experience, but it will be of no use unless you perform when it matters, he remarked, obviously reminding his teammates of the World Cup debacle.

 Ferrari erupt in fury

Milan: Italy joined Ferrari on Friday in condemning the decision not to punish McLaren for the spying controversy which has gripped Formula One. 

The FIA said on Thursday that although the championship leaders had Ferrari data in their possession, there was insufficient evidence that they had gained from it. 

However, the world governing body warned after the Paris hearing that the Mercedes-powered team could still be kicked out of this and next years championship if fresh proof emerged. 

If someone is guilty they must have a punishment, instead here there is nothing, Ferrari boss Jean Todt said. It is a decision strongly prejudical for the credibility of this sport. (Reuters)

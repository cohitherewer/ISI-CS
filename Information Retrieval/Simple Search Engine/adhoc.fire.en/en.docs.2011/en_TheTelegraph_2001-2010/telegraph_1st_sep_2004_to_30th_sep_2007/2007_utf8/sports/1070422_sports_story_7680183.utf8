 Gordons Lara wish

Port of Spain: West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) president Ken Gordon has said that he would have preferred Brian Lara to tour England before hanging up his boots. 

If you ask me personally, I would have liked to have seen him stay on for the English tour, Gordon was quoted as saying in a newspaper here. But you have to take other peoples views into account and clearly his mind was running in a different direction, he said. 

Lara stunned the world on Wednesday when he announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket at the end of the England match. .

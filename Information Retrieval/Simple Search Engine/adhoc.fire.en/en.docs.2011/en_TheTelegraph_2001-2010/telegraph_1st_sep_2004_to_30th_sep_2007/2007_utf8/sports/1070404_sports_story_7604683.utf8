Calcutta: Bengal kicked off their campaign in the National (East Zone) Twenty20 meet with a 35-run win over Assam at Eden Gardens on Tuesday. In reply to Bengals 169 for nine, Assam could muster only 134 for eight. 

In the absence of Deep Dasgupta, who was down with an injury to his left knee, Manoj Tewari was asked to lead the side. Opting to bat first, the Ranji Trophy runners-up made a promising start, though losing Subhajit Paul for nought. Tewari top-scored with 36 while Avishek Jhunjhunwala made 32. Rohan Gavaskar (26) and Wriddhiman Saha (25) were other notable contributors for the winners. 

It was not easy for the Bengal batsmen with Laxmi Ratan Shukla (7) and Sourashish Lahiri (10) failing, but the experience and application helped them reach 169. In reply, Assam never looked confident of chasing the target.

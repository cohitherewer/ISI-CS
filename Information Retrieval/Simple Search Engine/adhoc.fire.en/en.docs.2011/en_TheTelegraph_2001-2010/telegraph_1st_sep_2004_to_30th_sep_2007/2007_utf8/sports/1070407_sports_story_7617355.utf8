 Paks focus on religion blamed for debacle 

 Inzamam-ul Haq 

Karachi: Pakistans media manager at the World Cup told an inquiry committee on Friday that there had been more focus on religion than cricket in the team. 

The performance evaluation committee including three former Test players and administrators has been constituted by the Pakistan Cricket Board to look into their first-round exit from the World Cup. 

I told the committee that the players were not focussed on cricket in the World Cup. They were more into religion, Pervez Mir, a former Pakistan player said. 

Mir said he was disturbed to see focus on cricket missing in the team in such an important tournament. I told the committee that Pakistani players, rather than pray privately, tried to make it a public spectacle, he said. 

Mir said he had told the committee of incidents to highlight his point and added that some players, led by captain Inzamam-ul Haq, even made it a point to pray in the galley of aircrafts on flights rather than privately in their seats. 

Inzamam, who stepped down as captain and retired from one-day Internationals after the World Cup, had been criticised for using the team platform for religious activities. 

Pakistans late coach Bob Woolmer had also complained to the board that he found it frustrating to see the players taking part in religious activities after matches when he wanted to discuss cricket with them. A member of the committee, which has to give its report in 30 days, said Mirs statement was disturbing. 

Saleem Altaf, a senior board official too, said the committee would also be calling former chairmen of the board Tauqir Zia and Shaharyar Khan next week. (Reuters)

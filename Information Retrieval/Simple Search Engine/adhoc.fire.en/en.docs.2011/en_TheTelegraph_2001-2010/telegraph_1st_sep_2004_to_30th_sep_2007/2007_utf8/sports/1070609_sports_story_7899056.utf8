 Beckham still the key man: Gerrard 

Henry Winter 

Steven Gerrard, Englands vice-captain, voiced the renewed belief in the camp on Thursday night by predicting the team would go to Russia and win on October 17, that David Beckham was playing well enough to be a force at Euro 2008, and that players support for Steve McClaren has been unwavering during a storm-tossed season. 

That Russia away game will be one of those England versus Turkey, England vs Germany away games where we need to pull a big, big performance out of the bag, said Gerrard, the driving force of an improving England side now within a point of Russia and three of Israel and Croatia in group E following victory in Estonia. 

I am confident we can go to Moscow and win we have definitely got the character and ability. If we can finish this group really strongly, winning our four games at Wembley, and getting a big, big performance in Russia, people will say we have turned the corner. 

The confidence is back. Theres an excitement and buzz about playing at Wembley you saw that against Brazil. Without sounding too cocky, we can get four wins out of four at Wembley. All three qualifying rivals, and Estonia, have to come to London. 

Rising optimism has been quickened by Beckhams recall. We want Becks at Euro 2008, insisted Gerrard. I am sure if he keeps playing at the level he is now, whichever club he is at, Real Madrid or LA Galaxy, I dont see why he cant be at Euro 2008. He has proved over these last two games he can go to Euro 2008. 

Beckham, meanwhile, has been warned of the potentially career-threatening health risks he will run as a result of his commute from Los Angeles next season. He faces frequent long-haul flights if he continues to play for England while with LA Galaxy. 

According to an aviation health expert, it puts him in the high risk category for getting deep-vein thrombosis.

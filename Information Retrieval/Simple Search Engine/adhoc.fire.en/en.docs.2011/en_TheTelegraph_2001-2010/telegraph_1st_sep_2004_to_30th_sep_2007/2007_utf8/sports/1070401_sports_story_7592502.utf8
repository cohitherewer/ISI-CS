 SHARP SINGLE 

 Flintoff asks mates to buck up 

Georgetown: Having returned to form with four wickets and a valuable 43 against Ireland, Andrew Flintoff is now urging his teammates to collectively lift their games. Weve got some talent there with the players weve got in our ranks and I dont think many of us are playing to our full potential, Flintoff said. In this World Cup its all about peaking at the right time. 

Weve won a few games, got on a roll and weve got Sri Lanka in the next game which is going to be tough it would be nice if we could kick on from here. 

Sri Lanka have some fine players in their side and were going to have to up it that little bit more if we want to get over the line against them, Flintoff said. 

No no-balls

St Johns: New Zealand coach John Bracewell believes his attack is starting to reap the rewards of working with bowling guru Dayle Hadlee (brother or legendary Sir Rishard) as they aim to reduce the extras count at the World Cup. During the game against the West Indies , the Black Caps sent down just three wides and not a single no-ball. This was a marked improvement on the 24 no-balls delivered in their three previous games.

Music please

St Johns: World Cup organisers have urged Caribbean fans to bring their musical instruments into the stadiums to lure in local support and give the tournament more of a calypso feel. Passionate West Indies fans have been upset by high prices and the impression that big musical instruments had been banned from venues on safety grounds.

There is a protocol to allow musical items, ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said in a statement. We want the Caribbean atmosphere to be here. We dont seek to take the West Indian flavour out of it. We want to hear that noise. We want to hear that enthusiasm. 

WIPAs call

Port of Spain: After back to back defeats in the Super Eight, the West Indies Players Association (WIPA) has urged the fans to extend wholehearted support to the hosts in their bid to book a berth in the semi-finals. The West Indies have some key matches coming up in Guyana, Grenada and Barbados and I would like to see a full house at all those games as in Jamaica. The crowd will be a vital 12th man for our team, Dinanath Ramnarine, WIPA president, said.

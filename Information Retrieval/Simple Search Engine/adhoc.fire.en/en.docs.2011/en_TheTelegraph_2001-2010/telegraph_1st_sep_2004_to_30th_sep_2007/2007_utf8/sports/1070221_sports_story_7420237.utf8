Hamilton: Australian batsman Matthew Hayden broke the big toe of his right foot during his record-breaking innings against New Zealand in Hamilton on Tuesday. 

The injury could seriously affect his preparation for the World Cup in the Caribbean next month. While he is likely to be fit in time for the World Cup, the usual three- to four-week time frame for the healing of a toe fracture might leave him unable to leave Australia with the squad or take part in their two warm-up games. 

On Tuesday, Hayden batted through the entire innings to score an unbeaten 181, breaking Mark Waughs record of 173 for the highest score by an Australian in an ODI. 

Hayden batted with the aid of a runner after being struck on the foot with a yorker by New Zealand fast bowler Mark Gillespie while on 102. 

Im really disappointed, but the good news is weve got a bit of time, and time is the only thing that heals bone, Hayden said after the conclusion to the match. 

Its been a pretty frustrating day. I must admit when I got hit on the toe I knew it was broken, it just felt ordinary. I couldnt put any weight on it at all. 

The left-handed opener was taken to hospital at the change of innings where X-rays confirmed the break. 

An X-ray of Matthew Haydens right foot has shown a fracture in his big toe, Australian physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said in a statement. He will see a specialist in Brisbane tomorrow at which point his medical management will be outlined including his return to play.

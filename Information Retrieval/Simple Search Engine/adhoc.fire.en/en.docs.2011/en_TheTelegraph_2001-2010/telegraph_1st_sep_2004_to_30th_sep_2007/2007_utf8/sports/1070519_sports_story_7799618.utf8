 Essien proves his worth in defence

Matt Hughes 

 Michael Essien 

John Terry on Thursday paid tribute to Michael Essien as an awesome centre half who picked up the position after five minutes on the training pitch. The Ghanaian is likely to partner Terry at the back against Manchester United because Ricardo Carvalho has been ruled out with a knee injury and Jos Mourinho lacks confidence in Khalid Boulahrouz, the Holland defender. 

Terrys views are clearly shared by his teammates because Essien was this week named as the clubs Player-of-the Year, an award that had much to do with his versatility. 

Although occasionally used as an attacking right back by Mourinho when Chelsea are chasing matches, the 24-year-old had not played at centre half until the Carling Cup semi-final first leg against Wycombe Wanderers in January, when an injury crisis led to him partnering Paulo Ferreira. 

While the Portugal defender struggled, Essien appeared comfortable in the role, a view confirmed by the fact that Chelsea have lost only two of the nine matches in which he has played at the back. 

Michaels been a great centre half and, as a squad, it has been invaluable for him to be able to do that, Terry said. 

When he first slotted in, the manager said make sure you keep talking to him and keep him in the right position, help him find his feet, but after five minutes it was automatic for Michael. He gives us a huge amount in midfield, but its a great strength to have him at the back hes been awesome. 

Essiens move to centre back will enable Claude Makelele to anchor midfield in what could be his last appearance for the club. 

Villarreal have expressed an interest in the France midfield player, who has one year left on his contract and will discuss an extension with the club next week, though they are unlikely to meet his request for two more years. 

Terry believes that Chelsea must win Saturday for this season to be judged a success. We won the Carling Cup and normally we have won two [trophies] in a year, he said. The Carling Cup is a good trophy to win, but for us to assess the season after then it is important to win the FA Cup.

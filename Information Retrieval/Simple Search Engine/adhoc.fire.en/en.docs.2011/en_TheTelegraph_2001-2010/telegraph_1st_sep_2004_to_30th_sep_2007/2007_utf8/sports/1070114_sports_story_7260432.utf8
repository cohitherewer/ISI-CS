 Rookie Emrit in squad

 Sarwan 

Port of Spain: Ramnaresh Sarwan, one of the mainstays of the West Indies batting line-up, will miss the four-match one-day series against India due to a foot injury. 

The Guyanese middle-order batsman has not recovered fully from the injury sustained on the Pakistan tour and will not take part in the series, convenor of selectors Gordon Greenidge said. 

The 14-man squad, led by Brian Lara, will also miss allrounder Dwayne Smith and seamer Corey Collymore, who have been rested. 

The only uncapped player named in the squad is Trinidad and Tobago allrounder Reyad Emrit. Opener Devon Smith and allrounder Darren Sammy have also been included. 

This is our last chance to look at a few players and they have been included because you do not know what might happen in the next few weeks, Greenidge said. 

We have a few injuries, and we want to have a look at a few players at international level to see what they have to offer, the Barbadian, one of the finest opening batsmen in the game, said.

 PCB hits back at Waqar

 PCB must respect former players, says Waqar 

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has hit back at Waqar Younis, describing him as unprofessional and showing arrogance and indiscipline while quitting as bowling coach of the national squad. 

PCB treats all its contractual staff/consultants as professionals but regrets to mention that Waqar has failed to behave in a professional manner and has clearly violated the discipline and breached the contract. That evidently documents managements discretion to send him or not on a foreign tour with the team, Saleem Altaf, the Boards director cricket operations, said in a statement on Sunday evening. 

PCB respects all its employees, players and consultants but would not tolerate indiscipline and arrogance, he added. 

Waqar, who quit hours before he was scheduled to leave for South Africa to join the team, was disappointed that he was appointed only for the Tests rather than the entire tour and accused the Board for maltreating him. I was frustrated at the way the Board treated me and I think it is time they learnt to show more respect to former players for their contribution, he said. 

Altaf said Waqar was on unauthorised leave when he went to perform Haj and had contributed little to the team in the shorter version of the game. (PTI)

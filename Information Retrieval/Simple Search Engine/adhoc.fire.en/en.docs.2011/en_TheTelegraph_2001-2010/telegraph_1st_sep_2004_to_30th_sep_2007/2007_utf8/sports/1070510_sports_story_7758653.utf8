 United draw with Chelsea

London: Chelsea and Manchester United, league champions old and new, produced a strictly mid-table performance on Wednesday in a goalless showdown. 

The game, which should have been one of the highlights of the season, was downgraded to dead rubber status when United secured the title on Sunday after Chelsea drew 1-1 with Arsenal. 

Alex Ferguson put out a second-string team with Chinese forward Fangzhuo Dong donning the red shirt competitively for the first time more than three years after joining the club. (Reuters)

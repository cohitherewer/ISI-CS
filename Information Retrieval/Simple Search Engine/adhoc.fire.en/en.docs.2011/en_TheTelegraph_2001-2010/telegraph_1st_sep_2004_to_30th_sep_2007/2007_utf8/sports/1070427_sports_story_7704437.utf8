 CSA to probe inconsistency

Johannesburg: South Africas inconsistent performance at the World Cup, culminating in a seven-wicket semi-final defeat to Australia, will be investigated by Cricket South Africa (CSA). The CSA said the teams performance was deeply disappointing and added that the weaknesses exposed by the defeat would be dealt with as a matter of urgency. 

Although this does not take anything away from the Australian victory, the Proteas performance was disappointing to say the least, CSA chief executive Gerald Majola said in a statement on Thursday. 

There are weaknesses in the Proteas squad which will be addressed as a matter of urgency, Majola continued. There was an alarming inconsistency in the performances by the Proteas. The statement said South Africa was instituting an academy exchange programme with India and Pakistan to deal with spin bowling. (Reuters)

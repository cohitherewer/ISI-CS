 Younis Khan available

Karachi: Senior Pakistan batsman Younis Khan has made himself available for the upcoming ODIs against India and Scotland in the UK. 

The national selectors, however will make an official announcement after getting approval from Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Naseem Ashraf, who is presently in India. 

Younis, who is currently playing for Yorkshire, had declined to play in the Abu Dhabi series against Sri Lanka because of his commitment to the county until late September. This ruled him out of the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa. 

The PCB chief selector Salahuddin Ahmed had spoken to Younis and convinced him for giving priority to national team. (PTI)

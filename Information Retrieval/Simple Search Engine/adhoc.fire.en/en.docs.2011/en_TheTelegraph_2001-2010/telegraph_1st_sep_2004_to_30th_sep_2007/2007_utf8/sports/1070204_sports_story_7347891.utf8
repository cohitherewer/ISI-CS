The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Hope to give it our best shot: Bhutia 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Sao Paulo players may belong to a different planet, but Bhiachung Bhutia assured on Saturday that Mohun Bagan will give it their best short. 

Technically, they are far superior to us, but we are confident of putting up a good show and giving it the best shot, Bhaichung said on the eve of the match against Sao Paulo. 

These Sao Paulo players are young and knocking on the door of opportunity for a place in the senior side. So obviously, they will be motivated and try to impress the club management with their performance. From our perspective, we may have nothing to lose, but we wont allow them to take anything for granted, the India captain added. 

Jose Ramirez Barreto echoed the same feeling. These players are representatives of one of Brazils best clubs and they keep on improving in each match. Its going to be a tough challenge, but honestly speaking, we are not expecting much, Mohun Bagans Brazilian captain said. 

According to him, man-to-man marking instead of zonal marking can the ideal ploy to frustrate his fellow countrymen. 

Though there has not been any significant demand for tickets, according to an IFA official, it might take an upswing on Sunday.

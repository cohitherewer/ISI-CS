 Sanias focus on Istanbul

New Delhi: After winning her fourth WTA doubles title at the Morocco Open Sania Mirza is hoping to repeat the feat at the Istanbul Cup. 

She will be teaming up with Chinese Taipeis Chan Yung-Jan at the $200,000 WTA Tier III event that starts on Monday. 

Im playing doubles with Chan Yung-Jan, who made the Australian Open doubles final this year, Sania said. 

That was a last-minute decision, as well! I had nobody lined up and was desperately looking for a partner... Luckily, she was available. 

The Morocco title was the Indian aces first outside India. Its always good to win a title, and more so because we were a last-minute pairing. When we came here we didnt know who wed be playing with, Sania said after claiming the title in Fes on Saturday. 

Sania won her first WTA tour doubles title in the Hyderabad Open in 2004 and added the Bangalore Open and Sunfeast Open (Calcutta) crowns last year. (PTI)

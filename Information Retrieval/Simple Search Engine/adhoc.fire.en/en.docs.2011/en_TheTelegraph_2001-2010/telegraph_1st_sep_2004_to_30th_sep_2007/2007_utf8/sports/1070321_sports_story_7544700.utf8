 Chelsea, United in semis

 - FA launches probe after Spurs fan tries to punch Lampard 

 Shevchenko 

London: Champions Chelsea beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 and league leaders Manchester United overcame Middlesbrough with a Cristiano Ronaldo penalty on Monday to book their places in next months semi-finals of the FA Cup. 

United will meet Watford and Chelsea will take on Blackburn Rovers, with the final scheduled to return to the rebuilt Wembley stadium. 

A magical 55th minute goal conjured against the run of play from Andriy Shevchenko and a second scorcher nine minutes later from Shaun Wright-Phillips earned Chelsea their win in Mondays quarter-final replay. 

The Ukraine striker took a pass from Wright-Phillips on the right, stepped inside Steed Malbranque and sent a left foot shot into the top left of the net from 20 metres. 

Seven minutes later Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba expertly chested a ball, passed from deep by Ashley Cole, to Wright-Phillips on his left and the diminutive winger belted it past Paul Robinson in the Spurs net. 

Chelsea looked to be cruising until Ricardo Carvalho brought down Dimitar Berbatov in the Cheslea area in the 77th minute and Robbie Keane sent a penalty past Petr Cech. 

United had Middlesbrough on the backfoot from the first kick in their replay and might have scored half a dozen but for some fine goalkeeping from Mark Schwarzer. 

After the London tie an angry fan raced on to the pitch and aimed a punch at Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard who managed to duck out of the way. The fan was manhandled to the ground and led away by security staff. 

Maybe they (security) were sleeping a little bit, Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho commented afterwards. 

Tottenham, however, have banned for life the supporter. 

The Football Association is investigating security arrangements at White Hart Lane after the man and another, identified by Tottenham as a Chelsea fan, ran onto the field.

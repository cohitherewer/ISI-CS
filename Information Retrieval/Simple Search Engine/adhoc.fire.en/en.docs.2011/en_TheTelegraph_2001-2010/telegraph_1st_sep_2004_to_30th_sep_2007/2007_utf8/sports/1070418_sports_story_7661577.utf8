 Watson doubtful for NZ tie

Melbourne: Australian allrounder Shane Watsons further appearance in the World Cup looks increasingly doubtful as he continues to struggle with his calf strain. 

The Australian selectors have made it clear that Watson will be picked for the semi-finals only if he proves himself fit for the upcoming Super Eight clash against New Zealand, an Australian daily reported on Tuesday. 

But Australian team physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said the allrounder may not be fit for the match against New Zealand. 

Watson, who picked up the injury in the Super Eight match against Bangladesh, has started batting in the nets but is yet to bowl. 

Ponting, however, remained optimistic about Watsons chances of recovering. 

All indications are that he is going to be right for Fridays game. The selectors are probably feeling that they would like to see him play a game before they would consider playing him in the semi-final, he said. 

The Aussie skipper, who had earlier hinted at bringing Watson back without any match practice for the semis, reiterated that he was willing to take the risk. 

I think we can monitor him pretty closely in all the training that he does. If he doesnt for some reason come up for Friday, then we have to push him as hard as we can in every training session so that he is going to play in the semi-finals, he said. (PTI)

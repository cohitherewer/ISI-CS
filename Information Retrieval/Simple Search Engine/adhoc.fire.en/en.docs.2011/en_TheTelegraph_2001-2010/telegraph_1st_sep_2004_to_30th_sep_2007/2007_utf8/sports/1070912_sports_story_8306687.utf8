The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Proud of her: Mithali

A STAFF REPORTER

 From top: Srirupa, Anjum and Mithali 

 Calcutta: Womens Cricketer of the Year Jhulan Goswami came in for rich praise from captain Mithali Raj. 

The following are excerpts from what current and former women players had to say about Jhulans achievement (alphabetically): 

SRIRUPA BOSE: Jhulans award is a giant leap not only for womens cricket but for womens sport in India. This is a lesson for all youngsters. For a girl coming from Nadia who had to move to Mumbai at a young age to play for Air India, Jhulan has groomed and conducted herself in an exemplary manner. She concentrated on her game, showed a lot of dedication and even got time to complete her studies. It speaks a lot about her strong will almost like a fairytale. I feel very proud of her Feel like we also have done something. I only hope she can play for Bengal now. The International Womens Cricket coming under the same umbrella as the International Cricket Council has been such a positive thing. 

ANJUM CHOPRA: Its a big award which recognises her as the years best performer. That it has come on the world stage adds to the significance. This is an award for an Indian first, then an individual. Its a step in the right direction. Hope it will lead to better days in Indian womens cricket. 

MITHALI RAJ: I was so happy when I heard that Jhulan had been shortlisted for the award I spoke to her just before she left for South Africa. She deserves this recognition for the hard work she has put in. 

The best thing about her is that she is always eager to perform. This will mean a lot for bowlers who feel they dont get enough recognition for their efforts. I am really proud of Jhulan. 

She is one player any captain would love to have in the side. 

On the England tour last year, she had to bowl many overs and may have been tired at times, but never said no when I handed the ball to her.

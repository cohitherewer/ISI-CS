 Inzamam left out

Karachi: The PCB has awarded performance-based central contracts to 20 players but former captain Inzamam-ul Haq is not among those who will receive the monthly retainers. 

Inzamam also does not figure in a shortlist of 20 bench players given smaller retainers based on their performances in domestic cricket. 

The concept of the new contracts is not just based on seniority. Now 40 per cent points will be awarded for performance and the remaining 60 for fitness, discipline and seniority, Zakir Khan, director of cricket operations, said on Monday. 

He said the board had no grudge against Inzamam, who retired from ODIs and stepped down from the captaincy after Pakistans early World Cup exit. Inzamam has said he wants to continue playing Tests. If Inzamam is fit he will be considered. We have given those players contracts and retainers who are available for both forms, Khan said. 

The PCB had cancelled the central contracts of players after they returned from the World Cup. Those contracts were based on seniority.Injury-prone fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has been given a central contract in the A category although he has played just one Test and four ODIs in the last 14 months. 

Shoaib Malik, Mohammed Yousuf, Younis Khan, Shahid Afridi, Umar Gul, Abdul Razzaq and Mohammed Asif have also been given A category contracts which have a monthly salary of Rs 250,000. 

Salman Butt, Mohammed Sami, Imran Farhat, Mohammed Hafeez, Yasir Hameed, Danish Kaneria and Kamran Akmal will get Rs 150,000 in the B category. 

Imran Nazir, Rao Iftikhar, Faisal Iqbal, Misbah-ul Haq and Yasir Arafat have been placed in the last category which carries a salary of Rs 100,000. 

The monthly retainers are in addition to the match and tour fees and other incentives earned by the players.

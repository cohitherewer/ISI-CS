 SA need 130, Pak 8 wickets

 - Harris (4/46) turns tide in hosts favour; visitors may complain against nel 

 Paul Harris is congratulated by Herschelle Gibbs in Centurion on Sunday. The left-arm spinner took four wickets on Day 4 of the first Test vs Pakistan

Centurion: South Africas Paul Harris took four wickets on Sunday but the Pakistan tail wagged merrily to leave the first Test in the balance after four days. 

South Africa were 69 for two in their second innings at stumps in search of a victory target of 199. 

Pakistan were earlier bowled out for 302 with left-arm spinner Harris, playing his second Test, bagging four for 46. 

The day started badly for South Africa when Imran Farhat was dropped twice early on but paceman Shaun Pollock eventually made the breakthrough in the 10th over of the day when he trapped Younis Khan in front for 38. 

Farhat finally fell for 68 in the third over before lunch when he prodded forward to a delivery from Harris and was caught by AB de Villiers at silly point. 

Faisal Iqbal was the next to go when he drove uppishly at a ball from Harris and was caught by Herschelle Gibbs at extra cover for nine. 

Pakistan then slipped to 187 for six when Inzamam-ul Haq smashed a delivery from Pollock only to be spectacularly caught by De Villiers at short mid-wicket. 

Harris struck again in the ninth over before tea when Kamran Akmal, who scored 15, swept at a legside delivery and gloved a catch to Gibbs at short fine leg. 

Naved-ul-Hasan and Shahid Nazir then shared 56 off 61 balls for Pakistans eighth wicket, and in all Pakistan scored 92 runs in the 15 overs after South Africa took the new ball. 

Ntini broke the eighth-wicket stand 11 balls after tea when he bowled Nazir for 40, while Pollock removed Naved for 33. 

Harris ended the innings with a delivery that Danish Kaneria swept high in the air to deep backward square leg, where Gibbs took the catch. 

South Africas batsman then made it to 69 for two for the loss of Graeme Smith and de Villiers. 

Smith was trapped lbw by Mohammad Hafeez for 32 and his opening partner was caught by Younis off Mohammad Asif for 12. 

Meanwhile, Pakistan team is unhappy with the antics of South African pacer Andre Nel and is planning to lodge a formal complaint with the Match Referee after the first Test at the Centurion. 

Inzamam said after Day IIIs play that the Match Referee should take note of Nels provocative actions. 

The team management will formally table the matter before the Match Referee, he said. 

Nel has in the past got under the skin of others teams, most recently against India, but surprisingly Match Referees have been reluctant to penalise him or even ask him to tone down his histrionics which at times border on the offensive.

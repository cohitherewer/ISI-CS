 Mind games of 

a different kind

 Benitez and Mourinho 

There has already been mud-slinging between Rafael Benitez and Jose Mourinho and now, as Liverpool warm up for another Champions League semi-final against Chelsea, one of their new American co-owners has joined in the psychological warfare. He is, actually, looking beyond Wednesdays first leg at Stamford Bridge and making plans for the final in Athens on May 23. 

In financial terms, George Gillett Jr and Tom Hicks are pygmies compared to Roman Abramovich, but Liverpools new joint-owners are firmly expecting their franchise to prove to the Russian billionaire for a second time that his money cannot buy Chelsea a place in the Champions League final. 

Call it the American way, but Hicks says that he is not contemplating defeat and is instead expecting a repeat of 2005, when Liverpool overcame Chelsea in the semi-finals before beating AC Milan in the final in Istanbul. 

Im such an optimist, Hicks said. I was looking ahead to the final even before we won the first game with PSV Eindhoven 3-0. What a great way for us (Gillett and Hicks) to start if we could win it again. 

The last semi-final was an extremely tense affair, with the only goal of the tie scored by Luis Garcia at Anfield one which is disputed by Mourinho, the Chelsea manager, to this day and Benitez, his Liverpool counterpart, expects a similarly tight occasion this time. 

I dont think there will be many goals, he said. But 0-0 away from home is not necessarily a good result. It is better to try to score a goal. We scored goals in Barcelona (in the first knockout round) and our idea is to score at Stamford Bridge and hopefully win. 

Benitez faces a tactical conundrum but is expected to find a place in his midfield for Javier Mascherano, who has impressed since his arrival from West Ham United in January, with Steven Gerrard perhaps in line for a more advanced role.

 Stewarts influence on Prior

 Simon Briggs 

 Matt Prior 

As Matt Prior attempts to become the first England wicketkeeper to take full possession of the role since Alec Stewart, he is receiving expert guidance from a particularly well-qualified source Stewart himself. 

After delighting the Lords crowd with a window-rattling innings of 126 not out, Prior revealed that Stewart had taken his game to another level since becoming his agent and manager three years ago. 

Alec has been brilliant, Prior said. The minute I got the phone call, Alec was the third person I called after my mum and dad. 

You get times when you feel a bit anxious, or need to ask a few questions, and its been wonderful to have someone like him with all that experience at the other end of the phone. He would say Itll be alright, just worry about your own game. Two weeks ago he came down and we had a two-hour batting session. 

Stewarts retirement four years ago left England short of the allrounder they needed to balance the side at least until Andrew Flintoff came of age the following summer. Given that Flintoff is now a frequent absentee, Priors volcanic arrival on the Test-match stage could hardly have been better timed. 

Prior will face sterner tests than this tired West Indies attack. But if he can build on his wonderful start, he could help resolve Englands recent difficulties with selection. A team with Prior at No. 6 could play Flintoff at No 7 the position that his shaky batting form demanded last winter and still have five proper bowlers to call upon. 

You have to have your low times to really appreciate the high times, said Prior, who was devastated to be dumped from Englands one-day squad last year after a run of low scores in India and Pakistan. You have decisions to make: do you sulk and make excuses or do you say: Right, Im going to find out what I have to do to get back? 

Through hard work and determination Ive managed to get back, and thats why today is a very special day. 

It emerged last night that Fintoff would get a game this weekend, after all. He is due to turn out for Lancashire in Sundays Roses one-dayer, but only as a specialist batsman. The structural integrity of that gnarled left ankle is still a long way from being proven.

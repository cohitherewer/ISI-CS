 SHARP SINGLES 

Counselling for SA players 

Basseterre: Shattered by their former coach Bob Woolmers shock death, the South African team were put through counselling sessions not to let affect their chances against Australia. Notwithstanding their match against Scotland on Tuesday, the focus was on the Saturday clash against the defending champions. Coach Mickey Arthur took care that senior players such as Shaun Pollock, Herschelle Gibbs and Jacques Kallis, grieved properly before the group A showdown. Obviously the players were shocked by what happened on Sunday. It was only last week that we spent time around the pool with him laughing and joking, Arthur said, adding: It

 was something we needed to discuss.

Joyce thrilled 

Gros Islet: England opener Ed Joyce is thrilled that his former Ireland teammates have a chance of making the Super Eights after their shock win over Pakistan on Saturday. The Dublin-born 28 year-old played for Ireland in the ICC Trophy between 2001 and 2005, and his performances were instrumental in helping Ireland qualify for this tournament. However, the left-hander switched to England in 2006 in the hope of playing in Tests and more one-day series. It was brilliant. My big hope for Ireland coming into this tournament was that they would do themselves justice, he said on Tuesday. 

No strike 

Port of Spain: The West Indies cricketers on Monday promised not to strike during the ongoing World Cup, vowing to honour their agreement with the West Indian Cricket Board (WICB) despite some tension. West Indies Players Association (WIPA) president Dinanath Ramnarine said the players have been advised to sign the contracts issued by the WICB, even though the written agreement varied from the verbally-agreed one. 

Immediately on receiving the contracts, WIPA sought legal advice, and advised the players to sign, notwithstanding the fact that the contracts deviated from certain agreed provisions, Ramnarine said. 

More ads 

New Delhi: FMCG majors, who have been advertising in the ongoing World Cup, are undeterred by Indias position in the tournament and are ready to continue their aggressive marketing even if the team fails to qualify to the Super Eights. The advertising and other marketing promotions are part of a package designed to coincide with the World Cup. Indias performance is an extra benefit but not necessarily dictates the aggressiveness of the marketing and advertising plan, one of the firms director said. 

Henry dilemma 

Edinburgh: For former Test player Omar Henry, watching South Africa take on Scotland in the World Cup is a tug on emotions. Henry, the first non-white player to represent South Africa after the end of apartheid, spent 12 seasons in Scotland playing club cricket and, like many of his countrymen, attracted the moniker jock-bok. Its a dream come true, really, to see both sides playing each other at the world cup, Henry said during the match on Tuesday.

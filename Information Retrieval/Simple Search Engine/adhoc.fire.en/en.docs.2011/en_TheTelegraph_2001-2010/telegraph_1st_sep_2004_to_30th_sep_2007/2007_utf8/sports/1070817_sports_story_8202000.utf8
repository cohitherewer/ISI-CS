 CSA summons Mark Boucher

 Jacques Kallis 

Durban: Jacques Kallis suffered his second disappointment in less than a week on Thursday when he was left out of South Africas squad to tour Zimbabwe. 

Allrounder Kallis was omitted from the squad on Saturday for the ICC World Twenty20 championship, which will be staged in South Africa in September. 

The squad which will play three one-day Internationals in Zimbabwe next week differs slightly from that selected for the 20-over tournament. 

Fast bowler Dale Steyn has been picked in place of allrounder Justin Kemp and wicketkeeper Mark Boucher has been omitted. 

According to CricketSouth Africa (CSA) statement quoting selection convenor Joubert Strydom said Kalliss omission from the Twenty20 squad was due to his being rested. 

However, Kallis showed his disappointment by resigning as South Africas vice-captain and saying he was considering his options for the future. 

Boucher supported Kallis in media reports and comments attributed to the wicketkeeper have led to his being summoned to a disciplinary hearing on Friday. 

Boucher was quoted by a newspaper as suggesting there were ulterior motives for Kallis being left out. It is either those who have an issue with him, and have a chip on their shoulders, or those who have ulterior motives. 

THE SQUAD 

Graeme Smith (captain), Gulam Bodi, Loots Bosman, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, Herschelle Gibbs, Albie Morkel, Morne Morkel, Makhaya Ntini, Vernon Philander, Shaun Pollock, Dale Steyn, Thandi Tshabalala, Johan van der Wath.

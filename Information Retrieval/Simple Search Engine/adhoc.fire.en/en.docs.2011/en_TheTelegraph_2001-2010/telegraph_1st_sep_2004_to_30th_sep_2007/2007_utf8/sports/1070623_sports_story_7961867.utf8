 Real big offer for Kaka

 - Spanish giants ready to dish out 80 million euros for Brazilian play-maker 

A Spanish daily has said that Real Madrid will launch a massive offensive to rope in Kaka once Fabio Capello is sacked on Monday. The transfer strategy for the summer is already in place. 

Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon is unwilling to give up on landing Kaka, and believes that persistent pressure on Milan will tell. 

The report said that Real Madrid have a 110 million euro transfer budget for this summer, and are ready to spend 80 million of those on the Brazilian play-maker, making him the most expensive signing in football history. 

Jose Angel Sanchez, a board member with contacts in Milan, and sporting director Pedja Mijatovic have been handed the license to step up their efforts. 

Bernd Schuster, the man supposed to replace Capello, has already given his endorsement saying: Kaka is more important that Cristiano Ronaldo. 

Diogo Kotscho, an associate of the player has admitted that transfer records would be torched if the move goes through. If Real Madrid managed to sign Kaka, he would be the most expensive signing in football ever. 

Real Madrids offer is really good, and until August 31, it is impossible to rule out the fact that Kaka will be at the Bernabeu next season. 

The report suggests that should this move go through, Real Madrid will use the rest of the budget to land Gabriel Heinze, Javier Saviola, Jerzy Dudek and Claude Makelele. 

However, Real Madrid also have a plan B in place, should the attempt fail: Cesc Fabregas, Arjen Robben and Daniel Alves will enter into the fray instead. 

The club remains in good financial health despite the end of the Galactico era, according to Calderon. 

Unlike many other clubs Real Madrid have managed to establish a sustainable model that brings us substantial profits, Calderon said on Friday.

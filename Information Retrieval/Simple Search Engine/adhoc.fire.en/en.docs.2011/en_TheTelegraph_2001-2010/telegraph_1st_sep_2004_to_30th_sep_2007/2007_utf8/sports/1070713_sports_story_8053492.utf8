No one man can be bigger than his team, or so the maxim goes, but David Beckham does not so much outshine the Los Angeles Galaxy as eclipse them. Amid all the Hollywood hysteria that attends his presentation at the Home Depot Center on Thursday, consider this almost 3,000 miles away, on a Virginia student campus, the same players he hopes to inspire were beaten 1-0 by the Richmond Kickers, before a crowd of less than 5,000. For someone who insists he could have lasted three more seasons at Real Madrid, Beckham is finding the rationale for his career move undermined by some unglamorous realities. 

It would be unwise to suggest this to the Galaxys president, Alexi Lalas, who regards mocking mentions of Beckham goes to Hollywood with contempt and accuses the Premiership of peddling an inferior product. However, the travails of the team are self-evident. Winning just three of their 12 games to date, the Galaxy, suddenly American soccers most famous franchise, are gripped by status anxiety. Sandwiched between Real Salt Lake and the Colorado Rapids at the foot of the Western Conference, they hardly look like a club who can be transformed in an instant by Beckhams influence. 

Behind their rhetoric of revival and revolution, the noises among their players are starting to become rancorous. Landon Donovan, once Major League Soccers pre-eminent talent and the one figure who could hold a candle to Beckhams celebrity, began the long trek back from Virginia on Wednesday with some abrasive words. Guys need to look at themselves and say, Do you want to be here? Do you want to play? he said. And then, Do you want to win? I didnt feel that attitude from them. Close your eyes and you might have been listening to an embattled League One manager after a midweek defeat, not a player whose professional landscape is about to be reordered by the Beckham effect. 

Perhaps the problem is that no one in Los Angeles seems quite sure what the Beckham effect will be. Paul Pierce, a star of the Boston Celtics basketball team, was intrigued enough to spend time with journalists at Chelseas Beverly Hills training camp this week, but looked blank when asked how much he knew about soccers finest import: I know all the hoop-la surrounding him. I know that he signed for $250 million. 

While fellow sportsmen might be perplexed at a pay deal that puts Beckham in the same bracket as NBA players Kobe Bryant and Shaquille Neal, you would expect that the head of the US Soccer Federation would promote his greatest asset without a trace of ambivalence. 

But in a sign of doubt at the top of the sport, Sunil Gulati admitted the long-term benefits of Beckhams move were uncertain. Recalling the extraordinary but ephemeral success sparked by Peles role in the New York Cosmos in the 1970s, Gulati asked: Is Beckham going to be Pele? Pele took us up but we couldnt sustain it. Sustaining the higher level, thats the big issue. Its not inevitable. 

The emphasis upon the media interest is telling, for American network television has been stirred by soccer to a degree inconceivable before Beckhams signing. ESPN, the sports broadcaster, will train 19 cameras upon his debut game for the Galaxy on July 21 one of which will track every move of the man himself. Even during commercial breaks there will be no escape, as Adidas, Beckhams clothing sponsor, have launched a Futbol meets football campaign in an attempt to project a Latin mystique that can appeal to the Galaxys Hispanic constituency. 

These marketing ploys reflect the work Beckham faces to implant himself in Americas sporting psyche. Although elements of his iconic image the looks, the fashion sense precede him, there need to be some subtle adjustments to suit his latest environment. In particular, his image consultants are adamant that he has to assert his sports credentials more forcefully, establishing some distance from the showbusiness ambitions of his wife. Effectively, we are left with his and hers strategies; David communicating his story as an athlete through the Galaxy, Victoria telling her side as a dislocated glamour model in her reality TV show. 

As well as the family man impressions have served Beckham, Chris Maguire, Adidas director of sports marketing, stressed that he would have to suppress this side: Its a major challenge to get the sport into the mindset of fans here. He is the No 1 soccer brand the family is a great global brand, too, but Beckham wants to be known as a sports star. Maybe in the future they will be involved, but not at this time. 

To that end, a redesigned Galaxy replica top was launched on Wednesday to mark Beckhams unveiling, amid hopes that it would be the fastest-selling jersey in MLS, plus a vehicle for taking the league global. Adidas, who produce the kit for all 13 clubs and hold individual contracts with around three quarters of the players, are trying to increase the expected windfall by arranging for Beckham to front an MLS represent campaign.

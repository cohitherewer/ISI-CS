The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Russian march goes on

 NATHANIEL VINTON 

Nikolay Davydenko is the only man who is yet to drop a set at the US Open this year. He seems undistracted by an investigation into irregular gambling patterns in one of his matches earlier this summer, and he certainly did not seem ruffled by a tired and combustible Tommy Haas. 

Davydenko defeated Haas 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 and became the third Russian in three matches on Wednesday to advance to the semis in straight sets. The other two were Anna Chakvetadze and the 2004 womens champion, Svetlana Kuznetsova. 

Chakvetadze beat the crowd favourite Peer 6-4, 6-1, and Kuznetsova defeated the 18-year-old Hungarian newcomer Agnes Szavay 6-1, 6-4. 

Chakvetadze, 20, reached her first Grand Slam semi-final dispatching another 20-year-old, Israels Shahar Peer. 

Davydenko remained quick-footed and tight-lipped throughout the match as Haas, of Germany, grew desperate trying to find a weak spot in Davydenkos court coverage. At times he makes you try to do too much, Haas said. He got to me a little mentally. Every time I tried to do something differently to fight my way out of it, he came up with an answer. 

Davydenko, who lost to Roger Federer in the semi-finals of last years tournament, addressed several questions about the gambling investigation, which is reportedly focusing on the unusual amount of money wagered on his lower-ranked opponent at the Polish Open last month. Davydenko eventually dropped out of the match because of injury. 

For me, its very important that I just think about my matches in the US Open, Davydenko said, although he speculated that outsiders might have gathered information about his injury. 

The days other Russian winners, Chakvetadze and Kuznetsova, will face each other in the semis, ensuring that at least one Russian will feature in the womens final this weekend. 

Kuznetsova, the fourth seed, has not won a Grand Slam event since her 2004 title, and was the runner-up to Justine Henin at the 2006 French Open.

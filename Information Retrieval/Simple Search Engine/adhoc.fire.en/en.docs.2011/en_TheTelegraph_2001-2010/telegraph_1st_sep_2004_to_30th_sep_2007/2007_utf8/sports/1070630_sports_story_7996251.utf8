The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Task getting tougher for us

- Sole focus should now be on qualifying for Beijing Olympics

Stickwork

Gurbux Singh

Our chances of making the Champions Trophy proper now seem as good as over. After squandering innumerable opportunities against Argentina and losing the crucial tie in the ongoing qualifiers in Boom (Belgium), India have only themselves to blame for the predicament they are in. 

There is still a flicker of hope in that the South Americans stumble against New Zealand in their final group encounter and allow India to beat Japan in such a way as to make the summit clash a prerequisite for playing in the main round of Champions Trophy. 

All these ifs and buts could have been easily avoided had we been a little more attentive regarding our plans in the attacking third. Thursdays match against Argentina, in a way, has been indicative of what current Indian hockey is all about promising yet misfiring in crucial junctures. 

I wonder how many international teams enjoy the luxury of creating and missing a dozen penalty corners! Perhaps none except India. Sadly, it has been a continuing tale. 

True, luck didnt favour us. But the defeat against Argentina was also a result of bad strategy. What the Indian management had done on Thursday took me completely by surprise. You cannot play an international game without a drag-flicker. And starting off with Sandeep Singh on the bench amounted to precisely that. 

Sandeep was not on hand for Indias first six PCs and though he failed to convert any of the next six, its overall a weird game plan, unimaginable in modern hockey. This, coupled with Indias age-old malady of conceding late goals, put paid to our hopes. 

The task ahead is getting more difficult now. Our sole focus should be on qualifying for the Beijing Olympics. We have three qualifiers to achieve that goal, but it wont be a cakewalk, since only the winners will make the cut. 

Back home the situation remains grave, though for a different reason. The junior national meet is underway in Chennai and Ive come to know that several teams are fielding over-aged players. Interestingly, some of them from Jharkhand and Bihar have played in the BHA league and so we have a fair idea about this issue. 

The IHF has sent a circular to all associations, but the problem continues. 

It calls for accountability and honesty from the participating teams. They need to realise that Indias future lies in the junior tournaments. If the grassroots are tampered with, it will forever cripple Indian hockey.

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sreesanth 

London: Sreesanth, seen by some as Team Indias enfant terrible, has promised to give 200 per cent in the third and final Test. 

The speedster said so during a one-on-one with chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar on Tuesday evening. Hes been dropped for the upcoming seven ODIs against England. 

I feel terrible when somebody has to be left out and, so, I called Sreesanth to my (hotel) room... We spoke for around ten minutes and I explained that he needed to capitalise on his talent and take big wickets, Vengsarkar told The Telegraph. 

Speaking on the morning-after, he added: Sreesanth understood why hed been dropped for the ODIs and promised to give 200 per cent over the next few days... He has taken his omission well... 

According to captain Rahul Dravid, hed rather have players who get affected on being left out. The worst kind of players are those whore happy on being dropped... I have no problem with players being disappointed and wanting to go out and correct it. Those are the sort of guys we want... 

Dravid couldnt have been more blunt.

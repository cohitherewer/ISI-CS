 Stenson bags Match Play title

Marana (Arizona): Swede Henrik Stenson became the second European to win the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, beating defending champion Geoff Ogilvy of Australia 2 amp; 1 in Sundays final. 

Two up after a fluctuating morning round in bright sunshine, Stenson trailed by one midway through the afternoon before clinching his maiden PGA Tour victory with a birdie on the par-five 35th hole. 

The Swede, who won this months Dubai Desert Classic, emulated the achievement of Britains Darren Clarke, who triumphed in 2000 at La Costa.

 It would be so nice to win it: Federer

Paris: For all of Roger Federers titles at Wimbledon, the US Open and the Australian Open there are 10 and counting his career very well may be defined eventually by how he fared at the French Open. 

Federer is well aware of that. Its why he tweaked his schedule and his practice routine in the months before heading to Paris. Its why he ratcheted up his commitment to fitness training, knowing what a grind playing on red clay can be. 

Theres more focus on the French Open, and it would be just so nice to win it, so Im going to give myself the best possible chance, Federer said. 

He also knows that his success elsewhere might in a way be a result of his lack of success in the past at Roland Garros, where the years second Grand Slam tournament begins Sunday. 

Pretty much everyone expects to see Federer face two-time defending champion Rafael Nadal in the mens final, just like last year. 

And just like last year, Federer heads to the French Open hoping to complete a career and a non-calendar Grand Slam. 

Turn back the calendar to May 26, 2003, when Federer was an up-and-comer at the French Open. He was 21, seeded fifth, and word was spreading that he was a talented, all-court player who could challenge consistently for major titles. 

I remember going into the tournament feeling so confident, Federer said, going like, I could win this thing. Im playing so well at the moment. 

What happened? Federer fell in straight sets in the first round to Luis Horna, a Peruvian ranked 88th at the time. It was a significant turning point. 

I had to toughen up a bit, you know? It was just one of those moments when I finally realised I have to still change a few things. Because I thought I had everything figured out by then. But I didnt, he said. 

By reaching the June 10 final, Federer would play in his eighth major title match in a row, something no man has done. Not Laver. Not Pete Sampras. Not Bjorn Borg. No one. 

What happened in the Hamburg Masters final this month added some intrigue to a possible Federer-Nadal rematch at the French Open. 

Right when Federer was beginning to look a tad vulnerable a four-tournament title drought, a loss to 53rd-ranked Filippo Volandri, a split from part-time coach Tony Roche he went out and beat Nadal in Hamburg. Attacking more than usual on clay, Federer picked up his first victory in six tries against Nadal on the surface. 

The Spaniard won a total of two games in the last two sets. That setback also ended Nadals 81-match winning streak on clay, the longest on any surface. Im playing my best tennis, better than ever, so I cant be sad because I lost one match to the best, Nadal said. 

Nadal will be trying to make some history, too. Only one man has won at least three straight French Open titles: Borg in 1978-81. 

Justine Henin she dropped the hyphenated second half of her name, Hardenne, when she split from her husband also is aiming for a third consecutive championship. She has to be considered the favourite, and its tough to figure out who will challenge her. 

Kim Clijsters has retired, Lindsay Davenport is pregnant and Martina Hingis has withdrawn with a bad hip. Even players planning to compete have been nursing injuries, including Maria Sharapova (shoulder) and Nicole Vaidisova (wrist). 

Serena Williams proved at the Australian Open that she cant ever be counted out, but both she and older sister Venus recently lost early at tune-up tournaments. 

Svetlana Kuznetsova, last years runner-up to Henin, and Jelena Jankovic, who won the Italian Open on clay, could make deep runs or, because of wear and tear, disappear before the second week.

New Delhi: Mahesh Bhupathi and Sania Mirza fought their way into their respective doubles finals at the Pilot Pen Classic in New Haven on Friday. 

The straight-sets victory for Bhupathi and Serbian partner Nenad Zimonjic was not an easy one, the top seeds scrambling to a 7-5, 7-6 (7-2) win to book their berth in the mens doubles final. There, they will meet fourth seeds Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski of Poland, who defeated Jordan Kerr of Australia and Jamie Murray of Britain 6-2, 6-3. 

Sania also found the going tough, but she and Italian Mara Santangelo prevailed over second-seeds Kveta Peschke of Czech Republic and Rennae Stubbs of Australia 2-6, 6-3, 10-5. 

In the final, the third seeds will take on No. 1 seeds Cara Black of Zimbabwe and Liezel Huber of the US, who beat the Czech-US pair of Iveta Benesova and Bethanie Mattek 4-6, 6-0, 10-5. 

In singles action, third seed James Blake came through another tough test to set up an all-American final against Mardy Fish. 

Meanwhile, Indian hopes of seeing two women players competing in the main draw of the US Open ended with Sunitha Raos 4-6, 4-6 third round defeat to second seed Zi Yan in the qualifiers here. (AGENCIES)

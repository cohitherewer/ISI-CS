Calcutta: Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar has been reappointed as chairman of the revised cricket committee of the International Cricket Council (ICC) according to a report from Karachi. However, a confirmation couldnt be got from Gavaskar and ICC spokesman Brian Murgatroyd, who was non-committal. 

The Telegraph had reported on February 23 that Gavaskar might consider continuing. 

I cant confirm this The current committee is in place until the next annual conference in June, was all Murgatroyd said. Gavaskar could not be reached for a comment at his Mumbai residence as he had gone out for dinner. 

According to the report, Gavaskar, who was last year given a one-year extension, had been reappointed at ICCs recent two-day board meeting in Cape Town. 

Gavaskar has again been picked to head the committee at the two-day meeting of the ICC board held in Cape Town earlier this month, the sources said. 

They said under the revised terms, the 12-member cricket committee for the first time appointed two representatives of the full member teams, including Kumar Sangakkara of Sri Lanka and Australian Tim May, who heads the international players association. 

Another key appointment is that now Saleem Altaf, director cricket operations of the Pakistan Cricket Board, will represent the cricket boards. 

The sources said Altaf had been picked after Martin Snedden of New Zealand and Duleep Mendis of Sri Lanka made themselves unavailable.

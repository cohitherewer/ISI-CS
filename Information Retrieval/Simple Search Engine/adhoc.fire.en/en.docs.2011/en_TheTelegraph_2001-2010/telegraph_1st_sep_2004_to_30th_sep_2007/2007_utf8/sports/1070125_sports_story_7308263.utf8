 Sachin should be consistent: Amarnath

New Delhi: Mohinder Amarnath Wednesday questioned Sachin Tendulkars place in the Indian team and said he needs to deliver consistently to retain his place in the playing XI. 

He has contributed immensely for Indian cricket but he needs to deliver to keep his place in the team, Amarnath said. 

If you want your place in the team you have to be consistent with your performance. Cricket is bigger than any player, no matter how a great a player you have been, Amarnath told a TV channel. 

The former India Test player said Sachin was looking for an excuse or blaming the pitch everytime he got out. 

Of late it is becoming his habit to gesticulate after his dismissal and this attitude will not send right signals to the youngsters in the team, Amarnath said, according to a press release issued by the channel. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A piece of history that has no future

New Delhi: For those who still take pride in the so called tradition of Calcutta football, it was certainly a moment of satisfaction to see Joseph Blatter choose the eastern metropolis as his first stop during his three-day India visit. But in the end, all that the Mecca of Indian football had in store for the Fifa chief was some Brazilian magic that shaped the fortune of the Mohun Bagan-East Bengal tie. 

The rest, as Blatter pointed out, was a piece of history that had no future. He openly called the Calcutta clubs as something from the past, past, century, which has little resemblance to modern football. 

It was a pity that the Fifa president had to come all the way from Zurich to tell us the truth, said IFA secretary Subrata Dutta. We knew all about it but could never gather enough courage to say it. Its good someone has pointed it out finally. 

Calcutta football, despite all its glorious past, is in a dilapidated state at the moment. The social and financial character of the City of Joy has undergone dramatic changes in the past 10 years, but football, surprisingly though, has managed to keep itself away from all the transformation. 

No doubt, we are still languishing, admits Chuni Goswami, arguably the biggest star of Calcutta football in the pre-television days. Our ground condition is bad, coaching system is outdated. The clubs are still run in the manner it was done during the 50s. But then, we needed this warning. Now we should change for good. 

Lack of talent is one of Calcutta footballs biggest problems now. Gone are the days when array of local superstars like Sudhir Karmakar, Surojit Sengupta, Subhas Bhowmick or Gautam Sarkar would rule the maidan with their magnetic skills that would enthral thousands. Football, in the city now, is solely dependent on outstation and foreign recruits, who would be counted upon to deliver the results. 

What we need now is a lot of academies, thundered Mohun Bagan president Swapan Sadhan Bose, who pleaded to the Fifa chief to convince AIFF about the need for academies. We have been running from pillar to post to run our academy in Durgapur. Unfortunately, neither the local association nor the national body has come forward to lend us a helping hand. 

Who is going to help them? retorted a federation official, who didnt wish to be named. All Calcutta clubs now have a bunch of ill-tempered officials, who cannot run their teams properly, but only blame others for defeats. 

They target referees, coaches, officials and even players. Twenty years ago, the success story of Calcutta football was shaped by dedicated officials. Now the officials hang on for their own gains, he added. 

Former national coach Sukhwinder Singh was even more sarcastic. Why did Mohun Bagan have to take Blatter to their ground? Was there anything to see except for an ill-prepared pitch? They called for trouble. 

There seems no solution to the deep-rooted problems that have plagued the game.

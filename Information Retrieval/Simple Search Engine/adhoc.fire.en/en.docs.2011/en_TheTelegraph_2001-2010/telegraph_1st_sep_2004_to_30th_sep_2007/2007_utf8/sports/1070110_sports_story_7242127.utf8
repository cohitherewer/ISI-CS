 Jayasuriya on a high

Hamilton: Sanath Jayasuriya became the most-capped player in ODIs on Tuesday, although the fifth one-day match between New Zealand and Sri Lanka was abandoned because of rain. 

The 37-year-old opener was credited with his 375th ODI appearance despite the abandonment, moving clear of Sachin Tendulkar. 

New Zealand umpire Billy Bowden was also deemed to have officiated in his 100th ODI, becoming the eighth umpire to do so. (AP)

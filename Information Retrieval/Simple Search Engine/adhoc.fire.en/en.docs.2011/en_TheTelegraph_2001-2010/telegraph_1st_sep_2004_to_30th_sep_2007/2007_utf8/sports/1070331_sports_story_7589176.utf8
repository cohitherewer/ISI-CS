 PCB to review contracts

 Islamabad: Pakistan cricketers 

 are set to pay dearly for their World Cup flop show after 

 the Board on Friday said that it would review the players 

 contracts and make them performance-based. 

A Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official said that the national team would be revamped following their pathetic display in the World Cup, where Inzamam and his men were knocked out in the first round after losses to the West Indies and Ireland. 

We are also going to have a look at the central contracts awarded to 20 players and make them more performance-based so that the players know they have to perform to get paid well, the official added. 

Discussions would be held on the appointment of a new captain after Inzamam-ul Haq stepped down from ODIs. 

These are critical decisions and we have to be very sure. We have to ensure that we bring about positive changes, the official said. 

Meanwhile, sources said the PCB plans to revamp the executive council and include some technocrats and former players. 

At the moment, the PCB functions with an ad-hoc committee handpicked by the chairman.

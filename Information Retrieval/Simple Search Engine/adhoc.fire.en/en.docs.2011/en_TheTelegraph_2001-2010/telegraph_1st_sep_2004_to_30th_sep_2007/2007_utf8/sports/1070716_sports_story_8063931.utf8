 Becks faces a whole new world

 - England star will encounter long commercial flights, searing heat and mediocre officiating 

 GRAHAME L. JONES

 David Beckham 

On Friday, David Beckham stepped onto an American field for the first time as a Major League Soccer player. The earth didnt tremble. Lightning bolts didnt flash across the sky. There was no wailing and gnashing of teeth. Life went on as normal, even in Carson. 

But the professional soccer life that the former England national team captain has enjoyed the last 15 years is about to change dramatically. Think of Kobe Bryant going to play in Spain. Think of Barry Bonds in a Yomiuri Giants uniform. 

Think of, well, Beckham, in a Galaxy jersey, at Pizza Hut Park in Frisco, Texas, on a 100-degree afternoon, with a so-so referee making another questionable call, with Beckhams bad ankle throbbing and the prospect of yet another crowded commercial flight ahead of him. 

No doubt all of this has occurred to the 32-year-old midfielder. No doubt his multimillion-dollar contract has enabled him to see beyond the next five years. He voiced just the right words on Friday when he was introduced amid much fanfare at the Home Depot Center. 

But Beckhams first half-season in MLS could be a rough ride. 

The playing fields of the US and Canada are not like the manicured lawns of Old Trafford or Santiago Bernabeu. Sometimes they are threadbare. Sometimes they are bumpy. Sometimes they are artificial. 

The perfect footing from which to launch those precise crosses and deadly free kicks will not always be there for Beckham. 

The players are not like the pampered and pedigreed practitioners at Manchester United or Real Madrid. Some of them are clumsy. Some of them are slow of foot and thought. Some of them are earning in a year what Beckham earns in the time it takes him to drive from Beverly Hills to Carson and back. 

In other words, Beckham cannot expect the players around him to read the game as quickly and seemingly as effortlessly as he does. In MLS, the play is more disjointed than smooth flowing. 

There will be the heat to deal with, as in scorching game-time temperatures. There will be the travel, the constant criss-crossing of a continent into which England and Spain combined could easily fit in one small corner. There will be the all-too-often suspect officiating and the all-too-often banal media questions. 

But it will be a grand adventure for Beckham, and if he can hold on to his national team place, help England qualify for Euro 2008 and take part in that tournament in Austria and Switzerland next summer, while at the same time helping raise soccers profile in the US, then he will have accomplished something few believed possible. 

The obstacles in his path, of course, are genuine, and the first of these is the matter of playing a winter game in summer and doing so in a vast, vast land. 

Beckham, like top athletes in any sport these days, is accustomed to travelling in style. For him, charter flights have always been the norm, whether he was playing for Manchester United, Real Madrid or England. 

Thats out the window now. The league has deemed that charter flights provide an unfair competitive advantage unless every team can afford to take them. But not every team is bankrolled by a billionaire and, as a result, the charter idea is grounded. 

Or it was until very recently. 

The new policy is that teams, on a case-by-case basis, can petition MLS to be allowed to use charters for security reasons, and the Galaxy has done so for their first extended trip to Toronto, Washington and New England in early August. 

It seems unlikely that the team will submit a petition for every trip, so Beckham should expect to travel on commercial airliners and travel a great deal. With the road games the Galaxy has packed into the second half of its season, he could rack up 15,000 to 20,000 air miles in the next four months, play-offs included. 

And then theres that long-haul flight to Australia for the November 27 friendly against Sydney FC, not to mention however many times he will have to fly back to England to rejoin the national team for Euro 2008 qualifying matches. That alone could add four or five 12,000-mile round trips. 

The travelling is huge, said New England Revolution goalkeeper Matt Reis. The 6-hour, 10-minute flight from Boston to Los Angeles is nothing to bat an eye about. Thats the big thing that a lot of the (European) players dont realise. The travelling is even more draining than the weather.

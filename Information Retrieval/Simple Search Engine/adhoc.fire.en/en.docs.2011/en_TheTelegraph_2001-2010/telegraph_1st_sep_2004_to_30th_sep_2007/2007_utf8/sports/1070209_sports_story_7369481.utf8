The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Shukla may lead in first two ties

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Allrounder Laxmi Ratan Shukla is likely to lead the 14-member Bengal squad for at least the first two matches, if not all, of the National one-dayers (East Zone) tournament starting in Cuttack on Sunday. There may be two other changes in the squad that played the Ranji Trophy final against Mumbai. 

Allrounder Priyankar Mukherjee and wicketkeeper-batsman Wriddhiman Saha may make the cut replacing openers Arindam Das and Amitava Chakraborty. 

Shukla is believed to be taking over the captaincy from Deep Dasgupta after the latter was banned for two one-day matches after being charged with a Level III offence for slow over-rate. 

If Laxmi leads the team in the first couple of matches and Bengal win, it wont look good to bring back Deep immediately, in that case Laxmi may lead all through, a CAB source said. 

LIKELY SQUAD 

Laxmi Ratan Shukla (captain), Rohan Gavaskar, Avishek Jhunjhunwala, Subhamoy Das, Manoj Tewari, Priyankar Mukherjee, Wriddhiman Saha, Sourashish Lahiri, Ranadeb Bose, Shib Shankar Paul, Ashok Dinda, Sourav Sarkar, Kamal Hasan Mondal, Shiv Sagar Singh. 15th man: Deep Dasgupta.

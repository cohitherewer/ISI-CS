 Its not a good idea to take guard outside leg when facing leg-spinners

 I am a right-hand batsman. I often take my eyes off short-pitched deliveries, and as a result, suffer blows on my body. How can I improve tackling such deliveries?

 (Ratan Chakraborty, 19, Calcutta)

 Keep your head still and watch the ball till the end.

 I am an allrounder. I feel I have been a victim of unjust selection to my district side. A player with lesser capabilities has been preferred instead of me. Since then I have failed to motivate myself and get my focus back. Please help.

 (A. Patra, Howrah-5)

 Dont ever lose heart. No pain, no gain. Get even more determined and your time will come.

 I am a right-arm medium pacer. What are the advantages and disadvantages of bowling for and against the wind?

 I am a right-hand batsman. Whenever I try to lift the ball over the boundary it doesnt reach too far. Is it due to less of bottomhand into the shot?

 (Tapan Pramanik, 19, Calcutta)

 Hitting sixes is not all about power. Timing is equally important. A good follow through will help.

 I am a medium pacer but often fail to maintain line and length. Should I sacrifice pace and concentrate on accuracy?

 Again keep a still head and focus on the spot you want the ball to land. It will help you a lot.

 I am a right-hand batsman. Is it wise to take guard outside the leg stump when facing leg spinners?

 (Aambit Saha, 17, Calcutta)

 Not a good idea. Stick to the basics.

 Be patient and stick to a solid line and bowl to your field.

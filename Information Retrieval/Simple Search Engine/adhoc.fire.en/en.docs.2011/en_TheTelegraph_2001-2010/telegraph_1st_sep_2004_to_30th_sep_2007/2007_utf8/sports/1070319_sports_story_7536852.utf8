 Inzamam must take the blame: Imran

Karachi: Former captain Imran Khan on Sunday squarely blamed Inzamam-ul Haq for Pakistans shock defeat to Ireland, which sent the former champions crashing out of the World Cup. 

I think this was one of the worst performances I have ever seen. It is unthinkable we should lose to Ireland, Imran said. A person makes his own luck. To say that luck didnt favour us is rubbish. 

Everyone knows that Inzamam as captain had all the authority to do what he wanted. The coach was there to support him. So, Inzamam is in the spotlight after this defeat, he added. 

The iconic Imran minced no words in demanding that Pakistan needed to appoint a new captain and coach with a vision who would be aggressive and innovative. 

The cricketer-turned-politician, who led Pakistan to their sole World Cup title in 1992, said the way Inzamam, Woolmer and the selectors had approached the preparations was a recipe for disaster. 

I am surprised at their short-sightedness. At the way they went about preparing for this tournament. The selections were shocking. 

I couldnt comprehend their decision not to play Danish Kaneria against Ireland, when everyone is aware that inexperienced teams find it difficult to play quality leg-spin, he said. 

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has been functioning on an ad-hoc basis since 1999 with the countrys President, Pervez Musharraf, directly appointing the chairman of the board. 

This system must change. What qualification does the President have to make such important cricket appointments. We need to run the Board constitutionally and professionally, Imran added. 

What do you expect? They were unable to find a settled opening pair for the last two years. They bring in Imran Nazir for an important event like the World Cup when he has been out of international cricket for the last three years, he said. 

I couldnt understand his selection when Pakistan had talented players like Salman Butt and Yasir Hameed waiting in the wings. 

I sincerely believe the selectors and team management have done great injustice to Butt and Yasir, he added. 

Imran, a veteran of 88 Tests and 175 one-day Internationals said the time was ripe to bring about positive changes in the set-up.

 SA-BANGLA REVIEW

Mohammed Ashrafuls 87 is the highest by a Bangladesh batsman in the World Cup (WC). He went past Minhajul Abedins unbeaten 68 against Scotland at Edinburgh on 24 May, 1999. It marked the eighth 50 by a Bangladesh batsman in WC. The score is also the best by a Bangladeshi against the South Africans. 

The 54-run stand between Ashraful and Mashrafe Mortaza is Bangladeshs best for the seventh wicket in WC. The pair went past the previous best of 44 between Minhajul Abedin and Khaled Mashud against Australia at Chester-le-Street in 1999. 

Playing in his 58th ODI, South Africas Andre Nel claimed his maiden five wicket haul (5/45). 

This is only the second instance of a five-wicket haul in 2007 World Cup. His teammate Charl Langeveldt had claimed 5/39 against Sri Lanka at this venue last month. 

However, unfortunately for Nel, it is also the seventh time a bowler has finished on the losing side despite taking five wickets in a WC match. The other bowlers are: Gary Gilmour (Aus), Kapil Dev (Ind), Ashantha de Mel (SL), Saqlain Mushtaq (Pak), Rudi van Vuuren (Nam) and Shane Bond (NZ). For the record, only Bond (6/23) has a six wicket haul in a losing cause. 

Bangladeshs 251/8 is their highest ever total in World Cup, surpassing the previous best of 223/9 against Pakistan at Nottingham on 31 May, 1999. Incidentally, Bangladesh won both the matches. 

It is also Bangladeshs highest total against South Africa, bettering the 211 it made at Dhaka on 14 April, 2003. 

Shaun Pollock (3006) became the 11th South African to aggregate 3000 runs in ODIs. With 377 wickets to his credit, he is only the second allrounder after Pakistans Wasim Akram (3717 runs and 502 wickets) to do the rare double of 3000 runs and 300 wickets in ODIs. 

Bangaldeshs 67 run win is their best against any Test team (excluding Zimbabwe) in ODIs and it is also their best ever in any WC match. 

This victory was Bangladeshs 36th in 155 ODIs. Against top cricketing nations, they have now beaten India (twice), Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Australia and South Africa. 

It was also Bangladeshs 26th win in the last 40 ODIs since January 2006. Only Australia (32 wins in 47 matches) have won more ODIs than Bangladesh in the last 15 months.

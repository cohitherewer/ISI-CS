 Flintoff, Pietersen must score big: Viv 

 Viv Richards 

St Johns: West Indian great Sir Viv Richards has said England badly need a big performance from Andrew Flintoff in their key World Cup clash against champions Australia here on Sunday. 

Allrounder Flintoff, the star of Englands 2005 Ashes series win, hit the headlines in the Caribbean when he was dropped for the game against Canada and stripped of the vice-captaincy after staying out late drinking following the sides defeat against New Zealand. 

Although his bowling has held up he tops Englands averages in the tournament with nine wickets at just under 15 apiece Flintoffs batting has been a letdown with a mere 45 runs scored from three innings. 

And in Englands nail-biting two-run defeat against Sri Lanka here on Wednesday, Flintoff managed just two runs. 

If England, who under Flintoffs leadership in the absence of the injured Michael Vaughan shocked hosts Australia in Februarys tri-series finals, are to end their oldest foes perfect played-five, won-five record at this World Cup, Richards believes the star allrounder has to be at his best. 

England are going to need him to hit form more than anything else on Sunday, said the former West Indies captain. It is the perfect opportunity and ever since the Ashes victory in England, we havent heard that much from Flintoff. 

Especially with some of the stuff that went on, with the disciplinary side of things, you guys would forget that quite easily if he went out and took England to the top. You guys would say all is forgiven. 

Ive always rated him as one of the top-flight allrounders in the world and he needs to come to the front. We know hes a strong hitter and a magnificent timer of a cricket ball and when hes on song, hes someone I love to see play, with his aggression. 

Richards also said England needed a big score from Kevin Pietersen, now rated the worlds best ODI batsman. 

The South Africa-born shot-maker top-scored with 58 against Sri Lanka before being caught and bowled by Muttiah Muralidharan, but Richards said England needed more from their top order star. 

I heard him say he would like to turn his 50s into more hundreds. He had a great opportunity against Sri Lanka but he may have another one tomorrow (Sunday). 

I love to see someone like him whose presence, not necessarily arrogance, means so much to bowlers. 

Long may he live, because I think in this sport we need attractive and entertaining players like him. He needs to step up a bit and he will be aware there are not many better places to do it than against Australia on Sunday.

 BCCI stand unfair: Kapil

New Delhi: Kapil Dev on Saturday hit back at the BCCI for threatening to impose life bans on players aligning with the Indian Cricket League (ICL), saying such a stand was unfair and would only scare players. 

Kapil, chairman of the ICLs executive board, also took a dig at BCCI president Sharad Pawar by questioning his commitment to cricket. 

I am disappointed. They are trying to scare players when people of the country want to play cricket. It is not fair for the BCCI secretary, Niranjan Shah, to say things like these. He must be having his reasons but thats not the way to react, he told a TV channel on Saturday. 

Shah had said on Friday that any player signing up for the ICL would be banned for life. 

Kapil also gave a tongue-in-cheek reply to Pawars reported comments that the former Indian captain was busy with other activities and had little time for the National Cricket Academy of which he is the chairman. He is a senior politician and has an important ministry. Does he have enough time for cricket? Kapil said. (PTI)

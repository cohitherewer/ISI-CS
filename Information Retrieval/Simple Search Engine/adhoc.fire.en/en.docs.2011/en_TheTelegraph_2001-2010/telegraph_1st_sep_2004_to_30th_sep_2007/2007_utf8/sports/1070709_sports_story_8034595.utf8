 HawkEye set for English football

London: The Premier League is set to test HawkEye technology in football with a view to removing doubts over goal-line decisions, the chief of the company that makes the product has said. 

 The ball-tracking system, which is already used in cricket and tennis, will initially be put to the test at Readings academy and then tried out next season but not used by the officials. 

Paul Hawkins, managing director of HawkEye Innovations, told the BBC: We have a contract with the Premier League to develop a system purely to resolve the dispute whether the ball crossed the line, purely for the referee and not for television. 

The process is to be evaluated by the Premier League and then by Fifa, if we jump those hurdles then the end aim is to have it installed in all Premier League grounds, hopefully. 

HawkEye was brought in for this years Wimbledon Championships although its reliability has been questioned. 

Those in favour of technology in football point to ending the argument in instances such as Chelseas Champions League defeat to Liverpool when it was unclear whether Luis Garcias strike had crossed the line. 

Hawkins believes the technology could be a part of the Premier League within two years if tests go according to plan and it receives Fifas approval. 

He added: It will be tested next month and the process will evolve from there. It took a couple of years in tennis from the start of tests to it being used and we can probably expect the same time frame.

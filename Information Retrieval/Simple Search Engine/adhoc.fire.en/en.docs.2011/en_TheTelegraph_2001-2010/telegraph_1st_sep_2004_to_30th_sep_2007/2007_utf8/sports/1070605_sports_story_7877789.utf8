Her long blond ponytail soaked with sweat, Maria Sharapova stood at midcourt Sunday, smiling and blowing kisses to the crowd booing her. Sharapova, seeded second, advanced to the French Open quarter finals for the third time in her career. She played in front of a hostile crowd that supported Patty Schnyder. 

The stadium rumbled with jeers as Sharapova defeated Schnyder in a tense fourth-round match 3-6, 6-4, 9-7, as reported in Mondays Late City edition. 

The svelte Russian struck the ball with unrelenting power for two hours 37 minutes, eventually saving two match points. Still, the fans, reacting to what they perceived to be an earlier moment of poor sportsmanship, seemed to see nothing but a villain in a blue clingy tennis dress. 

Its tough playing tennis and being Mother Teresa at the same time and making everyone happy, Sharapova said, unemotionally, after the match. She will play No. 9-seeded Anna Chakvetadze, who defeated No. 25 Lucie Safarova in three sets on Sunday. 

By then, the fans may have settled down. On Sunday, even Schnyder failed to persuade the audience to quell its anger. As the spectators booed, she lifted her right index finger to her lips, to try to hush them. But her effort was useless. 

In the third set, those catcalls had reached ear-splitting decibels. As Sharapova was serving with the score 7-7, 30-0, a fan shouted. Rattled, Schnyder had lifted her hand to indicate that she was not ready, but the serve had already landed on her side of the net. When the umpire refused to replay the point, and Sharapova did not offer to do so, the crowd erupted. 

Sharapova said she never considered offering to replay that point, considering the closeness of the match. Later, Schnyder did not complain. 

I was distracted, and it was the publics choice to do it; I didnt boo, Schnyder said. I think we should appreciate the champion she is. 

She added: At the end, she was the big champion. Im the little one who could not win. 

Schnyder, who is ranked 15th in the world, ended the match with a forehand that flew wide. On the opposite side of the court, Sharapova buried her face in her hands as emotions washed over her. 

She held her fist to her chest as she looked around the stands, seemingly deaf to the crowds angry roars. Though she looked on the verge of tears, she denied it later, saying she was simply grateful to have won. 

In other fourth-round matches Sunday, No. 1 Justine Henin and No. 8 Serena Williams both won their matches, setting up a rematch of the 2003 semi-final here. That match four years ago was similar to Sharapovas match Sunday. 

There was jeering and a disputed call for time that added to the intensity of a crowd that was already on Henins side. Williams left the court in tears. Henin left with her first Grand Slam title. 

But much has changed since that emotionally charged match, which signified the best moment of Henins career and the worst of Williams. 

Both say they have matured since then. Ive been through death, Williams said. I had surgery I think since then. Ive been through a lot. 

Williams, the 2002 French Open champion, said she had become more cynical since 2003. Her half-sister Yetunde Price was murdered that year. Also, left-knee problems resulted in surgery and have plagued her career. Last year, Williams nearly fell out of the top 100 because of those injuries. 

This year, though, she came back to win the Australian Open, ranked 81st. It takes a strong person to be at the bottom of the barrel, said Williams, 25. I was really down there, and its hard to be able to come back, especially when everyone seems against you and you have so many doubters.

 Another cyclist tests positive

Gourette (France): The Tour de France sustained a new blow on Wednesday after a senior French doping official said yet another rider failed a doping test, this time for testosterone. 

The revelation came a day after Alexandre Vinokourov and his Astana team were disqualified because he tested positive for a banned blood transfusion. 

The doping official said he did not know the identity of the cyclist who tested positive for testosterone. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to discuss the case.

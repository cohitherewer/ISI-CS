The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Try and play inswinging deliveries straight

 - Dont attempt anything flashy early in the innings

Ravi Shastri

 I always face problems when driving against the spin. What is the best way to tackle such deliveries?

 (Sampark Roy, 18, Calcutta) 

 Get as close to the pitch of the ball as possible so that you can smother the spin. Also ensure that the head is on top of the ball.

 I am a righthanded batsman and struggle at the start of my innings. As I settle down I gradually grow in confidence. How do I overcome such early jitters?

 (Rohit Banerjee, 16, Calcutta-42) 

 It is a common thing so don rsquo;t worry. Concentrate hard and tell yourself that you are not going to try anything flashy till you get your eye in. Be selective in your shot-making early on.

 I am a lefthanded batsman. When attempting the sweep, the ball always balloons up near the short-midwicket region. Why does this happen?

 (Rajib Saha, 19, Kharagpur) 

 Roll your wrists at the time of impact and let your weight go into the shot. Be careful that you are not sweeping against the spin.

 I am a left-arm spinner. What should be the ideal length when bowling on crumbling pitches?

 (Soham Pal, 22, Calcutta-17) 

 Get the batsman playing forward all the time by bowling a middle-stump line. It rsquo;s okay if he drives you occasionally.

 I am a righthanded batsman. I am uncomfortable against fast bowlers since I struggle against shortpitched stuff. Please help.

 (Surojit Roy, 25, Calcutta-17) 

 Don rsquo;t take your eyes off the ball. Also try and move a little early so that you have more time.

 I am a mediumpacer. Should I pitch the ball on the offstump when bowling the outswinger and inswingers?

 (Rana Deb, 18, Calcutta-41) 

 Offstump for an outswinger and just outside for the inswinger is ideal.

 I am a mediumpacer. Despite repeated efforts to correct my run-up, I have failed. As a result, there has been no respite in the increasing number of no balls. How do I measure my run-up? Please help.

 (Subir Gupta, 19, Calcutta-24) 

 This is where you have to work with your coach seriously at the nets. Try not to bowl a no ball at the nets. Also bowl from half a foot behind and see if it works.

 I am a righthanded batsman. Often I am out hit wicket when trying to defend a bouncer. Please help. 

 (Rajat Dutta, Calcutta) 

 You are obviously taking your eyes of the ball and getting too far back in the crease.

 I am a righthanded batsman. I often misjudge the balls that are to be left outside the offstump. What rule should I follow when judging such balls? 

 (Rohit Jhunjhunwala, 22, Calcutta-25) 

 You rsquo;ve got to know where your offstump is and work with your coach on the guard you take.

 I am lefthanded batsman. I often fall leg before to inswinging deliveries. Why does this happen? 

 (Sanjay Prasad, 18, Calcutta-21) 

 You are falling over too much. Also you may be playing across the line. Try and play straighter.

 Gibson takes 10 wickets in an innings

 London: 

 Former West Indies Test pacer Ottis Gibson created a little 

 piece of history Sunday when he took 10 wickets in an innings 

 in an English County Championship match.

 The 38-year-old veteran, playing 

 for Durham, achieved the landmark by bowling out Hampshire 

 for 115 in their first innings, finishing with figures of 

 10 for 47 off 17.3 overs.

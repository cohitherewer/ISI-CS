 Pound flays PGA Tour

Carnoustie: Dick Pound, the head of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), has supported Gary Players claims that some golfers take drugs and has criticised the PGA Tour for refusing to acknowledge there may be a problem. 

Player, a three-time Open champion, estimated that at least 10 and quite possibly more players were using performance-enhancing drugs. 

That is certainly my suspicion, and Gary Player says he knows, so thats fairly powerful medicine from somebody who has only the integrity of the game at heart, Pound told BBC radio on Sunday. 

I dont know how widespread it is, as there is no testing at the moment, Pound. But key players and officials are telling me we need a policy in place before we have a major public problem. 

Pound backed the 71-year-old South African, saying: That comes from one of the icons of golf, who has no particular axe to grind out there now, other than to try and maintain the integrity of the sport. 

So its a wake-up call that has not come in such stark terms to date from the golf community.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Unhealthy precedent

 - No assurance that supreme body wont intervene again 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Mumbai: Its an unhealthy precedent... If the working committee is to give directives, then why have a selection panel? asked Ajit Wadekar, former India captain, coach and chief selector. 

Fuming, he added: What has happened over the past fortnight is unfortunate... Besides resting Sachin (Tendulkar) and Sourav (Ganguly), what have the selectors done? Im happy for young Manoj Tewari, but a 30-year-old (Dinesh Mongia) has been recalled when the directive was to pick a young team! Its beyond me... 

Speaking to The Telegraph on the morning after the selectors did the needful for next months tour of Bangladesh, Wadekar said Dilip Vengsarkar and Co. were expected to know best and, should things go amiss, they would face the music and not the working committee. 

I would have retained both Sachin and Sourav as they add value and, as important, guide the team at a difficult time... Im surprised theyve been rested, but (Virender) Sehwag is still in the one-day side... Again, I cant make anything of that selection... 

The directive didnt please the selectors, but nobody actually made an issue of it. We understand its a one-off thing, lets see if theres a repeat... In any case, its the Board which appoints us... Id rather wait for what happens after Bangladesh, is how one put it. 

After the meeting, though, Board secretary Niranjan Shah gave no assurance that the working committee wouldnt again intervene. Rather, he pointedly reminded that it was the supreme body. 

Its relevant, perhaps, that three of the five selectors have big roles in their respective associations and wouldnt like to rock the boat: Chairman Vengsarkar is a vice-president of the Mumbai body, Ranjib Biswal heads Orissa and Sanjay Jagdale is the Madhya Pradesh secretary. 

Board president Sharad Pawar is also the Mumbai supremo. 

Incidentally, Sachin and Sourav werent available for a comment. Sachins not feeling well, informed wife Anjali rather early in the day, while Souravs mobiles kept ringing. 

After the recent showcauses, both may not utter a word. Big Brother, after all, could be around with a bigger and sharper axe.

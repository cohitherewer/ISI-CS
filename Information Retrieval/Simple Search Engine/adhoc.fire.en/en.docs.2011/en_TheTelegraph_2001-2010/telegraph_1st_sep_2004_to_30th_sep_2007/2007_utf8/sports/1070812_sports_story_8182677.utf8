 Lahore to stay host

Karachi: The International Hockey Federation (FIH) has decided not to shift the Champions Trophy from Lahore this year despite the pullout of Australia. 

FIH secretary Peter Cohan told a Pakistan newspaper that the tournament would be held on schedule in Lahore from December 1-9 and the FIH had no security concerns. 

The decision came after a meeting of the FIH executive board in Beijing on Friday. 

Great Britain, according to the FIH rankings, should replace Australia. (PTI)

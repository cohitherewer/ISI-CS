 Shanker in sole lead

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: International Master (IM) Shanker Roy shot into sole lead at the Alekhine Chess Club organised Bengal Peerless Fide rating chess tournament. He has 4 points after four rounds. 

Playing with white pieces he faced the Queens Indian Defence of IM R. Balasubramanium. Shanker made a temporary knight sacrifice in the centre to gain the double bishop advantage. Thereafter with all his pieces breathing fire on the kingside he won a minor piece and forced his opponent to throw in the towel on the 35th move. 

The top board game ended in a tame draw. IM Abdullah Al Rakib of Bangladesh sacrificed a pawn in the opening to drum up some complications against Shyam Nikhil, but the young boy defended accurately and Rakib was forced to take the peace offering after only 16 moves. 

WGM Nisha Mohta she held the advantage throughout the game against Vinoth Kumar in an old Indian Defence. She was, however, unable to crack through the defences of Kumar. 

GM Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh bounced back into the reckoning with a thumping 34 move victory over local player Laltu Chatterjee. 

IM elect Saptarshi Roy and IM Suvrajit Saha also had crushing victories against Tanmoy Pattanayak and Joydev Saha, respectively.

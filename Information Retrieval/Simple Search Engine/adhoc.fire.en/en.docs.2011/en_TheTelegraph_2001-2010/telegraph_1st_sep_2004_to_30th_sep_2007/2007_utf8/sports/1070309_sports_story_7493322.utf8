 Gloster: Sourav absolutely fit

Former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly was hit

 by pacer Sreesanth during nets on Thursday. However, physio John Gloster told The

 Telegraph there was absolutely no cause for any concern. Sourav batted for quite a while afterwards and he is absolutely fit, he said. Sourav, therefore, should take the field in Fridays

 warm-up match against the West Indies.

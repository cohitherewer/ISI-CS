 WICB: We believe Samuels is clean 

Port-of-Spain: The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) has thrown its weight behind the beleaguered Marlon Samuels, while the worried West Indies Players Association (WIPA) has said it is ready to help the WICB educate the cricketers on anti-corruption and anti-doping codes. 

The WICB said it believes Samuels is clean, but will carry out an honest and transparent investigation and until there is evidence of Samuels alleged leaking of team information, no action will be taken against the allrounder. 

Being faced with such a situation would be quite difficult to deal with, so we want to assure the young man that we will support him, WICB president Ken Gordon said. We believe our player is clean and until there is evidence to say otherwise, there will be no sanctions against him. 

Earlier, WICB spokesperson Tony Deyal had said that the inquiry would be consistent with the law and appropriate action would be taken.

 Sharath wins title in North Korea

New Delhi: Indias top paddler Achanta Sharath Kamal showed red hot form as he prevailed over a tough field to win the singles title in the 21st Pyongyang Invitational tournament, held in North Korea from August 30-September 3. 

Though the win in an invitational meet would not push him above his current world ranking of 74, nevertheless it will be a huge boost for Sharath as the tournament featured players from seven countries, including China, Hong Kong, Singapore and host North Korea. 

The Chennai player showed guts and nerves of steel as he came through three seven-setters in the pre quarters, quarters and final. 

The hosts suffered Sharaths fury as their top four players, including the defending champion, ended up at the wrong end of the table from pre quarter final onwards. 

Sharath stunned defending champion Kim Chol Jin 4-11, 11-8, 11-9, 7-11, 6-11, 12-10, 11-4 in the round of 16. 

Sharath showed great character in the quarter final as he saved four match points en route to a 13-11, 4-11, 6-11, 8-11, 11-7, 11-9, 15-13 win against Chang Sang Mau. 

The semi-final was relatively easier as Sharath went past Pi Chol Cuk 6-11, 12-10, 11-4, 11-9, 11-4. 

And in the final, he beat North Koreas top player Kim Hyok Bong 10-12, 12-10, 5-11, 11-8, 13-15, 11-8, 11-6. 

This is a great win for me. The field was tough and North Korean players are very good. They do not play outside their country and that is the reason they are not high in world rankings, Sharath said.

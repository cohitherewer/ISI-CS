The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dhoni gets past Ponting, up to No.2

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Indias dashing wicketkeeper-batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni is now the No. 2 ODI batsman. 

In the latest LG ICC Player Rakings for ODI batsmen, Dhoni has overtaken Australian skipper Ricky Ponting, who did not play in Australias 0-3 series defeat to New Zealand, which concluded on Tuesday. Ponting, now at third spot, is just one rating point ahead of Englands Kevin Pietersen. 

The 25-year-old has just completed a successful four-match series against Sri Lanka, having scored 115 runs in two innings, including a match-winning 67 not out in the third ODI at Margao. He is now averaging 46.61 in ODIs with a remarkable career strike-rate of 98.49. 

Dhonis teammate Yuvraj Singh is up five places to 15th position, now just two places behind Rahul Dravid while Sachin Tendulkar slid one place from 19th position to barely manage his place in the top 20. 

Stand-in captain for Australia Michael Hussey is still occupying the top spot and is the only batsman currently holding more than 800 ratings points (817). 

Meanwhile, the West Indies all-rounder, Chris Gayle, has moved up two places to number five in the LG ICC Player Ratings for ODI batsmen while other players on an upward move include Matthew Hayden (up 11 places to 23rd spot) and Stephen Fleming (up four places to 24 th ). 

Following New Zealands clean sweep of Australia, Flemings side has moved ahead of Pakistan into third place in the LG ICC ODI Championship, a timely boost for the team ahead of the upcoming ICC Cricket World Cup in the West Indies. 

South Africas talismanic mediumpacer Shaun Pollock now has a phenomenal 157 ratings points clear at the top of the ICC player rankings for ODI bowlers.

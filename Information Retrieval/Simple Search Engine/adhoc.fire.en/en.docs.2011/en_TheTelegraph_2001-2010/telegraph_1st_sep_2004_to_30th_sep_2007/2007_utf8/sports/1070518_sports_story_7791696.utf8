The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Fans enraged by ticket fiasco

DAVID BOND

Wembley and the Football Association (FA) were facing fresh accusations of incompetence on Wednesday after it emerged that with two days to go to the first FA Cup final at the new arena, hundreds of executive club fans are still waiting for their tickets. 

 Club Wembley members Wednesday jammed the stadiums phone lines demanding to know when they would receive their tickets for the eagerly anticipated showdown between Chelsea and Manchester United on Saturday. 

But by Wednesday night, at least 400 of the 6,000 individuals and firms who have spent up to 10,000 on 10-year licences to enable them to buy tickets for games at the new 800 million arena, were still waiting to know if they would be able to get into the game. 

Wembley staff were forced to work through the night on Wednesday to clear the backlog which was caused by a breakdown in the computer system.

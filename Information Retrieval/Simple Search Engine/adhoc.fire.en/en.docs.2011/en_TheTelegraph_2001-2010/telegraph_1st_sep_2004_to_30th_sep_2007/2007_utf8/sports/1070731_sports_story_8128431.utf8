 Sania, Shahar clinch doubles crown

 Sania Mirza 

Stanford: Sania Mirza stumbled at the final hurdle as she was tamed by top-seed Anna Chakvetadze of Russia in the final of the $600,000 Stanford Classic WTA event here, as reported in Mondays Late City edition. 

Sania, who was defeated by the Russian in the Cincinnati semi-finals last week, once again surrendered to the might of Chakvetadze, who notched up a convincing 6-3, 6-2 victory for her second title in as many weeks. 

However, some consolation was in store for Sania who combined with Shahar Peer of Israel to grab the doubles crown. In the final, the Indo-Israeli pair defeated Victoria Azarenka of Belarus and Chakvetadze 6-4, 7-6 (7-5). 

Sania, who had upset two top 20 players Patty Schnyder and Tatiana Golovin on her way to the final, appeared too tired to pose any threat to superior Chakvetadze. 

After the match, Sania admitted that she was completely drained and could not give her best. 

Yes, I am (tired). Both mentally and physically. In the first set, I was there but I just could not string games together. I was a little tentative, hoping she would make mistakes. Today (Sunday) I was not hitting the ball as clean as I was this week. After I lost the first set, she just dominated the match. 

Even on changeovers, we were sitting there and you could just tell how tired we both were. But I played consistent tennis this week and I am confident that I can continue to do that in future tournaments, she said. 

Sania, who received huge support, said Chakvetadze proved her toughness in adverse situations. 

She plays better when people are against her. I think that pumped her up more. Some people like it, some dont and maybe she is one that does, Sania said. 

The 35th-ranked Hyderabadi said her immediate goal would be break into the top 20. 

I believe in realistic goals. I am a very practical person. That is why I have always said the top-20 is my goal. 

In order to achieve her aim of improving individual rankings, Sania said she could cut down on her doubles appearances. 

I did that during the end of last year. It is possible to stop playing as much doubles when you continue to go deep into the tournaments. I dont know yet but I may consider it, she said. 

After a successful week that brought her some memorable individual wins and a doubles title, Sania said, I have not had much time to celebrate. I have not even had dinner outside of my hotel room once this week.

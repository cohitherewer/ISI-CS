 Minnows add charm, character

 Rahul Dravid 

Montego Bay: Contrary to the view of some of his counterparts, Team India captain Rahul Dravid said minnows should be a part of the World Cup for they add character and charm to the competition. 

They add a lot of character and charm to the event, Dravid said after helping his team clinch a huge 182-run win against The Netherlands in their first warm-up match here. 

Former West Indian tearaway Michael Holding and Australian captain Ricky Ponting believe the presence of the second-tier teams devalued the mega-event. 

Dravid said it was important to encourage the associate members by offering them the platform to grow and overcome difficulties. 

I think you have to encourage them to play and, having myself played a season in Scotland, I know the difficulties the associate nations and their players go through to play this game. 

Many of them are amateurs, and take time off from work to play the game, and keep it alive in their countries, so I think the International Cricket Council has to do a lot to help them and not just give them opportunities in tournaments like this, he said. 

The ICC has to identify four or five nations outside the top eight or nine, and ensure that they can get them up to a standard and provide them with the latest facilities, training, and games to ensure that they are at least semi-professionals which will help them improve their standards, he added. 

The Netherlands captain Luuk van Troost echoed Dravids sentiments, saying his team would justify their presence here. 

We deserve to be here. We were just a bit nervous in this match (against India), Van Troost said. 

We worked hard, we qualified, and I am sure we will show in the rest of the tournament that we have a right to be here, he added. 

Van Troost also predicted that the minnows would upset one of the Test playing nations and make their critics eat their own words.

 Inzy was a dictator: Akram 

New Delhi: Wasim Akram has said former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haqs dictatorial ways had contributed to the teams decline. 

Inzy definitely had become a dictator. He had obviously become very powerful, Akram said. 

I know for a fact that Bob Woolmer and the foreign back-up staff would approach him for leave. 

I have seen senior PCB officials sitting at his residence awaiting orders. These things are not good for cricket, he told a television sports channel. 

A captain must first win the trust of his teammates, get some victories under his belt and power will automatically come. You dont have to clamour for power, Akram said. 

Akram also backed Shoaib Malik as Pakistans next captain. 

With Younis Khan declining the captaincy, Akram said Pakistan have little to choose from. 

The only ones who can handle the job are Mohammed Yousuf and Shoaib Malik. He is a good choice. He is young and talented, Akram said. 

We should back him and groom this lad. I dont think we have much of a choice if Younis is not interested. 

Younis has told the Pakistan Cricket Board that he did not want to take over from Inzamam, who stepped down following the teams exit from the World Cup.

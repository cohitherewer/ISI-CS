The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 EB firm favourites vs Md. Sp.

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Top class competition will return to Punjab after 33 years when the 29th edition of the Federation Cup kicks off at Ludhianas Guru Nanak Stadium on Tuesday. 

The last time Punjab staged a major tournament was in 1974 when the hosts humiliated Bengal 6-0 in the Santosh Trophy final. 

Unique for its knock-out format, this years Federation Cup can prove to be even more interesting with the national players, fresh from the Nehru Cup triumph, making their first appearance this season. The presence of top players should rekindle spectators interest in Ludhiana, famous for its woollen trade than promoting football. 

From the 16 teams in fray, holders Mohun Bagan, East Bengal, Mumbais Mahindra United and Dempo Sports Club, Goa are favourites while the home side JCT being considered the dark horse. 

The opening day will see two matches. While JCT will take on Vasco in the opener, two Calcutta teams, East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting, will battle it out under lights in the second outing. 

Given their current form, JCT are overwhelming favourites against their Goan rivals. With national players Sunil Chhetri and Rennedy Singh back in the squad, Sukhwinder Singhs boys should have an easy run against a weak Vasco, who were found struggling in the Goa League. 

Things should also be easy for East Bengal, who had routed Mohammedan Sporting 6-2 only recently in the CFL Premier Division. 

The red and yellow brigade is further strengthened by the induction of the four India team players Rahim Nabi, Subrata Paul, Surkumar Singh and Debabrata Roy something that will give coach Subrata Bhattacharya more options to experiment with. 

Defending champions Mohun Bagan can once again hope for a good show with Bhaichung Bhutia back in the line up to pair up with mercurial Brazilian striker Jose Barreto. 

The Calcutta team, however, would have to play with a weakened defence as their two India stalwarts Deepak Mondal and N.S. Manju are set to miss the tournament because of injuries. 

Dependence on foreigners, of late, has become a trend in Indian football and it is unlikely to be any different this time. 

If Mohun Bagan and East Bengal heavily bank on their Brazilian strikers Barreto and Edmilson to deliver the goods, things are no different with other teams. 

Almost all the participating clubs in the Federation Cup have a foreigner, though the only exception being ONGC, Air India and Army XI. 

On paper, Dempo have the most impressive side which includes Mahesh Gawali, Climax Lawrence, Clifford Miranda and Anthony Pereira. 

However, they will look forward to their Nigerian duo Ranty Martins and Edeh Chidi to help them win their second title in four years. 

TUESDAYS MATCHES: JCT vs Vasco (3.30 pm) and East Bengal vs Md Sporting (6.30 pm)

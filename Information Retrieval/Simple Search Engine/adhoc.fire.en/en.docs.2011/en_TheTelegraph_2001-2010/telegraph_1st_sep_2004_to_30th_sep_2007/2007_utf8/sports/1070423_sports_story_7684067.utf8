 All dreams havent been fulfilled: Lara 

Bridgetown: Brian Lara walked out of international cricket in defeat. And it had nothing to do with the one-wicket, next-to-last ball World Cup loss to England. Lara admitted his mission to restore the West Indies to the top of world cricket had failed. 

Bidding farewell to international cricket after 17 years as a West Indies player, Lara said he wanted to open the door for a younger leader to take charge of the Caribbean squad. 

I feel its the right time to call it a day, and let the youngsters take over, Lara said, trying to keep his emotions in check as he addressed reporters for the last time as a West Indies skipper and player. Ive given a thought to life without a bat in my hand. Ive been playing a long time, but I knew it had to come to an end somewhere. 

Lara said the West Indies team, which was the worlds best when he started his career, needed new blood to make it a credible challenger to the likes of Australia, South Africa, India and Pakistan. 

Lara also lamented the dream of taking Caribbean cricket back to the top had remained unfulfilled. 

Not all my dreams have been fulfilled. From the very first time I played cricket, my dream was to see the West Indies back on top of the sport. Unfortunately, that has not happened and we have not been able to stop that decline in the last 10-12 years. Thats the most disappointing thing, he said. Im a team player and if theres one thing I have great hope for its to see this West Indies team back at the top. 

He admitted he wouldnt be the player to do it. West Indies cricket is a place where change is necessary, he said. I see no reason for me to carry on at this point of time. I dont see myself regretting the decision and look to enjoy my life outside cricket. 

During the hour-long press conference, with daughter Sydney sitting in as well, Lara heaped rich encomiums on the India captain Rahul Dravid. Rahul Dravid is one player I could go and watch. Come to think of it, if I wanted someone batting for my life, it would be Rahul. 

Reflecting on his recent tour of India, in January, Lara said: The last time I was in India, there was a fan waiting for us, just crying because he would not see me play again. I remember places like Cuttack, playing there in West Indies colours, for what it meant to be a West Indian cricketer. 

Lara, however, refused to rule out a return to first class cricket. Asked whether he would consider playing in county cricket, Lara said: I just need to walk out of this room and think, go home and relax for a little while. Im not writing anything off but at this present time I am just happy to have played for the West Indies. 

I dont know what the future holds on the cricket field, youve just got to wait and see, he said. 

Lara, who turns 38 next month, ended his international career with a one-wicket defeat off the penultimate delivery as England reached 301 for 9 in reply to the West Indies 300 all out. 

Laras final innings also ended in disappointment he got run out for 18 during a mix up with Marlon Samuels. The left-handed said he was moved by the fond farewell given to him by a capacity crowd at the Kensington Oval in his last match for the West Indies. 

The fans gave an emotional farewell to me, it brought tears to my eyes, he said. Im always going to cherish memories like this, the affection I got from cricket fans whom I sought to entertain. 

The big scores were my destiny, Im a very lucky man who got the privilege to represent the West Indies for 17 years. To hold a bat for that long was what Im proud of. 

Lara said he was glad to leave by choice, and not get pushed out of international cricket. 

Ive had the opportunity to decide when to say goodbye. Ive seen players like Vivian Richards, Gordon Greenidge and Malcolm Marshall ... they all wanted to go an extra step. (Agencies)

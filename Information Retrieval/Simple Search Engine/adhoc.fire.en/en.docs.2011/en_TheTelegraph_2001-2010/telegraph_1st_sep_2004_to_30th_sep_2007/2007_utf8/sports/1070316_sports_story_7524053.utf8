 Now we have to do the hard yards: Woolmer

Kingston: Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer pledged that his team would put in the hard yards to salvage their World Cup campaign which suffered a setback at the hands of the West Indies in the tournament opener. 

The West Indies won the group D clash at Sabina Park by 54 runs leaving Pakistan, the 1992 champions, needing to ensure their place in the Super Eight by beating Zimbabwe and Ireland. 

Victory on Tuesday also gave the hosts two crucial points to take through to the Super Eight stage. 

It was our goal to take the two points through but we now will have to do the hard yards, said Woolmer. 

The first goal is to get into the Super Eight and then lets see what happens from there. Pakistans build-up to the world cup has been dogged by problems.Pace spearheads Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif, who were both at the centre of a doping scandal, were ruled out on the eve of the tournament because of injury. Experienced allrounder Abdul Razzaq also limped out of contention. 

But Pakistan would have fancied their chances of victory on Tuesday after restricting the West Indies to 241 in their 50 overs. 

Woolmer admitted his teams batting just wasnt up to scratch. Our batting was disappointing because the West Indies bowled with great discipline and we struggled to get on top, said the coach. But like all games there were a number of crucial moments. Ramnaresh Sarwan (49) and Marlon Samuels (63) were two important innings although I thought generally we bowled and fielded well. 

Its too early to talk about being in tight corners. Lets make sure we remain positive for the rest of the tournament. 

Pakistan face debutants Ireland on Saturday and Woolmer said he was impressed by what he saw when they had South Africa struggling at 92 for eight in a warm-up last week before the world No. 1 team recovered to claim a narrow victory. 

I have watched Ireland and I have been impressed by their discipline in the games against South Africa and Canada. I will watch them today (when the Irish face Zimbabwe) again after our practice. (AFP)

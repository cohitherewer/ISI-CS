 Shane Bond aims to be agent 001

St Johns: Shane Bond has made it clear he wants to be known as the best bowler in the world. 

The New Zealand quick, whose career has been blighted by injury, revealed his personal goal after turning in another impressive World Cup display during the nine-wicket victory against Bangladesh which left the Black Caps level on points in the standings with Australia. 

Its driven me since my first tour of Australia (in 2001-02), its always been a goal to be No. 1 bowler in the world, Bond, 31, said after taking two for 15 in 10 overs on Monday. 

However, the former policeman insisted his sides ambition came first. 

My personal milestones will be meaningful only if my performances help us win. Thats all that matters. 

During this World Cup Bond who spent several years on the sidelines with feet, back and knee problems has been miserly with the new ball before returning for a second spell that has usually yielded at least one key wicket. 

Bowling with the new ball is the most important phase, making adjustments to the pitch and doing so quickly enough, Bond explained. 

Im just continuing to work hard, my injury problems have been well documented but it has been a good season so far and Ive got half a dozen games to get through now. 

Bond, who leads New Zealands tournament bowling averages with eight wickets at an average of just over 10 apiece, is currently second in the ICCs ODI bowling rankings behind Shaun Pollock. 

In the Test list, Bond is in sixth place, still some way behind Muttiah Muralidharan who tops the standings. 

Bond, who was named MoM on Monday, said he was enjoying the challenge of pitting his pace on the slow Caribbean pitches. 

Things are going well for us at the moment. The challenge will be to keep it going at the business-end of the tournament, he said. 

The wickets are different every time you turn up, so its a question of adjusting every time and using your variations. The other guys also do a good holding job which makes my work easier. 

Guys like Shaun Pollock and Glenn McGrath are the ones you strive for and even though Im a quick bowler, on these kind of wickets, I still need to put the ball in the right areas and have managed to do that so far.

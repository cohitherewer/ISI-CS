 Pep talk for Tiwary and his men

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Manoj Tiwary amp; Co. got a pep talk from former Bengal captains a day ahead of their departure for Hyderabad, where they will take part in the Moin-ud-Dowlah Gold Cup. 

The CAB hosted a tea party for the players in the evening where Gopal Bose, Sambaran Banerjee and Devang Gandhi had a session with them and urged the youngsters to seize the opportunity. 

CAB chief Prasun Mukherjee reminded the players of their responsibility in the season ahead, especially in the light of six top cricketers joining the Indian Cricket League. 

Its going to be a tough meet and we all know the significance of the challenge, captain Tiwary said. 

He would be looking to Indias A series against South Africa A as the platform to return to the senior side. I have been out with injury since May. If I perform against the South Africans, Ill definitely make my case for a return to the senior side, he said. 

Tiwary will be off for India A duty after the CAB XIs first match in Hyderabad. With Ranadeb Bose expressing his unwillingness to lead, the captaincy will then be a toss-up between Arindam Das and Shib Shankar Paul.

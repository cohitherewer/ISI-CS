 Chelsea miss a chance

London: Chelsea missed their chance to slash Manchester Uniteds lead in the Premier League to a single point on Sunday when they were held to a 0-0 draw at Newcastle United. 

Manchester United handed the initiative to Chelsea after drawing 1-1 at home with Middlesbrough on Saturday and will breathe a huge sigh of relief at the champions scrappy draw at St James Park. 

With four games left, United are on top with 82 points and Chelsea, who host Alex Fergusons men in a potential title decider at Stamford Bridge on May 9, have 79. 

Neither side created clear-cut chances on Sunday, with Newcastles defence keeping a tight rein on the Chelsea attack led by 31-goal Ivorian striker Didier Drogba. 

Chelsea, who had won nine consecutive league games, had their best chance deep in stoppage time when a flick by substitute Joe Cole ran wide of the far post. 

Coach Jose Mourinho played down the days missed opportunity and highlighted a penalty appeal, which was rejected when the ball hit Newcastle United defender Stephen Carrs arm. 

In comments that could land him in trouble, Mourinho said penalty decisions were favouring Manchester United and going against Chelsea. 

We are in conditions to fight for the Premiership, even against new football rules, Mourinho said. One rule is that penalties are not allowed against United and another is penalties are not allowed in favour of Chelsea. 

Just below the title rivals, Liverpool sealed their place in the Champions League qualifiers with a 2-0 win on Saturday over Wigan Athletic that kept them third on 67 points. 

Meanwhile in Rome, Marco Materazzi scored twice, once from the penalty spot, as Inter Milan won 2-1 at Siena on Sunday to clinch their second successive Serie A title with five games to spare. 

Materazzi put Inter ahead in the 18th minute with a right-footed shot only for defender Paolo Negro to head in Sienas equaliser three minutes later. 

Inter regained the lead 15 minutes after the break, when Siena keeper Alexander Manninger brought down Julio Cruz in the area and Materazzi converted the penalty.

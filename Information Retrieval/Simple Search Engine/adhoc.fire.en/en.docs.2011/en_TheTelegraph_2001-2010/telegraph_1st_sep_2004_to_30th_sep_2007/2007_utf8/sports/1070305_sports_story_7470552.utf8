 Steelers make it 1-1

Chandigarh: Roshan Minz hit a brace to help Orissa Steelers edge past Sher-e-Jalandhar 2-1 in the second of best-of-three finals and push the Premier Hockey League into the decider here on Sunday. 

Minz, declared Lion-of-the-Day, hit a powerful shot to finish off a well-executed attack in the 38th minute and then put the result beyond doubt with another goal in the dying minutes. 

The Shers got early lead in the 22nd minute through the second penalty corner. Tejbir Singh deflected the ball into the post after a nice pass from Baljit Singh Dhillon. (PTI)

Karachi: The India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh cricket boards will discuss the possibility of reducing the duration of the 2011 World Cup. 

Officials from the four South Asian Test playing nations, who will co-host the next World Cup, will meet in Pakistan on June 18, a senior Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official said. 

Meanwhile, ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed also admitted that they are looking at the duration of future meets. 

Im hopeful that we can find a format that gets us down to five weeks, he said. 

We have heard talk from the ICC about possibly reducing the number of days in the next World Cup. So we will look over it at our meeting, Saleem Altaf, director special projects of the PCB, said.

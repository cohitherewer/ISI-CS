 Lara takes a dig at WICB

Port of Spain: Brian Lara, who often collided with the establishment during his playing days, took another potshot at the West Indies Cricket Board by questioning the officials integrity and efficiency. Lara made the remark at a function to inaugurate a cancer treatment centre named after him in Mucurapo. 

Lara praised the personnel and organisations involved in the construction and management of the centre for their teamwork, integrity and use of technology, but said these had missed the cricket board. (PTI)

 Lahiri fires 66 for sole lead

Bangalore: Home challenge Anirban Lahiri brought in a card of six-under 66 to assume sole lead at the LG Eagleton amateur golf championship here on Tuesday. 

Saurabh Bahuguna shot a four under 68 to occupy the second position, while HS Kang and Sri Lankan Mithun Perera fired opening rounds of three under 69 each to occupy tied third position. 

Moin Malak was in fifth place after shooting a round of 70, while K Prabagaran, Chikkarangappa, Raj Randhawa and Vikram Rana were placed tied sixth at one under 71 each. 

Three-time Sri Lankan amateur champion Simarjeet Singh shot a level par 72 to occupy the 10th place. 

Lahiri had a near perfect round. After a series of pars, Lahiri birdied the fourth and then followed it up with an eagle on the sixth to make the turn at three under. On the par 5 sixth, Lahiri hit a driver into the left fairway from where he used a three-wood to reach the edge of the green and chipped-in for an eagle. 

On his return journey, he birdied the 10th and managed another eagle on the 13th. However, a bogey on the 16th undid his good work but he made it up with a birdie on the 17th to end the day at six under.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 United SC lose to Viva Kerala

Kozhikode: Scoring a goal in each half, Viva Kerala of Kochi beat Calcutta-based Chirag United SC convincingly to earn three points in a final phase second division National Footbal League match on Monday. 

While PK Anil Kumar netted the opener in the 40th minute collecting a neat pass from Nigerian Baba Tunde, the latter himself burst on the scene in the 84th to double the initiative through a perfect cross hit. 

The visitors were never in the hunt after Ajims powerful shot was brilliantly stopped by Viva Kerala goalkeeper, M. Shiju in the 33rd minute. Shiju once again came to the rescue of his team when he saved a stunning header from Chirag Uniteds captain, Crispin Chhetri just before the break. 

Riding high on their one-up advantage, Viva Kerala went on the attack in the second half but could not really succeed in converting at least a couple of chances that came their way. 

Notwithstanding an excellent show by the foreign-pair of Maduko Chibueze Francis (Ghana) and Theodore Sundy Wrobeh (Nigeria), the visitors failed to produce long passes.

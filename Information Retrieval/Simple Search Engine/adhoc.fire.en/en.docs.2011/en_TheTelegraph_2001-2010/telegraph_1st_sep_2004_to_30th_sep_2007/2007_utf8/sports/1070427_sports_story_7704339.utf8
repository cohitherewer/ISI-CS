 Tickets priced too high: Bacher

Gros Islet: Ali Bacher, the man who oversaw the organisation of the last World Cup, on Wednesday criticised high ticket prices and strict regulations for spoiling the 2007 tournament in the Caribbean. 

Speaking while watching South Africa lose to Australia in the semi-final, Bacher said he believed the majority of fans in the Caribbean were priced out of the event. 

The tickets have been just too high. For this match its $120 thats 1000 Rand, Bacher, who was tournament director of the last World Cup in South Africa four years ago, said. 

In South Africa, we kept the prices low because we wanted the majority of people (watching) to be South Africans, not overseas people. 

That allowed us to have an average capacity over 54 matches of between 75 and 80 percent. When the overseas visitors didnt come because India got knocked out we saw the problem. Ideally, you want the local people to come and enjoy the World Cup but most of them cant afford it. 

Bacher also complained that in the early stages fans were not allowed to bring their musical instruments to the stadiums. The rules were relaxed in the latter part of the event. 

The other aspect we saw was the lack of calypso, the vibe which became synonymous with West Indies cricket, said Bacher. 

But its a pity that more of them could not get to see the matches which were being played in their own backyard.

 Chandra shocks Sethi 

Mumbai: Manan Chandra overwhelmed cue ace Geet Sethi 5-2 in a best-of-nine clash to clinch the inaugural Rs 2.5-lakh Nahar group-MIG club All India Invitation snooker tournament on Saturday. 

Chandra, of Petroleum Sports, racked up a quick 3-0 lead, over the multiple-time world pro billiards champion in the opener before the Sethi could find his bearing in the one-sided title-contest.

 Sasi misses chance

Yalta (Ukraine): Krishnan Sasikiran missed winning chances in his double edged ninth-round game against Sergey Karjakin and had to be content with a draw in the Aerosvit Open Chess Tournament here on Wednesday. 

Sasikiran once again featured in the most thrilling game of the round but could not convert his advantage due to severe time trouble. The marathon battle ended in a draw after 93 moves 

Karjakin shared the lead with fellow Ukrainian Vassily Ivanchuk who drew his game against Lenier Dominguez after a protracted fight.

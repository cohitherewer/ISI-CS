 Greg among 30 probables

 - BEST-EVER AUSSIE ODI SQUAD 

Melbourne: Australia may have slipped from the top of the ODI team rankings, but that has not stopped them from picking their best-ever one-day squad. 

On the occasion of 20th anniversary of their maiden World Cup triumph, Cricket Australia announced an initial 30-member squad, which features India coach Greg Chappell, who with brother Ian played in the first-ever ODI on January 5, 1971. 

The list is the first stage in the process of identifying Australias best-ever ODI team of 12, to be announced in Sydney on Tuesday. 

The function, while honouring the heroes of 1987 World Cup winning team, will also serve as a send-off for Ricky Pontings squad to the World Cup in the Caribbean. 

The list of top 30 players came from the votes cast by the 163 players who have represented Australia in the limited-overs game since its inception in 1971. 

THE PROBABLES 

Terry Alderman, Michael Bevan, David Boon, Allan Border, Greg Chappell, Ian Chappell, Simon Davis, Adam Gilchrist, Jason Gillespie, Gary Gilmour, Matthew Hayden, Michael Hussey, Dean Jones, Brett Lee, Darren Lehmann, Dennis Lillee, Damien Martyn, Greg Matthews, Craig McDermott, Glenn McGrath, Tom Moody, Simon Donnell, Ricky Ponting, Bruce Reid, Paul Reiffel, Andrew Symonds, Doug Walters, Shane Warne, Mark Waugh, Steve Waugh.

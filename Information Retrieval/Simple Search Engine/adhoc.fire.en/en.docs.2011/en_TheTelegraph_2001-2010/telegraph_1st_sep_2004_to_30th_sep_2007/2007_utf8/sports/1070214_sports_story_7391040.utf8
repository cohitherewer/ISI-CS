 Court drops charges against Moin

Karachi: A lower court here on Tuesday dropped charges against former Pakistan wicketkeeper Moin Khan, who had allegedly assaulted his wife in an inebriated state last month. 

Police said proceedings were stopped against Moin after his wife withdrew the charges lodged with the police and in court. 

She and Moin appeared together in court and told the judge they were working out their differences and the case should be dismissed, a police official said. 

Moin was arrested briefly by the police after his wife complained that he had assaulted her. (PTI)

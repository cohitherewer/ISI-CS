 A perfect send-off for No. 1 South Africa

Dubai: South Africa got a perfect send-off to the World Cup when their captain Graeme Smith was presented with the ICC ODI Championship Shield for climbing to the top of the official one-day rankings. 

Smith received the Shield in Johannesburg just before the team prepared to fly to the Caribbean for a prize that has eluded the side since South Africas return to international cricket over 15 years ago. 

The South African captain promised his team would work hard to maintain their winning momentum in the mega event. 

This is a great honour and a deserved reward for all the hard work the team has put in over the past 18 months, Smith said. 

However, heading the log at this stage will not change our focus on the job at hand over the next two months in the Caribbean, he said. 

Smiths side snatched first place from Australia earlier this month following an outstanding run of results over the past year, which has seen the team win 15 of their past 21 matches, including seven of the last eight they have completed. 

It is the first time a side has overtaken Australia since the listings began in October 2002. 

And if South Africa are still top on April 1 they will win $175,000 for being there, the side that is placed second at that time will pick up $75,000. 

Cricket South Africa chief Gerald Majola praised Smith for achieving the extraordinary feat. 

This is an outstanding achievement by the Proteas under the leadership of Graeme Smith. The Proteas have had an extraordinary run of form over the past 12 months, he said. 

Now all eyes are on the World Cup, and the players are quietly confident that their teamwork will stand them in good stead throughout the tournament, Majola added. 

The ICC ODI Championship Shield, produced in late 2002, is circular in shape and weighs approximately six kilograms. The gold and silver-plated shield depicts in its centrepiece an image of a famous catch taken by South Africas Jonty Rhodes (dismissing Robert Croft of England during an ODI at Edgbaston in 1998). 

The figure, sculpted in sterling silver, is triumphantly capturing a 1.5 carat argyle diamond that represents the white ball of the ODI game.

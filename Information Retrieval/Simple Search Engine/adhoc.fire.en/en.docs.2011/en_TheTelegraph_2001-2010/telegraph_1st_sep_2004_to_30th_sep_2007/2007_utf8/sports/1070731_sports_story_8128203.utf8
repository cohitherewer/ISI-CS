 Whatever is destined happens

 - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 

 Maestro Sachin Tendulkar takes guard

Nottingham: On the morning after being denied a hundred (it wouldve been his 38th), Sachin Tendulkar looked calm. He even smiled. 

Im okay... I cant comment on the umpires decision, but the disappointment has passed, he

 told The Telegraph while preparing for a breakfast of baked beans and scrambled

 eggs at the Crowne Plaza on Monday. 

Sachin was claimed by Simon Taufel when on 91. It could be argued why he didnt offer a shot, but the Paul Collingwood delivery pitched outside off and he shouldnt have been given out. 

While Sachin didnt wish to react, a teammate revealed that the maestro (whod been very upset on Sunday afternoon) had wanted to know why me all the time? 

Good question as Sachin has received some exceedingly poor decisions, like the one by Steve Bucknor at the Eden Gardens 28 months ago. 

Back then, in innings No.2 of the second Test against Pakistan, Bucknor lifted the dreaded index finger on an appeal for a catch at the wicket off Abdul Razzaq. Replays showed Sachin (on 52) had made no contact with the ball. 

Later that evening, Bucknor admitted he couldve erred. I havent seen the TV replays, but mistakes are going to happen... You feel bad whenever you make a bad decision... It could be yesterday, last year or even today... But life must go on. 

Sachin didnt get a hundred here, but joined the highly exclusive 11,000 Test runs club. With Brian Lara (11,953) having retired, hes the No.1 (11,066) among the active batsmen. 

Allan Border had been the first to break the 11,000-barrier. He finished on 11,174. 

Incidentally, the one closest to Sachin is his Team India captain, Rahul Dravid (9,414 runs). With 9,368, Ricky Ponting is behind the Indians. 

Sachin, of course, has the maximum Test hundreds. Four behind his 37 is Ponting, while Matthew Hayden has posted 27. They fall in the active category. 

Had the seven 90s been converted into hundreds, his tally wouldve been an even more awesome 44. In terms of numbers, yes, but I cant be thinking that way, Sachin remarked. 

About getting to 11,000, he said: Im happy, but dont have a target as such. Ten years ago, for example, I didnt set a target that Ive got to reach 11,000 in 2007... I believe in destiny and whatever is destined happens. 

Asked whether the 91 had helped prove a point to detractors whod torn into him after low scores in the first Test (Lords), Sachin replied: My cricket is passion-driven... Of wanting to do well for India, not wanting to prove any point... 

One could raise a toast to that. 

Footnote: With 15,051 runs and 41 hundreds, Sachin

 is the topper in ODIs by miles. Theres nobody even within sniffing distance.

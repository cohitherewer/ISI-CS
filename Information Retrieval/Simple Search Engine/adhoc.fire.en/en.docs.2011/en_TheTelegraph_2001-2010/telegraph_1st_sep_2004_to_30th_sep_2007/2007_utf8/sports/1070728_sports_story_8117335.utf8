 Harikrishna down to tied third

Montreal: P. Harikrishna split the point with Canadian Pascal Charbonneau after 42 moves to slip to the tied third spot after the seventh round of the eighth Montreal International Chess Tournament. 

Harkrishna shares the third position with American GM Gata Kamsky. 

Dutch GM Sergei Tiviakov continued his brilliant form and remained the sole leader by beating Polish GM Kamil Miton. 

GM Vassily Ivanchuk moved to second spot with a win over GM Mark Bluvshtein of Canada. 

Tiviakov was a little lucky to remain in the lead as he managed to beat Kamil Milton after getting into a worse position in the middlegame. 

Nigel Short and Gata Kamsky agreed to a draw after 45 moves, while Emil Sutovsky and Pavel Eljanov agreed to split the point in just 17 moves. (PTI)

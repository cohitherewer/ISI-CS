 Were not bothered about rankings: Buchanan

Melbourne: Coach John Buchanan has said Australia would draw confidence from their impressive win over England in the warm-up game than worry about the No.1 ranking ahead of their World Cup opener against Scotland on Wednesday. 

Buchanan said that while South Africa may have the No.1 ranking going into the quadrennial showpiece in the West Indies, Australias five-wicket win over their arch-rivals on Friday was an indication of how well Ricky Pontings side were progressing. 

I dont really buy into whether we are the best team in the world or the second-best or the team to beat, Buchanan was quoted as saying in an Australian daily. 

I think we are going to be very hard to beat if we get our strategy right and then deliver We have got the playing potential and ability and skills to really execute our one-day game. 

Buchanan also fired back at fellow Queenslander and current West Indies coach Bennett King for his comments that the hosts would not be weighed down by expectations. 

I think thats very easy to say before the tournament has started, he said. Theres no doubt that if the West Indies start winning games, there would be enormous pressure on them from fans and the media. 

Meanwhile, captain Ricky Ponting said that despite Shane Watsons 81 against Zimbabwe and 55 against England in practice matches, Matthew Hayden would slot straight back into the top-order role with Adam Gilchrist once he proved his fitness. 

He batted for an hour-and-a-half today (Saturday). Hes done a lot of running as well, Ponting said of Hayden. 

The impact is the thing that everybody has been worried about. He seems to be coming along pretty well. 

I think right at the moment he would certainly be on track to play that game (against Scotland), he said. 

Ponting has also conducted a one-on-one session with teammates to know if there was any crisis of confidence or confusion about their roles ahead of the World Cup. 

I wasnt in New Zealand but one of the first things I did when we got here was to hold one-on-one meetings with all the players, he said. 

I asked them about their roles, if they were confused about their roles. The responses I got were really positive, he added.

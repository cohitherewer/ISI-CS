 Indian makes rowing history

New Delhi: Indian rower Bhavik Gandhi has become the first person to row across the Atlantic Ocean unassisted. 

Bhavik became the 33rd person to have rowed across an ocean. He set out from La Restinga in the Canary Islands to Antigua on his boat Miss Olive. 

After a gruelling journey lasting 106 days, Bhavik, who was born in Mumbai but is now based in Sweden, reached Jabberwock beach, Antigua, on Thursday. During his journey, his boat capsized 200km from the destination but he managed to steer it by rowing with a spare oar. 

Other hardships that he endured included a ghost ship collision and a water leak, which destroyed his ration for 20 days. 

The 30-year-old took the same route as Chritopher Columbus picked when he went in search of India and found America instead. A rescue team was on standby throughout. (PTI)

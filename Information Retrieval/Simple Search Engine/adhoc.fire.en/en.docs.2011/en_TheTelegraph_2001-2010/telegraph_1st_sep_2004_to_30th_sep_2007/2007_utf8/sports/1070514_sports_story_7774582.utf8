A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Manoj Tiwary, who returned home from Bangladesh tour after sustaining a shoulder injury, is likely to be operated upon at a later date next week. 

According to Tiwarys personal coach Manabendra Ghosh the Bengal allrounder will undergo surgery under Dr Anant Joshi in Mumbai sometime next week. 

Ghosh said Tiwary will follow the instructions of the BCCI. 

We are no one to decide such matters as we have very little knowledge about the subject. 

In the best interest of Manoj we will go by what the BCCI says, Ghosh added. 

CAB secretary Saradindu Pal too confirmed of Tiwarys operation in Mumbai at a later date. 

I have to talk to the Board officials tomorrow to know the procedure, Pal said on Sunday evening.

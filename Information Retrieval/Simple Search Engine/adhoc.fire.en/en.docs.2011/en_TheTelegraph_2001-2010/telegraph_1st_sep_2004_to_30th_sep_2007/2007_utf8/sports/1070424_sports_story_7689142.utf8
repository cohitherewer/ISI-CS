 Negi beats Timman

Malmo: Indian GM Parimarjan Negi defeated defending champion GM Jan Timman of Holland in the fifth round of Sigeman amp; Co. International Chess tournament. 

Top-seed GM Ivan Cheparinov of Bulgaria defeated Jonny Hector of Sweden in a one-sided contest to emerge the sole leader with four points. 

Half a point behind are Swedes Emanuel Berg and Tiger Hillarp Persson, who drew their games against Dutchman Erwin LAmi and Greek Vasilios Kotronias, respectively. 

Swedes Emil Hermansson and Pontus Carlsson had a quick draw. 

With four rounds to go, Negi is joint fourth with Kotronias, LAmi and Carlsson. 

Negi went for a tactical battle against Timman. Playing the black side of a Ruy Lopez, Timman was up against a topical variation that gave him enough play. But with the game remaining complex, the Dutchman was in for a surprise even when Negi was apparently short of time. 

With under five minutes to make the last eight moves, Negi spotted a weakness in blacks position and pressurised it. Timman made a vital error while trying to regroup his pieces and never recovered. (PTI)

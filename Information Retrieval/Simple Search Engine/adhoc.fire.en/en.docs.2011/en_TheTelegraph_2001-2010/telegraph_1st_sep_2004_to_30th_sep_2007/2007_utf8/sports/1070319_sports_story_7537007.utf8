The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I am never overawed by the opposition: Tamim

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Port of Spain: Mashrafe Mortaza may have walked away with the Man of the Match award, but it was Tamim Iqbal who proved to be the real surprise in Bangladeshs win. Had it not been for the openers lusty hitting (51 off 53 balls) that upset the bowlers rhythm, India might have defended the target of 192 successfully. 

Rahul Dravid, too, admitted that his innings did make a difference in the end. The 17-year-old, who made his debut against Zimbabwe in February 2007, was confidence personified as he took on a more fancied opposition. His dare devil approach went a long way in setting up the momentum for Bangladesh in the initial stages from where they never looked back. 

This is the way I play my cricket I am never overawed by the opposition and whatever the circumstances I will play my natural game. I am encouraged to do that by the team, Tamim told The Telegraph as the celebrations continued into the night. I am happy that my maiden fifty has come in a winning cause. I was a bit nervous when approaching 50... I thought I fell to a very stupid shot. 

That he was not going to be cowed down was evident in his reply after Munaf Patel made his displeasure clear at the treatment meted out to him. I am not going to be dictated to by anyone, he said. 

He also said he gained from his rivalry with younger brother Nafis Iqbal Khan. Nafis may not be playing here but did call up this morning to convey his best wishes. 

It is the contribution of youngsters like him that has helped Bangladesh cricket turn the corner. A fact acknowledged by captain Habibul Bashar. The youngsters have given a new dimension to our cricket. You can see it in our fielding. I hope they continue with the good job. 

What does this win mean to Bangladesh? It means a lot in terms of direction to our cricket, said the captain. This will give us a fair chance of making it to the second round. We are here to put up a good show and have proved that we are capable of bigger things. If we keep winning against bigger teams regularly, such wins will no more be termed as upsets. 

Mortaza had also been the Man of the Match the only other time Bangladesh won against India in Dhaka.

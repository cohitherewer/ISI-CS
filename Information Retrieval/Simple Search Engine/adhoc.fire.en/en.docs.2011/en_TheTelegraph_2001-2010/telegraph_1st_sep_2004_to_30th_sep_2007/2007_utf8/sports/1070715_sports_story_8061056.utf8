 - Speedster plans general hospital close to Rawalpindi or Islamabad 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Imran Khan 

 Calcutta: Shoaib Express 

 Akhtar wants to do an Imran Khan. 

 No, hes not interested in joining politics, 

 but wants to build a hospital. I wish to do something for 

 society If I have a regret its that I havent 

 really done anything I wish to follow the example set by 

 my idol, Imran, Shoaib told The Telegraph 

 recently. 

Imran, an opposition Member of the National Assembly for the last five years, started the hi-tech Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital in the mid-Nineties. 

The universally lauded Lahore facility was built by funds raised across the world, thanks to charity matches and concerts featuring some of the biggest names in cricket and show biz. 

Imrans a role model in more ways than one I cant get into specifics, but I soon intend taking the first steps towards starting a general hospital close to Rawalpindi or Islamabad, Shoaib, whose roots are in Rawalpindi, added.

The 31-year-old speedster indicated that he could consider offers from Bollywood if acting in Hindi films would allow him to make a bigger personal contribution towards the proposed hospital. 

Shoaib, it may be recalled, had been offered Shiney Ahujas role in Gangster. 

 I was approached by Mahesh Bhatt, yes, but didnt take up the offer. As for anything in the future, lets see. 

Did he like the film? Absolutely Bahut acchi bani I enjoyed it. quot; 

The controversial Shoaib was set for his Pakistan comeback in Glasgow (against India) earlier this month, but the elements ensured not a single ball was bowled. 

Shoaibs return to big-time cricket he hasnt played for six months will now probably be in the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 meet in South Africa. Thats in mid-September.

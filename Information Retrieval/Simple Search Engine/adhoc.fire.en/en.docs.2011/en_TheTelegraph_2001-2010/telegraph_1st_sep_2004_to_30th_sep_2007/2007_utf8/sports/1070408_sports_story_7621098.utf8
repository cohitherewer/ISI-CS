 Rusedski calls it a day

London: Former world No. 4 Greg Rusedski announced his retirement on Saturday after helping Britain take a winning 3-0 lead over The Netherlands in a Davis Cup tie in Birmingham. 

Canada-born Rusedski, who took British citizenship in 1995, had teamed up with Jamie Murray to win the doubles rubber in the Europe/Africa zone group tie and put Britain into the draw for the World Group playoffs. 

It was a proud moment considering this is going to be my last match, Rusedski said.

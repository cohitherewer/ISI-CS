London: India braved early setbacks to mount a positive chase after England set them a daunting 380-run target to win the first Test at Lords here Sunday. 

Dinesh Karthik anchored in with a gutsy half-century and Sourav Ganguly nursed him with a measured knock to take India to 137 for 3 at stumps on the fourth and penultimate day. 

Karthik, who had to endure a bit of verbal banter from the hosts in the extended final session, made up for the cheap dismissals of Wasim Jaffer (8), Rahul Dravid (9) and Sachin Tendulkar (16) with an unbeaten 56. 

Sourav performed the role of senior batsman to perfection, guiding his younger partner through the tough last three hours of the day and remained unbeaten on 36. 

The unbroken partnership for the fourth wicket was already worth 53 runs, from only 98 balls, and the run rate of 3.34 showed the positive intent of the Indians. 

England owed their strong position to Kevin Pietersen who struck a belligerent 134 to help his team post 282 in their second innings. 

Rudra Pratap Singh made his Lords debut memorable with his maiden five-wicket haul (5/59), while Zaheer Khan backed him with figures of four for 79. 

The changing weather will have a say on the outcome. While the sky stayed clear throughout the day and helped the batsmen, overcast conditions like during the previous three days would give hope for the bowlers. 

India, however, have successfully chased a target of over 300 runs only once in their entire Test history when they scored 406 for 4 against the West Indies in 1975-76 in Port Of Spain. 

Pietersen hit an attacking 134, his first hundred against India, and shared a 119-run stand for the sixth wicket with wicketkeeper-batsman Matt Prior (42). 

Starting the day at his overnight unbeaten 15, Pietersen batted confidently and fluently to make light work of the Indian bowling before being the ninth man to be dismissed. His knock took him 293 minutes. He faced 213 balls and hit 14 blazing fours and one towering six. 

Overall, it was Pietersens ninth Test hundred, and third at Lords, and it put the hosts in a commanding position after being reduced to 132 for 5 in the first hour. 

Resuming the day at 77 for 2, England were pegged back when Rudra Pratap Singh claimed three wickets for 10 runs in 15 balls by removing Michael Vaughan, Paul Collingwood and Ian Bell. 

But despite losing partners, Pietersen continued to dictate terms to the Indian bowlers as he played some lovely shots all round the wicket.

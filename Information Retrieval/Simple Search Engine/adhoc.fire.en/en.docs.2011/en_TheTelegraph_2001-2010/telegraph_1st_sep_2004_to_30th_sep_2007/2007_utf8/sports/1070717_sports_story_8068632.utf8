 Russia to meet Italy

Castellaneta Marina (Italy): Defending champions Italy defied 40-degree temperatures to come back from 1-2 down to beat France 3-2 and reach the Fed Cup final. The Italians will play Russia, who defeated the US 3-2 in the second semi-final, which also came down to the final doubles rubber. 

Francesca Schiavione, who remained unbeaten throughout the weekend, teamed up with Roberta Vinci in the crucial doubles to see off Nathalie Dechy and Severine Bremond 4-6, 6-1, 6-2. 

In Stowe, Vermont, Nadia Petrova and Elena Vesnina overcame doubles standout Lisa Raymond and Wimbledon champion Venus Williams 7-5, 7-6 (7-1) to secure Russias place in the final. 

Russia, who have won two of the last three Fed Cup crowns, were also missing some big names, with reigning US Open champion Maria Sharapova and Svetlana Kuznetsova sidelined by injuries. (AFP)

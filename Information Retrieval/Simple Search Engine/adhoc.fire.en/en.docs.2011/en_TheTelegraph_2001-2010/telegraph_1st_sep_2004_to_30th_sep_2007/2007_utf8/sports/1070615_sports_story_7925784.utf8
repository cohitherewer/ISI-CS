 Jamaica govt to review Woolmer probe 

 Bob Woolmer 

Kingston: The Jamaica government will set up a commission to review the investigations into the death of former Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer, the islands minister of national security said on Wednesday. 

Given the high degree of public interest which the case has generated at home and abroad... I have considered it desirable to commission a review, minister Peter Phillips said in parliament. 

An assessment must also be carried out concerning the techniques and the standards of professionalism employed by the police investigators as well as the medical and other professional personnel. 

The exercise is to be completed within six weeks and I expect a report no later than July 31. 

On Tuesday, police confirmed that Woolmer had died of natural causes and was not murdered as earlier announced, ending an embarrassing, three-month investigation that gripped the cricket world. 

Woolmer was found unconscious in his hotel room in Kingston on March 18 after his highly rated team lost to little-fancied Ireland in the World Cup, and police launched a murder investigation after a pathologist said he had been strangled. 

The murder suspicions triggered speculation he had been killed by an irate fan or an illegal gambling syndicate. 

However, police reversed course after reports from three independent pathologists and a toxicology test said the former England international died of natural causes and had no poisons in his body. 

The Jamaica police said on Wednesday that Woolmer almost certainly died of heart failure. 

Determining the cause of death is the remit of the coroner but we are 99 percent sure that Woolmer died of heart failure, said police spokesman Karl Angell. 

He did not elaborate, but a Jamaica newspaper quoted police commissioner Lucius Thomas as saying Woolmer had an enlarged heart which was brought on by a number of illnesses. 

Previous media reports have referred to his ill health and speculated that he suffered from diabetes. 

The opposition in Jamaica demanded the sacking of Indian-born pathologist Dr Ere Seshaiah, who concluded that Woolmer was murdered. 

 Seshaiah, however, has stuck to his finding and insisted that Woolmer was murdered. (Agencies)

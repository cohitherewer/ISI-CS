 Police insist Bob was murdered

Kingston: Jamaican Police insisted on Wednesday that Bob Woolmer had been murdered, even as Pakistani investigators suggested the evidence was inconclusive. 

Karl Angell, director of communication for the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF), said their investigation was based on credible evidence. 

The pathologist did an autopsy. He said to us in a written report that the man died from asphyxiation occasioned by manual strangulation. Based on that our investigation proceeded and all angles are being looked at, Angell told a Jamaican daily. 

Mir Zubair Mahmood, one of two investigators sent by the Pakistani government to assist the Jamaican Police, had told reporters there was no evidence to suggest that Woolmer was murdered. 

Angell claimed that Mahmood did not talk to any reporters. In private conversation with the constabulary force, Mahmood said he was pleased with the way the investigation was going and he made no such deductions, said Angell. 

The complete report from the pathology and toxicology tests is being analysed with the help of Scotland Yard.

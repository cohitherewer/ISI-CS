 Frontrunner Rixon has reservations

 - Pakistan Cricket Board has no plans to sue Jamaica police, says Dr Nasim Ashraf

Chennai: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman, Dr Nasim Ashraf, has admitted Bob Woolmers death during the World Cup has cast a cloud over the minds of coaches from overseas who would otherwise not have given a second thought to working with the Shoaib Maliks. 

What followed Bobs death hurt us badly... It has affected Pakistans image and I do know that certain candidates have developed reservations because of how the whole thing played out in Kingston, he told The Telegraph. 

Speaking on the sidelines of an Asian Cricket Council-organised seminar on Friday, Dr Ashraf added: Its not that we dont have options, but Bobs death has become a factor... 

He didnt say so in as many words but indicated Australian Steve Rixon, who has coached New Zealand, is the frontrunner. No. 2 on the PCBs list is another Australian, Dav Whatmore, with Englishman Martyn Moxon being the last choice. 

As of now, that is. 

Whatmore, who got dropped by the Board of Control for Cricket in India earlier this week, has neither said yes nor no to the PCB offer. 

Again, Dr Ashraf didnt spell it out but suggested that no Pakistani is being considered. Among other things, a desi would be drawn into local politics and be tempted to favour certain players. 

Former captain Wasim Akram, its learnt, has been given the task of convincing Rixon, who is one of those with reservations. Hed been the coach when Stephen Fleming got the captaincy and is credited with being very good with youngsters. 

Dr Ashraf, by the way, pointed out that the PCB had no plans to sue the Jamaica police. They had to go about the investigation in a particular manner... Other teams and individuals, too, got fingerprinted... 

Its possible, of course, that pressure from more than one quarter could force the suave PCB chairman to review his stand.

 Match highlights

 Mohammed

 Ashraful appeared in his 100th ODI. He became the fourth Bangladeshi player

 to do so after Khaled Masud (126), Mohammed Rafique (122) and Hasibul Bashar

 (110). 

 The 78-run partnership between Tamim Iqbal and Javed Omar was the first 50-plus stand for Bangladesh against India for the opening wicket. The previous best for this wicket was 31 between Nafis Iqbal and Rajin Saleh in Dhaka on December 27, 2004. 

 The 107-run stand between Javed Omar and Sakib Al Hasan just failed to better Bangladeshs best against India for the third wicket. The best remains the 108 between Athar Ali Khan and Faruk Ahmed in Chandigarh during the 1991 Asia Cup. 

 Virender Sehwag became the sixth Indian to aggregate 5000 runs in ODIs. 

 Mahendra Singh Dhonis unbeaten 91 was the highest individual score at this ground, bettering the 75 by Zimbabwes Stuart Matsikenyri in December last year. 

 The above innings was also Dhonis highest in an ODI abroad. He went past the unbeaten 77 he had made against Pakistan in Karachi in February last year. 

 Dhoni also reached 2000 runs to become the 18th Indian to reach this landmark. This was his 70th ODI.

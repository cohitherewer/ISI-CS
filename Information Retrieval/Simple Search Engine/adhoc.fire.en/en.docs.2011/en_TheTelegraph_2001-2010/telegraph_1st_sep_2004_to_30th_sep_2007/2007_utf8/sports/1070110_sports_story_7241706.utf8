The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dont force children into anything: Jadeja

 - Sporting fraternity mourns Biswadeeps death 

OUR STAFF REPORTERS

Calcutta: The Biswadeep Bhattacharya tragedy a promising table tennis player who apparently died after being hit by his father for withdrawing from practice has brought to the fore the expectations and pressures that todays youngsters have to face. The Telegraph spoke to a few sporting personalities to get their reactions. The following are the excerpts (alphabetically): 

RANADEB BOSE: The father should undergo psychiatric treatment. Its not possible for a human being to behave like this. I sympathise with the family, especially Biswadeeps mother. Had she raised her voice earlier, she perhaps wouldnt have lost her son. My advice to the parents would be to let their children enjoy the game. Unnecessary pressure can lead to such tragedies. 

 DEEP DASGUPTA: The incident goes to show how competitive the sporting world has become. You cannot always blame parents for burdening the children with high expectations. But what has happened cannot be supported in any way. The parents have to make a choice as to whether they will allow their children to grow naturally and without pressure or whether they want them to make a name in todays cut-throat, competitive world. 

 DEVANG GANDHI: What happened is very unfortunate. My advice to the parents of budding players in any discipline is get involved with what the child is doing but dont interfere or pressurise them. In India, some parents think that by putting pressure, they can create the next Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid or Sania Mirza That is not always the case You have to understand how much talent he or she has. 

 AJAY JADEJA: What has happened is very unfortunate. Let children enjoy the sport with their studies. Dont force them into anything. Only then they can show their true potential. 

 MANOJ KOTHARI: My sympathies are with the family and the father. As a father, I can feel how agonised he is at the moment. Surely he didnt want to kill his son. And so he should not be vilified. Rather he should be treated with compassion as it was a mistake which has cost him more than anyone else.The family should have intervened earlier and warned the father. Then may be this would have been prevented. 

 JAIDIP MUKERJEA: Parents should allow their children to relax and enjoy whatever they do. They should inspire their kids and not put them under pressure. I believe other parents must take a lesson from this mishap.

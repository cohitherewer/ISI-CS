 No room for complacency: Benitez

London: Liverpool coach Rafael Benitez is using his teams remarkable comeback in the 2005 Champions League final to keep them focused for Wednesdays straightforward quarter final second leg against PSV Eindhoven. 

In the other quarter final, Bayern Munich take on AC Milan. Bayern have beaten AC Milan just once in nine matches. Luckily for Bayern, after their 2-2 draw in Milan last week, a 0-0 or 1-1 draw on Wednesday will allow the German club to advance on away goals. 

Liverpool seem certain to progress to a semi-final meeting with either Chelsea or Valencia after crushing their Dutch rivals 3-0 in the away leg but Benitez says that the miracle of Istanbul, when Liverpool came from 0-3 down to eventually beat AC Milan penalties, will ensure there is no complacency. 

These kind of games are difficult. Sometimes teams say ok, the job is done but we have to be careful, Benitez said, ahead of the Anfield return. 

We know there have been comebacks from 0-3 down in the Champions League we did it in Istanbul. We know if they score an early goal they will push forward and we could have problems so we have to approach the game the same as we did against Barcelona and try to win. 

Bayern and Milan have 10 titles between them in Europes top club competition. The last of Bayerns four came in 2001 with current coach Ottmar Hitzfeld also in charge. Milan last won in 2003. 

Bayern had made the Champions League their priority after falling behind in the Bundesliga. But Bayern are now fourth, six points behind leaders Schalke, and appear back in the race with six games left. (Agencies)

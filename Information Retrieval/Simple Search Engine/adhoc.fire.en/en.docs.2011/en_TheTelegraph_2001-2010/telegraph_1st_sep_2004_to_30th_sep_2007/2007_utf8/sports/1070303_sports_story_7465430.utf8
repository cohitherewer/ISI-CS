Montego Bay: The Indian squad arrived here with hopes of reclaiming the World Cup after nearly a quarter of a century. The ninth edition of the quadrennial event begins in the Caribbean on March 13. 

The 15-member squad, led by Rahul Dravid, along with the support staff and officials reached the picturesque sea resort late on Thursday. 

The Indians will play two warm-up matches versus The Netherlands on March 6 and the West Indies on March 9 at the Trelawny Stadium here. 

Dravids men will begin their World Cup campaign with a game against Bangladesh on March 17 in Port of Spain. 

Indias remaining two preliminary round matches versus Bermuda on March 19 and against Sri Lanka on March 23 will also be held at their happy hunting ground in the Caribbean. 

The top two teams from each of the four preliminary groups advance to the Super Eight stage, which will commence on March 27. 

Each team will carry over points from their match against fellow-qualifiers and play the qualifiers from the other three groups. 

The Indian squad has six players with no previous World Cup experience Irfan Pathan, Dinesh Karthik, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Sreesanth, Munaf Patel and Robin Uthappa. 

They will, of course, be depending on the three senior pros Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly to put the runs on the board so that the likes of Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh and the pacers dont have too many problems defending. (PTI)

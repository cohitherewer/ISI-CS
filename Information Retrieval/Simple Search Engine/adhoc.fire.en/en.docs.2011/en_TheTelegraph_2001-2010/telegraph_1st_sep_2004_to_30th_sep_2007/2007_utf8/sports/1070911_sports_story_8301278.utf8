The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Hearing on Thursday

Milan: Formula One leaders McLaren hit Ferrari where it hurt at Monza on Sunday but the post-race euphoria promises to be short-lived. 

Sundays Italian Grand Prix victors could themselves face a knockout blow at a Paris hearing on Thursday before they have a chance to renew hostilities on the track in Belgium next weekend. 

There is no certainty that McLaren will still have their 23-point advantage over Ferrari in the constructors standings by the time first practice starts for the final European round of the season at Spa on Friday.

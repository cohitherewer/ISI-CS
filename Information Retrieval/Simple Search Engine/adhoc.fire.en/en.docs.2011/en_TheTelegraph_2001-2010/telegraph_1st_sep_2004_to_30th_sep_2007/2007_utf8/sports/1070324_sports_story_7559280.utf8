The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Cut short tragically...

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Its not everyday that reputed sportspersons are murdered. Heres a list of some gory deaths in recent memory: 

Syed Modi (1962-1988) 

Syed Modi, an eight-time national champion and one of Indias best badminton talents, was shot dead by unidentified assailants outside the KD Singh Babu Stadium in Lucknow on July 28, 1988. On September 3, the CBI arrested top UP politician Sanjay Singh for Modis murder and charged him under section 302 IPC. 

A few days later, the CBI raided the houses of Modis wife Amita, also a former badminton player, and Singh. Amita was arrested later on the charge of conspiring to murder her husband along with Singh. Both were later exonerated. 

Andres Escobar (1967-1994) 

Colombian footballer Andres Escobar was shot dead in a bar in Medellin (Colombia) on July 2, 1994 just 10 days after he scored an own goal in the 1994 World Cup match against the US. Stretching to intercept a cross, Escobar deflected the ball into his own net. The US won 2-1, eliminating Colombia from the tournament. 

Escobars mistake, it was alleged, caused heavy gambling losses to drug lords. Another theory suggested the death was the result of a bar fight that left several wounded. Humberto Munoz Castro, who was found guilty and sentenced to 43 years in prison, was set free controversially in 2005. 

 Robert Andrew Woolmer (1948-2007) 

The morning after Pakistans shocking defeat against Ireland last Saturday, coach Bob Woolmer was found lying unconscious in his hotel room in Kingston. He was later declared dead in the hospital. 

On Thursday, the Jamaica Police announced that Woolmer who played Tests and ODIs for England before coaching South Africa and Pakistan had been murdered, with the post-mortem report stating that death had been caused by asphyxia due to strangulation. Earlier, it was widely felt that coaching-related stress may have led to Woolmers sudden death. 

 Note: During the 1972 Munich Olympic Games, Palestinian terrorists killed 11 Israeli athletes.

Calcutta: It was more than the usual I-came-I-saw-I-conquered script for Joseph Sepp Blatter on Sunday. On a mission to discover Indian football and the passion driving it, the Fifa president represented a world of hope and promise. 

During his whirlwind trip to the city, he got a first-hand experience of how the Indian football functions in the Maidan. 

I am happy that my visit here has coincided with the (Bengali) New Year. Like this occasion, I hope football, too, can bring happiness to you in the near future, Blatter said. 

Blatter was overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of the people. I have been to many countries but the enthusiasm I noticed among the boys and girls here when I was passing through the streets was genuine. This is good for football, this is exceptional, he said. 

Blatter watched the derby between Mohun Bagan and East Bengal in the National Football League in presence of 70,000-odd spectators at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

Hundreds of children and sari-clad women gave him a warm welcome amid beatings of the traditional dhak. 

Earlier in the morning, the vignette of emotion and energy the Maidan emits was in full flow during his visit to the Big Three clubs. 

Little children in the clubs colours lined up along the way of his convoy, welcoming him with placards, enthusiasts and fans cheering as he passedand traditional greetings from women were enough for him to understand the games place in the social fabric. 

Accompanied by AFC president Mohamed Bin Hammam and his Indian counterpart Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, Blatters first port of call was the Mohun Bagan club where he was presented with a silver boat and souvenir highlighting the clubs 1911 IFA Shield win and the match against Peles Cosmos Club in 1977. 

He also planted a mehogany sapling at the club lawn. 

About a hundred yards away, he inaugurated the gym at the East Bengal tent. There, along with memento and brochure, he was also given a picture of the clubs 1956 DCM Trophy-winning side with Jawharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. 

Having learnt that Mohammedan Sporting has a 116-year-old history, Blatter said: You are older than Fifa and Im a junior representative to you. 

Blatter later said that his visit should not be viewed as a solution to the unprofessionalism of Indian football now. 

But according to an East Bengal official, it is hoped Blatters visit will give Indian football the same boost that Major League Soccer is hoping to gain from David Beckham. 

He may well turn out to be the Beckham of Indian football, the official said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ready to fire on foreign cylinders

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Foreign power will once again play a stellar role if the pre-quarter final clashes of the Federation Cup in Ludhiana are any indication. 

Dempo have been the best on view of the teams which have advanced to the quarter finals. They, too, are heavily dependent on foreign recruits. In their match against Chirag United SC on Friday, Dempo produced a smooth display, but it was left to Nigerian Chidi Edeh to do all the scoring. 

Viva Kerala are the only quarter-finalists without a foreigner. They created a mild flutter by defeating Air India, which was another team without a foreigner. It is difficult to imagine the Kerala side producing an encore against Mohun Bagan, though. 

Mohun Bagan didnt impress in their match against ONGC. They had to bank on their trusted Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto to pull them through to the last eight. The next round may not be too difficult, but the green-and-maroons will have to improve substantially if they are to defend the title. 

East Bengal looked far more organised than their city rivals. Brazilian striker Edmilson was on fire to help the red-and-golds brush off Mohammedan Sportings challenge. 

If East Bengal have a tough task, things are not going to be smooth for the big-spending Mahindra United. One factor will motivate them: last season, they didnt win any trophy but for the IFA Shield. 

QUARTER FINAL FIXTURES 

Saturday: Mahindra United v Sporting Clube de Goa (7 pm). Sunday: Mohun Bagan vs Viva Kerala (4 pm); East Bengal vs JCT (7 pm). Monday: Dempo vs Churchill Brothers (7 pm).

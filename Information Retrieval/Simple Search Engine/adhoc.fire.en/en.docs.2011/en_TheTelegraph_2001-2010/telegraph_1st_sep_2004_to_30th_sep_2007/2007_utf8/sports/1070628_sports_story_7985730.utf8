Pune: Renjith Maheshwary and Sinimol Poulose surged to a golden treble in the third and final leg of the 2007 Asian Grand Prix Circuit here on Wednesday but long jump queen Anju Bobby George failed to attain the qualifying mark for the forthcoming World Championships in Osaka. 

Triple jumper Maheshwary, who broke the longest standing national mark by clearing 17.04m in the previous leg in Guwahati, could not repeat that performance but managed to make it three gold medals in a row by recording a best leap of 16.78m. 

The 21-year-old athlete from Kottayam later blamed the track conditions here, especially the short run-ups, for not being able to clear a longer distance. 

Maheshwary said he needed at least a 46m run but had to make do with only a 40m one here. 

Fellow Keralite Sinimol, now affiliated to the Tata Academy in Jamshedpur, was also not pleased with her winning time of 4 minutes, 16.56 seconds in clinching the womens 1,500m. 

She blamed it on the cramped schedule of the Grand Prix Circuit and the constant travel involved. 

The 24-year-old metric miler made it a 1-2 for India with Sushma (4:22.58), who paced her well. 

Anju could come up with only 6.21m which was enough to clinch the gold but fell way short of the World Championship qualifying mark of 6.60m. 

Anju now plans to stay here to try and attain the mark at the combined National jumps meet to be held two days later. 

There were other successes for the Indian athletes, notably in the form of Joseph Abraham who took the mens 400m hurdles gold in 49.86 secs in a race that also featured Doha Asian Games silver medallist Meng Yan of China. Chitra K. Soman won the womens 400m in 53.19 secs. 

Shot putter Saurabh Vij registered a big upset on way to winning the gold with a best effort of 18.51m, his personal best, but discus thrower Vikas Gowda once again settled for silver behind Iranian strongman Sammi Abbas who completed a hat-trick of wins in the three-legged circuit. 

Sri Lankas Susanthika Jayasinghe showed glimpses of her glory days when she beat Asian Games champion Guzel Khubbieva (Uzbekistan) in the womens 100m.

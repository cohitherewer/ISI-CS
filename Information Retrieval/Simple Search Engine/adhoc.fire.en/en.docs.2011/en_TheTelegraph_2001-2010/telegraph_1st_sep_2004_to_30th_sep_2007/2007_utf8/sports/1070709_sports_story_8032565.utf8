The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Borg wants Federer to go for six and more at Wimbledon

London: Bjorn Borg will be happy to see Roger 

 Federer keep piling up the records if it means he continues 

 to grace Centre Court for years to come. 

 The Swede, who walked away from the sport when he 

 was just 26 after seeing his Wimbledon reign ended by John 

 McEnroe in 1981, hopes that the world No. 1 doesnt 

 suffer the fate that struck him when he fell out of love 

 with the sport. 

Hopefully he will not wake up one day and suddenly realise he is bored with the sport. If that happens, it will become difficult for him, said Borg who made only his second trip to Wimbledon in 26 years. 

Right now he looks sharp and wants to play for many more years. Everything around him is very correct, but a lot of players understood what I went through when I lost motivation. 

It came to the point where life in tennis was not fun any more, but still I was young. If that happens, its difficult to continue. 

Borg saw Federer equal his record of five successive Wimbledon titles on Sunday after the Swiss tamed Rafael Nadal for the second year in a row, this time in five sets. 

The Swede insists he will be more than happy to see the record bettered. 

Records are not meant to be just challenged, Borg told a London newspaper. 

They are there to be broken. To win five times in a row in Wimbledon is tough to beat. Pete Sampras was close: he got four in a row, then it was Roger who beat him to deny the fifth. 

 Now I hope and believe he 

 can win six, seven, or even eight times in a row, so long 

 as he keeps the motivation.

 Andy closes in on Cup dream

CHRISTOPHER CLAREY

 Andy Roddick 

Fifteen years later, Andy Roddick will be expected to do much more than sound a horn at a Davis Cup finals in the United States. Roddick was nine years old when the Americans last played host to the finals, in 1992 in Fort Worth. The opponent was Switzerland before Roger Federer had come of age, and the United States assembled one of the finest line-ups in history Andre Agassi, Jim Courier, Pete Sampras and John McEnroe. 

That group, with 33 Grand Slam singles titles between them, was so strong that neither Sampras nor McEnroe were picked to play singles. It was quite a deposit in the memory bank for the young Roddick, who attended with a group from his parents tennis club in Austin. 

After suffering through the clang of the Swiss cow bells in the stands on the first day, Roddick and his oldest brother, Lawrence, returned on the second day with air horns and put them to liberal use. The Americans wound up winning, 3-1, unwittingly laying the foundation for future teams. 

That final pretty much changed my life in terms of tennis and wanting to play Davis Cup, Roddick said in a television interview on Sunday in Sweden after he clinched the USs spot in this years finals with a straight-set victory over Jonas Bjorkman. 

The Americans will play host to defending champion Russia from November 30 to December 2. The surface will almost certainly be a quick indoor hard court or carpet. 

Were going to try to export all of the clay out of the state of Oregon for the tie, Roddick cracked at his post-match news conference. 

Clay has indeed been the biggest barrier to American success in the 12-year drought since they last won the Cup in 1995. With neither Roddick nor any of his sidekicks particularly effective on the surface, opposing captains have routinely rolled out clay to greet them. 

Swedish captain Mats Wilander took a less conventional approach: laying down a fast indoor carpet that suited his team and the US, too. 

Roddick has never played the will-he-or-wont-he game. Since joining the team in 2001, he has missed only one match for the United States, which might have affected some of his tournament results but does make him the most committed top American player since John McEnroe. 

That particular McEnroe proved a less committed captain, resigning after one season in 2000. His brother Patrick replaced him. Patrick has a less polarising personality, and he has fostered a team ethos, which has not been difficult considering how well this generation of American players appears to get along. 

I know we talk about it ad nauseam, but I really do love the guys that I play with, Roddick said. Theyre like brothers. 

All the United States is missing, however, is the Cup to go with the camaraderie. Roddick, who failed to reach a Grand Slam final this year, certainly sounds eager. 

As a kid I had four dreams that I thought were just completely out of reach, Roddick said. One was to win the US Open. One was to be No. 1. One was to win Wimbledon, and one was to win the Davis Cup. 

The first two have been checked off. The third may never be if Federer keeps playing like Federer on English grass. But the fourth is within reach and, for a change, close to home.

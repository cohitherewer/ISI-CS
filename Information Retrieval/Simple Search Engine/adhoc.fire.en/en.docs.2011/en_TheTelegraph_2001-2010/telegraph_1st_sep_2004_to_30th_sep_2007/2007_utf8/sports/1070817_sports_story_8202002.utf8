 India trounce Scotland

 - Gambhir cracks unbeaten 85 Uthappa hits 55 

 RP Singh returned the best figures of two for 26 

Glasgow: Gautam Gambhir and Robin Uthappa notched up half centuries as India defeated Scotland by seven wickets in the rain-curtailed Royal Stag one-off ODI here on Thursday. 

Chasing the revised target of 209, Gambhir remained unbeaten on 85 while Uthappa scored 55 as India achieved the target in 39.5 overs and warmed up for the bigger challenge of facing England in the seven-match ODI series. 

Yuvraj Singh exhibited an array of strikes while playing a cameo of 38 runs in 28 balls. 

Put in to bat, Scotland scored 203 runs losing nine wickets in 46 overs in the rain-marred match with Gavin Hamilton (44) and Neil McCallum (41) putting up a solid 82-run fifth wicket stand after being reduced to 49 for four. 

Munaf Patel, who missed the Ireland one-dayers and England Tests, picked up two for 37 with a changed action from a shortened run up. 

Rudra Pratap Singh continued with his good form of the Test series to claim two for 26 while Ajit Agarkar and Piyush Chawla also grabbed two wickets each. 

The Indian openers put on a solid foundation of 104 runs in 20 overs and thwarted some good bowling from the hosts. 

Uthappa played his usual self as he hit eight boundaries and one six in his 62-ball stay. 

Gambhir (85, 115b, 8x4, 1x6) shared a big opening stand with Uthappa (55, 62b, 8x4, 1x6), putting on 104 runs in just 20.2 overs. 

Uthappa repeatedly drove through the line to send the ball crashing to the advertising boards. He wasnt afraid to take the aerial route either against opening bowlers John Blain and Paul Hoffman. However, the only six he hit came off Dewald Nel. 

After Uthappas stumps were rattled by Craig Wright, Gambhir continued to anchor the innings wonderfully. 

Dinesh Karthik was an early casualty. 

Yuvraj (38, 28b) did well to get rid of the rust that may have set in as he warmed the benches during the Test series.

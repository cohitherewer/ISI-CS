 East slump to 105-run loss

Mumbai: An allround display by Sairaj Bahutule powered West Zone to a 105-run victory over East Zone in the Deodhar Trophy league match at the CCI on Friday. 

Bahutule struck an unbeaten 56 when West Zone were struggling at 140 for six. He added 90 runs for the seventh wicket with Parthiv Patel (46) to help them put on a fighting 239 after opting to bat first. 

Later, the Maharashtra skipper bowled his leg-spinners splendidly to bamboozle the East batting line up and finish with a haul of four for 23.

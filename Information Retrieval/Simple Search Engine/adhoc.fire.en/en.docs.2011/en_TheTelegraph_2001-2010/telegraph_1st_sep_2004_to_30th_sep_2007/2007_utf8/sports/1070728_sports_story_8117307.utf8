Nottingham: England slumped to 169 for seven wickets at stumps on the opening day of the second Test on Friday, with Zaheer Khan taking three for 50. 

Rahul Dravid had won the toss and sent England into bat at Nottingham. 

The start of play was delayed four hours because of a wet outfield and only two sessions were completed. 

Indias decision paid early dividends on a wicket that favoured spin and seam. 

Zaheer took the wickets of Andrew Strauss and Michael Vaughan in an opening spell that left England on 24 for two. He also trapped Ian Bell with five overs remaining in the day. 

The left-arm paceman now has 151 dismissals. This is his 49th Test. 

Sourav Ganguly, Rudra Pratap Singh, Sreesanth and Anil Kumble also took a wicket each. 

At stumps, Chris Tremlett was not out 16, with Ryan Sidebottom yet to score. 

Alastair Cook put on the most productive partnership of the day for England, adding 54 with Paul Collingwood for the fourth wicket. 

Collingwood was bowled by Sreesanth for 28, when he hit an inside edge on to his own stumps. Cook departed soon after, on the days top score of 43, when he was trapped leg before wicket off Sourav. 

Matt Prior only made 11 before he drove at a wide delivery from Kumble and Rahul Dravid took the catch at first slip. 

In the first session, Kahn had Strauss caught for four by Sachin Tendulkar at first slip in the third over of the innings. 

Twenty runs later, Vaughan departed in a similar manner for nine after getting a thick outside edge, and was also caught by Sachin. 

Kevin Pietersen, who scored 134 against India in the rain-affected first test draw at Lords, was on 13 before he was out leg before wicket while trying to pull an inswinging delivery from R.P. 

Both England and India named unchanged lineups from Lords. 

The third and final Test is at The Oval from August 9-13, followed by seven ODIs.

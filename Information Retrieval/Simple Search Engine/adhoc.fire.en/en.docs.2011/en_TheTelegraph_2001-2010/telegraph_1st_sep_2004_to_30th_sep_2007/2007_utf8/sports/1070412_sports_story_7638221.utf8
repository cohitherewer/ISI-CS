 The highlights

 Playing

 in his 38th ODI, AB de Villiers (146) recorded his maiden ODI century of his

 career. His previous best scores were 92 not out (vs India) at Centurion on

 December 3, 2006 and 92 (vs Australia) at St Kitts on March 27, 2007. 

 His 146 was third highest by any batsman against the West Indies after Australians Mark Waugh (173 in Melbourne, 2001) and Matthew Hayden (158 at Antigua last month). 

 At 23 years 52 days, he became the third youngest to make a maiden century in the World Cup after Ricky Ponting (at 21 years and 76 days vs WI) and Sachin Tendulkar (at 22 years and 300 days vs Kenya) both during the 1996 edition. 

 He also became the second youngest South African after Jacques Kallis (at 22 years and 92 days vs NZ in Perth in 1998) to score a maiden hundred in ODIs. 

 His 146 was the best by a South African against a Test nation in the World Cup and third highest overall in the showpiece event. Gary Kirstens 188 not out (vs UAE) and Andrew Hudsons 161 (vs The Netherlands) both in 1996 are the top two. 

 The 170-run partnership between de Villiers and Kallis was South Africas best for the second wicket in the World Cup, eclipsing the 116-run stand between Gary Kirsten and Hansie Cronje (vs UAE) in Rawalpindi in 1996. 

 Their stand was also the highest by any team for the second wicket against the West Indies in World Cup. Previous best was by Pakistan duo Majid Khan and Zaheer Abbas (166) at The Oval in 1979. 

 Mark Bouchers 50 off 22 balls was the third fastest in the World Cup. It also equalled the fastest fifty by any batsman in ODIs against the West Indies. Kapil Dev during his knock of 72 at Berbice (March 1983) had also reached his fifty off 22 balls. 

 South Africas 356 for four was the highest ever total by any team in ODIs against the West Indies. The previous highest was by India (341 for three) in Vadodara on January 31, 2007. 

 It was also South Africas highest in any World Cup match. Their previous best was 353 for three (from just 40 overs) against The Netherlands at St Kitts on March 16, 2007. 

 The 41-run stand between Ian Bradshaw and Daren Powell was the West Indies best for the ninth wicket against South Africa in ODIs. 

 Powell, who scored an unbeaten 48 batting at no. 10, was the third highest by any batsmen in that position. Zimbabwes Dougie Marillier (56 .. vs India in Faridabad, 2002) and Irfan Pathan (50 vs New Zealand in Bulawayo, 2005) lead the list. Against South Africa, the previous best was by Pakistans Abdul Razzaq who made an unbeaten 46 by in Durban in 1998. 

 Having won all the three first round matches, the home team in the Super Eight lost four matches in row to Australia (by 103 runs), New Zealand (7 wickets), Sri Lanka (113 runs) and South Africa (67 runs). 

 Kieron Pollard, who became the first to make debut in this World Cup, was the 134th West Indian to appear in ODIs. At 19 years 333 days, he became the sixth youngest ODI player from the Caribbean to make debut. He also became the first teenager from the West Indies to make a debut in a World Cup. Ricardo Powell was 20 years and 151 days when he made debut in 1999 edition.

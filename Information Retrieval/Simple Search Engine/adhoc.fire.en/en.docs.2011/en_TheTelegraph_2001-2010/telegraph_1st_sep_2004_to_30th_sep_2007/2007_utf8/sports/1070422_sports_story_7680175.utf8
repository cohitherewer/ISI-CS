 Ghei slips to tied 53rd

Shanghai: A poor back nine cost Gaurav Ghei dearly as he slipped to the tied 53rd spot with a one-over 73 after the penultimate round of the BMW Asian Open golf tournament at Tomson Pudong course here on Saturday. 

Ghei, the only Indian to make the cut this week, is now two-over 218 after three rounds. The Indian sank in birdies on the second and eighth but bogeys on the fifth, 12th and 17th holes denied him a decent position. 

Meanwhile, Frenchman Raphael Jacquelin (70) remained at the top with 11-under 205, a shot clear of Scott Hend who returned a brilliant 67 in the third round. (PTI)

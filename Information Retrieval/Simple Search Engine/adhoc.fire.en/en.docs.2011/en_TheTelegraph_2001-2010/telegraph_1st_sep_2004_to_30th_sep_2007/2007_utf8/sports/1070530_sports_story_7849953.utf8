 WI get the chill on a freezing day

Richard Hobson

A diligent BBC researcher has discovered that Monday was the coldest on record for a Test match in England. Temperatures dropped to 7.4C (45F), but it felt colder. Dark nights in February have been more inviting than this May Bank Holiday of rain and hail. Well done West Indies for ensuring that we are not back again this morning. 

Graham Gooch, the Betjeman of Leytonstone, revealed a nice line in alliteration when he spoke of a day for hot soup and hand warmers to BBC Radio 5 Live listeners as they drove to the ground in the morning. Peter Moores, the England head coach, opted for beakers of coffee as he watched between the showers from the dressing-room balcony. 

West Indies would not relish the chill, opinion ran. As if England would! It may not be like this in Kingston or Bridgetown, but they hardly crave these conditions in Leeds or Durham either. Fielders kept their hands in their pockets whenever they could while the crowd kept their coats zipped to the very top. 

A day, then, to ask why? Why did the bowlers feel it necessary to test Matt Priors agility so often? Why did Runako Morton go after the ball as though he wanted to set England a fourth-innings target? Why were punters buying cold beer? And why are these matches happening at all? 

Last week, Ken Schofield recommended in his long-awaited report that England should play less international cricket. After the presentation, David Collier, the ECB chief executive, spoke in detail about the difficulties of putting the idea which surely brooks no dissent into practice. 

Yet here we are playing a series that simply does not have to happen. Under the terms of the ICC Future Tours Programme, countries must play each other home and away during a six-year period. In the present block, the West Indies visit England twice. As matters stand, they are due back for another four Test matches in 2010. 

During the same period, England visit the Caribbean only once, in the early months of 2009. 

The present series is not what is known as bilateral. It stands additional to requirements, which is why the ECB is paying the West Indies Cricket Board a sum of about 500,000 for coming. 

They are not getting a lot in return. There seems to be little appetite for the series so soon after the World Cup. Only 5,000 or so tickets were sold in advance for Monday and not even a Yorkshireman would claim to have known so far ahead that the Arctic would be blowing into their headquarters. 

The ECB expanded the summer schedule from six to seven matches to realise greater revenue from television. But even from the warmth of the living room this cannot have made very entertaining viewing on Monday. 

The West Indies traditional support has all but vanished, discouraged by high ticket prices. The retirement of Brian Lara has taken most of the star quality from the squad. 

According to the BBC, the previous coldest day for Test cricket fell at Edgbaston in 1965 when England took on New Zealand with the thermometer reading 8C. By no coincidence, the game spanned the same week in May, though to New Zealanders raised in Dunedin or Invercargill conditions it will still have seemed tropical. England won that match by nine wickets.

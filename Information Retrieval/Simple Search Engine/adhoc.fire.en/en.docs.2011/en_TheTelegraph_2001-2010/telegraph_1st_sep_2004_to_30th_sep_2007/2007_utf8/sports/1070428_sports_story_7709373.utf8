The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Fire Smith, says Fanie 

 Sharp Singles

 Durban: Former South Africa paceman Fanie de Villiers has blamed captain Graeme Smith for South Africas humiliating seven-wicket defeat in the semi-final against Australia. He said Smith lacked leadership qualities on and off the field. Its probably the time when we need to have a look at what is wrong with our cricket, De Villiers, now a commentator, said. Is it the captains fault? Weve played terrible cricket. Its obvious he (Smith) cant handle his team off the field because of all the stories behind the scenes, the former swing bowler said.

Divine help

 Colombo: Faced with the formidable Aussies, Sri Lankans are relying on divine intervention to win Saturdays final with religious leaders joining hands to launch a major congregation. Multi-religious services were organised on Friday across the country, with one Buddhist monk arranging a chanting of stanzas from the time the toss is made on Saturday until the match is concluded. Sri Lankas sports ministry also asked countrymen to keep the flag flying as a sign of support.

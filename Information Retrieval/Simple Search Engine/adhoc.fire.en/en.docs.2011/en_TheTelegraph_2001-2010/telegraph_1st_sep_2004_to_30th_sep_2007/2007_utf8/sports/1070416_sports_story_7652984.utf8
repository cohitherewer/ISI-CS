 Red Devils stay on treble trail 

 ROY COLLINS 

Despite the embarrassing number of empty seats and a match that never had the fans who did come on the edge of theirs, Football Association big wigs and their new sponsors, e-on, could afford smiles of satisfaction as Manchester United, who have won the FA Cup more times than any other club, eased their way into the first final at the new Wembley (as reported in Sundays Late City edition). 

Despite a sloppy start to the second half, United were never really off the bridle on Grand National day as they ran out pretty comfortable 4-1 winners, taking them another giant, if easy, stride towards a treble. 

Waging a campaign for trophies on three fronts, however, is beginning to take a terrible toll on their defence, Rio Ferdinand limping off after 40 minutes with a groin injury. 

Already without two of his other centre halves, Nemanja Vidic and Mikael Silvestre, plus right-back Gary Neville, Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson might have to raid his FA Youth Cup final team by the time the season ticks into its final weeks. Not that you can hope to win anything with kids. 

Watford were bigger outsiders than anything that ran at Aintree on Saturday and but for one spirited spell that might have seen them get a second equaliser, they pretty much played like it. They now return to the drudgery of trying to prevent themselves finishing bottom of the Premiership, their only realistic ambition. Their fans could not even take up anything like their full quota of tickets, which means the FA could have even redder faces when the semi-finals move to Wembley next season. 

Ferdinand tore off the black armband all the players were wearing for the anniversary of Hillsborough and threw it to the ground in frustration after he was forced off.

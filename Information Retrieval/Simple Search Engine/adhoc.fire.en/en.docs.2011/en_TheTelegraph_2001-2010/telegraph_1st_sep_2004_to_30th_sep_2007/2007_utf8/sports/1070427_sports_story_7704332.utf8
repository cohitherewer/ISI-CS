 Abu Dhabi series runs into fresh trouble

Karachi: The three-match one-day series between Pakistan and Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi has run into further trouble with the organisers cancelling the contract of a firm that had been awarded the television rights. 

Sources in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said that the Abu Dhabi Cricket Council (ADCC) had cancelled the contract following a default. 

The ADCC had initially awarded television rights of the series to IMC but apparently there was a default in payment of the first instalment itself, the source said. 

He said as a result the ADCC was considering delaying the series by a week in order to sell the television rights afresh. 

At this moment the position is that the television rights are up for sale. No party has, however, shown any interest in acquiring it at a competitive rate, the source disclosed. (PTI)

 United SC fail to qualify 

Kozhikode: Chirag United SC narrowly missed the opportunity of making it to the premier tier of the National Football League, having gone down to Salgaocar 0-1 on Friday. 

Needing nothing less than a win to book the top tier berth, Chirag United fought bravely against the former champions and came close to scoring on quite a few occasions during their second division NFL match. 

However, R.C. Prakash sealed their fate once and for all by netting the all-important goal off a pass from Felix in the final minute of the match. 

The players were then engaged in verbal duels, forcing the referee to show marching orders to Felix (second yellow card) and United SCs Ratan Das (red card). 

Salgaocar will be joined by Viva Kerala in the top tier following the Kochi-based teams 3-2 win over Army XI, New Delhi.

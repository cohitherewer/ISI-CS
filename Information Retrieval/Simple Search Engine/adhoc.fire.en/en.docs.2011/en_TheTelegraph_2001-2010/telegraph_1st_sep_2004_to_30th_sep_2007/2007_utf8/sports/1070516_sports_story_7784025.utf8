The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Attack is my natural style, says Tamim

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

 Tamim Iqbal 

Chittagong: One Bangladeshi who has caught the imagination of the Indians is Tamim Iqbal. His attacking style took them unawares in Port of Spain and he again did justice to his reputation in the opening game of the current series in Mirpur. 

Tamims 51 off 53 balls in the World Cup set up Bangladeshs memorable victory against India after being set a target of 192. The 18-year-old left-handed opener was not afraid to take on the Indian pacers and even hoisted Zaheer Khan deep into the second tier over mid-wicket. Not afraid to see eye to eye with his more distinguished opponents, he even had an exchange of words with Zaheer after the pacer was hit all over the park. 

This is my natural style. I have batted this way all my life. Dav Whatmore has always encouraged me to keep going in this fashion and only stepped in to correct any technical flaws. Theres no reason to change my way of batting, Tamim told The Telegraph on Tuesday. 

So impressed was Rahul Dravid with Tamims batting at the Queens Park Oval that he presented a bat to the youngster on returning to the hotel. I was overwhelmed. I didnt know what to say. The spirit he showed was admirable, Tamim recalled. 

The autographed bat now occupies a pride of place in his Dhaka apartment. 

Did the India captain offer any advice? He spoke about the importance of temperament and shot selection. He reminded me that my style could lead me to trouble in conditions where the ball moved a bit. 

Adam Gilchrist, Yuvraj Singh and Kumar Sangakkara are among Tamims favourite players. I spoke to Yuvraj the other day. Besides technical advice, he has suggested me to use lighter bats. I will have to try it out at nets, he said. 

I am never overawed by the bowlers reputation. I will always give the bowlers the charge As a result, if I am out first ball, so be it. Its a game and can happen at times. 

In Port of Spain against India, I had set out to be aggressive. I didnt care whether it was Zaheer or Munaf Patel. I only looked at the ball, and if it meant to be hit, I went for it. That is my attitude, he explained. 

Tamim is aware that he needs to convert the 40s and 50s into big scores. I know that my failure to get a big knock is proving to be a drawback. I am young and there is time in hand. 

Tamim, who is from Chittagong, is the nephew of former captain Akram Khan. Akram chachas advice has always helped me. What I am today is all because of his encouragement. 

He is not disappointed at missing out on a Test berth. I know my time will come. May be a little more maturity and experience is needed.

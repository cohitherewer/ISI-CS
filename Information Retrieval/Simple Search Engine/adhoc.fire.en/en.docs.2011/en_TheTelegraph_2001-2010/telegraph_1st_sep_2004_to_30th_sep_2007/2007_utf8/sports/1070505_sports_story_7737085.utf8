 Vaughan injury

London: England captain Michael Vaughan is likely to miss the first Test against the West Indies in a fortnights time after suffering a broken finger while playing for Yorkshire against Hampshire. 

Vaughan suffered an undisplaced fracture of his right middle finger after being struck by a delivery from Hampshires Australian seamer Stuart Clark on Thursday. 

Vaughan will undergo further assessment ahead of the first Test at Lords on May 17, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said in a statement. (AFP)

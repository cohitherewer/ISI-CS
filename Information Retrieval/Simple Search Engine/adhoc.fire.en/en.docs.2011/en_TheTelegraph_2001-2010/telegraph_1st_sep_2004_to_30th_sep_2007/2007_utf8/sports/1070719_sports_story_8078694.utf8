The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dravid prefers a victory to a hundred at Lords

 - I never look too far back, nor too far ahead: Vaughan 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

London: Come Thursday and Rahul Dravid will be going for the toss at Lords, the venue where he made his Test debut 11 years ago. On the eve of the latest series against England, though, Dravid insisted his emotions werent all that different. 

Captaining at Lords is going to be nice... Im excited, but every Test is special... Im not feeling any different, he told The Telegraph on Wednesday afternoon. 

Earlier, both Dravid and England captain Michael Vaughan interacted with the media. 

 First, excerpts from what 

 Dravid said: 

 On the about-to-begin series 

Its going to be pretty even... Weve got to be smart and have the basics in place... The batsmen, for example, have to look at being in the middle for four-five sessions. 

 On a rather inexperienced new-ball 

 attack 

Zaheer Khan is experienced... Its an opportunity for everybody... 

 On having quality contenders 

 for the middle-order 

Yes and somebody will have to miss out... V.V.S. Laxman didnt get to play in Bangladesh, but hes ready for a big series in England... 

 On whether theres added 

 pressure on him 

One player cant make a difference... Ive contributed in some wins overseas, but so have others... I just see myself as one part of the batting line-up... Moreover, its the bowlers who play a bigger role as you cant win unless youve taken 20 wickets. 

 On senior-most pro Sachin Tendulkar 

He had great knocks in Ireland (against South Africa) and batted very well in Chelmsford... You can write Sachin off at your peril... Of course, its virtually impossible to play at the same level for 17-18 years... Hes enjoying himself... The joy is there to be seen... Sachin loves cricket. 

 On not having got a Test hundred 

 at Lords, like Sachin 

Even if I dont get a hundred, Ill be happy if we win the Test... Rather than a hundred, I would settle for a Test win... 

 On experience 

You can have the world of experience, but still need to perform... For all your experience, you start from zero... From scratch... 

 On the No.1 keeper, Mahendra 

 Singh Dhoni 

He has done nothing wrong in his career... Hes going to be tested, but the more exposure he gets in these conditions, the better he will become. 

 On Dinesh Karthik 

He has shown a lot of character and has impressed a lot of people... He lost his wicketkeeping position to Dhoni (in 2004-05), but was determined to fight his way back, as an opener... If he doesnt make the most of opportunities as an opener, then Im sure hell try and get back as a wicketkeeper... 

 On Wasim Jaffer having a poor 

 build-up 

He may not have got runs in the lead-up matches, but he is a Test batsman. 

 On Harbhajan Singh not being 

 in the squad 

I wouldnt like to comment on selection matters. 

 On Andrew Flintoffs absence 

Its a blow for any team when an allrounder of his calibre isnt able to play... When hes around, England can play five bowlers... He brings a lot to the party. 

 On Monty Panesar 

Hes a improved bowler... Weve watched some of his tapes... Its going to be a challenge for us... Its going to be a challenge for him... 

 Finally, on Indias disappointing 

 record overseas 

Weve been improving in the past five-six years... One needs to acclimatise and, perhaps, we havent always toured with the right attack. 

 Now, excerpts from 

 Vaughans interaction: 

 On returning to the captains 

 chair after the Twenty20 Internationals and ODIs against 

 the West Indies

 Im feeling refreshed and 

 am looking forward to again playing at Lords... I 

 havent played here for two years... I made the right 

 decision (of quitting as the one-day captain).

 On the split captaincy, with 

 Paul Collingwood being the other captain 

(Laughs) It has worked well over the past couple of days... Time will tell... Colly and I are good friends... Ive always believed in having more leaders in the dressing room... In driving the team, the more the better... 

 On India being tougher opponents 

 than the West Indies 

Yeah, its going to be a bigger test... Its going to be a bigger challenge, but its an opportunity for our young attack... Its an opportunity for us to try and be aggressive... Whether weve moved forward or not (in Test cricket) will be known after this series. 

 On being handicapped by injuries 

 to bowlers 

Well, well be looking at getting the combination which can take 20 wickets... 

 On Panesar 

Hes proven himself, though he could be tested in this series... Hes still on a learning curve. 

 On Kevin Pietersen and the 

 fatigue factor 

His comment has got wide publicity, but Im going to judge him over what Ive seen in the past couple of days... Hes been very committed... 

 On having had a great series 

 against India in 2002 

I did the basics right... 

 On what the past holds 

I never look too far back, nor do I look too far ahead... What will be will be. 

 Finally, on whether the Indians 

 have the most formidable top-order 

Theyve got a good record at home, but the Australian batsmen have done better in all conditions... Actually, quite a few teams have good batting line-ups.

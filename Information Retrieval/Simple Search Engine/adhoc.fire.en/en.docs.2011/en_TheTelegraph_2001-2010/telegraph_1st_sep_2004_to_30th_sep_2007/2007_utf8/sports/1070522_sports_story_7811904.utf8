 Negi still joint leader

Kirishi (Russia): P. Negi drew with Zaven Andriasian in the fifth round of the World Youth Chess Championship on Sunday. 

Negi, the worlds youngest GM, took his tally to four points to stay joint leader with Andriasian. The duo is followed by top seed Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia (3.5). 

IM Avetik Grigoryan of Armenia and Rauf Mamedov of Azerbaijan (3 each) share the fourth spot, while Yuriy Kuzubov of Ukraine is in sole sixth place. 

Negi did not have to work too hard to hold Andriasian, who played the white side of a king-pawn opening. Andriasian used an unpopular system and found Negi adequately prepared. 

The Armenian proposed a draw after making his 17th move. The Indian accepted it.

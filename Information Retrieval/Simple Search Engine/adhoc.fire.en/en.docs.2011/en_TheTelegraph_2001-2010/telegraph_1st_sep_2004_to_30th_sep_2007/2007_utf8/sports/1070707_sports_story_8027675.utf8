The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Match over for Shoaib Malik, Hyderabads Ayesha Siddiqui 

 - My mother is looking for somebody suitable, says Pak captain 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Shoaib Malik 

London: Shoaib Maliks engagement with Hyderabads Ayesha Siddiqui is off and his Sialkot-based mother, Sultana Begum, has resumed the search for a suitable girl. 

The Pakistan captain denied hed been formally engaged to the educationist, who was then working in Saudi Arabia, but the Siddiquis had hosted the Pakistan squad for dinner on the last full tour (early 2005) of India. 

Malik, in fact, top-scored with an unbeaten 82 in that match in Hyderabad against India A. The limited overs face-off was won by Pakistan. 

I wouldnt say we were formally engaged... The reality is that I dont have anything to do with her (Ayesha) now, Malik told The Telegraph before returning home after the Glasgow washout. 

After a short break, the players will assemble for yet another camp, this time in Quetta, for two weeks. 

Asked what went wrong, Malik grinned: Bus, buzurg log ek jagah par mil nahin paye... The elders just couldnt reach an understanding... Ive got to respect their wishes... 

The 25-year-old added: My mother is looking for somebody suitable... Ab dekhiye kya hota hai... My job, of course, is to play. 

Malik, it may be recalled, lost his father during the Faisalabad Test versus India in January 2006. 

Back on that 2005 tour, Sultana Begum had been quoted as saying: We have always wanted an Indian bride for Shoaib... Ayesha is cute, good-looking and well-mannered... 

For her part, Ayeshas mother Farisa had said: Shoaib is such a sweet person, no wonder my daughter has fallen for him! 

Pakistans newest captain, who has taken over from the imposing Inzamam-ul Haq, has begun on a winning note. His men beat Sri Lanka 2-1 in Abu Dhabi (third week of May). The bigger challenges, however, lie ahead. 

For his mother, its a different challenge.

London: Britains last Formula One world champion, Damon Hill, sang the praises of Lewis Hamilton after the rookies stunning first win in Sundays Canadian Grand Prix. 

The front pages of most of the countrys newspapers also hailed the 22-year-old McLaren driver, who topped the podium in his sixth start in Formula One. 

What an unbelievable win for Lewis, Hill, the 1996 world champion said in a statement from the British Racing Drivers Club on Monday. 

People should not underestimate what he has achieved in an incredibly short space of time. Yes, hes with a good team, and yes, hes got a good car, but to be winning a Grand Prix and be putting in performances like that race after race takes something special. 

Next to a photograph of Hamilton spraying champagne, one British newspaper declared him the King of the road and a new British hero. 

Another said the McLaren driver on the threshold of becoming a 21st-century icon in the same vein as US golfer Tiger Woods. 

Hill predicted a frenzy of support for Hamilton at the British Grand Prix in Silverstone on July 8 and believes the rookie can go on to win the title in his first season.

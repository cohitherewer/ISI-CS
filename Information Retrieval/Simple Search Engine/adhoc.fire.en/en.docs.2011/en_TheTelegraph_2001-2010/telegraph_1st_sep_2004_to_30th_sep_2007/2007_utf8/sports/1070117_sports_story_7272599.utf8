 Gibbs appeals ban 

Durban: South Africas Herschelle Gibbs has appealed a two-Test ban imposed on him by the ICC for making racist remarks during the first Test against Pakistan. 

Gibbs has informed about his appeal to Cricket South Africa (CSA), which has decided to postpone its hearing. 

As the ICC findings and suspension have a bearing on CSAs disciplinary matter, I have postponed the hearing until after Herschelle Gibbss appeal proceedings have been completed by the ICC, judge Mervyn King, who will chair the CSA disciplinary committee, said on Tuesday. 

The 32-year-old player was banned for two Tests for violating the ICCs Players Code of Conduct after he was heard on the stump microphone saying Pakistani supporters were behaving like bloody animals and something should be done about the ******* Pakistanis on Day IV of the match in Centurion on Sunday. 

He was found guilty of a Level 3 offence under the ICC Code of Conduct which prohibits using any language or gestures that offends, insults, humiliates, intimidates, threatens, disparages or vilifies another person on the basis of that persons race, religion, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin. 

The ICC hearing came after the charges were laid down by its CEO Malcolm Speed and was besides CSAs own inquiry. 

If found guilty under the rules and code of conduct of CSA, Gibbs would have breached the boards clauses on abuse on the basis of race, religion, colour, descent, national or ethnic origin and on unbecoming conduct which brings the board or the game into disrepute. 

Gerald Majola, chief executive of CSA, said the boards charges against Gibbs were laid before those of the ICC. As Judge King has pointed out, the ICC procedures have a bearing on our own hearing and so no further statements will be forthcoming from CSA on this matter until after the ICC and our own disciplinary procedures have been completed, he said.

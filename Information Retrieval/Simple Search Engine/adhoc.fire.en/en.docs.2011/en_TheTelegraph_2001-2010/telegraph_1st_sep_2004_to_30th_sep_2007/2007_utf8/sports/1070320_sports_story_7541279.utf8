The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Black Caps may experiment 

Gros Islet: New Zealand are taking their World Cup group C match with Kenya just as seriously as its opener with England. Just in case. 

We have to win that match, just in case Kenya qualify because theyre the other team with two points in the bag, New Zealand coach Bracewell said. Weve got a reasonable run rate to take through but we have to make sure we get our two points against Kenya. 

With their most important group game wrapped up, Bracewell may experiment.

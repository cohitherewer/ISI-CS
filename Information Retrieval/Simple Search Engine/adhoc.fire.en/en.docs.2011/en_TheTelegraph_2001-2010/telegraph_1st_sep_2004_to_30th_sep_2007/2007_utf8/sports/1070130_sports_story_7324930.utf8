 Well never know whos the greatest: Federer

Melbourne: Roger Federers standing in tennis pantheon of champions should not be judged on whether he ever wins a French Open crown, the Swiss master said on Monday. 

(Winning) the French (Open) might put me in another atmosphere in terms of being a legend, because nowadays people want you to win all four otherwise youve not quite done it, a bleary-eyed world No. 1 told an invited group of journalists after scooping his third Australian Open title. 

But I dont think that is quite right. 

Its (the French) a totally different surface. It would be different if the last one missing for you is the Australian Open or the US Open because those are on hardcourts and you can think oh thats the one anybody can win. 

But the French Open and Wimbledon seem specific surfaces on which to win and you have to really be an expert to win. I think well never really know who is the greatest because of eras its so hard. 

Just when the world thought that they had already seen the Swiss master at his peak after an unforgettable 2006 season in which he reached all four Grand Slam finals and won 12 titles, he proved he still had plenty in reserve. 

He completed the most dominant mens Grand Slam campaign in 27 years when he won his 10th Grand Slam title at Melbourne Park with victory over Fernando Gonzalez on Sunday. 

Not since Bjorn Borgs run to the 1980 French Open title had a man won a Grand Slam title without dropping a set in the tournament.Federer was in reflective mood the day after lifting his 10th major crown in three and a half years.Number one (Wimbledon 2003) will always stay the most memorable one for me, no doubt about that, he said. 

I dont like comparing different Grand Slams, like is Australian Open more (important) than Wimbledon or US Open or whatever It depends so much on how you feel at the moment itself, how was the match point played. There are so many components that play a role in a Grand Slam victory. 

This time Im really shocked, its my first tournament of the year and right away to come out and not lose a set. Thats what stands out the most. 

It hasnt been done for such a long time that this is my most dominant Grand Slam victory. Its already my 10th in such a short period of time, so obviously Im amazed myself. Now its a question of keeping it up as it keeps on coming.

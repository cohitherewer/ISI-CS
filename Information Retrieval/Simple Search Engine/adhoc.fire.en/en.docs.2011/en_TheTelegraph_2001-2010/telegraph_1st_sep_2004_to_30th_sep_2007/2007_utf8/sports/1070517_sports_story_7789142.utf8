 Bob was killed: Gillian

London: Amid the growing feeling that Bob Woolmer probably died of natural causes, widow of the slain cricket coach insisted her husband was murdered in a Kingston hotel on March 18. 

He was murdered but I dont have a clue who did it, Gillian was quoted as saying by a website. 

Gillian, in fact, believes in the Jamaican police version that Woolmer was subdued before he was strangled to death. 

Bob must have been subdued because he was a big man and able to defend himself. But who would do it? The average person would not go to such extremes, she said. 

Deputy commissioner of Jamaican police Mark Shields has been insisting that Woolmer was murdered and said the killer could have been from outside Jamaica. 

Shields met Gillian and briefed her on the investigation. She also rubbished the notion that her husband was about to blow the whistle on match-fixing. 

Woolmer, 58, was found dead in his suite at the Pegasus

 Hotel in Kingston, the day after Pakistan crashed to a shock defeat against

 Ireland at the World Cup. 

A full-scale murder inquiry was launched after a post-mortem in Kingston. 

Police are now waiting for the results of a toxicology report after traces of a herbicide were found in Woolmers body. The herbicide is sometimes used on cricket pitches to keep down weeds. (PTI)

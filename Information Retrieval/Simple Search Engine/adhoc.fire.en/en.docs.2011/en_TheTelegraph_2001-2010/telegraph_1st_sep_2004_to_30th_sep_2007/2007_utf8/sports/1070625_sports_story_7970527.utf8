 INDIA IN TESTS: 75 not out

1932-42

 India walked hesitantly through their first decade in Test 

 cricket, which began with their debut against England at 

 Lords in June 1932. India, captained by C.K. Nayudu, 

 lost by 158 runs. Their first three-match series 

 was against England in 1933-34 in Bombay, Calcutta and Madras. 

 Vijay Merchant and Amar Singh were the stars 

 Amar Singh was the first Indian to score a Test match 50, 

 in the debut Test. Lala Amarnath, however, scored the first 

 century by an Indian in the second Test vs England at the 

 Bombay Gymkhana in December 1933 

 Merchant might have made the 1932 tour of England had not 

 Bombay prohibited his selection on political grounds. But 

 he won a Test cap in the first home Test series in 1933-34. 

 In 1936 he toured England and topped the batting with 1745 

 runs at 51.32 

 1942-52

 The teams first series as Independent India was in 

 1948 against Donald Bradmans Invincibles in Australia. 

 The hosts won the five-match series 4-0. The tour will be 

 remembered for Vijay Hazare, when he scored a century in 

 each innings of the Adelaide Test. Australia had piled up 

 674 runs, and as Hazare made his second-innings 145, with 

 India following on, six of his teammates failed to score. 

 Australia won by an innings and 16 runs. Hazare captained 

 India 14 times and finished his career with a batting average 

 of 47.65 from 30 Tests 

 India recorded their first Test victory in the last match 

 against England in Madras in 1952. Centuries from Pankaj 

 Roy (111) and P. Umrigar (130*) helped India to put up a 

 massive first innings total of 457 for nine declared. But 

 it was a dream spell by Vinoo Mankad, who took eight for 

 55 in the first innings and four for 53 in the second, which 

 really helped India to their historic win 

 1952-62

 India strolled through this decade, growing in confidence, 

 the stars of which were Polly Umrigar and Subash Gupte. 

 However it was Vinoo Mankad who shone in the second Test 

 vs England at Lords in June 1952. The brilliant allround 

 performance, which consisted of 72 and 184 and five for 

 196, led historians to call it The Mankad Match. 

 His efforts, though, went in vain with England winning by 

 eight wickets 

 India also captured their first Test series victory, over 

 debutants Pakistan. The hosts won the five-Test series (Oct.-Dec. 

 1952) 2-1. In 1954, India drew a five-Test series with Pakistan 

 0-0, the batting strength coming from Umrigar and Vijay 

 Manjrekar, while the prime bowler was Gupte with 21 wickets 

 in the series 

 They also beat New Zealand when they won a five-Test series 

 (Nov. 1955 to Jan. 1956) 2-0. Mankad averaged 105.2, while 

 scoring 526 runs. The remainder of the 1950s was forgettable 

 as India lost two series to Australia, and one each to the 

 West Indies and England 

 1962-72

 India steadily improved their win ratio, winning nine of 

 the 42 Tests they played during this period. This decade 

 saw the birth of the great Indian spin quartet of Bishan 

 Singh Bedi, Erapalli Prasanna, Bhagwat Chandrasekhar and 

 Srinivas Venkataraghavan. Between them, they played more 

 than 225 Tests taking 853 wickets. They contributed to some 

 of Indias greatest triumphs, including Test series 

 victories in the West Indies and England, as well as Test 

 victories in Australia and New Zealand 

 This decade saw India winning their first away series, in 

 1967-68, when they beat New Zealand 3-1 under Mansur Ali 

 Khan Pataudi. Pataudi remains Indias greatest captain 

 ever. Taking over the reins at the age of 21, he led India 

 in 40 of 46 Tests he played in, and won 12 of them. Under 

 him, India achieved their first overseas Test victory against 

 New Zealand in 1967 

 The decade ended on an all-time high with consecutive series 

 wins in England and the West Indies under the inspired leadership 

 of Ajit Wadekar 

 1972-82

 The Seventies saw the emergence Indias greatest batsman, 

 Sunil Gavaskar. The Little Master began his 

 career began with a bang: in his debut series against the 

 West Indies in 1971 he scored a record 774 runs. He has 

 81 first class centuries and was the first batsman to score 

 10,000 runs in Tests (he finished with 10,122) 

 The decade also saw the emergence of Gundappa Vishy 

 Viswanath, who was as crucial to the team as Gavaskar. He 

 scored a century on debut vs Australia in Kanpur (1969-70). 

 He was a match-winner, and especially memorable were an 

 unbeaten 97 against the West Indies in Madras in 1974-75, 

 and a 124 in Madras also against the West Indies in 1978-79 

 India toured Pakistan in 1978-79, the sides facing each 

 other for the first time in 18 years. India lost the series 

 0-2 

 India won 18 of the 71 Tests played during this period, 

 the spin quartet continuing its dominance right through 

 until a young Kapil Dev made his presence felt 

 1982-92

 Kapil Dev was one of the leading allrounders of the game. 

 He took over from the spinners to become Indias new 

 bowling sensation. Known as the Haryana Hurricane, Kapil 

 made his Test debut in October 1978 in Faisalabad against 

 Pakistan. He held the record for the most number of Test 

 and one-day wickets for a long time till Courtney Walsh 

 and Wasim Akram took over, respectively. The highlight of 

 his career was captaining India to the limited-overs World 

 Cup win in 1983. Other highlights include leading India 

 to a 2-0 Test series win against a strong England side in 

 England in 1986 

 Kapil broke Richard Hadlees record of 431 Test wickets 

 and was the only cricketer to score 4,000 Test runs and 

 take 400 wickets. He was named Indian Cricketer of the Century 

 by Wisden 

 Batsmen dominated what was called the decade of draws 

 of the 78 Tests played, 44 were drawn. The last years 

 of this decade saw the emergence of a new star: Sachin Ramesh 

 Tendulkar 

 1992-02

 This decade was dominated by Sachin Tendulkar. He made his 

 Test debut versus Pakistan in Karachi 1989, but his maiden 

 century came in England in August 1990 at Old Trafford. 

 He has 37 centuries and counting he overtook Gavaskars 

 record of 34 on Dec. 10, 2005 vs Sri Lanka in New Delhi. 

 He has 10,922 runs in Tests, overtaking Gavaskar as Indias 

 highest run-scorer in the third and final Test against Pakistan 

 in March 2005 

 Then there was Anil Kumble, who is one of only two bowlers 

 ever (the other being Jim Laker of England) to have taken 

 all 10 wickets in a Test innings. Kumble achieved this against 

 Pakistan in the second Test played in New Delhi, India between 

 4 February and 8 February 1999. He is currently the highest 

 wicket-taker for India in both ODIs and Test matches, having 

 taken over 545 Test wickets and 330 ODI wickets 

 Sourav 

 Ganguly also made his mark during his period. Sourav made 

 his Test debut in 1996 against England, scoring centuries 

 in his debut Test as well as the next match (the second 

 and third Tests of the series). Sourav is only the third 

 cricketer ever to score a century on debut at Lords, 

 after Harry Graham and John Hampshire 

 Sourav 

 was named captain in Nov. 2000, and under him a resurgent 

 India played a historic series against Australia in 2001, 

 beating the visitors 2-1. In the Calcutta Test in March, 

 V.V.S Laxman broke Gavaskars 18-year-old record of 

 being the highest individual scorer in Tests when he made 

 281. Harbhajan Singh established himself as the teams 

 leading spinner in the absence of an injured Kumble and 

 was the hero of the match. He took 11 wickets, including 

 a hattrick, to help level the series 1-1. He thus became 

 the first Indian bowler to take a Test hattrick. He ended 

 the series with 32 wickets 

 2002 till date

 The period has seen the best-ever performance by India in 

 terms of percentage wins. They have, in the last five years, 

 won 19 of the 49 Tests they have played so far. Under Sourav 

 Ganguly, India won 11 of the 28 Tests played away, 

 and he has to his credit a Test series win in Pakistan for 

 the first time and Test wins in Australia, England and the 

 West Indies. It was also during this period that Virender 

 Sehwag became the first Indian to cross the 300-run barrier 

 when he scored 309 against Pakistan in the Multan Test in 

 2003-04 

 India then had an indifferent 2004-05, losing the Border-Gavaskar 

 Trophy, their first series loss to Australia on Indian soil 

 since 1969, and squandering a 1-0 Test series lead against 

 Pakistan to draw the series 1-1. In India against Pakistan, 

 they lost the last four ODIs under coach John Wright to 

 lose the series 2-4 

 Greg Chappell was named the Indian coach, after Wrights 

 contract expired at the end of 2004-05. That Sourav and 

 Chappell did not hit it off was made evident by a series 

 of controversial events in late 2005 and early 2006, which 

 were highly publicised. Indias most successful Test 

 captain gave way to Rahul Dravid in November 2005, with 

 Sourav being been dropped from the one-day team. He was 

 eventually dropped from the Test team at the end of January 

 2006, but was recalled to both forms of cricket in late 

 2006

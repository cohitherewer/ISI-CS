 Anand held, Negi beats Willemze

 - WIJK AAN ZEE MEET 

 Negi

Wijk Aan Zee: Former world champion Viswanathan Anand was easily held to a draw by Grandmaster Levon Aronian of Armenia in the third round of the Corus Grandmasters A chess tournament here. 

After a fine victory with black pieces against GM Alexander Motylev of Russia in the previous round, the Indian ace could not do much with his first white pieces in the tournament as Aronian sought comfort in his first love, marshall gambit, and got an easy half point after 32 moves. 

The draw took Anand to two points out of a possible three so far in the tournament and he will now meet Magnus Carlsen in the next round. 

However there was good news for India in the C group with worlds youngest GM Parimarjan Negi beating IM Thomas Willemze. 

On two points, along with Anand, is world champion Vladimir Kramnik of Russia who was held to a draw by Sergei Tiviakov of Holland. 

Playing the black side of a Petroff defense, Kramnik was never in any trouble in this fairly simple encounter and routine trading of pieces led to an equal endgame in just 28 moves. 

Ruslan Ponomariov scored his first victory in the event at the expense of Carlsen who was caught off guard in a relatively simple trap in the opening itself. Losing his queen for two pieces early in the game, Carlsen did not get a second chance and was grinded in just 30 moves. (PTI)

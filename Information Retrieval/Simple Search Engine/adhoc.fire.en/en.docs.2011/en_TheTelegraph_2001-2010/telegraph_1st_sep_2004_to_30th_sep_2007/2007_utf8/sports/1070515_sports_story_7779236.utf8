The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Howard sceptical about neutral venue too

 - CA floats idea of Australia-Zimbabwe ODI series in SA 

A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES

 Brothers in arms: Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden 

Calcutta/Melbourne: Cricket South Africa (CSA) would consider hosting the Australia versus Zimbabwe ODI series in case the two nations want to play at a neutral venue. 

Gerald Majola, chief executive of CSA, said in a statement late on Monday: CSA has not yet received an official approach to host Zimbabwe and Australia in South Africa following the Australian governments order to cancel the tour of Zimbabwe. 

Zimbabwe are the host nation and they would need to decide on what to do. Both Zimbabwe and Australia would also then need to make an official approach to the country that they both agree to play the series in. 

Should that country be South Africa, I as CEO would need to take the application to the CSA Board for consideration because this is a policy matter. 

It was Cricket Australia (CA) chief executive James Sutherland who floated the idea of having South Africa as a possible neutral venue. 

Prime Minister John Howard, who had the tour cancelled in protest against the Robert Mugabe regime in the trouble-torn African nation, didnt sound too enthused by the neutral venue idea. 

I am very sceptical both about the wisdom of that and also about the likelihood of it happening, he said. 

Well obviously deal with it if it comes up, but we dont want to do anything that provides any skerrick (slight amount) of comfort to Mugabes regime. 

ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed, who backs the neutral venue idea, said: Given the choice between that and those matches not taking place at all, we would obviously prefer them to be played. 

That will be for the two boards to work out, but we would encourage them to look at all options, Speed said. 

From an ICC perspective, we will work with Zimbabwe cricket and our members to try to ensure the game there gets the support it needs in order to continue at this difficult time, he said. 

Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer said he would be surprised if Zimbabwe accepted the neutral venue offer after the humiliation of being boycotted. 

It seems to me highly unlikely that the Zimbabwe Cricket Union would want to play the game in another country, Downer said on Monday. 

For them, I suspect, and at least for the Zimbabwean government, it would be seen to be humiliating to acknowledge that theyre not able to play against the top cricket team within their own country. 

My guess is that this wont come about.

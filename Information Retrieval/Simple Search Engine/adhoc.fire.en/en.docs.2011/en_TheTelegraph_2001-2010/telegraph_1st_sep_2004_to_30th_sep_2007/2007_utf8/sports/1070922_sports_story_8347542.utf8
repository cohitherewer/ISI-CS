 Tennis daddies: The good, bad and ugly

MADHUMITA GANGULY

Calcutta: Life on the Tour today is very competitive. Its tougher than even the rankings suggest, as Sania Mirza pointed out while in the city earlier this week. 

Constant travelling over countries unknown. Pressure to excel and deliver. Mounting expectations. All these take a toll on the players. What comes as a welcome relief, what provides a semblance of comfort is the support of family. 

Womens tennis is full of players spurred on to success or, just as frequently, to despair by fathers determined to take their offspring to the top. 

Marion Bartoli is one such success story. 

Seven years ago Dr Walter Bartoli embarked on a mission to turn his daughter into one of the worlds top 20 players. Today, the Frenchwoman who was the top seed at the Sunfeast Open and who unfortunately fell in the first round here, is No. 12 in the world. 

Bartoli gave up his career as a doctor to work with his daughter full time. Ill look after my daughter to make sure shes always happy, he said. If she doesnt want to carry on there will be no question of me forcing her to do so. But as long as she wants to carry on well do everything we can to get her to the top. 

Marion has talked glowingly about her fathers devotion. Hes a very good doctor and a very good tennis coach and a very good father. 

Bartoli seniors dedication is also seen in David King, father of Vania King, who was Marions nemesis in the first round here, only to be herself shown the door by Mariya Koryttseva of Ukraine in the second round. 

King, who also travels with her, coaches Vania. Dad has been the biggest impact in shaping my tennis career. He is the only coach I ever had except for a brief period this year. Dad and I get well together as a team, Vania said in response to a question from The Telegraph. 

Vania misses home a lot, but she also loves travelling. And the fact that her father travels with her has made things that much easier for her. The importance of the family structure is stressed vehemently by Daniela Hantuchova too. 

To have a place to return to after a tough match or tour is the most important thing for a player, I think. I look forward to being home, she said on Thursday. She refused, however, to comment on her relationship with her father. 

For every Marion or Vania, there is a Justine Henin or Jelena Dokic. In a similar situation, Justine and Jelena have reacted differently to life. 

World No. 1 Justine is a fighter. She lost her mother when she was 12, and soon she was estranged from the rest of her family. Attempts to find solace in an early marriage ended in January, when Henin separated from husband Pierre-Yves Hardenne. 

Henin remains an exception in that lifes setbacks did not take a toll on her career. 

Henin has also reunited with her once-distant family a few months ago. For the first time in eight years, she was together with her three siblings. Soon after, she restored contact with her father, Jose, with whom the initial rift began. 

For the first time in my life I feel at peace, she admitted after the reconciliation. She dedicated her French Open title to her family. 

Jelena Dokic has not been so lucky. Her tennis has suffered because of her fathers eccentric behaviour. Dokic returned to Australia in 2005 after her father, Damir, took her to Serbia in 2001 amid claims she was the victim of a tennis conspiracy. She claimed she had spent her life dealing with his erratic behaviour. Damir was thrown out of the US Open and Wimbledon for his behaviour. 

I have not spoken to my father for a number of years and we do not agree on anything, she has said. 

Dokic has had to pay a price for her fathers behaviour. Her tennis has suffered. From a career high world No. 4 (in 2002), she has dropped out of the rankings altogether. 

The story of tennis fathers would remain incomplete without a mention of the most infamous of them all, Peter Graf, father of Steffi Graf. Peter caused his daughter many a headache with his alcoholism, an extramarital affair with a German model, his failure to pay taxes on millions of his daughters earnings and eventually ending up in jail. It is certainly to Steffis credit that she arose above the stress to become the legend she is.

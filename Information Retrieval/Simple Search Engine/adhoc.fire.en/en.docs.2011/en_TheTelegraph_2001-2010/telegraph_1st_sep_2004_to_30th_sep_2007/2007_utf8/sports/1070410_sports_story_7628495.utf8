 Panel grills for four hours

Karachi: An Assembly committee on Monday grilled Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Dr Nasim Ashraf and outgoing captain Inzamam-ul Haq for about four hours, asking them all sorts of uncomfortable questions including the appointment of assistant coach Mushtaq Ahmed. 

Ashraf appeared before the national Assembly standing committee on sports and culture with Inzamam, former director of cricket operations Saleem Altaf and ex-chief selector Wasim Bari. 

Former Test players Majid Khan and Jalaluddin were also invited as observers. 

Members of the committee asked Ashraf why Mushtaq was appointed just before the World Cup despite his name featuring in Justice Malik Mohammed Qayyums report on the match-fixing scandal. 

The PCB chief said that he had appointed Mushtaq on the recommendations of Inzamam and the late coach, Bob Woolmer. 

Inzamam, in his explanation, said he had not read the Justice Qayyum report, otherwise he would have never suggested Mushtaqs name. 

In his report, Justice Qayyum had also advised the PCB not to give Mushtaq any major assignment. 

The committees thrust was clearly on Ashrafs role in the board and during the recent World Cup debacle. On many occasions he was found wanting in his answers, a committee member said. 

Rai Azizullah Khan, who heads the panel, was also hard and blunt on some occasions during the marathon meeting with Inzamam and Bari. He refused to accept some of their explanations for the teams early exit. 

When Inzamam claimed that Pakistan had basically lost to Ireland on a pitch not fit for one-day cricket and that the difference between the two sides was negated after Ireland won the toss, Azizulllah snubbed him by saying that this was no excuse for a poor performance. 

He announced that the national Assembly committee would be writing to President Pervez Musharraf, chief patron of the PCB, asking him to appoint a panel of former Test players to look into the boards affairs. 0The committee also took exception to Ashraf when the PCB chief refused to share the financial records with them. 

This upset the members who made their feelings clear to Ashraf. The PCB chief later retracted and apologised, insisting that he didnt mean to offend the committee members and only meant that since the boards money was not public property, the PCB is not bound to make its audits public. 

Majid Khan, former Test captain and also a former chief executive of the board, suggested that the government should level tax on the PCBs income so that the board is forced to make its audited accounts public. 

Inzamam accepted responsibility for the teams poor show in the World Cup and attributed it to poor batting. 

This is sports, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. But I was deeply hurt by the match-fixing allegations made against us, he said. 

Meanwhile, in an interview to a TV channel later on Monday, Inzamam said the World Cup would have been halted anywhere else in the world other than the Caribbean after the suspected murder of coach Bob Woolmer. 

If this terrible tragedy had occurred in any other country, if such a security lapse had taken place anywhere else, they would have stopped the World Cup, he said.

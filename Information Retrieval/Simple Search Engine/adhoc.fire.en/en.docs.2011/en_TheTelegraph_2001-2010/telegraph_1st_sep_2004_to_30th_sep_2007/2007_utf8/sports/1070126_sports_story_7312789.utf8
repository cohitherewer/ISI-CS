The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Good start by Kapur, Jeev

Doha: Shiv Kapur shot a brilliant five-under 67 to be at fourth place, giving himself just the kind of a start he needed to mount a challenge at the Commercialbank Qatar Masters here on Thursday. 

The 25-year-old Delhiite shot seven birdies and two bogeys as he lay behind Retief Goosen (65), Miguel Angel Jimenez (66) and Nick Hern (66), all inside top-25 of the world rankings. 

There was further good news for India as Jeev Milkha Singh enjoyed a bogey-free 69 and was lying tied ninth. 

Among other Indians, Jyoti Randhawa started with a bogey and missed a short birdie putt on the last but still ended at one-under 71 for tied 38th place. 

S.S.P. Chowrasia and Rahil Gangjee both turned in even par rounds to be tied 56th, while Amandeep Johl went two over and is 94th. Gaurav Ghei shot 77 and is at tied 115th place. 

Shrugging the disappointment of last weeks final round, Kapur used some advise from his childhood friend and caddie, Neeraj Sareen, to set the pace for the event. 

Jeev, starting on the tenth, had birdies on the 14th, 16th and sixth, the last one coming off a 30-foot putt. He missed out on all the par-fives and left many a putt out there.

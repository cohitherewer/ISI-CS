 Male suspect identified

- Bob Woolmer murder investigation 

 Bob Woolmer 

Kingston/London: After weeks of investigation, the sensational Bob Woolmer murder case has shown signs of a breakthrough with a British daily Saturday claiming that a suspect has been identified from the CCTV footage gathered from the hotel where the Pakistan coach was killed. 

Digital enhancement of security camera footage from the 12th floor of the Pegasus Hotel in Kingston, where Woolmer was staying, has identified at least one suspect in the killing, a newspaper reported. 

The cleaned-up images from London show at least one individual of considerable interest to the inquiry. 

The time of the footage and its location mean that this individual must be considered a suspect. Further work is being done on statements given by individuals to look at any inconsistencies. It is good progress, a source close to the investigation told the newspaper. 

Police have declined to comment on the identity of the suspect, understood to be male, or say whether he is a member of the Pakistan team or management. 

Meanwhile, a few other British dailies said that toxicology tests have found poison in Woolmers body. 

While one paper claimed Woolmer was poisoned by Harry Potter drug aconite, another said a suspicious concentration of toxins was there in his body. 

The toxicology tests show that he had significant traces of aconite. We are now entirely convinced he was poisoned. The fact that aconite has also previously been used in Pakistan may also be highly relevant, a tabloid quoted a senior police source as saying. 

This murder proves that truth can sometimes be stranger than fiction. It is now an international inquiry and could ultimately involve high-level diplomatic discussions, said another source. 

Aconite an ancient poison, also known as wolfsbane is said to be perfect for concealing murder and has been used in several high-profile assassinations in Pakistan. 

Wolfsbane is mentioned in Harry Potter and the Philosophers stone, when the schoolboy wizard is quizzed on it by Professor Snape. 

Meanwhile, the coroners inquest into Woolmers death, which was to begin on Monday, was delayed by Jamaicas ministry of justice after some recent and significant developments.

 Gough hopes to play in ICL

London: Former England quick Darren Gough is excited at the idea of playing in the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL) and is expecting a call from the organisers. 

Of course it would interest me, I hope they give me a call, Gough was quoted as saying by a sports agency. 

Im 36 now, Warney and Brian Lara are a year or so older than me, so if there is a chance to play in an older guys Twenty20 then Id be up for it, he added. 

Several retired stars like Brian Lara, Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Inzamam-ul Haq have been linked to the proposed Twenty20 series to be organised by the Zee Group. 

I read (about) it the other day and if I get the call then of course Id play, he said. (PTI)

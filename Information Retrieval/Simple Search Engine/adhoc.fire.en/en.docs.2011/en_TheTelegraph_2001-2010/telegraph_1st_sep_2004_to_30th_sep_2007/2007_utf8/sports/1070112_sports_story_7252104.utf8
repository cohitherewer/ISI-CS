 Sourav batted like a king: Jadeja

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: They had come in hordes to watch their favourite Dada in action. The anticipation had built long before Sourav Ganguly went out to bat at No. 6 at the fall of Deep Dasguptas wicket. The 5,000-odd turnout didnt return disappointed as the former India captain treated them to some pleasant strokeplay during his unbeaten 72 off 73 balls at the end of the day. 

The handful of policemen present at the Eden on Thursday, however, had a tough time as Sourav tried to make his way out at the end of the days proceedings. As electronic media and photographers jostled for better angles, the crowd outside also jammed the entrance to Dr B. C. Roy Club House. 

The commotion got to a situation where police resorted to lathicharge as mounted police also lent support. It took at least ten minutes for Souravs car to make its way out of the Club House en route to attend a function. 

Sourav, though, seemed happy with his knock on Thursday. I played according to the merit of every ball Each ball got the treatment it deserved. Our aim will be to get five points from this match, so that we can top the group, he said. 

He was very pleased by the current crop of youngsters and saw a bright future ahead for them. These bunch of youngsters are very talented. Avishek (Jhunjhunwala), Manoj (Tewari), Ranadeb (Bose), all of them Avishek and Manoj batted exceptionally today. I am sure the good times will come for Ranadeb very soon. The others dont need to lose heart. They are young and their time will come. 

The best compliment came from Ajay Jadeja. Sourav batted like a king. There was no pressure He was playing free and it showed in his approach.

 Everybody still fears us: McGrath 

Sydney: Age may no longer be on Glenn McGraths side, but everyone knows the 37-year-old Australian paceman saves his best for the big occasions. 

Australias bid for an unprecedented third consecutive World Cup title coincides with McGraths farewell to international cricket. As always, he is predicting a win for Australia. 

A five-match losing streak and injuries to key players, including a long-term ankle problem that has forced out fellow-pacer Brett Lee, have not dented McGraths faith in his team. 

Maybe what has happened is a blessing, McGrath said of the surprising 0-3 series loss last month in New Zealand. 

Theres no use going to the World Cup having already peaked, and this way we know we have to work on our games and build up into some form over the first couple of matches. 

In World Cup, his performances have been outstanding. He has the record for best figures (seven for 15 against Namibia in 2003) and has helped guide Australia to three consecutive finals, including back-to-back titles in 1999 and in 2003 when he overcame injury concerns to take his place in the squad. 

Everyone was saying we had no chance before the previous World Cup, McGrath wrote recently in a column. But we went through undefeated. Weve got time to refocus and I know we are still going to be the team that everybody will fear.

 Rookies Dev Varman, Shokeen in squad

 - DAVIS CUP TIE vs UZBEKISTAN 

 Somdev Dev Varman 

New Delhi: Uncapped Vivek Shokeen and Somdev Dev Varman were on Tuesday included in the Davis Cup team for the Asia-Oceania group 1 first-round tie against Uzbekistan in Namangan from February 9 to 11. 

Leander Paes will thus lead a young bunch that also includes Karan Rastogi and Sunil Kumar Sipaeya as the fifth member. 

The inclusion of Shokeen and Dev Varman come in the wake of Rohan Bopanna and Prakash Amritrajs unavailability. 

Amritraj has an injury problem, while Bopanna chose personal career over country. 

Bopanna spoke to me and expressed his wish to attempt to qualify for the Grand Slams in doubles this year. He has got a doubles wild card for an event in Delray Beach (US) this week, AITA secretary Anil Khanna said on Tuesday. 

The 22-year-old Assam-born Dev Varman trains and plays Collegiate tennis in the US. He came through four qualifying rounds and reached the quarter finals of a Futures event earlier this month. He won a Futures meet in Calcutta three years ago and beat the much higher-ranked Aisam-ul Haq Qureshi in the Mumbai Futures before that. 

Shokeen, 19, has just graduated to the seniors circuit. 

Paes was pragmatic about the new-look team. Even with Rohan in the team, playing Uzbekistan in Uzbekistan would have been a tough proposition, the captain said over phone. 

We have a fresh crop of players and my job is to motivate them and give them the best opportunity, Paes said. For me, it is not so much about this result as about trying to set up a team that can make it to the World Group in the future. Being near-sighted is not the way to go about it. We have to prepare these players over a period of time. 

Interestingly, two coaches will accompany the squad to Uzbekistan. While Nandan Bal has been retained his berth, he has got an assistant in Sandeep Kirtane.

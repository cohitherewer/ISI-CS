Linares: Title contender Viswanathan Anand shunned risks and played out a safe draw with defending champion Levon Aronian of Armenia to retain his slender half point lead after the 12th round of the Morelia-Linares Chess Tournament underway here. 

With just two rounds to go in the Category-20 event, the Indian ace took his tally to 7.5 points out of a possible 12 and will now meet Hungarian Peter Leko and Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine in the last two rounds. 

On the other hand, 16-year-old Magnus Carlsen of Norway continued with his impressive run and remained on the heels of Anand after splitting point with top seed Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria. Carlsen took his tally to an impressive seven points and remained in sole second spot. 

The other two games of the day ended decisively with Russian Peter Svidler accounting for an out-of-sort Leko and Ivanchuk losing to another Russian Alexander Morozevich. 

As things stand, Svidler moved to sole third spot after the victory with 6.5 points and maintained the tag of being the only unbeaten player in the tournament while Aronian was pushed to fourth spot on six points. (PTI)

 Fielding can cost us the Cup: Kapil

New Delhi: Kapil Dev, Indias only World Cup winning captain, has said the Indian teams poor fielding skills and running between the wickets could cost them the World Cup. 

Our running between the wickets and fielding can cost us the World Cup, Kapil was quoted as saying by a press release issued by a TV channel. 

Kapil said he was satisfied with the teams performance in batting and bowling. Our batting and bowling is fine but seniors like Sachin and Sourav should chip in with vital inputs to help the captain. 

He also said that stars players should not have any ego hassles and national duty should come first.

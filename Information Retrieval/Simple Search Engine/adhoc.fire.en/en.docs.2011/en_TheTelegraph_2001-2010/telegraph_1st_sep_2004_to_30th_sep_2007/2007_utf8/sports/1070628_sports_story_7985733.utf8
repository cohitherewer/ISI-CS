Merida (Venezuela): The worlds oldest international soccer tournament kicked off Tuesday with Perus stunning 3-0 defeat of Uruguay, while hosts Venezuela missed out on its first Copa America win in 40 years when it drew 2-2 with Bolivia. 

Miguel Villalta scored with a first-half header and Peru added another pair in the second half to upset Uruguay, who are tied with Argentina with the most tournament championships at 14. 

A poorly marked Villalta converted a short corner in the 27th minute and Juan Carlos Marinos blast inside the near post from the top corner of the penalty area in the 70th gave the Peruvians more than enough to win. 

A wide open Paolo Guerrero, on a pass from Andres Mendoza, scored Perus third goal over a tired Uruguay squad in the final minutes. 

Following the Uruguay-Peru match, Venezuela President Hugo Chavez, flanked by Argentine soccer great Diego Maradona and fellow leftist President Evo Morales of Bolivia, watched as the host nation let escape an opportunity to obtain just its second-ever Copa victory. 

Giancarlo Maldonado and Ricardo Paez scored either side of the break to give Venezuela a draw with Bolivia. Venezuela opened the scoring after 21 minutes when Maldonado fired a shot past the diving Bolivian keeper. 

 Bolivia counterattacked and were helped by a Venezuelan own-goal deflection off a Jaime Moreno shot in the 39th minute. 

Venezuela temporarily regained the lead with a breakaway goal by Paez in the 62nd minute. But Bolivian playmaker Juan Carlos Arce tipped in the equaliser with the heel of his outstretched foot with seven minutes remaining. 

Venezuela, who are hosting its first Copa America, is aiming for its first Copa America victory since 1967, when they beat Bolivia 3-0. 

They have never advanced to the tournaments second round.

New Delhi: The Afro-Asian Cup, which will be played in Bangalore and Chennai in the month of June between Asia XI and Africa XI, will also feature a Twenty20 match other than the three ODIs. 

Talking to the newsmen after the meeting of the Afro-Asian Cricket Cooperation (AACC) here on Wednesday, its chairman Sharad Pawar said the tournament will start with the Twenty20 match on June 5 in Bangalore, followed by the three ODIs in Bangalore (June 6) and Chennai (June 9 and 10). The teams for the Twenty20 match, however, will be different from that of the ODI teams. 

The secretary of the AACC, Ashraful Huq said there will be two Twenty20 matches on that day. While the first one will be between the womens teams of Asia XI and Africa XI, their men counterparts will clash later in the day. 

The three-match series has total prize money of $100,000. While the winners will receive $25,000, the Man-of-the-Tournament will be richer by $10,000. The Man-of-the-Match in each of the three ODIs will get $5,000. Each player of the two teams will receive a match fee of $5,000. 

The Asia XI will be selected by a four-member committee comprising Chetan Chauhan (India), Majid Khan (Pakistan), Lalith Kaluperuma (Sri Lanka) and A.S.M Faruk (Bangladesh) in Dhaka on Mpay 11. 

While cricketers from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are eligible for selection in the Asia XI, the Africa XI will be chosen from South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya.

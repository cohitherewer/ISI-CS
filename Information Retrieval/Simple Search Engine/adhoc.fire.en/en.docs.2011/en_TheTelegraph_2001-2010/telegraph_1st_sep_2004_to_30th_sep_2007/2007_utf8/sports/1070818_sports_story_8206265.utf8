Kuala Lumpur: Anup Sridhars dream run in the World Badminton Championships was halted by top seed and defending champion Lin Dan but only after he had given the Chinese a scare in the quarter finals here on Friday. 

Sridhar played courageously against his formidable opponent before losing 20-22, 9-21 in 38 minutes. 

The Indian who knocked off Olympic champion Taufiq Hidayat and former All England champion Muhammad Hafiz Hashim in the earlier rounds led the world No. 1 20-19 in the first game. 

Luck, though, was not on Sridhars side. Lin took three points on the trot to take the game. Lin was in command in the second game and did not concede an inch to tame the giantkiller without much trouble. 

Sridhar should be happy with what he has achieved in the tournament. His world ranking of 40 is sure to get a major boost following his quarter final showing here. 

Lin will take on fourth-seed compatriot Bao Chunlai, who beat Kenneth Jonassen of Denmark 21-11, 21-11. 

Sridhar, whose deft net play has been his forte, surprised Lin with his wristy game. The Indian got 12 net winners to Lins three in the first game. The Bangalore boy played with a big heart. He fell behind 2-6, but caught up gradually to level at 10-10 and even nosed ahead 12-11. 

It was a neck-and-neck affair from then on. Sridhar had game point at 20-19, but could not convert it. Lin was in no mood to give his opponent another chance. 

Lin used the experience of the first game to turn the tables on the Indian in the second. 

The Chinese and dictated terms to notch up eight net winners compared to Sridhars three. The Chinese raced to a 7-1 lead in the second game and it was too wide a gap for Sridhar to bridge. (PTI)

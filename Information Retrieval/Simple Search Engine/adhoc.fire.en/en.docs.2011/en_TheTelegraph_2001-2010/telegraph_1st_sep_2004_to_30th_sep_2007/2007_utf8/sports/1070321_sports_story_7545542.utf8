 Hogg not lacking in self-belief

Basseterre: Despite going wicket-less in six ODIs before the World Cup, Brad Hogg never lost his confidence. 

Australia equalled a 10-year-old losing record after being beaten in two tri-series finals to England and three ODIs in New Zealand, but Hogg still backed himself. 

Hogg took four for 27 in Australias 229-run win over Netherlands at St Kitts, more of a return for his perseverance, he thinks, than a relief. 

Over the last six months, Ive been bowling really well, he said Monday. I had a period there where I didnt get any wickets for six games, and I reckon five of those game are the best Ive ever bowled for my whole career. 

Weve been thinking about this tournament for the past six months, weve had a couple of disappointing games the last month against New Zealand, but where we went wrong there was that we were so focused on the World Cup. 

The left-arm wristpinner took two for 28 against England in a warm-up on St Vincent to cement his spot in the Australian team, no mean feat with pacemen Stuart Clark and Mitchell Johnson watching on from the outside. 

He had Ian Bell (56) stumped to break a 116-run stand and then dismissed England captain Michael Vaughan (62) to play a crucial role in Australias five-wicket win. Both wickets came from wrong-uns. 

That is probably my best ball the wrong-un, he said. I just think it turned a lot more than it did in Australia. The wicket was just pretty conducive to my sort of bowling, so I was pretty happy with that. (AP)

 Randhawa tied 9th 

Dubai: Jyoti Randhawa and Jeev Milkha Singh were left stranded due to poor light and stoppage of play that prevented half the field from completing their second round at the Dubai Desert Classic golf tournament on Friday. 

Randhawa, starting the day at six-under, was two-under through 12 holes for a total of eight-under and tied ninth spot while Jeev, starting at two-under overnight, was two-under through 16 holes for an aggregate of four-under for tied 35th. 

Indias third player Harmeet Kahlon (73) will spend an agonising night waiting to see if he makes the cut, which will come at either two or three-under. Kahlon, here on a sponsors invite, shot 73 to be two-under and is currently tied 67th with top 65 and ties to make the last two rounds at the Majlis golf course. 

Britains Ross Fisher maintained his unlikely surge on Friday, a second successive seven-under-par 65 securing a two-stroke lead at the end of the day. Three-time champion Ernie Els was second on 12-under with four holes left when darkness fell. Earlier, play was halted for over two hours due to a thunderstorm at the Emirates Golf Club. 

Briton Graeme McDowell (69) and Swede Peter Hanson (65) were joint third on 10-under with another Swede Henrik Stenson, who must also return on Saturday morning for his last four holes. Tiger Woods (67) finished one shot further back on nine-under. 

Randhawa played some excellent golf and birdied the third and eighth and in between made two great saves for pars. When rain and thunderstorms stopped play, he was on the seventh, where he made a fine save for par. He birdied the eighth, but bogeyed the ninth. He again birdied the 10th to come to two-under. 

Jeev bogeyed the first, but birdied the third, ninth, 12th and 15th to come to two-under for the and four-under for tournament. 

I was not happy at missing the par-fives. I birdied one of the three I have played so far, said Jeev. (PTI)

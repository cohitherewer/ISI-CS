 Injury forces Beckham to practise alone 

 - Doubts if he can withstand extensive travelling persist

It may have lacked the festivity and fanfare of his presentation, but David Beckhams gentle jogging session at the Home Depot Center on Monday was every bit as significant. Having gone to great lengths to assert himself as a team player for the Los Angeles Galaxy, Beckham gave an unfortunate impression of him and them as he trained apart from his teammates to restore some strength in his swollen left ankle. 

Wearing a gold jersey and navy shirts, Beckham was wary not to take much strain on the ankle as he settled down to practise in front of 1,000 fans. With a broad smile and the occasional wave, he appeared in no obvious discomfort, working on his lateral movement and short-range kicking. 

He did not train fully, yet there was little to doubt his assurance that he would be ready for a Galaxy debut on Saturday against Chelsea, completing his recovery from the ankle injury he sustained in Englands European qualifier against Estonia last month. 

[Galaxy coach Frank Yallop said the midfielders progress will be monitored daily, agencies report on Tuesday. His ankle is quite swollen Obviously we want to get him in the team as quickly as we can but we dont want to put him in any danger of re-injuring it, Yallop told a news conference. 

I think it has responded after the last two days. The swelling has come down but hes not moving around and feeling as comfortable as he should. These types of injuries can quickly heal up and each day it is getting better and better. We are hoping that it heals quickly and he can have some part in the game on Saturday, he said.] 

Beckham maintains that he is physically great, although serious doubts persist among his colleagues in Major League Soccer as to whether his fitness can withstand the 50,000 air miles he is set to cover by the end of the season. As Matt Reis, goalkeeper for the New England Revolution, put it: The travelling is huge thats the big thing that a lot of the European players dont realise. Its even more draining than the weather. 

The Galaxys away matches to the East Coast and Midwest could add 20,000 miles, even before Beckham accounts for his England commitments or his clubs plans to stage a major international tour, taking in Australia. Beckham is aware of his fragile state, and has sought to stabilise his ankle with 30 miles of running in the south of France before his MLS adventure begins at Pizza Hut Park, Dallas, on July 31. 

But the Galaxys extensive wanderings have become a question of some contention, forcing a compromise to be reached between club president Alexi Lalas and England head coach Steve McClaren that allows Beckham enough rest between matches. Then there is the equally fraught matter of how he travels. 

Charter flights are banned for MLS clubs, as they are believed to confer an unfair competitive advantage, but the Galaxy have been working to exploit a loophole in the leagues policy that enables teams to fly privately for security reasons. 

The estimated 300m hinging on Beckhams success in America has made his fitness a cause for national concern. Despite the efforts to shelter him, the expectation is that he will need no such looking after on the pitch.

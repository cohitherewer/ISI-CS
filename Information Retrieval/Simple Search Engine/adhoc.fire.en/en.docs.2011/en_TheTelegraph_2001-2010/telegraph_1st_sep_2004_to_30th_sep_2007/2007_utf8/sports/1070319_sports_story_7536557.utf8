 Steroids put Gillespie back on course

Gros Islet: New Zealand fast bowler Mark Gillespie almost booked a flight home after a viral infection left him an early bystander at the World Cup. 

Gillespies bowling arm became numb during his journey to the West Indies earlier this month following a rare reaction to a throat virus. I was contemplating to go home, but its improved with steroids so Im really positive about things, Gillespie said during his teams training session on Saturday. 

He explained how the problem first emerged. During our stop over in LA airport, I was having a shower just to freshen up and trying to shampoo my hair and my arm just wouldnt respond really. 

The 27-year-old, who made his ODI debut in December 2006, has had to sit out two warm up games in the Caribbean as well as New Zealands six-wicket win over England in the group C clash on Friday. 

Having resumed light training, he is now hopeful of playing some part in the tournament. 

Its nearing 100 per cent. Its still a little bit dodgy but Im bowling again and today Ill be throwing, so thats the big thing, to see how that goes, said Gillespie. 

Its so important in a one-day game. You cant hide in the field if you cant throw, so thatll be the telling thing.

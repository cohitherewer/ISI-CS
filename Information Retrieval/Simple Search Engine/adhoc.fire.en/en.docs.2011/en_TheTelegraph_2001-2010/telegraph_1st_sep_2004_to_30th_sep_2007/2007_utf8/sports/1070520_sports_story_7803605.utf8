 Afridi guides Pak to five-wicket 

 win

 - Allrounder hits 32 off one Bandara over

Abu Dhabi: Shahid Afridis swashbuckling 73 not out led Pakistan to a five-wicket win over World Cup runners-up Sri Lanka in the first match of the limited-overs Warid Series here on Friday. 

Pakistan, chasing Sri Lankas 235 for nine, reached 239 for five with eight overs to spare. Afridi struck eight fours and four sixes in 34 deliveries, including 32 runs off spinner Malinga Bandaras final over at Sheikh Zayed Stadium. 

Pakistan needed five runs per over until that stage, and that over eased the required rate to just over two after Afridi hit the leg-spinner for 4,4,6,6,6,6. 

Wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal hit a run-a-ball unbeaten 51 and shared an 81-run unbeaten stand for the sixth wicket with Afridi, who went to the crease after captain Shoaib Malik was run out for 11 with the total at 137. 

Pakistan were given a sound start by openers Salman Butt and Imran Nazir, who tallied 53 before Afridi, running for Nazir, ran him out after a 24-ball 38 studded with half-a-dozen fours and a six. 

Afridi more than made up for that run out, but he was let off twice by debutant Ishara Amerasinghe at 25 and 58. 

Earlier, Farvez Mahroofs career-best 69 not out off 54 balls set up Sri Lankas challenging total after they were reduced to 105 for three in the packed 20,000-seat stadium. 

Mahroof smacked nine hits to the fences and the cleared the ropes once. He smashed Umar Gul, Pakistans most successful bowler, for 14 runs in the last over, including a six over long off and two fours. 

Sri Lanka were revived by Mahroof and Chamara Silva, who chipped in with 47 before becoming the third run out victim when Abdul Razzaq threw down at the non-strikers end off his own bowling as Silva tried to steal a cheeky single. 

Sri Lanka elected to bat after winning the toss, with temperatures steaming above 40 degrees Celsius.

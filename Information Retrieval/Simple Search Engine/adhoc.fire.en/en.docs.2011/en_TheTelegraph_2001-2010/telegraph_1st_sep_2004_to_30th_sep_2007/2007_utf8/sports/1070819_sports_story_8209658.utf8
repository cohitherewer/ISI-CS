Calcutta: A day after directing their ire at the referee for the loss to Mohun Bagan, East Bengal launched a stinging attack on Jose Ramirez Barreto. On Saturday, Alvito DCunha alleged the Brazilian striker had spat at Madhab Das before being tripped inside the penalty box. Barreto had converted the resultant penalty. 

Madhab pushed Barreto from behind and the referee pointed to the penalty spot But it was Barreto who started it all after spitting at Madhab. No one is talking about this Even the referee decided to remain a spectator, Alvito alleged. 

The Mohun Bagan star, however, dismissed the allegation as a load of rubbish. 

 So they think that was the reason for losing 3-4. Its just an excuse. It is the first time I am hearing this. Utter nonsense Barreto said after a round of sepak takraw at the club lawn in the evening. 

When you lose, you dont look at yourself but blame it on other things The referee, the crowd, the rain, the ground condition I would advise them to make a list of their grievances and write to the IFA, he added. 

Barreto admitted that there had been a lot of jostling and pushing as Madhab tried to keep a leash on him. 

We also exchanged a few words But all that is normal and part of the game. Nothing of the sort theyre alleging happened. They can always have a look at the recording of the match to clear any lingering doubts. It only goes to show their frustration. 

Barreto said he was satisfied with the result. Three points matter in the end. Whether the result is 4-3 or 4-1 is of little consequence. I would have been content even if we had won 1-0. 

Coach Carlos Roberto Pereira also dismissed the spitting allegation. Its just an excuse. They must be talking of some other match and not the one that was played Friday! 

Mohun Bagan assistant coach Satyajit Chatterjee was more caustic. I have been around for long enough to know what all goes behind all these allegations. We can also say three of their players spat at us. How does it matter now! Why didnt they draw the referees attention then? 

Barreto is looking ahead with optimism. Its time to move on Weve got to concentrate on the next match. 

East Bengal, meanwhile, in a letter to the IFA have condemned Mohun Bagans pressure tactics on the referee in the lead up to the Derby. 

As a result, we have been a victim of the referees decisions. If we dont get a proper explanation from the IFA secretary, we will have to think about playing in the League, a senior club official said.

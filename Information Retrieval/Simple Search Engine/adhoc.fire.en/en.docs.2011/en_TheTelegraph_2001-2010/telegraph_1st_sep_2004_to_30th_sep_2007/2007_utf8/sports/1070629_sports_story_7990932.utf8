 Capello gets the boot

Madrid: Real Madrid sacked coach Fabio Capello on Thursday, 11 days after he led them to their first Primera Liga title in four years. 

The 61-year-old Italian, who also won the 1996-97 league title with Real during his first spell at the club, had two years left on his contract which Spanish media reported was worth 9.0 million euros ($12.10 million). 

We have taken the decision not to continue with Fabio Capello next season, said Real Madrid sporting director Predrag Mijatovic. 

It was a difficult decision, but it was a unanimous one... We dont think Fabio Capello is the right person to lead Real Madrid into the future given what we want this club to achieve. 

Capello becomes the second successive coach to win the title with Madrid and then be sacked. Vicente del Bosque was fired a day after winning the title in 2003 their last triumph until they won it again last week.

 Theres no pressure, no fear: McGrath 

Gros Islet: Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath became the leading wicket-taker in a single World Cup after taking three wickets on Wednesday in the crushing seven-wicket semi-final victory over South Africa. 

The 37-year-old McGrath, who will retire at the end of the tournament, passed Sri Lankan seamer Chaminda Vaas record of 23 wickets when he took the second of his three wickets. Despite his success in the Caribbean, McGrath insisted on Wednesday that he will retire after Saturdays final, as announced earlier. And he is keen to finish on a high. 

The fact that Im going to retire is probably one of the reasons Im bowling so well, he said. Im just going out there, trying to enjoy it, make the most of it, make the most of every game I play. Theres no pressure, no fear, no anything. 

Ive probably bowled a little differently this tournament. Probably bowled a little more aggressively than I have done in the past. Thats the reason Ive got a few more wickets, Ive probably gone for a few more runs than I normally do. Its worked out with 25 wickets; (Shaun) Tait has 23 wickets, Brad Hogg has 20 and Bracks (Nathan Bracken) is doing well too. The fact that weve bowled every team out is a huge lift for us, bar Bangladesh who we only got 20 overs with. 

McGraths 25 wickets have come at an average of 13.04 runs each from 10 games. Vaas had set the record in South Africa in 2003. 

McGrath took three for 18 from eight overs at the Beausejour Stadium, playing a crucial role in dismissing South Africa for 149 and reserving Australias place in the final against Sri Lanka in Bridgetown. 

I always love playing South Africa, theyre up for a good battle. They are quite an aggressive side, he said. 

Theres just one side I enjoy less losing against than South Africa, he said in a clear reference to traditional rivals England. 

McGrath retired from Test cricket earlier this year by taking the last England wicket of a triumphant 5-0 sweep that saw Australia reclaim the Ashes they lost two years earlier in England. 

He agreed to stay on to help Australias bid to win an unprecedented third successive World Cup and said the legacy of Australian pace bowling was safe. 

We have plenty of fast bowling options. Look at the four bowlers here, we have different kinds of bowlers who complement each other, he said. There are others following in my boots. 

McGrath said batsmen seemed to be less anxious to face him rather than the others. 

With Bracken and Tait bowling the way they are, I normally come on with couple of wickets down. The way these two have bowled, it seems the batsmen prefer to get to the other end to face me. 

The express-fast Tait took four wickets on Wednesday. He blasted South African batsmen out with balls delivered at 95 mph pace, rather than McGraths more subtle, nagging deliveries.

 ICL still in talks with Warne, McGrath 

Melbourne: Shane Warne is ready to join the Indian Cricket League (ICL) provided his conditions are met while his former teammate Glenn McGrath is likely to follow suit, according to managers of the star Australian cricketers. 

With former England captain Tony Greig acting as conduit, both the retired players are in negotiation with the ICL, Australian media reported here Wednesday. 

Warnes manager James Erskine told a newspaper that he had been meeting Greig and a ICL official. 

They havent offered what we have asked for, so negotiations are proceeding, Erskine told the daily. 

The progress has been rather slow with McGrath even though his manager, Warren Craig, asserted that the fast bowler has not ruled out playing in the league. 

Craig said, We certainly havent ruled it out. Now Lara has signed, things might start to hot up a bit.

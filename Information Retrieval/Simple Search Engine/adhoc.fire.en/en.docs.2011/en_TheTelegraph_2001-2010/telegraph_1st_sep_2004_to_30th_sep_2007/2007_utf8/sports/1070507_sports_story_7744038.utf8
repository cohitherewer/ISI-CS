Srinagar: Kapil Dev on Sunday asked the Indian team to put on a collective effort rather than relying on the heroics of any one player in the upcoming away series against Bangladesh. 

There are some individuals whose performance is matchless but they are not bigger than the game. We are hopeful that the whole team will stand up again and face the challenge collectively, the 1983 World Cup winning captain said on the sidelines of a golf tournament here. 

We glorify one player when the team wins. It should not be like that as the whole team contributes in the win. Likewise, whole team should be held responsible for the defeat, he said. 

Kapil said he was hopeful that the team would perform well in Bangladesh and return victorious. 

About the early exit from the World Cup, he said: Mistakes have been committed but the time demands to rectify them, make amends and march ahead Let us forget about the past... What happened in the World Cup and who is responsible Instead, we should concentrate on the betterment of the cricket in the country. 

On new coachs appointment, he said: The issue has been blown out of proportion. Coaches and managers are meant to manage the things but finally it boils down to the players who have to perform well and make the country proud. (PTI)

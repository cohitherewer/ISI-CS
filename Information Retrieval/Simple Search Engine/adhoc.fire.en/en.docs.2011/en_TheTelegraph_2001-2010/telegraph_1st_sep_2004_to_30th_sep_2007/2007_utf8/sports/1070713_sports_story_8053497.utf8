 Coach Biswajit throws a challenge to Big Two

Calcutta: Biswajit Bhattacharya loves to thrive under challenge. 

Having accepted the job of guiding Chirag United SC this season, the former Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting coach believes he has enough ammunition at his disposal to give the Big Two a few sleepless nights. 

United SC, according to Biswajit, represent the proverbial nemesis to the title-hopefuls, a side which is capable of upsetting the favourites but is not quite out there to stake a claim to the crown itself. The former India midfielder thinks his immediate task will be to make the players perform to potential. 

United SC (formerly known as Ever-Ready) have always been a strong side. They have regularly given big teams like East Bengal and Mohun Bagan a run for their money in the local tournaments. They should also get ready for a few sleepless nights in the coming season as well. 

However, I would like to see the players believe more in themselves so that their promise is not limited to creating some upsets here and there. They must play to become the champions, thats my challenge, he said, while watching United SCs scratchy 3-2 win over Howrah Union in the Trades Cup semi-final on Thursday. 

We are basically a bunch of young, under-19 players. They need to be moulded into a winning unit, he added. 

Former East Bengal midfielder Sasthi Duley and Mohun Bagan defender Dulal Biswas have joined the side. They are my assets. But we must protect them considering the long season, the coach said. 

The club is planning to rope in a foreign striker as the Liberian Theo, who scored the teams first goal on Thursday, has been found wanting in delivering the goods. We also need to pay attention to the defence, Biswajit, who took charge on Monday and started practice the following day, pointed out.

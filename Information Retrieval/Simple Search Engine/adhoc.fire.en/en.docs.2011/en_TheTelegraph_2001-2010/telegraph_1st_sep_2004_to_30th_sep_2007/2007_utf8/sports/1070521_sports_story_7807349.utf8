London: England extended their lead over the West Indies to 221 runs at tea on Day Four of the first Test on Sunday after Monty Panesar recorded a personal best of six for 129. 

 Kevin Pietersen scored 109 to 

 help England declare their second innings at 284 for eight. 

 The West Indies, chasing 401 to go one up, were seven for 

 no loss. 

England were 105 for two in their second innings at the interval, after bowling the West Indies out for 437. Corey Collymore, who took two for 15 from six overs with the new ball, dismissed captain Andrew Strauss (24) and Owais Shah (4). 

Alastair Cook, one of Englands four century-makers in the first innings, was unbeaten on 52. 

In the morning session left-arm spinner Panesar completed his fourth five-wicket haul in Test matches, winning two further lbw decisions from umpire Asad Rauf. After bowling Devon Smith with his first ball of the match, each of his remaining victims were lbw. 

Shivnarine Chanderpaul drove his first delivery on Sunday, a full toss, through cover for four but was given out lbw three balls later for a patient 74 from 193 balls. 

Jerome Taylor showed his team mates how to play spin by moving down the pitch and on-driving a four from the final ball of Panesars first over. 

Taylor continued to bat attractively, taking boundaries off Panesar and Powell joined in the fun by hooking Steve Harmison for four when the fast bowler took over from Liam Plunkett at the Pavilion End. 

Harmison finally got his first wicket of the match when Taylor on 21 sliced a catch to substitute Lee Hodgson at point, fielding in place of Matthew Hoggard who left the field with a thigh strain on Saturday. 

Powell played two of the best shots of the match, moving outside his leg stump to off-drive Harmison for four and taking another four off the next ball with a classical cover-drive. 

He took his score to a Test best 36 before Panesar wrapped up the innings when Collymore (1) was hit on the pads in front of his stumps. 

Strauss survived a difficult chance on 10 off Powell to wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin, who failed to gather a low edge, but fell to Collymore guiding the ball to Runako Morton at second slip.

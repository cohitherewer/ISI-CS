 Zaheer: Good to peak at right time

Margao: If Sourav Gangulys has been a fairytale comeback, Zaheer Khans return has been equally stunning and impressive. For someone who was thought to be unfit for one-day cricket not many months ago, has not only made his way back, but will be crucial to Indias World Cup hopes in the West Indies. Indias main strike bowler showed his class once again at the Nehru Stadium on Wednesday. 

His five for 42 set the ball rolling Indias way in the third one-dayer. The pacer was brilliant, at times unplayable. His pace was threatening on this slow wicket, he was sending down yorkers at will, getting the ball to move off the seam and sending the batsmen into a tizzy. Only Maravan Atapattu managed to play him with some confidence. 

His performance since the South Africa series proves that he has worked on his fitness, and reinforced his commitment and determination. Despite stiff competition from Rahul Dravid, the Man of the Match went Zaheers way Wednesday. 

Ive been bowling with a good rhythm in the past few months. Im happy to continue in the same vein, a satisfied Zaheer said after the match. Its good to peak at the right time. The next ten weeks are going to be very crucial for us. 

He did not try anything extra and stuck to the basics. There was always going to be something for the bowlers in the first half-hour. I concentrated on putting the ball in the right areas and it paid dividends. 

How did the stint with Worcestershire during the last County season help? I bowled a lot of overs and it helped. It improved my match fitness, he explained. 

Rahul Dravid was also all praise for Zaheer. Zak performed beautifully for us. Munaf has also bowled well this season. The last 10-12 games have been superb. Ajit has bowled well too. These three boys are very important for us in the world Cup. These are our key players. Zaheer is one of them. I just hope hes peaking at the right time. 

I would have liked to bat first as well today. But after Zak bowled a brilliant spell to get them down to six for three, I wasnt disappointed. 

Mahela Jayawardene was equally effusive. Zaheer made the difference He bowled well and controlled well at the start and the end.

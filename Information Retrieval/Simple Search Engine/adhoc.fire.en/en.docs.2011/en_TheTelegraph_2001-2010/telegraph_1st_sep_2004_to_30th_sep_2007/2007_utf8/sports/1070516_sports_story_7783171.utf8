 ZC hits back at Australia

Durban: Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) described the scrapping of Australias three-match tour as unacceptable on Tuesday. 

The tour, which was scheduled for September, was effectively cancelled when the Australian government instructed the world champions not to travel to the African state and Zimbabwe rejected an offer of playing at a neutral venue. 

The situation is unacceptable and unfortunate, ZC media manager Lovemore Banda said. 

Equally (unacceptable and unfortunate) is the proposal that the tour be moved to a different venue because we are entitled to our home tours and in our view, there is no reason why this tour should not be held here as scheduled under the ICC Future Tours Programme, Banda added.

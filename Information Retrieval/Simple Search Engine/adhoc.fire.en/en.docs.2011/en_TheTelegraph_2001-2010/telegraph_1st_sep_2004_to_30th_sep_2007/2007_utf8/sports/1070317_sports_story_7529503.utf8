 Sunny playing mental game, says McGrath

Basseterre: Glenn McGrath and Brad Hodge joined the chorus in slamming Sunil Gavaskar for linking Australian behaviour with the death of David Hookes, saying the Indian greats remarks could damage his relationship with Australian cricket. 

It is very disrespectful. Sunny was an amazing cricketer, but I think this time hes gone beyond, McGrath said. 

Gavaskar recently described the Australians as unpopular winners because of their awful on-field behaviour. 

After skipper Ricky Ponting shot back and defended his team, Gavaskar stuck to his guns and cited the death of former Test batsman Hookes outside a Melbourne bar to illustrate his point. 

McGrath said: Fair enough, if thats what he thinks, hes allowed to comment on the team. But I think when you start bringing Hookes into it, thats crossing the line. 

McGrath, known for his use of abusive language on the field to unsettle batsmen and for being engaged in an ugly verbal duel with Ramnaresh Sarwan in Antigua in 2003, said that Gavaskars outburst could damage his relationship with Australian cricket. 

I think potentially it could be, well wait and see. The comments in themselves are very disappointing when hes mentioning Hookes and you really feel for Hookesys family, McGrath was quoted as saying in the media. 

McGrath also felt Gavaskar could be playing a mental game to have a crack at the tough Aussies. 

I think with it being the World Cup, Sunny sees Australia as the main threat to beat India and hes trying to put us off our game, McGrath said. 

Defending his teams behaviour, McGrath said, Ive seen other teams do exactly what we have. I dont think the Australians are any worse than any other teams. 

Its fine to say about us, but at the end of the day I think the Indian team does it as well as every other team, he said. 

McGraths teammate Hodge also sounded upset about Gavaskar dragging in his former coachs name into the matter. 

Im pretty disappointed about comments made about my former coach Hookes. Thats all I am going to say about it, Hodge said.

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: IFA secretary Subrata Dutta has promised to initiate a special audit inquiry headed by finance committee chief Vivek Ruia following Tuesday nights fire in the accounts department of the association office. 

Announced this during the IFA governing body meeting, held at CSJC on Thursday, Dutta said: I dont see the accounts, its supervised by the treasurer (K.D. Pal). I can only point to any inconsistency once the inquiry gets over. Meanwhile, East Bengal and Mohun Bagan officials also called for a proper inquiry.

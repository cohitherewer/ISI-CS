 Healy under fire for gesture

Melbourne: Former Australian wicketkeeper-turned TV commentator Ian Healy was forced to apologise on Friday for making an insensitive gesture as Andrew Symonds spoke about breast cancer. 

Healey pretended he was playing a violin as Symonds explained in the commentary box that he was playing with a pink bat grip in order to raise awareness about breast cancer. 

Healy denied he was making light of breast cancer. 

People have perceived me to be mocking breast cancer, now no one in the world would do that, he said. (AFP)

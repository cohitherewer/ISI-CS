 Bagan to miss Manju in Federation Cup

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: India defender N. S. Manju will miss the Federation Cup through injury, providing another blow to Mohun Bagan ahead of their campaign in Ludhiana. 

Manju picked up a groin injury during practice at their home ground on Monday. He was later advised a fortnights rest after preliminary medical examination. 

Manjus injury is a further setback for the Mohun Bagan defence, which is already weakened by the absence of Deepak Mondal. 

Mondal, who suffered a knee injury during the Nehru Cup and was operated on by Dr Anant Joshi in Mumbai, is unlikely to recover before the New Year. 

Ive been told that Manju would be out of action for at least two weeks. Its a setback but injury is part of the game. I have enough resources to cope with any crisis, coach Carlos Roberto Pereira said. 

The Brazilian also welcomed Bhaichung Bhutias arrival in the side, saying it would boost the players confidence. 

With the national players back, Im pretty hopeful about the tournament, he said. 

Bhaichung, incidentally, is going to lead an Indian club for the first time in his career. Mohun Bagan have been the most successful team in Federation Cup history, having won the title 12 times. 

Jose Ramirez Barreto, however, warned his teammates against complacency. No doubt Bhaichungs availability has made us a strong side now. But mind it, there is a negative aspect attached to it. Weve not practised together (with the Nehru Cup-winning members) for a long time, he said. 

Mohun Bagan players are leaving for Ludhiana on Tuesday. 

THE SQUAD Goalkeepers: Sangram Mukherjee, Shilton Paul. Defenders: Habibur Rehman Mondal, Peter Siddiqui, Peter Odafe, Rauf Khan, Subhasish Roy Chowdhury, Anit Ghosh, Sanjib Maria. Midfielders: Lalkamal Bhowmick, James Singh, Dharamjit Singh, Suman Dutta, Chinmoy Sarkar, Shanmugam Venkatesh, Mohammed Gafari. Forwards: Bhaichung Bhutia, Jose Barreto, P. C.

 Aussies pull out of Champions Trophy

Sydney/Karachi: Olympic hockey champions Australia have pulled out of the six-nation Champions Trophy to be held in Lahore in December. 

Hockey Australia made the decision not to send a squad to the December 1-9 meet following foreign ministry advice against travelling to Pakistan, chief executive Linden Adamson said on Tuesday. 

This is the third time Hockey Australia has decided against sending its mens team to Pakistan for the annual tournament because of security fears. Australia also declined to play the 2004 tournament in Lahore, and the 2001 event, which was shifted to Rotterdam. 

Adamson said the decision would adversely affect Australias Olympic defence at next years Beijing Games. 

Its a pretty serious decision to take if we think its going to affect our Olympic preparations, but we cant risk the safety of the players and staff, he said. 

Australias decision comes after a wave of suicide bombings and other attacks by Islamic militants in Pakistan. 

The Pakistan Hockey Federation has criticised the pull-out, saying their fears were unfounded and that the decision was premature. (AGENCIES)

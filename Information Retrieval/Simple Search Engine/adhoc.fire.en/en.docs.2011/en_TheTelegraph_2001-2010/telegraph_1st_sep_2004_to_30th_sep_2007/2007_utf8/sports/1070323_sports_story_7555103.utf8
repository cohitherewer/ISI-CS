The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Final Test versus Pakistan in city

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Test match will return to Calcutta in a big way next season as the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has allotted the city the final Test of the three-match series against Pakistan. This was informed by the board secretary Niranjan Shah after the BCCI working committee meeting here on Thursday. 

Two more venues from the eastern zone Guwahati and Jamshedpur have been chosen to host ODIs against Australia and Pakistan. In the 2007-08 season, India will host seven ODIs and one Twenty20 match against Australia, five one-dayers and three Tests against Pakistan and three Tests against South Africa. 

Apart from these matches, India will play three offshore ODIs in Ireland in June and one in Glasgow. Matches would be played against either Sri Lanka, Australia or South Africa, Shah said. The tour and fixtures committee will decide about the dates, he added. 

The meeting also deliberated on the issue of telecasting rights with Nimbus, which has landed in trouble after the introduction of the sports broadcasting bill and other new regulations of mandatory sharing of feeds of live matches of national importance. Top Nimbus officials, who joined the meeting for sometime, are believed to have asked their deal with the BCCI to be reworked and be reduced by Rs 350 crores to compensate the new regulation. 

The BCCI vice president, Rajeev Shukla, however, said both BCCI and Nimbus have decided to resolve the issue amicably. 

Shukla however declined to reveal more information. A BCCI source later said the total loss incurred by Nimbus could be around 12 per cent and the company will equally share the shortfall with the cricket board. 

THE VENUES 

ODIs (vs Australia and Pakistan): Kanpur, Mumbai, Gwalior, Guwahati, Bangalore, Faridabad, Mohali, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kochi, Jamshedpur, Jaipur, Vadodara and Nagpur. 

Tests: Bangalore, Delhi and Calcutta (vs Pakistan); Kanpur/Chennai, Ahmedabad and Nagpur (vs South Africa).

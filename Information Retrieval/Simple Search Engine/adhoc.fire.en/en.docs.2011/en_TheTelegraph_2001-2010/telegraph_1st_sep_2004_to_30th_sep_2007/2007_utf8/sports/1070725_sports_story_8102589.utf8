 Team pulls out after cyclist tests positive

Pau: Tour de France rider Alexandre Vinokourov tested positive for a banned blood transfusion after winning last weekends time trial, prompting his Astana team to pull out of the race, a team spokeswoman said Tuesday. 

The positive test of the Kazakh rider, a one-time favourite to win cyclings premier event, dealt a heavy blow to a sport already reeling from a spate of doping scandals. Vino has tested positive and the team is leaving the Tour, team spokeswoman Corinne Druey said, using the riders nickname. 

The positive test took place after the Kazakh riders victory in the 13th stage time trial on Saturday, a French sports newspaper reported on its website. 

Alessandro Petacchi, meanwhile, was cleared of doping charges on Tuesday by the Italian cycling federation. Petacchi had registered a non-negative test for the asthma drug salbutamol after winning the 11th stage of the Giro dItalia on May 23, although he had a certificate from the international cycling union that permits him to use the medication.

 Bayliss new Lanka coach 

Colombo: Australian Trevor Bayliss will succeed his compatriot Tom Moody as Sri Lankas next cricket coach, the cricket board announced Thursday. 

A distinguished panel of former players from the Sri Lankan national team including Aravinda de Silva, Michael Tissera, Anura Tennakoon, Ranjan Madugalle, Duleep Mendis and Sidhath Wettimuny interviewed Bayliss before appointing him coach for the next two years, Sri Lanka Cricket spokesman Samantha Algama said. 

He has impressed everybody, Algama said. 

Bayliss, 44, played first-class cricket for New South Wales and later became a successful coach. 

He will start work from August 1 replacing Moody, who decided to return to Australia to be with his family after guiding Sri Lanka to this years World Cup final in the West Indies. 

Bayliss had earlier told an Australian newspaper he would take up the Sri Lanka job if it was offered to him. 

Its a job with an international team, and one of the better international teams, so youd be nuts not to hear them out, Bayliss was quoted as saying by the paper.

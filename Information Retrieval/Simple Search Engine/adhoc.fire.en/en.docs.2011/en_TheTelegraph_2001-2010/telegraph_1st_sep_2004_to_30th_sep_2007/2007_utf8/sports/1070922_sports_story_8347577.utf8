 McLaren not to appeal 

Munich: McLaren-Mercedes will not appeal the $100 million fine and exclusion from the 2007 constructors championship over the Ferrari spying charges, the team said on Friday. 

We accept things as they are. All our attention is now exclusively focused on the sport and the last three races of the season, said Norbert Haug, Mercedes vice-president of sporting activities. 

We want our two drivers to be in the first two positions of the drivers championship at the finish of the last Grand Prix of the season in Brazil. 

Hence, Ferrari were confirmed as Formula One champions for a record 15th time on Friday after McLaren accepted an unprecedented $100 million fine and loss of all their 2007 constructors points. 

On September 13 the FIA punished McLaren for gaining a competitive advantage from secret information leaked to them by ex-Ferrari engineer Nigel Stepney.

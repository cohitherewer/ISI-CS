The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Chimas test begins today 

 - NFL tie versus Md. Sporting 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Its redemption time for Mohun Bagan, while for their opponents Mohammedan Sporting its time to prove a point when both the city teams take in the derby match of 11th ONGC National Football League at Barasat Stadium on Friday. 

And its a real test for Mohun Bagans Nigerian coach Chima Okerie. As a player the former striker had on many occasions saved Mohun Bagan from the blushes, it remains to be seen whether he can do the same as a coach to lift the club from the nadir. 

Mohun Bagan, having played five matches (one win, one draw and three losses) are lying at the bottom of the table, while Mohammedan with one win, two draws and two losses are two places ahead. 

The coach has just one objective from the match. Im going for three points, why should I be happy with one point?, asked Chima. 

However, the Mohun Bagan camp is telling a different story. While their star striker Bhaichung Bhutia, nursing a hamstring, tried it hard in the gym to be back for the match, Fabio Cortez Vidal, who also has an injury, could not attend the two-hour practice session in the morning. 

Just to make matters worse six of their players (Subrata Pal, Mehtab Hussain, Surajit Bose, Dhanraj Ravanan, Sushil Singh and Subhasis) will have to skip the match since they are attending the India camp for the Olympic qualifiers. 

Meanwhile, its likely that former FC Kochin custodian Dinesh Nair may be roped in as the goalkeeping coach for Mohun Bagan.

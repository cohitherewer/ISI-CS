 Leading India quite a task: Dravid

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai: The countdown to the World Cup for Team India began in right earnest at a high-profile kits-unveiling function here on Tuesday. As Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly posed in the new team jerseys designed by official apparel sponsor Nike, the audience was reminded that just over three weeks remain for our Cup hopefuls to launch their campaign in the Caribbean. 

Moments earlier, skipper Dravid flanked by senior statesmen Tendulkar and Sourav emerged stylishly from the backstage, sporting the light blue uniform. They were joined by Nike brand ambassadors Zaheer Khan and S. Sreesanth, along with Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Dinesh Karthik. 

It (the World Cup) is not something we have to be fearful about. Its the pinnacle of ones career as a one-day cricketer, said Dravid when quizzed by former India player Jatin Paranjpe. 

There has been so much of talk, so much of newsprint devoted to the World Cup its a relief for everyone that it is finally here. 

Asked how it feels going to the World Cup as India captain, Dravid smiled and said: Its a lot more headaches Sachin and Sourav will agree that it is quite a task. 

The two in question nodded in agreement.

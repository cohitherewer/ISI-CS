 Fan ready to sell kidney

Jamshedpur: Cricket fanatics do a lot to watch their favourite team in action, but selling ones kidney was unheard hitherto. 

Sarun Sharma of Mango in the Steel City has offered to sell one of his kidneys to raise funds for visiting the West Indies and watch the men in blue in action at the World Cup. 

I am really serious. I am prepared to give one of my kidneys in lieu of money as I want to go to West Indies to see India playing in the World Cup, the 23-year-old salesman at a readymade garment shop said on Thursday.

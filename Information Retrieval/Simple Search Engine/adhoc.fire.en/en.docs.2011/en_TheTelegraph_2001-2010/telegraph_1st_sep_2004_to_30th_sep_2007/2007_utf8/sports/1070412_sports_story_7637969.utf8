The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pro players for state leagues too

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The Pro League will replace the NFL from the 2007-08 season, the AIFF decided on Wednesday. The Pro League footballers will, however, be allowed to play their respective state leagues. 

IFA secretary Subrata Dutta scored a major victory at AIFFs executive committee meeting here, getting the national federation to agree to allow Mohun Bagan, East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting field their Pro League teams in the CFL as well. 

I made it clear to the federation bosses that we do welcome the Pro League, but not at the cost of our state league They listened to my reasoning, Dutta said. 

AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi informed that the Pro League will start with 10 NFL teams next season. It will take time to introduce the Professional League fully. It will take shape gradually over the next four years. 

The Pro League, it has been decided, will be held between October and February every season. No other state league will be allowed to be held during this period. The state leagues, therefore, will have to be organised either before or after the completion of the Pro League. 

For the first edition, the AIFF president said all clubs will have to register at least 14 contracted footballers. Five in each squad should be local players and at least two have to be from the under-19 age-group. At least four in all squads should have a two-year contract with their respective clubs. 

The AIFF has also made it mandatory for coaches of all Pro League teams to have an AFC B Licence certificate. Those who do not have this certificate will have to undergo a crash course. 

The AIFF also put to rest rumours that there would be no relegation from the ongoing NFL competition. It was made clear that the two promoted teams from second division Salgaocar and Viva Kerala will be part of the inaugural Pro League.

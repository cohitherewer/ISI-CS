 Akram fears for future of ODIs

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram fears that the Twenty20 format of cricket will badly affect the future of ODIs. 

I fear for the future of 50-over Internationals. Because people now dont have much time to watch cricket for a full day. In Twenty20 cricket they get to watch a lot of exciting cricket in three to four hours. It is an ideal format for them, he said on Monday. 

He, however, declined to pick any favourite for the ongoing ICC World Twenty20, saying it was difficult to make predictions in such a format. 

Akram also expressed his disappointment over Pakistans defeat to India on the bowlout rule. 

It was disappointing to see one of our bowlers could not hit the target although we played well on the field. It was sad to see our bowlers didnt take the bowlout seriously. 

Akram said captain Shoaib Malik should have led the way for his team in the bowlout and taken the first attempt. Whether we like it or not, but this is now part and parcel of Twenty20 cricket and we need to now master this rule. It is no use making lame excuses. 

Akram also lashed out at Malik for saying he was not aware that the match with India would be decided on a bowlout. If he says that then he does not deserve to be the captain of Pakistan. 

Akram also rubbished reports that he had undergone a rehabilitation programme in a London hospital for a drugs related problem. 

Akram said he had been under treatment in a hospital but it was for an acute sugar related problem and had nothing to do with drugs.

Tulsa: Tiger Woods tied a major championship record with a spectacular 63 in charging to a two-stroke lead over fellow-American Scott Verplank in the second round of the US PGA Championship on Friday. 

Woods came agonisingly close to setting the all-time low round in a major as his putt for birdie at the 18th hole spun out of the cup, leaving him to tap in for par. 

 Sergio Garcia was disqualified 

 on Saturday for signing an incorrect scorecard. The 27-year-old 

 Spaniard recorded a par four at the 358-yard 17th when in 

 fact he bogeyed the hole. 

I knew if I made that putt on the last hole, it would have been a nice little record to have, world No.1 Woods said. 

The remarkable round lifted Woods to six-under-par 134, two strokes better than Verplank, who shot a bogey-free 66. Australian Geoff Ogilvy (68) and Canadian Stephen Ames (69) were tied at 137. 

The 31-year-old American became the 21st player to shoot a 63 in one of the four major championships and the 10th to do so in a PGA Championship. 

Woods, who was six strokes off the pace after a one-over-par 71 in the opening round, scorched the Southern Hills layout late on another sweltering day with eight birdies and a lone bogey. 

Woods made three birdies in his first five holes before taking a bogey-five at the seventh where he had an awkward lie in a greenside bunker. 

From the ninth hole, he caught fire again, pouring in putts in a burst of scoring that saw him bag five birdies in an electrifying, seven-hole stretch. 

Before Woodss remarkable charge, local favourite Verplank grabbed the spotlight. The US Ryder Cup veteran showed his cool with four birdies in 100-degree heat. 

The lead was up for grabs early when overnight pacesetter Graeme Storm of Britain slumped to a six-over-par 76. 

John Daly, second overnight after an opening 67, bogeyed his first two holes and finished with 73 for even-par 140. 

Past form indicates Woods will be hard to catch. All seven times he has led at the half-way mark of a major he has won, and all six majors held at Southern Hills have been claimed by a player who led or shared the 36-hole lead. 

Seventy-two players made the cut, which was set at five over par. Among those missing the cut by one stroke were Vijai Singh, Davis Love and Jim Furyk. (REUTERS)

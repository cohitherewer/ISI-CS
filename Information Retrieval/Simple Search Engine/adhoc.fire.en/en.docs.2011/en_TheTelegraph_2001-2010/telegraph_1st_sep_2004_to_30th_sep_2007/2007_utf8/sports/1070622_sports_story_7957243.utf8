The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Almost feels like home

London: After her second round exit in the recently concluded French Open, Sania Mirza is banking on the support from non-resident Indians (NRI) for a better show at Wimbledon, which commences on Monday. 

The 46th ranked Indian said playing in London was like being at home for her. 

I think I get more support at Wimbledon because there are so many Indians out there. Moreover, I think during this season a lot of people are visiting England as well. Its great Almost feels like youre playing in India, Sania said. 

There are so many Indians in England My dads cousin is there and my mums sister. My best friend also lives in Lancaster, she was quoted as saying by BBC Sport. 

The third Grand Slam of the year is also played on Sanias favourite surface, grass, which facilitates her serve-and-volley game. 

The surface suits my game, said the 20-year-old, who is keen to get back to Wimbledon where she won the junior doubles title in 2003. 

Sania, who returned to action in Paris after playing just two tournaments following a long injury-induced lay-off, said she had to start from scratch in French Open. 

I was not playing tennis at all for two and a half months I started playing a week before I went to Paris. Its very hard, especially after you have surgery. If you just have an injury and you come back I think its a bit easier, but I literally had to start from scratch. 

My left leg had so much more power than my right leg. 

I probably thought I would take longer to start hitting the ball as well as I was when I stopped playing. Its been a hard process. 

Weve worked very hard in the gym the rehab started two days after the surgery with little exercises. Its been very, very hard.

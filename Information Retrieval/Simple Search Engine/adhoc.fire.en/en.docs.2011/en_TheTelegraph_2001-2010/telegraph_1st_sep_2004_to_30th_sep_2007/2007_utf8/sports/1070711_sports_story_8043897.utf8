 Bacher denies 

 involvement in fraud case

 CSA MONEY-LAUNDERING

 Ali Bacher 

 Durban: Former Cricket 

 South Africa (CSA) CEO Dr Ali Bacher has rejected claims 

 that he gave permission to a former financial manager to 

 transfer funds that had been defrauded from the board.

 Bacher was giving evidence in 

 a Johannesburg court during the trial of one Diteko Modise, 

 charged with defrauding the CSA of more than $1 million.

 Diteko had alleged that Dr Bacher 

 gave him permission through a fax document in March 2004.

 The fax stated that Dr Bacher 

 had given Modise permission to transfer $235,000 and $415,000 

 to the bank account of a so-called company within PPC Cement. 

 It was Modises private account.

 Modise was arrested in March 2004 

 after an investigation by the then UCBSAs auditors 

 into allegations of misappropriation of funds.

 The investigations were undertaken 

 after it was found that approximately $1 million had disappeared 

 from the organisations funds while it was Modises 

 job to handle all internal audits.

 Despite his position, Modise was 

 not entitled to spend any board money without necessary 

 authorisation.

 Dr Bacher said in his evidence 

 that the correspondence was forged. I never sent this 

 letter and never gave such permission, he said.

 He told the court that he did 

 not have the authority to approve any payments.

 Dr Bacher had not been associated 

 in any way with the CSA or Modise after he left the board 

 in 2004.

 The former CEO said he had only 

 recently learnt to use a computer and had become aware of 

 the alleged email correspondence when it was discovered 

 in the board office and faxed to him by the assistant of 

 Modises successor, Don James Macintosh.

 He had immediately telephoned 

 Niesha Green, his personal assistant who handled almost 

 all his documentation and correspondence on computer.

 After looking at it, Niesha had 

 declared that the document was forged, Dr Bacher 

 said.

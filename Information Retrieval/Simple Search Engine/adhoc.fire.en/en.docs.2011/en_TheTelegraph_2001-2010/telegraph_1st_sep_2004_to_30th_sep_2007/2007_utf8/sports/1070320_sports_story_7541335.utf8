 Woolmer was totally stressed out

Guest Column

Any top-level job involves huge pressure. But when it comes to a cricket-related job in the subcontinent, it assumes a different proportion. Bob Woolmers untimely death once again highlights the fact that the sky-high expectations here can be too heavy a burden. 

Cricket in the subcontinent is a synonym for religion. So much fan-following, so much media hype, so much pressures from every nook and corner lead to a situation where defeat is not acceptable under any circumstance, with the players and coach being kept subjected to constant pressure. 

In the subcontinent, life is more stressful for the coach than the players. The coach is the one who acts as a bridge between the players and Board officials. And while doing so, he has to keep ensure balance in such a way that neither the players nor the officials get angry with him. Yet, he is the first one to be put in the line of fire whenever adversity strikes the team. 

Such high expectations stem from the fact that India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have all been World Cup champions. So one can imagine how the Chappells and Woolmers have to live up to expectations. What happens during World Cup time is the media whips up the tempo, common people catch the fever and the pressure starts telling on the players. And the poor coach has to bear the brunt of all this. 

Administratively, the situation must have improved for a coach since the time I was in charge. When I was in the hot seat, I had to do more than the essential stuff like monitoring players form, organising practice sessions and planning for the games. I never had support stuff for my team. We had managers on overseas tours, but most of them were incompetent and even things like finalising travel plans and having clothing kits ready were left to me. 

I strongly believe a coach should be allowed to focus solely on cricketing matters, while administrators should look after the rest. This doesnt always happen in India. Just the other night, I was talking to Sir Richard Hadlee about what pressure an Indian coach has to work under. He expressed shock and said all this was alien to a New Zealander or an Australian. 

Like everybody, Bobs death has left me utterly shocked. Well miss his presence, his innovations and that profound knowledge of the game. He was extremely soft-spoken and always a nice person to talk to. I have some fond memories from the 1999 World Cup. I got the impression that he was too much involved with the game. 

Whenever I met him, cricket automatically came up for discussion. He was totally immersed in the game. 

However, I feel he was stressed out totally following a series of controversies in Pakistan cricket. Perhaps, the pressure and expectation of matching Pakistans 1992 feat proved too much for him. 

My advice to aspiring coaches would be to think twice before taking up the job. It may be exciting, lucrative as well. But living life with the passions of millions hardly borders on the normal. 

 A former opener, Aunshuman Gaekwad was Indias coach from late 1997 till the 1999 World Cup. Then, in late 2000, he returned to the job in a stand-in capacity after Kapil Devs resignation and before John Wright took over

 BCCI rubbishes Maynard claim

A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES

Calcutta/London: BCCI officials are not aware of Englishman Matthew Maynard having been approached to work at the National Cricket Academy (NCA). 

As far as I know, nobody has been contacted for any coaching assignment, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said on Tuesday. 

Even Ratnakar Shetty has no clue. I can tell you the Board hasnt approached anyone, said the BCCIs chief administrative officer. 

Maynard had been quoted in an agency report from London that he had got an offer to work at the NCA. Ive been asked to go to India and work with their academy Im sure there will be one or two more offers coming in, said Maynard. 

But Im just going to take my time, I dont want to rush, he added.

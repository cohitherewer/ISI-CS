 Advani, Shah 

bow out

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Indian challenge at the Asian Billiards Championship, in Doha, ended after Pankaj Advani and Rupesh Shah bowed out of the quarter finals. 

According to a media release, Comeback Man Peter Gilchrist defeated both the Indians on Wednesday. Initially, Gilchrist trounced Shah to lead the group in the last league match and then dashed the hopes of favourite Advani 4-3 in the quarter final tie. 

Advani was down 0-3 in the best of seven frame quarter final match. However he rallied brilliantly to take the issue to the decider before committing a blunder. Gilchrist took the advantage to clinch the match.

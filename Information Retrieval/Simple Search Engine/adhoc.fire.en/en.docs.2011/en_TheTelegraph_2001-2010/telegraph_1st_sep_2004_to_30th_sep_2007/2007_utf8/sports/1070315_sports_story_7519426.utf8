 Beckham bids goodbye to Old Trafford

Manchester: Manchester United turned David Beckham into an international superstar and he bid an emotional farewell to Old Trafford before heading for the US. 

Beckham joined United in 1991 at 16, debuted the next year, and transferred in 2003 to Real Madrid. In July, hes expected to start a five-year contract with the Los Angeles Galaxy in Major League Soccer. 

The time I spent at this club was the best time in my whole football career, Beckham told the 74,000-sellout crowd at halftime of a charity match won 4-3 by United over a Europe XI on Tuesday. 

Injury forced him to withdraw from a star-studded European side, which faced United to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the European Union and the Red Devils half century of play in continental soccer. 

Since he moved to Spain, the 31-year-old had returned to the stadium in Northwest England as England captain but hadnt been able to personally thank United for 14 trophy-filled years. 

Ive waited four years to actually come back and to actually say thank you to the fans and the people of the club, he said. (AP)

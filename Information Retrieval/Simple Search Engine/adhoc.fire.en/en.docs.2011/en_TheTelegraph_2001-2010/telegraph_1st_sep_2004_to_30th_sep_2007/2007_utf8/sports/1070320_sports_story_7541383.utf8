New Delhi: Leander Paes and his Czech partner Martin Damm captured their second ATP title of the season, beating sixth seeds Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram of Israel 6-4, 6-4 to claim the doubles crown at the Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, California. This was Paes 38th career doubles title and fourth with Damm. 

The fifth seeded Indo-Czech pair, which shocked top seeds Jonas Bjorkman and Max Mirnyi in the semi-finals, carried on their sublime form in the summit clash to win the $3.16 million event in their third final appearance of the season. 

Paes and Damm converted two of the six break points that came their way while saving all five they faced in the 1 hour 27 minutes match. 

The Indo-Czech pair had earlier won the Rotterdam title and reached the final in Doha. Since teaming up last year, they have a winning record of 4-2 in finals. 

Our partnership is 15 month-old and all the hard work we put in the beginning of last year is really coming together now, a triumphant Paes said after the victory. 

The results really take care of themselves but we are playing like a team thats been together for a few years. I am really enjoying the partnership. Its nice, Paes said. 

Meanwhile, second seed Rafael Nadal beat Novak Djokovic 6-2, 7-5 to win the singles title, his first title since last years French Open. 

The Spaniard held off a strong challenge from the Serb in the second set and finally subdued him with a series of punishing attacks from the baseline. 

Nadal came out firing and Djokovic was clearly nervous in his first Masters Series final, quickly losing the first four games. 

The 12th seed finally held to 4-1 but Nadal easily closed out the set, clinching it with a fierce top-spin service winner. 

But the 19-year-old Djokovic, who had not lost a set on his way to the final, dug in, causing Nadal problems with his big forehands, accurate serves and occasional rushes to the net. 

He nearly turned the match around in the fourth game, holding three break points, but Nadal came up with two service winners and Djokovic fluffed a drop shot on the third. . (Agencies)

 We are more confident about ODIs now: Kevin

One-day cricket used to be something England cricketers would prefer to leave off their CVs, but not any more. Two wins over India in three matches have persuaded even their harshest critics that they might finally be building a one-day team that can win series, rather than just the odd game. 

Even players used to tasting one-day defeat, such as Kevin Pietersen, feel change is afoot. In Birmingham to help npower launch plans for an urban cricket centre to be built next year, Pietersen fairly trumpeted Englands winning ways. 

In the nearly three years Ive played for England, there have not been many mornings when you wake up thinking we could win a one-day series and a big series, at that, Pietersen said Tuesday. But this morning I suddenly realised we could now be 3-0 up. In three games we have scored around 900 runs, and I havent played in an England team that has done that. 

Its not just the runs. Weve really competed against one of the best sides that includes some of the greats of the game. Tendulkar, Ganguly and Dravid theyve got 35,000 runs or so between them. To be competing against them, and knowing we could be 3-0 up, is an awesome feeling. 

Although prone to making statements as outrageous as his batting, Pietersen is a good judge when it comes to generalising about the team. He is certainly under no illusions. Since his one-day debut for England in 2004-05, despite averaging 52.7 with the bat he has been on the losing side 29 times. 

In fact, only 23 matches have been won in his time, 11 of those against Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, Canada, Ireland and Kenya. With so little return for his efforts, he probably means it when he says he would rather fail and England win. 

Im so pleased with the way the guys are playing, Pietersen added. Ive always said no matter how many runs I score, if England are winning thats when Im happiest and right now Im happy. The hundreds Ive scored in losing causes, so what? Personal performances dont really bother me, theyre good for stats. But everyone wants to be in a winning dressing room. Anyway, I feel fine. Ive scored quite a lot of runs this summer close to 1,000 in all competitions. 

Englands victories, both by large margins, have been founded on good totals and tenacious fielding. By contrast, Indias fielding has been poor enough to have had a major bearing on the results, so Paul Collingwoods side must not feel they have cracked one-day cricket just yet. 

Because Indias batting is so strong, and because their bowlers play such a huge part, we think we can beat them in the field, Pietersen said. Thats one area we can gain 20 to 40 runs over 50 overs. We are all committed to it, and diving round. Its great fun to get dirty and really fight hard. It makes victory all the sweeter. 

Yet Pietersen, once again among the nominees for the International Cricket Councils end-of-year awards (he is joined in the Test category by Monty Panesar and Ryan Sidebottom), believes that consistency is the prize that sets apart the best from the rest. 

What we have to get away from is saying how talented we are. Its one thing talking about potential, but we have to start fulfilling that potential.

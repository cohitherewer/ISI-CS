 Enjoying the conditions 

 - Getting Pietersen out icing on the cake, says RP 

 R.P. Singh 

London: Paceman Rudra Pratap Singh, who has dismissed Englands key batsman Kevin Pietersen three times on the trot, is on a high at the moment. 

The 21-year-old left-hander has been a revelation on this England tour. He bowled well consistently in the one-day series against South Africa in Belfast and continued the good work in England. 

He has consistently clocked more than 80mph, managed to swing the ball both ways and his disconcerting bounce has been the key to his tally of 10 wickets from the first two Tests. 

I am enjoying bowling in English conditions where the ball swings and seams a lot. Bowling left-arm round, the important thing has been to bowl a good line and length. I focused on accuracy and bowled well within myself, said RP. 

But getting rid of the dangerous Pietersen has been the high point. 

Getting Kevin Pietersen out in both innings (Trent Bridge Test) has been the icing on the cake. We all know that he is quite a dangerous player, one who thrives taking the attack apart. 

RP sent a special one to get the big man out in the second innings. The ball jabbed back a long way from way outside the off stump to rap on the pads of Pietersen who was preparing to leave it away. 

He (Pietersen) was the key wicket for me in both the innings and I am really happy to have dismissed him three successive times in the series. That has certainly added to my confidence just as getting a five-wicket haul at Lords did, RP said. 

For someone who bagged the MoM award in his debut Test on a bowlers graveyard in Faisalabad against Pakistan last year, RP is a very shy, unassuming pace bowler. And he is just too happy to be contributing to the teams cause. 

I have improved a lot since the time I made my debut. Playing in different countries, talking to different people always helps. But I am just taking one step at a time. For the moment, Im just too happy to be on the right track! 

He said the performance on the field depends on how well the team plans are executed. 

Theres a lot of planning involved and my job is to try and execute those plans to the best of my ability. Seniors like Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly have been helping in proper field placements and their constant inputs have been a treasure for me. 

I have just tried to do my part without getting carried away. I have to bowl tight and in the right areas. We have been successful in restricting English batsmen because, collectively, we have been successful in maintaining pressure on the opposition right through.

 Waiting to make a mark

 John Emburey 

J ohn Emburey (6 ft 2 inches) had a classical off-spinners action capable of getting a huge amount of bounce and away drift. Uncongenial pitches and one-day cricket, however, forced him to become primarily negative and defensive in his approach. He improvised more in his batting and managed to score runs. 

He led England in two Tests in 1988. Emburey was the only cricketer to go on both (1981-82 and 1989-90) Englands rebel tours to South Africa, and was forgiven both times. In 64 Tests between 1978 and 1995, he took 147 wickets and scored 1713 runs. In 61 ODIs, he took 76 wickets and scored 501 runs. 

He left Middlesex and was player-coach and then coach at Northants from 1996 to 1998 before being sacked with a year of his contract to run. In 2001 he signed to coach Berkshire, but on the eve of the season was appointed as Middlesexs third coach in as many seasons, taking over from old teammate Mike Gatting. 

In 2006 the county was relegated from the top flight in both the Championship and National League. In 2007, Middlesex brought in Richard Pybus as coach with Emburey taking over as director of cricket.

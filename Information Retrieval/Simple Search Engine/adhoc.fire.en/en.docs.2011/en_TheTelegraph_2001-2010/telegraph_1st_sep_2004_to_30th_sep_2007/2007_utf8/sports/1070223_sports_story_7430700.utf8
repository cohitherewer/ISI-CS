 Smith holds the key, says Kirsten

 - If conditions are slightly seamer-friendly, we wont be beaten: Wessels 

 Graeme Smith 

Durban: Captain and opening batsman Graeme Smith holds the key to South Africas batting at the World Cup next month, according to former opener Gary Kirsten. 

If he has a good series and leads from the top of the order, then South Africa are bound to do well, Kirsten said. When he and (opening partner) AB de Villiers play well together the sky is the limit. 

Kirsten said he believed Smiths double burden could be an asset if the runs flowed from his bat. 

They have one crucial match in the group stages, and thats the game against Australia, said another former South African batsman Kepler Wessels, who played for Australia before captaining his native South Africa said. 

Theyre going to have to try and peak in that match, and from there its a case of consistency, consistency, consistency. 

South Africans have suffered dramatic exits in most of their World Cup appearances, which started in 1992 after the end of the countrys isolation from international sport because of their apartheid (racial separation) policy. 

In 1992, I think we were dead unlucky, said Wessels, who captained South Africa in that tournament. In 96 South Africa were definitely the best team at the tournament, but they made tactical errors. The 99 thing was just a moment of madness. 

Wessels said he was confident that South Africa were a good bet to reach the final in Bridgetown, Barbados on April 28. I think we have a real chance this time, Wessels said. If conditions are even slightly seamer-friendly we wont be beaten. 

Meanwhile, Pollock supported Allan Donald for much of his career. Who did Donald think would be South Africas most important bowler in the tournament? 

You have to say Shaun Pollock, simply because of the way he bowls up front, former South Africa spearhead Donald said.

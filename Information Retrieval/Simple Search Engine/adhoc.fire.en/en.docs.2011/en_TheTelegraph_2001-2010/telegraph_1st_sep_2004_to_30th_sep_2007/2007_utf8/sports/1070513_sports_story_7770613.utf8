 Fifa awards full points to India

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: India, who are without a point in the Olympic qualifiers so far, have received three points by default as Fifa has pulled up Thailand for fielding an ineligible player in the Chennai outing on March 14. 

Thailand won the match 1-0 but Fifa has awarded three points to India. Thailand, however, have appealed against the decision. 

According to AIFF sources, Thailand fielded a player against India, who was already carrying two bookings against his name.

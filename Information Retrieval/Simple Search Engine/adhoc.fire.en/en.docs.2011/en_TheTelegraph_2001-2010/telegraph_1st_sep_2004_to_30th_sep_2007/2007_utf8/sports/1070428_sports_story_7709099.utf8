 McGrath wants Sanath scalp one last time

Melbourne: Glenn McGrath has singled out his prey in his contemporary Sanath Jayasuriya for the World Cup final against Sri Lanka on Saturday. 

McGrath, who has got Jayasuriyas scalp seven times, says he has enjoyed an upper hand against the left-hander in bouncy tracks something the Barbados pitch will have in plenty. 

In Australia I have always been reasonably successful against him, and I think the bounce has nicked him out quite a few times, McGrath said hoping to claim the Sri Lankan dynamo for the eighth and final time. 

McGrath has been a huge success in his swansong tournament and has emerged as the most successful bowler with 25 wickets, averaging 13.04. 

I have probably bowled a bit more aggressively and thats the reason why I have a few more wickets, McGrath told an Australian daily. 

McGrath also rated West Indian Brian Lara ahead of Indias Sachin Tendulkar among the batsmen he has bowled against in a 14-year international career. 

Probably Brian was slightly in front of Sachin when they were both at their peak. 

McGrath said the two outstanding bowlers of his era had been the fast bowlers Curtly Ambrose from West Indies and Pakistans Wasim Akram. 

McGrath, who will be playing his last match on Saturday, can move to second spot in the LG ICC ODI rankings if he helps the Aussies win a third successive World Cup. 

McGrath is up two places to third in the latest rankings and is now just six ratings points behind teammate Nathan Bracken. Shaun Pollock of South Africa occupies the top spot.

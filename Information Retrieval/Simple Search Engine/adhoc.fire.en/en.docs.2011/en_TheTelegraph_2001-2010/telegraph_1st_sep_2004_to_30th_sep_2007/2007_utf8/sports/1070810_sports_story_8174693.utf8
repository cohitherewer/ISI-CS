 Vijays advice for Sania

Bangalore: Indian tennis legend Vijay Amritraj said Sania Mirza should focus more on winning major tournaments than thinking about her ranking. I have never paid too much attention to ranking, he said. 

Amritraj felt 1that last year Sanias performance could have been affected a bit because of expectations from fans. People dont expect you to win at 18. But when you are 19, all of a sudden people expect. She came back strongly in the third year because expectation levels are a little bit less, he said. 

Amritraj said that Sania should also play doubles and take care of herself and ensure that she did not pick up injuries. Doubles is what has given her ability to play well in singles as well. Even if you lose some times in first-round singles, then you win the doubles...It gives you a great amount of confidence and match play. So, you end up being better in singles along the way.

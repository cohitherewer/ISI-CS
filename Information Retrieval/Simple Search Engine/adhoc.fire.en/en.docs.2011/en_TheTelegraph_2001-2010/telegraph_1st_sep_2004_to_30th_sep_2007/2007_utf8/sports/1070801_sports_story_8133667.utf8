 PCB warns Inzamam

Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf on Tuesday issued a clear warning to former captain Inzamam-ul Haq, saying he will not be considered for selection if he decides to play for the breakaway Indian Cricket League. 

Since the International Cricket Council (ICC) does not recognise this private tournament, our position is clear any Pakistani player who plays in the league will not be considered for national selection again, Ashraf said. 

We will not give permission to any of our players to play in the ICL as it is not supported by the officialdom, he said. 

Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif said from London that he had also been spoken to by the ICL organisers, but will not go to India unless he got PCB clearance. It is all too premature, but I would like to get clearance from the PCB to play in the ICL, he added. 

Meanwhile, the PCB has started conducting dope tests on the probables for the Twenty20 World Cup, including fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif who had last year tested positive for a banned substance. (PTI)

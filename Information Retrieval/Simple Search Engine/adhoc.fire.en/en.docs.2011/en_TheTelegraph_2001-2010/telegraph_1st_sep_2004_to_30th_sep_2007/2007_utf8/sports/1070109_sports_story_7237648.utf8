The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Moon puts all in shade 

 STAR RACER

 Daniel with Moon Forest

 Moon Forests drubbing of the Oaks winner, Amorina, on Sunday, in the 2,400m Eveready Calcutta Derby Stakes, was hard to digest for those who doubted his staying power. The gruelling Derby trip was considered to be a bit taxing for the Razeen-Regal son whos 2000 Guineas victory was far from a facile one.

 The Daniel David-trainee proved his critics wrong winning the prized event by five lengths. The victory for Moon Forest also came under pressing conditions. Jockey Colm Donoghue was a bit upset after the stewards ordered an enquiry into the running and riding of a hot-favourite, Star Perfection, in the days opener, the 1,600m Psychic Flame Cup. The 1000 Guineas winner, it was observed, was given a fairly hard ride, yet the stewards thought otherwise and handed the Irishman a two-day suspension after the last race.

 Harvinder Singh Baths vastly improved horse, Tactical Advantage, won the race from Daniels less-fancied ward Star Phoenix who, despite his Herculean handicap tried to win from the start. The Advantage was always in chase of the leader and cashed in on jockey K.P. Appus power-packed riding.

 Daniels stable also suffered from the weak handling of his two heavily fancied runners, Dancing Storm and Rainbow Emperor, in their respective events, the 1,600m Maltese Prince Cup and the 1,400m Voluntary Cup.

 Both horses were in striking position till the final turn but their jockeys, Cp Manasseh and apprentice Amandeep Singh squandered their chances. Vikash Jaiswals El Cid and Richard Alford Arrayal were the beneficiary in the two races.

 Trainer Javed Khans Ardella, once again, had the measure of a heavily wagered Errol Bhungard-trainee, Imperial Stride, in the Bahrain Trophy. The big difference at the weight and jockey C.Rajendras strong riding helped Ardella win.

 Khan and Bhungard were also the main players in the 1,200m Goodfellas Cup and the Brave Dancer Cup. Bhungards Cupids Glory and Ecstatic Pride, both ridden by Imran Chisty, emerged victorious over Khans heavily supported duo of Priceless Hero and Aluminous. Both were very close contests but Chisty being in his elements on the Derby day, managed to snatch verdicts in each case.

 With Daniels Canterbury Rocks withdrawn at the starting gates, the stage was set for Vijay Singhs Athymia to post a back-to-back victory in the babies Classic event, the 1,400m Alokananda Stakes an all fillies affair. The Major Impact-Dolka daughter hit the front soon after the start of the race and jockey Rajendra literally toyed with the Md Islam-ridden Elemental Wish, a Robin Corner trained horse.

 Graham Polls advice to Styles

TIMES ONLINE AMP; AGENCIES

Former referee Graham Poll believes Rob Styles should not officiate any games next week after his big mistake in awarding Chelsea a crucial penalty against Liverpool. Styles has been heavily criticised for his decision to penalise Steve Finnan as the full-back appeared to make no contact with Florent Malouda in the 1-1 draw at Anfield on Sunday. 

Poll, who retired at the end of last season, has advised Styles to take next weekend off. What he will do, I would venture to suggest, is probably have a weekend off next week, he said. If that was me, Id certainly be happy to have a weekend off, lick my wounds, regain my strength and confidence and come back. 

However Jeff Winter, another former referee, believes the Premier League cannot afford to let Styles sit out this weekends fixtures. The problem is at Premier League level, we saw referees retire at the end of last season, Winter said. They havent exactly got the numbers. 

On the penalty incident, Poll said: It was a big mistake. One thing a referee knows is that he will make a mistake in a match. What they are hoping is its not crucial to the outcome of the match. Unfortunately for Rob Styles, that mistake with the penalty was crucial to the match. Who knows? It could be crucial to the season. 

Winter added: You cant defend the decision. It clearly wasnt a penalty and did change the outcome of the game.

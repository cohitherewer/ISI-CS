 How a boy fulfilled an island of dreams

Owen Slot

Alberto Jo Jardim was re-elected as president of Madeira 12 days ago and one of his first decisions was to have Cristiano Ronaldos former house knocked down. Three days into his new term of office, a digger duly arrived and flattened it. Maybe they will build a statue there, Hugo, Ronaldos elder brother, said, sarcasm ringing in his voice. But it just so happens that the razing of Ronaldos house is a compliment, albeit a peculiar one. 

You do not have to look far for such compliments on this lush Atlantic island. The favourite son clich he fulfils to the letter, though the competition is not exactly tough. 

No one here can recall another person to have stepped from its sleepy shores into world reknown. Someone mentioned a poet but could not recall the name. And the football die-hards also recall Chino Termura, Petita and Nelson Ferreira, players of a bygone generation who made the leap to the mainland but landed in the drinking establishments and left their reputations there. 

So feelings for Ronaldo here are as warm as the sun. But beyond natural local pride, you could hardly find a more genuine compliment than that being paid just 30 metres down the road from the rubble of his home, in Bar Falc, an unlovely, everyday, working-class bar run by Miguel Andrade, who has known Ronaldo since they were boys. 

We all grew up with a dream and Cristiano is making it come true, he said. The day his friend signed for Manchester United, Andrade told him he wanted to be there when he won the Premiership and at the start of last week two tickets duly arrived for the match against West Ham United. 

Andrade went with Hugo and Dolores, Ronaldos mother, and had his picture taken with Wayne Rooney, Alan Smith and celebrity Justin Timberlake. He always comes back here, Andrade said. Once Saturdays FA Cup final is over, Ronaldo will be back here playing pool with them again. 

When Ronaldo comes back, Jardim invariably indulges in a photo opportunity. On an island where there is little news, Ronaldo is a massive headline and that is why his old house had to go. 

About his education Ronaldos sister Elma says: He was always in the street playing football. The whole family told him to pay attention to his school-work, but hed just stay in the street with his ball. The only year that he did fail was when he was 11, when he moved to the mainland, to Sporting Lisbon. 

As for the popular depiction of an upbringing in Third World poverty, that is an exaggeration. Their father was a gardener, their mother a cook. 

We worked for a living like everyone did, Elma said. Cristiano didnt have Nike shoes, but its not as if he was playing football in bare feet. 

He was 6 when I got my first job, making aluminium window frames, Hugo said. And when Elma started working, too, we did get a better, more stable life. When I got home from work it was 9.30pm and hed still be there kicking the ball against the wall. 

From his local team, he joined the academy of Nacional, the Madeira club, and neither can recall him enduring a single defeat without crying. When they were losing, hed be playing and crying at the same time, Pedro Talhinhas, his coach at Nacional, said. 

Goncalo Filipe, his former teammate, said: I certainly remember the crying.It makes me so proud to know I played with him. 

These days, Filipe plays third division football and works in a drinks-bottling plant. 

What was special about Ronaldo? Talhinhas said: For someone from this small island to leave home for Sporting Lisbon so young was a very big step. 

He mentions another boy, Steve Andrade, who was at Nacionals big rivals, Martimo, the same age as Ronaldo and rated his equal. He will turn out for Madeiras third division side, Uni. And the hearts and television sets of Madeira will be far away with Ronaldo at Wembley.

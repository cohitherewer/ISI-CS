A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Squash player Saurav Ghosal is currently enjoying the peak of his form, thanks to the experience gathered in England. 

Fresh from bagging his second Professional Squash Association (PSA) Tour title ICL-Chennai Squash Open the reigning national champion Saurav is back home before he sets off for another tour event in Cairo from July 9. 

Saurav, currently world ranked 42, is eyeing to get into the 30s. The way Im playing just now, its realistic to get around mid-30s. Ive few PSA tour events coming up the first being the Rotary Heliopolis in Cairo. Its a tough challenge as Im pitted against a higher-ranked opponent in Round I. If I do well, Ill definitely get some points to improve my ranking, the 20-year-old said. 

For the record, Sauravs highest ever world ranking was 40 but that was in April, he added. As for India, Ritwik Bhattacharya had achieved the highest ranking ever 38 last year.

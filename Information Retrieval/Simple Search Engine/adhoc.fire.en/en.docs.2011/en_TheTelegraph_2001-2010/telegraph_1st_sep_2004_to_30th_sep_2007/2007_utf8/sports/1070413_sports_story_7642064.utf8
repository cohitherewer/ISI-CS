 Jittery Englands lack of belief came to the fore

What the cricket gods give to England with one hand they seem to take away with the other and after routing Bangladesh on a spicy pitch for 143, the bowlers deserved to sit back and reflect on a job well done. But so jittery is the teams batting that even a small total like this one presented problems before the game was won by four wickets (as reported in Thursdays Late City edition). 

The bottomline is that England beat their first Test-playing nation of this World Cup. Their Super Eight points total now stands at four, two behind South Africa, their opponents here next Tuesday. Win that and a semi-final place remains within sight, though that seems a ludicrous notion after a faltering performance here. 

Looking at the results in this World Cup, the most obvious way to get into trouble against one of the unfancied teams, is for them to bat first, score 200-plus and then lose your nerve in the chase. Michael Vaughan won the toss and took that risk, though after Bangladesh collapsed, even the greatest England sceptic will have thought it a foregone conclusion. But such is Englands lack of belief when Kevin Pietersen fails that they were soon in trouble. 

Given Bangladeshs bowlers lacked the firepower of Englands pacers earlier in the day, it must have been nerves. But just as they threatened to consume them, a timely injection of runs from Andrew Flintoff, as he attacked the left-arm spin of Mohammed Rafique, and the steadying hand of Paul Collingwood, saw the chase through. 

Coming in with the score on 79 for four in the 23rd over, Flintoff has not been in any sort of form with the bat, so he used his failsafe method brute strength. A hack over mid-wicket for four was followed by a backfoot punch through the covers for another. A huge six onto the roof of the pavilion followed, though Rafique soon bowled him with a quicker ball. 

 With 34 wanted, England seemed nailed on winners though when Ravi Bopara played on to Rafique, for a duck, the palpitations resurfaced until Collingwood and Paul Nixon saw them home. 

The relief was palpable. England had most of the luck going, including several second bites at two dismissals. Yet they would have been hard pushed had Bangladesh showed more application with the bat and seen off the danger men before turning their blazing bats on the other bowlers. To be 65 for six in the 16th over is not sage match management, even in conditions as alien as these. 

It was the fourth successive toss Vaughan had won. But if the other three conferred no obvious advantage (England lost two of the games), this one was like winning the lottery. If conditions stay the same, next Tuesdays match against South Africa promises to be a fast bowling tour de force in a game England cannot afford to lose despite a better net run-rate. 

Coming from the slow grippers in Guyana, where they beat South Africa, Bangladeshs batsman must have wondered if theyd stepped into a parallel universe running at twice the speed. 

The lack of precedents was obvious as they struggled to cope with 85-90mph balls around chest height. Only Saqibul, with his fast eye and even faster hands, batted without discomfort. His unbeaten 57, made off 95 balls with six fours and a six, was a fine effort. 

There were no clues of the calamity to come from the first over, bowled by James Anderson, in which the left-handed Tamim Iqbal twice drove for four. But Sajid Mahmood, was soon at his menacing best to dismiss the openers in quick succession. 

Habibul Bashar was then run out in what can only be described as comedy of errors from both sides. The first mistake came from Shahriar Nafees, who spooned a simple catch to Vaughan at mid-on, who promptly committed the next howler by dropping it. 

Unfortunately for Bangladesh, Habibul had too much faith in his opposite number. Sauntering down the pitch with his back to Vaughan, he pulled up in disgust. Mindful of the mix-up, Nixon alerted his captain whose throw found a confused Habibul well short of the crease. 

Nafees went soon after to another tarnished dismissal, Nixons fluffed attempt to take the edge rebounding to Andrew Strauss. Anderson then had Mohammed Ashraful and Aftab Ahmed dismissed after both edged out-swingers to Nixon. 

There is little way back from 65 for six other than to eke as many runs as you can. Mashrafe Mortaza tried, staying with Saqibul for 14 overs in a stand worth 47 runs. But like the other tailenders in his team, he got above his station when the spinner came on. Three ungainly heaves later and Panesar had three wickets. Who said it was a fast bowlers pitch!

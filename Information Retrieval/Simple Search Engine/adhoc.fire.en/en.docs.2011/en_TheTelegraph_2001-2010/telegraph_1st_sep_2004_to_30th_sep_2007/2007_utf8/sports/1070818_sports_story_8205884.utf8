 Chisty is the one to follow 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Horseracing returns to Saturdays and the routine Wednesday slot marked for city racing is going to be a thing of the past at least for the next six weeks. RCTC has been all concerned about putting the sports on the right track to woo back patrons who have been losing interest in local affairs since the mid-week racing was introduced.

 For the starter, there are eight events in Saturdays card which also includes three sweepstakes races. The main attraction, however, is going to be the prestigious Independence Cup, over 1,400 metres. 

 There are seven horses running for the trophy but the one who gets the first call is the Daniel David-trained Brilliant Victory who is yet to taste defeat in his two career starts. 

 The Swatantrata Cup, also over an identical trip, may see a close contest but Daniels Imperial Stride appears to have the edge over Adderly, Paladin and Flemenco Star. Both Brilliant Victory and Imperial Stride will be partnered by the visiting jockey Imran Chisty.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

 BCCI blames DD for Test blackout

Ahmedabad: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Monday squarely blamed public broadcaster Doordarshan for denying millions of Indian fans the chance of watching the ongoing Test series between India and Bangladesh. 

Doordarshan is to be blamed for this. They should have prepared an understanding with the broadcaster Neo Sports for the Test series also, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said. 

The BCCI cannot do anything in this. It is something that the broadcaster and Doordarshan should look into. 

Doordarshan is showing another one-day series being played (Sri Lanka and Pakistan), why cannot they show the Indian teams series, questioned Shah. (PTI)

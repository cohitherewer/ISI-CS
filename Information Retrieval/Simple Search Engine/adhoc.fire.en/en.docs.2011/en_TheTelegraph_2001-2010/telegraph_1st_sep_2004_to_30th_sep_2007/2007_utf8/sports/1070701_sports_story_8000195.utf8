The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Kalmadi pitches for rowing 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Rowing can become the national sport following hockeys demotion from priority to general category. So feels Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president Suresh Kalmadi. 

Im happy to see so many youngsters taking to this sport... Im sure rowing can become our national sport, Kalmadi said on Saturday on the sidelines of the Indian Oil Servo National School Regatta meet. 

Kalmadi urged more sponsors to back Olympic disciplines, like rowing. He added that the Indians focus should be on the Commonwealth Youth Games, to be held in Pune in October 2008. That, he felt, would be the perfect build-up for the 2010 New Delhi Commonwealth Games. Kalmadi gave away the prizes at the regatta meet, which ended at the Lake Club on Monday. 

City schools won two of the four events South Point A topping the junior boys category beating St Joseph amp; Marys B and Gokhale Memorial Girls School overcoming Army Public School to clinch the senior girls crown. 

The junior girls final was an all-Orissa affair in which Jagatpur A beat their B team. The Nasik-based LVH Mahavidyalaya won the senior boys title beating Tirthapati A.

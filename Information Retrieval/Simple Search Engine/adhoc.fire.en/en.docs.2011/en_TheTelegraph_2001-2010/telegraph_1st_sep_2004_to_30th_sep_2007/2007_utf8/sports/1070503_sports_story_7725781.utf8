 Reina wins the day for Liverpool

 - Chelsea come up short after Agger strike takes semi-final to penalty shootout

Be careful what you wish for: Jose Mourinho had been moaning about never receiving penalties and his Chelsea team were put painfully on the spot at a crowing Anfield on Tuesday night. Arjen Robben and Geremi both missed in the shoot-out, denied by the brilliance of Pepe Reina, and Liverpool were off, laughing and dancing, singing and shouting, to Athens for the May 23 final of the European Cup. 

In ancient Greece, well win it six times, chorused the Kop, before reminding Mourinho that talk is cheap, European trophies are real riches. Some Teams Make Headlines Others Make History, read one banner. And the real special ones make really special saves. 

Chelseas spirit subsided, like a rapidly deflating balloon, crushed by the reflexes of Reina. The Spaniard was a feared stopper of penalties during his time at Villarreal, and most famously in last seasons FA Cup final, where he broke West Hams hearts. 

Yet Chelsea had Petr Cech in goal, and respected penalty-takers throughout their line-up. Maybe this was where Liverpools 12th man, the fans, came into play; even though the shoot-out was down the Anfield Road End, close to the away support, the noise was still deafening. 

Bolo Zenden tucked away Liverpools first against his old club, and then Reina saved magnificently from Robben. When Xabi Alonso drilled home Liverpools second, the force was really with Rafa Benitezs side. 

Up stepped Frank Lampard to restore Chelseas hope, slamming his kick past Reina. From one England midfielder to another, Steve Gerrard calmly guiding his to Cechs left. With whistles of derision ringing in Geremis ears, Chelseas next taker badly fluffed, again denied by the agile Reina. 

How fitting that Dirk Kuyt should apply the coup de grace, having embodied Liverpools endeavour throughout 120 minutes, and even been thwarted by the bar and an errant linesmans flag. 

Kuyt triggered amazing scenes, all the Liverpool players hugging each other, except for Carragher, who set a new speed record in racing towards the Kop, a smile the width of the Mersey creasing his face. As Kuyts ball nestled in the back of Cechs net, a guttural roar ripped through Anfield. 

Liverpool, celebrating their 10th successful shoot-out out of 11 in their history, deserved victory. Chelsea, so full of talent, were disappointing. Didier Drogba was isolated in attack, and rarely looked like troubling Carragher or Daniel Agger, whose fine goal after 21 minutes had forced extra time. 

Liverpool tore into Chelsea, even Zenden sliding in hard on Salomon Kalou. After the anaemic first meeting, this was far more full-blooded affair. Rugby great Martin Johnson looked on, marvelling at the commitment and high-speed collisions of Gerrard and John Terry, Carragher and Drogba. 

Benitezs side lacked for nothing in determination, as John Obi Mikel discovered when a rash decision to dawdle in possession was ended by an express train from Huyton called Gerrard. Liverpools captain was everywhere, soon winning a slightly soft free-kick when Joe Cole mistimed a challenge. 

Seeing the tackle coming in, Gerrard played for the dead-ball, which proved richly rewarding. Everyone expected a free-kick to the far post, looking for the towering Peter Crouch. Chelsea were certainly caught out as Gerrard rolled the ball to the edge of the area. Here was a goal made in Melwood. Kuyt leant into Salomon Kalou, and Agger had clear water. 

Timing his run perfectly, meeting the ball sweetly, Agger sent it racing left-footed past Cech. Level on aggregate, Carragher and his footballing family had to beware the away goal. When Drogba stole a yard on Agger just after the half-hour, the Kop feared the worst. 

But Reina stood firm, and blocked Drogbas hard shot. Relief rolled down from the terraces. Having given everything in normal time, Liverpool needed the 12th man of their support, and the inspiring rhetoric of Benitez, who walked amongst them, coaxing and cajoling, as they awaited the additional call to arms. And again before the shoot-out. Benitezs words, and Reinas safe hands, guided Liverpool to Athens.

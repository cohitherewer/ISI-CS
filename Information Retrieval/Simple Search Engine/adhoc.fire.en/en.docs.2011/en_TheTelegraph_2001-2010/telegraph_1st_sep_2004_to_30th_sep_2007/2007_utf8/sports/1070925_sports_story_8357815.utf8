 Twenty20 future bright: Gilchrist

Melbourne: Bowled over by its pace and entertainment value, Adam Gilchrist says Twenty20 will play a big role in world cricket after the success of the ongoing ICC World Twenty20 meet in South Africa. 

Overall, we have enjoyed it and realise that its going to play a big part in world cricket, said Gilchrist. 

The wicketkeeper-batsman was of the view that this format of cricket would contribute a lot to the game. 

I think its very much a positive for the game. Ive been wrestling back and forward with it. Just on face value, I do think its going to add a lot to the game. I do think its going to improve one-day cricket, he said. 

Gilchrist felt the slam-bang approach of Twenty20 would also help in promotion of the game. 

Its going to create more interest in the game now. I think its a great product Its going to make everything a little bit more intriguing as to what goes on, he said.

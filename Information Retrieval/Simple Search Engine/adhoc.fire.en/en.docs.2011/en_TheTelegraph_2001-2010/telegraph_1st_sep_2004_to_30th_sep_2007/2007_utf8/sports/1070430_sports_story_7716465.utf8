Beijing: Gaurav Ghei became the first Indian to win a golf title on any international tour in 2007 when he won the inaugural Pine Valley Beijing Open with a flawless three-under 69 on the final day of the event. 

The 38-year-old Delhi golfer, who was tied with three others for the overnight lead, totalled 14-under 274 to win by two shots over Australian Adam Blyth (71) and bag his third Asian Tour title. 

Ghei had three birdies and no dropped shots in his final round. He had 11 years between his first two titles but had to wait only for eight more months for his third title. 

It is an amazing feeling to be able to win again. I have been consistent but was not able to put it together earlier this year, said Ghei, whose previous best this year had been a tied sixth place finish at the Johnnie Walker Classic. 

I had a gameplan of playing to my strengths and thats what I did today. I told myself to go out and play one hole at a time. I hit the ball well and made it easy. I didnt make bogeys, so it was just a solid round of golf. Im extremely happy, said Ghei. 

Gheis win earned him $79,250. It also took him to seventh place on the Asian Tours UBS order of merit with total earnings of $189,164. 

Last year was a great win as it ended an 11-year drought. But I wanted to win another tournament to prove to myself that my win last year was no fluke and to do it here in such a short span of time is very satisfying indeed. I put in a lot of hard work and it feels great to win again, added Ghei who had previously won the 1995 Gadgil Western Masters and the 2006 Mercuries Masters. 

After Blyth in second, Thai pair of Chapchai Nirat (68) and Thaworn Wiratchant (70) were tied third at 11-under 277. 

Another Indian SSP Chowrasia also made an improvement on the final day. 

Chowrasia, who was disqualified while leading at the Mercuries Masters, shot a three-under 69 to moved from overnight 50th to 29th with a total of three-under 285. Amandeep Johl shot a two-under 70 and moved to two-under 286 and went from tied 50th to tied 35th place. 

Ghei was never behind in the final round after taking the lead with two birdies on the front nine. 

He birdied the fifth for the third day in row and then the eighth for the fourth successive day before adding another on 13th. He parred the rest to seal the victory. The win also ensured his berth in the $ 5 million HSBC Champions tournament in Shanghai in November. 

I would like to dedicate this win to Mr N. Srinivasan of India Cements. Theyve been with me for 13 years and its been very tough as they were with me even when I was not playing well. So I would like to say thanks to him who has been like a rock behind me, added the champion. (PTI)

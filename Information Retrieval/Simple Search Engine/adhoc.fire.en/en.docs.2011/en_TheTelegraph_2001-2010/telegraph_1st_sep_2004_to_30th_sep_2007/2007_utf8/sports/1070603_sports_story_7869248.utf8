The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 EB make it to Manchester

New Delhi: East Bengal lost to Assumption College, Thailand, 0-1 in the final of the Southeast Asian regional leg of the Manchester United Premier Cup on Saturday. 

However, the Calcutta team will make the tournament proper in Manchester as both finalists have been given a berth in the world finals. 

The Thai side got the winner in the second-half at the Singapore Sports School ground. 

The tournament sees U-15 club sides from all over the world compete with top sides from Europe and South America. 

East Bengal, who had beaten Mahindra United to qualify in the South-Asian leg, had started the tournament on the wrong foot, going down 0-2 to Singapore Sports School. But they rebounded to beat Hong Kong U-15 by a solitary goal.

 Miandad warms up to Lawson call

 Javed Miandad 

Melbourne: The former Pakistan captain Javed Miandad softened his stance, saying he has no ego hassle in working with Australian Geoff Lawson, who has invited him (Miandad) to be a part of coaching crew. 

I would like to get Javed on board to be part of the coaching crew, to be part of the system and help out, because he was an outstanding player and a tough bloke as well. We could do with a few of those characteristics, Lawson said. 

Lawson, however, feels that the former Test great had much to offer to Pakistan cricket. 

Im hoping to talk to all those people and see what contributions they can make. We cant control outside influences but it would be good if we could have some of those outside influences being positive, Lawson was quoted as saying in an Australian daily. 

Miandad had criticised the selection of Lawson as coach, saying foreign coaches are a waste of money and they cannot have the same feeling of patriotism as a Pakistani. 

My top priority has always been Pakistan cricket and if Lawson wants my advice or help and if ever he wants me to work with him I have no ego problems doing that, he said. 

Miandad, who played against Lawson in eight Tests between 1982 and 84, had earlier said I am not keen for a job but our own players can do a better job than foreigners. 

We could do with a few of those characteristics among the guys at the moment. 

Miandad said Lawsons positive remarks about him and other players was an apt reply to the way the board had treated its own people during the selection process for a new coach. 

What Lawson has said it shows that our board also needs to learn to respect its former players and not treat them as second grade citizens, he said.

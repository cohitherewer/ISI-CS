 India hold Iraq to 1-1 draw 

Chennai: A spirited and much improved display

 by India helped them force a 1-1 draw with Asian Games finalists Iraq in their

 last home match of the Olympic qualifiers here Wednesday night. 

India, according to current Fifa rankings, are placed 165th, while Iraq are on 79th spot. 

The entire first half was evenly balanced. The Indian defenders didnt wilt under pressure and even lent a helping hand to the midfielders. The defence did such a good job that the Iraqis did not have a single scoring opportunity. 

The Iraqis changed their strategy in the second half and played more aerial balls to split the Indian defence. The visitors took the lead courtesy a setpiece in the 54th minute. Kerrar J. Muhammed headed home a flag-kick from the right. 

Despite falling behind, the Indian defence held firm. The men up front tried their best for an equaliser which materialised in the 73rd minute. 

A fine forward pass by Syed Rahim Nabi saw the Iraqis turn towards the linesman, thinking that he would wave the off-side flag. The unmarked Tarif Ahmed comfortably slotted the ball in. 

The Indians now have four points from five matches, thanks to Fifas decision to grant them victory in a game they lost to Thailand as the latter had fielded an ineligible player. (PTI)

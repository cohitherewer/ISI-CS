The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Yousuf wont say no to captaincy

Karachi: Mohammed Yousuf said on Wednesday that he would gladly accept the offer of leading Pakistan. 

Yousuf said for him captaining the country had always been the ultimate honour. If they offer it to me I will not refuse, he told a TV channel. 

Inzamam announced he was stepping down as captain after Pakistans early elimination from the World Cup and also retired from ODIs. 

Although Younis Khan is seen as an automatic choice to replace Inzamam, a section within the PCB feels that Yousuf would be a better choice as he is now the senior-most player and very calm and composed. 

Yousuf said no one could comprehend how much the death of coach Bob Woolmer had affected the team. He was so close to us and a very good coach. His death has shocked us all, he said. 

Yousuf said he could understand the disappointment of the nation at the teams performance but said no team likes to lose. 

It was just that we could not perform on the given days. The defeat to Ireland was simply heartbreaking, he said. 

Yousuf, who coverted to Islam in 2005, said he remained clear about his convictions. The discipline and focus Islam has instilled in me has filtered into my batting. 

Yousuf also credited Woolmer for improving his balance at the crease. 

Meanwhile, Wasim Akram said the PCB should not have difficulty in choosing either Younis or Yousuf. 

But whoever becomes the captain, I would advise him strictly to always consult the senior players in the team and former players. He can take his own decision but there is nothing wrong in seeking a different opinion, he said, an obvious reference to allegations against Inzamam that he had become too autocratic and stubborn. 

Akram also suggested the names of Aaqib Javed and Waqar Younis as coach saying they had the required experience. I think the PCB could appoint a foreign coach in a secondary role... A foreigner is always above politics and can bring good balance to the team. (PTI)

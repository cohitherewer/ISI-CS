The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India eyeing knockout berth

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Indians will look to finish group A toppers ahead of Australia and make the knockout stage in the second Commonwealth Volleyball Championships to begin at the Netaji Indoor Stadium on Sunday. 

We want to beat Australia and top the group which also has Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nigeria, coach G.E. Sridharan said Friday. 

For the Volleyball Federation of India (VFI) secretary K. Murugan, Indias performance is the key to get back the status of priority sport. Volleyball, it maybe recalled, was demoted from its priority status. 

We want to regain the priority status by performing well, Murugan said. 

Ten teams divided into two groups will vie for the top honours. 

India are ranked 27th in the world while Canada and Australia are placed 12th and 23rd respectively. Indians finished third in the first edition held in London in 1981.

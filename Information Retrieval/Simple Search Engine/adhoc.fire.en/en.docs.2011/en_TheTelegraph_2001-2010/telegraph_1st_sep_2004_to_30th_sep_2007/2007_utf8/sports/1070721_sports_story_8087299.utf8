 PCB compensates Asif, Gul

Karachi: The PCB has compensated Mohammed Asif and Umar Gul for not signing contracts with County sides this season. 

The PCB had asked the two pacers not to play the County circuit this season because of their fitness problems. 

Asif has struggled with an elbow injury since early this year, while Gul was called back from South Africa because of a knee injury. 

The two have been included in category A of the central contracts. They have also been compensated otherwise, said a PCB official. 

According to a report, the duo has been paid about Rs 9 million rupees for not playing the County circuit. 

Our policy is clear: we want to nurse our young pacers so that they remain free of fitness problems and are available for the national team during important assignments. Weve had too many fitness problems in the past, said Zakir Khan, director, cricket operations. 

He added that the new central contracts make it mandatory for the players to get clearance from the PCB before signing overseas contracts. 

We now have a system in place under which every player is being accessed in the training camps by qualified instructors and doctors. The players are then given ratings for their fitness and points in the central contracts. (PTI)

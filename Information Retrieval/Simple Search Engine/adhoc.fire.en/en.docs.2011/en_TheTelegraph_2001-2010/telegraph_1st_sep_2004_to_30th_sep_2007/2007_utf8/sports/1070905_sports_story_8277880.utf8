 Perera comes in for Murali

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Dilruwan Perera will replace injured Sri Lanka off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan in the ICC World Twenty squad, the ICC confirmed in a press release on Tuesday. 

According to information received here, the Technical Committee has approved Perera as a replacement for the tournament, which runs from September 11 to 24 in South Africa. 

Perera replaces the talismanic off-spinner after medical reports indicated Muralidharan had sustained an injury to his right distal bicep and would not be fit in time to take part in the event.

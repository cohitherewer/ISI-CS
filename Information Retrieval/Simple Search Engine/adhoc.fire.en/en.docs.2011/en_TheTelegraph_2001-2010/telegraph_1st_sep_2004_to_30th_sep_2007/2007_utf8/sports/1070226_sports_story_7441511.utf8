 Venus clinches title on comeback

Memphis: Venus Williams put the seal on her comeback after more than four months out through injury as she crushed Israeli top seed Shahar Peer 6-1, 6-1 on Saturday to win the Memphis International. 

The former world No. 1 cruised to victory over the world No. 17, sealing victory in 68 minutes to win her 34th career title. Williams crunched a forehand down the line to seal her first tournament victory since her Wimbledon 2005 triumph. 

Against Peer, the winner of five Grand Slam titles was dominant from the start, breaking in the second and sixth games on her way to the first set. It was the same story in the second as Williams overpowered Peer in all departments, breaking in the third, fifth and seventh games to take the title. 

In the mens event, top seed Andy Roddick beat Andy Murray 6-3, 7-6 on Saturday to reach the final.

 Dinda lessons from Lillee

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bengal mediumpacer Ashok Dinda is oozing confidence after having worked with the legendary Dennis Lillee at the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai last month. 

When I was dropped from the Bengal side for the National one-dayers (East Zone) this season, Sourav Ganguly decided to send me for a three-day training camp (February 20-22) under Lillee Sir, Dinda said. 

According to the 22-year-old quick, it has been a good learning experience. He says he can now bowl the out-swinger. I was asked to go for a diagonal run-up instead of my normal straight one and also to have a shorter jump at the point of delivery, Dinda said. Thereafter, it has become easier to bowl the out-swinger. 

Lillee and T.A. Sekar apart, Dinda also rubbed shoulders with Jawagal Srinath and Sreesanth. It was a good feeling to bowl alongside Sreesanth who was there before leaving for the West Indies, Dinda said.

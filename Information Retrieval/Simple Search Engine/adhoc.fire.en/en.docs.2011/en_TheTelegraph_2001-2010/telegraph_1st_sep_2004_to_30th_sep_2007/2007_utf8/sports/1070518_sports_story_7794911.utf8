 White ball on ICC agenda

Melbourne: The discolouring of the white ball in one-day Internationals and shrinking size of playing fields will be two of many issues to be discussed by the newly-constituted ICC cricket committee, which meets in Dubai, later this month, feels former Australian captain Mark Taylor. 

They (the ICC) want people who see it from different points of view. One thing were all trying to get right is the white ball in one-day cricket. That is something Im sure will spark a lot of debate, Taylor, who was recently inducted into the 13-man committee headed by Sunil Gavaskar, said. 

There has already been quite a bit of chat in cricket circles about that. Whether we should use a new ball from each end or change the ball at a given time during the innings just to make it easier for people to see, Taylor was quoted as saying by a website. 

Taylor also wondered whether boundaries that had been brought in over recent years to standardise playing fields and offer players a safety zone between the rope and the fence had swung the game too heavily in favour of batsmen.

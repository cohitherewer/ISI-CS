The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Good start by Atwal

Duluth (Georgia): Arjun Atwal, working hard to find his way back on the USPGA Tour, made a good start with a two-under 70 that gave him a share of the 22nd spot after the first round at the AT amp; T Classic. 

Daniel Chopra fired a one-under 71 and was tied 49th. 

The field was led by Kevin Sutherland, who carded a seven-under 65 that gave him a two-shot lead. 

Sutherland, who had eight birdies and one bogey, played his career best at the TPC Sugarloaf course by three shots. 

Sutherlands best this season has been a second at AT amp; T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. 

Atwal had four birdies and two bogeys. He was well placed for a much higher finish, but two late bogeys on 16th and 17th sandwiched between birdies on 15th and 18th brought his card to 70. His other birdies were on fourth and 11th. 

Among other Asian Tour stars, Koreas Kevin Na also shot a 70 with four birdies against one double bogey. Japans Daisuke Maruyama and Swedens Daniel Chopra, both winners in Asia, were amongst those in 49th position on 71.

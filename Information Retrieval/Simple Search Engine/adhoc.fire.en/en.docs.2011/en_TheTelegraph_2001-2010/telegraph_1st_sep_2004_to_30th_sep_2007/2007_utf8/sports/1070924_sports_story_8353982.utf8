The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The supreme irony: India, Pakistan opposed meet

- Everyone is enjoying... there are no superstars: Dhoni

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Shoaib Malik were only too happy to pose with the ICC World Twenty20 trophy on Sunday afternoon, in the lead-up to Mondays dhamaka-promising final. However, the supreme irony is that the Indian and Pakistani Boards initially opposed the tournament! 

In fact, wholly because of their strong reservations, the ICC chose to make it an invitation event. In other words, it wasnt mandatory for the Test-playing nations to participate. Later, of course, India and Pakistan relented. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, the change in heart had much to do with securing South Africas support for Asias (successful, as it turned out) 2011 World Cup bid. 

Its highly unlikely that South Africa wouldve backed the Asian nations had India and Pakistan offended the Ray Malis by staying away from what is the maiden Twenty20 World Cup... Obviously, an understanding was quietly reached, maintained one of the sources. 

Former Indian Board president Inderjit Singh Bindra confirmed that, early on, there was opposition. Thats because there was a resolution during Jagmohan Dalmiyas time opposing Twenty20 on the grounds that it would cannibalise the 50 overs game... We got it changed, he said. 

Pakistans initial stand, one learns, had much to do with ex-Board chairman Shaharyar Khans rather traditional outlook. Even he did a U-turn in the larger interest getting the World Cup back to Asia. 

While the about-to-end tournament has the status of an invitation event, participation is compulsory in the 2009 edition, in England. 

The ICC hasnt decided beyond 2009, but everything points to the World Twenty20 becoming a permanent fixture in its calendar. Indeed, it could knock off the Champions Trophy from the No.2 position (after the quadrennial World Cup). 

Meanwhile, its not assured that the ICC will introduce another category Twenty20 Player of the Year in its awards from next year. 

Theres a cap on a maximum of seven Twenty20 Internationals (excluding appearances in any ICC tournament) in a year and, so, there wont really be many matches to choose from... But, then, this could be discussed at a later date, remarked an ICC official. 

Footnote: The Indian Board president, Sharad Pawar, is going to be at the Wanderers during the final. Also flying with him is selection committee chairman Dilip Vengsarkar, vice-president Rajeev Shukla, secretary Niranjan Shah and Bindra.

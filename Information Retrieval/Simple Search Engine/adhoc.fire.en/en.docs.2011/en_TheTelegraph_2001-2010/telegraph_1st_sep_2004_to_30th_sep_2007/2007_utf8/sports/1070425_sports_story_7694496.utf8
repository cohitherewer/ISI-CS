Kingston: Sri Lanka smashed 102 runs off the last 10 overs to reach 289 for five against New Zealand in Tuesdays World Cup semi-final at Sabina Park. 

Captain Mahela Jayawardene led the late onslaught, starting slowly before reaching 115 not out with some blistering shots. 

He shared in a crucial fifth-wicket partnership of 81 with Tillekeratne Dilshan after opener Upul Tharanga had hit 73 from 74 balls to provide the platform for the late push. 

Jayawardene hit 10 fours and three sixes to set New Zealand a tough target to reach their first World Cup final. 

Sri Lanka, the 1996 champion, won the toss and chose to bat first. But they were initially slowed by the loss of early wickets and a track that proved less bouncy than expected. 

Leftarm paceman James Franklin bowled opener Sanath Jayasuriya in the third over and got rid of Kumar Sangakkara, making it 67 for two off 14 overs. 

Jayawardene had chosen to bat hoping to put his team in line for a place in Saturdays final in Barbados against South Africa or Australia, who meet in St. Lucia on Wednesday. 

However, New Zealand, who have lost their four previous semi-finals, bowled well initially with the return of Shane Bond from a stomach complaint and Jacob Oram from a right heel injury. 

Jayasuriya was bowled by Franklin for one when, trying to send the ball to midwicket down the leg side, he misjudged a straight delivery. 

Paceman Bond, who missed the Black Caps Super Eights 215-run crushing by Australia, bowled an erratic first over containing a wide and two easy fours by Tharanga down the leg side. 

He beat Sangakkara with an outswinger that just missed the edge of the bat, but it was Franklin that was the most dangerous and productive bowler. 

Sangakkara and Tharanga built a 54-run partnership and the opener brought up Sri Lankas 50 off 65 balls with a four that just went over the fielder at backward point. 

However, Sangakkaras disappointing form with the bat continued in the next over, the 14th, when he mistimed a drive off Franklin straight to New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming at mid on. 

He had managed just 18 off 42 balls. 

That brought Jayawardene to the crease. But the captain struggled to give his teams innings any impetus at the 20,000-seat stadium that was less than half full. He faced 48 balls before hitting his first boundary. 

Tharanga survived a leg-before-wicket appeal by Franklin when on 41 and went on to reach his half century off 51 balls with eight fours. 

The opener, whose place was in doubt after a succession of low scores, beat his previous tournament best score of 64 and hit the first six of the innings in the 22nd over before being bowled by spinner Daniel Vettori at the start of the 26th. 

Umpire Rudi Koertzen incorrectly gave out Chamara Silva lbw to Bond to make it 152 for four after 35 overs, the ball clearly taking an inside edge first. 

However, Jayawardene finally accelerated and reached 50 off 76 balls for his 39th one-day half century. 

 His 64-ball partnership with Dilshan ended when his 

 batting partner fell for 30 to Oram after another debatable 

 lbw decision, the ball clearly missing leg stump by a long 

 way. But Jayawardene continued to dominate with a series 

 of jabs, cuts and flicks that often made their way to the 

 boundary.

 Muttiah Muralidharan 

 took two quick wickets to leave New Zealand struggling at 

 114/5 after 24 overs. Opener Peter Fulton was batting on 

 46 while Craig McMillan was yet to open his account. Brendon 

 McCullum (0) was the last man to be dismissed.

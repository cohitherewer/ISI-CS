 Nadal overwhelming favourite

 - Davydenko sounds confident ahead of Federer clash 

Paris: Novak Djokovic hit delicate drop shots and 200 kph serves, thunderous forehands and sharply angled backhands, mixing strokes so well that even the relentless Rafael Nadal struggled to chase them down. 

That was two months ago at the hardcourt final in Key Biscayne, where Djokovic achieved the biggest victory of his career. 

Another milestone looms on Friday, when the genial Serb plays in a Grand Slam semi-final for the first time, at the French Open. 

Once again, the opponent will be Nadal. This time the Spaniard will be on his favourite surface clay. 

Top-ranked Roger Federer, seeking the only Grand Slam title he has yet to win, will face Nikolay Davydenko in the other semi-final. 

Davydenko, seeded fourth, has lost to Federer in eight previous meetings but sees no reason why he would not stage a major upset. 

Weve played many times and Ive often had chances to win, the Russian said. He often has trouble against me. 

Hes really improved over the years, Federer said of the 26-year-old. Hes more consistent from the baseline and his serve has improved a lot. Hes very tough to play against. 

Djokovic, at 20, is the newest celebrity in mens tennis, touted as a future Grand Slam champion because of his athleticism and allround game. 

The slender Djokovic may lack the strength and stamina to stay with the muscular Nadal in a grinding clay-court match, however. 

Nadal is 19-0 at Roland Garros, 32-0 in best-of-five-set matches on clay and bidding to become the first man to win three consecutive French titles since Bjorn Borg in 1978-81. 

Nadals run in Paris includes a victory in the 2006 quarter finals against Djokovic, who retired with a back injury trailing 4-6, 4-6. 

Hes the best player in the world on this surface, and everybody knows that, Djokovic said. Hes really dominant, and he hasnt lost at the French Open in the past three years. So he plays with a lot of motivation and confidence. And physically hes very ready and probably the most prepared player on the tour. (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Port Trust 

docked six points

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) have been made to pay dearly for the abandoned Premier Division match against Peerless eight days ago. 

Not only have Peerless been awarded full points, CPT have been slapped a one-game suspension which means they will be barred from playing their next match. 

CPT goalkeeper Prasanta Dora had lost consciousness after a collision with Subair Muritala. Since there was no doctor at the ground, Dora had to be rushed to hospital where he regained consciousness. 

This decision was arrived at after taking into consideration the referee and match commissioners reports, said IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly after the meeting of the league sub-committee on Tuesday evening. CPT refused to continue after the injury to Dora. The members felt that was not done. 

CPT official Shibaji Banerjee, a former India goalie, expressed surprise at the decision. We didnt refuse to play the referee didnt pick up the ball which had been pushed into our goal after the collision, he never blew the whistle for resumption, said Banerjee. 

In fact, we showed a CD to the IFA and CRA officials in which the referee (Udayan Haldar) is saying that the game had been abandoned because there was no doctor, said Banerjee. Ill discuss todays development with my seniors before deciding on our next course of action. We may appeal. 

Asked what action the IFA would take following the Dora incident, Ganguly said: Ill ask all Premier Division teams to have a doctor during their matches. As for the IFA, Im saying again its not possible to post doctors at all grounds and I dont want to discriminate against any team. 

We provide medical assistance and well also have doctors on call so that emergencies can be attended to as quickly as possible.

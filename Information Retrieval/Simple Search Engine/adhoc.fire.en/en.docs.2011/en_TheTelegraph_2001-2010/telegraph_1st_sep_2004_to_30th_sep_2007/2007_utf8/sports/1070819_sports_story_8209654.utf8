 Materazzi comes clean, finally

Milan: Italy defender Marco Materazzi has finally revealed the exact words he used to provoke Zinedine Zidane into headbutting him in last years World Cup final. 

I prefer the w***e that is your sister, he said in an interview with a magazine that comes out on Monday, Italian media reported on Saturday. 

Materazzi had previously said he had mentioned the France midfielders sister in the verbal jousting between the two in the Berlin final, but had never given the exact words. 

Zidane, who retired after the final, was sent off for the headbutt and Italy subsequently won on penalties.

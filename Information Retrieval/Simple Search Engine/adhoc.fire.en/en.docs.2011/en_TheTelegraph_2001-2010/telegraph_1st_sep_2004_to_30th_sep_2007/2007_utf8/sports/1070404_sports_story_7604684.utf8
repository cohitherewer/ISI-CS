 Jeev Milkha at 47th spot

New Delhi: Despite struggling to find form in the USPGA Tour, Jeev Milkha Singh managed to be among worlds top 50 golfers being 47th in the latest rankings. 

Jeev, who finished a disappointing tied 78th in last weeks Shell Houston Open, has 2.37 average points and continues to be Asias second best golfer. 

The seasoned pro will be hoping for a revival of fortunes as he prepares to realise his childhood dreams when he makes a historic Masters debut at the fabled Augusta National Golf Club this week. 

Jyoti Randhawa is the next Indian in the list at 84th with 1.59 average points followed way down by Shiv Kapur (0.96) at the 167th position. (PTI)

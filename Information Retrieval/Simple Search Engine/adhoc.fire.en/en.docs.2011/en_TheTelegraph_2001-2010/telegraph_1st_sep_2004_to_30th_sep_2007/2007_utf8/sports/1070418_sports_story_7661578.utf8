 Lanka tactics puzzle Ricky

St Georges: Australian captain Ricky Ponting was puzzled by Sri Lankas decision to rest their two key bowlers, wondering if such a big loss would not have an impact on their morale. 

It would be interesting to see how they bounce back, for this has been a pretty big loss for them ahead of the semi-finals, said Ponting after his side carved out a seven-wicket win with seven-odd overs to spare. 

Sri Lanka did not play Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah Muralidharan, citing tiredness and fatigue as the reason for their absence, though many thought it was to prevent the Australians from having a look at the two key bowlers. 

It doesnt matter to us what the opposition does. They can plan their strategy anyway they want. Its fine with us. 

Even if their bowling was weakened, their batting was at its full strength and we did restrict them to a reasonable total, the Australian captain said. 

Ponting dismissed the notion that his batsmen had missed out on an opportunity to face and get valuable practice against Muralidharan. It does not worry us any way. Weve a very good footage about him and we know pretty well what he does with his stuff. We also play him well, said Ponting. 

Ponting was all praise for his bowlers who have bowled out every other team in this tournament except Bangladesh. (PTI)

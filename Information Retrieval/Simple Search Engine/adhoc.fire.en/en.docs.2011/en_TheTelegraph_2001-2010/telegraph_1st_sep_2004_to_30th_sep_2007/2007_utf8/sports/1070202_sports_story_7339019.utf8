The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Goan players asked to sign indemnity bond

 National Games football 

 New Delhi: Despite repeated assurances from the Assam government, some of the sports associations in the country are yet not sure about the safety of their sportspersons during the National Games in Guwahati. 

So much so, that the Goa Football Association (GFA) has asked all its players to sign an indemnity bond before taking part in the Games. The bond has made it clear that the concerned association wont be held responsible for the safety of the footballers if any untoward incident happens during the Games and they should be going to Guwahati at their own risk. 

It may be recalled that when the AIFF proposed to host the National football championships for the Santosh Trophy in Srinagar last year, GFA refused to take part because of security reasons. 

Speaking to The Telegraph on Thursday, GFA secretary Savio Messias said the idea of getting the sportspersons sign a bond was actually mooted by the Goa Olympic Association. We, on our part, incorporated GFAs name into it, he said. 

Incidentally, the secretary of the Bihar Olympic Association S. Ejaz Husain said his contingent would be in full force in Guwahati for the Games. I know that people from my state have mainly been targetted by the terrorists in that area, but we have decided to live up to the spirit of the Games and take part in the meet.

 Autopsy review delayed

Port of Spain: A report on the controversial post-mortem by Indian-born pathologist Dr Ere Seshiah in the Bob Woolmer case has been delayed as the commission reviewing the autopsy procedures wants more time to ascertain the facts. 

The commission, headed by former high court judge Ian Forte, was supposed to complete its review on Tuesday but permanent secretary in the national security ministry Gilbert Scott said that it would take more time to submit the report, according to a local newspaper. 

We now expect that we should be getting it somewhere in another two to three weeks, Scott was quoted as saying by the paper. (PTI)

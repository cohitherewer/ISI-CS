 AC Milan coach yet to decide on strike force

THE TIMES, LONDON AMP; AGENCIES

Carlo Ancelotti, the AC Milan coach, has an attacking dilemma for Wednesdays Champions League final. Ancelotti sent out a reserve side in Saturdays 2-3 home league defeat by Udinese to save his leading players for the match against Liverpool in Athens. 

Milan cannot play Ronaldo, who is cup-tied, while Ricardo Oliveira, the Brazilian, is out of form, so Ancelotti has to decide who will take the position of lone striker. 

Filippo Inzaghis experience could hold sway. The 33-year-old has played in more key games than his teammate Alberto Gilardino. I have not made my decision yet on the attacking front, Ancelotti said. I will have to evaluate the physical condition of both players. It is probably the most difficult choice to make. 

Inzaghi, whose 12 goals in the competition were pivotal in his team winning the European Cup in 2003, missed the defeat by Liverpool in the final two years ago through injury. This would be the first Champions League final for Gilardino. 

From a psychological point of view, Inzaghi is favourite because he has more experience in finals, Ancelotti said. But Gilardino is very good in fast counter-attacks and on one-on-ones, while Inzaghi is more of a finisher. 

The coach will wait until the last minute to see if Paolo Maldini, the captain, will be fit. The 38-year-old defender is battling a knee injury. 

Meanwhile, German referee Herbert Fandel will be in charge of Wednesdays Champions League final between AC Milan and Liverpool, European soccers governing body Uefa confirmed on Monday, adds another report from Athens. 

The 43-year-old German had been in the running for the final with Slovakias Lubos Michel. Uefa said that it will be the first time that he has handled a game in Athens, adding, he is no stranger to the two finalists.

 Win matters, not centuries 

 - Wish I could get out in the Nineties in every match, says Sachin 

 He is a fabulous player and I rsquo;ve seen him play since junior days. I enjoy playing with him. He plays wonderful shots and it rsquo;s a treat to

 watch him

 Sachin on Sourav

Belfast: Any player would rue missing back-to-back centuries, but Sachin Tendulkar said he would not complain as long as the team was winning. 

Sachin had fallen one run shy of a century in the first ODI on Tuesday and on Friday, he was out for 93, dragging a Thandi Tshabalala delivery onto his stumps. 

Its not that I get out in the 90s deliberately. I wish I could do that in every match, he said in lighter vein. But as long as the team is winning, everything else is secondary, he added. 

During the course of the match, Sachin, who was adjudged man of the match, also became the first player to cross the 15,000-run mark in ODIs. 

Sachin and Sourav Ganguly laid the foundation for a win with an opening stand of 134 and the batting maestro was all praise for his left-handed partner. 

He is a fabulous player and Ive seen him play since junior days. I enjoy playing with him. He plays wonderful shots and its a treat to watch him, he said. 

Sachin said the pitch had enough bounce to offer, which prompted him to charge the South African attack. 

We saw the bounce in the pitch and our best chance was to counterattack. We played our shots even though we were beaten a number of times. But in the end, what matters is what is on the scoreboard. 

I try to play according to the situation. You cant play the same way in every match. You have to take the pitch and conditions into consideration, he said. 

Heaping praise on Sachin, captain Rahul Dravid said, Its good to see him dominate the bowlers again and it augurs well for the rest of the tour. 

Dravid said he had not initially planned to continue with the slow bowlers for as many as 28 overs but one has to be flexible and plans cant be written in stone. 

We figured out that South Africans dont enjoy spin in the last few overs and look for pace on the ball. Yuvraj (Singh) bowled exceptionally well and, with the bat, finished the match from a crunch situation. 

South African captain Jacques Kallis admitted that batting was difficult in the early overs of the innings and the side probably fell 20-30 runs short. 

Even then, it was a fantastic effort by the boys to fight till the end. In a close game like this, anything can happen. (PTI)

 Dont write off India, says De Silva 

Mumbai: Despite their recent string of poor results, the inclusion of senior players before the World Cup has added weight to Indias chances at the cricketing extravaganza, former Sri Lankan captain Aravinda De Silva said on Friday. 

By bringing in senior guys back into the team, it is at great advantage with a combination of youngsters like Yuvraj Singh and wicketkeeper-batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Dont underestimate India at the World Cup, De silva, a Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon brand ambassador, said. 

De Silva, who played a key role in Sri Lankas 1996 World Cup triumph, pointed out that with the Dhonis aggressive batting style, he should be elevated up the batting order. 

The composition of the Sri Lankan side looks a balanced one, and De Silva said the former world champions will do well in this years edition of crickets premier event to be held in the West Indies in March. This year is a great opportunity for Sri Lankan cricket. After a long time, the balance and combination is great, he said. (PTI)

 The players coach

The unassuming Graham Ford is known as a players coach. More than a few eyebrows were raised when he got the job of coaching a high-profile South African side bypassing several bigger and more familiar names. 

An allround sportsman, Ford is a former provincial tennis champion, played football for a provincial side and is a qualified Rugby Union referee to go with his cricketing credentials. 

He became coach of the senior Natal side in 1992. There he guided a crop of outstanding youngsters, including Shaun Pollock, Jonty Rhodes and Lance Klusener. His approach proved effective when in 1996-97 Natal won the domestic and first class competitions. 

At the beginning of 1999, Ford was appointed assistant to Bob Woolmer in New Zealand, a role he carried through till the 1999 World Cup, before taking charge when Woolmers contract ended. Under his guidance, South Africa won nine of the 11 series. He was fired in 2002. 

He moved to Kent as director of cricket in 2005. He briefly moved back home to take charge of the Dolphins. In 2006, he agreed to a new contract with Kent till 2008 and has been there since.

 Insider fear in locker-room thefts

London: Locker-room thieves are targeting the worlds top tennis players and Wimbledon is the latest victim. 

Players and coaches on the international circuit have suffered at least 15 thefts this year from Melbourne to Paris, sparking fears that an insider could be responsible. 

The first to be hit at Wimbledon this week were former French Open champion Albert Costa, who had a bag of euros and dollars stolen, and French player Michael Llodra, who had his wallet taken. 

We will try to do everything we can to ensure this doesnt happen again on our premises, a Wimbledon spokesman said after the robberies were reported. 

Despite strict checks on who comes into the locker-rooms on the Tour, these are just the latest in a rash of incidents that have alarmed the ATP. 

Asked if insiders might be to blame, ATP spokesman Andre Silva said: We obviously dont know who is doing it and I dont want to speculate. 

He estimated that there had been about 15 thefts already this year. 

Czech player Radek Stepanek, the fianc of Switzerlands former world No. 1 Martina Hingis, had 5,000 euros ($6,723) taken in Monte Carlo. 

Swedens Jonas Bjorkman, reported the loss of personal effects at both the Australian and French Opens. 

Frenchman Sebastian Grosjean was one of three players robbed at the Queens grasscourt meet earlier this month. 

Silva said: We do take it seriously. Last year we passed a rule tightening up credentials in the locker-room. Players (even) have to tell us who their coaches are.

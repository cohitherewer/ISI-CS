 NEIL HARMAN in PARIS 

 Jelena Jankovic 

Hey, nice match, man. Richard Williams walked across the concourse and shook Richard Brooks hand an alliance of coaches after a marvellous match. Williams we know well, the giant, stooping, cigarillo-in-mouth father of Venus Williams. Of Brooks, little is appreciated, a former Middlesex player who has been steering the career of Jelena Jankovic for the past seven months. 

He is half English his father, David, is from Ruislip and half Spanish, he had worked at the academy in Benidorm where Ricardo Sanchez, who oversees Jankovics career, is based when he is not travelling with Colombias top players. 

When Sanchez needed someone to tour full-time with Jankovic, the Serb, he turned to Brooks. The 25-year-old, who reached a career-high ranking of No. 1,036 in May 2003, did not need asking twice. The results have been astonishing. Jankovic has risen from outside the top 10 on the WTA Tour at the start of the year to No. 4 with titles in Rome, Charleston and Auckland, recording victories over Amlie Mauresmo, Martina Hingis (twice), Svetlana Kuznetsova and, on Friday, a poised and compelling 6-4, 4-6, 6-1 win against Venus to reach the fourth round. 

Brooks led the support team for Jankovic, which included Manuel Santana, the former French Open, US Open and Wimbledon champion, who is a close friend of the Jankovics. At the end of the match they all stood and Santana apart drew their arms horizontally across their throats in a gesture whose meaning they are keeping to themselves. 

When he was a young player in Britain, Brooks accepts that he used to let his temper get the better of him a character is a popular description from his contemporaries. 

Yes, I had problems, I was explosive but it was just the way I was, the federation never really understood my attitude to the game, it wasnt a good connection, Brooks said. 

Both Jelena and I work the same way, it is hard but we have fun. I believe she will be the No. 1 player in the world, otherwise I would not want to work with her.

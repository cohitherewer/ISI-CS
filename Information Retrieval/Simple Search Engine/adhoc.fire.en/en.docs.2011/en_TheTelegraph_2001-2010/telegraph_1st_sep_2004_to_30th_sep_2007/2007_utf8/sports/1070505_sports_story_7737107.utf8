 Ganguly new IFA president 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Eminent industrialist Satyabrata Ganguly will be the new Indian Football Association (IFA) president for next three years. The post fell vacant following the sudden death of Aditya Kashyap. 

The appointment of Ganguly was announced during IFAs annual general meeting on Friday. Secretary Subrata Dutta, meanwhile, said that he wouldnt seek an extension once his term got over. 

It has also been decided that all CFL Premier Division clubs must have an under-19 side, in view of AIFFs move to kickstart the Professional League from next season.

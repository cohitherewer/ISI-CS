The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A great honour: Jhulan

A STAFF REPORTER 

 Jhulan 

Calcutta: Jhulan Goswami and Rumeli Dhar have guided the country to some famous wins. The Indian womens cricket has now more reasons to smile when the ICC nominated the duo for the Womens Cricketer of the Year award. 

Its a great honour. What is more satisfying is that Rumeli has also got the nomination, Jhulan said on Tuesday. 

The Indian vice-captain, Jhulan was instrumental in Indias maiden series victory in England last year. During that tour, she became the first woman to bag 10 wickets in a match. 

She also bagged the player of the series award. 

That tour of England was the real turning point in my career. Maybe, this nomination is a recognition of my consistency throughout the season, she said. 

Jhulan, who also represented Asia XI in the Afro-Asia tournament in India in June, revealed that Sourav Gangulys comeback had influenced her performance. 

 The way he (Sourav) fought his way back in the side has been an inspiration to all. Ive always looked up to him to play better, she maintained. 

Whether I get the award or not, the nomination itself is a huge boost for me. It has given me more responsibility as a player, said Jhulan.

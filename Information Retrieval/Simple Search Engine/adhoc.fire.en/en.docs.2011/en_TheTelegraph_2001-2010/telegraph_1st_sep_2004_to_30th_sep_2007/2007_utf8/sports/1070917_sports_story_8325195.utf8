 SSP tied 14th 

Guangzhou: Weighed down by two double bogeys, one on each side of the turn, SSP Chowrasia returned a final-round two-over 73 to finish tied 14th at the inaugural Midea China Classic. 

Chowrasia, who was in top five for the first three days, was unable to find rhythm with both his hitting and the putter to finish with a total of 11-under 273. Rahil Gangjee (70) finished 21st with nine-under 275 and Gurbaaz Mann (71) was 61st at one-over 285. (PTI)

 Dempo cleared of charges

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The Appeals Committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Thursday has exonerated Dempo Sports Club of charges of forging documents while trying to stop defender D. Ravanan from switching to Mohun Bagan at the start of the season. 

Earlier, the Disciplinary Committee of the AIFF had found Dempo guilty of wrongfully trying to deny Ravanan an inter-state transfer that included an alleged forged signature of the footballer and slapped a fine of Rs. 1.1 lakh on the Goan club. 

According to federation sources, the Appeals Committee, which met on Thursday, has waived the fine on the club as it did not find enough proof against the former NFL champions and said there was lack of expert opinion in the case. 

The Appeals Committee has also absolved the IFA and East Bengal, who were facing fines for forcing striker Vimal Pariyar to play for the state and club and miss the under-20 camp. 

Sporting Clube de Goas Nicolas Rodrigues was fined Rs. 5,000 for signing for Mahindra United, despite having a three-year contract with Sporting.0

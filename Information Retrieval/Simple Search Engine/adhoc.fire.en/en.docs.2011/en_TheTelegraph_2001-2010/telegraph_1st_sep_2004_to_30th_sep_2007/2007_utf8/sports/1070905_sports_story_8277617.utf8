 EB set JCT date in quarters 

 Ashim (top) scored one and Edmilson a brace 

Ludhiana: East Bengal stormed into the quarter finals of the 29th Federation Cup with a 3-1 victory over Mohammedan Sporting on Tuesday. 

Brazilian Edmilson Marques found the net twice in the second-half after Ashim Biswas had given the red-and-gold brigade the lead in the 22nd minute. K. Kulothungan scored for Mohammedan Sporting on the cusp of half-time. 

East Bengal will now take on JCT who also defeated Vasco SC by identical margin for a spot in the semi-finals on Sunday. East Bengal, who thrashed Mohammedan Sporting 6-2 in the CFL Premier Division, looked the more cohesive unit and duly took the lead midway in the first-half when Ashim headed in a cross from the right past keeper Nasibul Haque. 

Undaunted by the setback, Mohammedan Sporting continued probing the East Bengal box with their Nigerian import Paul MacJames Nwachukwa keeping the rival rearguard on its toes. But when the defence was breached, India goalkeeper Subrata Paul was there with an assured pair of hands, thwarting their attempts. 

Just after Ashims goal, a deflected shot from Kulothungan was brilliantly saved by Paul, who certainly had had a boost in confidence after his stellar display in the Nehru Cup. Paul MacJames wasted another golden chance when he had only the keeper to beat from close range but made a hash of it. 

Just on the stroke of half-time, Mohammedan Sportings fighting spirit yielded result when the Nigerian latched on to a through ball and got past Surkumar Singh on the left. His shot was saved by a diving Paul but an onrushing Kulothungan hammered home the rebound. 

The equaliser seemed to stir East Bengal out of their comfort zone and they took the game by the scruff of its neck in the second-half. 

Alvito DCunha, who has been in splendid form in the CFL Premier Division, delivered a pass to Ashim on the left flank, who quickly centred for a diving Edmilson to head home in the 52nd minute. 

The Brazilian found his second 15 minutes later when Alvito again played the catalyst, giving a through to him and Edmilson showed impressive composure to wait for the keeper to commit before finding the target.

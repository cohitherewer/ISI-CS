 CAS keeps Pak board waiting

Karachi: The Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) in Geneva is yet to respond to Pakistan boards reminders whether the former had the jurisdiction to hear a case filed by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) against the exoneration of Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif. 

A PCB official confirmed that two reminders had been sent to CAS asking it to confirm the status of the challenge made by Pakistan. 

We are still waiting for a reply from them. We want this case to be resolved as soon as possible so that our players can get on with their cricket without any pressure on them, said a senior board official. 

The CAS has constituted a committee to decide if it has the jurisdiction to rule on the case. 

Shoaib and Asif had tested positive for a banned substance nandrolone last October and were recalled from the Champions Trophy in India. 

They were banned for two and one years respectively in November but than exonerated by an appellate panel of the PCB which lifted the bans. 

Wada has challenged the decision to lift the bans and the PCB appellate panels decision to allow the two players to resume their international careers. 

Both missed the World Cup due to fitness problems according to the board but sources suggest Shoaib and Asif were dropped from the World Cup squad because of the doping issue. 

The official said they were expecting a verdict from the CAS as the PCB and Wada had both dispatched their statements and defence papers before the World Cup.

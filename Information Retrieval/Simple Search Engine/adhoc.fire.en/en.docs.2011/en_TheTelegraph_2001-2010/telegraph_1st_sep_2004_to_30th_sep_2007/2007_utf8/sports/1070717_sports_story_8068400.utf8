 PCB insists on running locals down: Abbas 

Karachi: Former Test captain Zaheer Abbas joined Pakistans leading Test run-getter Javed Miandad on Monday to lash out at the cricket authorities for sacrificing patriotism and nationalism while appointing another foreign coach for the senior side. 

According to Abbas, the decision to appoint Lawson was a waste of money. Our own people are as good as foreigners and can do an equally good job. But for some reason the board insists on running us down, but for how long? he asked. 

Miandad pointed out that Pakistan in their last two World Cups had foreign coaches in Richard Pybus and Woolmer and on both occasions, they failed to progress to the next round. 

I dont know what they (PCB) are trying to do with our cricket. It has been proved by previous experiments that we dont need a foreign coach but they keep on making the same mistakes, Miandad said. 

I dont mind them bringing in foreign people as long as they can give us guarantees that they will do better than the locals, Miandad said. 

Miandad admitted he didnt know much about Lawson.

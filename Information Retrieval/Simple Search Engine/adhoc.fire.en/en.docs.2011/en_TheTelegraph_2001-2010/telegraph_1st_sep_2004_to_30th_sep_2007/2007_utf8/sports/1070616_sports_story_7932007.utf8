 Dougherty leads by 1 shot

 CHRIS DUFRESNE

Oakmont: No one was calling Oakmont Country Club Old Softy, although the first morning of the 107th US Open had to be described as almost forgiving. Then, it quickly reverted back to forget-about-it. 

A tournament-eve thunderstorm produced enough rain (four-tenths of an inch) to take some of the punch out of Oakmonts gloves and allowed two red scores to infiltrate the first-day leaderboard Thursday. 

Nick Dougherty, trying to become the first European to win the US Open since Tony Jacklin in 1970, leads the field after his bangers-and-hash round of two-under-par 68. 

The 25-year-old Briton holds a one-shot lead over Argentinas Angel Cabrera, who shot a 69. They were the only players to shoot under par. 

Bubba Watson and Jose Maria Olazabal are two shots behind after shooting 70s. They both ordered sunrise room service. 

 Im delighted with that, the 25-year-old Englishman said after raising hopes of a first European major victory in eight years. I think we had it as good as it could be. 

We had it as good as it could be this morning after the thunderstorm yesterday (Wednesday) because you can stop the ball on some of the holes. I didnt play that well from tee to green but my short game was red-hot, added Dougherty. 

The top four scores, and 13 of the top 20, were fired on morning starts. Dougherty was even through 12 holes before birdies on Nos. 13 and 17 pushed him to two-under. 

Tiger Woods, a two-time US Open winner, and defending champion Geoff Ogilvy lead a gaggle of golfers three shots back at 71. 

Phil Mickelson, playing despite an injured left wrist, flogged his way to a 74 as he fought a steel-cage death match against Oakmonts outer reaches. 

Grimacing his way through 18 holes, Mickelson might have shot eight or 10 over if not for his deft short game and scrambling talents. 

I think Im below the winning score, Mickelson said of his four-over standing. 

And the wrist? I wouldnt say its painful, he said. But its annoying, I would say. 

Woods seeks his 13th major championship and was downright relieved to be only three shots behind Dougherty. 

He saved his round when he made par at the 16th by rolling in an eight-foot putt, birdied the short 17th and then made an up-and-down par at the 18th from the rough. 

That was a nice way to end the round, said the 2000 and 2002 US Open champion. 

If you shoot three, four or five over par, youre still in the tournament and youve got to hang in there. Its as soft and receptive as youre possibly going to have it. 

Several big names effectively shot themselves out of contention, twice champion Retief Goosen double-bogeying the last for a 76 and world No. 6 Henrik Stenson and Spaniard Sergio Garcia limping to 79s.

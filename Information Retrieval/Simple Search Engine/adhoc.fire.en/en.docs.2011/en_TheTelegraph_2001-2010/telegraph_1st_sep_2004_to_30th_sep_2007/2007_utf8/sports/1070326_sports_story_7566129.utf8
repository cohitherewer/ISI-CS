 Vaughan eager to forget tough week

Gros Islet: Michael Vaughan looked back at the end of the World Cup group stages and admitted he had a week he didnt want to have. 

But the one consolation for the England captain was that his team had advanced beyond the first phase of the World Cup for the first time since 1996. 

There are no survivors in the current England squad from the one beaten by Sri Lanka 11 years ago in the quarter finals but a seven-wicket win against Kenya here on Saturday saw Vaughans men into the Super Eight in the Caribbean. 

It was a win achieved against an extraordinary backdrop of off-field dra ma. First England had to cope with the fall-out that saw Andrew Flintoff stripped of the vice-captaincy and dropped from the team that beat Canada last Sunday. 

Then came the news that Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer had been murdered. The former England batsman, whod been in charge of County side Warwickshire, was a familiar figure to many current England players. 

However, England with Flintoff back in the side bowled out Kenya for a modest 177 in a match reduced by rain to 43 overs per side and then knocked off the 178 they needed to win with 10 overs left. Its been a week as an England captain you dont want to have, said Vaughan. Its been tough for everyone. 

And Vaughan said he was happy to have Flintoff. When you have your premier allrounder back in your team we look a better team for that. Hell be happy with the way he bowled. 

England now leave for Guyana and have a few days off before their next match against Ireland. 

Kevin Pietersen is also happy with his form, having hit 60 against New Zealand and 55 on Saturday in a 103-run third-wicket stand. 

Hopefully we are getting a bit better suited to the wickets, Pietersen said. That is key. Hopefully we can win four or five games in the Super Eight and get ourselves back into the semi-finals. 

England coach Duncan Fletcher also said his side must win a minimum of four out of their six Super Eight games if they are to reach the semi-finals. 

Every win is important for us, having lost that first one (against New Zealand), he said. The minimum amount of wins is four. Weve got to go and win four games starting with that first one.

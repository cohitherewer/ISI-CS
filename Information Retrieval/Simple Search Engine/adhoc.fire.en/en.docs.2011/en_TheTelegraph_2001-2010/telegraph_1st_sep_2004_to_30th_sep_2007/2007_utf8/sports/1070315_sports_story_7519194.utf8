 We have a bright chance: Srikkanth

 Srikkanth

Mumbai: Considering the nature of wickets in the West Indies and the potency of Indian attack, the team has a bright chance at the World Cup, feels former India captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth. 

I would not be surprised if India win the World Cup. The conditions in the Caribbean and the sub-continent are similar. Thats why India have a good chance, the former India opening batsman said. 

On the occasion of unveiling of the worlds largest cricket bat, Srikkanth said, Apart from the two world-class spinners in Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh, we have good part-time tweakers, lending us good variety. 

On Australias recent reversals against England and New Zealand, the 47-year-old said that the spate of defeats were a blessing in disguise for the world champions. 

Meanwhile, an integral member of the 1983 World Cup-winning squad, Yashpal Sharma too echoed Srikkanth, saying the slower West Indian tracks would help the Indians. 

The pitches have changed, its not the same as in the early 80s. They have been on the slower side which will help our spinners. We also have seam bowlers who will get more help on such surfaces, said Sharma. 

The 52-year-old, who made his Test debut against England in 1979 at Lords, said the Indian teams strength lay in spin bowling and its vital that they should back it up. 

If you think its not a hard enough wicket then we should play both the spinners, Kumble and Harbhajan. 

I still believe that Indias strength is spin and they should have faith in them the specialist spinners. The same mistake was done in the last World Cup where Kumble hardly played, Yashpal added.

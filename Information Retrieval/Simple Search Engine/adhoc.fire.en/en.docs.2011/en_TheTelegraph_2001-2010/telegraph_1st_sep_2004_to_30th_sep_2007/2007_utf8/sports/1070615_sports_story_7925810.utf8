Calcutta: The brother-sister duo of Rahul and Dola Banerjee made the Super Eight with maximum points 79 and 120 points, respectively in the recurve section of the third national ranking prize money tournament on Thursday. 

Three from each section the mens and womens recurve and mens and womens compound will be picked for the India squad for the 44th World Archery Championship to be held in Leipzig (July 7-15) after the final round on Friday. 

In the Olympic round of the mens recurve at the SAI, Eastern Centre, on Thursday, Steel Plant Sports Boards Rahul and Jayanta Talukdar clinched the gold and bronze medals, while Railways Mangal Singh Champia won the silver. 

Dola, Chekrovolu Swuro and L. Bombayla Devi bagged the top three spots in the Olympic round of the womens recurve. 

The countrys No. 1 archer, Tarundeep Rai, disappointed most with an 11th-place finish. 

However, Rai (Army Sports Institute) is still in contention for a berth in the Indian team as he made the Super Eight with an overall 102 points, based on his performances in the first two circuits. 

I cant explain whats going wrong maybe its a mental block. Tomorrow, I will have to give my best to be among the top three, Tarundeep, who faces stiff opposition from Priyank of Uttar Pradesh in the final round on Friday, said.

 Bangladesh drop Mashud

Dhaka: Bangladesh named a 15-member squad on Tuesday for the upcoming World Cup to be held in the West Indies. 

The squad, led by Habibul Bashar, has eight specialist batsmen, chief selector Faruque Ahmed told reporters. Khaled Mashud, who featured in Bangladeshs two previous World Cup teams as wicketkeeper-batsman, has been dropped because of his poor form, Ahmed said.

Dhaka: Rahul Dravid said that Gautam Gambhirs performance at the top order would give the selectors more options and believed struggling Virender Sehwag should hit form sooner than later. 

In the two matches against Bangladesh, Sehwag has scored 30 and 21. The final game is in Chittagong. 

Part of our top-orders role is to be a bit aggressive and take a few chances. The guys have to be a bit positive and play some shots. In conditions like this and against this attack, one of the things we have discussed is being positive upfront and taking a few chances, Team India captain said Saturday. 

So some days people are going to take some chances, may be one chance too many... It may not click in the batsmans favour one day. But that is part of the strategy. 

People go up and have a role to play, sometimes it comes off and sometimes it doesnt. I am sure Veeru will carry on from his scores, he is looking good. I am sure he also realises that he must carry on like Gautam did and get a big one. 

As we have seen here, once the ball gets a bit older it gets lower and slower. The spinners come into play and run making is not that easy. So when people are given the roles to be a bit positive and take chances for the team, they do that, Dravid explained. 

If someone gets an opportunity and puts up a score like Gautam did today and wins the game by batting through in tough conditions, it gives the selectors a lot of confidence and hope. It also opens up options, he said. 

The thinktanks ploy of playing Piyush Chawla also paid dividends. As Dravid put it: After the last game we felt that an extra spinner in these conditions would be really useful. Also Sreesanths calf was a bit sore, so he was not available for selection. The natural replacement we felt in these conditions was Piyush. 

Dravid said he was confident of winning after putting up 284. I always knew Bangladesh would find it difficult given the conditions. I thought our fast bowlers bowled really well at the start and then our spinners Piyush and Ramesh (Powar) performed beautifully. 

On the fielding lapses, Dravid said: Were working hard. This has been an area of improvement for quite some time. Robins (Singh) knowledge has helped us. The results will show in the long run. 

Hoping to complete a 3-0 whitewash in the series, Dravid said the focus is on the future. We cant do anything about the past. The only thing we can do is play some good cricket in the games we have here and in the future and that is what we are focusing on. From that point of view its good to play some good cricket here. 

Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore blamed the loss of early wickets for the defeat. We need to reduce the number of mistakes. Be tougher in situations and be more competitive. We need to show the same approach as we did in the first game. 

So what has been the positives from the matches? The ability to scare a few people But we continue to present gifts in a manner not acceptable, Whatmore signed off.

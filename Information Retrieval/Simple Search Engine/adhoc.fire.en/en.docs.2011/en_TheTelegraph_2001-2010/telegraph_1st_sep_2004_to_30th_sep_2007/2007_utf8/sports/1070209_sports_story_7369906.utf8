The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Official: Gregs future hasnt been discussed

 - BCCI approach in stark contrast to that of CA 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Greg Chappell 

Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), it seems, believes in putting things on hold. 

First, contracts havent been offered afresh to the Rahul Dravids. 

Then, going by two senior officials, no thought has been given to who wears the Team India coachs hat after the World Cup. 

The Australians have, of course, chosen Tim Nielsen to succeed John Buchanan whose six-and-half-year tenure ends with the showpiece event in the West Indies. 

The settled state of affairs in Cricket Australia with everybody knowing who stands where is in stark contrast to the lets-wait-and-see approach of the BCCI. 

Till now, Greg Chappells future hasnt been discussed Weve given no thought to either retaining him or looking for a replacement, one of the officials told The Telegraph on Thursday. 

Another official said much the same thing, adding: My opinion is that the players have to be consulted before a decision is taken We dont want a dressing room which may pull in different directions. 

Chappell, who succeeded John Wright 21 months ago, had lobbed the ball in the BCCIs court when asked by this newspaper (in Cape Town) if the third and final Test versus South Africa had been his last as coach. 

Youve got to ask the BCCI, was Chappells response. 

Significantly, Team Indias first engagement after the World Cup the tour of Bangladesh is from May 7, less than ten days after the No.1 tournament ends. 

It will be bizarre, surely, if the BCCI moves on the coach-front during the World Cup.

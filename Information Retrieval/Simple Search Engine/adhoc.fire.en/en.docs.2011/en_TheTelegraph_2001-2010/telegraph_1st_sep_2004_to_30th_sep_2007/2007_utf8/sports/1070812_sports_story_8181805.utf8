 team

 - INDIA THRASH SINGAPORE 3-1 IN OLYMPIAD 

New Delhi: India thrashed Singapore 3-1 to create history by winning the title at the World Youth Chess Olympiad on Saturday. 

The Indian team comprising B. Adhiban, R. Ashwath, S. Nitin, Shyam Nikhil and Swayams Mishra won seven matches, drew two and lost one to finish on top with 28 points out of 40. 

This is Indias first-ever chess team title in any category at the world level. 

Besides the title and team gold medal, Chennai lad Adhiban remained the third best scorer among top board players. He scored 7.5 points out of possible 10. 

We were sure of a medal from this competition but the boys did well for the gold, said All India Chess Federation (AICF) secretary D.V. Sundar. 

The Indians started well defeating US 4-0 and followed it up by trouncing top seeds Hungary 3.5-0.5. The team lost 1-3 to the Philippines in the seventh round but came back to win the last three matches to romp home. 

Adhibans father Baskaran said: Top seed Hungary could overtake us for the title had they won 4-0 against Indonesia. 

Woman Fide master Irine Sukandar shocked Tamas Fodor of Hungary and it helped India. 

Hungary could thus win only by 3-1 margin and finish second with 27.5 points. 

After India defeated Hungary in the fifth round, we were certain of winning the title, Baskaran added.

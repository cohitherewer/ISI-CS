 Lords to host 1st floodlit match

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES

Lords is to host its first day-night match in September after the MCC gained permission from the local council to use temporary floodlights. Middlesexs NatWest Pro40 match against Derbyshire on September 10 will now be a floodlit game, after originally being scheduled for Southgate. 

MCC is delighted to be hosting its first floodlit match at Lords, said MCC chief executive Keith Bradshaw. We are pleased that Westminster Council has approved the use of temporary floodlights and are greatly looking forward to hosting another big occasion. 

It will be a historic day for the traditional home of cricket and could open up the possibility of floodlit ODIs in the future if successful.

Chennai: Mahesh Bhupathi feels Sania Mirza can break into the worlds top-20 with a bit of luck. 

Speaking on the sidelines of a promotional event for the Sunfeast Open to be held in Calcutta from September 17-23 Bhupathi said: She has left behind the tough times. With a bit of luck, she can crack the top-20. 

Bhupathi hoped her partnership with Sania will be a long one. Its great to have an Indian partner in the majors. Hopefully we will win a couple of Grand Slams. 

The two, pairing for the first time, lost in the second round of Wimbledon recently.

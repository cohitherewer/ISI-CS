The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Waiting to be briefed and...

 - Except Ranadeb Bose, I know everybody personally, says Chandu Borde 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Chandu Borde 

Calcutta: Till Saturday afternoon, four days after his appointment as the (cricket) manager for the forthcoming tour of Ireland, Scotland and England, Chandu Borde hadnt been able to establish contact with captain Rahul Dravid. 

Ive been in touch with the two specialist coaches (Venkatesh Prasad, Robin Singh), who conducted the camp in Bangalore I did try and speak to the captain, but he was probably busy, the Pune-based Borde told The Telegraph. 

Strangely, the former India captain, chief selector and manager is yet to be briefed by the Board. 

The chief administrative officer (Prof Ratnakar Shetty) has spoken to me Theres time Ill get the details on June 19, before the teams departure, Borde added. 

Borde, who turns 73 next month, was plucked out of nowhere after South African Graham Ford left the Board red-faced. 

Incidentally, the last time Borde had been the manager was on the 1989-90 tour of Pakistan when Krishnamachari Srikkanth was at the helm. 

Then, of course, managers largely looked after the travel arrangements and ensured there were enough balls for practice. Made the customary after-dinner speeches at official functions too. 

Today, its a different world. 

Aware that this stop-gap arrangement was continuing to get much stick, Borde pointed out that except for Bengals Ranadeb Bose, he personally knew the players picked for the ODIs in Ireland and Scotland and the Test series in England. 

Rookie Ranadeb is in the Test squad. 

 Rahul Dravid

Dont forget that not long ago, I had a hand in the selection of quite a few of them Then, Ive worked with the Rohit Sharmas on assignments given by the National Cricket Academy Its not that Ive been out of touch with the game 

Asked whether hed been mentally preparing himself for a hugely challenging two-and-a-half months, Borde replied: Well, yes But because of the suddenness of the Boards decision, Im also having to complete a lot of personal things Right now, Im meeting those commitments. 

 Hopefully, everything will be in order by the time 

 he boards the Team India (Mumbai-London) flight in the early 

 hours of Wednesday.

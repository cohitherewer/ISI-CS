 Stoppages break England momentum

 - FIRST TEST 

 Indias Day ONE performance devoid of passion 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Anil Kumble celebrates taking Andrew Strausss wicket on Thursday 

London: Two poor light-induced interruptions punctured Englands momentum, allowing India to regain some ground, otherwise the hosts wouldve taken more than a headstart on Day I of the npower series. 

When play was called off well beyond the scheduled close at Lords, due to insufficient light, England were 268 for four (80.3 overs). At the first interruption, theyd been a threatening 233 for two. 

The opening day of any series provides the best opportunity to make a statement. Often, its not forgotten till the last ball has been bowled. 

Struck by injury problems, England and Michael Vaughan couldnt have hoped for a better Day I till the interruptions, that is. The loss of two wickets (Vaughan for a smart 79 and ODI captain Paul Collingwood, who recorded his first duck in Tests) late in the day notwithstanding, England made a pretty strong statement. 

Having largely bowled badly and fielded uninspiredly Venkatesh Prasad and Robin Singh must be relieved their contracts have already been extended Rahul Dravid and Co. are bound to breathe a little easy. 

The Indians can come back strong on the second morning. Yet, on Thursday, their performance was devoid of passion. The only time it really surfaced was when former captain Sourav Ganguly effected the breakthrough by sending back Alastair Cook. 

In just 14.4 overs, Cook and Andrew Strauss smashed 76, making the huge turnout actually wonder whether theyd come through the turnstiles for a Test match or a one-dayer. 

Its a friendly attack, you know, former England coach David Lloyd told The Telegraph. 

Of the three regular mediumpacers, only Rudra Pratap Singh bowled to a plan. Or, close to one. Zaheer Khan, in particular, was a big culprit in the morning. 

Not that Dravid gave any evidence of having a plan B in place. Instead of getting his bowlers to exploit the conditions (the wicket had pace), the captain was a spectator as they got exploited. 

Within the bigger statement made by England was a smaller one from Strauss, who got one-time captain Geoffrey Boycott (whod torn into him in his preview-column) to eat his words. 

Among other things, hed written: Englands batting has problems of its own. Clearly, the biggest worry is Andrew Strauss... I was going to say his feet are all over the place, but actually its the other way around his feet dont go anywhere at all... 

I was alarmed to read a recent interview with Strauss in a cricket magazine, where hed said: Technique is such a minor part, its how youre feeling mentally that makes the difference... Well, as long as he keeps believing that, he will keep struggling at the Test level. 

Strauss, as it turned out, was the days top scorer: 96 (265 minutes, 186 balls, 16x4). He fell to Anil Kumble, but not before capitalising on a Dinesh Karthik let-off on 43. The bowler to suffer was Sreesanth. 

Besides substantially adding to his own score, his partnership with Vaughan got richer by all of 108 runs. It may turn out to be the most crucial collaboration. 

Later, Strauss said: Yes, Im disappointed at not getting a hundred, but the wicket was among the quickest Ive batted on at Lords... It wasnt easy and even a little dobbler like Ganguly became difficult... 

Sourav wont be too amused. 

Ask ed to comment on the support showered on the Indians, Strauss answered: We would like them (Asians) to back us, but we understand their roots... Were trying to win them over...

2 RECORDS BY KUMBLE 

Anil Kumble set two records on Day I of the Lords Test. He dismissed Andrew Strauss for 96 to get his 10th nervous nineties victim, thus leaving Kapil Dev behind. The leg-spinner then claimed his 139th lbw victim (Paul Collingwood) to go past Shane Warne.

The following is the list of bowlers who have got six or more nervous nineties victims:

10 mdash; Anil Kumble 

9 mdash; Kapil Dev

6 mdash; Malcolm Marshall and Muralidharan

The following is the list of bowlers with most lbw victims:

Kumble mdash; 139

Shane Warne mdash; 138

Muralidharan mdash; 133

Wasim Akram mdash; 119

* Collingwood, who had scored 1819 Test runs without scoring a duck, finally got out without opening his account on Thursday. South Afrian AB de Villiers now heads that list, having scored 1757 runs without getting a duck.

 When Kumbles arrogance fired Mortaza 

St Johns: A huge fan of Anil Kumble for his humility and dignity, Bangladesh pacer Mashrafe Mortaza says a casual statement embedded with arrogance by the leg-spinner fired him up for the World Cup encounter against India. 

Mortaza recalls a meeting with Kumble, who retired from ODI cricket on Friday, at Hotel Hilton in Port of Spain, earlier this month before the quadrennial event was to get underway. 

India and Bangladesh, alongwith Bermuda and Sri Lanka, were in group B and were based in the same hotel. It was there that Mortaza chanced upon Kumble once and struck a conversation. 

Mortaza admitted that he admired Indias highest wicket-takers tendency to shun spotlight. 

So, it came as a shock to him when Kumble casually told him that the Indians were a bit worried about not getting enough time between the World Cup and the tour to Bangladesh. 

The final of the World Cup is on April 28 while Indias tour to Bangldesh starts from May 7. 

Kumbles statement almost implied that they expected India to reach the final. He didnt say it to spite us but I was struck by the arrogance embedded in the statement. Here the tournament was still to begin and Indians were already expecting a berth in the final, Mortaza said. 

Mortaza said Kumbles comment spurred him to do well in the group match and Bangladesh stunned Indians by seven wickets. 

It certainly fired me. It was as if Bangladesh were seen just as a punching bag for big boys to move forward. I was determined to prove him wrong, recalled Mortaza.

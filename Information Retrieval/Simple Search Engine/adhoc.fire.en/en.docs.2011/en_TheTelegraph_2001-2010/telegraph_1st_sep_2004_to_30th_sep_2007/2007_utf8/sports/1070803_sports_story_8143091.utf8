 Work on basics to tide over bad patch

 Focus on the spot you want the ball to land and keep your head still at the time of delivery

 I am an opener. I cant resist the temptation to hook or pull a short delivery early in the innings. This often leads to my dismissal. Please help.

 (Mohan Das, 21, Calcutta)

 Get used to the pace and bounce of the pitch and then play the shot.

 I often get bowled while playing a yorker. Please help.

 (Varun Gupta, 11, Calcutta-9)

 Watch the ball closely and check your backlift.

 I am a right-handed batsman. I cannot judge whether a delivery is yorker or overpitched. Please help.

 (Tapan Roy, 19, Calcutta)

 You are obviously not watching the ball closely. Also make sure your head is still.

 I am a left-arm spinner. I often bowl too many wide balls. Please help.

 (Sanjit Sharma, 21, Jamshedpur)

 Focus on the spot you want the ball to land and keep your head still at the time of delivery.

 How can one improve concentration while fielding close to the wicket?

 (Ramesh Duari, 17, Calcutta)

 Work on your endurance training and expect a catch every ball.

 I am a right-arm pacer. I am going through a bad patch and not getting wickets. How can I break out from this?

 (Suresh Jain, 23, Guwahati)

 Work on the basics and be patient.

 I am a left-handed batsman. Often while offering a defensive shot to a left-arm spinner I get caught at silly point. Why does this happen?

 (Arkajit Mondal, 19, Calcutta-42)

 Get your bat in front of your pad and ensure that your weight is on the front foot with a good flex in the knee.

 I am a right-handed batsman. Please advise on the selection of ball for executing the reverse sweep.

 (Ankit Talukdar, 19, Calcutta)

 That shot will automatically come to you with experience and confidence.

 I am a medium-pacer. Should I bowl wide of the crease when bowling an inswinger?

 (Prem Jha, 21, Calcutta)

 Yes that will definitely help. With confidence you will be able to bowl it from closer as well.

 I am a right-handed batsman. I have very often been bowled by an off-break. Please help.

 (Tushar Mukherjee, 26, Calcutta)

 You are obviously playing too far away from the body and hence creating a gap between bat and pad.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Dav Whatmore 

Bangalore: Dav Whatmore, understandably, sounded

 rather dry when The Telegraph contacted him on wife Kathryns cell on

 the morning after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) struck him

 off the list which mattered. 

Whatmore, whod been tense throughout Monday, got the news from a website. 

All along, my stand was that if its going to be, then its going to be... I wish Indian cricket the very best... My good wishes will also be there with the next coach, he said. 

Whatmore was the only one to formally make himself available as a candidate to succeed Greg Chappell. Till the other day, hed been the frontrunner, but the BCCIs special committee gave weightage to Ravi Shastris opinion. 

Seen as conveying the views of captain Rahul Dravid (and, perhaps, some other players), Shastri made a strong case for former South African coach Graham Ford. Then, with Sunil Gavaskar (no fan of Whatmore) pitching for John Emburey, the Australian ended up a huge loser. 

Whatmore, by the way, clarified he hadnt said no to the Pakistan Cricket Board. I havent turned down any offer... Be it from Pakistan or elsewhere... 

Not in the mood for a lengthy conversation, Whatmore signed off by saying: Actually, right now, Im happy to be home (Bittern, near Melbourne) and my family is happy that Ill be around for a while longer... 

The Whatmores have two children daughter Alexandria and son Dav (jr).

 Hamilton races into history

 Lewis Hamilton, who came second on Sunday 

Manama: Ferraris Felipe Massa won the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sunday while McLaren rookie Lewis Hamilton roared into the record books and seized a share of the championship lead with another stunning second-place finish. 

Massas third career victory, from pole position, revived the Brazilians title challenge after a troubled start to the Formula One season. 

Yet it was Hamilton, starting on the front row for the first time, who was again the man to watch in a race that left the 22-year-old Briton in a three-way tie at the top of the standings after only his third GP. 

Runner-up for the second race in a row, after a third place in Australia, he became the first driver in the 57 years of the championship to finish his first three races on the podium. 

To have another second place in only my third race, I couldnt ask for more, said Hamilton, calm and controlled as ever in a by now familiar post-race news conference for the top three. Theres only one more step from here. I think its a fantastic achievement, another to add to my career. Im extremely proud. 

Kimi Raikkonen, winner of the season-opener in Melbourne last month, completed the top three for Ferrari with Germanys Nick Heidfeld a strong fourth for BMW Sauber his third successive fourth place. 

Double world champion Fernando Alonso, who led Hamilton in a McLaren one-two in Malaysia last weekend, was fifth after a difficult afternoon in the desert heat. 

He was leapfrogged by Raikkonen at the pitstops and overtaken by Heidfeld as he suffered a first defeat to his new teammate. 

The Spaniard, Finlands Raikkonen and Hamilton now share the overall lead after three races with 22 points apiece, although Hamilton has yet to win. (Reuters)

Calcutta: Facing East Bengal away from home is in itself a big ask. If you have to do so without your two best foreigners, the task gets even more daunting. 

Churchill Brothers dared to defy the double-handicap of missing Okoli Odafa and George Ekeh and still be positive. As a reward, the Goan outfit took home a precious point to remain unbeaten after the first four rounds of the National Football League (NFL) for the ONGC Cup. 

The 2-2 scoreline at the Barasat stadium was a fair result. The youthful and energetic Churchill side, served well by a clutch of India under-20 players, dominated the first half with some hard running and penetrative passing. East Bengal made their presence felt in the second half, going up 2-1 only to surrender the initiative with some sloppy defending. 

It was a game, which could have been Boniface Ambanis. East Bengals Kenyan striker coolly converted a penalty after 41 minutes to nullify Khantang Paites early goal and then scored a beauty 20 minutes after half-time. Unfortunately, the three-time champions let in a soft goal in the 82nd minute to spoil the Kenyans day. 

East Bengals midfield didnt cope with their fleet-footed opponents too well especially in the first session but it was their defence, which let them down on Sunday. Wing-backs Debabrata Roy and Syed Rahim Nabi faltered time and again, while even the seasoned duo of M. Suresh and Covan Lawrence were caught on the wrong foot at times. 

Take the first goal, for instance. As Naoba Singh chipped the ball to the East Bengal goalmouth, the defence froze for a second thinking that Paite was off-side. He wasnt, and had no problems trapping the ball and slotting it past Rajat Ghosh Dastidar. 

Rajat himself was to blame for Churchills late equaliser. He went up to collect a long Naoba throw-in but the ball slipped out of his grasp. MoM D. Raju playing only because the first-choice strikers werent available showed fine opportunism to ensure a point for Churchill who have six points from four games. 

It was East Bengal who created the first opportunity. Bibiano Fernandes, intercepting a ball in the middle of the park, sprinted down the middle, played a neat one-two with Alvito DCunha, delayed in transferring the ball from left to right foot and finally stabbed a weak shot which hardly tested Vinay Singh. 

Soon after, Churchill Brothers got into the scoresheet, stunning the 10,000-odd audience. Thereafter, the Goan side ruled the midfield and tested the shaky East Bengal defence. 

Drupesh Desai, the second rookie striker, beat Suresh but failed to score. Moments later, Venu Jose got a free header from a corner, but directed it straight to Rajat. Then came a significant moment, which saw East Bengal earn a providential escape. 

Raju worked his way up the right channel, cut in and aimed at goal. As the ball deflected off Rajats body, Drupesh pounced on it only to see his push strike the upright. That was in the 38th minute, three minutes before East Bengal found the equaliser. Had Churchill got that goal, there could have been a different story to narrate. 

East Bengal looked more purposeful and incisive after change of ends, especially after the introduction of Dipankar Roy and Izumi Arata. A Jayanta Sen attempt was slapped away by the custodian, a clever Arata header was deflected over the goalline. In between came Ambanis strike off a solo down the middle. Churchill Brothers did well to soak in all this pressure and still not turn defensive. In the end, their refreshing approach paid dividends.

 Woolmers coaching manual to explain science of match-fixing

Ivo Tennant 

A section examining match-fixing is to be added to the coaching manual that Bob Woolmer completed shortly before his death. It will be published in September. A scientist, Thomas C. Gilfillan, is examining the data of all the one-day matches that South Africa played in the 1990s and beyond, when they were often captained by Hansie Cronje and coached by Woolmer, to try to establish how many were manipulated. 

Gilfillan, a South African, believes that by examining the form of both sides, it is possible to predict the outcome of 70 per cent of matches and that in the remaining 30 per cent, the weaker side won. He is looking at events in these fixtures, such as bowling changes and patterns of scoring, which would arouse suspicion. 

The print-run on the book, which has been co-written by Tim Noakes, a Professor of Sports Science at Cape Town University, is to be increased from the 5,000 copies planned before Woolmers apparent murder to 100,000. 

Gilfillan will have a range of probabilities of matches fixed, Noakes, 57, who was formerly the South Africa team doctor, said. Part of the reason is to shed new light on Cronje. 

I was worried at the time by a number of suspicious things, such as when spin bowlers were brought on early in an innings. I saw things going on in the World Cup semi-final between South Africa and Australia in 1999 that I could not understand and a five-match ODI series always seemed to finish 3-2. I was convinced Cronje was a genius at manipulation and a liar. 

Noakes has spent eight years working on the book and reiterated that Woolmer has not written anything in it about match-fixing. The former Pakistan coachs widow, Gill, has given permission for the book to go ahead. Money raised will go to the Bob Woolmer Trust, on which Noakes, Barry Richards and Jonty Rhodes, the former South Africa batsmen, sit as trustees. 

We would have mentioned match-fixing if Bob and I had thought in the past there was a science about it, Noakes said. Bob was editing the original 600 pages, of which he wrote 80 per cent, a week before he died and the page proofs arrived at the Pegasus Hotel in Kingston the day after his death. So they were not the manuscripts said to have been stolen from his room. I think that was a red herring. 

Noakes last saw Woolmer, one of his closest friends, in January and was in e-mail contact with him shortly before his death.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Some shine taken off Lara 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Port of Spain: B in the game, reads a huge billboard of Brian Lara near the Queens Park Oval. A few hundred yards away near St Vincent Street, the national icon is pictured with a few kids for a promotional campaign with the promo line: Life is not a dress rehearsal, you got to live it. 

In Trinidad, he is more than a mere hero. But Sachin Tendulkar has been able to steal his popularity during his brief presence. 

At a Unicef-organised event Thursday, the Indian legend was mobbed by young and old alike. The function was widely covered in the local media with Laras my friend and theres no rivalry with Lara making the headlines. 

There were a few disappointed ones also. Disappointed for the fact that they could not catch up with the Indian hero. 

We didnt get the chance to see him the last time maan, says an attendant at the media centre. Im sure Tendulkaah will make the World Cup memorable for your team. 

If Tendulkar remains the most popular among the Indians, Sourav Ganguly is not far behind. As he stepped out after the nets on Friday, the former India captain was greeted by Colin Croft, here on a media assignment. 

His comeback has left many here stunned too, but Sourav is not reading much into the fanfare. The loss to Australia in the final in Johannesburg the last time is also a thing of past. 

Four years is a long long time I dont wish to live in the past. The memories will remain but..., he told The Telegraph. 

So how is he looking forward to this edition? Just play and enjoy. 

The renovated Queens Park Oval has left him dumbstruck. How fast things change! This stadium bears no resemblance to the one I saw the last time. The dressing rooms have changed, the stands have a new look Even the pattern of the grass has changed. Hard to believe, he exclaimed. 

Sourav though thinks the nature of the wicket will more or less be the same. 

This wicket will have bounce and carry I dont think this wicket will play lower and slower. There will be something in it for both the batsmen and the pacers, he remarked. 

The expectations can be gauged from the fact that Indias games versus Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have already been sold out. As Rahul Dravid pointed out, the atmosphere should be great. Good crowd, the typical West Indian flavour

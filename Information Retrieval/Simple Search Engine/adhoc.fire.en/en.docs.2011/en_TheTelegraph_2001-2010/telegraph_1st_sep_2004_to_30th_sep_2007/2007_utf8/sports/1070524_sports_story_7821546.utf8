Abu Dhabi: It was a farewell gift for outgoing coach Tom Moody. Mahela Jayawardene struck seven boundaries and two sixes in his 83 and Dilhara Fernando claimed three wickets on Tuesday as Sri Lanka beat Pakistan by 115 runs for a consolation win in the three-match series. 

Pakistan won the series 2-1. Sri Lanka made 296 for nine in 50 overs and then dismissed Pakistan for 181. 

Pakistan lost openers Salman Butt for two and Mohammed Hafeez for 34 and never really recovered from the early setbacks. 

Farvez Maharoof removed Butt, and Tillekeratne Dilshans direct throw dismissed Hafeez to reduce Pakistan to 61 for two. 

Fernando then struck quick blows claiming three wickets, including Mohammed Yousuf (5) and debutant Fawad Alam (0) in successive deliveries. 

Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik delayed the inevitable with a defiant 79 not out. He hit four sixes and an equal number of fours, and shared a 54-run stand for the eighth wicket with Rao Iftikhar. 

Jayawardene reached 83 off 81 balls and shared a 124-run stand for the fourth wicket with Chamara Silva, who made 64. 

Jayawardene drove spinner Abdur Rehman to the cover boundary to reach his 40th ODI half-century. He was later bowled by spinner Hafeez when trying to go for a big hit. 

Silva hit four boundaries and faced 87 deliveries before falling to Rehman. 

Openers Upul Tharanga and Sanath Jayasuriya, who returned after sitting out the second game along with pacer Lasith Malinga, gave Sri Lanka a brisk start. 

Jayasuriya was the first to depart after scoring 19 with two fours and a six when he dragged a delivery from Iftikhar on to his stumps with the total on 62. 

Iftikhar then removed Tharanga (40) and Chamara Kapugedera (15) to account for the first three wickets before Jayawardene and Silva came together to revive the innings. 

Dilshans unbeaten 28 from 14 balls, studded with three fours and a six, helped Sri Lanka post a challenging total after a middle-order collapse. 

Pakistan made five changes to the side that took an unassailable 2-0 lead. Alam and left-arm pacer Shah came in place of Abdur Razzaq and Umar Gul. 

Iftikhar came in for Mohammed Sami while Hafeez and spinner Rehman replaced opener Imran Nazir and Shahid Afridi. 

Moodys tenure came to an end and he will take over as Western Australia coach.

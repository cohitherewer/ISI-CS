Calcutta: All eyes will be on Pallabi Roy and Sukanya Dutta in the final round of the 19th The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship at Gorky Sadan on Wednesday. If both girls win their final games on Wednesday, they could make history by taking the top two places. 

Pallabi meets defending champion Bitan Banerjee and Sukanya faces Abhratanu Dutta on the two top boards on the final day. 

At the end of the 10th round, Pallabi, Bitan and Abhratanu are in a three-way lead with 8.5 points each. 

The penultimate round, however, belonged to St James Abhratanu, who outwitted top seed Shreyansh Daklia with the white pieces. Abhratanu obtained a bind on the queenside which Daklia countered by going on the offensive on the kingside. 

Abhratanu had a weak backward pawn on e3, which prompted him to offer a draw on the 39th move. But Daklia spurned the draw offer and paid for it as he lost three moves later. 

The other overnight leader, Sukanya of South Point, went down to defending champion Bitan Banerjee of Baruipur HS after a tense struggle. Sukanya opted for the queens gambit declined against Bitan, but the latter got a complete positional advantage which he converted into a win despite a time scramble in the endgame. 

Pallabi of Indira Gandhi Memorial HS made good use of the blockade against Adith Jagadish Baloors pawns to get a winning break on the kingside. 

Diptanu Das of St Augustines Day School drew against Vijay Kumar of Bihar after a hard-fought battle in the advanced variation of the Caro-Kann defence. 

The final round will start at 10 am. The prize distribution function will be held from 5 pm at the Gorky Sadan auditorium.

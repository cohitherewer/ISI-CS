 Symonds gets a new hairdo 

Melbourne: He is crickets very own David Beckham when it comes to sporting bizarre hairdos and Aussie allrounder Andrew Symonds has lived up to the reputation by getting his curly locks rolled to be in sync with the Caribbean culture during the World Cup. 

Symonds sported the new look while he did his first net practice since rupturing his right bicep. 

Being in the Caribbean is sort of a homecoming for the allrounder, who was born to West Indian parents in England in 1975 but was adopted by a family in Australia. 

The big-hitting Aussie, who got the job done by a local hairdresser at the team resort in St Vincent, said the new hairdo was cool but would be hard to keep under control. 

It can be hard to keep the yellow cap on when youre running, whereas the baggy green is a lot tighter, he was quoted as saying by a newspaper. 

Symonds has also played with his hairstyle by going completely bald or colouring his hair or wearing a wild look through his mane on previous occasions. 

Symonds, who practised with tennis balls during the brief 10-minute session, is aiming to be fit for the March 24 group match against South Africa.

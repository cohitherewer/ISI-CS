 England may sound out Donald

SIMON BRIGGS

Allan Donald, the South African fast-bowling great, is being targeted to work with England seam attack. 

In the wake of a disastrous winter for the England team, Donald has been asked by Peter Moores, the new head coach, whether he would be interested in consultancy work. 

Negotiations are at an early stage but if the relationship progresses smoothly, England bowling coach Kevin Shine may be moved sideways into a more administrative role, supervising the next generation of fast bowlers. 

Shine was appointed in March last year, but his work came under scrutiny when England fast bowlers sprayed it around like graffiti artists in Australia. 

Perhaps Donald, with his own experience of leading South Africas attack through the 1990s, may find it easier to get through to experienced Test bowlers than someone who never played international cricket.

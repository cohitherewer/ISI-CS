 Redemption time for Team India

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

 Munaf Patel during practice in Dhaka on Wednesday 

Dhaka: International sport is no longer about virtues and ethos. Its all about intense rivalry, hunger to win and pushing the bar higher. Thats what has made the Australians invincible. 

Contrast that with what Rahul Dravid said on arrival here. The scars of the World Cup defeat at the hands of Bangladesh which ultimately led to Team Indias elimination have not been erased, yet the Team India captain said revenge was not on their minds. Cricket manager Ravi Shastri did a bit of damage control by promising hard cricket. 

Remember Clive Lloyds men thrashing India in India (both Tests and ODIs) after losing the 1983 World Cup final! The Caribbean agenda was set even before they set foot on Indian soil and they played true to their words. 

It may be too much to expect such aggro from the Indians. The focus being on youth and development, the captain should have taken the initiative in instilling a positive attitude in the team. 

Dravid tried hard to protect the teams interests in the face of a sting operation carried out by a TV channel, but it remains to be seen how they perform at the Sher-e-Bangla Stadium on Thursday. It is already being seen as a new era in Indias one-day cricket. Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly have officially been rested, but Kapil Dev doesnt believe that. 

The going has been tough. Manoj Tiwary has been ruled out of the Grameenphone ODI series. Rudra Pratap Singh and Piyush Chawla will be the other two from the XV to sit out the opening game. 

There will be much interest over the Indian batting combination. It is most likely that Virender Sehwag and Robin Uthappa will open the innings. Gautam Gambhir will have to sit out in such a scenario as the thinktank cannot afford to sacrifice the allround services of Dinesh Mongia. 

If Habibul Bashar and the locals are to be believed, the newly-laid wicket is likely to help spinners. Under-prepared, is how someone closely associated with the preparations said. 

It had a dry look and its unlikely that Wednesdays intermittent rains will have any effect on the surface. There is forecast of a few spells on Thursday as well. 

We played a practice game here a few days back and the wicket played low and slow. It did turn towards the end, quot; the Bangladesh captain said Wednesday. Keeping that in mind, the hosts are likely to go in with three spinners --- Mohammed Rafik, Abdur Razzak and Saqibul Hasan. Moreover the Port of Spain experience, where their spinners kept the Indian batting on a tight leash, will spur Bangladesh to stick to such a combination. 

In such circumstances, it should be no surprise if the team winning the toss decides to bat first. 

Bangladesh also have their share of injury problems with Mashrafe Mortaza unlikely to play. Farhad Reza may take his place. 

Javed Omar is likely to open with Tamim Iqbal, who stunned India in the World Cup opener with a savage assault. Skipper Habibul Bashar, despite his poor run of scores, will bat at No. 3. The middle order will revolve around Mohammed Ashraful and Aftab Ahmed. 

Ashraful, the new vice-captain, is set to become the youngest Bangladeshi to play 100 ODIs. A lot will depend on how he performs if the hosts hope to repeat their World Cup success.

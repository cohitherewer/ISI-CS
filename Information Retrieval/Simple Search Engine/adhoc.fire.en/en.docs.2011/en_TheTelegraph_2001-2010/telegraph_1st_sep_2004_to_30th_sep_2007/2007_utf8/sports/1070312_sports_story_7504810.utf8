 Randhawa falters

Singapore: Jyoti Randhawa had another final day struggle as he missed a chance to win his first European Tour title at the Clariden Leu Singapore Masters on Sunday. 

The Indian ace, a six-time winner on the Asian Tour, stumbled on the back nine. He made bogey on the par-5 11th, followed by another dropped shot on the par-4 14th, and a double bogey on the par-3 17th signalled the end of his challenge. Eventually, he finished tied eighth with four others. 

The meet was won by Chinas Liang Wen-Chong, who parred the first play-off hole to beat Malaysias Iain Steel. (PTI)

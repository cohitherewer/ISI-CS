 Venkats request to MCA 

Mumbai: Former India captain and ICC Elite Panel umpire S. Venkatraghavan has requested the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) to earmark the seventh and final ODI between India and Australia here on October 17 as his benefit tie. 

The 62-year-old has written a letter to this effect to the MCA, headed by the BCCI chief Sharad Pawar. The matter is to come up for discussion at the associations managing committee meeting on Friday. 

The former off-spinner had played 57 Tests and captured 156 wickets besides leading India in five Tests and the first two World Cups. As an international umpire he also officiated in 73 Tests and 52 ODIs. 

Among other items on the agenda of the MCC meeting is also a letter from former India and Mumbai stumper Sameer Dighe to the association for organising a benefit tie in his favour. (PTI)

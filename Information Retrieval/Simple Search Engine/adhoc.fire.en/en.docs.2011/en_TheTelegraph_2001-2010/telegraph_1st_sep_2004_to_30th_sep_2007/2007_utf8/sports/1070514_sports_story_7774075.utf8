 Injured Sreesanth set to miss final ODI

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Chittagong: There seems to be no end to Indias injury worries on this tour. The latest addition to the list is Sreesanth. 

The pacer missed the second match of the one-day series on Saturday after failing to recover from an injury suffered while fielding during the opening tie. He could not bowl more than five overs on Thursday. 

First it was thought to be cramps. Now we believe its something more serious. The pain hasnt subsided and his movement has been restricted, a source told The Telegraph on Sunday. 

The calf muscle has been strapped and it is certain he will miss the final match as well. Sreesanth is also part of the Test squad and his fitness could affect the composition of the team. The first Test begins here on May 18. 

He was examined by a local doctor and has been prescribed a few tests. Selection committee chairman Dilip Vengsarkar and Bhupinder Singh are accompanying the team. A call on Sreesanths availability will be taken after the results of the tests are known. 

Strangely, there was no official word from the team management on his fitness. Manager Surendra Bhave wasnt available while physio John Gloster doesnt wish to communicate with the media on such issues. 

The fitness worries on this tour started with Sachin Tendulkar spraining his ankle at the conditioning camp in Calcutta. Captain Rahul Dravid then got hit on the nose. Both recovered in time but young Manoj Tiwary was forced to return following a shoulder injury in Dhaka. 

The Indians, who arrived in this port city early Sunday morning, enjoyed an off day following their series winning effort in Dhaka. They are likely to try out Robin Uthappa and Rudra Pratap Singh on Tuesday. Dinesh Mongia, who has failed to impress in the two games, may be dropped while Zaheer Khan or Munaf Patel may be rested. 

Despite the string of poor scores, Virender Sehwag enjoys the captains support. If Uthappa makes the side, he could open the innings alongside Gautam Gambhir with Sehwag dropping to the No. 3 spot. 

The wicket at the Shahid Bir Shrestha Ruhul Amin Stadium seems to be loaded with runs. The batsmen will enjoy the small periphery of the ground. The wicket earmarked for the Test match, though, is expected to retain the greenish look. 

There will be pace and bounce on the first two days and pacers will get the advantage, promised curator Saiful Alam Belal.

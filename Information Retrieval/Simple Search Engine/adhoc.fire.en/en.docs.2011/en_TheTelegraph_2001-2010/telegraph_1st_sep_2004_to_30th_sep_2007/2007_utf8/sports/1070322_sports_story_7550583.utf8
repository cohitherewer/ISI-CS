 Leboeuf stands trial 

Marseille: Former World Cup winner Franck Leboeuf and a former Marseille teammate went on trial Wednesday, accused of taking illegal transfer payments. 

Leboeuf, a former Chelsea defender who won the 1998 World Cup with France, and Argentine defender Eduardo Tuzzio face up to five years in jail and fines of euro375,000 ($477,500) if found guilty in the scam. 

Neither player attended the opening of the trial, which is expected to conclude Friday. 

The players are accused of involvement in Marseilles purchase of Tuzzio in July 2001 for euro6.4 million, a month after he was valued at euro2.2 million by his club, San Lorenzo of Argentina. 

The prosecution said Tuzzio joined Marseille via Swiss club FC Servette to falsely inflate his value and that several middlemen gained sizeable commissions as a result. 

Leboeuf is accused of receiving euro457,000 via a Luxembourg bank account, while Tuzzio is alleged to have had euro2.6 million paid into a New York account.

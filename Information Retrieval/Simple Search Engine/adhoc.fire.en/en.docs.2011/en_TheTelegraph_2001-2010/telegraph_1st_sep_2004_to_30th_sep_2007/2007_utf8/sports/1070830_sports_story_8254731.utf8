 Wasnt at my best: Sania

 Sania Mirza 

New York: Having made a winning start at the US Open, Indian tennis star Sania Mirza appeared confident of matching her best performance at the Flushing Meadows, a fourth-round appearance in 2005. 

Thats the goal. If I dont make it, itll have to be a bad match or Ill be unlucky, Sania said after surviving a first-round scare against Estonias Kaia Kanepi. 

Sania admitted that she did not play to her potential on Tuesday and felt relieved after making the next round. 

I felt a bit up and down the whole match. It wasnt the best Ive played by far but the most important thing is getting through to the next round. 

Its a fast surface and she (Kanepi) hits the ball pretty big. Its very hard to get your rhythm. 

There are not too many rallies when you play her. Finally, when there is a rally, you make a mistake because youre not used to it. 

You have to know how to turn it up when you really need to. Its the first match of a Slam. Its always hard. I knew it would be tough, the Indian said. 

If Sania manages to get past American Laura Granville in the next round, her possible third round opponent would be Russian No.6 seed Anna Chakvetadze, against whom she had lost twice last month. 

While conceding she had a mid-match wobble, Sania said the 22-year-old Kanepi lifted her game to force the final set. 

She played a lot better in the second set. She was so much more relaxed and going for it. She was hitting a lot more winners. 

Someone who plays like that, you cant keep that up for three sets. I just wanted to hang in there. In the third set, I started getting a bit more aggressive. 

The 20-year-old from Hyderabad feels she could have made the Top-20 had injury not forced her to be out of reckoning at the start of the season. (AGENCIES)

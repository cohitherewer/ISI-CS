The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ghei slips to tied 28th 

Seoul: Caught in windy conditions, Gaurav Ghei managed a two-over 74 to slip to the tied 28th spot, even as four Indians made the cut after the midway stage of $600,000 SK Telecom Open golf tournament on Friday. 

The Indian star, who has been having a great run in the last few weeks, is now three-under 141 after coming through a tough day that witnessed strong winds. 

Among other Indians, Rahil Gangjee hung on to his tied 35th place after returning his second successive card of one-under 71. He is at two-under 142, the same as Amandeep Johl, whose even par 72 saw him slipping from overnight 20th to tied 35th. 

Calcutta-pro SSP Chowrasia just squeezed inside the cut line with a one-over 73 to be even par 144 for two rounds. He was tied 61st. 

The cut came at even par and Digvijay Singh was the lone Indian to fall by the wayside with a 73. 

At the top, Korean Bae Sang-Moon added a three-under 69 to hang on to a narrow one stroke lead. 

With a total of 11-under 133, Bae holds on to a one-stroke lead over compatriot Kang Sung-Hoon. (PTI)

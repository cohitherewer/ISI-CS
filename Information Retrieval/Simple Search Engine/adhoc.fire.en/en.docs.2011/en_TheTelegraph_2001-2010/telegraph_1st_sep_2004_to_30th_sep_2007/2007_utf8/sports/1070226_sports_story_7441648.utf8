Cardiff: Striker Didier Drogba scored twice as Chelsea came from behind to beat Arsenal 2-1 in a League Cup final marred by a serious injury to England captain John Terry and an ugly late brawl that led to three red cards. 

Arsenals 17-year-old forward Theo Walcott opened the scoring in the 12th minute with his first goal for the club but Drogba levelled seven minutes later and then headed the winner in the 84th minute. 

The match was stopped twice though in the second half, with Terry being carried off on a stretcher in a neckbrace after being accidentally kicked in the face and knocked unconscious. 

A final, which had produced plenty of entertaining football, was later marred by a fracas sparked by Arsenals captain for the day Kolo Toure and Terrys replacement, Nigerian midfielder John Obi Mikel. 

Both sides were drawn into the melee, while Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho and Arsenals Arsene Wenger came onto the pitch to try and calm things down. 

Toure, Mikel and Arsenals Togo substitute Emmanuel Adebayor were all sent off as a result of the scenes, which were a far cry from the vibrant start to the game. 

Despite fielding a young side with just two first-team regulars in Toure and Cesc Fabregas, Arsenal made a remarkably assured start and twice threatened to carve Chelseas defence open before Walcott struck. 

An unused member of Englands World Cup squad, the teenager latched on to a forward ball from French midfielder Abou Diaby and steered his shot coolly past keeper Petr Cech. 

Premier League champions for the past two seasons, Chelsea hardly flinched at the setback and were soon on level terms. Germany captain Michael Ballack curled a clever pass over the offside trap and Drogb had time to tee up his shot before rifling the ball beneath the advancing keeper Manuel Almunia. 

Lampard praised in-form Drogba, telling Sky Sports: Hes special, hes the best in the world at the moment. He does it week in, week out and on the big occasions. 

Of the incident at the end he said: I came in to try to sort it out and ended up getting involved. People might say its disappointing, but when you play a cup final at this level...people moan about people not wanting to win this cup but that shows how much people wanted to win it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Different 

 teams need different coaches 

 - While the clock ticked away... 

 A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Graham Ford, the new Team India coach, 

 in Chennai on Saturday. (PTI)

 Chennai: It was around 

 2.15 pm, after some hours of sleep following an early morning 

 check in on Saturday, that Graham Ford walked into the Taj 

 Connemaras coffee shop. Can I have some salad? 

 he asked the hostess, almost in a whisper, before taking 

 a table which didnt exactly keep him in public view. 

 That was, well, typical. While waiting to be served, Ford 

 interacted with The Telegraph for about 15 minutes. 

 The following are 

 excerpts

 On 

 his thoughts

 Right now, Im trying to 

 relax... The past few days have been very hectic and Ive 

 come off a long flight...

 On being the frontrunner 

 for the Team India coachs job

 I wouldnt like to comment... 

 Its just nice that Ive been invited... Its 

 an honour... (After a pause) I dont take things 

 for granted, though... Im aware of the challenge, 

 lets wait and see.

 On arriving on the same 

 British Airways flight as challenger John Emburey

 (Grins) We didnt speak on 

 the aircraft, but did have a chat while clearing immigration 

 and customs... Johns a friend and Ive known 

 him for some years on the County circuit.

 On Emburey

 I see him as a friend... Hes 

 a very fine person and Im sure hell do a good 

 job if he gets chosen... I realise that he has played a 

 lot of international cricket (64 Tests and 61 ODIs)... 

 On having the support 

 of, among others, captain Rahul Dravid

 Its pleasing... Ive 

 always believed that the players should have a role in the 

 appointment of coaches... Dont get me wrong, this 

 is not about player-power.

 On one-time wards like 

 Shaun Pollock backing him in the strongest manner possible

 (Smiles) You know, when 

 I was asked to leave (in 2002), I left the South African 

 team with strong relationships... Shaun and the others are 

 in the same hotel and, so, I could meet them once they return 

 from the match.

 On his no-ego image

 Im a backroom person. Im 

 comfortable with that image...

 On the Pollocks being 

 unsure of whats expected of him in India

 At different times, different 

 teams need different coaches... Its important for 

 the administrators to get it right... Its critical... 

 The players, after all, are the ones whove got to 

 work with the coach.

 Finally, on whether hell 

 be able to leave Kent almost overnight

 Ive got the Countys 

 support, but we havent discussed an early release 

 from my contract which, as you know, runs till September 

 2008... Depending on what happens tonight, Ill begin 

 discussions (with Kent)... Im sure the County wont 

 stand in the way.

New Delhi: Team India skipper Rahul Dravid, who lost the race for the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna to cueist Pankaj Advani last year, has been recommended again for countrys highest sports award. 

The BCCI has also recommended middle order batsman Yuvraj Singh and former womens team captain Anjum Chopra for Arjuna awards. Incidentally, Yuvraj too was recommended for the same award last year. 

Dravid played a key role in Indias historic Test win over Australia in Adelaide in 2003-04 and also shared a marathon partnership with VVS Laxman in the 2001 Calcutta Test against Australia. 

Yuvraj, 25, has emerged as a vital cog in the Indian line-up since making a memorable debut against world champions Australia in 2000. 

Anjum, a left-handed batter from Delhi, played in 12 Tests and scored 548 runs. She also featured in 105 ODIs scoring 2465 runs. 

The Khel Ratna is given for the most spectacular and outstanding performance and it carries a cash award of Rs 5 lakh. The Arjuna award, given for good performance consistently over the previous three years, carries a cash award of Rs 3 lakh. 

Woman boxer Mary Kom and tennis Grand Slam winner Mahesh Bhupathi are the others who have been recommended for the Khel Ratna this year. 

Sachin Tendulkar is the only cricketer who has been bestowed the honour so far. 

Poulomi Ghatak, Mouma Das and Shubhajit Saha have also been recommended for the Arjuna award by the Table Tennis Federation of India.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The Telegraph picks the ones who may make an impact

M. S. Dhoni 

Indias ICC World Twenty20 captain is sure to provide the impetus with his inspiring batting. Over the past few years he has proved that he has matured a lot and is not averse to taking responsibilities. In the recently-concluded series in England Dhoni has shown that he can be swashbuckling as well as measured with the bat and secure with the gloves.The Jharkhand cricketer has already said that he needs to balance caution and aggression when it comes to leading the country. Like his batting, leadership qualities should come naturally and he would love to do things his own way. As a captain you must be in control even when things are not going your way. It helps if you keep your nerves in a tense situation and avoid doing things in a rush, he said.The team has a nice blend of youth and experience and it remains to be seen how he balances both when it comes to planning and executing strategy. But considering his track record, we can be assured that he will handle it with aplomb. 

VIRENDER SEHWAG 

If the ball is there to be hit, Virender Sehwag will have a go, whatever the situation. Having been overlooked by the national selectors after the one-day series in Bangladesh, the former vice-captain will be eager to prove that he has still got what it takes. He has already made it clear that he will not change his ways, irrespective of whether he is in the team or not.Having had the experience of playing on South African wickets, his slam-bang approach at the top of the order will go a long way in deciding Indias fortunes. Its a new format and my kind of batsmen who loathe to leave or defend a ball would definitely love it. Im waiting for it as it would allow me to just walk in and start playing my shots without bothering much, Sehwag, who led India to victory in their only Twenty20 tie, said recently.Purists may sneer at the format but Sehwag is determined to prove himself. In the absence of Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid, Sehwag, no doubt, will be Indias best bet. 

Ricky Ponting 

The captains confirmation that he will be available for the tournament means Australia will not miss his inspirational leadership on the field. He was and remains the archetypal modern cricketer: he plays all the shots with a full flourish of the bat and knows only to attack. His breathtaking fielding is also a treat to watch. A natural at one-day cricket, adjusting to the games latest format should come naturally to him.Steve Waugh believes his successor will hold the games run-scoring records when he retires. The worlds leading strokeplayer hasnt disappointed in a crisis and its only natural that the side will look forward to his consistent form. Australia have already won two World Cups under his leadership and he will aim to add another feather to his cap in South Africa. Given Australias invincibility, dare devil approach and the uncanny ability to adjust to any situation, turning Pontings dream into a reality should come easy for the men from Down Under. 

Adam Gilchrist 

He has been the symbolic heart of Australias steamrolling agenda and the most exhilarating player of the modern era. Just hit the ball, is how he once described his philosophy on batting, and he seldom strays from it. With a high-on-the-handle grip, he can destroy any attack with sublime touch and authority.He is the player who loves to strike it rich in big matches. The 2007 World Cup final in April is a recent example. Having gone through a lean patch, he silenced his critics with an amazing century (149 off 104 balls) in the final that put it beyond the Sri Lankans.With the Twenty20 game heavily loaded in favour of the batsmen, Gilchrists pyrotechnics will come in handy. Not many players since Viv Richards have displayed the same supremacy on the field. The power he generates into his strokes is awesome. His neat work behind the stumps is an added advantage. 

CHRIS GAYLE 

The tall and imposing Jamaican lefthanders attacking style has made him earn respect from the bowlers. He loves to hit through the covers and has the ability to decimate any bowler. In a lean era for West Indian cricket, Gayles pugnacious approach has become an attacking weapon in its own right. Maturing quickly, he has become a consistently prolific scorer in the ODIs. He averaged over 40 in the 2006-07 ODI season with three hundreds an unbeaten 133 against South Africa in the Champions Trophy being the highlight, and three fifties. He will be eager to make up for the disappointment in the World Cup. In the absence of the injured Ramnaresh Sarwan for their tour in 2007, Gayle was handed the captaincy for the ODI series in England and Ireland and found immediate success by beating England 2-1. 

Craig McMillan 

His style of mindless slogging suits the Twenty20 format and he can be useful with his slow mediumpace too. He is the versatile and essential bits and pieces player for this format. He was overlooked after the 2003 World Cup but worked his way back into the ODI team just in time for a call-up for the next edition of the quadrennial showpiece. After being dumped by the selectors, he began looking for other employment opportunities including as a salesman but his resolve and determination finally saw him make a comeback.He regained his place in the home series against Sri Lanka in 2006 and hasnt looked back since. He has proved to be a vital cog in New Zealands wheel and his allround capabilities has helped him book his place. 

ANDREW FLINTOFF 

That the allrounder will make it to South Africa has come as a huge relief for England who have already lost two of their players to injuries. His influence on the team is overwhelming, and this was proved again when, on return, he guided England to victory in the series decider against India at Lords.He will also be looking to make an impact after having had a disappointing World Cup in the West Indies. His ability to find the breakthroughs consistently has helped England come out of many a crisis. His batting may have faded under pressure and a troublesome knee but he is capable of coming good when needed.The young England side has shown that they have the capability to overcome mediocrity and Flintoff has the charisma and talent to lead the challenge. 

HERSCHELLE GIBBS 

He can be invincible at the crease, there is no shot thatis beyond him and his desire for explosive entertainment hasnt diminished one bit. On his day, Herschelle Gibbs can destroy any attack.The big occasion always spurs him on, as he showed in the last World Cup, hitting six sixes in an over against The Netherlands. He has psyched out the most dangerous of bowlers with his unbridled aggression and the home team will look forward to his flying starts. Dont forget his agility on the field at backward point he really is the next Jonty Rhodes.Arguably his most famous innings came in the ODI against Australia in Johannesburg when South Africa chased down an improbable 434 in 49.5 overs. Gibbs contribution was a 111-ball 175 that set the tone for the chase in what was perhaps the greatest cracker of all. 

SHAHID AFRIDI 

A flamboyant allrounder introduced to international cricket as a 16-year-old leg-spinner, he surprised everyone with his batting prowess, pinch-hitting the fastest one-day hundred in his maiden innings. Afridi is a compulsive shot-maker and this has often led to his undoing, causing him to float in and out of the team. Over the years, things though have changed for the better. A combination of maturity on and off the field has helped him blossom into an useful allrounder.Afridi is at his attacking best when forcing straight into the outfield. The biggest development has been his leg spin. His allround capabilities are completed with his agile fielding.In the Twenty20 format, his inimitable style can destroy the confidence of the most dangerous of bowlers. No doubt, he can single-handedly decide the outcome of a match with his cavalier approach destructive lofted drives and short arm jabs over mid wicket. 

SANATH JAYASURIYA 

In 1996 he gave a new dimension to one-day cricket with his lusty hitting in the first 15 overs. After more than a decade, he will be out to make his mark in the games latest format.At 38 he hasnt lost any of his bite. He can still ride roughshod over any attack in the world with his powerful cuts and pulls. His presence in the formidable Sri Lankan line-up is sure to work to their advantage in crunch situations.His allround apabilities cannot be ignored too left-arm orthodox spin and a skilful fielder inside the circle.The Sri Lankans will be once again looking up to him for that bright start from where the Mahela Jayawardenes can build the innings. His experience will also come in handy at team meetings when it comes to planning strategy on and off the field. With subcontinent sides not very conversant with this format, it will be a great challenge for the veteran.

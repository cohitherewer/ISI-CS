Calcutta: Mohun Bagan hope to get full points from their AFC Cup match against Thailands Osotpa M-150 at Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. 

Mohun Bagan held the Thailand outfit to a goalless draw away in their previous match in group E. 

Currently placed at number two in their group with five points from three matches, a win will see the city giants take the pole position. Coach Bernard Oparanozie said they would play for three points. 

For Mohun Bagan, Tomba Singh is set to play while Deepak Mondal, nursing a thigh injury, may sit out. Bernard said they would go in with a 4-4-2 combination with Bhaichung Bhutia and Jose Ramirez Barreto up front. 

Osotpa, who are placed third with four points, have come in with a relatively young batch of footballers. Coach S. Angham said: We have a squad which is full of young players. Two of them have represented Thailand national team in the Olympic qualifiers.

 Kapil didnt join ICL for money, says Vishy

 Viswanath 

Bangalore: Saddened by Kapil Devs sacking as the National Cricket Academy chairman, former Test captain G.R. Viswanath said he did not believe players such as the iconic Kapil joined the Indian Cricket League (ICL) for monetary gains. 

They are not there for money. Certainly not, Viswanath said. 

He (Kapil) wants to do this He is firm about it and backing his decision, said the former stylish batsman. 

Viswanath felt the BCCI move was hardly surprising as Kapil had been warned of the consequence of joining the ICL. 

I really feel sad. But its not an overnight decision. 

The former captain, also the vice-president of the Karnataka State Cricket Association, said the ICL is trying to become a parallel body and its success depends on the performance of players associated with it and spectator support. 

How long does the ICL sustain itself, we have to see. Certainly there is going to be a clash now (between the BCCI and ICL), he said. 

Probably it is trying to do something for the game. The problem is that the ICL is a parallel body which the BCCI probably does not approve. 

Meanwhile, former Test cricketer and KSCA secretary Brijesh Patel said ICL proponents should have sat down with BCCI officials and resolved the issue rather than floating a parallel board. 

You cant have a parallel board. Its a wrong approach. 

Patel said the legendary E.A.S. Prasanna would be sacked as spin coach at the KSCA for associating himself with the rebel league. 

He is one of the executive board members of the ICL and will have to be debarred (from the post of spin coach), Patel said on Wednesday.

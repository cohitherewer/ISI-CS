 Govt wants CA to cancel tour

Sydney: The Australian government has called on the national cricket team to cancel their planned tour of Zimbabwe for later this year. 

Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer said he would meet with Cricket Australia officials this week in the hope of persuading them to scrap the three-match tour, scheduled for September. 

My view is that the tour shouldnt go ahead, Downer told reporters on Monday. 

If it were to go ahead then Australia, which is after all the world champion, would give Zimbabwes regime and its president, who has been the patron of Zimbabwe Cricket Association, a propaganda victory, Downer said. 

We shouldnt do that this is a horrific regime in Zimbabwe and we should take a stand against it. 

The Australian government raised the prospect of cancelling the tour last month amid increased international criticism of Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe since independence from Britain in 1980 but is accused of political and human rights abuses and economic mismanagement. 

Zimbabwean cricket has been in crisis for the past few years but is still recognised by the ICC as one of only 10-Test playing nations. 

The ICC has threatened to fine countries which refused to tour the African state, but Stuart MacGill lodged a personal protest in 2004, refusing to take part in his teams tour.

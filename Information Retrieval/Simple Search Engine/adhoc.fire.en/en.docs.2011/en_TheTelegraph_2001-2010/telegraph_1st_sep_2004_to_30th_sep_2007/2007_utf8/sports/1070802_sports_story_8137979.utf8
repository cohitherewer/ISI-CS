 Perfection triumphs 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Star Perfection, the winner of last winters 1,000 Guineas, fully justified her superior rating while easily winning the 1,400m Sreepriya Cup on Wednesday.

 The Steinbeck-Santorini Star daughter was held back in third while her stablemate, Right Again, called the shots till the top of the final turn. The Daniel David-trainee took over from that stage of the race and drew away from the field, though her jockey Imran Chisty had to show her the stick to keep her going in the last furlong.

 The Super Sunrise Cup was an easy pick for a solidly fancied Wonnabee. In the same race, jockey Malcolm Maseyk was handed a month-long suspension for going easy on Big Thrillz.

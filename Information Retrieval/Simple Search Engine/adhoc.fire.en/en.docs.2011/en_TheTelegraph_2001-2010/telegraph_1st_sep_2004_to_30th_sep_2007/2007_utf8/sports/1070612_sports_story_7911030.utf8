 Figo to stay at Inter

Rome: Former Fifa World Player of the Year Luis Figo has agreed to stay with Italian champions Inter Milan next season, the Serie A club announced on Sunday. 

Luis Figo has confirmed his wish to play another season at Inter Milan and will renew his contract until June 30, 2008, read a statement on the clubs website. 

The announcement ended weeks of uncertainty over the future of the 34-year-old Portuguese midfielder. Figo, who joined Inter from Real Madrid in 2005, was expected to end his career at Saudi Arabian club Al Ittihad after signing a contract with them in January. 

A financial dispute last month, however, resulted in him pulling out of the deal. 

Inters statement added that Figo would have a long-term future at the club even after his playing career finished. (Reuters)

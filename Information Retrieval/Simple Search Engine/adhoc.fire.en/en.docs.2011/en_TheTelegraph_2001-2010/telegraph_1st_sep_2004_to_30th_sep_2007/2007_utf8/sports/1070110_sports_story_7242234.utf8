 Kapil: Lack of team spirit led to defeats 

Madurai: Former captain Kapil Dev Tuesday attributed Indias defeats in the Test and one-day series in South Africa to lack of team spirit in the side. 

Indians did not play like a team, while the other team played like a team and better too, he said interacting with the students at a school near here. 

Kapil also said a teams overall performance was important rather than individual acts of brilliance. 

Unfortunately, individual players performance gets more prominence, he said. 

Asked whether Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag should be included in the team for the World Cup, Kapil said he was neither a selector nor a coach. However, he said that if a player did not believe in himself, then he should not play. 

Players need not wait for a deadline, he said. 

Kapil also felt that the Indians should work harder on the fitness front and look more athletic like their counterparts from other countries. 

He also saw nothing wrong in employing a foreign coach. But just because India have engaged a foreign coach, it does not mean that we do not have efficient or reputed coaches in the country, he added. (PTI)

 PCB zeroes in on Dav

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has in principle decided to appoint Australian Dav Whatmore as its national team coach but will make an official announcement in a weeks time. 

Sources in the PCB said that after the interviews of the three prospective coaching candidates Whatmore, Geoff Lawson and Richard Done were conducted, Whatmore had impressed the board and players the most. 

The decision has been made in principle and details of the contract have also been discussed with Whatmore but final details are being worked out. He is expected to be paid more than what Pakistan was paying former coach, the late Bob Woolmer, one source said. (PTI)

 Pathologist: Woolmer wasnt strangled

STEWART TENDLER

A top Home Office pathologist has concluded that Bob Woolmer, the Pakistan cricket coach, was not strangled, as briefly reported in Tuesdays Late City edition. 

The statement comes amid growing belief among British and international investigators that the death was from natural causes. 

Woolmer, 58, was found dead on March 18 in his suite at the Pegasus Hotel in Kingston, the day after Pakistan crashed to a shock defeat against the minnows Ireland at the World Cup. 

A conclusion that Woolmer died from heart failure would be extremely embarrassing for the Jamaican authorities and for Mark Shields, the British police officer who is now the No. 2 in the Jamaican force. 

A full-scale murder inquiry was launched after a post-mortem in Kingston. Detectives questioned the Pakistan team amid speculation about a revenge attack by a disgusted fan or attempts by match-fixers to shut the coach up. 

But reports from the post-mortem, photographs and other material have been examined by Dr Nat Carey, who examined the bodies of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in the Soham murder case. 

The original post-mortem in Jamaica concluded that strangulation was possible because a bone on Woolmers neck had been broken. 

Sources say that Dr Carey, who also carried out the post-mortems on the five prostitutes killed in Ipswich last year, has decided the death was not from asphyxiation due to strangulation, as briefly reported. 

Earlier this month one of the Pakistan detectives, who went to Jamaica to examine the case, said the inquiry had so far proved to be inconclusive.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Hussain defends Dravids decision

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 London: 

 They didnt come to blows, but their views differed 

 so widely that David Gower had to say, Lets 

 discuss it as friends...

 That comment, during Skys 

 lunch show on Sunday, was directed at another former captain 

 Nasser Hussain.

 While Gower questioned Rahul Dravids 

 decision to not enforce the follow-on (despite a 319-run 

 lead), Hussain defended the Indian captain saying his first 

 objective was to win the series.

 The third one-time captain on 

 the show, Sir Ian Botham, didnt exactly intervene. 

 However, he said: The kind of cricket I played, Id 

 have made England follow on...

 When approached by The 

 Telegraph, yet another former captain, Graham Gooch, 

 went along with Sir Ian and Gower.

 Eventually, this is bound 

 to be a meaningless debate, but Id have made England 

 bat again... Having just been bowled out, they were on an 

 absolute low and the time was right to go for the kill...

 Also, the conditions were 

 becoming overcast... By not making England follow on, Dravid 

 gave them the hope of at least drawing the Test, Gooch 

 pointed out.

 Were waiting to hear from 

 Dravid.

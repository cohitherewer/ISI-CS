 Gibbs ready to grab the second chance, says Smith

Gros Islet: Herschelle Gibbs gets a chance to make amends for a well-documented spilled catch that led to South Africas ouster from the 1999 World Cup semi-final. 

Gibbs grassed an easy catch of former Australian captain Steve Waugh, who went on to post a match-winning century. The semi-final ended in a tie, but Australia advanced to the final as the tournament rules stipulated that the result of the previous encounter between the two teams would be taken into account. 

Waughs comment to Gibbs that he had dropped the World Cup has become an issue between the two teams. Although Waugh has retired, South Africa will get a chance to settle that score on Wednesday when the two teams meet in another World Cup semi-final. 

You talk about 99, how many guys get a second chance? South Africa captain Graeme Smith said at Beausejour Cricket Ground. Herschelles looking forward to the opportunity, I really believe hes up there for Wednesday. 

I think Herschelle is one guy Australia would fear. Hes unpredictable, has shots all around the wicket and has played well throughout the tournament... He looks very determined going into this game. 

South Africas tied semi-final encounter in 1999 was the closest any country came to stopping Australias unbeaten Cup streak that has stretched to 27 matches and featured two title triumphs. 

Since that match, the Aussies have won 21 Cup games in a row. 

By contrast, South Africa the main hosts of the 2003 World Cup were eliminated in the preliminary round that year and have never made the final. 

Smith said the missed chance and the 1999 result were not playing on his mind, even if people might be drawing parallels. 

It doesnt get mentioned much within this set-up, he said. 

We had a conference the other day to gear up the guys, with the guys who were part of that game. Even they say it wasnt such a big issue as people are making it up to be. 

The 1999 game was a game in history, an incredible game of cricket. It was obviously disappointing for South Africa as we finished on the losing side, but its a game that you learn from and move forward. 

Four members of the current South African team Gibbs, Jacques Kallis, Shaun Pollock and Mark Boucher were part of the Proteas squad who featured in that tied game. 

They are not only out to reverse that result, but atone for their 83-run loss to Australia in the group phase a month ago. 

Smith said the semi-final was a tough game, but separate to any other match. 

Whats happened before means nothing, the fact is that youre here for an important day, he said. We have the opportunity to win the game and move into the World Cup final. 

Smith said Australia were formidable rivals who had played good cricket throughout the tournament. But South Africa wanted to call the shots in this match.

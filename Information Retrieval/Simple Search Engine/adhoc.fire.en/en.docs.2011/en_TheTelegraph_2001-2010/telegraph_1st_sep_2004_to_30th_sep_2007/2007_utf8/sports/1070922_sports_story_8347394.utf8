 Chopra lying 105th 

Verona (US): Daniel Chopra turned in a one-over 73 after the first round of the Turning Stone Resort Championship on Thursday to be at 105th spot. 

The Swede of Indian origin will find it tough to make the cut unless he shoots a very low round on Day II. 

Jeff Gove and Chad Campbell each shot a seven-under 65 to tie for the first-round lead. They finished a stroke off the Atunyote Golf Club course record.

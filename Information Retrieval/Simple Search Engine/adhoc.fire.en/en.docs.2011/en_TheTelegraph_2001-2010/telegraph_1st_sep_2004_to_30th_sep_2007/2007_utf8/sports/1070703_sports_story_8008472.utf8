The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Shoaib Akhtar: 

 Ive always been misunderstood

 - The Pakistani spearhead explodes 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 A Telegraph Exclusive

Glasgow: 

 Shoaib Akhtar, 31, needs no introduction. His debut Test 

 was a decade ago, but he has only played 43 (169 wickets). 

 As for ODIs, his appearances total 133 (208 wickets). Clearly, 

 for a variety of reasons, he has been an under-achiever. 

 Hes determined to start a fresh innings, though, and 

 was candid while speaking to The Telegraph for over 

 an hour at the Hilton on Sunday evening.

 The following are 

 excerpts

 Q Youre always making 

 headlines good or bad...

 A (Laughs) Thats 

 because the media loves me... As you can see, Ive 

 lost some hair and my stubble is no longer all black... 

 The controversies have affected me... Ive had to struggle 

 to beat the odds... Ive felt the strain, yes.

 But, surely, youve helped 

 script the controversies. Why?

 I dont want to be controversial... 

 Things have happened, but Im not going to blame others. 

 Believe me, every controversy has made me a better person... 

 A stronger character...

 Even the two-year ban, which 

 got lifted, for testing positive?

 Yeah... That (October-November 

 last year) was the worst period... My own countrymen shunned 

 me, with some even refusing to look at me... It was a terrible 

 period... Everybodys body mechanism isnt the 

 same and certain levels are higher in my body compared to 

 others... My hormone level fluctuates... I didnt take 

 drugs to enhance my performance... I dont need to... 

 I dont know why I was treated so badly... The test, 

 after all, didnt show that I was an evil person... 

 That I was bad for society... Sadly, people dont try 

 to understand me. Ive always been misunderstood... 

 Ive never seen myself bigger than the game.

 Is there a secret behind your 

 mental toughness?

 No... God never gives more pain 

 than what youre able to tolerate... Whatever the controversy, 

 after the initial disappointment and anguish, Ive 

 always steeled myself and fought back... The first step 

 is hard, after that its easy... As a kid, I would 

 boast about becoming a star... I didnt know how, but 

 I never gave the impression of not knowing... I stuck to 

 my belief and the doors opened.

 You have a debonair image...

 It has been created by the media... 

 Yes, Im not married and love partying and so on, but 

 why should that be an issue if I perform on the field? Performance 

 counts, not ones image. Main koi baccha nahin hoon, 

 but I accept there are things I could have done differently.

 Are you suggesting cricket 

 is a 9 am to 5 pm job?

 Absolutely... Just change the 

 timings for the day-night games! I must be judged for what 

 I do in that period. After that, well, I should have the 

 freedom to do what I want. Im not immature to get 

 into things which will affect my career.

 Long before the doping controversy, 

 your action was deemed suspect...

 Yes... Even that was a terrible 

 period and it really hurt me... The first time (1999-2000) 

 was awful... Im always going to be thankful to Mr 

 (Jagmohan) Dalmiya, the ICC president at that point in time, 

 for his support... But, as Ive said, every controversy 

 has made me a better and a stronger person... For a while, 

 I may have felt gutted, but the controversies havent 

 killed my josh and the desire to play for Pakistan.

 Strangely, you were reluctant 

 to bowl in the second innings of the 2003-04 Rawalpindi 

 Test against India...

 Thats because Id fractured 

 a rib... I could bat because the injury wasnt a factor 

 while batting... I didnt have to use my ribs for the 

 big hits. Its only in Pakistan that fast bowlers are 

 accused of faking injuries.

 You didnt have a great 

 relationship with Inzamam-ul Haq. Did you have a problem?

 Ive never had a problem 

 with anybody... Others have had problems with me... Some 

 have this tendency to get jealous... They get insecure... 

 Im not jealous about anybody or anything... Look, 

 Im most happy when (Mohammed) Asif does well... Im 

 happy when a Brett Lee or a Shane Bond turns in a fiery 

 performance... Ive never felt insecure... Actually, 

 whoever the captain, has to understand the psyche of a fast 

 bowler.

 Was Inzamam an insecure captain?

 Ill not talk of individuals... 

 But, yes, I was devastated when I wasnt picked for 

 the West Indies after the 2004-05 tour of India. Pakistan 

 drew the Test series and won the ODIs... The message I got 

 was that I wasnt required, that the team could win 

 without me. It hurt.

 Does Inzamam have a future?

 Whether one likes him or not, 

 Inzy is Pakistans greatest batsman and must get a 

 farewell (Test) series... He shouldnt go out like 

 this... Im going to be happy if the Pakistan Cricket 

 Board gives him the chance... Its time somebody set 

 a precedent.

 You had, it appears, fundamental 

 differences with Bob Woolmer...

 It took me a year to understand 

 Bob... It probably took him quite a bit of time to understand 

 me as well... It took him time to realise that match-winners 

 are rare and they need to be looked after... We did have 

 differences, but I didnt misbehave... However, I admit 

 to a big argument with him in South Africa (earlier this 

 year), when he suspected I was faking a hamstring injury. 

 I exploded, for he had no business doubting my integrity 

 and nationalism... The next day, Bob apologised as hed 

 been misinformed about my injury... (After a pause) His 

 death left me stunned... Whats worse is that his body 

 remained in Kingston for weeks and weeks... Such indignity...

 How much of a difference does 

 a coach make at the highest level?

 Very little... The newcomers need 

 a coach, thats it. Collectively, the team needs somebody 

 to liaise with the board. Thats needed as there often 

 are many changes (within the Pakistan Cricket Board). 

 Does Shoaib Malik, the new 

 captain, have your support?

 Of course... He doesnt speak 

 too much and Im confident hell do well... Even 

 the new vice-captain, Salman (Butt), has my support... Didnt 

 you see us go out to the City Centre? Im not jealous 

 that X is the captain or Y is the vice-captain... Im 

 ambitious, but the ambitions centre around my trade... Today, 

 Im working towards bowling in excess of 100 mph... 

 Obsession or not, Im going to achieve it.

 You werent fit for the 

 last World Cup, but could you have made a difference?

 Absolutely... Id recovered 

 from the hamstring problem, but my left knee began to play 

 up.

 There were whispers that the 

 ICC could have targeted you...

 They could have, but wouldnt 

 that have been a violation of human rights? Targeting somebody 

 for dope tests...

 You dont like batsmen...

 I dont... When I come charging 

 in, the one thought is to **** them... I like being aggressive 

 and dont like batsmen who keep improving their average 

 by batting against mediocre attacks on flat wickets... Its 

 a pity that there are so few genuinely quick bowlers... 

 Batting has definitely become easy and ridiculous rules 

 such as a free hit (in ODIs) after a foot-fault no ball 

 are absurd... For Gods sake, dont discourage 

 fast bowlers. Nowadays, the big totals are thanks to a decline 

 in the quality of bowling, not because of an improvement 

 in batsmanship.

 The newer fast bowlers in Pakistan 

 are good, but not great. Is there a reason?

 Because they havent had 

 somebody to idolise... Theres no Imran Khan or Wasim 

 Akram or Waqar Younis...

 How about you?

 But I keep getting pulled down... 

 Keep being made a scapegoat... Im treated like somebody 

 on whom all the filth can be dumped... Mere upar hi sab 

 ata hai... Unless the youngsters find somebody to idolise, 

 be it a batsman or a bowler, cricket in Pakistan may die 

 in five years. Some years ago, we would be mobbed at airports 

 and traffic signals... Now, thats not the case. Cricket 

 isnt a craze and, among other things, the system needs 

 to be looked at.

 Has faith come to be an issue 

 within the team?

 Nothing must be imposed... Faith 

 is a personal thing, its between an individual and 

 Allah... Weve got to be true Muslims, yes, but nothing 

 should be thrust on somebody... People dont have to 

 be told what to do... At the end of the day, Im wholly 

 answerable to Allah, not somebody on earth. Really, the 

 bottomline is that Ive got to be honest, which I am.

 Are you more up for it when 

 the Sachin Tendulkars are in the opposition?

 No... The opposition doesnt 

 matter... Sachins a good batsman and a humble person... 

 At the same time, I havent forgotten he once called 

 me a chucker... I had to restrain myself... 

 (Virender) Sehwag said the same thing and, today, hes 

 been chucked out of the team!

 The final one: Isnt there 

 parental pressure to get married?

 Thats the wish of every 

 parent... I dont want to settle down because I wont 

 be able to give quality time to my wife... For now, cricket 

 is my priority.

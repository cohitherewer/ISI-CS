 Berdych spoils Baghdatis party

Halle: Czech Tomas Berdych beat Marcos Baghdatis 7-5, 6-4 on Sunday to spoil the Cypriots 22nd birthday party and win the Halle Open. 

Fourth seed Berdych wrapped up victory over the eighth seed in one hour 20 minutes. The win gave Berdych his third career ATP title and his first on grass. 

Berdych was in trouble just once on his serve in the first set, when Baghdatis missed two break-points in game ten. He responded to the let-off by breaking Baghdatis in the next. The Czech then served out confidently for the first set. 

Baghdatis was immediately under pressure at the start of the second, with Berdych going a break ahead with a stunning backhand down the line with his first opportunity.

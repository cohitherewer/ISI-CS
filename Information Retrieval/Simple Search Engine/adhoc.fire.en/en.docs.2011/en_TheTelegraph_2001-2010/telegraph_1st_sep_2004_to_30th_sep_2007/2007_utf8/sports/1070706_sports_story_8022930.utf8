 Sania-Mahesh bows out

Wimbledon: Sania Mirza and Mahesh Bhupathi, playing together for the first time in a Grand Slam event, bowed out of the mixed doubles at Wimbledon on Thursday. 

The Indian duo lost 4-6, 4-6 to ninth seeds Cara Black of Zimbabwe and Marcin Matkowski of Poland in the second round. 

On Wednesday, they had a 6-3, 6-4 win over David Skoch of Czech Republic and Janette Husarova of Slovakia (as reported in Thursdays Late City edition) to move into the second round. 

Indias Leander Paes and his American partner Meghan Shaughnessy moved into the third round on Wednesday. The eighth seeds beat Czech duo Jaroslav Levinsky and Renata Voracova 6-0, 6-0. 

Bhupathi, meanwhile, said: I have known Sania for some years now. Shes a quick learner and has improved a lot in recent years. We have a good understanding and we are enjoying the experience. 

All these years I had to pick a partner from another country simply because no woman was playing Grand Slam tournaments from India, continued Bhupathi, who has won the Wimbledon mixed doubles title with Frances Mary Pierce and the US Open with Slovakian Daniela Hantuchova. 

I have waited for six years (to have someone from India as partner) and I feel happy about it, he added. (PTI)

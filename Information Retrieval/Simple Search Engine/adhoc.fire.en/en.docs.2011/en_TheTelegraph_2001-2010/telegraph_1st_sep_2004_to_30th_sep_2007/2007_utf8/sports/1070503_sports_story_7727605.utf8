 Tendulkar twists ankle, may skip nets today

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Team Indias conditioning camp for the tour of Bangladesh began at the Eden on Wednesday with an injury scare to Sachin Tendulkar. 

Sachin sprained his right ankle while negotiating a bouncer from Sreesanth. 

Physio John Gloster rushed to examine him and following a brief on-field treatment, the former captain limped out of the ground. 

Administrative manager Surendra Bhave later said Sachin was given ice treatment and the injury was not serious. 

There is a bit of swelling, though it doesnt look to be serious. Gloster is treating him with ice packs, Bhave said. As of now there is no need for an X-ray. 

The physio is following it up and the extent of injury can only be known on Thursday morning, he later added. 

However, it has been learnt that as a precaution Sachin is likely to stay away from both practice sessions on Thursday. 

Sachin has been rested from the Bangladesh-bound ODI squad, but will join Team India for the two-match Test series, beginning May 18. 

Sachin came to the nets with captain Rahul Dravid and was a picture of concentration, facing both quickies and spinners during his 20 minutes at the nets. The action later shifted to the main wicket. 

He chased a wide delivery from Sreesanth and played another from Ishant Sharma uppishly towards cover. He looked short on focus but a bit aggressive during this time. 

At 3.55 pm came that rising delivery from Sreesanth. Sachins initial movement was to play it on the frontfoot, but sensing a bouncer, he quickly tried to transfer his weight on the backfoot and lost his balance. 

Grimacing in pain, he ended his batting session as Gloster attended to him. 

With ice pack strapped around his right ankle, Sachin left the stadium in the team bus. 

In another incident, Sourav Roy, one of the local nets bowlers, also received injury while fielding. His condition was fine, said a CAB official.

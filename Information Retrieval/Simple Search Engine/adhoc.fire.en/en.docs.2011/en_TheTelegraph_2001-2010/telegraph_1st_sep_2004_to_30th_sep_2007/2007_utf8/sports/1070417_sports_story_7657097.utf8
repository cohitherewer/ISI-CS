 President Kalam 

New Delhi: There were some pleasant surprises in store for Joseph Blatter when he called on President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Monday. 

Both gentlemen, the Fifa chief found out, were football fans and eager to improve the standard of the game in the country. 

Kalam, according to AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi who accompanied Blatter to Rashtrapati Bhavan left a lunch meeting to greet the Fifa chief. 

It was learnt that the President asked Blatter to arrange an India trip of four of the worlds top footballers. 

Enthusiasm for football in India will increase if you send four top players to our country, the President told Blatter. 

The Fifa boss was so impressed by the interest shown by the Indian President that he promised to look into the matter as soon as he returned to Zurich. 

He is a scientist, but has keen interest in football, Blatter remarked later. He even promised to distribute at least 10,000 footballs all over the country. 

The Prime Minister, according to Das Munshi, told the Fifa chief that his government was ready to work together with the AIFF in implementing its suggestions. 

Please give us a copy. I will take it up from the governments side, Singh was believed to have told Blatter. 

He also asked Das Munshi to form a task force to improve the Indian standard.

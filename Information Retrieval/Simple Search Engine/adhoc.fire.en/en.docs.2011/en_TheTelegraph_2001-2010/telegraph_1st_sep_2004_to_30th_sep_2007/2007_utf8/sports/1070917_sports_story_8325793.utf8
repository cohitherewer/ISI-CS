The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Twenty20 a threat: Atherton

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Michael Atherton feels Twenty20 could jeopardise more traditional forms of the game. 

So far, the first Twenty20 global competition has been everything that the World Cup in the Caribbean was not. With spectators seemingly having riotous fun and the winners to be revealed in just over a weeks time, it has looked like an event to be enjoyed, rather than a marathon to be endured. 

The appetite for Twenty20 is insatiable. While all eyes have focused on South Africa, there were two developments elsewhere which suggest that eventually Twenty20 cricket could well become the dominant form of the game. Id certainly lay a large wager that eventually 50-over cricket will be rendered extinct, the former England captain wrote in his column for The Sunday Telegraph. 

On Thursday in Delhi it was announced that a global Twenty20 tournament involving domestic teams would take place in October 2008. Meanwhile in England a little-commented-upon press release revealed that there will be a 25 per cent increase in the number of Twenty20 games next year. Whatever happened to the softly, softly approach to make sure that the concept remained fresh? Truly, when the nostrils of administrators twitch with the scent of money, they cannot but bury their snouts in the trough. 

The Delhi press conference was a hasty, if not necessarily completely thought-through, response to the Indian Cricket League... It is underpinned by a domestic Indian Twenty20 league, to be played in April 2008, and the aim is to bring together the two best domestic Twenty20 teams from India, Australia, South Africa and England to play for a $5 million purse in Abu Dhabi and Dubai six months later. New Zealand will play two teams in Australias domestic league, while Sri Lanka and Pakistan will send teams to the Indian league. Negotiations are currently ongoing with the West Indies to complete the group. 

Or should that be coup? For, while Kapil Dev was publicly sanguine about the future of the ICL in the face of this weeks developments, he must know that his breakaway group have just been dealt a death blow. 

He felt the traditional forms of the game will suffer the most. Fifty and 40-over cricket have already felt the pinch they become even less attractive to sponsors now and this will be exaggerated. 

As an enthusiastic supporter of Twenty20 from its inception, the success it has generated in such a short time in revitalising domestic cricket has been heartening. But I have always felt that Twenty20 should have remained just that a vehicle to revive domestic cricket. Fifty-over cricket and obviously Test cricket, remain vital to protecting the very essence of the game, which is a contest between batsmen and bowlers, bat and ball. Twenty20 is the equivalent of the gas chamber for a bowler. If the games future evolves entirely around Twenty20, why would any young, talented cricketer want to become one? 

Now that Twenty20 has spread to the international arena, its effects could be more wide ranging than either I, or, I suspect, its creators would wish. It is hard to see a future for 50-over cricket and if, as I do, you still love the slower rhythm and sub-plots of Test cricket, you might fear for that, too, he concluded.

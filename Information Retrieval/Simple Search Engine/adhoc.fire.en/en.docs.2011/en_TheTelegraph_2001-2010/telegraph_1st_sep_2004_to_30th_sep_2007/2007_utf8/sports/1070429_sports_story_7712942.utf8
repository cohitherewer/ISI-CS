 Players ready to adjust to a new coach: Malik

Karachi: Desperate to move on after a horrendous World Cup campaign, Pakistans new captain Shoaib Malik said the players are ready to adjust with a new coach although they would miss Bob Woolmer. 

Obviously, Bob was with us for more than three years and he has left a void. But we have to move on and the players can adjust with any new coach that the Pakistan board appoints for the team, Malik said after Pakistans week-long camp for the three-match series against Sri Lanka got underway in Lahore. 

Woolmer died on March 18 in Kingston, a day after Pakistan were beaten by Ireland and crashed out of the World Cup in the first round. 

Woolmers death remains a mystery and police in Jamaica are still trying to unravel the causes and circumstances surrounding his murder. 

The former England player and South African coach was attached with the Pakistan team from mid-2004 till his death. 

The Pakistan board has advertised the post for a national team coach and set May 15 as the deadline for submission of applications. 

Malik said the players would extend full cooperation to the new coach whenever he was appointed. 

We are also looking forward to working with the baseball coach the board is planning to appoint to work on our fielding, he said. 

Malik also dismissed reports that senior batsman Younis Khan and fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar had declined to join the camp as part of their non-cooperation with him. 

No, I dont think that is the case. Younis has prior commitments and that is why he has skipped the series against Sri Lanka. As for Shoaib, he has still not recovered from the knee injury, Malik said. 

The selectors have invited 39 probables for the camp, including fast bowler Mohammed Asif who missed the World Cup due to an elbow injury. 

Chief selector, Salahuddin Ahmed said Asifs selection depended on his fitness and the medical panel of the board clearing him to play the series. 

The selectors are expected to try out some discarded and new players against Sri Lanka in the absence of Younis and the retirement of Inzamam-ul Haq from ODIs.

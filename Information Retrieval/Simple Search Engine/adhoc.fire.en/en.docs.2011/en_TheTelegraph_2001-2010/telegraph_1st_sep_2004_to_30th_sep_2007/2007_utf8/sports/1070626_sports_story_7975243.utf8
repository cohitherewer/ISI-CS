 Dr Wallace to operate on Gloster

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Dr Andrew Wallace will operate on John Glosters fractured elbow in London. 

The physio, who injured himself during practice in Belfast, will be out of action for four to six weeks. 

According to BCCIs chief administrative officer Prof. Ratnakar Shetty, the surgery will be performed during the next few days. 

The noted orthopaedic surgeon has in the past operated on Team India cricke- ters, including Sachin Tendulkar. 

Nitin Patel will take charge during Glosters absence in Ireland and England. 

The England-based Patel is a qualified physio and has worked with the Baroda Ranji Trophy team for three years. 

Gloster will join the team after surgery and will assist Nitin. 

The BCCI, meanwhile, has granted Harbhajan Singh permission to play for Surrey.

 Mickey Mouse cricket, feels Pak manager

Karachi: Pakistan team manager Talat Ali has laughed off attempts by the Indian Cricket League to rope in Pakistani cricketers, saying ICL was nothing more than Mickey Mouse cricket and lacked potential to tempt quality players. 

I use these words because even if it is held it is not official or serious cricket. It is a rebel series not involving countries and it would be more befitting if it was held in Disneyland instead of in a Test playing nation, Ali said. 

ICLs efforts to rope in Pakistani players would not see the light of day, he claimed. I dont see this league tempting our players no matter what stage of their career they are in. 

Meanwhile, the ICC has taken a policy decision to let the BCCI independently handle the threat posed by the ICL 

According to sources in the PCB who are privy to the last ICC executive board meeting in London in June, the Indian delegation had given a complete briefing to the other members on the ICL. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Full-time coach 

 unlikely for Team India

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 ICC WORLD TWENTY20

 London: 

 Its almost certain that Team India will have 

 an interim cricket manager during the forthcoming ICC World 

 Twenty20 meet in South Africa too.

 Former captain Chandu Bordes 

 appointment is only till the England tour which ends in 

 early September. According to The Telegraphs 

 sources, given his age (he turned 73 on Saturday), somebody 

 else could get the responsibility.

 The inaugural meet begins just 

 a few days after the England tour.

 As Greg Chappell decided not to 

 seek an extension, the Rahul Dravids have been without a 

 full-time coach from after the World Cup.

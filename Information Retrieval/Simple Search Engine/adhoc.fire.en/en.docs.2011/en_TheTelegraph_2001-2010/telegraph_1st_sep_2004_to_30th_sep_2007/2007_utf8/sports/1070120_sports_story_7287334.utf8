The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Relief, as the worst is coming to an end

 - Vadodara ODI against WEST Indies may see top gun Yuvraj Singhs comeback

Calcutta: The West Indies arrival in Nagpur on Friday morning altered Team Indias practice schedule. Instead of continuing with afternoon sessions, as part of the build-up for Sundays first ODI, Rahul Dravid and Co. were given an earlier slot. 

That worked to Yuvraj Singhs benefit as he had another round of nets before boarding IndiGos evening service from there to here. 

Hes preparing for a comeback (after the nasty knee injury on October 28) and, so, such sessions are a boon. 

In fact, the more the better. 

Im feeling just fine It was important to be with the team and see if I could do the same things One worries after being forced out of the game through injury Ive come away satisfied, Yuvraj told The Telegraph during the 100-minute flight. 

Yet, understandably, the gifted southpaw is keeping fingers crossed. 

Munching cashewnuts and having the odd sip of a low calorie beverage, he added: Its a relief that this phase of poor health (starting with ear surgery earlier in the season) is coming to an end Ive gone through a tough period 

Now, Im looking to play the Twenty20 tournament (in Calcutta) with high intensity If we (Indian Airlines) win tomorrow, then I get two matches 

The injury, while playing officially-sanctioned kho-kho, couldnt have come at a worse time. 

Indeed, had Yuvraj been in South Africa, the vice-captaincy would almost surely have gone to him and not V.V.S.Laxman once the selectors decided to relieve Virender Sehwag of that responsibility. 

Now, it rests on senior-most pro Sachin Tendulkars shoulders. 

Yuvraj didnt comment on the vice-captaincy bit (he has, by the way, held that post in a stand-in capacity), but did say nothing in my life has ever come easy 

A deputy general manager with the one-time biggest domestic carrier, hes back in the city he last played in 14 months ago. 

That appearance was in a one-dayer against South Africa. 

Yuvraj top-scored with 53 (I got out to a bad shot, playing across to Johan Botha), but India still lost. 

Asked if the Twenty20 format is eventually going to upstage the other forms, he replied: Its pure entertainment, nothing more Its for the batters only 

Incidentally, Yuvrajs first exposure to Twenty20 action was in England while turning out for Yorkshire. 

Not that runs over the next couple of days will count for anything, but his intensity may help Team India physio John Gloster put a date to his comeback. 

A decision on whether Yuvraj catches up with the team in Cuttack (before the second ODI, on January 24) is expected on Sunday. 

Thats also the concluding day of the Twenty20 tournament. 

If all goes well, Yuvrajs comeback could be in the fourth and final ODI, in Vadodara, on January 31.

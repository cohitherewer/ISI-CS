 Asian crown for Tania

 Tania Sachdev 

Teheran: Grandmaster norm holder Tania Sachdev clinched the Asian womens chess championship title after settling for a draw with Chinas Ju Wenjun in the ninth and final round here. 

Tania, who turned 21 a few weeks back, tallied 6.5 points overall and qualified for the gold medal owing to a better tiebreak score than top seed Lufei Ruan of China, who had the same number of points but had to be content with silver. 

In the final round game, Ruan defeated local hopeful Atousa Pourkashiyan but it turned out to be in vain. 

The Delhi-based Tania did not have much to do in the final round game with black as Wenjun played it safe. Once the game between Nguyen Thi Thanh An of Vietnam and compatriot Le Thanh Tu ended in a draw, Tania was almost assured of the title. For the record, Nguyen claimed the bronze medal on best tiebreak score. 

I think this is my best result till date I would even say this overshadows my GM norm a bit as this was a qualification event for the world championship. There are only three seats among so many strong players, Tania said after her victory was confirmed. 

The national champion, in fact, had a forgettable outing in the just concluded Asian zonals in Bangladesh where she finished third in a field of five players. 

I guess I took my lessons well from the zonal disaster I guess I was just trying too hard for no apparent reasons there, here was a different story. I just took one game at a time without bothering much about the result, and luckily for me, the right approach clicked, Tania said. 

Women Grandmaster Nisha Mohota finished fourth after a fine last round victory over Tan Zhongyi of China. Nisha finished with six points. In the penultimate round, Tania had defeated second seed Huang Qian of China. 

Putting continuous pressure, Tania made her opponent crumble as Huang blundered a piece. 

I dont think I was too much better but her blunder came as a welcome relief for me, Tania had said after the game. 

In round eight, Nisha had failed to break the ice against Nguyen and signed peace to earn five points. This effectively ended her fight for a berth in the next world championship. 

Women GM Eesha Karavade and Aarthie Ramaswamy tasted defeat at the hands of Atousa Pourkashiyan of Iran and Tan Zhongyi of China, respectively, while Swati Ghate recovered a bit following a draw with Navabi Shirin of Iran. Amrutha Mokal also signed peace with Wang Xiaohui of China.

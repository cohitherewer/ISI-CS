The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ill always remember this hundred: Sanath 

Georgetown: Its a good thing for Sri Lanka that Sanath Jayasuriyas flirtation with retirement last year was brief. 

The 37-year-old strokemaker posted his 25th one-day International century Sunday with a vintage 115 that inspired a 113-run win over the West Indies. 

Of the 25 times Jayasuriya has posted a three-figure score in ODIs, his team has won 22 times. That makes it a staggering 88% of his hundreds coming in a winning cause. 

It was his third World Cup hundred, elevated him to No. 2 on the all-time list of ODI run-. 

Jayasuriya rated the innings among the best of his ODI centuries, saying it would be one Ill always remember. 

Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene shared a 183-run third-wicket stand with Jayasuriya and had the best view of the veteran partners 101-ball innings. 

This is one of his best hundreds, Jayawardene said. Hes a big game player. Hes done it, not just in low key tournaments, but hes done it in big tournaments under pressure. Thats why hes different. 

Jayasuriyas 18 runs off the 18th over took him past Pakistan batsman Inzamam-ul Haq as No. 2 on the ODI scoring charts behind Indias Sachin Tendulkar. He now has 11,816 and Tendulkar has 14,847 each from 384 matches. 

One thing he has over Tendulkar is a World Cup title. In 1996, he helped revolutionise the way opening batsmen approached one-day cricket. 

Even the West Indies captain Brian Lara, himself one of only seven players in the 10,000-plus club, was full of admiration for his fellow 37-year-old and was in no doubt that Jayasuriya described by commentator Barry Richards as a pocket rocket changed the course of the match. 

He was exceptional today, Lara said. At 50 for two, we were in with a chance we didnt see it coming. 

Today was a crucial day for us. Somebody had to take responsibility in the middle so I thought after I had batted for 10 overs, I should take my responsibility and bat longer, Jayasuriya said. 

It was not easy with the heat and humidity but it was a crucial game. That was in my mind to bat for a long innings and put the team in a good position to win this game. 

That he did. 

Asked if he plans to retire again any time soon, the veteran left-hander said it wasnt on his mind. At the moment, he said, Im thinking only about the World Cup. (Agencies)

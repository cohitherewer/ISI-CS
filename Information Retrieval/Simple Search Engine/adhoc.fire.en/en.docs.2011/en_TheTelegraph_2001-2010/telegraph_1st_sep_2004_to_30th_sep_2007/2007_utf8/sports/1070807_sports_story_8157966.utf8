 Jaffer: I need to convert starts into big ones

Leicester: Opener Wasim Jaffer said on Sunday he was working on being consistent to contribute more substantially to the Indian team. 

I need to convert starts into a big one. We all know how important The Oval Test is and were in the right frame of mind, Jaffer, who scored 48 and 55 to play a vital role in drawing the practice game against Sri Lanka A, said. 

Jaffer said his experience of playing in England in 2002 has helped him become wiser and mature. I was four years younger then. That tour changed me completely. I learnt quite a lot. I went back to domestic cricket and corrected whatever mistakes Id made. It made me determined to make a comeback and Im more mature now. 

Unlike other County teams, Sri Lanka A proved to be quite a handful for the Indians, giving them a tough time in the final session. 

All the A teams that tour get these games which are very important. If I would have come as an A tour player I would have taken this very seriously, Jaffer said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Diwakar passes searching test; six in lead

BIPIN SHENOY

Calcutta: Diwakar Prasad Singh once again took centrestage at the Calcutta Open Chess Tournament at Gorky Sadan on Wednesday. Acting on the complaint lodged by Chess Players Association of India, organisers Alekhine Chess Club subjected Singh to physical frisking and checking by a metal detector immediately after his game. He was also examined by an ENT surgeon for possible hidden device in his ear, but came out unscathed. 

I was asked by the organisers to examine Mr Singh for any hidden device his ear. I thoroughly examined his ear... I could see there was no device in ear. I also looked for any scars behind of inside his ear to explore the possibility of any device being implanted in his ear... I could find none, Dr Ranjan Roy Chowdhury, ENT surgeon, who examined Singh told The Telegraph. 

But the ENT surgeon did not totally rule out the possibility of any other hearing or vibrating device in any other part of his body. I only checked his ear. Even if he had anything in any other part of his body he would still need something to hear near his ear. I understand he plays with a cap all the time, which has a possibility of concealing such a device... but the best way out will be to ask him to play without his cap he said smiling. 

Singhs game once again showed brilliance of a 2700 player or a computer as he outplayed Argyadeep Das with the white pieces. 

At the end of Round VI, six players including S. Kidambi of India shared the lead with 3.5 points apiece. 

Meanwhile, Dronavalli Harika withdrew from the tournament as she was indisposed.

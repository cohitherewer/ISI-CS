 Bosses okay Irish players sojourn

Georgetown: Never mind the form and confidence of his players going into the second stage of the World Cup this week, the Irish managers big concern was that all his men could get time off from their day jobs to compete. 

Whereas the other seven teams in the Super Eight are 100 per cent professional, Irelands team boasts a farmer, a teacher, delivery drivers, a salesman and more. 

Once we had it confirmed we were through, I had to ring home to speak to all the players employers and confirm that they could give the players another month off, manager Roy Torrens said at the teams hotel in Georgetown. 

I wouldnt have liked to own the business that said no. Given the euphoria in the country at the moment regarding the cricket team and the profile that the players are getting, I would have been very surprised if any had refused. 

We were fortunate that quite a few of the players employers were actually out in Jamaica supporting the team and it wasnt a difficult question to ask. But you have to do these things and go through the proper channels.

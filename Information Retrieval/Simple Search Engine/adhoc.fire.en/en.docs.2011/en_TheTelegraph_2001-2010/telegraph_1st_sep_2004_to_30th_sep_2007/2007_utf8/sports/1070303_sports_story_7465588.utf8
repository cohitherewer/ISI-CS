 Drug-offenders have no place: Border

Melbourne: Former Australian captain Allan Border is relieved that dope-tainted pace duo of Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif are out of the World Cup, saying that the game has no place for drug offenders. 

The bottom line here is there is no room for players who take (illegal) drugs in our game, Border was quoted as saying in an Australian daily. 

Shoaib and Asif were ruled out of the mega-event after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said the pacers had failed to recover from their knee and elbow injuries, respectively. 

However, their are doubts that the duo has been left out to avoid a repeat of the doping scandal which led to their ouster from last years Champions Trophy. 

Players who have been selected from other teams for what is crickets biggest tournament are there performing to the best of their ability and on a level playing field, the former Aussie World-Cup winning captain said. 

There has been a cloud hanging over both of them for a good while. It is to be hoped that they are truly injured and that its not a repeat of their previous (drug) problem, he commented. 

Border said he was ready to accept the PCB explanation for Shaoib and Asifs ouster and hope that nothing else comes out later.

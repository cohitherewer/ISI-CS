 Europe in position of command over Asia

 - ROYAL TROPHY Im happy we lead, but its not decided yet: Ballesteros

Bangkok: Seve Ballesteros Europe team took a commanding 6 1/2 to 1 1/2 lead over Asia on Saturday after dominating the second days fourball matches at the Ryder Cup-style Royal Trophy golf tournament. 

Despite a stronger performance from Joe Ozakis Asian side, Europe won 3-1 in the fourball format to ensure it will retain the Royal Trophy it claimed at last years inaugural tournament. Europe stormed to a 3 1/2 to 1/2 lead over Asia in Fridays foursomes. The Asian team needs to win seven of Sundays eight singles matches to snatch an unlikely upset. 

It was very exciting. Asia were much stronger although Europe still got more points, said Ballesteros. I am happy we lead, but it is not decided yet as there are still eight more points in the singles. 

Ryder Cup stars Darren Clarke of Ireland and Englands Lee Westwood looked to be cruising to a win Saturday before Thai pair Thongchai Jaidee and Prom Meesawat, with six birdies, rallied to halve their match. 

Tetsuji Hiratsuka of Japan and Thailands Thaworn Wiratchant blew a three-stroke lead on the front nine to fall one down to Englands Anthony Wall and Irishman Paul McGinley. 

Ryder Cup player Robert Karlsson and fellow Swede Niclas Fasth came back from a one down to halve their match with Asian No. 1 Jeev Milkha Singh of India and South Koreas S.K. Ho. 

Karlsson drove to a foot from the pin on the par-3 17th before knocking in the birdie to even the match. 

Obviously every Asian player played better than yesterday, said Asia captain Ozaki. We had two good matches that went into the 18th hole, but the European players were strong. We had the chance to draw but we could not make it. 

Johan Edfors and Henrik Stenson of Sweden had the easiest win, establishing an early lead over South Koreas Y.E. Yang and Toru Taniguchi of Japan in their 2 and 1 win. 

Johan and I had a good day again, said Stenson. We should have won earlier but we felt tired in the last holes.

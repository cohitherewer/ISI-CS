 Ana knocks out Sania

Paris: Sania Mirzas claycourt vulnerabilities once again came to the fore as she was knocked out of the French Open by Ana Ivanovic in a second round match on Thursday. 

The 20-year-old Indian, who registered her maiden win at Roland Garros on Wednesday, was outclassed by the 19-year-old Serbian 6-1, 6-4 in one hour and five minutes. 

Sania pocketed 23,760 euros for making Round II. 

After the match, Sania said her lack of match practice she had been out of action for two and a half months after suffering a ligament injury before returning to action at the Morocco Open showed on Thursday. 

I hadnt hit a ball for nine weeks ... I felt like I had to start from scratch again, she said. I am pleased, though, because I thought it would take a lot longer to start hitting the ball right again, and clay isnt my favourite surface. 

Im realy looking forward to getting back on grass. I expect I will have an interesting few matches in Birmingham on the way to Wimbledon.

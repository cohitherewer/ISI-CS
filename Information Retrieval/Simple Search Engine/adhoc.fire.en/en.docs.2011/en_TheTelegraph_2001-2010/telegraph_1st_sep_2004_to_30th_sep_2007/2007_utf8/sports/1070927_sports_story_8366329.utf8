The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Big 3 leave the big stage for the boys

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Former captains Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid declined the Boards invitation to be present during Wednesdays felicitation of the World Twenty20-winning squad as they wanted the boys alone to enjoy their moment. 

Because the function was planned in a hurry, we only invited the Mumbai-based current and former India players and the two outstation ex-captains (Sourav, Dravid) in the squad for the first three ODIs against Australia... 

Sachin, Sourav and Dravid, however, felt the boys had done superbly and they alone deserved to enjoy the moment... That they didnt want any glory to be taken away from (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni and his players, the Boards chief administrative officer, Ratnakar Shetty, told The Telegraph. 

That sentiment wasnt shared by the politicians, though. 

Shetty confirmed that the 1983 World Cup-winning captain, Kapil Dev, wasnt invited. Thats because except Sourav and Dravid, we didnt extend invitations to anybody from outside Mumbai, he explained. 

Kapil, of course, is at loggerheads with those running the Board. 

Footnote: The ten members of the Twenty20 squad, who are also in the XV for the three ODIs, have been given a days break and can report in Bangalore (which hosts the first match, on Saturday) on Friday morning. The others must do so by Thursday afternoon.

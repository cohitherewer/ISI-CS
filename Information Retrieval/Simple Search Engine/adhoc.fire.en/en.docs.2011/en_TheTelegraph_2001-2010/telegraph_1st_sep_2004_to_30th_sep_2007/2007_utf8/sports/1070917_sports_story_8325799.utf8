 Paras eyes India job

New Delhi: Paras Mhambrey played his last Test more than a decade ago and his ODI swansong dates back to 1998. The former Mumbai captain is not sure how long it would take but hopes he can still make a comeback to the Indian team this time as coach. 

Currently in charge of the India A side, Mhambrey said, I have not set any goals for myself, the idea is to get better and better. But yes, if opportunity comes, coaching India would be a great job and will relish the challenge. (PTI)

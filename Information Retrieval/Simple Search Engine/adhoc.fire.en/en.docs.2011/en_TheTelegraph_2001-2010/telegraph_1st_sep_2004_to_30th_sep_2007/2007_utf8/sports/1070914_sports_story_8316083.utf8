 Subrata weighs the pros and cons

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Ludhiana: Mahindra Uniteds surprise progress to the Federation Cup final is a relief as well as a concern for East Bengal coach Subrata Bhattacharya. 

Relief because they wont have to face Dempo Sports Club, the strongest team in the competition. And concern since Mahindra are inarguably the fittest side in the tournament and can give any team a run for its money. 

A fit team can cause a lot of problems and I am wary of that. The Mahindra players run so hard that it can be unnerving for an any opponents, explained Bhattacharya. 

The East Bengal players and officials had a relaxed time at the Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) outlet, but there must been a lot going through the coachs mind. 

Brazilian striker Edmilson Marques will miss the final too, it was confirmed by Bhattacharya. The return to fitness of Mehrajuddin Wadao, however, lifted spirits somewhat. 

The East Bengal coach will not start with a lone striker on Saturday, like he did against Mohun Bagan the other evening. 

Going into the match with just one striker will be playing into the hands of Mahindra. We want to finish off the match within 90 minutes itself, he said. 

Opposite number Derick Pereira was planning a strategy to stifle their superior rivals. Sunil Kumar will, almost surely, take N.P. Pradeeps place in central defence while Steven Dias will be the right midfielder.

Melbourne: Firing thunderbolt deliveries through a bellowing wind, Andy Roddick punctured Roger Federers aura of invincibility to win the Kooyong Classic invitational on Saturday. 

The American swept to a 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 victory to record his first win over the world No.1 since August 2003, gaining a huge psychological boost before the Australian Open starts on Monday. 

Unfortunately Roddick will only be able to savour the memory of the rare victory over the Swiss master as the result will not count in the official records with the event being an exhibition. 

He remains 1-12 in official head-to-heads against Federer, who looked good in patches in the second set on the weekend before he begins his Australian Open title defence. 

Beating Federer was encouraging, Roddick said. But, I think it needs to be done on a big stage before you put too much emphasis on it. 

That being said, its nice to get some good preparation and feel like youre playing well going into the Aussie Open. 

Roddick had less trouble than Federer in the hot and windy conditions and dominated the first set on the back of his powerful serve. 

The 24-year-old American did not concede a point on serve between the second game of the opening set and the second game of the second set. 

He broke Federer in the fifth and seventh games and finished off on three consecutive backhand errors from the Swiss star. 

Federer rallied in the second, breaking Roddick in the second game and missing two set points at 5-2 before holding serve at love to pull even, capping the set with an ace. 

He wasted five breakpoint chances in the third and fifth games of the deciding set, but Roddick held and then made the decisive break himself to lead 5-3. He made no mistake serving out, firing back-to-back aces to get two match points and clinching it when Federer put a backhand out.

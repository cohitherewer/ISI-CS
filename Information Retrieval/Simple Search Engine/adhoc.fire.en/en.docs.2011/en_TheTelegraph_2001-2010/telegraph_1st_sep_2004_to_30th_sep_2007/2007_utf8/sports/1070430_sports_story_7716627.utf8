 Jyoti misses by a whisker in Spain

Madrid: It was a case of so near yet so far for Jyoti Randhawa, who came within a whisker of his maiden European Tour win before settling for a second place finish at the euro two million Open De Espana. 

The Indian star, who has won six times in Asia and once in Japan, played brilliantly for the last three rounds with cards of 65, 66 and 67, but found himself one short of the title as Charl Schwartzel of South Africa grabbed it with a final round of 67, ending at 16-under 272 despite a bogey. 

Randhawa was sole second at 15-under and his only blemish, a missed par putt from less than three feet on the 15th hole, proved costly. He still picked up 222,220 euros. Schwartzel bagged 333,330. 

The Indian ace started the final day behind leader Carlos Rodiles, the local favourite, who finished with 72 to be third. 

It was disappointing to miss out, but after the first day (75) I was proud to have fought like that with three good rounds, said Randhawa. 

Ultimately, it was the bogey after a brilliant 46-hole stretch that proved to be his undoing. Else he could have been in a play-off. 

It was Randhawas fifth top-10 in the 2007 European Tour season. Earlier he was ninth at HSBC, third in Hong Kong, seventh in Dubai and eighth in Singapore. 

Randhawa started the final day with a birdie on the first hole to immediately narrow the margin. 

Three birdies in a row from sixth to eighth saw him turn in four-under to be in contention. Birdies on 12th and 13th propelled him to 16-under and he jumped to sole lead. However, missing the short par putt on 15th saw him drop to 15-under, at which point Schwartzel had caught up for a share of the lead. 

As Randhawa was unable to conjure up any birdies on the last three holes, including the par-five 16th which he had triple bogeyed on the first day, he was left to wait for the others to finish to know his fate. 

Schwartzel, with three birdies on the front nine and one more on 13th came to 15-under. Then he unleashed a big drive and a superb second shot to set up an eagle attempt, which he holed and moved to 17-under with two holes to go. 

The South African then cracked a brilliant third shot to finish at 16-under.

 Pak club ready to host

 - ICL matches 

Karachi: A private and prestigious country club here, which has been a favourite hunting place for visiting cricketers including the Indians, has offered to host matches of the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL). 

An official proposal has been made by the Arabian Country Club, located out on the outskirts of Pakistans southern port city with a private cricket ground and five-star accommodation, gymnasium and other facilities for its members. 

We just want to promote cricket wherever it is played. We see nothing wrong with the ICL, Arif Ali Abbasi, chief executive of the club said. 

Abbasi, who has held several influential positions in Pakistan cricket, said the ICL people had been overjoyed at the offer but nothing was final as yet. 

If they want to come and play some matches, we will welcome them and then the mechanics of how the teams will gather in Karachi can be worked out properly, said Abbasi. 

He said the club had all the facilities required for matches of top level. 

My opinion is there is no use trying to stop anyone from organising cricket if it means promotion of the game and good money for the players, he said. 

What is wrong if the players get an opportunity to earn some extra money. It would be best if the Indian and other boards sorted out things amicably with the ICL organisers and let players enjoy the best of both worlds, Abbasi said. 

He said any resistance from the establishment to the ICL could lead to a situation developing similar to the one when Kerry Packer launched his series.

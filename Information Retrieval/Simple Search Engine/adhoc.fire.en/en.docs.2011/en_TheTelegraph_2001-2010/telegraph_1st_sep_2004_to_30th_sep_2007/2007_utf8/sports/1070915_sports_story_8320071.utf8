 Unbeaten 200s by Chopra, Badrinath

New Delhi: Aakash Chopra and S. Badrinath posted a double century each to put India A in commanding position against their South African opponents on the second day of their four-day match at Ferozshah Kotla ground here on Friday. 

Chopra made an unbeaten 239 and Badrinath scored 200 not out to propel India A to a mammoth 588 for four declared in their first innings. 

In reply, South Africa were struggling at 93 for the loss of two wickets in 26 overs at close. Opener Morne van Wyk was batting at 53 and skipper Boeta Dippenaar was at two. 

Earlier, the hosts resumed at 384 for four and overnight batsmen Chopra and Badrinath carried forward their good work to put on board 410 runs together for the fifth wicket. 

The Indian team did not lose a wicket for most of the day and continued to frustrate African bowlers to eventually declare 37 minutes before the tea break. 

Chopra, who was twice gifted life on Thursday, yet again enjoyed a dropped chance. He was given a life by spinner Justin Ontong on his own bowling when the Delhi batsman stepped out and tried to lift Ontong above his head. 

The shot did not get desired elevation, but Ontong could not hold the ball in his palms. 

Chopras 461-ball knock was aided by 19 hits to the fences and four shots over the rope. 

Badrinaths innings came off 307 balls, studded with 17 boundaries and three sixes. He got his double century by guiding the ball to mid-wicket off Hashim Amla and skipper Mohammed Kaif took no time in declaring the innings as Badrinath got the round figure. 

African openers looked confident, specially Morne, who showed his range by playing all kind of shots in the cricket book. He punished the bowlers right from the beginning as he first pulled a short delivery from Pankaj Singh and then played a cracking cover drive to take eight runs in the first over of their innings. 

Lanky pacer Ishant Sharma was erratic and helped only African cause by bowling eight no balls, in a total of nine so far, in his five overs. 

African batsmen survived the anxious moments as they successfully played five overs before the tea, scoring 19 runs. 

With pacers making no impact, Kaif introduced left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha to the attack, early in the last and rain-interrupted session of the day. 

Ojha did not disappoint his skipper and drew the first blood as he got opener Werner Coetzee caught at the first slip. 

The Hyderabadi pitched the ball on middle and leg that took sharp turn towards the off side and reached Kaifs hands after kissing the bat, ending the first wicket partnership of 55 runs. 

Hashim Amla, who walked in next departed in the 19th over, after contributing just eight runs and played 20 balls. 

Both Dippenaar and Morne ensured hosts do not add to their wicket tally, though they survived some testing deliveries from Ojha and Pankaj.

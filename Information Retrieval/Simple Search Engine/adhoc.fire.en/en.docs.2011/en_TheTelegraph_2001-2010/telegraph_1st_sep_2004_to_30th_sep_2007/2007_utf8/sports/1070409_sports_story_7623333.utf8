 Sobers, Weekes bat for under-fire captain Lara

Bridgetown: The West Indies legends Sir Garfield Sobers and Sir Everton Weekes threw their support behind under-fire captain Brian Lara on Sunday as the hosts face up to a make-or-break World Cup week. 

A legion of former players including Michael Holding, Joel Garner and Colin Croft all believe that Lara should step down as captain after the West Indies lost all three of their Super Eight matches. 

The West Indies must now win their next three matches against South Africa in Grenada on Tuesday and Bangladesh (April 19) and England (April 21) in Barbados to have any hope of making the semi-finals. 

There have always been criticisms about Lara. I dont know what people expect of him. I dont know if the people expect him to hold their (the players) hands and to take them away and make them perform, Sobers said. 

Lara, in my estimation, is still the most knowledgeable person in West Indies cricket. And Lara knows his cricket. 

He may look like a supremo as people may try to say but whenever you look around the West Indies and West Indies cricket, if you could find a man that you think is better than Lara, fair enough. 

But I dont think there is a person who has that same knowledge and that same ability as Brian Lara. 

Weekes also defended Lara. 

All of the great captains had great teams. Lara has not got a great team and I wouldnt go as far as saying that he should be fired, said the batting legend. 

Lara is still the best batsman in the side. He might not be the best captain and he is not the best captain because he hasnt got a good team. 

When you go back to all of the winning captains, youll see that theyve had very good players and great players. Unfortunately for Lara, he hasnt got any of those in his side. 

The bowling is very average, he has got a couple of good batsmen with him and thats it. 

But I think people can be a bit unfair sometimes in comparing players and teams and that sort of thing but I wouldnt be that drastic to have them all removed. (AFP)

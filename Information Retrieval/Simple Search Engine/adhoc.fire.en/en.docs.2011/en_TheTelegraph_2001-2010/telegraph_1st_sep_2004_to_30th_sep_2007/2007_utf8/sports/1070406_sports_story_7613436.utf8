 Woolmers murder may have influenced his move: Ian 

- The day after Greg said he was't available for an extension

New Delhi: Providing a new angle to Greg Chappells resignation as Team India coach, elder brother Ian on Thursday suggested that Bob Woolmers murder may have influenced the decision. 

Ian, a former Australia captain, wrote in his newspaper column that if there was any chance of his brother seeking a contract extension, it probably disappeared when Pakistan coach Woolmer was murdered during the World Cup. 

Such an ugly incident is sure to focus your concentration on lifes priorities. As much as it would seem that Greg is probably better off without all the angst that comes with one of the most demanding jobs in cricket, I doubt he will feel completely fulfilled, Ian wrote. 

A perfectionist, even one who has mellowed, is never going to be happy with under-achievement, he said. 

Ian also said that Greg had not questioned Sachin Tendulkars attitude, but had challenged him to resurrect his batting. 

Improvement doesnt come without constantly challenging yourself and also responding to the demands of your teammates, something that happened regularly in the Australian team, wrote Ian. 

Having seen Tendulkar struggle in recent times, Greg would accept it as part of his job to challenge the maestro to resurrect his batting in order to help India win matches. That is not questioning a players attitude. That is called striving for improvement. 

Ian said his brother did the right thing by asking the BCCI not to renew his contract as the job had taken a toll on his peace of mind. 

Greg is a respectful person but there is no point in trying to be like an Indian, when you have been employed because of your knowledge and experience as an Australian cricketer, he added. 

Ian said his brother always strived for the betterment of Indian cricket, but was forced to give up as no one was willing to accept the radical changes he wanted to bring about. 

Gregs only rationale for playing cricket was to win. I can guarantee that, because we had the same tutor our father Martin. Gregs approach in his latest role would have been exactly the same to do everything he could to help India win, he said. 

To see senior players just going through the motions in the field would have been enough to send Greg off on a search for young players who could field, he added. 

Ian said Gregs resignation gave an indication as to how the Indian system had failed to produce youngsters of world-class ability. 

The fact that his tenure as Indian coach was less than satisfactory for both Greg and the team, is probably a good indication that the system producing young cricketers needs more than just a bit of fine tuning, he said.

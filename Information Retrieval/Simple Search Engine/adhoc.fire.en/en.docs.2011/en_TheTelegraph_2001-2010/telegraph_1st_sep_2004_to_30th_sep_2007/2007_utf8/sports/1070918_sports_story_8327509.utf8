The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Barcelona slip further 

Madrid: Barcelona lost more ground in the title race on Sunday with a 0-0 draw at Osasuna while Sevilla showed they are the Primera Ligas form team with a 4-1 stroll past regional rivals Recreativo Huelva. 

Shorn of regular strikers Samuel Eto and Lionel Messi, Barcelona lacked penetration and now languish four points behind leaders and arch-rivals Real Madrid who have nine. 

Osasunas Javier Portillo wasted several chances including a 30-metre piledriver that Victor Valdes managed to tip over the bar. (Reuters)

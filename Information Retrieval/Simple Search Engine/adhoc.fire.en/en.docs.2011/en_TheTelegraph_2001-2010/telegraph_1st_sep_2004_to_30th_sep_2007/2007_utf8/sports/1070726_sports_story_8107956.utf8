 India U-19 make final

Mumbai: India thrashed hosts Sri Lanka by 161 runs on Wednesday to notch up their third straight victory and storm into the final of the triangular under-19 limited overs meet in Colombo. 

India won the toss and rode on a swashbuckling 63 off 67 balls from Jharkhand colt Saurabh Tiwary, whose innings included three sixes and five fours, to pile up 248. 

The Indian bowlers then went on to rout Sri Lanka for a meagre 87 in only 29.1 overs at the NCC ground to pilot their team into the Saturdays final against either the hosts or Bangladesh.

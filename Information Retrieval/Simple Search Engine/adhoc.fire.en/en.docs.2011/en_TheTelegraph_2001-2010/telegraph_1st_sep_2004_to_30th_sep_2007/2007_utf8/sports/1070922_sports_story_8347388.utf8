The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Misbah atop list of big hitters

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: One expected a flood of over boundaries in the ICC World Twenty20 meet. Well, it has rained sixes in South Africa on the first 10 days of the meet, some of those travelling far and wide at the Wanderers, Newlands and Kingsmead. 

According to an ICC release, the 23 matches played so far (the India-Scotland game was abandoned), have produced 219 sixes and 594 fours. Thanks to the technology used by broadcasters ESPN-STAR Sports, it has been possible to measure the distance covered by those big hits. 

The biggest six in the tournament has so far been struck by Misbah-ul Haq in Pakistans six-wicket victory over Australia in the Super Eight stage. Misbah smashed 66 off 42 deliveries in an innings that included seven fours and that 111-metre six. That was in Johannesburg (Wanderers). 

Justin Kemp bludgeoned one that travelled 107 metres in Durban (Kingsmead) in a game in which South Africa beat New Zealand by six wickets. 

Kemps teammate Albie Morkel features thrice in the top ten of the big hitters list. Yuvraj Singh who hit six sixes in an over against England is the only Indian to feature in the list (105m). 

The following is the list of 100m-plus sixes hit so far at the Twenty20 meet: 

 111m Misbah-ul Haq (Pak) vs Aus in Joburg 

 107m Justin Kemp (SA) vs NZ in Durban 

 106m Albie Morkel (SA) vs Eng in Cape Town 

 105m Yuvraj Singh ( Ind) vs Eng in Durban 

 105m A. Morkel (SA) vs India in Durban 

 104m Darren Maddy (Eng) vs NZ in Durban 

 103m Younis Khan (Pak) vs SL in Joburg 

 102m A. Morkel (SA) vs Eng in Cape Town 

 101m Chris Gayle (WI) vs SA in Joburg

Calcutta: Heres a poser: which woman has represented India in volleyball and shooting and the state in swimming? 

Sounds difficult? Well, the answer is Shreyasee Banerjee, a contemporary of Nafisa Ali, a mother of a junior tennis player but one, who is still in thick of sporting activities. 

In a career spanning four decades, she has had her shares of success and failures, but these have hardly quenched her appetite. 

She is aiming to be a successful volleyball coach while she has started preparing for representing Bengal in shooting in the second Indo-Bangla Games in October. 

Shreyasee used to take part both in volleyball and swimming in the 70s but took up shooting following her marriage with another international shooter Amarnath. 

My father-in-law Dr Harihar Banerjee was a two-time Olympian in shooting and he was the inspiration behind my decision to take the game seriously. Moreover, my husband was also an international shooter, Shreyasee told The Telegraph. 

Still a competitor in national-level shooting, she had represented India in the Asian volleyball championship in the 80s and won several gold medals in the national circuit. 

She has now trained eyes on becoming a volleyball coach. I have coached a state-level team. I was also Bengal manager in the national volleyball earlier this year, Shreyasee quipped. 

The multi-faceted talent continued swimming in the state level, but her main focus was on volleyball till she got married in 1987. 

My father wanted me to carry on with one discipline and so I gave up swimming, she said, revealing that her rival was the well-known Nafisa Ali.

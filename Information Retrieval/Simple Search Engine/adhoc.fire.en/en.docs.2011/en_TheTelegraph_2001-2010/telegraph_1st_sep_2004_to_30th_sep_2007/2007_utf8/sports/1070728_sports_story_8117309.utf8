The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 District voters hold the key 

 - CAB ELECTIONS 

 - Close contest on the cards for joint secretaries posts 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The build-up to the 76th annual general meeting (AGM) of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) may not have been as dramatic as ast year, but there have been some twists and turns along the way. 

If the Prasun Mukherjee backed panel had thought of having a cakewalk in the elections to the joint secretaries and treaurers posts, Jagmohan Dalmiya getting a clean chit from the Calcutta High Court has given an impetus to the opposition. 

Dalmiya is not contesting the elections and wont be present during the AGM on Saturday. But his overwhelming influence on the members cannot be ruled out. 

The war of words between the current and the former CAB presidents, following the NCCs letter to the Army, could have an impact on the voting. 

[Meanwhile, a city civil court on Friday refused to entertain an application by the Womens Cricket Association seeking voting rights in the CAB polls, saying it needs to hear the other parties. According to Our Legal Correspondent, the matter will come up for hearing next month.] 

The elections, though, are not going to be guided by individuals and their respective panels, but by personal rapport the candidates share with the members. The 119-strong electorate is hugely divided, and cross-voting cannot be ruled out. 

The 18 district votes will assume great significance. There is no official diktat this time, though the influence of a state minister may have a bearing on the outcome. 

Joint secretaries Saradindu Pal and Amitava Banerjee had won from Dalmiyas panel last year. Pal, who had polled the maximum (71) votes and continues to enjoy Dalmiyas backing, is expected to have it easy this time, too. But the same cannot be said of Banerjee, who has switched loyalty. 

I dont have any problems working with Mukherjee even if I win from a rival panel Dont forget we have a common goal, declared Pal on Friday evening. 

Veteran Samar Paul, maintaining an unusually low profile, will be hoping that his eighth attempt at the joint secretarys chair doesnt again turn futile. Biswarup Dey is banking on his Maidan boy image to make his maiden elections memorable. 

A group of members, viewed as the third front, also holds some clout. 

Given their Pal allergy and past acrimonious relationship with Paul, it will be interesting to see how their votes get divided. 

The joint secretaries posts will, no doubt, see a close fight, while Shiv Kumar Kalyani is the clear favourite for the treasurers post. Mukherjee will find it tough to get his man (Tushar Sarkar) through.

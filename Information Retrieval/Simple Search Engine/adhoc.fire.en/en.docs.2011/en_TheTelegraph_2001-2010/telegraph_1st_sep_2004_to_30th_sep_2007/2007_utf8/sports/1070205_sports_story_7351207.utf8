 Pak no match after conceding 392

 - Kallis, Boucher, Smith on the rampage 

 Jacques Kallis hits out during his unbeaten 88 in Centurion on Sunday 

Centurion: A ferocious late onslaught by Mark Boucher set up South Africas 164-run victory over Pakistan in the first ODI on Sunday. 

Boucher plundered 78 runs off 38 balls as South Africa hammered 392 for six in their 50 overs after being sent in to bat by Pakistan, who conceded their highest ODI total. 

The home attack then dismissed Pakistan for 228 in 46.4 overs for an easy victory. 

Pakistan needed to mount the second highest successful run chase in ODI history, requiring a mammoth 7.86 runs per over. And although they scored briskly, South Africa picked up wickets at regular intervals. 

A partnership of 49 off 35 balls between Mohammed Yousuf and Inzamam-ul-Haq lifted Pakistan after Makhaya Ntini plundered the top order to leave them on 70 for four. 

But Yousuf fell for 39 and Inzamam (15) was caught off Jacques Kallis in the next over to kill off Pakistans chances. 

Abdul Razzaq (6) and Rana Naved-ul Hasan (0) both fell in Kallis next over as Pakistan slumped to a sorry 125 for eight. Shoaib Malik (unbeaten 52) and Mohammad Sami, who scored a career-best 46, batted courageously and their 73-run stand brought respectability to their total. 

Earlier, Boucher launched nine fours and four sixes to propel South Africa to their huge score, taking advantage of lives on 24 and 48. 

Openers Graeme Smith (72) and AB de Villiers (67) had set South Africa on way with a first-wicket stand of 140. Captain Smith, playing his 100th ODI, scored his runs off just 47 deliveries, with 15 fours, 

Englands 363 for seven against Pakistan, in 55 overs, in Nottingham in 1992, was Pakistans previous worst one-day performance in the field.

 Zimbabwe players likely to train Down Under

Melbourne: After cancelling their Zimbabwe tour last month, Australia are likely to extend a helping hand to the cricketers from the troubled African nation by inviting them to train Down Under. 

Cricket Australia (CA) chief executive James Sutherland said they had sympathy for Zimbabwe in a cricket sense and wanted to do something for the cricketers, according to a newspaper. 

Sutherland and CA chairman Creagh Connor are likely to interact with their Zimbabwe counterparts on the sidelines of this months ICC annual conference. 

Sutherland said the entire episode had put (CA) in a really difficult position regarding public sentiment and our conscience. 

But there might be ways we can help and do something for them. Inviting young cricketers to spend time at our Centre of Excellence, perhaps, he said.

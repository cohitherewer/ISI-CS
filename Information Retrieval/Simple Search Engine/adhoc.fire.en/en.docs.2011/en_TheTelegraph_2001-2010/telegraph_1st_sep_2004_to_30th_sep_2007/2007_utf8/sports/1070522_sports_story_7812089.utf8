 Rain, bad light conspire to force a dull draw

London: England and the West Indies drew the first Test Monday with only 20 of the 98 scheduled overs bowled on the final day at Lords due to bad light and rain. 

Chris Gayle hit an unbeaten 47 and Daren Ganga 31 not out to take the West Indies to 89 for no loss at stumps, still 311 behind England after only 81 minutes were played. 

Gayle hit seven fours from 64 balls, while Ganga had four boundaries in 69 deliveries. 

The second match in the four-Test series starts Friday at Headingley in Leeds. 

The West Indies resumed on 7 for no loss, but rain stopped play only 34 minutes and eight overs later. An early lunch was taken with the West Indies on 42 for no loss. 

Gayle scooped the third ball of Steve Harmisons opening over just too high for Owais Shah at short midwicket in a lucky escape. 

But Gayle recovered and hit Liam Plunkett for consecutive boundaries, heading to lunch on 24 with Ganga on 9. 

First ball after lunch, Ganga hit Harmison for four through third man in a rare adventurous stroke, while Gayle kept attacking Plunkett with occasional success as if the Test could still be won. 

As well as playing and missing at his legcutters, Gayle flayed Plunkett for a boundary over the slips and then flat-batted the ball over mid-off to leave the seam bowler with figures of 0/48 off 11 overs. 

Monty Paneser, who took Test-best figures of six for 129 in the first innings, came on at the Nursery End seven overs after a 176-minute rain delay but couldnt break through. 

On Sunday, Panesar had earlier taken two wickets to become just the fifth England spinner to take five wickets at Lords, as the West Indies made 437. England had declared at 553 for five in its first innings on Friday.

 Dravid all praise for finisher Yuvraj

 Rahul Dravid 

Belfast: Indias 2-1 triumph over South Africa in the off-shore series has been a tale of two batsmen. 

If Sachin Tendulkar hogged the headlines at the start with his two 90-plus knocks, Yuvraj Singh put the smiles back on the Indian team by sealing victory in the last two matches. 

While the return of Sachins old brilliance, although in flashes, would have warmed the cackles of the Indian fans, to see Yuvraj play the crucial role of finisher to perfection would be a better reason to rejoice. 

And, as if symbolising the passing of the baton, the master batsman decided to share the Man-of-the-Series award with the Punjab left-hander. 

It is only because of Yuvraj that we are holding this trophy, Sachin said. 

Captain Rahul Dravid was not at a loss for words to praise Yuvraj either. 

Hes got the power, hes got the skill and hes matching that power and skill with temperament, mental strength and brains. Thats a deadly combination, Dravid said after the six-wicket win in the third and final one-dayer on Sunday. 

He has been a fantastic finisher for us. He is up there among the best one-day players in the world without a doubt. Its not an easy job to do under pressure and he does it really well. 

Sachin however played down his own vintage performance. It was a pretty good series. I played some big shots in the second match. In the first game also I played as the situation demanded. I was striking the ball well, he said. 

Next up is a full-fledged tour of England, which could be Sachins last visit to the Old Blighty. 

The England series will be a tough tour. We have got a wonderful start with this series win and the conditions here will also help us in the England tour, he said. (PTI)

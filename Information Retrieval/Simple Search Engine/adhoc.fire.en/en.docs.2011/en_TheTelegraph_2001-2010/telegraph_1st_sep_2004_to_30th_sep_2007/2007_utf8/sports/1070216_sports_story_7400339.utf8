The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sehwag likely to open again

 - Greg Chappell indicates that Goa wasnt a one-off 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Virender Sehwag 

Visakhapatnam: That Virender Sehwag opened the innings with Sourav Ganguly in the third ODI, on Wednesday, wont probably remain a one-off move. 

Theres this feeling within the group (Team India) that Sehwag is at his best and most destructive when hes at the top of the order Hes likely to open again, coach

 Greg Chappell told The Telegraph the day after. 

Sehwag, of course, was recalled for the ongoing series against Sri Lanka as a middle-order batsman. The rethink, in fact, has come just days after he got picked for the World Cup as somebody for a berth down the order. 

That Sehwag didnt get very many (only 12, all the runs via boundaries) hasnt changed the thinking in the Indian camp. 

Incidentally, with there being major fitness concerns, Chappell isnt sure about the XI that will take the field in Saturdays decider here. We want to win the series and have a psychological advantage leading into the World Cup The best available are going to play I cant, right now, be specific he remarked at the Taj Residency. 

India and Sri Lanka are in the same group (B), but Mahela Jayawardenes team has the higher seeding. 

Former Sri Lankan coach Bruce Yardley, meanwhile, has praised the team spirit being shown by the Indians. 

Speaking on board an Air Sahara flight from Mumbai to this port city (via Hyderabad), he said: The manner in which the entire team ran to congratulate Sourav Ganguly for a terrific catch (Sanath Jayasuriya off Zaheer Khan) in Goa was exceptional I hadnt seen that before in Indian teams 

While thats encouraging, fitness-related worries are definitely spoiling the script.

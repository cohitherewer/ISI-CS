 Rajesh: Need to work on accuracy

Mumbai: Rajesh Pawar, picked to play for India after a 10-year stint in first class cricket, is keen to improve his accuracy level to do well in next months tour of Bangladesh. 

I need to work on accuracy because in international cricket the fewer loose balls you bowl, the better it would be, the 27-year-old said. 

There is less margin for error playing at that level. You need to be on the mark straight away and bowl according to the plan, said Pawar who has forced his way into the Test team after claiming 36 wickets in the 2006-07 Ranji Trophy. 

Spin and bounce which I get from the wicket is my main strength. Most of the wickets on which I have played this season were flat and getting wickets on them gave me immense satisfaction, he said.

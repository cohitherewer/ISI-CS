 Its Maria vs Venus

Miami: Top seed Maria Sharapova dodged the showers on her way to a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Chinese Taipeis Chan Yung-Jan to set up a third round encounter against Venus Williams at the Miami Masters Sony Ericsson Open on Saturday. 

Sharapovas match was briefly interrupted by rain, with the players returning mid-way through the second set before the Russian world number two went on to seal the win despite 30 unforced errors in windy conditions. 

Playing in just her third tournament since last years Wimbledon, the unseeded Venus sat through a four-hour rain delay before defeating Russian Maria Kirilenko 6-3, 6-3. 

Sister Serena advanced by the same scoreline against Anastasia Rodionova. Fifth seed Martina Hingis earned a 6-3, 6-2 win over Czech Iveta Benesova, but compatriot Patty Schnyder was upset 1-6, 4-6 by world No. 56 Kaia Kanepi of Estonia.

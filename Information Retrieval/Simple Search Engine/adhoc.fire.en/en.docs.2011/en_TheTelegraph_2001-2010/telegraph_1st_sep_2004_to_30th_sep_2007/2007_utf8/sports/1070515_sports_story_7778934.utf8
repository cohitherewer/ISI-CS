 Sasi goes down to Topalov

Sofia: Former world champion Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria caught Krishnan Sasikiran on the wrong foot and handed the Indian GM his first defeat of the tournament in Round IV of the 3rd Mtel International chess tournament here. 

Overnight joint second, Sasikiran slipped to joint third place with six more rounds to go in the category-20 event. 

Having played quite well so far to get two points out of a possible three, Sasikiran could not withstand Topalovs ingenious piece-play with the black. 

In the other games of the round, Azerbaijans Shakhriyar Mamedyarov drew with former European champion Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu of Romania to remain in sole lead on three points. 

Michael Adams, after his draw with American Gata Kamsky, is sole second with 2.5 points, followed by the Sasikiran-Nisipeanu duo. Topalov is next in line a half point adrift, while Kamsky with just one point is at the bottom of the table. 

It was also a revenge of sort for Topalov who had gone down to the Indian in the Chess Olympiad. 

Playing black, Topalov employed the kings Indian defence and Sasikiran went for his pet classical set-up. 

Complexities ensued in the early middle game when Topalov went for grabbing queen side pawns with his queen and, at one point, Sasikiran completely missed the thread of the position to find the menacing black pawns marching down in his territory. The game lasted just 33 moves.

 Henry out for season

London: Arsenal and France striker Thierry Henry will miss the rest of the season because of injuries. Henry damaged groin and stomach muscles Tuesday when the Gunners were knocked out of the Champions League by PSV Eindhoven. 

He had only just returned from a foot injury. His latest injuries mean he will also miss Frances next three Euro 2008 qualifying games. 

Thierry Henry will be out for a minimum of three months, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said Friday. Unfortunately this means he will now miss the rest of this season both domestically and internationally, but we are confident that he will be ready for the start of next season. 

Henrys season has been hit by a succession of injuries. He missed games in September and the whole of December because of hamstring and sciatic injuries. After being sidelined with a foot problem in February, he returned to action as a substitute against PSV Eindhoven but appeared far from fit. (AP)

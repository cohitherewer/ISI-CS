 Clear CCTV footage a breakthrough: Police

Tim Reid in Kingston

 Bob Woolmer 

The detective leading the investigation into the murder of Bob Woolmer disclosed Wednesday night that closed-circuit television images clearly identify people entering and leaving his hotel corridor on the night he died. 

Mark Shields, Jamaicas Deputy Police Commissioner, announced last night that about 28 hours of CCTV footage from two cameras at either end of the corridor had now been digitally enhanced, and some of the people I met in the week before the murder of Bob Woolmer I could easily identify. Shields said nobody was yet a suspect, but the good quality of the CCTV images is a huge breakthrough in the murder investigation and could prove crucial. 

Shields said the next key step was to determine when the Pakistan cricket coach was attacked. Detectives were still poring over door key card records and other electronic data. I want to make absolutely sure what time Bob Woolmer died, Shields said, so that the crucial moment of footage could be narrowed down. 

He now believed that Woolmer had been killed early in the morning of the Sunday before last. The Pakistan coach retired to his room in the Jamaica Pegasus hotel at about 8 pm on Saturday, after his team had been sensationally knocked out of the World Cup by Ireland. Shields, a former Scotland Yard detective, said Woolmer had ordered room service some time between 8 pm and 9 pm on the Saturday evening, and had sent a final e-mail. 

Police were still examining his laptop and mobile phone for clues as to who killed him. 

Shields was also asked about rumours that the first post-mortem examination was botched and that Woolmer was not in fact murdered, but died of natural causes. It is very clear from the pathologists report that we are dealing with a murder investigation, he said. We will always keep an open mind, but we view this very categorically as a murder investigation. On Tuesday he also said he had evidence that pointed very clearly to murder. 

The pathologist who conducted the post-mortem examination broke his silence on Wednesday to insist that he had not bungled the examination. Ere Sheshaiah, an Indian who moved to Jamaica 12 years ago, has faced criticism from other local pathologists because he initially found the cause of death to be inconclusive. 

It was not until four days after Woolmer was found in his hotel room that police declared he had been killed by manual strangulation. Garfield Blake, head of the Jamaican Association of Clinical Pathologists, said: The final conclusion of this being a manual strangulation, I would not expect the first word to be inconclusive. 

Dr Sheshaiah, who said he had conducted more than 1,000 autopsies, said a television channel he did not believe he had made any mistakes, or reached the wrong conclusion. I did it to the best of my ability. We did our best, he said. Asked if he was confident about the job he had done, he said: Questions are always there. 

The murder has triggered febrile speculation and countless conspiracy theories. Without a shred of evidence, and despite Shields certitude of murder, one such conspiracy being whispered in cricketing circles is that Dr Sheshaiah had called Woolmers death murder to cause difficulty for the Pakistan team.

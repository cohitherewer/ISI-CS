The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sydney: Australia may lose its Grand Prix unless the event is staged in the evening, Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone told a local newspaper on Sunday. Ecclestone said that he wanted the race switched from the afternoon so it would fit in better with European television time zones. I would like to make sure we can watch (the race) in Europe and other parts of the world at a respectable time rather than having to get up at three or four in the morning, Ecclestone said.

 Melbournes current contract expires in 2010 and several countries are vying for its slot on the calendar. When the contract comes up, we have to have a look and see exactly what we will be doing with Melbourne, Ecclestone said. Unless they (organisers) can come up with something satisfactory, Im pretty sure we wouldnt be able to continue there.

 Le Mans: Australian Suzuki rider Chris Vermeulen won his first motoGP victory when he upstaged the favourites in a rain-hit French Grand Prix on Sunday. Vermeulen beat last years winner Marco Melandri of Italy on a Honda after coping perfectly with the tricky conditions on the 4.18-km Le Mans circuit. Casey Stoner of Australia steered his Ducati to third place to extend his lead at the top of the world championship standings to 21 points over Italian Valentino Rossi. Seven-time world champion Rossi, who has been struggling all weekend, finished sixth behind Spains Dani Pedrosa and Germanys Alex Hofmann.

 Apollo Bay: Kenyan David Mutua, the 2004 Honolulu Marathon runner-up, won his first international race over the distance Sunday in the Great Ocean Road Marathon. Mutua, 28, vied with last years winner James Kariuki, also of Kenya, before breaking away over the last two kms to win the race between the south-eastern Australian tourist towns of Lorne and Apollo Bay in 2 hours, 36 minutes, 35 seconds. Australian Helen Stanton won the womens marathon in 2:58.15.

 Nantes: Nantes last home match in Ligue 1 was marred by confusing scenes which symbolised the downfall of the once great club. Their penultimate match of a disastrous season, at home to Toulouse on Saturday, was heading towards a 0-0 draw when it was abandoned in the 87th minute after hundreds of angry fans had invaded the pitch. Eight-time champions Nantes, who have spent a record 44 consecutive years in the top flight, have known for weeks that they would be relegated for the first time since being promoted in 1963. I can understand why the fans are angry, said Nantes chairman Rudi Roussillon. The French professional league (LFP) will now make a ruling. It is expected to give Toulouse the points.

 Gold Coast: Former Australian Open champion Norman Von Nida, who won more than 80 titles worldwide and was a trailblazer for Australian golf, died on Sunday. He was 93. The Von, as he was known to his friends, family and those in the golfing fraternity, had been suffering from ill health in the past two months and died at a Gold Coast nursing home, his family said. Von Nida won three Australian Opens in 1950, 1952 and 1953 and four Australian PGA championships.

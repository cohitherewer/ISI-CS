 Allegation of fake tickets

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Dhaka: There have been allegations of fake tickets and complimentary passes making way to the blackmarket for Saturdays match. Overcrowding in the stands and persons with valid tickets being denied entry have been a regular feature here. 

The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) had sold tickets through a local bank for the matches against India. 

A senior BCB official said he was unaware of any such practice. 

The bank sold the tickets on our behalf. We are in no way involved in such things. If any VIP doesnt wish to see the match and sell the ticket, we cannot stop him from doing so. 

He also said that if a formal complaint is lodged the BCB will look into the incident.

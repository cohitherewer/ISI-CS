Chelmsford: The three-day match between India and England Lions ended in a tame draw here on Sunday. 

The Indians reached 91 for one in their second innings when stumps were drawn for the last time on the final day. They were chasing an improbable 258 after Andrew Strauss declared the Lions second innings closed on 227 for two. 

Dinesh Karthik, who opened with Wasim Jaffer, made 51 off 49 balls with eight fours. Jaffer remained unbeaten on 22 and Yuvraj Singh on 6. 

England Lions earlier rode two fine knocks by Strauss (80) and Owais Shah (77 not out) in the second innings. 

The Indians resumed their first innings Sunday on 336 for seven before being bowled out for 383. They thus conceded a first-innings lead of 30. 

Earlier, India were all out for 383 in their first innings. Resuming at their overnight score of 336 for seven, India were all out 40 minutes into the days play conceding a lead of 30 runs. 

Mahendra Dhoni, who resumed on 44, completed his half-century before using the long handle. He brought up his half-century with a brace off Graham Onions. 

Dhoni then opened his shoulders and hit Onions for a six over long leg. He then subjected Stuart Broad to similar treatment, hitting him over mid-wicket before straight driving him for a blazing four. The bowler had his revenge when he clean bowled Dhoni off the very next ball. The Indian wicketkeeper made 76 off 84 balls and hit seven boundaries and two sixes. 

Broad picked up five for 76 while Onions took three for 90. 

When Lions batted a second time, captain Strauss who was dismissed cheaply in the first innings got some useful practice in the afternoon session. 

Strauss batted confidently for his knock of 80 before he was out trying to sweep Ramesh Powar only to drag the ball on to his stumps. Strauss faced 103 balls and hit 14 fours. He put on 60 runs in an opening partnership with Joe Denly. 

However, unlike in the first innings, Denly couldnt do much damage to the Indian bowling as he fell early to Zaheer Khan for just 18. 

Shah then joined Strauss and batted confidently. They put on 80 runs before Strauss, played on.

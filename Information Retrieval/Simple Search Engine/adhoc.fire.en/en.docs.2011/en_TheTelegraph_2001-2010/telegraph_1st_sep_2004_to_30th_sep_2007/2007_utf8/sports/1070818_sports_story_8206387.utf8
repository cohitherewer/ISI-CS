 India pump in six past Cambodia

 - Chhetri, Dias net 2 each in Nehru Cup opener

 New Delhi: To say it was 

 a moment of glory for Indian football would be an exaggeration, 

 but for the sparse crowd at the floodlit Ambedkar Stadium 

 on Friday it was an evening to remember.

 Rarely do Indian football fans 

 get an opportunity to watch the national team win by half 

 a dozen goals, as they did in the inaugural fixture of the 

 ONGC Nehru Cup. So what if the opponents Cambodia are 

 no great shakes and No. 170 in the Fifa rankings. 

 Truth to tell, none had any inkling 

 of what Bob Houghtons men, ranked 162, had in store 

 for the visitors.

 The Cambodians looked a compact 

 side for the first quarter of an hour. India, on the other 

 hand, were rusty and there was some tension in the stands 

 as Indian goalkeeper Subrata Pal had to leave charge thrice 

 to thwart Cambodias attacking duo.

 But once the Indian midfielders 

 managed to get a hold over proceedings, the floodgates opened. 

 The Cambodians capitulated in the face of constant onslaughts 

 and caved in to concede two goals before half-time. 

 A patchy display by skipper Bhaichung 

 Bhutia was Indias biggest problem. The midfielders 

 especially Pradeep and Dias fed the forwardline regularly, 

 but a lack of combination between Chhetri and Bhaichung 

 proved to be the stumbling block. No wonder, even the generally 

 composed Houghton looked a worried man. 

 It was left to Pradeep to take 

 the initiative and break the deadlock. His 30-yard right-footer 

 hit bulls eye. It was a beauty, but didnt surprise 

 those who have watched the Kerala boy closely in the last 

 two seasons. 

 Bhaichung scored the second goal 

 off a penalty after he was brought down inside the box by 

 goalkeeper Oum Veasna.

 India could have doubled the tally 

 before the change of ends, but the post came in the way 

 of Rennedy Singh and Bhaichung.

 It was a pity that only a couple 

 of thousand fans were in the stands to watch India produce 

 a superlative display in the second half. The Indian coachs 

 move to effect two changes in the 71st minute Abhishek 

 Yadav and Clifford Miranda replacing the ageing Bhaichung 

 and Rennedy worked wonders. 

 In the last 15 minutes, India 

 struck four times with Chhetri and Dias netting two each.

 The third goal in the 73rd minute 

 by Man-of-the-Match Dias changed the games complexion. 

 Once that angular shot beat Veasna all ends up, the visitors 

 gave it up completely.

 But Houghton was not satisfied. 

 He was seen directing his attackers to press for more. Chhetri 

 cut past two to score the fourth goal. Within minutes, the 

 pint-sized local player struck again to the delight of the 

 crowd.

 Chhetri could have completed his 

 hattrick two minutes later, but delayed in taking the shot. 

 For once the Cambodians marked him right. But they had no 

 answer for when Dias bulged the net a minute before the 

 final whistle. 

 Winning is a habit, 

 Houghton had said on Thursday. A team which has got 

 into the habit of winning can score many in the last 15 

 minutes.

 It didnt take more than 

 24 hours to find out how right Houghton was. TEAMS

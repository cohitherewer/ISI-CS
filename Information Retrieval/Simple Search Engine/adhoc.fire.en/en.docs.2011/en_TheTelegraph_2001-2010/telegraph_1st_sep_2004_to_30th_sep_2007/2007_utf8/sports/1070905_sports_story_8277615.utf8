The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Vasco go down 1-3

Ludhiana: Four strikes, a red card and an own goal marked an eventful opening match of the 29th Federation Cup as JCT outclassed Vasco Sports Club 3-1 to advance to the quarter finals here on Tuesday. 

Goals for JCT came through Brazilians Eduardo Da Escobar (5th minute), Marcos Pereira (45th) and an own goal from Robert Fernandes (75th) as the team from Punjab dominated proceedings at the Guru Nanak Stadium. 

The victory margin could have been bigger had JCT taken all their chances and Juze Siddhi in the Vasco goal not made some good saves.

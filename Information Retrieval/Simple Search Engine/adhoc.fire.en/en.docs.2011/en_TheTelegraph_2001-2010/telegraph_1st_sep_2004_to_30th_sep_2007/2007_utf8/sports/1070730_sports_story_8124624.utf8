 India finish with a draw 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: India ended their preparatory tour in Portugal on an unbeaten note when they drew goalless with third division Portuguese side GDR Mosanto on Sunday. India won two of their four matches in Portugal and drew the other two. 

According to information received here, India, who were without skipper Bhaichung Bhutia, could have won the match with a little luck. 

Tarif Ahmed, who started with Sunil Chetri in the forwardline, had a couple of good chances but failed to capitalise on them. Manjit Singh and N.S. Manju also missed clear openings.

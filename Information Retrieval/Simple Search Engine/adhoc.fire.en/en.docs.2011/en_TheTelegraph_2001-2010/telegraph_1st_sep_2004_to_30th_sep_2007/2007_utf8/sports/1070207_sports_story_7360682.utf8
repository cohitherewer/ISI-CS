OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: If the Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) is to be believed, then former top Swedish star Peter Karlsson could take charge as Indias national coach before the World Championships in Croatia in May. 

Speaking to The Telegraph on Tuesday, TTFI secretary M.C. Chowhan said that talks are on with the famous Swedish paddler. 

In the next couple of weeks, I shall have another round of talks with him to finalise the deal, Chowhan said. 

Singles champion in the 2000 European championship, Karlsson was the world doubles champion in 1991 when he paired up with Thomas von Scheele. 

Chowhan warned that Karlsson is likely to be expensive, but claimed that the ministry of sports has agreed in principle to pay the price for a top quality coach. 

Generally, the government does not pay more than $ 3,500 per month for a foreign coach, but in this case, they are willing to pay $ 5,000, he said. 

Karlsson, however, has told the TTFI that he will not be able to stay in India for long at a stretch. 

He will come, impart training for around three weeks and then go back to return after a fortnight again, the TTFI boss said. 

In the ITTF Pro-Tour international tournament beginning on Thursday, Manjit Dua and Mantu Ghosh will be the mens and the womens coach respectively, while Chinese coach Yen Wei will also be around.

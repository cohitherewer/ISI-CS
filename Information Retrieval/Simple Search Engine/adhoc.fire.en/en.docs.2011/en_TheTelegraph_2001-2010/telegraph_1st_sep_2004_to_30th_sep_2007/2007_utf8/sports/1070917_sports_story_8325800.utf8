 India fall to Vettoris magic

Johannesburg: India frittered away a flying start and succumbed to Daniel Vettoris spin magic to lose their Super Eight match against New Zealand in the ICC World Twenty20 on Sunday. 

India got off to a rollicking start with Gautam Gambhirs impressive 51 and Virender Sehwags swashbuckling 17-ball 40 but failed to maintain the tempo in the middle overs as Vettori completely changed the complexion of the game with a remarkable figures of four for 20. 

The left-arm spinner also ran out Indian skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the 14th over to effectively turn the game New Zealands way. 

Needing a stiff 191 for a win, Sehwag gave India A blazing start, putting on 76 runs in 5.5 overs for the first wicket with Gambhir. 

However, once Sehwag was dismissed India was pushed to the corner. New Zealands excellent out cricket also added to Indias degree of difficulty. 

Vettori bowled a brilliant spell in the middle overs and India could never recover from the soft dismissals of their key men in Robin Uthappa (0), Yuvraj Singh (5) and Dhoni (24). 

Once they were out of the way, India crawled in the last five overs scoring just 35 runs. In contrast, New Zealand had scored 78 runs in their last five overs and that puts things in the right perspective. 

Sehwag put up a breath-taking performance as he batted with a vengeance, getting into the mood as early as the second over, taking 15 runs of mark gillespie with a six over mid-wicket and two blazing fours. 

But it was the manner in which he roughed up off spinner jeetan patel, taking 20 runs in his first over, in the fifth over that defeated the kiwi skippers gamble to tease the batsmen by pressing his off spinner even when the field restrictions were in force. 

Sehwag made the bowler look red in his face as he hit him for three fours and a six over long-off. Having given India the start they were looking for, Sehwag fell to Jacob Oram when he hit him to mid-wicket where Scott Styris took a fine catch. Sehwags knock included 6 fours and 2 sixes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bopanna must be brought back

- One hopes Dev Varman will bolster our Davis Cup squad

Spring is in the air and India is blooming, but tennis has its back to the wall. Our recent 1-4 loss to Uzbekistan in the Davis Cup has pushed us back to what could prove to be the beginning of a slide from Group I to II of the Asia-Oceania zone. A few years ago, with Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi in their prime, we were aspirants for a place in the elite World Group of 16. Now, with the surge in Asian tennis standards, we seem to be moving towards the bottom of the regional well. 

A loss in our next tie, scheduled from April 6 to 8 against Kazakhstan, would pit India against China or Chinese Taipei in a relegation play-off. 

A toss of the coin in favour of Kazakhstan has decreed that our young and inexperienced team play the tie away, on the slow clay courts. There isnt much to choose between the teams. Though Vivek Shokeen defeated Kazakhstans no. 1 Alexey Kedriouk in a recent Futures tournament in Delhi, the clay and home court advantage could tilt the balance in favour of Kedriouk. 

 It will be a very close tie and the presence of the marauding Paes in the doubles could tilt the tie in Indias favour. In case we lose, then one has to be an optimist to fancy Indias chances against Chinese Taipei or China, even on grass courts in India. 

The Indian tennis scene is a three-tiered edifice. At the top are Paes and Bhupathi, who are now pummelling each other while walking into the sunset of their illustrious careers. 

The second tier or generation consists of Rohan Bopanna, Harsh Mankad, Prakash Amritraj. All are ageing and have been unable to achieve the breakthrough to levels which will make an impact even at Asian levels. Bopanna, now 26 years of age, seems to have thrown in the towel for singles and has decided to try and make a career for himself in Grand Slam doubles. For all of them the hour glass is getting irretrievably lower. 

The third generation consists of Karan Rastogi (20) and Vivek Shokeen (19) both of whom played in our recent encounter against Uzbekistan but could not win a match. Somdev Dev Varman, a 22-year-old from Assam, studying in the US, was selected for the Davis Cup tie against Uzbekistan but could not make it due to visa problems. 

Though I have never seen him play, Dev Varman has good credentials. A former junior champion, Varman has benefited from the US collegiate system, which has very good training systems. More important than the training is the exposure to highly competitive inter-collegiate matches. 

Our boys, generally placid by nature, develop an aggressive and confident attitude in the US which is of much benefit. In the past, Indians who have played in the US inter-collegiate circuit, have made significant contributions to our Davis Cup matches. Jasjit Singh won a crucial singles against Giltinan to beat Australia at the South Club in 1974. 

Shashi Menon also played a pivotal role in several ties while Mahesh Bhupathis contribution is matchless. One hopes that Dev Varman will bolster, if not lead, our new Davis Cup squad. 

Rohan Bopannas wilthdrawal from the Davis Cup team a fortnight or so before our tie against Uzbekistan destroyed whatever little chance we had. His statement that he had decided to concentrate on doubles and would not be available for the Davis Cup had an immature audacity. His future doubles career was by no stretch of imagination akin to a subsonic rocket launch from Sriharikota. 

If he can make it, it will be after a grinding tortuous two to three year journey. Starting for his new goal, one week later after the Davis Cup would have made no difference in his future doubles career. 

Sadly, very sadly, the action reeks of an extension of the Paes-Bhupathi duel. Whatever the circumstances, the incident highlights an appalling lack of pride and respect for the country. It may be considered old fashioned to talk about the values like patriotism, sacrifice, pride and respect for ones country. 

President John F. Kennedy had said: Ask not what the country can do for you, but think of what you can do for the country. Every Indian should consider this quote to be his clarion call. 

Bopanna must be brought back to the Davis Cup team to help us win the tie against Kazakhstan.

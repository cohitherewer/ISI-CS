 Chopra drops to 30th place

Reno (US): Daniel Chopra shot a four-over 76 and dropped from overnight 13th to 30th at the end of the Reno-Tahoe Open on the USPGA tour. 

Chopras final round 76 saw him finish with a total of two-under 286 on Sunday. His 76 represented his worst final round since January, when he shot a 78 in the fifth round of the Bob Hope Classic. 

Chopra with $629,529 is now 110th on the money list and needs to stay in top 125 to keep his card for 2008. 

American Steve Flesch won the title and went on to become the PGA Tours first wire-to-wire winner this season with a five-shot victory. Five ahead overnight, the 40-year-old from Ohio clinched his third Tour title with a level-par 72. 

Left-hander Flesch shrugged off two bogeys to post a 15-under total of 273. 

Four-time Nationwide Tour winner Kevin Stadler of the U.S. closed with a 70 to share second place alongside compatriot Charles Warren (71) at 10 under.

 CAB to bring up Ranadeb issue

- Bhupinder for Eden tie 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Ranadeb Bose 

Calcutta: Chief national selector Dilip Vengsarkar, who was scheduled to visit the Eden during the Bengal-Karnataka Ranji Trophy semi-final, will not do so now. 

Instead, Bhupinder Singh will be here to witness the clash. 

The state association, it has been learnt, will take up the issue of Ranadeb Bose, who was ignored for the 30-member World Cup probables. 

A few cricketers and a selector will also talk to the national selector about the U-22 CK Nayudu Trophy winning captain Manoj Tewari. 

I will ask him why Ranadeb and Manoj were not included in the probables list, a selector said. 

Its surprising that both Ranadeb and Tewari, despite being in tremendous form in the Ranji Trophy, were not considered for the 30-member list 

As a first step, CAB had already asked the East Zone selector Ranjib Biswal about Ranadebs not inclusion inot the list. 

Meanwhile, Bengal are likely make two changes in the squad that played against Rajasthan. 

A fit Rohan Gavaskar will take Sourav Gangulys place, while opener Amitava Chakraborty may replace Arindam Das who had a lacklustre performance with the willow this season. 

Amitava has performed well of late and so, the selectors are in favour of fileding him. 

Medium-pacer Shib Sankar Paul, though playing local league matches, will not be considered for selection as the wise men dont think him fit enough to play such an important engagement. 

It will be a risk for both him (Paul) and the team if he gets down without match fitness, so we dont want to force his comeback, a source said.

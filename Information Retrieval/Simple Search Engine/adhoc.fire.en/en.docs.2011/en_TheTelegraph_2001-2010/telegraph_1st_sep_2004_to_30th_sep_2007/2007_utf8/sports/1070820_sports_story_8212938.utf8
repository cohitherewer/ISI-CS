 Beckhams effort in vain

New Jersey: In his first MLS start, David Beckham was instrumental in three goals but couldnt prevent Los Angeles Galaxy from losing 4-5 to the New York Red Bulls. 

New Yorks Jozy Altidore and Juan Pablo Angel and the Galaxys Carlos Pavon all scored twice on Saturday. 

New York opened the scoring in the fourth minute off a free-kick from Angel, who fired through the defensive wall. Two minutes later, Pavon scored for Galaxy, nodding home a Beckham corner. 

Beckham and Pavon came together again, this time the Honduran scoring by heading in a Beckham free-kick. 

Clint Mathis equalised two minutes into first-half injury time, slamming the ball home from well outside the penalty area after a goalmouth scramble. 

Altidore scored his first goal on a 49th-minute counterattack to make it 3-2, then scored again in the 70th minute, firing a fierce shot past goalkeeper Joe Cannon after dribbling across the top of the box. 

Landon Donovan replied for Galaxy a minute later, racing the length of the field to make it 4-3, and Edson Buddle scored in the 82nd minute to tie the game at 4-4, when the ball fell to him after teammate Kyle Veriss header hit the crossbar from another Beckham corner. 

Angel tallied the winner in the 88th. 

More than 66,000 saw the game at the New York area venue, a record for an MLS game not part of a double-header. (AFP)

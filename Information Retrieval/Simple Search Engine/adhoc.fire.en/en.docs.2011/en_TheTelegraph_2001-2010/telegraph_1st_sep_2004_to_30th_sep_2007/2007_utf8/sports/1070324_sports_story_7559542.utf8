 De Villiers ready for Aussie sledging 

Basseterre: AB de Villiers is under no illusions about what to expect. 

The South African opener, who may have unwittingly entered into the feud between Sunil Gavaskar and Ricky Ponting over the Australian teams behaviour, is expecting to be verbally assailed in the last Group A match at Warner Park on Saturday. 

When youre playing against Australia you know youre going to get a bit of abuse, but Im fine with that, De Villiers said Thursday. A cricket game without abuse is not a cricket game. I actually enjoy that I see it as a challenge. People go hard at you in the field, but thats great. Thats part of the game. 

De Villiers is one of the few players to have a higher one-day batting average against Australia (36.20) than overall (33.79), but hes not satisfied with the size of each innings against the reigning champions. 

Ive made three or four 50s against them at a run a ball, he said. After I get through that pressure period, I have to make big runs and not throw my wicket away Ive given it away too many times. 

Although still developing as a batsman, De Villiers feels that South Africas rise to the top of the ICCs limited-overs rankings is a sure sign of its growing poise against the team it deposed: Australia. 

Australia may have won once and tied once with South Africa on their way to winning the 1999 World Cup, but De Villiers points to recent results, like last years 3-2 series win at home, as proof they can beat Australia. 

For us to come to the World Cup with scars will be stupid because we have pulled it together, he said. 

In the one-day series in South Africa, it was 2-2, and then it was the big game when the Aussies got 434 and we went on to make 438. Weve got to go out there and show that were No. 1 in the world. 

De Villiers, who jokes that he calls himself AB because he cant remember his full name (Abraham Benjamin), thinks the loss for Australia of strike bowler Brett Lee cannot be compensated by Shaun Taits raw speed. 

I know Taits got a lot of pace too, but Lee is an awesome bowler that theyve lost, De Villiers said. Theyve lost a great bowler who can swing the new ball at pace, which obviously allows you to pick up a few wickets upfront.

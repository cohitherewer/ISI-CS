The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dalmiya responds to Prasun comments

A STAFF REPORTER

 Jagmohan Dalmiya 

Calcutta: Jagmohan Dalmiya on Friday dissociated himself from a letter written by the National Cricket Club (NCC). A day before the CAB annual general meeting, the former president shot a letter to incumbent Prasun Mukherjee. The NCC had written to the Army that the lease of the Eden cannot be renewed without its consent. The letter was later forwarded to the CAB. The members asked the president to ignore the letter. 

Reacting to Dalmiyas letter on Friday, Mukherjee told The Telegraph: He has accepted that the NCC has no role to play in the lease and has dissociated himself from the letter. That is a positive thing and I welcome it. There is no question of any debate now... Any help from him with respect to the Eden is welcome. 

Dalmiya said in the letter to Mukherjee: I was shocked and deeply pained when I read the newspapers this morning with reports of you alleging that I had masterminded a letter received from Lalit Seth of NCC and that I was being instrumental in delaying CABs development work. 

In fact, I have always held that I have nursed CAB like my own child and would do anything to protect its interest and promote its progress. I was duly elected as the president of the CAB, but had resigned on December 27, 2006, keeping the best interests of the association in mind. 

You would please recall that after the 2006 annual general meeting, I had invited you to head the infrastructure development committee and we had meetings on October 14 and November 2, 2006 One of the points of discussion was the extension of lease of Eden Gardens. I not only briefed you with regard to the latest position but also went at length to explain the history of the ownership of Eden Gardens from the days of Rani Rashmoni till a couple of years before the 1987 World Cup when there were six claimants ministry of defence, government of West Bengal, CAB, NCC, Calcutta Cricket Club and Railways. Prior to the 1987 World Cup, the five other claimants relinquished their claims in favour of the ministry of defence. The ministry of defence, in turn, gave Eden Gardens to lease for an initial period of five years and subsequently for 15 years from 1992. 

 It is rather irrational to assume that I would instigate any person to write that the lease of Eden Gardens cannot be renewed without the NCCs consent because I, along with former CAB presidents Siddhartha Shankar Ray and B.N. Dutt as well as former chief secretary Rathin Sengupta, were instrumental in obtaining the lease in favour of CAB from the defence authorities in 1987 and its subsequent renewal in 1992. I am fully aware that the NCC has no say whatsoever with regard to the renewal of lease. 

I have not seen Lalit Seths letter. But from what I have read about its contents in the newspapers, I can at best state that this could be his personal views as facts available with you would amply prove that for the last 20 years, NCC has no legal or moral claim on the ownership of Eden Gardens. I trust that the contents of this letter would satisfy you with regard to the factual position.

Didier Drogba broke his goal drought against Manchester United to grab the winner deep into extra-time at the first FA Cup final at the new Wembley Stadium. 

Drogba, scorer of 32 goals in all competitions going into the game, had not been able to get the better of arch-rivals Manchester United but opened his account against Sir Alex Fergusons side in dramatic fashion. The goal made Chelsea the first team since Liverpool in 2001 to win both FA Cup and League Cup in the same season and denied Premier League champions Manchester United a record fourth League and Cup double. 

The Ivorian striker left it until four minutes from time, with penalties looming, to lob the ball over the advancing Edwin van der Sar following Frank Lampards perfectly-weighted centre. 

Ryan Giggs had earlier missed a gilt-edged chance to seal the Double for Manchester United during the first half of the extra-time. 

Giggs failed to connect smoothly to Wayne Rooneys excellent cross in from the right as Petr Cech gathered on the line to keep the champions at bay. The game had failed to match the occasion at the new Wembley throughout normal time barring a 20-minute up-tempo spell at the start of the second half. 

Clear-cut chances were few and far between as Manchester United and Chelsea never hit the form which saw them finish as the countrys top two sides in the Premiership. 

In a drab first half, Frank Lampard came closest to breaking the deadlock when he brought a save out of Edwin van der Sar after half-an-hour. But it was not until the start of the second half that the game came briefly to light. 

Rooney, Uniteds lone striker, tried to make the breakthrough with two surging solo runs which were kept out by a superb Cech save and a strong Chelsea rearguard. 

At the other end, Drogba almost ended his goal drought against United to edge Chelsea in front. However, his free-kick on the right-hand side struck the outside of the post with Van der Sar on hand to deal with the effort. 

Cristiano Ronaldo, quiet for large parts of the match, hit a shot into the sidenetting as both sides settled for an extra 30 minutes. 

The win will also lift a club after a season in which injuries and speculation about the future of manager Jose Mourinho had dogged their attempts to win a third consecutive league title. After losing our league title in front of our fans, this makes up for it, Chelsea skipper John Terry said. Its fantastic, one of the best things Ive ever experienced. 

Mourinho, celebrating his first FA Cup triumph, said: This (medal) I dont throw away because it means a lot. This is the first time for me, Ive won every title in English football. 

The players deserve so much because the season has been so difficult. 

Billed as the dream final between the best two sides in English football and the worlds richest league, much of it was a disappointment. 

United fans thought the deadlock had ended just before the first 15 minutes were up when Ryan Giggs slid in to partially connect with a low Rooney cross and crunched into Cech, who had the ball. Though it then appeared to be forced over the line, no goal was given. 

When Giggs had that chance I thought it was going to be a goal, I thought it was all over, said a relieved Lampard.

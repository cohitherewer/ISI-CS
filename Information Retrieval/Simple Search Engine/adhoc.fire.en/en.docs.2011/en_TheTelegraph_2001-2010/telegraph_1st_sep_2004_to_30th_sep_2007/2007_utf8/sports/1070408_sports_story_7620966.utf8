The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Let there be music

 SHARP SINGLE 

 Bridgetown: World Cup organisers have bowed to criticism and reversed a policy restricting fans from bringing musical instruments into stadiums. Previously, supporters needed to seek prior approval from local organising committees to bring in large instruments to grounds. Spectators can now turn up with their instruments and be given the approval as they pass through security, an International Cricket Council (ICC) statement said. 

Safety must be paramount at matches but we do want everyone to watch cricket in a festive and lively atmosphere, CWC official Chris Dehring said in the statement on Friday. Musical instruments permitted include conch shells, horns, shak shaks, drums and trumpets, the statement said. 

The meanest one!

Georgetown: As the battle in the Super Eight hots up, the New Zealand attack stands as the meanest bowling machine of all. Stephen Fleming and his men have conceded just 3.73 runs per over or about 186 runs per match as certain patterns begin to emerge in the 2007 World Cup. The Sri Lankans are hot on their heels. They have conceded a frugal 3.85 runs per over or 192 runs in the stipulated 50 overs. Astonishingly, Australia and South Africa are fourth and seventh in the list! England occupy the third spot.

ICC okays Reza

Georgetown: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has allowed Bangladesh to replace injured paceman Tapash Baisya with allrounder Farhad Reza. Baisya suffered an ankle injury during the match against Australia in Antigua last week. The reports indicated Baisya will require six to eight weeks of rehabilitation before he regains full fitness so the (World Cup) technical committee has approved Reza as replacement, an ICC statement said.

Mooneys incentive

Georgetown: Irelands Paul Mooney has extra reason to redeem himself in the World Cup after an inauspicious first match by putting in a match-winning performance against New Zealand on Monday. Mooney, who made a first ball nought and conceded 40 runs from 3.3 overs in his only match so far against South Africa, has a New Zealander wife. It would be nice to beat the Black Caps because my wife and her family in New Zealand will be watching So there is some special interest there. I suppose there will be divided loyalties but Im sure she will be happy whichever way the result goes. 

Bad publicity

Karachi: A Pakistani bank has suspended a high profile publicity campaign featuring cricketers Younis Khan and Shahid Afridi after billboards and posters were defaced in Karachi. The bank launched the campaign with big billboards, posters and commercials on TV to coincide with the World Cup. (Agencies)

 Draper named Hewitts coach

Sydney: Lleyton Hewitt has appointed former Davis Cup teammate Scott Draper as his coach after being left in the lurch when Roger Rasheed quit last week. 

Hewitts manager Justin Cohen released a statement saying Draper had been hired to coach the former world No. 1 through the Australian Open, starting in Melbourne next week, but may continue in the job after that. The role will be open-ended and we will see how things unfold over the next two weeks, Cohen said. (Reuters)

 PCB to take feedback 

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board will take feedback from former and present Test cricketers of the country before finalising new performance-based central contracts by July 1. 

PCBs marketing and media director Ehsan Malik made it clear that the board would discuss the contract with the present players before implementing it. 

Malik said the draft of the new contracts was ready and would be deliberated by the ad-hoc committee in its meeting on June 16. 

He said PCB officials had studied players contract systems in use in Australia, England and India and were trying to come out with a best possible pay structure. (PTI)

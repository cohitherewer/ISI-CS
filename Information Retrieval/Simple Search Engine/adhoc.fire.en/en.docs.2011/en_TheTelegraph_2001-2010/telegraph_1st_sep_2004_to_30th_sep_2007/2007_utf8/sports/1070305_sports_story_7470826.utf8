 Arthur laughs off Warne attack

Port of Spain: South Africa have laughed off Shane Warnes assertion that their style of play was predictable and that they had little chance of winning the 2007 World Cup. 

We had a bit of a joke about that, South African coach Mickey Arthur said on Sunday in reaction to the comments by the Australian leg-spinner. 

You could say that was just Shane Warne being Shane Warne. 

On Friday, Warne was quoted as saying, I dont think South Africa have a chance. Theyre very regimented. I know theyre rated the number one side in the world at the moment but I dont think theyre the best side in the world. 

Arthur suggested that retired Australian great Warne had lost touch with the realities of the current South African team. 

Hes still stuck in the Hansie Cronje era, Arthur said with reference to the former South African captain, whose team built a reputation for consistency. 

Were a totally different team now with a totally different mindset. 

Current captain Graeme Smith has led South Africa to victory in 44 of his 81 one-day internationals in charge. 

Warne had tipped New Zealand and Sri Lanka loomed as the biggest dangers to Australias bid to win an unprecedented third straight title. 

I just like the way they play, he had said.

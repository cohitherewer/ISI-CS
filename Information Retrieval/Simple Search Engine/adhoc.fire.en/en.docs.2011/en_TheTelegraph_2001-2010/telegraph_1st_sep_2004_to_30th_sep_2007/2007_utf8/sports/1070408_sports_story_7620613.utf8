The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 When Dravid had to play messenger 

- After the Wolrd Cup dabecle, players stand cornered 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Mumbai: Nobody may confirm, but there apparently were phases in recent times when captain Rahul Dravid had to act as a messenger between coach Greg Chappell and most players. 

Sounds unbelievable, but it reportedly did happen. 

The complete breakdown in communication meant Dravid, an introvert himself, had to face the music. Its anybodys guess just how much it affected him as a person and as a cricketer. 

Dravid has come through a very tough period, is what somebody in the know told The Telegraph on Saturday, the day after the World Cup review. 

Meanwhile, Dravid hasnt only been backing Virender Sehwag both inside and outside selection meetings he stood by all his players during the review. 

At least one official specifically asked about the attitude of certain players, but Dravid insisted there had been nothing wrong with anybodys behaviour, revealed a well-placed source. 

The gentleman added: Throughout, Dravid kept saying if anybody had to be faulted, it would be him... His attitude enhanced the already high respect he enjoys... 

Dravid has kept the captaincy and, on the face of it, shouldnt have problems with stand-in cricket manager (coach) Ravi Shastri. Theres enormous repair work to be done and, so, their task is cut out.

 Barbados police to file case against organisers 

 An armed security officer stands guard 

Bridgetown: The local police are filing a

 case against Cricket World Cup (CWC) organisers over the controversial searching

 of officers at a warm-up game. 

The action, by private security guards at the University of the West Indies Cave Hill campus ground on March 5, led to widespread public condemnation. 

Some officers have informed us they feel deeply hurt by what occurred; but more importantly, they feel there are several issues arising out of the incident which need to be addressed, including issues regarding the role, powers and functions of the police as well as the sovereignty of not only the police force but of the nation as a whole, said a spokesperson on behalf of the local police. 

And, as such, we will take the appropriate steps to have these issues fully ventilated, he added. 

In another development, police officers were also threatening to withdraw their services for Wednesdays first official World Cup match between Australia and Ireland at Kensington Oval over a major contractual dispute. 

The move follows a directive from the association to its members not to sign an accreditation contract from the International Cricket Council (ICC) and CWC. 

The association, which represents more than 1200 members of the 1500-strong Royal Barbados Police Force, contends that a clause which absolves the ICC and CWC of responsibility for any injury or loss to a police officer at CWC events was in conflict with a police agreement sent to the organisers. 

However, World Cup Barbados CEO Stephen Alleyne clarified that it was the Local Organising Committee (LOC), not the ICC or CWC, which was responsible for the safety of security forces for the CWC. 

He said the contract, which the police force will have with the LOC, includes provisions for their safety. 

The police have a relatively standard contract and in that contract there is a clear requirement that there be adequate protection for police officers in terms of injury or any attacks, and we are in the process of negotiating that contract. 

I can confirm for you with absolute certainty that it contains a clause that is acceptable to the Royal Barbados Police Force, he said.

 SHARP SINGLES

Birrell backs Proteas

Georgetown: Irelands South African-born coach Adrian Birrell put aside national allegiance to admit that he thinks Graeme Smiths

 side has the heads and hearts to win their first World Cup crown.

Birrell, speaking after watching South Africas comfortable win over Ireland on Tuesday, saw enough to convince him that his compatriots can land the title in the final on April 28. 

I may be biased because they are my team, but they are a quality side and have played a great brand of one-day cricket, said Birrell, who played and coached Eastern Province before taking over as Ireland coach in 2003. 

If South Africa peak at the right time and play hard, quality matches they can go all the way. They have got every base covered and they do every discipline very well.

Aussie hopes in James

 St Johns: Queensland allrounder James Hopes has been put on standby for the Australia World Cup team as a potential replacement for the injured Shane Watson.Watson left the field in the second stage Super Eights game against Bangladesh last Saturday with a calf strain. He may not be available for selection until the semi-finals on April 24 and 25, assuming Australia get that far.

Effigy burnt 

 Dhaka: Angry Bangladesh fans have burned an effigy of World Cup captain Habibul Bashar after his team fell to consecutive defeats in the Caribbean. Students at Dhaka University burned the effigy of Bashar, calling for the skipper to quit.

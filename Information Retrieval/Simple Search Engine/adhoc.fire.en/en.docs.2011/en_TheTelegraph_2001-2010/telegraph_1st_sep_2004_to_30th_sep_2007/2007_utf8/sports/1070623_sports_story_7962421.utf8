Though not as big as the February 9-18 Games which attracted around 13,000 participants from all over the country, Saturdays meet has a significance of its own. 

It will not only see some of Asias best vying for glory over four hours of intense competition but will also be the first international meet of its kind to be held in Northeast. Moreover, it will also serve as a qualifier for the ensuing World Championship to be held in Osaka. 

Asias top names included Asian Games medallist Xue Juan (javelin), Xei Limei (triple jump) of China, Kim Young Min (high jump) of South Korea and Khadjimuratov Tatyana (400m) of Kazakhstan. Former Asian Games gold medalist 100-metre sprinter Susanthika Jayasinghe of Sri Lanka and Doha Games fastest woman Khubbieva Guzel of Uzbekistan are also in the fray. 

The 58-member Indian challenge will be led by Anju Bobby George. Among others, K.M. Binu (400m) and Vikas Gowda (discus) will give some medal hope for India. Assam will also have something to cheer about special entries are given to eight state athletes with an objective of providing international exposure. 

Early morning rains disrupted the practice session for the athletes but they made it up in the evening. 

As was with the National Games, sports enthusiasts thronged the booths where free entry passes were distributed on Friday. 

The booths set up at Sarusajai stadium, Nehru Stadium, Gauhati University and the National Games Secretariat saw 12,000 entry passes vanish within three hours. 

Dispur, still basking in the glory of the February meet, has pulled all stops to ensure that the 216 athletes and officials from 19 Asian countries have a smooth time in a city which is aspiring to become the gateway of South East Asia. 

The state government, among others, has given an assistance of Rs one crore towards hosting of the meet to the Assam Athletic Association (AAA). 

 The chief secretarys office and the organising committee secretary general Pradip Buragohain said all possible steps have been taken to make it a successful one so that it will help us get more such high-profile meets. 

The 22-event meet will start at 3.15 pm with a felicitation programme to be attended among others by Union Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar and Indian Olympic Association President Suresh Kalmadi to be followed by a 45-minute opening ceremony showcasing Assams culture.

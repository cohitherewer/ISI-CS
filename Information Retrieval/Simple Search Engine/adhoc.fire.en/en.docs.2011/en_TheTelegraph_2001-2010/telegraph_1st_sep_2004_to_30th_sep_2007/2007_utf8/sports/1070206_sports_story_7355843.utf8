 Jeev rises to 37th spot

 New Delhi: Jeev Milkha Singh climbed two places to occupy the 37th spot in the latest golf rankings released on Monday. 

Though Jeev finished tied 34th in the Dubai Desert Classic, the result in the elite field was enough to ensure forward movement after falling three places last week. 

Jeevs ranking had gone up one rung to 36th but went down subsequently after the lacklustre performance in the Qatar Masters and Abu Dhabi Championship. 

Jyoti Randhawa, who finished an impressive tied seventh in the Dubai event Sunday, jumped five spots to be at 86 in the rankings. Among other Indians, Shiv Kapur fell two spots to be placed 182. World No.1 Tiger Woods, despite finishing third in the Dubai tournament, maintained his dominance at the top of the table followed by Jim Furyk (US) and Adam Scott (Australia). Winner of the Dubai Desert Classic Henrik Stenson of Sweden was placed 10th. 

RANKINGS (Top-10) 

1. (1) Tiger Woods (US); 2. (2) Jim Furyk (US); 3. (3) Adam Scott (Aus); 4. (4) Ernie Els (RSA); 5. (6) Retief Goosen (RSA); 6. (5) Phil Mickelson (US); 7. (7) Vijai Singh (Fij); 8. (8) Luke Donald (GBR); 9. (9) Padraig Harrington (Ire); 10. (14) Henrik Stenson (Swe).

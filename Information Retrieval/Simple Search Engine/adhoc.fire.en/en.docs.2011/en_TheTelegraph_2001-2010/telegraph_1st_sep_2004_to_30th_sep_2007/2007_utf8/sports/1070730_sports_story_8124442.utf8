The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 It would 

 be better not having to choose between Lara, Sachin

 - Graham Gooch, who was captain in 1990, on the maestros 

 journey 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL

Nottingham: 

 Graham Gooch was the captain when Sachin Tendulkar played 

 his first Test series in England, way back in 1990. On Sunday, 

 the day after the maestro completed 11,000 Test runs, The 

 Telegraph spoke to Gooch about his maiden tour to these 

 parts.

 The following are excerpts

 On what he remembers most about 

 Sachins first Test in England (Lords, 1990)

 What struck me then was his athleticism... 

 He took a good catch to dismiss Allan Lamb (off Narendra 

 Hirwani) in the second innings... Sachin didnt score 

 many (10 and 27), but more than made up in the next Test 

 (Old Trafford), where his maiden hundred denied us victory...

 On the impression Sachin made 

 as a batsman

 What struck me and my teammates 

 was his maturity... Hed only recently turned 17, but 

 his head-balance was good and he had the shots... Sachin 

 didnt feel out of place... He didnt look lost... 

 Basically, he wasnt overawed by the big stage...

 On Sachins unbeaten 119 

 at Old Trafford

 He frustrated us and showed that 

 he was a very fine player in the making. Even then, Sachin 

 managed his game very well. Hed been under pressure, 

 but didnt allow the situation to get the better of 

 him. (Adds laughing) I cant remember the shots 

 he played... The No. 1 memory of that innings is that he 

 stood between us and a series-winning 2-0 lead.

 On Sachin over the years

 He has been consistent... Its 

 a pity he didnt get a hundred today (Sunday)... The 

 Trent Bridge crowd wouldve loved it... I sensed Sachin 

 wanted to silence those whod criticised him after 

 Lords...

 On the pressure Sachin has 

 had to bear

 Enormous, isnt it? The supporters 

 are fanatical... Hes carried the mantle very well, 

 though... In Chelmsford (during the tour match against England 

 Lions), I found him very relaxed... He was laughing... Was 

 enjoying his cricket... After many years of being the flag-bearer, 

 you want him to do that.

 On Sachin as a person

 Hes a super human being... 

 Very modest... Humble... Hes not brash and, well, 

 allows his cricket to do the talking... He has been an excellent 

 ambassador for India and cricket.

 On the Sachin versus Brian 

 Lara debate

 Youre speaking of two greats 

 with somewhat similar records... If you were looking purely 

 at entertainment, youd probably go for Lara... Having 

 said that, over the years, Sachin has been a model of consistency... 

 Hes gone about his job quietly... It would be better 

 not having to choose between Lara and Sachin.

 On whether Sachin could come 

 close to 50 Test hundreds

 He needs 13... Its some 

 way off, but he could get there... Its possible if 

 he wants to play for three-four years... But, when youre 

 34, youre seen as being in the last phase of your 

 career.

 Finally, on what the youngsters 

 should learn the most from Sachin

 Look at how he watches the ball... 

 How he keeps his head still... Watch his footwork... His 

 footwork was fantastic yesterday (Saturday)... Actually, 

 theres so much to learn from Sachin.

 Hotstepper upsets in Breeders 

 HONKY DORY

 Mumbai: The attendance was thin and there was a lot of room for movement at the Mahalaxmi racecourse on Saturday which, otherwise, witnessed very competitive races. It is another matter that favourites failed in the nine-event card after the likes of Aqua Glow, Reflected Glory and Priapus had given the punters a good start.

 The main event, the 1,400m Breeders Cup, was a shocker as the course-favourite, Alvarita, just fell shy to a rank-outsider, Hotstepper an S.S. Shah-trained colt, ridden by Y. Srinath.

 The winner, a Glory Of Dancer son, was always in touch with the frontrunners, while the favourite, ridden by C. Rajendra, had to cover a good 50m in the last furlong.

 Trainer Pesi Shroffs less-fancied Dynasty claimed the Peninsula Cup, marked for horses in the highest class. Rajendra again missed the bus as he failed to coax the fancied runner, Czarina, to beat the 10-1 outsider after getting the better of Giacosa, a 6-4 favourite.

 Rajendras similar tactics, however, paid off late in the evening. In the 1,000m Kejriwal Trophy, the jockey managed to get the best out of his favourite, Oyster Pearl, to overhaul Flames Of Fire. Rajendra had earlier partnered Aqua Glow to victory.

 Punters may have fared poorly on Saturday, but Derby day is going to be different. The attendance, according to RWITC, will definitely cross the 20000-mark on Sunday.RESULTS

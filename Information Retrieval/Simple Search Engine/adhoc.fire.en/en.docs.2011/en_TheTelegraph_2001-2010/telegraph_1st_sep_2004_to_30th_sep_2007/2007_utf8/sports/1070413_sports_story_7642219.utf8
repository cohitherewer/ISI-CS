 Seedorf, Inzaghi oust Bayern 

Munich: AC Milan will try to salvage national pride when they play Manchester United in the Champions League semi-finals, coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Wednesday. 

United humbled Milans Italian rivals AS Roma 7-1 on Tuesday to reach the last four 8-3 on aggregate, a result that would have especially piqued Ancelotti as a former Roma player. 

Romas loss was a shock to everyone and something nobody could have predicted, he told a news conference after Milan beat Bayern Munich 2-0 in their quarter final, second-leg tie to secure a 4-2 aggregate win and a clash with United. 

Our objective now is to keep Italys head held high in Europe, he said. We are pleased to be representing Italian soccer in the last four of the most important competition. 

Dutch midfielder Clarence Seedorf, who scored Milans first goal and created the second with a deft backflick, said the Italian clubs victory over United in the Champions League in the 2004-05 competition would stand them in good stead. 

After today (Wednesday) we are only one step away from the final and I think Manchester United know Milan very well from a couple of years ago, he said on German television. 

Coolly taken goals from Seedorf and Filippo Inzaghi saw AC Milan cruise to the 2-0 win over Bayern Munich in Munich on Wednesday. 

Milan edged ahead in the 27th minute when Kaka slipped a pass to Seedorf, who turned on the edge of the area and beat Oliver Kahn. 

The Italians took advantage of another slip four minutes later, as Seedorfs sublime back flick played in Inzaghi to score his 36th Champions League goal.

 Beckhams buy trophy estate in Beverly Hills

David and Victoria Beckham have finally bought a house in Los Angeles opting for a six-bedroom, nine-bathroom trophy estate in Beverly Hills for $22 million. 

Thanks to the weak dollar, the home was a relative bargain at a mere 11 million. 

After looking at more than 30 properties, including Meg Ryans former home, the couple settled on a modest Italian-style villa close to their Hollywood friends Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes. 

For David Beckham it will mean life as a serious commuter when he joins the LA Galaxy football team in July. He will face a gruelling 50-mile round-trip on the heavily congested 405 Freeway to the LA Galaxy ground in Carson City. The drive is likely to take well over an hour either way. The couples children Brooklyn, 8, Romeo, 4, and Cruz, 2 will attend a nearby school. 

The house is described in the sales brochure as: Sitting on one of Beverly Hills most exclusive streets, this estate has been painstakingly detailed and crafted throughout. The H-style floor plan sprawls across the one acre site, maximising city and ocean view while creating enchanting and intimate interior and exterior space. 

Photographs of the estate show a three-car garage and a pool on the front lawn. Privacy is ensured by tall hedges and huge iron gates. 

Although expensive by most peoples standards the monthly mortgage payments would be a whopping $91,666, with an interest-only loan at 6.25 per cent, after a 20 per cent down-payment the house is considerably lower down the winding San Ysidro Drive from the A-List enclave of Beverly Park, where homes can cost up to $40 million. 

According to reports, Mrs Beckham signed the contract for the house on Saturday. She and her husband will have to pay a commission of about $1.3 million, to be shared between their estate agent and that representing the seller. 

A friend of the couple said: Theyve finally found the perfect Beverly Hills property. Its modern, airy, very light and spacious with lots of windows. It still needs a bit of work, but Victoria will be sorting that out soon.

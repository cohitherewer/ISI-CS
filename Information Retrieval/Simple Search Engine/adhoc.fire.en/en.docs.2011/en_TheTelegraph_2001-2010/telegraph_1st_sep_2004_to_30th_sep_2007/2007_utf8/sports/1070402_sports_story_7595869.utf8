 PCB asks Mustafa to stay put

Lahore: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has asked the teams assistant manager to return to Jamaica and remain in Kingston, until the body of former coach Bob Woolmer is sent to Cape Town, his hometown. 

Asad Mustafa had arrived in London on his way home from Jamaica but has been told to go back. 

We need to have a responsible board official in Kingston while the investigations continue into Woolmers death and until his body is released by the authorities to be sent to Cape Town, a senior board official said on Sunday. 

Woolmer, 58, was found unconscious in his hotel room on March 18, the day after his team were eliminated from the World Cup following a shock defeat by Ireland. He was pronounced dead in hospital later that day. Jamaican police are treating the death as murder. (REUTERS)

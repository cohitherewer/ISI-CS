 Fresh claim by police in Woolmer case

Kingston: The Bob Woolmer controversy refuses to die down with Jamaican police now claiming to have received some new information regarding the Pakistan coachs mysterious death. 

According to a website report, police commissioner Lucius Thomas, who declined to reveal the nature of the information, would soon hold a press conference on the matter. 

We are in receipt of some material. We are studying it and we will make a statement shortly to address the whole issue of Bob Woolmer, Thomas said. 

Thomas, however, declined to respond to questions about reports in the British media that Woolmer was not murdered but died of natural causes. 

He also refused to comment on whether the information would confirm the speculation of the British press.

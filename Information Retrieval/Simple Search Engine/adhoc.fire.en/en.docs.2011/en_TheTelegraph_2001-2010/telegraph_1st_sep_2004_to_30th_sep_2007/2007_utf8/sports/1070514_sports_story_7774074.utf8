The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Teams under strict vigil in Chittagong

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chittagong: Security for the teams in Dhaka was not more than usual, but the Peninsula Hotel here presented a different picture on Sunday. The lobby, situated on the third floor, was swarming with armed securitymen. 

The players have been put up on the 10th and 11th floors and separate restaurants are catering to their needs. They have been strictly forbidden from meeting any unknown guests or stepping out without informing security personnel. 

The port city has been the scene of extremist attacks in recent past and the local administration is not taking any chances. During Team Indias last visit here in December 2004, the players were accompanied by IPS officer Tapan Deka.

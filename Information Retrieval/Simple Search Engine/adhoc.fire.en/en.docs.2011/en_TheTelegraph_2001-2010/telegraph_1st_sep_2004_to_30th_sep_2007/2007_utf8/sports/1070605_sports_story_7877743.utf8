Calcutta: It was a tale of two record-breaking swimmers with similar ambitions but different backgrounds. 

Monalisa Mondal and Gopinath Koyal shared 10 records during the state age-group swimming championships that concluded at Subhas Sarobar pool on Monday. Both want to pursue swimming as a career, but see their future in different perspective. While Monalisa is from a sound financial background, Gopinath is finding it hard to make both ends meet. 

Rishra girl Monalisa rewrote records in 50m and 100m backstrokes, 50m butterfly (heat), 50m freestyle and 200m individual medley, during the four-day meet while Gopinaths new marks came in 50m, 100m and 200m backstroke, 50m butterfly and 200 individual medley. 

Monalisa, whose mother Purna also was a state-level swimmer, wants to be recognised as a swimmer despite faring well in the school-leaving examination. I want to build a career out of swimming. I am following my family legacymy elder brother Supratik and two uncles Debabrata and Amitava Pal have also been into full-time swimming, Monalisa said. 

Gopinath, on the other hand, comes from a family, which depends on the earning from his fathers grocery shop in Joynagar. 

I have two elder brothers both are unemployed. I know its getting difficult to continue swimming. Lets see Gopinath said after completing his fifth record of the meet on Monday.

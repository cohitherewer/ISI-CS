New Delhi: India will have much more at stake than Syria when the teams clash in the ONGC Nehru Cup final at the Ambedkar Stadium on Wednesday. 

For the visitors, a defeat would mean no more than the proverbial slip between the cup and the lip. India, on the other hand, stand to lose the substantial momentum they have got during the course of the tournament. 

Indian football is at the crossroads. A triumph in a Cup final would be a giant leap forward for the players and officials. Not to forget the fans, who have thronged the stadium and shown so much faith in the team which has won three games in 10 days. 

The last time India reached the final of a major international tournament was in 2002 when they beat Vietnam to win the LG Cup. Of course in 2005, India won the SAFF Cup in Pakistan, beating Bangladesh. 

Syria are the favourites on paper, while expectations from the home team are sky high. A capacity crowd will be cheering Bhaichung Bhutia and the others, hoping that India flourish again under floodlights just as they had done against Kyrgyzstan. 

Bob Houghton is fully aware of the situation. After Tuesdays practice session, the national coach said it is going to be a huge game for India. Strictly from the football point of view, a defeat wont topple all my plans, said the Indian national coach. At the same time, a win wont turn us into world beaters overnight. 

But then, we have no right to let down the spectators and millions of people who have put their money on us. It would also boost our confidence on the eve of the World Cup qualifiers against Lebanon. We will do everything to win the Nehru Cup, Houghton said. 

K. Ajayan for Rennedy Singh would be the only change from the team that started against Kyrgyzstan. That is because Houghton said he needed a fresh pair of legs on the left. 

The Indian camp is a tad worried as Bhaichung quit midway through the practice session because of a minor groin injury. 

I will certainly start, but am not sure if I will last the entire period, said the Indian star. 

In the last match, Houghton had substituted the captain after 69 minutes. 

For an hour in the afternoon, the coach made the boys watch video clippings of the India-Syria round robin match and pointed out some mistakes. He reportedly told the boys to put pressure on Syria in their defensive third. 

Dont play too many aerial balls and avoid playing more than two touches in your half, he told the boys. He talked about general strengths and weaknesses of the Syrians but didnt mention any individual, not even striker Maher Al Sayed undoubtedly the man of the tournament so far. 

If the trio of Sayed, Zyad Chabbo and Ali Dyeb who completely bottled up Bhaichung in Indias 2-3 defeat the other day represents Indias biggest worry, Syria are concerned about Steven Dias. 

The boy is too good on the right, Syria coach Fajer Ibraahem said. He could be our biggest threat. 

The Indians are going for nothing less than gold. The Syrians are not unbeatable, reiterated Bhaichung. That day we took the lead and surrendered it. Things wont be the same in the final. 

Final kicks off at 6.30 pm

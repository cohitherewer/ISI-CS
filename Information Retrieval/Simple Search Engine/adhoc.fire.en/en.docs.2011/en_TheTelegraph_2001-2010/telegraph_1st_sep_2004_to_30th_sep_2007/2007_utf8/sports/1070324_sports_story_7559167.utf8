The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Focus is on access 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Gillian Woolmer with younger son Russel outside their home in Cape Town on Friday 

Calcutta: Theres suspicion that somebody known to Bob Woolmer, accompanied by outsiders, knocked on his Jamaica Pegasus suite in the early hours of Sunday. 

Woolmer responded on seeing a known face, but may have been overpowered by those who came in uninvited. 

Theres talk that it was a Mafia hit but, till late on Friday, the Jamaica Constabulary Force didnt have a suspect. 

Its as bizarre as the Pakistan coachs murder. 

Except that he was strangled, nothing is confirmed But theres a suspicion that somebody known facilitated the entry of people who shouldnt have been there, a well-informed source told The Telegraph from Kingston. 

He added: Unless the killer or killers took the stairs to the 12th floor or used the hotels service lift, they wouldve needed an access card to reach Woolmers suite If the killer or killers didnt have one, somebody staying on the floor couldve taken them up 

The Pakistan team was booked on that floor. 

Woolmer couldve been having the odd health worry, but he was a pretty fit 58-year-old and it wouldve been next to impossible for one man no matter how strong to strangle him manually. 

The hotel, it seems, first alerted the police (after a housekeeping maid found Woolmer on the floor) and Pakistan manager Talat Ali was informed after even a doctor had arrived. 

According to the doctor, Woolmer was alive when shifted to hospital. 

The Pakistani players have already been interrogated their grilling on Thursday delayed the teams Kingston-Montego Bay flight by at least a couple of hours and fingerprinted. Now, the DNA tests remain. 

The well-informed source revealed that the Inzamam-ul Haqs have been shaken to such an extent that theyve stopped discussing the murder even among themselves. 

Its such a sensitive situation that nobody wants to get dragged into it Koi kuch bhi nahin keh raha They want to remain quiet and, as important, get away from it all. 

At the moment, theres some confusion over Pakistans departure home, via London. It could be Saturday, but 

Footnote: Till late, it wasnt clear whether the Jamaica Pegasus would remain an official hotel for the World Cup. Theres an eerie feeling there, with Irish captain Trent Johnston admitting he was feeling spooky.

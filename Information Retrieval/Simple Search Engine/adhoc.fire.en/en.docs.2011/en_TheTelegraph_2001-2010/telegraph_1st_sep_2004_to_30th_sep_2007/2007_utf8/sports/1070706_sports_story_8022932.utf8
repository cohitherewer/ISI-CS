The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Serena needs to clean up her act

 - Federer has enriched both the game and sport as a whole 

MICHAEL HENDERSON

As members of the Lawn Tennis Association take turns by night at the All England Club, scouring the evening sky like Herod and hoping to find there some augury of a modern annunciation, the coming of the child who will one day triumph at Wimbledon, we are left to admire a true champion. 

It is no hardship to acclaim Roger Federer, who will surely retain his mens title on Sunday, or whenever the final takes place, and so match Bjorn Borgs record of five successive championships. For Federer is a true champion, in manner as well as deed, which is not something that one can say willingly of Serena Williams, who is merely a winner of titles. This is not a matter of semantics. Those who dont understand the difference have no inkling of what sport is, or should be, about. 

One thing it is not about is the pursuit of personal glory above all other considerations, a point clearly lost on Miss Williams, whose play-acting against Daniela Hantuchova has attracted so much criticism. Suffering from cramp one moment, then bouncing up and down like a seal at feeding time, it was not the most convincing performance from somebody who worships at the shrine of Thespis. 

Nor was her request for a gypsys kiss on her opponents serve in keeping with either the laws or the spirit of the game, if that overworked phrase has any currency. The rest of us, having scrutinised her courtside notebook, could certainly do with a lengthy comfort break to throw up. 

Isnt it amazing what the professional mind can come up with, given so much time to while away between rain breaks? My good thoughts are powerful, Serena has jotted down in her commonplace book, with the goggle-eyed certainty of the newly enlightened. My only negative thoughts are weak. Or how about this? Hang on to the thought of what you want. Make it absolutely clear. 

Oh, its absolutely clear, my dear; its clear as day. Youre a fifth-form philosopher, like so many Californians, even if they prefer to call it profundity. Its just a box of rain, some other folk from the West Coast used to sing, believe it if you need it, or leave it if you dare. At least the Grateful Dead had an excuse: somebody had clearly slipped some strange potion into their mugs of bedtime cocoa. 

Believe it if you need it. Theres another one for you, love. It makes just as much sense as You will move up, which is what Curtis Mayfield urged us all to do. If youre really struggling with cramp, and feel you have a mountain to climb, remember what another Sixties yodeller, Donovan, told us about those forbidding, craggy peaks: First there is a mountain, then there is no mountain, then there is. Wa-hey! 

Federer, thank goodness, doesnt go in for these sickly confections. He whacks the ball over the net, if whacking does justice to his range of stroke, smiles easily, and can be relied upon to say the right thing. In short, he behaves like a champion, on and off the court, and has enriched both the game and sport as a whole. 

You dont have to be a great player to be a star these days, as the choreographed career of David Beckham proves. But that is not to say that stardom cannot co-exist with greatness, for the Swiss is obviously a great tennis player. Whether he is the greatest of all tennis players is uncertain, for these things can never be proved to everybodys satisfaction, but the fact that he is mentioned in the same breath as Rod Laver and Pete Sampras is its own testimony. 

Also, Federer pleases in an aesthetic sense, and sport at its most ideal must always have an aesthetic sense, even though its practitioners may not bother about winning points for artistic merit. 

Of course, much has to do with taste. Watching Tiger Woods march down the fairway towards another major may not lighten everybodys mood. There is something relentless about his steady tread that drains joy from the achievement, though he is undoubtedly a great champion. Federer, on the other hand, satisfies every need. He plays with a grace that makes nonsense of cliches like commitment and focus. Which is why so many people will be happy to see him end this championship safe on dry land.

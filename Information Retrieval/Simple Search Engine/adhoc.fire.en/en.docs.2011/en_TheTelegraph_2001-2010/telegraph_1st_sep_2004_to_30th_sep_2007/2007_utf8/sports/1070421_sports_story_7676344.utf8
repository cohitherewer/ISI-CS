 Panel clears Pakistan of match-fixing 

Islamabad: An inquiry into Pakistans shock exit from the World Cup has found no evidence that any players were involved in match-fixing, the head of the probe said on Friday. 

The Pakistan Cricket Board (pcb) ordered the inquiry after the 1992 champions were dumped out of the competition, losing to minnows Ireland in the first round, sparking allegations that games could have been thrown. 

The inquiry has been completed and there is no evidence of match-fixing against any player, inquiry committee chief Ijaz Butt said. 

He said details of the committees report would be submitted to PCB chief Dr Nasim Ashraf next week. 

The committee interviewed nearly 40 players, officials and retired PCB functionaries during its two-week hearing. 

Butt also rejected a claim by former PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan, who said in March that parts of international matches are fixed and the practice known as spot-fixing happens on a regular basis. 

There is no evidence of any targeted match-fixing and Saharyars statement was found to be incorrect, Butt said. 

Butt also criticised Pakistan media manager Pervez Mir for accusing the team of focusing too much on the religion, instead of concentrating on the game. It was a stupid statement from him, Butt told reporters after the hearing in Islamabad. 

Allrounder Shaid Afridi, who made a statement before the committee on Friday alongwith fellow player Umar Gul, told reporters that the entire team was responsible for the poor showing in the Word Cup. (AFP)

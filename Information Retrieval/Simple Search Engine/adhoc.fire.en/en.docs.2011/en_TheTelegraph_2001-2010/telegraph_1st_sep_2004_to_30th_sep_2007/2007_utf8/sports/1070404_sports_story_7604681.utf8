 Dhoni fails as Jharkhand go down to Orissa

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Those who turned up at the Eden quite early in the morning to watch fireworks from India wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, were a disappointed lot after the Jharkhand star managed only one run in his five-minute stay in the middle in the opening National (East Zone) Twenty20 match. Jharkhand, by the way, lost to Orissa by 11 runs on Tuesday. 

Putting Orissa to bat first on a wicket that offered even bounce, Jharkhand bowlers did a great job to bundle out the latter for 121 in 19.3 overs. 

It was only P. Jayachandra who made a significant contribution with 46 off 37 balls. The next best for Orissa was by opener Bikash Pati (14). 

For Jharkhand, medium-pacer Praveen Kumar was the pick of the bowlers claiming three for 36. 

BRIEF SCORES 

Orissa 121 in 19.3 ovs (Jayachandra 46; Kumar 3/36, Keshav 2/16). Jharkhand 110/9 in 20 ovs (Dhoni 1, Ghosh 24; Pritamjit 2/21, Patel 2/23). Orissa won by 11 runs.

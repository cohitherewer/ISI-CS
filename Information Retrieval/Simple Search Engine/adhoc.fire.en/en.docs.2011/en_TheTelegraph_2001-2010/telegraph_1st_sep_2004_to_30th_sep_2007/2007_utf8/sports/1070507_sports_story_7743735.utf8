 Hayden set for a massive pay hike

Melbourne: Australian opener Matthew Hayden is set to reap million-dollar rewards for his blazing form in the World Cup with Cricket Australia (CA) planning a massive hike in the left-handers pay-packet. 

Hayden, who plundered 659 runs in the premier event, is set to become the one of the top-five earners in Australian cricket with CA deciding to hike his retainership, according to a newspaper report. 

Hayden was 19th on the earning list with a retainership of $300,000 till a year ago and was also struggling to keep his place in the Australian ODI side after a string of poor performances. But his World Cup heroics have changed the scene. 

His CA retainership is likely to go up to $550,000. Add prize money, private sponsorships, bonuses and tour fees, and the left-hander is set to take home a pay-packet of over $1.2 million. His manager Chris White confirmed Hayden was up for a massive pay hike. 

Haydos will definitely be a big improver. Hes always had a high Test ranking and his ODI day ranking will improve, given his magnificent performances in the West Indies. 

CA also confirmed that Hayden is likely to emerge as a big gainer in the contractual shake-up after the retirement of Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath, Damien Martyn and Justin Langer. (PTI)

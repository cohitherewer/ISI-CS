 Tiger at tied 77th spot

Bethesda (US): Daniel Chopra made five bogeys and two birdies to finish with a three-over 73 and be at tied 77th place on Day I of the AT amp;T National at Congressional, a tournament hosted by world No. 1 Tiger Woods. 

The lead was held by five players K.J. Choi, Vijai Singh, Joe Ogilvie, Jim Furyk and Stuart Appleby all of whom shot a 66 at the 7,204-yard, par-70 Blue Course known for its long par fours. 

Chopra was the not the only one who had problems, as Woods shot a 73 with 34 putts that included three three-putts. The Swede of Indian origin was tied with 15 other players, including Woods. 

Chopra started on the 10th and had three bogeys on the stretch as he turned in a three-over. On his second nine, he birdied the first, bogeyed the third, and birdied the eighth only to give it back on the ninth. 

Choi enjoyed a superb start, firing a four-under-par 66 for the joint lead. A former Asian Tour regular, Choi had six birdies to two bogeys. 

Among other Asian Tour stars, Australias Andrew Buckle was at even par for the day in tied 29th position, while Kevin Na opened with a 71 to be in joint 45th spot. 

One shot behind the leaders are 51-year-old Fred Funk and 47-year-old Corey Pavin. Phil Mickelson, who has a left wrist injury, shot a 74, while Adam Scott shot 72. 

Indias Arjun Atwal shot three birdies on the back nine for a one-under 70 to lie in 49th spot after the opening round of the Legend Financial Group Classic on the Nationwide Tour in the United States. 

Roland Thatcher, James Driscoll and Richard Swift, who each shot a six-under 65, shared the lead. (PTI)

 Vaughan in 2nd Test squad

 Vaughan 

London: Captain Michael Vaughan returned to the England side on Tuesday when the squad for the second Test against the West Indies at Headingley was announced. 

Vaughan has recovered from a broken finger that kept him out of the first Test at Lords that ended in a draw on Monday. 

The Test at Headingley, in Leeds, starts on Friday. 

Batsman Owais Shah, picked in Vaughans absence, has been dropped from the squad while fast bowler Matthew Hoggard, who suffered a thigh strain at Lords on Saturday, remains unavailable. 

Allrounder Andrew Flintoff was included although he is nursing an ankle injury. 

Michael Vaughan came through his net session today without any adverse reaction while Andrew Flintoff practised earlier today but did not bowl as a precaution, chairman of selectors David Graveney said. 

We will need to reassess Andrews fitness over the next 48 hours, he was quotes as saying in the England and Wales Cricket Board website. 

 THE SQUAD 

Michael Vaughan (captain), Andrew Strauss, Ian Bell, Paul Collingwood, Alastair Cook, Andrew Flintoff, Steve Harmison, Monty Panesar, Kevin Pietersen, James Anderson, Liam Plunkett, Matt Prior, Ryan Sidebottom.

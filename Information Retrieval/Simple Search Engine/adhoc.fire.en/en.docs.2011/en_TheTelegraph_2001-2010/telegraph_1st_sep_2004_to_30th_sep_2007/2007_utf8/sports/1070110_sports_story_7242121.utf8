The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 First-innings lead Bengals priority

 - Ranji Trophy 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bengal are within two points of making the Ranji Trophy semi-final and that seems to be their priority as they take on Rajasthan in their final group league encounter of the Super League at the Eden from Wednesday. 

Their stupendous triumph over Hyderabad, courtesy Ranadeb Boses 10-wicket match-haul, is now a thing of the past and Deep Dasgupta and Co. is more focused on the task at hand. The availability of Sourav Ganguly is also sure to spur the players as they ooze confidence and look determined to raise the bar further. 

The availability of Sourav will obviously be a big boost We are aiming for the first innings lead and confirm our semi-final berth. We do not want to complicate the situation by having to depend on the permutation and combination, Deep said after nearly five hours of training on Tuesday. 

Sourav wasnt present during practice, but did visit the Eden for a brief while in the afternoon for a chat with the selectors. 

If Bengal dont manage two points against the lowly-placed Rajasthan (four points from five matches), their fate will hang on the Mumbai-Maharashtra and Hyderabad-Punjab matches. Bengal lead the Group B standings with 12 points followed by Mumbai (10) and Hyderabad and Punjab (8 each). Bengal will also hope that at no point the quotient rule comes into effect while deciding the semi-finalists since they are the worst-placed among the five teams. 

There was a slight fitness worry for Bengal with Ranadeb suffering from side strain, but he confirmed later that he would play. The mediumpacer has so far taken 32 wickets in the tournament. The presence of some grass in the pitch along with the morning dew, which will aid lateral movement, should serve as an inspiration for the Ranadebs. 

The injured Rohan Gavaskar has already ruled himself out and it is likely that Subhomoy Das will replace Amitava Chakraborty in the XI. Subhomoy will open with Arindam Das with Sourav likely to come in at No.4. 

Rajasthan will be without their foreign imports, Vikram Solanki and Kabir Ali, who have returned to England. Moreover, Gagan Khoda is unavailable because of personal reasons. 

Captain Ajay Jadeja is also unsure of playing. There is nothing at stake for the team I will decide on playing only tomorrow morning, Jadeja said after match-eve nets. 

Despite putting up a promising line-up, Rajasthan have failed to get their act together this season. They will have to depend largely on the new and untested players in their bid to put up a good show. 

Bengal will look to bank on this inexperience and make the most of their final group league game.

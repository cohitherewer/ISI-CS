 Mahela charts path to global glory

 Mahela Jayawardene 

Arjuna Ranatunga has described Sri Lankas World Cup victory of 1996 as the greatest triumph in the history of his country, but the worst moment for its cricket. From then on, the former captain believes, malign influences hijacked the running of the game and money started to become a corrosive factor among players. 

His opinion is not shared by Mahela Jayawardene, who will try to overturn the odds and beat Australia in the final on Saturday. 

When Ranatunga was nicknamed Napoleon, it was not just for his short, stocky frame. He was the ideal captain for an emerging side. Sri Lanka had won only four matches in the whole of the previous five competitions, but his combination of tactical foresight and forceful leadership pulled along talented players. 

It required an autocrat then, just as Jayawardenes more understated leadership is required now. Baby-faced and skinny with a gentle, squeaky voice, the democratic Jayawardene runs a calmer ship. He does not shy from confrontation, but he does not seek it, either. The style helped him to become the ICC Captain of the Year in 2006. 

Tom Moody, the Sri Lanka coach, who knew Ranatunga as an opponent, believes that both are a product of their time. He said: Arjuna is an admired leader, but the game has changed in Sri Lanka. Back then, he was a strong character leading a group of players who needed leading. 

A lot more individuals have responsibilities and leadership roles now than they did 11 years ago. Mahela is hugely respected. He is an astute thinker and a player who is happy to lead with the willow in his hand, as well. They are different, but both are equally valued in their way. 

Both, too, have thrived on the leadership. Ranatungas masterstroke in Lahore in 1996 was to ignore that all previous finals had been won by the team batting first. Having practised under lights at the Gadaffi Stadium, he realised that dew would be a handicap to bowlers late on. Fittingly, he hit the winning runs himself. 

Jayawardene, a higher class as a batsman, is enjoying his best World Cup. Only Matthew Hayden has scored more than his total of 529 runs and his hundred against New Zealand in the semi-final was masterful. That New Zealand innings typified someone who has drawn on all his experience, Moody said. 

Ashantha de Mel, the Sri Lanka chairman of selectors, confirmed that Farveez Mahroof, the all-rounder, will play in the final at the expense of Dilharo Fernando, the fast bowler. Fernando played poorly against New Zealand, De Mel said.

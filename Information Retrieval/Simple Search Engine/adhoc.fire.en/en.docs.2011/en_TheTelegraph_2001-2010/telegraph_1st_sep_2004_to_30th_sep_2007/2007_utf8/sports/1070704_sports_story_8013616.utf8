The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Buzz over thank you 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sachin Tendulkar, who invited Yuvraj Singh to share his MoS award in Belfast 

Glasgow: Senior-most pro Sachin Tendulkars gesture of inviting Yuvraj Singh to share his Man-of-the-Series award in Belfast, on Sunday, wont be forgotten in a hurry. 

The buzz, though, is that Sachin made another point very publicly thanking the left-hander for supporting him when there was a suggestion that the then-coach, Greg Chappell, would target him in his post-World Cup report to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). 

Yuvraj backed Sachin in a TV interview, which led to his being showcaused by the BCCI. Sachin himself got hauled up for speaking to the media! 

While Yuvraj did have significant contributions in the last two ODIs against South Africa (49 not out and 61 not out), the thank you-factor cant be ruled out. 

For the record, Sachin told The Telegraph: I just felt Yuvrajs contribution in our series win needed to be recognised Thats it

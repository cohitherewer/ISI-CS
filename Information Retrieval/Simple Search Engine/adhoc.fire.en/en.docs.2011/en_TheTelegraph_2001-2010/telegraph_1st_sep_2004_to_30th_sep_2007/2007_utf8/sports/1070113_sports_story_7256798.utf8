Calcutta: Sourav Gangulys one-day comeback grabbed much of the attention during the third day of the Ranji Trophy Super League tie against Rajasthan at the Eden. As Bengal grabbed a 390-run lead, Rajasthan still need 188 runs to avoid an innings defeat with six wickets in hand. 

Sourav completed his seventh Ranji century in the morning session even though Manoj Tewari (181) missed out on a much-deserved double hundred. The pair added 217 runs for the fifth wicket, the highest against Rajasthan. 

Sourav enjoyed the morning session against an attack that lacked sting and motivation. He toyed with the bowling, hitting boundaries at will. There were 21 hits to the fence in his 122 from 118 balls. 

Bengal could have declared the innings but decided to give Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Sourashish Lahiri some batting practice. Sourashish used the opportunity in completing a double 1000 runs and 100 wickets to become the second Bengal player after Utpal Chatterjee to achieve the feat. 

Rajasthan began their second innings disastrously, losing three wickets within 35 runs. Rajesh Bishnoi tried to put up a brief resistance. But Nikhil Doru (60 batting) and Rohit Jhalani (62 batting) then joined forces to deny Bengal any further success. 

With Ranadeb Boses side strain showing signs of flaring up and the hosts deciding not to risk him ahead of the semi-final, the bowling wore a run-of-the-mill look. On a wicket that didnt afford much help, Bengals bowlers were found wanting. In Ranadebs absence, it was made to look pedestrian. Sourav Sarkar only shone for a brief while. 

The hosts spinners havent come into play much during this season as the pacers have dominated the proceedings. When Sourashish got a chance to prove his capabilities, he was found wanting. You must have the ability to make things happen and Sourashishs lack of variation and tendency to bowl flat didnt bear fruit. 

Deep Dasgupta, though, tried to defend him at the close. He was encouraging during his last spell and we hope he will produce a good show on the final day, the Bengal captain hoped. 

There seemed to be some good news in Shib Shankar Paul. The mediumpacer is apparently fit and will be available for the semi-final. But wont lack of match practice be a worry? He will be playing a CAB League match tomorrow. I would any day go for him considering his experience and mental strength. Im waiting for the okay from the physio, Deep informed. 

After Hyderabad achieved a one-wicket win over Punjab, Bengals place has been confirmed in the semi-finals. 

Doru and Jhalani stuck to their task, not taking any risk and waiting for the loose balls. If Bengal hope to return with five points from the match and top their group, their bowlers will have to pull something out of the ordinary to ensure that. Ranadeb will also have to be back in full flow.

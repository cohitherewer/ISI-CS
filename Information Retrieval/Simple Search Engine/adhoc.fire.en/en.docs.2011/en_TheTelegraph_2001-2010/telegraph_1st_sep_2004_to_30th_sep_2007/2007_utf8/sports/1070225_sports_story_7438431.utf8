 Arjun Atwal misses cut

Playa del Carmen: Arjun Atwal knocked himself out of weekend action at the Mayakoba Golf Classic with a five-over 75 in the second round. 

The Indian finished with a total of two-over 142 to miss the cut which came at even par. The event is the US PGA Tours first tournament in Mexico. 

Atwal, who is in on a limited exemption this season, had earlier finished 35th at the AT amp; T National Pro-Am at Pebble Beach. Next week he is off to Phuket for his first appearance in asia in more than a year. 

Fred Funk, the first round leader at eight-under 62, added a 69 to be nine-under 131. He shares the lead with Thomas Brent Weekley (64) and Camermon Beckman (67). 

A bogey-laden back nine totalling four-over 39 ended Atwals hopes of making the cut despite a late birdie on 17th. He dropped shots on second and fifth, before a birdie on ninth gave him some respite. 

On the back nine, he bogeyed 10th and 12th, double bogeyed 14th and dropped another shot on 16th. Not even the birdie on 17th could help him make the cut.

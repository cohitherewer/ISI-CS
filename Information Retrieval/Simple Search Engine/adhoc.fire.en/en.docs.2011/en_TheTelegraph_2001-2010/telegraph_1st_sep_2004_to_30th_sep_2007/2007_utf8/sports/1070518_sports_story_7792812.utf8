 Dhanraj wish

New Delhi: Dhanraj Pillay, often labelled a coachs nightmare for his rather volatile temperament, envisages a coaching career for himself once he hangs up his boots. 

I am still enjoying playing for Air India. But once I quit, coaching is definitely an option. Whatever I learnt from my seniors, I would like to pass it on to the next generation players, Dhanraj said after releasing his biography. 

Its not that I can straightway take over the reins of the senior team. I have to start with youngsters and Im also planning an academy, he said. (PTI)

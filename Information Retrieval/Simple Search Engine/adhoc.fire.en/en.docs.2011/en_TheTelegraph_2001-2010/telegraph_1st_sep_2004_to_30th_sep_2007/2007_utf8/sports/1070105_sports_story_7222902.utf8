 India bow out 

Perth: Indias hopes of making it to the Hopman Cup final suffered a setback when Sania Mirza lost to Spains world No. 27 Anabel Medina Garrigues 6-3, 1-6, 3-6 in the womens singles of the group B tie against Spain on Thursday. 

Rohan Bopannas loss thereafter ended Indias chances. Bopanna went down in straight sets 2-6, 3-6 to world No. 7 Tommy Robredo. 

Top-seeded Russia will play Spain in the final. Russia advanced from Group A when Nadia Petrova and Dmitry Tursunov won their singles matches then won the mixed doubles for a 3-0 win over France. 

The Czech Republic had an outside chance of making it to the final, but lost 1-2 to Croatia in another group B match. 

Sanias week-long winning streak ended mostly because of her 61 unforced errors against Garrigues. (Agencies)

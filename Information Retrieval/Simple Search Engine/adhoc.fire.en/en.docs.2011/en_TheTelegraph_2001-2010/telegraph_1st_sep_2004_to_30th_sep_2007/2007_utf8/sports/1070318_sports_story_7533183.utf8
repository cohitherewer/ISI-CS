The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Confident Mortaza eyes consistency

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Port of Spain: Its quite unusual for a Bangladeshi to top the bowlers list, beating the likes of Glenn McGrath, Brett Lee, Abdul Razzaq, Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah Muralidharan. But Mashrafe Mortaza achieved the near impossible when he became the No.1 ODI bowler last year with a maximum of 49 wickets in 27 matches. 

For the record, the only Indian in the list was Irfan Pathan at No.9. 

The achievement went mostly unnoticed May be because I represent Bangladesh who are not seen as a major force in world cricket. It was satisfying in the sense that it helped me gain recognition for my efforts. It also proved my abilities after I missed nearly a year owing to an ankle injury. Our cricket, too, received a major boost, the soft-spoken Mortaza told The Telegraph last evening. 

The wickets were a reward for my persistent line and length. Consistency is the key If I can maintain these qualities I am confident of carrying on the good show. I must also thank the Almighty for all this, the 23-year-old mediumpacer added. 

Mortaza credits coach Dav Whatmore for the turnaround in Bangladeshs fortunes. 

He has brought professionalism into our game. The players are now aware of their responsibilities. There is unity in the side and we try and complement each other. The presence of New Zealand physio Paul Close has also worked wonders. Today the players are more motivated. 

What does he reckon as the most significant change in Bangladesh cricket? The change in the players mentality has been the most important aspect. Players today are bold and not afraid of the opposition. The confidence has improved and it is showing in their attitude. 

But does playing mostly against the likes of Kenya and Zimbabwe help their cricket? This is not in our hands. The board and the International Cricket Council chalk out the itinerary. Whenever weve got the opportunity to take on the big teams, we havent disappointed. In another few years, we can be more competitive. 

The first player to take six wickets for Bangladesh (six for 26 against Kenya in August 2006), Mortaza is looking forward to meeting his idol Courtney Walsh in his maiden visit to the West Indies. 

I grew up idolising Walsh. I will go up to him and seek guidance if the opportunity arises. I am also a great fan of Glenn McGrath. One can learn the virtues of line and length by simply watching him bowl. 

Mortaza also wants to spend time at the MRF Academy in Chennai and seek advice from the legendary Dennis Lillee. 

I had been there once. But national engagements have forced me to shelve more such plans. Maybe the Board (Bangladesh Cricket Board) can work out something this time. 

The presence of youngsters like Mortaza, Mohammed Ashraful, Shahriar Nafees and Mohammed Rafique have gone a long way in turning the corner for Bangladesh. Not without reason did Rahul Dravid say that Bangladesh are close to shedding their minnows tag. Mortazas performance will remain a case in point.

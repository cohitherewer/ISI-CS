 Ghei at joint third spot

Beijing: Gaurav Ghei played a gritty round to overcome putting problems and stay in contention for the title after the second round of the inaugural Pine Valley Beijing Open Golf tournament here on Friday. 

Ghei returned an even par card, which cost him the overnight lead but still kept him within one shot of the joint leaders, Thai duo of Panuwat Muenlek and Chapchai Nirat. 

Ghei is now seven-under 137 for 36 holes, while the two leaders are at eight-under 136. 

Ghei is now in tied third position together with Australias Scott Strange who fired a 68. (PTI)

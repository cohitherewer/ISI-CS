Vadodara: The last two months have been fantastic for Sourav Ganguly. Smiling, he acknowledged as much at the end of the four-match ODI series against the West Indies. 

Oh, yes... Everything has happened in two months... I made a Test comeback, then returned in the ODIs and, this (Wednesday) afternoon, even captained India!... It has been amazing, Sourav told The Telegraph. 

The captaincy came his way, for just a while early on, when Rahul Dravid went off and vice-captain Sachin Tendulkar wasnt on the field. 

Asked whether hed felt excited, Sourav replied: Not really... I was, as you know, only standing-in... Hed been passionate, though, and that couldnt have been missed by anybody. 

While Sourav finished the three-Test series in South Africa as the highest scorer for Team India (214 runs), he registered two fifties in the three ODIs 98 in Nagpur and 68 here. The one time he didnt get a big score was in Cuttack (13). 

Sourav had been rested in Chennai. Incidentally, thats the match we lost. 

Not wanting to ignite a controversy, Sourav didnt talk about having proved a point on the home turf of former senior selection committee chairman Kiran More, but its obvious he drew much satisfaction from a wonderful innings which saw many runs from deliveries pitched short. 

In fact, till he got out giving the charge, it appeared Sourav would finally get his 23rd ODI hundred. He hasnt had a three-figure knock for almost four years. 

With the latest comeback series out of the way, Sourav is now focusing on the Ranji final versus Mumbai, from Friday.

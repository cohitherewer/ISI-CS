 Mushtaq back 

Karachi: In a major flip-flop, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has reinstated former leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed as assistant coach of the South Africa-bound squad. 

Mushtaqs reinstatement came just three months after PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf had unceremoniously removed him a day after taking over the reins from Shaharyar Khan ahead of the Champions Trophy. 

Dr Ashraf announced in Lahore that Mushtaq was back as the assistant coach because his cricketing knowledge had impressed him and he was sure the leg-spinner could do a lot of good work with the team. (PTI)

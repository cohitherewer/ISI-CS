 Fifa talks tough on rogue agents

Fifa pledged on Saturday to weed out corrupt agents in the wake of the Stevens inquiry, with new restrictions likely to be in place by the start of next year. 

Twenty-four hours after Lord Stevens final report was released, the governing body said the findings could have serious repercussions in terms of monitoring the activities of agents worldwide. 

This is a very serious conclusion, said Fifa treasurer Matthieu Sprengers. 

The report will now come to Fifa and we will deal with it. Legally, the 15 (agents implicated in the report) could be prosecuted because we granted their licences so we have the power to withdraw them. But whether Fifa goes this far is not up to me, its up to our disciplinary authorities. 

Sprengers recently announced a string of proposals to monitor agents more thoroughly after conducting a two-year study into their transfer dealings. He wants their role defined more clearly, with a limit of three per cent on all fees taken from each deal. 

Under the new restrictions, licences will be issued for a restricted period and agents will have to re-apply after a certain time.The new restrictions have the support of Fifa president Sepp Blatter, who believes agents activities are increasingly going unchecked.

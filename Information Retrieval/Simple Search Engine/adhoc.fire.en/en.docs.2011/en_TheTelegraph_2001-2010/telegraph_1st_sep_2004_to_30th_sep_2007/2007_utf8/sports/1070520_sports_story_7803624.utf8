 Sachin, Sourav light up dull Day II

NILESH BHATTACHARYA 

Chittagong: Sourav Ganguly came out in shorts around noon and started shadow-practising on the pitch, focus firmly on the unfinished job. Rahul Dravid joined him sometime later, and the duo got down to inspecting the pitch. 

Overnight rain and early morning drizzle meant the start of Day 2 was delayed and India needed to change strategy. The sun had started peeping through the clouds by then, but poor drainage and a muddy outfield seemed to have put a spanner in Indias winning chances. 

The brief presence of the captain and his predecessor in the middle, captured the mood of the day: two helpless figures, kept waiting in pursuit of team and individual goals. 

Umpires Daryl Harper and Billy Doctrove finally ruled that play could start at 4.30 pm (local time), with an attempt to squeeze in 23 overs in the extended final session. 

Sourav, resuming on 82, took 31 balls to reach century No. 13. Sachin Tendulkar, who was on 80, needed one ball less to record his 36th Test hundred. They perished immediately after reaching the milestones, and India finished the second day on 384 for six. 

With the local met office predicting an overcast Sunday, the runs on board and time left hardly looked enough to bring the smile back on the captains face. 

For the record, Sachin and Sourav added 189 for the fourth wicket. 

Play will start half-an-hour early the last three days to make up for lost time. But a winning start in the Test series against Bangladesh looks as bleak as the sky and unless Habibul Bashars side commits harakiri on a batting beauty, the match is set to end in a stalemate. 

The need of the hour dictated Sachin and Souravs approach once play got underway. They went on the offensive from the beginning. The southpaw pulled Shahadat Hossain for four as India raced past 300. He then straight-drove Mohammed Rafique to move into the 90s. 

The much-awaited century came in the 84th over, two overs after Bashar took the new ball. As Sourav attempted to pull Shahadat again it was a one-handed shot the ball landed in the unmarked short thirdman region. 

Sourav scampered towards the other end, looked up and towards the dressing room relief writ large on his face. Sharad Pawar and Co., watching the match from the VIP box, stood up to acknowledge the effort. 

Much water has flown down the Ganges since he achieved the three-figure mark the last time against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo in September, 2005. He lost his captaincy thereafter, then his place in the team which he regained after a long and eventful emotional journey. His 100 on Saturday, following success in South Africa in the last Test series, speaks volumes of his desire, determination and dedication. 

It was also an emotional moment for Sachin. Subjected to public jeers back home following the World Cup debacle and with questions being raised over his future, Sachin resorted to what he has been doing for the past 17 years: letting his willow do the talking. 

The duo was dismissed in quick succession in almost similar fashion trying to bludgeon the bowler around mid-wicket. Sourav fell to Mashrafe Mortaza and Sachin to Shahadat. Both seniors had won their personal battles by the time they had gone back to the dressing room. 

Mahendra Singh Dhonis arrival at the crease signalled an urgency to wrest the initiative, keeping in mind the fickle weather. The dashing wicketkeeper remained unbeaten on 36 off 35 balls and holds the key to an aggressive session early on Day III. 

 A quick declaration is expected from Dravid, may be 

 after the first session on Sunday. Thereafter, India will 

 have to battle against Bashar amp; Co., the placid pitch 

 and the vagaries of nature.

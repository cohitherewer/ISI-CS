 Were on track, says Fleming

 World Cup 

Perth: Buoyed by his sides first win in the tri-series, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming believes his team is poised to build momentum as the World Cup approaches. 

Weve been doing a lot of good things off the field, but it has been worth nothing because our performances have let all that down, he said Tuesday. 

It has been pretty frustrating for all the people at home because we have played a pretty poor brand of cricket. 

Fleming, whose captaincy was also criticised by former teammate Adam Parore, said he believed the win over England, with powerful allrounder Oram returning from injury with a Man-of-the-Match performance, showed the Black Caps were on the right track. 

We are hoping to get a couple more (wins) and then get a little bit of momentum towards the end of this tournament, he said.

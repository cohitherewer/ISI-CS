The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Direct entry for 4 new teams

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Friday made another move towards corporatising Indian football by providing direct entry to four teams in the Second Division Professional Football League. 

Newly-formed Mumbai Football Club (backed by Essel Group), yet to be floated Poona Football Club (Piramal Group) and New Delhi Heroes (Osian Group) alongwith ONGC are the four corporate clubs, who will feature in the Second Division League, regardless of their strength and form this season. 

The only criteria the AIFF has set for these new teams is affiliation to their respective state associations and meeting the club licensing criteria. Other clubs who apply for entry in the second division Pro League will also have to meet these criteria, AIFF said in a statement after the executive committee meeting here. 

However, the two clubs demoted from the Premier division last year and the four clubs that finished between third to sixth place in the second division, have also been given direct entries, irrespecitve of their performances in the state leagues. Thus the decks for Mohammedan Sporting and Chirag United SC have been cleared. 

The AIFF once again failed to decide on the venue for the Federation Cup, which is expected to be played between September 4 and 15. 

Four states Kerala, Punjab, Orissa and Assam are in the running to host the tournament. It will only be decided after AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco inspects all the possible venues.

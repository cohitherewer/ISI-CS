London: Anil Kumbles dream maiden century and Mahendra Singh Dhonis pyrotechnics left the spectre of a follow-on looming large over England as India had the hosts on the mat on Day II of the third and final Test here on Friday. 

On a belter of a strip at the Oval, Indian batsmen sent the hosts on a leather-hunt and posted a mammoth 664 in their first essay. 

In reply, Michael Vaughans beleaguered side was 24 for one at stumps with Alastair Cook (12) and nightwatchman James Anderson (5) at the crease. Zaheer Khan removed Andrew Strauss (6) to draw first blood for India, which left the hosts needing 441 runs more to avoid follow-on. 

India are already 1-0 up in the three-match series. 

The day belonged to Kumble, the No.8 batsman, who not only top-scored with an unbeaten 110 but also broke a jinx of sort by posting the first century by an Indian in the ongoing series. 

Kumble was on 67 when last man Sreesanth (35) joined him and the duo shared a 73-run last wicket stand to author a thrilling climax. 

The Indian dressing room erupted as Kumble scrambled to the magic figure. He had charged out only to bottom-edge a Kevin Pietersen delivery and then dived to get back to the crease as the ball went past wicketkeeper Matt Prior, for the umpteenth time, for a four. 

Kumble remained unbeaten after a memorable knock during which he faced 193 balls and hit 16 boundaries and a six. 

Earlier, Dinesh Karthik (91), Dhoni (92) and Sachin Tendulkar (82) had come close to their individual century before failing in their bid. 

As if the Indian run-feast was not enough, the hosts conceded 54 extra runs to make things worse. 

Resuming on 316 for four, India on Friday cruised along as Dhoni batted with customary disdain while Tendulkar played a dour knock. 

Dhoni hit four towering sixes and nine blazing fours to score 92 off just 81 balls before being caught in the deep off Pietersen. 

He added 97 runs in just 68 minutes off 107 balls for the seventh wicket with Kumble, who stuck it out gamely to frustrate England. 

In the morning, Tendulkar struggled a bit before he played a beautiful straight drive and a gorgeous cover drive off Anderson. 

However, just when he looked set for a century, Tendulkar poked at a ball outside the off stump in the same over for Strauss to take an easy catch at first slip. 

Tendulkar spent just a minute short of five hours during which he faced 192 balls and hit 11 fours. He added 78 runs with V.V.S. Laxman (51) for the fifth wicket before adding another 63 runs in just 51 minutes with Dhoni for the sixth wicket. 

While Tendulkar displayed a big heart for the battle, Laxman helped himself to some delicious boundaries off Anderson. Dropped by Prior on 41, Laxman reached his half-century pulling Chris Tremlett to the fence. He got out almost immediately. 

Dhoni walked out confidently and immediately imposed his will upon the bowling, getting off the mark with a fierce cut to the fence off Tremlett. 

When Monty Panesar was introduced into the attack, Dhoni punished his first ball, a full toss. 

 Meanwhile, Englands problems 

 deepened when their reliable left-arm swing bowler Ryan 

 Sidebottom had to go to hospital for a scan on a sore left 

 side.

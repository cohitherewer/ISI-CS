 Full-strength Lanka may take on Ireland

St. Georges: Irelands hopes for a farewell victory at the World Cup look slim. 

Sri Lanka were beaten by seven wickets by Australia on Monday but had already qualified for the semi-finals so rested two players against the defending champions. 

Muttiah Muralidharan, the worlds leading spin bowler, and the experienced Chaminda Vaas are likely to return for Wednesdays Super Eight match at Grenada National Stadium and could easily tear through an Ireland batting line-up still inexperienced against the worlds best bowlers. 

If that wasnt bad enough, Lasith Malinga who topped the tournament bowling charts before damaging ankle ligaments almost two weeks ago may return from injury to prove his fitness for the semi-finals. If they want to have a go against Ireland, it wont be that tough a game, Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene said. They can easily come back into things before the semi-final. 

Jayawardenes decision to rest Muralidharan and Vaas led to a second-string attack taking on an in-form Australia batting line-up. 

The heavy defeat that followed left Jayawardene with the task of lifting his players before a crucial knockout game, almost certainly in Jamaica on April 24 against New Zealand. 

A workout against Ireland may be just what Sri Lanka need to rebuild momentum in its attempt for a first title since its surprise success of 1996. 

The first step was making sure the team got to the semi-finals with a fully fit squad. 

We couldnt sustain another injury like what happened to Lasith, Jayawardene said. These guys are key players and, going into the business end of the tournament, if these guys are not fit, we will look back and think, why did we not make those decisions? 

While the dangers of Muralidharan and his doosra are well known, Vaas took a record 23 wickets in a single World Cup in 2003. 

However, even with a full-strength team on show, Sri Lanka must not take victory against Ireland for granted. 

Having beaten two Test-playing nations Pakistan and Bangladesh Irelands formal status will change from a temporary ODI-playing nation to permanent. 

While Irelands batting line-up is modest, William Porterfield hit a stubborn 85 to set up victory over Bangladesh and fellow opener Jeremy Bray 115 not out against Zimbabwe. 

Boyd Rankin and Kyle McCallan have a respectable 21 wickets between them in the Caribbean and it was some rash shot-making against this attack that cost Bangladesh, who had exceeded expectations by beating India and South Africa at the tournament.

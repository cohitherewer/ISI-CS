 Zimbabwe omit Masakadza

Harare: Zimbabwe omitted experienced batsman Hamilton Masakadza from their World Cup squad on Wednesday. 

Eighteen-year-old Friday Kasteni, who made his debut in the recent home series against Bangladesh after Masakadza was dropped for the last match, won a place instead. 

Masakadza, who has 39 one-day caps, did his chances of selection little good by averaging just 14 against Bangladesh. 

The selectors felt he had not done enough to warrant selection, Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) media manager Lovemore Banda said. 

The squad for the tournament, starting in the West Indies next month, did not include former captain Tatenda Taibu, who quit Zimbabwe cricket in November 2005 after a contractual dispute. 

Banda denied that ZC had made recent attempts to lure Taibu, who now plays in Namibia, back to the fold. Our door is open to former players, but the board is not doing that (luring Taibu), he said.

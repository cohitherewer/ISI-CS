 Jeev up to tied 5th

Paris: A stunning series of five birdies in seven holes saw Jeev Milkha Singh zoom to tied fifth at the end of the third round of the Open de France Alstom. 

Jeev, tied 28th overnight, shot four-under 67 and is now three-under 210 after 54 holes. 

At four shots behind the leader Soren Hansen (66), Jeev now has an outside chance at the title. Hansens six-under 65 was the days best with Jeev coming second best. 

Jyoti Randhawa shot one-over 72 and slipped from tied eighth to tied 11th. 

Jeev opened with two pars and over the next seven holes he was four-under with five birdies and one bogey. One birdie and one bogey on the back nine saw him finish the day at 67. 

Jyoti had two bogeys and one birdie on the front nine and nine straight pars on the back nine in his 72 and is now one-under 212 for 54 holes. 

Jeev is tied fifth with Thomas Bjorn (71) and David Lynn (69). Shiv Kapur had missed the cut earlier. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bengal to open season versus Assam 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bengal will open their season against Assam in the All-India Moin-ud-Dowlah Gold Cup invitation tournament in Hyderabad on September 3. 

With less than a month to go for their season opener, coach Bharat Arun has already taken guard. On Monday, the coach interacted with the Bengal probables for the first time. After the meet in Hyderabad, the coach has plans for a Sri Lanka tour but it depends on an approval from Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC). 

Weve already written to (SLC) CEO Duleep Mendis and are awaiting a reply from their end. Were looking for the trip in the middle of September, said the CAB secretary Samar Paul. 

Arun, who is officially here for a BCCI Level-II course by the National Cricket Academy, will meet the players during his stay. He also has plans for net sessions with Deep Dasgupta amp; Co.. 

If weather permits, well have a few outdoor net sessions as well, Arun told The Telegraph. 

Over the next seven days, Ill be having one-on-one with four to five players daily to find their problem areas. That will, actually, help me assess where I do stand. 

A total of 19 BCCI Level-I coaches will attend the course.

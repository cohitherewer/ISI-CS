The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 CFL may take place sans Big 3 

JAYDEEP BASU 

New Delhi: Could anyone ever imagine Calcutta Football League (CFL) being played without Mohun Bagan, East Bengal or Mohammedan Sporting? Sounds absurd, but if the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has its way, the CFL from the 2007-08 season could be played without the three Calcutta majors. 

With the AIFF set to introduce the much-awaited Professional League from next season, the meeting for which will be held in the capital on Monday, there is a distinct possibility that CFL, considered the oldest competition in Asia, may lose much of its sheen. 

The AIFF, in its calendar, has proposed to start the Professional League from October this year. 

According to AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco, the teams which will feature in this competition may not be allowed to take part in their respective local leagues, be it in Calcutta, Goa, Maharashtra or Punjab. 

This is not an attempt to weaken the local competitions but to usher Indian football into the modern era. Both Fifa and AFC have said that a team cannot take part in two different leagues at a time, said Colaco. 

If Mohun Bagan, East Bengal or Mohammedan Sporting are a part of the Professional League, then they cannot play in the local league as well. After all, the local leagues, at the best, are only semi-professional leagues, Colaco pointed out. 

In the meeting, the AIFF is likely to make a proposal that the Calcutta giants will only be allowed to play in the CFL if they field a complete different set of players, either an amateur side or a junior team. 

Sensing that this proposal is likely to face stiff resistance from the both Bengal and Goa associations, the AIFF also has a second set of proposal in hand to introduce the Professional League. 

Under the alternative arrangement, top teams like Mohun Bagan or East Bengal can only play in the local league at the end of the season. 

Let the Calcutta or Goa league be played without these teams at the start of the season, Colaco said. 

Starting in October, the Professional League should be over by February. In March, the local associations are free to take these teams and play a kind of Super League along with three top finishers of the local league, the AIFF official maintained.

Professional league - a sneak peek 

 Under the proposal, there should be at least 14 or 16 teams in the Professional League beginning with the 2007-08 season. The Pro League should run for 10 months, parallel to the state league. The stress is on building up a pyramid structure from national to state level. 

 Each team in the Professional League should have a pool of 25 players. Among them 14 should have professional contracts and four of them should have two-year contracts. Five players should have the experience of playing in local league in the last three years. 

Teams playing in the Professional League wont be allowed to play in the state league. Each team must have an under-19 squad for the entire season. 

 Teams still willing to continue in the state league should field a different set of players mdash; either amateurs or junior players. Pro League teams will have to take permission from the federation from playing in any other all-India tournament.

 The new system will create a large pool of footballers. A huge number of under-19 players will get a chance to play at the national level.

 The new system also may severely hamper the flow of sponsorship at the local level. The local associations will have to make alternative arrangements to sustain attraction in the state league.

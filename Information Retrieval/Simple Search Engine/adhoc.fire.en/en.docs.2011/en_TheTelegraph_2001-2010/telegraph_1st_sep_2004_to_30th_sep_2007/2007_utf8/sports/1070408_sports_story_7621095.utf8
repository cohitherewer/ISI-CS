Calcutta: Thanks to Marques Edmilsons brace, East Bengal kept their hopes of winning the ONGC National Football League with a 2-1 win over Mohammedan Sporting in a 12th round match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. 

The three-time champions now have 22 points from 12 matches. Mahindra United have 23 points from 12, while Dempo are on 20 from 11 outings. 

The scores were 1-1 inside the first nine minutes. Edmilson Marques put the red-and-golds ahead in the fourth and Mohammedan Sporting equalising through Jatin Bist in the ninth. The Brazilian restored his sides lead eight minutes from full time, leaving no scope for the black-and-whites to make a comeback. 

Edmilson had scored a brace in East Bengals 3-2 victory over HASC as well, on Wednesday. 

 It cannot be said that Mohammedan Sporting played badly and lost the match. Though they couldnt perform like they did against Dempo, their planning and execution were very close to perfection on Saturday. 

East Bengal drew the first blood after Edmilson slotted home from a Boniface Ambani square pass. But they could enjoy the lead for more than five minutes as Preston dodged past Suresh inside the penalty box and setting it up for Jatin to do the rest. Jatin made no mistake to restore parity. 

Locked 1-1 at the breather, both teams looked to play safer than trying to clinch the winner. But as soon as game grew older, the inexperienced Mohammedan Sporting defence started making mistakes and one of those was capitalised by Man-of-the-Match Edmilson in the 82nd minute. 

Sureshs long through intended for Edmilson landed inside the penalty box. Edmilson cordoned by Madhab Das and Eric Bolwe Mputu unleashed a diagonal grounder that found the far post target. 

There were occasions when Mohammedan Sporting players marched up to the box but failed to do the needful and that kept them on 10 points from 12 matches. East Bengal defence sans Covan Lawrence didnt look out of shape barring few hiccups.

 Will Woolmer continue as Pak coach?

Karachi: Has Bob Woolmer finally decided to call it quits with the PCB? 

This question is making the rounds in cricket circles of the country ever since Woolmer vacated his room at the National Cricket Academy in Lahore before leaving with the Pakistan squad for the World Cup in the West Indies. 

Woolmer has taken and sent all his belongings back to South Africa. He used to leave those in his room or at the NCA even when he went abroad for vacations after taking over as coach in June 2004, a source in the Board said. 

The indications certainly are that Woolmer has either decided not to continue as coach of Pakistan after the World Cup or has got a signal that the Board is not interested in retaining his services after the tournament, the source said. 

Woolmers contract with the PCB expires in June. After the World Cup, Pakistan is likely to have one more international assignment a tri-series or a bilateral one-day rubber against Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi in May. 

The source said the PCB had also recently handed over the room used by Woolmer, which used to be locked when he was away, to a representative of the Caricom who had come down to Lahore recently in connection with the satellite visa issuance cell in Pakistan. 

Yes, the Caricom official set up his office and stayed in Woolmers room since it was empty, said the source. 

However, sources said that the PCBs decision to end Woolmers contract would depend largely on how the team performed in the World Cup.

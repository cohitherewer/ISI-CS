Centurion: Hashim Amla and Jacques Kallis steered South Africa to a comfortable win in the first Test against Pakistan on Monday. 

South Africa, who were chasing 199 to win, reached the target after losing three wickets with 40 minutes to go before the scheduled tea interval on the fifth day. 

Pakistan were dismissed for 313 in their first innings, to which South Africa replied with 417. 

Pakistan were bowled out for 302 in their second innings. 

Amla was 64 not out with Kallis on 60 in a stand of 119 for the unbroken fourth wicket. 

The partnership was a record for South Africas fourth wicket against Pakistan, surpassing the 108 that Gary Kirsten and Herschelle Gibbs shared in Faisalabad in 2003-04. 

South Africa batted very well in the last innings, Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq said. We will be better in the next Test because we have had some practice on South African pitches now. 

South Africa resumed on 69 for two after morning rain delayed the start of play by 45 minutes. 

Nightwatchman Paul Harris, who scored seven, was the only casualty of the final days play. 

Harris was dismissed in the sixth over of the day when he drove a delivery from fast bowler Mohammed Asif into the hands of Faisal Iqbal in the covers. 

Amla and Kallis batted cautiously but they scored steadily to take South Africa to a convincing victory. 

I thought for a while that maybe Paul and I could get South Africa home, joked Amla. But then it was great to be able to bat with Jacques. He is such a steadying influence. 

Asif had figures of two for 56 off 14 overs, but he bowled nine no-balls to follow his 15 in the first innings. 

The second Test starts in Port Elizabeth on Friday. 

Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq said there would be three or four changes in the side for the second Test. 

We will come back hard, warned Inzamam after the defeat. 

Inzamam pointed out that Pakistan were below strength because of the absence of star batsman Mohammed Yousuf and an injury to fast bowler Umar Gul. 

He said Yousuf, who arrived in South Africa following the birth of his daughter in Pakistan, would strengthen the batting, while he said Gul was making good progress. He bowled five overs in the nets today and we hope he will be ready to play. 

Fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar is also expected to come into contention. He joined the touring party as cover for Gul but only arrived the day before the first Test. 

South African captain Graeme Smith hailed his sides third win in as many weeks. We had to work really hard in the middle of the match. Smith said the pitch had not suited South Africas fast bowlers. 

We joked that last week (against India in Cape Town) we won at Eden Gardens and this week we won in Lahore, said Smith. 

The wickets havent been natural South African wickets where our fast bowlers have been able to bowl their natural lines.

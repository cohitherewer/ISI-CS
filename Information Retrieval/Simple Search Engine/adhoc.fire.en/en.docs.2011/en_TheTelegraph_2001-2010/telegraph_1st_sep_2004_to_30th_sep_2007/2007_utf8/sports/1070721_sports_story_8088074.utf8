The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Hope the dark days are over

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Hoping his dark days were now over, Jagmohan Dalmiya on Friday sent out a warning to the BCCI: get ready for a barrage of bouncers. 

Drawing strength from the Calcutta high court order staying his suspension from the BCCI, Dalmiya hinted at settling scores with those who subjected him to coercion and torture. 

Its now my turn to see how I can come clean in public. I must say this is the beginning and there will be more to come. Make no mistake, I will fight till the end, Dalmiya said at a press conference. 

Insisting that his stand was vindicated by the court order and truth has prevailed, Dalmiya said: The present BCCI administration was hell bent on expelling me for perhaps this life, that life or 100 lives Im leaving it to your guesswork. But Im happy that truth has finally prevailed and it only goes on to prove that the judiciary in India is still vibrant. 

He claimed that the BCCI had taken a beating in three cases against him. First, it took a beating before the Bombay High Court in connection with the criminal case lodged against me. Thereafter the Supreme Court upheld the order of the Bombay High Court and this time I have got a huge relief from the Calcutta high court, he said. 

Dalmiya also pointed out that he had resigned as the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president in order to save it from fear psychosis. 

After taking the illegal decision to expel me, they (the BCCI) wrote a letter to the CAB on December 17 dictating that I couldnt continue as president. I could have fought and might not have resigned as the CAB president. 

But the BCCI mandarins were hell bent on coercing and taking the association to ransom. A fear psychosis was created. The CAB was made a victim by the board and therefore I chose to resign, the former BCCI president said. 

Why was he not fighting for the CAB presidents post now? Dalmiya said he was looking for a bigger battle. 

Right now, the CAB is not on my mind. My focus is on the BCCI, he explained. 

Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, reacting to the developments, said: I do not know (about the order), nor do I want to know I am not interested.

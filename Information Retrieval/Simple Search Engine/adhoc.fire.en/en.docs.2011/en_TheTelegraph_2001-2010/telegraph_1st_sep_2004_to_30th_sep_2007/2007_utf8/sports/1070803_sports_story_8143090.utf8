 Sreesanth should play by the rules, says Prasad

 - It will take time for Dhoni to adapt to English conditions: Robin 

 Venkatesh Prasad 

Leicester: Team India bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad Thursday admitted that Sreesanths on-field antics were becoming a bit of a concern and the pacer needed to respect the game and play by the rules. 

Prasad acknowledged that he was concerned with the way Sreesanth has gone about his business in the first two Tests against England. 

Not only has Sreesanth looked a shadow of the bowler he was in South Africa but his behaviour on the pitch too have raised a few eye brows. 

He is young and aggressive but the time has come when he needs to focus more on his cricket. You got to respect the game and play by the rules, Prasad said. 

The Kerala bowler was fined 50 per cent of his match fee during Indias seven-wicket second Test win for shoulder barging England captain Michael Vaughan. 

He also let loose a furious beamer at Kevin Pietersen, for which he immediately apologised, and bowled a bouncer at Paul Collingwood off a no-ball after overstepping the crease by several feet. 

Skipper Rahul Dravid has assured that the pacer would be spoken to on the matter 

Its part of our responsibility to try to ensure he learns. He (Sreesanth) will be spoken to, Dravid had said at the end of the Trent Bridge Test. 

Vaughan also expressed his concern on Sreesanths conduct. 

A beamer was bowled and he said it was an accident and we take his word for that. I guess more of a concern is a huge no-ball. 

Sreesanth is young and a real good talent but I hope he didnt bowl a two foot over the line no-ball to try to intimidate the batsman. Its a tactic which could be used in most games and its not what we want to see, he said. 

Prasad, however, defended Sreesanth on the beamer to Pietersen, saying that it had slipped out of his hands while the no ball was because of a wrong jump. 

Prasad asserted that India had the attack to bowl out any side twice. 

Singling out R.P. Singh, Prasad said the pacer got the crucial breakthroughs, which turned the match in Indias favour at Trent Bridge. 

You got to give him credit because he got the key wickets of Kevin Pietersen and Matt Prior in the second innings at Trent Bridge, he said. 

Unfazed by Mahendra Singh Dhonis less than impressive show behind the stumps so far, fielding coach Robin Singh said it would take time for the wicketkeeper to adapt to the tough English conditions. 

Dhoni has not lost his confidence and not dropped any catches. He has done reasonably well. The conditions havent been easy, robin said. 

Even Prior (England wicketkeeper) has been struggling. So we are not overly concerned about Dhonis keeping, he added. 

On the three-day tour game against Sri Lanka starting Friday, Robin said the team was keen to maintain its rhythm. 

Some of the seniors might be rested for this game which throws a wonderful opportunity for the bench players to prove themselves, he said. 

However, he refused to give the combination.

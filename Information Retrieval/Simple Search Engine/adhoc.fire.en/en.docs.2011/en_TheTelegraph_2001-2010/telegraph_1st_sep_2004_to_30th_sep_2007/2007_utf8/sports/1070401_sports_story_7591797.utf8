 Ponting roots for Windies

St Johns: Australia captain Ricky Ponting fears the already small turnout at the World Cup will be further reduced if hosts West Indies fail to reach the semi-finals. 

Only 9,000 turned up at the 19,000-capacity Sir Vivian Richards Stadium for the first day of Australias rain-interrupted 103-run win against the West Indies on Tuesday for what was one of the showpiece games of the tournament. 

I guess it would be great for the Caribbean if the West Indies could make it through to the final stages of the tournament, said Ponting. 

One thing I havent understood either is the crowd support in the last couple of games. (AFP)

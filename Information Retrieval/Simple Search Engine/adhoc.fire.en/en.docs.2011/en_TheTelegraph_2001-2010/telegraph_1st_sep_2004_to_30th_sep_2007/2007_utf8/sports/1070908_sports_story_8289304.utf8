 Kalmadi to meet Aiyer

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Indian Olympic Association president Suresh Kalmadi on Friday flayed the Sports Policy and said he would meet the sports minister Mani Shankar Aiyer in the first week of October to discus the whole thing. 

Coming down heavily on the proposed Sports Policy, he said a bunch of cartoons have drafted the policy. No one was consulted, not even senior sports administrators, legendary sportspersons or Arjuna awardees. All they did was to draft it and put on the net. We are not boycotting it but their attitude is simply shocking, Kalmadi said. 

IOA officials are planning to meet national sports federations, state Olympic associations and top sportspersons before meeting the sports minister. 

There is no ego clash involved in it. I have already written to the minister in this regard, Kalmadi said. 

Both Kalmadi and Aiyer are involved in a war of words for the past few months, especially after the latter publicly criticised the IOA decision to host the Commonwealth Games and bid for the 2014 Asian Games.

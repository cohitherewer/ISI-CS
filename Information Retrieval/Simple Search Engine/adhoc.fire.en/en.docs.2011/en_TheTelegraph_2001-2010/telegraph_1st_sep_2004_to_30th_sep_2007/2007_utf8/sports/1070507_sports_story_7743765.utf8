 De la Hoya falls to 

Mayweather 

Las Vegas: Floyd Mayweather Jr registered a split decision victory over Oscar de la Hoya to claim the World Boxing Council super welterweight title on Saturday before announcing his retirement. 

In a fight expected to be one of the highest-grossing in boxing history, Mayweather won a tight verdict from two of the three judges to improve his career record to 38-0 with 24 knockouts. The American defended skilfully early on before imposing himself in the later rounds with his powerful right, his speed and several telling combinations. 

Mayweather connected with a thumping right and left early in the 12th and final round before a flurry of close-range punches from both fighters ended the bout in front of a capacity crowd of 16,200 at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino. (REUTERS)

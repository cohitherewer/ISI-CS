The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Award in memory of Sardesai

 Dilip Sardesai 

Mumbai: The BCCI on Wednesday announced that the best Indian batsman during the Test series between India and the West Indies henceforth would receive the Dilip Sardesai Award in memory of the former cricketer who died here on July 2. 

A decision to this effect was communicated to Sardesais family by BCCI president Sharad Pawar during a condolence meeting organised jointly by the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) and the Cricket Club of India (CCI) here. 

Pawar, who is also the MCA president, also said in the that the association would bear the expenses of an under-19 Mumbai cricketer annually to undergo a three to four-week training at the Australian Cricket Academy. 

The Goa Cricket Association also announced that a stand would be named after the Margao-born Sardesai in the new stadium being built in Goa. 

On its part the CCI decided to have a permanent net in Sardesais name besides naming the prawn curry dish in its restaurants menu as Dilip Sardesai Prawn Curry. 

In the condolence meeting, Ajit Wadekar revealed for the first time how his captaincy was saved by the superlative deeds of Sardesai on the 1971 tour to the West Indies after he had been given an order to perform or perish by the then selection panel chief Vijay Merchant. 

I wanted Dilip as he was considered a lucky mascot (with Mumbai not losing any match with him in the team) not only because of our partnerships but also for his guidance as it was my first stint as India captain, Wadekar said. 

 It was his 212 at Jamaica that gave us the confidence for the rest of the tour, said Wadekar. 

Had India lost I would have lost my captaincy but we won in England too and I continued as captain for three more years, Wadekar said.

 Bucknor may get fifth straight final

 Steve Bucknor

Bridgetown: Jamaican umpire Steve Bucknor may officiate his fifth successive World Cup final after being named as one of four umpires in semi-finals this week in Kingston and Gros Islet, as reported in Mondays Late City edition. 

South Africas Rudi Koertzen and Australias Simon Taufel will officiate in Tuesdays semi-final in Kingston between New Zealand and Sri Lanka while Bucknor and Pakistans Aleem Dar will take charge of the Gros Islet match between Australia and South Africa. 

Umpires are not allowed to take charge of matches involving their own countries. 

Either Koertzen or Taufel will miss out on the final because Australia or South Africa will play in the April 28 match at Kensington Oval, Barbados. 

Bucknor officiated his first final between Pakistan and England in Melbourne in 1992. Four years later, the World Cup panel chose him for the Sri Lanka vs Australia final in Lahore. In 1999, he and David Shepherd of England stood in the final between Australia and Pakistan at Lords. He returned in Johannesburg, four years ago, again alongside Shepherd, when Australia faced India. 

The umpires for the first semi-final will be assisted by TV umpire Daryl Harper, Australia, and fourth umpire Asad Rauf, Pakistan. Mike Procter of South Africa will be the Match Referee. In Gros Islet, New Zealander Billy Bowden will be TV umpire, Mark Benson of England the fourth umpire, and Jeff Crowe of New Zealand the Match Referee.

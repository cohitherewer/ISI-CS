 ...But we will go for a win, says Houghton

 - NEHRU CUP

 - A draw will be enough...

 Rennedy is set to replace Miranda in the XI today 

New Delhi: India could face a difficult situation on the pitch when they play Kyrgyzstan in a crucial Nehru Cup encounter at the floodlit Ambedkar Stadium on Sunday. 

To aim for a draw can be a tricky tactic to adopt but that is precisely what the hosts need to enter the final of this tournament for the first time. 

Kyrgyzstan, on the other hand, have their tasks cut out. Given the goal difference, they must win. 

Fortunately for India, no one understands the team better than Bob Houghton. The national coach has given strict instructions to the boys to forget the league table and just follow the attacking pattern they have displayed in the last three matches. 

He never indulges in any negative talks with the boys, said a team member. He talked about winning, attacking patterns and strong and weak points of the rivals. Never for a moment did he discuss the possibility of playing for a draw. 

We are going for a win, said Houghton after the practice session. I think our boys are capable of victory. I would be disappointed if we dont reach the final. We will play the same attacking brand of football we played so far in this tournament. 

The British coach cannot be accused of over expectations. Even against Syria, when the Indian defence was found wanting, he never allowed the flow of attacks to dry up. 

Given their current form, India are certainly the favourites, but Kyrgyzstan cannot be taken lightly. The Central Asian nation, who have dramatically slipped behind India in the Fifa rankings during the course of the Nehru Cup, have a young team which possess enough firepower to put the Indian defence in trouble. 

In three matches, Kyrgyzstan have scored eight goals. Couple of players like Lut Fullaev and Vadim Harchenko are brilliant ball players, who are capable of splitting any defence. 

Houghton knows it. He has decided to field Rennedy Singh in place of Clifford Miranda on Sunday. Thats the only change in the team, he confirmed. Rennedys defensive quality is better. Clifford might come in later in the match. 

Defence is Kyrgyzstans weakest area. It could be Indias biggest advantage. While young Sunil Chhetri has been improving in every match, the time now is ripe for Bhaichung Bhutia to lead from the front.

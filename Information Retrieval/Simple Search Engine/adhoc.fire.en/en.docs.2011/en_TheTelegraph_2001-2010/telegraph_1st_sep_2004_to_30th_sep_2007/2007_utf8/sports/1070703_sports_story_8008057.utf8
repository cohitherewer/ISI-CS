 Brazil ride Robinho hattrick

Maturin, (Venezuela): Robinho scored 

 a hattrick to give Brazil a badly-needed 3-0 Copa America 

 win over Chile on Sunday, while Mexico reached the quarter 

 finals after beating Ecuador 2-1. 

Mexicos win, which started with another goal by striker Nery Castillo, made them the first team to reach the final eight of the tournament. 

They lead Group B with six points, followed by Brazil and Chile on three. Ecuador are virtually out of the running after two defeats. 

The 52,000-capacity Monumental Stadium, built from scratch in less than a year, was ruled fit to stage the games even though it was clearly not ready. 

The fans inside the ground were treated to Robinho at his best although Brazil needed a controversial penalty to get off the mark in the 36th minute. 

Paraguayan referee Carlos Torres apparently gave the kick for pushing and Robinho calmly scored with a low shot amid Chilean protests. 

Chile squandered several chances to equalise after half-time before Robinho added two more in the last ten minutes. He latched on to Vagner Loves pass to chip the ball over Claudio Bravo in the 84th minute and was on target again after a dazzling 40-metre run three minutes later. 

Chile coach Nelson Acosta, whose team have conceded 12 goals and scored none in their last three meetings with Brazil, was unimpressed. 

Brazil coach Dunga, however, preferred to distribute the praise among his players rather than concentrate on the Real Madrid player. 

We played competitive football, he said. It was a tough game, they played with two lines of four and we didnt have any space until they came out in the second half. 

Brazil play attacking football, he said. When you chase the game, you create spaces for the opposition. 

We have to take risks, to expose ourselves. Fortunately we have quality players who make the difference. 

In the second match of the double bill, Castillo scored the first one in the 22nd minute while Omar Bravo headed home the second in the 80th minute.

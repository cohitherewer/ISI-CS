 Draw seals Bangladesh fate

New Delhi: Syed Nayeemuddins Bangladesh were held 1-1 by lowly Cambodia at the floodlit Ambedkar Stadium here on Wednesday. 

Bangladesh and Cambodia have one point each and are out of contention for a berth in the final of the ONGC Nehru Cup. While Bangladesh play Kyrgyzstan in their last match, Cambodia take on mighty Syria. 

Bangladesh could have earned full points had Nayeemuddins boys done better with shots at goal. Bangladesh, who scored in the 30th minute, opened up the Cambodian citadel a number of times, only to be let down by poor finishing. 

Their goal was the result of a fine effort by Abul Hossain. The corner by Alfaz Ahmed landed perfectly inside the box and Hossain came up with an angular header to find the target. 

The spirit Cambodia displayed against Kyrgyzstan was missing on Wednesday. Key midfielder Hok Sotiiyas inability to control the midfield was perhaps the reason. He was bottled up by zonal marking and had to be replaced in the 67th minute. 

Substitute Keo Kosal got the equaliser a minute before the final whistle to spoil the Bangladesh party. 

This Bangladesh team is perhaps one of the weakest to come to India in recent years. Nayeemuddin said the team was in the process of rebuilding and hoped to do much better in the coming months. In this tournament, however, he had little on offer for the spectators.

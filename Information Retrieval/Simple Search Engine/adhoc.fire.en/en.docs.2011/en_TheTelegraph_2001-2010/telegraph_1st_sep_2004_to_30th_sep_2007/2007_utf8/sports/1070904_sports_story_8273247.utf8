 Nadals knees have easy day

LYNN ZINSER

Novak Djokovic scrambled across the court in pursuit of a volley he had no chance of retrieving, saved himself from a full-speed collision with a television camera by the slimmest of margins, and laughed when he finally came to a stop. 

He lost a meaningless point late in a match he was winning with ease on Sunday night at the US Open, but Djokovic had traded deft little volleys with Juan MartDel Potro and simply could not give up on the last one. So he scrambled and he smiled and he thoroughly enjoyed his first-ever night match at the Arthur Ashe Stadium. 

It was fantastic, you know, Djokovic said. Its a new experience for me and, you know, it was a lot of excitement. Playing at the biggest court in tennis, it was something new and something I never experienced.Djokovics 6-1, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Del Potro, moved him into the fourth round. 

It also moved Djokovic, the No. 3 seed, one step closer to a potential semi-final match-up with Rafael Nadal, who had nearly as easy a time with his third-round opponent, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France. It took Nadal a little more than two hours to win 7-6, 6-2, 6-1. 

As in his first two matches, the biggest drama surrounded the health of Nadals much-discussed knees, which have tendinitis and are being treated with lasers three times a day. 

They held up well against Tsonga, whose big serve was only a threat in the first set. After that, Nadal criss-crossed the court with his usual athletic ease and ran Tsonga out of the match.

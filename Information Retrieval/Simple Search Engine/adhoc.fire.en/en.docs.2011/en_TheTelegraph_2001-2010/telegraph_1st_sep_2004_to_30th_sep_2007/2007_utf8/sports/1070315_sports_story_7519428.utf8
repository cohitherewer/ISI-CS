 India lose 0-1 to Thailand

Chennai: Thailand held on to a Teeratep Winothais early goal to score a 1-0 win over India in the pre-Olympic football qualifier Wednesday. 

This is Indias second loss in the qualifying group, having suffered a 0-3 defeat to Iraq in the first match. 

India were disorganised in the first half, but looked a better unit after the break. 

They made inroads into the rival goal area and made the defenders work overtime. 

It was also evident that the Thailand players did not enjoy the felicity that they had in the first half. 

However, despite some good moves from Sushil Singh and Manjit Singh upfront, the equaliser remained elusive. 

India conceded the goal in the ninth minute. Goalkeeper Subrata Paul initially blocked Winothais volley, but the latter reacted swiftly to snap up the rebound. (PTI)

Calcutta: Bengal made it two wins out of two in the National Twenty20 (East Zone) meet at the Eden. The 12-run win over Jharkhand on Wednesday put the hosts top of the heap. 

Mahendra Singh Dhoni failed for the second day running, as Jharkhand ended at 175 in reply to Bengals 187 for seven in 20 overs. The Team India stumper reached 12 off seven balls with two boundaries, before becoming one of Manoj Tewaris three victims. 

Tewari shone with the bat, too. The Bengal skipper smashed 58 off 31 balls to set up the healthy total. There were good contributions also from Rohan Gavaskar (47 off 33 balls) and Avishek Jhunjhunwala (41 not out off 28 balls). 

The top-scorer of the match, however, was Jharkhands Sourabh Tiwary. Unfortunately, his 69 off 33 balls (with four sixes and eight fours) was not enough for his team. 

Opting to bat first, Bengal lost Subhajit Paul to the first ball. But Gavaskar took charge and ensured there wont be a collapse. 

After Wriddhiman Saha fell cheaply, it was left to Tewari to play a gem. The Jharkhand bowlers had no answer to his sparkling strokeplay. Especially eye-catching were Tewaris lofted drives. 

Jhunjhunwala made his intentions clear from the moment he came in. He struck three fours and a pair of huge sixes Jhunjhunwala during his 28-ball essay. Santosh Lal claimed three for 23. 

Chasing a target of almost 9.5 runs an over, the Jharkhand openers began brightly, with Tiwary in great nick. His partner Manish Vardhan fell at 59. 

Dhoni, who came in at No. 3, was dismissed with the board reading 104. It looked curtains for Jharkhand, but young Tiwary kept Bengal under pressure.

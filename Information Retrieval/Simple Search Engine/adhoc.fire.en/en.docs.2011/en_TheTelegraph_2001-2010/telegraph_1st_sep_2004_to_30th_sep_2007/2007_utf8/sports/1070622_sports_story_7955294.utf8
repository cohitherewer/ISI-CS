 Galle may not be ready

Colombo: The tsunami-devastated Galle International Stadium may not be ready to host the first Test against England in December. 

A senior official connected with the redevelopment of the stadium said Galle could be ready to host the third and final match of the series, which is scheduled in Kandy. Work is going on in the stadium but it may take longer than anticipated to complete everything, he added. (AFP)

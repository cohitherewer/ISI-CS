 Shoaib calls for honest captain

Karachi: Fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar on Monday said there was a need to change the Pakistan teams dressing room culture with a captain who is honest and supportive of his players. 

My experience is that in the past instead of using me as a match-winner, some of the captains used to play matches with me, Shoaib said, in an apparent reference to Inzamam-ul Haq with whom he never had a smooth relationship. 

When you have a captain with an ego problem or one who is jealous of the performance of other players, then you have a major problem in the team. 

I think there is a need to change our dressing-room culture, he told a television channel. 

Shoaib said there was a need to have an honest captain. Imran Khan was our best leader because he was honest and expected the same from his players. He also didnt have any jealousy factor with him, he said. 

Cricketers, meanwhile, at the conditioning camp have been restricted from speaking to the media by manager Talat Ali after Shoaib Malik was misquoted in the local media.

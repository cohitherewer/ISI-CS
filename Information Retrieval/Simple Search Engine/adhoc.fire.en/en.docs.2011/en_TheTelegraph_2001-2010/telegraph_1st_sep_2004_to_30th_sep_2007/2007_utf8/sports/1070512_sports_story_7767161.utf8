 Kapil: Our youngsters learning fast

New Delhi: Former captain Kapil Dev feels that even though youngsters in the Indian team played well to fashion a victory in the one-day series opener against Bangladesh, they still had a long way to go. 

Referring to Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Dinesh Karthik, the 1983 World Cup winning captain said the youngsters were learning fast. 

They played well yesterday. Dinesh (Karthik) is a young boy and is learning fast. But still there is a long way to go, he said. 

The rapid improvement in the Bangladesh team also did not escape Kapils attention. 

They are really coming up well, giving good fight, he said. 

Asked about the sting operation by a private news channel, showing selectors talking about former coach Greg Chappells alleged divide and rule policy, Kapil said, It is past now I am bothered only about my team.

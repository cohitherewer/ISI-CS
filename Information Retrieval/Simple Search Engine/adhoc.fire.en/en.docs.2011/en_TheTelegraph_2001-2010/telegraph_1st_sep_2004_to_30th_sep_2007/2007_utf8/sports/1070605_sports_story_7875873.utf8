 Paris will always suffocate Mauresmo

Neil Harman

And so, on the first Saturday of the championships, it is au revoir to the French hopes of a singles triumph here. 

Patience is a virtue, but it was not quite enough to help Olivier Patience over another barrier of Serbian resistance that is Novak Djokovic, the fastest rising young male star in the game. Djokovic said that Patience, ranked No. 129 in the world and a wild card entrant, was the better player during a four-hour, five-set marathon that caused the ground to shift beneath Roland Garros the best match of the first week of the championships by the length of the Champs Elysee. 

Patiences virtuous play offered a vivid contrast to the ever-present shade of grey that stalks Amelie Mauresmo here. Sitting with Mauresmo at Devonshire Park in Eastbourne three years ago, after she had lost in the third round of the French Open a few days earlier, it seemed appropriate to commiserate with her that once more, the premier trophy a French native could win had eluded its premiere woman player. 

I said that she could see the French coastline with the aid of one of the beach-front telescopes but she said shed rather not. She said she felt comfortable in England, that the prying eyes had left her for a while and that she could really be herself. It is no surprise that she was to win both the Australian Open and then Wimbledon first and may well go on to complete a hattrick in New York. The French, you feel, will always be one labour too many. 

There is an urgency about the support for Mauresmo here that is almost suffocating. The freedom she feels elsewhere simply does not exist in these confines. You can sense it in the subtle changes of body language, the lack of clarity in her stroke making, the sense of inevitable gloom ahead. She was not helped this year by the need for an appendectomy in March that caused her to miss all the clay court training she really needed. 

Mauresmo came back to the tour after a two-month absence in Berlin, losing to Julia Vakulenko of the Ukraine and then to Samantha Stosur of Australia in three resonant sets in the Italian Open. Ive been struggling for weeks now and I didnt know what to expect when I came here, Mauresmo said. Ive had ups and downs for weeks, this is the result of a period of struggle. I find it difficult to recover what is my strength. 

I couldnt adjust my placement, I was late on the ball. Even though I realise that she [Lucy Safarova, the formidable Czech 20-year-old, to whom Mauresmo lost 6-3 7-6] hits the ball very early, I was still too late to it. But this is not worrying, theres certainly more worrying things than this [losing a tennis match] in life.

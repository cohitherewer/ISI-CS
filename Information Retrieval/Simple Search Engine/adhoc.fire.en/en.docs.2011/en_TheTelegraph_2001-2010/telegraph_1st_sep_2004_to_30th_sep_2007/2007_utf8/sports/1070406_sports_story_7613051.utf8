 Mahela: I dont want any more tight finishes 

St Johns: Sri Lanka went so close to beating South Africa after Lasith Malingas four wickets in four balls. They just couldnt get the last two men out. This time they almost lost to England off the last delivery. 

Sri Lankas two-run World Cup victory was sealed on the last-wicket dismissal of half-centurion Ravi Bopara by paceman Dilhara Fernando on Wednesday. The England batsman was looking for a boundary that would have completed a remarkable come-from-behind triumph. 

Instead Fernandos wicket left England two short at 233 for eight and Sri Lanka joined Australia and New Zealand at the top of the Super Eight. 

I dont want any more tight finishes like this, we should have clinched things earlier, said Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene, whose team now has two wins from three Super Eight matches. 

Were happy with the two points. We held our nerves in the end, but we committed a lot of mistakes and then tried to recover through some good cricket, Jayawardene said. 

I cant remember what I was thinking, every loose ball could have gone for runs. I just told Dilhara to bowl in good areas, it doesnt matter if you still go for runs. Weve got a lot of character in our team and we showed it today. 

Fernando later revealed it was his captains idea to bowl at block holes in the death which paid off. 

Ive been playing really well in the last few weeks, so I had a lot of confidence. Captain said me bowl at block holes and no slower at all. I just stuck to the basic and it paid off, he said. 

Jayawardene said he was not surprised by Englands rally. The Bopara-Paul Nixon partnership featured some unorthodox reverse-sweeps by the England wicketkeeper against ace spinner Muttiah Muralidharan. One went for a six and the other square for a boundary. 

Our focus was on getting wickets, we did not want the pair to stay for long, he said. They had enough overs and batted well for 15 overs to get where they did. 

When they had batted until the 46th over, the batsmen could take chances and we saw the result when Nixon reverse-swept Muralidharan for six. 

Jayawardene said Malingas final spell pulled Sri Lanka back on course for victory as he tied down the batsmen and also dismissed Nixon. We were pleased at going through Englands middle order, but it had an extra batsmen and that almost paid off, he said. 

England now head into Sundays crucial game against defending champions Australia, realising that another defeat could spell the end of their hopes of advancing to the semi-finals. (Agencies)

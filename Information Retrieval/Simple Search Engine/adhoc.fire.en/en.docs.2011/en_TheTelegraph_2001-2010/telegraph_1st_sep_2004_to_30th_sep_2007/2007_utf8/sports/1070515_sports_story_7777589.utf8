 Chhetri may bag NFL award 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

New Delhi: Like their clubs, Calcutta-based footballers too are set to return empty-handed from their campaign in the National Football League (NFL). 

According to sources, no footballer from Calcutta has been considered for the Best Player award in the 11 th edition of the NFL that will come to an end on Saturday. Instead, it is the diminutive JCT striker Sunil Chhetri, who is likely to bag the award, to be announced during the Super Cup match in Gurgaon on May 27. 

Last year, the award went to Indian footballs most recognisable face, Bhaichung Bhutia. Chhetri, originally from Delhi, is set to pip Churchill Brothers Nigerian striker Onyeka Okolie to the top spot as most of the NFL coaches have overwhelmingly voted for the JCT footballer. 

The AIFF, like it does every season, has sent out forms to all NFL coaches, requesting them to spell out their first three preferences for the best player. While Odafa, who is currently the top scorer in the NFL with 16 goals, also caught the eyes with his superb display, most coaches are likely to vote for a local player than a foreigner. 

Other than Chhetri and Odafa, the coaches have also shown their preferences for Dempo strikers Ranty Martins and Beto. Mohun Bagans Lalkamal Bhowmick is the only Calcutta footballer, who has received some votes for the best midfielder award.

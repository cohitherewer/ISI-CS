The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IN THE CITY

 Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) officials have sought copies of the referee and match commissioners reports as well as the minutes of Saturdays meeting from the IFA. The league sub-committee penalised CPT six points on the basis of the match officials reports of the August 28 Premier Division match against Peerless which was abandoned following an injury to Prasanta Dora. CPT were accused of refusing to continue the match because there was no doctor at the ground. We are sending copies of those letters on Thursday, said IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly.

 The IFA is planning a residential camp for the Bengal under-16 squad ahead of the nationals to be held in Uttarakhand from September 22. The weeklong camp will be held in Bolpur or Kalyani with 30 boys from which the final squad will be selected.

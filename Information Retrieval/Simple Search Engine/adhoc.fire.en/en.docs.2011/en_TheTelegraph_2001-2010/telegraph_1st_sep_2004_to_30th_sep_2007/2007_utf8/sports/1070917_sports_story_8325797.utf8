 Im not in a hurry: Ojha

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Its difficult for a left-arm spinner to make a mark at the highest level at a time when the likes of Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh are in full bloom. 

But Hyderabad spinner Pragyan Ojha doesnt want to concentrate on anything but performing consistently. He is not even looking forward to being selected in the India squad. 

I am not in a hurry. I just have to keep performing consistently the rest will follow. At this point, my focus is on our next match (at HPCA Stadium, Dharamsala from September 19-22), he told The Telegraph from New Delhi. 

If statistics count, then Ojha is currently at the peak of his career. Following a bountiful Ranji season 29 wickets off six matches the 21-year-old got his first India A break in Zimbabwe tour (on debut he got four wickets). 

But it was next tour (Kenya), where the Cuttack-based spinner caught the eyes. With 11 wickets (including a five-wicket haul against Sri Lanka A) in the triangular tournament (also involving Kenya), Ojha was at his best. 

Currently playing against South Africa A, his guile has already mesmerised the visitors, having claimed eight wickets in the first Test. 

Ojha idolises Venkatapathy Raju. I grew up watching him bowl. 

When hes referred to as a Hyderabadi spinner, Ojha gets disheartened: Im an Oriya, though I represent Hyderabad. But I dreamed to be called as an Indian spinner someday.

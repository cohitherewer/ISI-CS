Margao: It wasnt a fiery and livid Greg Chappell who held centrestage during an impromptu team meeting at the Nehru Stadium on Tuesday morning. No comparisons should be drawn with the public dressing down he gave the team in Ahmedabad during the Champions Trophy. 

Away from the prying media, the coach called the shots in one corner of the ground for close to 45 minutes in a cool and composed manner as the players sat around in a circle. With the selection of the World Cup XV out of the way, it was time to spell out strategies and chalk out fresh plans. 

The coach did not want to waste the opportunity of reminding the players of their responsibilities. The last two matches of the Hero Honda Cup will be their final chance to finetune and sort out the shortcomings ahead of the quadrennial showpiece. 

If the Sri Lankan side has a settled look, the Indians have posed more questions with lingering worries about fitness and form. For the likes of Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh, the selection is sure to give them assurance and the relaxed atmosphere should do them a world of good. 

For the left-hander, the venue will bring back some everlasting memories. Last April, he had singed England with a 76-ball 103, the last of his seven hundreds. Having made a comeback of sorts against the West Indies following a ligament tear during the Champions Trophy, Yuvraj missed the last two games because of back spasms. He fielded and batted well. We feel he is fit enough to be in the XII for tomorrows match. So we picked him, said Rahul Dravid. 

Sehwag managed a mere 19 on his return in Rajkot. Though he batted in the middle-order, the Indians are keeping their options open. Dravid only reiterated his belief in Sehwags abilities. I think Sehwag is just an innings away from coming good. If it happens tomorrow, great, otherwise well have to wait a little longer, said the Team India captain. 

Sourav Ganguly, with a bandaged left thumb the scars of an injury he picked up in Rajkot while trying to take a catch at second slip did appear in some discomfort at nets initially, but appeared at ease as the session wore on. The former India captain had a long bowling stint and is likely to play. 

The Indians have decided to leave out Anil Kumble, Irfan Pathan yet to recover from a sore shoulder and Sreesanth from the XII. Kumble went home because of personal reasons, as Dravid said, and is expected to be back before the start Wednesday. In all probability, Dinesh Karthik will be the 12th man. 

The Sri Lankans, enjoying a 1-0 lead, do not have much fitness worries except for Kumar Sangakkara. The Man-of-the-Match in Rajkot is down with a stomach bug and missed practice Tuesday morning. Its nothing serious as such. He should be okay tomorrow, said Jayawardene. 

The Indians are determined to forget the last match as a bad dream and start afresh. We will try to win here... In the last match we were in control till the 93rd-94th over. We wont make the same mistakes again. We learnt a few lessons from that match and wont repeat them again, Dravid remarked. 

We know what we have to do. We have to win both the games. Well now focus on winning this game. One at a time he added. 

As Chappell stressed during the team meeting, its important to get back into the winning ways. Its a habit and once things fall into place even the strongest of opponents can be dismissed in a flash. The momentum gained in the series versus the West Indies should not be surrendered. 

Therein lies the secret of going into the World Cup high on confidence.

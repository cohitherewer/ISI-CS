 Jeev outshines Tiger, Mickelson on Day I

Augusta: Indias Jeev Milkha Singh made a dream debut at the 71st US Masters, carding a creditable par 72 to end the first round at tied 10th on Thursday. 

The famed Augusta National Club bared its teeth and just 14 players shot par or under in the first Masters since 1999 to be played under optimal, dry conditions. 

Jeev, with four birdies and four bogeys, was three behind joint leaders Justin Rose and Brett Wetterich, who shot 69. 

Tiger Woods opened with a one-over 73. He has never bettered a 70 on the opening day in the 10 he has played at the Masters. He has won the green jacket four times. 

Phil Mickelson made a shaky start to his title defence and was languishing at tied 40th after carding a four-over 76. 

Jeev, the first Indian to qualify for the major, began with a six-foot par putt on the opening hole and had his first birdie on the fourth from 10 feet. 

Another couple of birdies and Jeev found himself on top of the leaderboard, albeit briefly. 

A bogey-free front nine with birdies on the third, sixth and eighth was followed by four bogies on the back. 

Jeev dropped a shot on 10th and 11th. On the 14th, his 10-foot par putt curled around the cup and left him with another bogey, bringing his card to par. 

Another birdie, following a brave second shot over the water and onto the green, brought the score back to one-under. But he bogeyed the last hole after finding the bunker and missing an eight-foot putt for par. 

I will take that score any day. But I must say I was annoyed with the last bogey. Otherwise during a round, you make some and you miss some. Thats the way it is in this game, Jeev said later. 

I was excited with the way I played today. I was nervous on the first tee but I played pretty good on the front nine, shooting three under where I holed a lot of putts. 

On the back nine, I didnt make too many putts but thats okay. Im pretty happy with my first round at Augusta national, he said. 

World No. 7 Vijai Singh shot a 73 to be with Woods at tied 15th. 

Among from Asia stars, South Koreas K J Choi and Yang Yong Eun fired identical 75s to be at tied 28th. 

Rose and Wetterich finished one stroke ahead of Briton David Howell, who eagled the par-five 15th, and 2001 PGA champion David Toms, who birdied two of the last eight holes. 

South African Tim Clark, runner-up last year, carded a 71 to share fifth place with Americans Vaughn Taylor, Zach Johnson, Rich Beem and J.J. Henry. 

World No. 1 Woods was frustrated by a sloppy finish that featured errant tee shots on the 17 and 18. 

Youre right there and all of a sudden youre over par, the 31-year-old American said. I worked hard to get back to under par and threw it away with bogeys on the last two holes. Im not too happy right now. 

South African Ernie Els struggled to a 78 and Geoff Ogilvy of Australia ran up a triple-bogey eight at the second for a 75.

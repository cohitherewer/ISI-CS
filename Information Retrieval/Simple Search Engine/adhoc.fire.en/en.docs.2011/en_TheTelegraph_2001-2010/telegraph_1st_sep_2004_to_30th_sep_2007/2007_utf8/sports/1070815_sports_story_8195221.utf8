 India should have gone for a win: Kapil 

Mumbai: Kapil Dev on Monday hailed Rahul Dravid amp; Co. for clinching their first Test series in England in 21 years but felt a victory in the final Test would have enhanced the sides reputation. 

Kapil, who led India to their last series win in England in 1986, said Team India should have shown more aggression at the Oval. 

Dravid did not enforce the follow-on despite a first innings lead of 319 and his safety-first approach was the subject of a heated debate. 

If you want to blame, you can blame the entire team, they would have taken a collective decision, Kapil told a TV channel. Once he had decided to bat, India should have attacked and tried to win the match, not draw. 

I just dont understand why there was the need to rest the bowlers. 

Dravid had told a press conference after the Oval match that the bowlers were tired and he needed to look after them.

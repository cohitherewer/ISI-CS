 Draw keeps Dempo waiting

Mumbai: Dempo squandered an opportunity to seal the 11th ONGC Cup National Football League title after playing out a 2-2 draw against Air India in a penultimate round match at the Cooperage on Sunday. 

The Goan outfit would clearly be disappointed with the result, despite taken the lead twice. However, Dempo (33 points) need just a draw at home against Mohun Bagan in their final match on May 18 to secure the title. 

Having the better of the exchanges for a major part of the first half, Dempo got their goals through their strike force duo of Anthony Pereira and Nigerian Ranty Martins. 

Efforts from Bashiru Abbas and Santosh Koli, who struck very late in the match, ensured that Air India kept their recent run of drawn encounters at home intact. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Perfect ending, says McGrath

Sydney: Australia pace bowler Glenn McGrath finished his Test career the same way he started it, picking up a wicket by fooling a batsmen with a simple sleight of hand. 

His final victim was tailender James Anderson, who failed to pick McGraths slower ball and spooned a simple catch to Mike Hussey at mid-on, ending Englands innings. 

I guess if you had to write the script for the perfect ending, obviously to get a wicket on your last ball of Test cricket is the perfect way to do it, McGrath said at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Friday. 

Obviously seeing off stump cartwheel back 10-15 metres is probably the perfect scenario but a slower ball caught at mid-on, I guess Ill take that. 

McGrath polished off three of the final five English wickets to take three for 38 in his last Test innings and finish his brilliant 124-match career with 563 Test victims, a record for a fast bowler. 

The way weve played since the last Ashes has been some of the most outstanding cricket Ive been involved in, he said. To realise that we havent had the Ashes, you look back at the first Test in Brisbane we were pretty pumped up and ready for that. 

Well make the most of this over the next few days and enjoy the moment and look forward to the next few months. Weve got the one-day series and then the World Cup so for me personally theres plenty of focus and plenty of motivation to keep going.

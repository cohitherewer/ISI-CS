 CAB may host ODI in May

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) might get to stage another ODI in May this year to celebrate their platinum jubilee year. 

This is also the platinum jubilee year for the Mumbai Cricket Association and the golden jubilees for the Punjab and Orissa associations. 

Since all four wanted to host a big event, a compromise has been worked out. Accordingly, a four-match ODI series may be held with each association hosting one.

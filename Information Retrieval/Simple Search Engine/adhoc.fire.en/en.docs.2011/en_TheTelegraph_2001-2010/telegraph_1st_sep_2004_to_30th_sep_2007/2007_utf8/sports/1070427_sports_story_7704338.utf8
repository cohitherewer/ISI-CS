 Ian critical of Sachin, again

New Delhi: Ian Chappell has reiterated that Sachin Tendulkar is playing for the wrong reasons. 

Players should be in the game to win, but Tendulkar is now playing for the wrong reasons, the former Australian captain said on TV during the semi-final between Australia and South Africa on Wednesday. 

Answering questions about when great players should retire, Chappell said they should call it a day when fans ask, why and not when. (PTI)

 Kapur moves up to sixth spot

 Shiv Kapur 

Hamburg: Shiv Kapur defied elements to shot a brilliant second round 67 and zoom into contention at the midway stage of the Deutsche Bank Players Championship of Europe. 

On a day hit by blustery winds and occasional rain, Kapur played one of his best rounds this season and shot five-under 67 to move to sixth place from overnight 61st. 

Indias other three stars fell by the wayside, as Jyoti Randhawa (73), Gaurav Ghei (74) and Jeev Milkha Singh (79) missed the cut. 

The leader is shared by Englands Zane Scotland (68) and Lee Slattery (69) as they are placed at nine-under 135 for two rounds. 

Randhawa had three birdies and four bogeys in his 73 and missed by one shot. 

Jeev was clearly in trouble and pain and look tired as he started with two bogeys and then found a birdie. But he bogeyed six in a row from fourth to ninth, his last six holes for a seven-over 79 and a total of five-over 149.

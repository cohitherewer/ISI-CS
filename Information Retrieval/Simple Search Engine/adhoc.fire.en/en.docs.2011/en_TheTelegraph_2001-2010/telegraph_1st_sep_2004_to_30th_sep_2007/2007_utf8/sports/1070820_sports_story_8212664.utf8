Cincinnati: Fourth seeds Leander Paes and Martin Damm went down to top seeds Bob and Mike Bryan in the semi-finals of the $2,200,000 Cincinnati Masters. 

The Indo-Czech pair lost 6-3, 0-6, 7-10 to the Americans, who advanced to their 12th final this year. 

They will take on the sixth-seeded Israeli duo of Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram, who defeated Czechs Lukas Dlouhy and Pavel Vizner 7-6 (7-4), 7-5. 

Paes and Damm were off to a brilliant start as they broke Mikes first service game en route to capturing the first set. However, the Indo-Czech pair completely lost the plot in the second set and was blanked out by the Bryans. The top seeds then raced to an 8-2 lead in the tie-break but Paes and Damm recovered to cut the lead to 8-7. 

The comeback, however, proved to be too late as Bob fired a couple of unreturnable serves to clinch the issue after 58 minutes. The Bryan brothers have already won a personal-best eight titles this year. 

In singles, world No. 1 Roger Federer battled back from a break down in the final set to fend off a rejuvenated Lleyton Hewitt 6-3, 6-7, 7-6 on Saturday to reach the final (as reported in Sundays Late City edition). 

Australian Hewitt saved three match points, including one in the second-set tie-break, but Federer roared back from 3-2 down in the third set to set up a clash with American ninth seed James Blake, who beat fifth seed Nikolay Davydenko of Russia 6-4 6-2. 

I think it was the best match Ive played this week, no doubt, Federer said. I think he played well, too. In the end Ive got to be happy I came through. Its nice to win a third-set tie-break after losing one last week (to Novak Djokovic in the final in Montreal). 

 Blake went into his match with Davydenko having won all of their five previous meetings but the Russian jumped out to a 2-0 lead. 

Blake then reeled-off four straight games, Davydenko broke back and levelled at 4-4 before the American broke again in the 10th game to take the set. 

Blake then romped through the second set to set up a clash with Federer, who has beaten him in all six of their previous matches. 

He (Davydenko) is someone I feel like if I play my best I can dictate and take it to him, Blake said. Roger has clearly been the best player in the world for the last few days, but when I get into a final I know Im playing great tennis, so I have a chance.

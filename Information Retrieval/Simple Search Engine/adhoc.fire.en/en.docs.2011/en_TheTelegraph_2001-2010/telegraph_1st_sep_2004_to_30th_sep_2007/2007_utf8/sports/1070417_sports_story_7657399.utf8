 CSA seeks explanation

Durban: Cricket South Africa (CSA) has asked the team management for an explanation following reports that the players publicly misbehaved after their World Cup defeat against New Zealand in the Caribbean last Saturday. 

I will be leaving for the Caribbean on Tuesday and have asked team management to prepare a full report on the allegations to be ready on my arrival, said Gerald Majola, CSAs chief executive . 

I have been in contact with the team and they have assured me nothing untoward has happened. 

In Bridgetown, manager Goolam Rajah brushed aside the issue, suggesting no player faced any disciplinary action over the incident. (PTI)

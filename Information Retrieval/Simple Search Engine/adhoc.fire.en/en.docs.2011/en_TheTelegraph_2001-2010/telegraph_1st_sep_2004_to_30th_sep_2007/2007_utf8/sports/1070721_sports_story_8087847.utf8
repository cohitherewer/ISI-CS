Calcutta: Tata Steel A upset the form book to emerge winners in The Telegraph Cup. 

Expectations were running high for Williamson Magor and they were even leading by 10 strokes and one stroke on Day II and III, respectively. But lacklustre performances from their top stars Lakshman Singh and Aditya Khaitan on the final day cost them the title. 

Tata Steel A, represented by B. Muthuraman, Alan Singh, Kulvin Suri and Rishad Chinoy, finished with a score of 225. 

Division II saw McLeod Russel B. represented by S. Deka, Baldeep Singh, Anil Pandit and A.P. Singh triumph with a total score of 243. 

New entrants Manpasand Manpower, riding a gallant round of 73 by Ashit Luthra, were the Division III winners. 

The Telegraph Challenge Cup was won by South City Projects. Luthra won the Best Gross in Merchants Cup (72) while the best nett in the Challenge Cup category was by Govint Arwal (69.4). 

The ColorPlus Longest Drive was won by Vandana Agarwal. Navneet Manakshia took the Adidas Straightest Drive prize, while the Kingfisher Closest to the Pin was won by Aditya Khaitan.

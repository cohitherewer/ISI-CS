 Gibbs looks back on 99 

Port of Spain: Mate you have just dropped the World Cup the famous comment by Steve Waugh to Herschelle Gibbs might be etched in cricket fans memories but the South African says it does not haunt him. 

People still ask me about that drop to Steve Waugh in the 1999 World Cup. The truth is, it doesnt haunt me as Ive been chirped about it for a long time, Gibbs said. 

The Proteas had Australians on the mat at 152 for three in pursuit of a target of 272 in the Super Six encounter in the 1999 World Cup when Waugh chipped a simple catch to Gibbs at mid-wicket. 

Gibbs almost held it but made a mess when he put it down while trying to throw it up. 

I still remember the match very well because I got a really good hundred against Australia. But losing that game set up the most exciting game of all, one of the most exciting games in any World Cup. Everybody remembers that (tied) semi-final and what a cracker of a game it was, he wrote in a website. 

Gibbs, however, denied their opening round group tie against Australia would be a revenge match and said irrespective of the rankings Australia were the favourites. 

The opening game between ourselves and Australia should be a cracker. Its nice that the teams ranked No. 1 and 2 are in the same group, so well just have to see how it all unfolds. 

(But) There are not going to be any revenge matches here in St Kitts so to speak. Australia has been the most consistent team in world cricket both in Test and one-day cricket so I still believe that they are favourites but this one is a lot more wide open than any other tournament, Gibbs said. 

Theyve come off a few games where theyve lost and its proved to the rest of the world that they can be consistently beaten if you play better cricket on the day, he added. 

Its likely that they wont be too confident if they were to bat first, whatever total they set us, because weve chased down the second-biggest total in one-day cricket. We have done it once before and there is no reason why we cant do it again.

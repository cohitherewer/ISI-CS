The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dhoni better prepared now

London: While frenzied fans back home make it impossible for him to venture out without being mobbed, Team India stumper Mahendra Singh Dhoni is enjoying his relative anonymity in England, which would make it easier for him to walk the streets. 

I think it will be easier in England to go places, though it will not be easy to become accustomed to other things, Dhoni said. 

The Jharkhand cricketer is part of the Indian squad touring England for three Tests and seven ODIs. 

The 26-year-old, however, admitted that it was tough getting acclimatised to the change in temperatures after landing in the United Kingdom. 

We had our training camp in searing temperatures, went to Ireland at the start of the tour and it was 12 degree celsius. It felt different, Dhoni, who caught flu upon arrival, told a British daily. 

The dashing right-hander said it has been hard dealing with the immense fan adulation in India but he had learnt to keep himself grounded amid the frenzy. 

Dhoni, who was castigated by fans after the teams early elimination from the World Cup, said he was now better prepared to deal with the brickbats that usually follow a poor show. 

Cricket is more than an obsession in India. But you have to stay intent on cricket because that is what we are there to do. It is three years since I started playing for India and I have learned what I have to do, he said.

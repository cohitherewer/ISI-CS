 SHARP SINGLES 

Ireland seek more funds 

Bridgetown: Irish Cricket Union (ICU) chief executive

 Warren Deutrom will seek to build on Irelands fairytale World Cup debut

 by asking the International Cricket Council (ICC) for more funding. 

In 2006, the ICU received 200,000 euros ($271,800) from ICC by way of World Cup preparation fee and High Performance Programme (HPP) funding. To build their infrastructure and improve further, more money is needed. I shall certainly not be backward in asking ICC in what ways it may assist in ensuring that Irelands performance curve improves consistently, Deutrom said. This would be in the same way the ICC pumped in significant funding to both the USA and Kenya to move forward. After all, its what the HPP is for.

ECB gives the nod 

The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has made all the non-centrally contracted members of the World Cup squad available to play for their counties ahead of next months Test series with West Indies. Lancashire bowlers Sajid Mahmood and James Anderson will be able to feature in one LV County Championship game and one Friends Provident Trophy match each. Middlesexs Ed Joyce and Jamie Dalrymple, Essexs Ravi Bopara, Durhams Liam Plunkett and Paul Nixon of Leicestershire will be free to turn out for their counties in all matches from specified dates later this month and the start of May.

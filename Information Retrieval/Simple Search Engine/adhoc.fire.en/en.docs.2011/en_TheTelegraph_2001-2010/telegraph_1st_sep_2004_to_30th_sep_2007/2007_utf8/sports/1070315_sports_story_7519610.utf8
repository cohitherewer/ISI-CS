The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Irishmen will go out oozing confidence

Kingston: Under-strength Zimbabwe and debutants Ireland may look like a lightweight contest in a World Cup group D which also includes the mighty West Indies and Pakistan. 

But both need a win on Thursday if they are to have any hope of progressing in the tournament. If we can turn up, and bring our A-game to the park, especially against Zimbabwe, we think we have a chance there to win, said Irelands Australian-born captain Trent Johnson ahead of the Sabina Park clash. 

We are entering this match against Zimbabwe with a lot of confidence. We know we have a very tough group, but we have our plans in place, and we are looking to execute them. 

Ireland, like Bermuda in group B, are playing in the World Cup for the first time, and Johnson readily acknowledges that his side is the least recognised of the four in the section, but they want to make a big impact in the competition. 

West Indies are going to be difficult to beat on home soil and they have that extra bit of an incentive to do well, he said. Pakistan are a world-class team with world-class performers, and Zimbabwe are capable of causing an upset, but there is no reason why we cannot cause an upset of our own. 

If a bit of luck goes our way, and we execute our plans, I believe we can make it to the next round. 

Brothers Niall and Kevin Brien will enjoy a slice of history on Thursday when Ireland make their debut against the Zimbabweans. 

Win or lose, the brothers are already thinking of the future with Niall pondering a move to Englands colours just like Ed Joyce. 

With Zimbabwe coming into the tournament in a state of chaos, Ireland fancy their chances of making a winning start in group D before taking on heavyweights Pakistan and West Indies. The Irish dont lack in confidence. 

In a World Cup warm-up match last week they reduced world No. 1 South Africa to 92 for eight at one stage before going down by a narrow margin. 

Well probably be favourites to beat Zimbabwe that game is there for the taking, said Niall. 

Zimbabwes captain Prosper Utseya says it will be a little difficult planning for Ireland, since television footage and other information about them is not readily available. We have been seeking some information about them, but we feel no pressure because we have nothing to lose, since we just have to play to our best, he said. 

Utseya noted that Zimbabwe have the reputation of causing an upset or two in previous World Cups, and his side would like nothing better to do this to regain some measure of respectability.

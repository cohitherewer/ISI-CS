 PCB asks ICC to reconsider

Karachi: Pakistan have asked the ICC to reconsider its decision not to allow them more time to finalise the World Cup squad. 

We dont have enough time to ascertain the extent of injuries to the players as the team returns from South Africa on Thursday, PCB director of operations, Saleem Altaf, said. 

Earlier, the International Cricket Council (ICC) rejected Pakistans request to extend the deadline for naming their 15-member squad for the World Cup. 

A number of injuries notwithstanding, the games world governing body has asked the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to submit the team list by the scheduled last date of Tuesday, one month before the start of the quadrennial showpiece in the Caribbean. 

Pakistan are facing numerous fitness problems with star bowlers Umar Gul, Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Sami and Shabbir Ahmed, all of whom were injured on the current tour of South Africa. 

The PCB had asked for a two-week delay as it wants to first confirm the fitness of these players.

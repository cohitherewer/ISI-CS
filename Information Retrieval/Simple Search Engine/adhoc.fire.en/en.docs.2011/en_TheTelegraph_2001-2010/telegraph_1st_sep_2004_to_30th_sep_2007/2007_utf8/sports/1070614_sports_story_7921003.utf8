 Winning start at Queens by Nadal

London: French Open champion Rafael Nadal warmed up for Wimbledon on Wednesday with a 6-4, 6-4 win over Juan Martin del Potro in the second round of the Artois Championships at the Queens Club. 

The claycourt grand master, who had a bye into the second round, looked entirely comfortable, despite his protestations that he has difficulty in adapting his game to the faster surface. 

Nadal, who completed a hattrick of titles at Roland Garros on Sunday, barely broke a sweat while he pummelled del Potro from the back of the court. The 1.96m tall teenager held his own for the first eight games, using a big serve to keep Nadal at bay. 

But Nadals formidable strength and pinpoint returning eventually wore him down. The top seed broke serve in the ninth game of the first set and collected the next four games to put him a break up in the second. 

After that there was no way back for Del Potro, whose attempts at taking the net were met with searing passing shots down both flanks.

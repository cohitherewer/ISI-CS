 Mani slams PCB 

Karachi: Former ICC president Ehsan Mani has sought to dismiss the notion that the games world governing body does not have enough Asian representation . 

Referring to a statement made by Saleem Altaf, the CEO of PCB that the decision to nominate Sharad Pawar as the next ICC chief was to increase the Asian influence in ICCs decision making, Mani said a totally wrong impression was being created by the PCB. 

The statement reflects a disturbing lack of understanding of the decision making process of the ICC by the PCB, he said. All ICC decisions are made by a board of directors comprising presidents of the 10 Test playing countries and three associate member representatives. (PTI)

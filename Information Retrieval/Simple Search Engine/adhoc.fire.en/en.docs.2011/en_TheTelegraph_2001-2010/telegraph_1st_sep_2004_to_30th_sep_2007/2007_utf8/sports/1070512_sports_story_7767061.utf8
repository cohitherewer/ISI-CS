 Malaysia pip India to final berth 

 Shivendra Singh, whose goal went in vain 

Ipoh: Malaysia snatched an exciting 2-1 win over India to join Australia in the final of the 16th Sultan Azlan Shah Cup on Friday. 

Ahmed Tajuddin put Malaysia ahead in the 11th minute, but India equalised two minutes later through Shivendra Singh. However, the hosts struck the second time on a lucky break with Kelwinder Singh (40th) finding the boards for the matchwinner. 

Malaysia made it to the final of the eight-nation tournament after a long gap of 22 years. The Malaysian tactics were apparent from the start as they chipped away from the right flank, giving Indias left-back Harpal Singh a working over. 

Consequently, the Indians virtually invited the speedy Malaysian forwards into the striking circle. 

It was no surprise then that the hosts struck in the 11th minute when the pocket-sized dynamite Selvaraju broke in from the right, past a tentative Harpal and centred for Tajuddin to make the telling deflection. 

To Indias credit, the youngsters kept their composure and equalised soon with Shivendra having all the time to trap a Sardara Singh pass and slam it in with as many as three defenders around him. 

The home team, backed by a vociferous capacity crowd, resorted to aerial balls that caused some consternation in the Indian ranks, but as they persisted with that line of attack, the Malaysians became rather predictable. 

India looked the sharper, creating more opportunities but were unable to capitalise on them. Right-half Gurbaj and Sardara Singh in the middle were eye-catching with their tireless work, constantly feeding the forwards. But at the finish, it was the old story of wasted chances. 

The Indians lost Vikram Kanth on a yellow card suspension for his tackle on Mohammed Sharun. Reduced to 10 men, the Indians felt the heat of the fast and furious Malaysian attacks. 

With the Malaysian forwards matching their counterparts in missing opportunities, the Indians survived and almost scored in the 22nd when Gurbaj, cutting in from the right, crossed to Shivendra who failed to connect. 

After the break, India reshuffled their deep defence. Half-back Bimal Lakra joined William Xalco at the back. The move, though, made no difference as Malaysia made it 2-1 five minutes into the session when Kelvinder was on hand to score off a Zulkifi Rejab cross. 

Earlier, Olympic champions Australia extended their supremacy over Asian Games gold medallists South Korea scripting a 6-2 win to enter the final. 

It was Australias fourth consecutive entry into the final of this tournament that they have won as many times and a repeat of last years World Cup semi-final that the Aussies had won 4-2. 

Goals by Desmond Abbot (9th, 69th), Andrew Smith (22nd), Liam Deyoung (37th), Eli Matheson (51st) and Grant Schubert (60th) set up the Aussie victory while Korean replies came from Jeong Yun-sang (11th) and Lee Sung-min (57th). (PTI)

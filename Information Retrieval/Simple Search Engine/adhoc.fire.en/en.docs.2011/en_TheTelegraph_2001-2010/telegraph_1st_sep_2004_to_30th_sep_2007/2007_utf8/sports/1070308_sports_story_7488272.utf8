 Toal irked by AIFFs 

3-player policy 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The policy of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) not to select more than three players from any club for the pre-Olympic team has hit Collin Toal hard. 

The stand-in national coach, who is currently holding camp in Goa, said he was planning to call in a few more players, but couldnt do it because of the stand taken by the federation. He, however, said it was necessary to have a balance between the national team and domestic football. 

With club commitments to look after, it is not easy to call players for the camp, said the British coach, who is also the technical director of the national team. 

Take for example Churchill Brothers. Their two full backs (Robert Lalthamba and Naoba Singh) are ideal for the improvement of the side, but I can not call them for the camp. 

What worries Toal further on the eve of the next match against Thailand on March 14 in Chennai is the injury to Chitrasen, which has opened up a slot in the central midfield position. Mohun Bagan midfielder Mehtab Hussain, who didnt make the trip to Myanmar at the last moment under the four-players-a-team theory, is likely to make a comeback for the Chennai tie. 

Mehtab is a possibility to take Chitras place. We also have Subhas (Chakrabarty), but we have to monitor the situation, Toal said. 

Toal admitted that it was disappointing to lose 0-3 against Iraq in the away tie, but defended his boys. 

The result was disappointing, but we were up against a much stronger opposition. I must credit the boys for standing up to the challenge, said Toal. No one gave up till the final whistle.

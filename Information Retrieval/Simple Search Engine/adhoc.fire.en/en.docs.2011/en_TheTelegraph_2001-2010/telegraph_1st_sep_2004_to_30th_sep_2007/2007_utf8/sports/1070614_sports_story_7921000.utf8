 Red clay and Nadal are hurdles Federer may never overcome

The French Open final between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal had the resonance of an epic. The stakes were sky-high. Federer was one match away from being considered the greatest ever, while a victory for Nadal would make him the second man since 1925 to win three French Open in a row. The contest produced a very high quality match worthy of a Grand Slam final. 

Nadals four-set victory in a tense, high voltage clash was an emphatic confirmation of his genius on clay. Driven seemingly by a primeval force, Nadals mercurial mobility brought him within range of Federers shots and angles on the slow clay. Once there, Nadal unleashed his topspin forehand, possibly the deadliest shot in the game today. 

The excessive top-spin, accentuated by double polyester strings used by Nadal, resulted in an unpredictable trajectory which made it very difficult for Federer to control the ball. This contributed substantially to the high percentage of so-called unforced errors made by Federer. 

A very low percentage of first serves by Federer helped Nadal to the opening set and may have cost Federer whatever chance he had to win the match. As many as 10 break-points drifted into the bois-de-belogne. If Federer could have converted just two of the break-points, and got a reassuring glimpse of victory, the match could well have gone right down to the line. 

Nadals resolve, mobility, and staying power on clay demand unsustainable percentage of accuracy at full power even for the genius of Federer. Stung by the loss of the first set, Federer lashed out and played some awesome points in the second set. Watching the flashes of brilliance was a soul-lifting joy. But Federer could not sustain the effort. 

He was trapped in Nadals web of spin and in the later part of the third set Federer read the writing on the wall. It was sad to see the fall of Federer and the devasted expression on his face. The red clay and Nadal are hurdles he may never overcome. 

The most heartening part of the final was the exemplary behaviour of both. Both met triumph and disaster with dignity and rare grace and did the game proud. 

The US challenge ended in disaster. All the nine entrants, including No. 3 seed, Andy Roddick, fell in the first round. Their attitude and style of play, a reflection of the national character, is aggressive and impatient. On the red-clay of Paris these tactics are fatal. There is no instant kill on these courts. Points have to be structured with patience and restraint. The US contingent must now be looking forward to redeem their reputation on the Wimbledon grass. 

In the absence of Andy Murray, 20-year-old Djokovic from Serbia, who lost to Nadal in the semi-finals, seem to be the brightest of the young challengers. Djokovic played a superb match against Nadal. His all court game, grit and tenacity pushed Nadal to the limit. The Serbian has the potential to win a Grand Slam. 

In womens singles, 25-year-old Justine Henin won her third consecutive title. It was a double triumph for the slim rock-hard 56 Belgian the title and the reconciliation with her estranged family after 17 years. The relief showed on her face. The hard professional look broke into a tender loving smile as she dedicated her win, saying: To my family. I love you with all my heart. 

Henin has had more than her share of misfortune in her short life. Family love has softened her hitherto brittle temperament and it was reflected in her carefree play. She was a runaway winner at Paris and it would not surprise me if she wins one Wimbledon as well. Henins opponent in the final was the Serbian teenager, Ana Ivanovic. 

A player of great promise, Ivanovic dominated the 62 Sharapova in the semi-finals to win convincingly. In the final, Ivanovic was overwhelmed by the occasion. Her powerful serve failed to function because of her shaky ball-toss and her lethal forehand was hit constantly beyond the baseline. Ivanovics day will surely come. 

The womens ranks have a clutch of very good youngsters, foremost amongst them being the 20-year-old Serbian, Jelena Jankovic, the fourth seed. A fluent mover with an all-court game, Jankovic was put out of the semi-finals by Henin in a well-contested match. She has potential, and along with Ivanovic and Djokovic, has launched Serbia high into the tennis world.

 Aussies ahead of SA in big games

 Allan Donald

Melbourne: Former South African fast bowler Allan Donald is worried about his countrys propensity to make stupid mistakes in big games against Australia and has his fingers crossed about their clash in the World Cup group stage. 

South Africa, who recently climbed to the top of the ICC ODI rankings, have been placed in the same group as the world champions and the two teams would face off on March 24 at St Kitts. 

I think in big games Australia are well ahead of South Africa. I think a big part of that is on numerous occasions we just couldnt finish it off in the big time, Donald said. 

This is something South Africa will want to get rid of that fear of not succeeding in critical moments against top teams, especially Australia. 

I am worried about it. Its something hopefully South Africa will breach if they are to go a long way in this championship, he was quoted as saying in an Australian daily. 

Donald said the Proteas had been guilty of making stupid mistakes at crucial times. Thats been the downfall of South Africa on many an occasion in top matches where they have played the better cricket and all of a sudden they have made stupid mistakes.

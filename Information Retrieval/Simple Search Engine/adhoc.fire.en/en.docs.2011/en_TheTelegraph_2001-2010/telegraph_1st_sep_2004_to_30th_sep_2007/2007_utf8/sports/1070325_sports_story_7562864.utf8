 ICC to beef up security at SA hotel

Basseterre: South Africa team manager Goolam Raja has revealed that the ICC has agreed to increase security at the teams hotel in the wake of Pakistan coach Bob Woolmers murder. 

We have made applications to beef up security and the ICC have assured us that will be the case, the Proteas team manager said on Friday. 

We have also been told that the presence of police at the hotels, either in plain clothes or uniform, has been increased. 

If there is one lesson we have learned from this situation, it is that you cannot have enough security. 

Rajah also said that South Africas players have been told to continue their anti-corruption practice from touring on the subcontinent of giving him the phone numbers of any strangers who contact them. 

He revealed that an unnamed South African player, who is not in this Cup squad, was approached in India in 2005 by a stranger inquiring about the composition of the team. 

His phone number was passed on to the police in India, but the approach was later deemed to be innocent.

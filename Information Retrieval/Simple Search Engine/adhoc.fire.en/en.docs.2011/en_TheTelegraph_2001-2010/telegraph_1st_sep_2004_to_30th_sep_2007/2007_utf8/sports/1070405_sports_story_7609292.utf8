 Hair hearing on Oct. 1 

London: Darrell Hairs claim that the International Cricket Council (ICC) excluded him from top level international matches on racially-motivated grounds will be heard by an employment tribunal here on October 1. 

The hearing is expected to last two weeks and former England batsman John Jameson, who was responsible for the redrafting of the laws of cricket when he was assistant secretary of the MCC seven years ago, is to appear as a witness for Hair.

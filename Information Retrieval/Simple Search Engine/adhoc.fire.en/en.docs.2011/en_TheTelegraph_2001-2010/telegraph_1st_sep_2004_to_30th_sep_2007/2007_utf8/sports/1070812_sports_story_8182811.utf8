The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pereira: Ready for big clash

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Having kicked off their CFL Premier Division campaign with a draw against George Telegraph, Mohun Bagan have turned things around in style. Full points in their next three games, including a 7-0 verdict, have set them up nicely for the East Bengal clash on Friday. 

Coach Carlos Roberto Pereira, not one to beat around the bush, said after Saturdays 3-0 win over Eastern Railway that his team was ready for the big game. Weve played three matches with almost the same team, won all three Hopefully the team is ready for Fridays match. 

But it wont be before Monday that Pereira will start thinking about Fridays match. Ill be seeing East Bengals game (versus Peerless) on TV tomorrow (Sunday), but will think about our match only from Monday, said Pereira. 

The Brazilian conceded that his team didnt play good football in the second session on Saturday. We played well in the first 45 minutes, the second half was not so good Some players were tired Its not always easy to sustain the same level for the entire game.

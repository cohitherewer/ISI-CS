 Barcelona: Therese Alshammar of Sweden set the world record in the 50m butterfly on Wednesday in 25.46 seconds. She beat the mark of 25.57 set by Anna-Karin Kammerling of Sweden in July 2000, in Berlin. Alshammar won gold in the 50m butterfly and silver in the 50m freestyle at the 2007 world championships in Melbourne. 

 Sajama: Weaving around icy boulders and scrambling to avoid sliding down the snow-covered mountainside, President Evo Morales and his staff played a soccer match on Bolivias highest peak Tuesday, gleefully thumbing their noses at Fifas ban on high-altitude games. Wherever you can make love, you can play sports, said Morales, who was winded but smiling after scoring the winning goal against a team of local mountaineers.

 Berlin: Lothar Matthaeus was sacked on Tuesday as joint coach of Austrian champions Red Bull Salzburg due to differences of philosophy, the club said.

 Matthaeus, 46, had been coach alongside Italian Giovanni Trapattoni since last year. 

 The announcement released on Red Bull Salzburgs website said the clubs board had unanimously decided to part company with immediate effect.

 Differences of philosophy meant that a good working relationship would not be sustainable in the long term, said the club.

 Back pain forces Kapur to withdraw 

Vienna: Plagued by a back injury, Shiv Kapur withdrew from the second round of the Ba-Ca Open, at Fontana Golf Club here. 

After shooting 77 in the opening round, Shiv decided to pull out to avoid aggravating the problem. 

With a two-day total of 11-under 131 following his rounds of 66 and 65, Australian left-hander Richard Green moved into a one-shot lead at the halfway stage of the tournament. 

 Swedens Martin Erlandsson lies in the second place after a three-under 68 for 132 while two more Swedes Pelle Edberg and Steven Jeppesen -- and Spaniard Miguel Angel Jiminez share third place on nine-under. 

Meanwhile, a week before playing in the US Open, last years runner-up Colin Montgomerie missed the cut. A second round of three-over 74 left the Scot five-over for the two rounds. (PTI)

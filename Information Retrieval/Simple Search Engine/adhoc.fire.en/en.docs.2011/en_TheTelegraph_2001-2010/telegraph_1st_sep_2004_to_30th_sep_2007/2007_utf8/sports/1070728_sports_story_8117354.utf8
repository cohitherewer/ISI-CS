 Sania stuns Golovin, enters last eight 

 - STANFORD CLASSIC 

 - One of my top wins, says Indian 

 Sania Mirza 

Stanford: Sania Mirza maintained her sparkling form to shock world No. 19 Tatiana Golovin of France 6-4, 6-1 and reach the quarter finals of the $600,000 Bank of West Classic tournament here on Thursday. 

The 20-year-old Indian was ecstatic about her first win against Golovin, who had won both their previous meetings. 

Beating a top-20 player is always good, especially someone you have not won against before, Sania said later. 

The Hyderabad girl, who captured the tennis worlds attention with a spirited Australian Open showing as a wild card in 2005, has so far won one singles and five doubles titles on the WTA Tour. 

It is definitely one of my top wins. She is in the top-20 and playing well this year. 

Sania, who reached the semis in the Cincinnati meet last week, next faces last years finalist, Patty Schnyder of Switzerland. 

The fourth-seeded Schnyder downed Yaroslava Shvedova 7-5, 6-2. 

Sanias doubles partner, Israeli Shahar Peer, went down 6-4, 5-7, 2-6 to Olga Govortsova of Belarus. 

 Top seed Anna Chakvetadze, who beat Sania in Cincinnati 

 and went on to win the title, defeated Eleni Daniilidou 

 of Greece 6-4, 6-1 in another second-round match.

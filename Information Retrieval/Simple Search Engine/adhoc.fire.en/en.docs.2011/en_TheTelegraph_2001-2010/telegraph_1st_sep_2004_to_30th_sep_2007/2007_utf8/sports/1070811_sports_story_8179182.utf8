 Harbhajan heroics

Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh continued his blazing form with an 11-wicket match haul to help Surrey stun Kent by four wickets in two days in the County Championship.

Surrey reached the winning total of 107 in 24 overs as Harbhajan top-scored with 29 off 22 balls helping his team gain full points to avoid relegation from Division I.

 Mixed fortunes for Sania

New Haven: Sania Mirza had mixed fortunes in the $ 600,000 Pilot Pen meet on Wednesday. She bowed out of singles but made the last eight in doubles. 

The Indian No. 1 sizzled for a while before running out of steam against Alona Bondarenko in a Round II singles match. Sanias tennis swung from good to ordinary as she lost 3-6, 6-0, 3-6 in a match lasting an hour and a half. 

In doubles, Sania and Mara Santangelo reached the quarters after ousting the American pair of Corina Morariu and Meghann Shaughnessy 6-4, 7-5. The Sania-Mara pair will next meet the Slovak-Swiss duo of Janette Husarova and Patty Schnyder. (Agencies)

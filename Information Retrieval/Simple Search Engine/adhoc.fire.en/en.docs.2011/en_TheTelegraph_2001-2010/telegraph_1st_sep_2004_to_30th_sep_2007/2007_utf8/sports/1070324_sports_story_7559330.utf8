 NZ vs CANADA: THE HIGHLIGHTS 

The 142-run partnership between Lou Vincent and Stephen Fleming is New Zealands best for the opening wicket in the World Cup, eclipsing the 114 put on between Mark Greatbatch and Rod Latham against South Africa in Auckland in 1992 

Lou Vincents 101 is his maiden World Cup century. Interestingly, he had failed to open his account in the previous two matches of this edition against England and Kenya 

Canadian John Davison blasted a 23-ball fifty the joint third-fastest in World Cup. He is the only player to hit two Cup half-centuries in 25 balls or less 

 New Zealands 363/7 is their second highest score in ODIs. Their best remains 397/5 vs Zimbabwe in Bulawayo in 2005 

NZs total is the fourth best in World Cup history, with three of those coming against non-Test playing teams. For the record, Indias 373/6 against Sri Lanka in Taunton in 1999 is the highest against a Test team 

New Zealand notched up their sixth win in a row. They are one short of equalling their best sequence in ODIs (Feb. 19 to March 20, 1983) 

Brendon McCullums 20-ball fifty is the fastest World Cup half-century, bettering the 21-ball effort by Mark Boucher against The Netherlands a week ago. The record for the quickest fifty in all ODIs (off 17 balls) belongs to Sanath Jayasuriya

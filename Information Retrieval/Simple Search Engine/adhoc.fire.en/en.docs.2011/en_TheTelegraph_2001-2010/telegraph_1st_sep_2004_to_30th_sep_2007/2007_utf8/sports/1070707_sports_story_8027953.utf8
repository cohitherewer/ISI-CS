 Leagues threat to block Tevez deal

DAVID BOND

The Premier League will block Manchester Uniteds attempt to sign Carlos Tevez unless they agree to pay a significant chunk of any transfer fee to West Ham. 

United have agreed in principle to a two-year deal with Kia Joorabchian, the owner of the Argentine strikers economic rights, with an option to buy him outright in the summer of 2009. The club will confirm the deal, subject to obtaining the necessary paperwork and the player passing a medical when he returns from the Copa America in Venezuela later this month. 

However, winning the backing of the Premier League could prove the biggest hurdle to the transfer, even though West Ham on Thursday night seemed to accept that they would struggle to retain a player desperate to go to Old Trafford. 

League sources say they could even charge United with tapping-up Tevez by going behind West Hams back and doing a deal directly with Joorabchian. 

Having seen the climax to last season overshadowed by the Tevez affair, the Leagues chief executive, Richard Scudamore, fears the players move to United could make a mockery of the competitions rulebook. 

West Ham were only allowed to continue playing Tevez in the final three matches of the campaign after they ripped up their third-party agreements with Joorabchian and two offshore companies registered in the British Virgin Islands, Media Sports Investments and Just Sport Incorporated. 

Earlier this week, a Premier League arbitration panel ruled that it could not grant Sheffield Uniteds call for a new inquiry into the Tevez scandal.

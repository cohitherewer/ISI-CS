 EB hope for turnaround today

 - A draw against HASC wont do, says Pereira 

Bangalore: East Bengal will look to get their National Football League campaign back on track when they take on local outfit HASC in the second round on Thursday. 

The famed red-and-gold brigade, last seasons runners-up, were humbled by Air India in the opener, while HASC put up a creditable show holding Mohun Bagan goalless to claim a point. 

We cannot take any match lightly in this highly competitive field, HASC coach Krishnaji Rao said after the teams practice session. 

The injury to forward Reisangmi Vashim, who ruptured his knee against Mohun Bagan, is a cause of worry for him. We could have pushed Mohun Bagan even further but lacked punch in our forward line once this Manipur lad got injured in the second half, Rao said. 

Midfielder Bhuvan Joshi may replace Vashim while Kuttimani may go upfront against East bengal, Rao hinted. 

On the other hand, three-time champions East Bengal, who have had a barren run since winning the CFL Premier Division, will be looking forward to putting up an improved show. 

The team appeared suspect in defence and listless in midfield against Air India. Their Brazilian coach Carlos Roberto Pereira would certainly be concerned about the two areas. 

The gangling Kenyan Boniface Ngairah Ambani and the Japanese striker of Indian origin Izumi Arata were both denied a clear look by the Air India defenders and need to strike form against HASC. 

Lack of a positive striker has cost us dear in the past. Hopefully, things will change for better against HASC, the under-pressure Pereira maintained. A draw tomorrow wont do We have to win this match, he added. (Agencies)

 EB, Bagan to skip Durand

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The 120th edition of the Durand Cup may turn out to be a low key affair despite offering huge prize money. 

East Bengal and Mohun Bagans refusal to participate in the Durand because of their preoccupation with the Calcutta league has jolted the organisers. 

It is difficult to attract spectators without the Calcutta teams, said a tournament official. But our dates (October 29 to November 8) clash with that of the Calcutta league (second phase). 

The best from the rest of India will be in action, though, including defending champions Dempo, last years losing finalists JCT, Churchill Brothers and Mahindra United. 

The AIFF has given us only 11 days to stage the tournament, said the disappointed official. They had earlier allotted us December 6 to 23, but suddenly changed the dates. 

The Durand offers attractive prize money. The winners will be richer by Rs 10 lakh, while the runners up will gain Rs 4 lakh. The losing semi-finalists will receive Rs 1.50 lakh each, while the teams featuring in the quarter final league will get Rs 45000 each.

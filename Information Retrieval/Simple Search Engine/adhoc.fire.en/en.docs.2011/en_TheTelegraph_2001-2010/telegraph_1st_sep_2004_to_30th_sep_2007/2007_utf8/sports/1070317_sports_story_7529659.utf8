 on a high hellip; I rsquo;ve already gone on record that we rsquo;ve got the team to 

 make the semi-finals, at least. After that, who knows hellip;'

 ON THIS ALMOST SURELY BEING HIS LAST WORLD CUP

Calcutta: With Team Indias first match of the 2007 World Cup just hours away, theres an enormous emotional connect with the last edition. We lost to Australia in the final, but that tournament gave many moments of joy. The man in the hot seat then, Sourav Ganguly, went back in time for the benefit of The Telegraphs readers. 

The following are excerpts

On a hattrick of World Cups

As in the past, Im looking to perform Looking to perform under pressure The tournaments name is different Its held once in four years, but the game doesnt change For example, match situations wont change because its the World Cup Im excited Im happy that I could fight my way back 

On the 2003 World Cup-related thoughts which instantly come to mind 

(Emotionally) That we played as a team That we wanted each other to succeed That we wanted the team to succeed The bowlers had been terrific (Jawagal Srinath) Sri, Ashish Nehra (Zaheer Khan) Zak The emphatic manner in which we won nine matches (eight in succession) brings back great memories. 

[Souravs men only lost twice both times to Australia.] 

On what made that team gel, more so as the last series before the World Cup (in New Zealand) had been a disaster 

The collective will to do well in the tournament We got nailed after losing to Australia (in the second match) and, among other things, realised our reputations were at stake That people would judge us on how we performed in the World Cup (After a pause) We had the right team The balance was perfect Also, in 2003, we didnt allow the pressure to sit on us Our level of fitness was high too. 

On what made our new ball bowlers so effective 

More than anything else, their high level of skill Ive always believed if somebody is potentially good, then hes going to raise his level of cricket in tournaments like the World Cup Nehra, for example, was consistently accurate and bowled with good pace. 

On the three wins which gave most satisfaction 

The six-wicket victory over Pakistan in Centurion We got past 273 in a shade over 45 overs 

Beating New Zealand by seven wickets (again in Centurion), which confirmed that we would make the semi-finals 

 Defeating England by 82 runs in Durban That win was important as our next match had been against Pakistan 

On the three batting performances which straightaway come to mind 

Well Top of this list has to be Sachin Tendulkars 98 versus Pakistan Then, my unbeaten 107 in the Super Six match against Kenya (Cape Town) At one stage, wed been three down for 24 Sachins 97 versus Sri Lanka (Johannesburg) There were, in fact, many fine innings 

On the one stand-out bowling performance 

Has to be Nehras six for 23 (against England) in Durban. 

On the one match which truly mirrored a team effort 

Probably the one where we beat England Rahul Dravid and Sachin got fifties, while (Yuvraj Singh) Yuvi got 40-odd Then, Mohammed Kaif was brilliant in running out Nick Knight and Nehra was devastating The breakthrough (Marcus Trescothicks dismissal) had been provided by Zak 

On losing to Australia in the final 

Its a regret It still hurts, but theres also a positive side that I led Team India to the final That cant be taken away. 

On having an excellent record (844 runs at an average of 56-plus with four centuries) in World Cups 

I havent consciously tried to lift my game Perhaps, its a coincidence Of course, Im aware that the World Cup is a huge stage. The Champions Trophy as well. 

On his expectations from the latest edition 

Ill be taking it match by match Contributing under pressure is going to be critical. 

On tips for the newcomers in the squad 

Be it a bowler or batsman, theyve got to focus on one ball at a time. As Ive said, the basics dont change because its a World Cup. 

On whether tournaments such as the World Cup call for more mental toughness 

(Laughs) Every match at the international level is first played in the mind and, then, on the field. 

On those who could emerge as real big stars 

With so many quality players around, its difficult to say I dont think many had expected Andrew Symonds to make such an impact in 2003, but he did There are quite a few who could rise to the occasion 

Finally, on this almost surely being his last World Cup 

It could be, yes So, its important for me to finish it on a high Ive already gone on record that weve got the team to make the semi-finals, at least. After that, who knows

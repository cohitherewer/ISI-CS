The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Move to please captains

Dubai: Teams will have the option of making changes in the playing XI on the reserve day of a match if the toss has been held but no play is possible on the originally scheduled day. 

Calculation of net run-rate and amended role of the Match Referee were also clarified for the showpiece event at a recent pre-tournament meeting involving event officials, captains, coaches and managers of the 16 competing teams. 

During the meeting, which took place in Montego Bay, it was agreed that in the event of a toss but no play taking place on the first scheduled day of a match, the toss could take place again and the teams changed for the reserve day. 

The ICC also clarified the situations concerning the calculation of net run-rate during the tournament and the role of the Match Referee in relation to law 21.3 (umpires awarding a match). 

Explaining the decision about the re-toss on day two of a rain-ruined match, David Richardson said: Under the original playing conditions, the result of the toss was carried over to the reserve day even if a ball was not bowled on day one, but there was a groundswell of opinion against that in the meeting. 

The concerns included the fact that conditions may change overnight and that might result in a side being unfairly disadvantaged if the original toss remained in place.

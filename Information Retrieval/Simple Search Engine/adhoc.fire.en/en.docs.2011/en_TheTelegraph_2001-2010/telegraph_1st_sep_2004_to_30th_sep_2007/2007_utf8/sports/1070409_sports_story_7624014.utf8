 BCCI gets the stick

Most of the former cricketers and an ex-BCCI president on Sunday denounced the Boards radical step to curtail players endorsements terming it as unfortunate, illegal and regressive. 

Following are their reactions (alphabetically): 

CHANDU BORDE: I was talking to a few fellow-cricketers including Sunil Gavaskar and they were happy with the decisions taken. I am also happy that 95 per cent of our suggestions to the board have been accepted. 

CHETAN CHAUHAN: I do not agree with the boards decision restricting players endorsements. It is illegal. The criterion should be selection. If they do not perform they will themselves be out of the picture. But I agree with changing the contract system to match fee payment, though I feel retainership should be on because there is so much cricket now-a-days and players tend to get injured frequently. In such a case, they need some sort of security because they will be paid for only the matches they play. 

BISWANATH DUTT: I dont have details of the discussion and the reasons for the boards decision. But I feel it is not proper to reduce the earnings of any individual. 

AJAY JADEJA: I think its unfortunate the way the players have been treated... Nobody gives the endorsements when they are not performing. Players have always been accountable. Irrespective of the number of endorsements, you will still do the same amount of work and get the same money, in fact their value will go up. Not that I am supporting players. But nobody is asking any question to selectors. The players are asked to become accountable. Its only players who are answerable and get affected, if they lose. 

ARUN LAL: I totally disagree with the boards decision. If you feel that players are not performing well then just drop them but why blame sponsorships for this. If you are offering incentives and bonuses to enhance performance then what could be a better enhancer than sponsorship. If they perform well they will get sponsorships. If you think players selected are not performing well then the problem is not with the endorsements but with the selectors. 

BAPU NADKARNI: The steps taken are very good provided they are implemented properly. 

ASHOK MANKAD: it will depend on how the corporates will look into the restrictions put on players for doing endorsements. Here one cannot blame the players. 

ERAPALLI PRASANNA: I do not want to comment on endorsements since it is not under my purview. But in my opinion BCCI has worked out the existing gradation of payment in a different way, perhaps in deciding to give equal payment to seniors and juniors in the team in a way reverting to the old system. It is a right move. At least they have decided a decent sum as retainer fee. It is a best approach by the board to award incentive on matches won. 

PRANAB ROY: In this age of rising prices when the players have no source of alternative income they will be hit hard. The huge money they rake in from cricket sales, sponsorships and by allotting telecast rights comes not because of Sharad Pawar or Niranjan Shah but because of the players performance. 

RAVI SHASTRI: No one wants to deny anyone a buck. But it may happen that at a very young age, at times when you dont have the backing of education behind, you can just be caught in another world. You may lose the focus that is required to play cricket. 

ATUL WASSAN: There are some very regressive steps, specially the cap on endorsement. This does not exist anywhere in the world.

 Akram to train Pak pacers

Lahore: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram is to help train fast bowlers for the national team, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Friday. 

Wasim, Pakistans leading wicket-taker who retired in 2003, will supervise a special two-week camp in the eastern city of Lahore from mid-May, a PCB spokesman said. 

Wasims decision comes after new Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik said he wanted to emulate him and it will boost Pakistans efforts to recover after their dismal World Cup. 

PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf contacted Wasim in Singapore where he is currently working with a sports channel as a commentator, Malik said. The chairman contacted Wasim and invited him over to help Pakistan cricket and we are very happy that he has volunteered to help, he said. 

Wasim has offered all-out support to the Pakistan team to supervise the camp for young and upcoming fast bowlers. (Agencies)

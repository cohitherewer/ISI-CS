The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sunny may consider continuing

 - Chairmanship of ICC Cricket committee, which is set to be structured differently 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Arjuna Ranatunga

Calcutta: The iconic Sunil Gavaskar, who it seems had indicated to the International Cricket Council (ICC) that he wouldnt like to continue as chairman of its powerful Cricket Committee, may reconsider his stand. 

Gavaskar was in the city on Thursday but, typically, declined to comment. 

However, The Telegraphs sources have suggested he could continue beyond June (when his current term ends with the AGM) assuming, of course, hes nominated afresh and the Executive Board wants to retain him. 

Perhaps aware that Gavaskar was looking to end his seven-year innings, the Pakistan Cricket Board and Sri Lanka Cricket have been advocating the candidature of Majid Khan and Arjuna Ranatunga, respectively. 

Like Gavaskar, both are former captains and serve on the present committee. 

The Board of Control for Cricket in Indias stand isnt clear, but the Sharad Pawar regime isnt favourably disposed towards Gavaskar. 

Thats probably not insignificant. 

Indeed, theres speculation that an intra-Asia understanding may have been reached on India supporting either Pakistan or Sri Lanka on the chairmans issue in the Executive Board. 

 Majid Khan 

Bottomline, though, is that Gavaskar continues to enjoy a higher stature than Ranatunga and Majid. 

The Cricket Committee, meanwhile, is set to be structured differently. 

One understands it will now include representatives from the MCC, the umpires, the Media and even statisticians. 

Also, the chairman could have a fixed (two or three-year) term. 

The chief executives have, apparently, already given their stamp of approval. The ball is in the Executive Boards court. 

The Executive Boards next meeting is in Cape Town on March 1 and, among other things, the restructuring is going to be discussed.

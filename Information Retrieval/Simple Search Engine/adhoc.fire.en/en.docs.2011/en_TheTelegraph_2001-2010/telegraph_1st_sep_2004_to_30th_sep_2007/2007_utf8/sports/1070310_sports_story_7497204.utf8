 Injury-hit Bagan take on Sporting

 Chima Okerie 

Panaji: Injuries to their key players have put Mohun Bagan in a tight spot when they meet local champions Sporting Clube de Goa in the 11th ONGC National Football League match at the Nehru Stadium, Margao on Saturday. 

Bagan havent had a smooth sailing so far, having garnered seven points from seven outings. Injuries to star strikers Jose Ramirez Barreto, Bhaichung Bhutia, medio Tomba Singh and Dharamjit Singh have hurt them badly. 

To add to their woes, Dhravanan, Sushil Kumar Singh, Subrata Paul, Subhash Chakraborty, Mehtab Hussain and Surajit Bose are all attending Indian camp in preparation for Olympic qualifiers, leaving coach Chima Okerie 17 players to choose from. 

Sporting Clube de Goa are on eight points from seven matches. They will field the same side that played against Mohammedan Sporting with the exception of Nicolas Nath, the first overseas player of Indian origin. 

Its going to be an exciting match as Bagan are known for their high standard. My boys are all geared for the showdown and will go all out for a win, said Sporting manager Peter Valles. 

Unfazed by the absence of Barreto and Bhutia, Chima said: We do not rely on individual players. We believe in team work. We have other players who are good enough to take their places. 

Sporting is a good side but have not blossomed like us. The draw against Singapore club Tampines Rovers in the AFC Cup match before coming here has boosted our confidence. 

Meanwhile, in Fridays match at the Nehru Stadium here, Dempo continuing their good run got the better of Air India 2-1 and moved to the top of the table. 

Dempo scored through Anthony Pereira (20th) and Ranty Martins (40th), while Air India pulled one back in the 86th minute through Paresh Shivalkar.

 May hits out at glut of games

 India vs Australia 

Melbourne: The international players union on Sunday came out openly against the glut of India-Australia contests planned for later this year and early 2008. 

The two teams will face each other at least 22 times (Tests and ODIs) over a period of eight months from June and chief executive Tim May said the boards were trying to earn more money at the cost of long-term interests of the game. 

Were very seriously worried that a few countries are playing too much cricket, May was quoted as saying in a Sydney paper. Its our ongoing battle with the ICC. 

Australia and India will play three ODIs in Ireland in June, followed by seven ODIs in India in October, four Tests in Australia next summer and at least eight ODIs in the tri-series. 

They were already playing each other 18 times and now theyve thrown in another three, May said. 

The former Australian off-spinner also said the upcoming World Cup was too long and could be halved if not for TV broadcasters wanting to drag it as long as possible. 

Its getting completely out of control, May said. 

Since September, Australia have played a tri-series in Malaysia, the Champions Trophy in India, the five-Test Ashes series, the tri-series at home and the Chappell-Hadlee series in New Zealand.

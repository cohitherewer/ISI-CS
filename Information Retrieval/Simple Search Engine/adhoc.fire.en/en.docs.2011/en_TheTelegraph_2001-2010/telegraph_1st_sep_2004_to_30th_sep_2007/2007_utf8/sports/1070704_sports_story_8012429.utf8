 Ferrari fire technician 

Maranello: Ferrari has fired a British technician following an internal probe into attempted sabotage before the Monaco Grand Prix. All I can say is that Nigel Stepney is no longer our employee, Ferrari spokesman Luca Colajanni said Tuesday. 

The Formula One team has also filed a criminal complaint against Stepney. 

A mysterious powder reportedly was found on the gas tanks of Felipe Massas and Kimi Raikkonens cars on May 21, six days before the Monaco race. (AP)

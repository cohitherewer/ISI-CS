Vadodara: As of now, the talismanic Brian Lara is firm on retiring from limited overs cricket after the March-April World Cup. He will, of course, continue doing Test duty for the West Indies. 

My mind is made up... One-day cricket is taking its toll... I can feel that its getting too much for my body... Believe me, one limited overs match is equal to three days of Test cricket, Lara told The Telegraph. 

He added: I dont intend leaving the sport entirely... Im going to focus on Test cricket... Thats the form which will drive me after the World Cup, which is getting closer each day. 

But what if his team does really well in crickets numero uno tournament and theres a clamour for him to reconsider? 

I dont think anything is going to make me reverse my decision... As Ive said, one-day cricket places a very heavy demand on the body and Im 37... My knees feel the strain, Lara responded. 

Sadly, Laras last ODI innings (perhaps, the final one in all forms) in India ended with his being run out by Irfan Pathan in freak manner. Its the first time that Ive got out that way... Its not a great way to leave the stage in India, but thats sport, he remarked. 

The West Indies captain continued: Im not sure about the next Test series in India, but I hope the Eden Gardens gets a game... Ive got very fond memories of India, but Ive been wanting to play a Test in Calcutta... 

According to the International Cricket Councils Future Tours Programme, the West Indies wont feature in a Test series till November 2011. Thats a real long way off, but tours have been arranged at short notice... 

Lara, by the way, made his 290th appearance in limited overs cricket on Wednesday and is past the 10,000-run mark. Hes close to 12,000 runs in Tests. Many would die for such a CV.

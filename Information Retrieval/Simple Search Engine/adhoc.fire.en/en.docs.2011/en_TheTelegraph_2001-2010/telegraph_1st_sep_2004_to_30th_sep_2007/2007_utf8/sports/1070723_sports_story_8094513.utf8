 Sethi loses

London: Defending champion Geet Sethi warmed up late against Englands Mike Russell, but that wasnt enough as the Indian fell in the semi-finals of the World Professional Billiards meet in Leeds on Sunday. 

Eight-time title-holder Sethi suffered a 1231-1835 loss against Russell, also an eight-time champion, in a match held at the Northern Snooker Centre. (PTI)

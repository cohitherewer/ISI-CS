The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mensah a big hit in Mahindra

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: At a time when the Calcutta teams are struggling to recruit the right kind of foreign players in the National Football League (NFL), Mumbai outfit Mahindra United seems to have found a player in Ghanaian striker Andrews Pomeyie Mensah, who could suit their need. 

After Canadian International Tony Menezes and Portuguese striker Felipe Vaz Azevado failed to live up to the expectations, Mensah has become a big hit for the Mumbai side. In his very first appearance on Monday against Dempo, the Ghanaian not only scored a goal and won the Man-of-the-Match award, but also struck a great combination with the other Ghana forward Yusif Yakubu. 

He had played three years with Yakubu back in Ghana a few years back, revealed Derek Pereira, the Mahindra coach. We thought the combination will click and then took Mensah on Yakubus recommendation. 

Mehsah took no time to prove how right the Mahindra management was. The 26-year-old fast moving striker gave some deadly through passes that had the experienced Dempo defence in trouble. I consider myself a provider of the ball and I do it very well with Yakubu, Mensah later said. 

Pereira said he was also planning to register Cameroonian Midfielder Ndem Kiyeck, who has been discarded by Mohun Bagan only recently. Ndem is basically a good player and we are taking him since he is experienced to play under our conditions, said Pereira.

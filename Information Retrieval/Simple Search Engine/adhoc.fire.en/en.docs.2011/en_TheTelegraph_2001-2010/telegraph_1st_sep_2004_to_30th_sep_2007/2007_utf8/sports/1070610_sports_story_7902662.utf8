The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Inzamam must do a Sourav

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Inzamam-ul Haq 

 Chennai: Unless former 

 captain Inzamam-ul Haq does a Sourav Ganguly and convinces 

 the selectors to recall him, he wont make another 

 appearance for Pakistan. 

 If Inzy gets picked not 

 that hes ever really fit then Shoaib Malik wont 

 be able to grow as captain.. Inzys presence will intimidate 

 the players, a well-placed source told The 

 Telegraph. 

The source, who is close to happenings in Pakistan, added: The Pakistan Cricket Board has come to realise that Inzy doesnt exactly have a good influence on the team... Thats bad news for him... 

 Inzamam has retired from ODIs, but has made himself 

 available for the longer version. The 37-year-old has over 

 8,000 runs (25x100) from 119 Tests. Hes 37.

 Slow start by Jeev

Gut Larchenhof (Germany): Jeev Milkha Singh returned an even-par 72, while Jyoti Randhawa recovered from a mid-round collapse to settle for a two-over 74 on the opening day of the Mercedes-Benz Championship at Golf Club Gut Larchenhof here. 

The slow start left Jeev tied for the 49th spot, while Randhawa was in joint 65th spot. 

At the top, Englands Lee Westwood equalled the lowest score of his career when he fired a brilliant 11-under 61 in the opening round for his four-shot lead over Denmarks Soren Hansen (65). 

Jeev, who has not been able to capture the form that gave him four titles last year, had a string of 13 pars after starting from the first. 

He fired his birdie on 14th, but had a disappointing end to his day after dropping a shot on the 18th. The seasoned pro found just five of the 14 fairways and there lay his problem as he needed 28 putts. (PTI)

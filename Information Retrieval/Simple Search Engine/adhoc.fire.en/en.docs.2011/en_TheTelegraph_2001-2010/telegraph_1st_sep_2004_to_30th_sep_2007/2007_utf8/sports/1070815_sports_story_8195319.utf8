 Rooney on track for Russia trip

 - Owen available for Euro qualifiers

Wayne Rooney should be available for Englands key Euro 2008 qualifier against Russia in Moscow on October 17, according to his Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson. 

We are putting his recovery at two months, said Ferguson after scans on Rooneys left foot confirmed a hairline fracture. He will be training in that time. Yet the level of Rooneys fitness will be closely scrutinised, and particularly whether his healed foot can withstand the artificial pitch in Moscow. 

There was some good news for England on Monday when Rooneys international striking partner, Michael Owen, came unscathed through 58 minutes for Newcastle United reserves against the Unibond League side, Newcastle Blue Star, following his thigh injury. I am feeling fit, said Owen. I feel fine. I will be available for Saturday (against Aston Villa). It was only a small injury, a little niggle. 

Owen will now be available for Englands friendly against Germany next week, and next months Wembley qualifiers against Israel and Russia. Rooney will definitely miss those. United are aware from past experience that Rooneys recovery time can be unpredictable but if Fergusons two months prognosis is correct, the striker will miss eight Premier League matches, plus two Champions League group games. 

Carlos Tevez, the Argentinian who last kicked a ball in the Copa America final four weeks ago, is being rushed into action. Carlos will start on Wednesday, said Ferguson. Ferguson phoned McClaren on Sunday evening after Rooney sustained the injury when Readings Michael Duberry accidentally trod on him. 

I am obviously disappointed and I could sense Steves disappointment as well, said Ferguson. They should be able to cope without him against Israel and Russia next month and by the time we get to the October matches (against Estonia and then Russia) I would expect him to be back. 

Rooneys Moscow Mission remains fraught with danger: he needed 14 weeks to recover from a broken metatarsal after Euro 2004 and was badly out of sorts at the 2006 World Cup after being rushed back within six weeks of fracturing another metatarsal. 

David Beckhams ankle injury has flared up again and there is no chance of the Los Angeles Galaxy player playing in next weeks friendly against Germany.

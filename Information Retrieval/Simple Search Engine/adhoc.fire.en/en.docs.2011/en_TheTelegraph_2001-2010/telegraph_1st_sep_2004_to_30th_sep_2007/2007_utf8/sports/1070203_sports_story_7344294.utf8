The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Southern Empire the hot favourite 

 PRAVESH GUPTA 

 Mumbai: The crowd at the Gallops tea tables on Friday morning was bigger than usual. It was an assembly of all concerned, from the morning joggers to horse owners and professionals, and their conversation centred around the MAM Ramaswamy-owned money-spinning machine named Southern Empire. It will be an understatement to say that the S. Ganapathy-trainee is an ante-post favourite for Sundays mega-event, the 2,400m McDowell Indian Derby. 

 The Emperor is going to be the hottest order in the 75 year history of this edition of the Derby. Odds quoted on this unbeaten horse till date are unbelievable, 15-100. It means a gain of Rs 15 on every Rs 100 invested. Safruddin, an old-timer at the Mahalaxmi racecourse, informed that Balam, a great galloper in the past, had generated as much interest in this Classic in the early years of the Indian Derby. 

 The inaugural Indian Derby was held in 1943.Sundays mega-event is going to be the richest-ever Derby and it is unlikely that any other regional turf centre would ever be able to match the Rs 1 crore prize-money offered by the sponsors, the UB group.

 Ganapathy was all praise for Southern Empire. The horse has been doing his bit and expectations are high from him, he said. When told that Southern Empires Derby-victory would make the horse the 

 highest-ever stake-money winner, he retorted: We will bother about such records after the race. For the present, I need your good wishes. Please pray for me. Asked why he needed to rush his other ward, Diabolical, after winning the Hyderabad Derby, he said: Every horse deserves a chance. The two champions havent crossed swords. The stakes for the minor placings are also attractive.

 Trainer Pesi Shroff is, however, unperturbed by the reputation of Southern Empire. He reacted somewhat angrily when asked if he also considered the Derby as a one-horse race for Southern Empire. No race is won till it is over, said Pesi. 

 The record nine-time Derby-winning jockey, one of the finest jockey in his riding days, has climbed up the trainers ladder very fast. Pesis filly, Blue Ribbon, had humbled Ganapathys Guest Connection in the Ladies Derby, the 2,400m Dheeraj Indian Oaks. If the early birds are to be believed, the filly is looking further improved. However, the answer to the 2007 Derby will be found after 5 pm on Sunday when eight horses would be flagged off from the starting stalls.

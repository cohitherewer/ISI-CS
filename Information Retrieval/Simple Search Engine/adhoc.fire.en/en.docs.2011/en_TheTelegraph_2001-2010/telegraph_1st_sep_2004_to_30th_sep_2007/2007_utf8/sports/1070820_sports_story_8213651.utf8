 BENGAL BRIGADE

DEEP DASGUPTA 

Wicketkeeper-batsman Deep Dasgupta, who has played eight Tests (344 runs with one century), led Bengal in the last two seasons when they finished runners-up. He gave up his preferred opening slot for the sake of the team, lending solidity to the middle-order. His inspirational leadership went a long way in Bengals success. 

 LAXMI RATAN SHUKLA 

The allrounder, who featured in three ODIs during the late Nineties, has been out of favour with the national selectors but has been consistent during the past few seasons. His enthusiasm and ability to come good in a crisis always separated him from the rest. 

 SHIV SAGAR SINGH 

A member of the India squad to the Under-19 World Cup in South Africa, the left-arm spinners career didnt take off as expected. His indifferent form often left him out of the Bengal squad during the past few seasons. 

 SUBHAMOY DAS 

The exciting middle-order batsman has been in and out of the Bengal team for the last couple of seasons. Having been forced to open because of a packed middle-order last season, he didnt lose focus and performed well. 

 AVISHEK JHUNJHUNWALA 

The young middle-order batsman played a stellar role in Bengals success last season. His performance was rewarded when he was chosen among the probables for the ICC World Twenty20. 

 SUBHAJIT PAUL 

The young wicketkeeper-batsman has been consistent in the limited opportunities he got. He made a big impact during his tours with the India Under-19 side. 

 EKLAKH AHMED 

The right-arm mediumpacer was part of the Bengal squad last season but couldnt retain his place after Ashok Dindas return. He is supposed to be an exciting prospect.

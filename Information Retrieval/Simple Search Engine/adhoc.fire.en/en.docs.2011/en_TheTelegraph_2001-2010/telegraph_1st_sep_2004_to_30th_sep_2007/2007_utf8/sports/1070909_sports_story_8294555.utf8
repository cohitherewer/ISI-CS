 Pugilists bag 2 golds, 1 silver

New Delhi: Indian pugilists put up their best ever performance at the World Cadet Boxing Championships, clinching two gold medals and one silver in the sixth edition of the event at Baku, Azerbaijan on Saturday. 

Vikas Yadav (48kg) and Vipin Kumar (50kg) bagged the gold, while Umesh Yadav (46kg) settled for the silver as India ended its brilliant campaign at the Baku Sports Hall this afternoon. 

Umesh started the proceedings on Saturday but faltered at the final hurdle where he was outscored by local favourite Elvin Isayev. The Indian trailed 6-21 before referee stopped the contest in the second round. However, Vikas and Vipin soon brought back the cheers claiming the top honours in their respective categories. 

In 48kg finals, Vikas won a closely contested bout against Romanian Ciprian Apodaresei to clinch the gold. (PTI)

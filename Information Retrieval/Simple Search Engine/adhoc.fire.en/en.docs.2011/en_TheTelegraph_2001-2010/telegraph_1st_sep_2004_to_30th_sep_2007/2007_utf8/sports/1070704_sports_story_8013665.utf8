 Justine only getting better

Wimbledon: A year after reaching the Wimbledon final, Justine Henin is even better on grass. 

The top-ranked Belgian, who lost to Amelie Mauresmo in last years championship match at the All England Club, reached the quarter finals on Monday by beating Patty Schnyder of Switzerland 6-2, 6-2. 

I improved a lot in my game on grass from last year, Henin said. Everything started here for me in Wimbledon with (a) different kind of game, moving forward, go to the net a little bit more. 

My serve has been good in my first four matches now. And probably the other players dont like it that much, so its good. 

Henin reached all four Grand Slam finals last year, but won only the French Open. This year, she skipped the Australian Open for personal reasons and then won her fourth title and third in a row at Roland Garros. 

Through four rounds at Wimbledon this year, Henin has lost only 15 games. 

I did my job perfectly until now, said Henin, who was watched by Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. Hes such an interesting guy what he did for his club, said Henin.

 Yoga lessons for Team India

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Working with yoga experts during conditioning camps is nothing new with Team India players. The latest expert to be added to the list is Sukhdev Kumar. 

The yoga guru, who flew in from Singapore on Wednesday evening, had a session at the team hotel Thursday morning. Sukhdev has worked with athletes in different sports, including the likes of Jyoti Randhawa and Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore. 

A pranayam session, which lasted around 45 minutes, took place after the players came back from the Eden and were through with their pool activities. Sachin Tendulkar, who hurt his ankle on the opening day of the conditioning camp, however, did not take part. 

Sukhdev stressed on the relaxation factor and performed various methods of pranayam. The players were reminded about the importance of taking care of the mind along with the body. 

The sessions are likely to be held twice from Friday. The morning session will be at the hotel and the players will then move to the Eden for fitness and fielding drills. In the evening, the yoga classes will be held after nets once the players are back to the hotel. 

The players were impressed with his methods and felt it would help in improving their focus and concentration. The stress and demands of modern day sport can also be overcome if practised regularly. Having dealt with world class sportsmen, Sukhdevs experience is also coming in handy. 

Not just content with his session at the hotel, Sourav Ganguly requested him to show a few stretching and cooling down techniques after nets on Thursday. Sukhdev happily obliged as the former India captain spent a good 15 minutes with him. 

Ravi Shastri has urged the team to forget the World Cup disappointment and concentrate on the present. Sukhdevs methods could serve in adding fresh vigour to the players.

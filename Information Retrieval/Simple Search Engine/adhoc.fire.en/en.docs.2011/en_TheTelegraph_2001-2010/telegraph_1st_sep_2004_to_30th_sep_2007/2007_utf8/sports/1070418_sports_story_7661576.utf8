 Trent cooks up an Irish flavour in Caribbean extravaganza 

 Trent Johnston 

Bridgetown: From the country that gave you river dance, Ireland can now boast the chicken and the ferret. 

The Irish teams World Cup campaign, which has accounted for Pakistan and Bangladesh, has also spawned a couple of new moves which would definitely look out of place at all self-respecting night clubs. 

Captain Trent Johnston celebrates the fall of a wicket with a bizarre jig which involves leaping from one foot to the other while flapping his arms. 

The chicken dance came out of when I am out on the dance floor, the guys say I look like a chicken so thats just a celebratory dance Ive given to the guys, said Johnston. 

And we also have Dave Langford-Smith who does the ferret as well. Its just a bit of fun. We are having fun and enjoying ourselves. 

Langford-Smith, who, like Johnston is Australian, pioneered the ferret at his wedding reception. 

He then performed it at a party in Jamaica to celebrate the win over Pakistan last month. It came out again in the victory against Bangladesh. 

The ferret looks a bit like the chicken except the arms do their flapping behind the back not at the sides. 

Thankfully, some cricketers have more style than others when it comes to celebrating the downfall of an opponent. 

Brett Lee, one of the worlds fastest bowlers, is just one of them. 

When the blond Aussie bomber knocked over a victim, it was greeted with a vigorous leap that a high-jumper would have been proud of before he would fall to his knees and perform his famous chainsaw action. 

It has been widely imitated even stretching to the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne last year when Aussie weightlifter Simon Heffernan celebrated his silver medal with a combination of Brett Lee and a little Lleyton Hewitt. 

His successful lift led to the chainsaw, a double windmill, a groin thrust and the Hewitt Cmon! yell. 

The groin thrust was just wrong, said the 30-year-old. 

I wouldnt do that again. I think about Lleyton a bit. I dont like how he carries on but I respect that he lives here and he is a good husband. He doesnt live overseas and he pays his taxes. But Brett Lee is my favourite. 

Back on the cricket pitch, England fast bowler Simon Jones was in hot water in the epic 2005 Ashes series after he was fined 1,000 pounds for the send-off he gave to Australian opener Matthew Hayden in the second Test. 

Jones was fined for pointing Hayden back to the pavilion. 

Things happen in the heat of the moment and sometimes you cant control what youre doing, said Jones. 

Someone else takes over and its a great feeling but you may look back on it and think, what was I doing? 

In future Im going to have to learn maybe to calm myself down a bit. 

Stuart MacGill, the Australian leg-spinner, had the opposite problem to Jones. His actions at the crease were too tame, so he decided to take a leaf out of Andrew Flintoffs book. 

MacGill now raises his finger but insists it is not a send-off gesture. Ive been trying to think of something else so I thought Id try a Freddie and point to the sky, he said.

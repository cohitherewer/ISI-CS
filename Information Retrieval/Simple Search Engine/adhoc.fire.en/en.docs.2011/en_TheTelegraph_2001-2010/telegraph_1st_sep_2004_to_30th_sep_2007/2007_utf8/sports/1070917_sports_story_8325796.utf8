 Jeev 38th, Jyoti 61st

Gut Larchenhof (Germany): Jeev Milkha Singh slipped two places to 38th after hitting five birdies and five bogeys for a par 72 in the third round of the Mercedes-Benz golf championship. 

Fellow-Indian Jyoti Randhawa shot a 74 and was lying 61st. 

Danish duo Thomas Bjorn and Soren Hansen were in the joint lead after both ended on 12 under-par 204. Bjorn posted a superb 66 while Hansen endured a bumpy 71. 

Jeev began with birdies on the first and third before dropping bogeys on the fourth and fifth. Two more bogeys came on the eighth and ninth. 

On the return, he birdied the 10th, dropped a shot on the 12th and picked up a birdie on 15th and then bogeyed the 18th for third time.

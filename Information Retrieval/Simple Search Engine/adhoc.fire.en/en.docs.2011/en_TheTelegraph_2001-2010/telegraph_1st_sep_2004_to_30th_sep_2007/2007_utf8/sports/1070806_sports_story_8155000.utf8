The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ban Sreesanth for a Test

 - There cant be a more cowardly action than a beamer: Atherton 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Sreesanth 

Calcutta: Michael Atherton, former England captain and opener, has called for a one-match ban on Sreesanth, saying the Indian mediumpacers bowling in the second Test was completely counter to the spirit of the game. 

Sreesanth delivered a beamer to Kevin Pietersen and later a two-foot no-ball to Paul Collingwood on Day IV of the Trent Bridge Test. He also shouldered rival captain Michael Vaughan, for which he was handed a fine of 50 per cent of his match fee. 

In his column for The Sunday Telegraph, Atherton said a beamer whether bowled deliberately or not was a serious offence, and asked Team India captain Rahul Dravid to set the right example by benching Sreesanth for the final Test. 

Since the Match Referee, Ranjan Madugalle, remained silent on the issue, it is Rahul Dravid who should take appropriate disciplinary action ahead of The Oval Test. Even if he doesnt want to take disciplinary action, he should ask himself: Does he really want a bowler who so obviously cannot control his emotions to play in such a crunch encounter? 

If bowled deliberately, there cannot be a more cowardly action on a cricket field; if bowled accidentally it (the beamer) is still potentially lethal. Either way it should incur an immediate one-match ban, Atherton said. 

Sreesanth immediately apologised to Pietersen but Atherton doubted his sincerity. 

Certainly, Sreesanth apologised to Pietersen immediately by raising his right hand but he was quick enough to turn to his mark leaving the batsman to dust himself down unattended. 

Moreover, an apology doesnt necessarily mean it is sincere. With Match Referees on the prowl, any bowler with an ounce of survival instinct is bound to apologise, deliberately bowled or not. And the batsman/batting side has no option but to accept it, for if it is not accepted then the moral high ground shifts in favour of the bowler, whose integrity is suddenly in question. 

The former England captain rated the beamer incident as more disturbing than the Jellygate, which was puerile and harmless. 

Predictably enough, it was Jellygate, not Sreesanths beamer or his deliberate overstepping of the front line by a yard to bowl a rapid bouncer, which dominated the headlines. 

Whoever was responsible for leaving the sugary sweet has had a swift reminder that Test cricket, especially involving India, is a serious business. It was a puerile prank gone wrong; harmless, silly and unlikely to be repeated and not very smart, either, since it has alerted everyone to the method used by England to try to induce some extra swing. 

But when it came to the beamer, Atherton felt that incident was solely responsible for souring the relationship between the two teams. 

Only one man, Sreesanth himself, knows whether it was deliberate... But I have no doubt that Sreesanths rancorous spell Was the most glaring in the match of something that ran completely counter to the spirit of the game. 

Atherton said that by fining Sreesanth for a shoulder nudge and not the beamer, the International Cricket Council has once again chose irrelevancies over important issues. 

By fining Sreesanth 50 per cent of his match fee for a shoulder nudge that could have inflicted no physical damage and ignoring the beamer which could have maimed a less alert batsman, the ICC once again showed a liking for the irrelevancies over the issues that matter. 

Mirroring the ICCs misguided sense of priorities, there was little comment in the media about Sreesanths delivery. 

This is partly because only one man, Sreesanth himself, knows whether it was deliberate, he said.

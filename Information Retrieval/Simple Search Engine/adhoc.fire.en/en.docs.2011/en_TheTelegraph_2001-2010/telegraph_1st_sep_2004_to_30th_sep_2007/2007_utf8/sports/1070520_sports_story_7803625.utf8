The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Whatmore lets cat out of bag!

 - Hello Niranjan... 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Somebody known to The 

 Telegraph called Dav Whatmore around 7 pm on Saturday 

 at the Peninsula Hotel. Without waiting for the caller to 

 speak, Bangladeshs outgoing coach chirpily said hello 

 Niranjan... 

Hed assumed the caller was Niranjan Shah, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary! 

Whatmore quickly recovered, but let the proverbial cat out of the bag, strongly indicating that a line of communication had been established between him and the BCCI. 

It couldnt be confirmed, but earlier in the day, an office-bearer of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) probably introduced the Australian to two BCCI officials at the Shaheed Stadium. 

That was a few hours after president (and Union minister) Sharad Pawar, vice-president Rajeev Shukla, chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty and Shah winged their way to Chittagong from Mumbai aboard a special flight. 

Theyve gone on an invitation from the BCB and are scheduled to return on Sunday afternoon. 

Shah, of course, chose to be discreet. Im available if Whatmore wants to meet me, he declared, adding that the BCCI was aware of his keenness to become Greg Chappells full-time successor. 

Yet, Shah suggested nobody would make any commitment as a seven-member special committee had been given the responsibility of selecting Team Indias next coach. 

Headed by Pawar, the committee has three former captains heavyweights Srinivas Venkatraghavan, Sunil Gavaskar and (interim cricket manager) Ravi Shastri. Shah, joint-secretary Mohinder Pandove and treasurer N. Srinivasan are the other members. 

Incidentally, talking exclusively, Whatmore dismissed reports that somebody in the BCB had directed him to stay away from the Shahs. Im not aware of such a directive. 

Whatmores four-year contract with the BCB ended with the World Cup, but he agreed to stay on for the current tour by India. 

Strangely, Shah maintained that the BCCI hadnt exactly drawn up a list of candidates. 

There could eventually be three-four names Right now, though, we dont have a list Things will be clear on June 4, when the special committee meets in Bangalore. 

Whatever, as first reported in these columns almost a week ago, Whatmore is the frontrunner. 

However, some within the BCCI are in favour of bringing back New Zealander John Wright, who worked with the Rahul Dravids from November 2000 till April 2005. 

Given that Shastri is wearing two hats, he may be the one to arrange an informal meeting between a couple of the BCCI officials and Whatmore. 

But Shastri, too, played it safe. 

First, let me meet Mr Pawar and the others, he pointed out, on returning to the team hotel. 

Meanwhile, speaking to newspersons after stumps on Day II, centurion Sachin Tendulkar made the following comment: I have no idea about the June 4 meeting We hope our inputs are considered We also hope its going to be a unanimous decision 

Two years ago, in the lead-up to Chappells appointment, quite a few players favoured somebody younger (and less high-profile), like Tom Moody. 

Among other things, though, Moodys inferior presentation cleared the way for Chappell. 

 Had he been available, Moody would definitely have 

 stood out as the BCCIs No. 1 choice this time.

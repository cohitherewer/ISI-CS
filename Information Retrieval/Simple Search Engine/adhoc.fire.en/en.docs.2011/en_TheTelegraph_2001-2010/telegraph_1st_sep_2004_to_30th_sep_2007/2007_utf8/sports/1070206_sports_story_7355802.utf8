 Nielsen to succeed Buchanan

 - Hes an ideal man to lead us to the future, says incumbent coach 

Melbourne: New Australia coach Tim Nielsen said the future of the worlds leading cricket team was in safe hands even after the retirement of some of the games highest profile names. 

In an earlier announcement on Monday, Cricket Australia (CA) said Nielsen will succeed John Buchanan as Australia coach. 

Nielsen, who spent three years working as an assistant to Buchanan, will take over the mantle when Buchanan stands down following the World Cup in the West Indies which starts next month. 

Nielsen, 38, is a former first-class wicketkeeper-batsman who had spent the past two years working as head coach of CAs Centre of Excellence in Brisbane. 

I think this is an outstanding appointment for Australian cricket, the team and the coaching profession, Buchanan said in a statement. 

He is an ideal man, together with the Australian captain, to take the Australian team into the future. 

Buchanan replaced Geoff Marsh as national coach in 1999 and oversaw one of the most successful eras in Australian cricket history before announcing in August that he was quitting after the World Cup. 

During Buchanans time in charge, Australia won the 2003 World Cup in South Africa, and set world records for the most consecutive Test and one-day wins. 

Im incredibly proud, honoured and excited to have been offered this opportunity. Moving forward, this job represents a great opportunity to work with a fine group of players who are an excellent cricket team, Nielsen said. 

Filling Johns shoes will be a big job. He is a leading light in cricket coaching globally and his record speaks for itself. 

Skipper Ricky Ponting said Nielsen had a strong rapport with the players because of his experience as a player and his previous coaching roles. 

On a personal level Im delighted, having played against Tim and having worked with him when he was assistant coach, Ponting said. We have an excellent working relationship and Im looking forward to the challenges that lie ahead. 

Nielsen played 101 first-class matches for South Australia before retiring in 1999 to begin a career as a coach and was the hot favourite to replace Buchanan after Sri Lanka coach Tom Moody pulled out of the running. 

Meanwhile, Nielsen feels Australian cricket was strong enough to cope without Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Justin Langer. 

The trio, as well as batsman Damien Martyn, made their final appearances for the Test side during the 5-0 Ashes whitewash of England, while the clock is also ticking on the Test careers of 35-year-olds Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden. 

Weve seen a lot of talented players, (but) you cant replace superstars, Nielsen said at a news conference in Melbourne on Monday. 

Youre talking about some of the best players in the history of the game in terms of those two (Warne and McGrath). You cant expect two guys to come in and take over their workload and their results. 

We need to be conscious that we have 12 or 15 players and move forward together as a group and get 1200 wickets in maybe bits and pieces, not in outstanding persons as we had in Warne and McGrath. I cant imagine well have another Warne, but ideally well have another player that comes along and takes a lot of Test wickets. (REUTERS)

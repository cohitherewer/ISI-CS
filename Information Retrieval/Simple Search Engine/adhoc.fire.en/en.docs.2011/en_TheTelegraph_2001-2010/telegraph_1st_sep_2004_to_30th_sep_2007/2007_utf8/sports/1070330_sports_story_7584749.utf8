 SA survive 

 Malingas 4 in 4 scare 

 CHRISTOPHER MARTIN-JENKINS

 Two 

 unique bowlers made the first international at the Providence 

 Stadium ultimately unforgettable. A timely two wickets in 

 two balls by Muttiah Muralidharan, followed by a sensational 

 four wickets in four balls by Lasith Malinga, the first 

 four in four in international cricket, conjured a thrilling 

 finish out of what had seemed like a comfortable South Africa 

 victory. 

 With five overs remaining, they 

 needed only five to win with five wickets in hand. Jacques 

 Kallis was apparently easing them to victory after a cool, 

 classy innings but Malinga then bowled Shaun Pollock with 

 a slower ball of full length. Andrew Hall miscued his first 

 ball to extra cover, whereupon Kallis was caught behind, 

 driving at an outswinger off the first ball of the 47th 

 over. 

 It gave the shock-haired slinger 

 who has added such crucial potency to Sri Lankas fast 

 bowling a maiden international hattrick. 

 South Africa still needed three 

 runs to overhaul Sri lankas modest 209 and Makhaya 

 Ntini was bowled first ball amid wild excitement. 

 Chaminda Vaas maintained the tension 

 with a typically accurate over but a one-wicket victory 

 was secured in the end when Robin Peterson, after several 

 near misses, snicked a drive at the second ball of the 49th 

 over to the third-man boundary. 

 Graeme Smiths bullish 59 

 and his sides razor-sharp performance in the field 

 had laid the basis for what in the end was a deserved victory 

 in conditions a slowish pitch, 75-yard boundaries and 

 sharp turn for Muralidharan that suited Sri Lanka better. 

 Mahela Jayawardene had chosen 

 to bat first in the belief that a white-brown pitch would 

 get slower but boundaries significantly bigger than is normal 

 for the Caribbean at the brand new Providence Stadium limited 

 Sri Lanka to 209. 

 Charl Langeveldt was the main 

 beneficiary, bowling straight and on a length to record 

 career-best one-day figures of five for 39. His was a vital 

 contribution but no more so than Kalliss perfectly 

 paced innings full of elegant drives, nor Smiths 65-ball 

 innings in which he hit seven fours and the only six of 

 the day. Teething problems 

 at the new stadium such as an unwanted loudspeaker inside 

 the roof of the press box were efficiently dealt with. Someone 

 simply came in with an 18-foot ladder and cut the wire.

 SRI LANKA-SOUTH AFRICA REVIEW

 The 97-run stand between Tillekeratne Dilshan and Russel 

 Arnold was the best six-wicket stand for Sri Lanka in World 

 Cup, bettering the 84-run partnership between Arjuna Ranatunga 

 and Romesh Kaluwitharana against England at Lord rsquo;s 

 in 1999.

 Charl Langeveldt (5/39) joined two other South Africans, 

 Lance Klusener and Shaun Pollock, to claim a five-wicket 

 haul in World Cup.

 Langeveldt rsquo;s both ODI lsquo;five-for rsquo; hauls 

 happened in the West Indies. His previous such haul mdash; 

 5/62 came against the West Indies in Bridgetown in May 2005

 Lasith Malinga, who became the fifth bowler to claim a hattrick 

 in World Cup, became the first to take four wickets in four 

 successive balls in international cricket (Tests and ODIs). 

 The only other bowler who came close to doing it in ODIs 

 was Saqlain Mushtaq. The Pakistan off-spinner took four 

 wickets in five balls against Zimbabwe at Peshawar in 1996. 

 For the record, it was the 24th hattrick in ODIs.

 Graeme Smith became the fifth batsman to hit four fifty-plus 

 scores in a row in the World Cup. The others are: David 

 Boon, Graeme Fowler, Navjyot Singh Sidhu and Sachin Tendulkar 

 (twice). However, Smith became the first captain to achieve 

 this feat in World Cup.

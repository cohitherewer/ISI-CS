 Boucher to lead as Pollock declines

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Mark Boucher 

Bangalore: Mark Boucher will captain Africa in the three-match Afro-Asia Cup as first choice-replacement for Graeme Smith, senior pro Shaun Pollock, declined to lead and suggested that the wicketkeeper-batsman be given the job. 

The selectors offered the captaincy to Shaun, but he felt it should go to the younger Boucher... That hed just undergone minor foot surgery may have contributed to his decision, the Africa Cricket Association chief executive, Cassim Suliman, told The Telegraph. 

Smith made himself unavailable as hes recovering from knee surgery. Jacques Kallis and Makhaya Ntini have also pulled out. 

The 30-year-old Boucher has captained South Africa in four Tests and one ODI. That, however, was back in 2002 and 2003. 

Boucher and the other South Africans arrived here late on Monday. Owing to the surgery, Pollock (who turns 34 next month) wont bowl in the tournament. 

Footnote: Till the evening, nobody had come forward to sponsor the Mahela Jayawardene-led Asian side. The Africans, it seems, have roped in Sahara Computers.

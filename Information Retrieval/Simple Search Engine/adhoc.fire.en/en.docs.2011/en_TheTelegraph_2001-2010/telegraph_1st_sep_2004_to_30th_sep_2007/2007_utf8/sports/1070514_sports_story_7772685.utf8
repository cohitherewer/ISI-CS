 Chopra slips to tied 64th

Ponte Vedra: A nightmarish front-nine put paid to Indian-born Swede Daniel Chopras hopes of a decent finish in the Players Championship as he shot a four-over 76 to slide to tied 64th after the penultimate round here. 

Chopra, who was tied 26th overnight, stumbled to four bogeys and a double-bogey against just two birdies to take his total to five-over 221 for 54 holes. 

In what turned out to be a thoroughly disappointing day for the Swede, Chopra made a poor start dropping a shot on the second hole before a double bogey on the third. 

Chopra was tied for 64th with world No.1 Tiger Woods, who shot his third successive over-par round of 73 after returning 75 and 73 on the first two days. 

Meanwhile, American Sean Hair took the lead after three rounds even as compatriot Phil Mickelson stayed in close touch with a 69 and a total of eight-under 208.

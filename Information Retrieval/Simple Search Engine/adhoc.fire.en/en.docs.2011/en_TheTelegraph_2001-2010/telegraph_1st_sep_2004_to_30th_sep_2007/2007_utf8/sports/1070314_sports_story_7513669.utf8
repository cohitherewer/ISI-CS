Karachi: Pakistan batsman Mohammed Yousuf has refused to be photographed for a special World Cup campaign launched by a major sponsor of the team and the Pakistan Cricket Board. 

The cellular company Mobilink is running a big campaign with members of the Pakistan team for the World Cup with Yousuf conspicuous by his absence. 

A spokesman for the company, which has a contract with the board and players, said Yousuf had declined to be photographed. 

We photographed the entire team but Mohammed Yousuf requested not to be photographed for his personal reasons, the spokesman said on Tuesday. 

Yousuf, who converted to Islam from Christianity two years back, has become a staunch Muslim, growing a beard and following Islamic teachings. 

It is a personal decision of Yousuf and we cant interfere in someones religious beliefs, said Saleem Altaf, PCB director, cricket operations.

Arthurs scary games 

Basseterre: South African coach Mickey Arthur warned his team not to slip up in their matches against minnows The Netherlands and Scotland before they take on Australia in the World Cup. 

I have always described the games against The Netherlands and Scotland as two scary games and we dont want any slip-ups in these games, Arthur told reporters on Monday. 

According to him, Graeme Smiths men are eager to justify their number one ranking in the World Cup. 

This is the proper competition and were really keen to get underway, Arthur told reporters soon after the squads arrival late on Monday. 

We have given the guys a little bit of leeway up until now, but this is where the serious stuff starts. The honeymoon is over, if you like, Arthur said.

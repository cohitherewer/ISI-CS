 Weve ample talent and potential: Prasad

Bangalore: Rahul Dravids men may have cut a sorry figure in the World Cup but Indias newly-appointed bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad does not consider it a crisis situation, and believes the team can bounce back. 

Well, I really dont see the current situation as a crisis. I feel if someone is mentioning about the World Cup, its just one game (against Bangladesh) that we lost which could have happened to anybody. I would not really read too much into it because we have done fantastic things in the past, Prasad said. 

He said India had quality players in the ranks with enough potential and experience and would soon be back to their winning ways. 

We have ample talent and potential. They all can deliver the goods. The experience and exposure of our players should not be forgotten. The team is too good, he said. 

The former pacer also said that Dravid had spoken to him a couple of days before the official announcement, informing him that he was going to suggest his name for the bowling coachs post. 

Asked how he planned to approach the job, Prasad said: Ive got to speak to the players and know their view points and ideas and carry on from there. Im just waiting to meet the bowlers I will be working with. 

He, however, was not sure whether he would be assisting the spinners too. 

Well Im not really sure about that. Im just waiting for the BCCI to define my role. Probably in 3-4 days time, Rahul, myself and the others will be sitting down chalking out strategies. Im just waiting for the team selection to finish. 

Prasad said his new responsibility was a great thing to happen, for he always wanted to be involved with the game and give back whatever he has learnt. It was also great challenge for him, he admitted. 

Im looking forward to it which no doubt is a great challenge. I would like to do the job to the best of my ability, having done the coaching courses not just in India, but abroad as well. 

Pasad was with the England and Wales Cricket Board for a Level-III coaching course after doing a similar course in India. 

He coached the under-19 team, been bowling coach with the National Cricket Academy for the last 3-4 years and also guided the Karnataka state team.

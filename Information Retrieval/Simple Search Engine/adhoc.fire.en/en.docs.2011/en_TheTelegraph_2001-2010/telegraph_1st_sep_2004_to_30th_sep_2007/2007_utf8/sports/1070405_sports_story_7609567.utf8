The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The highlights 

 Shaun

 Pollocks two wickets for 17 runs puts him on a par with Sri Lankan Chamida

 Vaas with 377 wickets each. They now occupy the joint fourth position among

 top wicket-takers in ODIs. Only Wasim Akram (502), Muttiah Muralidharan (443)

 and Waqar Younis (416) are ahead of the duo. 

 Graeme Smith (41, when on 26) became the 6th South African and the 65th batsman overall in ODIs to aggregate 4000 runs. He now has 4015 runs in 109 matches. 

 Thanks to his unbeaten 66, Jacques Kallis now occupies the tenth position among top run-getters in ODIs. He now has 8848 runs which took him past Saeed Anwars tally of 8823 runs. 

 AB de Villiers managed to record his third duck of his WC career all coming in this tournament. He now has most WC ducks than any South African batsman. 

 If he manages another duck, De Villiers can have the dubious record of most ducks by a batsman in a single WC tournament. As of now, seven batsmen including the South African have three ducks each.

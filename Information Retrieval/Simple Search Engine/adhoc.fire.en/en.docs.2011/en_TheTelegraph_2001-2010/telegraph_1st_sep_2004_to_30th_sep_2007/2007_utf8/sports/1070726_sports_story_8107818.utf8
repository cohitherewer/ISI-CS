 CSA, players sign MoU

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Cricket South Africa (CSA), South African Cricketers Association (SACA) and the six professional franchises have signed a ground-breaking agreement which will make professional players genuine stakeholders in the game. 

This was announced at a media conference in Johannesburg on Wednesday by CSA president Norman Arendse and SACA CEO Tony Irish, according to information received here. 

Arendse touted this as the first comprehensive agreement of its kind in South African sport and as a business model for professional cricket for the next three years. 

The model enables longer term financial forecasting and planning for the provision of funds to amateur cricket for the development of the game. 

The MoU standardises contracts and benefits for players, regulates the number of playing contracts, provides for salary minimums and salary caps and for optimal use of SAs player resources through regulations relating to player transfers, player loan outs and playing overseas in the off-season. 

Irish said: The original initiative for the MoU came from the SACA and the players. We had a good look at what we believed was best practice relating to professional cricketers around the world. 

Ashwell Prince, president of the SACA, said: We are aware that more will be expected of us as players in the future. As far as we are concerned, the No.1 stakeholder in the game is the public. The way we play our cricket and how we contribute to the game both on and off the field in the eyes of the public will be the key.

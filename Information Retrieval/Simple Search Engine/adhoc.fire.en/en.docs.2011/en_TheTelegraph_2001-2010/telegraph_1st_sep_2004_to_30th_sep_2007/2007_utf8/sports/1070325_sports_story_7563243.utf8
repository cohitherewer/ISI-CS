 Lara: We need to up the ante

Kingston: Brian Lara said he was pleased with the consistency shown by his side after the West Indies notched up their third straight win in the World Cup. 

Laras side has suffered dramatic shifts in form over the past two years and were bowled out for 85 by India in a warm-up game on the eve of the tournament. 

On Friday, though, they were untroubled by the Irish as the hosts followed up their wins over Pakistan and Zimbabwe with another good result. With both the West Indies and Ireland having qualified for the Super Eight, Laras team will carry two points to the next stage. 

We have played solid cricket throughout the three games. We have been very consistent, we are building as we head into the big games, he said after Shivnarine Chanderpauls unbeaten century had guided his side to a comfortable eight-wicket win. 

The West Indies face Australia in their opening Super Eight game in Antigua on Tuesday. 

Despite watching his side knock off a target of 190 with the loss of just two wickets, Lara said he wanted to see more initiative from his batsmen in the next stage. 

I am really comfortable with the guys in the field, we just need to up the ante when we have the bat in hand, he said.

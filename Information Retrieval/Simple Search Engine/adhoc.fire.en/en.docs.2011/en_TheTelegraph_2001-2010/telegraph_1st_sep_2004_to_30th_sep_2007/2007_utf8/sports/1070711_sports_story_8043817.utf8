The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Delhi to host Indias only 2 Challengers

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The country will get to host its first (and only) ATP Challengers of the year only in November-December. It will be a back-to-back affair in New Delhi, both being $50,000 events. 

The ATP has cleared the dates (from November 26 and December 3) it will soon be on the calendar, said an AITA functionary. 

This will be music to the ears of Rohan Bopanna amp; Co. Desperately in need of points to improve their ATP rankings, the higher-ranked Indian players having graduated from the Futures level look to play as many Challenger meets as possible. 

Unfortunately, tournaments at home have been few and far between in the last four years. A look at the figures will be self-explanatory this year, India will be hosting two Challengers; they had two in 2006, none in 2005 and 2004, four in 2003, none in 2002 and two in 2001. 

Those are too few for a country which now hosts two ATP International Series events. A big ATP event is good for the fans, but its the Challengers (and other lower level meets) which can help the Indian players grow. 

We definitely need more Challengers in our country, Leander Paes told The Telegraph. Our boys will then have less travelling to do in search of points and can use the home advantage. 

It was so refreshing to hear Rohan winning a Challenger in Ireland. He could have used this success to further improve his rankings had there been a couple of Challengers at home. 

Bopanna won not just the singles title, but the doubles as well on Saturday in Dublin. It was the Indian number ones maiden triumph at this level and took his singles ranking up to 234 within striking distance of his career-high 230.

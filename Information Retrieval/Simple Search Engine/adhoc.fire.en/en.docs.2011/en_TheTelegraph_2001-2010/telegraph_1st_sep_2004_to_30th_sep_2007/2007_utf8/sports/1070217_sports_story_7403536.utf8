 Dope tests on Shoaib, Asif later

Karachi: Pakistan fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif did not appear for dope tests carried out Friday by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) medical panel on players and reserves selected in the World Cup squad. 

Both the bowlers are in London seeking medical opinion on their knee and elbow injuries which could put them out of the World Cup. 

They will undertake the dope tests as soon as they return from London, a PCB official said. 

The medical panel tested 14 players excluding captain, Inzamam-ul Haq who will also appear for the test on Saturday. 

Meanwhile, the public spat between Shoaib and Bob Woomer has taken a new twist with a newspaper claiming that the Pakistan coach had used abusive language with racial overtones against the fast bowler during a heated argument in South Africa.

 QUOTE UNQUOTE

 ON THE DAY HE WAS APPOINTED COACH 

 I never played in India, but Im aware of the passion... Coaching any international side is a privilege, more so when its not your country. Ive landed the most exciting job in cricket. 

 Much needs to be done to reach the next level. To be on a par with Australia, India have to put in the same if not a bigger effort Commitment to excellence is non-negotiable. Discipline, too, is non-negotiable. 

 Cricket teams are driven by captains and players the coach is only a facilitator. 

ON COMPLETING A YEAR 

 Weve come a long way down the track in the one-dayers, not so in Tests. By and large, Im reasonably happy 

 Ive identified three areas: Fitness, fielding and the running between wickets... We need to get better at all three... Also, weve got to apply the processes better in Test cricket. 

 You need a team culture, not a star culture... In the long run, a team culture alone is going to survive. 

AFTER INDIAS WIN IN THE JOHANNESBURG

 TEST 

 Sourav has always been a strong character and his will and desire to play for India has been second to none... At one team meeting, Sourav revealed that the realisation that cricket wasnt everything in life had taken the pressure off him... Sourav, I think, is more relaxed now 

 If he (Sourav) does the things he did in the game here, he has quite a long career ahead of him. Mentally, he looked a different batsman. Everybodys relationship with him is fineIts not about Greg Chappell and Sourav Ganguly, its about Indian cricket. 

 For a team to be good, a strong leadership group is required... The coaching staff had done what it could do and, now, it was time for the leadership group to take over... Rahul involved the seniors (in a bigger way) as its not possible for one man to do everything. The responsibility of captaining, including the emotional side, had become too much... The workload, the mentoring... It had to be shared... 

BEFORE DEPARTING FOR THE WORLD CUP 

 Sachin has the talent, the experience and has the creativity... He has the mind to deal with different situations... To have someone with the experience of almost 400 ODIs in the middle-order is terrific... Personally, I would like him at No.4 and, today, weve got a more dimensional batsman if we need him back at the top... 

 Blooding youngsters was part of the development programme and they havent been failures... If you want to win, youve to keep developing players... Its a process... Nobody comes in and takes the world by storm.. Please remember that the need to develop players never stops... A cricket team is never complete, its a work in progress. 

AFTER LOSING TO SRI LANKA 

 I dont think India have won a tournament overseas since 1985. There is a bit of history to it. There are obviously some reasons. I am not prepared to go into them at this stage. 

 I dont think I am shirking responsibility. I am not employed by you people, I am employed by the BCCI. Obviously, I will face up to them and give them a report. 

IN HIS RESIGNATION E-MAILED TO THE BCCI 

 I look forward to continuing my contact with India in the coming years and I wish Indian cricket and all those involved with it much joy and success in the future.

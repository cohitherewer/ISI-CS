 Shirov outwits Sasikiran

Yalta: Krishnan Sasikiran slipped to the bottom of the standings after losing to Alexey Shirov in the seventh round of the Aerosvit International Grandmasters meet here. 

On the top board, local hero Sergey Karjakin notched up a fine tactical victory over Dutch Loek van Wely and continued to lead the field with five points. 

Karjakins compatriot Vassily Ivanchuk scored over Pavel Eljanov to remain within striking distance of the leader. Shirov (3) was in third spot. 

Sasikiran engaged Shirov in a theoretical battle in the queens Indian defence, but he made a blunder on the 36th move and found himself in an hopeless endgame. Sasikiran fought on for another 15 moves but the outcome was never in doubt. (PTI)

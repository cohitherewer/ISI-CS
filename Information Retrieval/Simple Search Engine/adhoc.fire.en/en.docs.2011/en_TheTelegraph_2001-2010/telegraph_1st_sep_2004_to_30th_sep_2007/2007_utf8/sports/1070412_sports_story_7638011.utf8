 Bob inquest 

in two weeks

JACQUI GODDARD 

An inquest into the death of the Pakistan cricket coach Bob Woolmer is to be opened in two weeks, Jamaican officials announced on Tuesday. Patrick Murphy, the coroner, will hold a hearing in Kingston on April 23, complete with live testimony from as many as a dozen witnesses. It will be the first time that a detailed account of what is known of Woolmers final hours and the discovery of his body will be made public. 

[Meanwhile, Jamaican police have trashed outgoing Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haqs allegation that security lapse resulted in coach Bob Woolmers murder on March 18, a PTI report adds from Kingston.] 

He (Inzamam) is not a security specialist. The ICC has endorsed our security arrangements before and after (the murder of Woolmer), assistant commissioner of police Owen Ellington said. Inzamam recently alleged in an interview that security was not up to the mark in the West Indies and went on to say that had it been in another place, the World Cup would have been suspended after the murder.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tiwary ruled out, to consult Dr Joshi in Mumbai

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Manoj Tiwary 

Dhaka: Instead of heading for the impressive Sher-e-Bangla Stadium in the Mirpur area, on Thursday, Manoj Tiwary will be driving to the upgraded Zia International Airport. 

Tiwary has to be examined by Dr (Anant) Joshi and, so, has to quickly reach Mumbai... He will leave tomorrow morning, Board

 secretary Niranjan Shah told The Telegraph on Wednesday evening. 

Despite the acute disappointment, the 21-year-old Calcuttan has accepted that his right shoulder was destined to get injured. 

Shayad yeh hona hi tha... My family (parents Shyam Sundar-Bina, brothers Raj and Mahesh) is very worried, but Ive asked them to stay calm... After all, jo hona tha woh ho gaya, Tiwary said during a brief one-on-one at the Sheraton. 

He wasnt clear about the extent of damage, though. Nor, for that matter, administrative manager Surendra Bhave. I understand its a bad sprain, he commented hesitatingly. 

According to Shah, a replacement is only going to be sent if the team management makes a request through chief selector Dilip Vengsar- kar. 

Vengsarkar and his colleague from North, Bhupinder Singh (Sr), are expected to land here late tonight.

 India vs Bermuda: The highlights 

 Virender

 Sehwags 114 was his 8th ODI century, but his first in the WC. His previous

 highest in the WC was 82 he made in the 2003 WC final against Australia in

 Johannesburg. 

 Incidentally, Sehwags last ODI century before this one came almost two years ago against Pakistan in Kochi on April 2, 2005 after a gap of 58 innings. 

 Sehwag, meanwhile, recorded the second fastest hundred (in 81 balls) in the WC. Canadian John Davisons 67-ball hundred against the West Indians in Centurion in 2003 remains the fastest. The previous fastest hundred by an Indian in the WC is the 84-ball one by Sachin Tendulkar, against Kenya in Bristol in 1999. 

 Tendulkars 26-balll fifty was the fastest by an Indian in the WC obliterating the 32 ball fifty by Sandeep Patil during his unbeaten knock of 51 against England in the 1983 semi-final in Manchester. 

 Sourav Gangulys two sixes takes his career tally of WC sixes to 25, which equals Ricky Pontings record of most sixes in the WC. 

 Indias total of 413/5 was the fifth highest made in ODI cricket. However, it was the highest by any team in the WC surpassing the 398/5 by Sri Lanka against Kenya in Kandy in 1996. 

 It was also Indias highest ever total in ODIs obliterating the 376/2 they made against New Zealand in Hyderabad in November 1999 and the 373/6 they made against the Lankans in Taunton in the 1999 WC. 

 The 18 sixes in Indias innings equals the ODI record set by South Africa against The Netherlands last week. 

 The five ducks in Bermuda innings equals the dubious WC record for the most by any team in a match. It also provided the fourth such instance in the WC. 

 Indias 257 run win was the biggest ever recorded by any team in an ODI match, just eclipsing Australias record 256 run victory over Namibia in Potchefstroom in 2003.

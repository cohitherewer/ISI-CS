The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Jhulan is the best

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: India pace bowler Jhulan Goswami was on Monday night adjudged the ICC Womens Cricketer of the Year, according to a media release. What made her honour special was the fact that Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the Team India captain for the ICC World Twenty20, presented her the award. 

Its a dream come true for me, said Jhulan. I am very excited to win this award. It is very unexpected because the other candidates are great players. It is very special for me. 

There was no nomination from India in the mens categories so it is even more special to do this for my country and make up for that disappointment. It was a wonderful pleasure to receive this award from India captain Dhoni as he is such a good player. 

This award does a lot for womens cricket. I think womens cricket is growing We are getting more and more coverage now in the media and that can only be a good thing for game as it encourages more girls to take up the game and improves the overall levels of performance. 

The 24-year-old from Bengal has had a remarkable year, averaging 12.40 in Test matches and 21.80 in ODIs. Her accuracy with the ball is illustrated by her economy rate of 2.10 in Tests and 3.17 in ODIs. 

Jhulan pipped Lisa Sthalekar of Australia and Englands Claire Taylor to the honour.

Pebble Beach: The putting touch seemed to be coming back slowly as Arjun Atwal rounded off the AT amp; T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am golf with a one-under 71 and finished tied 36th in his first appearance on the US PGA Tour this year. 

The Indian, who was Asia No. 1 in 2003, aggregated four-under 284 in his first tournament of the season after recovering from a back injury. 

Daniel Chopra shot a two-under 70 for a total of nine-under 279 and ended up tied 11th, one down from his overnight 10th. Chopra had three birdies and one bogey in his steady round. 

American Phil Mickelson won his first tournament of the year on 268. 

Atwal picked up his first cheque of the year with $ 25,354 and Chopra picked up $ 116,600 for his 11th place and is now 50th on the US money list for 2007. 

Atwal posted three birdies against two bogeys in his last round to add to earlier efforts of 67, 75 and 71. 

He started on the 10th with a bogey on 12th and birdie on 17th but a birdie on first put him back, before birdies on fourth and sixth ensured a decent finish. He needed 29 putts. 

The most crucial confidence building feature of the tournament was that Atwals average 26.5 was the best in the field for putts per round this week. 

American Ted Purdy, a former member on the Asian Tour, enjoyed a joint ninth finish after a strong 67 on the last day. He had earlier carded scores of 73, 68, 68 for a 278 total. 

Mickelson closed with a 6-under 66 to tie the 72-hole tournament scoring record set by Mark Meara in 1997. It was his 30th career win and also passed the $40 million in earnings. 

Kevin Sutherland missed a half-dozen putts inside eight feet, but his birdie on the 18th hole gave him a 71 and second place alone. 

Sutherland fell out of contention by missing consecutive birdie putts inside eight feet on the seventh and eighth holes, then hitting a 9-iron over the green at No. 9 and taking double bogey. 

John Mallinger, a 27-year-old rookie, shot 71 to finish third.

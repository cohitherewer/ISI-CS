Calcutta: Man of the Match Lalkamal Bhowmick brought Mohun Bagan back to winning ways in the ONGC Cup National Football League, having scored the only goal of their Round X match against HASC at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. 

Mohun Bagan being lucky enough to get the winner in the 15th minute didnt do much noteworthy thereafter. But the victory temporarily lifted the team out of the pits and will surely give coach Chima Okerie a good sleep at last. 

A sense of initial urgency led to Mohun Bagans goal. Mehtab Hussain sent a through, but Bhaichung Bhutias dummy-run foxed the HASC defenders and allowed Bijoy Basfore to receive the ball and square it to the advancing Lalkamal. The latter took a 30-yard right footer which bulged the net. 

Mohun Bagan now took their tally to 12 points after 10 matches. HASC, with 6 points, remained very much in the relegation zone. 

TEAMS 

Mohun Bagan: Sangram Mukherjee, Sanjeev Maria, Deepak Mondal, Mehrajuddin Wadao (Chinmoy Sarkar 68), Douglas da Silva, Suman Dutta (Manas Das 46), Lalkamal Bhowmick, Mehtab Hussain (Surajit Bose 30), Bijoy Basfore, Bhaichung Bhutia, PC Lalawmpuia.

Referee: MK Roy (Assam). 

Man-of-the-Match: Lalkamal Bhowmick.

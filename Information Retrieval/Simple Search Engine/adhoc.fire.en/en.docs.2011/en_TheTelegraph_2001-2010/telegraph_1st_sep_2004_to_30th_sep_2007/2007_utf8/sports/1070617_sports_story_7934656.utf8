 Gag order on Shields

Kingston: Jamaican police deputy commissioner Mark Shields, who led the probe into the death of former Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer, has been gagged. 

The order to this effect was passed by police commissioner Lucius Thomas to prevent further speculation on the work of the coroner. 

A Jamaican daily quoted a source which claimed that Shields was summoned to the commissioners office and ordered to keep his mouth shut. 

Henceforth, director of communications of Jamaica police, Karl Angell, will communicate with the press.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tarundeep calls for a permanent coach

A STAFF REPORTER

 Lim Chae-Woongs contract has expired 

Calcutta: The situation is strikingly similar here. 

With a slew of international events in the offing, if the Indian cricket team is left without a foreign coach, our archery team is no different. The archers, with a temporary arrangement in place, are bracing themselves for the 44th World Archery Championship to be held in Leipzig, Germany (July 7-15). 

Since South Koreas Lim Chae-Woongs contract with the Sports Authority of India (SAI) expired last April, no effort has been made to get a new coach or renew his contract. Another Korean, Mun Baek Woon, has been given the interim charge. Under him, India had participated in the Doha Asian Games and the world championships. 

With less than a month to go for the world meet, the archers appear baffled. 

Its always good to have a permanent coach. Without that it is difficult to give your best. In a short-term arrangement, communication becomes a major problem. By the time we establish a rapport, a new face comes into the picture, Indias No.1 archer Tarundeep Rai, who represented India at the Athens Olympics in 2004, told The Telegraph. 

Lim, by the way, is in charge of the Tata Archery Academy. Ask Lim, who incidentally coached the team in last edition of the world meet in Madrid (2005), about this years performance and he says itll be tough. 

Till now we dont have a coach its tough to predict about the performance, he says. Ask him whether hes hopeful of getting back the post and he gives a mono-syllabic no comments. But adds: Im happy coaching TAA. 

Incidentally under Lims tutelage, Indian mens team made history, bagging the silver medal in the world championship in Madrid (2005). The womens team finished fourth. 

India No. 2 Rahul Banerjee and former world no.1 Jayanta Talukdar, by the way, are TAA products. Tarundeep, on the other hand, is from the Pune-based Army Sports Institute (ASI) Armys centre for Mission Olympics programme. 

The Archery Association of India (AAI) however does not believe in permanent coach theory. 

We dont need a John Wright or a Greg Chappell There has never been a permanent coach for the Indian archers. 

We depute coaches according to the composition of the team Even it can be all the three Koreans (Lim, Chae Hong Gi and Mun) working together, senior vice-president of AAI Paresh Nath Mukherjee explained.

Maracaibo: Brazil coach Dunga said his team had rescued the self-esteem of their supporters by winning the Copa America. 

He also warned that Ronaldinho and Kaka, who asked to be rested from the tournament, would have to fight to get their places back in the team. 

Dunga took over with Brazil at a low ebb after their lacklustre performances at the World Cup last year, when they lost to France in the quarter finals. 

After only 11 months in charge, he won his first title on Sunday when his team beat arch-rivals and favourites Argentina 3-0 in the Copa America final. 

We came here to restore the self-esteem of the Brazilian supporter, the worker leaves home early in the morning and comes back at late night and whose only satisfaction is when Brazil wins, said Dunga. 

He then paid tribute to his players, who he said had come from adversity to triumph. 

They are winners, they come from families who financially are not so well off, nobody has given them anything, theyve worked hard for this and so they deserve it, he said. 

My players demonstrated theyre capable of great things, Dunga said. Argentina were the press and everyones favourites, but the game is decided on the field over 90 minutes. 

Of future team selections, he said: Obviously, the player who comes is ahead of the player who doesnt. Players are picked on merit and their capabilities. 

If a player comes and he does well, how can I take him out of the team? 

Although he was criticised in the earlier stages of the tournament, especially after a 0-2 defeat to Mexico, Dunga said he had nothing to say to his detractors. 

If my team wins, then I have nothing to explain, he said. 

Brazilian striker Robinho, who finished as the tournaments top socrer with six goals and also bagged the player of the series award, shot back at the critics. 

Lots of people criticised our team, but were the champions, he said. 

Argentina coach Alfio Basile refused to talk to reporters. 

It was the 10th meeting between the heavyweights of South America in the final, with Brazil winning for the just the second time. 

Losing like this makes you angry, but theres nothing more we can do but wait for another final, Argentinas Lionel Messi said. 

Others were even more sombre. 

Were totally ruined, Esteban Cambiasso said. Losing like this penetrates your soul. 

Dunga has already experienced the trials of coaching the five-times world champions. 

Initially, he made more of an impression for wearing garish shirts designed by his daughter who is a fashion student on the touchline as Brazil played a series of friendlies. 

He insisted that his team was not defensive, a point which appeared to be proved as they drew 2-2 with Uruguay before winning on penalties and beat Argentina 3-0. 

In each of our games, we have created six or seven clear scoring chances, he said after Sundays win. 

Their style, however, is far from the artistry for which Brazil were once known. 

Instead, Brazil have powered their way through the Copa America, combining physical strength and Germanic efficiency in attack. 

They are not ashamed to use strong-arm tactics either and on Sunday committed 37 fouls on their way to demolishing Argentina. (Agencies)

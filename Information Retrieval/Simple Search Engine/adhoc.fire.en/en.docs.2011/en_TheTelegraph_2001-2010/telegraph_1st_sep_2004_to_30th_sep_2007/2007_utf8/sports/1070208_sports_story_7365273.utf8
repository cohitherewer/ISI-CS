The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India grapple with injury scare

 - Yuvraj, Agarkar, Pathan doubtful; No problems for Lanka 

TAPAN MOHANTA

Calcutta: The weather for Thursdays one-dayer at the Eden is unpredictable. Wednesday was gloomy and muggy. The evening drizzle stretched late into the night. 

If that was on a broader perspective, at a much narrower level, the weather at the Team India camp reflected the turmoil outside. There were shadows of the Greg Chappell-Virender Sehwag alleged spat incident lingering as the Indian team practised on Wednesday morning. 

Further, faced with a sudden injury scare, the team think-tank was still unsure of the XII against Sri Lanka in the first ODI of the Hero Honda Cup four-match series, which would be the last opportunity for both teams to do their homework ahead of the quadrennial showpiece in the Caribbean. 

There were doubts over the availability of Yuvraj Singh (who is having a sore back), Ajit Agarkar (down with flu) and Irfan Pathan (nursing a sore shoulder). 

Im not in a position to reveal the XII as there are some fitness concerns (with Yuvraj, Agarkar and Pathan). Well assess them in the morning before deciding on the team composition, Team India captain Rahul Dravid said. 

An aberration surely for the skipper, who until now, had been reading out the roster on the match eve itself. 

Ive been doing this for more than 12 months Even while I was in the West Indies I declared the XII on match eve, is what Dravid had said before the recently-held (January 24) ODI in Cuttack. 

But that was during the West Indies series. Now, however, theres an element of unpredictability. 

As a matter of fact, Agarkar didnt turn up for morning practice, staying back at the hotel. Yuvraj and Irfan turned up, but they didnt have a go at the nets. That means their availability on Thursday is quite unlikely. 

Having played two ODIs so far after coming back from the injury-enforced hiatus, Yuvraj, however, had padded up during practice on Tuesday afternoon. 

If Yuvraj is forced to sit out, Dinesh Karthik may make the cut. As for the bowling department, the nature of the track demands spin towards the second-half, so an Anil Kumble-Harbhajan Singh combination cannot be ruled out. 

Sachin Tendulkar, who rolled his arm over at the nets for an extended session, will once again fill in the fifth-bowler slot. Sourav Ganguly also had some bowling practice, giving the team another option. Sehwag, with his off-spin, would be quite handy too. 

For Team India, what seems to be clear at the moment is the opening slot, which Dravid did not hesitate to announce. 

Sourav-Uthappa will open the innings. Sehwag? Well decide about that tomorrow. The team think-tank, perhaps, would mull on the Delhi dashers position according to the match situation. 

In the pace department, Munaf Patel seems to have the upper hand over Sreesanth to share the new ball with Zaheer. 

Having impressed in the Vadodara nets, Munaf got the nod from Dravid, who said: It will be good to see how he bowls in the match 

All eyes, however, will be on Sehwag. Notwithstanding the alleged feud, Sehwag and Chappell showed perfect camaraderie as the coach was seen joking with him. Dravid also joined in, saying theres no problem with the team. 

The pitch appears to be a typical Eden one a batting strip. Help for the spinners towards the second innings may just make toss a crucial factor. And, of course, the dew. 

Meanwhile, there was some cheer in the local camp as flamboyant Bengal batsman Manoj Tewari has been included in the squad for fielding. He will be the 12th man. 

As if taking a cue from the hosts, Mahela Jayawardene amp; Co., (sans stalwarts Muttiah Muralidharan and Chaminda Vaas), too, refused to reveal their composition. 

If Indians think that this is the same side that was routed 1-6 in their tour of India during October-November 2005, then they would be mistaken, is all what Jayawardene said. 

He may have been referring to their history against India at the Eden, which the in-form Sanath Jayasuriya (wrecker-in-chief in Indias World Cup semi-final loss in 1996) would like to repeat. 

The past, if not the present, may be a worrying factor for Team India. They are yet to win a match at the Eden since January 19, 2002, having lost three matches on a trot since then.

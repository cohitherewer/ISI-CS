 Negi loses

Malmo: Worlds youngest GM Parimarjan Negi fought hard before going down to Emanuel Berg of Sweden in Round VI of Sigeman amp; Co International chess tournament. 

Berg played white with a Sicilian Najdorf opening. The middle game was typically wild after Berg sacrificed a piece and Negi employed a manoeuvre to get a decent position. 

When it looked things were moving fine for the Indian, Bergs bid for complications succeeded as Negi missed a move that resulted in losing his queen. Soon after, there was no respite for the Indian as he suffered his third straight loss to the Swede. 

In January, he was outwitted by Berg in the Corus tournament and a month later, was outplayed at the Aeroflot tournament in Moscow. (PTI)

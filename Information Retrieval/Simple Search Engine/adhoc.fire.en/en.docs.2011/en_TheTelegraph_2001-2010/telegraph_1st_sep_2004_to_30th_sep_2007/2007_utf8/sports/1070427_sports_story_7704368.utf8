 Smith defends batsmens attacking approach

Gros Islet: Graeme Smith defended South African batsmens ill-fated aggression in the seven-wicket World Cup semi-final defeat that saw its top-order perish for a paltry score against an accurate Australian attack. 

After Smith opted to bat first in Wednesdays semi-final, South Africa conceded the advantage to defending champions Australia when they crumbled to 27 for five. 

The batsmen were punished for trying to play aggressive strokes before getting their eye in just what Australian skipper Ricky Ponting had prepared his bowlers for. 

South Africa were bundled out for 149 and Australia sprinted to a seven-wicket victory with more than 18 overs to spare. Australia will play Sri Lanka in Saturdays final in Bridgetown. 

Weve been quite aggressive throughout and we felt that we could be quite aggressive upfront, Smith said. 

Ahead of the semi-final, Smith said that South Africa wanted to call the shots and not let Australia dictate terms as in the preliminary round match when they beat the Proteas by 83 runs. 

The ball did swing in the beginning and once youre three down, it really became very difficult to wrest back the initiative, said Smith, whose dismissal on the 15th delivery of the game started the South African slide. 

Coach Mickey Arthur also said the aggressive shots that contributed to South Africas defeat were a calculated risk. 

I dont think we played reckless shots and threw the wickets away, said Arthur. We had a plan, we wanted to destroy Australias momentum somehow and we needed to get on top quickly. It was part of the plan, but it never came off. 

Smith said the top-orders dismissal had to do with some good bowling and some bad shots. Life becomes a bit difficult when a strike bowler like Shaun Tait comes in as the first-change bowler, he said. 

Young pacer Tait (four for 29) and seasoned spearhead Glenn McGrath (three for 18) capitalised on South Africas mistakes to do the maximum damage, leaving Smith to acknowledge that South Africas performance was below par. 

We let ourselves down, that was disappointing, the South African captain said. You dont mind losing when you know that you have played to your potential and performing what you are capable of. 

The top order has done pretty well. It has been a tournament of ups and downs for us. At times we have not played our best cricket but the boys have given their 100 per cent, Smith said. 

Smith conceded Australia were the better team on the park. 

Full credit to the new ball bowlers. We were up against the wall after being bowled out for 150, it was always going to be tough to defend that target, he said.

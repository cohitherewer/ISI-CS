Port of Spain: After achieving what former champions India and Pakistan failed to do, Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar said his team can come up with an even better show in the Super Eight. 

This is the first time that Bangladesh have reached the second stage of the World Cup and Bashar said he was enjoying every moment of it. 

We played good cricket to qualify and can play even better in the second round, said Bashar, after Bangladeshs seven-wicket victory over Bermuda in the final group tie at the Queens Park Oval on Sunday. 

This is a memorable moment for Bangladesh. Cricket is a huge game back home and we are delighted to have achieved this milestone. It did not come as a surprise to us to be in the Super Eight. Weve worked hard and played as a team, he said. 

Coach Dav Whatmore said Bangladesh always had the potential, but needed some luck too. This is a very significant achievement by this young side. But we have a long way to go, he said. 

Meanwhile, Bermuda captain Irvine Romaine cursed the inclement weather. 

The weather really did us in. We were constantly going out and coming in. But we also messed it up, he said. 

Man of the Match Mohammed Ashraful said he adhered to the basics when he walked in at 37 for three. 

Meanwhile, Bermuda batsman Oliver Pitcher was taken to hospital after banging his head on the field during their World Cup Group B defeat by Bangladesh on Sunday. 

Pitcher suffered a concussion but it was not anything serious, Bermuda Cricket Board chief executive Neil Speight told reporters

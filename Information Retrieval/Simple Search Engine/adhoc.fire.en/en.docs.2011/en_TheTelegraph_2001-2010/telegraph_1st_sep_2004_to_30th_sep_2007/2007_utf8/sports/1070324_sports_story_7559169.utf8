 Our players are not suspects: Ashraf

 Dr Nasim Ashraf 

Karachi: Dr Nasim Ashraf, the outgoing chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), has said that no Pakistani player is a suspect in the murder of coach Bob Woolmer. 

Police in Jamaica said that Woolmer, 58, was strangled. He was found unconscious in his hotel room on Sunday and later pronounced dead in hospital, a day after the teams surprise loss to Ireland in the World Cup. 

Dr Nasim Ashraf, who tendered his resignation soon after the humiliating defeat, said on Friday that the players were not facing any restrictions on their movements and would return home soon. 

The Bob Woolmer case is under investigation, but I want to make it clear that there is no suspicion on the Pakistani team, Dr Ashraf said in Peshawar. 

That is the reason that the team left Kingston on Thursday night. And now the team is in Montego Bay, he said. 

Our players are under severe stress and trauma and they will rest until Saturday, and then they will come back to Pakistan. 

Ashraf said Jamaican police have interviewed all those who had contact with Woolmer, including West Indies captain Brian Lara and manager Clive Lloyd, as the Pakistani and West Indies sides were at the same hotel at the time of his death. 

Woolmers death is a big tragedy for us and a terrible loss and the players are very upset. They are not suspects, he said. 

Ashraf has submitted his resignation to the chief patron of the board, Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf, accepting responsibility for the dismal World Cup performance of the team. 

Former Pakistan captain Rameez Raja, who as chief executive of the PCB had hired Woolmer as coach in 2004, said the ex-England player was brought in especially to sort out the politics in the team. 

Woolmer did manage to unite the team. In future we are now going to find it difficult to get a foreign coach and will have to appoint one of our former players, he told a TV channel.

 Sasi stays in sole lead

Sofia: On a day of drab draws, Krishnan Sasikiran shared the honours with Romanian Grandmaster Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu. The Indian thus maintained a wafer-thin half point lead after the penultimate round of the third Mtel Masters International chess tournament here. 

A win in the ninth round would have given Sasikiran a crucial one-point cushion before the final round, but he failed to cash in on the opportunities that came his way. 

The Mamedyarov-Adams and Topalov-Kamsky matches also ended in tame draws. 

With just a round left in the six-player double round robin event, Sasikiran (5) is followed by a pack of four former world champion Veselin Topalov (Bulgaria), Gata Kamsky (US), Nisipeanu and Shakhriyar Mamedyarov (Azerbaijan) on 4.5 points each. Michael Adams of England is now in the cellar with four points. 

In the decisive round, Sasikiran (playing black) faces Topalov and Mamedyarov takes on Nisipeanu. Kamsky, though, has white against Adams. 

Sasikiran is the second Indian after Viswanathan Anand to get an invite to a category-20 event. 

After losing to Kamsky in the previous round, Sasikiran was desperate for a win, but Nisipeanu fought hard from an inferior position. 

Playing the white side of a Sicilian Accelerated Dragon, Sasikiran came up with a thematic central breakthrough and had the Romanian in his clutches. Nisipeanu had to launch a grim defence and was aided by a couple of mistakes from the Indian. Peace was signed after 42 moves. 

Topalov also drew a blank against Kamsky who went for the Queen Pawn opening. 

 Topalov even won a pawn after regular exchanges but Kamsky eventually achieved a draw with perpetual checks. 

Adams regained composure with black pieces and played out a fine game to hold Mamedyarov. 

The Queens Indian Defence by the Englishman saw the queen getting off the board in quick time and in the resulting endgame, Mamedyarov decided against taking risks and repeated the moves.

 Pitch problem hits SA-Pak warm-up tie 

Port of Spain: The World Cup warm-up match between South Africa and Pakistan was in jeopardy Friday because of an uneven pitch. 

South Africa was clearly unhappy with the pitch and players complained to umpires Peter Parker and Ian Gould shortly after Fridays drinks break, with South Africa at 56 for three. 

South Africa coach Mickey Arthur and his Pakistan counterpart Bob Woolmer and captains of both teams had a discussion for around seven minutes with the umpires in the middle of the Sir Frank Worrell ground. 

Play resumed and was interrupted briefly again when ICC official Dhiraj Malhotra went on to the field to speak to the umpires, who continued the match. 

However, Malhotra said the situation could change. 

It could be (called off) if it gets dangerous, Malhotra said. The South African batsmen felt the ball was going on an uneven bounce. Some balls are flying off and thats whats worrying them. Both coaches are in agreement that its slightly worrisome. 

South Africa team spokesman Gordon Templeton said captain Graeme Smith and Arthur didnt feel the pitch was fit to play on. 

Pakistan won the toss and sent South Africa in to bat. Pakistan included allrounder Yasir Arafat and fast bowler Mohammed Sami in its expanded squad for the match, in which 13 players can be used but only 11 can bat.

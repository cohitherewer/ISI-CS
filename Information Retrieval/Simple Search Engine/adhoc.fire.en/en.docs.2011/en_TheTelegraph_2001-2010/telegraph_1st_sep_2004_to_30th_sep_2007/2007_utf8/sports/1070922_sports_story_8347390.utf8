 Watson not to tour India

Johannesburg: Allrounder Shane Watson will be replaced in the Australian squad to tour India later this month after being withdrawn on Friday with a hamstring injury. 

Watson, who missed the early stages of the World Twenty20 in South Africa with the problem, has a low grade muscular strain according to physiotherapist Alex Kountouris. 

The decision has been made for Shane to return to Australia and prepare himself for the upcoming Australian season, Kountouris said in a statement. No decision has yet been made on who will replace Watson. 

Meanwhile, in Sydney, Cricket Australia (CA) said in a statement that captain Ricky Ponting will remain with the squad for their one-day tour of India despite suffering from a hamstring injury. (Reuters)

 Becks no-show 

Madrid: David Beckham will not join his Real Madrid teammates to play an exhibition game against a combined Israeli and Palestinian side because of a dispute with the club, match organisers said on Friday. 

The Shimon Peres Centre for Peace, which has organised a number high-profile sports events to promote peaceful relations in the region, said in a statement that Beckham would not make the trip to Israel because of differences with the management. 

The statement added that the rest of the team would come as planned for the game which will take place two days after the end of the Spanish season on June 19. (Reuters)

 People I had faith in stabbed me

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Nayeemuddin 

New Delhi: Bangladesh coach Syed Nayeemuddin on Sunday said that he was absolutely saddened by the way he was dismissed as Indias national coach last season after poor performance in the World Cup qualifiers. 

I was a victim of circumstances, the Dronacharya coach said with a tinge of sadness in his voice. The people I had faith in stabbed me on the back. When I realised, there was no going back. 

Nayeemuddin said he was unable to understand why the players went against him after coming back as champions from SAFF football in Pakistan. I did everything for the players, fought for their rights. Yet they were against me. 

Talking on his widely publicised rift with Bhaichung Bhutia, the Arjuna awardee said he was all for the star striker in the Indian team. I was the one who called him as Indias answer to Roberto Baggio and Nakata. Whenever I was the coach, I tried to project him in good light. 

Here sitting at the hotel lobby I see the Indian players loitering around. Many do not even come and greet me and say hello. Do I deserve such treatment after doing so much for them?. 

Nayeem was of the opinion that then technical director of the team PK Banerjee also contributed to his downfall. I had so much faith in him. So I expected greater co-operation from him.

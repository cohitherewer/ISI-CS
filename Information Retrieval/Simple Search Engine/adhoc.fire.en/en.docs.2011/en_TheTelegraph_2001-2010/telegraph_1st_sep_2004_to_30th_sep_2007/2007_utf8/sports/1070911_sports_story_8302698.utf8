 No central contract for Matt Prior

London: England have named a 15-man squad for next months one-day series in Sri Lanka, staying loyal to the players who sealed a 4-3 series win over India. 

The only new face in the party named on Monday was Nottinghamshire off-spinner Graeme Swann, who replaces fast bowler Chris Tremlett. 

Sussex allrounder Luke Wright was rewarded for a half-century on his debut against India last week with a spot in the squad. The ECB also revealed its central contracts for 2008 on Monday.

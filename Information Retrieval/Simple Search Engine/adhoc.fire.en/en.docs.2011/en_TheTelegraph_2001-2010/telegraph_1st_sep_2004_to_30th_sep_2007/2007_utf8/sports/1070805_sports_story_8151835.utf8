 No new hands in United-Chelsea tie

 Tim Rich

Should you be lucky enough to go to the posher kind of restaurant Portal in the City of London is Jose Mourinhos favourite you will be offered something called an amuse-bouche. Perhaps a slither of monkfish to titillate the palate, but which will have slipped from the mind by the time you drain the cognac to stiffen the nerve as the bill arrives. 

That, in essence, is what the Community or Charity Shield has always been. When Manchester United face Chelsea at the new Wembley for the second time in less than three months, they will be told it is a chance to exact a measure of revenge for the defeat in the FA Cup final. 

Nothing that will happen on Sunday will erase Didier Drogbas wonderful touch that salvaged a dreadful, over-hyped match and ensured Mourinho could make the hollow boast that Sir Alex Ferguson should be asked why Manchester United had taken only one trophy, whereas Chelsea had two. Whatever the result, it will be long forgotten by the time the season reaches its sticky toffee pudding phase in March and April. 

It is rare that a Shield victory proves very much. 

Uniteds 4-0 demolition of Newcastle in the summer of 1996 suggested Alan Shearer might have erred in preferring St James Park to Old Trafford, while Liverpools victory last year maintained the pattern of Rafael Benitezs dominance over Chelsea in one-off games. 

Often the signals are all wrong. The way that Andrei Shevchenko equalised appeared wrongly as it turned out to argue that the Ukrainian would have an deep impact on the season to come. This time few of either clubs summer signings will be involved. 

Alex has just received his work permit for Stamford Bridge; Anderson and Owen Hargreaves lack the required match fitness, while Carlos Tevez is settling accounts with his lawyers before journeying to Old Trafford. 

Obviously, in our situation, with the likes of Anderson, Neville, Hargreaves, Saha and Solskjaer a bit short of games, they will not be involved, said Ferguson. 

Ferguson does, however, expect a better contest than Uniteds last meeting with Chelsea, although this would hardly stretch either team. It will probably be more competitive than the FA Cup final, he said. Because in that game there was a tiredness in both teams and I couldnt get any more out of some of my players. 

Frank Lampard, meanwhile, has been declared fit to play despite reports that he is suffering from a broken toe. He injured his toe during the clubs pre-season tour of America but is suffering only mild discomfort and will be available to play on Sunday.

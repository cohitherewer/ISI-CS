 No penalty for McLaren

 - Insufficient evidence against leaders 

 Lewis Hamiltons title aspirations are on track 

Paris: Formula One leaders McLaren escaped immediate sanction on Thursday after a hearing into a spying controversy found insufficient evidence that they had benefited from leaked Ferrari data. 

However the International Automobile Federation (FIA) said in a statement that the Mercedes-powered team were not exonerated and could still be kicked out if fresh proof emerged. 

The FIA said after an extraordinary meeting of its World Motor Sport Council that there was no doubt McLaren, who have British rookie Lewis Hamilton leading the championship two points clear of team mate Fernando Alonso, had broken the rules. 

However there is insufficient evidence that this information was used in such a way as to interfere improperly with the FIA Formula One World Championship, it added. We therefore impose no penalty. 

However with legal action pending, McLaren were not yet in the clear. 

If it is found in the future that the Ferrari information has been used to the detriment of the championship, we reserve the right to invite... McLaren back in front of the WMSC where it will face the possibility of exclusion from not only the 2007 championship but also the 2008 championship, the FIA said.

 What makes Roger tick

 Judy Murray 

Roger Federer is chasing his fifth consecutive Wimbledon crown. Here are five reasons why the Swiss is the big cheese: 

1. serve: Federers serve might not be the most powerful in the game, but he is still able to rack up the aces and it is one of the most accurate and most consistent deliveries on the ATP Tour. It is also wonderfully disguised and sets him up well for his second shot. He has the ability to serve-and-volley, too, which is something he has been doing a lot more this year and which is such an effective tactic on the lawns of the All England Club. His first-serve percentage has been relatively low lately and that is something he will want to improve next fortnight. 

 2. versatility: 

 Federer has such a wonderful repertoire of shots and a complete 

 mastery of the ball that allows him to construct points 

 better than anybody else. He can vary the pace, depth, height, 

 spin and direction at will and can hurt opponents from every 

 part of the court. He will use his sliced backhand to keep 

 the ball low and short on the cross court (especially on 

 the return of serve from the advantage court), forcing opponents 

 to hit up and will also use it aggressively down the line 

 as an effective approach shot. Slice keeps the ball so low 

 on the grass that it can neutralise his opponents 

 attacking shots. It is the shot that usually unravels big-hitters 

 like Andy Roddick. 

 3. Athleticism: 

 Physically, Federer is in great shape and is deceptively 

 powerful. He is a natural athlete and has great speed. It 

 is not just speed off the mark and around the court, but 

 speed of reaction too. He has tremendous reflexes, allowing 

 him to adapt quickly to the biggest serves and unpredictable 

 bounces on grass. It is another of the reasons why he is 

 one of the best volleyers out there. 

 4. Ambition: 

 Federer wants to be the best in the world, to win the biggest 

 titles and to create tennis history. That is why the defeat 

 by Rafael Nadal in the final at Roland Garros will have 

 left him emotionally drained. But he is a great competitor, 

 always relishes whatever challenge is thrown at him and 

 he will be out to lift a fifth consecutive Wimbledon title. 

 He may find the opening rounds a little tricky since he 

 will have had no grasscourt match practice but, like all 

 great champions, he will find a way to win even when he 

 is not playing his best. His ability to play the big points 

 well is uncanny. 

 5. Centre Court: 

 It is like his own backyard there is no better place for 

 Federer to show his superiority. He is totally at home there 

 and has complete faith in his own ability. He is equally 

 effective on both wings on grass his slight vulnerability 

 on the high backhand is tough to expose on low-bouncing 

 turf. And with all of the weapons at his disposal and the 

 crowds behind him, the odds are that he will retain his 

 crown.

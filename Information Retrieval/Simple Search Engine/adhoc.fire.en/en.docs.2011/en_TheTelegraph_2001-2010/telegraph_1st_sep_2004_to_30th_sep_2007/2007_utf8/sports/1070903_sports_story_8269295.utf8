 Trio says no to PCB

Karachi/ Durban: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has failed in its bid to convince three of the four players, who have signed up for the Indian Cricket League (ICL) to align with the board again. 

Sources in the PCB confirmed that the chairman, Dr Nasim Ashraf had spoken to Mohammed Yousuf, Abdul Razzaq and Imran Farhat has failed to get any positive response from them. 

None of them have said they would drop their ICL contracts. They have not even said they would reconsider their positions. Farhat and Razzaq in fact outlined some of their complaints against the attitude of the board and selectors in general to the chairman, the one source said. 

Interestingly, the board chairman has not spoken to former captain, Inzamam-ul-Haq, who is in England playing for Yorkshire. 

I dont think until Inzamam is taken into confidence the other three players would respond to the board or reconsider not playing in the ICL, the source said further adding: All the three are loyal and close to Inzamam and will follow what he says. 

While Razzaq and Inzamam are in England, Yousuf is on a religious tour in the northern part of Pakistan. Only Farhat has been available in person. 

I dont understand this fuss over the ICL. It is just a private league and there is nothing wrong with it. Why cant we play for it and our country as well? Why do we have to face any conditions? said Inzamam from England. We are committing no crime and doing nothing wrong. Where does the question of patriotism creep up from? When the board is not selecting us for national duty why cant we go and play in the ICL and earn some good money? What is wrong if there is more cricket? he added. 

Other sources said the board found itself in an awkward position because the ICL was not even officially banned by the Indian board. 

Meanwhile, South African Andrew Hall is set to join the ICL after snapping ties with the national side following his omission from the ICC World Twenty 20 squad. It is understood that the 32-year-old all-rounder will join Nicky Boje and Lance Klusener, who were recently named to join the rebel outfit. Hall has submitted a letter to cricket South Africa on Friday. (PTI)

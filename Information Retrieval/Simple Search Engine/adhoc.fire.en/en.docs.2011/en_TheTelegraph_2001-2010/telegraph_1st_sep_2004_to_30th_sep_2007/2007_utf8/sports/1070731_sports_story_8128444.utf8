The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 British media vents ire on Taufel

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar, who became the victim of a dubious umpiring decision when on 91 on Day III of the second Test at Trent Bridge on Sunday, got sympathy and praise from the British media on Monday. All the newspapers lauded the maestro for his masterful innings and rued Simon Taufels decision to adjudge him leg-before. 

[Taufel later told TV commentators David Lloyd and David Gower that he was very upset to have handed a poor decision to Sachin. The Aussie umpire, however, backed the Sourav Ganguly decision, saying that he would give that out every time.] 

The following are excerpts from the newspapers (in alphabetical order): 

THE DAILY EXPRESS: It was Richie Benaud who loaded the equation for a good captain at 90-10 luck over skill but England captain Michael Vaughan had reason to question his personal balance. If Benauds theorem remains true, Vaughan might rightfully argue that his 90 per cent was split rather unfavourably between good and bad Sunday. The dismissals of Tendulkar and Ganguly were exposed as firmly of the former. 

THE DAILY MIRROR: Indias middle-order put them firmly in the driving seat although they will be disappointed not to have got more than they did after two howlers from umpire Simon Taufel. Both Tendulkar and Ganguly were denied centuries by the Aussies finger. 

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH: Sachin Tendulkars expression after hed been given out lbw on 91 said a thousand words. Initially there was surprise at the decision that merged into disbelief and then to shock. Dismay became despair at the realisation of what umpire Simon Taufel had done. All that meticulous preparation and studious defence and fastidious tending of the pitch and careful accumulation, banished by one cruel finger. 

THE GUARDIAN: The leg-before decision that ended Tendulkars designs on a 38th Test hundred was held to be debatable. Tendulkar padded up to Collingwood and Taufel calculated, probably erroneously, that the ball would have hit off stump. Taufels equally dodgy decision to give out Ganguly caught down the leg-side barely merited an afterthought. Ganguly smacked a divot in irritation and ran up the pavilion steps after his dismissal; Sachin merely left, a little disappointed, and in his controlled emotions set an example that might not demand many TV playbacks, but which did him enormous credit. 

THE INDEPENDENT: If Tendulkar was not such an unassuming cricket legend, the umpire who is generally rated the best in the world might just have heard something close to the growling breath of the great W.G. Grace. This was plainly wrong. Tendulkar is usually close to a pinnacle of philosophical maturity when the umpires conspire against him, but this time he was not quite the paragon of forbearance. He lingered for five seconds, reflecting on what TV evidence would confirm in the split second that followed his decision to pad up against a ball that he knew was going to pass his off stump. How did he know? Because he is Sachin Tendulkar. Because it is a sense you acquire when, like Brian Lara, his only other rival as the greatest batsman of his age, you pass a total of 11,000 runs. 

THE TIMES: India will be very disappointed if, with fine weather apparently now assured, they cannot make their huge first-innings lead count. Two of their famous four, Tendulkar and Ganguly, missed out on individual hundreds for which they had worked assiduously on Sunday. Each of them eventually unlucky with misjudgements by the normally impeccable Taufel.

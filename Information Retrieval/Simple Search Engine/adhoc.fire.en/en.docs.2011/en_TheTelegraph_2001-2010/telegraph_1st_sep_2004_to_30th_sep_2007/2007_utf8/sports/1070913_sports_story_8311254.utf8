 Paes to skip Mumbai meet

Calcutta: The second edition of the Kingfisher Airlines Open will have a strong field with the likes of Lleyton Hewitt, Marat Safin, Marcos Baghdatis and Richard Gasquet to gun for glory at the CCI in Mumbai later this month. But one famous local will be missing from action: Leander Paes. 

Leander will be playing the ATP Bangkok meet that week (September 24 to 30) with Jamie Murray, his father Dr Vece Paes informed The Telegraph on Wednesday. 

Paess choice of Bangkok at the expense of his home tournament which is organised by Mahesh Bhupathis company Globosport wont surprise those who have been following events over the past year. 

The senior pro did play the Mumbai event last year, with Pakistani Aisam Qureshi as partner. 

This is Maheshs tournament, Im playing it to show him respect, Paes had said a year ago, adding that he would have partnered Bhupathi if the latter not already committed to Mario Ancic. 

That was a nice gesture on Paess part. But much has happened since then, none more damaging than a public row with Bhupathi in Doha during the Asian Games in December. It pushed the estranged partners the one-time world No. 1 pair further apart. 

Paess regular partner Martin Damm is taking a three-week break, which is why the Indian chose Andy Murrays elder brother to fill in at Bangkok. 

Paes and Damm will resume action a week later, at the Tokyo event, and then play the European indoor hard court season leading to the Masters Cup Doubles in Shanghai in November. 

The top eight teams will feature in the prestigious season-ending meet. Paes and Damm are currently No. 4 in the ATP Doubles Race behind Bob-Mike Bryan, Mark Knowles-Daniel Nestor and Paul Hanley-Kevin Ullyett and should make the Shanghai cut.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bengal camp to start later this month

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The pre-season conditioning camp for the Bengal cricketers is set to start in the third week of August. 

With the new CAB dispensation having taken charge a few days back, the concerned officials are keen to set things in motion as early as possible. 

We will sit with the president (Prasun Mukherjee) in a day or two. 

We hope to arrive at a decision on the issue by Tuesday, said an official on Saturday. 

According to him, the camp may begin sometime between August 16 to 20. 

Deep Dasgupta amp; Co. had already had a session with coach Bharat Arun. 

The Mukherjee-led administration also needs to find a new coach for the under-19 side since Dattatreyo Mukherjee has joined Videocon School of Cricket.

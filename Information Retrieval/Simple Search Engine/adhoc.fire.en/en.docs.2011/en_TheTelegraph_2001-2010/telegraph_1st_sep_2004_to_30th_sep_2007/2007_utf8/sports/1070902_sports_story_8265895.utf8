The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Liverpool thrash Derby 

London: Liverpool thrashed Derby County 6-0 at Anfield on Saturday to go top of the Premier League for the first time since November 2002. 

Liverpools stay might last for only 24 hours until overnight leaders Chelsea visit Aston Villa on Sunday. 

Two goals from Xabi Alonso and Fernando Torres and one apiece by Ryan Babel and substitute Andriy Voronin helped the Merseysiders crush bottom team Derby who have one point from their opening five matches and are the only team without a win. 

Everton went second with a 2-1 victory at Bolton Wanderers thanks to a last-minute winner from Joleon Lescott after Ayegbeni Yakubu scored 11 minutes into his debut. Nicolas Anelka scored for Bolton. 

Champions Manchester United, who failed to win their opening three games, won 1-0 for the second successive week to climb up the table. 

They welcomed old midfield warhorse Roy Keane back to Old Trafford for the first time as Sunderland manager and then had to work hard to beat his resilient side. 

The breakthrough came after 71 minutes when Louis Saha, on as a halftime substitute to end a six-month injury layoff, headed home from a corner taken by Nani. 

Liverpool have 10 points, the same as Everton and Chelsea with Manchester City, who play at Blackburn Rovers on Sunday, next on nine. 

Michael Owen scored in the 87th minute to give Newcastle United a 1-0 win over Wigan Athletic, who had Kevin Kilbane sent off. 

Owen dashed between two defenders to pounce three minutes from time to add to the goal he scored in mid-week his first for Newcastle after 20 injury-hit months. 

Fulham stormed back from 0-2 and 1-3 down to force a 3-3 draw with Tottenham Hotspur at Craven Cottage while Middlesbrough beat Birmingham City 2-0. 

West Ham United avenged last seasons defeat at Reading by winning 3-0 at the Madejski Stadium. The home team also missed a penalty. (Reuters)

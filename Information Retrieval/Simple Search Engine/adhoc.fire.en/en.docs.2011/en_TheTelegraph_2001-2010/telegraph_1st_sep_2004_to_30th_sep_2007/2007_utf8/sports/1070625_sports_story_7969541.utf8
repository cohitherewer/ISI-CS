 Paes-Damm second best

New Delhi: Top seeds Leander Paes and his Czech partner Martin Damm failed to clinch their second successive Ordina Open title, losing 6-3, 6-7 (5), 10-12 to third seeds Jeff Coetzee and Rogier Wassen in the final at s-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands. 

The defending champions squandered a one-set lead, while Coetzee and Wassen saved two match points in the one-hour-27-minute battle to bag their second ATP title of the season. 

The Indo-Czech pair clinched the opener with 29 winners. 

However, Coetzee and Wassen came back to pocket the second set in tie breaker after Paes and Damm failed to convert any of the three break points that came their way. The top seeds could not recover after that as Coetzee and Wassen held their nerves to seal the match and the title in the super tiebreaker. 

The Indo-Czech pair was solid with its serve combining for 20 aces and never faced a break in the match but was undone by its poor break point conversion. (PTI)

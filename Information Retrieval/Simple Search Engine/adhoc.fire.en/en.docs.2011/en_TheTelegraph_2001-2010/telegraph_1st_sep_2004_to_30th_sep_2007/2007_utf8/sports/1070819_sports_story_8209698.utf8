 Benitez closes in on rival

 Jeremy Wilson 

Keen to live up to his new Mellow Mourinho nickname, it was perhaps predictable that Chelseas manager did not talk about Rafael Benitez on Friday. 

Few rivals appear capable of heating Jose Mourinhos blood more rapidly than Benitez, a manager who has faced Chelsea often and with success in the past three years. 

The pair arrived in English football within a fortnight of each other in 2004, and Sunday will be the 16th time that they have gone head-to-head in a rivalry which is arguably the most compelling in the Premier League. 

The contrast, as well as the apparent antipathy, is obvious. Whereas Mourinho comes with the style and charisma of a Hollywood actor, Benitez has the everyday look of a fan in the stands rather than the manager of British footballs most successful club. 

Appearances, however, can be deceptive and though the early spoils in their head-to-heads were enjoyed by Mourinho most memorably with his touchline gesturing in the Carling Cup final of 2005 a subtle transfer of power can be detected. 

Mourinho still holds a 7-5 overall lead, yet significant battles have been won by Benitez, notably one FA Cup and two Champions League semi-finals. 

The questionable goatee beard is not the only sign of an emboldened Benitez this year. This was most obvious after the Champions League final against AC Milan when he suggested his future could be affected if significant transfer funds were not made available by the clubs new American owners. 

Benitez got what he wanted and has spent more than 40 million on the likes of Fernando Torres, Ryan Babel and Yossi Benayoun. 

Mourinho has been quick to comment on Liverpools spending, yet Benitezs stature at Anfield has been enhanced by his challenge to the clubs hierarchy. 

Former Liverpool striker Ian Rush said: I think there is a greater confidence about him in that he sets the pace of the club, just like Mourinho does at Chelsea. 

Mourinho is very good in the way that he looks after his players, but Benitez now has the confidence to take the games to him and I think Liverpool have just had the edge in the matches over the last few years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No. 1 Shivika looks for a sponsor now

Calcutta: City girl Shivika Burman has attained the coveted No. 1 spot among the junior tennis players of the country, but her career graph may well stop there only if the 17-year-old fails to get a sponsor. Without which, it will be difficult for her to graduate to the WTA Tour this year. 

I intend to play few more tournaments both in juniors and WTA tour but dont know whether I will be able to afford it on my own, Shivika said. 

Shivika became the No.1 junior tennis player of the country after she managed to break into the top 150 in the ITF juniors circuit. As per the rankings list announced by ITF last Monday, she is now ranked 148 which means she is No. 1 in India at present, BTA chief administrator Sujoy (Pappu) Ghosh said. 

Akhtar Ali, who is instrumental in Shivikas meteoric rise, also speaks highly of this budding talent. If she gets proper training and adequate foreign exposures, she will make it big three years down the line. 

Shivika and other Bengal teammates will be felicitated by the BTA on Monday for their silver-medal winning effort in the National Games in Guwahati. Shivika and Ragini Vimal went down fighting to Delhi in the final of the womens section.

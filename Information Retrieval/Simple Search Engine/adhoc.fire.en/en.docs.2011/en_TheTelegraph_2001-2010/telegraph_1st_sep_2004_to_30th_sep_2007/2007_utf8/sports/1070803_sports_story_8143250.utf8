 Gag on Alonso, Hamilton

Budapest: McLaren gagged Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso at the Hungarian Grand Prix on Thursday to shield them from the spy controversy. Double world champion Alonso was withdrawn, with the permission of the governing body, from the scheduled international automobile federation (FIA) news conference at the Hungaroring. Hamiltons regular sessions with reporters were also cancelled, although the championship leading rookie went ahead with an engagement for title sponsor Vodafone in Budapest in the morning.

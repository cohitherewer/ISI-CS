The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Roger Federer standing on the threshold of history

 - FRENCH OPEN 

 - Nadal a victory away from emulating Borgs hattrick 

 at Roland Garros 

 Mark Hodgkinson in Paris

 So relentless has been Roger Federers 

 reworking of the record books that he might as well travel 

 with a personal statistician. And should he lift the Coupes 

 des Mousquetaires for the first time by beating two-time 

 defending champion Rafael Nadal in Sundays French 

 Open final, it would seal his place as the greatest racket-swinger 

 of all time.

 The 25-year-old has 10 Grand Slam 

 titles from his three trophies at the Australian Open, his 

 four at Wimbledon, and his three at the US Open. But the 

 one thing which has been missing from his CV has been a 

 victory on the red clay of Roland Garros, leading some commentators 

 to qualify their praise for the world No 1. Beating the 

 brutish, brilliant Nadal would prove that Federer can win 

 on all surfaces, making those ifs, buts and maybes disappear 

 like puffs of baseline dust.

 Nadal is just one victory away 

 from a hattrick of titles at Roland Garros, a feat only 

 Swede Bjorn Borg has previously achieved during the Open 

 era. But it would be colossal if Federer, last years 

 runner-up to Nadal, became the new King of Clay, especially 

 as that would also make him only the third man in history 

 to hold all four Grand Slam titles at the same time, following 

 on from American Don Budge in 1938 and Australian Rod Laver 

 in 1962 and 1969.

 And such a non-calendar Roger 

 Slam would mean that a proper calendar Grand Slam 

 would most definitely be on, as Federer would be the favourite 

 to triumph once more at Wimbledon and then at the US Open. 

 Winning here would open the door to doing the Grand 

 Slam, winning the four titles in one year, Federer 

 said after Fridays 7-5, 7-6, 7-6 victory against Russian 

 Nikolay Davydenko, which took him into an eighth successive 

 Grand Slam final, yet another record.

 Nadals 7-5, 6-4, 6-2 win 

 over Serbian Novak Djokovic took him to 20 victories from 

 20 matches at the clay-court slam. He is yet to drop a set 

 during this tournament, while Federer conceded one during 

 his quarter-final victory over Spaniard Tommy Robredo.

 Federer is under no illusions 

 about the challenge that he will face in trying to get the 

 better of Nadal, a man whom Serena Williams rightly described 

 as an animal on the slowest and the most demanding 

 of all the surfaces.

 So Sunday will see the classical 

 tennis player versus the clay-court animal, 

 and Federer will need to perform substantially better than 

 he did during his untidy match against Davydenko, when he 

 had to recover from a deficit in all three sets. Davydenko 

 served for the second set, and also served for the third, 

 in which he held three set points.

 As Borg has pointed out, matches 

 between Federer and Nadal always have the feel of a 

 big fight, but there could hardly be more riding on 

 this one.

 Here is why Federer needs that 

 stats man at his side. There is a famous quintet of men 

 to have won all four majors, comprising Britains Fred 

 Perry, Budge, Laver, Australian Roy Emerson and American 

 Andre Agassi. So Federer could become the sixth, and would 

 then move to joint third with Laver and Borg in the list 

 of most Grand Slam titles won, with Emerson in second on 

 12 and Pete Sampras who never won in Paris on a record 

 14.

 Of course, this is the second 

 year in succession that Federer has reached the French Open 

 final with the possibility of holding all four slams simultaneously. 

 Last year, Federer had just the start he wanted in the final, 

 taking the opening set 6-1 and dominating Nadal, but thereafter 

 he was well below par and was beaten over four sets.

 So what has changed in 12 months? 

 Well, Federer finally scored a clay-court win over Nadal 

 in last months Hamburg final, attacking more than 

 he ever had against the Majorcan for his first success in 

 six meetings on the dirt. That ended Nadals clay-court 

 winning streak of 81 matches, and, for Federer, it felt 

 like a breakthrough.

 And yet the relevance of that 

 result has been much debated. For all the encouragement 

 that Federer received from that victory, Nadal was mentally 

 fatigued and far from his best. Also, the deadened bounce 

 in Hamburg helped Federer, while the livelier Roland Garros 

 clay suits Nadal. Plus, that match was over three sets. 

 This will be over five. Will Nadal stop history in its tracks 

 on Sunday?

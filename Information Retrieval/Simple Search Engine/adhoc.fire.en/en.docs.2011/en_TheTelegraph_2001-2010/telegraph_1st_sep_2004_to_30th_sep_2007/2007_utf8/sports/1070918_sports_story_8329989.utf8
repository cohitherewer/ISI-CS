 Torres boost for Liverpool

London: The aristocrats of European football get the chance to show off their latest accessories when the Champions League returns to stadiums across the continent this week. 

The first round of group matches are liberally sprinkled with heavyweight clashes, AC Milan against Benfica in group D and the group A opener between Porto and Liverpool standing out among the 16 games this week. 

Five-time European champions Liverpool, boosted by the arrival of Spanish striker Fernando Torres, will be wary of a trip to Porto, having not won in Portugal for 23 years. 

Portos domestic rivals Sporting are also in action against English opposition when they take on Manchester United in group F on Wednesday. Barcelona will look forward to unleashing Ronaldinho and Thierry Henry on much-changed French champions Olympique Lyon while the champions of Italy meet the champions of Turkey when Fenerbahce host Inter Milan in Istanbul. 

Chelsea will be without Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard for Tuesdays group B opener against Rosenborg Trondheim of Norway.

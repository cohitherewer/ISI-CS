 Gillian wishes coach luck

Melbourne: Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson has received a comforting letter from Gillian, the widow of predecessor Bob Woolmer, assuring the Aussie that there was no reason to fear his new job. 

Its a lovely letter about how he loved coaching Pakistan, loved the people. She wished me all the best, Lawson said. 

It comforted me in the fact that (Woolmers family) gave me their support, Lawson was quoted as saying in a local newspaper. 

The newly appointed coach said people were misunderstanding the situation in Pakistan because every congratulatory message that he had received since his appointment mainly spoke about the volatile environment. But the situation was not less scary in London or New York, he said. 

The amount of people who have said to me congratulations, have also said but youre mad. (But) there are less concerns than Id have going to London or New York. I was in England in 2005 when all the bombs went off, and that was scary. 

(People) see the red mosque shootout there and hear about Osama bin Laden hiding in the hills of Pakistan. But its like if youre hiding in outback Australia and you live in Sydney, Lawson said. 

The Australian hockey team decided not to go, I find that astonishing. As sportspersons in Australia are revered, here in sub-continent they are almost deities. If youre involved in sport, thats the safest situation to be in, he added. 

Lawson also said he was not concerned by the confusion surrounding the investigation into the death of Woolmer. 

You look through that stuff and you do wonder why the Jamaican authorities came out (and said it was murder). It was only their initial announcement that got people in a tizzy about the whole thing. Why couldnt they solve it? Because no one did it. (PTI)

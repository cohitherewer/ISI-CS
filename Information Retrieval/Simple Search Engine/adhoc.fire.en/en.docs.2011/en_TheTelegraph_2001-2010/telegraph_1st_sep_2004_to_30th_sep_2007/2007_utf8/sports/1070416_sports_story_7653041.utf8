 Porterfield hits 85 as Ireland notch up 

243 for seven

Bridgetown: Trent Johnstons gamble to bat first on a bouncy Barbados pitch paid off as Ireland openers gave a perfect start in their match against Bangladesh in their World Cup Super Eight match on Sunday. Defying the Bangladesh attack, William Porterfield and Jeremy Bray put on 92 for the first wicket. 

Riding on Porterfields 85 from 136 balls Ireland notched up 243/7 in the stipulated 50 overs. 

The pitch offered plenty of bounce to Bangladeshs opening bowlers Mashrafe Moratza and Shahadat Hossain but that was a risk the Irish were willing to take to avoid facing the battery of left-arm spinners if the pitch took turn later in the day. 

Porterfield did the bulk of the scoring as Bray, whose last four innings have yielded two runs, was at his deiant best. Porterfield had his share of luck as two edges fell short of the slip cordon. Ireland scored only 32 off the first Powerplay, primarily in singles. 

Eventually, Bangladesh got the first breakthrough (Bray) in the form of a run out when Mushfiqur Rahim and Saqibul Hasan did the damage. Bray made 31 in his 70-ball slow innings. 

Incidentally, from the seven wickets that Bangladesh took four were in the form of run-outs. Porterfield went on to make 85 having faced 136 balls. His sedate innings saw three boundaries. 

After Porterfields departure there was a brief hiccup from the Irish batsmen but Kevin Brien who missed his half-century by two runs and skipper Johnston (30) did some amends. 

Ireland recalled allrounder Andre Botha, replacing John Mooney, after he missed the nine-wicket defeat by champions Australia on Friday due to a hamstring injury. 

Bangladesh were forced to replace left-arm paceman Syed Rasel with 20-year-old paceman Shahadat Hossain after the former suffered an injury while warming up. 

Bangladesh are aiming to score their second victory in the Super Eight.

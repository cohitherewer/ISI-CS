 Nanis maiden goal gives United win

London: Manchester United won its first game of the Premier League season on Sunday, with Nani scoring his debut goal in a 1-0 victory over Tottenham. Nanis 68th-minute goal came after a frantic period of play where Tottenham striker Dimitar Berbatov had two shots saved. 

It was only the second goal scored this season by defending champion United. The Red Devils have drawn two and lost one of its previous games. Also Sunday, Julio Arca scored a late goal to earn Middlesbrough a 2-2 draw against Newcastle. 

Shortly before Nanis goal, Berbatovs attempt went through the legs of United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar and defender Rio Ferdinand beat the Bulgarian to clear it off the line. Soon after, Berbatov was in another position to score, but the ball was stopped by United defender Wes Brown. 

 The Red Devils have been hurt up front by the absence of striker Wayne Rooney, who broke his foot on the opening day of the season, and winger Cristiano Ronaldo, who is suspended until after next Saturdays game against Sunderland. 

Mark Viduka had scored his first goal for Newcastle since joining from Middlesbrough in the off season in the 77th. Newcastle substitute Michael Owen missed the chance to win the match when he sent a free kick from Charles NZogbia into the arms of Middlesbrough goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer. (AP)

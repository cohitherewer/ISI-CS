 Sasi starts with win

Sasikiran was a class act with his white pieces as he won a one-sided affair in the queens Indian defence game. Onischuk was the first to deviate from main variations on his 12th turn and his 16th move was a error-filled that gave Sasikiran an opportunity for a thematic exchange sacrifice lading to complexities favouring the Indian. 

The Indian slowly increased his advantage in the ensuing middle game leaving Onischuk pieces less mobilised even though the position was open. Banking on his passed pawn on the 6th rank, Sasikiran clinched the issue in just 35 moves. 

Lenier Dominguezz of Cuba and Alexei Shirov were the days other winners, while the remaining three games ended in draws. Dominiguez accounted for Loek Van Wely of Holland while Shirov beat Sergei Rublevsky. (PTI)

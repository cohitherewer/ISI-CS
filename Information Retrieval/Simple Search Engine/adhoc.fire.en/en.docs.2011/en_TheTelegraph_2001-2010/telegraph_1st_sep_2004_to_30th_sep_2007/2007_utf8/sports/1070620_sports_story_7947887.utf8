 Panesar spins England to 3-0 series triumph

 - Chanderpaul becomes only batsman to remain unbeaten for more than 1,000 minutes thrice 

 Michael Vaughan and Paul Collingwood leave the field after their win 

Durham: England completed a 3-0 series win over the West Indies on Tuesday with a seven-wicket victory on the final day of the fourth Test. 

England, set 110 to win, reached 111 for three as Michael Vaughan (48 not out) steered England home in his first Test series in 18 months after injury. 

Left-arm spinner Monty Panesar took five for 46 in West Indies second innings 222 in which Shivnarine Chanderpaul scoring 70, his sixth successive Test in excess of 50. 

Chanderpaul had batted for 17 hours 38 minutes in the series without being dismissed until he was last man out on Tuesday and he is the only batsman to have gone unbeaten for more than a 1,000 minutes on three occasions. 

He holds the world record with an unbeaten sequence of 1,513 minutes in 2002 against India, a series in which he averaged 148.66. 

West Indies hopes of survival faded after lunch when Dwayne Bravo miscued a lofted straight drive and was caught at mid-off off Panesar for 43. The innings then gradually folded around the seemingly immovable Chanderpaul. 

West Indies began the last day batting to save the match, but trailing with seven wickets in hand. However, this West Indies team is not capable of such application. 

Chanderpaul started the day on 16 and Chris Gayle on 52. The left-handed Gayle had faced seven balls without scoring when Hoggard enticed him to edge an outswinging delivery to wicketkeeper Matt Prior to make the score 94 for four. 

Only 48 runs were scored in the 90-minute session, shortened because of bad light that delayed the start of play by 30 minutes. 

Chanderpaul and Dwayne Bravo put on 68 for the fifth wicket before Bravo fell to Panesars guile 30 minutes after lunch, with the score on 169 for a lead of 56. 

Bravo scored 44 in the first innings and took on Panesar with a lofted chip for four. The very next ball, Bravo tried another ambitious shot but only succeeded in lofting the ball to Sidebottom at mid-off. 

Marlon Samuels (2) was caught at slip off Panesar, who then produced a classical left-arm spinners delivery that pitched on middle stump and clipped off to bowl Denesh Ramdin (4). 

While Panesar was taking wickets, pace bowler Steve Harmison was working up a head of steam and bowled 12 consecutive overs. First he persuaded Daren Powell to take a wild swing at the ball to be caught at mid-off by Vaughan, and then he uprooted Fidel Edwards off stump with a snorting delivery.

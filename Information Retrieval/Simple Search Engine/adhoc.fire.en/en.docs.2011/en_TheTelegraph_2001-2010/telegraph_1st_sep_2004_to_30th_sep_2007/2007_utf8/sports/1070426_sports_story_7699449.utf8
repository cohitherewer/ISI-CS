Loughborough: New England coach Peter Moores gave a ringing endorsement of captain Michael Vaughan on Wednesday and confirmed the batsman would lead the team into the first Test of the new season. 

Moores was appointed last week to replace Duncan Fletcher, who stood down after eight years in the job in the wake of an Ashes whitewash and a poor showing at the World Cup. 

At his first news conference in his new role the former Sussex and England Academy coach said Yorkshires Vaughan, under pressure as one-day captain after a poor World Cup in the Caribbean, would be a key part of his England set-up. 

Ill talk to Michael Vaughan about the way he wants to go forward and the way I do, Moores told reporters ahead of next months clash with West Indies. Michael is already captain for that first Test, so I think its important to speak to him. 

His reputation as a captain goes without saying and hell have some fairly interesting views on what happened in the winter. There are lots of things that make a team tick but the captain-coach relationship is one of the key ones. 

Michael came to Perth before Christmas and to watch him operate as a man was very impressive. I was very impressed and Im looking forward to working with him. 

There have been calls for Vaughan to be relieved of the captaincy of the under-performing one-day side but Moores indicated that he would want him to continue in both roles. 

Michaels record as a captain is outstanding, he said. 

I want to see what Michaels view is and what lessons have been learned over the winter. In an ideal world its nice to have one captain. 

Moores, who is held in high regard as a coach despite never playing international cricket, said he felt fantastic about the challenge ahead and was really looking forward to it. 

Im waiting for the chance to talk to the players about what went wrong, he said of their dreadful winter. 

Weve shown, in the Ashes here, that there are some fantastic players in that team who can play some great cricket and the key is to get that great cricket being played again by the England team. 

Its been a tough winter and out of tough times you learn a lot. It was pretty successful before the last 12 months, so it is important to learn. 

Asked about his methods at Sussex, who he led to the first County championship of their history in 2003, he said: The success at Sussex is based a lot on the environment that is created it is key that players are happy to go out and express themselves. 

Hopefully, Im honest and fair, I love the game of cricket and want it to be played in the right way. I want the players to go out and enjoy it. 

Earlier on Wednesday, Englands squad arrived back from the World Cup with the players having little time to recharge their batteries before they face West Indies on May 17 at Lords.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Famed Bourda fades away

Georgetown: Like a slumbering relic of bygone colonial days, Guyanas famed Bourda is crumbling slowly, the victim of modernisation and of demand for gleaming new stadiums. 

In the members bar, a steward dressed in shirt and tie serves the occasional member of Georgetown Cricket Club who has popped in for a drink. But the days of watching the worlds finest playing on the Bourdas dark brown, shiny wicket are mostly over. 

International cricket has probably had its day at Bourda, an idiosyncratic stadium famed for being the only cricket ground in the world below sea level and one which consequently floods dramatically whenever tropical rains sweep in from the Atlantic Ocean.

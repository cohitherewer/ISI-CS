 SHARP SINGLES

Lloyds logic

St Georges: West Indies manager Clive Lloyd has defended the controversial decision to grant the squad a mini-holiday despite Brian Laras men standing on the brink of World Cup elimination. This is something that was asked for before the tournament started. If you have 10 days between matches, there was nothing wrong with going home for a short while. It wasnt a case where everybody just walked off in frustration, Lloyd told a local newspaper. You cant really practise for 10 days straight, he said. 

Dilharas ploy

 London: Sri Lanka fast bowler Chaminda Vaas has admitted teammate Dilhara Fernando did employ some gamesmanship before the final ball of their World Cup win over England. Ravi Bopara needed three runs for England to win the match in Antigua, but Fernando pulled out of his delivery before resuming his run and clean bowled the batsman. A bowler has the right to test a batsman at any time, Vaas told a radio station. I think as an experienced bowler, Dilhara deliberately did it.

Angry Bashar

 Barbados: Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar on Monday hit out at critics who bemoan the absence of India and Pakistan in the Super Eight, saying the sub-continental giants do not have a right to be there. It seems that at any cost India and Pakistan should be included in the Super Eight. They dont have the right to play there, he wrote in his column. The World Cup is not a property of one or two teams. It belongs to everyone and the best team will win.

 Marias hopes suffer a blow

Moscow: Maria Sharapovas hopes of playing in the Beijing Olympics suffered a major blow after she was told that she would not be considered for the Russian Fed Cup team to face Italy in Septembers final. 

Captain Shamil Tarpishchev has lost patience with the former world No.1 who is yet to represent her country. 

Tarpishchevs decision not to call Sharapova into his squad may cost the 2004 Wimbledon champion a chance to play at the Olympics. (AFP)

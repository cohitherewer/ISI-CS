The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We need Pathan, says Sourav

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The day before Irfan Pathan appears for a trial in Ahmedabad, Sourav Ganguly said that India need the allrounder in their World Cup campaign. 

I got to know from the media that there is a question mark over Pathans fitness, said the former India captain at a function in Calcutta where he signed as the brand ambassador for Puma India. I hope he gets through We need him in the side. 

Pathan, who will don West Zone colours against Central, has to prove hes match-fit in the presence of selection committee chairman Dilip Vengsarkar. 

On the minnows in the World Cup, Sourav differed with West Indian great Michael Holdings view that there were too many teams in the competition. It is the duty of the stronger teams to support these sides and help them do better. If we dont play against these teams, they will not get the exposure, Sourav said. 

Asked if the presence of Bermuda, Canada, Ireland, Scotland and The Netherlands would devalue the World Cup, he said: I dont think so We are playing these teams only in the preliminaries. 

Sourav said there shouldnt be any lack of motivation while playing against the minnows. Playing in the World Cup is motivation enough, adding that India, too, had gone through a similar stage of development in the early years of their cricketing history.

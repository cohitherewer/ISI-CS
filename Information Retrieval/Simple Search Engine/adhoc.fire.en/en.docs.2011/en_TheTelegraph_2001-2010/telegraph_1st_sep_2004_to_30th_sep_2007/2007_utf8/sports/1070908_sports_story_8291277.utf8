 Sreesanth pens song for India

 Kochi: Firing teasing deliveries and breaking into dance after seeing the back of batsmen makes him quite a character on the cricket field, but there is more to know about young Sreesanth.

 Guess what! Now in run up to the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 meet, the pacer from Kerala has penned a song Jago India to motivate the Indian team.

 The song, featuring in album Desh, revolves around the aspirations and hopes of the nation in the coming Twenty20 meet, rdquo; Sreesanth said after releasing the song, here on Friday.

 Sung by his brother-in-law and renowned playback singer Madhu Balakrishnan, the video of the song is directed by Srikanth, an associate of filmmaker Priyadarshan.

 Deepak Warrier, a B. Tech computer science engineering student, has put the song to tune.

 The lyrics of Jago India is ldquo;har raat, har subha, dekha hai khwaab yeh, saara Hindustaan, saara Hindustan, Jaagoo India rdquo;. 

 SA on guard 

 Johannesburg: The last occasion when South Africa hosted a world cricket event the hosts crashed out ignominiously. Home team captain Graeme Smith will be hoping history doesn rsquo;t repeat itself in the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 championship starting at the Wanderers here next Tuesday. 

 By coincidence, South Africa rsquo;s tournament-opener is against the West Indies, the side that first derailed the Proteas rsquo; campaign by winning the first game of the 2003 World Cup at Newlands in Cape Town. 

 Shaun Pollock was fired as captain and Smith took over at the age of 22 because of South Africa rsquo;s failure to advance beyond the group stage in 2003.

 Dave pulls out 

 Dhaka: Former Zimbabwe captain Dave Houghton has pulled out of the race to be Bangladesh cricket coach, leaving two Australians in contention, the cricket board said on Friday. 

 John Harmer, who has coached the women rsquo;s teams of Australia and England, and Jamie Siddons, who played for Australia in a single ODI, have been left in a two-way battle. 

 Houghton decided he had to look after his ailing parents, said BCB chief executive Mahmudur Rahman.

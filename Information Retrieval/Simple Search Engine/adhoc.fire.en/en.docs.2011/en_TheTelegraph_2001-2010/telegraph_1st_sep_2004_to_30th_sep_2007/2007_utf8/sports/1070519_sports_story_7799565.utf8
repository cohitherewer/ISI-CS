 Inzamam hits back 

 Inzamam 

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq has hit back at accusations that his autocratic leadership was responsible for his teams poor performance at the Caribbean World Cup. 

All the gentlemen on this probe committee are my elders and I respect them, but the truth is that none of them have any experience of captaincy, Inzamam said on Friday. Unfortunately in Pakistan, after every defeat these sort of accusations are made. 

Inzamam also questioned why Altaf, who was working for the PCB when he was captain, had never accused him of being autocratic before. I am sad that after serving Pakistan cricket for so long the committee has heaped all the blame on me. 

Meanwhile, Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik has urged selectors to include Inzamam in the Test side. 

He is a great player and we dont have the ideal back up replacements at the moment. I also feel these senior players should be pushed to play more for Pakistan, Malik said in Abu Dhabi. (Agencies)

 Bill Johnston passes away at 85

Sydney: Bill Johnston, a member of Don Bradmans 1948 Invincibles, has died at the age of 85, Cricket Australia announced on Friday. 

Johnston was a versatile left-arm bowler who played 40 Tests for Australia between 1947 and 1955, capturing 160 wickets at an average of 23.91. 

Originally a slow bowler who turned to pace, he was best known as one of the spearheads of Bradmans 1948 team that went through their post-War tour of Britain unbeaten. 

Those of us fortunate enough to have known Bill will remember him as a good companion, well-humoured, passionate about cricket and always willing to share his knowledge, chairman of Cricket Australia, Creagh Connor, said in a statement. 

Johnston also bagged 554 wickets for Victoria. 

Bradmans Invincibles are regarded as one of the finest cricket teams, while Bradman is recognised as the greatest batsman of all time. 

Bradman died in 2001, aged 92 and there are now five surviving members of the squad Arthur Morris, Neil Harvey, Sam Loxton, Bill Brown and Ron Hamence. (Reuters)

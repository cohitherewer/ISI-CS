The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 ICC president Percy Sonn extremely critical

 Percy Sonn 

Durban: International Cricket Council president Percy Sonn is gravely ill in hospital after surgery, his personal assistant said on Tuesday. 

[An unusual situation will emerge should the worst happen to Sonn, as theres no vice-president. Indias Sharad Pawar and Englands David Morgan have been locked in battle to earn the right to be Sonns successor. 

[If something terrible happens, then the Executive Board is probably going to appoint an acting president till such time that elections can be held, ICC spokesman Brian Murgatroyd told The Telegraph on Tuesday evening. 

[Sonns term runs till June 2009, adds Our Special Correspondent in Calcutta.] 

He is extremely critical, George Hector said from Cape Town. He was admitted to hospital on Monday last week (May 14) for serious but routine surgery, but complications set in afterwards and he has deteriorated since. 

Hector said the family preferred to keep the details private. 

He is heavily sedated at the moment and unable to communicate, he added. 

Sonn, 57, became ICC president in 2006, capping a stellar career in cricket administration that began during South Africas isolation from international sport because of Apartheid. 

Sonn is the sixth person to head the ICC after Colin Cowdrey (1989-93), sir Clyde Walcott (1993-97), Jagmohan Dalmiya (1997-2000), Malcolm Gray (2000-03) and Ehsan Mani (2003-06). 

Sonn, as a senior counsel, represented the UCBSA at the ICC during the match-fixing controversies in 2000. 

He rose through the ranks of the United Cricket Board (UCB), which was formed after the sport unified across racial lines in 1991, and was UCB president from 2000 to 2003. 

Sonn, a senior counsel who has been an acting judge, formed and headed the Directorate of Special Operations in South Africa, a crack investigative police unit modelled on the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States.

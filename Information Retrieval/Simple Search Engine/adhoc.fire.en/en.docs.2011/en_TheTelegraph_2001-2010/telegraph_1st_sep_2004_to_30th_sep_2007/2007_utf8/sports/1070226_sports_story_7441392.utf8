 Hair not to sue PCB: Ashraf 

New Delhi: Australian umpire Darrell Hair has decided not to sue Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for racial discrimination but would pursue a simultaneous law suit against the International Cricket Council (ICC). 

I have been told by our lawyer Mark Gay that Hair has withdrawn the case, PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf was quoted as saying in a Saudi newspaper. 

Hair knew well that he had no case against us, what he has done is there for everyone to see. If any party had a case, it was Pakistan, Dr Ashraf said. 

However, Hair would continue to pursue the simultaneous lawsuit he filed against the ICC, the report said. 

Hair had filed the cases against the ICC and the PCB after the games world body decided to keep him out of officiating in matches featuring Test nations.

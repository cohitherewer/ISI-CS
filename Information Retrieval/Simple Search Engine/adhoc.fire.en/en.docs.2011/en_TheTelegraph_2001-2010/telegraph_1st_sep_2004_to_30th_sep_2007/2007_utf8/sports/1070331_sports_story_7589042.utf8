 Maradona stable

Buenos Aires: Initial medical tests on Diego Maradona, who is being treated at a private clinic for alcoholism and excessive eating, are all favourable and the soccer hero remains in stable condition. 

A day after Maradona was taken by ambulance to the Guemes Sanatorium, Clinic director Hector Pezzella said the 47-year-old spent Thursday under sedation to avoid problems with withdrawal from alcohol. He said Maradonas life was not in danger and that he was in stable condition and improving. 

Alcoholism in Mr Maradona or in any other patient is not something to be taken lightly. One has to treat it, Pezzella said. They are undertaking treatment specifically for addiction.

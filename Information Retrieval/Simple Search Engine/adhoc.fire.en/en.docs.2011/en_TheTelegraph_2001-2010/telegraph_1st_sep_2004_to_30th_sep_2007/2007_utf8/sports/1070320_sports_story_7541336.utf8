The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 At the highest level, much of it is self-help

 WOOLMERSPEAK

Beginning January 1993, Bob Woolmer always found time to interact with The Telegraph. The following excerpts have been reproduced from his last two one-on-ones in Faisalabad (January 2006) and Chandigarh (October 2006) 

THE FAISALABAD INTERVIEW 

On being Pakistans coach 

It would have been easy to turn down the offer, but Im happy I took the job Ive made friends, have begun to understand the Pakistani culture In fact, Ive been reading books on Islam Im definitely more at home (in Lahore) than when I first came. That Im now able to drive in the Pakistani traffic has given confidence I was nervous, yes Frankly, I didnt know what to expect I came with an open mind as there was no point coming with preconceived ideas. 

On overcoming that nervousness 

By the courage of conviction in my (style of) coaching I knew certain things work in any environment and certain things can be adjusted Also, that the basic concepts work everywhere. 

On the Pakistani players professionalism vis-a-vis the South Africans 

I didnt find any change in the desire to do well But, yes, I found much less accent on fitness They werent aware of the need to train, but trained in the manner cricketers probably did in the 1980s Unbelievably, they over-loaded the training on the eve of a match You over-load in the off-season, never during the season. 

On whether he has had to adjust his style 

The players here are far more sensitive to criticism Also, Ive been conscious that English humour may not be well received Most (in Pakistan) are extremely critical of what you do Yet, if you become critical, they dont take it well Perhaps, this is common to countries where the nation is still being built. 

On the time it took to become comfortable in the dressing room 

It did take me time getting used to prayers at tea time On the other side, it took the players time getting used to being moved up or down the batting order I found them sensitive to that Basically, Ive found the players shy At times, Ive found them struggling to open their mind. If their mind was a parachute, they would probably land hard! 

On the time it took captain Inzamam-ul Haq to strike a rapport with him 

Eight months or thereabouts Its not that we werent civil or nice to each other, but it did take time to understand each other fully We share responsibility, but Inzys the boss. Id say Im his right-hand man! Im his personal assistant We may not agree on everything, but we sure have enough respect for each other. 

On Inzamams USP 

His knowledge of the game Hes not going to lead from the front by sprinting or whatever His manner is quite different No captain gets it right all the time 

On handling Shoaib Akhtar 

Early on, I did question Shoaibs commitment He didnt like it, but has done something about it Im not taking credit for his turnaround Shoaib has done it himself At best, I rattled the cage 

On what has coaching taught him 

Humility Respect for the game and respect for the players Also, that technically, theres no real answer to a problem. I may guide the player to a solution, but the actual answer has to be got by the player himself At the highest level, much of it is self-help. 

THE CHANDIGARH INTERVIEW 

On nearing the business end of his contract 

If the World Cup was held tomorrow, we wouldnt do very well However, weve got time and the team can evolve We do really well one day, but theres a dip owing to complacency or whatever in the next match From any point of view, the lows which follow the highs are disturbing 

On staying calm despite the many controversies 

If I wont, who will? It would be easy to throw a few toys out of the cot and indulge in histrionics I suppose its my love for the game which is a binding factor. Cricket, youve got to remember, is bigger than all of us. Part of any coachs role is to try and maintain serenity, encourage the belief that the team has it to go forward Of course, there have been situations when it wouldve been easy for me to say enough is enough But cricket drives me and Ive developed a bond with the players I dont want to give in to the dark forces 

On whether staying calm has come with an effort 

I was brought up in an era of calmness I was taught you would win matches if you stayed calm In fact, I learnt from my father (Charles) as well... Ive got the calmness trait from my father and have inherited my mothers drive and energy While the calmness is largely in-bred, Ive also had to develop it in the Pakistan situation There have been times, believe me, when I couldve throttled people But, then, of what use would that be? The natural reaction in Pakistan, to a defeat, is to throw out everybody Thats not possible and its an attitude which destroys One needs to develop the team, put it on track Give it stability, not destabilise. 

On what he told his players after news of the doping scandal broke in Jaipur, on the eve of Pakistans Champions Trophy opener against Sri Lanka 

Quite simple that we cant control what has happened, but its for us to control our cricket That our desire and hunger must not diminish If you start worrying, then youre focusing on external issues and it will impact on your on-field performance. 

On the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) being so unstable 

Despite resignations, cricket continues and the PCB continues to run In a way, Pakistan is evolving as a country and so are the bodies within it One needs time to have the stability seen in England and Australias cricket structure. The desire and aspirations have to be harnessed and nurtured in the right manner Its then that cricket is going to blossom in Pakistan. 

On having been coach for 28 months 

Look, the challenges have been big, but the frustrations greater But the players and the people around the team have been terrific When I do look back on this experience, Im bound to say I became much richer as a person. 

On life after the World Cup 

Ive always been involved with a few things Ill cross the bridge when I reach it

 Atwal makes the cut

Fort Smith (US): Arjun Atwal made good ground in the second round with a three-under 67 to make the midway cut at the Fort Smith Classic here on Friday. 

Atwal, who has been dividing his time between the Nationwide and PGA Tours, has an aggregate of three-under 137 to be tied 51st. 

Atwal had an even par 70 on the first day. Starting out on the first tee Friday, Atwal birdied the third, fourth and sixth, and without any bogeys turned in three-under. The Indian then added a fourth birdie on the 12th. On the 14th, he had his only blemish with a bogey on the par-four hole. 

Local resident Craig Lile (64) overtook Scott Gutschewski (67) at the top of the leaderboard. Lile is now 10-under and one ahead of Gutschewski. Lile, who had a 65 in the first round, had a fine stretch between second and nine, when he fired five birdies during it.

 Shoaib Akhtar appeals against fine

 Shoaib Akhtar

Karachi: Controversial fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has filed an appeal against the fine and penalty imposed on him by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for alleged indiscipline. 

The PCB fined Shoaib Rs 3,00,000 and docked points from his central contract after he had left the national training camp, here without informing team manager Talat Ali earlier this month. 

The PCB chairman will soon constitute an appellate committee to hear the appeal and there is no time frame to wrap up this issue, PCB chief executive Shafqat Nagmi said. 

Shoaib, in his appeal, accepted that he did leave the camp without informing the manager but claimed to have told captain Shoaib Malik before he did so. 

The fast bowler also asserted that he could not appear before the boards disciplinary committee as he received the showcause notice late, Nagmi informed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 CAB report heaps praise on Dalmiya

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The working committee of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) on Tuesday approved the annual report which is to be placed at the AGM on July 28. The most significant part of the 35-page report is one full page devoted to congratulate former president Jagmohan Dalmiya. 

The Prasun Mukherjee-headed association has heaped praises on Dalmiya, describing him as a master of cricket administration. 

Asked why Dalmiya had got special mention in the annual report, the police commissioner said: He was a great administrator and made a lot of contribution to the game. 

The last date for filing nominations for the CAB elections is July 20. The annual prize distribution function will be held on July 22. 

The Dalmiya-related part in the annual report is produced verbatim below: 

A master of cricket administration, Mr Jagmohan Dalmiya is the man who was responsible for translating the game of cricket to a global sport of big money that has transcended several peaks well beyond its traditional base. His journey in cricket administration began in 1978-79 when he became the Treasurer of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB). Thereafter he had been its Secretary (1981-82 to 1984-85), Vice-President (1985-86 to 1988-89), Executive President (1989-90 to 1991-92). From 1992-93, he had gloriously adorned the position of President till December 27, 2006. 

Mr Dalmiya was also the Treasurer of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) from 1983-84 to 1984-85, its Secretary in 1990-91 and from 1993-94 to 1996-97, and its President from 2001-02 to 2003-04. 

He was the first Asian, leave alone Indian, to be elected as the President of the International Cricket Council (ICC) from 1997 to 2000. He was also the Secretary of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) from 1993 to 1997 and its President from June 2004 to December 2005, and the Chairman of the Afro-Asian Cricket Cooperation during the said period. 

Cricket in Bengal developed by leaps and bounds under the dynamic leadership of Mr Dalmiya. An adroit administrator and entrepreneur, Mr Dalmiya had engineered the commercialization of cricket in India and made the BCCI the richest cricketing body in the world. 

He left an indelible impression as the ICC president too. He had masterminded the globalization of cricket. His marketing acumen in fact, promoted The Wall Street Journal to describe him as The man who converted cricket into a multi-million dollar industry. 

Mr Dalmiya was actively involved in the organization of the two World Cups in 1987 and 1996, Nehru Centenary World Series Cricket in 1989, Asia Cup in 1990-91, besides a host of Test matches and One-Day Internationals. 

In 1993, the CAB was celebrating its Diamond Jubilee. Mr Dalmiya took the initiative and an international tournament featuring six teams was held by CAB. This was in fact, the first cricket event in India in which the broadcast rights were sold, opening a huge avenue of revenue for the game. 

In 1996, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) voted him as one of the best six sports administrators of the world. The International Journal of the History of Sport of the Taylor amp; Francis Group conferred the History of Sports Achievement Award to Mr Jagmohan Dalmiya, besides Mr Juan Antonio Samaranch and Mr Sepp Blatter. The University of Andhra Pradesh conferred a Doctorate on Mr Dalmiya for his outstanding contribution to sports administration. 

It would perhaps take several volumes to write about the glorious contribution of Mr Jagmohan Dalmiya not only to Bengal cricket, but also to international cricket. He resigned from the position of the President of the Association on December 27, 2006. But his achievements and contribution, especially to the game in the state and the country, would be remembered for all time to come.

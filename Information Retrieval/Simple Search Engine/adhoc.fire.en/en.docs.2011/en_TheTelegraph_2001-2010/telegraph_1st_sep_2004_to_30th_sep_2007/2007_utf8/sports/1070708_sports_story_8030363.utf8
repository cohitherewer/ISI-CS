The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 CAB chief to probe charge

A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) has received the complaint filed by the guardians of three boys from city-based coaching centres and its president, Prasun Mukherjee, has promised that he will look into the matter. 

We have received the letter, but there were no addresses of the complainants and so we will have make a thorough search (to find them) Mukherjee said, adding that he hadnt gone through the letter yet. 

Mukherjee said that he would try and find out how much of the complaint was true. I suppose part of the allegation may be true and part may not be, he said. 

Mukherjee also said the issue would be pursued till it reached the rightful conclusion. 

Meanwhile, father of E. Abhimanyu, R.P. Easwaran, has said in a letter to The Telegraph that Abhishek Raman has already represented Bengal under-15 B team last year and has toured Bangladesh where he scored a century. As far as Abhimanyu is concerned, he is one of the highest scorers in the 95-point CAB league this year and has got out only twice in the entire tournament, besides taking nine wickets. He has also taken many catches and was instrumental in many run-outs which can be evidenced by the CAB records. 

Easwaran further added that the boys, who have come up on the basis of their performance and one of whom is already playing under-15 have been targeted by frustrated parents whose allegations are on baseless premises. 

The boys are performing and their records, as can be verified from CAB, speak volumes of their capabilities, he added.

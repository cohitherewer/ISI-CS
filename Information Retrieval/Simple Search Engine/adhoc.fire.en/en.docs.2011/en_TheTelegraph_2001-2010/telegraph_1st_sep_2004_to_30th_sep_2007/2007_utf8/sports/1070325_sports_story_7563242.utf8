 South Africa hot on Aussie trail

Basseterre: Matthew Hayden smashed the fastest World Cup century to spark Australias surge to a record total in their group A match against South Africa on Saturday. 

Opener Hayden reached his century off 66 balls, one delivery fewer than previous record-holder John Davisons effort for Canada against West Indies in 2003. 

Hayden scored 101 in Australias total of 377 for six, which surpassed their previous record of 359 for two against India in the 2003 final. 

South Africa started the run chase in style, having made 228 for three in 34 overs. Jacques Kallis (29) and Mark Boucher (2) were at the crease while AB de Villiers (92) and Ashwell Prince (1) were dismissed. Graeme Smith retired hurt on 72. 

Ricky Ponting scored a run-a-ball 91 while Michael Clarke hit 92 off 75 balls. The Australian captain, on Saturday, became the seventh batsman in the world to complete 10000 runs in ODIs. He reached the mark when he was on eight. 

Australias 100 followed off 81 balls when Hayden drove medium-pacer Andrew Hall over extra cover for six. 

Fast bowler Charl Langeveldt separated the openers in the 15th over with 106 runs on the board. Gilchrist fell for 42 after steering to Herschelle Gibbs at backward point. 

Hayden claimed his record in the 23rd over with a straight six off part-time off-spinner Graeme Smith. 

The strapping left-hander was dismissed seven balls later when he looped a delivery from fast bowler Jacques Kallis to Gibbs at backward point. 

Ponting and Clarke ensured that Australia maintained their momentum by sharing a brisk stand of 161 for the third wicket. 

Clarke was dropped on eight by AB de Villiers at short mid-wicket off Pollock and again on 56 by Gibbs at backward point off Hall. 

Pollocks figures of nought for 83 were his worst in his 277 one-day Internationals. 

To win, South Africa will need to break Sri Lankas World Cup record of 313 for a team batting second. The Sri Lankans did it against New Zealand in New Plymouth in the 1992 World Cup.

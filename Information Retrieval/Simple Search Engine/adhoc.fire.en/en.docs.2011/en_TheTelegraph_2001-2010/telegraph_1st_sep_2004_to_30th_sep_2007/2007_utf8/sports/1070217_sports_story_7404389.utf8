The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Nothing wouldve happened without God... Ive been blessed: Sourav

 - Weve played good cricket over the past few weeks, but weve got to end on a high 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sourav 

Visakhapatnam: Dada what a comeback, Dada bowling-bowling were the impassioned comments as Sourav Ganguly kept himself busy at the fabulous Andhra Cricket Association-Visakhapatnam District Cricket Association Stadium, some 15 kms from the heart of this port city, late on Friday morning. 

Sourav couldnt spot the fans as they were some 300 metres away from Team Indias practice area, but smiled nevertheless. God has been kind... What else can I say? Nothing wouldve happened without God... Ive been blessed, Sourav told The Telegraph emotionally. 

Indeed, after having made the most glittering of comebacks (both in Tests and ODIs), Sourav even brought off the mother of all catches in Goa the other day. Well, as Ive said, its all due to Gods blessings, he maintained. 

After finishing as Team Indias highest scorer in the three-Test series in South Africa, Souravs ODI scores have been impressive: 98 (Nagpur), 13 (Cuttack), 68 (Vadodara, all against the West Indies); 62 (Rajkot) and 48 (Goa, both versus Sri Lanka). 

With a bit of luck and judicious shot selection, Sourav could have got a hundred each time he crossed fifty. Now, its to be seen whats in store in the fourth and final ODI of the ongoing series. The scoreline reads 1-1. 

Sourav, of course, is hoping Team India make a strong finish. As he put it: Weve played good cricket over the past few weeks, but weve got to end on a high, too... Tomorrow, after all, is our last ODI before the World Cup... 

The Stadium (which is just off the National Highway which leads to Bhubaneswar and Calcutta), by the way, has so far hosted only one ODI India-Pakistan almost two years ago. Souravs men then won big, with MoM Mahendra Singh Dhoni smashing all of 148 off 123 balls (at No. 3). 

Asked if this was an emotional return, Dhoni laughed and replied: Its nice to come back, but thats it... I live in the present, not the past... My first ODI hundred is something that happened a long time back... My thoughts are on the decider... 

Just about everybody elses as well.

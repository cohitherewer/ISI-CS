 Negi finishes on a positive note

Malmo: Worlds youngest Grandmaster Parimarjan Negi finished his campaign on a positive note defeating Emil Hermansson of Sweden in the ninth and final round of 15th Sigeman amp; Co. International Chess Tournament that concluded on Friday. 

GM Ivan Cheparinov of Bulgaria finished the formalities of winning the tournament after taking a draw with last years winner Jan Timman of Holland in his final round. 

Cheparinov finished with an impressive tally of seven points out of a possible nine to annex the title in this category-13 event by 1.5 points. 

The second place was jointly shared by Timman and Swede duo of Emanuel Berg and Tiger Hillarp Persson who all scored an identical 5.5 points each. Finishing a clear fifth was Pontus Carlsson of Sweden on five points while Vasilios Kotronias of Greece finished sixth a half-point behind. 

Hermansson was put under pressure early in the game with a double pawn sacrifice that Negi later topped with a fine piece sacrifice to force matters. The game lasted just 23 moves. 

Carlsson won a fine game with black pieces against Kotronias who misplayed the middle game. The Sicilian dragon by Carlsson proved good to get an advantage in the middle game after Kotornias went haywire with his planning and the rest was easy. (PTI)

 Bad day for Indians

Moscow: Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran mishandled a nearly won position and went down to Kazakh GM Darmen Sadvakasov in Round V as other Indians also conceded points in the A1 Group of the Aeroflot International Open Chess Tournament here on Monday. 

National champion Surya Sekhar Ganguly lost to Wang Hao of China in what was an extremely good opening preparation by the Chinese and former world junior champion P Harikrishna also miscalculated in a won position to be held to a draw by Li Chao of China. 

On other boards, S. Vijayalakshmi and Parimarjan Negi suffered contrasting defeats against Ildar Khairullin of Russia and Alexander Ivanov of United States respectively. (PTI)

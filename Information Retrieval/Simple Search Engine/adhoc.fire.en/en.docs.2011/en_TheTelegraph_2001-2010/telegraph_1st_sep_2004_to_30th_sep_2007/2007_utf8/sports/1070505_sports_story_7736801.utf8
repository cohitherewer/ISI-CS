 Atwal even par on Day I

Fort Smith (US): Arjun Atwal had two bogeys on his second nine to finish at par 70 after the first round of the Fort Smith Classic on the US Nationwide Tour. 

The Indian, working his way back into the main PGA Tour, is now tied 79th and will need a sub-par round to make weekend rounds. 

Scott Gutschewski fired a bogey-free seven under-par 63 to take a one-stroke lead over Paul Claxton, Brad Elder and Ron Whittaker. 

Atwal started on the back nine and looked well set with birdies on 11th and 13th, but then came a bogey on 14th. 

After a birdie on 17th, he was once again two-under at the turn. On his second nine, he had back-to-back bogeys on third and fourth and dropped to even par. (Pti)

 Jaffer, Karthik make opening statement

NILESH BHATTACHARYA 

Dhaka: Wasim Jaffer and Dinesh Karthik made a strong statement on Friday and potentially provided the answer to Indias opening dilemma ahead of the England tour. 

Braving hot and humid conditions for over four hours, the duo retired hurt after a 175-run stand, but not before ensuring that the heat was actually on Habibul Bashars team on Day I of the final Test. 

While Jaffer followed a pair in Chittagong with his fourth hundred (unbeaten 138) before suffering dehydration at the Sher-e-Bangla Stadium here, Karthik left the field due to cramps with 18 runs away from his maiden international three-figure mark. 

India finished the day at 326 without loss, with Rahul Dravid (88) also approaching his 24th century and Sachin Tendulkar batting on 9. 

The Indian openers can cool themselves in the dressing room as Bashars plan of giving coach Dav Whatmore a special farewell gift seems to have gone out of the window. 

The Bangladesh captain surprised everybody by opting to field on winning the toss. 

But his decision, which might have been influenced by an overcast sky, backfired as the Indian openers seized the opportunity with both hands on a placid strip. 

As the hosts were left wondering how the script could be changed in the match, Dravid must have got his answer to a critical issue ahead of the upcoming challenges. 

On the match eve, Dravid had expressed concern over opening berths on the tour of England and backed Jaffer and Karthik, despite the fact that the former got a pair in the first Test and the latter a non-specialist. 

And what a way the duo returned captains faith. 

They did similarly in Cape Town (a 153-run stand) just before coming over to Bangladesh. But on Friday, the situation was tougher and demanding too. 

With energy-sapping conditions taking a toll three players (Syed Rasel had to leave the field due to dehydration towards the end), Jaffer and Karthik showed a lot of character and spirit to lay the foundation for a potential Indian win. 

Karthik was a braveheart, soldiering on despite the odds. He was hit on the lower abdomen by Mashrafe Mortaza, but quickly regained strength and spanked the bowler with three delectable boundaries in a single over. He then suffered a hand injury but kept his tempo going. 

He took one ball more than his partner to get to his half-century, driving Mohammed Rafique through. He celebrated the achievement with another boundary of the next ball. 

Jaffer, on the other hand, started on a cautious note, seemed determined to do justice to his place. Once he got the confidence back, he transformed into a class act, piercing the rival attack around his legs in scintillating fashion. 

Fortune favoured the brave also. Both batsmen rode strokes of luck, compounding Bangladeshs misery. Karthik was dropped by Sakib-al Hasan in second slip and survived a confident caught behind appeal before his fifty. 

Rafique botched up a simple caught and bowled chance of Jaffer, when he was batting on 42. 

Karthik was eventually helped out of the field at tea. Dravid came in and brushed the scenario with a stroke-filled 88. 

Right from the beginning, he middled his shots and even launched Mohammed Ashraful for six over long-on. His 106-run association with Jaffer came to a halt when the latter had to leave due to cramps. 

India gave rookie Delhi pacer Ishant Sharma his maiden Test cap while spinner Rajesh Pawars wait for debut continued. 

The hosts suffered a setback when Shahadat Hossain was left out due to fever and Mohammed Sharif was recalled after five years lay-off.

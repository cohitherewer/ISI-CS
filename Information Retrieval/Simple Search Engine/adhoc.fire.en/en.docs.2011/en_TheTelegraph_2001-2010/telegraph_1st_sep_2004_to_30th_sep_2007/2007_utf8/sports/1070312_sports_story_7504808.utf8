 Kalou helps Chelsea stay alive

London: Chelsea stormed back from two goals down to snatch a 3-3 draw against Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup quarter final on Sunday. Goals from Dimitar Berbatov and Hossam Ghaly and an own goal by Michael Essien gave Tottenham a 3-1 halftime lead. 

However, Frank Lampards second goal of the match and Salomon Kalous strike four minutes from time set up a replay on March 19. Manchester United and Middlesbrough must also replay after a 2-2 draw on Saturday. 

Tottenham beat Chelsea 2-1 at home earlier this season for their first league victory over their London rivals since 1987 and they will be left wondering how they did not complete a remarkable double. 

Chelsea, still missing key defender and skipper John Terry, never got to grips with their attacking trio of Berbatov, Jermain Defoe and Aaron Lennon but displayed trademark stubbornness to avoid a first domestic home defeat in open play under Jose Mourinho. 

Berbatov put Tottenham ahead after five minutes, thrashing a shot into the top right corner after superb link-up play between Lennon and Defoe. 

Chelsea responded midway through the half when midfielder Lampard applied a poked finish to deflect Michael Ballacks slashed shot across the goal. 

Essien gifted Tottenham the lead again after 28 minutes when he bundled a low Lennon cross past his keeper Petr Cech and when Ghaly steamed through a hesitant Chelsea defence to make it 3-1 after 36 minutes Tottenham looked set for the semi-finals. 

Early in the second half, Lennon and Defoe both spurned chances in quick succession to put Spurs out of sight and the visitors were made to pay the price. 

Chelsea gambled on all-out attack and their pressure paid off when Lampard grabbed his second goal when Tottenham failed to deal with a high ball into the box. 

With just four minutes remaining Chelsea striker Didier Drogba won a header on the edge of the area and Kalou smashed a first-time volley past Spurs keeper Radek Cerny. 

Both sides went for the victory in a pulsating finale with first Defoe rattling the crossbar with a ferocious shot and then Andriy Shevchenko almost sealing it for the hosts.

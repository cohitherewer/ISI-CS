The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sepp Blatter may watch Bagan-EB NFL tie

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: If everything goes right with the plans chalked up by the All India Football Federation (AIFF), the Mohun Bagan versus East Bengal tie in the second leg of the National Football League (NFL) at the Salt Lake Stadium in Calcutta could by watched by Fifa president Sepp Blatter. 

In a meeting with the NFL clubs and local organising secretaries here on Wednesday, the AIFF president Priyaranjan Das Munshi said the Fifa boss is expected in India in March and he might watch the Calcutta derby, the date of which is yet to be fixed. 

The second phase of the NFL is likely to restart from February 17, but a proposal by the AIFF to continue playing without those footballers, who are in the camp for pre-Olympic qualifiers, has sparked off huge protests from the clubs. The AIFF bosses and the clubs sat together for hours to make the draft draw of the NFLs next phase. 

Both ONGC and Zee Sports are believed to have complained in the meeting about the standard of the grounds used for NFL ties, especially in Mumbai. The poor ground conditions, they felt, would send wrong messages to the viewers on the television and it would not help the sponsors. 

Some of the teams also complained about the standard of supervision in the just concluded matches.

Kandy: Muttiah Muralidharan became just the 

 second bowler in history to take 700 Test wickets. 

 The 35-year-old followed his figures of six for 28 

 in the first innings with a further six for 54 in the second 

 to finish with a match haul of 12 for 82, his 20th 10-wicket 

 haul in Tests. He led Sri Lanka to an innings and 193-run 

 victory over Bangladesh a 3-0 whitewash. 

The off-spinner joined retired Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne in the exclusive club with the last ball of the match when Syed Rasel tried to hit him down the ground but instead spooned it to Fervez Mahroof. 

Man-of-the-Match Muralidharan was mobbed by teammates after the final wicket, fittingly coming on his home ground. 

It is a big achievement taking 700 wickets but I think I can achieve a little bit more, Muralidharan said after the game on Saturday. 

I anyway knew I was going to get to 700 the challenge is whether I can take 1,000 Test wickets before I retire, he added. I am now thinking about playing until the next World Cup. 

Muralidharan reached the landmark with the last wicket of the match, sparking wild celebrations in the bowlers hometown stadium. 

His final wicket dismissed Bangladesh for 176 and secured Sri Lanka a 3-0 whitewash. 

Muralidharan is chasing Warnes 708-wicket world-record tally, a milestone he looks likely to pass during Sri Lankas two-Test tour of Australia in November.

 COMPILED BY MOHANDAS MENON

You cant predict what the wickets will be like so I dont know whether I will break the world record in Australia, Muralidharan said. 

In any case, I am more focused on going to Australia and winning the series than breaking the record. 

A veteran of 113 Tests, Sri Lankas talismanic off-spinner needed just 12 matches to go from 600 to 700 wickets. 

Muralidharans career has been plagued by controversy over the legality of his bowling action since he was no-balled for throwing in Melbourne by umpire Darryl Hair in 1995. 

Doubts still persist in some quarters, despite extensive biomechanical testing determining that his action is legal according to current regulations which permit a 15-degree elbow bend. 

I didnt believe that I could reach the milestone here, but when it came I was very happy to complete that at my home ground, he said. 

We have never won a Test match in Australia and one of my goals is to win a game there before I retire. Its a tough challenge, but this could be my last Test series there and I am keen to make that happen. 

I am not worried about what people would say. People can say whatever they want, but we are going to win there and our focus will be on that. 

Saturdays result made Sri Lanka just the third side in history to win every Test in a three-Test series by more than an innings, joining England against the West Indies in 1928 and India against Sri Lanka in 1994. 

 Muralidharan finished with 12 wickets for the Test, 

 and 26 for the series, winning Man of the Series award.

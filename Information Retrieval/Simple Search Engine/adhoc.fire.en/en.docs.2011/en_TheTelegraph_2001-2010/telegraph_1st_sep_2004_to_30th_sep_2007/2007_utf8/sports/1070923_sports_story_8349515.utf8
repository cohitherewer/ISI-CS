 Gasquet to face Vliegen

A CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai: Inclement weather delayed the start of the opening day qualifiers of the $416,000 Kingfisher Airlines Tennis Open at the Cricket Club of India (CCI) on Saturday. As a result of persistent drizzle, none of the first-round qualifiers scheduled on Saturday could be completed most couldnt even begin. 

They will be played on Sunday but the weather looks bleak as the unrelenting rains have cast a wet blanket over the city. Even a celebrity match featuring Saif Ali Khan and top seed Richard Gasquet scheduled for the afternoon had to be called off. 

Last year, the singles and doubles final could not be held on the concluding Saturday because of rains and could only be completed on Sunday. 

Top seed Gasquet of France (world No 14) has been drawn to face Kristoff Vliegen (Belgium, 80) in the opening round while second seed Lleyton Hewitt of Australia (21) is scheduled to take on a qualifier at the bottom of the draw.

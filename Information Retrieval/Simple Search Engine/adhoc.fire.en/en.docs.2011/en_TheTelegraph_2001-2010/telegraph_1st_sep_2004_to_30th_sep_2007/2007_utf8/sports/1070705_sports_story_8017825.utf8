The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We have to start from scratch

A STAFF REPORTER

 Jhulan Goswami 

Calcutta: The news of CABs recognition of state womens cricket has not yet been conveyed to her officially yet Air-India star Jhulan Goswami, who is all set to don Bengal colours in the national meet from this season, has set her targets straight. 

Realistically, a fourth-place finish in the national tournament is what we should aim for, the India vice-captain, who has been representing Air India since 2000, said. 

For the record, Railways are the national champions while Maharashtra are the runners-up. 

Bengal didnt participate in last years national meet conducted by the BCCI for the first time after taking over the Womens Cricket Association of India (WCAI) as the womens wing was not approved by the Cricket Association of Bengal. 

We are very much behind. We have to start from the scratch, Jhulan, who is touted as the fastest women bowler in the world having touched 120kmph, said. But thats not a drawback. We have promising players like Priyanka Roy (leg-spinner) and Beas Sarkar (allrounder) who have represented India. Theres also promising youngsters like Ananya Mitra (wicketkeeper and opener) and Riya Chowdhury. We just need some time to combine as a team. Perhaps the squad will be announced after the monsoon gets over and we have time till October for the inter-state meet. 

Having led India for 10 overs after Mithali Raj had to sit out due to an injury during Indias England tour last year, Jhulan says given a chance she wont mind leading the side. But she added thats not her priority. 

It will be a responsibility though, but winning matches, not captaining, is my priority. I would have no hassles playing under Rituparna (Roy) who led Bengal previously

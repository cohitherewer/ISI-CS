 New Delhi: Indian pugilists put up a commendable show to bag one silver and four bronze medals at the Ahmat Comert Cup International Championship held from May 8 to 14 in Istanbul. 

 While the mens team clinched two bronze, the women won one silver and two bronze. Olympian Diwakar Prasad (57kg) and Sanjay Kolte (48kg) bagged bronze medals.

 Mandakini Chanu won silver in the 48kg category while Renu and Aswathi Mol, who claimed bronze in the 75kg and 70kg categories, respectively. 

 Monte Carlo: The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has banned Russian runner Lyubov Denisova from competition for two years after she failed a doping test.

 Denisova, a two-time Los Angeles Marathon winner who set a course record at the Honolulu Marathon in December, tested positive for prostanozol and testosterone in a March 20 sample collected out-of-competition, the IAAF said.

 The ineligibility period began April 27 and will run to April 26, 2009, the IAAF said in a posting on its website. The IAAF also disqualified all results from March 20, 2007. 

 Eindhoven: PSV Eindhoven has turned down the opportunity to sign China left back Sun Xiang.

 The 25-year-old Sun moved to the Dutch champion in January on loan for the second half of the season. The club had an option to sign him permanently for three years but chose not to take it, PSV spokesman Stan Valckx said Tuesday.

 Sun, who had joined PSV from Shanghai club Shenhua SVA, was in Bangkok on Tuesday preparing for a friendly international against Thailand.

 Paris: Uefa president Michel Platini has said he wants two more referees in each soccer match to reduce the number of controversial decisions.

 My idea is to increase the number of referees, Platini told a French magazine. Refereeing with three people is obsolete. Three referees cant see everything.

 In addition to the referee and the two linesmen, Platini wants two more officials who would stay next to the goals and could monitor what happens in the penalty areas.

 I propose two more referees, who would be over 45 and would not have to run because they would stay next to the goals, the former France playmaker said.

 Platini said he was against the use of electronic devices and video to assist referees.

 Zurich: Fifa president Sepp Blatter has asked the Spanish authorities involved in the Operation Puerto doping investigation to formally state whether any soccer players were implicated in the case.

 Speaking at a media briefing on Tuesday, Blatter said: We know that cycling is a part of this investigation but we want to know who else is involved, said Blatter.

 Title for Ashok

Gurgaon: Ashok Kumar minimised errors on a humid day to maintain his lead and clinch the Colorplus Open golf title on Sunday. 

Ashok carded his fourth straight round in the 60s, with a three-under 69 that saw him aggregate 18-under 270 and beat young Gaganjeet Bhullars (66) challenge by two shots. 

Bhullar, who shot a bogey-free final round, was 16-under after two rounds 66 each. 

Digvijay Singh (69), who started off in an impressive manner, was done in by three consecutive bogeys from 12th to 14th which took the sting away from his challenge. He ended third at 14-under, while seasoned campaigners Gaurav Ghei (69) and S.S.P. Chowrasia (69) tied for fourth 13-under. 

Mukesh Kumar shot a final round of 68 and climbed to sixth place. 

It was the fifth title of the season for Ashok, who had already won the Indian Oil Xtra Premium Masters, Solaris Global, SRF All India Matchplay and Crompton Greaves Open. (PTI)

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Former Test and Mumbai player Lalchand Rajput has been appointed the manager of the Indian team for the ICC World Twenty20 meet to be held in South Africa next month. 

Rajput, currently, is the coach of India under-19 team. 

Rajputs appointment, however, is only an interim one as BCCI will soon issue an advertisement for appointing a manager, according to board vice president Rajeev Shukla. 

The current manager Chandu Borde will continue till the end of the England tour. 

Asked when exactly the new manager will take charge, Shukla said: We will make the appointment soon after we get a suitable candidate. 

The BCCI office bearers, who met in the capital on Wednesday, also approved the plan to set up another National Cricket Academy in Bangalore. 

For this project, we have applied to the Government of Karnataka and have been given 30 acres of land for the infrastructure. 

Shukla also informed that Cricket Club of India (CCI) in Mumbai will host the Twenty20 International against Australia on October 20. 

Those who were present in the meeting were BCCI president Sharad Pawar, vice presidents Shashank Manohar, Shukla, Lalit Modi, treasurer N. Srinivasan, secretary Niranjan Shah and CAO Ratnakar Shetty.

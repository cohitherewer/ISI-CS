London: Peter Crouch scored a classic hattrick as Liverpool thumped Arsenal 4-1 at Anfield on Saturday to leap-frog the London side in the fight for third place in the Premier League. 

The big striker, making his first appearance since March 6 after surgery on a broken nose, scored after five, 35 and 81 minutes one with each foot and a header as Liverpool gained revenge for defeats in the league, FA Cup and League Cup by Arsenal earlier in the season. 

The result takes them to third place on 57 points from 31 games, two points ahead of Arsenal, who have a game in hand, and crucially in the battle for Champions League places, 10 clear of fifth-placed Bolton Wanderers. 

Later in the evening, Manchester United produced a stirring second-half Old Trafford comeback to beat Blackburn Rovers 4-1 on Saturday and stretch their Premier League lead over Chelsea to nine points. 

United deservedly trailed to a 29th-minute Matt Derbyshire goal but second-half strikes by Paul Scholes, Michael Carrick, Park Ji-sung and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer secured a seventh successive league win and piled the pressure on Chelsea. 

United, with seven games remaining, still lead on 75 points from Chelsea on 69 from a game less. 

It is becoming very tight at the bottom as Sheffield United are now only one point above the drop zone after West Ham United beat Middlesbrough 2-0 and Charlton Athletic beat Wigan Athletic 1-0, while Manchester City won 1-0 at Newcastle United to edge clear. 

Liverpools first goal came after a Alvaro Arbeloa combined neatly with Jermaine Pennant before clipping in a low cross which Crouch turned in neatly at the near post. 

Liverpool fully deserved their second as Fabio Aurelio curled in a tempting cross from the left and Crouch made a determined leap to score with a firm header. 

They got their third on the hour when Daniel Agger glanced in an Aurelio free-kick. 

Emmanuel Adebayor twice hit a post for Arsenal before William Gallas pulled one back in the 73rd minute. 

However, it was Crouch who had the last word when he showed deft control in the box before blasting the goal that secured the first club hat-trick of his career. (Agencies)

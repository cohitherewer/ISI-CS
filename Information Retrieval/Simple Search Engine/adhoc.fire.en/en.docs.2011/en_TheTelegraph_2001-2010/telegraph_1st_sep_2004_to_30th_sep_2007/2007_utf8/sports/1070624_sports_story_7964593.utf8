 Its different: Mauresmo

SUE MOTT

The French have a habit of sending us shocking women to win Wimbledon. Perhaps we should rephrase that. The French have a habit of sending us women to win Wimbledon who have the capacity to shock. 

Mauresmo won last year, and we were shocked. Even during the final we were shocked. There she was, typically, trailing by a set having lost her opening service game, awash with jitters, against little Justine Henin, buzzing like a chainsaw, when suddenly she regained her composure. Now Mauresmo regaining composure in major moments has been as rare as sightings of chavs in the Royal Box. 

I am not carrying anything any more, she said, meaning the burden of not winning. I love it. At Wimbledon, they make you feel like a reigning champion. Really. They say: This is our ladies champion. 

That is how they welcome you. That is how they like to treat you. It actually feels pretty good. Like a queen? Well, she suddenly seems uncomfortable. Well, just as good. Perhaps she is not wishing to usurp Her Majestys role, or perhaps she is remembering that a queens head in France could end up in a basket, but you can see what people mean about her acute sensitivities. 

It is only here at Wimbledon they make you feel like this. The tradition is still going. You really feel that something is different here. 

The weight of the history at this special club. Even years before I won, I always felt something different in the atmosphere. 

Highly intelligent and ineffably nice, the 27-year-old Frenchwoman is significantly unlike many of her more obviously rampantly ambitious peers. 

I am just not a conflict person. Im not going to yell at somebody. Im not going to fight with somebody unless they push me very hard. Very rarely Im going to say No! or be rude. 

 And then its like a lot 

 of people who are quiet and nice, then its... 

 she summoned a Gallic snap of the fingers to denote an outburst 

 of temper. When it comes out, it can be very powerful 

 and very dramatic.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav comeback didnt surprise Ian

 - Rapprochement between Former India captain and iconic Aussie 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Nottingham: Six 

 years ago, during the sensational India-Australia Test at 

 the Eden, Ian Chappell and Sourav Ganguly had a slanging 

 match of sorts through the print media. 

In more recent times, the iconic Ian was perceived as somebody not very favourably disposed towards Sourav. Perhaps, vice-versa as well. 

On Friday, the delayed start to the second Test gave Ian (on assignment for TV) and Sourav the opportunity to interact at Trent Bridge. 

They spoke for around five minutes and, going by their body language, the one-time (and aggressive) captains seemed to enjoy each others company. 

 We talked about life in 

 general... Nothing serious, Ian told The Telegraph. 

 Clearly, then, brother Greg didnt figure in that tete-a-tete. 

Asked whether hed been surprised by Souravs successful comeback, last December, Ian replied: Before he did, Id said much would depend on his hunger... Hes a good player and, so, I didnt get surprised... 

Ian added: Even good players have, at some stage in their careers, got a kick up their backsides... Theyve come back better cricketers... Same with Sourav. 

Did he find Sourav more relaxed given that he wasnt the captain? Well, he looked relaxed... Looked fine... Not that, in my opinion, he was uptight when he was the captain... 

 The Ian-Sourav rapprochement is over. 

 Now, its to be seen whether theres a one-on-one 

 between Sourav and controversial former coach Greg when 

 the Indians tour Australia from end-December.

 2nd post-mortem doubtful

Stewart Tendler

The body of Bob Woolmer, the Pakistan coach at the centre of a murder investigation, has been embalmed before any chance of a second post-mortem examination. 

Senior British pathologists said on Tuesday that embalming could make a re-examination difficult, especially if there was a risk that the first one was mishandled. 

Woolmers body was taken from the Kingston public hospital three hours after a post-mortem examination was carried out two weeks ago. It was moved to a Kingston funeral parlour and embalmed an hour later. It is still there. In Britain a body is not released for embalming by a coroner until investigations are complete. 

Winston Roman, who runs the funeral home in Kingston, confirmed on Tuesday that Woolmers body had been embalmed so that it could be sent to his family in South Africa. He said that the police had not objected to embalming, which he said would not preclude a re-examination. 

Meanwhile, a team of Scotland Yard detectives and two Interpol staff have arrived to assist Jamaican police in the investigation. 

The four-member team, led by superintendent John Sweeney of Londons Homicide and Serious Crime Command were briefed by the local police on Tuesday.

Southampton: India face an uphill task after maiden centuries from Alastair Cook and Ian Bell propelled England to a commanding total of 288 for two in the first one-dayer of the Natwest Cricket Series on Tuesday. 

Opener Cook made a defiant 102 while Bell hit an aggressive 126 not out as the hosts exposed the inexperience of the Indian attack in the day-night encounter at Rose Bowl. 

Cook and Bell put on 178 runs for the second wicket after the early dismissal of Matt Prior, promoted as opener. 

Cook batted 126 balls and struck eight fours before being played on while trying to accelerate. 

Bell, who struggled with the bat in the Test series, redeemed himself with an attacking knock, scoring his century at a run-a-ball pace before stepping up the gas in the closing overs. 

Later Kevin Pietersen hit 33 off only 25 balls. 

The unbroken third-wicket stand between Bell and Pietersen was worth 67 runs while 78 came off the last 10 overs. 

All Indian bowlers were expensive. 

Zaheer Khan, whose first eight overs had decent figures of one for 33, went for 16 runs in the last two overs. Ajit Agarkar, the other seasoned specialist seamer, conceded 65 without any returns. 

R.P. Singh and Sourav Ganguly too went for five runs an over. 

And with part timers Sachin Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh too costing heavily, captain Rahul Dravid was wondering if he was right in inserting England in. 

Dravid seemed to have done the right thing by asking England to bat as Prior departed in the 11th over with 43 on the board. 

But Cook and Bell combined wonderfully well to frustrate the Indian attack. The pair scored only 58 runs by way of boundaries as they focussed on finding the gaps, rotating the strike and running hard between wickets. 

Twentythree-year-old Cook, who scored his first Test hundred against India on debut in Nagpur last year, brought up his maiden one-day hundred against the same opponents in only his sixth one-day International. 

The pair especially thrived in the middle overs when Indias part timers Sachin and Yuvraj were operating along with leg spinner Piyush Chawla. 

Cook began carefully helping himself to a couple of boundaries only when Ajit Agarkar over-pitched it or drifted onto his pads. 

However, once he had Bell for company, he began to express himself more freely, on driving R.P. and sweeping Chawla to reach his 50 off 74 balls with four fours. 

Once he was past his fifty, Cook started enjoying his exchanges with the Indian spinners in the middle-overs making lovely use of his feet. 

He cut Yuvraj to the point boundary before driving Zaheer past mid-wicket. A lovely short arm pull off R.P. took him to 99. 

Cook completed his hundred with a single to cover in the 40th over of the innings. His 100 came off 122 balls and he struck 8 delightful boundaries. 

He was out in the 42nd over when he was bowled off an inside edge to R.P. 

Bell made a confident start driving R.P. on the rise to the cover boundary. 

He wasnt shy of going over the top either, depositing Sourav over mid-wicket and pulling Sachin high over deep square leg. 

And when Chawla came on to bowl, he charged down the wicket and hit him for a six to long-off. 

Another glance to the fine leg boundary off Sachin gave him his half-century.

India were limping at 112 for six at the end of 36 overs, with Dinesh Karthik (6) and Ajit Agarkar (4) at the crease. The Indians still need 177 runs in 14 overs. Captain Rahul Dravid scored 46. For England, James Anderson bagged three wickets.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Alvito happy to do a Messi 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Alvitos DCunhas target is to help East Bengal win all trophies 

Calcutta: The goal Alvito DCunha scored against Mohammedan Sporting on Tuesday East Bengals fifth in the 6-2 win pleased the midfielder no end. 

He capped a magical run, which started inside his own half, with a precise left-footed angular grounder. 

Whenever I watched (Lionel) Messi weaving his way past several defenders and scoring for Barcelona, I wanted to score a goal like that. So this was a dream come true for me, DCunha told The Telegraph on Tuesday evening. 

This was not his best goal, though. My goal in the ASEAN Club Championship final was a very good effort also, said Alvito, who played his first match this season on Tuesday. 

His team may have won 6-2, but Tuesdays performance didnt fully please the senior pro. We need to work harder before the match against Mohun Bagan we have to be more disciplined in defence. 

His target for the season: try and score in every match and help East Bengal win all trophies. 

Subrata Bhattacharya said Mohammedan Sporting didnt play as badly as the scoreline suggested. Our second goal was the turning point Then, when we scored two quick goals early in the second half, they got demoralised, said the East Bengal coach. 

Shabbir Ali rued the injury suffered by M. Sayju eight minutes before half-time. His absence made a difference Also, the two second-half goals we conceded were crucial, said the Mohammedan Sporting coach. 

He obviously missed foreign players. Well sign up two foreigners before the next match (against Calcutta Port Trust), said Shabbir.

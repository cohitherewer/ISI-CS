 Bangla to step up security

Dhaka: Bangladesh will step up security when India visit next month to play two Tests and three one-day Internationals, the BCB said on Sunday. 

Law enforcement agencies including the elite force Rapid Action Battalion will look after the security matters for the touring side whose first match is a one-dayer in Dhaka on May 10. 

I have talked to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Niranjan Shah on Saturday and assured him of VVIP security for the team, said Mahmudur Rahman, chief executive officer of the BCB. (Reuters)

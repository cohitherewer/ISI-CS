 Owais Shah is no fading star

Simon Hughes

The World Cup has given English cricket a bad name: it suggests that the only virtuoso talent we possess was nurtured overseas (Kevin Pietersen). Englands batting was mired in mediocrity (Pietersen apart) and yet, as soon as you dip into the County scene, you realise the shires are laden with prodigious home-grown talent. 

One such, now languishing in the second division of the LV County Championship, is Middlesexs Owais Shah. Here was a precocious lad who was blooded early (County debut at age 17), captained England Under-19s, made an assured one-day International debut in 2001 and was expected to be a mainstay of the senior XI by the age of 24. 

A year ago in India, on his Test debut, he made an accomplished 88. He has been largely ignored since then, although he has been named in Englands 25-strong performance squad. 

On Wednesday, the 28-year-old-Shah who should have the world at his feet emerged to bat at Lords against Northamptonshire in front of a paltry collection of pensioners and schoolkids. Anyone present would have been immediately struck by his quality. 

There was the bristling stance, bat held aloft, jaw jutting forwards, limbs ready to pounce. There was the resolute block followed by the confident flourish and the jaunty walk. After a couple of thickish edges off the bustling South African fast bowler Johannes van der Wath, and a neat tickle for two, there were crackling off drives, dismissive pulls and thumping cuts. He made batting on a tricky early-season surface against decent bowling look easy. 

There have been many beneficiaries of the Duncan Fletcher regime. Shah was not one of them. While appreciating Shahs batting skill, Fletcher had reservations about his other dimensions particularly fielding. Shah remains the holder of a dubious record the highest score (88) by an England player who has played only one Test. 

The circumstances of his subsequent absence from the Test arena are slightly different but no less disturbing. Marcus Trescothick, who was absent in India, returned for the first Test of last summer. Shah was told he was the one to miss out, and that was it. No more contact from the England hierarchy, no words of encouragement or explanations. Just deafening silence. 

You might expect that if the player in question had been out of his depth. But, in a must-win Test, Shah who had been drafted in at the 11th hour and hadnt batted for nearly a month was thrust in at No. 3 and dominated the second-wicket stand of 178 with Andrew Strauss. 

It was an eventful innings notable for its range of strokes and retirement with cramp on a sweltering day in Mumbai. He made 38 in the second innings but, after a couple of low scores in the one-dayers, wasnt seen in an England shirt again. 

He shakes his head at the lack of communication since and says he hopes things change. He has spent the winter with the Academy in Perth, improving all aspects of his game, and has a good relationship with new England coach Peter Moores. 

He has begun the season strongly, with a pulsating 160 against Somerset, though his mastery on Wednesday ended prematurely on 41 with a slightly overambitious shot. But he was in commanding residence again and cuts an imposing six-foot figure which he matches with his seasons ambition. 

Its the same as its been for the last 10 years to play for England, he says. Ill try to do my absolute best for Middlesex every day and if an international call comes along, thats target achieved.

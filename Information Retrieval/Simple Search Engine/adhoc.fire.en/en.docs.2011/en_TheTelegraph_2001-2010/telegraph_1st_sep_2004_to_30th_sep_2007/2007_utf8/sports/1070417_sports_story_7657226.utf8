 England, SA chase last semi-final berth

Bridgetown: The South Africans call it a World Cup quarter final. England have another chance they didnt expect. 

Struggling through in the Super Eight, they meet at the Kensington Oval on Tuesday chasing the last place in the semi-finals. With Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka already through to the last four, England and South Africa must slug it out. South Africa will qualify if they beat England, although England could still fail to qualify even with a victory. 

Tuesdays game is South Africas last in the Super Eight, while England must still play the West Indies in the final match before the semi-finals. 

South Africa, imperious-looking at the start of the tournament, have stuttered, inexplicably losing to Bangladesh in Guyana and then beaten by New Zealand in Grenada on Saturday. 

Englands World Cup campaign has lurched from disappointment to crisis. They have beaten Bangladesh and Ireland, losing to Sri Lanka and Australia. The South Africans have lost to Bangladesh and New Zealand, beating Sri Lanka, Ireland and the West Indies. 

Tuesdays match promises to be a torrid seam-bowling confrontation on a hard and dry Kensington Oval wicket that has been relaid and offers occasionally dramatic bounce and pace. 

Makhaya Ntini, Shaun Pollock and the aggressive Andre Nel will face off against the English pace attack of James Anderson, Sajid Mahmood and Andrew Flintoff. 

The match will also feature Englands South African-raised Kevin Pietersen, the best one-day International batsman in the world at the moment, coming up against a South Africa team that has always reserved special abuse for him. 

Its probably just a switch inside me that gets me going. It is something that triggers inside me that makes me want to give it an extra special go, he told reporters on Sunday. 

Pietersen and Proteas skipper Graeme Smith have both made derogatory comments about each other in the past but the England batsman wants to avoid a new feud. 

Its a closed chapter now, the game on Tuesday is not about me and its not about Graeme Smith, Pietersen said. What has been said has been said. Its done and dusted. We are grown adults now. 

Andrew Flintoff, who has struggled throughout the World Cup, was taken to hospital for blood tests for glandular fever. But he was diagnosed with a chest infection and took part in net practice, albeit not at full pace.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bagan camp in Durgapur

A STAFF REPORTER

 Mohun Bagan coach Carlos Roberto Pereira gets updates from his assistant Satyajit Chatterjee on arrival in Calcutta on Friday. A Telegraph picture 

Calcutta: It was a long journey from the shores of Brazil to the Maidan, but when Carlos Roberto Pereira finally arrived for the press conference on a damp Friday evening, he looked fresh. 

Gone was the hesitation of the man who last season failed to win anything more than the local league with East Bengal. Instead the new Mohun Bagan coach appeared confident enough to declare that he aims to win all the trophies this season, nothing less. 

However, the man recruited by the green-and-maroon brigade for his sheer technical knowledge, seems to have found the bane of Indian football. 

In India, players dont know how to play off the ball, said the 61-year-old in broken English. 

With the ball, they are decent enough, but without it, they appear totally at a loss, Pereira said, adding: My endeavour would be to address this issue. 

And the veteran coach will get 12 days to do it before the season starts. 

We will hold our residential camp from July 16-28 in Durgapur. I would have loved a few more days, but it cant be helped. 

I will go to Durgapur next week to put the infrastructure in place, he said when asked why the camp could not be started sooner. 

Pereira admitted that releasing three defenders for the national camp would seriously hamper his plans. 

We cannot complain about it. What I need to do is to create a pool to see us through. My focus wont just be on the XI 

The Mohun Bagan coach appeared satisfied with the duration of his contract. 

A year is good enough. If I dont deliver, we part ways. If I am successful, the contract can always be extended by two-three years. 

Even though he didnt find time to speak to captain Bhaichung Bhutia, Pereira had spoken to Jose Barreto. 

I spoke to him a couple of times in Brazil But we didnt meet as he resides far away from my place. 

I need to start training as soon as possible If weather permits, I will arrange training sessions in the afternoon as well. 

Once bitten, Pereira knows he has no time to relax.

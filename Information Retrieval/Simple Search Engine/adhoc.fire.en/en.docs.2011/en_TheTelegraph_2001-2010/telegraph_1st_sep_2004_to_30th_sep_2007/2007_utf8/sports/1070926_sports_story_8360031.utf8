 India to host Classic for first time

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Johnnie Walker Classic will be held in India for the first time next year, organisers said on Tuesday. 

The $2.5 million event, won by South Africas Anton Haig in Phuket this year, will take place at the DLF Golf and Country Club on an Arnold Palmer-designed course in New Delhi from February 28 to March 2, according to information received here. 

World No. 12 Vijai Singh will headline the event. It will be his fourth appearance in the tournament. The Fijian is a former US Masters and US PGA champion. 

Past winners include Tiger Woods, Nick Faldo, Greg Norman, Fred Couples, Ernie Els, Ian Woosnam, Retief Goosen and Adam Scott. 

I began my professional career in Asia so I am excited to be returning to my old stamping ground for the Johnnie Walker Classic next year, said 44-year-old Singh.

 Sanias service action 

 needs to be modified

 - She has proved shes no media-hyped soap bubble 

SERVE amp; VOLLEY 

 Naresh Kumar 

 It was an exhilarating experience to watch Sanias string of victories over the last fortnight. She ploughed through five women, ranked from No. 17 to No. 25, confirming her significant improvement and emphatically setting up a higher base to challenge the top 20. One was optimistic about Sanias chances against the top-seeded Maria Sharapova in the Acura Classic, specially since Sharapova was recovering from a shoulder problem and was considerably match rusty. 

But Sharapova, with a support patch on her shoulder blade and abbreviated swing, served at full power and showed no signs of being rusty. Helped by two double faults and a poor second serve by Sania, Sharapova broke Sanias opening serve, flew out of the blocks in a flash, and was unstoppable after that. 

The absence of power, speed, accuracy and consistency are the chasms Sania has to bridge to get to the top ten. The service is a weapon that should enable you to finish the point or dictate the rally. Sharapova was able to attack Sanias poor serve and put her on the defensive. 

Sania produced some great shots in the few rallies that took place but Sharapova dictated the tune and at no point was Sania in control of the game. Her earlier victories, however, highlight the commendable progress she has made in terms of strength and physical fitness. She is moving better and her biceps are clearly defined. 

Sanias service is an area of concern and, without significant improvement, improving her rankings as well as staying there, will be almost impossible. A good toss, balance, a swing-oriented service action and smooth transfer of weight at the moment of impact are the foundations of a good serve. 

Sanias service action seems awkward, laboured and not smooth. At the moment of impact, her right leg is stretched almost parallel to the baseline, and does not move forward, thus losing the advantage of weight transfer, and more significantly balance. Sanias service action needs to be modified. It is a task which, at this stage of her career, is difficult to implement, but by no means impossible. 

With perseverance and application Sania has already achieved a ranking of 30, which is a blessing, specially with the US Open just a couple of weeks away. She will take her place amongst the 32 seeds and this will ensure that she does not play against any one of the top 31 players till the third round. 

In spite of the shortcomings in her serve, Sania has beaten a string of top notch players. Can you imagine what she could achieve with a good serve to back up her baseline game which is amongst the best in the world? 

Difficult times and more hard work lie ahead of Sania if she is to retain her focus to get into the top ten. Getting there is just one of the tasks, but staying there is much more difficult. Higher rankings mean that you have to play more matches, train even harder and stay injury free. 

Ramesh Krishnan summed it up accurately, The real test starts now. It will get tougher by the week. She has to be injury free to defend points. Players at that level are extremely competitive and dont give an inch. 

Sania has proved that she is no media-hyped soap-bubble. It is time to give her her due and in no smaller measure praise her family for achieving what seemed impossible.

 Manjural dies in accident

Dhaka: Bangladesh left-arm spinner Manjural Islam (Rana) died in a road accident near Khulna town on Friday, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said. 

Another first-class cricketer Sajjadul Hasan (28) was also killed in the same accident, which occurred when a motorbike ridden by Manjural hit railings on a bridge at Kartikdanga, 380 km southwest of Dhaka. 

They were travelling to a nearby town after a domestic match at their Khulna home town, police said. 

Manjural, 23, made his one-day International debut against England in Chittagong in November 2003 and took 23 wickets in 25 matches. He also claimed five wickets from six Tests after his debut against Zimbabwe (Harare, February 2004).

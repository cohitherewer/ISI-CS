 Mourinho tears over Chelsea departure

 Jose Mourinho 

Jose Mourinho has paid tribute to the relationship of love he had with Chelseas players and supporters and admitted that he cried over his sudden departure from the club. 

Mourinhos three years in charge at Stamford Bridge ended in abrupt fashion last week following a rift with owner Roman Abramovich and the club hierarchy. 

Yes, I cried, he said in a Portuguese newspaper interview. I tend to say that I have a family at home and another at work. Ive always had a relationship of love with the players and fans. I wont forget them and they wont forget me. 

During Mourinhos reign Chelsea were never beaten in any of their 42 home league matches and fans chanted their former managers name during their defeat to Manchester United on Sunday. 

Mourinho said: The fans never left Stamford Bridge crying, because we never lost. We beat the record and the day they lose a match at home they will remember they were three years without losing a single league game there. 

Here (England), the culture is not one of change. Sir Alex Ferguson was at Manchester United a lot of years without winning titles, I think it was three years in a row, and he continues in his job. (Arsene) Wengers already in his third year without winning titles and continues in his work. 

If it were for the fans Id have a contract for 20 years. Here the culture is different. People like me and there is an excellent relationship. 

Mourinho stood by his famous remarks on arrival at Chelsea in 2004, that he was a special one, having just led Porto to triumph in the Champions League. The two Premier League titles and three domestic Cups he won in England have done nothing to alter that opinion. 

I took a chance in saying that I was special, but I think there are now a lot of people who would sign up to that, Mourinho said. 

I think Im still special. I achieved good things and it was a fantastic period in my career. Ill try to forget the bad things and remember the good ones, which are endless.

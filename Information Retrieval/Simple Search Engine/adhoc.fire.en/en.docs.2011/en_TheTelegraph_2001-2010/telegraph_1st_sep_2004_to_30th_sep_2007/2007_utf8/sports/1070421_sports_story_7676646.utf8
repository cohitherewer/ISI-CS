The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The Shastri mantra

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai: Former captain Ravi Shastri, who has been appointed cricket manager for the tour of Bangladesh, was present during Fridays selection committee meeting here. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, he made quite a few points, which included the following: 

 With 45 ODIs and 15 Tests in the next 12 months, its important to have fresh faces and legs 

 Jaded players are a liability 

 Players must be rotated from a pool of about 25 

 Seniors like Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly be given a break, allowing opportunities for younger players 

 A break will help Sachin and Sourav as, after the World Cup debacle, the heat is on them 

 Its easier to try out youngsters in Bangladesh rather than in ODIs against South Africa in Ireland and on the tour of England 

 Its time the youngsters took responsibility and allowed Sachin and Sourav to bat freely 

 Wasim Akrams suggestion that the new-ball bowlers increase their level of endurance instead of just focusing on strengthening muscles be followed 

Note: Shastri suggested Dinesh Mongias recall and went along with captain Rahul Dravids views on Virender Sehwag.

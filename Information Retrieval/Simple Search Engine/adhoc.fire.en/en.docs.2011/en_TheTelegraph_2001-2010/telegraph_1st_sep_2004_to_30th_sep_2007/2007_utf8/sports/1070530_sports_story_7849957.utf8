 Ryan heralds birth of a new England

Simon Briggs

 Ryan Sidebottom 

After celebrating a victory that occupied little more than two full days playing time, Kevin Pietersen spoke last night of Englands determination to regain the aura they mislaid during a harrowing winter campaign. 

Pietersen was perhaps the only Englishman who lived up to expectations during both the Ashes and the World Cup. But as he explained on Monday, there was scant satisfaction to be had from runs made in defeat. It was a hard winter, and there wasnt much enjoyment, Pietersen said. So its great to be playing in a series where there are a lot of laughs and everybody can see us enjoying ourselves again. Just to get a win under the belt was a huge plus for us. 

The word ruthless has been used around the dressing-room quite a bit in the three of four weeks since Peter Moores arrived. We want to make the opposition scared of playing this new England team. 

I know weve got a lot of games to play and a lot better opposition to come up against, but you still have to go out there and perform. 

The personnel may not have changed greatly in the new England that Pietersen describes, but some attitudes have certainly been revised. If there was a key moment in this game, it was not so much the no-ball call that reprieved Pietersen on 20, but the decision to return Ryan Sidebottom to the Test side six years after his last appearance. 

It is hard to imagine that happening under Duncan Fletcher. 

Fletcher had a number of idees fixes, many of which were entirely sensible. But his belief that Test success starts at 85mph did exclude a number of worthy county seam and swing bowlers from consideration. Sidebottom showed that Matthew Hoggard is not the only exception to this dogmatic rule. 

Pace is great, said Michael Vaughan Monday night, as long as youve got someone bowling 90mph in the right areas. We all know that pace bowled both sides of the wicket is quite nice to face. You cant really beat the old workhorse who puts it there and thereabouts. That kind of bowling gives you control and allows you to dictate some of the game. There are certain conditions where it doesnt suit but if the ball is landing in the right area you can always set fields to stop the opposition scoring. 

Sidebottoms performance should give new hope to the hundred or so professionals toiling away in the shires, hoping that a string of runs or wickets could catapult them into the lucky few with central contracts and second houses in the Caribbean. 

As Vaughan put it: Im sure there are a number of good bowlers and good batsmen out there in county cricket who could step up to Test match cricket and do very well. 

Ryan showed this week that he can handle the pressure. I think hes going to be a real threat to all batsmen if he can reproduce that kind of performance on a regular basis. 

Vaughan also backed his other seamers, Steve Harmison and Liam Plunkett, to keep improving as this Test series goes on. When the wicket flattened out today we saw what Steve Harmison does best, Vaughan said. 

He was getting back to what he can be bowling 90mph with bounce and putting batsmen under pressure when the ball is not swinging. Hopefully that spell down the hill will just be the tonic that gives him confidence going to Old Trafford. Liam would have liked to be more consistent but he always bowls wicket-taking deliveries and that is a huge skill to have.

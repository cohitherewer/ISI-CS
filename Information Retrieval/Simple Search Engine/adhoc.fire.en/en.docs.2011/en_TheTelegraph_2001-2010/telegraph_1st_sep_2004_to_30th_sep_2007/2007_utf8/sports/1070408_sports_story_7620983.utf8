Malik said before his session with the PCBs inquiry committee probing into the teams World Cup debacle that he challenged Sarfraz to prove his allegations that Pakistan had deliberately lost in the West Indies. 

It is an hold habit of Sarfraz to make such allegations against anybody. I challenge him to a debate I am ready to answer all allegations he has made against me. Otherwise, I will sue him for his remarks, said the allrounder. 

Just the other day, former captain Imran Khan had promised to take Sarfraz to court for making unsubstantiated comments. 

Sarfraz said he would welcome any move by Malik to sue him.

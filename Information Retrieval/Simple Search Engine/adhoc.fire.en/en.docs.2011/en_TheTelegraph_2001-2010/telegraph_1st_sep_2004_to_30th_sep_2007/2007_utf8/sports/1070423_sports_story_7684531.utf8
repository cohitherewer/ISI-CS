The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 United drop two points vs Boro

JAMES MOSSOP 

A colossal error by the men on the United bench may have cost them the Premiership title they covet intensely. 

United were a goal up, courtesy Kieran Richardsons third-minute strike, and appeared to be handling Middlesbrough comfortably when Rio Ferdinand signalled to Sir Alex Ferguson and coach Carlos Quieroz that his groin was troubling him. 

He could not run, but they left him on for fully five minutes and in that period Middlesbrough scored an unlikely equaliser (as reported in Sundays Late City edition). As Mark Viduka moved in front of Wes Brown to head in Stewart Downings left-wing cross, Ferdinand was unable to take up a position. He should have been substituted. 

Ferguson confirmed that Ferdinand will be out for at least two weeks, missing Tuesdays Champions League semi-final first leg against AC Milan. But, perhaps most damaging of all, he and everyone concerned at Old Trafford may look upon those minutes of time added-on at the end of the first half as the moments when the title was lost. 

They might even have lost had referee Peter Walton given a last-minute penalty when Middlesbroughs Korean, Dong Gook Lee, went down as John Shea challenged.

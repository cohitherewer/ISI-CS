 2011 Cup could be trimmed: Speed

Melbourne: The next edition of the World Cup to be held in the subcontinent in 2011 could be reduced to 40 days, said ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed. 

Speed told an Australian daily: I think next time we will stick with the 16-team format but I would hope we can save a week from the tournament. 

This year, we lost two days because of Easter. The West Indian countries are strongly Christian and they did not want us to play on Good Friday. I can see the tournament coming back to 40 days, which is just about right, he added. 

Speed, however, said the longer duration of the tournament was good for the publicity of the game. 

The ICC chief said he was disappointed with far too much negative comments. 

One of the other negatives is that we have not had a great number of memorable matches. Of the 20 I have been to, I can think of four or five really good games, five were not too bad and a lot of others were no-contests, he said. 

Speed also admitted that the ouster of India and Pakistan was a big blow to the tournament. A huge blow... We have seen matches where we expected India to be playing Pakistan and they were not there, so it has taken some of the shine off the World Cup, without in any way denigrating the great efforts of Ireland and Bangladesh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I am not thinking about a call-up, says Ranadeb

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Ranadeb Bose is keeping fingers crossed. He is not thinking about a national call-up and wants to concentrate on the task in hand. 

Obviously I want to play for India. But frankly, Im not going to raise expectations and put myself under pressure thinking about it. Its the selectors job. If it doesnt happen, its bound to put you down mentally So better not think about it Lets concentrate on playing for Bengal, he said after his six for 34 against Rajasthan at the Eden on Wednesday. 

The mediumpacer feels the presence of coach Paras Mhambrey has played a big role in his success this season. 

He has worked wonders. Having a bowling coach has its advantages. Im physically and mentally more fit. Im not getting tired too soon and can bowl long spells. Moreover, Im also not trying too many things just trying to get the basics right, he explained. 

The absence of Shib Shankar Paul has also played its part. 

Ive had to shoulder more responsibility. The presence of the likes of Ashok Dinda and Sourav Sarkar has also helped. We now have many plans in place If Plan A is not successful, we can try Plan B We plan for each and every batsman. It has all helped. 

Ranadeb always puts the team ahead of individual performances. What matters most is Bengals victory. That is the top priority, he said. 

He is not setting any targets either. I can always have a bad day, a bad match. A target, if not achieved, can affect you mentally. So the priority is to give the best in every match. 

Ranadeb, who hasnt been too successful with the new ball, felt it was because of his style. I think I bowl better with the old ball. It suits my style. I can use my variations better with the old ball, he said. 

The decision of the BCCI to have Kookaburra balls from next season in domestic competitions didnt seem to enthuse him. 

It would have been better if we were made to bowl with such balls in conditions as those in South Africa or Australia. Kookaburra balls would not be much effective in these prevalent conditions. 

Captain Deep Dasgupta was also all praise for the lanky seamer. 

Ranadeb has just been great this season. His form speaks for him. 

Fellow pacer Sourav Sarkar, who grabbed four wickets, stressed on the mental aspect. If you think positively, you can achieve what you want.

 I admire Hewitt a lot: Nadal

If Bart Simpson took up tennis, he would probably dress just like Lleyton Hewitt. But, despite the over-sized T-shirt, the baggy shorts and the reversed baseball cap which would not leave Hewitt looking out of place in Springfield, he has what the Australians call, a bit of the mongrel in him. 

Ignore the cartoon dress sense. A hard, spiky edge and great intensity is the real Hewitt trademark; if you examined his DNA it would confirm that he has the fist-pumping gene and the Cmon gene. He showed plenty of grit and gumption in coming from two sets down to defeat Argentinas Gaston Gaudio, a former French Open champion, to move into the third round. It was classic mongrel-like Hewitt on Thursday. 

As Britains lone representative, Tim Henman, and all nine Americans went out in the first round, it had appeared at one point as though there were going to be no native English-speakers left in the mens locker room after the Gaudio match. 

Hewitts strokes no longer have the zip and fizz that brought him the 2001 US Open title and the 2002 Wimbledon crown, but the 26-year-old former world No. 1 loves nothing more than hustling and harrying his opponent, and he did just that against Gaudio, the 2004 champion, for a 4-6, 3-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 win. 

Perhaps the real surprise was not that Hewitt won in such a way, but that it was only the fourth time in his career he had overturned a two-set deficit. 

Hewitt is not to everyones taste, but one leading player who appreciates him is Rafael Nadal. The Spaniard, himself a street-fighter of a tennis player and a projected fourth-round opponent for Hewitt, rates the Adelaide man as one of his favourites to watch. 

I admire him a lot, Nadal said. I like his game and his mentality on court. The double Roland Garros champion saw it from up close in Hamburg last month, as he dropped the first set to Hewitt before winning in three. 

That Hamburg tournament was just Hewitts second after a two-month absence with a back injury. He appears to be in better form than he was last season, when he was beaten in the fourth round here in four sets by Nadal. Hewitt next plays Finlands Jarkko Nieminen, while Nadal, after crunching Italian qualifier Flavio Cipolla 6-2, 6-1, 6-4, will meet Spaniard Albert Montanes. 

 One interesting development in the coming weeks could 

 be Hewitt hiring Tony Roche as his coach. Less than a month 

 ago Roger Federer sacked Roche, blaming the split on a breakdown 

 in communication with the two of them barely exchanging 

 a word on the practice court, but Hewitt has suggested that 

 he might formally approach his fellow-Australian after Wimbledon. 

 Hewitt has been without a full-time coach since Roger Rasheed 

 walked away just before the Australian Open after a heated 

 row.

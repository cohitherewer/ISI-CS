 Dravid eyes a perfect finish

A CORRESPONDENT

London: Rahul Dravid on Friday said that he was looking forward to signing off a great English summer in style with a perfect finish on Saturday. 

It has been set up very nicely for what has been a very good summer With the series levelled 3-3, weve everything to play for in the last game Someones written a good script, the Team India captain said. 

The boys are confident but we know weve got to play well. It was a close game at the Oval We are under no illusions It could have gone either way, as could have some of the other games in the series as well. So while we are confident, we also know that these games have been tight. The better team has won. 

Dravid, however, was happy with the performance. It definitely has been a good achievement irrespective of what happens tomorrow. There are positives we have gained from this summer. And some areas that we need to work on. 

Dravid also reflected on the teams fight back after being 1-3 down in the series. I knew we really had to fight hard We had our backs to the wall. We had to script a really good comeback. If we can win tomorrow, it will be great comeback. 

Which victory will be sweeter for the supporters the Test or the one-day series win? Winning matters, irrespective of Test or one-dayers, Dravid said. It will be hard to judge We dont win a lot of Test cricket abroad and winning in England after 21 years was a huge thing. 

The captain also heaped praise on Sourav Ganguly. Hes definitely done well. And it does help if we get early wickets. Sourav has bowled well for us in the last couple games, especially in the Power Plays. The last two games all has gone well.

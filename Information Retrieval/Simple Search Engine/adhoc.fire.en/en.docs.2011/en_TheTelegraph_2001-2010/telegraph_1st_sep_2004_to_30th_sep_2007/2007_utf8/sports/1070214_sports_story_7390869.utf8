The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Cleaned drains could have helped resumption

 - Dalmiya counters faulty infrastructure theory

 Dalmiya 

Calcutta: Jagmohan Dalmiya mentioned it was not a war of words, but did, in a way, take up the battle against Prasun Mukherjee at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. 

Proper cleaning up of the drains could have facilitated resumption of Sundays washed-out ODI, commented the former CAB president. 

Dalmiya was countering the allegation that the Eden infrastructure had not been maintained properly during his tenure which made the task of getting the ground fit for play after Thursday afternoons downpour difficult. 

Explaining the drainage system with a diagram, Dalmiya said the drains need to be cleaned regularly. Before an international match, the drains used to be cleaned up, and that process takes seven to 14 days. 

Without directly blaming his successor (Im not blaming anyone), Dalmiya said, somebodys negligence or failure to clean it choked the water flow. 

Citing three instances in the last 16 years when the match could be possible despite rains, Dalmiya said: The infrastructure available at Eden Gardens is still the best in the world The drainage system is made in such a way that it can last another 100 years, but just a check-up is necessary before a big event. 

Baseless allegations about the infrastructure may encourage the detractors to deny the Eden of its justified share of matches, Dalmiya said. Eden is like a temple to me the undue criticism hurled at it really pains me please dont malign its image.

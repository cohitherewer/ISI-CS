 Drogba focus on charity

London: Chelsea striker Didier Drogba will end his season after the FA Cup final and embark on a fight against poverty for the United Nations. 

The Ivorian, appointed in January as a Goodwill Ambassador, by the United Nations Development Programme, will join the likes of former France captain Zinedine Zidane and Brazilian striker Ronaldo. 

We havent started yet. Now I think were going to have time to speak with Ronaldo and Zidane and to prepare something, said Drogba

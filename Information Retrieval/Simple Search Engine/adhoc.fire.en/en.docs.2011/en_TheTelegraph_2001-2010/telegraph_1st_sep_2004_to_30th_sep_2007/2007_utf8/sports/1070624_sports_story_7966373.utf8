 Volte-face by PCB

Karachi: Pakistans cricket authorities want the Indian cricket board to reconsider scheduling long-term off-shore matches between the two countries after initially snubbing an Indian offer. 

Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf said the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had asked them to sign an agreement to play some off-shore matches but the former PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan and director cricket operations Saleem Altaf had refused the offer. 

Their reason was understandable as that time some of our players wanted proper breaks between series and felt off-shore matches would add to their already hectic international schedule, he said. (PTI)

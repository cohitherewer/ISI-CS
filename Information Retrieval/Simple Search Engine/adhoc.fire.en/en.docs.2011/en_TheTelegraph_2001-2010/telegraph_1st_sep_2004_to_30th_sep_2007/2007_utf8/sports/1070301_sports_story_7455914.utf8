The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I know the requirements... I love challenges

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Harbhajan Singh 

Mumbai: On Monday night, Jalandhars favourite puttar Harbhajan Singh planned to travel by train to New Delhi before boarding an early morning flight from there to here. 

As it turned out, the train ride had to be shelved and Harbhajan ended up being driven through the night by a friend. 

Main aur kya karta? Hundreds of relatives, friends and Mediapersons turned up just when I was preparing to leave for the station I couldnt take the train and a friend volunteered to drive me (to New Delhi), he told The Telegraph over coffee and Belgian cookies in his room at the Taj. 

Speaking a few hours before Team Indias departure for the World Cup, Harbhajan added: Were bound to play better if theres more josh, but the publics josh is amazing And, the tournament hasnt even begun! If we play the way we did in the recent series against the West Indies and Sri Lanka, were going to do very well 

Asked whether Sir Gary Sobers observation that he could make the difference for India put him under more pressure, Harbhajan smiled: Not at all In fact, it will motivate me even more Legends give some thought before saying something Unhone soch samajh ke baat kaha hoga 

A member of the Sourav Ganguly-led XI which played the 2003 World Cup final, Harbhajan said he was fully prepared to (again) shoulder the responsibility of possibly often being the sole specialist spinner out on the park. 

Main fully prepared hoon Having been around for nine years, I know the requirements I also know what Im capable of If there are times when the team only looks up to me, then its something to be proud of I love challenges and dont allow the pressure to get to me, he declared. 

Team Indias USP, in Harbhajans opinion, is its experience an awesome 2,207 caps. World Cups throw up situations where experience helps Weve got lots and that really makes us pretty unique, he signed off as the travel assistant came to check the weight of his kit bag/coffin. 

With the Sardar supremely confident and conditions expected to favour the slower bowlers, Team Indias opponents had better watch out.

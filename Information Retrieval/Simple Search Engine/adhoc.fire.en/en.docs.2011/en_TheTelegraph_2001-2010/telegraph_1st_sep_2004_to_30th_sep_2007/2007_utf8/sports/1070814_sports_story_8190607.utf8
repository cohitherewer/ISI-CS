The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A win for Md. Sporting at last 

A STAFF REPORTER 

 Raman Vijayan scored a brace on Monday 

Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting finally won a match in the ongoing CFL Premier Division, defeating Calcutta Port Trust 4-2 on Monday. 

This was the first victory for Shabbir Alis boys in four matches, giving them some breathing space following 2-6 loss to East Bengal. 

Raman Vijayan (2), Basudeb Mondal and K. Kulothungan scored for Mohammedan Sporting, while Souvik Biswas and Chukwukere Henry were on target for the port side. 

If Mohammedan Sporting had reason to celebrate at their own home ground on Monday, Calcutta Port Trust were reduced into further ignominy despite introducing veteran Amal Datta as their new technical director. 

Datta couldnt make it to the ground because his locality was waterlogged, but even his association with the side could hardly boost their sagging morale. 

They were beaten black and blue by Mohun Bagan (0-7) in the last match and showed little sign of improvement against the black-and-white brigade. 

Hardly looking like a force to reckon with, Alis boys must have had a nerve-wracking time when Calcutta Port Trust negated Basudebs goal and looked like they were going to spoil the hosts party. 

But the post-break session saw a different side as the Mondals took the field on a more positive note. Mohammedan Sportings renewed energy and enthusiasm, in fact, had its origin in a masterstroke from their coach when he replaced Mohammed Muneer with Vijayan. 

A square pass from Prasanta Chakraborty was enough for the Keralite to make it 2-1 in the 56th minute. The Mohammedan Sporting attack gathered momentum and Basudebs free-kick in the 63rd minute again proved to be productive. Rival goalkeeper Sandip Guha fumbled to thwart his kick and Kulothangan, who was lurking nearby, snapped up the rebound and it was 3-1. 

Mohammedan Sporting took another 13 minutes to complete the rout. Kulothungan this time fed Vijayan for his brace. Four-one and the home fans were cock-a-hoop. 

Two minutes before the final whistle, Henry reduced the margin to 2-4, but the Mohammedan Sporting fans were hardly complaining. 

Saying the victory was a result of a combined effort, Ali felt there was still room for improvement. Goalkeeping is an area of concern. Were awaiting Nasim Akhtars clearance from Eastern Railways, he said. 

Meanwhile, the match between East Bengal and Peerless SC will be replayed at the East Bengal ground on Tuesday. 

Peerless were leading East Bengal 2-0 before the match was abandoned because of heavy rainfall.

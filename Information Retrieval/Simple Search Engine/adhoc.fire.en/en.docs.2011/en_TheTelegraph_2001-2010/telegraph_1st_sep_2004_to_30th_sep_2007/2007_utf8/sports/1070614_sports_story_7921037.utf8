 IGU clarifies position

New Delhi: The Indian Golf Union (IGU) on Wednesday moved to allay apprehensions with regard to a European Tour sanctioned event to be held in the country without the participation of Asian Tour or the Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI). 

The European Tour on Monday announced that it had sanctioned $2.5 million Indian Masters to be held by the IGU in February next year, which sparked sharp reactions from the PGTI, the national body in charge of professional golf, and the Asian Tour. 

The IGU is the apex body of golf in India and is the only recognised body by other world golf associations, according to IGU statement on Wednesday. 

The European Tour approached us as and were clear from the beginning that they would be offering 20 invitations to Indian players who played in domestic events only. 

When informed that there is a players body, the PGTI, who were the ones responsible (for the administration of pro golf), they were happy to offer these invitations to them. (PTI)

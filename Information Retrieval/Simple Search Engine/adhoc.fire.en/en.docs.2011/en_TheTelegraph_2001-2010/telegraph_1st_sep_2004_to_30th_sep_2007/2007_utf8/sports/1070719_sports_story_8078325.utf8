 Team Sania in quarters

Cincinnati: Top seeds Sania Mirza and Bethanie Mettack cruised into the quarter finals of the $175,000 Cincinnati Open after a straight set win over Colombian-Chinese pair Catalina Castano and Meng Yuan. 

The Indo-American pair overwhelmed their unseeded rivals 6-4, 6-0 in a first round match of the Tier III hard court tournament here on Tuesday. 

Sania and Bethanie were broken just once in the near hour-long contest. 

In the next round, the duo will take on either wildcards Kirsten Flower (US) and Connie Hsu (China), or Lilia Osterloh (US) and Anastasia Rodionova (Russia).

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 This Bird is special 

 - Legendary umpire laments too much use of technology 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

London: Harold Dickie 

 Bird stopped umpiring many years ago (after 66 Tests and 

 70 ODIs), but remains as big a draw as any of the present-day 

 cricketers. 

On Saturday morning, for example, the legendary Yorkshireman was mobbed for autographs (photographs too) as he stood near the nets area at Lords. 

 Id thought people 

 had forgotten me... Im 70, but look at this, 

 Bird told The Telegraph as somebody shouted 

 Dickie, youll remain a superstar. 

Not one to favour high usage of technology, Bird emphasised he was disappointed that the authority was being taken away from the on-field umpires. 

In my view, the TV should only be used to confirm run-outs... Nothing more... Leave the rest of the decisions to the men in the middle... 

Commenting on Fridays fiasco featuring Simon Taufel, Bird said: I couldnt make out what happened, but an umpire is within his rights to reverse his decision... I dont know the sequence of events, though... 

Asked whether the quality of umpiring had improved in recent years, he replied: Very difficult to say... Theres so much use of technology... 

 The dismay showed on Birds face.

 Sharath bows out in semis

 Sharath Kamal 

Jaipur: Indias campaign at the 17th Commonwealth Table Tennis Championships came to an end as defending champion Achanta Sharath Kamal crashed out against top seed Gao Ning of Singapore in the semi-finals here on Tuesday. 

Sharath Kamal lost 11-13, 10-12, 8-11, 7-11 to the world No. 18 to bow out of the meet on the last day of the event at Sawai Man Singh Stadium. 

Singapore caused Indias downfall in the doubles event as well with Subhajit Saha and Anirban Nandi going down 12-10, 2-11, 7-11, 2-11 against Ning and Yang Zi in the semi-finals and settled for bronze. 

In womens doubles, Indias Vishakha Vijay and Sushmita Roy, who reached the semi-finals on Monday riding on two upset wins, went down to the Canadian pair of Mo Zhang and Yuen Sara 11-9, 11-9, 7-11, 11-9 to win bronze. 

Both the mens and womens singles final will be an all-Singaporean affair. 

In the mens finals, Ning will clash with second seed Yang Zi, who thrashed Nosiru Kazeem of Nigeria 11-8, 11-9, 11-8, 11-6 in another semi-finals. 

In the womens singles final, Gu Wang Yue will take on Sun Bei Bei. Both Wang and Bei Bei had to fight their way out in the semi-finals that went all along the wire. 

Wang edged past Malaysian Lee Wei Beh 6-11, 10-12, 13-11, 8-11, 11-6, 11-5, 11-5 while Bei Bei surpassed Miao Miao of Australia 13-11, 8-11, 12-10, 8-11, 11-9, 8-11, 11-8 in marathon encounters. 

But it was heartbreak for India in the mens semi-finals where Sharath Kamal lost to Gao, who had earlier beaten him in the Indian Open tour in Delhi earlier this year. 

I played him much better today but there are still some small details that I need to work out to beat top ranked players, Sharath said after the match. 

It all boils down to taking some risk at crucial moments. But it is easier to say that execute. But I should have won at least one of the first two close matches, Sharath said. 

The second game also went neck and neck but Sharath lost the close one. Had the outcome of these two close games gone Sharaths way, it could have been his day.

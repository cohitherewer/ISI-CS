 Injury-hit Becks out for a month

Madrid: David Beckham will be sidelined for at least a month of his remaining time at Real Madrid after damaging the lateral ligament in his right knee. 

A spokesman for Beckham said the former England captain would be out for between four and six weeks after suffering a strain to the ligament during Sundays 1-1 draw against Getafe at the Bernabeu. 

Beckham will not only miss the return leg of Reals Champions League last-16 tie against Bayern Munich, but also this Saturdays clash against arch-rivals Barcelona at the Nou Camp as well as at least another four Primera Liga games. 

If Real manage to beat Bayern, the 31-year-old could be available for the return leg.

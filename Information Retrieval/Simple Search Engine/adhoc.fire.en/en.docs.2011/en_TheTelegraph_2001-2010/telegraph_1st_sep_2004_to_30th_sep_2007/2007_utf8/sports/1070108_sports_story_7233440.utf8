 Calcutta: Trainer Daniel Davids ward, Moon Forest, was simply brilliant while winning the 2,400m Eveready Calcutta Derby Stakes on Sunday. The cantering win of the 5-4 favourite over Amorina, a filly not only silenced his critics, but it also confirmed that the 2000 Guineas winner was a far better stayer than a miler.

 There was no hard luck story in the race which was run at a fast pace with Andrology shooting into a long lead. Silver Print followed the leader at a safe distance while Amorina, Moon Forest, Ardelis and the rest galloped in a close group. The order of the running, however, remained unchanged until Andrology handed over the lead to Silver Print and the fancied runners got alarmed.

 Silver Print brought the field into the view as Amorina got closer to the leader and Moon Forest also worked his way up. With 200m to go, it was Amorina who had a brief brush with the lead. However, the joy of her backers was shortlived no sooner Moon Forest walked onto the scent on the wide out. The winner stretched out so well that his jockey, Colm Donoghue, had to apply brakes on the horse nearly 50m from the winning post.

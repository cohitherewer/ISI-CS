 Kalmadis plea to govt

New Delhi: IOA president Suresh Kalmadi on Monday urged the government to reinstate hockey and football in the priority list after the recent success of the two teams in international tournaments. 

While the football team won its maiden Nehru Cup Trophy in New Delhi, the hockey team remained unbeaten to retain the Asia Cup in Chennai on Sunday. 

The two disciplines were demoted to general category in May. 

Kalmadis views were supported by AIFF president, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, Judo Federation of India chief Jagdish Tytler and Archery Association of India president Vijay Kumar Malhotra in the Parliament on Sunday. (PTI)

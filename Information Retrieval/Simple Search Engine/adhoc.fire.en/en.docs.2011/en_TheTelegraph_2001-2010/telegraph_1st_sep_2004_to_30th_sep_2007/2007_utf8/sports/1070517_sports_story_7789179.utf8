 Sourav keen to convert 80s into 100s

Chittagong: Sourav Ganguly, who has had quite a few decent scores since his comeback to Team India, said on Wednesday he would try to convert the 80s into hundreds if he got a chance in the two-Test series against Bangladesh starting here on Friday. 

I was the highest run-getter in Tests in South Africa. The good thing is, I have been consistent. Here if I get to the 80s, I will surely try to convert them into 100s, Ganguly said after nets. 

Asked how he felt to be back in the Team India squad, Sourav said: Sachin (Tendulkar) and I were rested. That gave a few youngsters a chance to perform. 

The former captain said he had no preference in the batting order. 

I always work hard at nets. Its the decision of the team and what the situation demands, he said. 

On opening the innings, he said, that is again up to the team management. If they want me to do the job, Im game. 

On his huge popularity in Bangladesh, Sourav said: I dont consider Bangladesh as a different country. I captained in my first Test here. So Bangladesh will always be special. 

Sourav vehemently denied a report saying that he had decided to sign for Indian Cricket League (ICL). 

Its not true. There are too many stories going around. I did not have any discussion with anyone, Sourav said. 

There is no chance of any discussion with anyone even in the future. I am not joining any league. I am honoured to play for my country, he said.

 Bangladesh oust Windies

Johannesburg: West Indies were knocked out of the ICC World Twenty20 on Thursday when Bangladesh roared to victory by six wickets in their group match. 

Bangladesh won the toss and limited the West Indies to 164 for eight before captain Mohammed Ashrafuls sparkling 61 off 27 balls ensured they reached the target with two overs to spare. 

Ashrafuls delightful innings included seven fours and three sixes as he tore into the West Indies bowling after neither opener, Tamim Iqbal (10) nor Mohammed Nazimuddin (one), made any impression. 

Ashraful shared a third-wicket partnership of 109 off 64 balls with Aftab Ahmed, who batted through the innings to finish with 62 not out off 49 balls, with eight fours and a six. 

The West Indies were once again sluggish in the field and ill-disciplined in their bowling, having been trounced by eight wickets in the tournaments opening match against South Africa on Tuesday at the same venue. 

Dwayne Smiths brutal hitting at the end of the innings lifted the West Indies from a moderate score after he came to the crease with 19 deliveries left and his team on 131 for five. 

He quickly scored 29 off seven balls, hitting four sixes. 

Devon Smith earlier scored a patient half-century as the West Indies overcame a tough start. 

He and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (37) added 95 for the second wicket after the third-ball loss of Chris Gayle but it took them 13.1 overs. 

Left-arm seamer Syed Rasel performed superbly with the new ball for Bangladesh, removing Gayle, who notched the first international Twenty20 century against South Africa on Tuesday, for a duck as he bowled his four overs for just 10 runs. 

Spinners Abdur Razzak (two for 25) and Shakib ul-Hasan (four for 34) then caused a late clatter of wickets.

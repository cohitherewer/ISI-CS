Colombo: Dilhara Fernando grabbed a career-best haul of four for 24 to script Sri Lankas 70-run victory over Bangladesh in the opening one-day International here on Friday. 

The 28-year-old fast bowler took all his wickets in a lively opening spell as Sri Lanka dismissed Bangladesh for 164 after posting 234-6 to gain a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. 

Sri Lanka earlier rode on impressive half-centuries from Chamara Silva (65) and Upul Tharanga (57) to reach a competitive total before man-of-the-match Fernando wrecked the visitors. 

Bangladesh got off to a decent start when Shahriar Nafees (33) and Tamim Iqbal (11) put on 45 runs for the opening wicket. 

Fernando provided the breakthrough when he dismissed Iqbal and Tushar Imran in the same over before accounting for skipper Mohammad Ashraful and Nafees to virtually ensure his teams emphatic victory. 

Hats off to Fernando. He has really come back strongly, said Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene. 

We made early mistakes and Bangladesh bowled well. Credit should go to Tharanga and Silva as it was not easy to bat. We capitalised in the last 10 overs as well. 

Bangladesh, blanked in the preceding three-Test series, rocked the hosts in the early overs when left-arm seamer Syed Rasel took two wickets and paceman Mashrafe Mortaza one in their opening spells.

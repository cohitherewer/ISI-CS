London: Manchester United scored three first-half goals to beat Aston Villa 3-1 in the Premier League on Saturday and stay six points ahead of Chelsea. 

Park Ji-sung, Michael Carrick and Cristiano Ronaldo scored at Old Trafford as Manchester United beat Villa for the 11th straight time. The Red Devils had also knocked Villa out in Sundays FA Cup third round. Chelsea beat Wigan 4-0 at Stamford Bridge for their first league win in four games. Frank Lampard, Arjen Robben and Didier Drogba scored, while Wigan goalkeeper Chris Kirkland conceded an own goal. 

Manchester United have 57 points after 18 wins from 23 games, while Chelsea have 51. Liverpool stayed third on 43 after a 3-0 win at last-place Watford. 

Saturdays other results were: Bolton 0, Manchester City 0; Charlton 1, Middlesbrough 3; Sheffield United 1, Portsmouth 1 and West Ham 3, Fulham 3. 

Henrik Larsson made his league debut for United by partnering Wayne Rooney in attack, but it was Park who scored in the 11th minute and then set up Carricks first goal for United two minutes later. 

Carrick then provided the cross for Ronaldo to head his 13th goal of the season, before Gabriel Agbonlahor scored a consolation goal for Villa. 

Beaten 3-1 in the FA Cup and then 6-3 in the League Cup by the Gunners at Anfield in the past week, Liverpool played a 3-4-3 formation and had two goals from Peter Crouch and one from Craig Bellamy. 

I am convinced this team is more consistent now and is focused on the league, Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez said. We have to play Chelsea and we will see if we can catch them. We will have confidence and it will be difficult but it is possible. 

In the 34th minute at Vicarage Road, a shot by Crouch was blocked by goalkeeper Ben Foster and Steve Finnan passed the ball square for Bellamy to score his eighth goal of the season. 

Six minutes later, a clearance by Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina was headed on by Dirk Kuyt, and although Foster saved Bellamys subsequent shot, Crouch headed in the rebound. Crouch scored the third in the 48th on a Liverpool counterattack. (AP)

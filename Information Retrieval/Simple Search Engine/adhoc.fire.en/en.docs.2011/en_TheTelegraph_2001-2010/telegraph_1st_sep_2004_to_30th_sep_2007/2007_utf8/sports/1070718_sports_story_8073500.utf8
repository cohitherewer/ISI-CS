The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ive got to start from scratch

 - Ive performed in the past, but thats no guarantee for success: 

 Sourav

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sourav Ganguly at Lord rsquo;s 

 on Tuesday

London: Exactly a year ago, out-in-the-cold Sourav Ganguly was trying to make the most of a short-term contract at Northants. I didnt even know wed be playing a Test at Lords, forget about hoping to tour England this summer! he told The Telegraph on Tuesday afternoon. A while earlier, the former Team India captain (the only Asian to author a hundred on Test debut at Lords), interacted with the media. 

The following are excerpts 

On his emotions in the lead-up to yet another

 Test at Lords, where he made his debut 11 years ago 

Just want to do well Ive performed in the past, but thats no guarantee for success Remember, its

 a one-ball game for batsmen 

On his frame of mind going into that debut Test 

A shade emotionally) Ive never had that frame of mind again Somehow, Ive not been able to develop that I wasnt nervous, wasnt afraid of failure My mind was clear and I enjoyed every single day of that Test Perhaps, age had something to do with it Different thoughts crop up when youve been around for some time 

[Sourav turned 35 on July 8.] 

On whether, nowadays, he doesnt enjoy

 all five days of a Test 

No No Its not that I didnt have any worries then As Ive said, the fear of failure wasnt there With experience, one begins to think about a lot of things For

 example, about contributing to the team. 

On 11 years as a Test cricketer 

Ive evolved as a batsman Ive learnt to play in different conditions, learnt to tackle different bowlers Learnt about my strengths and weaknesses Ive

 had to work things out to get better. 

On his comeback last December 

Look, everything depends on how well youre playing Its about form Ive done well in both forms (after making a return) Today, I have a good mindset But with nothing guaranteed, Ive got to start from scratch all over again. The past is past At

 best, it lifts confidence. 

On the current Indian pace attack being short on experience 

But theyve got the ability and the quality Zaheer (Khan) is a proven performer and is probably bowling at his best Sreesanth

 has delivered and if R.P. (Singh) can do the job, then our new-ball attack

 is going to be a handful. 

On ally Harbhajan Singh not being in the tour party 

Hes not only an ally, but a matchwinner He won a number of games for us when I was the captain Hes a world-class spinner and was awesome during the 2001 home series against Australia Given his ability, hes

 bound to make a comeback soon. 

On England having to do without Andrew Flintoff and Steve Harmison 

Affects their line-up, yes, but theyve got somebody like Monty Panesar, who has been bowling well Theres

 Matthew Hoggard as well. Of course, Flintoff and Harmison will be missed. 

On Flintoff 

Hes a quality allrounder 

On England as an opposition 

They play well at home. 

On there being no full-time coach for Team India 

It (the experiment) has been all right Weve got three people (cricket manager Chandu Borde and the two specialist coaches) to help us Weve

 got an adequate support staff 

On whether beating England in the 2002 NatWest

 final, at Lords, was his No.1 one-day achievement as captain 

It was special, but making the 2003 World Cup final was very special as well. 

On not being the captain on this tour of England 

Now, Ive got more time for myself I can relax a lot more When youre

 the captain, the demand on time is huge. 

On the pressure of being a leading batsman 

Thats always there Whether youre captain or vice-captain or just an ordinary member of the team, the pressure to perform never goes away Its important not to lose focus to

 put big runs on the board. 

On having to adjust in England 

Because of the movement, one has to play on the front-foot.

 Its different from Australia or South Africa, where the bounce forces

 you on the back-foot... 

On being most comfortable while touring England 

Thats because we dont have to take long flights every few days Travelling by coach from one centre to another isnt tiring. In any case, the journeys arent

 long. Indeed, I do like coming to this part of the world. 

Finally, on having been called Lord Snooty during

 his stint with Lancashire in 2000 

(Laughs) I dont think I was called that! If I was, it must have been because I dont drink In England, youre expected to do so at the end of the day, whereas I would have a coke and head for the apartment to spend time with my wife. I wouldnt mingle like the rest Its tough being a non-drinker in England I probably didnt perform the way they expected an overseas pro to, but I definitely didnt

 have a problem at Lancashire.

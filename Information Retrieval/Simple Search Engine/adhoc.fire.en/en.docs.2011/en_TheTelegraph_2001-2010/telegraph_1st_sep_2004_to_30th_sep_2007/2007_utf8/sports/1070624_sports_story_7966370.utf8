 Co-hosts seek more powers from ICC

 Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf said on Saturday that they would call for a review of the host countries agreement. 

The revelations came after agreeing with the Indian cricket board on not giving the International Cricket Council (ICC) full control of organisational matters during the 2011 World Cup which reduces the host countries to a postmaster role. 

According to Ashraf, I.S. Bindra, a senior Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) official, told the participants of the World Cup central organising committee meeting held recently in Bhurban that Indias experience of hosting the 2006 Champions Trophy was not a happy one. 

The general consensus was, after hearing the Indian argument, that the ICC was treating host countries of its licensed tournaments like a postmaster, reduced to just selling tickets while the ICC controlled everything, said Ashraf, who is also the convenor of the committee. 

The ICC has even taken over the responsibility of preparing pitches for the World Cup and Champions Trophy matches, he said adding we are not satisfied with the present arrangements. 

Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, the co-hosts of the 2011 World Cup, now plan to bring up the issue at the ICCs annual executive board meeting in London and call for a review of the host countries agreement. 

We will be asking for the ICC to delegate some powers and authority to the host country as well while hosting the ICC events, a PCB official said. The World Cup, Champions Trophy, Youth World Cup are now all managed directly by the ICC. (PTI)

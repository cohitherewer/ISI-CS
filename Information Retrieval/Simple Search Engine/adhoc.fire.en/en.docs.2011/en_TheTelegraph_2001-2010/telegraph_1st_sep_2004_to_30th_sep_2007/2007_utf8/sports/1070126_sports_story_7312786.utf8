Calcutta: Unseeded Ikramul Haque Siam of Bangladesh caused a flutter by upsetting 12th seed Niraj Saripalli of Goa in the second round of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship at Gorky Sadan here on Thursday. 

Ikramul, playing white, opted for the advanced variation in Caro-Kann Defence to win the game in 51 moves. The other seeded players, however, won their games with relative ease. 

Top seed Shreyansh Daklia of Chhattisgarh played a lesser-known variation in Queens Pawn Opening against eight-year-old Chandreyee Hajra of Gospel Home School. Both players attacked on the opposite wings, but Chandreyee gave up her rook for Daklias bishop on the 22nd move, after which the top seed carved out a win in the endgame exploiting his material superiority. 

Second seed Adith Jagadish of Karnataka, however, had to sweat it out against Debaditya Chakraborty of St Clare in the Sicilian Pelikan, before finally winning the game in 47 moves.

 Trelawny glitch 

Daniel Town: Several World Cup workers and volunteers were locked out of the Trelawny Multi-Purpose Stadium for Mondays warm-up match between the West Indies and Kenya. 

World Cup organisers have indicated that the situation stemmed from the lateness of thousands of applications from a large number of stadium workers and volunteers, and this meant a number of key personnel were not in place prior to the start of the match.

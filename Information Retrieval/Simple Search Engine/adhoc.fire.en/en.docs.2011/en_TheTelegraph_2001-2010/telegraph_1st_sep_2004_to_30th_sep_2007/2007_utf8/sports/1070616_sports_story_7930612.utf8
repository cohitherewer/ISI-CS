 Hamilton: Im not Woods 

 Lewis Hamilton 

Indianapolis: Lewis Hamilton enters Tiger territory this week and whether Formula Ones new hero likes it or not, comparisons will abound ahead of Sundays US Grand Prix in Indianapolis. 

Hamilton, who last weekend at the Canadian GP became the first black driver to win a Formula One race, has tried to distance himself from the inevitable comparison with Tiger Woods, saying their situations have little in common. 

For American sports fans, however, there are undeniable links and with golfs world No.1 just a few hundred miles east teeing up at the US Open, the pair will be under scrutiny this weekend. 

Im not Tiger, Hamilton said after his victory in Canada. I have to prove myself before people can make those types of comparisons. 

Despite Hamiltons uneasiness at comparisons to Woods, the similarities between the two are striking. Like Woods, Hamilton is articulate and thoughtful. Both have found success at every level and are unruffled by the spotlight. 

The newest British icon was quick to give credit where it was due as he celebrated the first win of an already astonishing Formula One career last weekend. 

I have to dedicate this win to my dad because without him this would not have been possible, said the 22-year-old. 

You wouldnt believe the amount of work hes put into my career, said the Briton. He had nothing when he was younger. He lost his mum at a young age and just to see his family be successful is a real pleasure to him. 

The tribute was richly deserved. The close bond with father Anthony, a constant presence at the races, as well as half-brother Nicholas who has cerebral palsy, has been a driving force in Hamiltons meteoric rise. (AGENCIES)

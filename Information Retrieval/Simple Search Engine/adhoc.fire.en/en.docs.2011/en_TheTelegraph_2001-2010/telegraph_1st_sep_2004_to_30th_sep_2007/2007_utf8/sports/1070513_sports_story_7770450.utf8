 Shoaib a doubtful starter

Karachi: Shoaib Akhtar is a doubtful starter for the Asia XI in the Afro-Asia Cricket Cup as he still needs time to recuperate from his knee injury. 

I dont know if I will be able to play in the one-day series and I am a doubtful starter. I have informed the Pakistan Cricket Board about this, Shoaib said in Lahore on Saturday. 

Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Yousuf are the other two Pakistanis in the Asian squad for the three-match ODI series to be played in India between June 6 and 10. 

A Twenty20 match has also been scheduled on June 5, which will include mostly reserve players of both sides. 

The mercurial speedster, who has been out of action since breaking down earlier this year, said he was still trying to recover from the injury. 

I am fit but I want to be super fit and make a permanent return to international cricket, Shoaib said. 

The pacer said he did not want to be a burden on the Asian team as he needed more time to get match practice and his rhythm back. 

I have offered to play the Twenty20 match instead as it will give me a chance to bowl a few overs in competitive conditions, he said. 

Shoaib and Asif were tested positive for nandrolone in out of competition dope tests held by the PCB last September. (PTI)

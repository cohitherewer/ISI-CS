The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 EB-Mahindra clash today

Mumbai:East Bengal hope to continue their decent run against holders Mahindra United as they gear up for a clash to stamp their supremacy midway the National Football League at Cooperage Friday. 

Both teams are on 14 points from seven matches, but Mahindra have a better goal-difference. Dempo are currently leading the pack with 17 points but they have played a match more. 

East Bengal have lately enjoyed a decent run of form, having defeated archrivals Mohun Bagan and have done well in away fixtures, barring their opening game reversal against Air India here. 

Mahindra had completed a rare double last year over the Calcutta outfit, beating them by a solitary goal in both legs.

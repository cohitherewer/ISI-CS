 Hari up to 2nd spot

 Paks (Hungary): Top seed P. Harikrishna avenged his opening round loss to Grandmaster Peter Acs by outplaying the Hungarian in the sixth round of the Marx Gyorgy Memorial international chess tournament underway here. 

Harikrishna, who was languishing at the bottom of the table for a long time, jumped to second spot following his second successive victory in the tournament. The Indians game was the lone decisive encounter of the sixth round in the category-14 double round-robin tournament. 

On other boards, leader Viktor Korchnoi of Switzerland was held to a draw by Hou Yifan of China while the all-Hungarian dual between Ferenc Berkes and Csaba Balogh also reached a deadlock. 

Korchnoi is still in the lead with 4 points out of a possible 6 and Harikrishna is just half a point behind. 

 Balogh and Acs are joint third with 3 points while Berkes is half a point behind. Yifan is at the bottom of the table on 2 points. 

In the next round, Harikrishna, playing white, meets Korchnoi and the result may have a bearing on the final standings. 

In the Paks Cup Grandmaster tournament being organised simultaneously, GM norm holder Tania Sachdev registered a hard-fought victory over International Master David Smerdom of Australia. 

Tania took her tally to 2.5 points out of a possible 7 and is now within striking distance of an International Master norm. 

Attilia Groszpeter of Hungary, the overnight leader in this section, was beaten by top seed Yu Shaoteng of china and it is now a three way lead at the top between Groszpeter, Papp Gabor and Krisztian Szabo who all have 5 points. 

Harikrishna was in his element, beating Acs from a Catalan opening game. Playing white, the Indian faced one of the topical variation but was well armed for the complications that ensued. 

Acs made a positional error in the early middle game and found his king coming under firing line against Harikrshnas well-coordinated pieces and he had to concede a pawn to stay in the game. 

However, Harikrishna relentlessly attacked the black king to come out victorious in 39 moves. 

Playing the white side of Catalan, Korchnoi had thing under control for a long time and while it looked that he was squeezing out the defensive resources, Yifan came up with some fine tactics in the endgame to pose problems for her opponent. 

 In the end Korchnoi lost a piece 

 after which it was a forced draw. (PTI)

 3 states keen to host Fed Cup 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Three states are in line to host Federation Cup in September, according to the AIFF sources. 

A final decision will be taken in the AIFF executive committee meeting on July 20 in the capital. While Assam, who was the first state to bid for the tournament, are still awaiting AIFFs approval, Punjab and Orissa have also shown interest to host it in Ludhiana and Cuttack, respectively. 

A Punjab Football Association official said: We have made the bid to host it since it has never been held in our state. In September, it doesnt rain much in Punjab. Given a chance, we will be able to hold it in Ludhiana under floodlights. 

Meanwhile, Churchill Brothers official Joaquim Alemao, who is likely to succeed Shivanand Salgaocar as the Goa Football Association president, said that if elected, he would like to host the tournament in Margao.

 I am a right-arm pacer. My coach says that the seam doesnt land straight when I am bowling. As a result, I fail to get the swing. How do I correct this?

 (Arko Mukherjee, 18, Calcutta-40)

 Work with your coach on your grip and wrist action. 

 I am a right-arm mediumpacer. What are the advantages and disadvantages of bowling for and against the wind. Please advise.

 (Ayan Mukherjee, 15, Calcutta-50)

 Fast bowlers generally prefer to bowl with the wind behind them as it takes less out of them.

 I am a right-arm mediumpacer. How does one bowl the off and leg cutter?

 (Debarshi Mukherjee, 15, Calcutta-40)

 You slide your fingers across the seam either way at time of delivery.

 I am an off-spinner. Should one keep flighting the ball when the batsman is in a murderous mood?

 (Somen Agarwal, 21, Siliguri)

 You got to mix it up so that you induce the false shot.

 I am an off-spinner. When there are a few spots outside the off stump, should bowling round the wicket help?

 (Anupam Roy, 19, Calcutta)

 Its always a good option and acts as a variation.

 I am a left-handed batsman. When trying the reverse sweep I often get bowled. Please help.

 (Sandip Datta, 21, Calcutta)

 First master the proper sweep before looking to improvise.

 I am a right-handed batsman. When going for the hook I often fail to get my balance right. What should I do?

 (Anup Sinha, 19, Calcutta-21)

 Use the depth of the crease and move back and across so that you are better balanced and have more time.

 I am a left-handed batsman. While playing defensively against off-spinners, I often get caught in the close-in field. Do I need to change my grip?

 (Rahim Sen, 23 Durgapur)

 Make sure you transfer your weight forward and the bat is in front of the pad.

 I am a right-handed batsman. Despite watching the bowlers hand closely, I often find it hard to read the googly. Please help.

 (Avishek Shukla, 19, Guwahati)

 Watch closely. You will see the ball coming out of the back of the bowlers hand.

 My ground fielding is very poor. Several hours of practice havent helped. Can you suggest a remedy?

 (Ramit Guha, 18, Agartala)

 Keep at it. There is no shortcut to success.

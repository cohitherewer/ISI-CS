 Lewis Hamilton does it again

Indianapolis: Rookie sensation Lewis Hamilton did it again, racing to his second straight Formula One victory in Sundays US Grand Prix. 

The first black driver in Formula Ones 61-year history has finished all seven races this season in the top three. He now leads Mercedes McLaren teammate and two-time world champion Fernando Alonso by 10 points in the standings. 

The two finished 1-2 for the third time this season, but this time the order was reversed from Malaysia in April and last months race at Monaco as the 22-year-old Englishman added this victory to his inaugural Formula One triumph last week in the Canadian Grand Prix. 

Alonso tried hard to pass his less experienced teammate at the start, darting to the outside and pulling nearly alongside Hamilton for a moment, then backing off and diving to the inside as the leaders squirted through the first two narrow turns, a sharp right-hander and then a left-hander. 

Hamilton managed to stay in front and was able to continue to fend off the pressure by the hard-charging Spaniard to the end of the 73-lap event on the Indinapolis Motor Speedways 4.192-kilometre (2.605-mile) road circuit. 

Alonso almost wrested the lead from Hamilton on lap 39. He had been dogging the back of his teammates McLaren for several laps and pulled alongside on the main straightaway but was unable to complete the pass. 

The outcome was still in question until Alonso locked up his brakes on lap 47 and drove through the grass, allowing Hamilton to pull out to a 2.5-second lead. Hamilton was able to drive on to the win without further challenge, crossing the finish line 1.5 seconds ahead of Alonso.

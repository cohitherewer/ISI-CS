 Jeev, Jyoti miss the cut

Abu Dhabi: Jeev Milkha Singh began his Asian Tour campaign on a disappointing note as he missed the cut while compatriot Shiv Kapur dazzled with six birdies in a flawless six-under 66 in the second round of the $ 2m Abu Dhabi Championships. 

Jeev and Jyoti Randhawa finished at par for 36 holes but their effort was not enough. 

Kapur was two shots behind leader Philip Price and lying tied third in the company of Miguel Jimenez (65), Nick Hern (68) and Italian Alessandro Tadini (66). 

Philip Archer, the overnight leader, shot 75 and slipped to tied 11th. (PTI)

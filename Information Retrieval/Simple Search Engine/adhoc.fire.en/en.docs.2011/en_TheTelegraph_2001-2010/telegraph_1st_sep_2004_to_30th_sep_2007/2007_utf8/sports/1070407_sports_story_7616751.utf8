New Delhi: Gaurav Ghei carded a brilliant seven-under-par, 65 to take his total to 12-under-par, 132 and grab sole lead on Day II of the inaugural Rs 60 lakh AIS Golf Open, underway at the Delhi Golf Club on Friday. 

Gaurav teed off from the tenth hole and started the day with a dropped shot on the par-four 13th hole where he three-putted from 25-feet. 

However, he made no mistakes thereafter, making a birdie on the par-five 14th and another on the 18th hole to make the turn at one-under-par. 

S.S.P. Chowrasia carded a level-par 72 and is in sole second place at nine-under-par, 135.

 Moores upbeat on Flintoff

London: England coach Peter Moores feels that allrounder Andrew Flintoff is likely to be fit for the seventh and deciding one-day International against India at Lords on Saturday. 

The 29-year-old Flintoff, who was suffering from left-ankle injury, missed the last two games at Headingley and the Oval. 

On Friday, Flintoff took part in Englands training session and Moores is hopeful that he will pass a late fitness test on the morning of the match. 

Moores also believes that Flintoffs comeback will serve as a huge morale-booster for England as they look to stop India in their strides. 

Hes had a bat and a bowl and appeared ok The physio seems quite confident that as hes come through so well and got a pretty good chance of playing tomorrow, Moores said. 

Weve got to wait to make sure theres no reaction so its a case of wait and see on that, but were hopeful. 

The England coach reckons Flintoffs return could help the team getting back to winning ways. 

It would be nice to win a one-day series. I think wed get a great momentum from it, he said. 

But the main thing for me is how the players have committed to the series and how much theyve enjoyed it.

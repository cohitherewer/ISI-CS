 Sharan pips Sewa to title

 - National Games 

 Guwahati: Delhi capped a splendid show on the tennis court at the 33rd National Games on Saturday with Divij Sharan bagging a double and Parul Goswami running away with the womens singles title. 

Mens top seed Divij blew away a feeble challenge from Bengals Manoj Sewa 6-1, 6-1 to claim the singles gold after 115 minutes. 

The 20-year-old Delhi boy was back on court a little later to partner Ashutosh Singh to the mens doubles title with a 7-6 (7-5), 6-4 victory over Kamala Kannan and Vijay Sundar Prasad. 

Earlier, Parul toppled top seed Sonal Phadke of Maharashtra in the womens final 7-6 (7-4), 6-3. Karnataka pair of Poojashree Venkatesh and Archana Venkatraman prevented a clean sweep by Delhi by lifting the womens doubles crown. The duo rallied to a 4-6, 6-0, 6-2 triumph over Sonal and Krushmi Chheda. 

In badminton, Saina Nehwal of Andhra Pradesh overcame Keralas Aparna Balan 21-15, 21-23, 21-14 to advance to the gold medal match. She will face Maharashtras Aditi Mutatkar, who beat another Andhra player, Jwala Gutta, 21-17 21-10. 

Meanwhile, two umpires and the tournament director were bashed up by players of Assam after they lost their mens hockey bronze medal clash 2-3 to Orissa. 

Diassatisfied with the time added on for an interruption, the Assam players pounced on the umpires, raining blows on their shoulders side and back. Even tournament director Birendra Singh, who rushed to stop the fracas, was hit.

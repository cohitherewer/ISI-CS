 Im glad I came good: De Villiers 

St Georges: AB de Villiers played through cramps, dehydration and heat exhaustion to bury hosts West Indies World Cup dreams and resurrect his own teams semi-final hopes on Tuesday. 

The openers aggressive 146 was the cornerstone of South Africas total of 356 for four, their record World Cup score. 

South Africa restricted West Indies to a reply of 289 for nine to win the Super Eight match by 67 runs. 

Victory virtually ensures the West Indies elimination barring a run of freak results and leaves South Africa much closer to reaching the last four despite Saturdays shock defeat by Bangladesh in Guyana. 

De Villiers reached his century off 114 balls and then he launched an onslaught that earned him his last 46 runs off just 16 deliveries. 

His innings was interrupted several times for treatment for what South African media liaison officer Gordon Templeton later told reporters was cramps, heat exhaustion and dehydration. 

When I reached a hundred I decided to go after it and play through the cramps, De Villiers told a news conference. I was actually trying to get out but it didnt work out that way thats a joke. The ball just went in the gaps and I stayed there much longer than I thought I would. 

De Villiers was relieved he had come good at a critical time. You know that you get only a certain number of games in international cricket so it was important for me that I came good today. More so because the team needed it today. 

Jacques Kallis (81) and De Villiers shared a second-wicket stand of 170, a performance described as pivotal by South African captain Graeme Smith. 

It was always going to be difficult to bat up front because there was a lot of dampness in the pitch, Smith told a news conference. 

Jacques got the momentum going and AB finished it off with a superb knock. Since the match against Australia, he has played aggressively and today was another such day. He has followed it up superbly and his experience is showing through 

After the game against Bangladesh we discussed the areas where we had slipped up and what we wanted to do. We got to No.1 1 playing a certain style of cricket and thats what we did today, he said. 

Some of the stuff that went around back home about the team being divided and in pieces and fighting, it was all a load of crap. So it was nice for the guys to bounce back in the way they did. 

We were happy to put in performance which we did. It was a good wicket, we fielded superbly and there was tremendous energy about our side, he said. (AGENCIES)

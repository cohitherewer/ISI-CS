Mumbai: Hitman Zaheer Khan, who bulldozed Bengal with figures of five for 40 and helped Mumbai take command on Day II of the Ranji Trophy final on Saturday, said at the post-match media conference that he has a psychological edge over former India captain Sourav Ganguly. 

It is true that I have the psychological edge when bowling against Sourav. He is Bengals key player and dismissing the key figure always gives me extra satisfaction, the mediumpacer said on Saturday. 

Zaheer felt that he was fortunate to claim Souravs wicket consistently in domestic cricket. 

I am really fortunate to dismiss a player such as Sourav. It feels good that I have been successful against him several times in first class cricket, Zaheer stated. 

According to Zaheer, the match hasnt finished yet, since this only the second day. 

You never know Anything can happen, but we are in a better position, the left-arm seamer told the reporters. 

The former Baroda quick agreed that County stint has helped him perform better in the international and as well as the domestic arena. 

Playing County matches in the off season has helped me gain confidence and that is showing in my performance of late, he remarked. 

On his decision to play for Mumbai, Zaheer said he played club cricket in Mumbai in 1996. 

Mumbai coach Praveen Amre looked a relieved man with Zaheer by his side. 

Zaheer and Ajit (Agarkar) strengthened our bowling, but youngsters such as Rohit Sharma and Avishek Nair have come up well. We wanted to test Sharma, so he was sent ahead of Sachin Tendulkar, Amre said. 

Bengal coach Paras Mhambrey is not a man to lose heart and appeared hopeful about Bengals chances in the second innings. 

You cannot say the match is finished, we have to pull up our socks and bounce back on Sunday, Mhambrey told The Telegraph. 

Mhambrey felt that Rohan Gavaskars dismissal was a body blow for Bengal. Had Rohan stayed on with Manoj (Tewari), Bengal could have managed better than this, he said.

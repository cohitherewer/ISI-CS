 Shiv Kapur up to tied fifth

Jakarta: Shiv Kapur carded a two-under 69 to jump 12 places to be tied fifth at the end of the third round of the Enjoy Jakarta Astro Indonesia Open on Saturday. 

Kapur, with an aggregate of four-under 209, is four behind leader Frankie Minoza, who had one more hole to play when storm forced a suspension. 

There were about 12 groups yet to finish their second rounds and they will return on Sunday to do so. 

In fact, the 25-year-old Kapur was the clubhouse leader at four-under 209, as he had completed his third round, while others ahead of him still had a few holes to play. 

It was not such a good day for Gaurav Ghei, who from overnight fifth dropped way behind to tied 50th, as he was eight-over 15 holes despite starting the day with a birdie. He had two double bogeys and five bogeys. 

SSP Chowrasia played a one-over 72 and at one-under 212, he was tied 20th, a small fall from his overnight 17th. 

Earlier, when play resumed on Saturday, Rahil Gangjee retired and Amandeep Johl (73, 76) missed the cut. 

Kapur had birdies on the first and fourth and looked set for a good day. But back to back bogeys on the seventh and eight halted his run.

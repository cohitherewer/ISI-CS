 Its got to be night-time drama

New York: Nikolay Davydenko really enjoyed watching Rafael Nadal and David Ferrer run all over the court. He even stayed up until midnight or so. 

Then, it was time for bed. 

Too late, Davydenko said Wednesday after reaching the semi-finals at the US Open. Need to sleep. 

With the upper deck at Arthur Ashe Stadium almost empty, Ferrer finished off Nadal at 1:50am Wednesday. They approached the latest ending ever at the US Open in 1993, Mats Wilander closed out Mikael Pernfors at 2:26am. 

Late nights are something of a tradition at Flushing Meadows. Fans often stayed until the end, cheering on the likes of Jimmy Connors and Andre Agassi. But can too late become too much? 

I think its great, former Grand Slam finalist Mary Joe Fernandez said. Its the US Open and its almost the only place it happens. 

Tracy Austin twice won this championship and saw the late shows as part of what makes this tournament special. 

I think night matches at the US Open are great for the game, she said. Its only for two weeks of the year.

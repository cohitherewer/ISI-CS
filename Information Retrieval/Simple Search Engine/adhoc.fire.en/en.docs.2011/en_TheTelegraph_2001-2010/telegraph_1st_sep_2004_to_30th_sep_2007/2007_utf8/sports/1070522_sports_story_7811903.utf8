 Platini fear

London: Uefa president Michel Platini says he fears for the competitiveness of European football if national associations are forced to adopt EU rules on the free movement of labour. 

At present, sports associations benefit from exemptions from European Commission competition rules. However, the EU is drawing up a white paper that will undermine the 2000 Nice declaration that acknowledges the special status of sport in society. (Reuters)

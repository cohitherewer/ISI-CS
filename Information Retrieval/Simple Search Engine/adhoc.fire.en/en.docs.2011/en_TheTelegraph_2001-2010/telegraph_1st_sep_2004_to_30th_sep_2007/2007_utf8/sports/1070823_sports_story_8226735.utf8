 Chris Harris ICL-bound

Christchurch: Former New Zealand allrounder Chris Harris has joined the Indian Cricket League (ICL) and two of his ex-teammates, Chris Carins And Nathan Astle, would soon follow him, media reports claimed on Wednesday. 

According to a TV channel, Harris, the Black Capss one-day specialist, has turned down a new provincial contract from Canterbury, the side he led last season, to become the first New Zealander to jump onto the ICL bandwagon. 

His former teammates Astle and Cairns have already quit first class cricket but could be back in action soon at the ICL.

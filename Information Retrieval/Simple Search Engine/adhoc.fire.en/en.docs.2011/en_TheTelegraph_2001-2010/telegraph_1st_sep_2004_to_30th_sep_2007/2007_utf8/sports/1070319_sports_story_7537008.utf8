The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its all over, says Bedi

New Delhi: After Indias loss to Bangladesh, former cricketers feel Rahul Dravids men should forget about winning the trophy and concentrate on getting to the Super Eight. The following are some of the reactions (alphabetically): 

BishAn Singh Bedi: Its all over, what should I say? I dont know how the calculations will be made for the Super Eight, so my guess is as good as yours about whether India will make the next stage. 

Kapil Dev: Forget about winning the Cup. They should concentrate on getting to the Super Eight stage which is looking very difficult now. 

Sunil Gavaskar: Lets give credit where its due. I think Bangladesh were brilliant. 

Kiran More: A good start is very important. I think (Robin) Uthappa should open and Rahul (Dravid) should bat at No. 3 as he is one who can carry the innings. 

Ajit Wadekar: Before this match I believed Sehwag should be tried. But the way he got out, I am in two minds whether he should be persisted with. (agencies)

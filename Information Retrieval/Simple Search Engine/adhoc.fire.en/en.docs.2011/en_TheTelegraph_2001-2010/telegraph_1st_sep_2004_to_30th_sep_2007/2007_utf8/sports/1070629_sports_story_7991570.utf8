 Big 3 rule FTP: Majola

Melbourne: The bickering over cricket scheduling escalated further on Thursday with the South African board accusing its Indian, Australian and English counterparts of monopolising the international calendar and leaving the rest with scraps. 

Directing his anger at Cricket Australia (CA), Cricket South Africa (CSA) chief executive Gerald Majola has said that the Australian team, four-time world champions, owed their world dominance to the CA zealously protecting their home season. 

According to the Future Tours Programme (FTP) that runs till 2011-12, the Australian team does not tour other Test nations during their summer months. 

Even the Indian board, which has been an ally of CSA in recent years, did not escape Majolas fury. There are only three countries which have far more games than anyone else England, India and Australia. Everybody else just gets the scraps of what is left over from that, he said. (PTI)

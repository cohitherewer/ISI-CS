 Sourav, Zaheer gained from omission: More

Vadodara: Former chief selector Kiran More on Monday said Sourav Ganguly and Zaheer Khan had benefited from the time off from international cricket. 

Both Sourav and Zaheer seem to have got back the hunger. Its showing in their performances now, More said at the IPCL ground here. 

Former Team India captain Sourav slammed 98 in his comeback ODI against the West Indies at Nagpur after a break of nearly 16 months. 

In much the same way, More feels Virender Sehwag would come back stronger after missing the entire series versus the West Indies. 

Im sure he will come back into the team and perform better, he said. 

The former India stumper said the process put in place during his tenure as selector was bearing dividends now, as evident in the emergence of players such as Robin Uthappa and Dinesh Kaarthik. 

What you are seeing now is the process we had started. We gave the chance at Indore (against England) to Uthappa and Kaarthik and they are showing their worth now, More said. 

Thats the process we set forth, but unfortunately it got criticised in the media as excessive experimentation. Now other teams are following it, More said.

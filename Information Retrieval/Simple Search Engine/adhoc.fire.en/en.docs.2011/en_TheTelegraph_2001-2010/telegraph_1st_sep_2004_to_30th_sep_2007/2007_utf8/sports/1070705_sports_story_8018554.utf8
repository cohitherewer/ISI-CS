The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 My career wouldve been over at Bagan 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Dipendu 

Calcutta: Dipendu Biswas believes his career would have been over had he continued playing for Mohun Bagan this season. 

Still smarting under the indifferent treatment the Mohun Bagan management had meted out to him, Dipendu who has switched allegiance to East Bengal is determined to prove a point or two. 

I got the feeling while playing for Mohun Bagan that my career was at stake. And I was desperate to get out of the situation, for a new beginning, Dipendu told The Telegraph on Wednesday. 

Dipendu, who became the CFL Premier Divisions top-scorer with 8 goals in helping Mohun Bagan win the title last season, was mysteriously ignored for major part of the remaining season. 

According to Dipendu, some top Mohun Bagan officials were responsible for dropping him. He declined to name anybody, but said that the atmosphere was intolerable for him. 

His fourth association with East Bengal in a decade-old career has come as a fresh air. 

But proving a point, then, has become a part of Dipendus career. He was also thrown out of the Mahindra fold on medical ground, despite a consistently good performance. 

Dipendu is confident that he has still a lot of football in him and East Bengal will be the right platform to showcase what he is capable of. 

Dipendu admitted that training under Bhattacharjee, himself a former Mohun Bagan coach, would help him regain confidence. I had played under Babluda when he was with Mohun Bagan in 1999-2000. We share a great rapport. I feel confident playing under him and Im sure I will prove my detractors wrong, he signed off.

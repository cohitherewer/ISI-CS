 Sri Lankans back home, finally

Colombo: The members of the Sri Lankan cricket squad finally returned home on Thursday after the World Cup to a jubilant welcome after being stranded in London following cancellation of their flight due to air raids by Tamil Tiger rebels on Colombo. 

The team, which reached the final in the Caribbean before losing to Australia by 53 runs in a rain-marred match, was due to arrive here via Trivandrum in India, but managed to get a Qatar Airways flight after the original Emirates carrier pulled out of Colombo after Sundays air raids. 

Mahela Jayawardene and his teammates were due to be driven along the 35km route from the airport to the city in an open truck, but the plans were aborted after heavy rains lashed the city. 

The downpour, however, failed to dampen the spirit of fans who lined up along the teams route from the airport to welcome their heroes. 

The reception this morning has been truly amazing, said Mahela Jayawardene on return. 

Speaking about the final, Jayawerdene said that Australia were quick to grab the first opportunity which put his team on the backfoot. 

We ended up short after putting up a determined effort, the outcome is obviously disappointing. Australians were faster off the blocks than us, he said. 

He said the team was determined to get to the target of 282 in 38 overs but darkness and rain played spoilsport.

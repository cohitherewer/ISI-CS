 Becks will not play for Real again: Capello

 Beckham 

Madrid: David Beckham will not play again for Real Madrid after agreeing a move to Los Angeles Galaxy, Real coach Fabio Capello said on Saturday. 

Beckham will train with the team but he wont play, Capello told a news conference. 

He has always been a great professional but if a player has such an important contract with another club you cannot count on him. You cant have the same enthusiasm when your mind is on other things. 

Beckhams decision to stay until June is his decision, not the clubs. 

Asked if the former England captain would go out on loan for the last six months of his contract, Capello replied: You will have to ask Beckham that question. 

Beckham decided not to extend his contract with Real on Thursday and has agreed a move to the Major League Soccer side when his present deal expires in June. 

The five-year deal taking him to the United States is worth $250 million, one of the most lucrative in world sport. 

Capello also talked about two other players, Brazilian striker Ronaldo and Italian striker Antonio Cassano, who are being linked with possible exits. 

Real president Ramon Calderon said on Friday that Capello did not count on Ronaldo as a first team regular, and that negotiations were underway for a possible transfer. 

Ronaldo is injured at the moment. The club are having discussions with him, nothing more. He is still a Real player, Capello said. Cassano does not enter into my plans. 

Third-placed Real host fourth-placed Real Zaragoza in the Primera Liga on Sunday. Beckham, Cassano and Ronaldo were all left out of the squad. 

Meanwhile, Beckhams focus will be on the Los Angeles pitch, not the Hollywood glitz. 

Forgetting for the moment that Beckhams wife, Victoria, is a former Spice Girl, that they rank Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes among their best friends, and that one of Los Angeles premier talent agencies negotiated his new contract with the MLS Galaxy, Beckham is trying to concentrate on soccer. 

Im coming there not to be a superstar, the 31-year-old Beckham said on Friday via satellite from Madrid, Spain. Im coming there to be part of the team, to work hard and to hopefully win things. With me, its about football. Im coming there to make a difference. Im coming there to play football. 

Dressed in a black suit with white shirt and black tie, Beckham said he hopes to work with American youngsters and keep them interested in soccer when they are finished with youth leagues. 

Im not saying me coming over to the States is going to make soccer the biggest sport in America. But I wouldnt be doing this if I didnt think I could make a difference.

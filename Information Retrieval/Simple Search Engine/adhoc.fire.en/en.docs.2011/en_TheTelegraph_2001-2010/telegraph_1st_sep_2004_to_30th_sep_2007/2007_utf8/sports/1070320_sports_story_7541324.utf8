 You can never write off India: Atapattu 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Port of Spain: Its no surprise that the focus has already shifted to Indias battle against Sri Lanka. For Rahul Dravids men, Fridays match will turn out to the final, long before the grand finale on April 28 in Barbados. 

The Sri Lankans, too, are feeling the heat but do not want put extra pressure on themselves thinking about the game. They intend focusing on their next game against Bangladesh on Wednesday. 

Maravan Atapattu believes the Indians will come back hard at them. They just had a bad day in office against Bangladesh You can never write India off. Even in 2003 they started off badly and then went on to reach the final. You cant afford to relax against them, the former captain told The Telegraph. 

The experienced Sanath Jayasuriya, however, is keeping a cool head. We will stick to our game plan. Theres no point in thinking about what will happen against India. This is no time to set goals Lets take it match by match and focus on the basics, he said. 

Muttiah Muralidharan is though oozing confidence. All teams have come here to winIf things fall into place we can have a good World Cup too. Theres no point thinking about one particular match. The team that plays well on a given day will win, viewed the champion off-spinner. 

Chaminda Vaas also cannot take his thoughts away from the subcontinental clash. We will have to play to our strengths and get the basics right.... 

The Indians are a very good side and will be determined to bounce back. It will be a tough game. You need to enjoy the battle and not be worrying about it, the veteran pacer remarked.

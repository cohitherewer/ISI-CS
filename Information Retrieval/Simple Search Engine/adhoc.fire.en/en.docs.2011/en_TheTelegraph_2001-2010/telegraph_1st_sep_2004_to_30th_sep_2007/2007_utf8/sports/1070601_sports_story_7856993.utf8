 Federer rages at Opens heart of darkness

 Federer after his victory over Ascione 

Paris: Top seed Roger Federer was furious with French Open officials who scheduled his second round match to start and finish in the murky Paris gloom. 

The world number one, who needs a Roland Garros title to complete a Grand Slam, rounded off his 6-1, 6-2, 7-6 (10-8) over French wildcard Thierry Ascione just before 9:15 pm (1915 GMT) with Court Suzanne Lenglen almost in darkness on Wednesday. 

When we shook hands, I told him I couldnt see him anymore it was so dark, said Federer. 

The conditions were shocking. I know they want to get the matches over and done with but what I dont like is that they know Im the favourite and they think I should win in straight sets. Lets get Rogers match over and done with, then hes happy, he has a day off. 

But what if it doesnt turn out this way. I would be very upset. I already wasnt happy playing so late. 

I hate playing into dawn. I can hardly see the ball. You start stressing out. I cant believe other players were still playing after me because it was so dark. 

Federer was referring to Frances Edouard Roger-Vasselins five-set win over Radek Stepanek which didnt finish until 9:30 pm. 

The Swiss star said the situation reminded him of his heartbreaking semi-final defeat to Rafael Nadal in 2005 which was played in similar dismal conditions. 

On that occasion, Federer wanted the match called off for the day. (AFP)

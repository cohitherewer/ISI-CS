 Lack of practice a worry for Sarwan

John Collis 

Caribbean cricket is entering a new era under Ramnaresh Sarwan, who has replaced the retired Brian Lara as captain. Such is the treadmill of the international game that the West Indies preparation for the first Test at Lords on Thursday consists of a three-day match on the best batting wicket in England, in Taunton beginning Saturday. 

 That is, if the drizzle relents, and the forecast is not optimistic after a sun-baked start to the season. 

Its a concern, Sarwan said. Since the World Cup we havent played too many games back home. A bit of club cricket. And the conditions here are totally different. But we are a professional group and we have to adapt. 

David Moore, the new coach, is similarly philosophical. We will play with the cards were dealt, is all the Australian would say about the shortest preparation for a big tour, which could end up as a few days indoors. 

Lara leaves a vacuum behind him. As Moore put it: If you take a man out of a team whos scored 11,953 Test runs, thats a big gap. 

Were not going to get a replacement thats as good as Brian Lara, thats the bottom line. Having said that, weve got guys who are going to put their hand up and do their best for West Indian cricket. 

Sarwan is aware of the task ahead. West Indies cricket is in a bit of a turmoil, he said. It is important for this group of young lads to move our cricket forward. 

Everyone is in good spirits. Both England and the West Indies are under pressure after a poor World Cup, so I think this is the opportunity for both teams to revive themselves.

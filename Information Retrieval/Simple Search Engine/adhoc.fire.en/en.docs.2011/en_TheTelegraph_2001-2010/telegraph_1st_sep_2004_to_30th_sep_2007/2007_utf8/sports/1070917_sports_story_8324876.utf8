 Belgian hattrick for Kimi

 - Alonso finishes third, cuts Hamiltons lead to two points 

 Kimi Raikkonen after his win on Sunday 

Spa-Francorchamps: Kimi Raikkonen won the Belgian Grand Prix for a third time in a row on Sunday, leading a Ferrari one-two to revive his title hopes. 

Brazilian Felipe Massa finished second, 4.6 seconds behind the Finn, with McLarens double world champion Fernando Alonso finishing third to cut teammate Lewis Hamiltons overall lead to two points. 

With three races remaining, 22-year-old Hamilton has 97 points to the Spaniards 95. Raikkonen, celebrating his 13th career win and fourth of the year, is on 84 with Massa taking his tally to 77. 

If any proof were needed that the gloves were off between the McLaren drivers, whose team was stripped of all their 2007 constructors points and fined $100 million on Thursday for their part in the spygate row, Alonso forced Hamilton off the track coming out of the first corner. 

Ferrari have mathematically clinched the Formula One constructors title, subject to any appeal from McLaren against their penalty in the next week. 

Ferrari, celebrating their third one-two of the year over the last five races, now have 161 points. Second-placed BMW-Sauber are on 90 with 54 remaining to be won. McLaren would have had 177. 

The last race of the European season, and first in Belgium since 2005, had a familiar winner in Raikkonen at the longest circuit on the calendar in the previous two editions. 

The Finn led from pole position on a sunny afternoon in the Ardennes, with Massa slotting smoothly into second place and the McLaren drivers producing the early fireworks as they scrapped for third. 

With Hamilton almost alongside, Alonso forced his teammate wide onto the runoff. 

The Briton still came back but was unable to get his revenge with the first four at the chequered flag reflecting the starting order. 

Germanys Nick Heidfeld was fifth for BMW Sauber with countryman Nico Rosberg sixth for Williams. 

Australian Mark Webber collected two points for Red Bull while Finlands Heikki Kovalainen took eighth place for Renault.

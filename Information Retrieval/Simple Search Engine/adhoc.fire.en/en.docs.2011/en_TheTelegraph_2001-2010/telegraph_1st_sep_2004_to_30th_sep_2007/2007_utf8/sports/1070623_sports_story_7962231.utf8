 Jeev tied 21st

 Jeev Milkha Singh 

Munich: Jeev Milkha Singh may not have found many fairways, but he scrambled well enough to compile a tidy three-under 69 in the first round of the BMW International Open at the Golfclub Munchen Eichenried. 

The Chandigarh golfer, fresh from a 36th place-finish at the US Open at Oakmont, was tied 21st. Compatriot Jyoti Randhawa (70) recovered superbly from a poor start to shoot a 70 while Shiv Kapur had a 72. Randhawa was tied 29th and Kapur 61st. 

Portugals Jose-Filipe Lima (65) eagled the last hole to take one-shot clubhouse lead and was later joined by Raphael Jacquelin, who matched that score. They were one clear of Paul Broadhurst, Marc Farry and Fernandez Castano, who shot 66 each. 

Randhawa had a nightmarish start with bogeys on his first two holes, but he recovered very well in the closing stages of the round. 

He birdied the sixth and then had back to back birdies on 15th and 16th to ensure he was under par. However, he dropped a shot on 17th, only to land an eagle on the 18th. 

Kapur had two birdies on the front stretch and two bogeys on the back nine to card an even par 72. 

Jeev, who started on the 10th, shot four birdies and had a bogey on the fifth. The birdies came on 11th, 17th, first and sixth while he missed a birdie on the par-five ninth hole. 

Jeev managed only four of the 14 fairways, but reached 13 greens in regulations and needed 28 putts. 

He displayed some good chipping and wedge shots as he made pars on four of the five occasions he missed the greens.

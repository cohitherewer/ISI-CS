 Pak board to review ban on Illyas

 Miandad feels the PCB has over-reacted 

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) will review the ban on Mohammed Illyas from entering Lahores Gaddafi Stadium after he tendered an apology for threatening the national selectors. 

The move comes after former captain Javed Miandad said the PCB had overstepped its authority by banning Illyas in the first place. 

Illyas, a former Test cricketer and father-in-law of batsman Imran Farhat, was banned after an argument with selectors over the openers omission from the side for the Abu Dhabi one-day series against Sri Lanka. 

The board has decided to review the ban on him. It is no big deal and everything will be settled. Illyas called up the board chairman and apologised for his behaviour, a PCB official said. 

After learning about the ban, Illyas had threatened to go on a hunger strike in front of the Parliament in Islamabad. 

Miandad, meanwhile, said: How can the board insult any former Test player in such a manner. The PCB runs on money earned through the players. They should not forget this. 

If they felt Illyas had behaved badly, they should have called him and spoken to him and warned him about his conduct, not impose a ban without informing him, he said. (PTI)

 Boxer gets 7-year term for burglary

 Hector Camacho

Biloxi (US): Hector Macho Camacho was sentenced to the maximum seven years in prison Monday for burglary, but the eight-time world boxing champion could avoid spending time in a cell. 

Harrison County Circuit Judge Steve Simpson suspended six years of the sentence and said Camacho could serve one year under house arrest if authorities in Puerto Rico agree to monitor him. That would be followed by two years probation. 

The deal would allow the 44-year-old Camacho to continue working. But if he violates any of the conditions set at sentencing, he would have to serve the entire seven years. 

I am deeply sorry, Camacho said to the judge and offered apologies to boxing fans and the people of the southern state of Mississippi, according to a story posted on a website. 

The judge declined to hear a motion to dismiss a drug charge filed January 6, 2005, in Biloxi. Authorities say they found 10 pills of Ecstasy in a casino hotel room where Camacho claims he had stopped to use the restroom. A trial on the charge is set for this month. 

Simpson set bond on the drug charge at $75,000. Camachos previous bond had been revoked May 7 during a plea hearing after a bail bondsman complained that Camacho still owed him money and had not stayed in touch since his release. 

Camacho could again be released on bail in a few days depending on cooperation from Puerto Rican officials.

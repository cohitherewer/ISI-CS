 Rahamatulla dreams big

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: After winning the mens 100m title in the state athletics, Rahamatulla Molla is now looking to make his presence felt in the forthcoming inter-state athletics meet to be held in Bhopal in mid September. 

The 20-year old, whos making a comeback almost after eight months, is ready to bend his back for it. 

After getting a job in the Calcutta Police, Rahamatulla had to go for a six-month training programme which forced him to skip practices. 

My training meant I missed my practice sessions. I almost lost my touch I had to start from scratch, Rahamatulla said. 

Rahamatulla has not yet fully recovered from an old knee-injury. He,however, feels it wont affect his performance. 

Coach Karthik Chandra Nath, too, sounded optimistic about his ward. 

He is now more determined to perform after getting the job I know he will be successful, Nath said.

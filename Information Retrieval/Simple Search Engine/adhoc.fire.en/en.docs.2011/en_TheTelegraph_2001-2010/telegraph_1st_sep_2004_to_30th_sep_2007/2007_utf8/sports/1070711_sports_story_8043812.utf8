Jakarta: Indonesia forward Bambang Pamungkass second-half strike gave the Asian Cup co-hosts a 2-1 victory over Bahrain in a lively Group D opener on Tuesday. 

It was Pamungkas who sealed Indonesias win 18 minutes into the second-half. The home team had struck first in the 14th minute through Budi Sudarsono. The visitors then drew level in the 27th minute after a cross from the right ricocheted off several players before Sayed Mahmood Jalal tapped in from close range. The win marks revenge for Indonesia, who were beaten 3-1 by Bahrain in the 2004 Asian Cup in China. 

In a Group C encounter in Kuala Lumpur, China stormed to an emphatic 5-1 victory over Asian Cup co-hosts Malaysia on Tuesday.

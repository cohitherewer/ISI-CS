 A damp build-up to Trent Bridge battle

 - SECOND TEST 

 Sourav fit, India to field unchanged XI

Nottingham: An unusual record is going to be scripted on Friday: Rahul Dravid and Michael Vaughan will toss without having had a look at the Trent Bridge wicket in the lead-up to the second Test! 

Thanks to unrelenting rain, the wicket remained covered on Wednesday and Thursday and the captains are going to pray it has no demons. 

The other batters too. 

Moreover, neither India nor England have been able to train outdoors. No matter how good the facilities at the England amp; Wales Cricket Boards National Academy in Loughborough, indoor nets are never a substitute for whats out in the open. 

That, then, is the bizarre build-up to what could be the defining Test of the three-match npower series. The first, at Lords, ended in a dramatic draw. 

According to the forecast, the weather will be fine on Day I, but the ground has taken so much water that there are doubts over a timely start even if theres no rain from early on Friday. 

Two factors need to be noted. That Trent Bridge doesnt have the drainage facilities which exist at Lords and, secondly, the water table is always high because of its proximity to the river Trent. 

Our preparation hasnt been ideal, but its the same for both teams... Vaughan, who was brilliant (197 as an opener in the only innings) in the last India versus England face-off here, remarked. 

[That drawn Test, five summers ago, had seen kid debutant Parthiv Patel quickly grow up into a man. In fact, he played a crucial innings of an un- beaten 19 (84 minutes) on the last afternoon. Today, hes wearing the India A colours.] 

One expects interruptions in England... It gets more difficult for the batsmen... But one has to be prepared and also learn to embrace and enjoy it, Dravid said when his views were sought on the possibility of yet another stop-start Test. 

Vaughan, for his part, disagreed with a suggestion that the Lords draw was actually a defeat for England. We played great cricket and, on the final day, averaged just under 16 overs an hour... We came away with a lot of positives... The Test was a great confidence-builder. 

He added: We had a young team with inexperienced bowlers, but still managed to put the experienced Indian batsmen under pressure... (Sachin) Tendulkar and Dravid didnt get many runs, but theyre capable of bouncing back... 

Dravid accepted that a draw is never really a good result, but did count for much given the circumstances (behind by 97 on the first innings). Were not behind in the series, unlike the last time we came to Nottingham... We wouldve liked more runs at Lords, but took positives in the bowling department... 

Talking about pressure, Dravid commented: One is being judged all the time... Theres responsibility and theres pressure... Ive always felt the same pressure to perform... If one doesnt, theres going to be criticism. 

As with any other form of cricket, a handsome start makes the job so much easier. If Rudra Pratap Singh surprised England at Lords, then the accuracy and consistency of James Anderson plus Ryan Sidebottoms aggression caused disarray in the Indian camp. 

Trent Bridge is Sidebottoms home ground. His County debut had been for Yorkshire, though. 

Yuvraj Singh, meanwhile, has been named in the Team India XII, but The Telegraph learns there wont be any change. Sourav Ganguly is fit he batted (indoors) on Thursday afternoon, against the bowlers and, then, the bowling machine. 

Im not in discomfort... Im available for the Test, Sourav maintained. Hed skipped Wednesdays nets owing to stiffness in the back. In the last Test here, Sourav had fallen for 99 in the second innings. Hed been the captain then. 

England are set to retain their XI as well.

 Im to blame for Cup failure: Vaughan

TELEGRAPH ONLINE

 Michael Vaughan at a press conference on Wednesday 

England captain Michael Vaughan says he is baffled by the reaction to his comments about Andrew Flintoffs misdemeanours at the recent World Cup and insists only he is to blame for the sides poor performance. 

Vaughan was Tuesday quoted as saying that Flintoffs drunken antics in the Caribbean changed the whole atmosphere in the England camp, and they eventually went on to exit the competition at the end of the Super Eight stage. 

However, far from blaming Flintoff for his sides poor showing in the tournament, Vaughan Wednesday said that he should shoulder full responsibility. 

If anyone is to blame it is Michael Vaughan, not Andrew Flintoff, he said. I will never single out one player for the debacle. 

Speaking ahead of the third Test against the West Indies, which begins at Old Trafford Thursday, he said: It really is a bit baffling how it has ended like this. One word has changed the whole context for a Test match. I never used the word Fredalo. As soon as you mention that, you are pinpointing one person 

I just want to win this series. We want the team to continue where it left off (at Headingley). We could win the series this week and thats where our focus lies. The team hasnt been affected. 

Vaughan said that Flintoff was not likely to welcome his comments, but insisted it would not harm their close personal relationship. 

I will see him later on for dinner, he said. We are good mates and this has been blown out of all proportion. 

Im sure he wasnt best pleased, but some of the headlines were quite startling. 

Vaughan was involved in a delicate damage-limitation exercise on Tuesday night when he rang up Flintoff at home in an attempt to bridge a potential dressing-room rift following his criticism of the allrounder. 

Vaughan and Flintoff have the same agent, former Lancashire batsman Neil Fairbrother, and have taken the field together for England for much of the past eight years. Their relationship is understood to have strained during the Ashes tour, when Flintoff was criticised for poor captaincy, and Vaughan for crowding Flintoffs space. The phone call may determine how the dressing-room dynamics function in future. 

Vaughans comments were branded despicable by Lancashire chief executive Jim Cumbes, but the Yorkshireman is adamant it will not stop him enjoying the forthcoming Test in Manchester.

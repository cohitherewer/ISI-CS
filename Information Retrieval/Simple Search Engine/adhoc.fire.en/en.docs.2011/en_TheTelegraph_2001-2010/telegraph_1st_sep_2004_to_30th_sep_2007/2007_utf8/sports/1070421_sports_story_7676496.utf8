 Bashar: We need to learn from mistakes

Bridgetown: Bangladesh skipper Habibul Bashar plans to weigh up his options in one-day cricket after his team finished their World Cup campaign with a 99-run loss to the West Indies on Thursday. 

I think Im going to play a few more years in Tests and I am planning to think about my one-day career when I get home, Bashar said. 

Bangladesh had unexpectedly reached the second round after a stunning win over 1983 champions India in the group phase. But the youngest Test nation soon got a reality check after winning just one of their six Super Eight matches albeit against South Africa. 

Bashar himself failed with the bat, totalling just 105 runs in eight innings at an average of 13.12. 

Asked whether the responsibility of leading the side had affected his performance, he said: I shouldnt give any excuses. I did not perform well and definitely did not have a good World Cup. 

When you are leading a team, youre under extra pressure. You need to cope with it. 

Despite his own failings, the 34-year-old urged his young batsmen to learn from their Caribbean experience. 

Bangladesh top-order batsmen caved in against the pace of Daren Powell and Corey Collymore on a bouncy Kensington Oval pitch chasing 231 for victory in their last Super Eight game. 

We need to adapt to this bounce a bit. We need to learn quickly from our mistakes, Bashar said. 

We had some good days and some ordinary days as everyone could see. We had only one good game and six bad games. 

It didnt show what we are capable of. 

They managed to finish seventh in the Super Eight in their maiden second round appearance, ahead of debutants Ireland due to better net run rate after losing to the associate team. 

Bashar praised coach Dav Whatmore for the teams progress. The Australian is expected to leave the team after playing a key role in their progress since they failed to win a match in the 2003 World Cup. 

He is very much respected by the players, Bashar said. 

No one really disagrees with him, which is very important for a coach. 

He gave us lot of confidence. He was really wonderful for us in the last four years. 

Man-of-the-Match Ramnaresh Sarwan said it was a difficult pitch to start an innings but once he had spent some time, he became comfortable. 

I concentrated at batting till the end and we looked to accelerate at the right time, the Guyanese right-hander added.

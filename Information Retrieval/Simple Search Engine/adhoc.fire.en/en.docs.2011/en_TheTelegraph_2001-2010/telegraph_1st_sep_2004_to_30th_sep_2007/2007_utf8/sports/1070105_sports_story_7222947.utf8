The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ive got to wait for next chance: Harbhajan

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Cape Town: You shouldve been playing here, is what somebody told Harbhajan Singh as he sat in the majestic lobby of the team hotel on Wednesday night. That, in fact, is a common enough sentiment in Cape Town. 

Harbhajan could only smile weakly and thank the well-wisher. Later, in a brief one-on-one with The Telegraph, he said: This is the first tour after my maiden one to Australia (1999-2000) that Ill be returning home without playing a Test... Ive got to wait for the next chance... 

The acute disappointment shows, but Harbhajan didnt wish to comment on matters of selection. Its an understatement, though, that Indias first hattrick-getter in Tests is being missed in the decider at Newlands. 

Harbhajan has 238 wickets from 57 Tests.

 CAS clarification sought on Thorpe

Melbourne: Fina confirmed on Saturday that it has lodged an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on a doping test conducted on swimmer Ian Thorpe last year which revealed abnormal levels of two banned substances. 

A French sports newspaper reported on its website on Friday that Thorpe, who retired from swimming last November, provided a sample that showed abnormally high readings for testosterone and luteinizing hormone. 

According to the report, the Australian Sport Anti-Doping Authority (Asada) was aware of the results but chose not to proceed because of a lack of evidence. 

The Fina Doping Control Review Board (DCRB), consisting of experts on doping issues and directors of several Wada approved laboratories, considered the findings of this sample as an adverse analytical result, Fina said. 

Meanwhile, Swimming Australia (SA) has launched a vigorous defence of Thorpe. SA executive director Glenn Tasker slammed Finas handling of the issue and said Thorpe would have felt he was hit by a lightning bolt when he first heard of the report on Saturday. 

Those people who know Ian will know that whatever this finding is there will be a reason for it, but I know Ian is vehemently opposed to any sort of performance-enhancing drug, Tasker told a press conference. (Agencies)

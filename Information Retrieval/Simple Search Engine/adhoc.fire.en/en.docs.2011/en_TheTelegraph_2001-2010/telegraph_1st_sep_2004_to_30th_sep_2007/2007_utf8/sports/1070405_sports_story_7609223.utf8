 Liverpool rout PSV 3-0 

London: Liverpool won their second straight away game in the Champions League, beating PSV Eindhoven 3-0 Tuesday in the first leg of the quarter finals. 

Bayern Munich twice came back with goals from Daniel Van Buyten to hold six-time European Cup champion AC Milan to a 2-2 draw, giving the German team two away goals heading into next Wednesdays second leg. 

Steven Gerrard, John Arne Riise and Peter Crouch scored for Liverpool, which won their fifth European Cup two seasons ago. 

Gerrard jumped over the back of teammate Dirk Kuyt in the 27th minute to head in a cross from Steve Finnan. Kuyt had looked as if he was going for a shot, but he ducked in time for Gerrard to knock the ball past PSV goalkeeper Gomes. 

Riise made it 2-0 in the 49th, controlling a poor clearance from Timmy Simons with his chest in the centre of the field and then sending a long-range shot past the diving Gomes. 

Finnan set up Crouch for the third goal in the 63rd, crossing into the centre for the tall England forward to head in. 

Gerrards goal was his 15th in the European Cup, making him Liverpools all-time leader in the competition. The Liverpool captain has scored 19 goals in all European competition, trailing only Ian Rush and Michael Owen. 

In the other match in Milan, Van Buyten first equalised for Bayern in the 78th minute and scored his second goal in the third minute of injury time with a volley. 

Andrea Pirlo gave Milan the lead in the 40th by looping a header over Bayern goalkeeper Michael Rensing. 

Kaka again put Milan ahead in the 84th from the penalty spot after Lucio took down the Brazil playmaker a minute earlier. (AP)

Paris: Two-time Grand Slam champion Amelie Mauresmo was upset in the third round of the French Open on Saturday, losing to Lucie Safarova 3-6, 6-7 (3-7). 

Mauresmo also lost to Safarova while trying to defend her title at Melbourne in January. 

The 27-year-old Frenchwoman has never reached the semi-finals at Roland Garros in 13 attempts since her debut in 1995. She said she was still not fit after having her appendix removed in March. The fact is that there was no miracle today, Mauresmo said. I mean, Ive been struggling for weeks now. Coming here to the French Open, I didnt really know what to expect. 

Maria Sharapova reached the fourth round of the French Open for the fourth time in her career, rallying from 1-4 in the second set to beat Alla Kudryavtseva 6-1, 6-4 despite a bothersome right shoulder. 

Two-time defending champion Rafael Nadal defeated Albert Montanes 6-1, 6-3, 6-2 in his third-round match. 

Mauresmo led 3-0 in each set. But she double-faulted for the eighth time to fall behind 0-2 in the tie-breaker, and a long backhand gave Safarova three match points. Safarova won when Mauresmo returned her serve into the net. 

At 4-3 in the first set, the tournament doctor came on centre court to treat Mauresmo, who then left for several minutes to take a medical break. When she returned, the top of her right thigh was wrapped. 

Safarova will next play Anna Chakvetadze. The ninth-seeded Russian beat No. 21 Ai Sugiyama of Japan 6-4, 6-4. 

Sharapova needed only 28 minutes to win the first set, breaking her opponent thrice. But the second-seeded Russian was broken three consecutive times in the second set, before winning five straight games. 

I was making a lot of unforced errors, Sharapova said. Not a lot of people are going to let me get away with that. Its a good reminder for the future not to let that happen again. 

Sharapova next faces No. 14 Patty Schnyder, who beat Karin Knapp of Italy 6-1, 4-6, 7-5. 

Number 15 seed Shahar Peer of Israel defeated No. 17 Katarina Srebotnik of Slovenia 6-1, 4-6, 6-3, and No. 24 Anabel Medina Garrigues of Spain topped No. 12 Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia 4-6, 7-6 (7-2), 7-5. 

Nadal, who is 17-0 at Roland Garros, saved nine break points in the match against Montanes. 

No. 16 Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus was leading 6-2, 6-2 when Jan Hajek of the Czech Republic retired with an injury to his right shoulder, and No. 6 Novak Djokovic rallied to beat Olivier Patience of France 7-6 (2), 2-6, 3-6, 7-6 (4), 6-3. 

Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden beat Oscar Hernandez of Spain 6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 6-0, 6-1, Igor Andreev of Russia beat Paul-Henri Mathieu of France 7-6 (7-4), 6-0, 6-3, and Carlos Moya defeated Juan Pablo Brzezicki of Argentina 6-1, 6-3, 7-5. 

 Third-seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova 

 of Russia, a finalist last year, beat Dominika Cibulkova 

 of Slovakia 6-2, 6-3. Number 7 Ana Ivanovic of Serbia advanced 

 to the fourth round after beating qualifier Ioana Raluca 

 Olaru of Romania 6-2, 6-0. (AP)

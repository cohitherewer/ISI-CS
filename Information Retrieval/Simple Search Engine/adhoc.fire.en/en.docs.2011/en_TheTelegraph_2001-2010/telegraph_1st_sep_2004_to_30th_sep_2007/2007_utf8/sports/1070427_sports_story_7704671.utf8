 The highlights

 Glenn McGraths three for 18 took his tally in this World Cup to 25 a record for a single edition of the tournament. Teammate Shaun Tait and Sri Lankas

 Muttiah Muralidharan have 23 wickets each 

 McGrath is just two short of his own record of 27 wickets the most in an ODI competition. He achieved this feat during the 1998-99 Carlton and United World Series. Former Australian paceman Dennis Lillee is the only other bowler to have reached the 25-wicket mark in a tournament (1980-81 Benson amp; Hedges World Series) 

 Justin Kemp became the third South African (after Peter Kirsten in 1992 and Herschelle Gibbs in 2003), and sixth overall, to record a score of 49 not out in the World Cup 

 South Africas total of 149 was their lowest in the World Cup. Their previous lowest was 184 vs Bangladesh (Georgetown), earlier this month. 

 Matthew Hayden took his tally to 621 runs and became the second man to aggregate over 600 in a single edition of the World Cup. Sachin Tendulkar holds the record (673 runs in 2003) 

 Ricky Ponting became the third batsman to cross the 500-run mark in this World Cup on Wednesday, Matthew Hayden and Mahela Jayawardene being the others. Before this edition, only Sachin Tendulkar had achieved this milestone that, too, twice 

 Ponting now has 1500 runs in 38 World Cup matches. Only Tendulkar has more (1,796 in 36 matches) 

 Both Ponting and McGrath appeared in their 38th World Cup match, equalling Wasim Akrams record of most caps 

 Aussie paceman Shaun Tait became the holder of a dubious record Having conceded 50 wides in 10 matches so far, he became the only bowler in ODI history to have done so 

 Australia reached their fourth successive World Cup final (1996, 1999, 2003 and 2007) to become the first team to achieve so. Earlier, the West Indies had reached three finals in a trot (1975, 1979 and 1983) 

 South Africa have now lost their third World Cup semi-final out of the five editions the team has participated in. The following is the list: 

1992 lost to England by 19 runs in Sydney 

1999 match tied in Birmingham (but Australia made final by virtue of having a better record in the previous round) 

2007 lost to Australia by 7 wickets in Gros Islet

 Mourinho gives up, almost

 - United overcome two-goal deficit to thrash Everton 4-2

 - Chelsea held 2-2 by Bolton 

 Mourinho 

London: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho conceded Manchester United were very close to Premier League glory after his sides 2-2 home draw with Bolton Wanderers on Saturday and said he felt sad. 

The champions also received a double blow with Germany captain Michael Ballack undergoing ankle surgery on Friday and defender Ricardo Carvalho hobbling off with a knee injury in the first half. 

Asked if the result had handed the title to their rivals, Mourinho said: Almost... and in football almost is always a big question mark. 

Mathematically, theres a chance and when theres a chance, you have to wait... you have to win and you have to wait. 

I think Manchester United at the moment feel very close... They feel very comfortable...They can come to Stamford Bridge and lose, he said. 

United, who recovered from 0-2 down to beat Everton 4-2 on Saturday, are five points ahead of Chelsea with three games to play including a clash on May 9 at Stamford Bridge. 

The teams also meet in the FA Cup final on May 19 and could contest the Champions League final in Athens four days later if they win their semi-final ties next week when Chelsea are away to Liverpool and United visit AC Milan. 

I feel sad, but I feel I have a big game on Tuesday. Thats a good thing, about being in this situation, that you still have a big game so you dont have time to be sad, Mourinho said. 

Mourinho began by resting Frank Lampard, Joe Cole and top scorer Didier Drogba but all three came off the bench against Bolton. 

Lampard was needed to replace Carvalho midway through the first half when the Portuguese centre back injured his knee in a clattering tackle from Kevin Davies. He will miss the Liverpool game.

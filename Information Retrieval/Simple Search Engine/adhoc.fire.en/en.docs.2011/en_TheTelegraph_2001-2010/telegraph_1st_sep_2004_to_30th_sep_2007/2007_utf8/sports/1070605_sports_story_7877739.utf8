 Randhawa finishes at tied 17th

Celtic Manor: Jyoti Randhawa blasted four birdies over the last five holes for a four-under 65 in the final round of the Celtic Manor Wales Open on Sunday. 

The Indian, now 18th on the European Tour money list with 514,402 euros, totalled an eight-under 268 for the tournament to finish at tied 17th. 

Shiv Kapur shot a three-under 66 to sign off at tied 43rd with a total of two-under 274. 

South African Richard Sterne clinched the title after returning a 65 for a total of 13-under 263. 

Bradley Dredge bogeyed the 18th to lose the chance of becoming the first Welshman to win his national title. 

Dredge had set up a victory chance after a dismal start with three successive birdies from the 15th but missed a six-foot putt for par on the last to return a 67 and finish at 12-under. 

He tied for second place with Singapores Mardan Mamat (62), and Danes Soren Kjeldsen (65) and Mads Vibe-Hastrup (66). 

Randhawa started well with a birdie on the second hole but was pulled back by two dropped shots on the third and fifth. A birdie on the ninth helped him turn in even par. 

On the back nine, Randhawa parred the first four holes and then went on a birdie-spree. He gained a shot on the 15th before hitting a hattrick of birdies from the 16th to the 18th holes. 

Kapur had his best day in a long time. He needed 29 putts in his round of 66 that had four birdies and just one bogey, on the 11th. His birdies came on the fifth, 12th, 14th and the 16th. (AGENCIES)

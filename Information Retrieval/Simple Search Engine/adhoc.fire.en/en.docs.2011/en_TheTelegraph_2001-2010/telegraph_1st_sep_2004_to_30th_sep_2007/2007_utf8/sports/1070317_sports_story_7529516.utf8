 Bills to beef up security

Georgetown: Guyanas Parliament has passed three bills to strengthen security for the World Cup, including one giving foreign security agents special protection under local laws during the seven-week tournament. 

The South American nations security legislation was passed late Thursday in the 65-member House with few objections from opposition benches, interior minister Clement Rohee said Friday. 

Under the so-called Visiting Forces Bill, foreign agents will form part of a special regional task force to protect against security breaches during the sports biggest event. Some of the international agents, including bomb detection experts from India, are following specific teams from venue to venue. 

Another law clears Guyana to accept special help to minimise international crimes, including terrorism, from international agencies like the FBI and Scotland Yard, while another legalises special visa requirements during the tournament to ensure hassle-free travel. 

All Caribbean host countries are required to pass similar legislation for the tournament. (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Jayawardenes captaincy made the difference

 - India end up losing a match they should have won

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Rajkot: Some were surprised when Mahela Jayawardene got the first International Cricket Council Captain of the Year (2005-06) award. At the Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Ground on Sunday, the Sri Lankan showed just why he got that honour. 

Kumar Sangakkara scripted a MoM award-winning 110, Malinga Bandara bowled superbly and there were very tidy contributions from others as well, but Jayawardenes handling of resources arguably made the biggest impact in the second ODI for the Hero Honda Cup. 

Indeed, getting the seasoned Sanath Jayasuriya to bowl the last over, with India needing 11 (three wickets in hand) to go 1-0 up, turned out to be a masterstroke. 

Anil Kumble, who has to contribute with the bat, was run out going for the second run off the first ball. No runs accrued from the next two before Mahendra Singh Dhoni hit his only boundary on the fourth ball. He was out to the very next one and poor Sreesanth was left trying to get a six off the last ball. 

He managed nothing and, so, the Sri Lankans won by five runs. The match should actually have been pocketed by India. 

The Sanath move worked, but it could have gone the other way... I have, in the past, given him the ball in tough situations and Sanath has done his best, Jayawardene told The Telegraph. 

Asked whether hed actually planned to have Sanath in the last over or the circumstances influenced the move, Jayawardene answered laughing: Well, Id known I would have to use him somewhere at the end... While handing the ball, I said it would be fine even if the match finished in two balls... Sanath smiled... 

While the Sri Lankans were ecstatic, the gloom in the Indian camp reflected in captain Rahul Dravids face. Of course, it didnt help that on a seaming track, he had to play both specialist spinners as Zaheer Khan pulled out owing to a sore shoulder. 

Ajit Agarkar and Irfan Pathan werent fit (as also Yuvraj Singh) in any case. 

We kept losing wickets regularly and nobody whod got settled played a big innings, like Sangakkara... We didnt chase well and there are lessons to be learnt, is what Dravid had to say. 

He defended his decision to field (the Sri Lankans would probably have done the same) and didnt have harsh words for Kumble, who was hammered by Sangakkara and Fervez Mahrooof at the death. 

Dravid didnt find anything wrong with comeback man Virender Sehwag either. He looked okay till he got out (for 19)... But, yes, this had been an opportunity to play a big innings... 

It was a tight game, but one we ought to have won, he added. 

Sourav Ganguly top-scored with a classy 62 (he quite likes Rajkot), but gave it all away when he could have strolled to a hundred. Sachin, who unleashed some of the most wow-wowing shots, made 54. Even he cant be pleased at the manner in which he got out. 

The former captains added exactly 100 for the third wicket. Later, Dhoni and Dinesh Karthik put on 66 for the sixth. In Dravids opinion, Karthiks dismissal (235 for six) was the turning point. 

According to Jayawardene, though, turning point No.1 had been Sachins return to the pavilion (129 for three).

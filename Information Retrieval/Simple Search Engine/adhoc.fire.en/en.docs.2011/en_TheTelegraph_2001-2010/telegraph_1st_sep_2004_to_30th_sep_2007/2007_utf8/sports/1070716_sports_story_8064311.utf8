 La Paz exempted

Maracaibo: South American soccer federations have unanimously agreed to exempt La Paz from a ban that disallowed international soccer matches above 3,000m, defusing one of the last controversies over the restrictions that sparked outrage in Andean nations. 

Fifa president Sepp Blatter said in a statement on Saturday that Conmebol officials unanimously approved Bolivias request. 

In May, Fifa announced a ban on international matches played at more than 2,500 metres above sea level, a decision that ruled out several Andean cities. (AP)

 Paes wins, Sania loses

London: Leander Paes had a smooth passage to the mens doubles quarter finals but Sania Mirza made her exit in the womens doubles at the Wimbledon Grand Slam here on Wednesday. 

Paes and Czech Republics Martin Damm, the fifth seeds, made a quick work of Scott Lipsky and David Martin of the US to record a 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 victory in the third round. 

The Indo-Israeli combine of Sania and Shahar Peer, however, bowed out despite a strong comeback after losing the first set to love against top seeds American Lisa Raymond and Samantha Stosur of Australia. 

Lisa and Samantha lost the second set in tiebreak, but either side of it, they won 11 out of 12 games to win 6-0, 6-7 (4), 6-1 in the third round.

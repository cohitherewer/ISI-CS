 India better placed this time: Wright

Port of Spain: Former India coach John Wright feels Rahul Dravid and Co. are better placed this time than in the 2003 World Cup when they reached the final. 

They are further ahead than we were in 2003. We had a tough tour of New Zealand prior to the World Cup and at this stage last time out, we lost to what was virtually a Natal third side, Wright said. 

India are well ahead of that. They have also beaten Sri Lanka at home. At this stage they are better placed, he was quoted as saying in the media. 

The former India coach was impressed by the team handing over nine-wicket thrashing to hosts West Indies in their final warm-up game on Friday. 

The one-dayers didnt go well but the team will have remembered the conditions. They will remember how the wickets behaved. Is it better to chase runs or put them in? You need to do the research, he said. 

Wright was in charge of Team India during the last World Cup in South Africa when they won nine matches at a stretch before going down in the final to Australia. Sourav Ganguly was the captain during 2003.

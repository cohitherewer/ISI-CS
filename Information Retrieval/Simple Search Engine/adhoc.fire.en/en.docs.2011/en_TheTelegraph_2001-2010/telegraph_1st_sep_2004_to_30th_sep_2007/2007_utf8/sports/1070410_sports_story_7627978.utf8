 It is a joke, says Akram

 Wasim Akram

New Delhi: Calling the BCCIs move of curtailing players endorsements a joke, former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram Monday said the Indian cricket establishment appeared to be mocking players by treating them like kids. 

[The move, however, will be reviewed by the BCCI.] 

Its a joke the way the BCCI is limiting players from signing endorsements. You cant be treating senior players like Sachin (Tendulkar) as kids, said Akram. 

If some senior players have advised the board to stop endorsements, then it is wrong. The jealousy factor is very clear. 

As a cricketer, I looked forward to playing for my country. If you are good enough, endorsements will come. Its not the money but the recognition that matters. Of course, money should not affect your game, but form and endorsements are not related. Can you tell David Beckham that all your endorsements are being withdrawn because you havent scored a goal in two years? he said in a TV interview. 

Akram said cricket was a mental game and players needed to feel secure about their financial stability. 

Financial stability is important for athletes. Cricket is a mental game and a player will perform only when he is mentally comfortable that his efforts are being rewarded. The BCCI must rethink its decision, he said. 

Akram, however, lauded the idea to persist with Rahul Dravid as captain for the next three tours starting with Bangladesh on May 10. 

Its a bold decision. The couple of senior players who were dreaming of being captain have been put in their place... BCCI has taken a good decision to retain Dravid. 

Dravid is a good captain and he is improving. He may be lacking in confidence but he will get better. Under him, India will settle down as a team. It might take a couple of years but eventually the results will be good. 

Akram also praised the BCCI for making Ravi Shastri the cricket manager for the Bangladesh tour. 

Players like Ravi should be more actively involved. Ravi is a players man, likeable and knows what to do. His 15 years in the media will be an advantage. Whatever happens, happens for the better and Ravis coming, even for a short span, will help. Maybe in future, there is a bigger role for him in Indian cricket. 

Akram also said the decision to offer Greg Chappell the directorship of the National Cricket Academy was brilliant. So what if he failed as Team India coach? Greg has a lot to offer. He is an organised man and young players will learn Aussie aggression and passion from him. Indian cricket needs the hunger for success and who better than Greg to instil that?

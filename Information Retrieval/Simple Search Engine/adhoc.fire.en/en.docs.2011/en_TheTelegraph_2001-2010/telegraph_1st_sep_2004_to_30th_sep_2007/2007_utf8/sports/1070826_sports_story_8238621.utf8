 Lalus advice

Varanasi: Railway minister and Bihar Cricket Association president Lalu Prasad advised the warring officials of the Indian cricket board and the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL) to organise competitive tournaments between their teams in the interest of the game. 

Both BCCI and the ICL should organise competitive tournaments pitting their teams against each others to improve the skills of the cricketers, Lalu Prasad said at Sarnath while replying a query. Lalu Prasad also suggested that the best cricketers irrespective of whether they played for the BCCI or ICL should represent the country. 

On using the Railways stadiums, he said the authorities had no problem in renting their stadium to any organiser if it paid the fees. (PTI)

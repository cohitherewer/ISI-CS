 I didnt join ICL for money, says Yousuf

Karachi: Pakistans record breaking batsman Mohammed Yousuf, who was in news last month for joining the ICL, insisted that he did not join ICL just for money but because of other reasons. 

I didnt join the ICL for money. If it was about money I have been getting lucrative offers to play county cricket. If it was about money I can earn more in Pakistan, Yousuf said on Monday. 

The right-handed batsman indicated there were other reasons for his drastic decision. He said he would disclose them after meeting with the chairman of the PCB on Wednesday in Lahore. (PTI)

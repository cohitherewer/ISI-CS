 Inconsistent giants in first-day, first-show

Kingston: Two of the most inconsistent sides in international cricket open what could be an unpredictable World Cup when hosts West Indies face Pakistan on Tuesday. 

Brian Laras men had been showing signs of improvement in recent months but Fridays nine-wicket warm-up defeat to India was a reminder that they are a team that can easily press the self-destruct button. 

Lara was one of only three batsmen to make double figures as his team were skittled out for just 85 and the skipper conceded his team had a chronic tendency towards batting collapses. 

Although demanding greater application and focus from his batsmen and more intensity from his bowlers, Lara has also defended his team from critics who suggest they have a carefree attitude to the game. 

This a team that over the past few years has beaten everyone else and we have played some very good cricket but we have been unpredictable, he said while conceding his team have to learn how to cope better with pressure. 

A capacity crowd at Sabina Park in the Jamaica capital will provide plenty of pressure and record-holding batsman Lara will have to cope with more than his share. 

He is the main source of runs for the Caribbean side and is also keen to crown his years of captaincy with a successful tournament. 

The good news for Lara is that, prior to the debacle against India, two of his frontline batsmen Jamaicans Marlon Samuels and Chris Gayle both produced confident knocks against Kenya with Samuels retiring after reaching his century. 

Pace bowlers Jerome Taylor and Daren Powell have looked lively in net practice in the past week and will be expected to provide the penetration that has been lacking at times for Laras side. 

Group D opponents Pakistan were roundly beaten in both a Test and one-day series in South Africa but then cruised to a seven-wicket win over those same opponents in their warm-up on Friday. 

The absence of pace spearheads Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif may have weakened the bowling attack but Pakistan have a very strong batting line-up which could do the job for them. 

Replacements Mohammed Sami and Yasir Arafat, too, have slotted in well. 

With the loss of those two our chances have reduced but other bowlers have come in and worked hard. Pakistan have played in the past without Shoaib and Asif, said captain Inzamam-ul-Haq. 

It is a loss for the team but we have enough good bowlers to continue without them. All the players are in good touch and all the main batsmen have scored runs in the warm-up games, he said. 

Pakistan beat the West Indies in a home series in late 2006 but Inzamam said it would be a tougher challenge in the Caribbean. Beating the West Indies at home is certainly not going to be easy. 

Pakistan won both their warm-up matches last week, but captain Inzamam-ul-Haq is not willing to read too much into these successes. 

That can happen at any time and it does not mean we will underestimate the West Indies side. We will just play the game as it happens, Inzamam said.

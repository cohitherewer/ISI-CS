 Sri Lankans poised for an easy kill

Port of Spain: If ace Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralidharan sends down a doosra in the opening group B match of the World Cup here on Thursday, many Bermudian batsmen will struggle to read it. 

It is not surprising because even quality batsmen in the world have fallen prey to the doosra, a delivery which turns away from right-handers instead of coming in like a normal off-break. 

And Bermuda are not to be blamed as they are making their debut on the biggest one-day stage, especially against a country which claimed the Cup in 1996 and boasts of more than one match-winner in their ranks. 

A mismatch is predicted on a good Queens Park Oval track here, but Bermuda hope to avoid an embarrassment by being competitive. Their recent form suggests that they will struggle to test the 1996 winners. 

We want to play good cricket and earn respect along the way, said Bermudian skipper Irving Romaine. 

The guys are here to play good cricket and to represent their country well. This is our first World Cup and we are looking forward to every aspect of it. 

Sri Lanka, on the contrary, could not have asked for a better outing to begin their campaign and adjust to the conditions before taking on Test-playing nations India and Bangladesh in the remaining two games. 

Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene has already said his teams chances in the event will depend on how quickly they adjust to the conditions in the Caribbean. 

Playing in the sub-continent or away is not a big factor. Its a matter of peaking at the right time, said the Sri Lankan captain. Our prospects in the World Cup will depend on the team getting used to the conditions. 

Sri Lanka have attractive stroke-makers in Sanath Jayasuriya, Upul Tharanga, Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Maravan Atapattu, who are likely to feast on an inexperienced Bermudian attack. 

The Bermudian batsmen also will not find the going easy against left-arm seamer Chaminda Vaas and Muralidharan, who are proven match-winners. 

Coached by former West Indies batsman Gus Logie, Bermuda bagged the wooden spoon at the World Cricket League in Kenya recently when they won just one of their five matches. 

Their form in the World Cup warm-up games was hardly encouraging as they lost to both England and Zimbabwe. Bermuda have just one professional cricketer in batsman David Hemp who has represented English county Warwickshire and now leads Glamorgan. 

They have a tidy left-arm spinner in Dwayne Leverock, who may be carrying extra weight but is known for keeping batsmen silent. He will be tested against a big side for the first time. 

The tiny island nation gained a place in the World Cup two years ago by finishing fourth in the ICC Trophy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Buchanan admits receiving India offer

Melbourne: John Buchanan turned down a potentially lucrative offer from India, but the outgoing Australian coach has not entirely ruled out a return to international coaching in the future. 

Buchanan confirmed that he was indirectly approached before leaving for the World Cup by Indian officials, who were keen to gauge his interest in succeeding Greg Chappell as their coach after the World Cup. 

[A Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds: BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah, however, said he was not aware of such a move. I dont know if any such approach was made. This is the first time I have heard about it. ] 

But after almost eight years as the coach of Australia, Buchanan was not willing to take up another international assignment and, accordingly, did not show an interest in the Indian offer. 

There was some indirect contact from India, Buchanan was quoted as saying by an Australian daily on Friday. 

But, at the moment, I am looking for new challenges as a mentor coach and speaking to Cricket Australia and the Australian Sports Commission about that, as well as considering a move into corporate coaching. 

Yes, there is still some interest (in international coaching). But and its a big but it would very much depend upon my family. 

I really want to be around for that period of (my childrens) schooling. But that probably takes me to my late 50s, and if I would like to specifically be involved in the game, maybe Ill have passed my used-by date by then. 

Buchanan will leave the game as Australias most successful coach. 

His tenure will also be remembered for its relentless pursuit of innovation, including the appointment of an American base-baller as fielding coach and last summers pre-Ashes boot camp. 

At the end of the unsuccessful 2005 Ashes campaign, Buchanan had considered stepping down from his post, which proved to be an inspired move. Since then, Australia have reclaimed the Ashes 5-0 and completed an undefeated World Cup campaign. 

It is a fairytale, he said, adding: After the Ashes in 2005, I looked at whether or not I was really required and had to answer those questions. 

But the last three tournaments the Champions Trophy, the Ashes and then the World Cup to win all three of those is an unbelievable finale.

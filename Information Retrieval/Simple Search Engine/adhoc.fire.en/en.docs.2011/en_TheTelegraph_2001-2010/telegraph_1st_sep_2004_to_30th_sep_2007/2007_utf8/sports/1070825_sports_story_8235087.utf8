 Fleming asked not to take ICL plunge

Christchurch: New Zealand Cricket (NZC) has advised Test captain Stephen Fleming not to join the breakaway Indian Cricket League (ICL) and look for better ways instead to drop curtains on his illustrious career. 

Fleming has been offered to captain a side in the rebel ICL. But the long-serving New Zealand skipper is reportedly mulling retirement from international cricket to join the cash-rich league in India. 

Reacting to the development, NZC chief executive Justin Vaughan got in touch with Fleming in England and asked him not to take the ICL plunge. 

 I just said to him this is not in the best interest of New Zealand cricket, Vaughan was quoted as saying by a New Zealand daily. 

I believe a player of his stature and whose legacy is so magnificent deserves better ways. Ive spoken more as a friend, as a friend who happens to be the chief executive of New Zealand Cricket, he said. 

Apart from Fleming, the Black Caps trio of Chris Harris, Nathan Astle and Chris Cairns are on the ICL radar, while pace spearhead Shane Bonds name also did the rounds initially. 

Vaughan also admitted that the board would need a policy to stop an exodus of players. The NZC needs to come up with a concrete policy on how to approach this. Obviously it is an unsanctioned and unofficial tournament so that is fully clear, but we need to have a policy to work with. 

Vaughan said the breakaway league would do no good to cricket in New Zealand but admitted everything would depend on what stance the ICC takes. 

You would have to say it is in the best interests of New Zealand to be a strong member of the ICC family because out of that relationship we derive significant amounts of our income. So to disassociate ourselves from the ICC would not be a sensible move, he said. (PTI)

 Himachal complete formalities 

 Ranji Plate Final 

Cuttack: Himachal Pradesh became the Ranji Trophy Plate champions after beating Orissa by nine wickets in the final at the Barabati on Thursday. 

After bundling out Orissa, who were 202 for eight overnight, for 216 in the second innings, Himachal scored the required 57 runs for the loss of just one wicket on the final day. Both teams have qualified for the Elite Division of the championship in the next season. 

Having conceded a first-innings lead of 160 to the visitors, Orissa were in deep trouble as they were ahead by just 42 runs with only two wickets remaining in the morning. 

Mediumpacer Vikramjit Malik polished off the innings by claiming the wickets of overnight batsmen Haladhar Das (51) and Sourav Sehgal (6) soon after play began on Thursday. 

Malik captured four wickets in the second innings conceding only 63 runs while Vishal Bhatia and Sandeep Sharma claimed two wickets each.

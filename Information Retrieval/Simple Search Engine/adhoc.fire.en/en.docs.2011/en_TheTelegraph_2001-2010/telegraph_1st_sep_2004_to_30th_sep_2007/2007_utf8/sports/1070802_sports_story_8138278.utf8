 Materazzi: Zidane refuses to meet me 

 The Zidane-Materazzi head-butting incident during the World Cup final 

Berlin: Italy defender Marco Materazzi says

 he has tried several times to arrange a meeting with Zinedine Zidane, but the

 Frenchman who head-butted him in the 2006 World Cup final has always refused

 to meet him. 

I am at peace with myself. I have tried several times to meet Zidane to put all that behind us, but he has refused. Thats his problem, Materazzi said in an interview to a German magazine published on Wednesday. 

Zidane was sent off following the head-butt to Materazzis chest at Berlins Olympic Stadium last July. The Frenchman claimed the Italian had taunted him and made crude remarks about his family. 

Materazzi said: Its clear that many people see me as the aggressor, but like Zidane I was punished by Fifa. 

The 33-year-old Inter Milan player said someone at the top of world football had ordered him to be suspended for two international matches, but he would not give the persons name. 

With Zidane off the pitch, Italy went on to beat France in a penalty shootout. Zidane retired after the match. (AFP)

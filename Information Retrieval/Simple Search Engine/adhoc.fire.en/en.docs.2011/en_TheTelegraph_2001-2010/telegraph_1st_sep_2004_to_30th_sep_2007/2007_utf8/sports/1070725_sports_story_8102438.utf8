 Liverpool launch legal battle for Heinze

MARK OGDEN in MACAU

Manchester United and Liverpool are heading for a courtroom showdown after the Merseyside club increased their efforts to sign defender Gabriel Heinze. 

Three days after United manager Sir Alex Ferguson insisted that he would not sell the Argentine to the clubs arch-rivals, Liverpools manager, Rafael Benitez, on Monday said he had drafted in lawyers in an attempt to bring Heinze to Anfield. 

Its clear hes a player we like and hes a very good player. Thats the reason why they dont want him to leave for us, Benitez said. We made an offer which they rejected. The lawyers are now working on it and so we have to wait. 

Liverpool met Uniteds valuation of Heinze last week with a 6.8 million bid. However, Ferguson, having assured the 29-year-old that he would be allowed to leave this summer for the right price, made any transfer conditional on Heinze moving abroad, or to a club unlikely to emerge as rivals for domestic honours. 

Juventus and Real Madrid are also monitoring the situation. 

Ferguson hit back at Liverpool by revealing that the Old Trafford club was investigating the circumstances surrounding their pursuit of Heinze. 

He suggested on Monday night that the conduct of Heinzes representatives had become a key issue. There hasnt been any change in our stance because Heinze is not going to Liverpool as far as I am concerned, Ferguson said.

 Juventus back in Serie A

Milan: Juventus beat Arezzo 5-1 in the Serie B on Saturday to clinch promotion to Serie A, 10 months after being docked points in the match-fixing scandal and demoted. 

Alessandro del Piero and Giorgio Chiellini scored two goals each, David Trezeguet added a fifth. Antonio Floro Flores got Arezzos goal with a long-range shot. 

Juventus, who were penalised nine points and relegated in July, lead the second division with 82 points 10 more than third-place Napoli with three games to go. Genoa are second with 74 points. 

In Serie A action, a second-string AC Milan side lost 2-3 at home to Udinese on Saturday when the whole first team took a rest ahead of the Champions League final. 

Milan defender Alessandro Costacurta, 41, converted a penalty in his final game for the club before he retires and becomes an assistant coach at the San Siro.

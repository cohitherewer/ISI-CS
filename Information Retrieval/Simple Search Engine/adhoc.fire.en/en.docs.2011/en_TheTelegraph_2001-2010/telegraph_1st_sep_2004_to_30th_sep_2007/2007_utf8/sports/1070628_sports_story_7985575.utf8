Calcutta: New-ball bowlers Ishant Sharma and Ranadeb Bose reached Belfast on Wednesday afternoon. 

However, theyll only be checking into the Team India hotel on Thursday as the property couldnt spare even one room when they arrived. 

They had to be accommodated elsewhere It couldnt be avoided, cricket manager Chandu Borde told The Telegraph. 

While Bose is an absolute rookie, Sharma made his Test debut in Bangladesh last month. 

Both had been picked for next months Test series in England, but had to advance their journey after many bowlers fell ill in the lead-up to the three-match series against South Africa. 

According to Borde, though, everyone is now fine. 

Everyone looked fine this morning As its a day off, some chose to make a trip to the city centre I believe everybody is going to be available for the second ODI versus South Africa. 

Thats on Friday. 

The first, on Tuesday, saw the South Africans post a four-wicket win. 

Borde, by the way, pointed out that Rakesh Patel and Arjun Yadav (whod been asked to rush from Liverpool and Eglington, respectively) had returned to base. 

They were called just in case we needed a substitute or two on the field Its not that they wouldve played yesterday (Tuesday), he said. 

Whatever, it still was quite dramatic.

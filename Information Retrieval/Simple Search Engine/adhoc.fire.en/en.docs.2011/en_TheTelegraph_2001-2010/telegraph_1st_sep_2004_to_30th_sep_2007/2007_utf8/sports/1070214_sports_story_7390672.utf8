The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No secret dope tests, says PCB

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB)

 has denied a media report that secret dope tests have been carried out on Shoaib

 Akhtar and Mohammed Asif. 

Terming the report, published in a leading daily in Pakistan, as utterly baseless, a PCB release said that dope tests will be conducted on all West Indies-bound Pakistan players on Friday, after the squads return from the tour of South Africa. 

According to the newspaper report, not only have secret tests been conducted on the pace duo, both tested positive for nandrolone yet again. 

Shoaib and Asif, it may be recalled, were banned for testing positive for nandrolone last year, before getting a reprieve from a PCB appeals committee. 

Wada, the world anti-doping body, has challenged

 the appeals committees decision to let off the pair and the case is sub-judice

 at the Court of Arbitration for Sports.

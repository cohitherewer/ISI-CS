 Ashraf seeks legal opinion in England

Karachi: PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf has flown to London to consult legal advisors on the case filed by Wada in the CAS over the exoneration of fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif from doping charges. 

A PCB official said Ashraf would also be meeting with specialists who have examined the knee injury of Akhtar and talking to the bowler himself. 

He is seeking the latest position on the Wada appeal in the CAS which has appointed a three-member review panel to find out if the PCB letter challenging the jurisdiction of the CAS to hear the Wada case is admissible, he said.

 NZ pump in record 39 goals

Buderim (Australia): New Zealand men created a world record by destroying Papua New Guinea 39-0 in the Oceania hockey Olympic qualifying tournament here on Wednesday. 

They broke the record set 24 hours earlier by Australia when they defeated the same team 35-0. 

Shane McLeod, New Zealands coach, set out to break the mark and send a message to the Aussies. 

We went for the record. In qualifying tournaments in the past, Australia had demoralised teams by putting them away that we also put away But not by the same margin. 

So it was nice to send a little bit of a message out there to Australia, McLeod said. 

Meanwhile, Australia squeezed past New Zealand 1-0 through Madonna Blyths 63rd minute goal to lead the womens tournament. 

Australia coach Frank Murray complimented NewZealand. 

When New Zealandhave a full team as they do now, they are in the top group of teams in the world, Murray said. 

It was a hard open game and it will be totally different when we get to Beijing because we cannot play at that pace there. 

Meanwhile, Fiji eased past Papua New Guinea 5-1 in the second womens match on Wednesday, with Emalina Semisi scoring three in the first 15 minutes. 

Fiji coach Hector Smith was pleased with the way his team started each half but disappointed as they let Papua New Guinea back into the match. 

We started very quickly in each half but got into a lull and New Guinea got the upper hand before we came back into the match, Smith said. 

New Guinea had a bad game yesterday but they came back well today.

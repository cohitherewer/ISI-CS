 There is some tension: Lewis

Indianapolis: Lewis Hamilton said on Thursday that his stunning success was creating some tension between him and McLaren teammate Fernando Alonso, says a Reuters report from Indianapolis. 

I doubt he expected me to do as well as I am, but I dont know thats why hes saying what hes saying, Hamilton told a US Grand Prix news conference when asked about a recent suggestion by Alonso that the team favoured the Briton. 

Hes the two-time world champion but he hasnt been really challenged by someone as close as me... so it is a very difficult situation, added the 22-year-old. (Reuters)

London: Roy Keanes promoted Sunderland snatched a last-gasp 1-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur and Sven-Goran Erikssons Manchester City beat West Ham United 2-0 when the new Premier League season opened on Saturday. 

Sam Allardyces first game in charge of Newcastle United ended with a 3-1 victory at former club Bolton Wanderers, with Nigerian striker Obafemi Martins scoring twice. 

Sunderland had new signing Michael Chopra, who netted in the fourth minute of stoppage time, to thank for their winning start. 

Chopra, who joined Keanes side from Cardiff City last month, came off the substitutes bench to rifle home a low shot from inside the penalty area at the Stadium of Light. 

Keane, who steered Sunderland from the relegation zone to the second division title after taking over last season, told TV: I thought the best team won. Another late goal, we had plenty of them last season and hopefully there are more to come...its a happy dressing room in there. 

A stunning 87th-minute free kick by captain Steven Gerrard gave Liverpool a 2-1 victory at Aston Villa. 

Manchester Citys goals came from new signings, following the takeover by former Thai Premier Thaksin Shinawatra, with Italian striker Rolando Bianchi and Brazilian midfielder Geovanni on target. 

There was no room for sentiment for Allardyce on his return to the Reebok Stadium. His side were 3-0 up in under half an hour against a Bolton side managed by his former assistant Sammy Lee. Its a great start to the season for me and the lads, Allardyce said. 

Elsewhere, Blackburn Rovers came from behind to beat Middlesbrough 2-1, Everton were 2-1 winners over Wigan Athletic and promoted Derby County drew 2-2 with Portsmouth.

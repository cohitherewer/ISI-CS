 Kapil: Meet on schedule

Chennai: Indian Cricket Leagues (ICLs) executive board chairman Kapil Dev on Wednesday asserted that the rebel series would go ahead as per schedule notwithstanding the roadblocks being put up by the BCCI. 

On the sidelines of an ongoing camp for ICL players in Chennai, the former India captain said, the tournament would be held with six foreign players in each of the six teams in fray. The selection process of these teams would be transparent and grounds for the matches is not a problem for us. 

We have already identified the grounds. We are not averse to playing matches even in school grounds, he added. 

ICL has plans to own its own grounds in the near future. BCCI has only about 12 grounds (affiliated units) and the rest all belong to the respective state governments. 

Meanwhile, Subhas Chandra which runs the league announced that the company planned to invest Rs 100 crore and Rs 15 to Rs 20 crore have already been spent so far. 

On Rohan Gavaskar joining the ICL, he said, he is one of the 70 players. I will say nothing beyond that. 

On the possibility of his company supporting the Indian hockey league, Chandra said, there is a possibility.

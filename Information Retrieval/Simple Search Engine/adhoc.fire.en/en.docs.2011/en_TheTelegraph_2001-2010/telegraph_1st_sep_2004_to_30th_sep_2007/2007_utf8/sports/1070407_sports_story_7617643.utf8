Mumbai: The Dilip Vengsarkar-headed selection committee will decide on the Team India captaincy, but nothing emerged during Fridays World Cup review meeting to suggest Rahul Dravid wont keep the job. 

Dravid spoke with authority at the review... Hed come with notes and listed whatever he had to say... The mood isnt to see a change at the top, a well-placed source told The Telegraph. 

Its not confirmed, but Dravid may have called for captains having a far bigger say in matters of selection. 

Apparently, the Board of Control for Cricket in India mandarins are quite cut up with some seniors and, so, thats a top reason why the captaincy is unlikely to go back to either Sachin Tendulkar or Sourav Ganguly. 

However, nothing is really cast in stone. 

Dravids appointment had been till the end of our campaign in the World Cup. He succeeded Sourav in October 2005. 

Meanwhile, one understands the seven former captains who were part of the review, didnt discuss the captaincy issue.

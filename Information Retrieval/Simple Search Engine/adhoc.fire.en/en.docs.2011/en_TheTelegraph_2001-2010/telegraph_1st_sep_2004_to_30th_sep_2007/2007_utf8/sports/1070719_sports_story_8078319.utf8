 Mahesh to team up with Nenad

 - Paes may pair with Sania

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mahesh Bhupathi will have a new partner in the years last Grand Slam. The Indian ace, who had planned to play the full year with Czech Radek Stepanek, will team up with Serbian Nenad Zimonjic in the US Open. 

Bhupathi couldnt play the mens doubles in Wimbledon as Stepanek pulled out at the eleventh hour with an injury. 

Stepanek has dropped to 130 in singles, his focus is to get back in the top-50, Bhupathi told The Telegraph during a visit to the city on Wednesday. 

He wont be playing too much doubles now. 

Zimonjic, who had reached the Masters Cup final with Leander Paes in 2004, split with regular partner Fabrice Santoro of France recently. 

The 10-time Grand Slam doubles winner may have to find a new partner in mixed doubles, too, as Sania Mirza is likely to partner Leander Paes in New York. 

That was the news at the start of the year I havent yet spoken to Sania about it, said Bhupathi, not sounding too confident.

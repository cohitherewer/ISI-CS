 Jeev climbs to 28th

 Jeev Milkha Singh 

Loch Lomond: Jeev Milkha Singh carded a four-under 67 in the second round to climb up to 28th spot at the Scottish Open golf tournament on Friday. 

The Indian, after a tentative first five holes which included one bogey, found his rhythm and rolled in five birdies. 

Compatriot Jyoti Randhawa dropped a late bogey on the 17th and finished with a two-under 69 to be tied 41st. Shiv Kapur managed only a four-over 75 to miss the cut. 

Jeev, seven shots behind co-leaders Jose Manuel Lara (65) and Gregory Havret (64), opened with four pars and dropped a shot at the fifth. But he got into his stride and birdied the sixth, eighth, tenth, 13th and the 15th. 

I am finding my rhythm and am happy at the progress. I love playing tough golf courses and thats what I expect at Carnoustie next week, said Jeev, who made the cuts at Augusta Masters and US Open earlier this year. Jeev has made the cut in each of the four majors he has played. 

Randhawa birdied the fourth, 13th and the 16th, but dropped a bogey on the 17th. 

Singaporean Mardan Mamat and Yang Yong-eun of South Korea also made the cut with rounds of 72 and 68, respectively. 

Havret, the 2001 Italian Open winner, and Lara, the reigning Hong Kong Open champion, are at 10-under. The duo has Phil Mickelson (68) and Ernie Els (65) hot on their heels. 

Mickelson was at nine-under 133 and sole third, while Els was at seven-under 135 and tied seventh. 

European Open champion Colin Montgomerie and world No. 11 Retief Goosen were among those to miss the cut, finishing one over on 143. Last years winner Johan Edfors of Sweden was another casualty on 149. (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 ...Rumblings within BCCI

 - Honeymoon drama in New Delhi and 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Its not as high pitched as 

 the ongoing honeymoon drama in New Delhi, featuring the 

 Left and the Congress, but there are rumblings within the 

 Mumbai-headquartered Board of Control for Cricket in India 

 (BCCI). 

 The BCCI president, Sharad Pawar, intends addressing 

 that on Monday evening when top officials meet in Mumbai 

 to discuss a storm-unleashing letter from vice-president 

 Lalit Modi. 

That meeting has been called on the eve of the SGMs where, among other things, theres a proposal to amend the constitution and make provision for a president-elect. 

Modi, who heads the Rajasthan Cricket Association, has suggested that if the president-elect is to be identified a year before he assumes office, then the next secretary and treasurer (perhaps even the joint-secretary) should also be known at the same time. 

 According to The Telegraphs 

 sources, Modis move is actually aimed at making the 

 most of what seems a difficult bargain. Difficult because 

 Pawar is intent on getting the Vidarbha Cricket Association 

 chief, Shashank Manohar, chosen as the president-elect. 

Manohar (vice-president, Central) is an old Jagmohan Dalmiya-basher and has been Pawars most trusted lieutenant since he came to power in November 2005. 

Modi, obviously, is himself keen on the top job. If that remains out of his reach, then its understood he wont mind the secretarys post. Apparently, in such a scenario, Modi would like joint-secretary Mohinder Pandove to be made the treasurer. 

Its not confirmed, but N. Srinivasan (the current treasurer) isnt in Modis scheme of things. Incidentally, all along, Modi has been seen as somebody close to former president Inderjit Singh Bindra. 

If Pawar wont compromise on Manohar, then indications are that he has to concede ground on the issue of the next secretary and treasurer. 

Modi is vice-president from North, but is eligible to stake his claim for the presidency as he heads one of the constituents of Central. 

By rotation, its going to be Centrals turn for the top job. 

Clearly, all isnt well within the ruling group and it can only get worse for Pawar if the Manmohan Singh government falls. After all, a huge majority of those paying obeisance are doing so because hes an important Union minister. 

 Not too long ago, the same so-called cricket administrators 

 had been offering their salaams to Dalmiya, who must be 

 following the developments very keenly.

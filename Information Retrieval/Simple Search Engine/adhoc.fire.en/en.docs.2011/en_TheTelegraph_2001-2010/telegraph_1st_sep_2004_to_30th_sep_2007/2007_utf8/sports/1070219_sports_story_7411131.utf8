The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We can beat India: Bashar

Dhaka: Bangladesh have set themselves the goal of upsetting some their more fancied opponents in their World Cup group to reach the second round, team captain Habibul Bashar said Sunday. 

Our target is the second round, Bashar told a news conference on the eve of his teams departure for the Caribbean. Beating Sri Lanka and India will be a tough job, but not impossible. 

Coach Dav Whatmoresaid his charges had a realistic chance of reaching the second round. We went twice to the World Cup without any expectations, Bashar said. Now, we have beaten big teams. We are a much better and mature side. 

Under Whatmore, who was appointed coach after the last World Cup, Bangladesh have beaten big names like India, Sri Lanka and even world champion Australia, as well as winning one-day series against Zimbabwe and Kenya in recent years. (AP)

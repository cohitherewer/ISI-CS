The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I kept things simple 

Bridgetown: Some hours before he took the field for the last time in an international match, Glenn McGrath preached the virtues of simplicity. 

What had he done consistently well which gave him an enviable tally of 563 Test and 380 ODI wickets (till the start of the World Cup final)? 

I always said that my approach was simple. The less complicated you make things, the less things can go wrong, he said. 

So I have always felt if you could bowl 99 balls out of a hundred which are generally hitting the deck, you will take wickets. Its worked well for me over the last 12 or 14 years. 

Another quality which stood McGrath in good stead over the years was his ability to read batsmens mind as Jacques Kallis discovered ruefully in Wednesdays semi-final. 

I can see if a batsman is coming at me and change at the last second, he said. I go into matches with very good game plans and execute them reasonably well. 

McGrath, who took a wicket with his final ball in Test cricket to complete a 5-0 Ashes whitewash over England at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG), said he would probably have retired then had it not been for the World Cup. 

Im happy to be walking away from the game I think its in a good state, there are a lot of good young fast bowlers coming through. At the end of the day, I am happy with what I have achieved and what the team has achieved, he said. 

I think probably the first thing I will do is get away from it for a while and unwind and see what options come up and see what I want to do. 

Captain Ricky Ponting paid tribute to Australias most dependable bowler for more than a decade. 

Theres no doubt we are going to miss him, hes one of the all-time greats of the game , he said. 

I dont mind saying I shed a tear at the SCG after the last Test this year when he played his last game and Warney (Shane Warne) played his last Test. Theres going to be lots of good memories.

 MCC suggests fewer ODIs

London: Concerned about player burnout, the world cricket committee of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) has said the congested international calendar should have fewer number of one-day Internationals. 

The current international playing programme, which sees some sides playing over 90 days of top level cricket per annum, is too congested with, in particular, too many one-day International matches, the committee said in a statement issued Monday. 

Worried over players fitness, the panel said long series involving hectic travelling result in injuries to cricketers and it was time that the games administrators took a serious note of the matter. 

While lucrative for national boards, one-day cricket can be of a higher intensity and involves more travel than tests. The elongated series often result in tired players more susceptible to injury, it observed. 

With the current level of international commitments, players are less likely to be able to appear for their domestic sides, so weakening the standard of competition at first-class level and reducing the attraction of cricket for native audiences, particularly the younger generation, it said. 

Recommending a review of the international calendar, the world cricket committee said a balance should be maintained between financial gain, player welfare and audience satisfaction. 

Among other recommendations, the panel favoured regular monitoring of bowling actions. (PTI)

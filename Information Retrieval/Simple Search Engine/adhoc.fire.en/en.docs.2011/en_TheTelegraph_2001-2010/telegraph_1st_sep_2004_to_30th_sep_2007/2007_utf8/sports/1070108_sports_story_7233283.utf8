 Waqar quits as bowling coach

 Waqar Younis 

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Waqar Younis has resigned as the bowling coach of the national cricket team just a day before he was due to leave for South Africa to join the side for the forthcoming Test series (as briefly reported in Sundays Late City Edition). 

Waqar, in his message to Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf on Sunday, conveyed his decision indicating that he wasnt happy to be with the team only for the Tests and not for the five-match one-day series. 

I have been told that I will only be with the team for the Test series and will return home before the one-day series, said Younis, who was appointed bowling coach until the World Cup in March and April. 

I think it is better for everyone that I should step down from this responsibility at this stage. 

PCB spokeman Ehsan Malik said it had been the team captain and coachs decision to have Waqar only for the Tests and the board had no role in it. 

If he is not happy with the arrangement we cant do anything about it since the team management decided he should only be with them only for the Tests. We had no problems in him accompanying the team also for the one-dayers, Malik said. 

In fact, even now we are willing to honour his contract till the World Cup if he wants to continue. But he should not hold the board responsible for his decision, he said. 

The PCBs version comes as a surprise because Waqar is seen as very close to captain Inzamam-ul Haq and was brought in as bowling coach on his insistence. 

But Inzamam had also got his friend and former teammate Mushtaq Ahmed appointed as the assistant bowling coach of the side for the entire tour. 

Sources said Waqar was cut up as he had been given the impression he would be with the team for the entire tour and he was not happy to learn that Mushtaq was being given this assignment. (PTI)

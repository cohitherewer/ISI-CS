 Chappell, Sehwag had a row in South Africa

 - Television channel claims to quote from manager Chetan Desais report 

 Greg Chappell and Virender Sehwag 

New Delhi: A fresh controversy rocked Indian cricket with a television channel disclosing on Tuesday that coach Greg Chappell and Virender Sehwag were involved in a feud during Indias tour of South Africa. 

Apart from the heated argument between Chappell and Sehwag, there were also serious differences while selecting the team for the Test matches, according to the channel. 

The sensational disclosure comes just two days before the one-day series against Sri Lanka gets underway in Calcutta where Sehwag is expected to make a comeback. The channel, quoting team manager Chetan Desais confidential report to the BCCI, said the argument between Chappell and Sehwag occurred when the out-of-form opener refused to attend a special practice session on the eve of the Durban Test. 

When contacted, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said the managers report was with president Sharad Pawar and he that had no comments to make at this stage. 

I dont want to say anything on it. The managers report is with the president, he said. All I can say is that Sehwag was not dropped because of any disciplinary issue. He was dropped purely on form. 

The report said Chappell and expert bio-mechanist Ian Fraser came to the nets but did not find Sehwag there. Later, Sehwag told Chappell that he did want to practice which angered the former Australian captain. 

Desais report also claimed that paceman Munaf Patel was not fully fit to the play in the third Test and held captain Rahul Dravid largely responsible for the defeat in that crucial match in Cape Town. Desai claimed that physio John Gloster hid Munafs injury till the last, which allowed him to play in Cape Town. 

Giving instances of differences during selection meetings, the team manager said in his report that Dravid insisted on having Sehwag in the team despite his poor form. 

In that meeting, after a lot of deliberation, it was finally decided to drop Sehwag. The next day Dravid, during the practice session, suggested that after seeing the wicket he was of the opinion that it would be a spinners track and he would want to have Sehwag as the next option as a spinner, he said in his report. 

I objected and told Greg, Dravid and Dilip (Vengsarkar) that if it was a spinners track, they could have Harbhajan in the team. Greg mentioned that Harbhajan was not bowling well. At this point I said if Harbhajan is not in the team, then why is Sehwag, who is not batting well, in the team. 

Vengsarkar mentioned to Dravid that if Sehwag failed and India lost the match there would be a backlash back home to which Dravid replied that he was prepared for it, he said. 

Desai, when contacted, declined to comment, saying he had submitted his report to the BCCI president and the matter was closed as far as he was concerned. 

In his observations, Desai said the senior Indian players were not as fit as their South African counterparts. The support staff, specially the trainer and the physio, need to give a report as far as the fitness and the injury of an individual player was concerned from time to time to the Board, he said in his report. 

Desai praised Chappell and said he was doing a wonderful job. Chappell is a gentleman to the core but needs extra encouragement from the Board so that he can make independent decisions. Chappell needs to be given a lot of confidence by the Board, he said.

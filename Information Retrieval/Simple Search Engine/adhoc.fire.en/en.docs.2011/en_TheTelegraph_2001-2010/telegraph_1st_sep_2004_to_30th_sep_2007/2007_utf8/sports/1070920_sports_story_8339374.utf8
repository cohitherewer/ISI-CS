 Yuvraj hurricane: A ball-by-ball blow

Yuvraj Singh walked in at the fall of Robin Uthappas wicket (16.4 overs). The following is a ball-by-ball compilation of his 58 off 16 balls: 

 (16.5) Chris Tremlett to Yuvraj, slightly short, no run 

 (16.6) Yuvraj drives Tremlett uppishly over covers for a boundary 

 (17.2) Yuvraj swings Andrew Flintoff to the leg, a single 

 (17.4) Yuvraj squeezes a Flintoff half-volley with an open face of the bat over point for a one bounce four 

 (17.5) A short Flintoff delivery is hooked away, ball lands two yards in from the boundary between two approaching fielders. Four 

 (17.6) Yuvraj chips Flintoff to long-on, a single 

 (18.1) Stuart Broad to Yuvraj, whipped over mid wicket for a six. 

 (18.2) Yuvraj at it again, no more than a dismissive flick off his legs, six. The ball arcs deep into the crowd beyond backward square leg 

 (18.3) This time Yuvraj steps to leg and smashes the ball over extra cover. Broad helplessly watches another huge six 

 (18.4) Broad goes round the wicket, bowls a filthy wide full toss and Yuvraj steers it over backward point and it clears the ropes again for a six. England have a team meeting 

 (18.5) Yuvraj ,down on one knee, hits Broad over mid wicket for another six. The ball drops into the jubilant crowd. Broad looks like a man who knows he is about to be mauled again 

 (18.6) Yuvraj leans back and smacks Broad over wide mid on. Another scintillating six 

 (19.2) A wide full toss from Flintoff and Yuvraj leaves the ball. Chats with Flintoff 

 (19.3) An improvised chip from Yuvraj into the leg side, 2 runs 

 (19.4) Flintoffs turn to suffer, a full swing over long-off for a six 

 (19.5) Finally he doesnt quite get hold of one and hits a Flintoff full toss into the hands of long-on.

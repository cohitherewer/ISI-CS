 Good start for Randhawa

Paris: Jyoti Randhawa started his campaign in the Open De France Alstom with a brilliant three-under 68 to be tied eighth after the opening round. 

Randhawa was just three shots behind leaders James Kamte of South Africa and Welshman Kyron Sullivan, who shot rounds of 65 each at the par-71 Le Golf National Golf Club. 

Jeev Milkha Singh, meanwhile, returned an even-par 71 to be tied 38th. However, Shiv Kapur made a disastrous start with a four-over 75 to be way down at tied 102nd. 

Randhawa parred the first two holes before striking a hattrick of birdies from third to fifth. (PTI)

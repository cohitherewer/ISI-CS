 End ad-hocism in PCB: Abbasi

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: The natural reaction in Pakistan, to a defeat, is to throw out everybody... Its an attitude which destroys... had been a characteristically candid Bob Woolmer observation before Pakistan got knocked out of the last Champions Trophy, in October-November. 

Pakistans ouster from the World Cup, on Saturday, has seen just about everybody in authority put in papers to pre-empt the sack. 

Captain Inzamam-ul Haq announced he would quit ODIs, some hours after Woolmer paid the ultimate price for a shock loss at the hands of rookies Ireland. Then, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf and the Wasim Bari-headed selection committee have resigned. 

Cricket in Pakistan, therefore, is back in turmoil. Its a shame because, over the years, it has produced some of the most naturally gifted players. 

The question is: Will such wholesale resignations actually help? 

Its definitely not the ideal way forward... In any case, nothing is going to come out of all this as long as the PCB continues to function in an ad-hoc manner... Regrettably, it has been functioning like this for almost a decade, former chief executive Arif Ali Khan Abbasi told The Telegraph. 

Speaking from Karachi, he added: Obviously, answers are needed... How could we lose to what essentially was a club side? But, then, the answers wont mean a thing till the PCB gets back to functioning as an institution... 

[Woolmers view on the PCB had been: In a way, Pakistan is evolving as a country and so are the bodies within it... One needs time to have the stability seen in England and Australias cricket structure...] 

Widely respected as an administrator with vision, Abbasi (the PCBs first chief executive) quit soon after the 1996 World Cup following interference in the bodys functioning from the highest quarters. 

Abbasi could be the man to take Pakistan out of the latest crisis. Its to be seen whether the chief patron, President Pervez Musharraf, turns to him. Musharraf is himself under pressure over the sacking of Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary.

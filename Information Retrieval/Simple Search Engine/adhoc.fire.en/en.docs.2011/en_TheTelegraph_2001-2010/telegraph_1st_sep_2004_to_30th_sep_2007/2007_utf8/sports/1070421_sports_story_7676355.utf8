 Sangakkara support for Murali, Vaas 

St Georges: Sri Lanka wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara has accused critics of double standards after the decision to rest Muttiah Muralidharan and Chaminda Vaas from the World Cup clash against Australia drew flak. 

The two veteran bowlers were left out of the April 16 Super Eight game after both sides had already made sure of their places in the semi-finals. 

Many accused Sri Lanka of cheapening the World Cup by their decision to allow the players to take a breather although both men, veterans of the 1996 World Cup winning team, returned for the win over Ireland two days later. 

Much of the analysis has been ill-informed, offered without great thought or deep understanding of this Sri Lanka team, wrote Sangakkara in his column for a web site. 

Consequently, many of the critics have been wide of the mark in their conclusions. I question whether double standards are being applied here by some pundits. 

Nearly all top cricket playing nations have rotational policies that they put into action during heavily congested schedules. Australia, for example, regularly rest their senior players in group matches once their qualification (and sometimes even before) has been confirmed. 

What then is the difference between resting players in the CB Series or the World Cup? 

Will some of the television experts now calling for ICC intervention do the same when Ricky Ponting or Stephen Fleming or Graeme Smith next rests a strike bowler? I doubt it. 

Sangakkara, preparing for the first semi-final which takes place in Jamaica on Tuesday probably against New Zealand, said decisions are based on whats best for the teams chances. 

Sri Lanka are looking to win their second World Cup title to add to their 1996 victory. 

Some of the critics appear to think that the Australia game was our most important game in the tournament. Why just because we were playing Australia? Thats nonsense. 

The simple fact was it was the least important game of our World Cup. Even the Bermuda game was more important. 

We are here to win the World Cup. Everything we do is focused on that goal. We dont care about morale-boosting victories. 

We do care deeply, though, about making sure we are completely ready and properly prepared when each crunch game comes along. The Australia game was not a crunch game. 

The semi-final against New Zealand on April 24 is. We rested Muralidharan, Chaminda Vaas and Lasith Malinga in the best interests of the individuals and the team. We had to make sure they were at peak fitness and completely rested when we start on the 24th morning in Jamaica. 

All three have minor niggles that benefited from not playing. We are now confident that they will be in the best possible physical shape they could be for the semi-finals. It was a decision were entirely comfortable with. 

Murali and Vaasy are the lynchpins of our attack. They have been for years and they remain so in this tournament albeit with good support from Malinga, Dilhara Fernando and Farveez Maharoof. Giving Australias batsmen a free look-in was not to our advantage if we meet again.

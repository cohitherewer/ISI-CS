 Shastri on pep-up mission

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Building team spirit and restoring the players confidence has been Ravi Shastris priority during the ongoing Team India conditioning camp in the city. The cricket manager has been stressing on the enjoyment factor and is sparing no effort to develop camaraderie among the players. 

The World Cup defeat, obviously, still rankles and there has been a concerted effort to make the players concentrate on the present. Group discussions, with feedback from the players, are being encouraged and Venkatesh Prasad and Robin Singh are playing an important role in such endeavours. 

On Friday evening, most of the players went to watch Spiderman III at Inox. Efforts are also on to make the players feel comfortable with the team management. The days of Greg Chappells strict regimen seem to be over, giving way to an easy ambience. 

Shastri has been personally speaking to the players, seniors and juniors alike. Not just technical details, the sessions have also been programmed to brace them up mentally. 

Not without reason has the services of yoga expert Sukhdev been sought. The players have been reminded about the importance of taking care of the mind along with the body. The techniques, Sukhdev feels, will go a long way in improving their mental strength. 

The players, too, have been responsive to the new ideas. They have felt free to air their views to Shastri and vice versa. Batting in match-like situations on the centre pitch has drawn appreciation. 

Dilip Vengsarkar, chairman of the selection committee, arrived on Friday evening and will be present during Saturdays practice. 

Rahul Dravid, meanwhile, offered prayers at Kalighat temple in the afternoon along with wife Vijeta and son Samit.

Calcutta: Gouranga Biswas sat on the bench for East Bengal in the last season. Overshadowed largely by the big players and partly by his namesake Gouranga Dutta the diminutive striker, a resident of Sodepur, was given only one chance in red-and-gold colours, against George Telegraph in the CFL Premier Division. He was soon thrown into oblivion because he was rendered thinly built. 

The 19-year-old Biswas eventually found a new refuse in Peerless under coach Mihir Bose. The move from a big team to a small one now seems to be inspiring him. Having played two matches for Peerless, Biswas has already proved his worth with two goals. The second one, on Tuesday, was particularly a special one. Against Mohammedan Sporting, playing a match at home for the first time in five years, Biswas spoiled their party, handing Peerless to a surprise 1-0 win. 

Incidentally, his goal against Eastern Railway too had sealed the fate with a 3-2 win in their opening encounter. 

After a goalless first-half, in which Mohammedan Sporting missed sitters in abundance, Biswass header came at a time when the match was just about to tilt towards a bland draw. Seventeen minutes after the changeover, he headed a Zoheb Hassan pass to precision even it did not disturb the nets as the ball passed through a hole. 

The hosts did not realise that, nor did the goalkeeper Nasibul Haque. But Biswas led the Peerless celebration as the referee Udayan Halder ruled it a goal. 

Even the linesmen failed to notice it. The net was tightly tied, leaving a gap at the bottom and the ball just went through it, Halder later said. 

Mohammedan Sporting did gather pace in search of the equaliser, but like in the first half, their strikers, notably, the veteran Raman Vijayan, came a cropper. 

Mohammedan Sporting supporters who turned out in huge numbers, inevitably, vented their ire, hurling stones to the players after the match. The police intervened to pacify them. 

Cursing luck coach Shabbir Ali said: It was just that unexpected goal But theres still a long way to go and we will definitely come back. Ali must be now praying that he has a foreign striker before the situation gets out of control.

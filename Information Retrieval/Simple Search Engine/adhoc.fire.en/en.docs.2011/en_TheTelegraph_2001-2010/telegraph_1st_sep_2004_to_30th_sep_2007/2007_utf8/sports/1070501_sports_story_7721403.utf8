 Mourinho back on the warpath with Benitez

 - Premier League big brothers brace up for the Champions League test

Jos Mourinho has shrugged off the disappointment of effectively conceding the Barclays Premiership title by reigniting his long-running feud with Rafael Bentez before Tuesdays Champions League semi-final, second leg. 

The Chelsea manager, whose team takes a 1-0 lead to Anfield, said that his players were devastated at falling five points behind Manchester United with only three matches left, but he insisted that Liverpool should also be demoralised at what he sees as a dismal league season. 

Bentezs side is 13 points behind Chelsea in third place after a 1-2 defeat by Portsmouth on Saturday. 

Of course, my players were devastated, but Liverpool should be also devastated because they are third and so many points behind and they lost the title in January, Mourinho said. So maybe that makes the game an even bigger game. Its the chance for both clubs to win or at least play a big final. 

Mourinho is also understood to be concerned about the appointment of Manuel Enrique Mejuto Gonzlez as the referee for Tuesdays match, given that Liverpool are managed by a Spaniard and have several Spanish players. 

The Spanish officials appointment is likely to be well received in Liverpool for symbolic reasons, if nothing else, as he was the referee who officiated in their stirring comeback to win the final in Istanbul two years ago, with AC Milan unhappy about certain aspects of his performance. 

Mourinho had no complaints about Mejuto Gonzlezs decision-making in Chelseas quarter final second-leg tie against Bayern Munich the same year. 

Bentez will not take kindly to suggestions that a referee of the same nationality as him could give his team an advantage and is likely to portray Mourinho as a manager feeling the strain. The Spaniard made no attempt to disguise his delight as Chelsea slipped behind in the title race at the weekend, which he believes will put further pressure on them on Tuesday. 

All I know is that they have spent millions and millions and then they need to win trophies, Bentez said. Its clear theyll be under pressure. If they cannot win the league now, they will be under real pressure for sure. The league could be difficult for them and maybe also the Champions League. 

When you play against a team like Chelsea, who have spent more money than anyone else in the world in the last five years, we must be calm and say, OK, if we can beat them, perfect. But if we cannot, we will try to do our best. They are favourites. If you analyse the last five years and the value of each player, then we must be the underdogs. 

Liverpools injury situation is advantageous, however, because Steve Finnan should return from a neck problem to play at right back, while Chelsea continue to run out of bodies. Ricardo Carvalho is a doubt with a knee injury, while Michael Ballack is out after having ankle surgery on Friday at the hands of Hans Mller-Wolfhart, the Germany team doctor. 

Having advised Ballack to postpone the operation until the end of the season, Mourinho was unhappy that he chose to press ahead, but he hopes to have the midfield player back within two weeks. 

Mourinho made a renewed attack on Sunday on Cristiano Ronaldo, questioning his fellow Portugueses education after he had been defended by Sir Alex Ferguson. 

Im not really worried about Sir Alex, Mourinho said. I like him and I respect him. If the digs are not offensive ones in relation to the integrity, the morality, the procedures, for me theres no problem. 

Its not even a game between me and him. Its a game where a kid had some statements, not showing maturity and respect, maybe education, difficult childhood, no education, maybe the consequence of that. That was the reason why I had to give an answer. Sir Alex felt after that he had to protect his boy.

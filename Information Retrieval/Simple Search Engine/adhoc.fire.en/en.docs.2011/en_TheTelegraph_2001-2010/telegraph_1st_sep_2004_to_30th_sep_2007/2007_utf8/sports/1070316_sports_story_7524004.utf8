The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bad day for Indians

Sanya (China): Indian golfers had a disappointing outing at the TCL Classic on Thursday as Thailands Chapchai Nirat hit his career best and course record breaking 11-under 61 to grab lead at the Yalong Bay Golf Club here. 

Gaurav Ghei, the best among the three Indians in the fray, was at tied 56th place with a two-under 70. 

Amandeep Johl (72) and Shiv Kapur (73) were 93rd and 108th, respectively, and were in danger of missing the cut, which is likely at two or three-under. (PTI)

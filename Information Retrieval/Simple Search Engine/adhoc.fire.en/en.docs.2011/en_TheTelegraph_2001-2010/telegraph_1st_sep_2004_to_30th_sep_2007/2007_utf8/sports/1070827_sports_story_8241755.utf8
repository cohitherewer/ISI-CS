Calcutta: An inspired Mohammedan Sporting displayed grit and determination to hold Mohun Bagan goalless in the Premier Division match on Sunday. Carlos Roberto Pereiras boys thus failed to take advantage of the three-point cushion they enjoyed after East Bengal drew against United SC. 

They will now have to remain satisfied with a one-point lead over their arch rivals in the first leg of the championship. 

If goalkeeper Nasibul Haques superb display was responsible for denying Jose Ramirez Barreto and Co. the goal, Seikh Azim also played his part with a strict vigil on the Brazilian. 

Mohammedan Sporting began with a flutter, Paul MacJames Nwachuku combining well with A. Jyothi Kumar. Jyothi was twice in the clear in the first ten minutes, hitting straight to Sangram Mukherjee both times. 

Mohun Bagan took some time to realise that it wouldnt be a cakewalk. As Barreto tried to break free of Azims shackles, Shanmugam Venkatesh, Dharamjit Singh and P.C. Lalawmpuia made their presence felt. 

Barreto almost scored in the 29th minute, lobbing the ball over an advancing Nasibul. The Mohammedan Sporting goalkeeper dived at the last moment to tip the dangerously dipping ball over the bar. Four minutes later, Nasibul came to their rescue again. 

When Paul was replaced early in the second half, it meant the end of Mohammedan Sportings challenge upfront. Mohun Bagan piled on the pressure but failed to make their way through the maze of legs. 

Barretos header off a Dharamjit corner was put out of harms way from the goalline by Rajib Ahmed, then Nasibul denied Ayan Chowdhury a goal by diving to his feet. When the ball ricocheted off the post from a goalmouth melee in the dying minutes it was clear that the goal would remain elusive for Mohun Bagan. 

TEAMS 

Mohun Bagan: Sangram Mukherjee, Habibur Rehman Mondal (Ayan Chowdhury, 68m), Peter Odafe, Anit Ghosh, Rauf Khan, Lalkamal Bhowmick, Lukram James Singh, Shanmugam Venkatesh, Dharamjit Singh, Jose Ramirez Barreto, P.C. Lalawmpuia (Ishfaq Ahmed, 60).

 Outcast who ran with the Hollywood set 

 - Federer eyes elite club that includes Bill Tilden 

MARK HODGKINSON

 Roger Federer 

You might think that Roger Federer would have nothing in common with a man who once ran with the outrageous Hollywood set, was twice imprisoned for gay scandals or immoral offences, lost most of his fortune backing ill-fated Broadway stage plays, and died alone in a rented room with less than 100 dollars to his name. But you would be wrong. 

Some time soon Federer and Bill Tilden are going to be closely linked by the tennis world. When Federer reaches 10 Grand Slam titles won, and he may join that club at this months Australian Open, then he should take some time to consider the life of Tilden. The American also once dominated mens tennis, winning 10 majors during the inter-war years. 

But Tilden was the tennis champion who became an outcast. Tilden, who was homosexual, was shunned after twice being sent to prison, the first time for having sex with a male teenage prostitute, the second time for groping a male teenage hitchhiker. 

This was at a time when it was difficult enough for people to even admit to being gay. Tildens behaviour shocked middle America. 

Everyone in tennis still talks about the others in that elite club who have won 10 Slams or more. We know all about Pete Sampras with his 14, Roy Emerson on 12, and Rod Laver and Bjorn Borg on 11 each. But Tilden is almost the forgotten man, the dirty secret, of tennis history. Some 54 years after his death, an event which tennis largely failed to mark in any way, he is still remembered with something less than affection by his sport. Once an outcast, probably always an outcast. 

The contrast between Federer and Tilden is immense. You often feel like Federers entire life is as expertly controlled as one of those backhands of his. 

Some maintain that Tilden was the finest of all time. There is no argument that, during the Twenties and Thirties, Tilden was the biggest star of tennis. In fact, Tilden alone was tennis back then, and he was arguably the most famous American face across the world. This was a man who became friends with the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Errol Flynn, Greta Garbo, and Katharine Hepburn, occasionally teaching his starry pals some tennis. He also had ambitions, or delusions, of becoming a celebrated actor himself. 

But Tildens life was not just filled with red carpets, and tennis glory, and sepia prints of him holding up trophies. His life was controversial, helter-skelter, colourful, but ultimately extremely sad. Tilden was brash, dapper, arrogant, theatrical, flamboyant, insecure and troubled. 

The Federer of his day, Tilden had all the shots. He had a ferocious serve, and a knowledge of spin which was second to none. Indeed, Tildens mastery of spin and tennis tactics and psychology was shown in the tennis books he wrote, The Art of Lawn Tennis and Match Play and the Spin of the Ball. The second of those titles is still regarded as a definitive tennis text.

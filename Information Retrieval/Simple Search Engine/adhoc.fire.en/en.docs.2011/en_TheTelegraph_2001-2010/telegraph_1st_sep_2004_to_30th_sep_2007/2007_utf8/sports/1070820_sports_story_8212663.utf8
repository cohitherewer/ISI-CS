 Bopanna, Qureshi in title round

New Delhi: Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi stormed into their fourth successive final after a straight set win over Jim Thomas and Steve Darcis in the $50,000 ATP challenger in Bronx, New York. 

The fourth seeded Indo-Pakistani duo beat their unseeded rivals 6-4, 6-4 in the semi-finals of the hard court event on Friday. 

Bopanna and Qureshi will take on American qualifiers Alberto Francis and Phillip King in the finals. 

Francis and King beat the Dutch pair of Robin Hasse and Peter Wessels 6-3 7-6 (4) in the other semi-final. 

Bopanna and Qureshi will be aiming to add a fourth title to the three back-to-back wins in Europe a fortnight ago.

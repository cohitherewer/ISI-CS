 Chopra shares 66th spot

Milwaukee (US): Daniel Chopra had an ordinary start, carding one-over 71 in the first round to be placed at tied 66th spot in the US Bank Golf Championships. 

Chopra started on the 10th hole, where he had a bogey but birdies on 12th and 15th brought him one-under. But then bogeys on 17th and fifth meant he finished one over. 

Chopra, who is currently 99th on the money list, has struggled with his form over the last two months. After making a good start to the season, when he had a top-10 finish at the Honda classic and four other top-25 finishes, he has missed four cuts in last seven starts and withdrawn from one. 

At the top, Jeff Maggert, after missing four cuts in a row, shot a 63 to claim a share of the lead with Zimbabwean Brendon de Jonge. 

Maggert eagled the par-five 15th hole and birdied Nos. 16 and 18 en route to a seven-under-par 63 at Brown Deer Park Golf Course. (Pti)

 Bopanna out in first round

New Delhi: Rohan Bopanna suffered a shocking first-round defeat against Swiss qualifier Michel Kratochvil in the singles event of the $125,000 ATP Challenger series in Segovia, Spain. 

Bopanna lost 3-6, 3-6 in the hard court event on Tuesday. 

The Indian would now look forward to repeat his last two weeks successes in the doubles event, playing alongside Pakistans Aisam-ul Haq Qureshi. 

The duo went on to win doubles titles at Manchester and Nottingham in the last two weeks. 

The third seed Indo-Pak pair have advanced to the quarter finals here. 

Among other Indians in the fray, Mustafa Ghouse and his German partner, Frank Moser, survived a scare from wildcards Guillermo Alcaide and Oscar Burrieza to enter the quarter finals. 

Ghouse and Moser beat the Spaniards 2-6, 7-5, 10-6. 

They will now be up against Kratochvil and Gilles Muller of Luxembourg.

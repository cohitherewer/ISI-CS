 Narains priority still F1

Mumbai: Indias Narain Karthikeyan hopes he can regain a Formula One slot and says Alex Wurzs return to racing has provided him with some inspiration. 

You need to see your options and wait for your turn. Thats how Formula One is at the moment, Karthikeyan said. 

The Chennai-born racer said his priority remained Formula One and that his participation in A1 Grand Prix was to keep himself race-fit. 

My priority is still Formula One, with Williams. I thought Ill do A1 just to keep my racing juices flowing. Im going to be competing in the next three races as well.

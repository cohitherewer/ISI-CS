Chelmsford: India found a saviour in captain Sachin Tendulkar who bailed the side out with a majestic 171 to light up Day II of the warm-up match against England Lions on Saturday. 

Riding the brilliant Tendulkar knock, India finished the second day at 336 for seven after being pinned down to 65 for four in reply to England Lionss first innings score of 413 for eight declared. 

Sachin got out to a tired looking shot just before close when he holed out at deep long off to Owais Shah off Graham Onions whom he had roasted all day. His scintillating 171 came off 235 balls and he hit 26 fours and one six. 

At close, Mahendra Singh Dhoni was unbeaten on 44 and Zaheer Khan was on 18. 

The maestro received great support from Yuvraj Singh (59) and the pair added 140 runs for the fifth wicket. 

Coming in to bat when India had lost Wasim Jaffer (1), V.V.S. Laxman (0) and Dinesh Karthik (5), Sachin took the attack to the Lions and played some spectacular shots all round the park.

He began in right earnest, on-driving Onions to the fence to get into the mood. Then he put him in his place, smashing him to all parts of the field. Sachin repeatedly unleashed some excellent carpet drives with lovely timing. 

He hit no less than seven fours off the pacer who had struck a double blow in his very first over. 

India went to lunch at 63 for three but another blow awaited them after resumption when Sourav Ganguly (14) top edged a pull off Chris Tremlett to offer an easy return catch. 

However, Tendulkar continued undaunted in the company of Yuvraj and the left-hander also looked in good form playing some splendid drives in front of the wicket. 

In the afternoon session, Tendulkar turned his attention to young leg-spinner Adil Rashid playing two glorious cover drives off him before hitting him straight for a towering six off consecutive deliveries. Rashid was immediately taken out of the attack. 

When Onions came back, Tendulkar again displayed his contempt for him, hitting the bowler for two fours through covers and a cut off Ravi Bopara to the point boundary took him to 98. 

Tendulkar reached his hundred to a rich applause in the first over after tea when he took a single off Tim Bresnan following a mis-field at point. It took him 140 balls and he hit 13 fours and one six. 

At the other end, Yuvraj unleashed some of his own delightful shots. Yuvraj duly posted his half-century before playing a wild shot wide outside his off stump to Stuart Broad to give an easy catch to Andrew Strauss at slip.

 Bob not happy with refereeing

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: India coach Bob Houghton is unhappy with the referees decision to award Syria the second goal a minute before the breather. 

I never comment on the referees decision, but I would like to watch the replay of the second goal against India, the coach said. I had a feeling that it was scored from an off-side position. 

Having conceded all three points to Syria, Houghton said he would now be concentrating fully on the match against Kyrgyzstan on Sunday. I am not sure whether Bangladesh can do us a favour, but I would like to make sure that we reach the final. 

Houghton said despite defeat he was happy with the boys. It could have been a draw, certainly. 

He disagreed that a few changes upfront could have brightened their chances. When I am playing for a victory, I would like to field my best team. There is no magical solution involved in it. I am dealing with reality. 

The Indian coach did not read much into the physical superiority of the Syrians. There is no point talking about it, he said. 

That way we would not be able to progress ever.

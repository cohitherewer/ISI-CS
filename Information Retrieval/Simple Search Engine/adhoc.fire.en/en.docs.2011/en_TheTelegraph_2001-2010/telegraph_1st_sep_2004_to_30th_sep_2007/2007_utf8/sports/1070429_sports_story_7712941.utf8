 PCB to shun Inzamam culture 

 Inzamam-ul Haq 

Karachi: Determined not to let the Inzamam culture plague the team anymore, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has decided to strip Shoaib Malik of the discretion to have a final say in team selection while on tour. 

A well-informed source in the board said PCB had learnt its lesson well after the experience with Inzamam-ul Haq, who enjoyed supreme power in the selection of a touring squad or playing XI. 

Accordingly, it has been decided that the selection committee would make the final call while picking a touring squad or even the playing XI, the source said. 

When Inzamam was the captain, the selectors would give him their inputs and views on selection matters but he had the final say and veto power in these matters, said a source. 

PCBs ad-hoc committee, when it approved the appointment of Malik as captain, decided that the team should get rid of Inzamam culture as it had created a lot of problems and headaches for everyone including the selectors. 

The committee also felt that it had led to Inzamams unbridled powers in the team and a lot of faux pas in selection matters which only got worse in the presence of a weak chief selector like Wasim Bari, he said. 

The source also disclosed that the committee had reached a consensus that Inzamam should no longer be entertained although he desired to continue playing in Tests after retiring from ODIs and stepping down as captain. 

The main reason for shifting the power from the captain to the selectors is that some board officials believe Inzamam will try to use his influence on young Malik and a group of players loyal to him to get selected for the Tests. So they had this pre-emptive measure, the source informed. 

He said, in future, the selectors would sit with the captain, coach, manager and vice-captain while selecting a full squad or a playing XI but their decision would be final. 

Which means that the board has given the selectors complete power to override any move by Malik to bring Inzamam into the Test side, the source said. 

The board had also taken note of the fact that senior batsman and vice-captain Younis Khan had developed a mindset to stay away from the captaincy and was even pondering to leave one-day cricket because of the non-cooperative attitude of a group of players, said the source 

Younis earlier this month not only refused the captaincy offered to him but also turned down a chance to fly to Abu Dhabi next month for the three-match one-day series against Sri Lanka. 

Younis had told the selectors he was more comfortable playing for Yorkshire in the English county championship at the moment. 

The board realises that there are other reasons for Younis wanting to distance himself from the team. They also know that when he was captain last year in the Champions Trophy last year in India, a group of players loyal to Inzamam had ganged together and refused to even speak to him, the source said. 

The source said the board had wanted former captain Imran Khan, a great supporter of Younis, to speak to him and make him change his mind on the captaincy. 

But Imran refused saying he was upset with the way Younis had surrendered and would not speak to him on this topic at all, the source added. 

With little cricket for Pakistan before September this year, sources said the real test for the board and selectors would come when South Africa tour Pakistan from September 25 as Inzamam would use his influence to get selected in the Test side. (PTI)

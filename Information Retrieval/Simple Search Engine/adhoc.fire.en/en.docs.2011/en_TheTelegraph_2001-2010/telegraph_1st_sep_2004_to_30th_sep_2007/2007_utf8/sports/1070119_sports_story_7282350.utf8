 Jeev shoots 1-over 73 in Abu Dhabi

Abu Dhabi: Indias Jeev Milkha Singh carded a one-over 73 at the Abu Dhabi Golf Championship on Thursday to end the day in tied 76th place. He had a total of four bogeys to three birdies, which came on the 10th, 14th and 18th holes. The bogeys came on the seventh, 11th, 16th and 17th. 

Other Indians in the fray fared better with Shiv Kapur carding a two-under 70 to be at tied 25th, while Jyoti Randhawa returned a par 72 to finish the day in tied 62nd spot. 

Englands Phillip Archer, meanwhile, went on a birdie blitz to shoot a sizzling nine-under-par 63 and open a three-stroke lead. 

Archer, who shot a round of 60 at the Wales Open last June, made 10 birdies and a solitary bogey to be three ahead of Stenson, South Africas Retief Goosen and compatriot Nick Dougherty. 

Scotlands Paul Lawrie and Australian Richard Green were tied for fifth place at five-under 67 along with Englands Gary Emerson. (Agencies)

Towards the end of the first half, drag-flicker Imran Warsi of the Warriors scored of a penalty corner to give his team a 2-0 lead. 

The Warriors forwards looked all fired up, especially when Australias spearhead of strike Jamie Dwyer was building up some attacking moves for them and exposing the chinks in the weak defence of the Lions at will.

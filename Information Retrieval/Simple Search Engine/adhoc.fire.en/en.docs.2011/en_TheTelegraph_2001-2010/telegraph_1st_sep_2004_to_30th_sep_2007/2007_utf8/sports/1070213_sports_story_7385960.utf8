 Warne amp; Co. under tax scrutiny

Melbourne: Australias top cricketers including Shane Warne are being investigated for apparent tax evasion due to their alleged failure to disclose overseas earnings. 

Warne and other International cricketers have allegedly failed to declare hundreds of thousands of British pounds managed in offshore accounts, a TV report said. 

The investigation is being led by the Australian Tax Office. The players, however, are unlikely to face criminal charges. 

Investigators believe a big part of their English playing and endorsement earnings were in offshore trusts managed by tax haven specialist Philip Egglishaw, the report said. (PTI)

 Randhawa, Ghei to play in Cup

New Delhi: Indian duo of Jyoti Randhawa and Gaurav Ghei will represent the country in the 2007 Omega Mission Hills World Cup, to be held in China from November 22 to 25. 

Course designer Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain, will be seen in action at the Mission Hills Golf Club, which hosts the $5 million event where 28 nations would battle it out for the prestigious title and the imposing World Cup trophy. 

India, represented by Ghei and Shiv Kapur, had heartbreak last year, when they finished joint third as Singapore and Italy, went on to qualify for the event in Barbados. 

Eighteen countries have already confirmed participation this year and a further 10 would join them following qualifying competitions in Asia (Fortis International Challenge) and Latin America (Nations Cup) from September 27-30. 

Apart from Olazabal, other major winners in the fray would include Retief Goosen of South Africa and Mike Weir of Canada. 

Goosen, the two-time US Open champion, and 2003 Masters Champion weir, will announce their partners in due course, while Olazabal has selected buddy Miguel Angel Jimenez to represent the Spanish flag. 

Scotlands Colin Montgomerie will join forces with Marc Warren in an attempt to go one better than last year in Barbados when the same partnership lost out to Germany in a sudden-death play-off.

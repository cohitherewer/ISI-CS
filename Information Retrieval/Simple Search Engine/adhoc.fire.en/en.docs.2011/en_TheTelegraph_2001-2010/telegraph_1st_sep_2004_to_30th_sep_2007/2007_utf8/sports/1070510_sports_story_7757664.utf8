 Dudu for trial in Belgium

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

New Delhi: Sporting Clube de Goas Dudu Omagbemi may have assured East Bengal of switching over next season, but the commitment doesnt figure atop his priority list. 

According to the Nigerian striker, who has already scored 11 goals in the ongoing National Football League (NFL), he would be leaving for Belgium immediately after the last NFL match to attend trials for a first division club there. 

In Belgium, I will attend trials for Waterloo Club, said Dudu. I know its a difficult task, but there is no harm in trying, he said from Goa. 

Dudu feels he has nothing to prove in India anymore. Playing in Europe had always been his dream. Previously, he had offers from MLS side Metro Stars and Greek champions Pananthikos, but couldnt attend their trials because of his contract. 

Dudu is not the only foreign footballer in the NFL to look beyond the Indian shores. Dempo Sports Clubs Nigerian striker Ranty Martins, too, is believed to be going to London to try his luck. 

Already on the shopping list of top teams like East Bengal, Mohun Bagan and Mahindra United for his consistent performance in the last three seasons, Martins would be going to Ireland, where a London-based agent has arranged trials for him in a couple of leading Ireland clubs. 

If Ranty continues to play in India, he will only play for Dempo. Thats the assurance he has given to our top officials, Dempo coach Armando Colaco said. 

The Goan club, however, are already believed to be looking for Rantys replacement. Talks are on with JCTs Nigerian striker Edeh Chidi. 

Club officials are confident that the Nigerian will return to Goa. They might even open talks with Jose Barreto through Dempos Brazilian skipper Beto. 

Meanwhile the home NFL matches of Mohun Bagan and East Bengal have been rescheduled. 

REVISED SCHEDULE 

May 14: Mohun Bagan vs Sporting Clube de Goa (Salt Lake); May 15: East Bengal vs Mahindra United (Salt Lake); May 18: Sporting vs HASC (Goa-Duler); Dempo vs Mohun Bagan (Goa-Margao); May 19: East Bengal vs JCT (Barasat).

 Strauss to lead in first Test

London: Opener Andrew Strauss will lead England, in the absence of regular captain Michael Vaughan, in the first Test against the West Indies at Lords starting on Thursday. 

Matthew Prior was named as wicketkeeper in the 12-man squad announced by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) on Sunday. 

Vaughan is recovering from a broken finger and might have been fit by Thursday, but chairman of selectors David Graveney said his and his co-selectors did not want to take any risks. 

There was a very slim chance of him playing (and) we didnt want to go down the route of injections, Graveney said.

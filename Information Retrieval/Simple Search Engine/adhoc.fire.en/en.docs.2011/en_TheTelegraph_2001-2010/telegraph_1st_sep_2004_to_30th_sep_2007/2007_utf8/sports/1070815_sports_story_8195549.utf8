Toronto: The late withdrawal of leading players from WTA tournaments has reached epidemic proportions, former world number one John McEnroe said on Monday. 

Thirty-years after he played the first of 16 tournaments in Toronto, the fiery McEnroe was still the main attraction on Day I of the Toronto Cup, overshadowing a field including four of the worlds top five women players. 

Its an epidemic in the womens game, McEnroe told reporters. The men arent as bad but it certainly has been an issue. 

Its not one persons fault. Its not just the players, so its not just the tournaments fault, some of it is bad luck. But the way it is set up when you play three, four weeks in a row they (players) are sort of thinking they want to peak at the Open. 

So if something happens where that throws that preparation off, then these are the type of tournaments that get burned. 

With players tailoring their US Open preparations, the Toronto Cup is routinely hit hard by late withdrawals and this year was no exception with Maria Sharapova, Amelie Mauresmo, Martina Hingis and Venus Williams all sending their regrets. 

Tournaments like Toronto use the Tours most popular players like Sharapova and the Williams sisters to generate buzz around their event and are left with angry ticket holders when they pull out. 

While the $1.3 million Toronto Cup can still boast a top-flight field featuring world number one Justine Henin, without Sharapovas glamour or the Williams sisters charisma the most anticipated match on Monday was a Legends exhibition with McEnroe, Jim Courier, Anna Kournikova and Carling Bassett-Seguso.

 Mouma to lead challenge

New Delhi: Commonwealth Games gold medallist Achanta Sharath Kamal and national champion Mouma Das will spearhead Indias challenge in mens and womens categories, respectively at the tough Asian Table Tennis Championships in Yangzhou, China, during September 17-23. 

The one major change in the mens team was the exclusion of two-time national champion Soumyadeep Roy. The Calcutta paddler, struggling with his form for some time now, has been replaced by A. Amalraj, who has been rewarded for consistent performance in the past few tournaments. 

Other members of the team are Subhajit Saha, Pathik Mehta and Anirban Nandi. 

In the womens squad, Delhi girl Neha Aggarwal has been included in the side. Poulami Ghatak, Kasturi Chakraborty and K. Shamini form the rest of the team. (PTI)

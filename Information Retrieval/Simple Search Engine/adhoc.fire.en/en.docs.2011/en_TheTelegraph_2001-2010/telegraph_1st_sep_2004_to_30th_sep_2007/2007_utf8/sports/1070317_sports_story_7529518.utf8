 King warning for Lara amp; Co.

Kingston: The West Indies coach, Bennett King, has warned his boys not to take the next two league games (against Zimbabwe and Ireland) lightly, following their 54-run victory over Pakistan. 

The next two games are quite important and we need to make sure we treat them in the same way as we treat all our games and play as hard as we can, King said. 

Were prone (to inconsistency) but we are not as prone as often as we were in the past. The more we play the better we get. 

Weve just got to make sure that our bad days are as close to our good days as we can in every department, the Australia-born King said. 

The players need to set up correctly and take their time when they feel they need to and assess the conditions, the West Indies coach said.

 Kaneria must be well used: Alam

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Intikhab Alam believes Danish Kaneria can be a big success in Caribbean if he is properly used. Abdul Qadir, on the other hand, believes Kaneria will have to be at the top of his game if Pakistan are to make an impact. 

Following are excerpts from what former Pakistan players had to say (alphabetically) on Kaneria and the teams attack: 

INTIKHAB ALAM: I remember how well Imran Khan used Mushtaq Ahmed when we won the 1992 World Cup. Inzamam will have to do the same for Kaneria. I think our selectors should have included another specialist spinner in the squad. 

 MUSHTAQ MOHAMMED: Kaneria has it in it him to do well, but he will be under a lot of pressure because we dont have a strong pace attack. 

ABDUL QADIR: The pitches in the Caribbean will definitely help spinners, but it will depend on how well Kaneria bowls. No matter what the pitches do, it will be the quality spinners who will stand out. Pakistan have gone into the World Cup without a plan. All other teams have picked two specialist spinners in their squads, we should have done that too. 

 IQBAL QASIM: We have not had the ideal preparations but we also have capable spinners in Shoaib Malik, Shahid Afridi and Mohammed Hafeez. If they give Kaneria good support, we can do well. (PTI)

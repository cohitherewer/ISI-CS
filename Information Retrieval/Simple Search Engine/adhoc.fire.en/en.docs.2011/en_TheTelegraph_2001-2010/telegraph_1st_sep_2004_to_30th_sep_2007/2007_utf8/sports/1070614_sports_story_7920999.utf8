 McLaren dismiss favouritism tag

 Hamilton 

Woking: McLaren has dismissed Fernando Alonsos fears that the British-based Formula One team is showing favouritism toward English driver Lewis Hamilton. 

Alonso, the two-time world champion, said that all support is going to Hamilton, who won his first F1 race at Sundays Canadian Grand Prix to make it six podium finishes in a row in his rookie season. 

McLaren boss Ron Dennis said the two drivers have a positive and growing relationship in their first season together and that the comments have been misinterpreted. 

Its completely understandable that the results of each Grand Prix are going to provide both the British and the Spanish media with an opportunity to hang on every word that the drivers say, Dennis said Wednesday. 

Sometimes quotes are taken out of context, which can put a completely different spin on an innocent remark. 

With Hamilton eight points ahead of second-place Alonso in the drivers championship and McLaren 28 points in front of Ferrari in the constructors standings, Dennis believes that competition between the two drivers is healthy. 

The Vodafone McLaren Mercedes team is made up of extremely passionate and competitive people, and there is a healthy competition between the teams working on each car, Dennis said. 

I can categorically state once again that both drivers have equal equipment, equal support and equal opportunity to win within the team, and both Fernando and Lewis know and support this. (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Uthappa is confident

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Robin Uthappa is not feeling the heat. The return of Virender Sehwag is not putting the Karnataka opener who has turned out to be a revelation in the recently-concluded one-day series against the West Indies under pressure. 

Theres no extra pressure, he said after nets at the Eden on Tuesday. I am fortunate to get an opportunity to play alongside Sehwag. Theres no competition... I can only perform better, he added. 

Does the prospect of making it to the 15-member World Cup squad ignite his motivation further? 

Im not thinking about the World Cup Its too early to say anything. I am concentrating on Thursdays match, Uthappa remarked. 

Eden Gardens has proved to be a lucky ground for him, having made 141 in his maiden appearance here in the Duleep Trophy match against Sri Lanka A in November. 

Though I scored a century in the Duleep Trophy tie, the atmosphere will be vastly different on Thursday. A full house will be a motivating factor and I am looking forward to the experience. 

Sehwag, staging a comeback, declined to make a detailed comment. Main bahut khoosh hoon, was all he said. 

The Indians had a three-hour training session at the Eden in the afternoon. Players, other than those who were involved in the Ranji Trophy final, participated. 

While Sourav Ganguly took a break, Sachin Tendulkar, Ajit Agarkar and Zaheer Khan arrived in the city only late in the evening. 

Greg Chappell watched Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh minutely at nets. The coach also had a word with the lefthander after his session got over. 

Munaf Patel was also in the focus. The fast bowler didnt go flat out and it is to be seen if he can set his fitness doubts to rest ahead of the selection for the quadrennial showpiece. 

But what is sure to keep the teams worried is the dew factor. A thick haze engulfed the Eden and as the evening wore on the super-soppers had to be pressed into service to wipe off the moisture.

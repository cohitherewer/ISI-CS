 Pak cops join probe

 Bob Woolmer 

Kingston: Two Pakistani policemen have joined the investigation into Bob Woolmers murder to work alongside local and international police. 

Mir Zubair Mahmood and Kaleem Imam have joined four Scotland Yard investigators and two forensic experts from Interpol. 

The Pakistani police are here to help accelerate the investigation, said Gilbert Scott, permanent secretary in Jamaicas ministry of national security. They will be here for as long as it takes, he said. 

Mark Shields, Jamaicas deputy police commissioner, said the Pakistanis will help with the DNA analysis and examine theories that Woolmer may have been poisoned before he was strangled. Authorities are still awaiting toxicology reports. 

Kingstons coroner, Patrick Murphy, confirmed late on Wednesday that more than 20 are slated to testify at the April 23 inquest. 

Information from Murphys office said that 22 people had already been contacted to attend sittings and summonses were being prepared. Officials said that the inquest could last up to a month. 

Asad Mustafa, assistant manager of Pakistan squad, has said that there were indications that the investigators and the coroner in Jamaica would be able to deliver a clear verdict on April 30. 

The coroners inquest is expected to take around a week to complete proceedings and give a final confirmation on how Woolmer died, he said. (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Just not on, cry experts

 - Football, Hockey demotion

OUR BUREAU

New Delhi/Calcutta: Football and hockey have been hit hard, though IHF chief K.P.S. Gill feels hockey wont be affected much. Following are excerpts from what leading football and hockey figures had to tell The Telegraph on the governments decision to demote the two disciplines: 

P.K. BANERJEE: Its a huge setback for Indian football, especially at a time when both Fifa and AFC are focusing on our country. I would urge the minister to rethink his decision. Blatter said recently our football belonged to the past, past century. Now, the ministry has pushed the game back by 200 years. 

BHAICHUNG BHUTIA: The decision to degrade football is unfortunate. What put me off was the effort to humiliate the sport. The sports ministry has the right to stop grants and other facilities to any sport that has not been doing well. But what is the point in telling it to the media and letting the public know? 

BRUNO COUTINHO: The minister, I am sure, hasnt played football ever. You need a lot of money to excel and improve standards. The government has blocked all avenues for the games development. 

M.K. KAUSHIK: Its a shocking decision. We are in the process of rebuilding a team which can make the Olympics. 

ASHOK KUMAR: I was one of those who played a role in questions being asked in Parliament about Indias poor performance. Believe me, I never expected such a harsh decision. 

MOHAMMED SHAHID: This is one of the saddest days in my life. The government, which once declared hockey as the national game, has withdrawn support at a time when the sport needs backing. 

GURBUX SINGH: The move is beyond my comprehension. Even now our world ranking is 6 out of over 100 hockey-playing countries We have always been in the top 8. We will be hosting the Commonwealth Games, and World Cup hockey, so what message are we sending? 

PARMINDER SINGH: This will only demoralise budding footballers. What the government decision has actually suggested is to stop exposure.

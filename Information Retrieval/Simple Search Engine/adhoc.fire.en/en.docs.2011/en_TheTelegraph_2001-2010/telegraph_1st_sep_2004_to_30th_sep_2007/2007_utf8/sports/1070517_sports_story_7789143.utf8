 Malinga a dangerous customer: Malik

Karachi: The new-look Pakistan squad prepared to fly out to Abu Dhabi on Wednesday to play a one-day series against Sri Lanka with new captain Shoaib Malik exhorting his boys to get back to winning ways. 

The series is important for us as we are playing for the first time after the World Cup. 

It would be good to get back to winning ways and restore some of our lost pride and give something back to the people, he said in a press conference. 

Malik said Sri Lanka would be a strong opponent despite being without three of their main players, Muttiah Muralidharan, Chaminda Vaas and Kumar Sangakkara. 

They have played in the World Cup final and it will be their final series under coach Tom Moody. So I think they would be keen to give him a nice farewell present. 

I have no doubt that to win this series we have to handle Malinga carefully because he is a dangerous customer and even in the absence of Vaas and Muralidharan, capable of being a match winner for them, he said. 

Meanwhile, there was confusion on Wednesday when the chairman of the three-man inquiry committee, constituted by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to probe into the causes of the teams poor World Cup performance, insisted he would hold a press conference. 

Ejaz Butt, a former Test player and PCB ex-secretary, said he was holding the press conference on Thursday to unveil the committees findings. 

But PCB officials said he had not got any clearance and the board had nothing to do with it.

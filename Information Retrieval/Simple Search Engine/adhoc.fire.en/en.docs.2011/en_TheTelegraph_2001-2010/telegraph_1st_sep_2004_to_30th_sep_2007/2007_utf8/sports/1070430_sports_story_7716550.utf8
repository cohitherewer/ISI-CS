The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Too many one-sided matches

- Chappell, Atherton, Sangakkara and Strauss in a 'round table' teleconference 

Scyld Berry

Technology has caught up with our regular round table. It is a teleconference between Mike Atherton, who commentated on the World Cup in the West Indies; Ian Chappell, who commentated on it in London for Indian television; Andrew Strauss, who returned home after England were knocked out; and Kumar Sangakkara, the vice-captain of Sri Lanka. The teleconference was conducted from Barbados. 

Here goes: 

Sunday Telegraph: What sort of World Cup was it? You, Kumar, also played in the last one in South Africa. How do they compare? 

Sangakkara: It was a great opening ceremony in South Africa, but the West Indies have a more colourful heritage when it comes to cricket. Weve really enjoyed it but several things didnt go as expected, especially with the death of Bob Woolmer. 

Strauss: The enthusiasm of the West Indian people made it a very enjoyable World Cup despite how their team played. From a cricketing point of view, it was a shame India and Pakistan didnt get through. It was good for Bangladesh and Ireland, but too many Super Eight matches were predictable. 

Atherton: I think it was ridiculous, the number of Associate Member countries that were involved. The World Cup should be about showcasing the very best. 

ST: Ian, you played in the first one in 1975 and have seen the following tournaments, how do you rate this World Cup? 

Chappell (never known for pussy-footing): One of the worst. Four decent games out of 50 is not a very high percentage the Ireland vs Zimbabwe tie, Sri Lankas games against South Africa and England, and England against the West Indies. The main reason to play a one-day game is to have a close finish. Maybe there were a couple of other good games along the way, but too many one-sided matches. 

ST: Was it too long? The ICC chief executive didnt think so until last week. 

Chappell: Malcolm has been living in Dubai for too long. As Ive said before, theyve got a hotel under the sea there and a ski resort in the desert. Its too far away from reality. 

ST: To what extent did staging the Champions Trophy six months beforehand detract from the World Cup? There should have been real anticipation before the West Indies played Australia in Antigua, but the teams had played each other twice in India in October and the ground was half full. 

Atherton: Theres generally too much cricket. Obviously its TV-driven to some extent, and thats why I want to ask the current players would you be prepared to be paid less for playing fewer games? 

Strauss: I dont think its a question of playing too much cricket, so much as scheduling it better. If there had been fewer Associate Members, it wouldnt have been such a long tournament. Boards might have to think about the amount of time players spend away from home. 

Sangakkara: I agree to an extent with Andrew. We have four or five days at home, which will probably include a few functions, then we are off to Abu Dhabi to play three one-day Internationals against Pakistan. For spectators, theres a question of overkill as they keep watching the same players playing each other. Id suggest fewer teams in the next World Cup. 

Chappell: Administrators have to get the balance right between the money they bring in from TV and the product they are putting to air. Probably the best format was in 1991-92, when nine teams played each other. Next time, if eight teams qualify automatically through a points system between World Cups, then you have the two best Associates, and they all play each other with a semi-final and final if you win that World Cup, youve beaten everyone at that tournament. 

Atherton: Why does the game need to globalise and spread? 

Chappell: Youve got to treat the game like a tree. The roots and trunk are the eight main countries, and you have to look after them, while the branches are the other countries marketing, promotion and so on. 

Atherton: I dont hear people asking why its necessary to spend money on taking the game to China. Look at American football and baseball. 

Chappell: Thats rubbish, Athers, baseball is played in a hundred-odd countries. 

Atherton: To go back to the original point, if you look at the Canadian team, they were all ex-Caribbean or ex-Asian players. This World Cup hasnt done much for cricket in Canada. 

Sangakkara: The game can spread but that doesnt mean you have to let other teams into the World Cup and dilute the quality. 

Chappell: The ICC is globalising the game, but make the eight major nations competitive. 

Strauss (ever brave in the face of an onslaught): I think thats the responsibility of each individual country. 

Chappell: In which case the ruling body (ICC) should be right up your backside. 

ST: Moving on from this philosophical point, gentlemen, would we agree that power plays have been a fine addition? 

Strauss: Power plays have been a good innovation because they have created interest at a stage of the game where there might not have been. They have made the one-day game less predictable and forced players to think on their feet. 

Sangakkara: We always relied on two pace bowlers keeping it tight for 15 overs, then spreading the field and bowling spin. I think power plays have forced captains to be more aggressive for five more overs and done wonders for the balance of our side. 

ST: Andrew, what was your favourite moment? 

Chappell (sensitively): Getting picked? 

Atherton (ditto): Getting pissed on pedalo night? 

Strauss (laughing): I guess the partnership between Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen of 150 against Australia . 

Chappell: I suppose Matthew Haydens fastest World Cup hundred ever off 66 balls against South Africa . 

Atherton: I enjoyed Malingas four wickets in four balls against South Africa. Unorthodoxy should be celebrated in a game now dominated by coaches.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 2006-07 NFL in a nutshell

In the end, Goas Dempo Sports Club were runaway winners with 36 points, but JCT were moral victors. Placed way down in the points table at the end of the first leg, the Phagwara side made a great recovery to grab the runners-up spot with 31 points. In the second leg, JCT won eight of their nine matches, a record in the NFL history. 

The 11th edition of the NFL also offered Indian football something to cheer about. In a competition that is mostly been dominated by foreign forwards, there were two strikers Anthony Pereira (Dempo) and Sunil Chhetri (JCT) who displayed quality football and raised hopes of being worthy successors of I.M. Vijayan and Bhaichung Bhutia. 

 Best Player: Clifford Miranda (Dempo) Temperamental at times, Miranda was the key behind Dempo triumph. Good ball control coupled with down the flank runs and accurate passing ability, the soft spoken midfielder was the creator of most Dempo attacks. It is a pity that Miranda does not perform at the same level in international matches. 

 Youngest performer: Lalkamal Bhowmick (Mohun Bagan) The 20-year-old Mohun Bagan midfielder was perhaps the only Calcutta footballer to impress among the youngsters. A hard worker and good passer of the ball, Bhowmick has improved a lot in the last few months. His poor temperament, however, has landed him in trouble on more than one occasion. 

 Best save: Sandip Nandy (Mahindra United) Nandys flying save against Mohun Bagan at the Salt Lake Stadium was simply spectacular. The rainbow shot from Douglas had good punch and accurate direction, but Nandy proved extremely alert and agile under the bar. No wonder he is Indias best paid custodian in domestic football. 

 Best goal: Jose Ramirez Barreto (Mohun Bagan) Despite his relatively poor form this season, Barreto has set the pitch ablaze with some fine goals. His best came against East Bengal in the second leg. Barretos fine header, which restored parity for Mohun Bagan, also invited praise from Fifa president Sepp Blatter, who was then present at the stadium. 

 Best coach: Sukhwinder Singh (JCT) After a poor start, when JCT lost to Mohammedan Sporting, the former national coach managed to steer JCT to the second spot. He depended mainly on home grown players, though his two strikers Sunil Chhetri from Delhi and Edeh Chidi of Nigeria played key roles behind all JCT wins. 

 Best match: Dempo vs East Bengal; Dempo won 5-3 This crucial tie was a see-saw battle between the two teams in Margao. At one time, East Bengal led 3-1, but Dempo made a superb comeback to stun the Calcutta outfit. 

 Best quote: Armando Colaco (Dempo coach) I didnt allow the players to shoot (pictures) with our chairman Srinivas Dempo after the Air India match in Mumbai because they would get distracted. Let them finish the job first. 

 Worst miss: Odafa Okoli (Churchill) against Mohun Bagan The NFL top scorer had no one to beat except the goalkeeper. Yet, he shot wide. 

 Biggest disappointment: Barreto/Bhutia combine (Mohun Bagan) Mohun Bagan spent nearly Rs one crore on two strikers, but the duo couldnt deliver. The green and maroon brigade finished a poor eighth in NFL. 

 Surprise package: Sunil Chhetri (JCT) The diminutive forward emerged one of Indias best strikers by scoring 12 goals in the NFL. Along with Edeh Chidi, he has become a force to reckon with and surely the best young Indian striker in sight other than Dempos Anthony Pereira. 

 Most touching gesture Dempo remembering two of their fans who died in a road accident while on their way to watch Dempo play Mahindra United. Dempo said a small prayer for the two before the final game against Mohun Bagan. 

 Maximum turnout Around 70,000 in the East Bengal versus Mohun Bagan second-leg match. 

 Most cards in a match Six (one red, five yellow), Air India vs Churchill Brothers. 

 Most red cards in a match Two each in Sporting Clube de Goa vs Mohun Bagan and Dempo vs East Bengal. They are: Khabra Harmonjit Singh (Sporting), Lalkamal Bhowmick (Mohun Bagan), Crescent Antao (Dempo) and Edmilson Marques (East Bengal).

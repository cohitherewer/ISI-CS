 Pak plans hinge on Kaneria

Karachi: With Shahid Afridi serving a two-match ban, Pakistan will rely on leg-spinner Danish Kaneria against Ireland and hosts West Indies, besides sending wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal to open the innings with Imran Nazir. 

Before leaving for the West Indies on Thursday, captain Inzamam-ul Haq also said that he would bat at No.4 with Mohammed Yousuf following him. 

Inzamam said if Kaneria bowled well, Pakistan would then have the choice of playing Afridi in No.7. 

I will bat at number four after Akmal, Nazir and Younis Khan at least in the first two games, then we will take it from there, said Inzamam. 

The idea is to play four specialist bowlers and focus on taking wickets, said Inzamam. 

Pakistan is set to play either Azhar Mahmood or Afridi as the sole allrounder in the side. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 East Bengal clinch fifth Federation Cup title

JAYDEEP BASU

 Edmilson scored both goals 

Ludhiana: This was a gift for his fans. East Bengal coach Subrata Bhattacharya plotted Mahindra Uniteds downfall with a well-constructed 2-1 win in the final of the Federation Cup at the Guru Nanak Dev Stadium here on Saturday. 

Bhattacharyas boys repaid his faith with some sterling show, Edmilson Marques leading the way with two goals in the first half. 

This was East Bengals first Federation Cup title in 11 years and fifth overall. It was also their first in 22 years outside Calcutta. Bhattacharya had talked of a gift for his supporters and the players made that dream come true. 

One man on either side made the difference. Edmilson by his presence and NP Pradeep by his absence. 

Sunil Kumar, Mahindras replacement for Pradeep, was a disaster. He spent only 42 minutes before being sent off for a foul on Edmilson. In between, he also conceded a penalty to allow East Bengal take the lead. 

Mahindra, playing with ten players, deserve praise for stretching East Bengal. The hard work put in by Ajayan, substitute Sukhwinder Singh and Andrews Pomeyie in the last half hour left East Bengals defence gasping for breath. Pity the equaliser remained elusive for Mahindra, despite the referee adding 10 minutes of injury time. 

To say that East Bengal were ineffective in the second half will not be correct. They had two chances, but Asim Biswas and Syed Rahim Nabi failed to cash in on them. Stretched too much, a limping Edmilson finally made way for Dipendu Biswas. 

East Bengal had a confident Subrata Paul under the bar, and despite some faulty clearances, the defence held firm when it mattered. 

In the first half, Mahindras gameplan was simple. Like in the semi-final against Dempo, Derek Pereiras boys didnt allow the opponents much space and time, especially in the midfield. 

Close markings and quick tackles were the call of the day. It was enough to make life on the pitch miserable for East Bengals two playmakers Alvito DCunha and Nabi. 

The ploy was successful till Mahindra took it too far and conceded a penalty in the 35th minute. Defender Sunil Kumar brought down a struggling Edmilson inside the area for reasons best known to him. The Brazilian was too good for Sandeep Nandy under the Mahindra bar. 

Once Edmilson struck his fifth goal of the tournament, the game livened up, the last 10 minutes of the first half being an action-packed affair. As if conceding the penalty was not enough, Sunil Kumar then fouled Edmilson again near his left touchline in the 42nd minute. It didnt take referee K Shankar much to give the errant Mahindra defender marching orders. 

The add-on time in the first half resulted in two goals. Suddenly high on confidence, Edmilson put East Bengal further ahead with a skilful strike. He received the ball on the right, well outside the box, and got past Ravanan. Edmilson noticed an advancing Nandy out of his position. 

He produced a crafty dipping shot that sailed over the outstretched hands of the goalkeeper. Only a while earlier Nandy had left his post to foil the Edmilson in the nick of time. 

East Bengals celebrations had barely died down when Mehrajuddin Wadoo did a Sunil Kumar by charging unfairly at Minga Deco. Manjit Singh converted in style to keep alive Mahindra hopes. 

Pereira erred in his tactics. Given East Bengals current form, the Mumbai team had reason to act physical, but the robust tacklings only put his players at a disadvantage. 

His foreign recruits acted more as physical spoilers in the middle instead of trying to play in tandem with two fine ball players Ajayan and Steven Dias. When Mahindra finally got their act together, they had only 10 men left on the field.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We misread the wicket: Dav

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Dhaka: Dav Whatmore has perhaps made the biggest blunder that could cost him the Test series against India. 

Habibul Bashar called correctly in the morning and inexplicably chose to field. At the end of the day India had mustered 326 for no loss. 

As part of the team management, Whatmore has to take part of the blame. 

Asked about the decision to field first, Whatmore admitted it was a mistake. 

We misread the wicket. There is reason to regret it. If we had known that the wicket was going to behave like this, we would not have fielded first. 

He, however, pointed out that the decision was unanimous. 

We did talk with Bashar. There was a selector and vice-captain too. It was a decision based on inputs from a number of people. 

Any home advantage for Bangladesh? Maybe if we had batted first... It was very difficult, very trying conditions for players from both the teams. 

He predicted a tough day on the field for his boys on Saturday. 

We just have to prod along and do the best we can. It looks like trying to get 10 wickets is going to be very hard to achieve. 

Whatmore, however, was all praise for Wasim Jaffer. He was controlled and showed a lot of character, the Australian said of the centurion.

DAY I HIGHLIGHTS

Ishant Sharma became the 258th player to appear for India. At 18 years 265 days, he is the 10th youngest to appear in a Test and the youngest pace bowler ever for India. Previously, the record belonged to Chetan Sharma, who played his first Test in 1984-85 at 18 years and 288 days.

 The first-wicket stand of 175 is Indias best opening partnership against Bangladesh. The previous best was 66 between S.S. Das and S. Ramesh at Dhaka in 2000-01.

 This (175) is the best opening partnership by any team in Bangladesh. The previous best was 137 between Englands Marcus Trescothick and Michael Vaughan (Dhaka, 2003-04).

 This (175) is also the best first-wicket stand by any team against Bangladesh. The previous best was 168 between Pakistans Saeed Anwar and Taufeeq Umar (Multan, 2001-02).

 Only once before have Bangladesh gone through the entire day without taking a wicket. South Africas Jacques Rudolph and Boeta Dippenaar put on 280 runs on the second day at Chittagong in 2003.

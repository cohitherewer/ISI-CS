 It will be another challenge: Gayle 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Cuttack: With Brian Lara missing out on the second ODI on the advice of team physiotherapist Stephen Partridge, Chris Gayle will make his debut as the West Indies captain at the Barabati on Wednesday. 

Though disappointed at the loss of the teams most experienced player, vice-captain Gayle is looking forward to the new challenge as well as support from the maestro. 

Its an honour to captain the side for the first time (But) Im sure support will still be there from him (Lara) off the field and we will have to rally around each other in the middle and get the job done, the left handed opener said in a statement. 

It will be another challenge but, as always, you just have to enjoy the game and keep your thinking cap on and continue improving our game, Gayle said.

 India go down 0-2 to NZ

Boom (Belgium): New Zealand struck twice in a seven-minute spell late to inflict a 2-0 defeat on India in the opening match of the Champions Challenge hockey tournament for men on Saturday. 

Goals by Hayden Shaw (63rd) and David Kosoof (69th) handed the Kiwis three points as New Zealand hit back strongly towards close after seeing off early Indian challenge in a match that was mostly played in heavy rains. 

India promised much early on when they pinned the opponents in their own half, but could not convert from the openings against a team that played a waiting game while leaving a bit more in the tank for a final push. 

Indias best moments were when they received two penalty corners on either side of the break, but Sandeep Singh failed to convert those. (PTI)

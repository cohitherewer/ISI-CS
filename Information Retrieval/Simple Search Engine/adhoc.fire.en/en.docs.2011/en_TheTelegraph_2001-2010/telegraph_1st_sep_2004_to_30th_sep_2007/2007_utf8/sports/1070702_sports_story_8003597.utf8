 Atwal shares 70th spot

Grand Blanc (US): Poor finishing continued to dog Arjun Atwal as another bogey-bogey sequence saw him slip to tied 70th with a card of one-over 73 in the third round of Buick Open here on Saturday. 

Atwal had a bogey on the fourth. Then, after nine pars in a row, he struck birdies on the 14th and the 15th. But the late bogeys on the 17th and the 18th holes spoilt his day. 

India-born Swede Daniel Chopra had an eventful round with four birdies and four bogeys for an even-par 72 that saw him come down to 40th with a total of six-under 210.

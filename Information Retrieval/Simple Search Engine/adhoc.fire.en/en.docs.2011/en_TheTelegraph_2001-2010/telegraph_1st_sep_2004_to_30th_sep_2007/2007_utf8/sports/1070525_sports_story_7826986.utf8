 Squad for Ireland ties on June 12

Mumbai: The one-day squad for the four limited-overs off-shore matches in Ireland and Scotland will be selected in Bangalore on June 12. 

The squad for the three matches against South Africa (in Ireland on June 26, 29 and July 1) and the one-off match against Pakistan (in Glasgow on July 3) will be selected in Bangalore on June 12, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said here Thursday. 

We will select the team for the Test series to follow in England later. The players will have a short conditioning camp in Bangalore before departing from Mumbai on June 19 or 20. 

India will play a three-Test series against England with the matches scheduled at Lords (July 19-23), Trent Bridge (July 27-31) and The Oval (August 9-13). 

This will be followed by a seven-match ODI series against the hosts from August 21 to September 8. 

Shah said that owing to the spate of injuries to Indian bowlers, the BCCI has decided to conduct a fitness-cum-conditioning camp for 10 to 12 bowlers in Bangalore from June 8-12. 

The BCCI also made it clear that a full-time coach would be appointed before the tour of Ireland and a decision would be taken early next month. 

There wont be an interim coach. The coach will be chosen by the special committee on June 4 in Bangalore or within the next six days after that sitting, Shah said.

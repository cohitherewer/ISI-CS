 Mahindra rally to down Dempo

 - National League

 Okonji brace in Churchill win over Sporting 

 Yakubu proved a handful for Dempo 

Mumbai: Mahindra United started their National Football League title defence in impressive fashion, defeating Dempo Sports Club 2-1 at the Cooperage Ground here on Monday. 

The local favourites had to recover from an early setback after the Goan side, former NFL champions, took an early lead. 

Dempo went ahead in the third minute through speedy forward Jerrry Zirsanga, who found the mark off a cross from the right flank by Samir Naik. 

Mahindra did not take long to respond as Andrews Mensah restored parity in the 10th minute. 

The Ghanaian striker essayed a low volley from close range to beat rival custodian V.P. Satish Kumar and bring his side on level terms with the Durand Cup champions. 

In the second half, the defending champions stepped up the pressure and got the winner through captain Yusif Yakubu, who turned in a dazzling show towards the end with his speedy runs and superb ball control. 

The Ghanaian received a pinpoint centre in front of goal from compatriot Mensah and booted home by taking advantage of the bad positioning of keeper Satish Kumar. 

The defending champions, who were solid in defence, should have added more goals towards the end but Yakubus sizzling runs down the left flank went to waste as none of his teammates were in a position to convert these raids into goals. 

Up next for Mahindra would be another Goan outfit Churchill Brothers, promoted from the lower division, here on Thursday, while Dempo take on Mohammedan Sporting on Friday. 

Meanwhile in Duler, Odafa Okonji scored a brace to guide Churchill Brothers to a 2-0 win over Sporting Clube de Goa in their opening NFL encounter at Duler ground, Mapusa on Monday. 

Churchill Brothers, who had the lions share of exchanges, took the lead at the half hour mark when Genius Zenith, from the right, relayed the ball to Nigerian George Ekeh whose brilliant shot was connected by Okonji. 

After the change of ends, Ekeh and Okonji, who gave a torrid time to Sporting defence, increased the lead in the 61st minute with the latter again finding the net when he beat defender Mathew to slot the ball home off a pass by Ekeh. 

Okonji was adjudged Man of the match for his brilliant performance upfront. (PTI)

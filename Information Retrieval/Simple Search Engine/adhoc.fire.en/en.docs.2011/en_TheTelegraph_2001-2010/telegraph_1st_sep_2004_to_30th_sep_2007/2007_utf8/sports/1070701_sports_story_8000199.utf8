 Vajravelu no more

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Olympian B.N. Vajravelu, who was once nicknamed Stanley Matthews of India by the British press, passed away in Bangalore on Thursday night due to kidney failure. Vajravelu was 84. He is survived by four sons and a daughter. 

A member of the Indian team in the 1948 London Olympic, Vajravelu was one of the greatest right wingers of his time. 

In London, India played only one match, losing to France 1-2. Vajravelu, however, dazzled with his speed, passing ability and shooting prowess.

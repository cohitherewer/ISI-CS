 Memorial on Wednesday

Johannesburg: Bob Woolmers memorial service will be held in Cape Town on Wednesday, according to a press release by the Bob Woolmer Trust Fund on Friday. 

The service will take place at the Wynberg Boys High School. It will be led by Jerome Francis, a minister who was coached by Woolmer as a boy. 

Former South African and Warwickshire fast bowler Allan Donald and leading sports scientist Professor Tim Noakes will be among the speakers. 

Woolmer, 58, was a former coach of the South African national team and lived in Cape Town for over 20 years. 

The choir will be from the Langa community and there will also be speakers from the Avendale Cricket Club, both of whom benefited enormously from Woolmers coaching in previously disadvantaged communities. 

One day after Pakistan were eliminated from the World Cup in the Caribbean, Woolmer was found unconscious in his Kingston hotel room on March 18 and died after being taken to hospital. 

Jamaican police launched a murder inquiry four days later after reporting that the Briton was killed by strangulation. 

The killing has since become one of the worlds most talked-about whodunnits. 

Meanwhile, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) will also organise a memorial service for the late coach, according to a release. It will be held at Sacred Heart Cathedral in Lahore on Sunday.

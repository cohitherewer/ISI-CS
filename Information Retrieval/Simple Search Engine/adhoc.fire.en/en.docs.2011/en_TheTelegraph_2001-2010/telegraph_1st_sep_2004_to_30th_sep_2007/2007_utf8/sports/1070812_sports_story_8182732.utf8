 Tour of Sri Lanka

 London: 

 Teenaged Yorkshire leg-spinner Adil Rashid is tipped 

 to make the England squad for the tour of Sri Lanka later 

 this year.

 England are scheduled to make 

 two trips first for five ODIs and, then, three Tests.

 According to The Telegraphs 

 sources, Rashid is certain to get a call-up. 

 Its not clear whether hell be there in both 

 squads, though.

 roots are in India, Rashids family hails from Pakistan.

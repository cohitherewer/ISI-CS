The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Our campaign seems a Comedy of Errors

Derek Pringle

 Michael Vaughan 

Andrew Flintoff left his teammates in no doubt about his new intentions as he threw himself into Englands practice session at Gros Islet with renewed gusto on Tuesday. With no outlet for his frustrations since being dropped from Sundays match against Canada for a breach of team discipline, Flintoff hit the bat hard when he bowled and the ball even harder when he batted. 

Flintoff had two knocks and looked in far better shape than his captain Michael Vaughan, who fell into a pothole on the outfield during fielding practice and jarred his vulnerable right knee, which has undergone four operations. 

The mishap befalling Vaughan, who, according to the BBC, was instrumental in Flintoff being stripped of the vice-captaincy, adds to the impression that Englands World Cup campaign is becoming a comedy of errors without the belly laughs. They have still to put in a strong performance and must beat Kenya on Saturday if they are to proceed to the Super Eight stage, where they could play Ireland in Guyana. Yet, with calamities continuing to dog them both on and off the field, you wouldnt bank on them being there unless something other than Vaughans knee suddenly clicks. 

[Meanwhile, wicketkeeper Paul Nixon said on Wednesday that Vaughan is fully fit for the group C decider against Kenya on Saturday, adds a Reuters report from St Lucia. Vaughan tripped on a pot hole during training on Tuesday and had ice applied to his jarred knee. He is fine and he is looking forward to the game, Nixon said. He is 100 per cent. It was just a little tweak.] 

There remains a strong desire to move on. But small details keep emerging, such as the role played by Kevin Shine and Jeremy Snape, both present in Rumours bar and who now find themselves fined along with Flintoff and the other five players involved James Anderson, Liam Plunkett, Ian Bell, Paul Nixon and Jon Lewis. 

Although both coaches accept they should have told players to leave the bar at a reasonable hour, there is an irony here, especially with regard to Snape, the one-day captain of Leicestershire. Recently seconded by Duncan Fletcher to work on the psychological aspects of bowling with the squad, Snape was meant to stay for a week, though that was extended after he had apparently gained the ear of Flintoff. Given the fiasco that has occurred since, we can assume it wasnt sweet nothings that hed been whispering into Freddies shell-like. 

Shine, the bowling coach, was probably unlucky to be punished. In Australia, he was apparently abstinence personified and just happened to wash up in the same bar as Flintoff and the others after a night out with his brother. Both coaches admit errors in judgment and have accepted their fines, which along with the players contributions total 10,000. All money will be donated to the Chance to Shine foundation, the charity that brings cricket to Britains inner city schools. 

The binge has brought accusations of a drinking culture in cricket at odds with the standards expected of well-paid professional sportsmen. Twenty years ago most England players took drink on a regular basis, especially on tour, where the mood was more like a school away trip. 

In the 1987 World Cup in India and Pakistan, Graham Gooch jettisoned one of his spare bats in order to fit in eight bottles of decent claret, all but unavailable on the subcontinent in those days. Of course, Australias David Boon famously overcame the drudgery of the Sydney-London flight by drinking 52 cans of lager, beating the previous best of 48 set by Rod Marsh, an England selector until recently. 

Those days are gone and with science used to excess rather than alcohol, modern cricketers are far more abstemious when it comes to drinking and cover driving, a point confirmed by Paul Collingwood in his column. 

Despite what some people have said, I do not think we have a problem with drinking within the team, said Collingwood. We have all made mistakes in the past I am not saying I have been an angel. If they learn from their mistakes, that is the best thing that can come out of this. 

There has never been a curfew put in place by management but in all my time with England it has been spelt out by the coach that players are expected to behave responsibly and prepare for matches in the right way. It has always been left up to individuals to decide exactly how they do that. 

With Flintoffs antics costing him the vice-captaincy and Andrew Strauss out of the team, there is a vacancy, a post the tenacious Collingwood could just be in line for.

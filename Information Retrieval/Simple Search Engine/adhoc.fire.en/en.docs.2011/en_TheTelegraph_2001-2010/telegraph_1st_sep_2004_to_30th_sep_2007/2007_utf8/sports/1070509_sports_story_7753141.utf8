 Pakistan hunt for tech-savvy coach

Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is looking for a tech-savvy coach to fit into the shoes of Bob Woolmer. 

We are in search of a qualified coach and we will be selecting the most suitable candidate with the help of our search committee and the process will be completed by July 1, PCB chief Dr Nasim Ashraf said. 

Ashraf defended the selection process for the new coach in the wake of former captains Intikhab Alam and Javed Miandads refusal to apply for the post, objecting to the methods. 

We need a computer literate coach and if someone has any objection to the way we are selecting a coach by advertising the post we cannot help them, Ashraf was quoted as saying by a Pakistan daily. 

So far, four foreign coaches from different countries including England and West Indies have submitted their credentials in response to the PCBs advertisement but Ashraf declined to reveal their names. (PTI)

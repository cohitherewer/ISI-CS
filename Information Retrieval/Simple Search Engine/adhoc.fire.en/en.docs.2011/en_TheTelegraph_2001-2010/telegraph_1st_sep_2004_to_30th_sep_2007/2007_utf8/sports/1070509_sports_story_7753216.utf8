LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 John Wright 

Dhaka: The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB)

 is looking at John Wright as Dav Whatmores successor. Also in the frame,

 so to say, is former South African coach Ray Jennings. 

Wright was Indias coach from November 2000 to April 2005. 

Yes, its a fact that Wright is on our shortlist... Jennings as well... Now, its a question of negotiating with them as also with a couple of others who dont have international experience, BCB

 vice-president Shah Nurul Kabir Shaheen told The Telegraph. 

Shaheen, a former MP, added that the ball could start rolling by next week. May 29 is Whatmores last day in office. 

The BCB has already approached Gordon Greenidge and Andy Roberts to come on board as batting and bowling coach, respectively.

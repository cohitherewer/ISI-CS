 New Zealand 149/4 after 31 overs

Gros Islet: England were undone by some rash shots on their way to 209 for seven in their opening World Cup group C clash with New Zealand on Friday. 

New Zealand were 149 for four after 31 overs with Scott Styris and Jacob Oram batting on 62 and 35, respectively. Lou Vincent and Ross Taylor were out for ducks. James Anderson took two wickets, while Liam Plunkett and Monty Panesar had one each. 

They lost their three key middle-order batsmen, Paul Collingwood (31), Kevin Pietersen (60) and Andrew Flintoff (0), in rapid succession to lose momentum completely. 

Collingwood and Pietersen did the rescue act after England were reduced to 52 for three, stitching together an 81-run partnership for the fourth wicket. 

But Collingwoods departure triggered a mini-collapse as Black Caps spearhead Shane Bond struck back-to-back blows, removing both Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff (0) in the 36th over to tighten the noose. 

However, an unbeaten 71-run partnership between Paul Nixon (42) and Liam Plunkett (29) gave England at least something to bowl at when New Zealand bat on an extremely slow, sticky wicket. 

Heavy morning rain forced the start to be delayed by half an hour, with the wet conditions leading New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming to put England into bat. 

But the bowlers needed little help early on with Englands top three getting themselves out with loose shots. 

Opener Ed Joyce wafted away from his body and edged James Franklin behind to Brendon McCullum for a duck in the second delivery of the first over after a no-ball. 

Ian Bell then made five before making the same mistake against Jacob Oram. 

Captain Michael Vaughan, set to play a full part in the game after recovering from knee and hamstring problems, played some exuberant shots in his 26 before dragging a Franklin ball on to his stumps. 

Pietersen, making his first ODI appearance since breaking his rib in January, then steadied the innings with 60 before a mini-collapse left England reeling. Collingwood, Pietersen and Flintoff fell within sevens balls before the tail wagged against wicketless spinners Daniel Vettori and Jeetan Patel to push Englands total up. 

England included James Anderson, despite the seamer breaking the little finger on his bowling hand on Wednesday.

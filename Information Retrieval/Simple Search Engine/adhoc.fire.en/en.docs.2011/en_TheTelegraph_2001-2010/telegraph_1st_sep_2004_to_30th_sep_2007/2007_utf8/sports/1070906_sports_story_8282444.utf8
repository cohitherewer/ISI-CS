 Delhi to host AFC Cup match

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: National coach Bob Houghton will have a wonderful opportunity to watch some top Lebanon footballers in action on the eve of Indias World Cup qualifiers when Delhi hosts the AFC Cup quarter final match between Mahindra United and Al Mejmeh of Lebanon on September 18. 

According to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources, the match will be held at the floodlit Ambedkar Stadium where India registered a historic Nehru Cup triumph recently. 

Houghton, currently in Cape Town, will return to Delhi by the middle of this month. 

The Mumbai side, for the last two seasons, were playing their home matches in the AFC Cup in Goa, but a directive from the Asian Football Confederation forced them to look for an alternative venue. 

AFC, according to sources, has asked the match to be played after sunset owing to Ramazan. The floodlights at the Nehru Stadium in Goa are currently undergoing renovation. 

Mahindra, however, have left out Ghanaian striker Yusif Yakubu out of the squad. The decision was taken after he failed to return to Mumbai and missed the registration deadline. 

We sent Yakubus air tickets on a couple of occasions, said a Mahindra official. He seems to be having some passport problems.

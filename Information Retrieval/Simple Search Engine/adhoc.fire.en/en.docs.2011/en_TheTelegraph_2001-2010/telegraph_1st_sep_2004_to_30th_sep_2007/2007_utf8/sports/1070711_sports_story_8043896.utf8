 No confirmation

 A STAFF REPORTER

 MANDELA-GANDHI TROPHY

 Calcutta: 

 If a senior Cricket South Africa official is to be believed, 

 Mahatma Gandhis name may soon be associated with cricket 

 along with Nelson Mandela. 

 According to a magazine, CSA chief 

 executive Gerald Majola has disclosed that South Africa 

 and India have been locked in talks to hold an annual one-day 

 series, which will be called the Mandela-Gandhi Trophy.

 However, the Board of Control 

 for Cricket India (BCCI) secretary Niranjan Shah, when contacted, 

 pleaded ignorance. 

 Im not aware of such 

 a series. We also havent got any communication from 

 the South African board in the regard, Shah said. 

 The proposed series, if it comes 

 through, will be difficult to adjust in the already congested 

 cricket calendar. However, its financial prospect seems 

 a strong attraction. 

 Majola said South Africas 

 series against India had financially benefited the 

 board and it was a great way to increase income.

 Our major income source 

 is TV money. Last season, when India toured here (in South 

 Africa), we had a fantastic year. This year, however, things 

 wont be as good.

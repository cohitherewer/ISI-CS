 Lions rally to beat Steelers 4-3

Chandigarh: Defending champion Bangalore Lions made a strong comeback with a resilient 4-3 victory over table-toppers Orissa Steelers in the Premier Hockey League here on Friday. 

The Lions played a methodical game and thwarted an equally impressive Steelers to bag full points from the crucial encounter at the Sector-42 hockey stadium. 

Twice they fell in arrears, but scored twice in the space of two minutes in the third quarter to take the lead. 

Lions increased the lead to 4-2 early in the last quarter, but the Steelers played with determination and pulled one back in the very next minute to remain in fight till the end. However, the Lions defended stubbornly and made sudden counters to walk away with full honours. 

Bangalore Lions now have 12 points and move up to third place on the table after eight matches, while Orissa Steelers still lead the table with 17 points after as many matches.

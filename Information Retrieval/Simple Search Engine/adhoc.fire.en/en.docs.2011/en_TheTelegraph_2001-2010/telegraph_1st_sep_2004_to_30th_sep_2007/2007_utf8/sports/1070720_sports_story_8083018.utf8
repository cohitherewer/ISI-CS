OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

London: Lords has gone the way of the rest of the world. Sniffer dogs, metal detectors, frisking 

Even in the not too distant past, one would hardly notice security personnel. Stewards in plenty, yes, but few in uniform. Today, its different. 

There was a bomb scare a couple of years ago Security got tightened then itself, but things changed even more after the bomb blasts here last July Now, its a way of life, an MCC official told The Telegraph. 

The sniffer dogs, whore on call from a private security firm, run a daily check on the facilities including the state of the art media centre. 

Not just dogs, one of the Metropolitan Police officers ran a check on the centre soon after the first Test got underway on Thursday.

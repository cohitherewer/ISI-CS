 Failure on clay has got to Federer

SIMON BARNES

 Roger Federer is facing a crisis 

Roger Federer is facing the fact that he may not be the greatest male tennis player of all time, perhaps only the second, or even the third greatest. This is a position that every other tennis player in the world may die for, but for Federer, it is nothing less than a crisis. 

So he has done what every sensible man does when crisis comes: panicked. Its two weeks before the French Open starts, a tournament he longs to win; its six weeks before Wimbledon, a tournament he is hoping to win for the fifth successive time, to equal the record of Bjrn Borg. And he has lost to a relative nobody and sacked his coach. 

Federer has won 10 Grand-Slam singles titles, which makes him equal fifth in the all-time list, but he is only 25 and could double that. Or not, of course. The last of these was the Australian Open, which he won this year in his usual serene fashion. He has been the No 1-ranked player since February 2, 2004, and thats a record, too. 

But he has lost four of his past 11 matches. He lost twice to Guillermo Caas, after which he was uncharacteristically ungracious, muttering about his opponents 15-month drugs ban. Federer then, inevitably, met Rafael Nadal, his nemesis and antithesis, who consistently beats him on clay, in the final of the Monte Carlo Masters Series event. Federer lost 4-6, 4-6, but despite the scoreline it was a serious hammering. 

His next tournament was in Rome and he arrived before everyone else to get his eye well and truly in. But instead, he was beaten by Filippo Volandri, a clay-court specialist who cant serve and was ranked No.53 in the world, though he is now up to No 34. 

Why should I discuss it here with you? he asked the press. So he discussed it with his coach, Tony Roche, and sacked him. Or rather, they reached a mutual agreement to split, as the official version prefers it. 

Hes rattled, Federer is. The man who uses serenity as one of his most potent weapons has fretted himself into crisis. Against Volandri he played like a man without confidence, without belief. I know: it sounds like Marilyn Monroe saying, If only I could look sexy or Vincent saying, If only I could paint a picture. But these things happened, too. 

Federer has always longed to win Grand-Slam events on every surface, but like many other champions Sampras, Connors, Tilden, McEnroe he has never managed it on clay. Not yet, anyway. He wants to be as good as Rod Laver, who pulled off the Grand Slam of four titles in a year on two occasions. 

Federers failure on clay has got to him. His domination on that surface by Nadal has also affected him. Fretting about being the best ever has eaten away at him. Some suggest that the superstar endorsement circuit has softened him, reducing his taste for the more sordid aspects of his trade. 

We measure greatness not by a persons ability to avoid crisis, but by his ability to deal with one. Steve Redgrave had diabetes before winning his fifth Olympic gold medal; Matthew Pinsent had his crew fall apart weeks before winning his fourth; Pete Sampras suffered a crisis of confidence after winning his first US Open and before winning his last, his fourteenth Grand-Slam title. 

And so we shall measure Federer by the way he deals with what is happening to him. He has been this way before, of course, getting rid of another coach, Peter Lundgren, after winning his first Wimbledon, and then going it alone. 

Perhaps going it alone again is what he needs. John McEnroe suggests that he needs a modern-minded coach Roche is 61 who will shout at him and tell him how to play. (Was he volunteering?) But perhaps this shake-up, any shake-up, is what Federer needs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I didnt propose Sunnys name

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai: Kapil Dev has clarified that he didnt propose Sunil Gavaskar be appointed the Team India coach during Fridays World Cup review-related meeting here. 

That wasnt my brief I wasnt asked to But, yes, the president (Sharad Pawar) did seek my views and I repeated that Sunny was best suited. Nothing more, Indias only World Cup-winning captain told The Telegraph. 

Gavaskar, it seems, responded by simply smiling. 

According to Chandu Borde, another former captain who attended the meeting, the Board of Control for Cricket in India must look for somebody right now, Ravi Shastris is no more than a stop-gap arrangement who is an excellent communicator. 

He said: As our team has quite a few seniors, the ability to communicate and relate is very important Its about bringing the young and the experienced together 

Its an indirect indictment of former coach Greg Chappell.

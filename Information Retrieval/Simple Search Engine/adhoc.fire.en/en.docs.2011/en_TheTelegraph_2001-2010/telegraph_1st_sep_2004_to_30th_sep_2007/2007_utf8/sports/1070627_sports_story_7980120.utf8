 Stakes high for Federer, the great artist 

Simon Barnes

 Roger Federer 

It was as if Roger Federer were deliberately seeking his place in history. He played the pre-match warm-up in long white trousers, the epitome of languid elegance, almost consciously recalling the days of Fred Perry and a time when the phrase gentlemens singles could be used without irony, or, for that matter, quotation marks. 

He had entered Centre Court in his white jacket, a custom he inaugurated last year, looking, to tell the truth, like a rather foppish painter and decorator. And all this retro fashion stuff does rather send out the message: you are not watching a mere champion, you are watching a legend. You are watching history. 

You are not watching Federer, you are watching ten Grand-Slam titles all at once. You are not watching the Wimbledon champion, you are watching the man who aims to equal Bjorn Borg. Federer aims to win his fifth successive Wimbledon title his fifth successive Gentlemens Singles Championship, to be precise and is not fussy about his choice of weapon. 

On Monday, Federer flexed his reputation at a spirited young Russian called Teimuraz Gabashvili and although Gabashvili chucked the lot at him, Federer ambled through 6-3, 6-2, 6-4. 

Every time Federer steps on court in a Grand-Slam tournament, he is conscious of history and of the level of greatness he might achieve. 

You can talk all you like about taking each match as it comes, but these days at least part of Federers mind is on such high and dangerous matters as a fifth Wimbledon title to equal Borg, a fifteenth Grand Slam title to beat Pete Sampras. 

Federer declined to play the match in his longs it was cold, but not that cold. All the same, his entire style Monday afternoon was one of muted greatness like a great actor who brings all eyes upon himself by the means of the deliberate modesty of his demeanour. 

You dont become great. If you are great, you always were great. 

Greatness is not something that an athlete acquires; rather, it is something he reveals. We who watch never know quite how much will be revealed. And the great athlete himself, does he know the extent of his greatness? Does every further revelation come as a glorious surprise, or a confirmation of something he always knew? 

An important aspect of Federers greatness is that he can play so many different kinds of tennis. From one point to another, he can be a different player for a moment all touch, then all looping top spin, then frank, flat power. When pushed by a better opponent, he can do all these things and a good few more in a single rally. 

It is as if he keeps changing personalities on you; a different opponent to counter every facet of his opponents abilities, and every single one of them is genuine. We know hes great, but this is a man who might yet reveal himself as the greatest ever and so the stakes get higher with every match he plays at a grand-slam tournament.

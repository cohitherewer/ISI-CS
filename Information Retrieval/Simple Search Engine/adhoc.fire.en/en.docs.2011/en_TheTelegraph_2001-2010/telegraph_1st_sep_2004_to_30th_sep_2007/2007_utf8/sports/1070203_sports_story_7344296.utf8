 Ronaldinho samples life on Brazil bench 

 - I pick those who are in best technical and physical conditions: Dunga 

 Ronaldinho

Rio De Janeiro: Ronaldinhos first encounter with Brazil coach Dunga was when the two were on opposite sides during a derby in Porto Alegre in June 1999. 

Ronaldinho, playing for Gremio, was a little-known goofy-grinned teenager in his first full year as a professional. 

Dunga was a hard-nosed, seasoned international in the twilight of his career who had captained Brazil to two successive World Cup finals and was enjoying a final stint with Internacional, the club where he had started out. 

Dunga, now 43, has made an excellent start as Brazil coach as he attempts to rebuild the side following last years miserable World Cup performance, leading his team to four wins and a draw in their first five outings. He will defend that record against Luiz Felipe Scolaris Portugal in a friendly in London on Tuesday. 

As expected for a man famed for his ruthless, never-say-die approach as a player, Dunga has not been afraid to make tough decisions. 

Strikers Ronaldo and Adriano, who both underperformed in Germany, have been left out, although Adriano has finally been given a recall for the Portugal match. 

Those decisions struck a chord with the Brazilian public, who were thoroughly disillusioned with the pair during the World Cup. 

Dunga is treading on much thinner ice over his treatment of Ronaldinho, another of Brazils so-called Magic Quartet. 

After being left out of Dungas first squad, the former Player of the Year has unceremoniously been dumped on the substitutes bench. 

Ronaldinho has started only one of Dungas five full internationals in charge and has been told he will have to fight for his place in the team, just like the other players. 

The Brazilian national team has a squad of 22 players of whom 11 can play, Dunga said recently. I pick the 11 who are in the best technical and physical conditions. 

The policy already has the critics straining at the leash, notably Tostao, a forward in the 1970 World Cup team and now one of Brazils best-known columnists. 

My main reservation as far as Dunga is concerned is his attitude to Ronaldinho. He thinks that Ronaldinhos style is too artistic, that hes not a team player, which isnt true. Dungas concepts are those of a workman. (Reuters)

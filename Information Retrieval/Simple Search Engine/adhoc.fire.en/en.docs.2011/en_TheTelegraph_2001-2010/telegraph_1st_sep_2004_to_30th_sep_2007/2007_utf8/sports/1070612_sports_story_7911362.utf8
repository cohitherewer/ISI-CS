Bangalore: The BCCI and senior cricketers appear to have sorted out the endorsement issue smoothening the way to sign up fresh contracts which were pending from October last. 

Coming out of a meeting with the BCCI committee, captain Rahul Dravid told reporters that the contracts issue had been sorted out and that the discussions were fruitful. 

 We have placed our proposals before the committee. They will in turn place it at the BCCI working committee meeting in New Delhi tomorrow, Dravid said without commenting further. 

The Indian captain was accompanied in the meeting by senior pros Sachin Tendulkar, Anil Kumble and Sourav Ganguly. 

According to sources, the BCCI is set to remove the cap on individual endorsements. 

The BCCI is learnt to have agreed to allow the players to have 40 days of appearance/ sHooting for private sponsors. Besides, the flat retainership of Rs 5 lakh for all players irrespective of their seniority could also be increased to Rs 10 lakh. 

The BCCI treasurer N. Srinivasan said the contracts would be signed in the next few days. 

Srinivasan refused to spell out what exactly the four Team India seniors had demanded and even said that there was no question of any demands from the players. 

We are not separate entities. The BCCI and the players are the same. It is purely an internal matter, he said. 

Apart from Srinivasan, vice-president Shashank Manohar and former chief I.S. Bindra were on the BCCI committee to deal with the contracts issue. 

The contracts, due from October 1 last year, could not be signed before Team Indias departure for the World Cup in early March. Another effort before Indias tour of Bangladesh in May also produced no result.

 Mondal doubtful for tie vs Syria

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: India were highly unimpressive in their 1-0 victory over Bangladesh in the Nehru Cup on Monday but it helped them earn a cash award of Rs 5 lakhs. 

The AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, who watched the proceedings, called the Indian captain Bhaichung Bhutia and announced the cash award for winning back to back matches. 

Despite the victory, India were left a worried lot as stopper back Deepak Mondal had to leave the field in the 51st minute because of a knee injury. He was taken to hospital after the match and coach Bob Houghton was not sure whether Mondal would be able to play against Syria on Thursday. 

Though Mondal said he was hoping to get fit by Wednesday, the coach was not sure. I doubt it very much, he said. In the first match against Cambodia, mid-fielder NP Pradeep got injured and is struggling to get back to fitness.

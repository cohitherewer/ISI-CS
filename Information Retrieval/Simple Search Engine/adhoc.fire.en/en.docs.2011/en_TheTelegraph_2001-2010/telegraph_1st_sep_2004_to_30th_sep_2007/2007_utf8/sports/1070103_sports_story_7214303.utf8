Perth: Tatiana Golovin gave France a 1-0 lead in their Hopman Cup match against Australia on Tuesday after a measured 7-5, 6-2 victory over Alicia Molik. 

The world number 22 recovered from 1-3 down in the opener to take the first set in 54 minutes before breaks in the first and seventh of the second set helped her wrap up the match in an hour and 22 minutes. 

Frances Jerome Haehnel will play Mark Philippoussis in the mens singles before the concluding mixed doubles. 

Both teams went into the match with winning records in Group A, France having won their bow against the US while hosts Australia stunned top seeds Russia in the tournament opener on Saturday. 

The Russians kept alive their chances of a maiden triumph in the event by beating the US 2-1 in Tuesdays first Group A contest. 

Dmitry Tursunov and Nadia Petrova combined to beat Mardy Fish and Ashley Harkleroad 6-3, 7-5 in the mixed doubles to claim their first win of the mixed team competition. 

Petrova swept past Harkleroad 6-3, 6-0 in the opening singles before Fish kept the tie alive with an impressive 6-1, 6-4 triumph over world number 22 Tursunov. 

I felt a bit more, not confident, but with a match under my belt I felt more comfortable on the court, the 24-year-old Petrova said in a courtside interview. 

Its so good to be out here competing, its completely different to practising and I wanted to start the New Year on a good note. 

Petrova, winner of five titles in 2006, clearly shook off the rust that dogged her performance against Molik, against whom she lost in three sets in the tournaments opening match. 

The Americans, who can no longer make Fridays final at the Burswood Dome, were kept in the tie with a fine performance from Fish in the mens singles rubber. 

The world number 47 served superbly to down Tursunov in just 58 minutes. Fish fired 13 aces, the last one clinching the final game and match after he had trailed 0-40. 

World number six Petrova used her superior hitting from the back of the court to ease past world number 86 Harkleroad in 67 minutes.

Calcutta: Against the backdrop of inclement weather, the curtains came down on the third edition of the Sunfeast Open, with Maria Kirilenko capturing the sinles title. As organisers and players weigh the pros and cons, The Telegraph takes a quick look at some of the happenings, both on court and off, of the past week. 

Here goes: 

BEST DRESSED: A toss-up between Daniela Hantuchova and Maria Kirilenko both in saris and both looking stunning. Perhaps Danielas longer legs gave her the slight edge. Opinion is divided and the jury is still out. 

BREATH OF FRESH AIR: The Sania Mirza-Mahesh Bhupathi exhibition on a barge on the Hoogly. For the record, Sania won 2-1. 

HEARTBREAKERS: The main one was, of course, Sania Mirzas withdrawal. Will-she-wont-she? finally became a she wont. And that perhaps took the wind out of the meets sails. 

The second came during Mondays first round with the ouster of top seed Marion Bartoli. And before the crowd could say Wimbledon, the Big W runner-up was off on the first flight out of town on Tuesday. 

MAJOR ATTRACTION: Sachin Tendulkar, of course! Be it the Sachin-Sania joint press conference, or the mixed doubles exhibition between Sachin-Kirilenko and Bhaichung Bhutia- Bhupathi, it was the cricket maestro all the way. Sachin at his most relaxed, enjoying the evening to the hilt. 

MINOR DISTRACTION: At the cooking pasta with players event, an over-zealous Sunitha Rao set the napkin she was using to hold a dish on fire. I am more into baking cakes and pies dont do much cooking, she said, sheepishly. 

THE MIRCHI FACTOR: Belarusian Tatiana Poutchek may not have gone further than the quarters, but her on-court antics made for pure entertainment. She threw her racket no less than 15 times per match! In-between, she found time to self-admonish, make faces at the fans, whip up an argument with the chair umpire and smile wryly each time the linesmen made wrong calls. 

OF CAKES AND SPICES: Russian players Julia Efremova and Ekaterina Ivanova mixed a Christmas cake with great gusto at the hotel where the players were put up. Decked up in saris and finery! But what shutterbugs found more interesting was Efremova and Ivanova taking a dip in the hotel pool before the event! 

THE SOUR NOTE: The linesmen. They got it wrong most times. And were frequently overruled by the chair umpire. The correct calls evoked loud cheers from the crowd. 

THE BITTER PILL: The crowds. Or rather the lack of them. A pity, that. 

THE COLOUR FACTOR: Daniela, again, at a rangoli function, all dolled up in a salwar-kameez. 

RAISING A FEW LAUGHS: A tte--tte between Hantuchova and Sweta Bhupathi on what it is like to partner Mahesh, on and off the court.

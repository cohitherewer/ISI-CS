 - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL

 Sir Ian Botham on knighthood and his charity work 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sir Ian Botham

London: Sir Ian Botham, saluted by Mike Brearley as a near genius, spoke to The Telegraph on Monday morning. Now 51, the former England captain was candid. Witty too. 

The following are excerpts 

On whether life has changed after knighthood 

(Laughs) No Its just the same. 

On being addressed as Sir Ian 

Its something very nice, but I dont go around with a sign on my head which says Im a knight Its nice to be recognised for the work Ive done Ive been honoured... Being addressed as Sir Ian goes with it 

On what got him involved with Leukaemia Research (a British charitable organisation) 

Id broken my leg in the 1977 series against Australia and to reach the physiotherapy unit in the Taunton hospital, I had to go through the childrens ward They were dying (of cancer) It felt terrible that they wouldnt be around in a couple of weeks or months Till then, I didnt even know what leukaemia meant That one experience changed me and I went around creating awareness about the disease. 

On whether some other experience also affected him in a big way 

So many Leukaemia remains an ongoing concern. 

On the marathon walks he started in the mid-Eighties 

Ive already walked over 8,000 miles When I started, there was a 20 per cent chance of survival Today, the percentage is 80 and England, I understand, leads the world in leukaemia research The good thing is that many of those who had leukaemia and joined me in the earliest walks now come and walk with their children Its so satisfying. (After a pause) If Im not doing walks, Im organising charity balls Golfing events All to raise funds. As you know, Im president of Leukaemia Research. Those who know me well will tell you I dont quit once I start something. 

On whether he plans to extend his work to India 

Look, leukaemia is worldwide and the research being done is going to benefit patients all over in India, Pakistan Not only in England. Its not a one-dimensional thing Im also, for example, involved with the tsunami work in Sri Lanka There are many strings to the bow 

On whether more cricketers should follow his and Imran Khans example 

A lot of them do They support charities and so on I get a lot of sportsmen, not cricketers alone, to help on my walks Help in the raising of funds. If one has the will and determination to do something, then time can be found. 

On whether it has been difficult living up to the image of a role model 

I havent created that image In any case, its better living up to that image than having your butt kicked around on the field That image comes if you give people pleasure When playing, I was an entertainer Gave people pleasure If I had a good day in the middle, there was a fair chance everybody watching would also have been having a good day. 

On the defining moment in his career 

Too many Too many The first time I played for my club The first time I played for Somerset The first time I played for England 

On whether there was a regret when he called it a day (1992) 

I dont have regrets. I believe things happen for a reason If Id wanted to continue playing, I wouldnt have retired. 

On whether he envied a contemporary 

No The grass is seen as greener on the other side. Not for me, though Id really like to meet the person who has had as good a life as mine. 

On the other great allrounders of his time Imran, Richard Hadlee, Kapil Dev 

I was honoured to be around at the same time It was a great period to play in and we enjoyed the rivalry Enjoyed the intensity of competition. 

On the lack of quality allrounders in recent years 

How many Muhammad Alis have we had? How many Sachin Tendulkars? They come along once in a while Who knows, in ten years, we could have six good allrounders Comes and goes 

On whether, after a legal battle, hes now on talking terms with Imran 

Ive never had bad blood with anybody I dont have a problem with Imran. 

On taking to golf in a big way 

I think I first went to a course when I was four years old My handicap is seven Ive got many friends on the circuit Ernie Els, Sam Torrence 

On Tiger Woods 

I admire him Hes exceptional and has done golf a lot of good He and Jack Nicklaus have done so much for that sport Nobody can be a Tiger Woods without his mental toughness, his ability, skill His determination The tunnel-vision The ability to sacrifice If you want something hard enough, youve got to work for it Make sacrifices You need to do everything. Woods hasnt been a flash in the pan. 

On the sacrifices he made 

Plenty Im a happy man today, but had to make sacrifices when I was playing Couldnt, for example, give enough time to the family Theres no choice if you want to be the best and want to compete with the best. 

On whether he has been superstitious 

Not particularly. 

On son Liam 

Hes 30 now He had a neck injury and retired from rugby He runs a successful travel agency. 

Finally, on how would he like to be remembered on-field heroics or off-the-field achievements 

(Laughs again) Well, I dont quite intend going anywhere just yet! Its not part of my game plan Its not so much about how I want to be remembered, its about how people want to remember me If Im not here, it wont matter what I think

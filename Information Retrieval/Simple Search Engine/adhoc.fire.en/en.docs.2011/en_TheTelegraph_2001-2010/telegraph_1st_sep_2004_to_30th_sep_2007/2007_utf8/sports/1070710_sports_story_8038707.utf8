 Kapil dares BCCI to sack him

 Kapil Dev 

New Delhi: Former captain Kapil Dev has dared the BCCI to sack him from the chairmans post at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) for his alignment with the Indian Cricket League (ICL). 

[Earlier in an interview to The Telegraph on the issue of heading the NCA, he had said: If the BCCI wants me to resign, then its another matter... I dont see a problem in holding positions in separate organisations... There or here, my goal is the same... In any case Im not employed by the BCCI.] 

Indias lone World Cup winning captain earned the boards wrath by joining Essel Groups ICL as the chairman of its executive board and the BCCI, in its recent working committee meeting, decided that no individual would be allowed to be with both the parties at the same time. 

BCCI shot a letter to Kapil asking him not to align with the ICL, but the former allrounder was unperturbed. 

I have already sent my reply to them, Kapil told a television channel. They can remove me from the NCA if they want to. 

They only wanted me to contribute to the game of cricket and when I am doing so they cannot challenge me. If I can do something for the game and the young cricketers through Indian Cricket League, I will not budge, he asserted. 

Recently, former stumper and ex-chairman of selection committee More resigned from the secretarys post at the Baroda Cricket Association to join the ICL board. 

Kapil was also aghast at the BCCI decision to stop pension to former players who align with the ICL. I did not go to them asking for pension and if they want to stop it, what can I do? Let them stop it. 

Asked if he should have asked for BCCI permission before joining ICL, Kapil said, I dont need to ask the BCCI for every small thing. 

Kapil was clueless as to what made the BCCI see a potential rival in the ICL and target those associated with the league. 

Why do they see ICL as a parallel or rebel body? The BCCI is trying to promote the game in India and if somebody else is pumping in more money why is it a problem with them? 

This league can help the BCCI only. This can help Indian cricket and shape so many careers. What is BCCIs problem? he asked. 

BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah, however, made it clear that former players like Kapil would have to make a choice. 

We have decided not to recognise ICL in our working committee meeting as no state association was in its favour. We dont want to promote anybody who wants to be a parallel body. We have a policy and there will not be any rethink on this, Shah told the channel. 

A few months back, the Essel Group had launched the ICL with much fanfare, announcing that some top names of world cricket would take part in it. 

Speculation is rife that legends like Brian Lara, Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath will join the league that promises a huge prize money.

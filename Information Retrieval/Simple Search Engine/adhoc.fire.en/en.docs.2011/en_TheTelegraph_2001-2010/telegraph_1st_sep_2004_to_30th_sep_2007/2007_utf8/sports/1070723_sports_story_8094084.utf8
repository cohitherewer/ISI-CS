 Schumi gets a corner

Nuerburgring: Germanys seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher on Sunday became the first driver to have a corner named after him at the Nuerburgring circuit, less than a year after he retired. 

Schumacher, who grew up in the nearby town of Kerpen, won five of his 91 Grand Prix victories in the Eiffel hills near Germanys western border with Luxembourg. 

Im absolutely thrilled to be privileged to experience a situation like this, Schumacher told the crowd of 135,000 before unveiling a banner spread on a hoarding around the S-corner at a ceremony at the start of the European Grand Prix. 

Schumacher was then the first to drive through the newly named corner.

 Barreto helps Bagan draw with Churchill

Margao: Mohun Bagan fought back through a Jose Ramirez Barreto brace to hold Churchill Brothers 2-2 in the ONGC National Football League at Nehru Stadium here on Saturday. 

Churchill Brothers, who dictated terms for a major part of the encounter, scored through Nicholas Muyoti (58th) and Man of the Match Odafe Onkeya Okolie (66th). 

Bagan, reduced to 10 men four minutes before the interval, fought back in the last quarter of the match to find the equaliser through Barreto (72nd and 88th). 

The draw took Churchill to 23 points from 16 matches, while the Bengal giants have 20 points from 15 appearances. 

In Mumbai, defending champions Mahindra United wasted a penalty late in the second-half against Air India to settle for a goalless draw. 

Mahindra, in a must-win situation, looked lacklustre in their approach till an opportunity came their way in the 85th minute. Striker Pomeyie Mensah was tripped inside the box by rival defender A.K. Martins. 

But Mensah took a weak shot at the goal from the spot which was easily saved by custodian Raju Ekka with a dive to the left post. (PTI)

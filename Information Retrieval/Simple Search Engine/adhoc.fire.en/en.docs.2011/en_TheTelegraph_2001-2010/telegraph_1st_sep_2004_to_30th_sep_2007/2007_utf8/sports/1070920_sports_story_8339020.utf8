Durban: Justin Kemps aggressive batting spurred South Africa to a six-wicket win over New Zealand in their ICC World Twenty20 Super Eight match on Wednesday. 

Kemp smashed six fours and six sixes in his 56-ball 89 not out, the top score in South Africas reply of 158 for four to New Zealands total of 153 for eight. 

South Africa, who beat England in their first Super Eight match on Sunday, now have four points from two games in the group and face India in their last game. 

New Zealand, who have beaten both India and England, have four points from three games, with semi-final places going to the top two in each of the two Super Eight groups. 

Fast bowler Morne Morkel took four for 17 to lead a South African fightback after Lou Vincent (32) and Brendon McCullum (38) had put on 68 for New Zealands first wicket. 

Morkel was denied the first five-wicket haul in Twenty20 Internationals when umpire Billy Doctrove ruled that the delivery that bowled Mark Gillespie in Morkels last over was a no-ball. 

New Zealand fell away after their sturdy opening stand and they depended heavily on Craig McMillans unbeaten 48 to post a respectable total. 

McMillan and Jacob Oram (15) shared 41 for the fifth wicket, New Zealands only other noteworthy stand. 

In South Africas reply, Kemp and Mark Boucher (23) put on 65 for the fourth wicket. 

South Africa lost couple of early wickets to slump to 17 for two and was reduced to 45 for three in just over seven overs before Kemp and Boucher (23) steadied the boat and then Shaun Pollock (16 not out), beneficiary of a dropped catch, joined Kemp to see the side through. 

Shane Bond removed Graeme Smith (2) and Mark Gillespie scalped AB De Villiers (1) to put pressure on the hosts and losing Herschelle Gibbs (19) further complicated things for South Africa. 

Pollock helped Kemp complete the job with an unbroken stand of 48 and South Africa won with five balls to spare. 

Kemp was hardly perturbed as he went hard after the New Zealand bowlers, with Jacob Oram bearing the brunt of his fury. 

Needing two for the win, Kemp hoisted Mark Gillespie over long-on to seal the match in his teams favour and was adjudged Man of the Match for his rollicking knock.

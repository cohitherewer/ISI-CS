 Digvijay one shot off lead

Manila: Digvijay Singh overcame a disappointing double bogey on the back nine to card three-under 69, the best among the Indian contingent at the $300,000 Philippines Open at the Wack-Wack Golf and Country Club. 

Digvijay was lying tied seventh but only one shot off the lead as six players shared the lead at four-under 68. 

The six players sharing the lead included two local Filipino players, one pro, Carito Villaroman and amateur Jay Bayron, besides Chinas Liang Wen-Chong, the 1999 Philippine Open winner Anthony Kang, Jason Knutzon and Chinese Taipeis Wang Ter-Chang.

 Lara inspired Gibbs achievement

Basseterre: A spark of inspiration from Brian Lara spurred Herschelle Gibbs to create World Cup history when he lofted six sixes in one over against The Netherlands on Friday. 

Gibbs blasted the ball back over hapless leg-spinner Daan van Bunges head four times and over the ropes on the on-side twice to become the first player to rack up 36 runs in a single over in a one-day International. 

Id seen Brian Charles Lara hit a few (sixes) in Test match cricket and thought I could do something similar. Today happened to be that day, Gibbs told a news conference following his teams 221-run victory on Friday. 

The last two balls landed in the right areas for me to have a go and luckily I didnt miscue either of those. If the balls in the right place, Ill try anything, he said. 

Despite the remarkable performance, the South African refused to get carried away. 

The World Cup only happens every four years and it was good to get some runs in the manner that I did, he said. 

The six sixes were an added bonus. It was just good to spend some time out in the middle again. 

Dutch captain Luuk van Troost dealt with the humiliation with good humour. 

Before the game, we said lets make history today by beating South Africa, Van Troost said. We made history but not by beating them. 

Van Troost related the conversation he had with Van Bunge during the bowlers nightmare over. 

After the third one, I told him (Van Bunge) to try to bowl a quicker delivery, and he said, I just did. There were a few good balls, and a few shit ones as well. 

The effects of the mauling lingered with Van Bunge. He (Van Bunge) had some flashbacks, he started laughing when he was sitting in the dressing-room. 

Van Troost offered no excuses for his teams big loss. I was quite happy with the start but they totally outplayed us, he said. This was world class batting and the small boundaries didnt help us. In the end we didnt bowl well enough. (Reuters)

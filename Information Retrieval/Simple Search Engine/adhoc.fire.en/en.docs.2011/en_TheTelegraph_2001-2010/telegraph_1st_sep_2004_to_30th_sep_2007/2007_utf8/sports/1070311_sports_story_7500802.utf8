 Consolation win for East Zone

Mumbai: Seasoned campaigner Shib Shankar Paul, unfazed by the pressure situation, bowled a superb final over as East Zone carved out a thrilling three-run victory over North Zone in their concluding Deodhar Trophy league match at the Wankhede Stadium here on Saturday. 

Needing eight runs of the final over, the Bengal medium-pacer coming for his second spell, kept things extremely tight as he conceded just four runs before ending with three dot balls to see his side through. 

Apart from captain Dinesh Mongia (71) and wicketkeeper batsman Pankaj Dharmani (51 n.o.) none of the other batsmen could manage to force things. 

 Ultimately they finished with the score of 235 for five. 

Precariously placed at four for 27 after opting to bat, the recovery path for East was shaped by Manoj Tewari (89) and captain Deep Dasgupta (63) who put on superb 150 runs for the fifth wicket.

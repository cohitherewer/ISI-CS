The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Panel may play safe, forward both names

 - NEXT ICC PRESIDENT 

 Race between Sharad Pawar and David Morgan 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Mumbai: Theres speculation that the Nominations Committee of the International Cricket Council (ICC), empowered to recommend who should succeed Percy Sonn as president in June 2008, may play it safe and forward the names of both candidates Indias Sharad Pawar and Englands David Morgan to

 the all-powerful Executive Board. 

The Committee, headed by former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Dr A.C. Muthiah, will place its recommendation before the Executive Board in Cape Town on Thursday. 

Bob Merriman, Steve Camacho, John Blair, Mueen Afzal and Imran Khwaja are the other members of the Committee. 

Indications are that the Committee, which is probably split 3-3, is going to forward both names... Of course, nothing is confirmed, but that indeed is a very strong possibility, a

 top source told The Telegraph on Tuesday. 

The Executive Board, in turn, will forward its own recommendation to the annual conference (or the annual general meeting). For a candidate to be successful, he must secure 7 of the 10 Full Members votes. 

Currently, Pawar is understood to have the support of four besides India Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh. South Africa and the West Indies are being strongly wooed. 

Meanwhile, one learns former BCCI president Inderjit Singh Bindra and one of the current vice-presidents, Lalit Modi, are both in Cape Town to lobby for Pawar.

 SA coach all praise for Sourav

Belfast: The return of Sourav Ganguly has made Team India a more resolute unit, feels South African coach Mickey Arthur, who is still mystified as to why the former captain was kept out of the ODI fold for so long. 

I personally think Sourav Ganguly in the squad gives a huge amount back to India. Sourav still has a presence, Arthur said. 

The South Africa coach said he still cannot understand the reasons for Indias decision of keeping the former captain out of last years one-day series in South Africa. 

Sourav, who has scored over 10,000 runs in 293 ODIs at an average of close to 42, was out of the one-day team for almost 15 months before being recalled in time for the World Cup. 

I think hes a quality player and it still mystifies me how he wasnt in the squad in South Africa. 

I think he seems to have given a steely resilience back to India, Arthur added. 

Sourav was stripped of captaincy and subsequently dropped from the Test as well as ODI sides. 

The 34-year-old, however, resurrected his career after being included in the Test side for the tour of South Africa to eventually win back his place in the ODI fold as well.

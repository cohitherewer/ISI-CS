 Jeev Milkha tied 35th after Day I

Hilton Head Island: It was back to work for Jeev Milkha Singh after his tough Masters week as he opened with an even-par 71 in the Heritage Classic in Hilton Head, South Carolina, on Thursday. 

Jeev played a solid round with four birdies and four bogeys to be tied for 35th place after the satisfactory opening round. 

American Jerry Kelly continued with his Masters form and took the lead with a superb eight-under 63, while Ernie Els put away last weeks misery with a 65 that placed him second. 

Masters champion Zach Johnson also got back to work after three days of celebrity meetings and TV guest appearances, a one-under 70 tying him for the 20th place. 

But there was disappointment for Daniel Chopra, who shot one-under 70 only to be disqualified for signing a wrong card. 

Chopra, who has missed just three of 10 cuts this year on the PGA Tour, was disqualified for taking an incorrect drop on the 185-yard par-3 17th hole. 

Jeev, who started from the tenth tee and was one-over at the turn, said: I am quite happy with my round. Obviously, it could have been better, but given how demanding last weeks Masters was physically and mentally, I am happy with my start.

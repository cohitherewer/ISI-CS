 Surgery for Trescothick 

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Marcus Trescothick 

Marcus Trescothick underwent a double hernia operation on Wednesday and will face a race to be fit for the start of the County season. 

Trescothicks exit from the Ashes tour with a stress-related illness looked to have ended his international career but a good start to the season would again tempt England to turn to one of their best players of recent years. 

Trescothick is targeting Somersets opening Liverpool Victoria County Championship match against Middlesex at Taunton, starting on April 18, as his comeback game. 

He said: The recovery period is expected to be four to six weeks. My left groin was giving me pain at the end of last summer. I went up to Manchester because the surgeon there, Ian MacLennan, is an expert in this field and has operated on many professional sportsmen. 

Somerset chief executive Richard Gould said: Marcus should be fully recovered from the operation by the time the season starts. 

It will be like having a new player as he has spent so much time with England in recent years and the prospect of him opening the batting with Justin Langer is a really exciting one for us. 

The ECB medical staff will continue to monitor Marcus progress following the operation and will be in close consultation with Somerset coaching and medical personnel during his rehabilitation. 

The 31-year-old had a mixed summer last year, scoring a century in the first Test against Sri Lanka but struggling against Pakistan. 

Meanwhile, another Ashes absentee, fast bowler Simon Jones, will make his latest injury comeback when Glamorgan open their County Championship campaign next month. 

Jones missed the Ashes tour and is out of this months World Cup after surgery on his injured knee last June but the 28-year-old is due to return to pre-season training next week.

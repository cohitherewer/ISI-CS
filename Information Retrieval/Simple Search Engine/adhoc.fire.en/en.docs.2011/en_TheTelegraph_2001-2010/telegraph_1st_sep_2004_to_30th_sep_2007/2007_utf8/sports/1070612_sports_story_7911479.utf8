 Trezeguet to quit Juventus

Turin: David Trezeguet will not be playing for Juventus next season. 

Theres no possibility of me staying at Juventus, the France striker said after Juventus 2-3 loss to Spezia in the final round of the Serie B. Theres no more room for negotiations. 

The 29-year-old Trezeguet had been in talks with the Turin club to extend his contract beyond June 2008. 

If (the club) had said that they wanted me, it would have been much better, rather than offer me a ridiculous contract, Trezeguet said. (AP)

 Anand shoots into sole lead

 Viswanathan Anand 

Mexico City: Viswanathan Anand jumped into sole lead in the World Championship after beating Russian Grandmaster Peter Svidler in an engrossing fifth-round encounter on Tuesday. 

Anand (3.5 points) was closely followed by defending champion Vladimir Kramnik, Alexander Grischuk and Boris Gelfand. 

On an action packed day three of the four games ended decisively Kramnik slipped to second after splitting the point with Peter Leko. Grischuk moved into reckoning by defeating fellow-Russian Alexander Morozevich. 

Israeli Gelfand joined Kramnik and Grischuk in second spot after outwitting the fancied Levon Aronian of Armenia. Both Gelfand and Grischuk registered their first win in the championship. 

Anand gave yet another display of his mastery of the Spanish Opening against Svidler. Svidler decided to play for the initiative by sacrificing a pawn in the opening with the Marshall Gambit. 

Anand defended solidly and hung on to the extra pawn without allowing his opponent to dominate. The game swung Anands way after Svidler made a passive knight retreat on the 32nd move. 

This allowed Anand enough breathing space to activate his queen and trade off some pieces. Svidler hastened the end by desperately trying to fan the dying embers of his attack and suffered further material loss. He resigned in a hopeless position after 39 moves. (PTI)

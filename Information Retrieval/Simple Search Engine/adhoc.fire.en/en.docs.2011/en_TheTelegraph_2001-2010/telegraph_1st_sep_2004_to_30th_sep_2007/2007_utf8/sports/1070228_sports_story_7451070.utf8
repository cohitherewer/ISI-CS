Mumbai: A day before embarking on the World Cup mission, coach Greg Chappell promised a fighting performance from his team which had the flexibility and experience to clinch the coveted trophy. 

Chappell said the team was well prepared to counter the conditions in the Caribbean and now it was only a matter of executing the plans on the field. 

I think we are in as good a position as we could hope to be. We have a good, balanced squad, good experience combined with youth. We have good variety in bowling and batting that would give us a wide range of options no matter what the conditions or the opposition, Chappell said at the pre-departure media conference here Tuesday. 

Chappell admitted that the players will be under some pressure as the main eight teams were evenly balanced. 

We are going to have a lot of close games. Probably a lot of middle scoring games which means they are going to be close games. 

The pressure will be on and thats where our experience and flexibility are going to be very positive for us, Chappell said. 

Skipper Rahul Dravid, who was also present at the conference, expressed confidence and said the goal was to play tough and fighting cricket in the mega event to be held for the first time in the West Indies. 

Our goal is to go and play good cricket and try our best. We want to compete and play some tough and fighting cricket, take one step at a time, he said. 

Dravid insisted that no unfit players were in the team and that he was happy with the pace bowling department. 

I am quite happy with the pace bowling. Munaf Patel has come back well from his (ankle) injury and has become one of our best bowlers in one-dayers over the last 15 games. 

Sree (Sreesanth) is a wicket-taking bowler. Zaheer (Khan) and Ajit (Agarkar) are playing well, he said. 

On Irfan Pathan, who was unfit for the entire duration of the four-match series against Sri Lanka at home, Dravid felt he needed a little more bowling under his belt before Indias first match. He however added that the Baroda left arm bowler was fit and has overcome his shoulder problem. 

Dravid said the middle overs was just one crucial area and not the only one for teams to surmount during the World Cup. 

Its just one important area. But I feel all the teams can improve in this area. All the teams now know what to do in the first 15 and last 10 overs. Thats why more teams are focusing on the middle overs now, he said. 

Chappell too came out in support of Pathan who had to prove his match fitness by playing in a Deodhar Trophy tie for West Zone against Central Zone at Ahmedabad two days ago. 

Irfan is a good cricketer with a very good one-day record in the last two years. In the West Indies he will be given the opportunities (to deliver), the Indian coach said. 

Dravid shared his coachs opinion that the World Cup would be a close affair but felt Australia were still the favourites despite their recent losing run. 

Chappell felt that Australia will come out strongly from their recent reversals. 

New Zealand showed they are a good side and England have improved. Its going to be an even competition. Australia will be affected by the injuries to Brett Lee and (Andrew) Symonds. 

But the losses would have made them (Australia) a lot hungrier and more determined to do well, he said. 

Asked whether Sachin Tendulkar would bat one down like he had done in one of the matches against Sri Lanka at home, Chappell said: Yes, thats an option we have. But we will wait till we reach the West Indies to decide on these matters.

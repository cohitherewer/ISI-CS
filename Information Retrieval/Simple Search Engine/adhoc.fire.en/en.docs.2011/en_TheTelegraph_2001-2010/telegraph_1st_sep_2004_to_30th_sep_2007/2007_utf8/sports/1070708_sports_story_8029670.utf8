 Chopra misses cut, Choi shares lead

Bethesda: Daniel Chopra missed the cut, but Asian star K.J. Choi of Korea took a share of the lead at the USPGA Tours AT amp;T National at the Blue Course at Congressional Country Club here on Friday. 

With rounds of 66 and 67, Choi has a seven-under total of 133 heading into the weekend and shares the lead with Australian Stuart Appleby (67). 

Tournament host Tiger Woods also shot his way back into contention, carding a 66 to move up to a tie for 12th place, six shots off the pace. 

Chopra started with a birdie on the first but gave that back on seventh. He added another birdie on ninth to turn in one-under par. 

But he struck a disastrous patch with a triple bogey on 10th and back to back double bogeys on 11th and 12th to drop seven shots in three holes.

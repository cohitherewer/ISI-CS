 Jayasuriya anchors win

Johannesburg: Sanath Jayasuriya made his second half-century in two days as Sri Lanka eased to a comfortable seven-wicket victory over New Zealand in their ICC Twenty20 match in Johannesburg on Saturday. 

Jayasuriya, who scored 88 off 44 balls against Kenya on Friday at the same venue, took same number of deliveries on Saturday to score 61 as Sri Lanka cruised to 168 for three in 18.5 overs. 

The left-handers top-class innings included six fours and three sixes as he set Sri Lanka on the road to victory with a first-wicket stand of 82 off 46 balls with Upul Tharanga (37). 

Sri Lankas momentum slowed when spinner Daniel Vettori removed Tharanga and medium-pacer Scott Styris dismissed Kumar Sangakkara (14), both caught in the deep, but captain Mahela Jayawardena provided the finishing touches with his 35 not out off 18 deliveries. 

Vettori (4-0-23-2) and Styris (3-0-16-1) were the pick of the Kiwi bowlers, while Shane Bond had a bad day in office as he conceded 45 runs in his four overs and dropped Jayasuriya twice in successive deliveries. 

Earlier, Ross Taylors half-century enabled New Zealand to post a competitive total. 

Taylor scored 62 off 43 balls, with three fours and three sixes, as New Zealand scored 164 for seven in their 20 overs. 

Taylor came to the crease after New Zealand had lost two early wickets.

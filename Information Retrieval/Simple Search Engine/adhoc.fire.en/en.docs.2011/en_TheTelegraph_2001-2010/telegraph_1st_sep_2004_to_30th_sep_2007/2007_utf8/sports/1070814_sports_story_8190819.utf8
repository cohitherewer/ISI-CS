The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Winning Montreal a pleasant surprise

 - I will be playing with Sania at the US Open, says Bhupathi

 Bhupathi and Vizner in Montreal 

Calcutta: Write off Mahesh Bhupathi at your own peril. 

Just when you had started wondering where his next title would come from, the doubles wizard has pulled a rabbit out of his hat. 

Another first-time partner, and bulls eye straightaway. This time with Czech veteran Pavel Vizner, in the Montreal Masters. 

Just like last year when the 10-time Grand Slam champion had won back-to-back tournaments with Mario Ancic. 

Just like last year when he had gone without a crown for the first eight months before striking gold with the Croat in Beijing and Mumbai. 

Yeah, winning Montreal was a pleasant surprise, Bhupathi told The Telegraph hours after he and Vizner beat Paul Hanley and Kevin Ullyett 6-4, 6-4 in the final. 

Not only were we playing together for the first time, it was a Masters event with a terrific field We beat three of the top teams in business en route to the title, Bhupathi said, while watching Novak Djokovic tame Roger Federer in the singles final which followed the doubles match. 

This is also my first Masters success in a very long time. Three years, to be precise, the last one having come with Leander Paes in Toronto (2004). 

Victim No. 1 for Bhupathi and Vizner were fourth seeds Leander Paes and Martin Damm, followed by numero uno pair Bob and Mike Bryan. And finally, fifth seeds Hanley and Ullyett. 

Bhupathi didnt pick the victory over Team Paes for special mention. All were good wins, especially the one against the Bryans who have been on fire this season. The American twins reached 11 finals in 12 tournaments before the Montreal meet, winning eight of those. 

Sundays triumph gave Bhupathi his 40th career doubles crown on the mens Tour, putting him in an exclusive club. Jonas Bjorkman, Daniel Nestor, Mark Knowles, Mike and Bob Bryan are the active players to have crossed the 40-title barrier, with Leander Paes just one shy of joining them. 

Getting to 50 would be nice, of course Id like to reach there Lets see how it goes in the next couple of years, said Bhupathi. 

The biggest irony of it all is the fact that the 33-year-old Indian wont get another chance to play with his winning partner for the rest of this year. Pavels regular partner Lukas (Dlouhy) took a week off, so he was free, explained Bhupathi. Interestingly, the 37-year-old Vizner doubles up as the 24-year-old Dlouhys coach. 

Bhupathi, who hasnt had a settled partner since parting ways with Radek Stepanek after Wimbledon, has four fresh partners lined up for upcoming tournaments. 

 He is playing with Andy Murrays brother Jamie at this weeks Cincinnati Masters, then it will be Nenad Zimonjic in New Haven and the US Open, followed by Rohan Bopanna in Beijing. He has, however, kept options open for his own tournament in Mumbai (next months Kingfisher Airlines Open). 

There are no doubts about his partner for the US Open mixed doubles. I can tell you that I will be playing with Sania (Mirza), said Bhupathi, who was anything but confident when he visited Calcutta last month. 

There was some talk of Sania playing with Paes in the years last Grand Slam, but Bhupathi has obviously won this off-the-field battle.

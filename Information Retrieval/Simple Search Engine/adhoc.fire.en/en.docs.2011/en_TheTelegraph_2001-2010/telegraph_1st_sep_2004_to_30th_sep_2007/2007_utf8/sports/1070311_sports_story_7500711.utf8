The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bagan held goalless by Sporting

Margao: Some resolute defending enabled Sporting Clube de Goa hold Calcutta giants Mohun Bagan to a goalless draw in a National Football League match for the ONGC Cup at the Nehru Stadium here on Saturday. 

With this result, Sporting took their tally to nine points from eight matches while Mohun Bagan have eight from as many games. 

Both teams started at a fast pace and the visitors, despite the absence of some key players, held sway putting the Sporting defence under pressure. 

They had the best chance to break through in the dying minutes of the first half when Dulal Biswas laid a square pass to PC Lalawmpuia inside the box who shot straight at the keeper Luis Barreto. 

Biswas, who overlapped often on the right flank, tested Barreto with a long-ranger, but the keeper was equal to the task. 

Sporting, who found their groove in the latter part of the first period, twice came close to scoring. 

Joe Rodrigues shot from inside the box deflected out off defender Mehrajuddin Wadaos leg in the 31st minute, and a minute later, Dudu Omagbemis header off a Nicholas Rodrigues flag-kick went inches over. 

Sporting coach Clifford Chukwuma introduced Nicolas Nath, the first player of Indian origin to play in the league, to give thrust in their attack, but the striker failed to impress. 

Mohun Bagan who pressed hard in search of a goal were unlucky in the 82nd minute when Biswas shot from the top of the box came back off the crossbar. 

Nicolas Nath had the best chance for Sporting in the dying minutes but the striker failed to cash in as he drove the ball wide from close range.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pathan may make cut 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Allrounder Irfan Pathan, who has been out of Tests and ODIs after the World Cup (not that he got a game in the tournament), stands a good chance of making a one-day comeback. 

Pathan is in the Twenty20 squad, but thats not really being seen as A-grade cricket. 

Hes pretty well-placed for a berth when the selectors pick the squad for the first three ODIs against Australia, one of The Telegraphs sources pointed out on Monday. 

The selectors, with the exception of Venkatapathi Raju (who is doing Twenty20 duty in South Africa), meet in Mumbai on Tuesday afternoon. 

Theres also talk that Bengals Manoj Tiwary could find a place, despite failing in the first Test versus South Africa A. 

The 21-year-old had been selected for the three ODIs in Bangladesh, in May, but had to return home within days for surgery on his right shoulder. 

That kept him out for months. 

If both Pathan and Tiwary make it, then its quite likely that Ajit Agarkar and Rohit Sharma are going to be axed. 

As the squad will have 14 players and not 15 (as on the recent tour of England, where we lost 3-4), somebody has to be dropped before any combination is finalised. 

It appears the axe is straightaway going to fall on Munaf Patel.

 Dhoni to follow Farokh tips

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni 

London: Team Indias No.1 keeper, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, intends following Farokh Engineers advice in the forthcoming three-Test series and the seven ODIs against England. 

I spoke to Mr Engineer in Chelmsford last week... He advised that I gather the ball late... That I watch it till the very end... Im going to follow that on this tour, Dhoni told The Telegraph on Tuesday. 

He added: As the ball wobbles and conditions can change quickly, wicketkeepers tend to struggle in England... However, Im working hard to ensure the errors are eliminated. 

The flamboyant Engineer, who did duty for India in the Sixties and the early Seventies, has been England-based for decades. 

Dhoni, incidentally, has been bowled over by the desserts on offer in the Lords dressing room. Its a special venue, but the desserts are even more special... Dont ask for the names as I havent bothered to find out... 

Clearly, his appetite isnt limited to feasting on the bowling.

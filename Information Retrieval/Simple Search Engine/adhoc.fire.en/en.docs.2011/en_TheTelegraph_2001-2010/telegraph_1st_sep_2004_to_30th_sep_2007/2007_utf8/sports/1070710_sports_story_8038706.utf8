The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Slowness of Big W surface a reality

OUR STAFF REPORTERS

 Mahesh Bhupathi 

Calcutta: Its not only cricket pitches that continue to get slower across the world a good example being the lethargic nature of most surfaces in the West Indies. Fact is that Wimbledon has got the same disease and if anything, the grass there is becoming progressively slower each year. 

On Monday, the day after Federer beat Nadal in five sets to win his fifth consecutive Wimbledon title, The Telegraph spoke to doubles megastar Mahesh Bhupathi in London and two city-based stalwarts, Jaidip Mukerjea and Akhtar Ali. 

Its not a question of feeling the difference, the slowness of the surface at Big W is a reality, Bhupathi said. 

The organisers have had their reasons for doing so, but the slowness of the grass isnt the only reason why Nadal has been doing so well there. After all, you still need to win a good number of matches to reach the final, the doubles ace added. 

Bhupathi first played as a junior in Wimbledon in 1991 and made the mens draw for the first time in 1997. 

Mukerjea and Ali hollered in agreement that slowness of the surface is killing the traditional serve-and-volley game. If this trend continues, according to the duo, clashes resembling the ones between Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe or Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg will never be possible in modern times. 

It may be recalled that the legendary Pete Sampras, who retired from top-level tennis five years ago, also bemoaned the dearth of serve-and-volleyers. He says he is confident he could still challenge the best on grass with his game. 

Mukerjea attributed the shift to heavier balls. The ball is heavier now. It is suited more for baseline play than the strategy of charging up the court and producing a killer volley. 

The spectators point of view is also involved. Earlier, on a typical Wimbledon grasscourt, there were hardly any rallies. A point was won almost in no time. Nowadays, people get to see more rallies and the matches are also becoming lengthy. This is a demand of modern times (with the advent of prime time television), Mukerjea, former Davis Cup captain, pointed out. 

Ali said that players are now physically more fit. In the 80s and 90s, only a few players ruled the roost, but upsets are common now. 

The Federers are continuously analysed and examined by the opponents today. Their physical fitness is also exemplary. Under these circumstances, the serve-and-volley game is not deemed a good ploy, even on grass, Ali, a former national coach, maintained. 

 As Jaidip noted, maybe, its a part of 

 the games evolution.

 FORMULA FOR A FAST SURFACE 

 Grass should be planted on the surface and after a few days, 

 loose soil needs to be spread over it. Use of sand soil 

 is an absolutely no. 

 The grass should be allowed to grow for two months. A light 

 roller has to be run daily after sprinkling little water 

 over the surface. Use of much water before using the roller 

 will make the surface slow. 

 The length of the grass has to be bare minimum ideally, 

 less than half an inch. Taller grass makes the court slow

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I was thinking about Gibbs record: Gayle

 Brian Lara in action on Monday 

Kingston: The West Indies secured a place in the Super Eight round of the World Cup with a comfortable six-wicket win over Zimbabwe on Monday. 

Captain Brian Lara slammed a four and a six off successive balls to secure the win with 13 balls to spare. 

Lara finished 44 not out off 68 balls as the West Indies reached a winning total of 204 for four off 47.5 overs. 

Dwayne Bravo supported with a fluent, unbeaten 37 and shared a match-winning, unbroken fifth wicket partnership of 75 with Lara. 

West Indies openers Chris Gayle and Shivnarine Chanderpaul built the platform for the win with a first-wicket stand of 73. 

Now we are a bit more relaxed but we are still not going to take anything for granted, Gayle said. Its good to be in the Super Eight now so were just looking forward to Ireland and move on from there. 

The West Indies final group D fixture is against Ireland on Friday and Gayle is keen for another win as they would carry an extra two points into the Super Eight should the Irish also qualify. 

After their upset over 1992 champion Pakistan and tie with Zimbabwe, Ireland still has a chance to make the Super Eight. 

We wont be taking anything for granted against them, he said. 

Gayle admitted he had visions of equalling Hershelle Gibbs record six sixes in an over against The Netherlands a few days ago. 

The first of Gayles three huge sixes bounced back off the roof of the new six level Northern Stand at long-on. 

I think thats the biggest six Ive ever hit. It went a long way, Gayle said. Its good the see the ball going over the boundary. Hopefully in the future I can carry on when I get a start. 

I was thinking about Gibbs record when I got the third, but its hard to hit the ball out of the ground here the roof is too high. 

That was a scrappy win but I am glad that we fought it out, said West Indies coach Bennett King. 

It was the kind of track where it was going to take time for people to get in and we did pretty well at that. 

Looking ahead to the match with Ireland, King added: We will take the Ireland game as though it is a Super Eight match. The important thing is to go through top and take two points with us.

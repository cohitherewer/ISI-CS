 Sasi on top despite loss

Sofia: GM K. Sasikiran hung on to his lead despite being defeated by Gata Kamsky in the eighth round of the third Mtel Masters meet. 

Sasikiran, who had white pieces, failed to defend adequately in a keenly contested game which provided chances to both players. 

It was a great recovery by Kamsky, who had been languishing at the bottom of the table till a couple of rounds back. Sasikiran (4.5) is still half a point ahead of Veselin Topalov, Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, Kamsky and Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu. Michael Adams (3.5) brings up the rear. (PTI)

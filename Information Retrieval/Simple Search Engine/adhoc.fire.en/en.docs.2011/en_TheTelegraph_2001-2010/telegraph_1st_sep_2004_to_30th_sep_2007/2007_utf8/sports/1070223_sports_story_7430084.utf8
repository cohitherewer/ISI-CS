 Harbhajan could be the key: Sobers

 - India are a very well-balanced side, says legendary allrounder 

Mumbai: Indias World Cup squad on Thursday came in for praise from the legendary Sir Garfield Sobers, who said it was a well-balanced team and the presence of two quality spinners will stand them in good stead during the mega event. 

Sobers said Sachin Tendulkar could also prove his utility as a bowler on the Caribbean tracks. 

India have a well-balanced team. They have got two good spin bowlers. What people dont realise is that the little man, Sachin Tendulkar, bowls very cleverly. 

Sachin had come out as one of Indias best bowlers when the going got tough because he knows what he is doing and is a clever bowler, Sobers told reporters on the sidelines of an event to promote Barbados tourism. 

The former West Indian captain, however, said Harbhajan Singh could be Indias trump card. 

Harbhajan is a good spinner, he could be your key man. Anil Kumble is improving with age. I listened to a programme on Wednesday in which he said he is still learning after all these years. That shows how keen he is, he said. 

Sobers, who captured 235 Test wickets, credited Indias final appearance in 2003 in South Africa to their then famed batting line-up. 

Last time India made it into the final, they had a strong batting line-up, he said. 

The legendary West Indian allrounder, however, feels the host country had the best chance to win the coveted trophy. 

Nothing happens before time. You look around at England and South Africa, who came back and showed great potential. You also have India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka who have been hosts. I think this is the best time for us. This is the time that we can really look forward to handling the World Cup, Sobers said. 

On a query, the 70-year-old Barbados player, who played 93 Tests, made it clear that he never played a limited-overs match. 

I would like to put that right because one-day cricket started in the late seventies, and I had retired in 1974. What they call a one-day International, was really that we had beaten England in three days and they had two days in the match, he said. 

Nobody knew that it was an international match or anything. It doesnt matter what the Wisden says or whatever anybody says, I have never played a one-day International because you cant call that, it was not told to us that we were playing an ODI. We were just making for lost time, Sobers said. 

On how he would have played in the one-dayers, Sobers said one-day cricket would not have made much difference to his style because he was always an attacking player. 

He said world champions Australias recent run of defeats had given them a chance to look into their weaknesses before the quadrennial event. 

First of all you should look at the Australian team, who were missing many of their senior players, Brett Lee, Adam Gilchrist, Ricky Ponting and Andrew Symonds. 

That is four prominent of the Australian one-day team... Their top brass. When they will come back into the side, they will make a lot of difference. The defeats give the Australians a chance to look at where the weaknesses are now, he said. 

 Now they know that if they lose certain players 

 they can see their problems. They have to be prepare in 

 case the players are not there which gives them something 

 to work on going into the World Cup.

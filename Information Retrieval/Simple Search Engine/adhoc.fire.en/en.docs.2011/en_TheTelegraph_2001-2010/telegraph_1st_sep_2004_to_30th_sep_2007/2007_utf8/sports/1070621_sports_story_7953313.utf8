 Sydney: Australias Olympic gold-medal winning swimmer Brooke Hanson may never race again after suffering an electric shock in a freak accident, it was reported on Wednesday.

 Hanson, who won gold in the 2004 Athens Games as part of Australias 100m relay team, was hospitalised on Monday when she suffered a shock at a trade show in Melbourne while demonstrating a spa manufactured by one of her sponsors.

 Hanson left hospital on Tuesday, but a Sydney newspaper reported that her career was hanging in the balance as she was suffering with muscle spasms and severe headaches following the shock. 

 Oakmont: Unable to break par against the women, Michelle Wie is taking a break from competing against the men.

 Wie decided on Tuesday to withdraw from the John Deere Classic as she tries to return from wrist injuries that have sent the 17-year-old American into a deep slump of high scores and shrinking confidence. While my rehabilitation is on schedule, I do not have all of my strength back yet, Wie said in a statement. The TPC Deere Run course is obviously very long, and I just dont have the length to play there right now. 

 Cape Town: Fifa president Sepp Blatter singled out transportation as the biggest challenge facing South Africa ahead of the 2010 soccer World Cup.

 Transport is definitely one of things ... You will have to look at, Blatter said on Tuesday, adding that a lack of transportation would hamper efforts by the expected 350,000 visitors to move freely around the country.

 Blatter has spent two days in South Africa inspecting stadium sites and receiving progress reports from the local organising committee and government. 

 Rome: Inter Milan were accused of presenting false accounts before the start of the 2005-06 season, but the title they won that season is not believed to be at risk. Inter, along with AC Milan, are being investigated for alleged false accounting between 2003 and 2005. The Milan giants are suspected of inflating the values of second-string players traded between them for capital gains tax purposes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Intikhab labels Inzy a reluctant captain

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 

Calcutta: Former Pakistan captain and coach (he wore that hat during the 1992 World Cup campaign) Intikhab Alam was still in shock when The Telegraph contacted him in Lahore on the morning after Saturdays ambush in Sabina Park. Indeed, one of Pakistan crickets tallest figures had to be persuaded to speak. 

The following are excerpts 

On Pakistan not even making the Super Eight of the ongoing World Cup 

Its very sad Having been a former player, the pain is more Id never thought we would lose to Ireland Having said that, full marks to the debutants The Irish were all charged up and had such a terrific body language They were outstanding in the field and bowled within themselves A number of extras were given away, but that didnt matter I would like to compliment the Ireland captain (Trent Johnston) for deciding to field. He read the wicket well and wasnt afraid of possibly having to chase big. As it turned out, Ireland didnt have to. Its obvious that the tie against Zimbabwe lifted their confidence. 

On the controversies both before and after Pakistans arrival in the West Indies 

Put the team under plenty of pressure Things just werent handled well. 

On the reasons for Pakistans shock ouster 

First, not selecting the right team The opening slots have been a cause of worry for so long Imran Farhat shouldnt have been dropped Salman Butt, the best opener in my view, wasnt even in the reckoning! I didnt understand the logic in bringing back Imran Nazir Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asifs absence made a big difference Another reason was (captain Inzamam-ul Haq) Inzys reluctance to bat at No.3 His experience was needed up the order, but he preferred No.5. 

On the Shoaib-Asif drama 

Its hardly a secret that both still have traces of nandrolone in their system. I dont need to say anything else. 

On whether Inzamam ought to quit as captain 

Look, it doesnt help when a captain is reluctant to lead from the front Even against Ireland, Inzy didnt bat at No.3. The Board has to look for somebody younger, somebody who will take up challenges. 

On the one best suited to succeed Inzamam 

Well, Younis (Khan) is the No.2 Sadly, I dont find anybody who is captaincy material 

On coach Bob Woolmer 

The Board has to make a change Woolmer had three years to build the team, but we got knocked out in the very first round of the World Cup This is a result-oriented world and people get a high remuneration to produce results. Woolmer has been a failure The Board has to get somebody who can deliver It could be somebody from within the country or outside Whatever his reputation, Woolmer couldnt do anything to avoid such a shameful ouster. 

On the lessons to learn 

I dont know whether its going to be learnt, but the ad-hocism in the Board must end There has to be transparency and accountability Thats the most important lesson Aise kaam nahin chalnewala 

On what made Pakistan tick in 1992 

(Emotionally) The right selection, tremendous team spirit and the fact that the players peaked at the right time I reckon that was the most united Pakistan team and Imran (Khan) was outstanding as captain Throughout, he kept telling the boys we can do it He made the team believe in what he was saying. 

On Bangladesh stunning India 

Well, it has put your team under a lot of pressure The situation demands plenty of character The Bangladesh players believed in themselves They were outstanding in the first session and, then, treated the experienced Indian bowlers with contempt If you ask me, Saturday was a good day for cricket and the so-called lesser teams have gained in confidence. 

Finally, on the team hes watching with interest 

New Zealand I find them a good package.

Brisbane: England extended their trying summer in Australia on Tuesday when they beat New Zealand by 14 runs to qualify for the tri-series finals. 

After being swept 0-5 by Australia in the Ashes and winning only two of their seven previous matches in the one-day tournament, England posted their second straight win to gain a place opposite the Australians in the best-of-three match final. 

Paul Collingwood made 106 his third ODI century and first against New Zealand as England reached 270 for seven batting first. Liam Plunkett took three for 60 as the Black caps were held to 256 for eight in reply. 

Stephen Fleming matched Collingwoods score, making 106 his sixth one-day hundred and his highest score against England, beating his previous best of 99. 

But Flemings painstaking innings ironically may have cost New Zealand the match as he was unable to lift the scoring rate when it was necessary and led his team to a defeat by small and painful degrees. 

Fleming put on 81 with Lou Vincent (31) for New Zealands first wicket and had his team well ahead of the required run rate of 5.4 runs per over through most of the first half of their innings. 

He added a further 62 with Ross Taylor (25) for the third wicket and, when he incautiously ran out Taylor in the 35th over, New Zealand were 169 for three and needed an attainable 102 to win from 95 balls. 

From that point on, New Zealands innings lost their structure and their target run-rate crept higher and higher as it struggled against accurate England bowling and desperate fielding. 

Fleming became more obviously tired and frustrated. The timing that he had lacked earlier in the series, which he had just begun to find, slowly but noticeably deserted him. 

He reached his century from 138 balls with 11 fours but took his next six runs from 11 balls without another boundary as New Zealand stumbled toward an embarrassing defeat. New Zealand eventually needed 20 runs to win from the final over but managed only six as James Frankling (22) and Shane Bond (8) were left not out. 

Andy Flintoff, relieved of the captaincy by the return from injury of Michael Vaughan, also bowled superbly, taking one for 37, while Paul Collingwood took two for 36 and Monty Panesar one for 38. 

Meanwhile, the injury to allrounder Andrew Symonds has prompted Shane Watsons recall to the Australian squad for the finals. 

Pace bowlers Stuart Clark and Shaun Tait have been released from the squad to play domestic cricket.

While Prameelavalli Bodari and Shailaja failed pre-Commonwealth Games doping tests and were banned from making the trip to Australia last year and were subsequently banned for two years, Raju and Tejinder Singh tested positive in Melbourne. Both of them were banned for life. 

IWF sources revealed that the federation strongly believes that both Shailaja and Prameelavalli could be important members of the Indian squad that will take part in the World championship next year in Thailand in an effort to grab at least four qualifying spots for the Beijing Olympics.

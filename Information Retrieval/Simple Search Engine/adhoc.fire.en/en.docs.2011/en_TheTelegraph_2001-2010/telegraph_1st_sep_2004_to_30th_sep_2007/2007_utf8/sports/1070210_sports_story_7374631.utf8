 Sania in semis

 - Indian shocks 3rd seed 

 Sania 

Pattaya: Indias Sania Mirza twice came from behind to beat third seed Mara Santangelo 6-4, 7-6 at the Pattaya Open on Friday and reach her second semi-final of the year. 

After a shaky start and an on-off service game, the 20-year-old fifth seed climbed back from 1-4 down to take the first set and pushed the Italian to a tie-break in the second to reach the final four. 

Mirza said she spent much of the match trying to work out her opponents complex game. 

Shes very difficult to play against, I dont know any player like her and I was trying to figure how she plays and her strengths and weaknesses, Mirza told reporters. 

I had some bad serves but I got them right when I needed them. 

I was twice down but I always play better when Im losing. It seems to motivate me to play better. 

Mirza will meet Gisela Dulko in Saturdays semis after the Argentine sixth seed eased past Australian Nicole Pratt 6-2, 6-3. 

Austrian Sybille Bammer took almost three hours to get past Slovakias Martina Sucha 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 to reach the second WTA semi-final of her 11-year professional career. (Reuters)

Calcutta: National record holder J.J. Shobha has opted out of heptathlon event owing to lack of preparation in the 13th Federation Cup National Senior Athletics Championship that begins at Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. 

Thus, the much-expected clash between Shobha and defending champion Sushmita Singha Roy has been ruled out. The event has already lost its sheen with the recently-wedded Soma Biswas absence. 

Now it is likely to be an easy affair for Sushmita who had put up her career best performance with 5872 points in last years edition. Sushmita will also vie for top honours in two other events: 200m hurdle and 4x400m relay. 

I am not at all prepared for the event But I shall be competing in the 100m hurdles and an long-jump event, the Andhra heptathlete, who is also a record holder in the Federation Cup, said. However Shobha will compete in 100m hurdles and long jump events. 

With the organisers still uncertain about Anju Bobby Georges participation, focus will be on Arjuna Award winner Manjit Kaur who is also the reigning 400m champion. 

The mens 100m race will be reduced to a battle between Karnatakas Vilas Neelgund (10.42s) and Indian Grand Prix winner Sammer Mon (10.66s) of Army with the absence of national record holder Anil Kumar. The mens 400m event will see national record holder K.M. Binu (45.58s) in action. 

Among others, Hari Shankar Roy (high jump) and ace hurdler Josheph Abraham are the ones to watch out for. 

Owing to the scorching May heat, the organisers have divided the event into two sessions. The first half, which includes 5000m mens and womens final, would commence early in the morning and the other finals will be held under the lights in the evening at the Salt Lake Stadium and the SAI Eastern Centre complex.

 Nadal halts Federer 

 Nadal 

Monte Carlo: Spaniard Rafael Nadal won his third Monte Carlo Masters Series in succession when he extended his record winning streak on clay to 67 matches with a 6-4, 6-4 defeat of world No. 1 Roger Federer in Sundays final. 

The double French Open champion, who has not lost on the slow surface since a defeat to Russian Igor Andreev in April 2005, became the second player to win three straight titles in the principality. Only Romanias Ilie Nastase had achieved the feat before him, from 1971 to 1973. 

The Majorcan took advantage of his opponents sloppy forehand to improve his record against Federer to 7-3. The Swiss has never beaten him on clay in five meetings. 

Nadal broke decisively on his second chance when Federer sent a forehand long in the ninth game after wasting three opportunities to take the Spaniards serve. Nadal clinched the set with a crosscourt forehand winner in 47 minutes. 

The Swiss dropped his serve in the third game of the second as Nadal managed an impressive passing shot. 

Federer saved two match points with forehand winners but bowed out on the third, giving Nadal his 19th career title when he sent a backhand long. (Reuters)

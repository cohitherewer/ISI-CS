The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The Dravid statement

 Late on Sunday evening, a couple of hours after releasing his statement to a news agency, Team India captain Rahul Dravid took time off to e-mail it to The Telegraph. 

Here goes: 

A number of journalists have been calling me to seek the players point of view on the contracts and player endorsements. So far we have got all our information from the media only. It is not correct to project this whole issue as a conflict of commercial interests of the players and the BCCI. Let me clarify that there is no conflict between the players and the BCCI. 

The interests of the players and the BCCI are inclusive and not exclusive. The BCCI has always been very caring and considerate about the players interests and I am sure that the BCCI will discuss the issue with the players at a suitable time. 

 When this opportunity arises, we shall jointly examine the areas of concern and bother and crease out the irksome issues and work out a package that can take care of the collective interests and concerns of the BCCI and the players. 

I have spoken to Ravi Shastri and a number of players and they all feel that with a healthy dialogue with the board, which there always has been, all issues can be sorted out. 

Meanwhile, I would request the media and the fans to please show some restraint. 

We have had a disappointing World Cup and it is important that we all work together as the various stake holders in the game to help improve and take our cricket forward. 

Thanks, 

 RAHUL DRAVID

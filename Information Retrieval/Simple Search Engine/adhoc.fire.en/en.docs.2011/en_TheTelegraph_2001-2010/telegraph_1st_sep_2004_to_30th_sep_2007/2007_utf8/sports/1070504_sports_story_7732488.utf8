 Shoaib says captaincy doesnt matter 

Karachi: Pakistani fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has said he wanted to get his fitness problems sorted out once and for all during the lean cricketing season to come back tougher for the home series against South Africa in September. 

Shoaib, who has not been named even in the probables for the Abu Dhabi series against Sri Lanka, said he would make full use of the gap. 

Im fit. I never said I was unfit. I had a knee injury before the World Cup, but I just need a little bit more time to get fitter and get myself sorted out properly once and for all, he was quoted as saying by a Pakistan daily. 

Shoaib, who has played a few before the dope controversy during the Champions Trophy last year, said his prolonged absence would give opportunity to trial fast bowlers. This is the right time to invest some time in myself and let the youngsters go out there and show something that they can do. Itll be nice to see some youngsters come through, do well for the country. Its a healthy sign, he said. 

Shoaib said he was not keen to become the captain but just wanted to focus on serving the team and support captain. 

Captaincy and all these things do not matter to me. You have probably seen it now that a lot of other people are interested in being captain. I never said I wanted to be because right now I want to focus on just serving the team and my country... 

Im not one of those guys who creates problems. I never have and I never will. (PTI)

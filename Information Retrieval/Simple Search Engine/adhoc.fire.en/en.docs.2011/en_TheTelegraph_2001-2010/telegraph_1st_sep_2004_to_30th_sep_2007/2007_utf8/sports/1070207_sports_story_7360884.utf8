 Deep banned for two one-dayers

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bengal captain Deep Dasgupta has been banned from the first two matches of the National one-dayers (East Zone) for the teams slow over-rate during the Ranji Trophy final against Mumbai. 

The wicketkeeper-batsman, thus, will miss matches against Assam (February 13) and Tripura (February 15) to be held in Cuttack. The one-dayers kick off with the Jharkhand-Tripura match on Sunday. 

According to the code of conduct, this was Dasguptas level III offence after he was already charged with level II for slow over-rate during the semi-final against Karnataka. 

According to information reaching here, the Bengal captain will have to forego 100 per cent match fees with team penalised for 50 per cent. 

Dasgupta was called for hearing by Match Referee B. Raghunath on Tuesday, day after Bengals 132-run loss to Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy final.

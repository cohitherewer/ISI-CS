 BCCI asks Bindra to speak to Kapil

 Kapil Dev 

Chandigarh: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has asked the Punjab Cricket Association chief, I.S. Bindra, to speak to former captain Kapil Dev on the issue of his joining Indian Cricket League (ICL). 

The Board has authorised Bindra to talk to Kapil and know his stance, BCCI joint secretary M.P. Pandove said. 

The Board has threatened to sack Indias lone World Cup-winning captain as chairman of National Cricket Academy (NCA) following his association with the ICL. 

Interestingly, Pandove said that the iconic allrounder had about a month left in his contract with the BCCI as NCA chairman. 

That may explain why the Board hasnt really moved yet to take any action against Kapil who remains defiant. 

In fact, a day after the BCCI threatened to take appropriate steps against him, Kapil said he would continue with the ICL. 

The former captain said there was nothing wrong in occupying the post of NCA chairman and being a part of the ICL at the same time. 

I am working for the betterment of the game. For me, cricket is the same everywhere. If somebody asks for my services, how can I stop him? the legendary allrounder said after donating blood at a function here on Wednesday. 

However, if I am stopped from teaching cricket, they (the BCCI) would be doing an unethical thing, he said. 

I have got a job (with the ICL) and the debate is whether I should do it. If I get an offer from a private company, why should the Board stop me? If ICL requires me to train four players from the Indian team, will I say no? 

On the Boards threat of sacking him, Kapil said: If they want to remove me they are free to do so. 

I will do my job. I have no intention to fight (with the BCCI) because my conscience is clear I dont need to seek permission from anyone. 

I love my country and the game. I played it with a lot of passion. When I work (to improve cricket), I work with passion too, he said. 

Kapil said the Board has enough funds to set up world-class academies in India instead of sending youngsters to countries such as Australia for training. 

Kapil felt the Sector-16 cricket stadium in Chandigarh, which has been awarded a one-day match after 14 years, should get more ties in future. 

Matches should be played here more often. Chandigarh has been my city and I believe whatever I have achieved was because of the facilities here during my playing days. So when you hear the city gets a match after 14 years, I feel ashamed, he said. 

The Chandigarh government, meanwhile, has cold shouldered ICL chairman Kapils approaches, telling him that it would not do anything to jeopardise its relationship with the BCCI. 

Kapil, who visited the venue this morning, was told by the top government officials during a meeting on Wednesday that the administration would continue to correspond with the BCCI on cricketing matters now and in future too. 

The immediate matter at stake for the ICL seems to be coaxing the administration to let the Sector 16 stadium as venue for its matches. (AGENCIES)

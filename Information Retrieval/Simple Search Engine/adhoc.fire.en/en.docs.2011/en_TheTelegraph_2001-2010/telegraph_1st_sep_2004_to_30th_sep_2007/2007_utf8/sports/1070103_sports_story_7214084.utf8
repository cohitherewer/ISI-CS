The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No fresh referees for NFL

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The hue and cry made by some of the clubs over quality of supervision in the recently concluded Federation Cup in Calcutta, is unlikely to have any effect on the authorities as the AIFF. The governing body of India football is not going to introduce fresh faces in the forthcoming National Football League (NFL). 

Speaking to The Telegraph on Tuesday, a senior federation official, who didnt wish to be named, admitted that performance of some of the referees in the Federation Cup raised eyebrows even among the federation officials, but said the AIFF would have no option but to pursue with the same set in the NFL. 

While we totally disagree with the allegations of some of the clubs that supervision was biased, we do admit a few top names in the profession didnt exactly do any justice to their reputation, said the official.

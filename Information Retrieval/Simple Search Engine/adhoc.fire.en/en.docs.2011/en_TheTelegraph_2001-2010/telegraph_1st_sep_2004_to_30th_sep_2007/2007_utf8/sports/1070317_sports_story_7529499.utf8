 Plucky Irish conjure up a magical tie

Simon Briggs in Kingston

Irelands fun-loving fans brought their unique brand of sporting exuberance to Sabina Park on Thursday, led by a couple of crazies in full leprechaun costume. And how their team responded! Ireland pulled off one of the great World Cup comebacks to claim a memorable tie (as reported in Fridays CM edition) on their tournament debut. 

The game came down to the final ball, from the undistinguished off-spinner Andrew White. Zimbabwe had one wicket in hand and needed one run to win, but Stuart Matsikenyeris swish met only air. The wicketkeeper broke the stumps and then returned the ball to the bowlers end. In all the pandemonium, Edward Rainsford had wandered out of his ground, and was run out by yards. 

It was a pulsating finish, capped by a lap of honour by the Irish team. Their part-time players have made many sacrifices just to be here, yet for most of the game it looked as if their World Cup debut was going to be a damp squib. Only in the final half-hour did they pull the game around, pegging Zimbabwe back from 203 for five to 221 all out to claim the third tie in the tournaments history. 

How did this happen? Well, simply by bowling straight and piling the pressure back on to the batsmen, who must have thought they had the game won. At one point, the equation was 19 runs to win from 38 balls, with five wickets in hand. And it was a stroke of Irish luck that started the collapse, Matsikenyeris straight drive rebounding from Kyle McCallans hand to run Brendan Taylor out as he backed up. 

Now the procession started. Gary Brent was lbw and Prosper Utseya, the captain, hung his head after slapping a straightforward catch to Eoin Morgan at cover. Two run-outs completed the most extraordinary escape you could wish to see. 

It could have been even better for Ireland if Trent Johnston, the captain, had held on to a difficult left-handed chance off the penultimate ball. That would have won the match for Ireland, but it would also have been unfair on Zimbabwe, who made the running for most of the game. Matsikenyeri, in particular, was superb in his innings of 73 not out. 

Irelands total relied almost entirely on a fine unbeaten hundred by Jeremy Bray. There is plenty of talent in the Irish top-four, who are all professionals in one way or another. But there also seemed to be a touch of arrogance in some of the shot-making. On a grassy pitch that played tricks early on, Ireland needed a strong platform; instead they were 64 for four in the 15th over. 

Bray survived a close lbw shout on 18 and settled to bat through the innings, finishing unbeaten on 115 from 137 balls. A burly, uncomplicated left-hander, he is fond of slapping the ball through the off side with a woodcutters economy of movement. And like Ricky Ponting, he is essentially Australian, only moving to Ireland when in his early twenties. 

For Zimbabwe, as for Ireland, partnerships were in short supply. Their total was dominated by two talented young batsmen, Vusi Sibanda and Matsikenyeri. 

Sibanda dominated the early stages of the innings; at one point, he had added 37 runs with Chamu Chibhabha, the No. 3, who had still to get off the mark. There is a wristy, feline swagger to his strokeplay reminiscent of Stuart Law. 

When Sibanda fell in bizarre style for 67, playing back so far that he trod on his stumps, Ireland were suddenly in the game. Then came Matsikenyeris superb innings. Brays failure to catch him off a hard, flat chance at long-on, with 37 runs still to get, seemed to be the point of no return. But we had reckoned without Irish pluck.

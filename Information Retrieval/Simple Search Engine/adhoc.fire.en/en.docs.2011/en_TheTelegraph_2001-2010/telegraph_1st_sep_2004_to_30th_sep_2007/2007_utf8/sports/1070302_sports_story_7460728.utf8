 Symonds may be fit before SA match

Melbourne: Injured allrounder Andrew Symonds, a key player for Australias World Cup campaign, is hopeful of returning to the side before the pool smatch against South Africa. 

Symonds is believed to be well ahead of his scheduled rehabilitation programme and could be available before the March 24 match against the Proteas. 

I reckon hopefully I will take part in that match. If not South Africa, then a bit before that. But we just have to wait and see how it progresses, Symonds was quoted as saying by a newspaper here. 

Meanwhile, Matthew Hayden admitted he could only hope his broken big toe improved sufficiently to allow him to play in Australias first Cup match, against Scotland on March 14. 

If you were a punter off the street itd be 6 to 8-week injury. We will fast-track that and hopefully make it two or three weeks, said Hayden. (PTI)

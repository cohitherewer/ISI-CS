 Hamilton has to rely on game theory

EDWARD GORMAN

 Lewis Hamilton 

The Lewis Hamilton Express stops in the Midwest this week, at one of the most famous tracks in racing, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and guess what? The young man who is creating a whirlwind in Formula One cannot wait to give it a go for the first time. 

Just as he did preparing for the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, where Hamilton won his first Grand Prix last weekend, despite never having driven there before, Britains dream racer will have spent many hours studying Indy. 

This time he has not used McLaren Mercedes 20 million simulator, concentrating instead on video and technical data and his experience of the track on PlayStation. 

Leaving New York after a brief stopover before heading west, Hamilton was not predicting another win. However, after six podium finishes in a row, which have given him a lead in the World Championship of eight points over Fernando Alonso, his McLaren teammate, his confidence is sky high. 

The Motor Speedway is another tough circuit on the cars, I hope we are as competitive (as in Canada), but until we get out on the circuit on Friday we cant really predict how it is going to go, he said. I am really excited to be racing at Indianapolis. It is such a legendary venue and I am looking forward to experiencing the atmosphere for the first time. 

The track has the unique characteristic of the banking. From what I hear it doesnt have a massive impact on the cars, but it will be pretty cool. To be going into race seven of the championship in the position I am in is amazing. However, it is early days. This will be my seventh race and I am still learning. 

 For Alonso, the prospect of Indy 

 will not be so inviting. The Spaniard, who has complained 

 this week that he has not been happy since joining McLaren, 

 a team he claims are focused more on Hamilton than him, 

 has a woeful record at the Brickyard and he 

 will be under pressure to perform well.

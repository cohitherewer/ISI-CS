The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Chawla likely for Agarkar 

Johannesburg: After a breathtaking start to their ICC World Twenty20 campaign, India will look to continue the momentum when they take on New Zealand in their Super Eight match at the Wanderers on Sunday. 

India kept themselves afloat in the tournament with a dramatic win against Pakistan after their opening match versus Scotland was washed out due to rains. 

Indications are that India may replace Ajit Agarkar with Piyush Chawla, given New Zealands weakness against spin. 

The thrilling win against Pakistan may have served as a great morale booster for India, who have little experience in the shortest version of the game, and Mahendra Singh Dhonis men have their task cut out against the Black Caps.

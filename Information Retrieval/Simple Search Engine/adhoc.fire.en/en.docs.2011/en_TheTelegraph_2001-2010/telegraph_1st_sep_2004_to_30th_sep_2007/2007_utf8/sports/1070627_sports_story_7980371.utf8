 Chris Gayle refuses to apologise

Bridgetown: The rift between the West Indies captain Chris Gayle and their board widened on Tuesday after the player refused to apologise for comments made during their tour of England. 

The left-handed opener criticised the boards handling of matters during the trip. 

Gayle last week blasted the WICB for the way his elevation to captaincy was handled and the late arrival of three players for the one-day series. 

In a June 21 diary for a website, Gayle had said: First and foremost, I am very disappointed with the West Indies Cricket Board for not having the guys here in England already and ready to play. 

On Monday, the 27-year-old was summoned to a meeting with the WICB president Ken Gordon and manager Findlay, where he was asked to issue a public apology. The WICB said: He was allowed some time to consider the request. He subsequently advised the president and team manager that he was not prepared to apologise. 

The WICB said it hoped Gayle would understand the seriousness of his actions and avoid any further statements or behaviour that will force the WICB to take drastic and immediate action against him. (Agencies)

 Dola wins gold 

 Dola Banerjee

New Delhi: Dola Banerjee overcame a stiff challenge from Chinas Juan Juan Zhang to claim the womens recurve individual gold medal at the archery World Cup in Dover on Sunday. 

The Arjuna awardee pipped Zhang 111-110 in the final. 

Dola, who won the recurve team bronze on Saturday, had got past Malgorzata Cwienczek of Poland 108-101 in the semi-final without much trouble. 

On Saturday, Dola with teammates Chekrovolu Swuro and L. Bombayla Devi, had registered a comfortable 208-198 victory over Poland to win the team bronze. 

Hailing the performance of Dola and the womens recurve team, senior coach Sanjeeva Singh said: Its a morale-boosting effort for Dola and Co. However, we should remember that many of the top archers are not here. But its definitely an achievement to cherish and it tells us that we can hope to win medals in the Olympics. 

Singh said the gold medal would motivate Dola, who had a forgettable performance in the World Championships in Germany earlier this year. 

She did not do well in the world championships. This should put her back on the winning track, he said. 

The Tata Archery Academy coach said it was disappointing that the mens team had failed to notch up good results in Dover. 

He said the Asian Championships next month would pose a tough challenge for the Indian archers before the Olympics.

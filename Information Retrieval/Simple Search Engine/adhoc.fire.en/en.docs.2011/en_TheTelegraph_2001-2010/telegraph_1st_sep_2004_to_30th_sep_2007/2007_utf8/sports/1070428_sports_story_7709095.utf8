 Pawar to look into sponsors role 

New Delhi: The BCCI president, Sharad Pawar, on Friday underscored the sorry state of affairs in Indian cricket by disclosing that young players feel sponsors were influencing team selection. He said the BCCI had received an unofficial complaint that a players contract has a clause which provides for more incentives for more time spent at the crease. 

It is an unofficial complaint and if found to be correct, the system needs to be strengthened. So I have asked the players to submit their copies of the old contract, Pawar told a news channel. 

There is a feeling like this among the younger players. A young player said this to me but for the sake of his future I will not talk much about this. I have asked some trusted people to look into this. There will not be an official investigation but we are looking into this. 

Pawar denied that the board had given any specific instruction to the selection committee to rest Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly from the ODI team. 

Its a selection committee decision. I dont interfere in the process of selection. Any such reports that the board issued instructions for resting Sourav-Sachin are baseless and wrong, he said.

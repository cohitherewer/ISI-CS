Bangalore: The Board of Control for Cricket in Indias (BCCI) technical committee on Monday decided to retain the two-division format in the Ranji Trophy for the 2007-08 season with some changes in the points system at the league stage. 

From now on, the Duleep Trophy inter-zonal tournament would be held after the Ranji final and not at the beginning of the season, as is the case at present. 

These were the major recommendations made by the committee at a meeting here chaired by former captain Sunil Gavaskar. The recommendations, however, would have to be ratified by the BCCIs working committee when it meets in Delhi on June 12, secretary Niranjan Shah said. 

There were indications that the technical committee may change the format temporarily for a season to comply with the working committees diktat to reduce the number of teams in the Elite Division to 10 from the current 15 from 2008-09. 

After long deliberation it was decided that the same format for the Ranji Trophy will be retained. There would be 15 teams in the Elite Division and 12 teams in the Plate Division. We will try and find out an equitable way to reduce the Elite Division teams to 10 during the course of the season, joint secretary Mohinder Pandove said. 

Shah said that the meeting discussed mainly the suggestions that were put forward at the Ranji captains and coaches conclave held in April in Mumbai. 

It has been decided to change the Ranji points system. For the next season, if a team gains first innings lead in a drawn tie it would get three points, while the other team will get one. Outright victories would fetch five points plus a bonus point if its done by an innings or with 10 wickets to spare, Shah said.

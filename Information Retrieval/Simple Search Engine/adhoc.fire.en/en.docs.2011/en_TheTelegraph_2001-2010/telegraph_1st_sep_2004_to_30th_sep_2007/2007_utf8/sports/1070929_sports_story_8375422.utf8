I often get caught in the square leg region when attempting the flick. Why does this happen?

 (Rohit Basu, 17, Durgapur)

 You are playing with the bat way ahead of the body. Ensure that you are right on top of the ball when working it on the on side.

 I am a right-arm mediumpacer. Despite my best efforts I am unable to swing the ball. I have also tried to follow your suggestions. Please help.

 (Debarshi Mukherjee, 15, Calcutta-40)

 Work on your grip and action at the time of delivery with your coach. There is no short cut to success.

 I am a right-arm mediumpacer. How does one keep the seam upright when bowling?

 (Dipan Mukherjee, 15, Calcutta-26)

 It demands a good wrist action.

 When attempting the defensive stroke off the backfoot against shortpitched deliveries I often get caught in the close-in field. Please help

 (Prantik Chaudhri, 21, Calcuta-41)

 Use the depth of the crease when going back and across and watch your balance.

 I have been doing a lot of aerobics and stretching exercises during the off season. Should I follow any other fitness regime?

 (Tapas Guha, 22, Calcutta)

 Thats good. Running will build endurance as well.

 I am an allrounder. I need to do some weight training to strengthen the muscles in my upper body. Should it be done during the off season?

 (Vikas Jaiswal, 22, Howrah)

 Yes. And every now and then during the season to keep the muscles toned.

 I am an offspinner and would like to know the ideal length for bowling an off break?

 (Sanjoy Samanta, 18, Calcutta)

 You should be drawing the batsman forward without quite allowing him to drive.

 I am a wicketkeeper and have problems in anticipating the ball on the leg side against spinners. Please help.

 (Soham Dixit, 22, Jamshedpur)

 Stay low and work on your footwork sideways.

 I am a righthanded batsman. I have a high backlift and that leads to problems when tackling shortpitched deliveries. Please help.

 (Sunil Rudra, 18, Calcutta-12)

 You are the best judge in adjusting so that you have more time. Also you may need to be quicker with your footwork.

 I am a righthanded batsman. Is it wise to take guard outside the leg stump when facing leg spinners?

 (Partha Pratim Pal, 21, Calcutta)

 All depends where the bowler is bowling, how much the ball is turning and where you are looking to actually hit it.

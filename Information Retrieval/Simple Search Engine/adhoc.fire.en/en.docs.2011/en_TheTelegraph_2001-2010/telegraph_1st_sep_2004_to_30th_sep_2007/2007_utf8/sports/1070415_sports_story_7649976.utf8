 Sir Alex tirade

TIM RICH

Having cemented Manchester Uniteds most glittering jewel into the centre of the clubs crown, Sir Alex Ferguson rounded on Real Madrid over their attempts to unsettle Cristiano Ronaldo. 

United on Friday announced that the 22-year-old they consider to be the best footballer in the world had agreed a new contract that would tie him to Old Trafford until 2012. It is believed that Ronaldo has settled on a deal of 120,000 per week after initially demanding 140,000. 

As late as last Wednesday, Madrid officials were talking to Ronaldos agent, Jorge Mendes, who had been conducting parallel negotiations with Manchester United chief executive David Gill. 

I had no doubts he would sign, but everyone outside of Old Trafford did, Ferguson remarked.

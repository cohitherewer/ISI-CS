 Brazils Cup binge comes to the fore

Sao Paulo: Brazil players had all night drinking sessions at the 2006 World Cup finals and Ronaldo was vastly overweight, Brazilian federation (CBF) president Ricardo Teixeira was quoted as saying in a Brazilian daily on Wednesday. 

The paper reported extracts from a conversation in Zurich between Teixeira and a representative of the company which is promoting Brazils bid to host the 2014 World Cup finals for which they are the sole candidates. 

Brazil were favourites to win the 2006 edition but lost 0-1 to France in the quarter final. Teixeira criticised AC Milan striker Ronaldo, who weighed 98kg at the start of the competition. 

How can an athlete weigh 98kg during a major finals, Texeira said. I am not a sportsman and I dont weigh as much as that. 

Certain (unnamed) players returned to their hotel drunk between 4:00am and 6:00am. How could no one have seen that. 

The head of the Brazilian delegation in Germany last year, Marco Paulo del Nero, replied, in comments published by the daily, that he had not seen such scenes. 

I didnt see anything and, if such incidents happened, the technical staff did a very good job of covering them up. (AFP)

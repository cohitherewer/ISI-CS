 Nair loses election

Thiruvananthapuram: An old Jagmohan Dalmiya ally and a former BCCI secretary S. K. Nair failed to get elected to the Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) from his home district Thiruvananthapuram. 

Nair could not muster enough votes to qualify for his continuance in the KCA as a member from his district in the elections held Friday. 

A long-time member of the District Cricket Association, Nair was pushed to the third position in the elections held to the 60-member state body. 

Dr Anil Kumar and Rajith Rajendran were elected as the two KCA members from the district. P. G. Raghunath was elected as district president and Vinod Kumar secretary. 

Nair has handed over charge to its vice-president C. Haridas. (PTI)

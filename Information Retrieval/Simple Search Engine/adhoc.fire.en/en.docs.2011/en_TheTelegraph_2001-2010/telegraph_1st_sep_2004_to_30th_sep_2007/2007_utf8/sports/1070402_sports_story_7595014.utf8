The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Barreto set to play 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan, bolstered by a fully recovered Jose Ramirez Barreto, will look to go for the kill when they take on JCT in their Round XI match on Monday. 

He (Barreto) is feeling better and eager to start. So it will be perfect for him to get prepared for the crucial match against Mahindra United in the next round (on Thursday), coach Chima Okerie said. 

Barreto hasnt played since pulling a hamstring against East Bengal on February 27. 

Meanwhile, Sporting Clube de Goa and Air India played out a 1-1 draw in Margao.

Melbourne: Fernando Gonzalez played two sets of near flawless tennis then hung on to defeat Lleyton Hewitt 6-2, 6-2, 5-7, 6-4 in the third round of the Australian Open on Saturday as rain limited play to the two show courts, where the roofs were closed. 

The 26-year-old Chilean, who finished in the top 10 last year despite not winning an ATP title, made just one unforced error in each of the first two sets and three double faults for the match to beat the former Wimbledon and US Open champion. 

Nineteenth seed Hewitt has struggled to recover from injury and off-court distractions since appearing in the final of his home Grand Slam in 2005, and fought through a five set match and a four setter to reach the third round. 

Gonzalez brought an end to the Aussie challenge in singles after Alicia Molik went down in three sets to eighth seed Patty Schnyder of Switzerland 3-6, 6-2, 6-0 earlier in the day. 

Sixth seed Martina Hingis also reached the fourth round with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Japans Aiko Nakamura. 

Maria Sharapova, Kim Clijsters, Rafael Nadal and Nikolay Davydenko also raced to quick victories. 

Clijsters beat Alona Bondarenko 6-2, 6-2 in exactly an hour, while Sharapova swept past No. 30 Garbin 6-3, 6-1. Her next match is against fellow-Russian Vera Zvonareva, seeded 22nd, who upset No. 13 Ana Ivanovic 6-1, 6-2. 

Fifth seed James Blake had a 7-6 (8-6), 7-5, 6-2 win over fellow-American Robby Ginepri, saving a total of five set points in the first two sets and breaking serve six times in the match. He will meet 10th-seeded Fernando Gonzalez of Chile, who ousted 10th seed Lleyton Hewitt, the last Australian left in the tournament, 6-2, 6-2, 5-7, 6-4. 

In the last game, Hewitt saved double match point with a pair of great winners. Gonzalez finally finished it off with a clean forehand winner his 25th. 

Nadal next faces 15th-seeded Andy Murray of Britain, who ousted Argentinas Juan Ignacio Chela 6-3, 6-2, 6-4. 

Eighth-seeded David Nalbandian struggled again, rallying for the second time from two sets down and triple match point to oust Frances Sebastien Grosjean 5-7, 4-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4, 6-1. Davydenko needed only two hours to beat Fabrice Santoro 7-6 (7-1), 6-2, 6-2. (AGENCIES)

 Bhupathi in last 8; Sania campaign over

Melbourne: It was a disappointing day for Sania Mirza which saw her signing off from the years first Grand Slam with defeats in the womens doubles and mixed doubles competitions. 

The pin-up girl of Indian tennis and Spaniard Anabel Medina Garriques gave a tough fight to Daniela Hantuchova and Ai Sugiyama, before bowing out 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (7-5), 2-6. 

The Indians fate at this years Australian Open was sealed later when Sania and Frenchman Fabrice Santoro went down to the second seeds Mark Knowles of Bahamas and Australian Rennae Stubbs 6-7 (0-7), 6-1, 7-10 in 79 minutes. 

Mahesh Bhupathi, however, had a mixed day with his success in mens doubles soured by elimination in the mixed doubles event. Bhupathi and his Czech partner Radek Stepanek upset the seventh-seeded Israeli pair of Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 6-3 in five minutes short of two hours to move into the quarter finals. 

They will meet No. 2 seeds, Swedens Jonas Bjorkman and Max Mirnyi of Belarus in the last eight. 

However, the Bangalore-based player was not so fortunate in his partnership with Hantuchova as they were defeated by the Serbian team of Nenad Zimonjic and Jelena Jankovic 6-4, 6-7 (4-7), 8-10 in just over two hours. 

Indias Rupesh Roy was eliminated in the first round of boys singles losing 6-2, 3-6, 3-6 to Frances Kevin Botti. 

But Rupesh had better luck in doubles as his pairing with Australian Stephen Donald, seeded eighth, ran out easy winners against Bulgarias Valentin Dimov and Fumiaki Kita of Japan, the scoreline reading 6-2, 6-1. (PTI)

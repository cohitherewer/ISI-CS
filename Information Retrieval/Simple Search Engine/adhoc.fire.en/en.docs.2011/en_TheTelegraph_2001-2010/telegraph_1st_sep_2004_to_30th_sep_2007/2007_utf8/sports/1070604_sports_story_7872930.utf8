 Pathology report misled us: Shields

London: Mark Shields, deputy commissioner of the Jamaican police who led the investigation into Bob Woolmers death, has blamed the Kingston pathologists report which led to the death being treated as a murder. 

We have to go with what the pathologist gives, and if Id ignored the report and it had turned out to be true, I would have been lambasted for not treating it seriously, Shields said in an English daily. 

Usually we investigate a murder and look for suspects. But, on this occasion, because of the lack of evidence to support the pathologist, weve gone out to prove its not a murder. 

The police had launched a murder investigation when pathologist Dr Ere Seshaiah had reported that Woolmer had died due to asphyxiation as a result of manual strangulation, after earlier citing the cause of death as inconclusive. 

British pathologist Dr Nat Carey felt that the bruising in Woolmers neck was more likely caused during the post-mortem. (PTI)

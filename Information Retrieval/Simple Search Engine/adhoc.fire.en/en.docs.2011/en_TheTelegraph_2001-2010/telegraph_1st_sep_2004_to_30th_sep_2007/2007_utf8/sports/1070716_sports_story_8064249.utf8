 Alford recovering 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Jockey Christopher Alford, who had a nasty fall in Bangalore on Saturday, is out of danger according to a source close to the city-based rider. Alford is learnt to have escaped with a broken collar-bone injury which may keep him out of action for about four weeks. Alford clipped the heels of Artic Blast, the winner of the D.M.Shivaswamy Memorial Cup, division II. Artic Blast was subsequently disqualified. Aadesh Kumar, the jockey of another horse Winsons who also came a cropper in the race, escaped unhurt.

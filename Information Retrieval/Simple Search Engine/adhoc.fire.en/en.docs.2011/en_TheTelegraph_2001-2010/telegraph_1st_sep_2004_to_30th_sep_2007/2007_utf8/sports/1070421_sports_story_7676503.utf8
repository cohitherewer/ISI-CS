 SA can stop Aussie juggernaut, says Bacher

Durban: Former South African Cricket CEO, Dr Ali Bacher, believes that Graeme Smiths team has the ammunition to halt Australias rampaging march towards winning their hattrick world cup title. 

If they play as they did against England, I cant see any team stopping them, not even Australia, Bacher said. 

That is the way to approach a game. You should not give your opponents any chance, Bacher told a daily. 

Bacher believes that Australia were bound to slip-up at any point in the tournament and this was possible in the semi-final. 

The South Africans were clinical, and that is what will be needed in the semi-final against Australia, the former South African captain said.

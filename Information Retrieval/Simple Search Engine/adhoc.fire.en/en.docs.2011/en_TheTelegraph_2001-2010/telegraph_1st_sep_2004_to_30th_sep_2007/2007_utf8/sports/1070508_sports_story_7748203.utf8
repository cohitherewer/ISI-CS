 Soma, Pinki not to participate

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bengal will be without Pinki Pramanik and Soma Biswas in the Eveready 13th Federation Cup. 

While the middle-distance runner Pinki has twisted her ankle recently, heptathlete Soma is taking a break after getting married on Sunday. 

There is also uncertainty over Anju Bobby Georges participation. According to organisers West Bengal Athletic Association, the ace long jumper is yet to confirm her participation. 

Bengal, defending champions in womens category, will field a 35-member contingent (seven men and 28 women) in the four-day meet beginning at Salt Lake Stadium and SAI Eastern Centre (throwing events) from Thursday. 

The meet, however, assumes importance in that top performers will be picked to represent India in the Asian championship, to be held in Lebanon in July. 

Other international athletes like Hari Shankar Roy (national record holder in high jump), Piyush Kumar (Federation Cup record holder in 100m), Seema Antil (national record holder in discuss throw) and Sunitha Rani (Federation Cup and national record holder in 5000m) will be in the fray.

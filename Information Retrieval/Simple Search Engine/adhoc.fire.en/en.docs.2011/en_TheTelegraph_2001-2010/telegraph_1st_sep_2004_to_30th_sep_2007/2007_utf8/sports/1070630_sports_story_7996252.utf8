 Sushmita wins, Anju effort not enough

Pune: Long jump ace Anju Bobby George put up a much improved display on Friday but still fell short of the qualifying mark for the forthcoming Osaka World Championship. 

The 30-year-old Kerala-born athlete cleared 6.42m to win the national combined events and jump competition hands down here but the feat was 18cm short of the qualifying mark of 6.60m set by the world athletics federation for the August 25-September 2 IAAF championship. 

Bengals Sushmita Singha Roy won the heptathlon title with 5137 points followed by the Keralite Sinimol Paulose (4851) and Tamil Nadus D. Karpuramala (4088), respectively.

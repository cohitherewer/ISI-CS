 Its nice to know somebody is benefiting in some manner

 - Sachin happy his gloves raised Rs 1.11 lakh through auction in the city

Calcutta: Crickets senior-most pro, Sachin Tendulkar, has appreciated the raising of Rs 1.11 lakh through an auction of the gloves hed worn during his superb unbeaten 194 in the only Team India innings at Multan three years ago. 

The gloves were auctioned during a Calcutta Sports Journalists Club function on Thursday evening, with big screen stalwart Mithun Chakraborty wearing the auctioneers hat and starting the bidding with a personal pitch of Rs 50,000. 

The amount has been handed over to the family of ailing Pradip Nag, a former Fifa badge-holding referee, teacher and part-time journalist. 

Nag was hospitalised for well over a month. Hes back home, yes, but the rehab is no less expensive. 

Im happy that the auction raised the sum it did Im not aware of the expenses involved If the family needs more, then I would have been happier had more been raised, Sachin told The Telegraph the morning-after. 

Speaking from his Mumbai residence, he added: Of course, its nice to know that somebody is benefiting in some manner. Whenever possible, Ive tried to help those engaged in a good cause Ill gladly donate something for somebody needy in some other city as well. 

Not unusually, Sachin has been modest. 

Behind the scenes, after all, he has actually been doing quite a bit, particularly helping children of the less privileged and young ones with terminal illness. 

Thats why Sachin is a sports icon, not just an outstanding cricketer.

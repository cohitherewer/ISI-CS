 Mahindra set up Sporting date

Ludhiana: Mumbai giants Mahindra United beat a lacklustre HASC 1-0 on Wednesday to set up a quarter-final clash with Sporting Clube de Goa in the Federation Cup here. 

Steven Dias, one of the heroes of Indias Nehru Cup victory, scored the winner in the 10th minute. 

Earlier, Sporting Clube de Goa did just enough to ward off the challenge from Army XI with the help of a solitary goal from Kenyan Boniface Ambani in the sixth minute. 

The lone goal for the 2005 champions was a delightful example of teamwork. 

Mohammed Rafi passed to Minga Edson Congo, who redirected the ball to D.S. Djiaja Pierre, a recruit from Ivory Coast. 

He, in turn, found Dias at the right edge of the box. 

The midfielder created space for himself and let go a powerful shot in the bottom left corner of the goal past veteran custodian Gumpe Rime. 

Dias was unlucky not to score a second when his powerful shot just after restart came off the crossbar. 

However, Sporting started brightly and were on the attack from the start. 

But after the initial flourish, which fetched them the goal, they lost the sting, allowing Army XI to control the proceedings.

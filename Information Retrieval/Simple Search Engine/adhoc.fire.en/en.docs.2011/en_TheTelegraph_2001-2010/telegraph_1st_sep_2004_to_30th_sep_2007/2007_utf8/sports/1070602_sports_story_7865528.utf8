 BCCI support for Ray Mali

 - APPOINTMENT OF THE ICCs ACTING HEAD 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Darjeeling: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has proposed that South Africas Ray Mali be appointed the acting president of the International Cricket Council (ICC). 

The acting president enjoys the same powers as the president. 

The ICC is without its top functionary following Percy Sonns death. Thanks to a stalemate earlier this year, theres no vice-president either. 

Sonn was nominated by Cricket South Africa (CSA) to succeed Ehsan Mani and its only proper that another South African fills in till a successor is elected... Weve proposed Mali, former BCCI president Inderjit Singh Bindra told The Telegraph. 

Bindra, who is the alternate for president Sharad Pawar on the ICCs executive board, added: New Zealands position is the same... In fact, the New Zealand Cricket chairman (Sir John Anderson) has conveyed that to the ICC... 

Its rare for India and New Zealand to be on the same wavelength within the ICC. But, then, thats another story. 

Theres no guarantee, however, that the CSA will be asked to nominate the acting president. As an ICC official (who didnt wish to be identified) explained on Friday evening: Once somebody sits in the presidents chair, he ceases to represent his country... From then on, hes not seen as having a particular nationality. 

Mali, a businessman, heads the CSA. 

Right now, its not even clear who is going to chair the executive board meetings during the ICCs Annual Conference Week June 24-29. 

Senior-most director Sir John could be given that responsibility. Equally, the executive board may invite Mani to take the chair he occupied for three years. 

Sonn was elected for a two-year term in 2006 and got a one-year extension after the stalemate over the vice-presidency. 

Theres also uncertainty over the tenure of whoever becomes the acting president. As has been reported, the all-powerful executive board will take that decision. 

Where the BCCIs Pawar is concerned, hes fine-tuning strategy support for Mali is surely part of it for becoming the ICCs full-time president. 

Englands David Morgan nurses the same ambition, though.

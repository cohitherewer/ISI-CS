 Barreto: Win a priority today

A STAFF REPOPTER

Calcutta: City giants Mohun Bagan will look to improve their position when they take on Sporting Clube de Goa in a Round 17 encounter of the 11th National Football League at the Salt Lake Stadium here on Monday. 

Mohun Bagan are occupying the seventh spot in the table with 21 points from 16 matches. 

Skipper Jose Ramirez Barreto along with his boys had a one-and-half hour practice session on Sunday morning. We are solely looking to improve our position in the league table. So winning the match would be our top priority, Barreto said. 

With Mehtab Hossain ruled out due to double booking, the green-and-maroon brigade will again have to depend on their Bhaichung Bhutia-Barreto magic. 

Meanwhile, Sporting Club de Goa, who have 19 points from 16 outings, also indicated of not letting things that easy for the Calcutta club. Coach Clifford Chukwuma too are looking for a win only to improve their standing at the league.

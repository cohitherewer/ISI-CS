 Warnes plans

London: Shane Warne is not thinking about coaching at the moment. The record-breaking Test match bowler, who was tipped to act in a coaching role to old enemy England, said he is only concentrating on captaining Hampshire ahead of the new English county championship season. 

Im not even thinking about coaching at the moment. I have enough on my plate leading Hampshire, Warne said adding that he was always keen to pass on advice to young spinners. 

Im always happy to talk to anyone. Ive never been one not to help other players if they feel I can help them. 

I talk to other spinners all the time, and I had a long chat with Monty Panesar last summer and I hope that helped him, Warne said.

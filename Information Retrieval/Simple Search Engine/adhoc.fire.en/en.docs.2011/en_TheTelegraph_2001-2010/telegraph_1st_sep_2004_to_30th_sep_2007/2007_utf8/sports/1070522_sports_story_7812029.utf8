 Pakistan clinch ODI series

Abu Dhabi: Salman Butt and Yasir Hameed hit half-centuries, while Shahid Afridi took three wickets to set up Pakistans 98-run win over Sri Lanka in the second ODI on Sunday night (as briefly reported in Mondays Late City edition). 

Pakistan, opting for first strike, posted an imposing 313 for nine in their 50 overs and dismissed Sri Lanka for 215 in 39.5 overs to take an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the series. 

Butt and Hameed put Pakistan in control with an entertaining 98-run stand off 100 deliveries for the second wicket before falling in successive Malinga Bandara overs. 

Bandara had both batsmen caught and bowled to finish with three for 56 off 10 overs. 

Man-of-the-Match Butt scored an 81-ball 74 studded with 11 fours, while Hameed hit 50 off 53 deliveries including seven boundaries. 

Pakistan, who won the first match by five wickets on Friday, consolidated their sound start as the middle and lower order chipped in with useful contributions. 

Sri Lanka, without key players Muthiah Muralidharan, Chaminda Vaas and Kumar Sangakkara, also missed the services of rested duo Sanath Jayasuriya and Lasith Malinga. 

Skipper Mahela Jayawardene scored 61 off 69 deliveries, including six fours and a six, but his effort was far too little.

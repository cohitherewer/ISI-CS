 Dravid holds back Kumble

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chittagong: Rahul Dravid decided against using Anil Kumble on the final day in the belief that he might be needed later. 

The Indian captain admitted after the drawn first Test on Tuesday that he was planning to use Kumble in the match but was not sure if the law would permit him to do so. Kumble, who was down with fever, didnt take the field for a single day in the rain-marred match. 

He came to the field on Tuesday and went back to the hotel before the match got over. 

We wanted to play a gamble by fielding Kumble on the final day. I didnt know the law and was planning to have a word with the umpires on this issue. But we later thought it would be wiser to give him more rest before the final Test, Dravid said after the match. 

Umpire Billy Doctrove said Kumble couldnt be allowed to bowl in normal circumstances. A player has to be in the middle for a certain amount of time to be fit to bowl or bat. Perhaps in Kumbles case, we could have also considered the fact that so much time was lost due to rain, said the West Indian, who left for Dhaka in the evening. 

Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore also felt that Kumbles absence helped their cause.

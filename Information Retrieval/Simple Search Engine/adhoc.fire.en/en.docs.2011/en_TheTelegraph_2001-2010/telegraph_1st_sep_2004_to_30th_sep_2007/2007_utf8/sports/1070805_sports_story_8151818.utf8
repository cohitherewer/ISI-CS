 Atwal makes the cut

Wichita (US): Arjun Atwal made the cut at the $500,000 Preferred Health Systems Wichita Open golf tournament at the Crestview Country Club on Friday. 

The Indian returned a three-under 68 to be at tied 20th spot. His round included six birdies and three bogeys. 

He is eight-under 134 after Day II of the Nationwide Tour tournament. In the second round, he needed 25 putts. While he has been superb on the greens, he is taking time to get to them. He had just 61 per cent greens in regulation. 

Two former champions, Brad Elder (1999) and Bradley Hughes (2004), were tied for the lead at 13-under par. They were two shots clear of a group of three golfers that includes 2003 champion Jeff Kluak. Ben Bates, the 1997 winner, leads a group of five players who are three strokes off the pace. 

Atwal had his first birdie on the 4th, and followed that up with another on the 5th, but dropped a shot on the 6th. A pair of birdies on the 7th and 8th meant he was three-under for the front nine. Birdies on the 14th and 18th were negated by bogeys on the 10th and 16th. 

The cut came at 5-under-par 137 with 70 players advancing to the weekend rounds.

 Bob wanted Mushtaq as deputy: Shaharyar

 Shaharyar Khan 

Karachi: Denying reports that Mushtaq Ahmeds appointment as Pakistan coach Bob Woolmers assistant was done under pressure from captain Inzamam-ul Haq, former PCB chief Shaharyar Khan on Sunday said the leg-spinner was brought in on Woolmers request. 

Speaking to reporters after attending a memorial service for Woolmer in Lahore, Shaharyar said: Inzamam didnt push for it. Woolmer told me that it would be a good idea to have Mushtaq, as he has good communication skills, is a good professional and gets along well with everyone. So I agreed to have him in the team, the ex-PCB chief said. 

Shaharyar also narrated another incident highlighting the fact that Woolmer didnt have absolute command and respect in the team. 

Last year, when some players were sent back from England, they misbehaved with Woolmer and he in turn complained to me how the players had misbehaved, he recalled. 

Shaharyar said the PCB had not taken any action against the errant players following a request from Woolmer. 

Woolmer said let me handle the situation. I will talk to them and cool them down. Their outburst and misbehaviour was an example of their frustration and their keenness to play for Pakistan, Shaharyar recalled.

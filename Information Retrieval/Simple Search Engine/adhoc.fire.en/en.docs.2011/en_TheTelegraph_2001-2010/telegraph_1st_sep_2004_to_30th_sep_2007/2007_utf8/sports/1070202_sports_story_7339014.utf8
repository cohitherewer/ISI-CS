 Court seeks explanation 

Lahore: Pakistans Supreme Court wants an explanation from cricket authorities about the life ban on former captain Salim Malik for his alleged involvement in match-fixing, an official said Thursday. 

The court is hearing an appeal by 43-year-old Malik against the ban imposed by the PCB in May 2000. Lower courts have rejected the case.

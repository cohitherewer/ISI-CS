 Dettori to have another go at Derby 

 Epsom: Trainer Peter W. Chapple-Hyams Authorized is going to be an odds-on favourite in a decade to win Saturdays prized event, the 2,400m Vodafone Derby Stakes at the Epsom Downs. More importantly, the Montjeu-Funsie colt presents a lifetime chance to the champion jockey Frankie Dettori, who is yet to win the race. 

 The closest Dettori came to winning the Derby was in the 1995 edition of the race when he finished second.

 There are 19 horses in the Derby line-up, which also includes eight from the powerful Irish stable of Aidan Brien. Archipenko heads the stables challenge and the horse will be ridden by Mic Kinane. Gaileo and High Chaparral had helped Brien win his two Derbies in 2001 and the following year. 

 Authorized was lodged as a favourite following his impressive four-length win in the Dante Stakes at York on his seasonal debut. The horses victory will give trainer Chapple-Hyam his second Derby win after Dr Devious won him the race in 1992. 

 Marcus Tregoning, whos Sir Percy won the Epsom Derby last year, is banking on Aqaleem, who will be attempting to become the first Lingfield Derby Trial winner to achieve the double since High-Rise in 1998. 

 Sir Michael Stoute runs Arabian Gulf, Godolphin relies on Eastern Anthem and local trainer Terry Mills has Kid Mambo. Strategic Prince, declared by Paul Cole, will only run if the ground is suitable. 

 Derby odds: 8-10 Authorized, 7/1 Aqaleem, 8-1 Archipenko, 14-1 Soldier of Fortune, 16-1 each Admiralofthefleet, Eagle Mountain, Regime and, Strategic Prince. Rest at 20-1 over. (Agencies)

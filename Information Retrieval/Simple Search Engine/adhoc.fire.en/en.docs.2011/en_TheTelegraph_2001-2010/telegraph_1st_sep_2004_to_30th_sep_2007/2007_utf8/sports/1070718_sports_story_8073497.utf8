The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I want to enjoy every minute of the present, says Sachin 

 - My love for the game hasnt diminished... The hunger is what makes me continue... 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly in London on Tuesday 

London: The talismanic Sachin Tendulkar, vice-captain for the Test series, also interacted with the media (including The Telegraph) on Tuesday afternoon. 

The following are excerpts 

On Lords as a venue 

Its very special... The first time I saw it

 was on the TV, during the 1983 World Cup final... Later, as a 14-year-old,

 I came to the ground with the Star cricket team... I remember we sat next to

 the sightscreen and posed for photographs. 

On whether its a regret that he hasnt got a hundred for India at Lords 

Id like to get one, but wouldnt like to put myself under pressure by thinking on those lines... I did get a hundred during the MCC versus Rest of World charity match last year... Its a fact that the batters dream of getting a hundred at Lords... 

[Sachins highest is 31 in Tests and 14 in ODIs.] 

On memories of his first Test at Lords

 (1990) 

Graham Gooch and (Mohammed) Azharuddin got very good

 hundreds... Gooch got a triple... My role, I think, was largely limited to

 taking a catch (Allan Lambs off Narendra Hirwani)... Of course, the dream that I play at Lords

 got realised. 

On his first Test hundred, at Old Trafford, on the same tour 

As wed lost at Lords, that hundred kept us alive in the series... Id set out to save the match and Im

 happy I could do so... The first hundred is always special. 

On the journey from 1989-90 till now 

Everyone wants to improve... Id like to think Ive become a better player... One learns from experience and one learns to pick the

 signals being sent out by the opposition. 

On whether he sets targets 

Not targets as such, but there are goals... A lot

 of things keep happening and its important not to lose focus... I dont allow the goals to dominate my thinking as its important to keep the mind as free as possible... Its also important to know what youve

 got to contribute... In a way, that becomes a target... 

On this being his last tour of England 

Looks like... The last Test series here was in 2002...

 Then, I didnt know what lay ahead... Whether its my last tour or not, things dont become different and I really want to enjoy every minute of the present... I dont

 want to think of the future. 

On the intensity of his hunger for cricket 

(Grins) Im as hungry as ever... My love for the game hasnt diminished either... The hunger is what makes me continue to take the field... I wont

 play if the enjoyment comes to a stop. 

On the advice from some quarters, after the World Cup, that he look at the mirror and make a call on continuing to play 

I dont need to respond to that. 

On Chandu Borde as cricket manager 

Hes a wonderful person and has seen a lot of cricket... Hes

 there to help us. 

On seniors like him having to play a bigger role in the absence of a full-time coach 

Coach or not, seniors have the responsibility to

 play a big role... It doesnt even matter who is the captain... Collectively, weve

 got to put up a good show. 

On Andrew Flintoff being on the list of injured 

Hes a great player and Id like to see him play when we arent

 the opposition! 

Finally, on the Test series which gets underway on Thursday 

Its going to be very competitive.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pro League may be postponed

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The inaugural Professional Football League, scheduled to start from September 30, is likely to be postponed, according to the All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources. 

The main reason for postponement, sources said, is the sudden change in dates for the 2010 World Cup qualification rounds. 

As per the earlier schedules, India were supposed to play their first World Cup qualifier on February 6, 2008, followed by two more matches on March 26 and June 1, though the groupings were yet be done. 

But under the new format, which was announced by the AFC on Friday, India will have to play the knock-out qualifiers in October. In case India manage to make the next rounds, the matches will be played in November. 

Obviously, the federation would not like to hold its first ever Professional Football League with top players busy elsewhere, said a source. In that case, there is a strong possibility of the league getting postponed. 

Under the changed circumstances, the Pro League, as it is being called, is unlikely to start before October-end or November and may continue till May. 

The AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco, when contacted, did not want to commit on the subject. He, however, said: We have reserved dates for the Pro League. It wont be a problem if we are to reschedule the tournament. 

Colaco also maintained that everything must be adjusted according to World Cup dates. In terms of priority, the Fifa calendar comes first, followed by the AFC and domestic calendars. 

In fact, the new World Cup dates are likely to jeopardise the entire Indian domestic calendar. The clubs which are hoping to get back players after the ONGC Nehru Cup in Delhi may have to release the players once again immediately after the Federation Cup (September 3 to 14) for the World Cup camp. 

The only beneficiaries in the bargain could be the state leagues, especially in Calcutta and Goa. Forced to play in two phases because of the Pro League in between, these states now can hope to continue their championships uninterrupted, though without the national team players.

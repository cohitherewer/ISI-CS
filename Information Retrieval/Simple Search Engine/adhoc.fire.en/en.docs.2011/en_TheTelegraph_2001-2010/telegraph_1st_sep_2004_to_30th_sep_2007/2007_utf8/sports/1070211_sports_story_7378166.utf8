The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Wiser strategy now

 - After the off-loading tamasha... 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Rajkot: Learning from Fridays fiasco, when over 60 pieces of baggage (including suitcases) were off-loaded by Jet Airways in Calcutta, the airline and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have drawn up a different strategy for the Indian and Sri Lankan teams movement out of here. 

And, so, the kit bags (coffins, actually) are going to be put on Sunday evenings flight to Mumbai, while the players will take Mondays morning service en route to Goa. 

We cant have a repeat of Friday... It was embarrassing, somebody from the BCCI told The Telegraph. 

Meanwhile, the off-loaded baggage reached Rajkot (by road from Ahmedabad) around 4.30 am on Saturday and the Jet Airways staff made sure that every single piece was delivered to the team hotel at that hour itself. 

The airlines duty officer here personally supervised everything.

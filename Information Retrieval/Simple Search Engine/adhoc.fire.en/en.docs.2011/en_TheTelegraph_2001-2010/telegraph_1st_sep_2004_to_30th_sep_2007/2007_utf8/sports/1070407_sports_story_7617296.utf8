 Pollock not a worry for Saqibul 

Georgetown: Bangladesh allrounder Saqibul Hasan was unfazed about facing top-ranked South Africa in their Super Eight match on Saturday. 

Saqibul recalls watching Shaun Pollock and Jacques Kallis on television as a 12-year-old fan during the 1999 World Cup in England. 

Two years later he took up the sport although he first played with a tennis ball. He did not strike a cricket ball until he was 14. 

I have already faced Australia and New Zealand so I dont think they will be a worry for me, the 20-year-old told reporters. I am quite confident I can take these guys on. 

We have been watching them on videos. They are good bowlers with good line and length and are quite accurate with the ball. (But) I just want to play my own game, nothing else.

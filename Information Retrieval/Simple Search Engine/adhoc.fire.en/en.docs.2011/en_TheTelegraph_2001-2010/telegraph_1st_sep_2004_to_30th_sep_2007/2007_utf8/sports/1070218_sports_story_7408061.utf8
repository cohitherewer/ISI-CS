 Soccer gold for Orissa eves

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Guwahati: Orissa elbowed out reigning senior national champions Manipur 4-2 in a tie-breaker in the womens football final of the 33rd National Games at Nehru Stadium on Satuday, while hosts Assam beat Tamil Nadu 6-5 via tie-breaker in the mens final. 

Beating Manipur the winners in the last three editions gave Orissa much to cheer about. Cheered on by a packed stadium, this was the first time Orissa gained the upper hand over the Manipur senior womens team. Manipur are also the reigning senior national champions. 

To be fair to Manipur, they appeared the better of the two, but poor finishing cost them the match. Both regulation and extra time ended in a draw. 

Orissa got a headstart in the tie-breaker when N. Noaba Chanu missed the spotkick. Sudipta Dash of Orissa soon gave her team a 1-0 lead. Manipur scored through the second shot taken by L. Naobi Chanu but missed their third kick by M. Mandakeni Devi. Manipurs second goal came through L. Asharani Devi.

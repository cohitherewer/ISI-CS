 Kapil ouster sad: Karim

Patna: Former Indian wicketkeeper Saba Karim on Sunday described former skipper Kapil Devs removal from the post of National Cricket Academy (NCA) chairman as sad chapter in the history of Indian circket. 

The way BCCI treated Kapil Dev, who once brought pride to the country, must be denounced. A legend like Kapil Dev, who as a captain, steered India to bring home the World Cup, should not have been treated in such a nasty way, he said. 

Saba, here to inaugurate the 11th Dhyanchand Throwball Championship, said the BCCI officials should try to have broader conversations with the Indian Cricket League (ICL) instead of treating it as a rival. 

Asked if he was interested in joining the ICL, the former International cricketer said he was not averse to idea though at present he had no such intention.

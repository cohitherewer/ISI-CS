 Mexico clinch third place 

Caracas: Mexico exploited the 38th-minute expulsion of Uruguayan captain Diego Lugano to rally to a 3-1 victory that gave El Tri third place at the Copa America on Saturday. 

Cuauhtemoc Blanco converted the penalty to equalise after Lugano was red-carded for elbowing Gerardo Torrado, and Omar Bra-vo and Andres Guardado scored the other two in the second half. 

Mexico, thus, have finished third or better in four of the last five South American championships. 

Sebastian Abreu gave Uruguay the lead in the 22nd minute, heading in Maximiliano Pereiras cross. 

But after Blanco equalised, Bravo lifted a shot over the hands of goalkeeper Fabian Carini, who was racing off his line, in the 68th minute, and Guardado sealed the victory with a left-footed shot from 25 metres in the 76th. 

Mexico also finished third in 1997 and 1999, and lost to Colombia in the 2001 final. 

El Tri, who lost to the US in the Concacaf Gold Cup two days before the start of the Copa America, have reached the semis five of the seven times they have been invited to play in the South American championships. 

Coming off their penalty-kick loss to Brazil in the semi-finals, Uruguay struggled after Luganos expulsion to maintain possession and feed attacker Diego Forlan. Mexico lost 0-3 to Argentina on Wednesday to set up the third-place match against the Uruguayans. (AP)

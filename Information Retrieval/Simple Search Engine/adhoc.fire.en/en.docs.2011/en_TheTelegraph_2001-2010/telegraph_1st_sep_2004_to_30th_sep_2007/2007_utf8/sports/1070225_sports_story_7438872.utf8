 Countdown to crickets biggest show 

 1996

The 1996 Wills World Cup produced a new champion in Sri Lanka, the first time a host/co-host had won the trophy. The tournament, staged jointly by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, was dogged by controversy even before the first ball had been bowled. Australia and the West Indies refused to send their teams to Sri Lanka following the Central Bank bombing by the LTTE that killed 90 and injured thousands, a fortnight before the start of the tournament. The International Cricket Council ruled that Sri Lanka would be awarded both games by forfeit. 

The opening ceremony at Eden Gardens turned out to be a flop. The much-hyped laser show malfunctioned and the compere was embarrassing, drawing much flak from the public. But as the matches started, off-field activities took a backseat. 

Three teams made their World Cup debut: the United Arab Emirates, The Netherlands and Kenya. The Netherlands all their five matches while the UAE beat only the Dutch. Kenya, however, recorded a surprise and sensational victory over the West Indies in Pune. 

The Sri Lankans, coached by Dav Whatmore and led by Arjuna Ranatunga, used Player of the Tournament Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana as openers to take advantage of the fielding restrictions in the first 15 overs. The use of pinch-hitters turned out to be hugely significant, as runs piled in those early overs tilted the scales in favour of those teams vis-a-vis teams which believed in accumulating and accelerating in the closing stages. 

Sri Lanka scored 117 in those opening overs against India, 123 against Kenya, 121 against England in the quarter final and 86 against India in the semi-final. Against Kenya, Sri Lanka made a record 398 for five, that stood till April 2006. 

There were some sterling performances and memorable moments --- Mark Taylors refusal to claim a slip catch at a crucial stage against the West Indies and superb batting from Sachin Tendulkar and Mark Waugh. The match that still remains etched in memory is the quarter final between India and Pakistan in Bangalore. The home team won by 39 runs, thanks to a partisan crowd and some electrifying performances, led by Navjyot Singh Sidhus fighting 93 and boosted by Ajay Jadejas 45 off 25 balls. Venkatesh Prasad and Anil Kumble claimed three wickets apiece. Pakistan blamed the defeat on the last-minute pullout of Wasim Akram citing injury. 

Sri Lanka won the infamous first semi-final against India at Eden Gardens. Chasing Sri Lankas 251 for eight, India slumped to 120 for eight in the 35th over when sections of the crowd became unruly and hurled plastic bottles onto the field. 

The players left the field for 20 minutes in an attempt to pacify the crowd. When they returned, more bottles were thrown, forcing an abandonment. Match Referee Clive Lloyd awarded the match to Sri Lanka, the first default ever in a Test or one-day International. 

In the second semi-final in Mohali, Australia recovered from 15 for four to reach 207 for eight from their 50 overs. The West Indians reached 165 for two in the 42nd over before losing their last eight wickets for 37 runs in 50 balls. 

In the final at the Gaddafi, Sri Lanka sent Australia in to bat despite the team batting first having won all five previous World Cup finals. Taylor top-scored with 74 in a total of 241 for seven. After Australia had put down no fewer than five catches, Sri Lanka won in the 47th over by seven wickets. Aravinda de Silva followed up his three for 42 with an unbeaten 107 to win the Player of the Match award.

 Football coach caught cheating

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: In any institution, cheating during examination calls for immediate expulsion. It doesnt seem to be the case in football. 

In an unsavoury incident, a state-level football coach, who also happens to be a school teacher by profession, has been caught red-handed for cheating during the prestigious AFC Licence C examination, but local officials are trying their best to hush up the entire incident. 

So much so, that the coordinator of Vision Delhi, under whom the course was being conducted in the first week of May, didnt even bother to mention the incident in their report. He was forced to rewrite his report on Thursday after some other members objected to it. 

A Delhi Soccer Association (DSA) official said the incident happened at the Football House. 

Sunil Singh Patwal was caught copying in the examination. He has coached Delhi state team recently in the under-13 nationals 

The problem is that Sunils father is an influential DSA member, the official said. 

He doesnt want his son to face three-year expulsion from the course.

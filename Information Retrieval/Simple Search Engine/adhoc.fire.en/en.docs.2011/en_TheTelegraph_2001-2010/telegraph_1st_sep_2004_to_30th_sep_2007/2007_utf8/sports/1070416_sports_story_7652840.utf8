 Toxicology report indicates poisoning

London/Kingston: The long-awaited toxicology report in Bob Woolmers murder case has indicated that the former Pakistan coach was poisoned before being strangled in his hotel room. 

According to a source close to the Jamaican police, the investigators probing Woolmers death believe the South African was poisoned before being murdered in his hotel room, according to a report in a London daily. 

Mark Shields, the deputy police commissioner leading the inquiry, said the toxicology samples and post-mortem report would be sent to Britain for further analysis. 

If he was manually strangled and asphyxiated, why didnt he put up a fight? Ive always said there was a possibility he was incapacitated by something else. 

 If I tell you they (the results) have come back and we are conducting further tests, I suggest you draw your own conclusions, he said at a press conference in Kingston on Saturday. 

Shields described the toxicology results as encouraging but said the probe could take a long haul. 

There are three possibilities. One is that someone could give themselves up. Two, there could be a massive breakthrough or, three, we are here for the long haul. 

At the moment we are certainly in category three. We would love to move to one but I think that is unlikely at this stage, Shield said. 

He quashed the speculation that it was the drug aconite, which causes asphyxia. 

The tests, which are preliminary, also showed relatively low levels of alcohol in Woolmers blood, contradicting reports he had downed a bottle of scotch before he died. 

There was evidence he was drinking, but no evidence that he was drunk, the source was quoted as saying. 

Shields said they were still reviewing CCTV footage recovered from the hotel and there was some progress in the analysis of these materials, which were sent to Scotland Yard. 

I now have some of the results which are excellent and give a clearer picture of what took place, Shields said. 

But he said it did not bring them any closer to identifying who entered Woolmers room on the fateful night. Its too early to speak specifically about a suspect, he said. 

Meanwhile, another British newspaper reported that Scotland Yard detectives were withdrawing from Jamaica, having made no apparent progress in the investigation. 

With no suspect or motive identified almost a month after Woolmer was found dead, Metropolitan police officers will head back to London, it said. 

Shields said the Metropolitan police officers had volunteered to return to the Caribbean if their help were required.

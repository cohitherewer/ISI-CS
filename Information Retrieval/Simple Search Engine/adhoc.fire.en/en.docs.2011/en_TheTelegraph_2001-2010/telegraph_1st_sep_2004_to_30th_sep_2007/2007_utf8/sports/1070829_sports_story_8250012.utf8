 Dravid back in top 5

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Team India captain Rahul Dravid has batted his way back into the top five in the latest LG ICC Player Rankings for ODI batsmen following his performances against England in the current ODI series. 

According to an ICC release, Dravids contributions of 46, 92 not out and 56 in the first three ODIs in the seven-match series have helped him climb up eight places at No. 5. 

There has been disappointment for Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who has dropped 10 places to 15th position.

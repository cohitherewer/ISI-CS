 Jyoti leads Indian challenge in Wentworth

Wentworth: Ace golfer Jyoti Randhawa will lead the Indian challenge at the PGA Championship, one of the most prestigious weeks on the European Tour, here from Thursday. 

Apart from Randhawa, top golfers Jeev Milkha Singh and Shiv Kapur will be in the fray. 

The trio is spending most of their time in Europe. But next month Jeev will cross the Atlantic to participate in the US Open. 

Randhawa has a chance of making the majors by bagging some good results in the next few weeks and getting into top-50 of the world. 

He missed a good chance last week as he double-bogeyed the last hole and dropped from a possible top-10 to tied 21st finish at the Irish Open. 

Kapur has been having a season of mixed results. He finished second to Randhawa in an Indian Tour event two weeks ago. 

Jeev has not been able to find the form that saw him make waves at the Augusta Masters, where he maintained good positions for three days before ending 37th on his Masters debut. 

Randhawa will tee off with Graeme McDowell and Anthony Wall while Jeev will go out with former BMW Asian Open winner Gonzalo Fernandez Castano and Paul McGinley in the afternoon. 

Later, Kapur plays with Richard Hanlan and Kyron Sullivan. 

Meanwhile, Henrik Stenson will be looking to grab the BMW PGA championship which has a winners cheque of 725,000 euro to strengthen his hold at the top of the 2007 European Tour Order of Merit. 

After adding two more significant victories to his name Dubai Desert Classic and the WGC Accenture match play this year, Stenson is looking to make it a hattrick here. He is currently seventh in the world. 

Stenson holds top spot on the Order of Merit with a total of 1,615,383 euro, but his position will come under huge pressure from a world-class international field. 

South Africas Ernie Els, ranked fifth in the world, heads a list of global stars that also includes Vijay Singh of Fiji (6th); South Africas Retief Goosen, ranked nine in the world and second on the European Tour Order of Merit; Luke Donald of England (10th); Padraig Harrington of Ireland (11th) and Englands Paul Casey (15th). 

In all, 20 winners from the current season are taking part along with seven major championship winners. 

Irelands Padraig Harrington will scoop a bonus of one million euros ($1.35 million) if he can follow Sundays win at the Irish Open with another victory here.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 After Glasgow, ECB on guard

 - SECURITY OFFICER FOR INDIA

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: The June 30 terror strike at Glasgow International Airport, less than 48 hours before Team Indias arrival there for a match which never took place, has led to tightening of security for the Rahul Dravids. 

Cant-take-a-chance seems to be the name of the game. The Indian cricketers, after all, are among the most high profile of sports fraternity-travellers. 

Exactly a year ago, the touring Pakistanis had to be more vigilant after bombs went off on buses and on the tube. 

After what happened (in Glasgow) and everything thats going on, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has appointed a security officer He joined the team last Wednesday and is going to remain with the boys throughout the tour, the Boards chief administrative officer, Ratnakar Shetty, told The Telegraph. 

As the ECB wasnt associated with the matches in Belfast and Glasgow, Wednesday marked the formal start of Indias tour. 

It continues till September 8. 

Speaking from Mumbai on Tuesday afternoon, Shetty added: The ECB, I understand, has also sent a circular to the team Clearly, all precautions are being taken 

The security officer, apparently drawn from a private firm, is one David. 

Weve been addressing him as David only and hes doing a fine job Hes on call 24x7 and is in regular touch with the ECB, manager Rocky Rufus said from Hove. 

The security bit, though, is being carried too far. 

For example, the operators at the team hotel in Brighton (next to Hove) have been refusing to put calls through to the cricketers. Their explanation security reasons. 

Its a line often taken by some hotels in India too. 

In recent years, incidentally, the ECB has taken to arranging its own security personnel for tours to India. The last was between February-April 2006.

 Chopra century in vain

London: Opener Aakash Chopras valiant 106 went in vain as the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) lost a three-day cricket match to Sri Lanka A by ten wickets here on Thursday. 

Chopra held one end up for nearly four-and a-half hours and struck 13 boundaries as most of the other MCC batsmen faltered miserably. 

The former India batsman put up a useful 95-run partnership with Tomas Westley (42) and a 77-run stand with wicketkeeper C.G. Prowting (48) to help the hosts reach 254 in their second innings. 

In reply, Sri Lanka A rode on a century from wicketkeeper-batsman Kaushal Silva (118) to post a formidable 415 for seven declared. 

Needing seven to win, the visitors romped home without losing any wicket. 

BRIEF SCORES 

MCC 167 amp; 254 (A. Chopra 106). Sri Lanka A 415/7 dec. amp; 7/0. Sri Lanka A won by 10 wkts.

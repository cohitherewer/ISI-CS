 Leander: Focus on grasscourt season

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Leander Paes and Martin Damm were within striking distance of the No. 1 ranking in the ATP Doubles Race two months ago. The Indo-Czech pair would have displaced Bob and Mike Bryan atop the rankings by beating the American twins in the final of the Miami Masters. 

That didnt happen, Paes and Damm getting edged out in a close match. They havent had another chance to reach the summit since. In fact, the duo slipped to No. 3 at the start of this week, primarily because they played just one tournament together after that (the Rome Masters). 

We will be playing the French Open, but clay is not our strength Our focus is the grasscourt season, followed by hardcourt, Paes told The Telegraph on Tuesday, explaining why they have played just one claycourt event before next weeks Grand Slam event. I skipped the Hamburg Masters (last week) because the damp weather there doesnt suit me. Even last year I fell ill. 

Now that the gap between them and the Bryan twins has increased substantially, how do they plan to bridge it? We have to recapture our No. 2 position first (from Paul Hanley and Kevin Ullyett) and then try to consolidate our position, said the Davis Cup captain who was in the city for personal work.

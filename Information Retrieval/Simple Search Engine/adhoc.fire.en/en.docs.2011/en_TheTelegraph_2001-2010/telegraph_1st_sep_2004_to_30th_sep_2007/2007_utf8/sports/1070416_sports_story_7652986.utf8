The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bengal begin with win 

Ahmedabad: Powered by a quick-fire 57 not out by middle-order batsman Rana Chowdhury, Bengal on Sunday posted a 16-run victory over Tamil Nadu in the Twenty20 Inter-State opener. 

Chowdhury, who had come to bat at the fall of fourth wicket for 82 runs, struck four sixes and four fours in his 28-ball innings in the match played at Motera Satium here. 

Bengals skipper Manoj Tewari (52) was the only other notable contributor for the team. Tewari struck four fours and one six in his 42-balls innings, reminding the selectors that he could be one of the probables for the upcoming Bangladesh tour. 

Meanwhile, in Mumbai, Punjab struggled to chase the modest score put up by Railways before eking out a two-wicket victory with two balls to spare.

 Yousuf to meet PCB chief

Karachi: Mohammed Yousuf will meet Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf on Wednesday to decide on whether to join the Indian Cricket League (ICL) or make himself available for the coming home series against South Africa. 

PCB chief executive Shafqat Naghmi confirmed that Yousuf would be meeting with Ashraf on Wednesday (September 26) in Lahore to discuss his future with the Pakistan team. 

No agenda has been finalised for this meeting. But since Yousuf is a very important member of the team, the chairman will try to persuade him to give Pakistan the top priority, Naghmi said. 

Ashraf is confident of convincing Yousuf to cancel his ICL contract and play for Pakistan. 

The PCB is adamant that any player, who signs up for the ICL, will not be considered for the national team. Yousuf, former captain Inzamam-ul Haq, Abdul Razzaq and Imran Farhat had joined the ICL. 

Yousuf, who made a record-breaking 1,788 runs in 11 Tests with nine hundreds in 2006, was a shock omission from Pakistans Twenty20 squad. 

When contacted Yousuf said he had not given any thought to his immediate future but would like to see what the chairman has to say. 

Sources said the PCB was still not that serious about convincing the other three players to drop their ICL contracts but were expecting them to follow suit once yousuf was back in their fold. One source said the board was willing to compensate Yousuf for the loss of earning he will face if he cancels his ICL contract. (PTI)

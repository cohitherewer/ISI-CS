The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sajid Mahmood ruled out

London: England have named an unchanged team for the third Test against the West Indies at Old Trafford, Manchester, starting on Thursday. 

Nottinghamshire left-armer Ryan Sidebottom retains his place following his eight-wicket haul against the West Indies at Headingley in the record innings victory that helped England to a 1-0 lead in the four-Test series. 

Matthew Hoggard and Sajid Mahmood as well as Andrew Flintoff were all unavailable through injury, but batsmen Ian Bell has been passed fit. 

Ian Bell has made excellent progress after suffering a back spasm that saw him sit out the last four days of the second Test, chairman of selectors David Graveney said in a statement on Sunday. 

Provided he gets through Warwickshires Friends Provident Trophy match on Sunday, hes expected to be fully fit for Old Trafford. 

James Anderson has not been named in the squad but will be the standby seam bowler, joining the team on Wednesday evening in case of late illness or injury. 

Lancashire seamer Mahmoods hopes of breaking back into the England team for the remaining two Tests have disappeared after it was announced on Saturday that he is to undergo surgery. 

Mahmood, who last played for England in the fifth Ashes Test in Australia in January, is to have a double hernia operation on Tuesday and is unlikely to play again for five to six weeks, his county said on their website.

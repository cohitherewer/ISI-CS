 Bengal win, stay in hunt

 - East zone one-dayers 

Cuttack: It was again Ranadeb Bose, who helped Bengal clinch a thrilling 10-run win over Orissa in the National One-dayers (East Zone) match at the Barabati Stadium in Cuttack on Saturday. In reply to Bengals 175 in 22 overs, the hosts were all out for 165 with Bose and stand-in skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla claiming three wickets apiece. 

Bengal improved their chances of making the knock-out stage of the National One-dayers by virtue of this win in the truncated match. 

The Bengal-Orissa match was delayed because of a wet outfield, the result of Fridays heavy downpour, and was reduced to a 22-over affair. 

Assam, which has 10 points from three matches so far with an encounter against Tripura pending, Bengal also had 10 points from an equal number of ties and is yet to play Jharkhand which has five points from three matches. 

Unless Jharkhand snatches five points including a bonus point from the last tie against Bengal, the latter would have no difficulty qualifying for the next round. 

Bengal decided to bat first after winning the toss and hit up 175 for six in the allotted overs as openers Wriddhiman Saha made 55 off 44 balls and Subhomoy Das scored 36 off 35 balls. 

Stand-in skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla made a 12-ball 25 as Orissa was set the target at an asking rate of eight per over. 

P. Jayachandra (2/25), Niranjan Behera (2/43) and Debasis Mohanty (1/29) took the wickets for Orissa. 

The home side did take up the challenge and reached 98 for three in the 13th over despite two early jolts when opener BBCC Mohapatra (0) and one-drop Behera (1) were sent back. 

Opener Bikash Swarup Pati made a breezy 51 in 41 balls which included five fours and three sixes while P. Jayachandra (38 off 28 balls) and Subit Biswal (24) kept the chase till wickets began to fall.

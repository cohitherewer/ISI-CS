Calcutta: The first big match of the city-based aspirants in the National Football League (NFL) is taking place at a time when they are struggling to cope up with the challenges from the likes of Mahindra United, Sporting Clube de Goa, Dempo or JCT. 

For both East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting, it has not been a smooth kick-off to the premier tournament, having tasted defeat once. Their ambitions from the third-round match are contrasting, though. 

While Mohammedan Sporting coach Subhas Bhowmick wants to forget the 0-5 humiliation at the hands of Dempo and start afresh, hoping to snatch a point on Thursday, his East Bengal counterpart, Carlos Roberto Pereira wants to keep the winning momentum going. 

 My boys would be playing safe, Bhowmick said after Wednesdays practice at the club ground on Wednesday. My aim is to play for one point... but if situation demands, we would definitely go after something more, he maintained. 

With no foreigner in his squad, Mohammedan Sporting are likely field Raman Vijayan and Bijen Singh upfront. Both being fit and fine, feature prominently on the coachs plans. 

However, the mid-field would be a bit concern for Bhowmick. It is this department of the game, which failed to function and cost the team dear against Dempo. 

While custodian Gopal Das is almost certain to don the jersey, a fully fit Debjit Ghosh is all set to make a comeback on Thursday. Madhab Das would accompany Ghosh. 

Bhowmick, however, knew how dangerous his opponents could be and brushed aside any idea of taking them lightly. They (East Bengal) are a good side. Though recently they may have failed to deliver their best... On their day they can upset any defence. 

East Bengal made their ambitions clear when Pereira stressed on three points from the match. The Brazilian, though, showed lot of respect for his counterpart. 

There is no scope of disregarding them. That they have badly lost to Dempo, does not imply they are a weak side... I respect their coach also He has the great skill of controlling a match even sitting out on the reserve bench. 

With both the clubs scoring three points from two encounters (both had won one and lost one), Thursday is expected to witness a good fight, with its usual quota of promise and pressure.

 Govt move is against IOC rules: Kalmadi

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) on Thursday accused the government of trying to gag the sports federations in the country through its sports policy, a draft of which was released a few days ago. 

Speaking on the sidelines of a workshop on Sports Management and Planning for the Commonwealth Games, IOA president Suresh Kalmadi said the governments attempt to put up a regulatory body to supervise the functioning of the sports federations is against the IOC rules. 

Federations in India are autonomous as per the IOC rules, Kalmadi said. 

Taking a dig at sports minister Mani Shankar Aiyer, the IOA chief said: People may say whatever they want to, but bringing the federations under the government is simply not possible. 

The draft sports policy has already raised a controversy by suggesting that the government should create a regulatory mechanism to oversee the ministry, sports federations and the IOA. 

The IOA boss also continued his onslaught on the sports minister saying Aiyer was instrumental in creating a negative atmosphere about sports in general in the country. 

Kalmadi, evidently, is still licking his wounds about losing the Asian Games bid to Incheon in South Korea. 

It was the sports minister, who proposed before the Cabinet not to bid for the Asiad. He did it only a week before the bid in Kuwait City. Naturally, we lost the bid. 

While the sports policy said organising mega events like Asian Games or Commonwealth Games will help very little in improving the standard of Indian sports, Kalmadi countered saying such events would broaden the horizon of sports in the country. 

The IOA chief regretted that the government was not releasing money for training of athletes for the Beijing Olympics. The government is paying meagre amount. It is not enough for proper training.

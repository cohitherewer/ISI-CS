 SHARP SINGLES 

Ban on Pak players

Montego Bay: The Pakistan team has been banned from speaking in English at World Cup news conferences to prevent players from being misquoted, according to a team spokesman.

Former player Pervez Mir, the teams press liaison officer, said at a captains media day in Montego Bay on Sunday that Pakistan players would speak only in Urdu, which would also help to promote tourism to Pakistan. 

This decision was taken by the Pakistan Cricket Board because it is our national language and because 2007 is our National Tourist Year so we are promoting Pakistan as well.

Bucknor plans

 Port Of Spain: Having officiated cricket matches for last 18 years, ICCs Elite panel umpire Steve Bucknor is planning to retire from the job and return to coaching football. The West Indian, who has officiated in 117 Tests so far, said he would not stand in international matches after a couple of more years. 

I am 60 now and I dont think I want to be an international umpire after I am 63, said Bucknor, whose contract with the ICC ends at the end of the 2007 World Cup. He believed an average umpires performance goes down after 63. 

I have noticed that after 63, the performance of the average umpire goes down, so I have given myself another two years at most.

Speed message

 Bridgetown: International Cricket Council chief executive Malcolm Speed has called on all players in the World Cup to remember they are role models following Sundays opening ceremony in Jamaica. 

Speed wrote in a statement issued by the games governing body that his only wish was that the spirit of cricket shone through. 

That will help to create a real feel-good factor around the event that can serve as a springboard for its continued growth and development on a long-term basis, both throughout the West Indies and worldwide, one way we can ensure our strong sport gets even stronger, he said.

Die-hard fan

 Jamshedpur: A cricket-crazy Indian is threatening to kill himself if he is not allowed to sell a kidney to fund a trip to the World Cup in the Caribbean. Tarun Sharma, 23, said Monday he would set himself on fire later this week if no one came forward to help him sell the organ. 

I will kill myself if I am denied a chance to watch the Indians play in the West Indies, Sharma said.

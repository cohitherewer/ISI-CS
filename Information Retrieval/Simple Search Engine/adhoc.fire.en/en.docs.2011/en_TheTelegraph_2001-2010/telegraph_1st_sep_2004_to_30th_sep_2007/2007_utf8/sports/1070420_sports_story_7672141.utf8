The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 For now, the same old excuses

 - Maidans Big Three not averse to shifting base 

NILESH BHATTACHARYA 

Calcutta: Sailen Manna, who has seen Indian football plunge from the marvellous to the messy, has touched on a theme which present-day administrators are guilty of: the tendency to live on past laurels and do precious little for the present or future. 

This state of affairs, says Manna, is something we are all aware of and doesnt need to be pointed out by Joseph Blatter. Yet the octogenarian, a representative of Indian footballs golden age, believes the Fifa chiefs comment that our infrastructure is from the past, past century will help shake up the system. 

You cant point at one Sailen Manna and say that this is our football. We have to keep track of what is happening around the world and adjust to the changing times accordingly. Unfortunately this has not been the case here, he lamented while speaking to The Telegraph on Thursday. 

We still have good talents, but lack the proper base to groom them, he said rather bluntly. 

Calcuttas Big Three the so-called cradle of Indian football admit there is a lack of infrastructure and essential amenities, but also express their helplessness due to numerous factors. They are unanimous in their belief that Blatters comment is a wake-up call, but remain clueless about taking the proper initiative. 

Basic facilities like swimming pool, gymnasium, rest room, training grounds seem like a luxury here. Of the Big Three, only East Bengal have a gym at their Maidan tent. Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting have been longing for one, but say there arent adequate funds. 

They, however, holler in agreement that with strict Army regulations in place, initiating changes even cosmetic ones to improve the existing structure is next to impossible. 

We need Army permission even for laying a single brick, stresses Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra. Though the All India Football Federation has promised to take up the issue with the Defence ministry, Mitra is sceptical about such a move bearing fruit. 

The solution? The clubs are thinking of shifting base. But there are problems there as well. East Bengals grand project for a multi-complex facility has been lying in cold storage as the state government is yet to make a move on identifying land. 

Mohammedan Sporting have been asking for the Dumurjola Sports Complex, but several rounds of discussion with the state and Howrah municipality have yielded no result. Mohun Bagans request for land, preferably in Rajarhat, has also met with no response from the government. 

We wont be able to move an inch without the governments patronage. Tell me, has any MP or MLA ever used sport as an agenda on his/her election manifesto? Since our society is politics-driven, they must come forward to start a sporting culture, Mitra argued. 

This is nothing but common escape route for the club managements. 

Every season, clubs featuring in the National Football League are supposed to get Rs 2.5 lakh as appearance fee for each match. Add to this the gate money from other tournaments and annual budget which comes to almost Rs 2 crore a year. 

A huge amount of money is spent on recruiting players including mediocre foreigners but little attention is given towards improving grounds or other needs of the players. We need to spend money on recruiting good players because the fans are driven by success, says Sultan Ahmed, Mohammedan Sporting secretary. We cant ignore fans emotions. 

What about running the club by professional people? The officials nod in agreement and say that the attitude towards developing the game has to change. 

I dont know about other clubs, but hiring a CEO is not a problem for us. After the ASEAN win in Jakarta, we hired 12 sports management students from IISWBM and sought their views for improvement, Dr Shanti Ranjan Dasgupta, East Bengals vice-president, says. 

The problem is we are a supporter-based club and turning it into a professional set-up requires constitutional amendment. It cant happen overnight, he added. 

Subhas Bhowmick summed it up nicely. If Jagmohan Dalmiya could generate big money by marketing Indian cricket, why cant the same thing be done in football? 

Is anybody listening?

 England banking on Joyce factor

 Michael Vaughan 

Georgetown: England have prepared for their opening Super Eight match with Ireland on Friday in the same way as they would for any other side, captain Michael Vaughan said on Thursday. 

First and foremost we respect the Irish because they deserve to be in the Super Eight, Vaughan said. 

Weve prepared in exactly the same fashion as we would have done for any other team. There is no pressure on the Irish in any of these Super Eight games so they are going to be a really hard team to beat. 

England though have a ready-made spy to help them in the battle of the British Isles. In-form England opener Ed Joyce was born in Dublin and played for Ireland until 2005. 

We have Ed Joyce in our camp who has given us all the insight, said Vaughan 

I have told team analyst Mark Garaway a little bit. I know 11 or 12 of the Irish guys pretty well but there are couple who have come in who I havent seen very much of, said Joyce. 

I will be able to help out with a few tips but you have to keep things pretty basic against most teams whether you are playing against Australia or against Ireland so I think were going to be keeping it pretty simple. 

Ireland coach Adrian Birrell is not worried by Joyces role. 

Ed played for Ireland until 2005 and was brought up with a lot of our players and would know our players very well so I dont think there will be too many secrets, he said. 

Equally, weve been watching tapes of England from the Champions Trophy so weve seen them a lot more than theyve seen us. That will be the case for every team we meet. 

Irelands major worry is the fitness of captain Trent Johnston, who has been struggling with a shoulder injury and missed the West Indies defeat last Friday.

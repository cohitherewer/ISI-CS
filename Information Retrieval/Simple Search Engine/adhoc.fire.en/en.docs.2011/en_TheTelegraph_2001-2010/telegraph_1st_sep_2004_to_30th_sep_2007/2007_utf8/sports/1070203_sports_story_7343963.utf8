The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 It depends on how we bat, says Sourav 

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Mumbai: The ability to fight back from uncertain situations has been a key feature of Bengals performance this season. Friday was no exception at the Wankhede. 

At a time when Sachin Tendulkar and Wasim Jaffer appeared set to take Mumbai to a position of strength, Bengal struck back. After having dismissed Sachin, they sent back Jaffer and Mumbai captain Amol Muzumdar also in the final session. 

Sourashish (Lahiri) and Sourav (Ganguly) took two crucial wickets in the final session and its good to see the team bounced back into the match in the end, Bengal coach Paras Mhambrey said. 

Though Mhambrey looked a satisfied man, he was quick to remind one of the still unfinished job. Bengal still need to overcome the challenges of Ramesh Powar, Ajit Agarkar and Zaheer Khan, apart from the unbeaten batsmen Rohit Sharma (9) and Avishek Nair (4). 

You never know what these players are capable of and, so, if we can restrict them to 350, we will have the upper hand tomorrow, Mhambrey said. 

Former India captain Sourav also sounded cautious. Everything will depend on how we bat in the first innings and nothing else, he said while leaving the ground for his Cricket Club of India room. 

Jaffer, later addressing the media, paid rich tributes to Sachin. When he was there he always asked me to stay calm and that paid off at the end, the opener said. 

Jaffer, however, admitted that the first session of Day II will be crucial for both teams.

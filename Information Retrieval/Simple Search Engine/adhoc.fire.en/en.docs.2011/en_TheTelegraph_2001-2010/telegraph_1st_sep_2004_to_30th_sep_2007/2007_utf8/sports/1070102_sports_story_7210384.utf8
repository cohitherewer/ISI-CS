The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Shane has been crickets biggest showman, says Ravi Shastri

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE

 FIRST TEST VICTIM SALUTES WARNE AS HE STARTS HIS LAST TEST 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Shane Warne 

Cape Town: Ravi Shastri was Shane Warnes first Test victim. The former India captain, who is in South Africa on a TV assignment, spoke to The Telegraph exclusively about the talismanic Australian on the eve of his last appearance. Shastri, incidentally, got a double hundred in that drawn Test at the SCG. Sachin Tendulkar got 148. 

The following are excerpts 

On his impressions of Warne when he made his Test debut (January 2, 1992) 

What stood out even then was the tremendous control he had... That was my first impression... He bowled leg-break after leg-break, spun the ball... Shane had a good temperament, too... He was being smacked by Sachin and me, but kept coming back and wasnt afraid of tossing the ball... 

 Ravi Shastri 

On whether he interacted with Warne during that Test 

After getting the MoM award, Shane and I crossed each other and I told him hey, youll bowl a lot worse than this, but still take six-seven wickets... A few months later, he actually did that against the West Indies. 

On the future he saw for Warne at that point in time 

Id be lying if I said Id thought he would get past 700 wickets. However, even then, it looked possible he would get 300-350... 

On his memories of taking on Warne (en route to 206) before getting out 

I remember a few inside-out shots off him... I recall a six I hit over extra-cover... I used my feet a lot and got out trying to force the pace... I think I was caught on the boundary (by Dean Jones). 

On Warnes career 

Ive been following it closely as I started working on television from 1994... Hes definitely one of the greatest spinners... More than that, I think Shane has been crickets biggest showman... He has backed that image with outstanding performances consistently... Indeed, Shane has been a rare breed... Look back and youre going to see he has an eye for the occasion and the amazing ability to write his own script... For example, starting his last Test at the MCG on 699 wickets... Indeed, he has a quality which is endearing and, so, people forget the off-field tamasha he has been involved in... 

On Warnes variety 

He has everything... The googly, the flipper... The lethal leg-break... He can spin from two-three feet outside leg-stump... The delivery which got Mike Gatting (at Old Trafford in 1993) is rightly called the Ball of the (last) Century... 

On Warne not being a success in India 

If I recall correctly, the first time he came (1997-98), hed just come off surgery... Then, in 2001, we played him really well... Not once, though, did Shane put his hands up to say hed had enough... He was still plotting... Our batsmen attacked him, but he wanted to be competitive... He got some wickets on his last trip (2004-05), didnt he? [Warne got 14 in the first three Tests.] 

On whether the many controversies have taken some sheen off an otherwise brilliant career 

No People wont remember Shane for controversies, they will remember him as a performer par excellence... Frankly, people dont care much about the controversies... He has been the box office, the theatre... He opted out of the one-day game, or his impact wouldve been as significant in that form as well... He had great spells in the 1999 World Cup won by Australia. 

On Warne having been involved with bookies (in the Nineties) and, then, being banned for doping (in 2003) 

Hes human... At times, mistakes are made... The important thing is to learn from them... No one is perfect and Shane got punished... After the doping ban, for example, he returned stronger, harder... He was hungry. 

On the lesson young spinners should take from Warne 

They must learn to be mentally as tough... Learn from his work ethics... Learn to read the game the way he does... 

On whether he recalls any one cricket-specific conversation with Warne 

Not off the cuff... However, whenever we spoke, it would be engaging stuff... I knew I was talking to an outstanding cricket mind. 

On controversies having cost Warne the captaincy 

Its disappointing... Shane has a terrific cricket brain and wouldve made a great captain. 

[In a stand-in capacity, Warne led in 11 ODIs. He lost one, no more.] 

On contemporaries crediting Warne with bringing the spotlight back on the spinners, not only leggies 

Oh, not just that... Shane attracts crowds... They want to see his leg-breaks, want to see him write a memorable script... As Ive told you, he has been crickets No.1 showman. 

On whether Warne couldve continued for a season or two 

Going by form, yes, but a sportsman knows when his time is up. 

On an adequate replacement for Australia 

No... Not for years to come... Later, who knows? 

On the perfect ending for the Warne-script 

A ten-wicket haul at the SCG... The Test is also (Glenn) McGraths last, but the centrestage is going to belong to Shane. 

Finally, his message for Warne 

You deserve all the accolades, mate, but dont for a moment forget the confidence I gave you by becoming your first victim! It will be nice catching up with him.

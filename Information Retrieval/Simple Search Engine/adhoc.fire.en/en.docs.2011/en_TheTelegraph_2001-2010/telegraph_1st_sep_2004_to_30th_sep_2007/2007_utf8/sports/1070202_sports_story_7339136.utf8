The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 AIFF okays tie in city

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Book worms and soccer fans are likely to rub shoulders at the Salt Lake Stadium on February 14 as the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has decided to go ahead with its plans of staging the India versus Myanmar pre-Olympic qualifier that evening. 

Speaking to The Telegraph on Thursday, AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco said the federation would hold the match at the Salt Lake Stadium only after talking to the Bengal sports minister Subhas Chakraborty. 

I had a talk with the AIFF president, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi this morning. He told me to continue with the match on the same day at the same place and not to look for a different venue. The AIFF president would also talk to the state sports minister to do the needful, Colaco said. 

The AIFF bosses were initially shocked to learn the decision of the local authorities back in Calcutta to shift the Book Fair at the Salt Lake Stadium during Indias pre-Olympic qualifier, but said both could be staged together if the Book Fair doesnt get into the main stadium arena. 

Salt Lake Stadium has huge space, so it shouldnt be a problem, though the IFA secretary Subrata Dutta should be the best judge of things, said Colaco. The only advantage is that this particular tie is not a commercial match in the Fifa list. 

International ties which come under Fifa and AFC list have to be hosted according to guidelines provided by the international body. According to AFC rules, the host country could be fined $25,000 if they back out at the last moment.

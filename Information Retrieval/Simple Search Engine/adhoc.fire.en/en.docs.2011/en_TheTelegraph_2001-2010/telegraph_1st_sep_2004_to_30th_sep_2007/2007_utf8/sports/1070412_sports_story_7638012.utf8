 Javed: Curb player power

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain and coach Javed Miandad said on Wednesday that cricket authorities needed to stub out player-power in the national team or no lessons could be learnt from their early World Cup exit. 

Miandad said the authorities needed to change their attitude with players. Unless steps are taken to curb player-power and they are given the message they dont have automatic places in the team, nothing will change, Miandad said on Wednesday. 

Pakistan were bundled out of the World Cup after losing to hosts West Indies and Ireland and also had to cope with the death of their coach Bob Woolmer one day after their first-round elimination. 

Their departure has caused outrage at home with Inzamam-ul Haq, who has stepped down from the captaincy, the chief selector and board officials being grilled by parliamentary bodies. 

The Pakistan Cricket Board has announced suspension of all central contracts of the players and said it would appoint the captain and coach before May 7 after a board meeting Tuesday. 

The boards problems have multiplied with senior batsman Younis Khan also reluctant to captain the side. 

Miandad, who was replaced by Woolmer in 2004, said that the refusal of Younis signified that there were problems in the team.

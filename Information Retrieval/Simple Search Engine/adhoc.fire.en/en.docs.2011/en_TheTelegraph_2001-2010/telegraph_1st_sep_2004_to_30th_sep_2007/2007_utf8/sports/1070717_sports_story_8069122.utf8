Bangkok: Iraq reached the Asian Cup quarter finals for the fourth time in row after holding spirited Oman to a goalless draw in their final group A match on Monday. 

Iraq topped the group with five points but could easily have lost the game after surviving a relentless wave of Omani pressure that could have cost them a place in the last eight. 

Oman needed victory to stand any chance of going through and were on the attack from the outset. They spurned countless chances but could have won the game a minute from time when Younis Al Mushaifris header whistled past the post with the keeper beaten. 

They almost went ahead on 27 minutes when Ismail Al Ajmi latched on to a deep cross and fired into a crowd of players. 

Iraq will play group B runners-up Vietnam in Bangkok on Saturday. 

Meanwhile, holders Japan stormed into the quarter finals with a clinical 4-1 demolition of co-hosts Vietnam at Hanoi on Monday. 

But Vietnam, appearing in the tournament for the first time in 47 years, joined Japan in the last eight after Qatar lost 1-2 to the UAE in the other group B game. 

Japans reward for finishing top of their group is a grudge quarter final against Australia, who avoided an early exit with a 4-0 win over Thailand in Bangkok later on Monday. They play group A runners-up Australia in Hanoi on Saturday. (REUTERS)

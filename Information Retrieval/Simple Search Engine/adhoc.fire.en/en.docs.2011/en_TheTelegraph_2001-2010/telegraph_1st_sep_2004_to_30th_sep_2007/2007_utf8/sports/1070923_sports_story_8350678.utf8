 Jeev, Kapur miss cuts

 Randhawa is at 18th place 

Belfry: Jyoti Randhawa put in a gritty performance and was rewarded with an even-par round that saw him climb up from 26th to 18th place at the midway stage of the Quinn Direct British Masters. 

But his other two colleagues, Jeev Milkha Singh and Shiv Kapur missed the cut on the European Tour event. 

Robert-Jan Derksen of Holland and Englands Mark Foster were tied for the lead at the end of the second round on a very tough day at the Belfry. 

Randhawa put in a creditable performance in wet conditions despite the putts not falling as he carded an even par 72 in the second round and was the only Indian out of the three to make the cut. 

He birdied the third, fifth and seventh holes but also dropped shots on fourth and eighth to turn in one-under. On the back nine, he had just one birdie on 14th against two bogeys on 12th and 17th and ended on even par to be placed two-under 142 for two days.

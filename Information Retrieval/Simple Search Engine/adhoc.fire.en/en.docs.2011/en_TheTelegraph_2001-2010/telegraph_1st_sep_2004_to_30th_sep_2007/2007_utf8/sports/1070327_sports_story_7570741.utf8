 Parnita to play in mens event

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Parnita Garewal will become the first Indian woman to take part in a mens event on Tuesday when she tees off at the Surya Nepal Masters 2007 at the Gokarna Forest Golf Resort with the Standard Chartered Pro-Am in Kathmandu. 

Parnita, who took part in the first ever DLF Womens Indian Open last fortnight, was more than eager to tee off in the countrys biggest professional event. 

I have played at the top level on the Indian amateur circuit and later turned pro. It will be a different experience and I am looking forward for the same, said Parnita. 

The winner in the four-day event will walk away with a handsome cheque of Rs 3.24 lakh (in Nepal currency), while the runner-up will be richer by Rs 2.24 lakh, according to a press release on Monday. 

Former Indian Open winner Feroz Ali, along with three Malaysian professionals Sasidaran, Faradil Atras and Lam Kong Loong are taking part.

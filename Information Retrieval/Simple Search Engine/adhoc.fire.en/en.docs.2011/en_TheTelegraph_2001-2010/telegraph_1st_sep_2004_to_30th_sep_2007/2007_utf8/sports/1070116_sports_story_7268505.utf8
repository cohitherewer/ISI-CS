 Smith accuses Pak fans of racial abuse

Centurion: South African captain Graeme Smith accused Pakistan supporters of racial abuse and said his team was angry about the incidents which led to Herschelle Gibbs being banned for two Tests. 

Theres a lot of anger, Smith said. There was quite a lot of racial abuse from the Pakistan fans towards our players and I think that provoked a lot of what happened. 

There was a particular incident where I went down and got security to move guys away from (boundary fielder) Paul Harris. Herschelle was down at thirdman and he was copping a lot of abuse and, I think, even racial abuse. 

For me going forward the worrying thing is that Pakistan always have a large support base around the world. Security needs to be looked at. 

There was an incident where Makhaya (Ntini) was hit on the head by a Pakistan flag going up the stairs. The guys were provoked and that is why they are angry but we understand that what Herschelle did was wrong. 

Smith said the television company responsible for the stump mike was to blame for allowing Gibbs comments to be broadcast. I think the television companies are actually in breach of their contracts with the stump mikes being on during overs. 

I think theyre only meant to be on when the ball is about to be bowled. (AFP)

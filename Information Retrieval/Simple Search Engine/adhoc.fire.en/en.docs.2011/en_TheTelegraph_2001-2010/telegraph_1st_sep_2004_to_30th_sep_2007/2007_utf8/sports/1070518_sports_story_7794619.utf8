 Call for EPL chiefs resignation

GARY JACOB amp; PETER LANSLEY

The English Premier League (EPL) came under renewed pressure Wednesday night from the Gang of Four incensed by its handling of the Carlos Tevez affair. Wigan Athletic called for the resignation of Sir Dave Richards, the Premier League chairman, and Richard Scudamore, the chief executive, and Sheffield United have taken the first steps in their legal challenge to have West Ham United deducted points for breaching League rules in the transfer of the Argentina forward. 

In a letter shown to The Times, Dave Whelan, the Wigan chairman, questions the conduct of the two League officials since the independent commission imposed a fine of 5.5 million on West Ham last month. 

Whelan queries the time it took to clear Tevez to play when the League had been given the power by the independent commission to remove the forwards registration. 

The Premier League board, made up of Scudamore, Richards and Mike Foster, took that decision within hours of the judgement being announced in the early afternoon of April 27. It required full discussion and was a dereliction of duties, Whelan said. 

The Wigan chairman then asks for their resignation. He also reiterates that the League has failed to provide the evidence that West Ham cancelled the agreement with the companies that own the economic rights to Tevez.

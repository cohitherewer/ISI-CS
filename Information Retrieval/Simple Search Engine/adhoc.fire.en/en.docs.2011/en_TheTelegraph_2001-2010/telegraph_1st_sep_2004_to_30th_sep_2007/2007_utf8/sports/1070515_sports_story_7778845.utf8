 Hewitt may hire Roche 

Sydney: Australia number one Lleyton Hewitt would be interested in hiring Tony Roche, following the veterans sudden split with Roger Federer, his manager said on Monday. 

Hewitt, who is struggling with form and a back injury since winning the Las Vegas Open in March, has been without a full-time coach since Roger Rasheed quit shortly before the Australian Open in January. 

Roche coached world No. 1 Federer on a part-time basis from 2005, but the pair parted ways on Saturday, just two weeks before the French Open. 

Australian newspapers have speculated that Roche may link up with Hewitt. David Drysdale, the players manager, informed reporters the former world number one would be interested. 

I think he does need that little bit of extra support. I know hes getting frustrated at the moment because hes doing a lot of work and not getting the results, Drysdale said. (REUTERS)

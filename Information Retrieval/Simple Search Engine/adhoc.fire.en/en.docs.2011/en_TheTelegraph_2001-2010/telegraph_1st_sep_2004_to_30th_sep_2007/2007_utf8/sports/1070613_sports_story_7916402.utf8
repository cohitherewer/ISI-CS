 No recognition for ICL

 Ravi Shastri and Sunil Gavaskar in New Delhi on Tuesday 

New Delhi: As expected, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has taken a dim view of the Zee-promoted Indian Cricket League. 

We havent given recognition to a tournament planned by the League, BCCI spokesman and treasurer N.Srinivasan informed the media on Tuesday. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, one of the office-bearers will speak to World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev, who is the chairman of the Leagues executive board. 

That has become necessary as Kapil is also chairman of the BCCI-run National Cricket Academy and most see a major conflict of interest. 

Apparently, the Baroda Cricket Association has been asked to have a dialogue with joint-secretary Kiran More, as hes on the Leagues board. 

The BCCI intends coming down with a heavy hand on anybody having anything to do with the League.

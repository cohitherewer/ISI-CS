 ICC to probe Samuels issue

 - We will act only after receiving a formal report, says West Indies Cricket Board spokesman 

New Delhi: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Thursday launched a probe into West Indies allrounder Marlon Samuels conversations with an Indian bookie during the India-West Indies ODI at Nagpur last month (January 21). 

A day after the sensational disclosure by Nagpur police that Samuels had been in touch with bookie Mukesh Kochchar, the ICC confirmed that it had received a report from the police and had directed its Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU) representative in India to carry out the investigations. 

The 26-year-old Samuels was accused of passing information on batting and bowling orders to Kochchar. 

We have received the report and the ACU representative in India has been directed to carry out the probe, an ICC source said from Dubai. If required, Samuels could be summoned for a cross-examination as part of the probe, he said. 

The games governing body clarified that it could only prepare a report on the incident, but it was up to the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) to take necessary action against the player if he is found guilty. 

The ICC can investigate and prepare a report, but it is up to the WICB to take action, the source added. 

If the charges are correct, Samuels risks being banned for a minimum of two years for violating the ICC Code of Conduct. 

On a day of high drama which saw the cricket fraternity reacting with shock to the development, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said it was ICCs responsibility to take appropriate action. 

The BCCI made it clear that no Indian player was involved. BCCI president Sharad Pawar said: Its the responsibility of the ICC. We have received a communication from the police commissioner of Nagpur and we have sent it immediately to the ICC headquarters in Dubai. It is now for them to take appropriate action. 

In Port of Spain, the WICB adopted a wait-and-watch policy, saying they were not going to act on rumour or gossip. 

WICB spokesman Tony Deyal said the board had not received any communication from either BCCI or ICC yet, and would act only after getting a formal report. 

We have not been officially contacted by the BCCI or ICC. However, we are not going to act on rumour or gossip and will not be panicked, particularly since we are talking about the career and future of a young cricketer of talent and promise, he was quoted as saying in media reports. 

Deyal, however, indicated that the board would not take things lightly if the claims by Nagpur police turn out to be true. We have zero tolerance policy on gambling and we strictly adhere to the ICC codes, he added.

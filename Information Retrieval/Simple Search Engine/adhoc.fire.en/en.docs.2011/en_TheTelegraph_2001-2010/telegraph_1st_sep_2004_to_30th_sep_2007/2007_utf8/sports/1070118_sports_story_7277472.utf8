The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Douglas issue may land Md. Sp. in a soup 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Douglas da Silva 

New Delhi: Mohammedan Sporting could land themselves in deep trouble on the issue of alleged non-payment to Douglas Da Silva, for which the Brazilian midfielder has already filed an official complaint with the Fifa. 

According to sources, Fifa, if convinced with Douglass petition, might even go to the extent of instructing the All India Football Federation (AIFF) of deducting Mohammedan Sportings points from the ongoing National Football League (NFL) tally unless the Calcutta club compensates the footballer accordingly. It could also demote Mohammedan Sporting to a lower division. 

In a similar case early this month, Fifa has threatened to deduct three NFL points of Churchill Brothers for non-payment to their Nigerian footballer John Kingsley. 

Fifa ordered Churchill to pay 5000 dollars to Kingsley. Since they delayed the payment, Fifa Resolution and Dispute Committee has now threatened to deduct three NFL points of Churchill. The Goan team is now trying to make a hurried payment to the distressed footballer, sources said. 

In his complaint, Douglas has mentioned that Mohammedan Sporting, who had signed a one-year contract with him, terminated the contract without assigning any proper reason. The footballer has sought compensation for the whole season from the Subhas Bhowmick-coached side.

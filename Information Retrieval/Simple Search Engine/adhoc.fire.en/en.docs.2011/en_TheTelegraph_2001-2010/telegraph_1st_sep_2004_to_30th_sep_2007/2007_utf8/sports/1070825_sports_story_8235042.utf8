 Tough task awaits Indians

New Delhi: India have their task cut out at the World Athletic Championships starting in Osaka on Saturday. The enormity of the task at hand can be gauged from the fact that long jumper Anju Bobby George has been Indias only medallist at the elite meet, when she won the bronze medal in Paris in 2003. The Keralite has been struggling to capture her form in the recent past. 

The 4x400m womens relay team will be the focus. Manjeet Kaur, Chitra Soman, Mandeep Kaur, Sini Jose, Anu Mariam Jose and Iyleen Samantha have given Indians much reason to cheer. 

They finished seventh at the Athens Olympics and followed that up with a silver medal at the Commonwealth Games, and then won silver and gold at the Doha Asian Games and the Asian Championships in Amman, respectively. (PTI)

 Terry, Malouda score in Chelsea win

 Stanford: 

 John Terry and Malouda scored late second-half goals, 

 leading Chelsea to a 2-1 win over Mexicos Club America 

 in the Disney Friendship Cup on Saturday night. Malouda, 

 who joined the Blues in a $27 million (euro 20 million) 

 transfer from French champion Lyon on Tuesday, got the equaliser 

 in the 76th minute, and Terry then headed home Maloudas 

 free kick for the winner seven minutes from time. Juan Carlos 

 Mosqueda scored in the third minute for America.

 Chelsea, meanwhile, and the entertainment 

 giant Walt Disney Co. have aligned themselves under a four-year 

 marketing and promotion deal, it was announced. The partnership 

 with Disneys Wide World of Sports was announced at 

 a news conference before Saturdays match.

 Mourinho makes peace with 

 Abramovich

 London: Jose Mourinho is 

 back on speaking terms with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich 

 and says he now feels so settled in London that he has bought 

 a house. Mourinho said that his injury-hit side spent much 

 of last season playing survival football but 

 hoped to be able to produce a more open game in their bid 

 to reclaim the Premier League title. We had a very 

 long meeting at Stamford Bridge last week that made everything 

 clear between us. There are no doubts. I know what he thinks, 

 I know what he feels, I know what he wants. I think its 

 better to have one very good and long meeting than 10 short 

 and bad, Mourinho said.

 Stuttgart deal with Zaragoza

 Berlin: Bundesliga champions 

 VfB Stuttgart said on Sunday that they would sign a loan 

 agreement with Real Zaragoza on Monday for Ewerthon, the 

 third top Brazilian player to join the German league in 

 three days. A VfB spokesman said Ewerthon, who played in 

 the Bundesliga for Borussia Dortmund from 2001 to 2005, 

 was expected to join the club for their pre-season training 

 in Austria on Monday.

 Werder Bremen sign Alberto

 Berlin: Werder Bremen said 

 on Saturday they had signed midfielder Carlos Alberto in 

 a euro 7.8 million transfer deal, the most expensive in 

 the German clubs history. He last played at Fluminense 

 in Brazil on loan from Corinthians. Alberto won the Champions 

 League in 2004 with Portuguese club Porto.

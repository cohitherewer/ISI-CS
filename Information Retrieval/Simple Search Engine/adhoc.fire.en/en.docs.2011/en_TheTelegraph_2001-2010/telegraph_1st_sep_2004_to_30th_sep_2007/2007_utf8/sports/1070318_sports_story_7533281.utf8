 It wasnt good cricket: Sobers

Basseterre: Watching the ball disappear over the boundary ropes six times in an over is an experience which breeds a philosophic acceptance of fate in the unfortunate bowler. 

Twenty-two years ago, former India captain Ravi Shastri deposited Tilak Raj for six sixes in an Indian domestic match, while the most famous example remains Sir Garfield Sobers six-in-a-row off Nash for Nottinghamshire against Glamorgan in 1968. 

Sobers was dismissive of a record he considers to have little enduring significance. It makes me feel that thats the only thing Ive done in the history of cricket, he said in an interview with a website. 

It wasnt really good cricket, six sixes are not good cricket... Its not the kind of cricket you want to teach youngsters. 

For left-arm mediumpacer Nash, it was just another day. 

I dont reflect on it ever as a bad thing, he told a newspaper. The moment is with Sobers and not much to do with me. 

Tilak Raj on Saturday sympathised with Daan van Bunge. It will feel bad, he said. I felt terrible back then. All I can say is that its destiny. (REUTERS)

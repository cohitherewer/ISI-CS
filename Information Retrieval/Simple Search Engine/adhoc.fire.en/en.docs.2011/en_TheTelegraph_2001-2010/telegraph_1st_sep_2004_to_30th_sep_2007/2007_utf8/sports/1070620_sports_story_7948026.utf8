 Harmison to undergo surgery

Durham: England fast bowler Steve Harmison is set to undergo a hernia operation, though the team management is yet to decide when he will have the surgery. 

The 28-year-old, who played in the fourth and final Test against the West Indies, was expected to turn out for county team Durham in a domestic Cup semi-final on Wednesday. 

The fast bowlers availability will now have to be confirmed by England medics. 

Steve Harmison has a non-serious hernia and he will require surgery at some stage, an England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) spokesman said on Tuesday. 

The injury is not currently affecting his bowling. 

The timing of the surgery will be decided by the England medical team. We havent pulled him out of the semi-final (yet). 

Harmison is likely to be operated on soon so that he does not miss much of the three-Test series against India which will begin at Lords on July 19.

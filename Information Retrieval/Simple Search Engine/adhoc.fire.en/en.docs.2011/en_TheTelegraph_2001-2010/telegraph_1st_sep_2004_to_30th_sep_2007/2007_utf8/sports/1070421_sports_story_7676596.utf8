St. Georges: Matthew Hayden hit 103 off 100 balls on Friday to lead Australia to a dominating 348 for six against New Zealand in the World Cup Super Eight match. 

Haydens century at Grenada National Stadium was the highlight of a powerful batting display that backed up, once more, Australias status as the overwhelming tournament favourite. 

Australia won the toss and batted aggressively despite both teams already having reached the semi-finals and New Zealand supposedly being one of the leading contenders for the title. 

Ricky Ponting hit 66 and Shane Watson 65 off 32 balls as the only unbeaten team in the competition set an imposing target for the Black Caps. 

However, tight bowling after Hayden fell and intelligent changes by New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming kept the target to a difficult rather than impossible one after Australia had looked on course to get close to 400. 

New Zealand successfully chased more than 300 twice in winning a one-day series against Australia in February reaching two of the three biggest winning totals by a team batting second. 

Missing fast bowler Shane Bond because of a stomach complaint and Jacob Oram with a bruised heel, New Zealand initially struggled to make an impact on the Australia top order. 

Bond, who has taken 12 wickets at the tournament, did not travel to the stadium and was treated by doctors after vomiting Thursday night. 

New Zealand team spokesman John Durning stressed that Bonds withdrawal was for medical reasons and not to rest him or hold him back for the later stages. Sri Lanka rested their first-choice bowling attack against Australia on Monday and was beaten by seven wickets. 

The only wicket to fall in the first 22 overs came in the second, when Adam Gilchrist miscued James Franklins loosener to Mark Gillespie for one. That brought Ponting to the crease and he and Hayden brought up a 100 partnership in 98 balls. Fleming switched his bowlers around continually, bringing off-spinner Jeetan Patel on as early as the fifth over. 

Hayden brought up his 50 from 53 balls in the 17th over, and Ponting got to his a few balls later. Ponting also took 53 balls, with seven fours in his 62nd one-day half century. 

Craig McMillan came on as the seventh bowler in the first 22 overs but Ponting and Hayden, who had cut back with the big boundaries, kept picking up easy singles and twos. 

Ponting had looked untroubled until he hit Patel to midwicket, where Ross Taylor jumped to take a catch. 

Michael Clarke came in and Fleming took his second powerplay immediately. But Clarke hit three fours in taking 14 off one over by Gillespie. 

Daniel Vettori came back into the attack and Hayden hit him for three fours in a row and then Scott Styris for a huge six that brought up the 50 partnership in 35 balls. 

Australia got to 200 from 185 balls and Hayden brought up his 10th one-day century in the next over. He had taken 97 balls, and hit 10 fours and two sixes. 

He was eventually out when Styris ran back to long on to take a catch from his own bowling. 

Clarke was then out for 49 when he, bizarrely, left a slow ball by Franklin, only to watch it knock down his middle stump. That made it 233 for four and it was 257 for five when Mason caught Andrew Symonds off Patel at long off for 11. Patel finished with an excellent two for 48 off his 10 overs. 

Mike Hussey and Watson shared a 77-run stand for the sixth wicket, with Hussey hitting a tournament-best 37 before falling in the final over. Watson, who struck four fours and four sixes, bludgeoned 24 off the 48th over by Gillespie.

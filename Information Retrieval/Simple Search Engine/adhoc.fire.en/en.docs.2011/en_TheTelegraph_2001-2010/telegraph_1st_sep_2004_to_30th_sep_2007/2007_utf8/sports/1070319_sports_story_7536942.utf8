 Jaffers feat

New Delhi: Wasim Jaffers record-breaking unbeaten 170 helped Mumbai notch up a comfortable six-wicket win over Delhi and move into the semi-finals of national one-dayers knockout meet Sunday. 

Chasing 298, the opening stand of 171 runs between Jaffer and Ajinkya Rahane (61) laid the victory foundation. 

Jaffers knock is the highest ever individual score in Indian domestic limited over cricket. He also went past the previous highest score made by a Mumbai batsman 149 by Vinod Kambli against Baroda in 2001. Jaffer eclipsed Rajasthan batsman Gagan Khodas 166 not out scored against Railways in Jaipur last year.

 My best is yet to come: Sreesanth

Kochi: One of the few successes on Indias disastrous tour of South Africa, Sreesanth says that his best is yet to come. 

The 23-year-old Kerala paceman began as a leg-spinner and has now emerged as a spearhead of the Indian pace attack. But he has more plans improving his batting and becoming an allrounder. 

My best is yet to come. I hope I would be able to live upto the expectations of the people. I need everyones blessings, he said here. 

The Kerala bowler acknowledges that every outing in India colours has helped him mature as a bowler. My goal is to see India win. We want to win each and every game, he said. 

Sreesanth is aware that only a consistent performance will help him cement his place in the national team. 

If I do well I will be in the team and if I dont do well, I will be out, I am sure about it. I am ready for setbacks. I am always realistic. I am not in a dream world.

 India to play in Kazakhstan 

New Delhi: India face a tricky relegation play-off in the Davis Cup, an away tie to Kazakhstan in the Asia-Oceania Group 1 from April 6-8. 

The two teams will be meeting for the first time and the venue was decided by the toss of the coin. The hosts have yet to decide on the choice of surface. 

India are fighting to stay in Group 1 after they were thrashed 1-4 by Uzbekistan in an away first round tie past weekend. A defeat will still give the Indians another chance but the second play-off will pit them against either China or Chinese Taipei both formidable opponents. (PTI)

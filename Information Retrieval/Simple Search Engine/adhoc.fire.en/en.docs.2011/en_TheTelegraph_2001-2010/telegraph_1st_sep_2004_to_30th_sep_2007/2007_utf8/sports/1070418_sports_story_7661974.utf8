The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Easy for India

Christchurch: Tara Iyer and Ankita Bhambri blanked their respective opponents as India came up with yet another clinical performance to thrash Jordan 3-0 in their second rubber of the Fed Cup Asia-Oceania zone qualifiers here on Tuesday. 

The Indian team dropped just one game in their three matches on Tuesday as they outplayed their pool B rivals to register their second win following their victory over Kazakhstan. Tara started the proceedings for India and stormed past Sahar al Disi in the first match. 

The 18-year-olds 6-0, 6-0 win set the pace for the Indians, who were simply unstoppable after that with Ankita also scoring a 6-0, 6-0 win over Leen Irani in the next match. 

Sunitha Rao and Shikha Uberoi then made it a second successive 3-0 win for the Indians as they overpowered Al Daisi and Irani 6-1, 6-0 in the doubles competition. 

Team captain Enrico Piperno, though happy with the performance, said the real competition starts only now as India take on hosts New Zealand on Wednesday. 

Its a tough one. They are a very strong team and we are anticipating tough matches, Piperno said. 

Luckily it did not rain today so we could practice, unlike the day before the Jordan tie when we could not practice because of the weather, he added. 

The captain said the real threat was from Chinese Taipei, against whom the Indians will play their final pool B encounter. (PTI)

 Anand stays in joint lead

 Anand 

Mexico City: Top seed Viswanathan Anand survived a few anxious moments before settling for a draw with arch-rival and defending champion Vladimir Kramnik of Russia in the third round of the World Chess Championship. 

Anand inched himself up to 2 points from two games and continued to lead the table along with Kramnik. 

Russian Alexander Morozevich scalped countryman Peter Svidler, while other games of the third round were drawn. 

Alexander Grischuk from Russia signed peace with Levon Aronian of Armenia and Hungarian Peter Leko reached the same result against Boris Gelfand of Israel. 

With 11 rounds still to come in this eight-player double round robin event, Morozevich, Gelfand, Grischuk and Leko share third place on 1.5 points each while Aronian and Svidler are bottom with one point each. 

For the second time in three days Anand faced the Petroff defence. In the first round, Gelfand had played the same opening against the Indian and had got an easy half point. 

Anand played the opening nonchalantly but was in trouble after the queens got traded as one of his far advanced pawn came under mortal danger. Kramnik pocketed the pawn and transposed to a rook and pawns endgame which needed precise defence from Anand. 

Having lost similar endgames a few years back, Anands homework came to the fore as he went on finding the best defence especially after blacks 33rd move. The final position was a stalemate after 65 moves. Morozevich outplayed Svidler from an innocuous looking scotch opening. 

After attaining a comfortable position in the middle game, Svidler underestimated whites attacking potential on the queen side and paid heavy dividends. The game lasted 37 moves. 

The longest game of the championship so far was played between Leko and Gelfand who fought on for 100 moves before splitting the point from another Petroff of the day. (PTI)

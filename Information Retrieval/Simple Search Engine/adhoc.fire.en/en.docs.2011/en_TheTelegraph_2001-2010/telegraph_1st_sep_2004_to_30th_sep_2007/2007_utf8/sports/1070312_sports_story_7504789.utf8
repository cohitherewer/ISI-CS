 Title for Lin Dan 

Birmingham: Top seed Lin Dan of China blazed to his third All England singles title in four years on Sunday with a 21-13, 21-12 victory over sixth-seeded compatriot Chen Yu. 

Lin played supremely well before a full house at the National Indoor Arena and was rarely in trouble. His head-to-head record with Chen now reads 5-0. 

The womens doubles went to third seeds Wei Yili and Zhang Yawen who outlasted second-seeded fellow Chinese Yang Wei and Zhang Jiewen 21-16, 8-21, 24-22. (Reuters)

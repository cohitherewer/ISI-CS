 Nielsen theory

Melbourne: In order to maintain a balance in the players lives during the gruelling season ahead, new Australian coach Tim Nielsen advocates taking the cricketers to places of historic significance. 

Nielsen thinks maintaining fitness and freshness of mind of the players is the biggest challenge during the next 18 months when Australia play Sri Lanka, India, New Zealand, Pakistan and West Indies in various series. 

Apart from hiring sports science experts to monitor players workload, Nielsen is determined to keep their minds fresh. 

We have got professional athletes now who arent working, they are cricketers, Nielsen was quoted as saying in a newspaper Wednesday. If we are not careful, their life experiences can be quite narrow, so its a real opportunity for us to take them to different places. 

Were lucky enough to travel around the world, see different things that the regular Joe may not. If that opportunity arises, we will grab it and try and instil some real pride in being Australian he added.

 Murray out of French Open

TELEGRAPH ONLINE

Andy Murray has been ruled out of the French Open, according to his coach Brad Gilbert. 

British No. 1 Murray suffered an injury to his right wrist during his first-round match against Filippo Volandri in Hamburg on Tuesday and was forced to retire. 

The injury left Murrays hopes of appearing at the Roland Garros and at this years Wimbledon in doubt, but coach Gilbert feels the 20-year-old has no chance of recovering in time for the French Open. 

The years second Grand Slam begins in eight days time, but rather than compete in Paris, Murray will focus on ensuring he is in peak condition for the grass-court season. 

His next tournament is due to be the Artois Championships in London, starting on June 11.

 Caution the watchword

 - Bolstered by fresh blood, india open twenty20 campaign today 

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni 

Durban: India will launch their campaign in the ICC World Twenty20 with a group D match against minnows Scotland here on Thursday, hoping to fine tune their skills and strategies for the tougher games ahead. 

The Indians have virtually no experience in this slam-bang version of the game, having played just one match before. It remains to be seen how quickly the team adapts to the requirements. 

With the long tour of Ireland and England ending just a few days back, the Indian squad, under a new captain in dashing Mahendra Singh Dhoni, hardly had time to settle down and get to know the nuances of this format or acclimatise to the conditions. 

But they will be bolstered by some fresh blood in Virender Sehwag, Irfan Pathan and Harbhajan Singh, all of who would look to use this opportunity and make a return to the national side. 

The first task for the Indians will be to get their playing combination right and get used to the bouncy track and the strong wind. It is important for them to hit form early as they square up against traditional rivals Pakistan the following day at the same venue. 

Having arrived just 48 hours back from a long tour, the Indians have had little time to get their strategy in place. And yet, their biggest headache remains in picking their best XI. 

Among the certainties, however, Sehwag should be opening with Robin Uthappa with Yuvraj Singh coming in at No.3 or 4 if the team sticks to Gautam Gambhir at No.3. Dhoni himself can be in at No.5 or even higher depending upon the situation. 

Among others, Irfan, Yousuf and Joginder Sharma can be useful allrounders. With Irfan and R.P. Singh almost certainties, the choice would be between Sreesanth and Agarkar for the third pacer. Similarly, with Sehwag being a useful off-spinner, it remains to be seen whether Harbhajan makes it to the playing XI.

India (from): Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain), Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, Robin Uthappa, Gautam Gambhir, Dinesh Karthik, Joginder Sharma, Rohit Sharma, Irfan Pathan, Yousuf Pathan, Piyush Chawla, Harbhajan Singh, Ajit Agarkar, R.P. Singh, Sreesanth.

 Imran to sue Sarfraz

 Sarfraz is a liar, says Imran 

Karachi: Fed up with Sarfraz Nawazs defaming allegations, former Pakistan captain Imran Khan on Wednesday promised to take legal action against his ex-teammate. 

This man (Sarfraz) thinks he can say anything against anyone and get away because people dont like to associate themselves with someone of his calibre and low character. But this time he has said enough 

I am going to file a defamation suit against him for damages or else let him prove the allegations in court, Imran said on a radio channel. 

Imran and Sarfraz formed one of Pakistans most lethal attacks in the late 1970s and early 80s, and the former has credited his teammate for making him a world class bowler. 

But the two fell out in recent years, one reason being Sarfraz making loud statements and serious allegations against anyone under the sun. 

In his latest outburst, he said on a television channel that Imran had demanded money from former Pakistan player Younis Ahmed to play him on a tour and after he didnt pay the full amount, was sent home. 

Sarfraz has claimed that he was witness to the deal between Imran and Younis. He has also claimed that Imran used to take hashish regularly and had bowdy sex romps as a Pakistan team member. 

This man is totally characterless and a big liar. I dont want to get down to his level, but the fact is no one was willing to even share a room with him on tours. 

Everyone knows the way he treated his poor late wife Rani and tried to grab her property while she was on her deathbed, Imran said. 

Sarfraz is a disgusting, dirty low character and a liar. Ask anyone. But this time I am not going to spare him he will have to go to court to prove his allegations, he added. 

Imran also said that someone should ask Sarfraz how he sustains himself at present. 

Everyone knows that for a price you can get him to say anything. Now by coming out with these lies against me, he is trying to please his masters in the ruling party and get a post in the coming elections, Imran insisted. 

Sarfraz recently said that Bob Woolmer was murdered by a match-fixing mafia and the players should be investigated for their involvement in the coachs death.

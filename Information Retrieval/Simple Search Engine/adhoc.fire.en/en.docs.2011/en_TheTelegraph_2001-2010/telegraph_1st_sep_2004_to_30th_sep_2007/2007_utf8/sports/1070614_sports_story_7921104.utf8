 Mittal eyes Birmingham

 Mittal 

Indian-born billionaire Lakshmi Mittal who is twice as rich as Roman Abramovich has emerged as a contender to buy Premiership club Birmingham. 

The steel magnate, who is worth 19.25 billion, has made an inquiry about the possibility of taking over the Midlands club from David Sullivan and David and Ralph Gold. 

Mittal has not so far followed up his initial interest in Birmingham who have become a more attractive commodity following their return to the Premiership. 

City are already the subject of interest from a mystery Far East businessman who is planning to make a formal bid later in the week if auditors are satisfied after going through the clubs books. But 56-year-old Mittal, who last year bought Arcelor, the worlds second biggest steel-maker for 17.8 billion, is keeping a close watch. 

Mittal is the fifth richest man in the world and Birmingham could be transformed into a major power if he took control.

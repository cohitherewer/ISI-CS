 Sania eyes back-to-back doubles titles

New Delhi: Top seeded Sania Mirza is eyeing her second WTA doubles title in as many weeks by reaching the final of $200,000 Istanbul Cup Friday. 

Sania and her new partner Yung-Jan Chan of Taipei overcame stiff resistance from Mervana Jugic-Salkic of Bosnia and Italian Romina Oprandi to win 6-7 (3-7), 6-0, 10-5. 

Sania and Yung-Jan were leading 5-1 in the opening set after breaking their opponents in the first game of the semi-final, but squandered the advantage by allowing Mervana and Romina to rally back to level scores 5-5 and stretch the game into the tie-breaker. 

But it was a completely different story in the second set, which Sania and Yung-Jan dominated to take the match into super tie-breaker and seal it in their favour. 

Sania won her fourth WTA Tour doubles title at the Morocco Open in Fes, partnering Vania King of America last week.

 Gunners up to third spot

London: Arsenal climbed to third spot with a 3-1 home victory over Manchester City in a Premier League match on Wednesday. 

Gunners ground out victory in the closing stages at the Emirates Stadium. Czech midfielder Tomas Rosicky gave them a 12th-minute lead but American midfielder DaMarcus Beasley levelled for City against the run of play before the break. 

Spain midfielder Cesc Fabregas, who got Arsenals winner on Saturday against Bolton Wanderers, restored the advantage with a 73rd-minute volley before Brazilian Julio Baptista netted after good work by Belarus midfielder Alexander Hleb. 

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger felt Fabregas strike was the turning point. That changed it because straight away City changed their shape and opened up more, he said. Then we had many chances to score the third. 

Manchester United are on 81 points from 33 games while champions Chelsea have 75 from 32. Arsenal have 62 from 34 matches, one point ahead of Liverpool who host Middlesbrough on Wednesday. 

On Tuesday, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was fined 2,500 ($4,978) by the FA on Tuesday and warned about his future conduct at a disciplinary hearing (as reported in Wednesdays CM edition). 

Wenger had admitted a charge of improper conduct for his words and behaviour towards referee Steve Bennett and his linesmen at halftime during the Premier League match with Portsmouth on December 16. 

The match ended in a 2-2 draw. They conceded the first goal just before the interval when Bennett awarded the visitors a free-kick that led to Noe Pamarot putting Pompey ahead. Wenger said he believed the free-kick should have been awarded to Arsenal.

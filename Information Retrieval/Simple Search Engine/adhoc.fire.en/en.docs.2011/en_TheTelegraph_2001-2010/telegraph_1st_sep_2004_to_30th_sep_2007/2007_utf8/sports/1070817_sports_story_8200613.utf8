 Inzy to replace Younis Khan

Karachi: Inzamam-ul Haq is to make his English county championship debut for Yorkshire later this month. The former Pakistan captain has been called up as a replacement for compatriot Younis Khan, who will be on international duty. 

I was offered a short term contract by Yorkshire and I have accepted it because I have never experienced playing for a county, the batsman said on Thursday. 

Inzamam said he would be flying out to England next week to replace Younis, who is returning home to join up with the ICC World Twenty20 squad. 

I see my stint with Yorkshire as a good opportunity to get ready for a hectic international season for Pakistan, Inzamam added. 

The 37-year-old stepped down as captain and retired from one-day Internationals in March after his team was eliminated in the first round of the World Cup in the West Indies. However, the player said he was keen to continue playing Test for his country and was also considering an offer from the lucrative Indian Cricket League (ICL). 

He is expected to feature in three four-day matches and as many one-day matches while in England. 

Inzamam has played 119 Tests and 378 ODIs. 

On Thursday, Farhat asked the PCB to terminate his contract.

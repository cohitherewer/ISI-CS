Bridgetown: South Africa raced into the World Cup semi-finals crushing England by nine wickets on Tuesday. Graeme Smith smashed an unbeaten 89 in 58 balls as the Proteas reached 157 for two in 19.2 overs to give them the final last-four berth. 

England, who had to win on Tuesday to stay in contention, had no chance after being dismissed for 154. 

Andrew Hall took five for 18 and Andre Nel three for 35 as England were bowled out in 48 overs. 

South Africa thus joined Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka in the semis. 

Halls intelligent seam bowling prompted a middle-order batting collapse, with five English wickets going for just 10 runs. 

England captain Michael Vaughan won the toss and opted to bat first on a wicket that has proven lively in the morning sessions, hoping to take advantage of the quicker pace on the track. 

But Vaughan, opening with Ian Bell, made a slow start with the first run not coming until the 14th ball and England only managing five runs off the first five overs. 

Shaun Pollock and Charl Langeveldt kept England pegged back and Langeveldt then claimed the wicket of a frustrated Bell who skied an attempted pull shot to Ashwell Prince. 

The impressive Nel then trapped Vaughan leg before for 17 to leave England at 37 for two in the 13th over. The pressure was on Englands South African-born batsman Kevin Pietersen who faced some hostility from Nel. It was not long before the seamer had his victim with Pietersen (3) spooning a catch to mid-off. 

Another South African-born batsman, Andrew Strauss, got his head down with Paul Collingwood showing some patience and discipline as England looked to consolidate. 

The pair produced Englands best partnership by putting on 58 before Strauss went for 46, flashing at Jacques Kallis outside off stump; captain Graeme Smith snaffled up an easy catch at gully. 

Collingwood followed for 30, lbw to Hall who then dealt with Englands last real threat, Andrew Flintoff, removing the allrounders middle stump with a ball that cut back off the seam and through a huge gap between bat and pad. 

Hall then took Paul Nixon and Sajid Mahmood with successive deliveries and only an unbeaten cameo of 27 from Ravi Bopara gave Englands attack something to bowl at. Hall picked up his fifth wicket with his final ball, dismissing James Anderson. (Reuters)

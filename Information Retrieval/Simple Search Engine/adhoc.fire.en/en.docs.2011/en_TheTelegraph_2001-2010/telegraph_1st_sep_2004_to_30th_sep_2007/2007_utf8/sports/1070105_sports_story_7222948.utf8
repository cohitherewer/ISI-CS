The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dhoni advised 10 days rest

 - The disappointment is on many counts, says Team Indias No.1 keeper 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Cape Town: Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who missed the ongoing third and final Test owing to an injury to his right middle finger, has only been advised rest. 

Ive got to take a break for ten days... Thats it, he told The Telegraph in the breakfast room at the Southern Sun Cullinan on Thursday. 

Dhoni, of course, is very disappointed he has had to sit out for the first time since his Test debut in Chennai 13 months ago. 

The disappointment is on many counts... Missing a Test and, then, having to sit out on a flat wicket when my batting had begun to come good... Im consoling myself that injuries happen in sport, he said. 

Dhoni wouldnt have had a problem batting but couldve let the team down in the keeping department. I couldnt take the field without being one hundred per cent fit... I had to be honest... 

Not too long ago, the talismanic Kapil Dev pointed out that Dhoni had what it takes to be a captain. One quality, obviously, is being truthful and keeping the team ahead of everything else. 

Dhoni wont be found wanting there.

 Appointment surprises Pakistan

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has been taken by surprise by the announcement that controversial Australian umpire Darrell Hair would stand in a three-nation series in Kenya next week. 

We have read with interest the appointment of Hair. We have also read the ICC explanation that he has been named since it is an Associate Members tournament involving Scotland, Kenya and Canada and not an international event, a PCB official said. 

We are going to discuss this at our meeting in Islamabad tomorrow and will then decide our next line of action. But our initial reaction is one of surprise certainly, he said. 

Hair was suspended from officiating in international matches in November last year after Pakistan filed a complaint during the forfeited Oval Test. The fact is that when the board took a decision, ICC president Percy Sonn had clearly stated that the apex body had lost confidence in Hairs umpiring abilities. 

(Hence) it seems strange that he is being given an assignment even for an Associate Members tournament, the official said. (PTI)

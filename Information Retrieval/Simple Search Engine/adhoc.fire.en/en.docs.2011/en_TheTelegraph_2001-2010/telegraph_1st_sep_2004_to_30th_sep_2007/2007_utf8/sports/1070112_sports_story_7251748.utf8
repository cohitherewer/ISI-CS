 Beckham to leave Real for US club

London: David Beckham will leave Real Madrid at the end of the season to join the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer in a five-year deal. 

The move was announced on Thursday following the end of talks on extending the 31-year-old contract with the Spanish club. This week, Real Madrid asked me to make a decision regarding my future and the offer to extend my contract by a further two seasons, Beckham said in a statement. 

After discussing several options with my family and advisers to either stay here at Madrid or join other major British and European clubs, I have decided to join the Los Angeles Galaxy and play in the MLS from August this year. 

Beckhams four-year contract with Madrid expires at the end of this season. I have enjoyed my time in Spain enormously and I am extremely grateful to the club for giving me the opportunity to play for such a great team, he said. (AP)

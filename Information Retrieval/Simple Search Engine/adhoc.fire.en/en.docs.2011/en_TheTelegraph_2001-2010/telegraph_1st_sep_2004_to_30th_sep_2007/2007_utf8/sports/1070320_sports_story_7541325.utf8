The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bermudas motley crew makes merry

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Port of Spain: Five students, three teachers, a computer analyst, a policeman, a telephone technician, a chartered accountant, a maintenance manager with one of the corporate houses, a middle distance runner who also works in one the power companies and a lone professional cricketer in David Hemp. That, in short, is the Bermuda players CV. 

Cricket in Bermuda still enjoys an amateur status with matches being held only on weekends. Says manager Clarence Tannock, I wouldnt say it is a pastime for the players. The passion is there but the means are limited. Once the International Cricket Council (ICC) approves our ground we hope to enthuse more youngsters to the game. 

The Premier and First divisions comprise the league in the country with eight and six teams participating, respectively. They have been regular participants in the ICC Trophy but have never won it. They reached the semi-finals in 2005 and secured one of the qualifying places. 

They also achieved elevation to the ICCs top tier of associate members around that time, meaning a place in the first-class Intercontinental Cup and Division One of the new World Cricket League. 

The only positives for Bermuda have been the discovery of David Hemp, the 36-year-old Glamorgan captain who was born in capital Hamilton where his English parents worked, and the appointment of Gus Logie as the coach. 

Playing in the World Cup has been our first step towards achieving a professional set up. We now aim to achieve more out of the ICCs development programs, says Tannock. 

Because of the American influence, soccer and baseball remain the chief attractions for the younger generation. Captain Irvine Romaine along with wicketkeeper Dean Minors has represented the country in soccer as well. 

One Bermudan player who has caught the imagination of the fans with a 19-stone frame is 35-year-old left-arm spinner Dwayne Leverock. Known as Sluggo, he has been a cop for the last 20 years. 

Says Romaine, Remember we are amateur athletes. If we were professionals, we would have dieticians and stuff like that. The only thing he has to worry about is finding criminals every day. The only time we play cricket maybe Saturdays, maybe Sundays, from 4 to 6 pm, after work. 

You cant expect the guy to lose a lot of weight. He has been working like a professional athlete only in the last one month. I dont think he could have lost any big weight in such short time, explained the Bermudan captain.

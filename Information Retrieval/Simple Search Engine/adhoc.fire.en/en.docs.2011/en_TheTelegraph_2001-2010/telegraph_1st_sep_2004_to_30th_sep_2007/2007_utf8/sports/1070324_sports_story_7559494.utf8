The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We no more encourage pacers

 - Taylor apart, there is no quality fast bowler in our squad, says Larry Gomes 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Port of Spain: Hilary Angelo Gomes, commonly known as Larry Gomes, was an elegant left-hander in Clive Lloyds team who excelled in times of strife. He was the slim, calm figure of reason among the mayhem created by the massive strokemakers. 

Settled in Toronto, he is now in charge of the US Under-19 side. The 53-year-old, who played 60 Tests and 83 one-dayers for the West Indies, spoke to The Telegraph on Thursday evening is in his hometown. 

The following are excerpts 

On how he views the changes that have taken place in the game 

There have been several rule changes since I quit. The game is more spectator-driven these days. The players have to meet the demands of the paying public. There are more commercial demands and you have to accept that. The introduction of Twenty20 cricket hasnt been very good for the game. It affects your technique and leads to bad habits. Because of the proliferation of one-day games, players tend to be more attacking You see Test matches finishing in three/four days. The players are struggling to adjust to both forms. That was never the case during our playing days. 

On whether he thinks West Indies cricket is coming out of the slump 

I would say they are not doing too badly. Cricket is all about confidence. There are a few talented players but the bowling is weak. That is the reason why they struggle in Test matches. Apart from Jerome Taylor there is no quality fast bowler. Hence it is proving to be difficult to dismiss a side twice in Tests. There is no proper planning and players tend to take things for granted. Its not easy to produce an Andy Roberts or a Joel Garner. Moreover the pitches no longer suit fast bowling and are a lot slower. We no more encourage fast bowlers. 

On whether Brian Laras quitting one-dayers will create a vacuum 

Theres no doubt it will be a big blow. It will create a big gap. The younger players will have to fill in the gap. Luckily, most of the players in the current side are fairly young. Clive Lloyd mentioned it the other day that one of the problems affecting our cricket is that the players arent professional enough. We used to play a lot of County cricket and that helped us a lot. Today players hardly get the time to play for Counties because of international commitments. 

On Laras captaincy 

Brian has been very innovative. He always tries to be different, not trying to do things in the traditional way. He has been unfortunate to work with this team. Had he been born earlier, he would have been more successful. 

On Michael Holdings observation that Windies cricketers arent focused enough 

Its true that players have not got their priorities right. The passion, love and pride for the country is not the same when compared to our times. Weve got to try and change that. Today players earn a lot from endorsements. They live in a new world. Im happy for them. We were probably born in the wrong time. 

On whether he feels Lloyds men could match the current Australians 

It would have been a good contest. My vote would be with Clives team because on paper the Australian attack may be more balanced because of Shane Warne, but we had four fearsome fast bowlers. It was never easy to face them. If you managed to tackle the opening two, there were two others waiting ready to come back at you with full vigour. We had top class batsmen too. A Gordon Greenidge or a Vivian Richards was capable of murdering any attack. I always liked playing against the Aussies because of their toughness. 

On whether he rates a Steve Waugh or a Ricky Ponting ahead of Lloyd 

To me, Clive will remain the best. The players always looked up to him. He was a father figure. Since we all played County cricket, there was tremendous rapport between us. We were unbeatable because of our overall superiority. I think anybody else would also have been equally successful with that side. As for Ponting, record speaks for him. Remember, winning is contagious. Steve was decent and the circumstances helped him. 

On the benefits for West Indies cricket from this World Cup 

There has been a lot of infrastructural development. New stadiums have come up while the old ones have been renovated. Hopefully, they will not be under-utilised. We will have more international matches. The younger generation should be attracted to the game. There is lot more money in the game today. Todays players make a better living. 

Finally if the memories of the 1983 World Cup final still hurt 

(Laughs) Long time yeah, were very disappointed But some things change with time. All credit to India. Looking back I feel we were a bit complacent on that day and it led to the defeat.

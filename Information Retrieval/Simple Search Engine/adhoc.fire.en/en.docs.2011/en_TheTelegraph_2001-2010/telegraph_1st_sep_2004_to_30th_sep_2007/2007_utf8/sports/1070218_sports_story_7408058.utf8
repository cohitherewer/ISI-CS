Calcutta: A goalless draw is frustrating. But the frustration is more when a top-rung team play out the entire regulation time against a bottom-rung team without making any inroads. 

At the Barasat Stadium, on Saturday, that came to fore. Consider the equaion: Defending champions Mahindra United were at the second spot with seven points while their fifth round opponents in the 11th ONGC National Football League, Mohammedan Sporting were lying low with four points in the table before this match. 

The equation hardly mattered though, as the city club Mohammedan Sporting, spurred on by some good saves by the Man-of-the-Match goalkeeper Gopal Das, held their fancied Mumbai rivals to a goalless draw. If the first-half saw few chances created but all missed by Mahindra United, in the second-half Mohammedan Sporting were a notch better, displaying some good skill and defence. 

If Das was a happy man, it was perhaps just the opposite in the rival camp with Pomeyie A Mensah must be cursing himself for having missed as many chances. But Mensah himself was not to be blamed; captain Yusif Yakubu, failing to capitalise, too messed it up on a couple of occasions. 

It all began in the 32nd minute when K. Ajayans sharp left-footer was deflected by an alert Das. Moving towards right, the Mohammedan custodian pouched the shot, which though did not appear convincing. Four minutes later, Mensahs clean pass saw Yakubu surge ahead. But the captains royal miss, in a porous Mohammedan defence, cost Mahindra two vital points. Yakubus hit missed just kissed the goalpost before going outside the field. 

Two minutes later, it was Mensahs turn to falter on Yakubus set up. But, what the Derrick Pereira boys would really be ruing is the flounder just on the edge of half time. It was Mensah again, though the credit should be given to Gopal who held his nerves to guard the net. 

Mohammedan Sporting seemed to be a revived bunch in the second-half as they hardly give any chance to their Mumbai rivals. But they created a chance, though it was missed by their newly-recruited Ndem Guy Herve whose shot went above the horizontal bar. 

Meanwhile: For all the frustration at the Barasat Stadium, Sourav Gangulys fireworks (at Vizag), seen live on TV, came a relief. In fact, very few were interested in the dragging draw rather than being inquisitive about Dadas score

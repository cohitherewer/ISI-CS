 Title for Boca

Porto Alegre (Brazil): Juan Roman Riquelme scored a pair of second-half goals and Boca Juniors defeated Gremio 2-0 to win their sixth Copa Libertadores title on Wednesday. 

Riquelme, playing his farewell match with the Argentine club, scored with a well-placed shot from outside the area to give Boca their fourth title in seven years. 

He added another in the 80th minute. 

The Argentine club won the first leg 3-0 last week in Buenos Aires. (AP)

 Sydney trip adds to Beckham workload

David Beckham has had his already prospective heavy schedule increased after his new club Los Angeles Galaxy agreed to a one-off friendly against Australian A-League side Sydney FC later this year. 

Beckham faces a hectic workload trying to combine his international career with his new challenge in Major League Soccer after leaving Real Madrid last month. 

That workload has since increased with the announcement of a further match to be played in Australia in November, coming just six days after England play Croatia in their final Euro 2008 at Wembley. 

The Football Federation Australia (FFA) have guaranteed the England midfielder, who will officially join the LA Galaxy on July 13, will play the match at Sydneys Telstra Stadium on November 27.

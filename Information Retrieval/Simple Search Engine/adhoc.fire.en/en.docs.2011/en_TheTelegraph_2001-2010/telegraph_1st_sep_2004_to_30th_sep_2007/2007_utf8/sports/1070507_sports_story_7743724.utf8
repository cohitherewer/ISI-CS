The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its nice that theres pressure to perform 

 - Fans will miss Sachin and Sourav, says Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Habibul Bashar and teammate Mohammed Rafique share a happy moment at the World Cup 

Dhaka: For a change, theres pressure on Habibul Bashar and Bangladesh, but the captain isnt perturbed. 

Its nice that theres the pressure to perform, instead of just turning up in a series or tournament to complete numbers... Im not at all unhappy about this, he told The Telegraph. 

Interacting on Sunday evening, after a practice match, Bashar added: Everybody knows we defeated India in the World Cup, but we realise the Indians are formidable and will be wanting to hit back hard... As the expectations are now high, Ive been asking my players to remain calm... 

According to the captain, having made the Super Eight of the World Cup hasnt only lifted confidence. Today, were more concerned about playing good cricket, instead of worrying about facing a particular team... The apprehension isnt there... This change is our biggest gain (from the World Cup). 

Besides shocking India in the group stage, Bangladesh stunned South Africa in the next round. 

Bashar, incidentally, remarked that Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Gangulys absence during the three ODIs would be felt by the fans. Sourav has such an unbelievably huge following... As for Sachin, hes admired by everybody who plays or follows the game... 

Sachin and Sourav are going to be around during the two-Test series, though. 

While the ODIs (not one is a day-night match) get underway on Thursday, the Tests will be played between May 18-29. Roshan Mahanama is the Match Referee.

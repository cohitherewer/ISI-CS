 Inzamam still in frame

Karachi: Pakistani selectors have offered a new lease of life to former captain Inzamam-ul Haqs career, saying that they will consider him for the Test series against South Africa, provided he is fit enough. 

I dont know why people have any doubt over our intention to consider Inzamam for the Test series. He himself is keen to play in this level of cricket and if he is fit and in form he will be a leading contender, chief selector Salahuddin Ahmed said on Tuesday. 

The selectors have announced a week-long fitness camp for some players prior to the ICC World Twenty20 in the first week of September. 

Inzamam, who retired from one-day Internationals and stepped down from the captaincy during the World Cup, has reacted sharply to doubts cast on his fitness. 

I have played cricket for all these years because I was fit. I have maintained before that if I am destined to play Test cricket no one can stop me, he added. The fitness camp is likely to be held under the supervision of new coach, Australian Geoff Lawson. 

In a separate development, the PCB also said that the compensation paid to pacers Umar Gul and Mohammed Asif for not accepting English county contracts was a one-off instance and will not become a long-term policy.

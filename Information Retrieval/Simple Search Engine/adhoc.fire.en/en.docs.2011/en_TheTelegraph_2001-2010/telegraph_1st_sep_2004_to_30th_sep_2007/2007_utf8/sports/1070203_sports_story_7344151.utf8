 Woods always in search of perfection

Dubai: Tiger Woods may have strung together a remarkable sequence of nine victories in 12 starts but the world No. 1 is constantly striving for perfection. 

Woods took part in a golf clinic with fellow American Mark Meara after the first round of the Dubai Desert Classic and sought out his close friend for a few swing tips. 

I asked him what he saw, Woods told reporters after a flawless five-under 67 left him five strokes off the pace on nine-under 135 midway through Fridays second round at the Emirates Golf Club. 

I told him I felt I was standing too much back on my heels which has always been a tendency of mine...to get my butt out too far. He confirmed it and I felt better today. 

Woods, who started at the 10th hole, was also in tinkering mode during Fridays round. I felt room for improvement out there, he said. I didnt drive it very good early but I fixed that on the back nine. 

My distance control of my irons wasnt all that great. 

I got my legs organised, my head organised and my wrist and (club) release better. It felt pretty good coming in. 

Woods picked up five birdies but, for the second day running, he was less than pleased with his putting. It was frustrating. I had great speed on the greens again but wasnt really starting the ball on line. I just dont feel like I made many putts today. Actually, it was kind of weird. 

Even though he was unable to launch a sustained challenge on Briton Ross Fishers lead, Woods was able to relax in the company of wise-cracking playing partner Miguel Angel Jimenez. He (Jimenez) is so funny, said Woods. Some of the one-liners he comes out with are pretty good. 

The 43-year-old Spaniard was also on nine-under after notching six birdies in a round of 68.

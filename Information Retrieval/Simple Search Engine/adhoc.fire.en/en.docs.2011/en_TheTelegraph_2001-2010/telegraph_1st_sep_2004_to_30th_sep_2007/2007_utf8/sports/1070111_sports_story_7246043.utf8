The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Real may shun Beckham

Madrid: David Beckham may be on the way out of Real Madrid, according to comments made on Wednesday by the clubs sports director. 

Beckhams contract was not renewed, Predrag Mijatovic told an Italian TV channel. It wasnt clear whether Mijatovic meant the decision was final or whether contract talks were still alive. 

Some news media quoted Mijatovic as saying, Beckham will leave us, we will not renew his contract. However, that did not reflect the exact words broadcast in the Italian interview. 

The interviewer asked: Will Beckhams contract be renewed? Mijatovic replied: No, Beckhams contract was not renewed. 

Real said they werent aware of Mijatovics remarks, and added that the club would make any announcements about Beckham on its website. Beckhams four-year contract expires at the end of this season. (AP)

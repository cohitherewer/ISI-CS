Southampton: The euphoria of the Test series is history. Rahul Dravid and his team are focused on the next job in hand the seven-match ODI series against England which kicks off at the Rose Bowl here on Tuesday. 

The captain hinted that Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly will open the batting. Sachin and Sourav did really well in Ireland as openers, well probably stick with that combination. 

I have moved myself around a bit to ensure that there is some experience down the order, said Dravid. 

The captain said younger players are getting chances. Yuvraj gets a lot of opportunities. Hes an exciting ODI player During the course of this series hell get opportunities to bat a lot more overs so that he can win matches on his own. 

Dravid defended his bowlers who conceded nearly 300 runs in the abandoned one-day warm up match against England Lions the other day. 

I think they took time to switch from the Test to one-day mode. We have spoken to the bowlers and discussed the lengths they need to bowl at. We have also had a talk among batsmen. The implementation will important. 

On Munaf Patel, Dravid said: Hes coming back from injury, will probably need a little more time. On a flat wicket in Northampton, it wasnt easy bowling against the wind. He did really well in the second spell. Thats a good sign. 

Hes (Munaf) probably been our most economical one-day bowler over the last year. His getting back to form and fitness will be important for us in the long run. Well have to give him a bit more time to get there. 

The captain refused to accept there will be added pressure on Zaheer Khan and and R.P. Singh after their good sow in the Tests. Theres pressure on everybody in international cricket. People are put under the gun a lot, you need to stand up, said Dravid. 

The ideal scenario will be to field five bowlers in ODIs, said Dravid. But it will depend on wicket. Weve also got to take into account the fact that the game will be under lights. Its going to be a question of assessing the conditions. 

The return of Andrew Flintoff and the presence of Ravi Bopara will give England a better look, felt Dravid. 

Its good to play against a player of Flintoffs quality. He brings a lot to England with his all-round skills. With Bopara, theres a much better look to England. Theres a lot more depth and flexibility. 

Dravid reiterated that his team had moved on from the World Cup defeat and had new challenges to respond to. 

This group of players has new challenges, new things to achieve. There are lessons to be learnt and weve moved on. There is a lot of one-day cricket to be played from here on and we need to keep getting better. 

Although the Indian skipper wasnt too keen to discuss retirement, he said that four years was a long time to be thinking about playing the next World Cup. 

You never know, its hard to predict. A lot depends on your form and fitness. We just got to focus on this series. 

Im sure during the course of the year or so there will be opportunity for other players to play more games. Already in the Twenty20 three of us (Dravid, Sachin, and Sourav) arent playing. Its an opportunity to bring on other young players. 

Its too early to say but the game is getting younger. I dont want to talk about retirement but I know four years is a long time in international cricket.

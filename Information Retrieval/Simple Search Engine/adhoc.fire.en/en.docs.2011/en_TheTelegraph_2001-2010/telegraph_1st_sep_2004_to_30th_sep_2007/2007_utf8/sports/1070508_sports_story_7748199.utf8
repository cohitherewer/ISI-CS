 Flower appointed Moores deputy

Frank Praverman

The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has announced that Andy Flower, the former Zimbabwe wicketkeeper, is to be Peter Moores new assistant coach with the national side, replacing Matthew Maynard. 

Flower, 39, has been turning out for Essex but announced his retirement from playing in order to take up the position which follows on from his work as a batting coach with the academy. 

Andy will bring to the support staff a wealth of international experience as well as a clear understanding of the domestic game in England and Wales, Moores said. I am sure all the players will respond to his style and enjoy working with him. 

It was great news for me when it was confirmed that Andy had agreed to accept this appointment and I feel that he will have a significant impact in the future. I would also like to take the opportunity to thank Matthew and wish him well in his future coaching commitments. 

Thanks to the co-operation, which the board has received from Essex County Cricket Club, Andy will be joining up with the team for preparation for the first NPower Test match at Lords next week. And I am grateful to ECB and Essex for moving so rapidly and enabling the back room team to be confirmed in time for my first match in charge of the England team. 

Flower added: I hold Peter Moores in the highest regard and congratulate him on his recent appointment as the England head coach. I believe that his selection as England head coach was an inspired choice and reflected well on his work and that of Rod Marsh prior to Peter in setting up the national academy. 

From my time working with Peter at the academy, I know that we shall work very well together and I am excited about entering into this new challenge of coaching an international team. 

Flower scored 16,379 first-class runs at an average of 54.05 including 4794 runs at 51.54 in 63 Tests. He also claimed 160 victims behind the stumps.

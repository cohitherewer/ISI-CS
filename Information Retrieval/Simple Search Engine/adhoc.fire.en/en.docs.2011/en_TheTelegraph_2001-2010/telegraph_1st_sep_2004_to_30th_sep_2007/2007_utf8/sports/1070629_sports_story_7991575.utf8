The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No shade of Bagan at Subratas EB

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Far from the hustle and bustle of Calcutta, in the serene surroundings of Kalyani, a dream is being shaped. The dream of a man whose destiny has been rewritten. 

Its almost unreal watching Subrata Bhattacharya directing operations at an East Bengal practice session. But as the man whose name has been synonymous with Mohun Bagan since he joined the club as a promising stopper-back in 1974 himself points out, such sentiments dont suit a professional coach. 

When a club shows faith in me, its my duty to strive for success help prepare the players mentally and physically in such a way that they are ready for the challenges my job cant be any different with East Bengal, says Subrata, relaxing after lunch at the team hotel. 

But, yes, he does have some new ideas and some targets. 

Winning matches and trophies will obviously be the primary aim, but I want the team to win by playing good football. I have certain game plans and combinations in mind with which to achieve that end 

The other things Subrata talks of fondly are trying to develop some young talents and encourage home-grown players. Ask him if will induct anything from the Mohun Bagan culture into his new team, he turns dismissive. 

I dont want to talk of the past, I dont want to go into any kind of comparison, I dont wish to talk of their team, Subrata says. Its almost as if he has deleted the name Mohun Bagan from his memory. 

Im getting what Im wanting at East Bengal, Im very happy here... I think the players are happy too, you can ask them. 

None has a negative comment on Subrata, at least not as yet. Be it former Mohun Bagan boys Mehtab Hussain and Dipendu Biswas, or East Bengal regular Dipankar Roy, they are all enjoying Subratas first days with his once arch-rivals. 

Concentration camps are very essential these days because of the innumerable distractions in the city. And Kalyani is the best place for such camps, adds Subrata, perhaps sending a message to club officials who are contemplating shifting the camp to Barasat because of steep hotel charges in Kalyani. 

Subrata is not worried that the likes of Alvito DCunha, M. Suresh, Tomba Singh and Edmilson have not yet reported to the camp. He knows they should all be there in a weeks time. Subrata is happy with the team he has been given. A central defender from overseas is the only addition we are looking for, he reveals.

 PCB says no to Gillian request

Karachi: The PCB has ruled out playing a Twenty20 match against India to raise funds for the Bob Woolmer academy in Cape Town due to the congested fixture schedule. 

Woolmer died in Jamaica in March during the World Cup, a day after his team lost to debutants Ireland. Jamaican authorities investigated the death as a murder before announcing it had been due to natural causes. 

Woolmers widow Gillian has written to both the boards asking them to play a fund-raiser for his dream project. 

We got a letter asking us to play a Twenty20 match with India for the academy. But this seems unlikely in the near future, PCB spokesman Ehsan Malik said on Thursday. 

Malik said a tight international schedule for both teams and a finalised itinerary for Pakistans tour of India in November-December were the reasons behind the decision.

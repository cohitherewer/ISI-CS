 Manoj has a long way to go: Coach

A STAFF REPORTER

 Ghosh 

Calcutta: If Manoj Tewari is the new Bengal star at the moment, his coach Manabendra Ghosh too has become a sought-after person. 

Manabda, as he is known to his boys, has been coaching since 1995. There has been other success stories for him but this one, obviously, ranks above others. However, Ghosh is keeping a cool head. He has just cleared the MBBS entrance exam He has to complete the course and establish himself Its a long way to go, Ghosh said. 

Manoj is here to stay, though he has to avoid playing rash shots and grab the opportunity with both hands, he felt. 

The more-than-ten-year association has been full of highs and lows. Ghosh still remembers the morning when as an 11-year-old Manoj came to Dukhiram Coaching Centre. He could somewhat spot Manojs urge for the game. Cricket is like god to him He would diligently turn up for practice even during pujas, forgetting everything. He was a notch above his peers, clearing our level exams at ease.

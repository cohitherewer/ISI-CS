The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Media focus on Jellygate and Indian steel

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: A day after India defeated the hosts by seven wickets in the second Test to go 1-0 up in the three-match series, the British media went hammer and tongs at Englands Jellygate and lauded the visitors for the steel they showed under tough conditions. The following are excerpts from what the newspapers had to say (in alphabetical order): 

THE DAILY EXPRESS: In amongst the venom and vitriol, the snapping and snarling, the bouncers and the barging and, of course, the jelly bean or beans, India showed the greater steel to post a rare Test win on foreign soil Tuesday. Rahul Dravid can now sense the real possibility of only Indias third ever series win in England. 

THE DAILY MIRROR: England took their expected spanking from India, but the sugary row over jelly beans and player behaviour rumbled on. India won the second Test, but rather than for great cricket, the game will be remembered for the tensions and Jellygate. 

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH: Indias success was well deserved despite the advantage conferred by the toss. Despite the lack of a coach, Indias bowlers and batsmen adapted better than the home side and while both teams overdid the gamesmanship and sledging, Rahul Dravids men used the brickbats and jelly beans as a spur rather than a slight and raised their game accordingly. 

THE GUARDIAN: India took a little more than an hour and a half to score the 63 runs necessary to win what had been an absorbing if fractious and at times puerile Test match. England bowlers came hard at India. However, the capacity of India to knuckle down in the first innings exceeded that of their opponents. The Indian batsmen actually gave an object lesson in playing late, putting in a proper stride when going forward and not being drawn away from their intended line of play. 

THE INDEPENDENT: Englands seven wicket defeat provides the Michael Vaughan/Peter Moores axis with its first real test. Tuesdays loss leaves them facing the unwelcome prospect of overseeing the teams first Test series reverse since 2001. Sadly, Jellygate highlights the extent England were prepared to go to unsettle an opponent. 

THE SUN: There is something unedifying about cricketers trying to intimidate opponents with the bully-boy tactics of verbals, angry stares and shoulder charges. There is something childish about placing jelly beans on the pitch when a batsman is about to take guard. And there is something downright pathetic about doing it in a match when you are thrashed by seven wickets. 

THE TIMES: Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly, embraced in the middle after a yorker from Tremlett had bounced past the leg stump from a foothold for the winning four byes. The heat generated by well-directed short-pitched fast bowling Tuesday morning left them in no doubt that Indias exceptional allround performance could easily be avenged by England in the third and last Test starting at The Brit Oval a week from now. 

India have made a recent habit of winning early Tests in a series only to relinquish their lead, most recently in South Africa this year, but they are now favourites to win.

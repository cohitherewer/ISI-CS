 Symonds, Hayden told to take it easy

Melbourne: Australian captain Ricky Ponting has asked teammates Andrew Symonds and Matthew Hayden not to force the pace of their recovery and be careful while getting involved in the teams practice sessions. 

Symonds made a comeback from bicep surgery ahead of schedule while Hayden started walking laps at training after breaking his right big toe against New Zealand last month and also being troubled by a sore left foot. 

Its great to see Symo just with a bat in his hand. Thats terrific news, but still we have to be really careful with them, Ponting said. 

I have had a chat with both this morning just to make sure they are not getting too involved too soon, he was quoted as saying by an Australian daily. 

Ponting said the Aussies, already without some of their crucial players in the World Cup, could not afford to lose more players. 

When you get back around the group and training starts, you want to be able to help them out and get stuck in. But you cant afford to do it. If Symo got some sort of bump or knock on his shoulder, it might put him back a week, and we really cant afford that. I have told both of those guys to get away for a while and do what they have to do, but be really careful as well, he said. 

Besides missing their warm-up match against Zimbabwe, Hayden will wear a protective cap on his boot when he returns to the nets. He is also expected to sit out the second practice match, against England on Friday, but hopes to be fit for the opening group game against Scotland. 

Ponting reiterated his doubts over the participation of so many minnow teams in the World Cup, wondering if it would really do any good to cricketing standard of the second-tier teams. 

Ive always felt there are places and times for minnow nations to be playing. Im not sure if the World Cup and the Champions Trophy is one of those times, Ponting said. 

Ponting said he remembered playing against the US during the 2004 Champions Trophy in England, when Australia bowled the Americans out for 65 and reached 66 for one in 7.5 overs. (When) we played USA, Im not sure if they learned too much about that, and I dont think it does the game any good.

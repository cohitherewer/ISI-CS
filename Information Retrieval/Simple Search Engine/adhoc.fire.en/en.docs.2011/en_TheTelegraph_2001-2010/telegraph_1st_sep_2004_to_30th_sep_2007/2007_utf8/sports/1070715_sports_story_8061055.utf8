 McLarens image takes a beating

ANDREW BAKER

The escalation of the Formula One espionage row, with McLaren called to a hearing in front of the sports governing body, the FIA, is a bitter blow to the English team, which prides itself on propriety. 

The teams chief, Ron Dennis, has transformed success on the track into a multi-million pound company linked with some of the worlds largest blue-chip operations. The purity of the teams image is a key element in its commercial success, and this now stands to be tainted by the investigative process. 

This week the focus has been on McLarens chief designer Mike Coughlan, who along with wife Trudy faced a preliminary hearing at Londons High Court on Tuesday about the alleged theft of technical information. He has been suspended by the team. 

On Friday, the FIA announced that they were summoning McLaren to an extraordinary meeting of the World Motor Sport Council later this month, leaving Lewis Hamilton in danger of seeing his first quest for the world championship end in court. 

This is hardly a positive marketing message in a sport where image is everything. Last weekend, McLaren launched their new mobile team headquarters. A vast, three-storey, mirror-windowed structure, it was quickly dubbed Terminal Six by paddock wags. But the proper title of the edifice is far more significant. 

It is The Vodafone McLaren Mercedes Brand Centre, a focus for the marketing activities of the team over a Grand Prix weekend. 

McLaren does not stoop to such things as mere commercial sponsorship. It enters into partnerships with companies such as the two included in the teams official name, which expect to benefit not only from the television exposure enjoyed by the sport, but also by association with a name which has become synonymous with technical excellence and the sporting spirit. 

The team that Ron built do things the right way. When as is more often the case they have built a fast car, and have two fast drivers to race it, they will not indulge in Ferrari-style team orders to decide who should win races in it. McLaren drivers, whether they be Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna, or Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso, are allowed to compete against each other as far as possible. 

Dennis is a stickler for smart dress, self-discipline and courtesy. There was no doubting his sincerity last weekend in the paddock at Silverstone, when he came close to tears in defence of his team and the values it espouses. 

Now those values are being questioned, not just by Formula Ones incessant gossips but by the sports governing body. Worse, the achievements of his two current drivers may be undermined. One, Fernando Alonso, is the double (and reigning) world champion Dennis recruited at great expense from Renault. 

The other is Lewis Hamilton. Hamilton leads the world championship by a dozen points, and Alonso is his closest pursuer. But the FIA has a track record of draconian judgements, and the organisations president, Max Mosley, has pointed out that it is unusual for a team to be punished without its drivers also suffering. 

Paddock insiders insist that any organised campaign by McLaren to acquire Ferrari data is unthinkable. Formula One people may poke fun at Denniss vocabulary, but few in the sport believe that McLaren can be guilty of espionage. The Daily Telegraph

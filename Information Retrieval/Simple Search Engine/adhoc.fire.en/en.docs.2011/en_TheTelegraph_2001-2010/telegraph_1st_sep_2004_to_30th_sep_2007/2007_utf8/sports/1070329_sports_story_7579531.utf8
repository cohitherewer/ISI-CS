 Police to conduct 2nd autopsy

Kingston: Mark Shields, Jamaicas deputy police commissioner, has said an independent second autopsy will be conducted on slain Pakistan coach Bob Woolmers body to be sure about facts before making any arrests. 

The second post-mortem will be carried out to confirm the first test, which said Woolmer was murdered by manual strangulation in his hotel room on March 18. 

Police fear that anyone ultimately charged with the crime will attempt to smear the findings as flawed. 

If we arrest someone this week and charge them, the defence council will want a second post-mortem, the jury may want a second post-mortem, Shields was quoted as saying by a newspaper. 

The announcement came amid speculation that Jamaican government pathologist Ere Sheshaiah may have made mistakes that have beset the murder investigation. 

But Shields said he was 100 per cent certain that Sheshaiah was correct. 

There is very clear evidence of murder, some of which I will not disclose to anybody, he added. 

The new inquiry, which will probably be conducted by a pathologist from overseas, should allow Kingston coroner Patrick Murphy to release Woolmers remains for burial in the next few days. 

Murphy had earlier said Woolmers body must stay within his jurisdiction until the inquest was concluded. 

Meanwhile, Sheshaiah has said he was confident about the job he had done. I took two hours and I did a complete post-mortem. Hence I arrived at the cause of death and gave my report to the police high command. 

Meanwhile, two of three the Pakistani fans wanted for questioning, said they were innocent and had nothing to do with the murder. The two Pakistan team hangers-on were identified as Erfan Chaudhary and Tariq Malik.

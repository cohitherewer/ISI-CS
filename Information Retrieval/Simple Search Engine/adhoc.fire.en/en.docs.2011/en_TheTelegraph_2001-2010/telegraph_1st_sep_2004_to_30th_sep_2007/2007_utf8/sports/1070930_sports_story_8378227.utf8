The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Right Again stands tall 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: The last winter seasons St. Leger winner, Right Again, has better credentials than Flemenco Star to win the 2,000m Monsoon Cup, the seasons prime attraction in Sundays eight-event card. The Daniel David-trainee, though, is at a substantial weight disadvantage against the 1,400m Swatantrata Cup winner Flemenco Star, he stands tall if measured by his superior Class. Moreover, the Steinbeck-Artwork son is a proven stayer and he may walk away with the trophy in the hands of jockey Imran Chisty.

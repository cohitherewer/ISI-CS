The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Paes caught napping...

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Just a couple of days ago, Leander Paes was counting on Rohan Bopanna as his lead player in next weekends Davis Cup tie in Uzbekistan. The next thing he heard was that the top-ranked Indian had pulled out of the Asia-Oceania zone group I tie. 

I got a call from Anil (Khanna) saying Rohan has made himself unavailable for the Uzbekistan tie, Paes told The Telegraph from Singapore. 

The captain wanted to talk to Bopanna on hearing the news from the AITA secretary. I called him, his phone was switched off. I also messaged him, but there was no response, Paes said. 

As a reason for his sudden withdrawal from the national team, Bopanna has told Khanna that he wants to qualify for the main draws of Grand Slam doubles events. 

Thats a flimsy explanation, coming from a man who has been keen to establish himself as the top singles player in our country. Indian tennis players have traditionally prided themselves in playing for the country. Bopanna has turned out to be an exception. 

What is most intriguing is his manner of withdrawal. He did not show the courtesy of informing the captain and even made a conscious effort to avoid speaking with him. 

Its each individual athletes responsibility to decide whether he wants to represent the country. I have always given national duty utmost importance. If somebody thinks otherwise, what can I say. 

Bopanna is in no mood to be lectured by Paes. He is going by his advisers who see a bright future for the 26-year-old in Grand Slam doubles.

 Sania to face Hingis 

Carson: Sania Mirza eased past Canadian Alesandra Wozniak into the second round of the $600,000 East West Bank Classic WTA tournament here. 

The 30th ranked Sania did not have much problem taming the 109th ranked Wozniak as she notched up a 6-3, 6-2 victory over the qualifier at the Tier II hard court event on Monday. 

However, an uphill task lies ahead of the Hyderabadi who will meet seventh seed Martina Hingis of Switzerland in the next round. The Swiss got a bye in the first round. 

In the doubles, Sania and her new partner Bethanie Mattek of the Unites States will take on Janette Husarova of Slovakia and Michaella Krajicek of the Netherlands. (PTI)

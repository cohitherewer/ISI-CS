The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Local referees issue boycott call

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Calcutta Referees Association (CRA) has decided to boycott all matches from Sunday in protest against the IFAs decision to have outstation referees for two Premier Division matches. The decision was taken at IFAs general body meeting on Saturday. 

The governing body decided to have outstation referees for Saturdays East Bengal-United SC and Sundays Mohun Bagan-Mohammedan Sporting matches. 

The boycott means two other Premier Division and four Super Division matches slated for Sunday wont take place. The first division and fourth division ties on Monday are also likely to fall through. 

CRAs Kamal Sarkar will meet IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly on Monday to find a solution to the crisis.

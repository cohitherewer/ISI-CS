 Randhir blasts Korean tactics 

New Delhi: A week after losing its bid to stage 2014 Asian Games in Delhi, India on Thursday accused South Koreans of using unethical means to get the Games awarded to Incheon. 

The Koreans offered carrots to the 45-member Olympic Council of Asia (OCA), said the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) general secretary Randhir Singh. 

Korea announced that the money will be given to OCA which in turn would distribute it among National Olympic Councils (NOCs) as per its discretion. It was like offering a carrot to the OCA, he said. 

According to Randhir, the Koreans missed no opportunity to lobby. Korean representatives received guests at an OCA dinner on the eve of the presentations. The Koreans looked like the hosts of the dinner. It was not ethical, he said. (PTI)

 Malik draws flak from stalwarts

Karachi: Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik has drawn flakfrom former players for his ignorance about the bowlout rule in ICC World Twenty20 meet. 

Former captain Javed Miandad said it was strange Malik and the team management didnt know about the bowlout rule in such a crucial match. 

One fails to understand what sort of homework was done for this game which was followed so intensely by millions back home, said Miandad. 

Former skipper Rameez Raja also hit out at Malik saying he didnt understand the logic of using pace bowlers when the slow bowlers could have been a better bet. I think the Indians showed more sense by using their spinners... I just couldnt comprehend what our team was doing, he said. 

Another former captain Intikhab Alam also said it was sad on the part of the team management. It is not a good commentary on Pakistan cricket when your captain admits his players were not accepting the match against India to be decided by this new rule, Intikhab said. 

He also said that sending Afridi lower down the batting order was under-utilisation of his talent. 

Former leg-spinner, Abdul Qadir also supported a promotion for Afridi in the batting order saying had Afridi been sent earlier in the game against India there would have been less pressure in the final two overs. (PTI)

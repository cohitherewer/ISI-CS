Calcutta: Even as Kapil Dev visited the Zonal Cricket Academy (East), Team India set the ball rolling for their new innings, albeit quietly, in the city on Monday. 

As captain Rahul Dravid and cricket manager Ravi Shastri arrived ahead of the conditioning camp for the tour of Bangladesh, hardly any euphoria was noticed. 

It was sheer coincidence that Indias lone World Cup-winning captain and Dravid, post-World Cup debacle in the Caribbean, arrived in the city on the same day. 

One was here to nurture the seeds of future and the other hoping to put the team back on track. 

Newly-appointed bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad and fielding coach Robin Singh also trooped in along with the entire support staff. 

The five-day conditioning camp begins at the Eden on Wednesday. The players will arrive in batches on Tuesday. The ODI squad will leave for Dhaka on May 7. 

The new thinktank held an informal meeting in the evening, which was also attended by physio John Gloster and trainer Gregory King. 

Due to the hot and humid weather, the players are likely to have two sessions a day early in the morning and late afternoon. 

I expect them to practise in two sessions everyday, CAB president Prasun Mukherjee said. 

According to him, the thinktank has also asked for the use of three indoor pitches during the camp. 

Well get to know about their detailed plans after the captain and cricket managers visit to the Eden on Tuesday morning, he added. 

A member of the support staff, however, inspected the facilities on Monday. 

India will play a three-match ODI series in Bangladesh, starting on May 10, followed by two Tests.

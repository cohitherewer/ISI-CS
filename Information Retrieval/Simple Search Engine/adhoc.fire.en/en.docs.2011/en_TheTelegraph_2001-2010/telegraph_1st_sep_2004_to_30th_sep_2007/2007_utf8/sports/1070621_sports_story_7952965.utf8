 Steves advice 

for Socceroos

Melbourne: Australias soccer team is going ahead with its plan to take advice from former cricket captain Steve Waugh on dealing with tough conditions in the subcontinent as part of preparations for next months Asian Cup. 

The Aussies will be based in Bangkok initially and could play in Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia depending on their progress in the tournament. 

Australian coach Graham Arnold met Steve on Tuesday and sought to learn from his experience of playing in the sub-continent. 

It is something I have had in the back of the mind for sometime now. We all know about Steves character and determination and how he adapted to all sorts of conditions during his career, Arnold was quoted as saying. 

He was always fantastic in India and Pakistan because he understood the culture and the conditions. (PTI)

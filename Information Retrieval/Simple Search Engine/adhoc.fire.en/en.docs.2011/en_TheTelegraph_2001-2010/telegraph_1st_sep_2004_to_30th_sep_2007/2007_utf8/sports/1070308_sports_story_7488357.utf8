 Bookie controversy a distraction: Samuels

Montego Bay: Unfazed by the controversy surrounding his conversation with an alleged Indian bookie, the West Indies middle order batsman Marlon Samuels insists he is not bothered by the distraction and is preparing to live up to captain Brian Laras expecations. 

Samuels has had a good run in recent past and his scores in the last three games that the West Indies have won read 100 not out (vs Pakistan), 98 (vs India) and 100 against Kenya on Monday at the Trelawny multi-purpose stadium. 

Its a good feeling to score a hundred coming from a lot of distractions, Samuels said in an obvious reference to the recent unpleasant mentioning of his name in India. 

The stylish right-hander, however, said he was not losing sleep over the issue and knew how to handle it. 

Ive had a lot of distractions in my career and I know how to take the negatives and turn them into positives. The greatest thing was the support I have received from the crowd both in Kingston and in the country, it was delightful, Samuels said. 

Of late, Lara has been repeating that for the West Indies to succeed at the World Cup, his team needed to find more matchwinners in the ranks. He has been simultaneously cautioning against over-reliance on himself and the other big names like Chris Gayle, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Shivnarine Chanderpaul. 

I am aware of it. The captain spoke to me and said he is looking for matchwinners and I told him I have no problem doing that, Samuels said. 

The captain asked for matchwinners. He is giving me the chance and Im relishing the opportunity, Samuels said. 

I see this as hard work plus opportunity now paying off for me. Its wonderful to perform well and if the team wins, you really cant ask for more than that, Samuels said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Jadeja against minnows 

 Sharp Singles 

 Mumbai: Former India Test cricketer Ajay Jadeja feels the inclusion of the minnows has made the World Cup a lengthy affair. 

The minnows have stretched the tournament as they are too many in number. They should be given opportunities but there are other options such as the Asia Cup, the Afro-Asia Cup and the triangular tournaments, Jadeja said here on Thursday. 

The 36-year-old, who featured in three World Cups, said, If these teams are really good enough to play in crickets premier tournament, then they should be given chance in the bilateral series as well. 

Ricky Ponting wont cherish the century he made against Scotland in Australias opening match as the hundred he scored in his last match of the 2003 World Cup (against India in the final), he said.

Batting for Bangla

 Dhaka: A Bangladesh firm has sent what they claim is the worlds biggest cricket bat on a signature tour to drum up support for the national team at the World Cup, a company official said on Thursday. 

The 70ft (22m) long and eight-foot wide bat has been signed by thousands since it began its nationwide journey from Rangpur, the firms public relations manager said. Its the worlds biggest bat and we hope to gather at least one million signatures wishing good luck to the Bangladesh cricket team, he said.

Rain scare

 Basseterre: Rain, which interrupted Australias opening World Cup group A match against Scotland for half an hour on Wednesday, is forecast for each remaining day of the first round in St Kitts. 

A 10-day forecast released on Thursday said there was at least a 30 per cent chance of showers every day until the final match between Australia and South Africa on March 24. 

The sleuth link

 Basseterre: Not many World Cup teams can boast of a link to Sherlock Holmes. The Netherlands can. Holmes creator, the celebrated author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, was an avid cricketer and was part of the first team to tour The Netherlands in 1891. It must have been a worthwhile experience for Doyle as he went on to play 10 matches for MCC, eight of them at Lords. He only took one wicket in his career but it was memorable dismissing W.G. Grace for 110. The first club in The Netherlands was formed in Utrecht by students from both The Netherlands and the Cape Colony in 1856.

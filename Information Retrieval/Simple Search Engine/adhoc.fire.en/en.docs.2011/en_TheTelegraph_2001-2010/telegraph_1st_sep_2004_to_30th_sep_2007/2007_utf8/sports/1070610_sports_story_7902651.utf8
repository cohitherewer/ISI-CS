 Sachin, Jaffer miss 1st day 

Bangalore: Sachin Tendulkar is set to miss the first two days of the four-day fitness-specific cricket camp for batsmen that got underway here on Saturday. 

Tendulkar will arrive tomorrow evening and will attend the camp from Monday. He has already secured permission from the board, said camp co-ordinator Ramesh Rao after the opening days indoor session. 

Also missing from the first days action at the National Cricket Academy here was Sachins Mumbai mate and India Test opener Wasim Jaffer, who is down with viral fever. 

Also lanky Punjab pacer VRV Singh is recovering from a bout of viral fever in the Wockhardt Hospital here on his return from Mysore where he attended the bowlers camp. 

VRV is recovering from viral fever. He is much better now. He was admitted in the hospital on Friday and is expected to be discharged tomorrow, said Rao. 

The four batsmen who are doing duty for the Asia against Africa in Chennai in the Afro-Asia Cup ODIs Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh and Mahendra Singh Dhoni would also join the camp on Monday. 

On Saturday, nine batsmen called for the camp, including India captain Rahul Dravid, and pace bowler Sreesanth went through fitness training and core and shoulder stability exercises. 

The players did some yoga in the morning and then underwent beep test, did some vertical jumps and workouts in the gymnasium, Rao said. Sreesanth will be here tomorrow also and then would leave the camp. Hes been asked to be here in the batsmens camp as he could not attend the first two days of the bowlers camp held at Mysore. 

The Kerala pacer missed part of the June 4-8 bowlers camp to play an Afro-Asia Cup Twenty20 tie. (PTI)

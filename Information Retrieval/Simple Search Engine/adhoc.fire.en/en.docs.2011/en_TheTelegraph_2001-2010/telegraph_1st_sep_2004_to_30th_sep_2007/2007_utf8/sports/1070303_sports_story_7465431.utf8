The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pakistan complain to Sonn about Speed

Karachi: The PCB has shot off a strongly-worded letter to the ICC terming as unwarranted Malcolm Speeds remarks on Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif. 

We have sent a protest letter to the ICC president (Percy Sonn) as we feel that some of the remarks made by Speed on Akhtar and Asif were unwarranted and an attempt to influence opinion on the doping issue, PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf said on Friday. 

Speed, while talking about the ICCs policy of targeted dope tests during the forthcoming World Cup, had described the whole affair of Akhtar and Asif continuing to play after having tested positive for a banned steroid as an embarrassment for the sport. 

A case is pending in the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) between us and the Wada on the Akhtar and Asif affair. Speeds remarks can influence its outcome, a peeved Ashraf said. 

I am surprised at the timing of the statement and the remarks on Pakistan and their players because we are one of only four countries which voluntarily carries out dope tests. Our commitment to the anti-doping policy of the ICC is firm, he said. 

[Speed said after a Board meeting in Cape Town that the duo escaped drugs test. If they had been selected the intention was that those players would have been target tested. The target testing will continue involving other players.] 

According to a source, the PCB has written that Sonn should speak to Speed and caution him not to give any statement on the issue in future. Another PCB official said Speeds statement did not play a role in dropping Akhtar and Asif from the World Cup squad. 

Meanwhile, a PCB official said a formal request for replacements for Shoaib and Asif was yet to be submitted to the ICC. Mohammed Sami and Yasir Arafat are the ones chosen to replace the pair. 

The official said while it was correct that the support period for the World Cup started after Friday, it applied only to players who were in their teams and had reached the West Indies. (PTI)

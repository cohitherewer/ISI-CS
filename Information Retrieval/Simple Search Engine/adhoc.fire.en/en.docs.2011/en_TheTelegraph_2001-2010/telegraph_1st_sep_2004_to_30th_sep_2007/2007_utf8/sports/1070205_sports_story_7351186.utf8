 Randhawa finishes tied seventh 

 - Stenson clinches crown ahead of Woods, Els; Jeev joint 34th 

Dubai: Jyoti Randhawa and Jeev Milkha Singh failed to fire on the final day of the Dubai Desert Classic, going over par for their fourth round as Swede Henrik Stenson claimed the title ahead of Tiger Woods and Ernie Els. 

Lying in a tie for second overnight, Randhawa (74) ended in a tie for seventh, while Jeev Milkha Singh (76) finished tied 34th after being 13th overnight. 

Stenson (68) showed ice-cool nerves in scorching weather with swirling winds to win at 19-under, as Els (71) birdied the last to finish runner-up for the second year in a row. 

Woods left no doubt that he was frustrated with his putting. Well, thats one of the worst putting weeks Ive had in a long time. Very frustrating. Just got a lot of work to do when I go home, the world No. 1 said. 

Ross Fisher (71), who led for the first two days, was sole fifth, while Peter Hanson (71) finished sixth. 

Randhawa shared seventh place with former Asian No. 1 Simon Dyson (70) and Thai Prom Meesawat (71), who dropped shots on 15th and 17th. 

Randhawa struggled with his game, which was understandable with wind speeds going upto 30 kmph. But it was his putting that disappointed. He had just one birdie on the back nine and none on the front nine. He also made three bogeys on the first stretch. 

Jeev was worse off as he repeatedly missed small putts under five feet for birdies and pars. He had at least three three-putts and there were back-to-back bogeys on three occasions. In all he had six bogeys and just two birdies in his round. 

It was the worst I have ever putted, said Jeev. I was just not able to trust my stroke. I hit the ball very well once more, but once I got on to the greens it was a disaster. 

Randhawa said, I realise I need a few more weeks to get into the groove. As I said before, I should have been better prepared for the start of the season. 

Ironically, Randhawa found nine of the 14 fairways on Sunday, his best for the week. But he hit inconsistently finding just over 50 cent of the greens and needed 30 putts for his poorest day with the flat blade. 

Jeev needed 37 putts as compared to 29, 28 and 29 on the first three days. A card which should have a couple or more under became four-over. I couldnt putt anything, he said.

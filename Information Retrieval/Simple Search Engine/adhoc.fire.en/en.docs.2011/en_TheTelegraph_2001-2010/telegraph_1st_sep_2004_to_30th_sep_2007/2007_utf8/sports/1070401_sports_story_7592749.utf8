The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Wadekar slighted by BCCI chief Pawar

 - Insulting to add Pataudis name as an afterthought 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Sharad Pawar has suddenly become proactive, giving the impression that he means business. 

While its to be seen what comes of his session with a clutch of former captains in Mumbai on Friday, its surprising that Ajit Wadekar hasnt been invited. 

Some havent been that surprised, though. 

Indeed, theres talk that Wadekar has been slighted because of Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) politics. 

Besides heading the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), Union minister Pawar is the MCA supremo and came to power by defeating Wadekar in early 2001. 

Pawar, apparently, wanted to be elected unopposed and suggested that Wadekar (then a vice-president) accept another post. The challenger declined, saying he would rather lose than compromise. 

Eventually, Wadekar lost 125-185. 

Theres no logical explanation for ignoring the Mumbai-based Wadekar and, so, it seems Pawar hasnt forgotten that MCA election-rebuff. 

Its the presidents prerogative He has drawn up the list of invitees If needed, Wadekars name can be added It wont take time, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah told The Telegraph. 

Wadekar laughed when one sought his reaction. 

I dont know why Ive not been called I cant answer that Perhaps, the ones whove been invited know much more than I do However, its not an issue with me. 

Asked if he would accept a belated invitation, Wadekar paused before saying I dont think so. 

Not too long ago, Wadekar turned down a Maharashtra government award as he wasnt properly invited. 

Besides having been a successful captain, Wadekar had a good innings as Indias coach from October 1992 till March 1996 and could give a much wider perspective. 

Of the invitees, only Kapil Dev is a former India coach too. 

While Chandu Borde, Srinivas Venkatraghavan, Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil, Ravi Shastri and Krishnamachari Srikkanth were invited a few days ago, Mansur Ali Khan Tiger Pataudis name got added on Saturday evening. 

Strange why Pawar didnt think of arguably our finest captain in the same breath as the Bordes. Pataudi has, to say the least, been insulted. 

Incidentally, its not clear how many have confirmed they will be present. 

Under-fire coach Greg Chappell, meanwhile, is going to present his report in person to Pawar. 

Apparently, he has decided against emailing to ensure theres no leak from any quarter. 

Chappell wont be sending an SMS to anybody either!

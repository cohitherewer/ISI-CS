The former Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Lord Stevens of Kirkwhelpington, has been hired by Ferrari to investigate how secret team details were allegedly leaked to an employee of fierce Formula One rivals McLaren. 

A day before an emergency meeting of the sports governing body, the FIA, is due to examine the circumstances surrounding Ferrarigate, The Daily Telegraph has learned that Stevens is now conducting his own inquiries into an affair which threatens to overshadow Lewis Hamiltons fairytale debut season in Formula One. 

A spokesman for Quest, the forensic intelligence agency chaired by Stevens, refused to comment on Tuesday on the exact nature of their involvement in the scandal. But he did say: I can confirm that Quest have been retained by Ferrari, as evidenced by mention of Quest in papers filed at the High Court. I am unable to confirm the nature of Quests engagement at this stage. 

Ferraris appointment of Stevens follows his high-profile inquiry into transfer bungs in football, which was finally closed in June after a 15-month investigation which cost the Premier League about 1.3 million. Although Stevens and Quest were unable to sign off 17 of the 362 transfers they investigated, his inquiry highlighted the need for greater probity in dealings between Englands richest clubs. 

On Thursday in Paris, representatives from McLaren Mercedes will face 30 searching questions about how their chief designer, Mike Coughlan, allegedly came to be in possession of a highly sensitive, 780-page technical dossier from Ferraris mechanic, Nigel Stepney. 

Although it is believed that Coughlan had the information in April this year, the FIAs questions relate to a five-month period between March and July this year. 

McLaren, who say they are confident they will be cleared of team espionage, are expected to argue that Coughlan acted alone. Despite that, the sports ruling body have confirmed that if McLaren are found guilty then drivers, Hamilton and Fernando Alonso, who are locked in battle for the Drivers Championship, could lose points. 

The credibility of F1 and sporting fairness is at stake, FIA president Max Mosley said in the lead-up to Sundays European Grand Prix at the Nurburgring. 

 Stevens and Quest are expected to focus on helping Ferrari assemble evidence in their civil action, brought at the High Court, against Coughlan. 

Their inquiries could also have some bearing on Ferraris separate criminal action against Stepney in Italy.

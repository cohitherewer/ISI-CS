Madrid: Barcelona forward Ronaldinho recaptured his form on Sunday when he struck twice to lead his side to a 2-0 win at home to Racing Santander that put them three points clear at the top of the Primera Liga. 

The Brazilian, who has been criticised for his poor showings in recent games, opened the scoring with a magnificent free-kick six minutes after halftime and took his tally for the season to 15 goals when he netted with a fine header 16 minutes later. 

The biggest cheer of the night, though, was reserved for Argentine teenager Lionel Messi who came on as a second half substitute after over three months out with a broken bone in his left foot. 

Barcelona lead the standings on 46 points from 22 games, three clear of Sevilla, who were held 0-0 by city rivals Real Betis on Saturday, and five ahead of Real Madrid who won 2-1 at relegation-threatened Real Sociedad. 

Despite missing their strike duo Pedro Munitis and Nikola Zigic, Racing held their own in the opening exchanges at the Nou Camp and were awarded a penalty after Juliano Belletti leant on Juanjo in the area in the 25th minute. 

But Barcelona keeper Victor Valdes produced a great save to deny Argentine spot-kick specialist Ezequiel Garay. Barcelona stepped up a gear after the early scare, breaking the deadlock six minutes into the second half when Ronaldinho sent a 25-metre free-kick curling over the wall and then dipping low inside the post. 

The Brazilian added a second when he nodded in from close range after Deco had whipped another free kick into the area from wide on the left in the 67th minute. 

Fourth-placed Valencia lost ground on the leaders when they fell victim to Bernd Schusters Getafe who continued their impressive start to the year with a 3-0 win at the Coliseo. 

In England, Arsenal had to come from behind to snatch a 2-1 win over Wigan Athletic and reclaim fourth place in the Premier League from Bolton Wanderers on Sunday. 

Arsenal looked set for a first defeat at the Emirates Stadium after a stunning 35th-minute strike by Wigans Dutch midfielder Denny Landzaat. 

But Wigan defender Fitz Halls own goal in the 81st minute and an 84th minute winner from Czech midfielder Tomas Rosicky turned the game soon after Wigan were denied a penalty. Arsenal are fourth on 49 points and back in front of Bolton, who had reached 47 points with an earlier 2-1 win over Fulham. 

Manchester United, who beat Charlton Athletic 2-0 on Saturday, are top with 66, six ahead of Chelsea who beat Middlesbrough 3-0. 

Liverpool are third on 50 points, with Arsenal holding a game in hand on all three. Wigan will consider themselves very unlucky after leading through Landzaats stunning 30-metre shot. They threatened to score more but were floored at the end when Hall turned a cross into his own net and Rosicky headed his first league goal from Julio Baptistas cross. 

In Italy, league-leaders Inter Milan maintained their 11-point lead at the top of the table with a 2-0 win at Chievo as Serie A resumed after the suspension imposed following last weeks riot in Sicily. 

Domestic football was halted after a policeman was killed when fans went on the rampage at the derby match between Catania and Palermo, forcing the Italian government to introduce strict new security measures to curb hooliganism. 

Clubs whose stadium security is not in line with legal requirements are being forced to play their games behind closed doors and Chievos was one of four grounds without fans. 

A minutes silence was observed at the start of all of the days matches in memory of Filippo Raciti, the policeman who died after being attacked by Catania fans on February 2. 

Goals from Adriano and Hernan Crespo sealed Inters victory in Verona and extended the clubs Serie A record of consecutive league wins to 15 games, equalling the best winning sequence in the Spanish and German leagues. 

Spains Real Madrid won 15 games on the trot in the 1960-61 season, while Germanys Bayern Munich equalled the feat in the 2004-05 and 2005-06 seasons.

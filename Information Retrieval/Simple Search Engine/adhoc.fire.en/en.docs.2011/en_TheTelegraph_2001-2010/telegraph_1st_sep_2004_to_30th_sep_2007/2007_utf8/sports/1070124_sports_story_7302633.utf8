 Ronaldo: Capello doesnt want me 

 - Real Madrid prepare to move on from The Beckham Shock 

 Ronaldo and Beckham, the fall guys at Real Madrid 

Madrid: Ronaldos difficulties with Real Madrid coach Fabio Capello seem set to force the player out of the club. 

My future is away from Madrid because Capello doesnt want me, Ronaldo was quoted as saying by a sports daily on Tuesday. 

Ronaldo last played in the January 7 defeat at Deportivo La Coruna and hasnt been picked for the squad since. 

Capello has regularly said he is frustrated by the Brazil strikers attitude, although the coach suggested on Saturday that the three-time world player of the year could stay. 

Ronaldo, who is under contract until June 2008, has eight days remaining of the January transfer window to switch clubs. Otherwise, he will have to stay at Madrid until the end of the season at least. 

AC Milan appear in prime position to sign the 30-year-old, although the Italian clubs vice-president Adriano Galliani has said he wants the striker on a free transfer. 

Madrids sports director Predrag Mijatovic refuses to entertain this proposal, with the newspaper reporting the Spanish club requires a fee of euro 10 million ($13 million). 

Ronaldo came close to joining Milan last August but the clubs failed to reach an agreement. Milan offered euro 22 million ($28.4 million) but Madrid also wanted an option on the Italian teams midfielder Kaka. 

Saudi Arabian club Al Ittihad is also reportedly interested in signing Ronaldo to team him up with Luis Figo, with whom he has played both at Madrid and FC Barcelona. However, the Brazilian is said to favour a move to one of Europes leading clubs. 

In another development, Real Madrid will discuss with David Beckham how to deal with the remaining six months of his contract, aiming to find a solution acceptable to both parties, Mijatovic was quoted as saying on Tuesday. 

The former England captain was immediately dropped from the squad after rejecting an extension to his deal in favour of a move to the Los Angeles Galaxy at the end of the season. 

Capello said Beckham would not play for the side again, though the Italians stance has softened in recent days. 

The truth is we all felt a little betrayed. Capellos comments (that he would not play again) need to be understood in context. To be angry is a normal reaction, Mijatovic told another sports daily. 

Beckham has started only five league matches this season. Reals next game is away to Villarreal in the Primera Liga on Saturday.

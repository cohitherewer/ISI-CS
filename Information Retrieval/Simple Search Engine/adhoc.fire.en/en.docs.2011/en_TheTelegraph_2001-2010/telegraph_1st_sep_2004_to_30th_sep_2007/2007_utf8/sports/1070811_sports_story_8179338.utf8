 Jeev Milkha stumbles, Jyoti pulls out

Tulsa: Indian golfers got off to an ordinary start as Jeev Milkha Singh endured a nightmarish back nine to card a six-over 76 (as reported in Fridays Late City Edition), while viral fever forced Jyoti Randhawa to pull out on Day I of the PGA Championship on Thursday. 

Daniel Chopra, the Swiss of Indian origin, also shot a six-over 76. 

Both Jeev and Chopra were tied 103rd at the years fourth and final major in the Southern Hills Country Club. But all was not lost as Jeev and Chopra could still make the weekend action with a decent par round as the cut could be in the vicinity of seven-over. 

The surprise leader was Englands Graeme Storm, who shot a five-under 65. 

Jeev had a fine start with a one-under comprising two birdies and a bogey on front nine. But he then ran into trouble went seven over for back nine, including one triple bogey on par-4 12th and then a double on closing 18th. He also had bogeys 15th and 16th. (PTI)

 Roger doubts Hawk-Eye

London: Roger Federer questioned the success of Wimbledons experiment with the Hawk-Eye ball tracking system on Sunday after several flashpoints during his five-set final win over Rafael Nadal. 

The normally serene Swiss was agitated by some of Nadals challenges and completely lost his cool in the fourth set when a Nadal forehand that appeared to land beyond the baseline was shown to have clipped the line. 

What can I say? Federer said, when asked about the call at 0-2, 30-30 in the fourth set that led to him being broken for a second time in the set. 

If Im going to go against it, people will always say he doesnt agree whatsoever. I dont know how they developed this machine, if they took all possibilities into account: the way the ball travels, the way it bounces, 3D, the whole thing. 

I told the umpire I was happy Nadal was going to challenge because I knew the ball was out. Then to see that it was in on a 30-all point, which was such a huge point, I was shocked. 

The 25-year-old, who has raised doubts about Hawk-Eye in the past, was heard using an expletive during the changeover after saying the system is killing me. 

The umpire told me, too, he saw the ball out. He couldnt believe it was in. I was like, all of a sudden, anything I challenge now is just going to go against me. (Reuters)

 EUROPEAN CLUB UPDATE 

 David Beckham

Capello: Real officials sidelined Beckham

Madrid: The decision to banish David Beckham from Real Madrids first team after he announced he would be joining LA Galaxy was made by the clubs directors, former coach Fabio Capello has revealed in an interview.

The decision was taken because the club management said that he had negotiated with them having already agreed a contract with Los Angeles, Capello told a Spanish sports daily on Wednesday. 

They said that they couldnt count on a player that wasnt going to remain at the club. 

Capello said he had initially decided to stand by the clubs decision. When I work I always wear the club shirt and defend the club in every way I can. 

But a month later the Italian recalled Beckham, who went on to play an important part in helping the club win its first league title in four years. 

Capello said he was aware the club had been trying to recruit Bernd Schuster as his replacement but believed that winning the league would keep him in the job. 

No Milan fans for Genoa match 

 Milan: AC Milan fans will be banned from attending Sundays Serie A opener at promoted Genoa because of fears of violence, officials said on Wednesday. 

The committee for security and public order in Genoa decided the match was too high risk because of worries that some supporters would seek revenge for the fatal stabbing of a Genoa fan at a match between the two sides in 1995. 

Italy has boosted stadium security and tried to crack down on soccer violence after a policeman was killed during riots outside a top-flight match in Catania in February. 

Emerson to return to Italy 

 Madrid: Brazilian midfielder Emerson will return to Italy to play for AC Milan after just one season with Real Madrid. 

The Primera Liga side said on their website (www.realmadrid.com) they had reached an agreement to sell the 31-year-old international to the European champions but did not reveal the fee. 

Milan confirmed the Brazil international had joined the club on their website www.acmilan.com). 

Emerson joined Real Madrid from Juventus for an estimated fee of 16 million euros ($21.56 million) last year after the Italian side were punished with relegation following a match-fixing scandal. 

Dizzying Spurs offer to Ramos 

 Madrid: Sevilla coach Juande Ramos has said he received a dizzying offer to take charge at Tottenham Hotspur but never considered accepting the approach from the English club. 

They made an excellent, dizzying offer, but Im under contract to Sevilla and my decision is to fulfil it, Ramos told a news conference on Wednesday. 

Tottenham, however, denied to have offered the position of manager to anyone whilst Martin Jol has been in the job.

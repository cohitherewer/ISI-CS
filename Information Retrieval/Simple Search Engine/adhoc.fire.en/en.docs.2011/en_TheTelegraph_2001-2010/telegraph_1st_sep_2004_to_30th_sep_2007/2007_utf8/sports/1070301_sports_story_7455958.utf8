The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Coffins are a real burden

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai: The suggestion probably came from Rahul Dravid and the rest, but the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) did well to appoint a travel assistant, Russell Radhakrishnan, for the World Cup. 

After all, neither of the managers (Mohinder Pandove and Sanjay Jagdale) wouldve been able to coordinate the luggage bit. In fact, had the assistant not been around, absolute chaos wouldve been a feature of Team Indias departure. 

The problem? Well, a British Airways stipulation that no one piece of checked-in baggage can exceed 32 kgs. Sounds impressive, but the players were in for a shock when each of the fresh coffins provided by the BCCI weighed all of 18 kgs without even a pair of gloves being put! 

The assistant, therefore, had to meet every player and get his coffin weighed at the team hotel. The specialist batsmen had a real tough time, with most having to pack bats separately. 

Surely, the coffins couldve been made lighter, remarked one of the seniors in the presence of The Telegraph. A pertinent point that. 

Not wanting to leave anything to chance, the assistant even got individual suitcases weighed. I want to avoid any hassle both at the airport here and at Heathrow when we change airlines (British Airways to Air Jamaica), he said. 

The Indians were to fly out in the early hours of Thursday.

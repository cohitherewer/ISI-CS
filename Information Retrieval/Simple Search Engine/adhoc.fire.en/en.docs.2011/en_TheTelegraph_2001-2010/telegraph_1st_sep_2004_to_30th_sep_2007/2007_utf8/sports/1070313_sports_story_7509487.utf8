 Canas ends Federer run

Indian Wells: Three time defending champion Roger Federer was poised to make history at the Pacific Life Open Masters meet, but somebody forgot to tell Guillermo Canas. 

Argentinas Canas ended Federers bid to break the all-time consecutive match winning streak, upsetting the Swiss superstar 7-5, 6-2 in the second round of the $5.3 million hardcourt tournament on Sunday. 

I dreamed about this but I didnt expect it, said Canas, who got into the draw as a lucky loser. (Agencies)

 Symonds out 

of tri-series

Melbourne: A question mark hangs over Australian allrounder Andrew Symonds playing the World Cup after he was ruled out for the remainder of the tri-series with a ruptured biceps tendon which requires surgery. 

Symonds has ruptured the biceps tendon in the right shoulder and will receive surgery probably as early as Sunday to repair the tendon, team doctor Trevor James said. 

Andrew will certainly miss the remainder of the tri-series and will undergo intensive physiotherapy following surgery, he said.

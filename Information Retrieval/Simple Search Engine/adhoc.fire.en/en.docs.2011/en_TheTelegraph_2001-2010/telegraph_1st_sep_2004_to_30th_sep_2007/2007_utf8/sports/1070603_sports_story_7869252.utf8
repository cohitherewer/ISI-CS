 Jeev crashes out

Dublin (US): Jeev Milkha Singh missed the cut after the second round at the Memorial Tournament on Friday. 

The Indian had a second successive 76 for a two-day total of 152. 

Swedens Daniel Chopra made it to the weekend rounds with a par 72 that took his tally to 143 and a tied 41st. 

The cut was set at two-over-par 146. 

Australian golfers dominated the leaderboard with Adam Scott (132) shooting a 62 to lead at 12-under, one stroke ahead of fellow-Aussie Rod Pampling (68). 

Yet another Australian, Aaron Baddeley (68), was two shots behind with American Bubba Watson (68). 

Tiger Woods left himself with a big deficit, 10 shots off the pace after a mediocre 72. 

Jeev started with bogeys on the first and third holes, birdied the eighth, but dropped another shot on 10th. He then eagled the 11th to be at par, but dropped a shot on the 12th. 

The lone birdie on the back nine came on the 14th, before Jeev dropped four shots over the last three holes with bogeys on the 16th and 17th, and a double on the 18th. 

Among Asian players, South Koreas Choi Kyung-ju (70) was at tied 12th.

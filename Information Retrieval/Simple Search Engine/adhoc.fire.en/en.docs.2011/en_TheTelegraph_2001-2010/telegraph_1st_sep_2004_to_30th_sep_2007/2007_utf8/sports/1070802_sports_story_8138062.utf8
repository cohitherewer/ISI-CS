The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India A in total command

New Delhi: Piyush Chawla and Pragyan Ojha picked up two wickets each as India A had Zimbabwe XI on the mat on Day II of the four-day match at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo. 

After posting a mammoth 524 for eight declared thanks to centuries from Parthiv Patel (126), S. Badrinath (103 not out) and Cheteshwar Pujara (100) India A on Tuesday reduced the Zimbabwe side to 67 for five to be in the drivers seat. 

However, captain Mohammed Kaif failed to make any impression and departed after scoring a hard-fought 26. 

The Zimbabweans had a decent beginning as the opening pair of TMK Mawoyo (20) and H Masakadza (24) gathered 45 runs. 

But once Masakadza was removed by left-arm spinner Ojha, the hosts lost two more wickets on the same score.

 Houghton comes in for praise from Indian coaches

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bob Houghton 

New Delhi: Coaches in India have rarely appreciated a foreigner being appointed national coach but quite a few of them are highly impressed with Bob Houghton, especially after Indias fine run in the Nehru Cup. 

So much so, that Subhas Bhowmick, one of Indias most successful coaches in recent times, said he was ready to become an assistant to the British coach. 

I am thoroughly impressed with Indias showings under him, Bhowmick told The Telegraph. I dont like to work under anyone, but wont mind being a deputy to this man. 

Bhowmick, who has two NFL titles under his belt, said it was sheer spirit and approach and not technical abilities that helped India win three of the four matches so far. Technically, the team was not flawless, but Houghton never let the boys go defensive. Against Syria, we were trailing 1-3, yet the boys attacked relentlessly. It was a rare sight in Indian football, Bhowmick said. 

Former national coach Sukhwinder Singh hoped that the federation would keep up the momentum. Houghton has shown us the way. We should be able to cash in on it, felt Sukhwinder. 

Under my coaching, India defeated UAE, who were then 66 ranks above India. We did tremendously well in the World Cup qualifiers in 2001, but no one made an effort to cash in on the success, the JCT coach said. 

This time we shouldnt commit the same mistake. Houghton should be given all the facilities which Indian coaches never received.

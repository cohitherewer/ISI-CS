The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IN THE CITY

 Mike Okoro and Tomba Singh have been asked to pay fat sums of money to Mohun Bagan and JCT, their previous clubs. This was decided at the IFA players status committee meeting on Tuesday evening. 

 In an unprecedented move, Okoro has been asked to cough up Rs 10.2 lakh while, in Tombas case, the amount is Rs 4.3 lakh. The committee heard Tombas version before asking him to pay up money. Tomba, who will be donning the red-and-gold jersey during 2007-08, has agreed to give the money. Mohun Bagan had moved the players status committee, seeking Rs 8.3 lakh from the midfielder in lieu of expenses incurred on his treatment last season. Tomba could hardly play last season because of a knee injury which needed surgery. Okoro, on whom Mohammedan Sporting had banked heavily, played a handful of games before doing the vanishing act. 

 He will have to pay up unless he decides to appeal. Okoro has signed the inter-state transfer papers in favour of JCT.

 The IFA has requested the state sports minister to defer renovation of the Salt Lake Stadium turf till February. The president (Satyabrata Ganguly) and I met Subhas Chakraborty today (Tuesday) and put in the request. He will look into the matter and get back within two days, said IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly. The minister had earlier said that work on the ground would be taken up soon. Since that process will take more than three months, the IFA wont be able to slot matches at the Salt Lake Stadium in the first phase of the CFL Premier Division if the work is done now.

 Mohun Bagan have formed a technical committee comprising former footballers Ashok Chatterjee, Prasun Banerjee, Manas Bhattacharya, Bidesh Bose and Shyamal Banerjee. The committee will report to the football secretary there will be no clash between them and the coach, said club secretary Anjan Mitra. 

 With Carlos Roberto Pereira being satisfied with conditions in Durgapur, Mohun Bagans one-week residential camp will start there on Monday.

 It was decided on Tuesday that Dhiren Dey, who served as secretary for several years, will be conferred the Mohun Bagan Ratna posthumously on July 29.

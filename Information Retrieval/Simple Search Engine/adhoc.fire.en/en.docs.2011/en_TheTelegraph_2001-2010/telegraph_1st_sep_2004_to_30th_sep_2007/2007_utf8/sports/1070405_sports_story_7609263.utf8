 England bowl out Sri Lanka for 235

St Johns: Pacemen Sajid Mahmood and Andrew Flintoff shared seven wickets to help a much-improved England restrict Sri Lanka to 235 all out in their World Cup Super Eight match on Wednesday. 

Mahmood took four for 50 and Flintoff claimed three for 35 to cap Englands clinical display on the field, confounding critics who predicted their formidable rivals would set a target around the 300-mark. 

James Anderson bowled a tidy 10-over spell for 38 runs after skipper Michael Vaughan chose to bowl first on a good pitch. 

Mahmood struck at the other end to remove the dangerous Sanath Jayasuriya for 25 after he played on to the stumps. 

The 37-year-old, making a one-day record 385th appearance began aggressively after scoring a match-winning 115 against hosts West Indies in the previous game on Sunday. 

Flintoff joined the attack to peg Sri Lankan scoring before Mahmood was brought back and had Kumar Sangakkara (17) caught at point with a slow full toss. 

Opener Upul Tharanga top-scored with a patient 62 and added 91 runs for the third wicket with skipper Mahela Jayawardene, who hit 56 off 61 balls. 

However, Vaughan shuffled the bowlers well to stop quick runs and both batsmen fell in quick succession attempting to hit out to reduce Sri Lanka to 175 for four in the 39th over. 

Flintoff forced Tharanga to miscue a pull to Kevin Pietersen at mid-on. Collingwood, who passed a fitness test for a stiff neck, then had Jayawardene caught at deep midwicket. 

Ian Bell ran out Tillakaratne Dilshan (5) with a direct hit and Collingwood took a magnificent diving catch at point to remove Chaminda Vaas (4). 

Sri Lanka managed just 52 runs in the last 10 overs before they were all out off the last ball of the innings with a run out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Samuels issue puts Lankans on alert

 - Visitors to discuss steps to avoid contact with strangers 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Rajkot: Marlon Samuels alleged involvement with a bookie has stumped the cricket fraternity. That apart, it has put the touring Sri Lankans on alert. 

The charge, after all, is that Samuels interacted with the shady character during the West Indies recent tour of India. 

At our next team meeting, well be discussing what steps can be taken to avoid any contact with complete strangers... We cant take a chance, manager Michael Tissera told The Telegraph. 

Speaking in the first floor lounge at Calcutta airport on Friday afternoon, before boarding a flight to Mumbai (and, then, connecting to Rajkot), the former captain added: Weve got some inexperienced cricketers and they probably dont realise the implications of interacting with fans who essentially are strangers... I guess everybody needs to be educated... 

Captain Mahela Jayawardene, who was next to the manager, chipped in with: Now, it seems weve got to stop all contact with fans... Obviously, theres no question of taking phone calls... 

Winner of the International Cricket Councils first Captain of the Year award, presented three months ago, Jayawardene continued: Frankly, in a country like India where there are so many fans, one just cant keep track of who is who... We may soon get to a situation where theres no social interaction anywhere... 

Its not clear how popular Samuels was among contemporaries, but his stock couldnt have got any lower.

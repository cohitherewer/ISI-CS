 Giggs hangs up Welsh boots

Cardiff: Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs retired from international soccer with Wales on Wednesday. 

The 33-year-old Giggs and will play his last and 64th game for Wales on Saturday in a European Championship qualifier against the Czech Republic in Cardiff. 

I have loved playing for my country and I have loved captaining my country, Giggs told a news conference. I think its the right time to do this. It wasnt an easy decision for me. 

Giggs will continue his career at Manchester United, where he is the clubs longest serving player. Despite his success with United, Giggs has never played in a World Cup or European Championship with Wales. The Welsh havent qualified for a major international tournament since the 1958 World Cup. 

Giggs made his Wales debut against Germany in October 1991 at age of 17 years and 321 days. At the time, he was the youngest-ever Wales international. He became captain in 2004 and has scored 12 goals in his Wales career. 

It has been a privilege to have him as my captain, he has always set a terrific example to all the young lads in the squad, Wales coach John Toshack said. We shall certainly miss him. 

British news reports said Giggs made the decision to quit after Wales lost 0-1 to Ireland in a group D Euro 2008 qualifier on March 24. (AP)

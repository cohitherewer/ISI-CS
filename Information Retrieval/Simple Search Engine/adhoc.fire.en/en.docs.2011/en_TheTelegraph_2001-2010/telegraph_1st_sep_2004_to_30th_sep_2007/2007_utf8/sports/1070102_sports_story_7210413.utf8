 Farewells fuel clean sweep resolve

- Fifth Ashes Test 

Sydney: The retirements of Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Justin Langer have added an emotional incentive to Australias bid to win the fifth Ashes Test against England, starting at the Sydney Cricket Ground Tuesday. 

Ricky Pontings Australians were already salivating at the prospect of a rare 5-0 series sweep, but the departure of three of their greatest players has only increased their determination. 

Australias only previous whitewash against their oldest rivals was back in 1920-21 and Ponting said there could be no better way to farewell their famous trio than by emulating that feat in Sydney. 

Theres a lot riding on this game with all the retirements and the possibility of a 5-0 result, Ponting said. 

Its a big game for Australian cricket but we wont be focussed on the result, well be focussed on playing well throughout the game. 

Thats what weve done all summer and if it means we end up winning the game then its going to be a perfect scenario for all these guys. 

Its going to be an emotional Test match with these three guys going, but I dont think that will affect us, Ponting said. 

This weeks Test marks the end of an era in Australian cricket and has evoked concerns of a repeat of the bleak years that followed the simultaneous retirements of Greg Chappell, Dennis Lillee and Rod Marsh from the SCG 23 years ago. 

But McGrath said the trio were all leaving confident in the knowledge that Australian cricket was in safe hands and the stage was set for their perfect farewell. 

Both Shane and Justin are two blokes Ive played most of my career with so its like losing part of the family, McGrath said. 

England captain Andrew Flintoff said the tourists would wait until the morning of the match before finalising their team but were desperate to avoid losing again. 

Its disappointing the way the Ashes have gone but the mood is positive, he said. 

Its Warne, McGrath and Langers last Test match so that is another incentive to do well against legends of the game, but most importantly we dont want to go down 0-5. 

Flintoff has also dismissed reports of a split in the England camp, insisting the team was still united in trying to salvage something from their disastrous Ashes tour of Australia.

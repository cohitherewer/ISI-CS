 Fletcher shouldve acted sooner

 Guest Column

The islands of the West Indies really are like a picture postcard: sunshine, turquoise sea, beaches to die for. These are paradise holiday islands, and Andrew Flintoffs late night in St Lucia shows how easy it is to get sucked into that idea. 

Mind you, it sometimes seems as if a number of England players think they have been on a permanent holiday since they won the Ashes in 2005. 

Over the last couple of days, we have heard that certain players were fined in South Africa for similar offences two years ago. And that Flintoff himself was warned three or four times for drinking in Australia. All of which begs the question why the management waited so long before taking action. It shows a lack of control by the coach and a lack of discipline by the players. 

Duncan Fletcher should have taken tough action much earlier. Can you imagine Brian Clough or Sir Alex Ferguson allowing a player three or four warnings? Once would have been once too often. Thats called discipline, and England dont have it. Winning the Ashes, getting gongs and being feted everywhere has gone to some of the players heads. And since 2005 it is them who have run the show, not the coach. 

At every home and away match we have wives, girlfriends, babies, nannies they go everywhere. Which profession or job do you know where a man takes his family with him to work every day? For the players, cricket should be work fantastic work, of course but not a holiday. Its a bloody job. 

At least Fletcher has finally woken up to what is going on. Better late than never. It might actually do Flintoff and England some good to have this shake-up just a week or so before the start of the Super Eights, which are the main part of the tournament. 

Flintoffs batting was below par throughout the tour of Australia. Bowling is a physical discipline but batting is about concentration, and late nights and heavy drinking will not help. 

The experience of being fined and suspended should have left him a chastened man; from being a national hero, he is now having to deal with public humiliation, and quite right, too. There is nothing wrong with having a drink, but you cannot expect to get away with staying out until 4am that is way beyond the bounds of common sense. While it is unacceptable that he had to be told three or four times, I now expect some improved performances from Englands main man. 

As for matters on the field, Englands biggest problem will be their top three batsmen. Ed Joyce, Michael Vaughan and Ian Bell have scored just a single one-day century between them, and that is not going to win you many games. 

If you want to know how a batting side should line up, then look at the dominant country over the past 10 years. Australia have won the last two World Cups and are the favourites for this one. Their top three are Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden and Ricky Ponting all massively experienced players who regularly pass three figures. On average, these guys score a century every 15 innings. Englands equivalents have made one hundred from a combined total of over 130 matches. 

You have to remember that one-day cricket is a batting game. Almost every rule change since the game was first played internationally in January 1971 has been at the expense of bowlers. So it is not good enough for your top three to make pretty twenties and thirties and then leave it to the middle order to get you out of trouble. 

If England are going to win the World Cup, or even just give a respectable account of themselves, they have to get it into their heads that the first three have to post some big scores and make it easier for those coming in behind. 

Vaughan is an enigma in one-day cricket. He always looks good and comes up with some classic strokeplay but, frankly, opening batsmen who play little cameos dont win any matches. 

If you are dismissed early on by a good ball then so be it. But when you get in and get a start you have to make it count and make a big impact. Opening batsmen should have failures or big scores. 

Vaughans captaincy is outstanding. You can see his brain working as he moves fielders around and makes bowling changes. In my opinion, hes the best captain in world cricket. But when he bats, that brain goes out of the window. 

He bats the same way whatever the surface. Every batsman has to adapt to the state of the pitch and the situation of the match. Vaughan isnt doing that: he needs to engage his brain and start posting big scores. 

None of the teams has an outstanding bowling attack. They can all be taken for runs, especially with small boundaries and heavy bats. For me, the key to winning is responsible, sensible, consistent batting. 

England rely too much on their middle order, Kevin Pietersen, Paul Collingwood and Flintoff. These are all quality players you could say they are the strong point of the team. But how often do they come in with a decent platform to build on? 

Instead, they have got used to having to dig England out of a hole: Collingwood and Flintoff are always coming in with the game in the balance. It wears them down after a while. With Englands one-day team, the rot starts at the top.

 Yousuf hits 79 in rain-marred tie

 Third ODI vs SA 

Port Elizabeth: Mohammed Yousuf scored a stylish 79 as Pakistan were made to work hard for their runs in the third one-day International against South Africa at St Georges Park on Friday. 

Pakistan were 217 for eight when rain stopped play after 47 overs, three short of the end of their innings. 

The innings was in contrast to Pakistans run spree in Durban Wednesday when they hammered 351 for four to set up a series-levelling win. 

Yousuf and Shoaib Malik (41) put on 91 for the fifth wicket. They took Pakistan from a shaky 71 for four to a position where they could launch an assault. But both men were out in quick succession. 

Big-hitting Shahid Afridi, who made an unbeaten 77 off 35 balls in Durban, fell quickly for eight but Abdul Razzaq and Azhar Mahmood put on 41 off 38 balls for the eighth wicket before Razzaq was caught behind off Andrew Hall one ball before play was halted. 

Hall, who replaced fast bowler Andre Nel, took four for 31 with his medium pace. 

Makhaya Ntini, who took three for 53, gave South Africa an early advantage when he dismissed opening batsmen Kamran Akmal and Imran Nazir in the space of three balls in the sixth over. Both fell to injudicious pull shots.

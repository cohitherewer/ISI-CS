 WI board to launch investigation

London: The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) will hold an inquiry into claims that Marlon Samuels passed on vital team information to an alleged bookie during the teams four-match one-day series in India last month. 

A WICB spokesman has said that the board will take action consistent with the law and the inquiry will involve all agencies concerned, including the West Indies Players Association of which Samuels is a member. 

Whatever we do will be fair, honest and transparent. Whatever action we have to take consistent with the law, we will take it, Tony Deyal, WICB corporate services manager, was quoted as saying Friday. 

We will have an investigation and take whatever action is appropriate and consistent with the ICC regulations and our own reputation for probity. 

Anything that we are going to do will have three major parts to it. 

Meanwhile, Samuels on Friday found support from captain Brian Lara who said the entire team was behind him in this hour of crisis. 

Lara said he was unable to contact Samuels till now, but wanted him to know that he had the full support of the entire team. 

I have been unable to contact the WICB or more importantly, Marlon Samuels, as the report emerged while I was in London overnight, Lara was quoted as saying by a news channel. 

Ultimately, I would like to speak to Marlon to let him know that he has the full support of myself and other players. He needs to stay focused on things he can control. We have a World Cup to win, he said.

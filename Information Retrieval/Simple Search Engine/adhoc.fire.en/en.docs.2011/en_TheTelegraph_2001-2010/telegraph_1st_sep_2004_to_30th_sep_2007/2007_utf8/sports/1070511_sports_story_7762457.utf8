 Dampest of damp squibs

Henry Winter

A sporting fixture built up all season with the anticipation levels of the Olympics carried all the seismic significance of the Chelsea Pensioners weekly whist drive. Yet a non-event a goalless draw (as reported in Wednesdays late City edition) that proved the dampest of damp squibs still managed to launch the odd rocket or two. 

Chelsea had lost their title, but clearly not their determination. Good blood and bad was spilt here. Joe Cole, his cheek cut in pursuit of the ball, even had to change his stained shirt, but the abiding memory was of the ill-will between two teams who fought tooth and nail for the Premiership and will soon collide again in the FA Cup final at Wembley. After the guard of honour, the running of the gauntlet. 

Manchester United, who delighted in taking Chelseas crown, were largely unrecognisable, such was the number of changes made by Sir Alex Ferguson, but their commitment was unmistakable. 

Chelsea, using more familiar faces as they extended their unbeaten home league record to 62 games, also unleashed some gruesome tackles, notably John Obi Mikels airborne raid on Eagles legs, an offence that had an apoplectic Ferguson on the field remonstrating with Graham Poll. 

Jose Mourinho was taunted by a hugely vocal away contingent glorying in their Premiership success. United supporters had waited for four years for this moment, and they certainly revelled in the return of the Premiership trophy they feel was only on loan to Chelsea. 

Inside the Bridge, John Terry cannot have imagined his Premiership season would peter out with him organising a guard of honour to hail Fangzhuo Dong, Kieran Lee and Tomasz Kuszczak. 

Uniteds reserve goalkeeper impressed early on, thwarting Wright-Phillips from close range after a high-speed Chelsea break involving Salomon Kalou and Mikel. . 

The atmosphere became even more animated when Alan Smith flew in on Mikel, who retaliated shockingly on Eagles. It was late, nasty and deserving of red, but Mikel escaped with only a flash of Polls yellow. 

Fergusons second string sought to claim some legitimate revenge, and when Smith hooked the ball into the box, Gabby Heinze fired wide. 

Chelsea rallied, Claude Makelele shooting wide and the typically lion-hearted Terry attempting a volley, but the match was beginning to acquire a testimonial air, even after Mikel had inflamed passions. 

Fearing suspensions eating into his injury-plagued squad, Mourinho sensibly removed Mikel at the break, pre-empting the possibility of the talented midfielder risking another ban-bringing caution. 

Essien was fortunate not to concede a penalty when catching Eagles, whose own blood began to heat, briefly boiling over when he tore into Wright-Phillips. The England winger recovered and almost forced the breakthrough midway through the second period, running on to Coles clever pass and driving the ball straight at Kuszczak. 

Back came Chelsea again, Kalou firing in low only for Kuszczak to push the ball away. 

Dong departed, replaced by Wayne Rooney, whose last appearance here ended with a snapped metatarsal. Sadly, young Scott Sinclair suffered that fate, the promising winger cutting a disconsolate figure as he limped off. Chelsea-United games should carry a health warning. Wembley will be lively.

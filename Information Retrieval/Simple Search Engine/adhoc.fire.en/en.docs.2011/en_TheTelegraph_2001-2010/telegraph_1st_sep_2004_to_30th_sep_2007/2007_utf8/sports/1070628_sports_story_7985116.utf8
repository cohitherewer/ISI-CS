 Feroz wins 

in Malaysia

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: City golfer Feroz Ali won the Proton Masters title in Terengganu (Malaysia), according to information reaching here. 

The 37-year-old Feroz returned cards of 69, 68 and 69 to finish 10-under in the Malaysian Tour event. 

Local golfers Mohammed Rashid Ismail and Shaifubari Muda went nine-under at the par-72 course to tie for second place. I am obviously very happy, said Feroz after returning to the city on Wednesday. My next tournament will be the Asian Tour meet in Johar Baru (Malaysia) in August.

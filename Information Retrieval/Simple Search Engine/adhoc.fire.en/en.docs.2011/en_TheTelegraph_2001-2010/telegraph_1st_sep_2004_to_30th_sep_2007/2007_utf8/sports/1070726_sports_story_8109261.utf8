The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Britain may pull out too

Karachi: Pakistans hopes of hosting the Champions Trophy mens hockey tournament received another jolt on Wednesday as Britain, the replacement team for Australia, also showed their reluctance to tour the country. 

Khalid Mahmood, secretary of the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF), said: The problem is that the International Hockey Federation has now indicated to us unofficially that even Great Britain are reluctant about playing in Pakistan again because of security fears, he said. 

Media reports have said Spain might also pull out of the tournament.

 Sunitha guides India to win 

Christchurch: Sunitha Rao helped India recover from an early deficit and edge out hosts New Zealand 2-1 in their third rubber of the Fed Cup Asia-Oceania Zone qualifiers at Wilding Park here on Wednesday. 

After Shikha Uberois 6-7 (5-7), 3-6 loss to local favourite Sacha Jones in the opening match, Sunitha kept alive Indias chances with her impressive 6-4, 6-2 win over New Zealands top player Leanne Baker in the second singles. 

The US-based 21-year-old, who got the chance to represent India only after Sania Mirza was sidelined with a knee injury, later teamed up with Shikha to clinch a tough doubles match against Leanne and Dianne Hollands 2-6, 7-6 (7-1), 6-1. 

The hard fought rubber was Indias toughest in the tournament so far as they had earlier blanked Kazakhstan and Jordan with consummate ease. 

In the first singles, Shikha started well, racing to a 4-0 lead before things went horribly wrong for her and Sacha managed to stretch it to tie-breaker before running away with the set. 

Shikha was even more disappointing in the second set and her erratic display allowed the New Zealander to win the set and put her side one up in the tie. 

Fortunately for India, Sunitha restored parity with her comfortable win over Leanne. After winning the first set 6-4, Sunitha put up an even more improved show in the second and dropped two games before wrapping up the match. 

With the doubles becoming the decider for them, the pressure began to show on Shikha and Sunitha as they lost 2-6 in the opening set. 

But to their credit, they scripted a remarkable comeback after the initial jolt and kept their cool to clinch the second set tie-breaker to stay afloat. 

India will next take on Chinese Taipei in their final pool B encounter on Thursday, which would also decide the qualifier for the group finals to be played on Saturday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 An amazing day: Fleming

 - We cant afford to panic and start making wholesale changes, says Hussey 

Auckland: New Zealand batted superbly to register a thrilling five-wicket victory over Australia on Sunday. 

The home side successfully chased down Australias record Eden Park total of 336 for four with eight balls to spare to win the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy for the first time and condemn the Australians to a fourth straight defeat in nine days. 

It was an amazing day, great for the game and great for us to get across the line in a big scoring match, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming told a news conference. 

Weve fallen short numerous times against Australia. It was great to feel the excitement in the stands. 

South Africa, who beat Pakistan 3-1 in a recent home series, become the first team to replace Australia at the top of the ICC rankings since they were introduced in October 2002. 

The Australians have been under fire for their inexplicable form slump since reaching and losing the tri-series final at home to England, but Hussey said they were still on track for the World Cup. 

Its not ideal but I can say the spirit is okay. We cant afford to panic and start making wholesale changes, Hussey said. 

We have to trust our personnel, trust our own games and trust each other. I know if we keep working hard well be fine. 

I know big totals being chased down is an area of concern and were going to have to get better at it, but I still think weve got the right people in the team and in the squad. 

Craig McMillan increased the run-rate with a blazing 52 off just 30 balls before Fulton and Brendon McCullum finished off the run-chase, with the pair slamming 11 runs off the penultimate over from Glenn McGrath to seal the win. 

The Australians, missing five of their frontline players including skipper Ricky Ponting and deputy Adam Gilchrist, looked to have done enough to win the match after setting a record total for a one-day International at the compact venue. 

On a ground like this youre going to need every run youve got, Hussey said. 

I actually dont think we did too badly with the ball and in the field.A few things didnt go our way, we had a few very close shaves and on another day they might go our way.

 Shoaib recalled

- Yousuf, Malik ruled out of Test vs SA 

Karachi: Pakistani cricket authorities have decided to rush fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar to South Africa to join the team before the first Test in Johannesburg which starts Thursday. 

Akhtar, who was last month cleared of a doping offence, was being sent to South Africa as young pacer Umar Gul had been ruled out for two to three weeks with an ankle injury, a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official said on Monday. 

Gul has been ruled out and the team management sent a request to the selectors to rush a replacement, Ehsan Malik, the boards communications director said. 

Akhtar would fly out on Tuesday, Malik said. 

There is a problem with the flights schedule or he would have left immediately, one board source said. 

Pakistan have also lost senior batsman Mohammed Yousuf and allrounder Shoaib Malik for the opening Test. 

Yousuf has opted out owing to personal reasons and Malik has been advised to take two weeks rest to recover from an ankle injury. 

Shoaib, Pakistans most senior bowler with 165 Test and 208 one-day wickets, was not picked for the Test series as the selectors said he needed to regain his match fitness and form. 

He and fellow pacer Mohammed Asif were cleared of having intentionally taken a banned substance, nandrolone, by an appeals commission of the board after they had earlier been banned for two years and one year. 

Meanwhile, a senior PCB official said Gul could face an inquiry if it was confirmed he hid the ankle injury when the team was being selected for the South Africa tour. 

The official said that Gul had not been able to bowl because of his injury in the three-day game being held in Kimberly. 

He will be examined by professionals in Johannesburg before the first Test begins from Thursday. And if it is confirmed he has carried the ankle injury then it is professional dishonesty and we cant accept that from any player, he said.

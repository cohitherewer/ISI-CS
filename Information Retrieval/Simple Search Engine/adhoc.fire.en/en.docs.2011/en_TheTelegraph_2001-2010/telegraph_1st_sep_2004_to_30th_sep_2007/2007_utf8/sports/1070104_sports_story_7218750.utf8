The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ive always had confidence in my technique, says Karthik 

Stand-in Team India wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik, who did a wonderful job as opener on Tuesday, interacted with the Media on Wednesday.. 

The following are excerpts 

Rahul (Dravid) had asked me to be prepared for opening the night before, but it was only in the morning that he confirmed I would... I see myself as a team man and will always do whats required by the management... One must be unselfish... 

Opening was challenging and doing well (getting 63) against big names like (Makhaya) Ntini and (Shaun) Pollock has boosted my confidence even more... Of course, Ive always had confidence in my technique... Have trusted it... Hopefully, Im going to keep getting better... 

As the South Africans have lost one wicket, its difficult to say how many theyll be getting... Theres quite a bit of rough and Anil Kumble is going to be a big factor...

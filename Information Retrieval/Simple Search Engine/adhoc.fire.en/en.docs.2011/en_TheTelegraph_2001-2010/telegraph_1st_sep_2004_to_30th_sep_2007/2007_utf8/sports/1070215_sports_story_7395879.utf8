Calcutta: Its grit that prevailed over resistance and perseverance that paid off for India goalkeeper Subrata Pal, who emerged the hero in Indias 5-2 penalty shoot-out win over Myanmar in the Olympic qualifier on Wednesday. The win enabled India book a ticket to Jordan, where they play their second round matches against Iraq, North Korea, and the winners of Turkmenistan and Thailand. 

With 1-0 up till the stoppage time, India conceded the equaliser despite Pals desperate attempts to save in a goalpost melee twice in succession. But even the last-minute goal couldnt prevent Pal to put even better show at the need of the hour. 

Pals moment of glory finally arrived in the penalty shoot-out as the cool customer fended off two strikes from Myo Min Tun and Si Thu Win, conceding just one (off Khin Maung Tun). The men-in-blue settled the issue through four successful attempts from Sunil Kumar, Debabrata Roy, Nanjangub Shivananju Manju and Manjit Singh. 

Finally Manjit had some share of luck in the 40th minute. C. Sushilkumar Singh lost control over the ball as he tumbled near the goalpost but the Myanmar defender, Yaza Win Theins pass was intercepted by Manjit, who bulged the net from close. 

In the ensuing shoot-out, India, egged on by a sparse support, did not falter even once. For a moment the third strike by captain Manju seemed that the issue is settled. Having missed their first two chances, Mynamars Tun did not falter in the third as all eyes were on Indias Manjit to clinch it on the fourth attempt. 

In a perfect climax to the two-hour odd match, Manjit planted the final nail in the coffin as the Indians erupted into celebration, with a somersault-act from Subrata. 

In the second round, India have been clubbed with Iraq, North Korea and winners of Turkmenistan versus Thailand tie.

 Anand well placed

Mexico City: Viswanathan Anand would be aiming for a complete rout when he takes on Levon Aronian of Armenia in the ninth round of the World Chess Championship here. 

The Indian ace has displayed fine technique so far and it looks he is set to regain the world crown he won last in 2000. 

According to experts, Anand will just need a couple of victories more to win the championship and he looks in fine fettle to achieve them if the games thus far are indication. The Tiger from Madras as he is fondly referred to, will look forward to his second triumph over Aronian here after having beaten him earlier in the third-round clash. The championship is being played on a double round basis between eight players. 

After the first eight rounds Anand is on 5.5 points, a half-point ahead of nearest contender Boris Gelfand of Israel. Interestingly, both these players happen to be the oldest players in the championship at 37 and 39 years, respectively. 

While the experts rule out a Gelfand victory, defending champion Vladimir Kramnik remains the biggest threat for Anand in their opinion despite being a full point behind the Indian with only six games to come. 

It depends, Kramnik will have to win some games and with a little luck he can be right there, also he is known to peak towards the end only, opined a Grandmaster. While Kramnik is sole third, the choices to pick a winner other than him, Gelfand and Anand are almost non existent at this point. (PTI)

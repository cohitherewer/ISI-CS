 Dempo in semis

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Ludhiana: Dempo Sports Club eased into the Federation Cup semis with a facile 2-0 win over Churchill Brothers on Monday evening. The NFL champions will come up against Mahindra United on Wednesday. 

Churchill found themselves in arrears in the 14th minute when Nigerian striker Ranty Martins found the mark. Churchill plunged into deeper trouble when goalkeeper Vinay Singh was given marching orders in the 17th minute for handling the ball. 

Substitute goalkeeper Lalit Thapa saved a Chidi penalty kick with a fine dive to his left. Thapa, however, had no answer to a Chidi effort four minutes later. It was a fine move initiated by Clifford Miranda on the left.

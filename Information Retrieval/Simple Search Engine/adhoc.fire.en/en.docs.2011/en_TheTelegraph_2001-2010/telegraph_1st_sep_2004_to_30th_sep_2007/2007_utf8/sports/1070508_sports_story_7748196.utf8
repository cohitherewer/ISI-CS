 Pak vs Korea game stopped by power cut

Ipoh: The Pakistan versus Korea group B match in the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup Hockey Tournament which came to a dramatic halt eight minutes from half-time following a power shutdown will be completed on Wednesday. 

Teams were tied 2-2 at the time of the stoppage after Tariq Aziz (fourth) and Imran Muhammad (13th) scored for Pakistan and Kang Moon Kweon (ninth) and Jeong Yun Sang (24th) for Korea. 

Though power was restored after nearly 30 minutes, two of the four floodlight towers were still not functioning to capacity. And it was decided to call off the match. 

Later, the tournament committee met the team managers and decided to continue the game on Wednesday at 4.30pm. The teams will play off the remaining eight minutes and then the 35 minutes of the game. 

Meanwhile, a late goal by Argentinas Lucas Rafael Rossi knocked China out of the meet. Rossis 63rd minute strike gave Argentina a 3-2 win and all but guaranteed the South Americans a spot in the semi-finals. 

It was Argentinas second victory in the four-team group A following their 1-0 verdict against Australia on Sunday night. (PTI)

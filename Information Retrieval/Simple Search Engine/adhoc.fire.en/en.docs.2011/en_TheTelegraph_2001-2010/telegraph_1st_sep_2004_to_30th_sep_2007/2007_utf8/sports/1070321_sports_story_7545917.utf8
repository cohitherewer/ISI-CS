The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We have the firepower to win it: Murali

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

 Muttiah Muralidharan and Sanath Jayasuriya 

Port of Spain: The Sri Lankan players had a one-on-one with the media at the Hilton on Monday. The following are excerpts from what they told The Telegraph during the open session: 

SANATH JAYASURIYA 

 On whether he will be the star 

 in this World Cup 

It is difficult to say now. I try to do well in any tournament, not this particular one. I want to perform every time I play for my country. 

 On Herschelle Gibbs six 

 sixes 

It is difficult. You cant expect the batsman to go out there and get those runs each time. 

 On Indias shocking loss 

 to Bangladesh 

Part of the game. One-day cricket is very unpredictable. Whoever does well on that particular day will win. 

 On whether he has set any personal 

 goals for this World Cup 

I just want to finish it on a high. I am enjoying it. I am working hard on my game. 

 On the strong reaction in India 

 and Pakistan following defeats 

Its a little unfortunate. Nobody wants to go out there and lose. Players want to do well for their country. But I guess thats how things are in our part of the world. Its different in Sri Lanka though, fans havent gone to that extreme. 

 On Sri Lanka being touted as 

 the favourites 

Yeah, if you see the last six-eight months, we have been doing well. That doesnt mean we are the favourites. We have to work hard. We need to win our games against Bangladesh and India to go through to the next round. 

 On Woolmers death, and 

 if the stress and pressures claimed his life 

No, everybody is under some kind of pressure to perform. It is unfortunate My thoughts are with his family. The loss had been some kind of a setback for him. 

MUTTIAH MURALIDHARAN 

 On his and Lankas chances 

 this time 

Im still fit and hopefully looking good. When we played in 1996 we were young and inexperienced, the same as this side. Hopefully this team can repeat the same feat. 

 On Bangladesh and Dav Whatmore 

He is a great coach. He did wonders for our country. He still has that capability. He gave you some surprise last week. Bangladesh are no longer minnows. They have been playing for seven years. They should have the experience 

 On the similarities between 

 the current Bangladesh side and the Sri Lanka of old 

They will struggle in Test cricket because they dont have bowlers who can take wickets. But in one-day cricket they will survive because they can do away with bowling just 10 overs. I dont want to boast, but they dont have bowlers of the calibre of myself or Vaas or somebody with Malingas firepower. 

 On his bowling 

When I was eleven, I was a mediumpacer. I took to spin at 13. I am going up the ladder still. Last year was my best because I took 96 wickets in 12 Tests. Hopefully I can deliver for one or two years more. 

 On taking 1000 wickets 

It is very difficult. You have to get another 300 wickets. Another four years at least, 40-45 Tests. 

 On Sri Lankas chances 

The team playing well on the day will win. Here and there upsets can happen. We have the experience and we have the bowlers but we have to deliver. In paper you can have so many talented players but if they dont deliver it means nothing. 

 On his future plans 

I may play the next World Cup because Id be 38 then. Spinners can go on till 40. Mentally and physically, I am fit. I would like to play the next World Cup because it will be on home soil. That gives us a pretty good chance. Last time it happened we won. You never know what is going to happen in future. 

 On retirement plans 

It is something you cant pre-plan. You cant say I will retire in one or two years from now. Suddenly you decide that is it. I cant go through this anymore. 

CHAMINDA VAAS 

 On what has kept him going 

 these years 

Its very simple concentrate on what you are doing especially if you are a bowler. Get your basics right and do your training well. When the going gets tough, just focus on the basics and get along with the game. 

 On Lasith Malinga 

He is going to be very good bowler in the years to come. He always takes my advice and is training hard. 

 On his future plans 

I will play as long as I am fit and going. This will be my last World Cup but I will play another two years. 

MARAVAN ATAPATTU 

 On his plans 

I am very happy to be here and lucky too. I did have my doubts after missing few matches because of injuries. With the introduction of Power Plays the game has changed a lot. 

 On the favourites tag 

I think we are next to India! We have very good youngsters in the side which gives us good balance. That is important in this sort of a tournament. 

UPUL THARANGA 

 On opening with Jayasuriya 

Things become very easy when he is there at the other end. You can just concentrate on playing your natural game. He has been a big help. His experience helps me tackle tough situations. 

 On Tom Moodys contribution 

He has helped me a lot with my batting. I have improved a lot in the last 20 months.

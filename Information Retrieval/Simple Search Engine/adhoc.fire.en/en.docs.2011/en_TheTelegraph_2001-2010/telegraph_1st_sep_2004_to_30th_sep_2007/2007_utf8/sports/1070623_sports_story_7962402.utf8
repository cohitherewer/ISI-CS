 Collingwood named ODI captain

London: Durham batsman Paul Collingwood was named on Friday as Englands new one-day captain, taking over the reins from his friend and Test captain Michael Vaughan. 

Collingwood, 31, takes up the captaincy after Vaughan relinquished it after four years on Monday. 

England also announced the squad for their two Twenty/20 matches against the West Indies on June 28 and 29, and the three one-day internationals against West Indies on July 1, 4 and 7. 

Englands chairman of selectors David Graveney said: The selectors believe that Paul Collingwoods experience and performances in the one-day game make him the ideal candidate to lead the side. 

He has been a key member of the one-day team for a while and we believe he is ready to take on the additional responsibility of captaincy. 

The new skipper warned the West Indies and India to expect a more aggressive opponents when they face his side over the next three months. 

Collingwood, whose men host India in August and September, said he wanted more fight from England, who had a fairly dismal World Cup. 

Weve played our best one-day cricket when weve been aggressive, taken the attack to the opposition, been positive when we go out to bat and had plenty of self-belief, he said.

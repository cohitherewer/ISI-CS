 Federer faces moment of truth

Roger Federers decisive victory over nemesis Rafael Nadal in the Hamburg Masters has given him pole position for the French Open. 

A feature of Federers earlier matches was his up-and-down form, which resulted in defeats at the hands of lower-ranked players like Canas (twice) and Volandri. 

In Hamburg, Federer managed to stay afloat till the final, edging out far lower ranked players in three-setters. Then, after losing the first set in the final to Nadal, Federer produced a burst of sustained brilliance to win 10 games in a row and a 6-0 final set. It put an end to Nadals record run of 81 consecutive claycourt victories. 

It was as if someone had waved a magic wand and transformed a carthorse into a sleek thoroughbred. Federer exorcised the smouldering differences with coach Tony Roche and broke loose with a bang. He has won six Grand Slam titles under Roches tutelage, but their relationship had reached such a state that Federer said: The situation with Tony had become really complex because all of a sudden we just didnt talk anymore. 

It was a joy to see the broad smile back on a resurgent Federers face. The unforced errors had vanished. A strong, new Federer emerged with his old magic intact, and Nadal no longer seemed to be his nemesis. 

Federer has been preparing meticulously for Roland Garros and has no illusions of an easy passage to the final. He said: Of course I have just beaten Nadal, of course I have just won Hamburg, but the toughest part is still ahead. Its important to play down your chances a bit. 

Federer is reported to have been practising with the left-handed French No. 1 junior, Jonathan Eysseric. The higher bounce on the French courts will make things more difficult for Federer. Though Nadals confidence must have been shaken, he is sure to strike back with renewed vigour. 

Great rivalries raise sport to its highest level. A Federer-Nadal final, with their contrasting styles and personalities, could produce an unforgettable match. For Federer, the 2007 French Open will be the moment of truth. Victory will put him alongside Don Budge and Rod Laver, the only two men to hold four Grand Slam titles at the same time. 

The absence of the fiery but injury-prone Scot, Andy Murray, will be a setback for British hopes. Murray damaged a ligament in his right wrist and has been forced to withdraw. 

His American coach, Brad Gilbert, has taken him up the ranking ladder to No. 11. Gilbert was appointed by the Lawn Tennis Association at an annual fee of 7,50000 (approximately Rs 6.5 crore). In Murrays absence the British will have to be content with Fred Perrys statue at Wimbledon and a patched-up Henman. 

Sania Mirza, the lone Indian flag bearer in the singles, soldiers on. Two first-round defeats in the singles in low-rated tournaments show that she is nowhere near her best form. Her victories in the doubles will give her much-needed practice and help her to sharpen her game for the singles. 

However, the French Open seems to have come too soon for her and it is unlikely that she will be able to pull off anything spectacular in the singles. 

One hopes that Sania can stay injury free and bring her game to peak level for the fast grass at Wimbledon that suits her game. 

The old warhorses, Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi, keep motoring along in their quest for more Grand Slam titles in the mens and mixed doubles. How nice it would be if they pick up one more Grand Slam title each.

Ipoh: India survived a Chinese penalty corner blitz to register a 5-4 win over the Asian Games silver medallists for their first victory in group A league in the 16th Sultan Azlan Shah Cup hockey tournament here on Sunday. 

In a bizarre match that saw 14 penalty corners being awarded, eight to China and six to India, besides two penalty strokes, India just about managed to cling to a slender lead after falling in arrears in the fourth minute. 

China kept India on tenterhooks by converting three of their eight penalty corners through Yang Yu (4th), Yi Song (20th) and Hui Ren Hu (37th). 

However, the Indians replied in fashion. V. Ramachandra Raghunath (19th, 43rd) flicked home two penalty corners after Prabhjot Singh (5th) had scored the equaliser. Rajpal Singh (35th) and Bimal Lakra (60th) converted a penalty stroke each to settle the issue, though China pulled one back through Yi Song in the 64th minute. 

Indian coach Joaquim Carvalho had dubbed it a grudge match in the light of Chinas 3-2 win in the Doha Asian Games last year. While it took the Indians two goals to figure out the Chinese penalty corner variations, they looked superior side when in flow. It was the Chinese man-to-man marking that denied the Indians more success. 

In another group A match, a 47th minute penalty corner conversion by Lucas Rafael Rossi powered Argentina to a 1-0 win over Olympic champions and world No. 2 Australia. 

Malaysia made the best of good fortune and scrambled to a 2-0 win over Canada for their first win in group B. (PTI)

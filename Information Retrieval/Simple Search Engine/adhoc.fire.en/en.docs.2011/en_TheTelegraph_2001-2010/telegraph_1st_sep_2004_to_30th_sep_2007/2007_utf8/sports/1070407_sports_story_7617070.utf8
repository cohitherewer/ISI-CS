 India share honours with Kazakhstan 

Almaty: Rohan Bopanna marked his return to the Davis Cup with an emphatic win as India held Kazakhstan 1-1 on Day I of the Asia-Oceania (group I) relegation play-off on Friday. 

Bopanna, who skipped the first round tie under controversial circumstances, defeated Dmitry Makeyev 6-2, 6-1, 6-2 in the opening singles at the Baganashil Sports Complex. 

I did not give him (Makeyev) any chance to get into the match and stayed on top throughout, the 26-year-old Bangalorean said after the match. 

Kazakhstans No.1 player Alexey Kedriouk then pulled one back for the hosts with a hard-fought 6-4, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (7-2) win over Karan Rastogi. Captain Leander Paes said serving made the difference between Bopanna and Rastogi. 

Rohan served well and his opponent was a bit inexperienced. Karans serving let him down a bit on big points while Kedriouk served big, he said.

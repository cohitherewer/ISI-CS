 John Terry in his comeback game on Wednesday 

London: Chelsea beat Manchester City 1-0 on Wednesday to come within six points of English Premier League leaders Manchester United. 

Frank Lampard converted a penalty in the 28th minute for his 20th goal of the season after winger Salomon Kalou was fouled by defender Micah Richards. Chelsea controlled possession for the remainder of the game to send Manchester City to their fifth straight defeat. 

In the other Premier League game on Wednesday, Arsenal beat Aston Villa 1-0 on a goal by Vassiriki Diaby in the 10th minute to move past Liverpool into third place. 

Manchester United lead the standings with 72 points, while Chelsea improved to 66. Arsenal have 55 points, two more than Liverpool. 

We will be taking it one game at a time, Chelsea defender John Terry said. Chelsea is seeking their third title in as many years. 

For the second time in a week, Kalou was instrumental in the result. After scoring a late equaliser to earn Chelsea a 3-3 draw with Tottenham in Sundays FA Cup quarter final, on Wednesday he out-manoeuvred Richards to draw a clear foul. 

Lampard confidently put his penalty into the left corner for the only goal needed. 

Chelsea welcomed back captain Terry following an absence of more than two weeks after being kicked in the head during the Blues League Cup final victory on February 25. His presence solidified a defence that had allowed four goals in two matches. 

He was one of four changes from Sundays line-up against Tottenham. Up front, Ukraines Andriy Shevchenko was kept on the substitutes bench after injuring his left ankle in training on Tuesday. And, this time, standout forward Didier Drogba performed below par.Manchester City havent won in the league since new years day and has fallen from mid-table to 17th place, one above relegation but six points ahead of 18th-placed charlton. 

Arsenals victory restored some confidence after being eliminated from the English League Cup, FA Cup and Champions League in 11 days. 

From the edge of the area, Diaby inadvertently deflected a shot from Julio Baptista and wrong-footed goalie Thomas Sorensen for the goal.

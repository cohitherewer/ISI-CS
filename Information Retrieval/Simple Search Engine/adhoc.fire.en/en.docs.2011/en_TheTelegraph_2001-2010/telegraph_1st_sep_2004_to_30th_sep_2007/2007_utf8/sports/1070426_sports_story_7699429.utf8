The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Leader who never felt insecure

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Stephen Fleming has quit the one-day captaincy with a hollow feeling, but New Zealand have much to thank him for. 

For moulding even mediocre cricketers into highly competitive ones... Allowing naturally gifted players like Shane Bond to express themselves... For encouraging the Daniel Vettoris to develop leadership skills... Giving respectability to the underdogs tag... 

Its a long list. 

At a time when many are reflecting on Flemings highs and lows, one is tempted to recall what the 1996 World Cup-winning captain, Arjuna Ranatunga, told The Telegraph just weeks ago: Its with good reason that most regard Fleming as the No.1 captain... He has been in the seat for a decade, which is remarkable... Its a recognition of his leadership as there are players who could wear the captains hat... 

Statistically, Fleming does figure reasonably high, whatever the yardstick. However, his contribution goes beyond the success percentage in ODIs (44-plus overall and 51-plus in the last five years). 

In time to come, Fleming will actually be best remembered for building a leadership group within the team. Vettori, the current vice-captain and most likely successor, has been the top beneficiary. To an extent, somebody like Jacob Oram too. 

Vettori acknowledged as much during a one-on-one not very long ago. 

Obviously, Fleming encouraged potential leaders as he never felt insecure himself. Amazing, for this is an era when most captains feel threatened if the dressing room space has to be shared with a predecessor! 

Sure, captains are around in plenty, but few qualify as leaders. 

Vettori may do better but, right now, Flemings decision has come as a double blow for New Zealand. It couldnt have got darker for the Black Caps.

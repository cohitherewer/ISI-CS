 Diego update

Buenos Aires: Diego Maradona is expected to remain hospitalised for more than a week while doctors treat health problems ascribed to excess alcohol consumption, overeating and smoking. 

Routine tests detected some alterations affecting Maradonas liver, his personal physician Alfredo Cahe said Saturday, but he expected those liver functions would become normal in the next few days. Cahe added Maradona remained stable. (AP)

 Wenger to remain

London: Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood has reassured fans that manager Arsene Wenger has a good relationship with the board despite the shock departure of vice-chairman David Dein on Wednesday. 

Dein left the club after 23 years citing irreconcilable differences with the rest of the board. However, I believe that the relationship Arsene has with the rest of the board is good, Hill-Wood said. (Reuters)

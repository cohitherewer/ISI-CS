 Jeev Milkha carrying a billion hopes

Augusta: Jeev Milkha Singh would be carrying an entire countrys hopes when he launches begin his campaign at the Augusta Masters on Thursday. I am still an ambassador for a billion people. And that is a responsibility in some senses, he said. 

Coming to what he calls the Mecca of golf, Jeev has played two practice rounds. This is place has so many traditions, and yet it is so friendly. No wonder, they all say, you come to the masters once and you are hooked for life, he said. 

Jeev, who won four titles in 2006, goes into the Masters with the knowledge that he has played all four rounds in both his previous appearances at the US Open. That is a nice feeling to have, he said. 

Grouped with Ben Crane and Shaun Micheel, Jeev will become the first Indian to tee off at the Masters. He will also be the first Indian to compete in all four majors this season. 

This is the dream I have had ever since I picked up a golf club and got to know of the Masters. In India, we often talk of the British Open, but the Masters gives you goose pimples, said Jeev. 

The focus over the next four days will be on the Tiger Woods-Phil Mickelson duel. None else has won this title in the last four years. While Woods won in 2003 and 2005, Mickelson did so in 2004 and 2006. 

Mickelson begins the defence of his title in a group with world No. 3 Adam Scott of Australia mid-morning. World No. 1 Woods, aiming for a fifth green jacket, tees off third from last in a group with Briton Paul Casey and Australian Aaron Baddeley. 

Former champion Vijai Singh, who along with Woods is the only twice winner on Tour this year, will play in the penultimate group. (Agencies)

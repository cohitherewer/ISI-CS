 SA tail wags after Asifs 5

Port Elizabeth: South Africas tail wagged effectively after Mohammed Asif took five wickets for Pakistan on the third day of the second Test on Sunday. 

The home team totalled 331 in their second innings before Pakistan, chasing 191 to win, reached the close on eight for nought. 

Asif bowled with pace and accuracy to take five for 76 from 38 overs. 

South Africa lost five wickets for 95 runs before fighting back with a last-wicket stand of 41 by Andre Nel and Makhaya Ntini. Jacques Kallis top-scored with 91. 

The hosts resumed on 115 for three and Kallis and Ashwell Prince took their fourth-wicket partnership to 56 before Prince was trapped lbw for 22 by leg-spinner Danish Kaneria. 

Herschelle Gibbs helped Kallis add 78 for the fifth wicket but Gibbs (40) edged Asif to Younis Khan at second slip after lunch.

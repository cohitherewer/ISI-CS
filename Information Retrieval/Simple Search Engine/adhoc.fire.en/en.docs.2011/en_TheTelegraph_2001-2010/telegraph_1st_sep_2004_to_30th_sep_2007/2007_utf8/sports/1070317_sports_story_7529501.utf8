 Irish captain salutes fans

Kingston: A dazed and emotional Ireland captain Trent Johnston could hardly believe what he had witnessed after his team fought back for a thrilling tie with Zimbabwe in their World Cup debut on Thursday. 

Johnston said the entire day, with hundreds of Irish fans singing and cheering at Sabina Park, had been hard to take in. 

The first hour was surreal just being at the World Cup, seeing the cameras and the fans going crazy it was just an unbelievable experience and it is just going to get better, the Australia-born Johnston said at a news conference. 

Weve come here to promote cricket in Ireland and we have shown there is good cricket in Ireland and given people an entertaining game to watch, he added. 

Johnston was full of praise for his side, singling out the approach of the medium pacer Kevin Brien and off-spinner Andrew White in the dramatic final two overs. 

They are two gutsy cricketers, he said, There was no shake of the head when I threw them the ball and that is what this team is all about and why we can hang tough like that. (Reuters)

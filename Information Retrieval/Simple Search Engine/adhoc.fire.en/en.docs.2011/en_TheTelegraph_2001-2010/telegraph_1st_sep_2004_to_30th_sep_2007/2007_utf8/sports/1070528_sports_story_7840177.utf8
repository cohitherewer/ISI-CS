The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Opinion divided over recall

 Roy Collins

In what some may view as a triumph for spin and hype, rather than any pressing need of the England football team, David Beckham completed his prodigal return when named in manager Steve McClarens squad for Fridays friendly against Brazil at Wembley and the Euro 2008 qualifier in Estonia on June 6. 

However he tries to dress up what became footballs worst-kept secret, McClaren knows he cannot claim that Beckham, having played only 11 times for Real Madrid this season, is a new, improved player from the one he dropped after the World Cup and he did not even try to do so, pointing only to his passion for playing for England. 

Typically, for a man closer to showbiz than football, Beckhams recall does not represent a rebirth of his international career, merely a Kylie-style brief farewell tour, playing gigs only at Wembley and the A Le Coq stadium in Tallinn before he disappears into the Hollywood hills. 

McClaren, who faces the sack if England fail to beat Estonia, denied that bringing back Beckham was a Corporal Jones reaction, saying: It is certainly not a panic move. After the Spain game in February, we reassessed things and looked at changing things round and David came into the reckoning. 

I met him 10 days ago and we had a chat about the possibility of him coming back and he is still passionate about playing for his country. Thats what he brings to England. 

If McClaren wanted Beckham to play in the final European qualifying games next season, the former England captain may then be presented with a curious conflict of interest as his new club, Los Angeles Galaxy, have fixtures which clash with four of Englands qualifying games. 

While some will back Beckhams recall, the question must be asked whether it is not disruptive to bring him back just for Estonia and Brazil. Who knows? says McClaren. We are planning long term but are concentrating on the next 10 days and the game in Estonia. I believe David Beckham can help us win that, which is all that matters. 

Is Beckham being brought back to save McClarens skin? No, I have brought him back to help us win a game. Opinion on these things will always be divided, some people will say its a great decision, some people will say it is a stupid one. But with England, any decision is always tough. 

The former captain desperately wants to win 100 caps but despite his recall, it seems he will only make it to 96 before taking Brand Beckham off to America.

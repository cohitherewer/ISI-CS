 Pak honour for Woolmer

Islamabad: Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf sent his condolences to Bob Woolmers wife Gill on Thursday, saying he and the country were immensely saddened and shocked by his death. Musharraf said the former Pakistan coach would be given the Sitara-i-Imtiaz civil award in recognition of his contribution to sports. 

According to a copy of Muharrafs letter to Gill released by his office, he did not refer to the investigation. 

I had the pleasure of knowing Bob personally, we found him to be a thorough professional and above all an excellent human being, the Pakistan President said. With him at the helm of coaching affairs, Pakistan enjoyed success with unprecedented consistency and the players gelled into a winning unit. 

Pakistan cricket shall forever be indebted to his services and this nation will always remember him for the joys he brought into the lives of millions of Pakistanis, he said. We shall greatly miss him. (REUTERS)

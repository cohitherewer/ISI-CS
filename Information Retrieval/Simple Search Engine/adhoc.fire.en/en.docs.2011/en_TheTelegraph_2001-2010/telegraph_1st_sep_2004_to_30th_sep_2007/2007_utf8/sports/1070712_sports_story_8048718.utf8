 Useful outing for Vaughan

ANDREW COLLOMOSSE in OLD TRAFFORD

 Michael Vaughan 

Michael Vaughans half-century here will not go down as one of the more fluent knocks in Roses combat. Nor, for that matter, will it be remembered as one of England captains better offerings on a ground where he has scored two of his 16 Test centuries and averages over 50 in 11 innings for his country. 

But if time in the middle was the primary requirement ahead of next weeks first Test against India, this low-key work-out served its purpose. Vaughan, who has not played since the final Test against the West Indies ended on June 19, batted for 248 minutes for his 74 from 210 balls. 

Some of his eight fours were sumptuously struck and he reached his 50 from 155 deliveries with a classic drive through mid-on off Gary Keedy. 

But there were blemishes, too. On 20, he survived a difficult chance to James Anderson at backward point and would have been run-out 15 runs later if Steven Croft had scored a direct hit from point. 

There was another escape on 61 when Dominic Cork could not cling on to a difficult diving chance at slip and he eventually departed to a misjudgement, shouldering arms to an arm ball from Sanath Jayasuriya that hit middle stump. 

It wasnt the prettiest innings but I was happy to do a job for the team, said Vaughan, who confirmed that he would play for Yorkshire against Warwickshire in the Championship game which starts at Edgbaston on Friday. You have to adjust to the conditions and I had to work hard for my runs. But mentally I feel very good. 

Yet only the positive approach promised by captains Mark Chilton and Darren Gough allowed Vaughan to open the Yorkshire innings 10 minutes after the scheduled start following the loss of two days to the weather. 

Umpires Neil Mallender and Trevor Jesty expressed serious doubts about the bowlers run-ups but the captains were prepared to give it a go and Yorkshire were offered first use of a slow pitch with some unpredictable bounce.

London: Justine Henin took advantage of an injured Serena Williams at Wimbledon on Wednesday, advancing to the semis with a 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 win over the two-time champion. 

Although Serena managed to win the middle set, Henins variety of shots kept the American moving. On Monday, Serena had collapsed on the court with a strained left calf during her fourth-round win. She played against Henin with her leg taped. She also had her left wrist and thumb taped. 

The top-ranked Henin first served for the match at 5-1 in the third set, but several unforced errors and a rejuvenated Serena briefly extended the match. Henin will face No. 18 Marion Bartoli. The 22-year-old Bartoli beat No. 31 Michaella Krajicek younger sister of 1996 Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek 3-6, 6-3, 6-2. 

Venus advanced to the quarter finals, dominating 2004 champion Maria Sharapova and winning 6-1, 6-3 in a two-day match that included a nearly two-hour rain delay. 

Despite wasting seven break-points in the third game of the second set, Venus broke in the seventh and ninth games to advance. 

Venus had 19 break-points and converted four. Sharapova didnt get a single break-point, and only pushed Venus to deuce once on the Americans serve. 

I dont know if it was the wind or a slow start. She got off to a fast start, Sharapova said. I just didnt feel really comfortable in the first set. 

Rafael Nadal advanced to the mens fourth round, falling to his knees in relief after finally beating Robin Soderling 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (7), 4-6, 7-5 in a rain-interrupted match that finished four days after they first stepped on court. The toughest match maybe of my career, Nadal said. Because the stops always were tougher for me than for him because I was winning. 

Nadal accused his opponent of unsportsmanlike behaviour. I fell close to the net, and he never even went to the net to say sorry or help or something. He is not the best guy in the locker room. 

Nadal, a three-time French Open champion, will next play No. 14 Mikhail Youzhny. 

No. 4 Novak Djokovic also reached the fourth round in a match that took three days, and No. 3 Andy Roddick advanced to the quarters in an encounter that took two days. 

Djokovic beat Nicolas Kiefer 7-6 (7-4), 6-7 (6-8), 6-2, 7-6 (7-5), and will play 2002 champion Lleyton Hewitt in the fourth round. Roddick defeated Paul-Henri Mathieu 6-2, 7-5, 7-6 (8-6). 

Roddick will face No. 12 Richard Gasquet, who defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-4, 6-3, 6-4. Brazils Marcelo Melo and Andre Sa entered the Wimbledon record books when they won the longest final set in championship history. The Brazilian pair upset sixth seeds Paul Hanley and Kevin Ullyett 5-7, 7-6, 4-6, 7-6, 28-26 in a rain-interrupted encounter that spanned four days. 

Although an opening doubles set in the 1968 championships

 took 62 games to complete, the 54 played on Court 16 is the most for a deciding

 set.

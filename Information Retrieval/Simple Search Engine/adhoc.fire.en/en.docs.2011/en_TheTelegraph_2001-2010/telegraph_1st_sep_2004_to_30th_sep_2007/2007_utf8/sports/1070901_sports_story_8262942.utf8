 Dravid: Well bounce back

 - Well be really ruthless in last three games: Collingwood 

 Manchester: Rahul Dravid slammed his sides fielding for Thursdays three-wicket loss, but was confident that they would bounce back from the tough situation. 

Its tough, but I think when we reach Headingley well be pretty keen, Dravid said after the day-nighter which slipped from Indias grasp thanks to an unbeaten 99-run eighth-wicket partnership between Ravi Bopara and Stuart Broad. 

We had seven guys inside the ring to stop the single and still the opposition managed to get singles. It is tough, rued Dravid. 

Asked whether he thought England were dead and buried at 114 for seven, he said: They do bat low down the order. I think Broad coming at No. 9 is a huge thing for them. They (Bopara and Broad) played sensibly, they are not lower order sloggers. 

The other big advantage they had was that the run-rate was low. The run rate they needed was still only 3.5, so we had to take wickets. 

When Bopara and Broad came together, even if they were chasing four-and-a-half an over, our aim was to drag the run rate up to five. We tried everything we could, but did not get that one chance to get the wicket. 

It was very disappointing but you have to give credit to the two boys, they played beautifully, he said. 

Dravid also said the batsmen could have done better. I think we were 25-30 runs light to start off with as 240, I thought, was a good score on that wicket. 

Dravid also played down his conversation with umpire Ian Gould as tempers frayed in the final overs. 

It was nothing serious. There is communication between the umpires and the captain all the time, there was nothing more to it than that, he added. 

Paul Collingwood sounded a warning to the beleaguered Indians, saying his team would be more ruthless in the remaining three ODIs. Three-one up is a nice position to be in. But, as a team, we are going to start afresh in the last three games, said Collingwood. 

We had a hiccup today but did well to come out of it. We are going to be really ruthless in the remaining games and hopefully play our best cricket from now on, he said. 

The England captain also felt that winning from a hopeless situation helped in the learning process of his young side. You learn a lot from these experiences, he said. 

 I think you have to go through these situations sometimes to see the characters of people. Today weve seen two characters (Bopara and Broad) doing exceptionally well. And they finished not out as well. India were coming hard at us, as they have done all summer. You learn a lot from these experiences.

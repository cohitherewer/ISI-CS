The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dempo well served 

by sons of the soil

Seven years ago in 2000, the management of the Dempo Sports Club had decided to disband the team after it got relegated from the top tier of the National Football League. Almost everyone in the company supported the move as they saw no point in continuing with the team. 

Coach Armando Colaco was a lonely man then. He was confident of making a comeback but no one was ready to believe him. Thankfully, he was able to convince the management and what happened in the next seven years is history. Dempo went on to win every top tournament in the country including the Federation Cup and National Football League. 

It didnt really surprise anyone when Dempo won the NFL for the second time this season. Like all big teams, Dempo have developed a habit of making a comeback. They were badly placed after losing to Mohammedan Sporting and JCT, but the stunning 5-3 win over East Bengal in the crucial tie changed the scenario. 

Credit should mainly go to coach for turning Dempo into a winning combination. He picked up two good foreigners in Beto and Ranty Martins, but didnt stop there. He blended them well with the Indians, whom he chose most diligently over the years. Also, Colacos role cannot be denied in making Samir Naik, Clifford Miranda, Climax Lawrence or Anthony Pereira the stars of today. 

That the local Indian players had a major contribution behind Dempos triumph is the biggest cause of joy for Indian football fans. At last, there is a team, which banked on sons of the soil and didnt regret it in the end.

 Shoaib says hes in peak form

Karachi: Pakistans injury-prone speedster Shoaib Akhtar has set his sights on lasting out the forthcoming Test series against South Africa, India and Australia. 

Shoaib left with the Pakistan squad on Wednesday for Glasgow where they play two one-day games against Scotland and India next week. 

He was selected having played just one Test and four ODIs since February last year after an array of knee, hamstring and groin problems. 

He also tested positive in an out-of-competition dope test carried out by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) in 2006 before being cleared on appeal. It is never easy coming back from a prolonged lay-off due to fitness issues, Shoaib said before the teams departure. 

But I am feeling the best I have in my entire career. I see this as a new start for me and a chance to end my career in a creditable manner, he said.

 Bari in line for top PCB post 

Karachi: Chief selector and former Test captain Wasim Bari is likely to be appointed as the chief executive officer of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). 

Bari has been interviewed by the board and its consultants and he himself is keen for the job, sources said. 

Bari has been chief selector since 1998 except for a one-year period after the 2003 World Cup when he was replaced by Aamir Sohail. 

The former wicketkeeper, who played 81 Tests and 51 one-day Internationals, is among those Pakistani players who have a sound educational background. He is also serving as a director in the national airlines. 

Bari is due to retire from service in the airlines in September this year and the CEO post would be ideal for him given his cricketing and administrative background, sources added. (PTI)

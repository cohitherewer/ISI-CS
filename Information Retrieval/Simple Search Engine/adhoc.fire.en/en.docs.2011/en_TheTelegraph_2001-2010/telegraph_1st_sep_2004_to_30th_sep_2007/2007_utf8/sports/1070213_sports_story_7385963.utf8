 Sehwag should open

 - Ex-India players welcome Delhi batsmans inclusion in World Cup squad 

 Kiran More 

Former cricketers welcomed the bold move to include an out-of-form Virender Sehwag in Indias World Cup squad, saying the swashbukling batsman had match-winning abilities and could not be ignored for such a big event. Most of them felt that Sehwag would be more effective as an opener as he could capitalise on the field restrictions and change the complexion of the game in the first 15 overs. 

Following are excerpts from what they had : 

ABBAS ALI BAIG: Selectors were justified in picking Sehwag. There is no doubt that he is a match winner. He can be really destructive if he gets going. His off-spin will also come handy, particularly on the slow tracks in the West Indies. Maybe Powar is a little unfortunate to miss out on a berth. I would have taken him in the light of the slow tracks in the West Indies. 

CHANDU BORDE: Selection went on expected lines: it is not a surprise selection. But those who are injured, their fitness should be gauged. If the injury happens to be serious then it will be a problem for the team. Sehwag should open the innings and not bat in the middle-order. He loves the ball coming onto him because he hits through the line. Pathans inclusion was also justified because he like Agarkar could contribute in some way or other and allrounders were always useful in shorter version of the game. 

CHETAN CHAUHAN: Sehwag should open, that is where he has scored all his runs. He has the natural instincts of an opener. He is a player who can change the complexion of the game. If he stays at the crease for 15 overs, the whole scenario changes. All fast bowlers fear him and teams make special plans to get him out. 

SYED KIRMANI: The team had a fine blend of youth and experience. It is a fine blend of youth and experience, they have to perform to their ability and show consistency. Of course luck has a part to play, but they have to show total sincerity and honesty for positive results. 

ERAPALLI PRASANNA: I would have preferred Powar in view of the fact that Harbhajan has not shown his brilliance of late and the (spin) bowling will totally depend on Anil Kumble, which is a dicey composition. 

K. SRIKKANTH: I would have preferred to have Kaif in the squad. The team is okay as most of the players select themselves. But I think Kaif is unlucky not to make the cut. 

SRINIVAS VENKATRAGHAVAN: Going by the West Indies and Sri Lanka series, selectors have done their best because I dont think they have anything else to go by. However, not giving chance to VVS Laxman, Mohammed Kaif and Murali Kartik is a point to ponder. Kartik especially could have given variation to the attack and he is also an aggressive batsman 

AJIT WADEKAR: The squad is a balanced one. Selectors did not have many options because of the lack of form and not so great performances from other players. To include Sehwag in the side is a bold decision. But he should be used as an opener with Sourav (Ganguly) because he has made a lot of runs in that position. He is an attacking player. I dont think he will be successful in the middle-order because he not like Sachin (Tendulkar) who can adjust to any position. His off-spin would be handy given the conditions there. 

Selection could have been better had they picked Powar rather than second wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik because as the tournament would progress the wickets would get slower and slower. Spinners would play an important role at that stage. Besides Dhoni we have Dravid and Uthappa who can keep wickets.

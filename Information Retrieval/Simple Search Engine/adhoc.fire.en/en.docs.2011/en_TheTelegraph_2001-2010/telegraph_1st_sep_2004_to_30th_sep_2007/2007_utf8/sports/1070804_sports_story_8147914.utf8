 Ferrari hit back 

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES

Ferrari have accused Formula One rivals McLaren of making serious and false accusations over their winning car at this seasons Australian Grand Prix. In an open letter to the FIA, McLaren team principal Ron Dennis claimed Kimi Raikkonens win in the season-opening race was illegal, having been informed of a flexi floor device on the car by Nigel Stepney. 

Stepney was sacked by Ferrari and is one of the men at the heart of the spy saga that has dominated F1 in recent weeks. 

Earlier this week, Ferrari won the right to have an appeal heard by the World Motor Sport Council after McLaren escaped a points penalty despite having been found in possession of technical information detailing the workings of the Italian teams car. 

Dennis then made his claims about Ferrari and their victory in Melbourne. He wrote: Were it not for Mr Stepney drawing this illegal device to the attention of McLaren, and McLaren drawing it to the attention of the FIA, there is every reason to suppose that Ferrari would have continued to race with an illegal car. 

However, a statement issued by Ferrari read: Ferrari wishes to state very strongly that its (McLarens) letter contains accusations that are both serious and false. 

Contrary to the statement put forward by Vodafone McLaren Mercedes, Ferrari never illegally gained any advantage.

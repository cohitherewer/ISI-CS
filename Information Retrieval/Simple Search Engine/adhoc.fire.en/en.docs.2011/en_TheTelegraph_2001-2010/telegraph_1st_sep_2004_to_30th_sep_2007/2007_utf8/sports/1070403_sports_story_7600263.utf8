The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Hosts set to bow out

There was further grim news Sunday for a tournament that seems to be stuck in crisis mode. Since Bob Woolmers death visited a real-life tragedy on this World Cup the setbacks have kept coming, from the non-delivery of decent practice facilities to the tiny crowds. Now it looks as if the hosts will be walking out on their own party. 

The 113-run defeat against Sri Lanka does not technically end the West Indies interest in the tournament but it does leave them dangling off the edge of a precipice. 

They have to win their last three games, against South Africa, Bangladesh and England, to have a chance of going through to the semi-finals. Even then they will be relying on other results falling the right way. 

A respectable showing from the home side is always a prerequisite for any successful sporting showpiece and how much more so when high ticket prices have driven attendance figures to an embarrassing low. 

In such circumstances, it seems bizarre that the fixture list has put the West Indies through the most demanding schedule of any team. 

While other contenders have spent the past week lazing around the pool, Brian Laras men have been out on the field for four days out of the last six. 

Not only is this tiring and rather unjust, it is also asking for trouble: by cramming in so many West Indies matches, the organisers have done their best to eliminate the home side at the earliest chance. 

The West Indies may have had a busy time, but they will need a lot of excuses to explain a performance as insipid as this. 

They gave comfortably the shoddiest fielding display by any team in this World Cup. There were at least a dozen mistakes, several committed by the creaking figure of Lara. 

The match featured the Super Eights two oldest players in Lara and Sanath Jayasuriya. Their fortunes could hardly have been more different: Lara followed up his clumsy fielding by scoring just two runs, while Jayasuriya led the Sri Lankan assault with an 86-ball century. In a match that saw him equal Sachin Tendulkars record of 384 one-day Internationals, he smashed four sixes. 

Jayasuriyas blitzkrieg was neatly complemented by the elegant dabs and deflections of Sri Lankas captain, Mahela Jayawardene, who played the holding role in a stand of 183 from just 30 overs. 

When he was yorked for 82, Jayawardene smiled he knew his team were on their way to an intimidating total. 

The star of the Sri Lanka effort in the field was wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara who accounted for two stumpings, including Lara. 

That was the point of no return for the West Indies, to the dismay of a near-capacity crowd. Lara wants to stay on as a Test player, but he has become a divisive figure. 

This team has been reshuffled in their last two games, apparently on his orders. After pacer Jerome Taylor was bafflingly dropped against New Zealand, the whole batting order was turned on its head Sunday. 

Such instability cannot be good for a team.

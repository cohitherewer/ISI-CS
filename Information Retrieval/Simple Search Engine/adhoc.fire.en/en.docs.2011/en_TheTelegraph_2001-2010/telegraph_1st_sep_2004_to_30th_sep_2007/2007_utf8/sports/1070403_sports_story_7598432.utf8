 Morgan makes history

Rancho Mirage (California): Morgan Pressel became the youngest major champion in US LPGA Tour history when the 18-year-old closed with a three-under 69 at the Kraft Nabisco Championship as everyone around her self-destructed on Sunday. 

Pettersen, a fiery 25-year-old from Norway, had a four-shot lead with four holes to play when she started hitting tee shots into the ankle-deep rough and missing putts on the crusty greens. 

Id said that a little help never hurts, Pressel said. That rang true today.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I dont 

 think Bobs role as Pak coach ran the way he would 

 have liked

 - Daryll Cullinan on South African cricket and Woolmer 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE

 Daryll Cullinan 

 Dhaka: Nowadays, they dont 

 produce many batsmen like Daryll Cullinan (4,554 runs in 

 Tests and 3,860 in ODIs) and cricket, really, is poorer 

 for that. The South African stalwart, who is in Bangladesh 

 for TV duty, spoke to The Telegraph during the day 

 off on Friday. His last appearance for the Proteas was in 

 2001.

 The following are excerpts

 On captain Graeme Smith and coach 

 Mickey Arthur getting two-year extensions

 Its a good move... Mickey, 

 in particular, has strong views about taking South African 

 cricket forward and it wouldnt have been proper to 

 make a change at this point in time... Graeme, I believe, 

 has done a lot too... More important, he has the respect 

 and support of the dressing room... He has grown in the 

 job and is certainly a far better captain today than when 

 he got appointed four years ago... His style of play can 

 attract criticism, but Graeme likes to lead from the front.

 On South Africa always faltering 

 on the biggest stage, the World Cup

 (Laughs) Its an issue 

 and needs to be addressed... Weve got to be smarter 

 and there has to be more out of the box thinking... Basically, 

 its a World Cup-specific problem.

 On what went wrong in the last 

 World Cup

 We struggled with a pretty one-dimensional 

 attack... Then, on the big day (semi-final versus Australia), 

 our strategy was wrong... Instead of going for the jugular, 

 we should have played normal cricket. Weve got to 

 be flexible in our thinking and flexible with strategy... 

 Losing to Bangladesh in the Super 8 didnt do us any 

 good. (After a pause) I, at least, kept waiting for 

 Australia to have a bad day. They didnt have one! 

 They just kept improving and, in the final, raised their 

 game to a fantastic level.

 On whether the Australians 

 play that much harder against South Africa

 They do see us as strong competitors...

 On whether the South African 

 team which played the 1999 World Cup remains the best ever 

 fielded in ODIs

 I suppose so... Thats what 

 players who played then and now, for example Shaun (Pollock) 

 and (Jacques) Kallis, feel... I was privileged to have been 

 part of that team... In fact, for three-four years then, 

 our one-day cricket was outstanding.

 On his thoughts before the 

 last World Cup got underway

 Because of the conditions in the 

 West Indies, Id expected an India-Sri Lanka final. 

 Well, India didnt even get past the first stage...

 On the top lesson teams need 

 to learn from the World Cup

 That one-day cricket is now a 

 power game... You need big hitters... Also, that there has 

 to be more athleticism in the field... The pace is getting 

 quicker and the better teams are going to adjust and adapt. 

 Its a young mans game.

 On the way forward for South 

 Africa

 I understand there will now be 

 a specialist batting coach and the bowling coach (Vincent 

 Barnes) could be changed... Our players need to get tougher 

 in the mind... We also need to look at spin-options.

 On whether having a specific 

 number of non-Whites in the squad and in the XI is an impediment

 I dont think so... Blacks 

 are emerging as talented cricketers and, so, its not 

 hurting us... What we need to do is prepare better and become 

 stronger mentally... Some of our players struggle to find 

 their feet despite being around in international cricket 

 for a couple of years. Thats not acceptable... Players 

 need to settle down within ten matches. If they dont, 

 they ought not to be selected. The Australians never take 

 time to find their feet.

 On having worked under the 

 late Bob Woolmer

 It was a wonderful period... Bob 

 endeared himself to the players... I never saw him lose 

 his cool... Get angry... Bob was a gentleman... As a coach, 

 he was always looking to innovate and many of the things 

 he started are being followed worldwide.

 On his last interaction with 

 Woolmer

 During Pakistans tour of 

 South Africa earlier this year... I found he was under stress 

 and, obviously, was frustrated with the way some things 

 were going. I dont think his role as Pakistans 

 coach ran the way he would have liked... It wasnt 

 an easy job as he had to keep dealing with issues... I hope 

 the murder mystery gets solved... It must not remain a mystery.

 Finally, on the one Woolmer-related 

 memory which comes to mind instantly

 (Pauses) It was on my first 

 tour of Pakistan, in the mid-Nineties... We were discussing 

 cover drives in his hotel room... I think it was in Lahore... 

 Suddenly, Bob got up and said lets sort it out 

 right now... So, we went to the car park, if I recall 

 correctly, and he began explaining how to execute the perfect 

 cover drive! It was amazing... Bobs the one who taught 

 us to play both the conventional and the reverse sweep... 

 I played it only once, against (Muttiah Muralidharan) Murali, 

 and ended up with stitches on my upper lip... Im going 

 to die with this Woolmer-scar!

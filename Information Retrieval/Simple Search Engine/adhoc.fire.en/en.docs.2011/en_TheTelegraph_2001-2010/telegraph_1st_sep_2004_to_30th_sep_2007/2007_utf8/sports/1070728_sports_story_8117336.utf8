 Injured Bhutia out of last match

 - Indian captain scores brace in 3-2 win over Marinhense 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhaichung Bhutia 

New Delhi: There was a surprise in store for Bhaichung Bhutia when chief coach Bob Houghton called the Indian footballers for a team meeting on Friday morning. 

On Thursday night, Bhaichung scored yet another brace to steer the Indians to a 3-2 win over second division Portuguese side AC Marinhense. Sunil Chhetri scored the other goal. A visibly happy Houghton told the team that he was delighted with the skippers current form. 

The day we landed in Portugal , Bob (Houghton) told us not to read too much into the results of these matches He asked us to take this tour more for preparation than anything else, Bhaichung said. 

The ace striker he has scored four goals on the tour so far also revealed that he was surprised to see the coach so happy. Bob even told me not to think about retiring from international football. 

The Indian captain, however, will not get a chance to score another goal on the tour as he has been ruled out of the last match against GDR Monsanto at Torres Novas Stadium on Sunday. 

I suffered an injury on my left thigh in yesterdays match. This is nothing serious, but I have been advised rest for five days, Bhaichung maintained. 

On Friday, the Indian team went to visit the mythic Estadio da Luz, home of SL Benfica. They also took a tour of Lisbon. 

Bipasha Basu seems to be the most famous Indian here, said a footballer. She, along with Christiano Ronaldo, is on the covers of most of the magazines here. 

The Indian actor had an interaction with the Manchester United player in Lisbon recently. A British tabloid even ran a photograph of the footballer kissing Basu during a party, though the latter denied the lip-lock incident.

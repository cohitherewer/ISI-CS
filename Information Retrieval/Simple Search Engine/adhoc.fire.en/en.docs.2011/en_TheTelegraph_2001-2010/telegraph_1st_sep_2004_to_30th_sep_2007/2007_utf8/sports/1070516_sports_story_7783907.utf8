 Manjit, Habibur to miss Iraq tie

 Habibur 

New Delhi: Lowly India will be without two key players striker Manjit Singh and defender Habibur Rehman when they take on group leaders Iraq in an Olympic qualifier at Nehru Stadium, Chennai, on Wednesday. 

According to team sources, Manjit has high temperature. Stand-in national coach Colin Toal has decided to try out the Joaquim Abraanches-Tarif Ahmed combination in the forwardline. 

Habibur was set to start in defence, but has been ruled out after injuring himself during practice on Tuesday. While Debabrata Roy will take his place, Toal is planning to have midfielder Praveen Rawat in the starting line-up. 

While Iraq are almost certain to make the next round, India have only three points, which they received after Fifa pulled up Thailand for fielding an ineligible player against India. 

In the first leg tie in Jordan, Iraq defeated India 3-0.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Hopefully, Lara-selectors rift wont harm morale

Fast Track

Courtney Walsh

Things seem to be getting worse for the West Indies as the tournament progresses, and much as it pains me to say so, Lara and his boys have to do something very special if they are to live up to the expectations and force their way into the semi-finals.

Simply put, we need to win all our games from here, which is not a good thing for a team that is already under so much pressure. 

I believe Brian Lara is not happy with the team he has been given and has said as much. Well, all I can say is that the captain of a cricket team has more of a role in team selection than captains in other team sports. 

And if Lara says he was not present at the meeting to select the World Cup squad, I would call it unfortunate and very much hope that the rift between captain and selectors does not further damage the teams morale. 

Yet another problem has been the scheduling, with the much-talked about four-games-in-eight-days routine that the West Indies have had to endure. 

While scheduling glitches are bound to crop up in a tournament of this length, would it have been too difficult to space out the initial Super Eight matches and reduce the current nine-day break that the team has been given to, say, five days? 

As things now stand, the West Indies have had not time to regroup between matches and with many of them having gone home during this long break, it may be too late now. 

To make matters slightly worse, theres another nine-day break coming up after their match against South Africa on Tuesday. 

A too-long break can be as damaging as a too-short one. I understand there has been some criticism of the decision to let the boys go home, though I havent seen any of the Jamaican fellows back in Jamaica, so I wonder where they are. 

Personally, had this happened during my playing days, I would have preferred to stay with the team, because that is one way to keep the momentum going, particularly after three successive defeats. 

At the start of this World Cup, I had predicted that we would make it at least to the semi-finals. With some regret, I now have to say that the probable last four are Australia, South Africa, Sri Lanka and New Zealand. We have to push very hard to get in there, and I am no longer sure of our ability to do so. 

Of the two most exciting games I have seen in this tournament, Sri Lanka were involved in both. The team is looking increasingly hard to beat, especially in a pressure situation. Though I would be wary of making yet another prediction, I believe Mahela Jayawardenes team has the wherewithal to challenge the best, a.k.a. Australia. 

As for South Africa and New Zealand, they play a brand of power cricket that is tough to compete against, based on superb athleticism, top-class fielding and power hitting. 

Their games, as well as Australias, are tailor made for modern one-day cricket and any team that wants to go past them will have to beat them at their own game.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Buzz over BCCI threat 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: In the wake of the World Cup final fiasco, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has threatened to move an unprecedented no-confidence motion against Malcolm Speeds administration at the International Cricket Councils chief executives meeting in June. 

While confirmation could not be got, it is possible that the BCCI could use this as a stick to embarrass the current dispensation. It may be recalled that Sharad Pawar and Englands David Morgan are locked in a battle to succeed Percy Sonn as president. 

According to a report in The Age, Melbourne, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah criticised the ICC for being more and more bureaucratic and costing its members money by unnecessarily employing so many people. Shah was speaking from Barbados after watching Chaminda Vaas and Dilhara Fernando bat out the final farcical overs in darkness. 

We are not that satisfied, Shah was quoted a saying in relation to the ICCs recent performance. It is becoming more and more bureaucratic. My board is of the belief that cricket is a simple, enjoyable game, but that is not how it appears at present. 

The ICC has so many staff members. It is unnecessarily employing so many people and that costs the other members. The ICC should move away from the bureaucracy and become more simplified. 

BCCI joint secretary M.P. Pandove, however, was in the dark about Shahs remarks. I have no idea. This hasnt been discussed within the BCCI. I dont know how it is possible, he told The Telegraph. 

On the no-confidence motion, Shah said: Why not? It is something we will discuss with our board. Some of it will depend on how other boards are feeling. 

Sri Lanka Cricket chief executive Duleep Mendis also expressed dissatisfaction over the final fiasco and said the no-confidence motion could be an option. 

That is something we will have to discuss and then perhaps take it up at the chief executives meeting, Mendis said from Colombo. 

What happened (in Bridgetown) was unsatisfactory and unfortunate. To have players out there in the dark cannot be good for the game, Mendis said. 

In the case of the World Cup, Speed has at various stages insisted that the poor crowds were not a concern because tickets were sold out, blamed the problems of the series on the local organising committee (which the ICC appointed) and defended the long, unpopular format on the basis that it kept attention on cricket for longer periods. 

He later revised his position on these points, including an admission that the World Cup would be shortened in future.

 PCB in doubt over Shoaib-Asif act

 - Theyre camouflaging something 

Karachi: Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asifs frequent visits to London have raised suspicion in Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) circles that the two pacers are trying to avoid dope tests on the pretext of fitness problems. 

What is happening is obvious. They go back to London on Sunday morning for another of their medical check-ups, a source in the PCB said. 

But they were in Lahore for two days and yet didnt bother to take the tests. What does it mean? 

Another official, speaking on conditions of anonymity, said the board had reasons to believe that both players had taken dope tests on their recent visit to London and the results had shown traces of nandrolone. 

Shoaib and Asif had tested positive for the substance last October after giving out-of-competition tests and were recalled from the Champions Trophy in India. 

After being banned, they were cleared under controversial circumstances by a committee of the board which heard their appeals in December. 

Why would they want to avoid giving the tests now? It is clear they are camouflaging something, the PCB official said. 

He said both bowlers knew that if nandrolone had not been cleared from their bodies, they could not risk going to the World Cup and testing positive again. 

Any player(s) testing positive in the World Cup, an ICC tournament, faces an automatic two-year ban. 

Sources said that Shoaib and Asif had been playing up their injuries but the real issue was the dope tests. 

The board does not think they have had the time to allow the banned substance to clear from their bodies be-fore the World Cup, a source said. 

Traces of the substance remain in an athletes body for five to six months. 

Another PCB official said both players would leave for London on Sunday and return on Wednesday and then report to the board on their availability for the dope tests and the World Cup. 

Director of cricket operations, Saleem Altaf, insisted it was mandatory for Shoaib and Asif to clear the tests and fitness trials next week. 

I dont know why they are delaying taking the tests in Pakistan, but if they dont take it, they dont go to the World Cup, he said. 

A source at the National Cricket Academy, where Asif stays, disclosed the seamer had cleaned out his room on Saturday before returning to his village near Sheikhupura.

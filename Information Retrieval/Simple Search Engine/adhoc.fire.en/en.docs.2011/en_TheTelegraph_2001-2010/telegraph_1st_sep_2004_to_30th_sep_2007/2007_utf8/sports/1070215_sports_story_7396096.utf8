Margao: Rahul Dravid will not forget this Valentines Day in a hurry. Besides pulling off a superb victory with a brilliant 66 on Wednesday, he also achieved a personal milestone by completing 10,000 ODI runs. The Team India captain, though, tried to downplay the feat. 

Ten thousand is just really a number, he said. Its nice to get there. I think one of the things that really gives me satisfaction in my one-day career is the fact that Ive batted at different positions from No.1 to 7. And Ive done pretty well in all those positions. Ive also kept wickets. Sure 10,000 is nice. If you play 300-odd games and youve been a successful player, I think youll end up with those sort of numbers. 

He also chose the occasion to be pragmatic was remind us of the hard work put in. One-day cricket was not my strength at the start. Ive had to adapt and improve At the end of the day, if such effort helps the team, it gives me immense satisfaction, he pointed out. 

For me the whole process has been one of self discovery. Its been a matter of delivering my best and maximising my potential. Its been an interesting journey and Ive also learnt lessons along the way, the team India captain explained. 

He was glad that his move to bat at No. 5 came off Wednesday. Im comfortable batting anywherebut yes, one of the things we did discuss was me to bat at No. 5 and control the innings... If we are under pressure to adapt and play according to the situation. So Im glad it came off today and I had the partnership with Dhoni which won us the game. 

Mahela Jayawardene, too, admitted that Dravids innings proved equally decisive. We had reduced India to 94 for four and had a good chance then to come back into the match. But Dravid and Dhoni batted well ... Dravids was a calming influence and his innings really made a difference. If we had taken a wicket at that time we would have had a good chance to win the game.

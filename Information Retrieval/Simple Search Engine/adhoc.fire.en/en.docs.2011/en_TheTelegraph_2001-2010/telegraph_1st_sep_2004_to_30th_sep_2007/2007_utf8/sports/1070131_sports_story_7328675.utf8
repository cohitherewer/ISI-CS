 Sourav proved us wrong, says Kapil

Jamshedpur: Fomer captain Kapil Dev termed Sourav Gangulys comeback as a positive development and said Sourav with his performance has proved people like us, as well as the selectors, wrong. 

Sourav has proved his mettle and cornered the critics with his showing. This indicates he still had cricket left in him, he said. 

Indias only World Cup winning captain Kapil Dev also felt that the Indian cricket team cannot be rated as a strong title contender in the forthcoming World Cup in the West Indies after the sides below-par showing in the past one year. 

Keeping in view the performance of the Indian team in the past one year, I do not think were a strong contender for the World Cup, he said. 

In fact, the Indian team performed much below its potential during the last 25-30 matches, said Kapil.

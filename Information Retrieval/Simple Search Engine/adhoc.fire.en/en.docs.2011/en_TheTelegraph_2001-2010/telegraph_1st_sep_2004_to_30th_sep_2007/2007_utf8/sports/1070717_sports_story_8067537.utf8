The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A twist in CAB elections

 - Error factor may come into play 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Till the other day, interest in

 the CAB annual general meeting (read: elections) centred around the High Court

 verdict on the Jagmohan Dalmiya case. The verdict is still awaited, but another

 development could help the former CAB presidents group gain some more

 time to formulate strategy in a bid to win the battle against Prasun Mukherjee. 

Following an error in the AGM notice, dated July 6, the CAB may be forced to postpone the meeting if anyone moves court. 

The notice, signed by joint secretaries Saradindu Pal and Amitava Banerjee, stated that the annual accounts of 2007-08 will be placed on July 28 (the scheduled day of the AGM). It should obviously have read 2006-07. 

A corrigendum was issued by the CAB eight days later. But that may not be enough to prevent someone from raising an objection as, according to the CAB rules, there has to be a clear 14 days between the issue of the notice and the AGM date. From the day the corrigendum was issued, 13 days remained for the AGM. 

Given the fact that people have been moving court frequently, its very much probable something similar will happen in this case as well. 

Pal refused to own up. Thats a printing mistake and has been corrected, Pal said. 

Another official rued the mistake and admitted that it had landed the CAB in a spot of bother. 

If someone moves court, the AGM may be delayed. An emergent working committee meeting has to be then called to announce a fresh date, he said. 

The CAB president, while acknowledging that the error could have a repercussion on the AGM date, added that it wouldnt be a problem. I had called a meeting to discuss the matter One has to be cautious. Some people always like to create trouble. But theres absolutely no problem, said Mukherjee. 

He denied it was a mistake on the CABs part. It was a typographical error. Its common sense that it should have been 2006-07 and not 2007-08. 

Meanwhile, Mukherjee filed his nomination for the presidents post on Monday. The city police commissioner filed his papers as a nominee of the Calcutta Police Club. 

Indranath Dey also filed papers for the post of vice-president.

 Reality check for England

Kingstown: Four wickets from Shaun Tait and a superb 72 from Adam Gilchrist helped Australia snap their losing run against England with an easy five-wicket win in their final World Cup warm-up on Friday. 

Their confidence will have been greatly boosted after they lost three times on the bounce to England in the recent home tri-series, including a 0-2 defeat in the finals. 

The world champions were struggling early on though, when England captain Michael Vaughan and Ian Bell shared a second-wicket stand of 116 before England collapsed from 122 for one to 197 all out after having elected to bat. 

Vaughan showed no signs of injury in his 62 from 73 . 

England face New Zealand in their group C opener on March 16 in St. Lucia and then play Canada and Kenya. 

Chasing 198, Australian openers Watson (55) and Gilchrist started impeccably with both managing some lusty blows off a totally ineffective England attack on a slow wicket. The middle-order fell cheaply but Australia, without Matthew Hayden and Andrew Symonds, won with 9.1 overs to spare. 

BRIEF SCORES 

England 197; 48.3 overs (M. Vaughan 62, I. Bell 56; S. Tait 4/33, B. Hogg 2/28, S. Clark 3/16). Australia 200/5; 40.5 overs (A. Gilchrist 72, S. Watson 55). Australia won by 5 wkts.

 Jail sentence for ex-SLC president

Colombo: Sri Lankas former cricket board chief Thilanga Sumathipala was sentenced to jail on Wednesday for passport forgery, but the judge released him on bail after an appeal to a higher court, an aide said. 

Sumathipala is accused of altering the passport of Dhammika Amarasinghe, a purported contract killer, to enable him to travel to England and take part in the 1999 World Cup. At the time, Sumathipala was president of Sri Lanka Cricket. 

Ray Ilangakoon said the judge ordered a two-year prison term for Sumathipala but immediately granted him bail on the request of Sumathipalas attorneys. 

Amarasinghe, who was accused of dozens of killings and the attempted assassination of a newspaper editor in 1998, was shot dead in January 2004 as he arrived at court to face murder charges. 

Sumathipala was elected president between 1999-2003. For a period in 2001, the sports minister sacked Sumathipala on corruption charges. (AP)

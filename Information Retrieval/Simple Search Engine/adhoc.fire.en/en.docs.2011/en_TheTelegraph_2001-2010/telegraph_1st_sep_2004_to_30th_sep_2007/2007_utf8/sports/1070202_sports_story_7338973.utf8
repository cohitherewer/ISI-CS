 Pressure is on Mumbai

A few hours before Bengal taking on Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy final at the Wankhede, I cant help but turn the clock back some 17 years ago. There are a lot of similarities between now and then. In the 1989-90 season, we were pitted against a big team. The likes of Kirti Azad, Raman Lamba, Maninder Singh and Manoj Prabhakar gave Delhi an air of invincibility.

On the other hand, we may not have had a big star in the side, but were a damn good mix of experience and youth and playing some real good cricket at that time. We were relaxed and didnt put any undue pressure on ourselves going into the final. I can still vividly recollect that we were able to put Delhi on the mat on the very first day. And once you bowled the favourites out for only 278, its imperative that you complete job.

We were all charged up, having drawn enough motivation from the fact that the achievement of a lifetime was beckoning us. All our efforts were driven towards translating it into reality. We never looked back from our marvellous show on Day I and emerged champions. 

Seventeen years from those days in March at the Eden, Bengal are once again in a position to repeat history. They have established themselves as a powerhouse in domestic cricket and will take the field at the Wankhede as last years finalists. 

They have clinched some tight games, come back from first-innings deficit and more importantly, risen to the occasion under pressure at home or away. Im really counting on Deep Dasgupta amp; Co. In the present scenario, the pressure is obviously on Mumbai. 

The final has also assumed significance since some of Indias all-time great stars will feature in it. While Mumbai boast of having Sachin, Agarkar and Zaheer, Souravs return will act as a huge inspiration for Bengal. 

Its refreshing to see so many international stars playing in a crucial domestic match. This is the feeding ground for young aspirants and brushing shoulders with big names such as Sachin and Sourav will do the upcoming generation a world of good. This is one learning process, which gives youngsters the most meaningful platform to gain experience while graduating into the big league. 

Coming back to the final, however, a few factors hold the key for Bengal: a) their first-day show, b) Souravs body language, c) the ability of the Ranadebs, Tewaris and Jhunjhunwalas to seize the opportunity and d) maintaining the intensity level throughout. 

The hopefuls will benefit from keeping in mind that this is their day. The Ranji Trophy final will be telecast live, watched by the powerful men of Indian cricket and stars such as Sachin and Sourav will be in the field. 

This is the occasion you must seize. Remember, the spotlight will be on you and a good show will automatically enhance your chances of making the coveted cut. 

Both captain Deep and coach Paras Mhambrey are having an excellent run. Taking the early initiative should be their top priority. There may be one or two sessions when Mumbai would enjoy advantage, but they must not lose focus and intensity. My best wishes are with them. 

And finally, I would like to draw attention to something related to the selection process. 

In recent times, the thrust is on grooming under-19 players and giving them chances to wear the senior jersey. But in my opinion, the Ranadebs and Tewaris have achieved success playing mainstream cricket and this is where our focus should be. 

Let the under-19 hopefuls play a few Ranji seasons and see if they can show the same promise. In this way, the future of Indian cricket will be more meaningful and hold us in good stead in challenging the best in the world.

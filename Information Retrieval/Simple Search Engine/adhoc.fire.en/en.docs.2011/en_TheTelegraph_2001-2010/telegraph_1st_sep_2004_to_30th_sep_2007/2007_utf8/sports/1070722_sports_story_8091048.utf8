The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Collingwood 

 isnt aspiring to be a Vaughan, says David Lloyd

 - FORMER ENGLAND COACH OPENS UP DURING A ONE-ON-ONE 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 

 London: 

 Left-handed David Lloyd, now 60, didnt get to 

 play many Tests but old-timers still recall the splendid 

 unbeaten 214 against India in the second Test (Edgbaston) 

 of the 1974 series. Also a former England coach, the genial 

 Lloyd spoke to The Telegraph on Friday evening.

 The following are excerpts

 On England having different 

 captains for Tests and ODIs

 Its not a problem as Michael 

 Vaughan and Paul Collingwood are really good pals and Collingwood 

 doesnt have big ambitions Isnt desperate for 

 the Test captaincy Collingwood isnt aspiring to be 

 a Vaughan. That, to me, is important. Collingwood wont 

 undermine Vaughan and, so, this system is working. Both 

 are positive about the whole thing, instead of probably 

 being wary and defensive.

 On Vaughan relinquishing the 

 one-day captaincy

 Right decision Because of a knee 

 problem, he shouldnt be playing the ODIs at all Hes 

 not mobile enough and you need the fittest on the park. 

 For any team to do well in limited overs cricket, it has 

 to have the ability to outfield the opposition. Englands 

 fielding is poor.

 On whether the system of two 

 captains could get confusing for the players

 Could, but it wont happen 

 if both have the same vision The team will get affected 

 if the one-day captain fancies the bigger job.

 On Kevin Pietersen having ruled 

 himself out as a possible one-day captain

 Well, Pietersen was a dangerous 

 option because the media wouldve pushed him towards 

 the bigger job. He sensed that and opted out, so to say. 

 Even if he wasnt ambitious, he wouldve 

 been pushed that way.

 On Vaughan as captain

 He has been our best, not merely 

 statistically He has a presence and is always five overs 

 ahead of the game Hes in front and not the one who 

 has the running to do His field placements are excellent 

 Indeed, Vaughans a natural leader. 

 On Englands poor record 

 in ODIs (ranked seventh)

 The problem is that we dont 

 play to a method Weve been struggling in the power 

 plays Basically, we arent adventurous enough The 

 one-day game began in England, but its somewhat of 

 a mystery why we keep struggling Our batsmen never seem 

 to get enough runs Recently, some statistics were worked 

 out, revealing that the opposition teams had been scoring 

 20 per cent more in the power plays. Thats a massive 

 difference. I dont think weve been picking the 

 right teams either.

 On England in Test cricket 

 (ranked second)

 I like our approach and Monty 

 Panesar has been sensational One piece was missing in the 

 jigsaw and Monty has completed it. Hes so reminiscent 

 of Bishan Bedi Has a beautiful bowling action, spins the 

 ball and stays unfazed if somebody gets after him Hes 

 an attacking spinner, unlike Ashley Giles who would do a 

 holding job Youve got to see his following, which 

 is massive because hes an honest chap. 

 On so many fast bowlers nursing 

 injuries despite the presence of a strong support staff

 (Grins) Theres a 

 theory that in order to stay fit, bowlers need to keep bowling 

 Matthew Hoggard went through a big number of matches without 

 an injury He started getting injured once he began having 

 breaks! There has to be a balance with rest Duncan Fletcher 

 liked to rest his bowlers, Peter Moores wants to play them 

 The change in regime has brought about a change in thinking. 

 Ryan Sidebottom is a case in point He has developed into 

 a good bowler by lots of bowling. Not by sitting on his 

 bum.

 On Fletcher, his full-time 

 successor in 1999

 He did an outstanding job and, 

 in hindsight, ought to have quit after the terrific Ashes 

 win in 2005 Hed looked tired then Also, everybody 

 had grown tired of that system A new coach brings freshness 

 In any case, coaches do have a shelf life

 On the shelf life of a coach

 Four years, I suppose From one 

 World Cup to the next Probably even six I did the job 

 for over three years 

 On Fletchers biggest 

 contribution

 Id done the groundwork, 

 but he succeeded in getting central contracts for the players 

 He got them on a full-time basis Fletchers USP was 

 his ability to quickly assess weaknesses in opposition players... 

 I havent seen anybody do better He could pick any 

 little weakness and, really, was like a dog with a bone 

 Wouldnt let it go

 On Moores, who has succeeded 

 Fletcher

 Hes taken over at a time 

 we can only go up in the ODIs He has come with a good CV 

 Hes young (44), hes bright The Sussex players, 

 for example, rate him very highly Mushtaq Ahmed, Murray 

 Goodwin

 On a coachs top job

 To create an environment for his 

 players to improve

 On Indias experiment 

 with a cricket manager

 Id favour the idea if the 

 manager got to play the role of a soccer manager In soccer, 

 hes the boss, with specialist coaches under him No 

 selectors Hes the man and hes accountable 

 I think that can happen in cricket as well The manager 

 doesnt need to go all over the country to spot talent, 

 rather hell have his men going around Call them talent-spotters 

 Sir Alex (Ferguson) doesnt travel the world, yet recruits 

 players from all over for Manchester United. Fact is hes 

 got scouts in Portugal or Argentina or wherever

 On his experience at selection 

 committee meetings

 After a few meetings I stopped 

 attending I didnt like the process and, so, asked 

 the selectors to simply give me the team.

 Finally, on Englands 

 poor record in the Ashes in recent years (2005 being an 

 exception)

 Thats because the Australians 

 have better players and a better system Their premier domestic 

 competition (Pura Cup, formerly the Sheffield Shield) is 

 solely designed to produce Test cricketers. Its not 

 about which state wins it.

 Injured Oram to miss match against Australia today

Grenada: New Zealand plan to put the Australian attack under the sort of pressure on Friday. They have faced only twice in the World Cup since losing 0-3 to the Black Caps in the Chappell-Hadlee series this year. 

Both teams have already qualified for the semi-finals but there will be no letup in the final Super Eight match at the Grenada National Stadium in the intense rivalry between two countries who compete fiercely at cricket, both rugby codes and netball. 

New Zealand thrust aside all inhibitions to record two of the three highest run chases ever in Februarys one-day series against a side whose attack has only faltered against South Africa and England at the World Cup. 

South Africa reached 160 without loss chasing 378 to win the final group A match and England were 164 for two in the Super Eight with Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen batting superbly. 

In both cases Ricky Pontings men fought their way out of potential trouble with the help of a brilliant run-out from the boundary by Shane Watson against South Africa and a soft dismissal by Bell in the England match. 

Its the same attack we played in New Zealand and we had success there, captain Stephen Fleming said. If we could create that sort of intensity with the bat and put them under pressure with their batting then were going to have a good game. Im not sure theyve been put under pressure over 100 overs. 

New Zealand will take the field without allrounder Jacob Oram, who has a bruised heel but is expected to be fit for next Tuesdays projected semi-final against Sri Lanka in Jamaica. Coach John Bracewell said James Franklin could be promoted from number nine to Orams spot at number six. 

Michael Mason, who injured his calf against Bangladesh, is set to return while New Zealand could further strengthen their pace bowling by selecting Mark Gillespie instead of off-spinner Jeetan Patel. Patel bowled beautifully in last Saturdays victory over South Africa but New Zealand will be taking into consideration the probability of a bouncy pitch in Jamaica for the semis.

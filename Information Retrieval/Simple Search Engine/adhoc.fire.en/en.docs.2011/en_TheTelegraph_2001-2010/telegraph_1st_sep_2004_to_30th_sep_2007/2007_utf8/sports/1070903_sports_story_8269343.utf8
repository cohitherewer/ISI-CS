 Mahesh, Nenad out

New York: Mahesh Bhupathi and Nenad Zimonjic crashed out of the US Open doubles draw, losing their second round match to Robert Kendrick and Sam Querrey. 

The sixth-seeded Indo-Serbian duo squandered a one-set advantage to go down 6-3, 3-6, 4-6 against the American pair. 

There was consolation for both Bhupathi and Sania Mirza, who exited from the singles draw earlier, as they reached the quarter finals of the mixed doubles competition. 

It was not easy going for the Indians though, as they fought hard to clinch the second round tie 7-6 (7-4), 3-6, 10-2 against Tatiana Golovin of France and Bob Bryan of America. 

In another mixed doubles match, Leander Paes, teaming up with Meghann Shaughnessy of the US, defeated fifth-seeded Martin Damm and Kveta Peschke of the Czech Republic 7-5, 6-3 to enter the last eight stage. (PTI)

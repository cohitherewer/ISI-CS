 Dravid: We failed at key moments

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Man of the Match Marlon Samuels in Chennai Saturday 

Chennai: Seven wickets for 36 runs was the point where India lost the match, conceded captain Rahul Dravid, following their three-wicket loss to the West Indies in the third Pepsi Cup one-dayer at MA Chidambaram Stadium here on Saturday. 

Thats not acceptable. We did not play well and failed in those key moments when we were looking at a 330-plus total. We missed one significant contribution, admitted Dravid post-match. 

Asked whether the team missed a regular bowler on the flat Chepauk strip, Dravid chose to disagree. Every time I face such questions. If we play an extra batsman you will ask whether we missed a bowler and something to that effect. We wanted to give Yuvraj a chance to see how was he shaping up, he explained. 

Dravid denied that the team missed Sourav Ganguly. Asked whether the decision to rest Sourav was wrong, Dravid said: No decision is a wrong decision. Its all taken by the thinktank, keeping in mind the balance of the team. We did not have a good game, lets accept it. Towards the end we rushed too much. 

Dravid showered praises on Ajit Agarkar and, of course, Robin Uthappa. Ajits spell was superb and Anil (Kumble) had a good comeback. 

On Uthappa, he said: Making a comeback needs a lot of courage, confidence and self-belief But he should have tried for a big one. No complaints, however. His was really a special innings. 

West Indies captain Brian Lara termed the win crucial ahead of the World Cup. We were looking at matchwinners ahead of the Cup. Marlon Samuels knock was of that kind. A tough performer with the bat, Samuels did well. Look at Australia, all the guys there are match winners. Thats what we should be aiming for. 

Lara agreed that India looked weaker sans Sourav, adding: But its part of their experimentation. They rested even their key bowlers today.

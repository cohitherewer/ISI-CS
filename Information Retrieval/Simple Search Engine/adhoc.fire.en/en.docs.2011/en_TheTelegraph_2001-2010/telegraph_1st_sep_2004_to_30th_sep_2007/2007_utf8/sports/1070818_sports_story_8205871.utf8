A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: There are indications that the state senior selection committee will have two new faces in the 2007-08 season. Former Bengal middle-order batsmen Raja Venkat and Joydeep Mukherjee are likely to replace Barun Burman and Kalyan Chowdhury. 

Arup Bhattacharya and Saradindu Mukherjee are likely to retain their posts. Burmans name has already been recommended by the CAB as one of BCCIs Match Referees.

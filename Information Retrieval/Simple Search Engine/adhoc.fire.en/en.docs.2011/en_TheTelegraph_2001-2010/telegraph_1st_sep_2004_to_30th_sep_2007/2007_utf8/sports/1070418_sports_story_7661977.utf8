Ahmedabad: Bengal suffered a three-wicket loss to Madhya Pradesh in their Group B league match of the Inter-State Twenty-20 Tournament at Motera Stadium on Tuesday. 

Elected to bat first, Bengal batsmen managed just 97 after having skittled out in 18.3 overs. Only skipper Manoj Tewari gave some resistance with a 36-ball 39. Former India captain Sourav Ganguly (10) who opened with Subhamoy Das was the other batsman to reach a double digit score. 

For Madhya Pradesh, TP Sudhindra, A Jadhav and S Abbas Ali took two wickets each. 

In reply, Madhya Pradesh settled the issue in 19.1 overs with three wickets intact. 

At Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, Karnataka recovered from their opening game reversal to record a four-wicket victory over Gujarat in their second group A league match. 

Chasing Gujarats 151 for nine, Karnataka were struggling at 38 for four at one stage but fought back to overhaul the challenging score with just three balls to spare. 

All eyes were on Rahul Dravid, playing his first-ever Twenty20 match, but he barely created an impression lasting just eight balls, scoring a solitary single.

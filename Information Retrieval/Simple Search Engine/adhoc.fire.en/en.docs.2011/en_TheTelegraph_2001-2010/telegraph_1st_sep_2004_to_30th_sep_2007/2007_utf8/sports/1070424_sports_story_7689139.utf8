 Younis Khan opts out of ODI series vs Sri Lanka

Karachi: Pakistan will be without senior batsman Younis Khan in their one-day International series against Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi next month, chairman of selectors Salahuddin Ahmed said on Monday. 

Ahmed said that Younis, currently in England to play for Yorkshire, had conveyed his unavailability for the three matches against Sri Lanka. 

We had told him that it wasnt necessary for him to attend the national camp in Lahore, and that he could join the team in Abu Dhabi since he is an automatic choice. But just now he told us that he wasnt available for the series, the Pakistan chief selector said. 

Ahmed did not elaborate why Younis pulled out of the series which would be Pakistans first after their dismal World Cup campaign. 

Younis refusal is on expected lines and in keeping with his earlier statement when he turned down the captaincy offer. 

The international calendar is very tiring and makes you stale. I dont have interest in playing one-day Internationals which are held round the year and want to concentrate on Test matches. I consider Tests the real cricket, Younis had said. 

A close friend and associate of Younis, however, did not rule out the possibility of the batsman not wanting to play so soon after the disastrous World Cup outing. 

Ahmed, meanwhile, said that leg-spinner Danish Kaneria has been ignored owing to technical reasons. 

For some technical reasons we have not considered Kaneria but he remains one of our frontline bowlers for future selections. 

The chief selector also said that some of the players among the probables list, pacer Shahid Nazir and young leg-spinner Mansoor Amjad, had asked to be exempted from the camp as they had already signed contracts with English county sides or league clubs. 

Mansoor, for example, has signed for Leicestershire. We cant stop players from earning their living. But we wont consider those who are only playing league cricket in England. The cases of the ones who have signed for counties would be taken into account, he said.

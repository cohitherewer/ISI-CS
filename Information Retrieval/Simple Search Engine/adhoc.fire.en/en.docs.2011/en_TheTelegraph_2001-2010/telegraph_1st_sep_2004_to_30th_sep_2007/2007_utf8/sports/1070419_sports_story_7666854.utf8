 Lanka brush aside Ireland in under a session

St Georges: Sri Lanka romped to an eight-wicket win in their final World Cup Super Eight match on Wednesday after dismissing Ireland for the lowest score of the tournament. 

Ireland made only 77 in 27.4 overs, one fewer than what Bermuda managed against the same opponents in the group stage. Sri Lanka then raced to 81 for two in 10 overs as the match got over well before the first session. 

Fervez Mahroof, who took three wickets in four balls in his opening over, finished with four for 25.Muttiah Muralidharan, who captured two wickets in his first four deliveries returned figures of four for 19. 

Mahroof started the rout for the 1996 champions who had qualified for the semis before Wednesdays game when he came on in the eighth over. After conceding two fours in his first two balls to opener Jeremy Bray, he switched to round the wicket and the left-hander was caught for 20 at short-cover by Russel Arnold. 

Andre Botha defended the next ball before edging a straight-forward catch to wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara. Eoin Morgan followed next ball to an acrobatic effort from Sangakkara, who changed direction to fling himself to his left and take the ball one-handed. 

Mahroof missed an opportunity to take a fourth wicket with the first ball of his fifth over when he dropped a caught-and-bowled chance off Niall Brien. In his next over, Mahroof had opener William Porterfield, who had scored 17 from 51 deliveries, lofting a simple catch to Sanath Jayasuriya at mid-on. 

Muralidharan, coming on in the 19th over, dismissed Brien caught-behind and then bowled Kenny Carroll, playing his first game of the tournament, for a second-ball duck. 

Mahroof ran out Ireland captain Trent Johnston (0) with a brilliant piece of fielding in the next over. Johnston moved out of his crease as he pushed the ball back to the bowler who threw down the stumps at the batsmans end with a one-handed pickup and throw. 

Kevin Brien fell to a second catch by Jayasuriya off the first ball of Muralidharans next over before Dave Langford-Smith brought up the 50 with a bold clump over mid-on for four. 

Langford-Smith was given a life in Muralidharans next over when Mahroof dropped a catch running in from square-leg. The batsmen crossed for one and Kyle McCallan was lbw next ball for a duck. 

A hooked six by Langford-Smith off Mahroof followed and Boyd Rankin drove Muralidharan for a four in a breezy last-wicket partnership before Chaminda Vaas returned to dismiss Langford-Smith lbw for 18 with a low full toss. 

Sri Lanka lost Upul Tharanga for a duck and Sangakkara caught for 10 but Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene was in no mood to delay the finish. He scored an unbeaten 39 from 27 balls with six fours and a six to seal victory after 10 overs and little more than three hours play.

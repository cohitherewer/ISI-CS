 Trescothick earns recall

 - ICC WORLD TWENTY20 

 Selectors overlook Vaughan, Strauss 

GILES MOLE

 Trescothick has to clear a fitness test 

Marcus Trescothick has been welcomed back into the England fold by being included in a 30-man squad alongside several surprise names for the ICC World Twenty20 tournament later this year. 

The 31-year-old Somerset left-hander was named in the squad for the event in South Africa in September, subject to him successfully proving that he has overcome the stress-related illness which forced him to fly home early from last two England tours. 

He is joined in the list by two players who are yet to feature at international level Essex batsman Mark Pettini and Sussex allrounder Luke Wright while there are shock recalls for Surrey leg spinner Chris Schofield and Sussex seamer James Kirtley. 

England must trim down this list to 15 by August 11, giving Trescothick time to consider his situation before committing himself to the two-week tournament. 

Marcus is a contracted player and was named in the England performance squad earlier this summer, said chairman of selectors David Graveney. 

Weve decided to name him in this provisional squad in order to give us more flexibility should it be decided that Marcus is ready to return to international cricket before the tournament takes place. 

Were pleased that Marcus has made a successful return to county cricket this summer and he remains a world-class opening batsman but we will not be placing undue pressure on him to make a return to international cricket without first carefully considering all the issues involved. 

Trescothicks return is bound to capture most of the attention, but the recalls of several other players also indicates the selectors decision to take note of the performances in the domestic Twenty20 Cup. 

Among the many players handed recalls is 34-year-old Leicestershire allrounder Jeremy Snape, whose last one-day International appearance for England was five years ago, while Warwickshire captain Darren Maddy has also been recalled seven years after his last one-day appearance. 

That pair have earned their call-ups for their consistent displays for Leicestershire, who have been the dominant force in Twenty20 cricket for the last few years until being knocked out at the group stage this summer. 

However, perhaps the biggest comeback is that of Schofield, who was one of the first beneficiaries of the central contract system in 2000 and played two Tests against Zimbabwe as a promising leg-spinner. 

His career failed to take off after that and after an acrimonious departure from Lancashire three years ago when he won a claim of unfair dismissal against them he faded into minor counties cricket until Surrey rescued him with a one-year deal last year. 

He has excelled at Twenty20 cricket this season and is the leading wicket-taker in the group stages, claiming 17 victims from his eight matches, in addition to being a useful batsman and fielder. 

Several players have missed out despite featuring in the recent one-day campaigns in Australia and during the World Cup in West Indies. 

The most high-profile casualties are former captain Michael Vaughan and Andrew Strauss, who both struggled to make an impact in the Caribbean, while Sajid Mahmood, James Dalrymple and Ed Joyce have also been overlooked. 

Weve chosen this squad specifically for the ICC World Twenty20 and included a number of players who have an excellent record in this form of the game at domestic level, said Graveney. 

ODI captain Paul Collingwood will lead the side in South Africa, although some of the senior members of the squad such as Andrew Flintoff, who hasnt played for England since April because of injury may drop out when the squad is trimmed. 

THE PROBABLES 

Paul Collingwood (captain), James Anderson, Ian Bell, Ravi Bopara, Tim Bresnan, Stuart Broad, Glen Chapple, Alastair Cook, Andrew Flintoff, James Kirtley, Jon Lewis, Mal Loye, Darren Maddy, Dimitri Mascarenhas, Paul Nixon, Monty Panesar, Mark Pettini, Kevin Pietersen, Liam Plunkett, Matthew Prior, Chris Schofield, Owais Shah, Ryan Sidebottom, Jeremy Snape, Vikram Solanki, Chris Tremlett, Marcus Trescothick, Jonathan Trott, Luke Wright, Michael Yardy.

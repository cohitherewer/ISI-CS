The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 BCCIs been doing this for 70 years

New Delhi: In an emotional outburst after being sacked as National Cricket Academy chairman, the iconic Kapil Dev on Tuesday said he would go on hunger strike if the BCCI continues to inflict injustice on the younger cricketers. 

Kapil, who has joined the ICL as executive board chairman, said he would do everything to prevent youngsters who have signed up with the rebel league from being penalised by the Board. 

If youngsters are ignored by the BCCI, I will go on hunger strike, the former India captain told a TV channel. 

Kapil said he was disappointed by the Boards ruthless approach. 

I felt a little disappointed They did not bother talking to me before making the announcement. Maybe they felt it was below their dignity. 

They have been doing this for the last 70 years and Im afraid they would continue like this, he said.

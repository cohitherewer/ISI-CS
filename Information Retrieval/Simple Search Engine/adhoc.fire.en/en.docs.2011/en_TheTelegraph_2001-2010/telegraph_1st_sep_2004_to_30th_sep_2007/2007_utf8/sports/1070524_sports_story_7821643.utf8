 United requested to reschedule tie

TELEGRAPH ONLINE AMP; AGENCIES

 Manchester United have been asked to reschedule their July 27 tour match against a Malaysian XI to avoid a clash with the Asian Cup. 

AFC chief Mohamed Bin Hammam met United chief executive David Gill and Premier League chairman David Richards on Wednesday in order to end the stand-off over the Premiership champions planned tour of the continent. 

The confederation wants United to rearrange their match in Kuala Lumpur, which is scheduled to take place two days before the final of the Asian Cup. I really appreciate the gesture that David Gill and Sir Dave Richards have displayed by coming here to AFC House to meet face to face to discuss this issue, Hammam said in a statement. 

We have presented our case to Manchester United and fully explained our position. We have not left any stone unturned to seek a solution amicably. and we very much hope that we can all seek a compromise to protect the interests of the AFC Asian Cup 2007 and the development of Asian football. 

We have made the request and we shall await the response. 

The Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) has signed a contract with the AFC agreeing not to promote any soccer event during the Asian Cup, which is co-hosted by Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. 

However, last week, the FAM said it would go ahead with the match because it was the wish of the countrys Prime Minister, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. 

The Malaysian government is using the match as part of the nations celebrations for the 50th year of independence from Britain. 

A Manchester United spokeswoman said, We have received the request regarding the date of the match and will be responding directly to the AFC.

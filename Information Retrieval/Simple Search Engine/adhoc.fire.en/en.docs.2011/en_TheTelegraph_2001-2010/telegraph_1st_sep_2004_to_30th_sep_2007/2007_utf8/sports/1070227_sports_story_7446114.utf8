 Chima factor not a worry for EB 

 - National League 

 Bhaichung set to miss todays derby 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Turn your clock nine years back, to the first leg of the National Football League (NFL) tie between Mohun Bagan and East Bengal on a sunny January afternoon at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

Chima Okerie a fading star but still one of the most dreaded strikers at that time scored, along with the promising Dipendu Biswas, helping the green-and-maroons clinch a crucial 2-1 victory over their arch-rivals and effectively kick-started Mohun Bagans journey to their first NFL title. 

We need to have self-belief Then everything will fall in place, the brawny Nigerian had told the then coach T.K. Chathunni. And how imposingly he kept his words, scoring a hattrick against Mahindra United in the final-round match, two months later, to set up Mohun Bagans tryst with destiny. 

Back to February 26, 2007 and give ear to what Chima now Mohun Bagan coach had to say on the eve of another NFL derby: East Bengal are hungry, so are we. Everything depends on how you believe in yourselves and how committed you are to the cause. 

Welcome to Chimas world of unmistakable self-belief, braggadocio and determination. His role must be different now but his weltanschauung or world-philosophy lives on. It is still a talking point at the Maidan as Mohun Bagan rev up for a new start under him. 

Here are further examples: Will Bhaichung Bhutia nursing a hamstring injury, play? There is hardly any chance, Chima answered. 

Is it a setback? Why? Bhaichung is a good player, but Im not going to cry, as my team is not dependent on any individual. I have other players to face the challenge, pat came the reply. 

Where will Jose Ramirez Barreto play? In the midfield. 

But isnt he insisting on playing upfront? I strongly believe midfield is his best position. We need creators like Barreto at the back and its the coachs duty to tell him where hes suited best. 

If Mohun Bagan look determined to set on a new journey, East Bengal remain unperturbed, paying little significance to the Chima factor. 

Chima has just started his coaching career and we wish him good luck. However, East Bengal will play against a team and not any individual. What we do know and believe is that we have the resources to win the tournament, technical manager Manoranjan Bhattacharya said on Monday. 

During his playing days, the great rivalry between Chima and Manoranjan was a riveting one. Will Tuesday be a repeat of the past? 

Both former players played it down. Its a different battle altogether, they insisted. 

If Bhaichungs absence hits Mohun Bagan ambitions to an extent (though Chima insisted that we dont have the luxury of playing a draw on Tuesday), East Bengal will equally be affected by the injuries of captain Alvito DCunha and Covan Lawrence, who have been ruled out of the tie. 

With changing of coaches being the flavour of Maidan nowadays, the pressure is surely on East Bengal coach Carlos Roberto Pereira. 

Though the Brazilian denied it, he was rudely reminded by the fans of back-to-back losses against Mohun Bagan in the CFL, Premier Division. 

Is revenge stirring inside his mind? Pereira laughed and politely said: Thats not my philosophy. You cant predict a result. 

Interestingly, Mohun Bagan havent beaten the red-and-golds in the National League since March 11, 2002.Welcome to the world of unpredictability the mother of derbies in Indian football lives in.

 Sania keen to make a point in city

Hyderabad: High on confidence after a healthy US hard court season, Sania Mirza says she is keen to prove herself in front of home fans in the upcoming Sunfeast Open. 

Sania said improved fitness was a key factor in her recent success and that she was eager to give her best at the $170,000 WTA Tour event in Calcutta without any fear of winning or losing. 

Right now I am focusing on my fitness and I will be happy if I continue the same level of fitness in the Sunfeast Open. Winning or losing doesnt matter, she said. 

Sania said her five wins against Top-20 players and getting the better of former world No.1 Martina Hingis were her best moments during her remarkable run in the US. 

One of the most satisfying things has been defeating Hingis. Winning against the Top-20 players has been a high point as well, Sania said on her return from the US. 

The 20-year-old had a stupendous two-month run, rising to 26th in world rankings as she reached the semi-finals in Cincinnati and made her maiden final of a $600,000 event in Stanford. 

It has been a fabulous hard court tour for me. I am happy with my progress. It feels great to be in the Top-30, the Hyderabadi said. 

Asked what was her next target, Sania said, I am taking it as it comes. (PTI)

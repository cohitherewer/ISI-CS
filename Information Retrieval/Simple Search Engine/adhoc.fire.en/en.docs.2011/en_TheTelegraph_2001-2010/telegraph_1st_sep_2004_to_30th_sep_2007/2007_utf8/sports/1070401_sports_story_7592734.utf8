 Pak Board suspends players contracts

Lahore: The PCB on Saturday suspended contracts of all the players, deciding to implement a performance-based arrangement instead. 

All players contracts stand suspended... The Board will introduce performance-based contracts very soon, PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf said at a press conference. 

Pakistan were eliminated from the first stage of the World Cup following their upset defeat at the hands of minnows Ireland. The murder of coach Bob Woolmer compounded problems. 

Ashraf said it was not the time to panic and overreact. 

The new coach, he said, would most likely be a Pakistani, triggering speculation that it could be former allrounder Mudassar Nazar. We have lost our coach. We have kept all our options open... Most likely it would be a Pakistani. 

Ashraf said a decision on naming the captain and vice-captain had been put off for about a month. I will think about it in a cool and considerate manner... Help from countrys cricketing minds will be taken before making an announcement in the next 30 days, he said. 

Ashraf, whose resignation after Pakistans World Cup debacle has been rejected by President Pervez Musharraf, said Pakistans next international assignment was the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa in September. 

There is ample time to put our house in order, he added. 

Its not the time to panic and overreact. I know people are angry and disgusted with the performance of the national team, but let me assure you that cricket is not going to die down in this country of 160 million, Ashraf added. 

The PCB has formed a three-member performance evaluation committee to look into the causes of the Caribbean disaster. 

The committee comprising former Test players Ijaz Ahmed, Salahuddin Ahmed and Salim Altaf will submit its report within the next 30 days, and it will be released publicly, he said. 

The PCB chief said measures would be taken to improve the situation and emphasised the importance of discipline in the team during overseas tours. 

In the new contracts, I will see to it discipline among team members at all levels is ensured. Managers can fine players for indiscipline as they will sign a code of conduct. Strict action will be taken for the violation of code of conduct. 

Players current form would be taken into account and fitness given utmost importance in future team selections. The time has ended in Pakistan cricket when a player will continue on past laurels, Ashraf said. 

The Pakistan team needs to be mentally tough, Ashraf said. We need to work on this as this is the most important area. 

Announcing a shake-up in the PCBs management, Ashraf said former Test player Zakir Khan has been appointed Director of Cricket Operations in place of Altaf, who has been promoted to Director of Special Projects. 

Altaf will also lead the technical committee for next years Champions Trophy and the 2011 World Cup. Former bureaucrat Shafqat Nagmi has been named PCBs Chief Operating Officer.

 Double for PSPB 

Ajmer: Petroleum Sports Promotion Board (PSPB) notched up contrasting wins to make it a double crown at the 68th National Table Tennis Championship here on Saturday. 

While the PSPB mens team thrashed Railways Sports Promotion Board (RSPB) 3-0, their women counterparts staged a remarkable comeback after being 0-2 down to emerge winners against the same opposition. 

Achanta Sharath Kamal, Soumyadeep Roy and Subhajit Saha scored impressive wins to make it a lopsided affair and claim their eighth successive mens team title. 

PSPB women were down 0-2 after K. Shamini and Mouma Das lost to Soumi Mondal and Anindita Chakraborty, respectively. However, Poulami Ghatak, Mouma and Shamini won the last three ties. (PTI)

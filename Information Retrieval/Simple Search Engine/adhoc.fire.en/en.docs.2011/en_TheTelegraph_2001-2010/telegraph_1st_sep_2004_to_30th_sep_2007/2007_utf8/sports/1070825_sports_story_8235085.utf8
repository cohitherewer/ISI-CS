 Shoaib cleared with a warning

Karachi: Shoaib Akhtar has been cleared of charges by the PCB after being penalised for leaving a training camp without the team managers permission. 

Akhtar was fined Rs 300,000 and docked 1.5 from the available 20 disciplinary points for leaving the camp and then not appearing for the boards hearing this month. 

However, manager Talat Ali said: It was a case of miscommunication which has been sorted out. I had a meeting with him and he said he had informed the captain (Shoaib Malik) before leaving the camp. That has been confirmed. 

Akhtar has been warned to be on his best behaviour for the next six weeks and would remain on a watch list, he said.

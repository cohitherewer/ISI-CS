 Atwal starts with a 72

Avondale: Arjun Atwal shot an even 72 in the first round of the Zurich Classic of New Orleans golf tournament on Thursday. 

Atwal, returning to PGA Tour after more than a month, had three birdies and bogeys after starting on the tenth. He ended the day with a bogey on the par-3 ninth, taking a penalty drop after landing in the water. He was tied 77th. 

Rookie Kyle Reifers shot a record eight-under 64 to take a two-shot lead and the course record. 

Atwal and Chris DiMarco jointly held the previous record a 65 set in 2005. 

Daniel Chopra had nine pars in a row on the back nine to card a two-under 870 to be at tied 32nd. The Swede of Indian origin had three birdies and one bogey on the front. 

Reifers, playing only his eighth event on the PGA Tour, was two clear of 1989 British Open champion Mark Calcavecchia who shot a 66. 

Tim Petrovic finished with a 67 for a four-way tie for third with Lucas Glover, Jason Schultz and Tom Johnson. Defending champion Chris Couch finished the day at par.

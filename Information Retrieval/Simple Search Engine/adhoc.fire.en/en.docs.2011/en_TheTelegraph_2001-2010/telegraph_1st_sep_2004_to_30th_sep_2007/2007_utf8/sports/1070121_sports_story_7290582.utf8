Calcutta: The record book will say that Mohun Bagan returned to winning ways beating Air India 2-1 in Barasat on Saturday following their back-to-back defeats to JCT and Mahindra United in the National Football League. The reality is that it could have been the same story of disappointment as well. 

For Mohun Bagan, Favio Cortez Vidal drew the first blood in the 55th minute and the lead was enhanced eight minutes later when another Brizilain Jose Ramirez Barreto capitalised on a defensive lapse. The Mumbai outfit managed to pull one back through Vinay Kuruvilla eight minutes from time. This was the three-time champions first win in four matches. 

However, more than the home teams credit, it was Air Indias costly blunders which tilted the match in Mohun bagans favour. Bot their goals were the results of Air Indias serious defensive lapses. The first 45 minutes of the match was wayward. But the second one provided some entertainment and excitement to the fans since three goals were scored at that time. 

In case of the first goal, Air India goalie Raju Ekka left the second post unguarded when Favio took the free-kick. 

Then in the 63rd minute, when Mehtab Hussain floated a cross, defender Vinay Kuruvilla haphazardly headed the ball away in Barretos feet nearby. Santosh Koli then remained stationed at his place, allowing the rival captain to get past him and score from the six-yard box. 

Trailing by two goals, Air India upped their tempo in the final 10 minutes, thanks to a couple of fresh pair of legs Suleh Musah and Samson Singh. In the 82nd minute, Samson crossed the ball from the right and Kuruvilla came up with a precise header to make the scoreline 2-1.

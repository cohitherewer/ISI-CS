 Toal to take charge in Houghtons absence 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Indian football teams British coach Bob Houghton would return home on January 25 for treatment of his injured hip and, in his absence, Colin Toal a permanent technical director of the team will take charge. 

All India Football Federation (AIFF) president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said Houghton would be away for six weeks for medical attention for a hip injury. Toal, thus, would be in the hot seat as India are preparing for pre-Olympic qualifiers against Myanmar and Iran. Shanto Mitra has been appointed manager of the team. 

Meanwhile, AIFF has roped in ONGC as sponsors for the Nehru Cup football meet, to be held in August. We are interacting with countries like Sudan, Vietnam, Iraq, Iran, Syria and Myanmar for participation in the tournament, Das Munshi told a press conference on Monday. 

Das Munshi said that India want to look for more international exposures so that the teams rankings get a boost. 

We have decided to have three national teams A, B and C ready so that we can respond to any international invitation on a regular basis, the AIFF president said. 

On improving the quality of Indian football, Das Munshi said a few initiatives had already been taken like talent hunt and setting up of selection committees for both junior and senior sides. 

Meanwhile, Fifa president Sepp Blatter will pay a three-day visit to India between end of March and early April for a first hand understanding of the football scenario in the country.

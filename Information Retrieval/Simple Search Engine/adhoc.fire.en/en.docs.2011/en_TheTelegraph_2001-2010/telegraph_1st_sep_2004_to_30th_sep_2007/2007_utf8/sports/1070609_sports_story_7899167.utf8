 Uefa awards tie to Sweden

Nyon: Uefa awarded Sweden a 3-0 victory over Denmark on Friday after last weeks European Championship qualifier was abandoned because a Danish fan attacked the referee. 

Denmark midfielder Christian Poulsen was also banned for three competitive internationals, after punching Sweden striker Markus Rosenberg in the stomach during the same match on Saturday. 

In addition, Uefas Control and Disciplinary Body fined the Danish Football Association 100,000 Swiss francs (US$81,000).

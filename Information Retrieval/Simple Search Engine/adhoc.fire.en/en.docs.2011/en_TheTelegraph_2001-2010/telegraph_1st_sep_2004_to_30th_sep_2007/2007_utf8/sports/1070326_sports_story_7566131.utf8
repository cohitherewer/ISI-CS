The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We lacked commitment, balance and josh: Kapil

 - Overconfidence led to our downfall against Bangladesh

Calcutta: After the nation-wide fury following Team Indias loss, its time for some confidence building measures to pacify the millions who are dejected at Team Indias miserable performance in the 2007 World Cup. 

And who better than Indias lone World Cup-winning captain, Kapil Dev, to apply the balm on the emotional fans in Calcutta. Justifiably and sensibly Kapil Dev Ramlal Nikhanj did it in a subtle way. 

At his first media interaction after Indias flop show, the former India captain was at his thoughtful and sensitive best here on Sunday morning. He was in the city thanks to SRMB Udyog Limited, who had roped in the iconic cricketer as their new brand ambassador. 

Kya apna haath kabhi kaatte ho kya apna ghar kabhi aap todte ho (Do we hurt ourselves?) he began. Everyone has the right to criticise but that does not mean that we should hurt them. 

We Indians are emotional. But we are also an intelligent race. Remember Sachin and Sourav had also made so many hundreds Dravid is called The Wall... 

Bachcha agar fail hota hai toh maa, baap kya usse ghar se nikal dete hain (Do we disown our kids if they fail in exams?) he asked. 

However, on the three reasons for Indias debacle, the former all-rounder became a bit critical. 

There cannot be three reasons, there would be even hundreds. What, however, I see is that we lacked commitment, josh (passion) and santulan (balance). And, against Bangladesh, we were over-confident which brought the downfall. 

Then who is to blame? Ourselves... 

Did they give you any assurance that they would bring the Cup home? We had big hopes... They gave their best Obviously they did not lose intentionally, Kapil said, pointing out: Do you think we did not make any mistake during 1983? Its just that those mistakes were overshadowed because of our triumph. 

The inevitable question followed. Is it retirement time for some senior players and should we bid goodbye to coach Greg Chappell? 

What is the use of my suggestion Who am I to decide on their life? Its their life If somebody wants to go, its his discretion. Otherwise selectors are there. I did not employ him (Chappell), its for the BCCI to decide. If somebody from outside helps us out then whats wrong in that If being a foreigner is the objection, then lets stop using foreign products. And stop speaking English as this is also not our language. 

He, however, did not rule out his becoming a coach, given an offer. Given a chance, Ill become the Prime Minister also, the 48-year-old quipped. 

About retaining Dravid as the captain, Kapil said: Why are we forgetting that this is the same Rahul Dravid who led India to victory while chasing 17 matches in a row, setting a new record. Why did not anybody question his captaincy then? 

Lets not make any decision hastily. This is not the right time to discuss all this as the World Cup is still going on. Let them come back We should think about it before the start of the next series. 

On Pakistan coach Bob Woolmers tragic death, the former captain said it was shocking and shameful. 

Cricket teaches us to win hearts on the field, not to murder, he signed off.

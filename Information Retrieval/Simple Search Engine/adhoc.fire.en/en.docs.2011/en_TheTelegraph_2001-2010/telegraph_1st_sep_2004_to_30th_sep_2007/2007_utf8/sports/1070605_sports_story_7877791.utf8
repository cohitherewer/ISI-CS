 Woolmer case a very bad joke: Pervez Mir

RICHARD SYDENHAM

Pakistan players are still angry over their treatment in the wake of Bob Woolmers death, despite reports indicating that it will be announced this week that the coach was not murdered. 

[Meanwhile, according to a British newspaper, India-born pathologist Dr Ere Seshaiah, who concluded that Woolmer was strangled, may lose his job as Jamaican police get ready to admit that he died of natural reasons, adds an agency report from London. 

The bungle in investigations has also put deputy police commissioner Mark Shields in the firing line and some Jamaican officers are saying that he is about to quit.] 

The Pakistan players and the backroom staff were finger-printed, swabbed for DNA and interviewed by police after Woolmers death during the World Cup in March. 

As far as the players, myself and the backroom staff are concerned, if Bob did die of natural causes as they are now saying, its not a question of relief as the players had nothing to do with his death, said Pervez (PJ) Mir, the teams spokesman at the World Cup and one of the first to find Woolmer unconscious. 

The players will feel annoyed and distressed because they have, at times, had fingers pointing at them and that was never fair. 

The whole World Cup was marred and taken over by the Woolmer case. It should have been all about the cricket, but the cricket was a sideshow. Its been a very bad joke. 

The Jamaican police have botched up the entire issue, Mir added. I always felt Bob died of natural causes. They have cocked up the entire investigation. 

Mir said he will soon be releasing a tape of correspondence with the Jamaican police from March 22, which is likely to underline his suspicions that Woolmer died naturally. Mir refused to release any details at this stage. 

News that Woolmers death was likely to have been down to natural causes has angered many in Pakistan. 

Younis Khan, formerly Pakistan vice-captain under Woolmer, was reluctant to discuss the issue after playing for Yorkshire Sunday, saying only: A lot of people made up stories. It was all invention. 

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is currently interviewing for a replacement for Woolmer, with former Surrey coach Steve Rixon heading the field.

 Jhulan pins hope on Dhoni in SA

 Jhulan Goswami 

New Delhi: Jhulan Goswami may be the fastest woman in cricket but the lanky Indian pacer insists line and length is more important to her than just challenging the speed gun. 

The 23-year-old Bengal-girl had pipped Australian Lisa Sthaleker and Claire Taylor of England to become the first Indian woman to bag the ICC Womens Cricketer of the Year award. 

It is a great feeling which cannot be translated into words but can be just felt inside. It makes you confident. The whose who of international cricket was present (at the awards ceremony) and from such a populous country like India there was only one winner. So it was obviously a dream come true, Jhulan said. 

Jhulan, who idolises former Australian pacer Glenn McGrath, said although her pace often has batters in trouble, she focuses on a consistent line and length. 

McGrath did not have the pace of Brett Lee but he was a bowling machine. So precise that he could land the ball on the same spot again and again, day in and day out. I would like to take his path to success, she said. 

Jhulan and Arjuna awardee Anjum Chopra, a former India captain, were felicitated by ICC president Ray Mali before the working committee met on Thursday morning. 

Jhulan also said former Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly was her source of inspiration. 

I derived a lot of inspiration from Sourav. The way he played, led and came back after being dropped from the side was incredible. I also look up to Sachin Tendulkar and Jawagal Srinath, Jhulan said. 

On the ongoing ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa, Jhulan said she has pinned her hopes on skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni for Indias success. 

I like the way he bats and his overall approach to the game. I pray he leads us to ICC World Twenty20 triumph, she said. 

Jhulan, who averaged 12.40 in Tests and 21.80 in ODIs last year, has now set her sights on the upcoming Asia Cup. I am preparing for the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka (December). I have not set any goal for myself and would like to continue the way I have been performing. 

Her best bowling came against England when she took five for 33 in the first innings of the Taunton Test and helped India register a five-wicket victory. 

Although she has best score of 69 in Tests, Jhulan does not consider herself an allrounder. 

I would like to be known as a bowler who can bat a bit. Of course there is room for improvement in my batting but I am not a genuine allrounder, she signed off.

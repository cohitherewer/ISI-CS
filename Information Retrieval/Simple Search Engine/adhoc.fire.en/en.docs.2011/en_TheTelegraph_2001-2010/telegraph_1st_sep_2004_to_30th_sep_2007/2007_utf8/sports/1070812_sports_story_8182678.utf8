 India U-21 in semi-finals

New Delhi: Pramod Kumar struck in the closing minutes as India came from behind to snatch a 2-1 victory over hosts Germany to make the semi-finals of the eight-nation under-21 hockey meet in Monchengladbach. 

T. Blasberg converted a penalty corner in the 11th to give the hosts an early lead, but J. Singh levelled in the 23rd before Pramod struck in the 67th to seal the win. 

The Germans earned as many as five penalty corners , but the Indian defenders and keeper Sreejesh fended off those threats. 

In the last four, the undefeated Indians will take on Belgium, while The Netherlands take on Spain. (PTI)

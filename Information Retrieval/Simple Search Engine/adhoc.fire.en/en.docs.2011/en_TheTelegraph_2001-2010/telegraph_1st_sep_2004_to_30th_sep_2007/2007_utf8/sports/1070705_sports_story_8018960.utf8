Birmingham: The West Indies beat England by 61 runs on Wednesday with Shivnarine Chanderpauls unbeaten 116 helping to level the three-match limited overs series. 

Chanderpauls century moved the West Indies to 278 for five from 50 overs after being sent into bat by England at Edgbaston. 

England, who were 64 for three early on, then stumbled to 172 for seven and was all out for 217 after 46 overs. Ravi Rampaul took four for 41. 

England wicketkeeper Matthew Prior made his first one-day half century and topscored with 52, but Ian Bell, Kevin Pietersen and new one-day captain Paul Collingwood failed to reach double figures. 

Chanderpaul was promoted two places to No. 3 and came in with the West Indies on 67 for two. He reached his seventh one-day century with a single in the West Indies 47th over and was given a standing ovation. 

Chanderpaul hit nine boundaries and three sixes in his 122-ball knock and limped off at the end of the innings with a sore ankle and did not field. 

He helped add 102 runs in the last 10 overs. England missed the chance to remove Chanderpaul when he was on 72 when Collingwood dived to catch a high ball over mid off, but could not get a hand to it. 

Samuels hit three consecutive fours off James Anderson in an over that reaped 18 runs and pushed him to 73. He made 77 before he was caught by Ryan Sidebottom in the gully off Broad. 

The West Indies opener Devon Smith made 17 before he edged a delivery from Anderson to Prior. Chris Gayle (36) fell when trying to smash successive sixes off Sidebottom. 

The West Indies final two wickets fell for 26 runs. 

Stuart Broad had Englands best bowling figures of two for 49, while Sidebottom, who returned after a virus ruled him out of Englands 79-run win in the first one-day International on Sunday, took two for 56. 

Prior made 52 before he was caught at midwicket by Devon Smith off Daren Powell.

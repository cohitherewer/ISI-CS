 Ponting cleared for India

Melbourne: The Australian cricket team breathed a huge sigh of relief on Thursday when captain Ricky Ponting was cleared for the upcoming seven-match one-day series in India. 

Cricket Australias (CA) National Selection Panel (NSP) confirmed that Ponting, who suffered a hamstring strain during the ongoing ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa, would remain in the squad for the tour of India. 

The right-hander was, however, ruled out of any further participation in the Twenty20 tournament, in which Australia reached the last four defeating Sri Lanka by 10 wickets in Cape Town on Thursday. 

Ponting would continue his rehabilitation in South Africa before departing with the rest of the Australian squad next week, NSP chairman Andrew Hilditch said. 

Ricky Ponting is making excellent progress following his hamstring strain in the game against Pakistan on Tuesday. Ricky will be coming on the Travelex tour of India and will resume playing as soon as he is medically cleared, Hilditch said in a CA release. 

The Australian team is scheduled to leave South Africa for India on September 25 for a tour, which will also feature a Twenty20 game. The first match is scheduled for September 29 in Bangalore. 

However, it is not certain whether Ponting would be able to play in all the matches in India and so Brad Haddin has been added to the touring party as cover. (PTI)

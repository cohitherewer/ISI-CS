 Bopara, Broad have wise heads 

DEREK PRINGLE

Exciting young cricketers can sometimes get ahead of themselves, which is what happened to England at Old Trafford on Thursday when chasing Indias low total of 212. Fortunately, the two youngest, Ravi Bopara and Stuart Broad, possessed heads wise enough to see their team through with a record England partnership for the eighth wicket. 

Faced with chasing the lowest total of the series, England were 114 for seven and making a complete hash of matters under the Old Trafford lights until 21-year-old Broad joined 22-year-old Bopara in the 24th over. Cutting a contrasting pair at the crease Bopara bright and busy, Broad all long levers the pair went to work, finishing the job off with 12 balls to spare. 

It looked nerveless too, an impressive feature given the pairs relative lack of experience. With no time pressure, because of Englands speed out of the blocks at the start of their innings (89 for four after 15 overs), they were able eschew risk and build their 99-run stand through singles. 

With the odd boundary and shoddy fielding from India helping their cause, they got the target down to 41 runs of the last 10 overs. It was at that point that Broad should have been given out lbw sweeping at wrist-spinner Piyush Chawla. Fortunately for England, umpire Ian Gould saw it differently and the tall-rounder, who had taken his best one-day bowling figures of four for 51, survived to strike the winning runs. 

It was nearly so different following Englands confused batting approach up the order. Ian Bells decision to give it a whack was risky and flawed. Indeed his dismissal, which followed hard on that of the openers, Alastair Cook and Matt Prior, handed India the belief that they could win the match despite their paltry total. 

That belief magnified when Kevin Pietersen was out nine overs later, looping a rash hook shot off Ajit Agarkar to Chawla at square leg. Agarkar bowled every bit as impressively here as Englands new ball pairing of James Anderson and Broad, who took three and four wickets respectively. 

Although lacking in wickets, Andrew Fintoff was arguably the pick of the pace bowlers on display, but his allrounder status must be in question following another failure with the bat. Having looked clueless against Chawlas wrist-spin, he sliced Agarkar in the air perilously close to backward point. But while that one went for four, a repeat of the shot two balls later, over a stiff front leg (a technical glitch that makes front foot shots go up rather than down) found the safe hands of Yuvraj Singh. 

All the while Paul Collingwood batted with a calm assurance at odds with the mayhem occurring at the other end. It looked as if the captain would have to win the game off his own bat, a distinct possibility when he was nonchalantly flicking fours off his legs but not once he was run out for 47 after hesitating, despite it being his call, over a quick single. 

Pietersens impact on this NatWest Series with the bat has so far been modest, but not so with the ball. Sending down an over of his occasional off-breaks, Pietersen managed to take the vital wicket of Indias star batsman, Sachin Tendulkar. 

Tendulkar was going well, having just passed 50 when Pietersen struck in the 30th over. It was hardly a clever or skilful piece of bowling, rather a case of batsman error as the little master top-edged a pull to deep midwicket, where Flintoff took a running catch. 

India might have succumbed very cheaply, but Yuvraj, targeting the 20 overs that Flintoff, Broad and Anderson could not bowl, made sure his team would have a reasonable total to defend with an innings that began slowly but then accelerated until his dismissal by Broad in the 45th over.

 Mixed luck for Moya, Murray

Hamburg: Carlos Moya sped into the second round of the Hamburg Masters with a 6-0, 6-3 victory over Mardy Fish on Tuesday but Britains Andy Murray had a 20th birthday to forget as he was forced out with a painful wrist injury. 

Murray looked well on course to match Moyas easy win as he took the first 12 points off Italian Filippo Volandri and extended his lead to 5-1 in their first-round match. 

His tournament was over in the next game, however. The British world No. 10 jarred his right wrist as he played a routine forehand and dropped his racket in pain. After having his wrist strapped up he returned to the court but managed just two points before dropping his racket in agony again. 

Murray was immediately taken to hospital for a scan, an ATP spokesman said. 

The injury will be a worry for Murray with the French Open starting in less than two weeks and Wimbledon next month. 

Volandri will go on to face Jose Acasuso of Argentina who beat Spains Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 6-3, 6-4 in an earlier match at the 2.1-million euro claycourt tournament on Tuesday. 

On a good day for Spain, 19-year-old qualifier Oscar Hernandez beat Benjamin Becker in a gruelling three-setter on the slow clay court to set up a clash with Rafael Nadal in the second round. 

Later, in one of three second-round matches on Tuesday, another Spaniard, the 12th-seeded David Ferrer, saw off Robin Soderling of Sweden 1-6, 6-3, 6-2. 

Nicolas Almagro upset defending champion Tommy Robredo 6-7, 6-2, 6-4 in a bruising all-Spanish clash to reach the third round. 

Top seeds Roger Federer and Nadal have byes through to the second round and will not be in singles action until Wednesday. 

Federer will take on Juan Monaco after the Argentine beat Dominik Hrbaty on Monday. 

Nadal is on a 77-match winning streak but he expects a few difficulties against his countryman Hernandez, who looked full of promise as he kept the counter-punching Becker at bay in a 6-3, 6-7, 6-3 win. (Reuters)

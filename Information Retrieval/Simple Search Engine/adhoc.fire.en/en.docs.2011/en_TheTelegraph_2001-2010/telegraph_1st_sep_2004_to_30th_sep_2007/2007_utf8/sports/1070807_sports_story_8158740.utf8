 EUROPEAN CLUB UPDATE 

Terry likely to be out for a month

London: Chelsea captain John Terry will miss

 up to a month of the new Premier League season because of a knee injury. The

 England central defender missed Chelseas Community Shield defeat to Manchester

 United on Sunday after damaging medial knee ligaments in training. Last season,

 Terry was out for two months due to a back injury.

He is also likely to miss Englands friendly against Germany on August 22. He is also doubtful for the European Championship qualifiers against Israel on September 8 and versus Russia four days later. Defenders Ledley King and Jonathan Woodgate are also expected to miss those matches due to injuries. 

Ballack denial 

 London: Chelsea midfielder Michael Ballack has dismissed media reports of a possible transfer to Real Madrid by underlining his desire to be a success at Stamford Bridge. 

I am totally committed to Chelsea, the Germany captain told the clubs official website on Monday. I came here to win trophies and be successful in English football, I want to assure the Chelsea fans of that. The speculation about me leaving is not true. I have no interest in leaving Chelsea and I have had no contact with Real Madrid whatsoever. 

Reds sign Baines 

Liverpool: Everton has agreed a fee with Wigan to sign left back Leighton Baines. The England under-21 international had medical tests and discussed personal terms with the Toffees on Monday. Baines turned down a transfer to Sunderland last week after the clubs had agreed to a fee. Wigan then rejected a bid from Everton of 4 million plus a player reported to be Andy van der Meyde that Everton rated at 2 million. 

Coupet surgery 

Lyon: Lyon goalkeeper Gregory Coupet had successful surgery on Monday on his left knee, which he seriously injured last week. The France international was sidelined after tearing a ligament in his knee on Thursday during practice.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I prefer the hard route to success, says RP

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chittagong: Rudra Pratap Singh wants no short cuts to success. Rather, he is ready to win a Team India berth through sheer hard work. 

Selectors didnt consider him good enough for Test cricket after his debut series in Pakistan in January-February last year. 

He was not included in the World Cup squad despite a good domestic season. 

Even during the ongoing tour of Bangladesh he was supposed to return home after the ODIs, but luck smiled on him following Sreesanths injury. 

Rudra Pratap, better known as RP, admitted on Monday that it was tough to make the Test cut again after over a year. 

Its a kind of comeback for me, but not an easy journey after playing the last Test over a year back, the Uttar Pradesh quick, who took three for 45 against Bangladesh in the first innings, said. 

I have self-belief. I know if I am consistent, things will fall in place. There is healthy competition among a number of bowlers now. But rather than luck, I prefer the hard route to success, he said on Monday. 

RP, who attributed his three wickets to a nagging line and length, sounded disappointed that follow-on could not be enforced. 

We sort of let them off the hook after reducing them to 149 for eight. But there is still a lot of cricket left. We dont have any control over the weather, but given another chance we will go for victory, the 22-year-old said. 

However, a thunderstorm that lashed the city late on Monday night may play spoilsport. 

Mashrafe Mortaza, whose ninth-wicket stand with Shahadat Hossain helped Bangladesh avoid follow-on, said their understanding in spearheading the attack was key to the partnership. 

We understand each other quite well. It helped in the long run, Mortaza said. 

Mortaza destroyed India with a four-wicket haul in the World Cup. Are you extra-motivated while playing against India? 

Thats not the case. I try to motivate myself against big teams, thats it, he smil-ed.

 Barreto saves day for Mohun Bagan 

 Barreto hit the extra-time winner against ONGC on Thursday 

Ludhiana: Jose Ramirez Barreto came to Mohun Bagans rescue once again, scoring an extra-time winner against ONGC to help the defending champions book a place in the quarter finals of the 29th Federation Cup on Thursday. 

Mohun Bagan went ahead through an own goal by Gulidon Rongmoi in the 32nd minute, but Jatin Bisht equalised for ONGC with seven minute to go from regulation time. As the teams went into extra-time, Barreto settled the matter in the 107th. 

Carlos Roberto Pereiras team will now face Viva Kerala in the quarter final on Sunday. 

For all of Mohun Bagans dominance in the first-half, it needed a defensive lapse in the 32nd minute for the green-and-maroon brigade to get ahead. 

A corner-kick from the left flank by Lalkamal Bhowmick found Rongmoi at the near post, who, in a bid to clear the ball in haste, sliced it into his own net past a hapless Rajat Ghosh Dastidar. 

Mohun Bagans midfield was having a field day in the beginning with former national captain S. Venkatesh and Dharamjit Singh finding space all over and supplying balls to the striking pair of Bhaichung Bhutia and Barreto. 

Leading a club for the first time in his career, India captain Bhaichung, however, seemed a bit short on sharpness. 

Tarif Ahmed frequently cut a lonely figure up front for ONGC as he was frequently outnumbered by Mohun Bagan defenders. 

The second-half was a more even contest without many goalmouth chances as the battle was largely restricted to midfield. 

Barreto sent a tantalising cross for Bhaichung from the left but the latter headed wide. The captain went closer 10 minutes from the end when his header found the upright. 

His ONGC counterpart, Bisht, though didnt miss the opportunity. Having received a ball halfway into the Bagan territory seven minutes from time, he was allowed to go unchallenged before firing a strong shot past Sangram Mukherjee. 

Pereira brought on striker Lalawmpuia for Lalkamal but Rajat kept his side alive in the game through some remarkable saves. 

During extra-time, he kept Barreto out with his outstretched legs and then blocked Venkateshs shot off the rebound as Mohun Bagan upped their ante in search for the winner. It finally came through the peerless Barreto, heading Jamess cross into the goal. 

I knew the first match would be difficult. Their defence was very good and we missed a few chances. Our midfield was also not very sharp, Pereira later said.

 FPAI likely to meet Colaco

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Football Players Association of India (FPAI) is likely to send a two-member team to meet AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco in a bid to settle the contentious issues mentioned in the model contract for players. The meeting may take place on Monday. 

According to FPAI executive officer and former international goalkeeper, Sumit Mukherjee, an alternative model will be presented to Colaco. 

We are trying to work out certain clauses that will make things easier for the players. We hope to finish it by Friday and then meet Colaco, Mukherjee said. 

FPAI president Bhaichung Bhutia and Mukherjee are expected to meet Colaco in New Delhi. 

Colaco, who had earlier said that the proposed contract is only a model one and not binding on the players, said he was ready to meet FPAI representatives. I have spoken to Bhutia and told him that the meeting can take place any day, Colaco said on Wednesday. 

According to him, the federation is open to any changes in the contract. But the changes should be done according to the AIFF constitution and the rules and regulations of Fifa.Incidentally, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has also sent in directives for some alterations to the proposed contracts.

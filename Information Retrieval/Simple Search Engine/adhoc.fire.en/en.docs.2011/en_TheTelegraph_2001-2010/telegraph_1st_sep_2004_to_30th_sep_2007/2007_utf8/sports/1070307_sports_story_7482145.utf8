 Moral win: Chima

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Chima Okerie stood by his young players and even claimed a moral victory after Mohun Bagan and Tampines Rovers played out a goalless draw on Tuesday. 

The youngsters showed a lot of promise and it will definitely give us confidence ahead of the upcoming challenges in the National League, the Mohun Bagan coach said. 

He also backed strikers PC Lalawmpuia and Sushil Kumar Singh, despite their failure to convert chances. 

They are talented but need time and backing from everybody. Even I went goalless almost half a season during my playing days. Im not losing sleep over such things. The positive thing is that they are creating chances and thats more heartening for me, he said. 

Chima refused to buy the suggestion that Bhaichung Bhutias experience was missed upfront or Dipendu Biswas could have been a better option there. Chima, however, said that he would sit with the strikers and try to rectify their mistakes. 

Tampines Rovers coach Chitavanich Vorawan, pointed out that Mohd Noa Alam Shah bin Kamarezamans early departure due to injury had upset their plans. But we are happy with the result, he said.

 Plunkett axed

London: Seamer Matthew Hoggard has been named in Englands 12-man squad for the fourth and final Test against the West Indies, but there is no room for Liam Plunkett in the match which starts in Durham on Friday. Hoggard, however, needs to prove his fitness after missing the last two Tests with a groin injury.

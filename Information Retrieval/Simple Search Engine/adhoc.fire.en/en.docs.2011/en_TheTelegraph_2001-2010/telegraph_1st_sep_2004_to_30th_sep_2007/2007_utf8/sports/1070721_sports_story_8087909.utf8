 London: England struck 

 back after a late innings collapse to have India at 145 

 for four at stumps on the second day of the first Test on 

 Friday, after taking the prize wickets of Sachin Tendulkar 

 and Rahul Dravid.

 India had produced a vastly improved 

 bowling performance to dismiss England for 298 after play 

 started three hours late at Lords because of rain. 

 India were 153 runs behind at close.

 Indias inexperienced pace 

 attack, which had struggled on Day I, took advantage of 

 helpful conditions and Englands last six wickets collapsed 

 for 26 runs. 

 England responded by reducing 

 India to 36 for two at tea, before Sachin and Wasim Jaffer 

 steadied the innings with a 79-run third wicket partnership.

 Sachin seeking his first century 

 at Lords on possibly his last tour of England was 

 dismissed leg before by fast bowler James Anderson for 37.

 He still moved up one place to 

 third on the list of Test crickets highest run scorers, 

 moving past Australias Steve Waugh. Sachin now has 

 10,959 runs in 138 Tests.

 Retired West Indies batsman Brian 

 Lara has the most number of runs 11,953 in 131 Tests. 

 Shortly before Sachins dismissal, which left India 

 on 106 for three, Jaffer notched his seventh Test fifty 

 and his second at Lords when he took four runs off 

 a Monty Panesar delivery.

 Jaffer struggled to deal with 

 the fast bowling of Chris Tremlett and became the England 

 rookies first Test wicket. Tremlett took a low returned 

 catch to dismiss Jaffer for 58 and leave India on 134 for 

 four.

 No. 5 Sourav Ganguly was on 24 

 in the 55th over when he began stretching at the crease 

 in apparent discomfort, but he kept batting until stumps, 

 hobbling between wickets. He finished not out 25. 

 Rudra Pratap Singh, who was lucky 

 to avoid a run out after beginning a risky single on 3, 

 was not out 5. India lost opener Dinesh Karthik when he 

 was trapped leg before by Ryan Sidebottom in the ninth over 

 to make it 18 for one. Dravid, the captain, followed three 

 overs later, edging Anderson to wicketkeeper Matthew Prior.

 Earlier, Indian bowlers Zaheer 

 Khan and Sreesanth extracted movement from the pitch to 

 prevent England from getting the huge total they had hoped 

 for when play resumed on 268 for four.

 Sreesanth took three wickets to 

 finish with three for 67, while Khan got rid of Kevin Pietersen 

 and Ian Bell to take two for 58.

 Zaheer bowled nightwatchman Sidebottom 

 for one in Fridays first full over, and Pietersen 

 almost went in the second. Dhoni appealed for a catch behind 

 off Khan and Pietersen walked toward the pavilion without 

 protest.

 Umpire Simon Taufel gave Pietersen 

 out, reducing England to 276 for six, but Pietersen then 

 caught sight of a television replay that clearly showed 

 the ball had bounced before reaching the wicketkeepers 

 gloves. Instructed by his teammates, Pietersen turned around 

 and strolled back to the middle.

 Taufel reversed his decision amid 

 the confusion but Pietersen lasted only until Zaheers 

 next over, edging the seamer to Dhoni and departing for 

 37.

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: After struggling for more than 10 hours in the Football House here on Thursday, the AIFF officials and the representatives of the participating clubs were finally able to chalk out the draw for the National Football League (NFL) till the ninth round. 

The AIFF officials, however, didnt rule out minor changes as they have asked the club bosses to file objections in case they have any. We began the meeting at 12 noon and finished well after 10 pm, said a club official. First we thought of extending the league till June 10, but then it was decided to wrap it up by the third week of May.

 Martina Hingis survives a scare

Wimbledon: Roger Federer came to the Centre Court at Wimbledon dressed like a player from a bygone era. He then played like his usual modern-day great self. 

The top-ranked Swiss began his bid for a record equalling fifth consecutive Wimbledon title on Monday by beating Teimuraz Gabashvili of Russia 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 on a cool and wet opening day at the All England Club. 

It was Federers 49th consecutive grasscourt victory and 29th straight at Wimbledon, a streak dating back to 2003. With six more victories over the next two weeks, he would become the first player to win five straight championships since Bjorn Bjorg in 1976-80. 

It was OK, Federer said. I was pretty pleased with my performance. It was pretty solid. He played a decent match, so I had to come up with some decent shots once in a while. 

The man Federer has beaten in two finals, third-seeded Andy Roddick, also got off to a strong start, beating fellow American Justin Gimelstob 6-1, 7-5, 7-6 (7-3) on Court 1. Roddick served 16 aces, broke three times and never lost serve. Gimelstob is 0-6 this year since returning from back surgery. 

Former Wimbledon champion Martina Hingis overcame a big scare, saving two match points in the second set against 18-year-old British wild card Naomi Cavaday before taking nine straight games to win 6-7 (1-7), 7-5, 6-0. 

Hingis has been sidelined for five weeks with a back injury and struggled against Cavaday, who forced two match points on the Swiss serve in the second set. I dont see myself right now after todays match as a contender, Hingis, who won the title as a 16-year-old, told a news conference. 

Hingis said her doctor had put her at only 60 to 70 per cent fit but the world number 11, who returned to tennis in 2006 after three years out, could not bear to miss the grasscourt Grand Slam. 

As is so often the case at Wimbledon, the tournament began in wet weather, with play getting under way after a rain delay of about two hours, 40 minutes. Play was suspended later in the afternoon because of more rain. 

In keeping with tradition, Federer was the first player to walk onto Centre Court as defending mens champion. He did it in style, wearing a white customised dinner-style jacket similar to the cream-coloured model he donned last year with a gold crest and letters RF on the breast pocket and retro long white trousers. 

Matching shoes, matching pants, matching vest and headband, Federer said. Its a very nice outfit. 

Federer needed only one and half hours to complete the victory, finishing with 33 winners and 13 unforced errors. (Agencies)

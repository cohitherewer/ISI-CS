The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Impasse a setback for Sharad Pawar

 - No recommendation from panel 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Less than two months after Team India got

 thrashed by Graeme Smiths men in the deciding Test at Newlands, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) chief Sharad Pawar failed to get the Nominations Committees recommendation as the one best suited to succeed Percy Sonn as the world bodys

 president. 

Cape Town may be more than picture postcard perfect, but its not quite a happy hunting ground for Indians. Its little consolation that England amp; Wales Cricket Board chief David Morgan, the other contender, also didnt get a recommendation in his favour. 

On the face of it, this impasse affects both candidates, but its a bigger setback for Pawar as the Committee is headed by former BCCI president Dr A.C. Muthiah, whod backed him in his two-year fight against Jagmohan Dalmiya. 

Dalmiya, incidentally, is the first Asian to sit in the International Cricket Council (ICC) supremos chair. 

As first reported by The Telegraph on Wednesday,

 each contender had the support of three Committee members: Muthiah (representing

 India and Sri Lanka), Mueen Afzal (Pakistan and Bangladesh) and Imran Khwaja

 (Associates and Affiliates) backed Pawar, while Morgan had the support of Bob

 Merriman (Australia and New Zealand), Steve Camacho (England and West Indies)

 and John Blair (South Africa and Zimbabwe). 

Clearly, off the field, England and Australia act in unison. Theres no Ashes to fight for. 

According to well-placed sources in Cape Town, where the ICCs Executive Board began two-day deliberations on Thursday, the Committees request for another meeting to resolve the impasse was turned down. 

The principal reason, of course, being that the Board wouldnt meet again before the annual conference (or annual general meeting) in June. While an official announcement is awaited, one understands the successor-issue will now be placed before the general body. 

For a candidate to be successful, he must at least have the backing of seven of the ten Full (Test-playing) Members. Pawar has the assured support of five (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe) and there are whispers that South Africa is actually close to being pocketed. 

Even if thats the current scenario, Pawar (who is in Cape Town) has to get the West Indies vote if he wants to become the second Indian to hold crickets No.1 position. Were really in no hurry... Were working hard to get the West Indies on our side, pointed out somebody close to the BCCI chief. 

Sonns term is to end in June 2008, but he could be granted a one-year extension.

 Essien released on bail

London: Chelsea midfielder Michael Essien was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving early on Monday and released a few hours later on bail, media reported. The Ghana international was stopped by police in South London at 5.10 a.m. and asked to take a breath test after which he was arrested and taken to a police station for a blood test, said a daily. 

Essien, suspended for the first leg of Chelseas Champions League semi-final against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday, has been bailed until a date in July, it added. 

Another newspaper said that Essien had been clubbing with friends and a blood sample was over the legal limit.

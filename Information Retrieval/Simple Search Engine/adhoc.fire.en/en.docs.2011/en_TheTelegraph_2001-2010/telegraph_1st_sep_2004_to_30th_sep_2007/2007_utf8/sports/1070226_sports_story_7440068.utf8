 Stenson, Ogilvy in final

 WGC Match Play Championship 

Marana (Arizona): Swede Henrik Stenson, seemingly nerveless throughout the day, booked his place in the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship final with a 3 amp;2 victory over South Africas Trevor Immelman on Saturday. 

Stenson, who conjured a miracle escape over the last two holes against Australias Nick Hern in the mornings quarter finals, sealed the win when both players parred the 16th. 

Moments later, title-holder Geoff Ogilvy of Australia triumphed 3 amp;2 in his semi-final against American Chad Campbell when he rolled in an 18-foot birdie putt, also on the 16th. 

US Open champion Ogilvy, who beat PGA Tour veteran Davis Love III 3 amp;2 in last years final at La Costa Resort and Spa, has won 11 consecutive matches at the event. 

Stenson, who held off Ernie Els and Tiger Woods to clinch his fifth European Tour title at this months Dubai Desert Classic, never trailed in his match with Immelman at Dove Mountains Gallery Golf Club. 

He took immediate control with a two-putt birdie at the first, holed a 26-footer to birdie the fourth and went three up with another birdie at the par-five fifth.

 Sreesanth to fly home

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chittagong: Sreesanth will return home after failing a fitness test on Tuesday. No fresh replacement will be sought as Rudra Pratap Singh will stay back for the Test series. 

The pacer, who was diagnosed with a strain on his left calf muscle, was injured while fielding during the opening one-dayer in Mirpur. 

Physio John Gloster conducted a fitness test at the hotel. The decision to send him back was taken in consultation with selection committee chairman Dilip Vengsarkar. 

Sreesanth will consult Dr Anant Joshi on return.

 Dravid: Need to keep up energy levels

A CORRESPONDENT

Leeds: India go into the fifth match on Sunday against England trailing 1-3 in the seven-match series. 

Indian skipper Rahul Dravid, however, asserted that Indians have previously played some good cricket with their backs to the wall and that its all a question of going out and executing their plans to perfection. 

In the last ten days of whats been a good tour, we want to finish strong and as successful as we can, Dravid said. Maybe we need to maintain the energy levels right throughtowards the last 25-30 runs. I thought the boys tried putting in everything they had. Especially the bowlers. 

Dravid insisted that though the loss was disappointing, it was not damaging for the team morale. Weve also got to recognise that there were two young boys who batted sensibly with the advantage that they only needed 3.5 runs an over. Our focus was to get a wicket or push it to 4.5. They didnt allow it to go over 4. 

The Indian captain felt that the sides fielding was much-improved in the last game. 

 He praised Ajit Agarkars bowling. Ajits got some good rhythm... We knew we needed wickets in that game and he came back well. 

The young England side, he felt, was good. Lot of their players are maturing. There is more balance. 

The conditions do suit them. If this was in India, Collingwood or their fast bowlers wouldnt have made the same impact. 

The challenge will be to go out in their own conditions and compete successfully. Australia are the only team to do that. 

England captain Paul Collingwood knows winning this series will mean a lot. It will mean a lot. To win three games so far is a good achievement. Weve got one more game to win but we want to win the last three.

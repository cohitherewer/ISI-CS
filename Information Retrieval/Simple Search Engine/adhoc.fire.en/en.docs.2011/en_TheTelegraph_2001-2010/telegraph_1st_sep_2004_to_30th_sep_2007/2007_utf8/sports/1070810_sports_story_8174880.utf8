Calcutta: Having realised his dream of playing in Calcutta, Mohun Bagan striker Ishfaq Ahmeds focus is now trained on plying his trade on foreign shores. And it may not be long before he gets a chance to fulfil ambition No. 2. 

The 24-year-old from Srinagar is likely to visit England to attend trials at a couple of second division clubs. I had sent my CV to some of the second division clubs in England, of which two have responded Ishfaq told The Telegraph after Thursdays practice at the Mohun Bagan ground. 

Itll be a great honour if they call me Ill probably go if I get Mohun Bagans permission said Ishfaq, who scored Indias winning goal in the 2003-04 Olympic qualifier against Turkmenistan. 

Bhaichung Bhutia, the only Indian to have played for an English side (second division FC Bury), said: Itll be nice if he gets a call. 

He did, however, wish that Ishfaq had gone two or three weeks earlier. The season has already begun.

 Pradeep blow for Mahindra 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

Ludhiana: Mahindra United once again came through in the shootout at the Guru Nanak Stadium on Wednesday to enter the Federation Cup final after a gap of one year. They had won their last match against Sporting Clube de Goa also through a penalty shootout. 

Pitted against the mighty Dempo SC, the Mumbai outfit won the battle 3-1 in tie-breaker after the regulation time and extended sessions ended 1-1. In Saturdays final, Mahindra United will take on East Bengal, whose coach Subrata Bhattacharya watched the proceedings keenly but refused to comment. 

The absence of NP Pradeep in the final because of a double booking should be good news for East Bengal. 

Dempo did little to deserve a win. Their poor form continued in the shootout too as Subhashish Roy Chowdhury saved shots from Roberto Silva (Beto) and Ranty Martins. In between, to add to Dempos woes, Climax Lawrence ballooned the ball over the bar. Nigerian Edeh Chidi was the only one successful. 

Mahindra, who fought well during regulation time thanks to some good tactical play by Pradeep and Ajayan, didnt miss out in the tie-breaker. Pradeep, Harpreet Singh and Djiaja Pierre hit the target with measured shots.

Mahindra United: Sandeep Nandy (Subhasis Roy Chowdhury, 119th); Harpreet Singh, N.P. Pradeep and Dharmaraj Ravanan; Sushant Mathew, Djiaja Pierre, Sukhwinder Singh, K. Ajayan and Izumi Arata (Mohammed Rafi, 56th); Minga Dico (Andrew Pomiyie, 73rd) and Manjit Singh.

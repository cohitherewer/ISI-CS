 Mahindra first to make semis

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Ludhiana: Bibiano Fernandes, Sporting Club de Goas hero in the regulation time, ended up the villain in the tie-breaker as Mahindra United became the first team to sail into the semi-finals of the 29th Federation Cup football tournament at the Guru Nanak Dev Stadium here on Saturday. 

The famed Mumbai outfit was stretched for 120 minutes before they could beat the resilient Goan team 5-4 in the tie-breaker. The regulation time ended in a 1-1 draw and 30 minutes of extra time failed to break the deadlock. 

Ironically, it was Bibiano Fernandes who brought the Goans back into the game after Ajayans wonderful strike in the 29th minute put Mahindra in the lead. Sporting equalised through a penalty kick in the 76th minute when their Nigerian striker Olushola Ogundare was brought down by defender Gautam Debnath. 

Bibiano put Goans on level terms with a perfect shot, but made the mistake of missing the target in the tie-breaker. It made all the difference as he was the only one from both the teams to bungle with the spot-kick. 

In the tie-breaker, NP Pradeep, Steven Dias, Djiaja Pierre, Manjit Singh and Surojit Bose struck for Mahindra. For Sporting, Bishweshar Singh, Nicolas Muyoti, Rajesh Meetei and Olushola Ogundare got the goals. Sporting, however, lodged a protest against the referee for disallowing a goal scored for them by Ogundare in the second half. The Nigerian was ruled offside by the assistant referee. 

TEAMS 

Mahindra United: Sandeep Nandy (Subhasis Roychowdhury, 118th); Sushant Mathew, Gautam Debnath, Harpreet Singh and NP Pradeep; Steven Dias, K. Ajayan, Djiaja Pierre and Sunil Kumar; Mohammed Rafi (Surojit Bose, 76th) and Minga Edson Dico (Manjit Singh, 46th). 

Sporting Clube de Goa: Luis Barreto; Chandrashekar Chinta, Felip Gomes, Nicolas Muyoti and Rajesh Meetei; Bibian Fernandes, Harmanjot Khabra, Micky Fernandes (Bishweshar Singh, 70th) and Joseph Pereira; Boniface Ambani (Freddy Mascarenhas, 45th, Cavin Lobo, 97th) and Olushola Ogundabe.

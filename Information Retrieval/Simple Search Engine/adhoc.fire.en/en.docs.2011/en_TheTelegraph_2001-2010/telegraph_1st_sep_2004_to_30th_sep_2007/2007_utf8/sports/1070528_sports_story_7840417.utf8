The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 DAY III HIGHLIGHTS

 This 

 was the 26th time India have enforced the follow-on. With 

 Sundays victory over Bangladesh, they have now won 

 on 16 occasions while the other 10 have ended in draws. 

 Bangladesh were following on for the eighth time on Sunday. 

 They have lost on occasions.

 India secured a first innings 

 lead of 492 runs. This figures ninth in the list of biggest 

 first innings leads. For the record, the biggest lead taken 

 by any side in a Test was 702, when England defeated Australia 

 at The Oval in 1938.

 However, it is the biggest first 

 innings lead by India in a Test. In Calcutta (1997-98), 

 India had a 400-run lead over Australia.

 Anil Kumble went past the 550-wicket 

 mark on Sunday. He now has 552 wickets in 115 Tests.

 Kumble also equalled Shane Warnes 

 record of most lbw victims. Both are tied on 138. Warne, 

 however, reached the target in 145 matches to Kumbles 

 115.

 Mohammed Rafique, when on nine 

 in first innings, completed 1000 Test runs. He became the 

 fifth Bangladeshi batsman to do so. He also has 93 wickets.

 Javed Omars king pair (out 

 first ball in both innings) was the 12th such instance in 

 Test cricket. Interestingly, the last two instances of a 

 king pair have been against India. Adam Gilchrist in Calcutta 

 (2000-01) and now Omar in Dhaka (2006-07).

 Omar also has the dubious distinction 

 of becoming the first opening batsman to grab a king pair.

 Mohammed Ashraful (67 off 41 

 balls) got to his 50 in 26 balls. He equalled Ian Botham 

 (Delhi, 1981-82) and Shahid Afridi (Bangalore, 2004-05), 

 all of whom got to 50 in 26 balls against India.

 Ashraful now has the fastest 

 50 by a Bangladesh batsman. He eclipsed Tapash Baisya, who 

 scored a half-century off 35 balls against New Zealand in 

 Chittagong. South Africas Jacques Kallis holds the 

 record with his 50 off 24 balls versus Zimbabwe in Cape 

 Town (2004-05).

 Rajin Saleh, when on two in the 

 second innings, completed 1000 runs in Tests. He is the 

 sixth Bangladesh batsman to reach the milestone. It took 

 him 19 matches.

 Sundays victory was Indias 

 sixth three-day win and their first against Bangladesh. 

 They now have three-day wins against the following nations:

 Vs Pak (Delhi, Oct. 18, 1952)

 Vs NZ (Bangalore, Oct. 20, 1995)

 Vs Aus (Mumbai, Nov. 05, 2004)

 Vs Zim (Harare, Sept. 22, 2005)

 Vs WI (Kingston, July 2, 2006)

 Vs Ban (Dhaka, May 27, 2007)

 Indias win by an innings 

 and 239 runs is their biggest in Tests. Their previous record 

 was against Australia (an innings amp; 219 runs, Calcutta, 

 1997-98).

 This was the fourth time Bangladesh 

 have lost by an innings and 200-plus runs.

 Indias biggest win against 

 Bangladesh came in 2004-05, when Bangladesh were beaten 

 by an innings amp; 140 runs in Dhaka (2004-05).

Madrid: Bernd Schusters Getafe staged the comeback of the season to thrash Barcelona 4-0 and snatch a place in their first ever Kings Cup final despite losing the first leg 2-5. 

Barcelona, who have won the competition 24 times, were outthought, outfought and outplayed by their modest opponents who claimed a thoroughly deserved 6-5 win on aggregate and will meet treble-chasing Sevilla in the final at the Bernabeu. 

Getafe laid siege to the Barcelona area from the first whistle, but despite creating a string of chances they did not take the lead until seven minutes before the break when midfielder Francisco Casquero volleyed home after a corner. 

Five minutes later striker Daniel Guiza added a second, clipping the ball past keeper Albert Jorquera after an error by defender Gianluca Zambrotta. 

Midfielder Angel Vivar Dorado put Getafe ahead on the away goals rule 25 minutes into the second half and Guiza added the icing on the cake with a fourth after yet another piece of shoddy defending by the out-of-sorts Barca back four. 

This goes to show just how beautiful football is, said an elated Schuster, a former Barcelona player. We were superb, we deserved it and Im so pleased for the players and the fans. Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard said that his sides humiliating defeat was one of the biggest disappointments of his career. 

We cant make any excuses, we suffered massively out there and I honestly dont think we can complain about the result Getafe deserved to win and we have to congratulate them, Rijkaard told a news conference after his sides 6-5 aggregate loss. 

This is one of the hardest nights Ive ever had to experience. I have to take my share of responsibility in this as coach and personally I have to ask forgiveness to the Barcelona fans for what has happened. 

Rijkaard admitted that the defeat could take its toll on the sides bid to defend the league title. 

Getafe warned us that this might happen but almost from the first minute we appeared incapable of reacting, said Rijkaard. It was a very hard night for us and will be difficult to digest. 

There are defeats and defeats and this one leaves us with a very ugly sensation. Sport is full of difficult moments and now we have to do everything we can to finish the season with dignity. 

We left a very bad impression out there and we have to react now.

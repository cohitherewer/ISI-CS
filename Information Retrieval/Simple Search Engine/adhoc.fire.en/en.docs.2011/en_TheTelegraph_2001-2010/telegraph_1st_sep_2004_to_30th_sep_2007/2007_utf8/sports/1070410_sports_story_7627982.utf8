The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Domestic players under scanner too

Mumbai: Days after cracking the whip on endorsements of national team players, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Monday said that even domestic players will have to get their sponsorship contracts cleared. 

We will ask all the affiliated units to find out how many of their players, if any, are having endorsement deals with sponsors and copies of these would hav to be sent to us, a source said. 

[According to a senior CAB official, no Bengal player, apart from Sourav Ganguly, has any personal endorsement, says A Staff Reporter in Calcutta.] 

Copies of any future sponsorship deals will also have to be sent to us, he said. 

We are not against players earning money through these deals but theres a strong feeling that the agents are exploiting some of these young cricketers and we want to prevent this from happening, he explained. 

Catch them young, seems to be the idea, with players in domestic cricket perceived as potential India material being induced to sign a contract that the agents feel will bear fruit in the long term when the cricketers go on to play for the country, according to the source.

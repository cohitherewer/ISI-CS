 A positive result: Mourinho

 Jose Mourinho 

London: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho said 1-0 was a positive result to take to Liverpool next week despite frustration that his side could not score more goals in their Champions League semi-final first leg. 

A first-half strike from Joe Cole separated the teams, meeting for the third season in a row in Europes top club competition on Wednesday. Chelsea dominated the first 45 minutes but Liverpool came back into the match in the second half. 

Im very happy with the players. Its a positive result. Its a victory so that when the game starts in Anfield, Chelsea will be ahead 1-0, Mourinho said. 

I am frustrated... For what we did in the first half we did more than enough to score two, three or four goals, he said. 

For sure (Rafael) Benitez and his people will think its a result that will give them the chance to be in the final but me and my people think its also a result for us to be there. 

Mourinho and Benitez agreed the Anfield crowd would make a difference but the Liverpool manager would not be drawn on which side had the advantage. 

We play in Anfield with our supporters behind us but at the same time they are a very good in counter-attack and we must be aware of this, the cautious Spaniard said. 

Mourinho, whose side lost at the same stage of the competition to a lone goal at Anfield two years ago, said Liverpool with five European Cups had an historical advantage of success in Europe over many decades. 

They play at home and they are a strong side at home, he said. 

Cole, however, was basking in hitting the winner. He waited seven months for his first European goal and it could be one of the most crucial ones for Chelsea this season. 

Well see the importance of the goal next week its only halftime, Cole said. Liverpool played well in the second half and there was a bit of fatigue creeping in. Its one of those games where we had to dig in. (Agencies)

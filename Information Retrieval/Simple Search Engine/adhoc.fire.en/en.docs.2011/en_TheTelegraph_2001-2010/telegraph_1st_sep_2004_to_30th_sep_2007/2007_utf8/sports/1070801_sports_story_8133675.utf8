Nottingham: India withstood the loss of three batsmen on Tuesday to beat England by seven wickets in the second of three Tests. 

Chris Tremlett dismissed Dinesh Karthik, Wasim Jaffer and Sachin Tendulkar, but England did not have enough runs to protect and India eased to 73 for three at Trent Bridge to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. 

Rahul Dravid ended unbeaten on 11 and Sourav Ganguly on 2 as India scored the 63 runs they needed from the day in just over 21 overs. 

India will head into the final Test at The Oval, which starts August 9, needing only to avoid defeat to become the first team to win a Test series in England since Australia in 2001. 

The only time India triumphed in England was in 1986 when Kapil Devs team had won by a 2-0 margin. 

England must win at The Oval to stretch their unbeaten streak at home to 12 series. 

It was a remarkable turnaround by Dravids men after being thoroughly outplayed in the first Test at the Lords where the weather gods saved them from a certain defeat. 

But the hosts had no such luck as the sun broke out in all its splendour in the morning to provide the perfect setting for the Indian batsmen to launch the run chase. 

Karthik (22) and Jaffer (22) blunted a spirited bowling by England, and although Tendulkar (1) fell cheaply, Indias victory was never in doubt. 

The golden moment came at exactly 12.35pm (5.05pm IST) when Tremletts intended attempt to york Sourav in the 25th over of the innings resulted in four byes that helped India reach the target. 

Sourav raised his hands with a great sense of deja vu as Dravid ran down the pitch to embrace his colleague. 

The last time India won a Test on English soil was at the Leeds in 2002 when they had defeated the hosts by an innings and 46 runs, riding on centuries from Dravid, Tendulkar and Sourav. 

Chasing just 73 runs for victory was more of a joy ride for the Indians who started the final day at 10 without loss with both openers looking relaxed and confident. 

Karthik underlined his liking for what was to be a great day for Indian cricket when he glided James Anderson past point for a boundary in over No. 2 of the day. 

Jaffer too showed his sense of occasion and joined the party, delicately turning Ryan Sidebottom past square leg to pick up his first boundary in the next over. 

Karthik then cut Anderson for another boundary while Jaffer pulled and glanced Sidebottom for two consecutive fours in the following over. 

The introduction of Tremlett pegged India back a bit as the tall pacer picked up three wickets for three runs in a space of 27 deliveries. 

The Indian openers put on 47 runs in 60 minutes before Jaffer top-edged an intended pull against Tremlett and was easily caught at point by Kevin Pietersen. Jaffers 22 came off 45 balls with three fours. 

Dravid got off the mark with a glorious on-drive off Sidebottom that also brought up the 50 of the innings in 15.5 overs. 

Tremlett then picked up his second wicket when he had Karthik caught to a short rising delivery that took the outside edge of the bat. Karthik made 22 off 56 balls with three fours. 

Dravid then collected a streaky four against Anderson when he top-edged the bowler just over the wicketkeeper and first slip. 

Tendulkar scratched around for 14 balls even as the English bowlers tested him with short-pitched deliveries. But with another 11 runs needed for victory, he succumbed to the 15th ball he faced, playing a short one from Tremlett straight to Alastair Cook at forward short leg. 

Then came Tremletts intended yorker that beat the wicketkeeper and travelled to the boundary to give India a memorable victory.

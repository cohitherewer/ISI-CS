The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mehtab likely to sit out

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES

New Delhi: India are desperate to salvage some pride from their home match against North Korea in Chennai on Wednesday. The occasion is for qualification of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but for Indias stand-in coach Collin Toal, its all about getting some confidence back from a campaign, which looks bordering on another disaster. 

India have failed to score so far in the qualifiers, having gone down 0-3 to Iraq and 0-1 to Thailand. Though India have still chances of making the cut, the task against North Korea, the bronze-medal winners in the Doha Asian Games, is absolutely cut out. 

Incidentally, Mohun Bagan medio Mehtab Hussain has been flown in for the match but hes unlikely to take the field. Because Toal believes the players energy level is quite low after having played in too many matches in recent past. 

According to team management sources, Mohammedan Sporting defender Habibur Rahman Mondal has recovered from his knee injury, he is also set to sit out as Toal is not keen on taking a risk with him. 

Its however confirmed that Sushil Singh will miss the tie due to his injury. 

Toal, though, is putting up a brave face. 

We are improving match by match. The boys are confident and aware of the importance of tomorrows clash. It all depends on how focused we remain during the match, Toal said from Chennai. 

An eternal optimist as he is, the British coach refused to buy the suggestion that India are fighting a losing battle. 

We can still qualify (for the Olympics) Anything can happen, he added. 

The reality, however, points to another round of disappointment. If the strikers inability to find the target is a cause of worry, lack of cohesion between defence and midfield cost us dear in the earlier matches. 

Meanwhile, the North Korean coach Ko Chol-ho said they were looking for nothing but a win tomorrow. 

Ko was quoted by an agency as saying: We are keen to get in to play in Beijing. We were in the winning position at 2-1 against Iraq in the last match but the Iraqis came up with the equaliser just 30 seconds before the final whistle. We have come to win against India.

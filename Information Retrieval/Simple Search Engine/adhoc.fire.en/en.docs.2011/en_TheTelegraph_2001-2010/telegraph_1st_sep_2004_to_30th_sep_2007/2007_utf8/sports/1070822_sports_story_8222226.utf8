Karachi: New Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson said his enthusiasm has not been dampened by the fact that some senior players have joined the Indian Cricket League (ICL). 

Lawson said he felt happy for players such as Inzamam-ul Haq, Mohammed Yousuf, Abdul Razzaq and Imran Farhat who have aligned with the ICL. 

I am happy with the spirit I see in these players. My spirits are also not dampened because of the loss of some of the seniors, the Australian said after taking charge in Lahore on Tuesday. 

The former Australia fast bowler said he was excited by the challenge of coaching Pakistan. 

It is a challenge coaching such talented players. My top priority is to turn their unpredictability into an advantage and use their talent and skills to gel them into a more consistent outfit, he said. 

Lawson said he was confident that given the potential, Pakistan can become the best team in the world. 

The coach has signed a two-year contract with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), who have also appointed a former Australian rugby trainer to raise the fitness levels of the players. 

He said Pakistan had always been an unpredictable side, a trait that worked both ways. Lawson brushed aside queries about security concerns. 

I am not worried about the security. I am sure the PCB will take good care of that. 

Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik, meanwhile, has insisted his team has not been affected by the recent turmoil back home as his boys prepare for next months ICC World Twenty20 here. 

Malik said: It is difficult at the moment I am just focusing on the team. 

We have had three training camps in Pakistan and they have been very nice, Malik said during a conference call from Lahore on Tuesday.

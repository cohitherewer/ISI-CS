Monza: Double world champion Fernando Alonso took pole position alongside teammate Lewis Hamilton on Saturday in an all-McLaren front row for the Italian Grand Prix. Brazilian Felipe Massa gave Ferrari fans some cheer with third place for the teams home Grand Prix. 

Germanys Nick Heidfeld completed the second row for BMW Sauber. Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen qualified fifth. 

Hamilton leads Spaniard Alonso by five points in the overall standings with 1five races, including Sunday, remaining. Massa is 15 points off Hamilton with Finlands Raikkonen one further back. 

Raikkonen, meanwhile, escaped injury when he crashed at high speed in Saturdays final practice. 

The Finn walked away after his car suddenly veered off the track before turn eight, one of the quickest points on the fastest circuit on the calendar where cars reach speeds of around 330kph. 

It smashed at an angle into a concrete wall, narrowly missing two flag marshals as it skimmed uncontrollably past them before plunging into the tyre barriers. Television images showed Raikkonen vainly trying to steer the unresponsive car away from the wall before the impact. 

He left the car unaided and clambered over the barrier to safety before returning to the Ferrari garage after a visit to the medical centre. A Ferrari spokesman said they were still investigating the cause of the accident. (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Greg Chappell appears keen to continue, but...

 - Team India coachs job after World Cup 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Visakhapatnam: Greg Chappell, it appears, is keen to continue as the Team India coach but may not wait for the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to begin negotiations after the World Cup, by when his contract would have ended. 

I understand Greg doesnt have reservations about staying on, though hes concerned about the amount of cricket being played... However, he cant keep waiting for the BCCI to initiate a dialogue, somebody close to Chappell told The Telegraph on Saturday. 

Chappell came on board in May 2005, succeeding John Wright, and if the BCCI has somebody else in mind then the ODI here against Sri Lanka won handsomely by Rahul Dravid amp; Co. is going to be remembered as his last as coach on Indian soil. 

Surprisingly, till now, the BCCI hasnt given thought to who will be the coach after the World Cup. In fact, the first series after that mega event (in Bangladesh) is just a few days after the April 28 final in Bridgetown. 

Lets see how things go in the World Cup, is what a top BCCI official had to say. Thats strange, to say the least, and suggests that the bodys priorities are definitely misplaced. 

For the record, Chappell has himself not said anything beyond I cant say (about the future)... I know as much as you probably do... Right now, Im thinking about the World Cup. 

Soon, though, Chappell must begin exploring options.

Manchester: Spinner Monty Panesar took his first 10-wicket Test haul as England wrapped up the series against the West Indies with a 60-run victory in the third match at Old Trafford on Monday. 

Panesar took six for 137 as the West Indies were bowled out for 394 shortly after lunch on the final day, ending the tourists hopes of a record run chase. 

Shivnarine Chanderpaul (116 not out) scored his first Test hundred for two years but his team fell short of their 455 target. The record chase stays at 418 by the West Indies in 2003. 

Panesar exploited a wearing pitch that offered him considerable bounce and turn while fast bowler Steve Harmison took four for 95 in the innings and showed a more disciplined line than in recent matches. 

England have an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the four-match series and the win meant Michael Vaughan became the countrys most successful Test captain, surpassing Peter Mays 20 victories. 

Every session they pushed us, England captain Michael Vaughan said. But to grow as a team you have to come through tough days, tough sessions. 

Shiv showed truly what a world-class player he is, the West Indies captain Daren Ganga said. 

He led from the front, and he led in the first innings too. Hes going from strength to strength. He will inspire a lot of us to do better in the next match. 

Vaughan also praised Chanderpaul, describing his batting on a rough, turning pitch as one of the best innings Ive seen in Test match cricket. 

The West Indies resumed on 301 for five but Panesar settled Englands nerves early by having Denesh Ramdin (34) caught by Paul Collingwood at slip to the 15th delivery of the morning. 

Ramdin had added 62 with Chanderpaul to build the West Indies hopes of the record chase. 

Darren Sammys stand of 37 with Chanderpaul that spanned 14 overs was halted when Panesar took a sharp return catch. The bowler, often ridiculed for his clumsy fielding, seemed stunned that he had held the ball. 

Jerome Taylor (11) was dropped on one by Collingwood off Panesar but his obdurate 56-minute innings ended just after lunch when he fended a short Harmison ball to short-leg. That was Harmisons 200th Test victim in his 53rd match. 

Fidel Edwards departed three balls later when he edged Harmison to Ian Bell in the gully. Corey Collymore was the last man, caught at short-leg by Bell off Panesar. 

England, who scored 370 and 313, bowled the West Indies out for 229 in their first innings. 

Chanderpauls century was his teams only hundred of the series. He batted for over six hours. The West Indies Sammy enjoyed a successful debut, claiming seven wickets for 66 in Englands second innings on Saturday. 

The first Test at Lords was drawn and the West Indies suffered their heaviest Test defeat of an innings and 283 runs in the second at Headingley. The fourth and final match is at Durham starting on Friday. 

The match featured 167 extras, the second highest in Test cricket. The highest ever was 173 in the first Test draw between the West Indies and Pakistan in Barbados in February 1977.

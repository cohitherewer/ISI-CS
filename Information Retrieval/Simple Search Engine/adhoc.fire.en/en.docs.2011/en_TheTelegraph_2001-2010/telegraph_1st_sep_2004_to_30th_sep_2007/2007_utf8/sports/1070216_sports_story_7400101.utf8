London: Arsenal won 3-1 after extra time at Bolton Wanderers on Wednesday to reach the FA Cup fifth round, with the cool head of Swede Fredrik Ljungberg finally laying the ghost of their bogey team after three glaring misses. 

Two goals by Togo striker Emmanuel Adebayor and one by substitute Ljungberg in the fourth-round replay earned Arsenal a home tie with Blackburn Rovers on Saturday. 

The Londoners, who had lost four of their five previous matches at Bolton, went in front in the 13th minute. 

Tomas Rosickys pass to Julio Baptista on the left was blocked but Adebayor, having helped in the build-up, hit the loose ball into the roof of the net thanks to a slight deflection. 

Bolton, who managed to stop the visitors adding to their tally in a first half dominated by Arsenal, snatched a 90th-minute equaliser through defender Abdoulaye Meite to take the game into extra time. 

Ljungberg, a veteran of three FA Cup final victories with Arsenal, struck the all-important second goal early in the second period of extra time, placing a low shot inside the far post after a good run by fellow substitute Jeremie Aliadiere. 

Adebayor, who should have wrapped up the tie in normal time, finally put away his second in the closing seconds when he and Baptista broke away and the Brazilian set him up. 

The goal Freddie scored was top drawer, there wasnt much we could do after that, Bolton manager Sam Allardyce said. 

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said: Bolton are a good side and we have shown that we are a great side. 

His team squandered two big chances to wrap it up in normal time.

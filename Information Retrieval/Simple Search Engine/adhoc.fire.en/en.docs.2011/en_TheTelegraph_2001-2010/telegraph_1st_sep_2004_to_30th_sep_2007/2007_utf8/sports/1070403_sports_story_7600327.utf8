St Johns: St John rsquo;s: New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming stroked his eighth ODI century to guide his team to a nine-wicket victory over Bangladesh in their World Cup Super Eight match on Monday.

Fleming hit 10 fours and three sixes to remain 102 not out, easing the Black Caps to 178 for one in the 30th over after their bowlers had restricted Bangladesh to 174 all out on a good batting pitch.

Hamish Marshall, who was 50 not out, was associated in an unbeaten 134-run second-wicket stand with Fleming.

The Black Caps, with six points, are on the verge of a semi-final spot.

Earlier, Scott Styris and Jacob Oram took seven wickets between them as Bangladesh managed 174 in 48.3 overs. Asked to bat, Tamim Iqbal (29) and Javed Omar (22) gave a sedate start to Bangladesh but the minnows lost wickets at regular intervals and it was tailender Mohammed Rafique rsquo;s 36-ball 30 which pushed the score. Styris claimed four for 43 in his 10 overs, while Oram rsquo;s figure read 9.3-0-30-3. Shane Bond grabbed two wickets in the first over of his second spell. 

NZ in racism row

St John rsquo;s: New Zealand on Monday faced accusations that their players racially abused catering staff before last week rsquo;s match against the West Indies. According to a report in a local newspaper on Monday, some New Zealand players were alleged to have said ldquo;good morning niggers rdquo; to catering staff shortly before the start of the match. The report also claimed that the ICC had begun an investigation. However, New Zealand general manager Lindsay Crocker said the report had been ldquo;grossly exaggerated rdquo;. (AFP)

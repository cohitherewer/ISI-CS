 Johnson is master as Woods falls short

Augusta: The wind had finally eased at Augusta National Golf Club, and Zach Johnson, a son of a chiropractor from Iowa, stood behind the 18th green not exactly sure what to do. 

Tiger Woods, the last golfer with a chance to catch him, was still playing in the gloaming of the 71st Masters, so Johnson leaned in to hug his wife, Kim, and planted a kiss on the cheek of his 14-week-old son, Will, refusing to let go for several seconds. 

I was an emotional wreck, Johnson said. I was a slob. I knew there were still chances for guys to make birdies. 

When Woods stalled with three closing pars, though, Johnson claimed the Masters title after one of the most difficult weeks in the history of the tournament. 

[Jeev Milkha Singhs hopes of a high finish in his debut Masters vanished as the script went horribly wrong in the last round and the Indian slipped from tied 16th overnight to end up tied 37th, adds PTI. 

[A quadruple bogey on the par-four first hole took his focus away and not even four birdies could save Jeev as he ended with a seven-over 79 for an aggregate of 14-over-par 302. Jeev, crushed by the calamitous beginning, added two double bogeys and three bogeys to his card that negated the four birdies.] 

Johnson, 31, fired a closing three-under-par 69 on Sunday to defeat Woods (72), Rory Sabbatini (69) and Retief Goosen (69) by two strokes for his first major championship and second Tour victory. 

His one-over-par 289 tied the highest winning score in Masters history. Sam Snead, in 1954, and Jack Burke, Jr., in 1956, also claimed green jackets with a 289. 

Johnsons victory came on a fast, dry golf course that stretched 7,445 yards. It came over four days of challenging conditions: warm and windy weather to start the tournament; a chilly, gusty Saturday; and a pressure-filled Sunday with swirling breezes. 

It came six months after Johnson was one of four rookies on the US Ryder Cup team and four years after he graduated from the Nationwide Tour. 

I think Im mentally tough, said Johnson, who entered the tournament ranked 56th in the world. I dont hit it very far, I dont overpower a golf course, but I think Im a pretty decent putter. At Augusta National, putting is premium. 

Johnson birdied three of the last six holes, off-setting a bogey on No. 17, to win the Masters in just his third appearance. He missed the cut in 2005 and finished tied for 32nd last year. On a day when six golfers led or tied for the lead, he outlasted the games biggest names, including a late charge from Woods. 

Woods, who briefly held the lead by a stroke after making par on No. 4, stood four shots back as he played the par-5 13th hole. He curled a three-wood shot around the trees and was left with just over 190 yards to the flag. 

Last year, Woods blamed putting woes as he failed to catch the winner, Phil Mickelson. This year, he put the onus on two closing bogeys on Thursday and Saturday. I had a chance, he said. The last two holes, you just cant afford to do that and win major championships.

 Rampant Espanyol shock Barcelona 3-1 

 - European Round-Up

 Inter set Serie A record with 12th straight victory 

Madrid: Barcelona wasted a chance to go top of the Primera Liga by slumping to a 1-3 defeat at city rivals Espanyol on Saturday. Luis Garcia put Espanyol ahead in the 31st minute and, although substitute Javier Saviola levelled early in the second half, Barcelona were always on the rack. 

Raul Tamudo headed the home side back in front after 65 minutes and Francisco Rufete made it three near the end after his teammates had missed a host of opportunities to add to the score. It is a wake-up call for us, coach Frank Rijkaard told reporters after Barcelona extended their sequence to three league matches without a win. 

Rijkaards team remains second on 35 points, two adrift of leaders Sevilla. 

Earlier, in-form Valencia climbed to third on 33 points with a 3-0 win over local rivals Levante. Portuguese midfielder Hugo Viana put Valencia on course for their fifth successive victory with a low shot from outside the area in the 52nd minute. 

Four minutes later striker Fernando Morientes swept home David Silvas miscued cross-shot at the far post and 10 minutes from time Argentine defender Roberto Ayala headed the third from a free-kick. 

Barcelona had the first clear chance when Ronaldinhos dipping free-kick was tipped on to the crossbar by Carlos Kameni. But the home sides rapid counter-attacks constantly unsettled Barcelona. After 29 minutes playmaker Ivan de la Penas defence-splitting pass set Rufete through on goal and he forced Victor Valdes into a finger-tip save. 

Valdes could not stop Luis Garcia a minute later after Tamudo beat Carles Puyol on the left and crossed for the striker to sweep the ball home. 

Rijkaard brought Argentine Saviola on at halftime and within 15 minutes he equalised with a jinking run and fierce shot from outside the area. 

Espanyol restored their lead when Sergio Garcia crossed from the right for the unmarked Tamudo to stoop and head home from close range. The hosts then brought on substitute Walter Pandiani, the Uruguayan striker shooting wide in a one-on-one situation and heading against the bar as Barcelona were run ragged. 

In the final minute Luis Garcia led a three-on-one breakaway before crossing for Rufete to score at the far post. 

Meanwhile, Inter Milan set a Serie A record on Saturday with their 3-1 victory at Torino securing a 12th straight win. 

AS Roma set the record for successive victories after a run of 11 wins last season but Roberto Mancinis Inter side continued their impressive form with a triumph in Turin that leaves them 10 points clear at the top of the table. 

Inter took the lead through Adriano who headed home a cross from compatriot Maicon in the 24th minute. 

Twice before the break the visitors went close to a second. 

First, French midfielder Patrick Vieira forced an excellent save from Christian Abbiati following a smart backheel from Zlatan Ibrahimovic. 

Then Inters Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic produced another moment of skill to set up Adriano but this time the Brazilian failed to make the most of his opportunity.

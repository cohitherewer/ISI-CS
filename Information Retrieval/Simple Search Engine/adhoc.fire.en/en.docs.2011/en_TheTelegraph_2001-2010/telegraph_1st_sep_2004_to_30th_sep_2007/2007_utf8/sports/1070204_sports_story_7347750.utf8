Mumbai: Zaheer Khans five-wicket haul on debut for Mumbai was enough for the hosts to take command of the Ranji Trophy Super League final against Bengal at the end of Day II at the Wankhede on Saturday. 

The morning session went as per plans for Bengal with Ranadeb striking twice again to take his innings haul to four as Mumbai were bundled out for 320. But, in reply, Bengal batsmen looked uncomfortable with Sourav Ganguly getting a golden duck off Zaheer. 

This was not the first time the left-arm Indian pacer claimed Souravs wicket for a duck. The Bengal southpaw got two zeroes in both the innings of the 2005-06 Duleep Trophy final against West Zone in Ahmedabad one of them being a first-ball duck. Bengal were eventually skittled out for 143, conceding a lead of 177 runs. 

At close, Mumbai were 113 for two, thanks to half-centuries from Rohit Sharma and Wasim Jaffer. 

Bengal batsmen, barring the prolific Manoj Tewari, showed lack of application against some quality attack spearheaded by Zaheer Khan. In the initial overs, both Zaheer and Agarkar were quick and on target. It seemed the decision to include Sourav in place of Subhamoy Das weakened the batting and may cost Bengal the match. 

Opening after a long time, captain Deep Dasgupta looked in complete disarray from the very first ball, though he faced only three balls before returning to pavilion without troubling the scorer. 

Deep, fending a short-pitched delivery from Agarkar, spooned the ball up and the young Sharma didnt make any mistake taking a comfortable catch at the forward short-leg position. 

Avishek Jhunjhunwala was Zaheers first victim when the young Bengal batsman was completely deceived by the left-armers swing and edged one to wicketkeeper Vinayak Samant. He made two with the team total reading three for two. 

The other opener Arindam Das, who found his form in the semi-final against Karnataka, failed to impress after he departed with the scorecard reading 28 for three. Fishing outside the off-stump, Das was again caught by Samant for seven. 

Only Tewari, who crossed the 700-run mark on Saturday, looked in sublime touch as he dispatched Zaheer to the boundary on eight occasions en route his 42 off 43 balls. 

Sourav, coming in at the No. 5, only took time to walk in and take guard against Zaheer before his middle stump was uprooted following an inside edge. Zaheer, incidentally, was on a hatttrick after he dismissed Das and Sourav. 

After Souravs departure, it was former Bengal captain Rohan Gavaskars turn to face the Zaheer music. But he faced it rather well than his teammates. 

Having begun confidently, Rohan played a brief but steady innings. When Rohan was looking set, he edged one to the keeper at his individual contribution of 21 and left Bengal tottering at 72 for five. That was not the need of the hour for Bengal, as they needed someone who could lend support to Tewari to regain the lost grou-nd. 

But the wickets continued to fall like nine pins. Seemed to be in a hurry, Laxmi Ratan Shukla went without opening his account, while Tewari too followed suit with little support at the other end. 

The tailenders, Sourav Sarkar and Sourashish Lahiri, tried their best but that was not enough for the tourists. Sarkar made 25 while Lahiri contributed 22. 

Mumbai, in their second essay, also faced some problem losing Sahil Kukreja for five. The opener was caught by Deep off Ranadeb, but Sharma and Jaffer steadied the innings. 

Bengal now are 290 runs behind Mumbai with eight wickets still to go.

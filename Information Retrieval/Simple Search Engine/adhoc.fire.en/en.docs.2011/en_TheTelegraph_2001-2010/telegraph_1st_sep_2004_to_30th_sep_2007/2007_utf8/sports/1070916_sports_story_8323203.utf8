The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Have Sachin or Sourav for now, says Pataudi

 - The iconic former India captain on the way forward 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL

Calcutta: Till Zimbabwes Tatenda Taibu got the Test captaincy in the summer of 2004, Mansur Ali Khan Tiger Pataudi had been the youngest to lead a national team. That record has gone, but what will never be erased is the quality of his leadership. Pataudi may not have been Indias most successful captain, but is widely regarded as the greatest weve had. 

Now 66, Pataudi spoke to The Telegraph from his New Delhi residence on Saturday afternoon. 

The following are excerpts 

On Rahul Dravids decision 

Came as a bit of a surprise not a shock, for Id been hearing he was disinclined to continue Obviously, after the World Cup, there must have been some understanding between Dravid and the Board 

On whether Dravid talked about the captaincy when they met during the launch of the Indian Premier League and the Champions League in New Delhi on Thursday 

He didnt. 

On Dravid succumbing to pressure 

Bottomline is that youve got to handle it Pressure is always going to be there and the captains personality becomes a factor. 

On whether the pressure faced by Indian captains is unique 

Not on the field, but certainly off it, most of which is unwarranted I mean, if the team doesnt do well in a big tournament or series, then the families get threatened and mobs attack the players houses Im sure Dravid didnt like that. Any principled man wouldnt Dravid is being pilloried for deserting the ship thats Team India, but the ship isnt sinking The good thing is that the next two series are at home (ODIs against Australia, ODIs and Tests versus Pakistan). He hasnt, at least, left on the eve of an overseas tour. 

On Dravid as a person 

His temperament is very different from, say, a Sourav Ganguly Sourav is flamboyant, outgoing Dravid, on the other hand, is an introvert and keeps things to himself 

On Dravid as captain 

Its a question of personality and while a Sourav would be enthusiastic and show his emotions a display Indians like Dravid went about his job quietly He wasnt just a competent captain, but a successful one too. 

On Dravid being too defensive 

(Laughs) Im sure you want me to comment on Dravid not enforcing the follow-on (at the Brit Oval) last month Yes, that was one instance when he played it very safe without good reason Putting England under pressure by enforcing the follow-on was the only way we could have won that Test (and the series 2-0) I would have done that Simply making England follow-on at home and in conditions which suited them would have given me much pleasure Dravid did make a few mistakes on that tour. 

On the way forward for the Board 

Purely as a holding operation, the selectors should appoint Sachin (Tendulkar) or Sourav and, then, give the job to (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni I know Dhonis captaining in the Twenty20, but the format is such that a captains strategy-skills wont really be tested Id be more interested in knowing how Dhoni handled the dressing room I know Dhoni was vice-captain during the ODIs in England, but will need time to prepare himself mentally. I remember I got the captaincy out of the blue (in the West Indies, 1962) Id not been mentally prepared, for it was assumed Nari Contractor would remain captain for the next two-three years Nobody could have anticipated he would get injured and that I would be elevated in rather sad circumstances Id just played three Tests before I got the captaincy Today, the situation isnt all that different as nobody expected Dravid not to continue Dhoni, to my mind, needs at least one series to prepare... So, have Sachin or Sourav for now and Dhoni in the near future Im for one captain in both Tests and ODIs. 

On whether he would go for Sachin or Sourav 

Its a difficult one Sachins personality is such that he wont impose himself on Dhoni, whereas Sourav could 

On the buzz that the powers-that-be have already approached Sachin 

He must be willing to captain for a brief period. If theres any hesitation, Souravs at hand. 

On Sachins two innings as captain 

What I remember is that he was unceremoniously removed the first time and couldnt organise his batting the second time That did surprise me, but he was a fine captain. 

On Souravs five-plus years as captain 

He did well and his record shows that His is a different personality and his flamboyance was well received by teammates and the public. His passion wasnt hidden. 

Finally, his message for Dravids successor 

Good luck! A captain needs luck Had the weather not intervened at Lords (in the first Test of the recent series), then we would have lost and may not have won the series.

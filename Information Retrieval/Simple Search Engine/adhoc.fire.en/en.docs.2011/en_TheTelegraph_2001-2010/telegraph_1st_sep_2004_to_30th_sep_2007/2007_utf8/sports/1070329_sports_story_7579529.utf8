 International hotline set up, open round the clock 

Kingston: Jamaica police have set up an international hotline and appealed to potential witnesses to come forward with any information they have on Pakistan coach Bob Woolmers murder. 

Deputy commissioner of police Mark Shields said the investigators were working on identifying all those who stayed in Jamaica Pegasus on the day Woolmer was murdered and two days prior to that and reach them for clues. 

What I need to do is to identify everybody in the hotel from Friday through to Sunday when Bobs body was found, in an effort to establish everybodys movements during that period of time, Shields said. 

The important thing is that we get to those people and give them an opportunity to come forward and talk to us. Nothing can be overlooked in a case like this. 

Shields said the witnesses could either call the international hotline (+1-876-927-5000) or contact their local police. 

You can call the number 24/7 to give information. If you dont want to call internationally, call your local police if youre now back at home in your own country, he said. 

Meanwhile, publishers of Woolmers autobiography in Cape Town say the book does not contain any explosive revelations about match fixing. 

There are no explosive revelations in the book which Bob had co-authored with Professor Tim Noakes and Helen Moffet, the publishing company managing director said. 

No proofs of the book have gone missing, nor does the book contain any explosive revelations about cricket and match fixing. The book is the expression of Bobs philosophy of playing and coaching cricket, and is the product of a lifetimes involvement with the game. 

Meanwhile, the prosecutor in the King Commission of inquiry into the match fixing case involving Hansie Cronje in 2000, advocate Shamilla Batoyi, said she did not call Woolmer to give evidence because he had no knowledge of match fixing prior to the inquiry. 

I didnt call him because he did not have anything relevant to say, said the lawyer of Indian origin.

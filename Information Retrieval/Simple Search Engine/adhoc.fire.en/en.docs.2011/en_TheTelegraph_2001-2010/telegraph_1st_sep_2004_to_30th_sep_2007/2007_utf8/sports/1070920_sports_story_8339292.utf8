London: Holders AC Milan took the first step on the long road to Moscow when they opened their Champions League campaign with a 2-1 victory over Benfica on Tuesday. 

The opening batch of fixtures in the 2007-08 competition, which finishes in the Russian capital on May 21, proved a milestone for two of Europes most prolific strikers. 

At San Siro, Milans serial goal poacher Filippo Inzaghi took his tally in European club football to 60 with his sides second goal after Andrea Pirlo opened the scoring in group D. 

Inzaghis former Milan teammate Andriy Shevchenko also hit the 60-mark when he scored Chelseas equaliser in a frustrating 1-1 home draw with Rosenborg Trondheim in group B. 

Only German great Gerd Muller (62) stands above them in the European scoring charts. 

Raul moved to just one goal behind Inzaghi and Shevchenko after heading in Real Madrids first in a 2-1 group C victory at home to Werder Bremen. 

Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy struck 16 minutes from time to mark the clubs 300th game in Europes elite competition with a victory. 

Liverpool, beaten by Milan in last seasons final, began with a 1-1 draw in Porto despite playing most of the second half with 10 men after winger Jermaine Pennant was sent off. 

The other match in group A ended in a 2-0 home victory for Olympique Marseille against Besiktas. 

Carlo Ancelottis Milan side, bidding for an eighth European Cup crown, clicked smoothly through the gears against Benfica and had the game won after 23 minutes thanks to Pirlos free-kick and a trademark finish from Inzaghi. 

Inzaghi, however, did not get a mention from Ancelotti after the game despite taking his tally in the competition to 43. 

Pirlo scored a goal, had an assist and played the ball around well. He is an irreplaceable player. Kaka and Pirlo are a good double act, Ancelotti said. 

Shevchenkos 53rd-minute header spared Chelseas the blushes against Norwegians Rosenborg in a game watched by only 25,000 fans at Stamford Bridge. 

The visitors took a shock lead in group B through Miika Koppinens flick in the 24th minute and Jose Mourinhos side wasted chance after chance to equalise. 

Shevchenko, yet to impress since moving from Milan, eventually found the net but Rosenborg held on for a point despite one-way Blues traffic. 

The story of the match is... we couldnt score two goals in 20 chances and we could not defend a set piece, a grim-looking Mourinho said. 

Liverpool, the 2005 champions, suffered a torrid start in the Dragao Stadium against 2004 winners Porto, going behind to a Lucho Gonzalez penalty after eight minutes. 

Dutchman Dirk Kuyt, who scored in the 1-2 defeat by Milan in last Mays final, headed in the equaliser after 17 minutes and Liverpool will return home satisfied with a point after Pennant was sent off in the 57th minute for a second booking.

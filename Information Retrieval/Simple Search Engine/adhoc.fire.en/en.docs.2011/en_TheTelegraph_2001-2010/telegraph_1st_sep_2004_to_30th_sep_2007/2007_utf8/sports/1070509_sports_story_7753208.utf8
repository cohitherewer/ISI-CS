 Sania up to No. 49

Indias Sania Mirza moved one place up to No. 49 in the latest WTA rankings. She has 503 points. 

Sania will return to action at the WTA Tour event in Morocco, beginning May 14, after being out for two months due to a knee injury. She underwent surgery in March after suffering a ligament injury in her right knee at the Qatar Open. She is also expected to play in the Istanbul Cup which begins on May 21 in the run-up to the French Open at the end of the month. 

In doubles, however, Sania fell one place to No. 42. 

Leander Paes remained at No. 7 in the mens doubles with 3790 points, while Mahesh Bhupathi rose four places to No. 25. Paes and Czech partner Martin Damm are No. 2 in the doubles Champions Race.

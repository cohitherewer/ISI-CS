 AIFF releases Mehtab

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The AIFF was again caught napping and forced to send 19 players (and not 20) to Jordan for the pre-Olympic qualifier against Iraq. 

According to AIFF sources, midfielder Mehtab Hussain was taken off the Indian squad at the last moment after Mohun Bagan pointed out that four of their players had been selected. 

Last week, the AIFF had given a written assurance that no NFL club will have to release more than three players for the national squad.

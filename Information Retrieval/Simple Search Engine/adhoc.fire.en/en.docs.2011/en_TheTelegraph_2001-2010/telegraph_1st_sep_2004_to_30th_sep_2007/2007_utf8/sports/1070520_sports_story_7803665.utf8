 Pawar meets Big Five

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president, Sharad Pawar, had a 25-minute closed-door meeting with five Team India seniors in Chittagong late on Saturday evening. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, Pawar met captain Rahul Dravid, vice-captain Sachin Tendulkar, former captain Sourav Ganguly, senior pro Anil Kumble and former vice-captain V.V.S. Laxman. 

Details were not available till late at night, but the stalemate over the players contracts could well have figured during their interaction. 

Significantly, Pawar didnt ask his colleagues vice-president Rajeev Shukla, secretary Niranjan Shah, and chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty to join him during his meeting with the Big Five.

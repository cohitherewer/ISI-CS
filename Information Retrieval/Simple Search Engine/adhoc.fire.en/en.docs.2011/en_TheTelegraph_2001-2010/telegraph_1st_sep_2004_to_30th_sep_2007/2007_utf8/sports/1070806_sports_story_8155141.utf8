 Messi boots 

 fetch 4,000 euros 

 EUROPEAN CLUB UPDATE

 Madrid: 

 A signed pair of Lionel Messis boots have been 

 sold for 4,000 euros ($5,514) at an auction in Beijing on 

 Barcelonas tour of Asia, Spanish media reported on 

 Sunday. They were the boots the Argentina forward wore when 

 he scored a goal for Barcelona similar to Diego Maradonas 

 famous solo effort against England in the 1986 World Cup, 

 in the Kings Cup semi-final first leg against Getafe 

 in April.

 Other items of memorabilia auctioned 

 included the shirt France striker Thierry Henry wore at 

 his official presentation in June and a cutting of Brazil 

 forward Ronaldinhos hair. Around 1.5 million euros 

 were raised for disabled children in China. 

 Leverkusen upset

 Berlin: Second division 

 St Pauli beat Bayer Leverkusen 1-0 to provide the first 

 shock of the German Cup on Saturday. Energie Cottbus became 

 the second Bundesliga side to fall in the first round, losing 

 5-6 to third division Rot-Weiss Essen on penalties. Bundesliga 

 champions VfB Stuttgart survived a scare, scraping to a 

 2-1 win over SV Wehen Wiesbaden in a match that saw both 

 sides reduced to nine men.

 Werder Bremen avoided embarrassment 

 when a Boubacar Sanogo goal in the 90th minute gave them 

 a 1-0 win over third division side Eintracht Braunschweig. 

 Borussia Dortmund beat FC Magdeburg 4-1, Hanover 96 defeated 

 Rot-Weiss Ahlen 3-1, and Hertha Berlin came safely through 

 3-0 against SpVgg Unterhaching. 

 Marseille start with draw

 Paris: Olympique Marseille 

 managed only a 0-0 draw at promoted Racing Strasbourg in 

 the opening match of the Ligue 1 season on Saturday. Last 

 seasons runners-up are regarded as the only side with 

 a real chance of stopping Olympique Lyon winning a seventh 

 successive title.

 Girondins Bordeaux beat Racing 

 Lens 1-0, while Monaco and St Etienne drew 1-1. Toulouse 

 warmed up for their Champions League third qualifying round 

 tie against Liverpool with a 1-3 defeat at Valenciennes 

 in which striker Johan Audel scored a hattrick for the home 

 side.

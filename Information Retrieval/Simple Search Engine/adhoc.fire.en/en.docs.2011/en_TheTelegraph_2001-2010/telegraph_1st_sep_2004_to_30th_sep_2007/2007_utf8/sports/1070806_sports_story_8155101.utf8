 Lawson to seek Gregs 

 advice

 - Fans in subcontinent tend to be in fifth gear or reverse, 

 says Aussie 

Melbourne: Rating the high-voltage India-Pakistan rivalry as 10 Ashes series wrapped in one, Pakistans new coach Geoff Lawson has said he plans to call up compatriot Greg Chappell to know about the pitfalls of coaching in the sub-continent. 

The former Australia fast bowler said his first major test at the helm of Pakistan would be the tour of India in November-December this year. 

The biggest series of the decade is in India. Australia may be No.1 and to beat them would be fantastic, but to beat India in India, its about 10 Ashes series wrapped in one. Its like another war over there, he was quoted as saying in a local newspaper. 

I think the Indian experience is a little different to Pakistan, but Ive got Greg on my list to call. 

Lawson said that he has no fear of failure and, asked how he would feel to see his effigy being burnt by fans in Pakistan, he replied: Its neither here nor there. Its never been done before, I suppose, theres a first time for everything. 

The fans in the subcontinent tend to be in fifth gear or reverse. Youve got to accept the way they are. 

In the end, were all playing a game. I suppose when you talk about burning effigies, the next step is security. 

Lawson arrives in Pakistan on August 22 but will take the team to Kenya as a warm-up for the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa from September 11. 

 He admitted that he once had an 

 ambition to be Australia coach, but he plans to transform 

 Pakistan into the No.1 Test nation. Coaching Australia 

 I dont think is all that big a challenge, but coaching 

 Pakistan certainly is, Lawson said.

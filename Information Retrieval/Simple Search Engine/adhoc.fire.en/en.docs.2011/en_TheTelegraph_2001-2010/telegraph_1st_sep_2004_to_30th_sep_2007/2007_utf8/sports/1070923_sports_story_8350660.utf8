The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Daniela owes it to grandma 

MADHUMITA GANGULY

 Daniela Hantuchova 

Calcutta: In tennis, there is nothing called luck. If you really deserve something, you will get it in the long run Short-term success may come easy but anything that endures, that is really worth having, comes only by virtue of hard work. 

These words of wisdom come from a mere 24-year-old, but one who has seen a lot of the world Daniela Hantuchova. 

The Slovak, in the city to participate in the Sunfeast Open, lost 6-4, 1-6, 2-6 in the semi-final to Russian Maria Kirilenko on Saturday. 

Hantuchova, ranked No. 11 in the world, draws perhaps more attention for her looks than her game. This despite the fact that she had once moved up to as high as No. 5 in the rankings. 

Twice having topped ACE tennis magazines Hot List of the worlds sexiest players (and being No. 3 on the current one), how does it feel to be in the public eye for reasons more than one? 

It is certainly flattering that people find me attractive, Hantuchova says in response to queries from The Telegraph. However, its not something that I spend a lot of time thinking about. 

I do enjoy fashion. Ive had the chance to be in a Sony Ericsson TV commercial and have done a number of photo shoots for global magazine publications. If I sum up my fashion statement, it would be classic. I enjoy trying out new styles and keeping up with the latest fashions. 

However, continues Hantuchova, All this is for fun, and different from hitting tennis balls. But tennis is, by far, my chief preoccupation. 

Hantuchovas father Igor is a professor in computer science and mother Mariane is an eminent toxicologist. Her elder brother is a qualified architect. But it is grandmother Helena, a former national tennis champion in erstwhile Czechoslovakia, who has been the central figure in Hantuchovas life. 

It was grandma who coached little Hantuchova from the age of six, instilling the principles of intelligence and technique that characterise her play today. 

The most important thing she taught me was to enjoy my tennis. She also insisted that I always try to use all my shots, not just hit forehands and backhands mindlessly. Tennis is a game not just of power but intelligence, says Hantuchova. 

Martina Navratilova had been your doubles partner for a period in 2005. What has been the experience of playing with the legend? 

Replies Hantuchova: I was pleased to have been partnered with her through the WTA Tours monitoring programme. She was very generous with her knowledge of tennis, both on the court and off it. It was a great experience for me. 

Hantuchovas biggest successes have so far come in mixed doubles. At the 2005 US Open she completed a career mixed doubles Grand Slam with Mahesh Bhupathi, becoming only the fifth woman in history to complete a Slam in mixed doubles. 

Mahesh is a great friend. In New York, playing mixed doubles with him was so much fun. He is an incredible doubles player and I learnt so much by playing on the same side of the net as him, said Hantuchova. 

The 24-year-old relaxes by reading and skiing, and hopes to return to academics after her playing days are over. 

She is happy with her progress on the Tour. With age I have learnt to look at tennis in a different way. Today I forgive myself if I make a mistake. I accept it. This is something which comes with age, she concludes on philosophical note.

 Easy win for Collingwood amp; Co.

 MoM Kevin Pietersen celebrates the winning run at Lords on Saturday 

London: The first ball of the day, a nasty wake-up call from James Anderson to Sourav Ganguly, set the tone for what was to follow in the series-deciding seventh ODI at Lords. 

The hosts had made their intentions clear and it was up to the visitors to respond to the challenge. They failed, however, as Rahul Dravid and Co. were badly let down by their batsmen. England were also helped by a couple of dubious umpiring decisions. 

Defending 187, Rudra Pratap Singh raised brief hope of a turnaround, removing openers Matt Prior and Luke Wright in quick succession. But Ian Bell (36) and Man of the Match Kevin Pieteresen (71 not out) prevented the slide, mixing caution with aggression. 

The return of Bell, however, was of little use for Indians as Paul Collingwood joined Pietersen. The pair batted with assurance against an attack that lacked penetration. The 114-run unbroken fourth wicket stand ensured that there were no more hiccups. 

Pietersen was in ominous form, lifting Piyush Chawla for a towering six and punishing him past point in the same over. The England captain was in no mood to play second fiddle either, twice driving Ramesh Powar through the covers and then hoisting RP Singh into the stands. It was exhilarating stuff as England coasted to a seven wicket win. The home team thus bagged the NatWest series 4-3. 

Earlier, Indian batsmen fell short by at least 50 runs. It was only in the later stages that Mahendra Singh Dhoni took the battle to the England bowlers, hitting four fours and one six before being the last man out for 50 off 72 balls. 

Indias start wasnt impressive as the openers failed to break the shackles and the visitors soon found themselves reduced to 53 for three in 15 overs. The advantage of winning the toss was surrendered once Sourav Ganguly left in the seventh over. 

There was one superb shot from Sourav, coming down the pitch to hit Stuart Broad through the covers, but the rest was a dreadful mish-mash of inside and top edges. In between, the former India captain was also hit on the helmet by a James Anderson delivery. He guided Anderson tamely to second slip to depart. 

Sachin looked at ease with the conditions and was never troubled by any of the bowlers. But the departures of Gautam Gambhir and Dravid in the space of five balls put the brakes on scoring. 

The innings really hinged on two controversial dismissals, both off Andrew Flintoff, fired up and back in the fold with the aid of a pain-killing injection. Dravid fell for a three-ball duck once Aleem Dar ruled there was an inside edge to the wicketkeeper as the Team India captain tried to fend off a rising delivery. 

The snickometer showed there was contact even as Dravid shook his head in disbelief. Later the India captain maintained that he didnt feel edging the ball. There was more in store as an over later and for the third time on this tour, Sachin became the victim of an umpiring blunder. In what appeared to be a thrilling duel, Sachin hit Flintoff for three boundaries and looked in great touch. The maestro shaped to drive, missed and amazingly Dar upheld Flintoffs appeal. The ball had missed the bat by a distance. 

A bewildered Sachin stood for a while before slowly heading back. 

Yuvraj Singh vented his anger at the injustice by pulling Broad for a six over square leg. For a while, it seemed Yuvraj and Robin Uthappa would take the challenge to the opposition. But that was not be as the Indians failed to show the temperament to stay at the wicket. 

Indians to complain

 Simmering after the dubious dismissals of Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid, the Team India management has decided to complain. ldquo;We rsquo;ll lodge an official complaint with the ICC, rdquo; administrative manager Rajeev Shukla said.

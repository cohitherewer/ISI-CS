The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ranadeb bowled over by Kumble

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Ranadeb Bose has gained a lot by watching Anil Kumble at close quarters in the just concluded bowlers fitness-specific camp in Mysore. 

Anil Kumble is a legend and it was a great experience to see him bowl and share the camp with him. 

He still puts a lot of hard work behind his bowling. His dedication to the game is a great learning experience for me, Ranadeb said after Sporting Unions five-wicket win at the Eden on Sunday. 

Ranadeb landed in the city around Saturday midnight and within hours he led the Sporting Union pace attack. He also bagged two wickets in the CAB senior knockout final. 

If a player of Kumbles stature can work that hard, why cant we? asked the Bengal mediumpacer. 

The training session at the Infosys campus helped me concentrate more on the game. Now I feel that Im ready for the international stage, he added.

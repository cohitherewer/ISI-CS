 Blatter the only candidate

Zurich: Sepp Blatter is the only candidate for Fifas presidential election to be held next month. 

No other candidate had entered the race by the March 31 deadline, Fifa said on its website, effectively confirming Blatter will stay Fifa president until 2011. 

The governing bodys presidential election is scheduled to take place on May 31 at the Fifa Congress in Zurich. 

Sixtysix member associations from all six confederations nominated the 71-year-old Swiss for a third mandate. 

Blatter, having announced he would stand for a further four-year period of office at the last Congress in June 2006, was pleased with the show of confidence in his presidency. 

I wish to thank all of the associations who have demonstrated their trust in me in this way, he was quoted as saying on the Fifa website. (Reuters)

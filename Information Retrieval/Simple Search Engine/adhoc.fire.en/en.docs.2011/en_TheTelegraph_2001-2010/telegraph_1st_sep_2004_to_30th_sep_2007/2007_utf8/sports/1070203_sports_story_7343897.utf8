The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Good response for Eden match

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The countdown to the Eden one-dayer on February 8 began Friday with the ticket-sale being thrown open to the 121 affiliated units of the Cricket Association of Bengal. According to a CAB official, Day I response was quite satisfying. 

Tickets priced at Rs 150, 550, 750, 900 and 1200 denominations for the India-Sri Lanka ODI will be available for the public from Sunday, if there is any left-over. 

Meanwhile, Mohun Bagan refused to accept their quota of tickets, saying it is meagre. 

In another development, the newly-elected CAB president Prasun Mukherjee roped in two state ministers Subhas Chakraborty and Kshiti Goswami to head the steering and stadium committee, respectively. Mukherjee will chair the organising committee. 

The umpires for the match Simon Taufel of Australia and either Suresh Shastri or Amiesh Saheba will arrive in the city on Tuesday.

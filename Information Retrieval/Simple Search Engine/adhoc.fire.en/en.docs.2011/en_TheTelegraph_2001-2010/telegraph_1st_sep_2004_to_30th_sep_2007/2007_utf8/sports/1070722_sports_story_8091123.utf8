 Sania moves into semis

 Sania Mirza 

Cincinnati: Third seeded Sania Mirza made short work of Olga Govortsova of Belarus to book her first-ever singles semi-final berth at the $175,000 Cincinnati Open tennis tournament here on Friday. 

Sania, who was eliminated in the quarter finals of last two editions of the event, thrashed Govortsova 6-1, 6-1 in just 51 minutes in the last eight stage match of the WTA Tier III tournament. 

The Indian star faces world No. 8 and top seeded Anna Chakvetadze of Russia, who is playing in the tournament for the first time, but said the win had given her much-needed confidence ahead of the challenging semi-final. 

You want to win at any stage of the tournament, but it (the score 6-1, 6-1) does give you extra confidence. Youre in the quarter finals, so youre playing the best eight, and you get an easy win, the 20-year-old said. 

Chakvetadze advanced to the semi-finals after her opponent compatriot Elena Vesnina, seeded sixth, retired with a right shoulder strain. Vesnina was trailing 6-7 (3-7), 6-0, 4-1 when she conceded the match. 

Chakvetadze had defeated Sania 6-4, 6-1 in Hobart, Australia in their only career meeting earlier this year.

 Negi back as joint leader

 Parimarjan Negi 

Kirishi (Russia): Parimarjan Negi was back in joint lead after splitting the point with IM Eduard Gorovykh of Russia in the ninth round of the World Youth Stars Chess tournament here. 

Overnight leader GM Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia was comprehensively beaten by GM Sergei Zhigalko of Belarus. 

Nepomniachtchis loss proved to be Negi and world junior champion Zaven Andriasians gain as the two caught up with the Russian on six points. 

Two rounds remain in the Category 12 event and it could be anyones title, what with IM Avetik Grigoryan just half a point behind the leading trio. 

Negi played a positional game with black pieces against Gorovykh and the Russian did not give many chances to his opponent in this keenly contested and long drawn affair. 

In a Ruy Lopez opening, Gorovykh attained a level position in the closed variation. Long manoeuvring ensued after the queens got traded as both players tried to find weaknesses in the other. (PTI)

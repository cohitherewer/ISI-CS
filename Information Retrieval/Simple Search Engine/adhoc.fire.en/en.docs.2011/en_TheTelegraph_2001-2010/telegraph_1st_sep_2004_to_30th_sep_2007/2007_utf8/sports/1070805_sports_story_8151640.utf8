Calcutta: Australia are the champions this time on volleyball courts, having spiked India 3-2 to win the second Commonwealth Volleyball Championship for men. 

At the Netaji Indoor Stadium on Saturday, the prize distribution ceremony too was quite familiar, just that the Ricky Pontings men were replaced by that of Benjamin Hardys. Its not that the Rahul Dravids (read P.S. Srikanths) did not give a fight. The Indians, with a support of 8,000-strong crowd, fought back to equalise after going down in the first two sets to see Australians emerge winners in the 15-point decider. 

A win is a win Be it on the basketball court or the on the cricketing field. Beating India always means a lot and the people back home will be overwhelmingly happy for our victory, the Australian captain, Hardy said. 

Also the win is important to us as were in a months time competing in the Asian championships in Jakarta. This obviously will give us immense confidence, Hardy added. 

It was a typical blazing start by the Australians who looked to wrap up the issue before the Indians could realise. The Indians found something missing in their blocking and passing departments as the Australians cruised to a 2-0 (25-18, 25-16) lead in just 47 minutes. 

Desperate to retrieve their position on the home turf, Sanjay Kumars deadly smashes saw the Indians level points (13-13) in the third set. Giving the Aussies a run for their money, Indians kept their momentum going. In the deciding moments, with both teams locked 23-23, India scored three successive points to pocket the third set 26-24 in just 24 minutes. 

The fourth set saw a much-improved performance from the Indians. Sanjay, combining with Sube Singh and G. Pradeep, opened up an 18-16 lead as the Australians dished out a below par performance. Taking advantage of the error-prone Aussies, India stretched a four-point lead before clinching the fourth set 25-20 in 24 minutes. 

Locked 2-2, the decider, which is a 15-point play off, saw the Australians stake their supremacy. It took them 15 minutes to clinch the issue 15-11. 

Sanjay, who scored 26 points, bagged the Best Scorers award, while Sube Singh was awarded the Best Blocker. With this Australia avenged their 1-3 loss to India in the league stage of the meet. 

Earlier, Pakistan won the third position getting past South Africa 25-10, 23-25, 25-21, 25-21.

 Chauhan likely to be on selection panel

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: Former India opener and national selector Chetan Chauhan is expected to be Indias nominee on the Asian selection panel for the June 6-10 Afro-Asia Cup. 

Ravi Shastri, who has just been appointed Team Indias cricket manager, had been Indias nominee for the inaugural edition (August 2005). 

According to The Telegraphs sources, Majid Khan will remain Pakistans nominee, but it was not clear who would represent Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. 

While the first match is in Bangalore on June 6, the last two are going to be hosted by Chennai, on June 9 and 10.

 Djokovic youngest champion in Miami

Key Biscayne: The final day of the ATP Miami Masters Sony Ericsson Open had the feel of a V.I.P. room after the last bold-face name slipped away from the party. 

Serena Williams, the four-time womens champion, had left the Crandon Park Tennis Center a day earlier and taken two of her bigger fans, the Miami Heat basketball star Dwyane Wade and the actress Kristin Davis, with her. 

Into this vacuum stepped Novak Djokovic, a fresh-faced Serb who proceeded to give the tournament its second wind and tennis its newest personality. 

Displaying the youthful exuberance of a teenager and the polished game of a veteran, Djokovic dispatched Guillermo Caas, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 on Sunday (as briefly reported in Mondays Late City edition) in his second Masters Series final in less than a month to become the youngest mens champion in the tournaments 23-year history. 

Djokovic, who is 19 years nine months, lost to Nadal in the Pacific Life Open championship at Indian Wells, then travelled directly here. He avenged his loss to Nadal in the quarter finals and became the first man since Ivan Lendl in 1989 to win the tournament without dropping a set. 

After whipping a forehand winner past Caas on match point, Djokovic landed on the court as softly as any of his drop shots. He lay there for several seconds, his bliss as clear as the skies above. 

On the last point I said, Im going for the forehand, I dont care, Djokovic said. If I make a mistake, I break racket. He smiled. And then I just fell down to the ground. I was very happy. 

He picked himself up and made his way to the net, where he wrapped his long arms around Caas, who has not been warmly received by all of his competitors since returning from a 15-month doping suspension. 

A 29-year-old Argentine, Caas was ranked No. 8 in the world in 2005 when he was barred from the Tour after testing positive for a banned diuretic. He returned to competition last fall, after winning an appeal, and upset Federer in the second round at Indian Wells last month. 

He had to play his way into the main draw here, and after he defeated five ranked players, including the top-ranked Federer, to reach the final, his legs did not have much spring left. Im old, Caas said, laughing. After nine matches, all my body hurts. 

Caas received treatment on his left thigh during a change-over late in the third set, and he was being tended to by the ATP trainer Bill Norris after the match as Djokovic circled his changeover area as if in shock. 

Djokovic shed his sweat-soaked yellow shirt and then his racket, handing it to a young woman who was standing in the front row of the stands, directly behind where he had played the matchs final game. 

It was a very emotional moment for me, said Djokovic, who added that he considered giving away my shoes and shorts and everything.

 India have the edge: Saqlain

Karachi: Former Pakistan off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq feels India can make it difficult for England in the upcoming Test series if their bowlers back the batsmen. 

India have depth in their batting It just needs to be backed up by the bowlers. It is very easy to lose control in English conditions where the ball does a bit, said Saqlain. 

Zaheer Khan, Sreesanth and others must stick to a disciplined line and length and the batsmen will make mistakes, he said on Saturday. 

Saqlain said Indias experienced middle-order gives them an edge in the series starting from Thursday at Lords. 

It will be a very closely contested series because both teams are balanced. But India definitely have the edge, he said. 

Saqlain warned England to expect big performances from experienced players Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly. 

I have never seen him (Tendulkar) so hungry for success. He is spending a lot of time in the nets and on his fitness. Despite his age hes charged up for the series. 

Technically he remains a gifted batsman and a fantastic timer of the ball. I do not know why people are writing him off. Similar is the case with Ganguly who looks determined, said Saqlain, who practised with Tendulkar in the nets.

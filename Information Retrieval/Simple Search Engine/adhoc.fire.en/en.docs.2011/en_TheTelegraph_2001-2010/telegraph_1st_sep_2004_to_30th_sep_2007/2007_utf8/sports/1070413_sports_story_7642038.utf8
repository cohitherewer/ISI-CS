 Vijay regains title after 4 yrs 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Smiles were back in Vijay Singhs camp after the trainer claimed the championship title as the winter season came to an end on Thursday. Singh, though, failed to recall when he had won the title last time. The record books indicate it was the 2002-03 season which was his best in terms of numbers. Vijay saddled 46 winners as against Daniel Davids 37 this season. Daniel, who had been ruling the roost during the past four years, was badly let down by his jockeys in the past three weeks. Imran Chisty was the champion jockey with 35 wins to his credit against C. Rajendras 22.

 The trainer who is fast climbing up the ladder with a moderate string is Javed Khan. He finished the season with 22 winners. Afzal Khan was the champion apprentice.

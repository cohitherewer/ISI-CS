 Malik named Pak captain 

 - Our team is capable of bouncing back from the Caribbean debacle 

 My job is to look ahead, not look back, says Shoaib Malik 

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has named allrounder Shoaib Malik as captain of the national team following the resignation of Inzamam-ul Haq in the wake of the sides early World Cup exit. 

The 25-year-old, who has played in 18 Tests and 137 one-day Internationals, was handed the role until the end of the year for the Test and one-day squads. 

His first assignment is expected to be a three-match one-day series against Sri Lanka next month. 

Malik has been appointed as captain with the future of Pakistan cricket in mind, PCB chairman Dr Nasim Asraf told reporters on Thursday. 

The board overlooked senior batsman Mohammed Yousuf for the post, which was also offered to and turned down by Younis Khan earlier this month. 

Pakistan were eliminated from the World Cup after losing their first two games against the West Indies and Ireland. The day after the second defeat, coach Bob Woolmer was found murdered in Jamaica. 

Malik said on Thursday: Our team is capable of bouncing back from the Caribbean debacle and we just need to get our confidence back that was dented after what happened in the last few weeks. 

He added: We have to work extra hard on our fielding to reduce the gap with other teams. We must be back to our best when we play South Africa and India later this year. 

Ashraf added that former Test player Talat Ali would remain as manager for the next two years in recognition of the efficient manner in which he handled matters in the wake of the 58-year-old Britons death. 

A new selection committee, headed by former Test player Salahuddin Ahmed, has already been named by the board as part of its rebuilding process. 

Ashraf also said the board had decided unanimously that a strict code of conduct would be enforced on the team. 

There will be no compromise on discipline at all. The selectors have also been told to select only those players who are 100 per cent fit, he said. 

He said the presence of a senior official like Talat would help Malik settle quickly into his new role. 

We are hopeful Malik will handle this challenge well. 

Ashraf said no decision had yet been made regarding a new coach or vice-captain. 

I know it is not going to be easy replacing someone of the calibre of Inzamam-ul Haq as captain because he commanded a lot of respect in the team and was the senior most player. But it is not the first time a junior player has been named captain in Pakistan cricket, Malik said. 

The last few weeks have been very difficult for the team and we lost a good coach in Bob Woolmer, he said. 

But my job is to look ahead and not look back. We need to unite and start doing well again. We need to restore the peoples confidence in the team. (Agencies)

A Profile 

 A gifted free-flowing batsman and off-spiner, Shoaib Malik is a surprise choice in the presence of senior players like Mohammad Yousuf and Abdul Razzaq.

 Has faced problems with his bowling action twice in his career, being reported by the International Cricket Council (ICC). Underwent elbow surgery to rectify the problem last year.

 In 2005, Malik admitted deliberately losing a domestic Twenty20 match while captaining Sialkot against Karachi.

Later apologised and an inquiry committee fined and banned him for two matches but did not find him guilty of getting any financial rewards for his role in conceding the match.

 Pakistans late coach, Bob Woolmer spoke highly of his abilities and tipped him as a future Pakistan captain.

 Since his debut, Malik has played under the captaincy of Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, Rashid Latif, Moin Khan and Inzamam-ul Haq.

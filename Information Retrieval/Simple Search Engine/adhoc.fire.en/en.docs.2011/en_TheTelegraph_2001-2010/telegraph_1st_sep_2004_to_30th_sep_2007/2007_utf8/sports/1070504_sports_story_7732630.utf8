 We cut our throats: Ferguson

HENRY WINTER in MILAN

Outwitted tactically, outclassed technically, Manchester United are out of the European Cup and what will frustrate Sir Alex Ferguson most is that his team was outfought here on Wednesday night. How they lacked a dog of war like Gennaro Gattuso, who was at Uniteds expensive ankles like a ravenous pit-bull. 

Gattuso simply refused talents like Cristiano Ronaldo the air to breathe, let alone the space to express themselves, and the best player in the Premiership disappeared. Even Uniteds lesser lights were hounded into submission by Gattuso. The Italian World Cup-winner went in so hard on Darren Fletcher that he lost a shin-pad, but not the ball. 

That was the key. Milan won the ball time and again, and used possession superbly as their fans sang in the rain. Just as the elements threw everything at the contestants, so Milan launched everything at United, seizing the lead after 11 minutes through the imperious Kaka, extending it through the tireless, ageless Clarence Seedorf on the half-hour before Alberto Gilardino got the party really started. 

Fergusons side was handed a lesson in pass and move, support and shoot: Milans football was chess with knives, and United were cut to pieces by Gattuso and company. Milans No. 8 will have more of a fight on his hands in the final when he encounters a Liverpool side led by another No. 8, Steven Gerrard, who loathes Gattuso from their meeting in Istanbul two years ago. 

With plots Inspector Morse would struggle to solve, only in the bizarre world of modern football could the Champions Cup be contested by a side which qualified after finishing third in their league, and another who failed to qualify because of a corruption scandal but appealed and were reinstated. Simple. 

Yet Athens promises much on May 23, not least a party between the tens of thousands of merry envoys from Anfield and San Siro. As well as smiling policemen, relieved at avoiding a showdown between bitter rivals from the East Lancs Road, Athens will brim with sub-plots, many harking back to Istanbul. 

Can Milan hold on to a lead? Will Gattuso risk smirking in the tunnel at half-time as Gerrard charges past? Will Dida match the penalty-saving brio of his Anfield counterpart? Will the wise heads of Milan live with the strong hearts of Liverpool? Will the European Cup spend the night at the end of Gerrards hotel bed again? Will Peter Crouch against Paolo Maldini be the ultimate in long-in-the-leg versus long-in-the-tooth? So many questions. 

In Greece, many admiring eyes will be on the clever Brazilian artist Kaka, surely destined for European Footballer of the Year honours after eclipsing Ronaldo, his main challenger, home and away. From the moment Kaka ghosted past the struggling Nemanja Vidic, United knew they were in for a chastening night. 

Vidic then failed to close down Kaka, who had lost Fletcher in midfield, gliding on to Seedorfs headed flick, menace trailing in his wake. His finish was magnificent, the ball swept irresistibly past Edwin van der Sar. 

San Siro erupted, the Ultras screaming in delight, waving the placards that had spelled out WIN FOR US before kick-off. The reaction was understandable: Kakas was a goal that could have graced the local catwalks. 

United appeared daunted, cautious even, with Paul Scholes eschewing tackles as he was on a booking. 

Ferguson had removed Scholes from the boiler-room, initially playing him as the middleman in a support trident behind Wayne Rooney, but Scholes soon dropped back to assist Fletcher and Michael Carrick in fighting the fires fanned by Kaka. 

Ryan Giggs showed there was life in the visitors, drawing a smothering stop from Dida, but Uniteds usual outlets, Ronaldo and Rooney, endured a night filled with frustration. Five minutes from the break, Ferguson switched his attacking players, pushing Ronaldo more central, but Milan were two goals to the good by then. Again Vidic was found wanting, losing possession to Andrea Pirlo on Uniteds left as San Siro cackled. 

Again Milan showed their capacity to mete out swift punishment. Pirlos delivery caused chaos, Vidic heading hurriedly out to Seedorf on the edge of the box. The Dutchman touched the ball past Carrick, ignored Vidics rash challenge and drilled the ball inexorably past Van der Sar. San Siro loved it. 

And a gloomy Ferguson admitted his team had paid the price for a slow start. 

I expected more from my team. Wed done so well to get this far, but tonight we never came out of the blocks, he said. 

I think if we had coped better at the start of the game, and come through the first 25 minutes without cutting our own throats it would have been okay. You cant afford to give away goals, and we gave away two soft ones tonight. 

Thats not to take credit away from a fantastic performance by AC Milan, though at this level we should be doing better than that.

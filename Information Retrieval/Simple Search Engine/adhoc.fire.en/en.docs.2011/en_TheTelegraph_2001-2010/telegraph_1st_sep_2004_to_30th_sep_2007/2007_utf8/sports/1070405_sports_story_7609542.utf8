 Richardson, Garner find it unbelievable

 Is Lara's break well-deserved?

Bridgetown: West Indies decision to allow players time off in the middle of their struggling World Cup Super Eight campaign has come under fire from former players. 

Former captain Richie Richardson called the move unbelievable and Joel Garner, the feared paceman of the 1970s and 80s, said it was madness. 

Imran Khan, the teams media officer, said that the players were given the option of taking two full days off after Sundays defeat to Sri Lanka in Guyana which leaves them needing victory in all three of their remaining second-stage games to have a slim hope of survival. 

Khan said that five players Chris Gayle, Marlon Samuels, Jerome Taylor, Devon Smith and Daren Powell along with team officials travelled to Grenada. The other players returned to their home islands. 

Their next match is against South Africa on April 10 in Grenada. I saw them in the first round in Jamaica and I felt they looked really good, Richardson, a flamboyant right-hander who made 5,949 runs in 86 Tests, said. Then, when they came to Antigua, it was a totally different ball game and they looked totally flat. 

Now we are hearing they want time to go home and relax. Thats unbelievable in the middle of a tournament when they should be representing their people. They have let us down. 

What about teams like Australia and New Zealand who play much more cricket than our guys? Arent they tired too? We should be bonding as a unit and getting ready for the big matches coming up, not going off in different directions. 

Successive defeats to Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka in the Super Eight have left Brian Laras team in danger of crashing out of the tournament before the semi-finals. 

Garner lashed out at the team and said heading off was a bunch of nonsense. 

Going home to do what? he said. It serves no purpose, as a matter of fact its a bunch of nonsense. We have a drastic situation where we need to win all three matches to qualify for the next stage. 

You cant walk off in the middle of the battle. We have to be together and correct the errors and get things right. 

After the South Africa game, the hosts face Bangladesh and England at Kensington Oval in Bridgetown. 

They won the first two editions of the World Cup, both played in England, in 1975 and 1979 but have not seriously threatened since losing the 1983 final to India. (Reuters)

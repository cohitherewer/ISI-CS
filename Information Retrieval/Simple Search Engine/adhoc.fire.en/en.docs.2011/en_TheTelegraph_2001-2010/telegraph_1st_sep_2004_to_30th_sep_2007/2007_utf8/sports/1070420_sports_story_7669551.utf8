 Tough dropping Ntini: Smith 

 Bridgetown: Struggling South Africa fast bowler Makhaya Ntini is battling to save his World Cup dream. 

The 29-year-old was dropped from the team for the crucial Super Eight match against England on Tuesday despite the Kensington Oval pitch having both pace and bounce. 

It was the first time in six years that Ntini, a powerful black role model at home, had been axed from the team on anything other than fitness grounds. 

South Africa skipper Graeme Smith admitted it was very tough dropping Ntini, his teams spearhead for many years but who has been struggling in the ongoing tournament with just six wickets in seven matches. 

It was a very difficult decision, Smith said after the crushing nine-wicket victory for a place in the semi-finals. 

The discussion started after the last game. We were looking for more throughout the 50 overs. Shaun Pollock and Charl Langeveldt bowled superbly with the new ball and they are capable of changes of pace at the end. 

Makhayas a great team man and well be reassessing the situation before the next game.

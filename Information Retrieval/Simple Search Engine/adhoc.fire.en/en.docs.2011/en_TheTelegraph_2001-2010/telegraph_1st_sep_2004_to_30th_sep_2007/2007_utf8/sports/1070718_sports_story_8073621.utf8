 Gillians request to BCCI

Mumbai: Bob Woolmers widow Gillian has requested India and Pakistan to play a Twenty20 game to raise funds for a cricket academy the former Pakistan coach had planned to set up in South Africa. 

She has written to the president requesting to arrange a Twenty20 match for the academy, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Niranjan Shah said on Tuesday. A decision has not been taken yet, he said. We need to find the time because weve already finalised our schedule. 

Woolmer died in Jamaica in March, a day after Pakistan suffered a shock World Cup defeat by debutants Ireland and went out in the first round. 

His death was investigated as murder until after the World Cup when Jamaican authorities announced that it was due to natural causes. 

The former England allrounder coached South Africa in the 1990s and had settled there. Woolmers family wants to bring his academy plans to fruition through a trust fund set up in his memory.

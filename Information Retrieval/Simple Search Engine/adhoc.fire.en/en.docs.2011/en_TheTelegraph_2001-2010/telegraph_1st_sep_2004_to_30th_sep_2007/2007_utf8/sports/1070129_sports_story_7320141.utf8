 Calcutta: Unfancied Diptanu Das of St Augustine Days emerged surprise sole leader, with 7.5 points, after the eighth round of the 19th The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship at Gorky Sadan on Sunday. 

Diptanu, the 34th seed, upset No. 14 Antarip Roy of St Pauls Mission before beating giantkiller Sukanya Dutta of South Point. Close on his heels are overnight leaders- Shreyansh Daklia and Sukanya (7 each). 

Three rounds remain in this Swiss league competition being organised by Alekhine Chess Club. 

In the morning session, Sukanya continued her string of upsets by scalping top seed Daklia of Chhattisgarh. Defending champion Bitan Banerjee of Baruipur HS won in the morning against Aubhropratim Manna of Don Bosco, Park Circus, but later got outwitted by Daklia in a long endgame. 

Kaushalendra Kumar of Bihar was held by Pallabi Roy of Indira Gandhi Memorial HS, while Chandrashish Majumder of St Xaviers drew with Kumar Gaurav of Bihar in an opposite-coloured bishop ending.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Big W may not have seen the last of Sampras

 NEIL HARMAN

Dont tell Tim Henman because he would probably choke on his Weetybangs, but a certain man with a decent track record on grass still regrets the way he departed the championships and has discussed the idea of righting a wrong. 

A rumour doing the rounds on Friday was that Pete Sampras had been offered a wild card into the 2007 tournament, but Ian Ritchie, the chief executive of the All England Club, said that no such thing had happened. Hes a member, though, and if he ever wanted to come back and play, it is something wed happily discuss, Ritchie said. 

But who is to say it will not happen next year, or the year after that? The seven-time champion is 35 the same age as Jonas Bjrkman, the Swede who reached the semi-finals last year and the last 16 at the French Open this month and is the same weight as when he stepped off the treadmill, fresh from a stupendous triumph at the 2002 US Open for his 14th Grand Slam title. 

When Sampras returned to competitive action this year, playing Team Tennis for Newport Beach and in the Outback Champions Series an American golden oldies tour in which he is unbeaten there was a sense that he would not be satisfied merely with hitting a few balls with his old pals and that there was an ulterior motive. 

When you hear Sampras speak on the sports present trends, it sends a shiver down the spine. 

I have a hard time watching how these guys play today, he said. Its just amazing that everyone stays back and hits with so much spin. When you put spin on the ball on grass, it doesnt really do anything. Slice does, top-spin doesnt. 

I was watching (Igor) Andreev playing (James) Blake in the first round and Andreev hits that big top-spin backhand and it just sits up there, waiting to be hit. Granted, the guy is a clay-court player who isnt real comfortable on grass. But still 

The bottom line is that nobody comes with heat and can back it up. Theres no Richard Krajicek around to really attack you and take your time away. Thats the key to winning with the serve-and-volley game: deny the other guy his time. Roger (Federer) can win without doing it because he has so much game and such good hands. 

I think the 1990s may have been the toughest time to win Wimbledon. The grass was fast, the balls were fast and there were a lot of guys around who could turn it into a crap-shoot: Stefan (Edberg), Boris (Becker), Goran (Ivanisevic), those guys really made you uncomfortable. 

By contrast, I always loved seeing guys who wanted to play back against me players who liked to load up and hit their shots. Andre (Agassi) was different because he played up in the court and he played pretty flat, so he was coming to the table with something an ability not just to keep you from getting in, but maybe even push you back. But with other guys who played back, I felt if I could hit one shot and be in there, Id be in control. And control is what its all about.

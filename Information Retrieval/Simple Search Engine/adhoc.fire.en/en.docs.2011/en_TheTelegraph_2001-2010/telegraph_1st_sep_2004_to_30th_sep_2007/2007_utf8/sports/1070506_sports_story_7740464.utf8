 Murder theory likely to be contested

Karachi: The two Pakistani investigators, who travelled to Kingston to assist the probe into Bob Woolmers death, are likely to contest the theory that the coach had been murdered. 

Pakistani cricket officials and players believe Woolmer died a natural death and according to sources, the investigators, too, are of the same view. 

Mir Zubair, who was also the chief investigator in the 2002 murder case of US journalist Daniel Pearl in Karachi, said he and fellow investigator Kaleem Imam had based their report on whatever they had seen and been briefed on in Kingston. 

Now it is up to the interior ministry to release any details to the media, he said, refusing to disclose its content. 

Woolmer was found unconscious in his Kingston hotel room on March 18, a day after Pakistan lost to Ireland and were bundled out of the World Cup. 

Woolmer was later pronounced dead and Jamaican police believe the coach was strangled to death, after possibly being poisoned. 

This is a high profile case and our job was to meet with the investigators there and observe things ourselves and then report back with our comments. We have done that, Zubair said. 

Asked if he got full co-operation from the Jamaican authorities, Zubair said they had done their job of seeing for themselves what was happening in the murder investigations. (PTI)

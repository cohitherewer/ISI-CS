Chittagong: Nuwan Zoysa cant get over the disappointment of missing out on a World Cup berth. Sri Lanka reached the final before losing to Australia in the quadrennial showpiece last month. 

Getting dropped from the World Cup squad will remain one of the biggest disappointments of my career. I watched the semi-final and final sitting in Bangladesh and felt proud to be a Sri Lankan. We played some terrific cricket, Zoysa told The Telegraph on Sunday at Dhaka airport en route to Colombo. 

The left-arm seamer, who has played 30 Tests and 95 ODIs, was part of an academy side that took part in a triangular meet. Pakistan were the third team. India did not participate in keeping with the Board of Control for Cricket in Indias policy of not sending academy teams on tours. 

Zoysa was a member of the side that toured India in January but eventually was left out of the Cup squad. It created an uproar in Sri Lanka with many considering Zoysa a better bet than Dilhara Fernando. 

Zoysa, though, is not losing heart. There are lot of matches coming up. I can still prove my mettle with good and consistent performance, he added. 

Known to be injury prone, Zoysa claims he has regained full fitness. I have worked hard on my fitness in the last couple of years. I am no more prone to injuries. Hopefully I can prove it with my performance. 

Zoysa, who achieved the rare feat of claiming a hattrick in the first over of a match against Zimbabwe in Harare (1999-2000), felt the series here has helped his rhythm. The tour has come off really well Im satisfied.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Unbelievably, for the BCCI, its just another day

 - 75 YEARS OF INDIA IN TEST CRICKET

 Calcutta: Monday will mark 

 the completion of 75 years of India in Test cricket but, 

 true to form, the Board of Control for Cricket in India 

 (BCCI) has nothing lined up to celebrate the occasion. 

 In fact, one wonders just how many in the BCCI are 

 even aware of the significance of June 25, 1932. 

 The day clashes with an 

 ICC meeting in London and, then, our team is in Ireland... 

 The England amp; Wales Cricket Board has planned something 

 and a commemorative stamp is going to be issued, explained 

 the BCCIs chief administrative officer, Prof. Ratnakar 

 Shetty, when contacted by The Telegraph 

 in Mumbai. 

Well, if the absence of Rahul Dravid and Co. is an excuse, then the BCCI should have scheduled the offshore ODIs at a more suitable time. 

As for the meeting in London, only secretary Niranjan Shah has to attend the one on Monday. President Sharad Pawar could surely have done his bit in the morning before taking a London-bound flight. 

But, then, he has bigger ambitions and the No. 1 position in the BCCI has become a stepping stone. 

Of course, for those whove played a part in Indias growth as a Test-playing nation, its probably a moment to reflect nostalgically. Former captain Bishan Singh Bedi summed it up best for most, one assumes when he said, I wish I could be on the field even this time... 

However, given the unprofessional and insensitive manner in which the BCCI is being run, some could even be wishing theyd never had anything to do with it. 

The challenges on the field are pretty obvious. Off it, the way forward will be turning pro with a capital P. And, if were to see Test cricketers of quality (and in bigger numbers), then the domestic structure has to be overhauled. 

Its not going to be a big ask if the will is there. 

 While looking ahead, one hopes Pawar and his men wont 

 forget the significance of June 25, 2008 the silver jubilee 

 of our terrific World Cup triumph.

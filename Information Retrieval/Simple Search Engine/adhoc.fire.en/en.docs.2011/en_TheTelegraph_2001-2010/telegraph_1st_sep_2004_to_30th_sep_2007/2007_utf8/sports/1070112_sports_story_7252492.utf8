The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mood not in favour of Sehwag, Harbhajan

 - Sourav will be back good chance for Joginder 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Harbhajan Singh and Virender Sehwag 

Calcutta: Sourav Gangulys one-day comeback will be in Nagpur, on January 21, but Virender Sehwag and Harbhajan Singh are unlikely to be picked for the first two ODIs against the West Indies. 

The mood is to drop both Harbhajan and Sehwag So, unless theres some sympathy for them overnight, they wont be in the squad for Nagpur and Cuttack (January 24), a well-placed source told The Telegraph on Thursday. 

The selectors are getting together in Rajkot on Friday morning/afternoon. 

Captain Rahul Dravid and coach Greg Chappell are also going to be present on a day when chairman Dilip Vengsarkar and his colleagues (Venkatapathi Raju, Bhupinder Singh, Sanjay Jagdale and Ranjib Biswal) name the 30 World Cup probables as well. 

As the probables list wont be substantially different from the 30 for last years Champions Trophy Haryanas Joginder Sharma, Bengals Ranadeb Bose and Delhis Ishant Sharma are bound to be in, though the attention is more on the squad for Nagpur and Cuttack. 

Sehwag did get a hundred (at No.4) for Delhi on Wednesday, but the powers-that-be dont seem to have been impressed. 

As for Harbhajan, who didnt get a look-in during the three-Test series in South Africa, a couple of very influential gentlemen are cut up with him. 

Theres a question mark over V.V.S. Laxman, too. He may, therefore, only make it if the squad has 15 and not 14 players. 

Theres a move, incidentally, to select rookie Mumbai batsman Rohit Sharma and keep Laxman for Test cricket alone. 

If both Sehwag and Laxman arent there (Yuvraj Singh, in any case, is unavailable), it wont be a big surprise if the vice-captaincy is handed to Sourav. 

Apparently, a section within the Board has floated that idea, but many wont take very kindly to the former captain becoming part of the team management. 

There have been exceptions but, usually, a vice-captain isnt named for engagements at home. 

Interestingly, quite a few are looking at Dinesh Karthik to fill one of the berths for specialist batsmen. It could, eventually, be a toss up between him and Robin Uthappa. 

The certainties (as of late Thursday) for the first two ODIs are: Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav, Dravid, Suresh Raina, Dinesh Mongia, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Anil Kumble, Ramesh Powar, Ajit Agarkar, Zaheer Khan and Sreesanth. 

Very well placed is Joginder, who last played for India 25 months ago. 

In contention are: Laxman, Karthik, Uthappa and young Rohit.

 Indonesia, Korea in last 4

Glasgow: Korea and Indonesia made the semi-finals of the Sudirman Cup world team badminton meet on Wednesday but the Koreans cut it desperately fine. They lost their final round-robin match to Denmark 2-3 but squeezed through their group in second place on games count-back after finishing level on points with the Danes. 

Had the result been 4-1 the Danes would have progressed but the Korean womens doubles pairing of Kyung Won-lee and Hyo Jung-lee battled out a 21-19, 21-14 victory over Danish duo Lena Frier Kristiansen and Kamilla Rytter Juhl in the final match. (Agencies)

 Rastogi aims to improve fitness

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Having struck a deal with the Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL), Karan Rastogi is on a high at the moment. 

In the city to play take part in the Mens ITF Future Tennis Tournament, Karan said it really feels good and will help in motivating him. As per the deal, the Mumbai-based company would sponsor an amount of Rs 60 lakh to help Karan towards his coaching expense in the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy in New York. The company will also take care of all his travelling expenses, coaching fees, accommodation expensed incurred during the training and participation in national and international tournament round the year. 

With the support the training would be a bit different this year, Karan, who has been training there on and off for last three four years, said. 

Ill be there in the end of the March for a week. Ill resume my intensive training three/four weeks later. With DHFLs support, I can extend my training this year so it will be better hopefully. 

However, his target is not ranking. What he eyes is fitness, which is high on agenda. The game, and the rank will increase once I become lot more stronger and consistent.

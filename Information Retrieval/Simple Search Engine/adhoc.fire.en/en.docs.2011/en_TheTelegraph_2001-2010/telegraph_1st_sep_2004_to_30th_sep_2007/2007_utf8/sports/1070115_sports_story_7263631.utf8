The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mahesh teams up with Daniela

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mahesh Bhupathi has chosen Daniela Hantuchova as her mixed doubles partner for the Australian Open. 

The doubles ace won with Martina Hingis in Melbourne last year. 

Bhupathi has 10 Grand Slam titles in his kitty, including half a dozen in the mixed event (with different partners). He has won with the Slovak glamour girl before, at the 2005 US Open. 

In mens doubles, Bhupathi will be kicking off his partnership with Radek Stepanek at the years first Grand Slam. 

Leander Paes, aiming to concentrate on mens doubles, is unlikely to play the mixed this year. Paes and Martin Damm had made the final in the 2006 edition in their first tournament as a pair.

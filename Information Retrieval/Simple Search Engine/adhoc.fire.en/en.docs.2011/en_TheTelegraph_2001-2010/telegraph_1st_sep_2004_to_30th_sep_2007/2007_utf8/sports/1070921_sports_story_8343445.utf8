 Australia sail into semis

Cape Town: Openers Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist continued their prolific form to take Australia into the ICC World Twenty20 semi-finals after a 10-wicket win over Sri Lanka at Newlands on Thursday. 

Needing a modest 102 for victory and qualification from Super Eights group F, Hayden lashed 58 from 38 deliveries with seven fours and two sixes while Gilchrist remained unbeaten on 31 from just 25 balls. 

It was the second century stand between the pair in the tournament following a 104 run partnership against Bangladesh and 78 against England. All three matches ended in victory. 

Earlier, Stuart Clark and Brett Lee shared six quick wickets to send Sri Lanka spiralling to a dismal 101 all out in 19.3 overs after being sent in to bat by Australia captain Gilchrist. 

It was a must-win situation for both teams and the Australians were at their professional best. 

Upul Tharanga, Jayawardene, Chamara Silva and Tillekeratne Dilshan got out to poor shots as they went in search of quick runs and perished. 

The bowling was accompanied by top class fielding as was evident by the catch taken by Michael Clarke at point to dismiss Farveez Maharoof. 

Wickets fell in each of the first three overs and by the halfway point the innings was in disarray at 43-7 with Lee claiming 2-27 and Clark demolishing the middle order with 4-20 from his four overs. 

Left-arm seamer Nathan Bracken (2-14) was no less impressive than Lee and Clark. 

The result eliminates Sri Lanka and guarantees that Pakistan join Australia in Saturdays semi-finals. 

The only sore point for the Aussies could be a possible injury scare for allrounder Shane Watson, who had to leave the field in the middle of an over for what looked like a hamstring problem.

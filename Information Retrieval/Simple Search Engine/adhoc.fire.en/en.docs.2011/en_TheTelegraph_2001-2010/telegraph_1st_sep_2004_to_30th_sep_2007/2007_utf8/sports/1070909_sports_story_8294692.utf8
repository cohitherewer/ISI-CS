 EB depend on Edmilson

 - FEDERATION CUP 

 Crunch day for Calcutta clubs 

JAYDEEP BASU

 Edmilson 

Ludhiana: In the land of bhangra, it is the act of samba that might have the final say when East Bengal meet hosts JCT in the crucial Federation Cup quarter final tie at the Guru Nanak Dev Stadium here on Sunday. 

On paper, both teams are evenly poised to make the cut for the penultimate round, but seem to be heavily dependent on their Brazilian recruits to deliver the goods. 

Since last season, East Bengal have become deeply reliant on their Brazilian striker Edmilson who has scored 21 goals in 28 matches after joining last season. JCT too are now craving for yet another inspired performance from their new recruit Eduardo Escobar to send the red and yellow brigade back to Calcutta packing. 

East Bengal coach Subrata Bhattacharya is still not ready to attach much importance to Escobar though the fitness of Edmilson remains a matter of concern for him. 

The Brazilian suffered a stomach upset a couple of days ago and is yet to recover fully. I hope he gets fit by tomorrow, said the East Bengal coach biting his lip. In defence, Bhattacharya might bring in Debabrata Roy in place of Soumik Dey. 

He has reasons to feel distressed as two of his other players striker Ashim Bswas and midfielder Mehrajuddin Wadao are also indisposed though both are likely to take the field. 

The East Bengal coach is not ready to lay down the arms without offering a fight. Here in Ludhiana, I never lost a match when I was the Mohun Bagan coach, Bhattacharya said. It wont be any different tomorrow. 

It certainly wont be easier than said. The flair and pace JCT displayed against Vasco in the opener, could be tormenting for East Bengal defence, who were found wanting against Mohammedan Sporting. 

Escobar could easily be JCTs trump card on Sunday. To make things more difficult for East Bengal, the Brazilian would be backed by compatriot Marcos Pereira, Sunil Chhetri and evergreen Rennedy Singh, the man with golden crosses from the left. 

It would be a tough fight, said the genial JCT coach Sukhwinder Singh with his trademark smile. A match is always won and lost on the pitch, but this tournament is extremely important for us. 

Punjab teams havent ever lost a major tournament on their home ground and JCT would definitely be out to keep the reputation intact. East Bengal, on the other hand, have a poor track record in Federation Cup, it last won the trophy in 1996, that, too, at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

Time East Bengal turned the tide and there could be no better occasion than on Sunday.

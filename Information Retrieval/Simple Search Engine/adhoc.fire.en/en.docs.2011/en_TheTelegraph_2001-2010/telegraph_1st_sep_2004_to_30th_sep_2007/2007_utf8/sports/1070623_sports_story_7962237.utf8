 Vandort to replace Tharanga 

Colombo: Sri Lanka called up opener Michael Vandort on Friday as replacement for the injured Upul Tharanga for the upcoming Tests against Bangladesh. 

Tharanga, 22, is set to miss at least the first Test later this month after suffering a hairline fracture in his left foot. 

The left-hander suffered the injury during net practice and is expected to be out of the side for around two weeks. 

We are hoping there is a chance that he can play in the second Test, captain Mahela Jayawardene told reporters. 

Senior openers Sanath Jayasuriya and Maravan Atapattu are both unavailable for the three-match series. 

The first Test begins in Colombo on June 25.

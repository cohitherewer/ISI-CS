 Indians scared of pace, says Rodney Hogg

New Delhi: Indian batsmen are a scared species, making them an easy prey for the Australian pace battery in the upcoming ODI series, feel former Aussie bowlers Ray Bright and Rodney Hogg. 

Former pacer Hogg and Bright a left-arm spinner of the 70s felt the Indians would not get much of a home advantage in the seven-match series starting September 29. 

Well I say, good luck. Which they (India) would need, Hogg was quoted as saying by a television channel. 

Unfortunately India tends to play Bangladesh a lot, so they tend to stretch up cricket, said Bright as he took pot shot at the Indian line-up. 

Describing the Indian batsmen as arrogant, Hogg said they were scared of facing pacers. Couple of Indian batsmen are scared species, might be slightly arrogant and certainly there is no way to hide when people like Clark are going to go to India. With their pace theres nowhere to hide, he said. 

Former Australian batsman Gary Cosier echoed a similar view and said Indians would buckle under pressure when faced with an accurate attack. (PTI)

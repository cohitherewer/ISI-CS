 United wary of Roma

Rome/ London: AS Romas players are confident they can produce another giant-killing performance and beat Manchester United, while Chelsea will take on Valencia amid fresh speculation that coach Jose Mourinho is in his final season at Stamford Bridge, in the two crucial Champions League quarter-final clashes on Wednesday. 

After eliminating Olympique Lyon with a 2-0 away win in the last 16, the Serie A side are confident they can upset the odds and beat the Premier League leaders. 

Alex Ferguson will be treating Roma with the utmost respect, too, because he rated Lyon as one of the best teams in the competition before their elimination. (Reuters)

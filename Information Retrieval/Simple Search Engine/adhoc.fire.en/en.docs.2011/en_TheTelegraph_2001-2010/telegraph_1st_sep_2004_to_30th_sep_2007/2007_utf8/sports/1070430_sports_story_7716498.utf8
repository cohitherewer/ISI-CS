Bridgetown: Australian captain Ricky Ponting said his teams fourth World Cup triumph and third on the trot showed the chasm between their team and the rest of the cricketing nations. 

We played unbelievable cricket all through and did not have a close game in the competition We made the good teams look ordinary, Ponting said after his sides 53-run win over Sri Lanka in the final here on Saturday. 

We are never happy and satisfied with our performance levels and continue to challenge ourselves to improve. Winning it for a third straight time is an amazing feeling. Playing with this group of players is very special. 

The 2007 World Cup was termed as the most open one of all times but as it unfolded, Australia remained unbeaten in all their 11 contests and whats more, they never looked like losing any one. It might sound a clich but we honestly never spoke about three successive World Cup wins among ourselves. We wanted to take every single game one at a time. 

Ponting also praised the Sri Lankans for the way they had fought in the final. 

Sri Lanka did take up the challenge in the afternoon. (Sanath) Jayasuriya and (Kumar) Sangakkara are two quality players and they kept them in the game. At some stage, their run-rate was on par. 

But once we got Sangakkara, we put our nose in front. They gave us a good game. 

Looking ahead, Ponting believed it would be an exciting time to mould the younger players into a continuous winning unit for Australia. 

Personally, it will be an exciting time. I never go into a game without trying to win it and it would be the same. 

Im not worried about that. Weve had Justin (Langer), Shane (Warne), Glenn (McGrath) and Damien Martyn leave the Test team at the end of summer and Im actually looking at as a more exciting time in my career, Ponting said. 

Acknowledging Australias supremacy, Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene said, They were too good for us today. We chased quite well and were in a very good position at one time but could not keep up with the asking rate. 

Player of the Tournament Glenn McGrath, who finished with 26 wickets (the highest tally in a single World Cup), said, I am happy with the way things went. I couldnt have hoped for more and had great fun. 

McGrath pointed out that the Australian team is in a strong shape despite his exit from the scene. It is good to see the young guys coming through in the team. 

He played in four World Cups and said the Australian team improved in each edition. (PTI)

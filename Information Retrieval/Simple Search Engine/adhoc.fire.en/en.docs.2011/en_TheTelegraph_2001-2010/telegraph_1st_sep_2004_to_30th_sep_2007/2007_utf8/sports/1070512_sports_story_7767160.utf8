 Kuruvilla in the fray 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former India medium-pacer Abey Kuruvilla has emerged as a contender for the post of Bengal coach. 

It has been learnt that the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) is keen on having a young candidate as Paras Mhambreys successor and Kuruvilla has a few backers among the powers-that-be. 

The CAB president Prasun Mukherjee has admitted that they are looking for a young coach. We are mainly focussing on the candidates who are young and are capable of understanding the players mentality, he said on Friday. 

Names of the present Team India fielding coach Robin Singh and Balwinder Singh Sandhu are also doing the rounds, along with former Bengal players Gopal Bose, Pranab Roy and Devang Gandhi. The CAB is also seeking advice from former India captain Sourav Ganguly on this issue. 

Mhambrey has left the job after guiding Bengal to back-to-back Ranji Trophy finals and is currently employed as Baroda coach. 

Meanwhile, the CAB has roped in Pijush Singh as chief physiotherapist for the senior side. Mukherjee announced the appointment on Friday, after a two-hour long meeting with Sourav and Deep Dasgupta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Gavaskar to open in one-dayer today

 - Bengal cautious after last seasons loss to Assam

Calcutta: Last seasons loss to Assam has put the Bengal wards on alert this season, though the Ranji Trophy finalists are a much better side at least on paper when they face each other in the National one-dayers opener at the Barabati Stadium in Cuttack on Tuesday. 

The last years loss (also in the Round I) in Dhanbad is still vivid in their memories. We are not taking them lightly but seriously, which was put across to each player in the team meeting today. Last years loss is still afresh, a team source said. Incidentally, the side had Sourav Ganguly in the line-up. Whereas, the present side is even without the regular skipper Deep Dasgupta, serving a two-match ban at the moment. 

To counter the emergency after Dasgupta was banned, Bengal thinktank has decided to send Rohan Gavaskar to open the innings with Subhamoy Das. Rohan will open innings with Subhamoy making it a left-right combination at the top, stand-in skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla told The Telegraph. 

Form-wise, too, Assam are on a high, having beaten hosts Orissa by five wickets the other day. Skipper J. Arun Kumar, who made 157 against Orissa, can give a sleepless night to Bengal. But as the Bengal team member said, Every team is a good side in One dayers 

Bengal will bank on their pace battery, which will see Shib Shankar Paul making a comeback after the prolonged injury lay-off, which cost him the whole of Ranji Trophy this season. Ranadeb Bose, having claimed 57 wickets in the just concluded four-day format, will hope to carry on his good form to the one-dayers. Shukla will do the part-time role as Sourav Sarkar may have to sit out in the two-plus-two pace-spin combination. The spin department will be looked after by Sourashish Lahiri (off-spinner) and Shiv Sagar Singh (left arm orthodox). 

Expressing confidence on Paul, skipper Shukla said: Hes totally fit I think hes going to deliver tomorrow. Shukla, though, added that they are missing Deep in their start-up tie. 

Shukla said the wicket appears to be a dry strip and might assist spin later on but reminds that Assam did chase 253 the other day.

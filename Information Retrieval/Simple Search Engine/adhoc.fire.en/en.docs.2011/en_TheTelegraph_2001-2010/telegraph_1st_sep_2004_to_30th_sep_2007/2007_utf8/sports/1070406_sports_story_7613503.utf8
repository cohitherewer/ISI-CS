The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 BCCI unlikely to seek players views

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) may just ask Greg Chappell to have a rethink on not wanting to seek an extension, but if the script unfolds the expected way, then theres little chance of players having any say in his successors appointment. 

Even if it wasnt officially done, the BCCI did take the views of some seniors before Chappell got the coachs job 23 months ago. Its another matter that a few favoured somebody like Tom Moody. 

Right now, there are no such plans... Be it a committee or whatever, the BCCI alone will decide once its clear that were through with Chappell... We dont have to be so democratic, a well-placed source told The Telegraph. 

Its possible that this stand could change, but the current bottomline is that the BCCI isnt too happy with the players. 

But, then, the BCCI also realises they must not be pushed around. Certainly not at a time when Subhash Chandra has gone public with plans for an Indian Cricket League. 

Its a tricky time for Sharad Pawar and his men.

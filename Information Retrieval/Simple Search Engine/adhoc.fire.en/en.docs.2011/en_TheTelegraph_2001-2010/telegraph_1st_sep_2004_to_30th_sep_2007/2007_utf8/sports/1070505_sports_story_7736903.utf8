The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Cup tired us out, too: Dar

 Aleem Dar 

Karachi: Players were not the only ones tired and bored of the long-drawn cricket World Cup, umpires were left equally exhausted by the tournaments length, said Pakistani umpire Aleem Dar. 

Dar, who stood in the final of the mega event, felt the World Cup was pretty well-organised but was too long. 

It was a bit too long and in the end it tired out the players and umpires. I think the World Cup should be of shorter duration, Dar said. 

Dar and fellow-umpire Steve Bucknor were at the centre of a rain-affected chaotic final which saw Australia clinch their third successive title in near-darkness. 

Dar said the confusion did not occur because of on-field officials. I think there was a miscommunication and we acted on instructions from outside. But the feeling was that the match had to be completed on the reserve day but the captains told us this is the rule. 

Defending his fellow umpires and officials, Dar said they were also human beings and could make mistakes. 

At times mistakes do happen. The ICC and match officials have done the right thing apologising for the mistake made in the final, Dar, who has umpired 37 Tests and 88 ODIs, said. 

Speaking about his experience of officiating in the finals, Dar said he was overwhelmed after being chosen for the summit clash. 

It is every umpires ambition to supervise the World Cup final. When I learnt I was to stand in the final it was a dream come true for me. It is also a big honour for Pakistan.

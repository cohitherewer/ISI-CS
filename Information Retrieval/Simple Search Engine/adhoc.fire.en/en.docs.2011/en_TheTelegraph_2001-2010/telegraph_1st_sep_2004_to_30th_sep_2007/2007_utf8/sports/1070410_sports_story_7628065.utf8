 England batsmen lost the plot

Antigua has proved infertile in terms of Super Eight points for England. They lost their second match here when Australia beat them by seven wickets with 16 balls to spare. Kevin Pietersen made 104, but Ricky Ponting ensured his teams unbeaten run in the competition with a captains knock of 86. 

The defeat leaves England in fifth place in the Super Eight table, above Ireland on points and above the West Indies and Bangladesh the other teams with two points on run-rate. Bangladeshs win over South Africa allows every team except Ireland a chance to make the semi-finals. 

England may have sprung a surprise had they scored the total that looked likely after Pietersen and Ian Bell had added 140 for the third wicket. Working on the old adage that teams batting first should double their 30-over score, provided they have wickets in hand (England were 164 for three on Sunday), they were on course for 320-plus, until they lost their way in the last 20 overs. 

Australia always looked in control, at least once Ponting and Michael Clarke had soaked up the middle overs with some cagey batting. Clarke finished unbeaten o1n 55 while Andrew Symonds hastened the games conclusion with a brutal 28, which included the winning runs. 

A small wobble, after Ponting was run out in the 41st over, threatened to bring some late pressure but Pietersens attempted catch at long-on, as Symonds tried to hit Paul Collingwood for six, was ruled invalid after the fielder threw the ball away as he stepped over the boundary rope. Although there was some confusion, the relevant law states that the fielder must be in control of the ball and himself for the catch to be valid. Pietersen could claim the first but not the second, though his nifty pirouette did save four runs. 

To have any chance of defending their total, England needed early wickets. Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist were the form openers of the tournament, something England could only envy after another faltering start to their innings. 

The Australians set off in fine style this time too, though Englands opening bowlers will argue that both should have been lbw in the opening two overs. 

Those blips aside, the pair looked in control, adding 57 before Gilchrist checked a flat-batted shot against Andrew Flintoff to Collingwood at backward point. Although needed, the breakthrough failed to staunch the flow of runs from Hayden, the tournaments leading scorer with 436. 

Haydens departure forced a change of tack from Ponting and Clarke, who decided to tick the score along without resorting to risk. Ponting reached a well-crafted fifty with a brace of fours off Sajid Mahmood, who introduced enough waywardness and pace for the batsmen to hit boundaries. But if that was not enough relief, Australias cause was further helped when umpire Billy Bowden changed the discoloured soft ball for a harder, whiter one in the 34th over. 

There appeared no such trouble when England batted. Pietersens century, his first for just over two years, was the highlight of the innings. But the total should have been much better after Vaughan chose to bat first on a true pitch. Pietersen needed some luck to reach the milestone, being dropped on 50 and 63. 

England looked set for a big score until Bell was out in the third powerplay, a tame dismissal as he sliced Glenn McGrath to cover. England never really recovered, hindered by Flintoffs painful, 19-ball stay for four runs. 

England went sideways, scoring 12 runs in five overs until Flintoff beached himself down the pitch against Brad Hogg to be stumped.

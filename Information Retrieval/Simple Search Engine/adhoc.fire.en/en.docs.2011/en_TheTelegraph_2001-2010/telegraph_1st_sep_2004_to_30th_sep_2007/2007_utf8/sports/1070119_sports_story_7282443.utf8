The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I didnt pay any fine: Dhoni

 - Black film is needed to ensure I dont get mobbed even while driving 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni 

Nagpur: Team India wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni has clarified that he didnt pay a fine for driving around in home town Ranchi with tinted glasses on his Pajero. 

I was stopped thrice that day (January 9), but not once did I have to pay Rs 90 as was reported across the Media... I didnt have to as I was carrying a letter from the DC (K.K. Soan) which stated I could retain the black film till the administration decided on my request for status quo, Dhoni told The Telegraph. 

Dhoni has made the request on grounds of privacy. I wont be able to go anywhere with normal glasses... That black film is needed to ensure I dont get mobbed even while driving... There are good reasons for wanting an exemption and I hope the administration will consider it favourably... 

Jharkhands first India cricketer is more than an icon there and even a visit to the saloon leads to pandemonium. Actually, when Dhoni moves, Ranchi comes to a standstill. 

Dhoni, however, confirmed elder brother Narendra had been fined last month for driving the familys Scorpio with tinted glasses.

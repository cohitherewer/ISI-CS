Sydney: England were just 12 runs in front of Australia with five wickets left in their second innings as the spectre of an Ashes whitewash loomed large in the fifth cricket Test in Sydney Thursday. 

Shane Warne was the man again, topscoring with the bat and then grabbing the big wicket of skipper Andrew Flintoff just before stumps. 

The tourists let slip another opportunity as the Australians surged to a 102-run innings lead and then bowled themselves into a winning position by the end of the third day. 

At the close, England were 114 for five and facing likely defeat on Friday on fourth day with remaining batting hope Kevin Pietersen batting on 29 and Monty Panesar yet to score. 

England were sickened minutes before stumps when Flintoff was stumped off Warne after adjudication by the video umpire in a tight decision. 

Warne blasted 71 off 65 balls as Australia gorged on 205 runs on the third day after resuming from an overnight 188 for four to finish on 393 and again frustrate Englands efforts. 

Warne was rapturously acclaimed after he crashed nine fours and two sixes to lift Australia into a powerful position to complete the first Ashes series whitewash in 86 years. 

Warne had immediately declared his intentions with a four and a six over mid-wicket off Panesar and looked at one stage as though he might achieve his Test century.

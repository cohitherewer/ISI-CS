The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pandove unlikely to go as World Cup manager 

 - Players will be consulted before appointing assistant manager: Shah 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: The senior national selectors dont have to contend with the non-availability of any of the 15 players they intend sending to the World Cup in fact, unless Dilip Vengsarkar and his colleagues are compelled to effect a change, everything points to the 15 currently in town being the ones to head for the West Indies as well. 

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), though, may have to look for a replacement for joint-secretary Mohinder Pandove, its first choice for the Team India managership. 

Im 99 per cent sure of not going Being away for two months at a stretch is a bit too much, the Patiala-based Pandove told The Telegraph. 

While the joint-secretaryship is an honorary job, Pandove is a government servant and a member of Punjabs Public Service Commission. 

The Commission will soon be conducting interviews and, so, I cant be away for two months Seniors in the BCCI have, of course, been requesting me to travel with the team, Pandove added. 

The Indians are to depart on February 28. If they go the distance, then the final is almost two months later, on April 27. 

If a replacement is to be named, then thats going to be done during Wednesdays working committee meeting in New Delhi. 

That meeting, one understands, will in any case decide on who goes as assistant manager. 

Secretary Niranjan Shah revealed that the players would be consulted, but somebody else in the BCCI informed that a move was afoot to appoint somebody professionally. 

If true, thats going to be a small step forward. 

Ideally, the manager should be appointed professionally, but that would eliminate the patronage extended by the Ruling Group within the BCCI. 

The managership, after all, is either given to loyalists or to fence-sitters in the hope that they remember the favour when it comes to election-time. 

Apparently, captain Rahul Dravid and coach Greg Chappell recently complained that working with a new manager in every series (sometimes, even two!) was affecting their own work. 

Chappell favoured a full-time manager soon after taking over. He hasnt had one for 21 months. 

But, then, John Wright didnt have one throughout his four-and-half year tenure!

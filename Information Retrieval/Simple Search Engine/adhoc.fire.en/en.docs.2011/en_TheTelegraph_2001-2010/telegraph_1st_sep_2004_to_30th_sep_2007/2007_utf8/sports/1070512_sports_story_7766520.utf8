 Randhawa in lead

Gurgaon: Jyoti Randhawa stamped his class on the DLF Golf and Country Club course, firing an eight-under 64 to jump to a five-stroke lead after Round II of the Rs 65 lakh DLF Masters on Friday. 

Normalcy was restored after minor surprises on the first day when journeyman Ranjit Singh had usurped the top position on the leaderboard. The 31-year-old Chandigarh pro, who was on cloud nine after shooting a six-under in the opening round, hit the earth with a thud, carding two-over 74 to slip to third place. 

On the other hand, Randhawa, only two strokes behind Ranjit at the start of the day, showed his mastery of the course by sinking in nine birdies against just one bogey. 

That small blemish saw him miss by one stroke the course record, which stands in the name of Rodrigo Cuello of Argentina set on the first day of the 2000 Hero Honda Masters. 

Australian Richard Backwell maintained his form with a two-under 70 and seemed to have retained his second position before Gaurav Dhiwan went ahead of him with a fine 68 for an overall seven-under. (PTI)

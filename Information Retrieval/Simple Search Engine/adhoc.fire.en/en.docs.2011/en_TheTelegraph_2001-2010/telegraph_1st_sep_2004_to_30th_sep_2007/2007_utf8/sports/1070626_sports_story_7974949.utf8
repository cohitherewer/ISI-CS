 Vandort, Mahela add to agony

 - Bangladesh shot out for 89 as Murali takes 5/15

 Mahela Jayawardene after reaching his half-century in Colombo on Monday 

Colombo: Captain Mahela Jayawardene became the second highest run-scorer in Sri Lankas history, putting his team in total control after the opening day of the first Test against Bangladesh on Monday. 

Spinner Muttiah Muralidharan took five for 15 as Bangladesh were skittled for a paltry 89 before Sri Lanka reached the close on 227 for three in reply. 

Jayawardene was forced to retire hurt on 93 with a calf strain but not before he had passed Aravinda de Silva (6,365) to become the second most prolific run-scorer in Sri Lankas Test history after Sanath Jayasuriya (6,791). 

The home side had slumped to 14 for two after paceman Shahadat Hossain removed debutant Malinda Warnapura for a first-ball duck and Kumar Sangakkara for six in a fiery new-ball burst. 

Warnapura was trapped lbw by a vicious inswinger while Sangakkara edged an attempted pull and was caught behind. 

But Jayawardene joined forces with opener Michael Vandort (87 batting) to repair the damage. Vandort played the anchor role to perfection after winning a call-up in the absence of Marvan Atapattu, who opted out of the series for personal reasons, and the injured Upul Tharanga. 

The tall left-hander put on 170 with Jayawardene and another unbroken 40 with Tillakaratne Dilshan (27 not out) after Abdur Razzak had dismissed Chamara Silva for one. 

Earlier, Muralidharans five-wicket haul took him to 679 in Tests, only 29 behind Shane Warnes world record tally. 

The spinner was given valuable assistance by fast bowler Dilhara Fernando, who claimed three for 33 after Bangladesh were put in to bat. 

Shakib Al Hasan top-scored with 16 before being trapped leg before by Muralidharan. 

The total of 89 was the third lowest in Bangladeshs Test history. The Test at the Sinhalese Sports Club is the first in a three-match series.

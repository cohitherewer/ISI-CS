 Dont write us off, says Wright

Kingston: Former New Zealand captain John Wright believes it would be a mistake to write off the Black Caps despite their crushing defeat by Australia. 

Stephen Flemings men suffered a 215-run ignominious defeat to the defending champions in their last Super Eight match on Friday. 

It was the worst possible way to prepare for Tuesdays semi-final against Sri Lanka, a side they also lost to by six wickets in the Super Eight stage. 

Dont write the Black Caps off yet in this World Cup. They are a resolute lot and know how to bounce back. Sri Lanka will find them a handful at Sabina Park, Wright, a former New Zealand captain, said on Monday. 

But the former Team India coach feels there are still areas of concern for Fleming and those were highlighted when the marauding Aussies plundered 348 for six on Friday in Grenada. 

Scraping through to 133 (in reply) is an embarrassing performance and not the game you want going into the semi-final of the World Cup, said Wright. 

It wasnt a pretty dress rehearsal. New Zealand will have to sort out very quickly who will partner Shane Bond (who missed the Australia game through injury) when he returns. 

Fleming will be demanding an improvement in the performance of the bowling unit. Jeetan Patel continues to impress and appears to want to bowl anytime to anyone, Wright wrote in his column in a website. 

In the middle overs, he, in tandem with Daniel Vettori and Scott Styris, slowed the tempo for a while. At 257 for five and Andrew Symonds gone, the Black Caps may have raised their hopes, but Shane Watson, who bludgeoned 65 off 32 balls, exposed the pretty insipid bowling. 

Watsons power was impressive. He mixed it up with clever improvising and his time in the middle along with Mike Hussey would have pleased the Australian camp. 

Before the match, Ricky Ponting had said his team was excited about the rest of the World Cup, and they were looking to play even better cricket. The team performance walked Pontings talk, added Wright. 

New Zealand recently had successfully chased over 300 to beat Australia. But with Jacob Oram out and the wicket slowing and taking turn it proved too much.

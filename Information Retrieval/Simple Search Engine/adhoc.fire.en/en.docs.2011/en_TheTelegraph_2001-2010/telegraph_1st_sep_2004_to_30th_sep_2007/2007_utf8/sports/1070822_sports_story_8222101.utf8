 Our defence remains unbeaten: Houghton

New Delhi: After two back to back victories in the Nehru Cup, that too without conceding a goal, there is no denying that Bob Houghtons men appear to be a tremendously improved lot in the last couple of months. 

At the same time, there is a strong feeling around that Indians still have miles to go before they could really aim to take the centre stage. Seven goals in two matches, regardless of the opposition, is a highly commendable achievement but it could still not be enough to earn a ticket to the Nehru Cup final. 

None in the Indian camp was ready to accept that Bangladeshs 0-1 loss on Monday was actually a victory for discarded national coach Syed Nayeemuddin. 

I dont know why some people felt we didnt play well, said Indian captain Bhaichung Bhutia. We created much more chances than they did. With little luck, we could have won the match by at least three goals. 

Houghton echoed similar sentiments, though he looked a worried man during the course of the match. So much so, that the referee had to once caution him for crossing his limits in the technical area. 

I dont accept that we played badly, said Houghton. I always like to look at the positive side of things. We havent lost even once in six matches since the tour of Portugal. In the Nehru Cup here, we have scored seven goals. Our defence remains unbeaten. 

Despite Houghtons firm assurances, one is not sure how long India can maintain this status. 

To add to Indias woes, Deepak Mondal has been ruled out for the next match against Syria, which could be the key encounter for Indias road to final. 

Mondal, who injured his left knee early in the second-half against Bangladesh, has undergone an MRI scan on Tuesday morning. Though the result is still awaited, there is a strong apprehension that he might not take any further part in the tournament. 

The only silverlining is that midfielder N.P. Pradeep, who was injured in the match against Cambodia, is likely to get fit for the Syria match on Thursday. 

Pradeeps replacement, Mehrajuddin Wadoo had a highly forgettable outing against Bangladesh. Even most of the Indian players, who watched the video recording of the match on Tuesday morning, agreed that Wadoos ineffective game was largely responsible for Indian defence being troubled by Bangladesh so often. 

Houghton, however, remained unperturbed. While Nayeemuddin made his wards go through yet another hard practice session under lights in a local school, Houghton granted a day of rest for his boys. 

On Wednesday morning, the British coach is expected to sit with his boys to analyse the Bangladesh match. The team will go for the training session in the evening.

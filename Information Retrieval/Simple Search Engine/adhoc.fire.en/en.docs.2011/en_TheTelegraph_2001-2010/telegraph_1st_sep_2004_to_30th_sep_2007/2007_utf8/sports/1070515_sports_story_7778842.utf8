 Hamilton show goes on

RICK BROADBENT in BARCELONA

 Lewis Hamilton 

So how good is Lewis Hamilton? Is he already a world champion contender or will he follow the pitted road travelled by Jenson Button, whose most notable headlines this season have come courtesy of driving an eco-warrior car that looks like someone has thrown up on it after hammering the broccoli quiche? 

The proof is not so much in the pudding as in the dogs dinner of a first corner that effectively ended Fernando Alonsos prospects of delivering a win for 140,000 yearning Spaniards. 

Alonso gambled and lost. Meanwhile, Felipe Massa looked ahead to the next race and said Monaco was a lottery. Hamilton plugged into his default setting of flat-liner calm and said: I dont see it as a lottery. He still talks of living the dream and surpassing expectations, but the only flicker of boyishness came when he said he knew that he was leading the championship following his second pit stop. I had a good idea that Fernando was behind me, he smiled. 

Doing the maths also highlighted the practical side that is the key to Hamiltons ascent to the nascent star status. If you can keep your head while all around you are gouging great lumps out of each other and indulging in post-race hissy fits then you might well end up both a man and a champion. 

On Sunday, as his runners-up spot helped him become the youngest man to lead the standings since Bruce McLaren, Hamilton looked like a man who drives at 185mph but does not do risk. He was Steady Eddie with bells on. Of the first corner incident he shrugged and said: Nothing to do with me. He added that as long as the McLaren Mercedes remains reliable and he refrains from making mistakes, the results will continue to come; Alonsos claim that he is less worried about Hamilton than Ferrari is a telltale sign that he is worried. 

Alonso notwithstanding, the plaudits are coming thick and fast for Hamilton. Niki Lauda, John Surtees, et al have lined up to laud him. The cover of promising upstart has been blown and Hamilton is fast becoming the sporting hero of choice in a nation where England cannot beat Israel at football and Andrew Flintoff is lost at sea. 

Some cautionary tales to temper the hype. At one point it seemed a matter of time before David Coulthard, the last Briton to top the standings after the first race of the 2003 season in Australia, would become champion. In his first full season for Williams he w5on in Portugal and had five pole positions, but he always seemed to finish the season third, albeit he managed a distant second to Michael Schumacher in 2001. 

At that time Britains boy wonder was Button. He was in the points in only his second grand prix, but development problems at Benetton, mistakes and then his contract dispute with Williams meant it took him 113 races to stand on top of the podium. 

So far Hamilton seems bereft of the foibles of other prodigies and you sense that inside his athletes body there is a pipe and slippers man trying to get out and go pigeon racing. He is massively more mature than some of his contemporaries. 

Massas attempt to overtake Hamilton in Malaysia betrayed a lingering impetuosity, while the way Hamilton stole the march on Kimi Raikkonen at the start of that race evinced the Britons controlled aggression. Stay consistent. Dont make mistakes. He need only look to another motorsport to underscore his wisdom; very few people in motorcycling believe the Nicky Hayden, to be the best rider, but he is the world champion. 

What remains to be seen is how Hamilton copes when he is no longer the darling of the British media. He is blessed with the machinery that vents his talent. Nobody, it seems, can clip Hamiltons wings.

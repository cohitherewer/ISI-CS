 Dravid salutes Robin

-The ODI series is alive in England

A CORRESPONDENT 

 Sourav Ganguly at the Oval on Wednesday 

London: Rahul Dravid heaped praise on Robin Uthappa and said that the youngsters match-winning knock augured well for the future of Indian cricket. 

We were struggling, but Robin finished it off for us, said the jubilant captain after the two-wicket victory. 

Any 300-plus target is going to be a test, but there was enough belief in this team that we could get the score Some of the young boys came through well today. 

Robin hardly had any cricket in the series. Hes basically a top-order batsman, but he showed intelligence at No. 7. Thats why his showing is a good sign for Indian cricket, said the captain. 

Uthappa smashed an unbeaten 47 off 33 balls to help India draw level at 3-3. Lords will host the decider on Saturday. 

Dravid admitted his side still needs to improve, especially in bowling at the death. We gave away too many runs, the last 15 overs were particularly disappointing, he pointed out. 

Dravid was forced to turn to part-time spinner Yuvraj Singh for the final over a decision which could have cost his team dear as Dimitri Mascarenhas smashed five consecutive sixes to help England post 316 for six. 

When he (Yuvraj) gets hit for 30 in an over, you wonder a bit. We tried some different combinations here and it didnt work, said Dravid. 

We know we have to play better at Lords. We dont always want to be scoring 300 to win games, he maintained. 

England captain Paul Collingwood found a lot of positives in his sides fightback from 83 for four. The way we fought back after such a start... Owais Shah and (debutant) Luke Wright made it a great finish for us in the first half, he said.

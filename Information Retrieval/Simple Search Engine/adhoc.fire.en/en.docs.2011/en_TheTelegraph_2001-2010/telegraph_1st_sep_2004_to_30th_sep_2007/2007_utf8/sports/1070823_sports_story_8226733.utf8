 India A win tri-series

New Delhi: After the bowlers had done the spadework, Cheteshwar Pujara and Mohammed Kaif slammed unbeaten half centuries as India A pounded Sri Lanka A by nine wickets to win the triangular series in Nairobi, Kenya on Wednesday. 

After the bowlers had decimated the Lankan batting order for a meagre total of 165 in just 36.2 overs, the Indians lost the lone wicket of Praveen Kumar (26) before Pujara (68 not out) and skipper Kaif (59 not out) helped them romp home in the final. 

Pujara, who was adjudged Player-of-the-Match, was unbeaten on 68 off 77 balls that included five hits to the fence.

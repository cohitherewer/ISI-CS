 Well enjoy it: Flintoff

London: England cricketers are flying home with Andrew Flintoff holding a winners trophy. Shame its the wrong one. 

After timidly handing over the ashes by losing the Test series 0-5 to Australia, England ended the tour by winning a triangular one-day series with a game to spare and taking home the gleaming trophy. We knew we had it in us, it took a while to come out but we are very pleased we have done it and are going to enjoy it, Flintoff said before the players boarded the plane home. (AP)

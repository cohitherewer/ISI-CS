 Syria rout Cambodia, maintain clean slate

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Syria played at an easy pace, yet notched up a comfortable 5-1 victory over Cambodia in their concluding round robin match of the Nehru Cup at the Ambedkar Stadium here on Saturday. 

Syria, who were already in the final, finished their league engagements with 12 points from four matches, an all-win record. They now wait for either India or Kyrgyzstan, who face each other on Sunday. 

Star striker Maher Al Sayed, came after the breather and struck twice. 

Syria led 2-0 at the half time. While Mohammed Alzeno opened the scoring in the 25th minute with a solo run, Zyad Chaabo increased the tally 10 minutes later. 

In the second half, the sparse crowd were treated to some fine football by Maher Al Sayed, who scored the third and the fifth goal. Aatef Jenyat got the other goal in the 80th minute.

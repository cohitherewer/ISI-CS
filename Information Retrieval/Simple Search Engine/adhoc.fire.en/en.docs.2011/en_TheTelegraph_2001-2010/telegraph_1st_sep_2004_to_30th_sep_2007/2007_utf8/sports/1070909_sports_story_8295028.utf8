 Djokovic beats Ferrer, in final

 New York: Novak Djokovic outgunned Spaniard David Ferrer 6-4, 6-4, 6-3 on Saturday to become the first Serbian man to reach a Grand Slam final at the U.S. Open. 

The third seed struggled in the hot conditions but his greater power helped him win through to a final against either three-times defending champion Roger Federer or Russian fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko. 

Its an amazing achievement for me individually but also for my country. Im really proud to represent my country in the final, Djokovic told the crowd. 

I started really nervous. I had a lot of difficult matches, a lot of hours on the court and I had no energy, the conditions were extreme, it was so hot. 

Ferrer, in his first Grand Slam semi-final, broke Djokovic in the second game on his way to a 4-1 lead. 

But Djokovic, whose support group were lined up in three rows of the red, white and blue of the Serbia flag, bounced back to win five successive games to take the set. 

Djokovic was clearly suffering in the heat and called for the doctor early in the second set. 

For a moment, it looked as if Djokovic might have to retire, as he did in the Wimbledon semi-final against Rafael Nadal. 

Ferrer hit back from a break down to lead 3-2 but Djokovic recovered and broke in the seventh game on his way to winning the second set. 

With the Spaniard wilting in the sun, Djokovic then broke twice in the third set to clinch victory. 

I took some pills but they were all permitted, Djokovic said. 

I will try to recover as much as I can. Its going to be an amazing experience, my first Grand Slam final tomorrow (Sunday). 

Despite his defeat, Ferrer felt he had a lot of positives to take away from the tournament. 

En route to reaching his first major semi-final, he had beaten David Nalbandian, world No. 2 Nadal and 20th seed Juan Ignacio Chela. 

I didnt play bad, but not (as good as) against Rafa or Chela, he said. 

But that was because he plays good. I tried my best but he played better than me, he has more power and a better serve. When he plays good, I cant do anything. 

(But) this is my best tournament of my career, or my life.

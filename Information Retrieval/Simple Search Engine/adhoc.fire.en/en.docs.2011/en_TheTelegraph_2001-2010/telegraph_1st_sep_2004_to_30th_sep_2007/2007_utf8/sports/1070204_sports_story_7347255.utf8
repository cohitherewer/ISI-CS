 Gurbaaz in 4th spot

Manila: Gurbaaz Manns four-under 68 catapulted him to sole fourth place on Day III of the Philippines Open on Saturday with a three-under 213 aggregate. 

Local hero Frankie Minoza shot a five-under 67 for a nine-under 207 total and a one-stroke advantage over overnight leader Liang Wen-chong of China who struck a 71. 

Digvijay Singh, seventh overnight, carded a 75 for an even par 216 to be tied 10th. 

Uttam Singh Mundy (76) was lying 47th at five-over 221, while Arjun Singh (75) was eight-over 224 and tied 63rd. 

Mann, who pulled a muscle in the right leg in Pakistan and did not practice for five days, seemed to have recovered well. He moved up the leaderboard as he scored five birdies against a lone bogey.A late birdie on the 18th hole helped Thailands Prayad Marksaeng, who fired an eagle at the par five 14th hole, to move to lone third place after a 69. 

Minoza was on the charge as he closed the gap to Liang with birdies on the first, second, fourth and fifth holes. 

He birdied the seventh before a dropped shot on the eighth but kept the momentum going with his sixth birdie at the ninth hole.

 SAs chance to topple Aussies

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: South Africa can topple Australia at top of LG ICC ODI Championship for first time; India may fall as low as sixth as teams jockey for position, according to an ICC media release. 

As the World Cup approaches, just seven points separate third from seventh. South Africa can go top if they beat Pakistan in the fifth and final ODI in Johannesburg on Wednesday and New Zealand have a series win over Australia in the three-match Chappell-Hadlee Series that starts in Wellington on Friday. 

The Proteas currently lie just three ratings points behind Ricky Pontings side and can now arrest the ODI Championship shield from the Australians grasp for the first time since the current format of the rankings was introduced in 2002. 

Should South Africa beat Pakistan at the Wanderers they will move up to 128 points and if the Black Caps can win their series 3-0 or 2-1, Australia will drop to second for the first time. It has been a steady move upwards by South Africa in the past 12 months or so. 

STANDINGS 

1. Australia (130), 2. South Africa (127), 3. Pakistan (112), 4. Sri Lanka (110), 5. India (107), 6. New Zealand (107), 7. England (106), 8. West Indies (101), 9. Bangladesh (42), 10. Zimbabwe (22).

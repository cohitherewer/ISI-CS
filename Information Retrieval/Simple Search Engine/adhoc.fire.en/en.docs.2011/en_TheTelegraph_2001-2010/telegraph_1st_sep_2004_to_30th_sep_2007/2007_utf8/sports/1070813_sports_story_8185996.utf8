 Kamal serious about ICL offer

Karachi: Pakistan Test discard Asim Kamal admitted on Sunday that he was seriously considering the Indian Cricket League (ICL) offer. 

Yes, I have got an offer and it is a very good one. I have spoken to Inzamam-ul Haq about it and I am giving it serious thought because the money is very good, he said. 

Besides Kamal and former captain Inzamam, Mohammed Yousuf and Abdul Razzaq have also been approached by the ICL. 

While Inzamam has not been given any contract or retainership by the Pakistan Cricket Board, Kamal has been given a Rs 40,000 monthly retainer and Yousuf and Razzaq have been included in Category A of the central contracts but have not signed yet. 

Kamal has been constantly ignored by the selectors for all forms of the game since last playing a Test in early 2006. 

Younis Khan, meanwhile, has rejected a lucrative ICL offer. Younis told an Urdu newspaper Sunday I dont run after money. To me playing for my country is a bigger honour.

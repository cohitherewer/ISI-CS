The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Wicket was tough: Karthik

 - Eighth-wicket partnership was crucial, says captain Dravid 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: The Barabati wicket came in for much criticism on Wednesday. 

If the losing captain Chris Gayle rued that it was not the best of wickets, Dravid, even after notching a memorable 20-run win, conceded it was not an easy wicket to bat on. 

Man-of-the-Match Dinesh Karthik, having top-scored for India with 63, echoed the same sentiments. 

The wicket was pretty tough it was keeping low and the odd ball was doing a bit, Karthik told mediamen. However, he added that it was easy after settling down. 

I am happy with my approach as a batsman, he said. Asked whether he felt threatened from Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Karthik said: I dont think much about it. As long as we are putting up a winning combination, Im happy. 

So does he not miss the keeping? Karthik smiled, and added: I keep during practice. And I am getting used to the fielding, which Im enjoying. 

Perhaps confident that his slot will be unscathed in the selection committee announcement in Bhubaneswar on Thursday, he said: Playing in Chennai will be a dream come true. 

When we went to West Indies (last year) we lost 1-4, Dravid said. It is nice to return the compliment and win these tight games. 

About the turning points of the match, Dravid said due credit should be given to Karthik and Agarkars eighth-wicket partnership which gave the team enough confidence to defend. 

They took us near to 200 and it gave me confidence that we can defend on this wicket. 

There were so many turning points, though. Dwyane Smiths dismissal was crucial. Gautam Gambhir took good catches. Powar is bowling well considering that hes competing with two best spinners at the moment (Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble). In fact that gives us an option. 

Dravid however conceded that they were exploring an allrounder. At the moment Sachin is doing the job. But we are exploring a genuine pace bowling all-rounder. 

However we should not judge Joginder from this one-off match. It was not the ideal condition to judge him.

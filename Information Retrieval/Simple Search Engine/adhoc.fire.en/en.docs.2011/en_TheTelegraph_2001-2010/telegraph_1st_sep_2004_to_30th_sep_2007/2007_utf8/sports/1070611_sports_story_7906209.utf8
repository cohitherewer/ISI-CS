The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Cops to reveal 

 cause tomorrow

 Bob Woolmer death

 Kingston/Karachi: 

 Jamaica police have scheduled a news conference for Tuesday 

 to reveal former Pakistan cricket coach Bob Woolmers 

 cause of death, a police source said late on Saturday.

 According to the source, the news 

 conference will be addressed by police commissioner Lucius 

 Thomas, who will read a statement, outline toxicology results 

 and give details of post mortem examinations carried out 

 on Woolmers body.

 The former England international 

 cricketer was found unconscious in his Kingston hotel room 

 on March 18, a day after Pakistan had suffered a shock loss 

 to Ireland in the World Cup.

 Local police decided to instigate 

 a murder investigation into the Britons death following 

 a release of the autopsy report that stated he had been 

 strangled.

 However, a pathologist attached 

 to Britains Scotland Yard reported that Woolmer died 

 of natural causes, a claim made before by two Pakistan police 

 officers, who were in Kingston as part of the investigating 

 team.

 The Pakistan Cricket Board is 

 coming under increasing pressure to file for damages against 

 the Jamaica Police, once it is confirmed that Bob Woolmer 

 died of natural causes and was not murdered.

 Pervez Mir, Pakistan media manager 

 during the World Cup, said: We have been saying all 

 along that Woolmer was not murdered but the Jamaican police 

 handled the case poorly and inefficiently. (Agencies)

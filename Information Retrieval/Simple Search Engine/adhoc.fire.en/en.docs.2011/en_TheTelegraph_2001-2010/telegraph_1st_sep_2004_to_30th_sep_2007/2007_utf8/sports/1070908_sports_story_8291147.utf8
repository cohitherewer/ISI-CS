 Ponting to join squad

Johannesburg: Australia captain Ricky Ponting is to join his teammates in South Africa for the ICC World Twenty20 meet next week after his wife recovered from a health scare. 

The skippers participation in the inaugural International Cricket Council (ICC) event was in doubt after he stayed behind in Australia while the party left for the tournament on Monday. 

He said in Sydney on Friday that his decision had been due to his wifes health, which was now improving, and he would travel to South Africa in time for the ICCs annual awards dinner in Johannesburg on Monday. 

Fortunately Riannas health has improved over the last few days and Im hoping travel plans can be finalised as soon as possible, said Ponting, who has been nominated in four categories for the ICC awards. 

Im grateful for the support weve both had from Cricket Australia (CA) and my teammates. It made things easier here knowing the team was in such good hands. 

In South Africa, CA media manager Lachy Patterson said that allrounder Shane Watson would also arrive on Monday. 

Shane has recovered sufficiently from the hamstring injury he sustained training in Brisbane last Sunday to join the squad in South Africa. 

Paceman Stuart Clark arrived in the host country on Thursday after tending to his sick son. 

Australia have chosen virtually the same squad that won the 50-over World Cup in the Caribbean for the inaugural World Twenty20 championship, although leading wicket-taker Glenn McGrath has retired and was replaced by Brett Lee. 

Fast bowler Shaun Tait is another absentee, having pulled out after surgery to his right elbow, and has been replaced by Ben Hilfenhaus. 

The one-day world champions make their tournament bow against Zimbabwe in Cape Town on Wednesday.

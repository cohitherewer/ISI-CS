 Dalmiya hits out at BCCI

New Delhi: Training guns at BCCI top bosses, former president Jagmohan Dalmiya has questioned the boards decision not to encash the $70 million bank guarantee of Zee Telefilms when the deal went sour. 

Claiming that there is more than what meets the eye, Dalmiya said BCCI had lost a huge amount of money in the deal. 

The bank guarantee was in the possession of treasurer N. Srinivasan. That guarantee has lapsed. Zee has gone ahead and cancelled the contract. Who will answer for the Rs 250 crore that the BCCI has lost? We need to know who connived with whom and why, Dalmiya told a tabloid. (PTI)

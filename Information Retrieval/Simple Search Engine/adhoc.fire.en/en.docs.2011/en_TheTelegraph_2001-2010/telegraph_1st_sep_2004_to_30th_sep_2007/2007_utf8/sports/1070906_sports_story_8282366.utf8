 Lanka fancy Twenty20 title

Colombo: Sri Lanka have the resources to win the ICC World Twenty20 crown despite the absence of star off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan, their captain said on Wednesday before leaving for South Africa. 

According to Mahela Jayawardena, Sri Lanka the top limited-overs team in Asia and World Cup finalists in the Caribbean in April need to be at their best as the shortest form of the game allows very little margin for error. 

We cannot afford to do too many mistakes in this type of competition. It is 20 overs and you will not get a chance to make amends unlike in the 50-over game, he said. Sri Lanka also do not have much Twenty20 experience. (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Yuvraj will not train in Cuttack

 - Sessions in Nagpur a one-off affair: Prof. Shetty 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Lucknow: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has clarified that Yuvraj Singh wont be training with Team India in the lead-up to Wednesdays day-night ODI against the West Indies. 

Yuvraj did have three sessions in Nagpur, before the first ODI, but that was strictly a one-off We havent asked him to head for Bhubaneswar/Cuttack, BCCI chief administrative officer, Prof. Ratnakar Shetty, told The Telegraph. 

The left-hander, therefore, is going to stay put in his Gurgaon residence till hes either picked for the last two ODIs (Chennai and Vadodara) or the BCCI has a rethink on his training with Rahul Dravid and Co. The senior national selectors will choose the squad on Wednesday. 

Chairman Dilip Vengsarkar didnt reveal his cards. Contacted on Monday evening, he said: I havent yet been briefed about Yuvrajs fitness, so I cant say whether hes going to be picked 

Yuvraj injured his left knee almost three months ago and has been off major cricket since then. The sessions in Nagpur, of course, went off very well. 

Both Dravid and coach Greg Chappell have gone on record saying he needs to get his confidence back. Last week, they appeared satisfied with the other parameters. 

That, perhaps, is significant.

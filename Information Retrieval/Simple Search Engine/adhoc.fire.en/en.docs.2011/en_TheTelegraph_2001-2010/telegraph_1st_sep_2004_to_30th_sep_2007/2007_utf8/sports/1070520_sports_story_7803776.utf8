 Jyoti soars, 

Jeev falters

Adare Manor: Jyoti Randhawa leapfrogged to tied 17th and Shiv Kapur also made the cut in the Irish Open on Friday, but the door was slammed on Jeev Milkha Singh (as reported in Saturdays Late City edition). 

Randhawa (70) played some smart golf and putted very well in tough conditions to bring in one of the handful of sub-par cards to soar from his overnight 85th place. Kapur (74) rode on the wings of a final hole eagle to ensure his weekend presence. 

Nothing went right for Jeev, though. He struggled in the windy conditions as he stuttered to 82 after an opening round of 74. His total fell way behind the cut, which was applied at seven-over. 

Padraig Harrington emerged leader after carding the days best of four-under 68 to lead with a total of 141. He was followed by a pack of three Joakim Backstrom, Andres Romero and Simon Wakefield. 

Randhawas 70 was one of the 11 sub-par rounds in very demanding conditions. Randhawa started on the 10th and was on fire with five birdies on the stretch from 10th to 18th. He birdied 11th, 12th and 13th and added two more on 16th and 18th to turn in five-under 31. 

However, Randhawa got his act together to hit a birdie on the ninth to close at 70. He needed just 25 putts, though he found just four of the 14 fairways. 

Kapur, who was in danger of missing the cut after his first round of 77, had an eagle on his closing hole the ninth that helped him squeeze in.

 Gambhir, Karthik take India to a position of strength

 - TOUR OPENER vs SUSSEX

Hove: The Indian top order quickly slipped into the groove on the England tour as they came up with a strong batting display on the opening day of the warm-up match against Sussex County Club here Saturday. 

Helped by solid half-centuries from Dinesh Karthik (76), Gautam Gambhir (81) and skipper Rahul Dravid (57 batting), the Indians finished the day with a formidable first innings total of 281 for 3. 

V.V.S Laxman was at the other end on 37. 

The tourists lost a wicket in each session while scoring 69, 97 and 115 runs respectively in first, second and final sessions. Former Pakistani off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq was the most economical bowler for Sussex with one for 47 from 19 overs. 

Wasim Jaffer (7) was an early casualty in the innings, after Dravid called correctly and had little hesitation in batting first. 

However, Karthik and Gambhir batted confidently to share a 129-run for the second wicket before they both got out when looking well set for a hundred. That brought Dravid and Laxman together in the final session and the senior pros complimented each other well to press home the advantage on a good pitch. 

A few overs later, Jaffer played his first stroke of real authority when he cover drove Robert Martin-Jenkins to the fence. However, the bowler had his revenge in the 17th over of the day when the India total was on 37. 

Both Karthik and Gambhir matched each other stroke for stroke as they enjoyed the perfect batting conditions bright and sunny afternoon, a placid pitch and an attack that was at best friendly. Karthik took a heavy toll on Martin-Jenkins, hitting him for three fours in an over, in the process getting past his half-century. 

It took him 161 minutes and 115 balls and he hit seven fours while reaching the 50-mark. 

Karthik fell in the final over before tea when he was beaten by flight and turn, and was bowled by former Saqlain for 76 off 177 balls with 10 fours. 

Gambhir overcame his early circumspection and came into his own cutting forcefully and pulling powerfully. He was particularly severe on anything short or wide and he brought up his half-century with a couple on the on-side off Liddle. 

It took him 153 minutes and 91 balls and he struck four fours. 

Gambhir followed him to the pavilion soon after tea, when he tried to go over the top and offered a return catch to left-arm spinner Michael Yardy who was leading the side in the absence of Chris Adams. 

In the final session Dravid batted positively thriving on a dropped catch to pile on the agony for Sussex. 

He then became the third Indian batsmen to post a half-century, pulling Kirtley to the fence. 

At the other end, Laxman too stroked the ball beautifully to pierce the field with effortless ease. 

 India rested Sachin Tendulkar, 

 Sourav Ganguly and Zaheer Khan from the playing XI to try 

 out the likes of Gambhir and Bengal mediumpacer Ranadeb 

 Bose.

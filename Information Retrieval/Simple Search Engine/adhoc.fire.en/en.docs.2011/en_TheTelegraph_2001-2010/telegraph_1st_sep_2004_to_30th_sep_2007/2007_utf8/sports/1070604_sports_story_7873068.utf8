Paris: Justine Henin and Serena Williams lined up a grudge re-match at the French Open after they hurtled into the quarter finals on Sunday. 

Four years after Williams was booed off court following an acrimonious semi-final showdown with the Belgian, the duo will face each other across the net at Roland Garros for the first time since that day. 

Australian Open champion Williams was the first to book her place in the last eight, darting past Russian Dinara Safina 6-2, 6-3. 

Three hours later, Henin ousted Austrian Sybille Bammer in a ruthless 6-2, 6-4 exhibition. 

Roger Federers charge towards an elusive French Open title gathered momentum as he silenced roaring Russian Mikhail Youzhny 7-6, 6-4, 6-4. Next up for the world number one will be ninth seed Tommy Robredo. 

The Swiss maestro, who is bidding to become only the third man to win all four majors in a row, has now won a record-equalling 35 successive sets at grand slams dating back to his triumph at the 2006 US Open. 

Im focused on Roland Garros and I want to win my matches. If I can win in three sets so much the better but Im not looking for these types of records, was Federers verdict on drawing level with a feat achieved by John McEnroe in 1984. 

For once Federers majestic performance was not the talking point amongst Parisians. 

It was the forthcoming showdown between Henin and Williams that had tongues wagging. 

Williams was left an emotional wreck after her reign as champion was ended in 2003 by Henin and she went on to accuse the Belgian of lying and fabricating following a controversial point in the match. 

Despite the passage of time, some things can never be forgotten. 

I wasnt at fault in any way and I guess she was doing everything to win. Who knows? I dont know, said eighth seed Williams. 

With their roles now reversed, Williams is intent on loosening Henins two-year hold on the trophy. 

Shes played great tennis. At this point, I dont have anything to lose. I can only propel myself forward and thats how I look at every match, including her, she said. 

It was plain sailing for Henin until she lost her way at 0-4 in the second set, allowing Bammer, the first mother in the fourth round for seven years, to break twice and haul herself back to 4-4. 

I lost a little bit of intensity at that point and also she started to play better, said the world number one, bidding to emulate the hattrick of French titles won by Monica Seles from 1990 to 1992. 

I cant make that mistake again now we are going into the second week. But I had many positive things in my game today. 

Youzhny, on the other hand, knew he had nothing to lose when he stepped on to Centre Court with a 0-9 record against Federer. 

For 10 minutes, the Russian might have started daydreaming about pulling off the impossible as he sneaked into a 2-0 lead and extended it to 3-1. 

But Federer quickly brought Youzhny back down to earth to make it 3-3 and made sure the Russians feet never left the ground again. 

While Williams was the only American left standing out of the 10 who had entered the womens draw, Jelena Jankovic and Ana Ivanovic highlighted the changing boundaries in the global tennis map. 

They were the only Serbs to enter the field and remained on course for a final date. 

Before she can look that far ahead, Ivanovic will have to overcome 2006 runner-up Svetlana Kuznetsova. 

The Russian foiled Shahar Peers bid to become the first Israeli woman to reach the Paris quarter-finals with a brisk 6-4 6-3 victory. 

Fourth seed Jankovic ended French interest with a brutal 6-1 6-1 thrashing of Marion Bartoli and will take on Nicole Vaidisova. The Czech Vaidisova thrashed Tathiana Garbin of Italy 6-3, 6-1. 

Jankovic needed just 64 minutes to brush aside Bartoli, who had stunned former finalist Elena Dementieva of Russia in the previous round. 

Bartolis exit means there will be no French player in either draw in the quarter-finals for the first time since 1999.

 Ranadeb likely to be in XI versus Sussex

 Ranadeb Bose 

Hove: Fresh from their ODI series triumph over South Africa in Belfast, India will launch their gruelling tour of England with a four-day warm-up tie against County champions Sussex here on Saturday. 

The teams, however, will have to keep an eye on the quirky weather as it has been raining for the last few days. 

With hardly any cricket played for about a week since their series win, the Indians will be looking forward to field their best combination in the two warm-up games leading up to the first Test at Lords on July 19. 

Accordingly, Test regulars Anil Kumble, V.V.S. Laxman and Wasim Jaffer are almost certain to make the cut for the final XI. 

Among the batsmen, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Dinesh Karthik will try to be in shape ahead of the Test series. 

The Indian top order did well to get some runs under the belt against a decent South African attack in the Future Cup series and would be keen on continuing that impressive form. 

In the bowling department, Sreesanth has fully recovered from a bout of flu that ruled him out of the one-day series in Ireland, and he will share the new ball with Zaheer Khan. 

Captain Dravid will also be interested to see how new pace inclusion Ranadeb Bose performs in a match situation. 

The Bengal pacer had an extended nets session on Friday and in all probability, will feature in the playing XI. 

However, a final decision will only be taken before the toss. The presence of Pakistan players Mushtaq Ahmed, Saqlain Mushtaq and Rana Naved-ul Hasan in the rival ranks will add spice to the contest. 

Sussex have been well served by former Zimbabwe batsman Murray Goodwin and Richard Montogerie, both of whom have been in fine form. 

Michael Yardy, Andy Hodd and Carl Hopkinson are the others in the line-up that also includes two allrounders in Luke Wright and Robin Martin-Jenkins. Chris Liddle, Jason Lewry and James Kirtley form a decent pace attack.

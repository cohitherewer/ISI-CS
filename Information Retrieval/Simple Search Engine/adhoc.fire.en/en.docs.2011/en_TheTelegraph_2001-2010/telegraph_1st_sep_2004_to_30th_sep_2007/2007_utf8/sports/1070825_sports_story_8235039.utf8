 Chopra falters 

New York: Daniel Chopra is likely to miss the cut after his nightmarish opening round of 77 but Koreas K. J. Choi blasted seven-under 64 to grab the second spot at the Barclays. 

It was a highly forgettable round for Chopra, who dropped five bogeys and one double against the lone birdie on the 18th. 

In contrast, Choi smashed in eight birdies against a lone bogey as he trailed leader Rory Sabbatini by a single stroke.

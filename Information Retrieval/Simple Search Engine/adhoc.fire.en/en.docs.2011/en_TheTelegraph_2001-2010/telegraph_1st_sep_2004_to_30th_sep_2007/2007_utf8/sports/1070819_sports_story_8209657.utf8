Cincinnati: Leander Paes and his Czech partner Martin Damm moved into the mens doubles semi-finals at the Cincinnati Masters after their opponents retired midway through the match. 

The Indo-Czech duo advanced after fifth seeds Paul Hanley of Australia and Zimbabwean Kevin Ullyet withdrew while trailing 3-5 in the first set of the quarter-final tie of the $2,200,000 ATP event. 

The fourth-seeded Indo-Czech pair now faces the top-seeded Bryan Brothers, Bob and Mike, who ousted Mahesh Bhupathi and Jamie Murray. 

Bob and Mike defeated Julian Knowle and Simon Aspelin 7-6 (2), 6-4 in the quarters on Friday. 

In singles, top seed Roger Federer struggled to a 6-3, 3-6 6-2 victory over Spaniard Nicolas Almagro to reach the semi-finals (as reported in Saturdays Late City edition). 

The world No. 1 was unusually erratic as he dropped his first set of the week before recovering his poise to set up a clash with Lleyton Hewitt. 

Federer, looking for his 50th career title, broke in the sixth game but immediately dropped his serve before breaking for a second time to take the opening set. Almagro broke serve in the eighth game of the second set to level the match before an early break in the decider was enough to take Federer through. 

Hewitt produced a commanding performance to beat Carlos Moya 6-2, 6-4 and reach his fourth semi-final of the season. 

World No. 19 Moya had defeated fourth seed Novak Djokovic of Serbia earlier this week but the Spaniard made too many unforced errors against Hewitt. 

Nikolay Davydenko of Russia, the fifth seed, withstood a late fightback from 16th seed David Ferrer to beat the Spaniard 6-2, 6-4. 

James Blake, the ninth seed, had to battle to beat compatriot Sam Querrey 5-7, 6-4, 6-4 to reach only his second Masters semi-final. (Agencies)

 Team Bhupathi in semi-finals

 Bhupathi 

New Delhi: Mahesh Bhupathi and his Czech partner Radek Stepanek sailed into the semi-finals of euro 353,450 BMW Open, beating the German pair of Andreas Beck and Dominik Meffert 6-1, 7-5 in the quarter finals in Munich, Germany. 

The unseeded Indo-Czech pair will take on the German-Russian duo of Philipp Kohlschreiber and Mikhail Youzhny in the last-four. 

Kohlschreiber and Youzhny beat Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus and Jarkko Nieminin of Finland 1-6, 6-4, 10-5. 

Bhupathi and Stepanek made a blazing start and dropped just one game before clinching the opener but the local hopes made a spirited comeback in the next set and stretched the Indo-Czech pair to some extent. 

However, Bhupathi and Stepanek put their vast experience to good use and managed to quell the challenge to move into the next round. 

In the third round, the Indo-Czech duo had defeated benjamin Becker and Christopher Kas. (PTI)

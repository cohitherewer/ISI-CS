 Anti-climax for Kapur

 - Casey wins in dramatic finish

Abu Dhabi: It was a riveting finish, but Shiv Kapur was not in the frame. 

After one of the finest 54 holes he had put together on an European Tour event, he failed miserably in the final 18 and ended with his worst card of the week at three-over 75 to tumble from overnight second to tied 20th at the Abu Dhabi Open Golf Championships. 

Meanwhile, there was drama both behind and ahead of him. Paul Casey, playing one group ahead of Kapur turned in a seven-under, the best card on the final day despite a blemish, a three-putt bogey coming on the closing 18th. 

Behind Kapur in the last group was the European No.1 Padraig Harrington, who till Saturday night looked the likely winner, but it was his playing partners Miguel Angel Jimenez (68) and Peter Hanson (68), who gave the target set by Casey a chase, only to fall just short. 

Kapur, who had not bogeyed any of his last 40 holes till the end of the third day and birdied 10 of them, did not have a single birdie in his last 18. 

He hung in with pars on first four holes and then dropped a bogey on par-4 fifth and then another on par-5 eighth and turned in two-over. 

On the more difficult back nine with pins tougher than the previous three days, Kapur was once again scratching with his putter and had a bogey on the 17th, but no birdies for a final 75 that dropped him to nine-under 279. 

As for any positives from the tournament, Kapur said, there were little positives on the final day, but during the week I learnt many things. If I could put myself in a position like that so early in the week, its great.

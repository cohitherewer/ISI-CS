 Theres not a great deal more I can do: Hodge

Basseterre: Brad Hodge presented his case for a permanent place in the Australia team and underlined the strength of the World Cup squad with a maiden one-day International century against The Netherlands on Sunday. 

The quick-footed Hodge, who scored 97 and 99 not out in New Zealand this year, made 123 with seven sixes in Australias 358 for five. Australia won the group A match by 229 runs (as reported in Mondays Late City edition). 

If, as expected, Andrew Symonds is fit for Saturdays final group match against South Africa, Hodge may not now be the man to make way for the allrounder. 

When Symo is 100 per cent right and ready to come back its going to be a really tough decision that has to be made, captain Ricky Ponting told a news conference. 

Brads impressed everybody with the way he has played in the last few months... in New Zealand he played beautifully and he played beautifully again today. 

He bowled some handy overs against Scotland as well he gets around the field very well. Hes a very complete one-day player. Right at the moment, hes putting a great case forward to stay in the team. 

Hodge said the decision about the team to play the biggest match of the first round was out of his hands. 

Im really enjoying playing cricket at the moment, he said. Its something Ive enjoyed the whole summer and theres not a great deal more I can do personally. 

Its a simple recipe at the moment, I feel Im playing as good as I can ever play, its just an enjoyable time for me. Its a great personal milestone, especially after getting a couple of 90s.

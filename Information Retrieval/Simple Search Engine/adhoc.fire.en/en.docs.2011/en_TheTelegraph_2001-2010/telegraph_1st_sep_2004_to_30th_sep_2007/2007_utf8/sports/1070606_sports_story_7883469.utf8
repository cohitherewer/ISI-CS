 Kapur misses US Open berth

Walton Heath (England): Young Indian golfer Shiv Kapur fell short by two shots in his quest to earn a US Open berth when he totalled 141 at Surrey. 

Kapur shot rounds of 73 and 68, as the last of the nine qualifiers went through at 139 on Monday. Indias only representative will be Jeev Milkha Singh, who made it by virtue of his being second in the Japan Tour money list in 2006. 

As a total of 52 players teed off for nine spots at Oakmont (US), joint winners at eight-under were Nick Dougherty (66-70), Swede Peter Hanson (68-68) and South African Darren Fichardt (68-68). 

Northern Irelands Graeme McDowell, Australian Marcus Fraser and Argentinas Miguel Rodriguez finished one behind. 

Birminghams Sam Walker was sixth and the other two qualifiers were Dane Soren Kjeldsen and Frenchman Christian Cevaer. 

Among those missing out were Ryder Cup heroes Darren Clarke and Paul McGinley. 

Clarke, who has not made a halfway cut since early February, 75 and 72. McGinleys two 71s were not sufficient either. 

Jean van de Velde and Miguel Angel Jimenez, Ryder Cup teammates in 1999, were unsuccessful as well.

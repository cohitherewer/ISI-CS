 Managers may become a trend: Marsh

London: Former Australian wicketkeeper Rodney Marsh believes that the Indian teams temporary arrangement of having a manager as overall in-charge could well become the future trend in world cricket. 

Marsh also said having a support staff to help the players in specific areas was probably the way to go in the days ahead. 

Maybe its no bad thing, they have a manager and support staff, the 59-year-old Marsh said. 

It may be that we go more along the lines of the soccer set-up, where teams have a manager and coaches to assist the preparation of the team. 

John Buchanan and Duncan Fletcher did a lot of one-on-ones with coaches who prepared the players. Perhaps thats the way it will go.

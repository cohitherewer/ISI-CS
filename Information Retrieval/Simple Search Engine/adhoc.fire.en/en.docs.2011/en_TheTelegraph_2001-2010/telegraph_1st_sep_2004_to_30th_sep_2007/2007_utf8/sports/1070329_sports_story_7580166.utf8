 World Cup is too long: Ian Chappell 

Bridgetown: Former Australia captain Ian Chappell has called for the World Cup to be shortened. 

The marathon 2007 edition in the Caribbean lasts for almost seven weeks and features 16 teams. But Chappell believes it can be trimmed. 

I am quite happy with the globalisation of the game, but I really think the World Cup is running too long at the moment, Chappell was quoted as saying in a website. 

Lets take the eight major teams as they are. I would then like to see two teams qualify to make it 10 and then I would like to see those teams play each other once, so that everybody has played each other, he added. 

The team that goes on to win the World Cup would have played all the other teams once, no one will have missed out and the tournament will come to an end much faster. 

Chappell also thinks a shortened version would still involve the non-Test playing nations who, with the exception of Ireland, have been generally out of the depth here.

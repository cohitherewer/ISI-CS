 Lewis Hamilton doubts Alonso loyalty

KEVIN GARSIDE

Fuji: Lewis Hamilton ditched any pretence of entente cordiale at McLaren with a renewed attack on teammate Fernando Alonso. The bad feeling that has split the camp in the aftermath of the Formula One spying scandal erupted again in Fuji as the teams assembled ahead of Sundays Japanese Grand Prix. 

Hamilton questioned Alonsos integrity, and claimed that following the Spaniards refusal to travel to Paris to support McLaren at the World Council hearing where they were fined and disqualified from the constructors championship the team understood where loyalties lay. 

The pair are slugging it out for the world drivers championship, with only two points separating them going in to the remaining three races. 

Hamilton returned on Thursday to the subject of strong-arm tactics used by Alonso at the Belgian race, when he muscled the Briton off the circuit at the first corner. 

Ill be a lot more aware of him. I drive to keep the car on the track and be fair to everyone. If thats how aggressive he wants to be then I can be just as aggressive. Im not going to take silly risks. I just have to make sure Im ahead of him so it wont be an issue, he said. 

I feel I have nothing to lose. Hes the one defending the world championship. In the last few races he has done very well. He seems to be quite happy in himself all of a sudden. Ill speak to him this weekend about the situation. I have my feelings about what happened at the last race.

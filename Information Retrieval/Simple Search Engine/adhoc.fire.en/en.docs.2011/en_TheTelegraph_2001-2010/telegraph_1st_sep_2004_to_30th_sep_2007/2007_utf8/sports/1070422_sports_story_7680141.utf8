 Inquest halted after police chiefs plea

Jacqui Goddard

Plans to hold an inquest into the death of Bob Woolmer, the Pakistan coach murdered in Kingston, Jamaica, last month, have been shelved after police protested that the hearing posed the risk of tipping off his killer about potentially crucial evidence. 

The Justice Ministry of Jamaica, which has jurisdiction over coroners inquests, bowed to a request from Mark Shields, the Deputy Commissioner of Police, to postpone the opening of the hearing, scheduled for Monday, to stop information known only to him and his investigation team from being revealed prematurely. 

Making the evidence public could also prejudice any criminal trial and hinder his investigation, which he described as extremely complicated as it approaches its sixth week. I requested a postponement to protect evidence being spilt into the public domain too early, he said on Friday. 

Lawyers acting for the ICC, the sports world governing body, had also pressed for a delay to avoid the inquest creating an embarrassing sideshow to the World Cup in the Caribbean, with the semi-final between Sri Lanka and New Zealand being played in Kingston on Tuesday. 

Ministry officials, who held meetings late on Thursday with the coroner for Kingston and the Chief Justice, claimed that recent and significant developments believed to include the results of preliminary toxicology tests, which were received in Kingston a week ago had led to the decision. 

The coroner wishes that these new and significant developments be pursued with the utmost urgency, taking into account that the officer in charge has advised that these new developments are critical to the progress and the eventual results of the investigations themselves, the Ministry of Justice said in a statement. 

Woolmer was found dead in his hotel room in Kingston on March 18, the day after Pakistans defeat by Ireland. The cause of death was recorded as asphyxiation from manual strangulation, after a post mortem examination conducted shortly after his death, although preliminary toxicology results also suggest poisoning. More results are pending.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 EB optimistic vs CPT

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Edmilson Marques will be the lone foreigner for defending champions East Bengal when the red-and-golds open their CFL Premier Division campaign against Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) at home on Monday. 

The Brazilian will have either Ashim Biswas or Dipendu Biswas as his partner up front. The first match is always difficult But we have to make a winning start, Subrata Bhattacharya said on Sunday. 

Despite being the first team to start pre-season preparations, having had a long camp in Kalyani, the East Bengal coach is not fully satisfied with the team combination. 

The fans sky-high expectations make the local league a difficult proposition for the fancied teams, Bhattacharya felt. 

Playing in front of big crowds is not an easy task, said Bhattacharya, who didnt attend the Mohun Bagan Day function as he was not properly invited. 

Bhattacharya didnt reveal the starting XI, saying he hadnt finalised it. 

CPT, who have often troubled big teams in the past, have a young side under Tarun Dey. They made a winning start beating George Telegraph 2-1 on Saturday after their Thursday clash was abandoned. 

They have two Nigerians Mark Dennis Asam (Figo) and Henry in their ranks, but the latter will have to sit out Mondays game because of a double booking.

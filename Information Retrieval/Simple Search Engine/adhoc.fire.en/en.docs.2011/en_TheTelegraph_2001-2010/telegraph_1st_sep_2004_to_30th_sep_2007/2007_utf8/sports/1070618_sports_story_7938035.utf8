 Now, Justine eyes greener 

 pastures

 - Top players gear up for the 121st battle of Wimbledon

 Justine Henin 

Eastbourne: Four-time French Open winner Justine Henin begins her campaign to capture a first Wimbledon in the sedate surroundings of Eastbourne on Englands South Coast this week. 

The world number one will aim to defend her title on the lawns of Devonshire Park as well try and complete a Belgian triple at the traditional Wimbledon tune-up event. 

Now-retired Kim Clijsters claimed the honours in 2005, with Henin following on a year ago over Russias Anastasia Myskina. 

Joining Henin, who wrapped up a third consecutive French Open title last week, in the field, will be defending Wimbledon champion Amelie Mauresmo along with Russians Nadia Petrova and Elena Dementieva. 

The top four seeds earn first-round byes, giving the elite more time to switch their games from clay for the brief grasscourt campaign. 

Henin comes into the run-up to Wimbledon, where she lost the Grand Slam final in 2006 to Mauresmo, riding a wave of confidence. 

Im enjoying every moment, Im trying to build something pretty strong. Life is short, Im very happy, said the Belgian whose Roland Garros win over Ana Ivanovic was accompanied by an emotional reconciliation with her family after years of estrangement. 

Frances Mauresmo, playing the event for the fourth straight year, will need a reversal of form after a third-round Paris loss plus opening-match defeats at her last two Eastbourne appearances. 

Number three Petrova will test another injury after losing in the French open first round, as she makes her debut on the South Coast.

 Smith plays down drinking issue

South Africa captain Graeme Smith scoffed at suggestions

 that his team shared Englands drinking problems, despite

 news that he and several teammates were seen out drinking until the early hours

 of Sunday following their defeat to New Zealand in Grenada on Saturday. 

The players were reported to management but Smith said: If a couple of guys want to go and blow off steam after a game then I have no issue with that. Its a long tournament and theres plenty of pressure around, but the guys will be well prepared by the time the game comes around. 

We have drinking rules and if the guys have pushed those rules then that will be discussed and dealt with. We had two days between games to prepare and our rules say that we calm down two days before a game. 

Smith admitted he would have no problem at all if he was found to have crossed the line, and consequently faced disciplinary measures. He and his players were shopped in the same way as Andrew Flintoff after his pedalo binge in St Lucia by travelling supporters who felt they were not getting value for money from their national representatives. 

The South African boys had no right to be out that late, and to be that drunk, supporter Ernest van der Riet told a Johannesburg-based radio station. They had just lost a game badly and were facing what is probably the biggest one-day match of their careers against England barely two days later. 

A lot of us have saved up a lot of money to be here and to support the South African team. They were very drunk we left the bar at 4am and they were still there, an irate Van der Riet added. 

Smith, however, was unrepentant. Its tough at the moment, with the schedules, he said. Our team has probably been the quietest in the tournament, purely because of where we have been based. So to attack our guys for having one night of relaxation is not something Im going to do.

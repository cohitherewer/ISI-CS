 Border Medal for Ponting

Sydney: Australia captain Ricky Ponting was awarded the Allan Border Medal on Monday as the countrys best cricketer over the past year. 

Ponting won the countrys top individual award for the third time in the past four years to cap a memorable season in which he led Australia to a 5-0 Ashes whitewash over England and victory in the Champions Trophy. 

The 32-year-old was also named as Australias best Test and one-day player, completing a unique sweep of the major prizes after being recognised as the ICCs Player of the Year for 2006. 

To win all three awards tonight (Monday) has blown me away, Ponting said. Its been the best cricketing year of my life. 

Promising West Australia opener Chris Rogers was named as the leading player from the domestic interstate competition, while Tasmanian fast bowler Ben Hilfenhaus won the Young Cricketer of the Year award.

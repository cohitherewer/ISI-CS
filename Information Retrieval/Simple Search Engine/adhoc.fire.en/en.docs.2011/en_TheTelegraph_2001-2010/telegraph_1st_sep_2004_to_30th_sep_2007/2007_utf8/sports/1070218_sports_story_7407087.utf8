The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mission fulfilled, says Bhowmick

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Holding reigning champions to a draw and that too without conceding a goal, is definitely creditable. And, obviously, Subhas Bhowmicks boys seemed to be a happy bunch after their Round V goalless encounter of the National Football League against Mahindra United at Barasat Stadium on Saturday. 

Initially, our mission was not to lose and we did just that, even though there were a few chances in the first-half, Bhowmick said during his post-match media conference. Satisfied with the result, he boasted: Not even a single chance was created in the second-half. It needs intelligence to play out a draw against a team which boasts of many India players. 

Talking about the newly-recruits (Preston and Ndem), the coach added that the Liberian striker (Preston) will be an asset to the team if remains here. He is not like other foreign recruits he belongs to a different league altogether, Bhowmick said. 

However, he added that it will take some time to settle down.

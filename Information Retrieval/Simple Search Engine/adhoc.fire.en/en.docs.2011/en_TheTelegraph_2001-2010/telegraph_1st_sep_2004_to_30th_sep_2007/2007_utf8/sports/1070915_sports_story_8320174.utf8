The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Glory may cash in on form 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: In an eight-horse strong field, Steal The Glory, Secret Trooper and Monticello are the chief contenders for Saturday main event, the 1,400m Calcutta Colts Trial Stakes. However, going by his winter seasons performance, particularly his Indian Produce Stakes victory, the Daniel David-trainee Steal The Glory appears to have a solid edge over the rest. 

 The recent victory of the Conquering Hero-Winter Dreams son also suggest that he is in a rousing form and may land the monsoon Classic in the hands of the visiting jockey Imran Chisty.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

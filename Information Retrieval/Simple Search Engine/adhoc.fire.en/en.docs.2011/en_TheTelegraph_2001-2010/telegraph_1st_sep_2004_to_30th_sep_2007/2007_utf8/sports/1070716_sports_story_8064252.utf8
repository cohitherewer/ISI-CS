 Sampras in Hall of Fame 

Newport: American legend Pete Sampras, who captured a record 14 Grand Slam singles titles, was inducted into the International Tennis Hall Of Fame. 

The 35-year-old American headlined the class of 2007 which also featured Spains Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, a three-time winner at the French Open and Sven Davidson, the first Swedish player to win a Grand Slam title at Roland Garros in 1957. (AFP)

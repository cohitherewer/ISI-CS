 Dravid shows hint of form ahead of final Test 

 - Lanka end Day II at 112/1 after India declare at 238/5 

 Rahul Dravid remained unbeaten on 67 

Leicester: The Indian top-order had some useful batting practice ahead of the third Test with most of them spending some quality time in the middle on Day II of the three-day practice match against Sri Lanka A at Grace Road on Saturday. 

Replying to the Lankans first innings score of 266, India declared at 238 for five with captain Rahul Dravid showing a welcome return to runs with a well-compiled unbeaten 67. 

The third Test against England starts at The Oval on Thursday. India lead the series 1-0 after their seven wicket victory at Trent Bridge. 

Gautam Gambhir (67) and Wasim Jaffer (48) were the other notable contributors for India. 

In their second essay, Sri Lanka A were 112 for one. India tasted early success when paceman Ishant Sharma had M.L. Udawatte caught by V.V.S. Laxman for no score with just two runs on the board. 

However, Michael Vandort (61) and M. Perera (48) put on an unbeaten century partnership to deny Indians further success. 

Dravid was in prime form as he anchored the innings before declaring their first innings at tea. Yuvraj Singh remained unbeaten on 15. 

Resuming the day at 25 for 1, India were well served by opener Jaffer and Gambhir who put on 85 runs for the second wicket. 

Gambhir retired hurt soon after lunch on 67, and though Mahendra Singh Dhoni (0) and Laxman (14) were dismissed cheaply, Dravid looked in great touch as he took the attack to the bowlers under the blazing sun. 

The Indian captain cut, pulled and drove with great authority, having arrived at the crease just before lunch when Jaffer was out with the total on 105. 

He treated the spinners and pacers alike as he placed his shots between fielders and with lovely timing too. 

Jaffer was the only wicket to fall in the session, caught at mid-on by Akalanka Ganegama when he tried to go over the top. 

Gambhir survived an early chance and a few close shouts for leg before wicket before he found his touch. 

Jaffer by that time played some gorgeous drives on either sides of the wicket.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IFA seeks compromise formula 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: On Wednesday, when the executive committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) will meet in the capital to deliberate on the introduction of the Professional League, it can change the future of the Calcutta Football League (CFL). 

According to AIFF proposals, once the Professional League is introduced, the three top teams of Calcutta will not be allowed to play in the state league. At best they may field a reserve team which will rob the 114-year-old CFL much of its sheen. 

The IFA secretary Subrata Dutta and his Goa counterpart Savio Messias objected to the move in the last meeting, but given the brute majority the AIFF decision makers enjoy in the committee, IFA is likely to find itself cornered on this issue. 

Speaking to The Telegraph, Dutta said that he hopes to reach a compromise formula in the meeting. 

We have made it clear that we are not against the Pro League, but the AIFF should allow at least 60 per cent of the Pro League players to play in the state league. Otherwise, IFA may lose the backing of their existing sponsors, he feared.

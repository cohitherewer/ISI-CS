 Woolmer plot thickens

 - Now, Gillian says she does not rule out murder

IVO TENNANT 

Police investigating the death of Bob Woolmer, the Pakistan coach, have seized CCTV footage from the hotel in Jamaica where he was staying. Speculation about the final hours of the former England Test cricketer has reached frenzied levels since an inconclusive post-mortem examination prompted the announcement that his death was being treated as suspicious. 

There were even unconfirmed reports on Jamaican television that Woolmers death was caused by strangulation. 

The Pakistan coachs room on the twelfth floor at the Pegasus Hotel in Kingston, in which he was found unconscious and sprawled across the floor on Sunday, was still sealed off on Wednesday night as forensics experts hunted for clues. 

Sources close to the investigation confirmed that security tapes showing the area outside his room are being examined to determine who might have visited before he was discovered by a maid at about 10.45am on Sunday. 

There have been claims that Woolmer, 58, was murdered by match-fixers within hours of his teams defeat at the hands of Ireland, the biggest shock in the history of the World Cup. 

Pakistan cricket has an infamous association with illegal betting rings and among those fanning the flames on Wednesday was Sarfraz Nawaz, the former Pakistan bowler, who said: I surely feel that he has been bumped off. 

[Gillian Woolmer said on Thursday that she had not ruled out the possibility that her husband had been murdered. I suppose there is always the possibility, I mean some of the cricket fraternity fans are extremely volatile and passionate about the game and about what happens in it So I suppose there is always the possibility that it could be that (murder), she said in an interview to a television channel in the UK. 

It fills me with horror. I just cant believe that people would behave like that or that anyone would want to harm someone who has done such a great service to international cricket.] 

Jamaican police neither confirmed nor denied the reports, and Karl Angell, a spokesman, said: The official position remains the same that we cannot make any announcement until we receive the report of the pathologist. 

The Pakistan team and officials are still to learn whether they can leave Jamaica as scheduled at the weekend. Senior officers, including Mark Shields, the Jamaica deputy commissioner of police, spent Wednesday discussing the progress and direction of the investigation and the decision is likely to be made jointly with the coroner in Kingston. 

Woolmers family is also waiting for details of when his body will be flown back to his home in Cape Town. They are unable to plan his funeral until given clearance by the police.

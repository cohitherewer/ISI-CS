 Becks set to start in title decider 

Madrid: David Beckham trained with Real Madrid again Friday and is expected to start in the title-deciding match against Mallorca his final game before joining the Los Angeles Galaxy. 

The 32-year-old England midfielder appears to have recovered sufficiently from a sprained ankle to make coach Fabio Capellos starting line-up for Sundays league finale at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium. 

Real Madrid are tied with FC Barcelona atop the league standings with 73 points. Sevilla have 71 going into Sundays final round of games. 

Madrid will secure their record 30th league title and first in four seasons with a win, even if Barcelona beat last-place Gimnastic Tarragona since Madrid enjoy the head-to-head advantage. Madrid are undefeated in the 11 games since Fabio Capello reinstated Beckham to the line-up in February. 

Madrid wouldnt confirm whether Robinho and Mahamadou Diarra will team up with Beckham on Sunday, with both players facing national team pressures. 

Robinho trained with the team Friday but has still not been given the go-ahead by Brazil to play, despite reportedly being cleared by Fifa. Brazil wanted him for training ahead of the Copa America, which begins June 26. (AP)

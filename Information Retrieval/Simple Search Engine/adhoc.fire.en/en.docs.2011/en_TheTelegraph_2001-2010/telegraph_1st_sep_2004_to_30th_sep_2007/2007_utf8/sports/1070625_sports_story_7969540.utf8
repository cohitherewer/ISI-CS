 Atwal stumbles

Cromwell: Arjun Atwal slipped to the tied 55th spot after returning a topsy-turvy card of four-over 74 in the penultimate round of the Travelers Championship on US Tour. 

Atwal stumbled to five bogeys, a double bogey against three birdies to total three-over 213 after three rounds. 

Asian Tour player Kevin Na of Korea continued his rise after a 69 in tied 12th place. His 206 was seven strokes behind leader Jay Williamson. 

David Toms, who has five top 10 finishes this year, shares the lead at eight-under with Williamson (66).

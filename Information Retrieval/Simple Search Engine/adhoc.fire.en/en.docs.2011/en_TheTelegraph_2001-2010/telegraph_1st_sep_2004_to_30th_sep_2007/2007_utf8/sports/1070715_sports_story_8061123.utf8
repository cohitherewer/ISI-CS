 Flintoff aims to be back for ODIs

London: Forced out of the upcoming Test series against India owing to an ankle injury, England allrounder Andrew Flintoff is desperate to be back for the ODI series. 

In terms of dates, it is hard to say. I hope to play a part against India, but the one-dayers are a more realistic target, Flintoff was quoted as saying by a television channel. 

The impatience is starting now. Ive been back in the nets and Ive been hitting them all right, he added. 

The 29-year-old is recovering from a third right ankle surgery and is out of the Test series starting from Thursday at Lords. The seven-match ODI series starts at Hampshires Rose Bowl on August 21. 

Because Im running now, doing proper things and working towards something, I can see light at the end of the tunnel and I have a temptation to get impatient, he said. 

Flintoff, however, admitted that he was not in best of form, especially with the bat, before getting injured. But he was determined to regain top form on his return to action. 

During the winter there was a clear dip in form and I want to get it back, he said. 

The bowling was fine but I still think, no matter what I do with the ball, as a top-six batsman I will always get judged on the runs I score, he added. 

Though disappointed with the lean phase and injury breaks, Flintoff said he has enough time in his hand to make amends. 

For two or three years, I had things pretty much my own way, then I experienced the other side of it. But Im only 29 and I believe Ive got my best years in front of me. I can do it again, he said. (PTI)

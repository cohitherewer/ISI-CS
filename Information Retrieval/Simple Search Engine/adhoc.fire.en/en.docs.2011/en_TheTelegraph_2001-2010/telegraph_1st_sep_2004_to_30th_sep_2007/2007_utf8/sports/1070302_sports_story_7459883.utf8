Calcutta: IM Diwakar Prasad Singh continued to hog the limelight even as GM Darmen Sadvakasov of Kazakhstan and GM Tigran Petrosian of Armenia emerged as joint leaders with 4.5 points each on Day V of the Calcutta Open at Gorky Sadan on Thursday. 

Diwakar played his game under the glare of the media and, despite being a piece up, was held to a draw by G.N. Gopal. 

I am unable to give my best under so much pressure. Today I spoke to the AICF treasurer Bharat Singh Chouhan and vice-president Samir Salgaonkar. They told me to concentrate on my game and give my best. I dont know why the Chess Players Association of India (CPAI) is after me, Diwakar said after the match. 

I am also willing to undergo narco-analysis test to prove myself. Because of the controversy, I am facing some problems with my employers Southern Railway. I spoke to Dibyendu Barua, since I had played along with him earlier for Tata Steel. He assured me of all. 

The CPAI, meanwhile, has decided to wait for the AICF report on Diwakars issue. It is expected to come up for discussion at the AICF central council meeting on March 12. 

GM Abhijit Kunte, a CPAI official, said: We dont have anything against him as a person, but his games do cause suspicion. 

The 12-year-old national under-13 boys champion Vidit Gujarathi of Nasik played a rook and pawn end-game with precision against GM R.B. Ramesh to win in 58 moves in Slav defence. 

Vidit, who was coached by GM Alon Greenfeld for four days before coming to take part in the meet, said: I am not overjoyed after beating a GM for the first time. It is past and I want to concentrate on the future games. 

DAY V RESULTS Alon Greenfeld (4) drew with Serjei Tiviakov (4); Darmen Sadvakasov (4.5) bt Sundarajan Kidambi (3.5); Tigran Petrosian (4.5) bt Safin Shukhrat (3.5); Dimitri Komarov (3.5) drew with Tejas Bakre (3.5); G.N.Gopal (3.5) drew with Diwakar Prasad Singh (3.5); S.P.

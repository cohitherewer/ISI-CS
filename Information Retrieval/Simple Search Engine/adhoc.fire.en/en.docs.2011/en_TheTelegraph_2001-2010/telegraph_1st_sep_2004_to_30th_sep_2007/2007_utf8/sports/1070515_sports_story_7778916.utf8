The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Chance to prove worth as an administrator

 - Kapil Dev on becoming chairman of the Indian Cricket Leagues Executive Board 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Kapil Dev 

Calcutta: Zees Subhas Chandra has pulled off a coup by convincing Indias solitary World Cup-winning captain, Kapil Dev, to chair the Executive Board of the Indian Cricket League (ICL). He is, after all, chairman of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)-run National Cricket Academy. Indeed, now, there are bound to be red faces within the BCCI. 

Also on the Executive Board is former England captain Tony Greig, who played a leading role in the late Kerry Packers awesome WSC venture three decades ago. That, incidentally, changed cricket beyond recognition. 

Despite a tight schedule on Monday, Kapil found the time to return a call from The Telegraph and answered questions specific to the ICL, which was launched some five weeks back. 

The following are excerpts 

On the ICL being perceived as anti-BCCI 

But why are you looking at it that way? Is there any conflict between the Moin-ud-Dowlah and the BCCI? Has there been a conflict between the Sheesh Mahal tournament and the BCCI? Do they require the BCCIs sanction? Our league will provide an opportunity to so many youngsters Good performances are bound to be noticed... Theres going to be plenty of Twenty20, a form of cricket which is quickly gaining popularity. 

On whether the ICL will clash with the BCCIs showpiece events, the Ranji Trophy and the Duleep Trophy 

No... Thats not our idea... The schedule is going to be such that theres no conflict... We wont stop anybody from playing for his state and for India... We want to promote, not be an obstacle... I trust you will appreciate what weve set out to do and view this venture positively. 

On his being the Academy chairman from last September 

If the BCCI wants me to resign, then its another matter... I dont see a problem in holding positions in separate organisations... There or here, my goal is the same... In any case Im not employed by the BCCI. Isnt Kiran (More) an office-bearer of the Baroda Cricket Association and, thereby, a member of the BCCI? He, too, is on the ICLs Executive Board. 

On what made him join the ICL 

First, the desire to create more opportunities for our cricketers... Second, its a chance to prove my worth as an administrator. I know I wont get to head the BCCI, for Im not a member of the Haryana Cricket Association, the affiliated state unit to which I belong... The ICL gives me a platform. Let me add that only those whove played for the country can sit on the Executive Board. The ICL is for cricketers and is going to be run by them. This wont change. 

On the ICLs USP 

It will have top players from overseas... Surely, our cricketers are going to benefit when they play against, say, a Brian Lara or a Glenn McGrath. 

On whether he will have a hand in recruiting big names 

(Laughs) My job is to administer... There are others to take care of that and negotiations are underway. 

On the strong possibility of the state associations refusing use of grounds owned/managed by them 

Why should they do that? Ive already told you we arent in competition with the BCCI... We want to complement its activities and create a wider pool... As somebody who follows cricket, dont you think (Ashish) Nehra and (Lakshmipathy) Balaji, for example, deserve more opportunities to press for a comeback? Isnt it the job of administrators to take the game forward? If somebody wants to be an impediment, he mustnt be in any position of authority. Im quite clear about that. 

Finally, on the possibility of the BCCI introducing a clause in the players contracts forbidding association with private leagues 

If that does happen, its going to be most unfortunate... Why should players not get more opportunities? However, I remain confident that the BCCI wont take such steps.

 Shaharyar objects to Altaf presence

Karachi: Former PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan has objected to the presence of Saleem Altaf on the Performance Evaluation Committee (PEC) constituted to probe Pakistans dismal performance in the World Cup. 

In the first public spat between the two former officials, Shaharyar who has not appeared before the probe committee despite being called said that rather than posing the questions, Altaf should be answering them like the captain, coach and players. 

I do have certain reservations of principle, and not of personality, on the composition of the probe committee due to the presence of the former director, cricket operations (Altaf). The role of PCB is crucial in addressing the issue and rather than posing the questions, the director should have been answering them like the captain, coach and players, Shaharyar said. 

Shaharyar clarified through a press release that he had not refused to turn up before the probe committee, but informed them that he was busy the day he had been called. 

Shaharyar said he had, however, written to PEC head Ijaz Butt about what he felt about Pakistans early exit. 

Altaf said he didnt know why Shaharyar was objecting to Altafs presence on the probe committee. Explaining why Shaharyar had been called, Butt said the former chairman had issued a statement before that Inzamam-ul Haq and Bob Woolmer had problems. 

We want to find out from Shaharyar about these things because they may shed some light on an important aspect of the teams preparations for the World Cup, he said. (PTI)

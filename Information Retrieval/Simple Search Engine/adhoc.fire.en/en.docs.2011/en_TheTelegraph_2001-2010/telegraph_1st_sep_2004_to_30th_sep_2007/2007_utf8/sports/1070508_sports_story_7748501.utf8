 Bagan take on Tampines today

New Delhi: Calcutta giants Mohun Bagan take on group leaders Tampines Rovers of Singapore in an AFC Cup away encounter on Tuesday, with their hopes of progressing to the quarter-final stage hanging in the balance. 

Bagan, who have collected eight points from four group matches, are currently two behind the leaders as they gear up for the clash at the Tampines Stadium in Singapore. 

Mohun Bagan have won two of their previous group F encounters, with the remaining ending in draws. The match at the Salt Lake Stadium on March 6 ended goalless. 

The six group winners go through to the next round. The best second- place finisher among groups A, B and C will join them as will the best runner-up from groups D, E and F. 

The three-time National League champions end their group engagements with a game against Malaysias Pahang, who are yet to open their account. The last group match, in Calcutta on May 22, could provide a good opportunity for Bagan to collect vital points in their quest for a spot in the last eight. 

Bagan will, naturally, be looking to their star strikers, Bhaichung Bhutia and Jose Ramirez Barreto, to see them through. The duo has not been as prolific as expected due to a lack of proper service from the midfield. 

The other Indian representative in the competition, defending National League champions Mahindra United, are also in the running for a quarter final spot. They find themselves second in group E with nine points behind Singapore Armed Forces FC (SAF) on goal difference. They entertain the group leaders in Goa on Tuesday. 

The Mumbai brigade were cruising well with three straight wins until they lost to Happy Valley (Hong Kong) in their last match. A win for either on Tuesday will put them through to the next round. 

Mahindra will be without four key players. Daddy Mbaka and Yusif Yakubu are out due to double booking, while Mahesh Gawli and keeper Sandip Nandy are nursing injuries. (PTI)

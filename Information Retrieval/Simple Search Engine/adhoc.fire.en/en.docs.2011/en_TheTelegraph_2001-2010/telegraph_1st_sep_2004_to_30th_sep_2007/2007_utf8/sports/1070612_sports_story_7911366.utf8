 Beijing urges 

 Taipei to reconsider

 Torch Relay

 Hong 

 Kong: A Beijing Olympics official said on Monday that 

 its not too late for Chinese Taipei to change its 

 mind and let the Olympic torch be carried across the island.

 Chinese Taipei suddenly scuttled 

 plans in April to be part of the 137,000km-torch relay that 

 will cross five continents. 

 The move embarrassed Beijing officials, 

 who announced the route just two hours before the Taiwanese 

 backed out.

 The torch relay highlighted the 

 prickly relations between China and Taiwan, which split 

 amid civil war more than five decades ago.

 China wants Taiwan to unify, but 

 the tiny, democratic island has repeatedly refused.

 On Monday, Beijing Olympic official 

 Jiang Xiaoyu said at the Hong Kong foreign correspondents 

 club that its the wish of people on both sides for 

 the torch to pass over Taiwan. He urged Taiwans government 

 to reconsider.

 We always hope that the 

 Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee will be able to avoid political 

 disruption and come back to the consensus we have reached, 

 Jiang, executive vice president of the Beijing Olympic organising 

 committee, said

 The torch relay begins on March 

 25, 2008 in Greece, goes to Beijing, and then winds across 

 Asia, Europe, the Americas, Africa and then back to Asia 

 and China before the torch ignites the cauldron at the opening 

 ceremony on Aug 8 in Beijings 91,000-seat National 

 Stadium.

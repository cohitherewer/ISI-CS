 Venus, Davydenko make second round with ease

 - Rain plays spoilsport at Roland Garros on second day too 

Paris: It was a case of better late than never for Venus Williams and Nikolay Davydenko when the pair made the most of a short dry spell to rush into the second round of the French Open on Monday. 

Rain pelted down over Roland Garros for the second day running and Williams capitalised on the 90-minute window to overcome rising French prospect Alize Cornet 6-4, 6-3 while Davydenko demolished Italian Stefano Galvani 6-3, 6-1, 6-1. 

Williams had expected to face Cornet on Sunday, but instead twiddled her thumbs in the locker room as drizzle washed away most of the opening days schedule. 

After enduring a further three-hour delay on Monday, the American took out her frustration on her 17-year-old opponent. 

Playing in front of a smattering of fans, Williams survived four games going against the serve and took the first set with a stinging crosscourt winner. 

Cornet, ranked 118th in the world and without a title to her name, was not expected to pose much of a threat to the five-time Grand Slam champion. Once she lost a chance to go 3-2 up with a break in the second set, her hope of pulling off an upset evaporated into the grey clouds hanging over Centre Court. 

Davydenko wrapped up his win just in time after a stressful morning. 

As rain began to beat down on the red clay, the 117th-ranked Galvani tossed a forehand wide to hand the Russian victory. 

The Russian said he had faced a few jittery moments in the morning when he was stuck in traffic en route to Roland Garros and would have turned up late if his match had started as scheduled at 11 am (local time). 

I was nervous about being disqualified as I was going nowhere in the traffic. I was thinking, I dont have time to take shower, I dont have time to change clothes it was pretty tough. 

Li Na was also dreaming about outfits but her plans to go on a shopping spree in the worlds fashion capital proved to be a little premature after she racked up a 7-6, 6-0 win over Germanys Sandra Kloesel.

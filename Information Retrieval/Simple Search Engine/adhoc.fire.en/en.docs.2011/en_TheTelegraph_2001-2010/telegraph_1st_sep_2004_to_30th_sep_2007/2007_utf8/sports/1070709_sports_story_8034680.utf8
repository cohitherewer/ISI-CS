 I want some more, says Venus

 - In the end she was just too good... She is the world No. 1 on grass: Marion 

 JOHN BRANCH 

Marion Bartoli hit the ball to the corners, aiming her two-handed forehands and deceptively quick backhands as far from Venus Williams as the lines on the court would allow. But the court was too small for Bartoli to have a chance. The 6-foot-1 Venus, with a lunging stride and long arms, seemed to reach them all. 

In doing so Saturday, Venus won her fourth Wimbledon title, probably her unlikeliest, adding to the championships she won in 2000, 2001 and 2005. 

With a Center Court crowd pulling for an upset, or at least a close match, Venus never allowed the hope to settle in. Her 6-4, 6-1 victory over the 18th-seeded Bartoli came with the same relative ease that Venus had in her three preceding two-set matches, in which she knocked out No. 2 Maria Sharapova in the fourth round, No. 5 Svetlana Kuznetsova in the quarter finals and No. 6 Ana Ivanovic in the semi-finals. 

Those victories followed much tighter victories over unsung players in the first week. 

This win, its so much different from the others, because the other ones I felt like I was playing in championship form from Minute 1, said Venus, who has six Grand Slam titles. 

She became the first woman at Wimbledon to win the same prize money as the mens champion roughly $1.4 million. 

Seeded 23rd after a couple of injury-shortened seasons, Venus also became the lowest-seeded player to win the womens title a record that would have gone to Bartoli, had she won instead. But Venuss rsum and resurrected championship form made her an overwhelming favourite to beat Bartoli, who had never advanced as far as the quarter finals of a major until this one. 

Venuss performance further discombobulates the power structure in womens tennis. The Williams sisters Venus, 27, and Serena, 25 appear to still have the most talent, when they are healthy and hungry. 

Serena was unseeded in January when she won the Australian Open and ranks eighth. Venus entered Wimbledon ranked 31st, and will jump to No. 19. 

As long as were fit, we just have so much to give on the court, Venus said, before offering what was not intended to sound like a threat. Obviously, I feel fantastic. My sixth Slam. I want some more. 

Such expectations seemed a tad unrealistic two weeks ago, and it made Venus an unusual underdog in the tournament. She was the player with the best Wimbledon credentials, but also with some of the largest questions about her game. 

As near-daily rain interruptions set a frustrating pace to the tournament, and as some players expressed their impatience, Venus shrugged and smiled through it all. 

Rain is good for me, Venus said Thursday. I feel like I achieve clarity actually when it rains. The longer I have to sit and wait, the clearer my game becomes to me. 

Bartoli accepted the runner-up trophy, and received a more vociferous cheer than Venus did from a crowd enamoured with her spunk and unorthodox style. The scene overwhelmed her father and coach, Walter, who sat in his seat and cried. Richard Williams, Venuss father, turned and consoled him. 

Born in France but now living in Geneva, Bartoli, 22, dazzled fans in recent days with pluckiness and pinpoint accuracy. 

She lost the first set in her previous three victories, including the one against Justine Henin in the semi-finals by 6-1. Her two-handed strokes pounded the edges of the court, exhausting opponents as they chased the shots. 

My dad used to put up some targets, Bartoli said. If I touched the targets, I get candy. So I was very motivated. Maybe thats why Im still loving too much the candies. But whatever. 

The same drills, inside a gymnasium, taught her to play closer to the net. The court was squeezed by walls, making it impossible to play beyond the baseline. 

But Venus used her strength to keep Bartoli back, and Bartoli could not win a war of ground strokes. She occasionally put Venus on the run, but on several points, as the crowd began to cheer what it thought was a passing shot by Bartoli, Venus stretched and scooped a return. 

Her 124-mile-an-hour serve on match point struck Bartoli in the wrist, an appropriate conclusion to a match that Venus overwhelmed. 

Sometimes it was hurting my wrist so bad because the ball was coming so fast to me, Bartoli said. So I really try my best, I think, and I play a great match, but in the end she was just too good. 

Bartoli was asked about her recent run against highly ranked players. 

I think the world No. 1 on grass is Venus, said Bartoli, who beat the No. 1-ranked Henin in the semi-finals. 

Venus broke Bartolis serve in the matchs second game, then gave it back later in the set. But when Bartoli served with Venus leading by 5-4, Venus put away a backhand to secure the set. 

The second set felt more like a slow coronation for Williams, who became the fourth woman of the Open era, starting in 1968, to win four Wimbledon titles, joining Martina Navratilova (nine), Steffi Graf (seven) and Billie Jean King (six, two before the Open era). Navratilova and King watched from the royal box. 

Bartoli took a medical timeout to treat blisters after falling behind by 2-0 in the second set. Williams then took one, too, to treat a strained adductor muscle. As she had her upper thigh wrapped by a trainer, fans started a wave. Bartoli stood on the baseline and took part, raising her racket each time the wave passed. 

But it was Williams who got the final wave, holding the silver salver. It is sometimes called, quite appropriately and coincidentally, the Venus Rosewater Dish, and it found itself in familiar hands.

 East Bengal colts finish 18th 

Manchester: East Bengal under-15 players finished 18th in the Nike Manchester United Premier Cup in Carrington on Friday. 

Pitted against the better-built Central United players from New Zealand, the Calcutta side managed to keep it goalless in regulation time but went down 3-5 in penalty shootout. 

East Bengal colts had snapped the string of four defeats in a row with a 3-1 win against Bukit Jalil Sports School of Malaysia earlier on the day. 

The New Zealand side dominated the game and had more possession of the ball but the East Bengal defence did a smart job to foil the attacks during the 40-minute regulation time. We should have won the match, coach Swarup Das later rued. 

Asked what positives he derived from the tournament, Das said: I think the boys got a taste of things at this level. They have never been here and most of them are awe-struck. 

Strength and stamina are the two most vital aspects of the game and we lag way behind in this respect. 

Having three residential camps a year is just not enough. That can win you success at South East Asia level only. But to make a mark in world level, you need permanent residential academy. Anything less than this wont do, Das maintained.

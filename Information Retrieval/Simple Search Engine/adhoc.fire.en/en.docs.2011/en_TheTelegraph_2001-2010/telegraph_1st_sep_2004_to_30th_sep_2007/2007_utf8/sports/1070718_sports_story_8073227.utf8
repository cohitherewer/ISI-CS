 Jeev stays positive 

Carnoustie: For ace Indian golfer Jeev Milkha Singh, whos set to make his British Open debut this week, this is a great opportunity to make a mark at the worlds oldest tournament. 

Jeev, who teed off at the Majors by breaking into the top-50 last year, is excited about the prospect. 

Im always excited about the Majors. I want to treat it as any other tournament but its tough to do that. You always try your best and thats how I will take it, said the Indian, ranked 57th in the world. Im happy to be playing in the worlds oldest championship, where golf started from. 

However, I need to work on a few things with my driver. I was disappointed with my putting in Loch Lomond last week. I stroked it well but couldnt get the ball to the hole. After the US Open, I still kind of imagining that Im on those fast greens but Im not. Hopefully, this week everything will be fine. (PTI)

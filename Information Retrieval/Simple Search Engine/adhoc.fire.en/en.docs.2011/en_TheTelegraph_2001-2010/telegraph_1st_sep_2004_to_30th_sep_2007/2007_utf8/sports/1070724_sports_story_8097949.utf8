The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Peeved Pranab joins ICL

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Pranab Roy decided to be part of the Indian Cricket League (ICL) after being overlooked by his state association. 

I strongly feel that being a former Test opener from the state I didnt get my share of respect, but the keenness to be with the game forced me to join the ICL, the former national selector told The Telegraph on Monday. 

A member of Bengals Ranji Trophy winning squad was most peeved after being ignored for the coachs post this season. 

When I came to know about Parass (Mhambrey) resignation, I contacted the president (Prasun Mukherjee). He asked me to e-mail my application which I did, but there was no reply. When I rang him up after a few days he said he was busy. Seeing no other option I sent another letter to him, which met with the same fateOne fine morning I saw Bharat (Arun) had been appointed coach, Roy said. 

Roy is now looking forward to his new role of talent hunting and coaching for the ICL. 

I have nothing against anybody Having earned so much from cricket, its time now to give back something to the game. ICL has given me that opportunity and I will try my best, he said. 

Roy feels that that CAB hasnt used a player like Devang, who is surely one of the best five cricketers Bengal has ever produced. 

Even Dattatreya is a level III coach and should have been given more respect. They both should have been invited for the presentations at least, he felt. 

The 50-year-old hopes that the big league will take off shortly and the involvement of the likes of Kapil Dev, Brian Lara is bound to bring success.

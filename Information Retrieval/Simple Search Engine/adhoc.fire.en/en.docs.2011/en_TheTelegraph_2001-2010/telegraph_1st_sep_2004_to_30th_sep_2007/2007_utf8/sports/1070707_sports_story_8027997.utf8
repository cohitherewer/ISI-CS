The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Le Roux resigns 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Adrian le Roux resigned as fitness trainer of South Africa on Friday. 

Le Roux, who was also involved with Team India, will be returning to Bloemfontein where he will take up a position with a medical company, a Cricket South Africa (CSA) statement said. 

A number of factors lead to my resignation. Ive been touring with professional teams extensively over the last six years. This obviously affects your family life and it is now time to move closer to home and take on some new challenges, Le Roux, who was associated with South Africa for over four years, said in the statement. 

His last commitment to CSA was the just-ended tour in Ireland, where South Africa lost a three-match series to India. 

Gerald Majola, CSA CEO, said: Thankfully we will not lose his services completely as he will act as a consultant from time to time, including in the appointment of the new Proteas fitness trainer and in CSAs high performance programme.

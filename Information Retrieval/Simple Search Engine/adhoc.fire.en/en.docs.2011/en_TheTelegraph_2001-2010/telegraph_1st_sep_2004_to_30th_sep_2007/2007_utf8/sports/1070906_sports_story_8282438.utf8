 Pereira backs Houghton 

Ludhiana: Mohun Bagan coach Carlos Roberto Pereira backed Bob Houghtons plea for protecting countrys top players from hectic domestic schedules, saying India should concentrate on playing more international matches. 

Playing 50-60 domestic club games does not do much for development of the national side. They need to play more international matches, the Brazilian Pereira said. 

Last season, India played only three full internationals and Houghton said that was the main reason for their Fifa rankings sliding down to 165 at one stage. 

The ongoing season, however, has seen a fortnight-long preparatory camp followed by an exposure trip to Portugal and the five-nation Nehru Cup in New Delhi, which India lifted after beating Syria in the final. 

The team has been playing well. But the important thing is now to maintain consistency, Pereira said. 

Mohun Bagan coach also agreed with Houghton, who has proposed to the All India Football Federation that several traditional tournaments such as Santosh Trophy and Durand Cup be made age-specific events. 

But he should desist from taking too many players from one club as it weakens them for domestic competitions, Pereira said. 

National captain Bhaichung Bhutia, along with defenders N.S. Manju and Deepak Mondal, were in action during the Nehru Cup and could not represent Mohun Bagan in the CFL Premier Division.

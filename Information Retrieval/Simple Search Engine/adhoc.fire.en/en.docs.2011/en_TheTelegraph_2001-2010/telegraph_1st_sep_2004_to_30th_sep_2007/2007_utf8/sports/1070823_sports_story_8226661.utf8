 Bhutia calls for more discipline vs Syria

 - Nehru Cup

 Gourmangi tipped to replace Deepak; Pradeep returns

 There is reason for the Bhaichung Bhutias to smile with India climbing 11 spots to No. 151 in the Fifa rankings 

New Delhi: The feel good factor that is currently prevailing in Indian football would face its biggest test on Thursday when India take on Syria in the Nehru Cup encounter at the floodlit Ambedkar Stadium. 

Syria are firm favourites to win the tournament, but expectations about the hosts is running high. After all, India havent lost six matches on the trot that has taken their rankings to 151 on Wednesday. 

There is no denying the credit goes to the Indians, but Syria perhaps are a much stronger side than Indias six previous opponents four lower division Portuguese clubs, Cambodia and Bangladesh, both placed below India in the Fifa rankings. 

Skipper Bhaichung Bhutia has rightly pointed out that India have to be a highly disciplined team to tackle Syria. They are fine side. To beat them, each of us has to do our job correctly. We need to be extremely disciplined on the field. 

Lack of options in some of the key areas is one of Houghtons biggest problems. He has meticulously built up a first eleven that has been working quite smoothly till now. The changes that he brought in the second half in the last two matches have also paid dividends. 

But then, in case of unexpected substitutions, India looked bit unprepared both against Cambodia and Bangladesh. After N.P. Pradeep and Deepak Mondal had to be replaced due to injury, neither Mehrajuddin nor Rahim Nabi could play with equal fluency. 

Thankfully Pradeep is back in shape to play on Thursday. While Gormangi is tipped to take Deepaks place, Renedy Singh may have to make way for Clifford Miranda in the starting eleven. 

Houghton is certainly cautious. This one match is not going to decide anything. If we win on Thursday, we wont be world beaters. If we lose, it wont be the end of the road either. 

Yet, Houghton should be commended for sticking to his gun of playing pressing football. Never for a moment in the two matches had India restored to defensive tactics even though Bangladesh attacked with vigour throughout the first half. 

Syria are slow starters but a skilfully attacking side with skipper Maher Al Sayed being their key playmaker. If India can control the pace, then they have a chance to tame the West Asians. 

Houghton, one understands, is quietly preparing for a bigger battle in the World Cup qualifiers. At the same time, he must be aware that anything less than a place in the final in a low-key tournament like this would be considered as a failure. 

Such a scenario would do no good to Houghton and his teams image.

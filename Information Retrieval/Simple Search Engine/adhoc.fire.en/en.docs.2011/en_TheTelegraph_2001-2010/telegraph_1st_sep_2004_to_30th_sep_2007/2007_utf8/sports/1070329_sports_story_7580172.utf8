 Buchanan: One of Haydens best 

St Johns: Australian coach John Buchanan rated Matthew Haydens innings of 158 against the West Indies on Tuesday as one of the best in his career. 

It was one of his top innings not just because of the score but because of the adjustment he made coming from the group games in St Kitts, Buchanan told a news conference. 

He came into this after a travel day, a short training session and then batting on a wicket that was significantly different, on a ground that was significantly different and a bowling attack that was significantly different. 

We were looking for a platform from him and he gave us exactly that so I rate that innings very highly, he added, praising Haydens shot-selection and the range of his strokes. 

Haydens innings was a fitting opening performance in the new Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, recalling the Antiguans fluent strokeplay, controlled aggression and impenetrable confidence. 

But the first game in the purpose-built venue was spoilt by a poor turnout the new stands were less than half-full and then by the rain which left Laras side kicking their heels in the dressing room and the fans slowly getting wet in the drizzle. 

The only major disappointment in the Australian performance was batsman Michael Husseys failure to make it to double figures for the fourth time in four games at this World Cup.

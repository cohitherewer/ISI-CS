 Lille lodge complaint with Uefa

Paris: Lille have lodged a formal complaint with Uefa after losing 0-1 to Manchester United in a controversial Champions League first knockout round first leg on Tuesday. 

The French club, whose players staged a near walkout after a quickly-taken Ryan Giggs free kick gave the visitors a late victory, also hit back at United manager Alex Ferguson. 

Lille coach Claude Puel said he did not know what would come from the complaint about the refereeing to European soccers governing body but told reporters: I think United really lacked fair play. 

Ferguson said the free kick, six minutes from time, had been played by the book and he was disgusted by the home sides reaction to the goal. 

I think Uefa have got to take some action, the Scot told Britains ITV Sport. Ive never in my life seen anything like that. 

Its a disgrace, what weve seen tonight. Thats not football. The Lille staff encouraged their players to come off the pitch. Its intimidation of the referee and its made for a hostile atmosphere inside the ground. 

Puel dismissed the remarks, saying: Alex Ferguson thinks what he wants. But I do not understand that this man indulges in such comments. He could spare them. (Reuters)

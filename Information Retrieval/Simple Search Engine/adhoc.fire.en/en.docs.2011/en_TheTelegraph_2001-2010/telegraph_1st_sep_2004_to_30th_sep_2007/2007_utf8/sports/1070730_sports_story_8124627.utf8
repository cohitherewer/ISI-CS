Montreal: World junior champion P. Harikrishna lost his final-round game to Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine and finished third at the Montreal International Chess tournament. 

Harikrishna needed a full point to finish first, but he could do little against Ivanchuks fine technique. Harikrishna will gain around eight elo points. (PTI)

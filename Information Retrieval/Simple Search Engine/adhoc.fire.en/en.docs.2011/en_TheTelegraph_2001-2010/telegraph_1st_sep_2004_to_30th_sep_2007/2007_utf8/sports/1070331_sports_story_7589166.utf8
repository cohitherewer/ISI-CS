 Dope charge on Thorpe

Paris: Five-time Olympic gold medallist swimmer Ian Thorpe showed abnormal levels of two banned substances in a doping test last year, a French sports daily reported on its website on Friday. 

Anti-doping officials in Australia threw out the case for lack of scientific evidence, but the sports governing body, Fina, wants the investigation reopened, the report claimed. Thorpe retired in November at 24. 

The report said Thorpe turned up irregular levels of testosterone and luteinizing hormone in a test on May 2006. 

Synthetic versions of testosterone, the male hormone, can act like steroids to improve performance.

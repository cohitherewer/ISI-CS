 Australians dont enthuse Viv

 Viv Richards 

Bridgetown: Sir Vivian Richards is not convinced that the Australian cricketers have what it takes to come back from the recent defeats and retain the World Cup. 

Speaking ahead of Australias World Cup warm-up match against Zimbabwe Tuesday, the West Indies batting great said there was too much hype surrounding the Aussies and they were beatable on any day. 

Richards reasoned that the recent 0-3 series loss the world champions took in New Zealand was the wake-up call for other teams to realise the tide has changed. 

These heavy defeats came in the wake of Australia losing to England in the finals of the tri-nation series down under after dominating the English for all but the last two weeks of the summer. 

What that did was to let everyone know that the slide is on, he said. I believe this Australian team does not have the necessary skills on board to come back. 

We are seeing cracks in the armour. The Australians have lost some of the fire and they are definitely beatable. 

Had the Australians not come into the World Cup on a run of six losses in seven matches, Richards would have been tipping them for a third consecutive World Cup title. 

If they had won all their matches at home and then done the same in New Zealand, then I would start saying a World Cup defeat would be an upset, he said. 

Richards rated the Australian team under Steve Waugh as stronger than the present bunch under Ricky Ponting, but he said Waughs era was still not as great as the all-conquering West Indies side of the 1980s. 

They held Steve (Waugh) in great stature and rightfully so. Today they do not have the same volume in terms of depth and quality as in the past. The pride dented by England and New Zealand They were hit hard. 

Pontings men, who beat Zimbabwe Tuesday, face England on Friday in their final warm-up match and start the World Cup proper against Scotland on March 14. Netherlands and South Africa are also in group A. (AP)

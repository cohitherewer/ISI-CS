 Team Indias, onus Gregs 

Scapegoat hunt begins

 March 24: Were familiar with the Bermuda Triangle. But, now, the eternal optimists are looking for a Bermuda Miracle!

 Well

 If weve got to depend on Bermuda to bale us out, then we may as well not play top grade cricket.

 As things stand, only a Bermuda win over Bangladesh tomorrow will take Team India to the World Cup Super Eight.

 Thats as probable as coach Greg Chappell getting an extension. If anything, Rahul Dravid perhaps has a better chance of retaining the captaincy.

 Many, of course, feel we could do with a younger captain who can grow with the support of Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Dravid himself.

 Faced with another must-win match, against Sri Lanka yesterday, Dravid and Co. crashed to a 69-run pride-busting defeat.

 We lacked passion, the desire to get out of a hole and, most important, got done in by the batsmen.

 Even the emotional exhortation from fans who held placards such as Do it for India, maan didnt help. 

 The bowlers couldve done better, yes, but if the team is packing its bags (for a flight out of Port of Spain on Monday), its because many prized guns fired blanks.

 Worse, Yuvraj Finisher Singh got run out. Not that we were then enviably placed, but that effectively finished whatever chance we had of getting past 254. 

 As delighted as the Sri Lankans were the Bangladesh players and coach Dav Whatmore whod parked themselves at the Queens Park Oval.

 Having beaten India in the opener, a result which quickly took the sheen off our much-feted players, theyre at the doorstep of history.

 A huge moment awaits Habibul Bashar and his Young Turks. 

 Given that our exit is about to be confirmed worst performance since the 1992 World Cup in Australia-New Zealand the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Sharad Pawar has spoken of harsh measures.

 Pawar, who set a poor example by failing to keep an appointment with the team before its departure for the West Indies, also talked about injecting fresh blood.

 Fact is Suresh Raina is the lone youngster who couldve made the World Cup XV. To accommodate him, though, Virender Sehwag wouldve had to be dropped.

 As it turns out, Sehwag has emerged Indias highest scorer (164). Sourav is two behind.

 Even before leaving, Chappell said hed been given a team which India wanted and that he couldnt do much if some felt it was a Dads Army.

 Granted, a coach has limitations, but Chappell got the job 22 months ago with the explicit brief of helping India win the World Cup. Or, at least, repeating the 2003 performance of making the final.

 There has to be accountability Theres no point saying responsibility has to be shared The public mood is such that I dont see how we could even think of giving Chappell an extension, a top BCCI official told The Telegraph.

 He added: Personally, Im in favour of giving the job to one of our own Foreigners speak of processes and methods, but weve got to look at the results. Chappell has been a failure.

 Bob Woolmer, who lost his life on the morning after Pakistan got knocked out a week ago, was man enough to accept were sorry we performed like we have. We didnt mean to do it.

 That wasnt uttered by either Chappell or Dravid. Yet, the captain expects fans at home not to react in an extreme manner.

 Burning effigies and hurling stones doesnt help. An apology from the other side could.

 Dravid mentioned the need for review and if Pawar means business, then he should give pride of place to domestic cricket. 

 Even if that means limited international commitments during our home season.

 Its not enough that the Tendulkars play just the odd game. Such guest appearances are little more than a farce.

 The planning for the next World Cup, in the subcontinent in 2011, clearly has to begin now. However, one cant hope for much as long as the BCCI largely remains a club of amateurs.

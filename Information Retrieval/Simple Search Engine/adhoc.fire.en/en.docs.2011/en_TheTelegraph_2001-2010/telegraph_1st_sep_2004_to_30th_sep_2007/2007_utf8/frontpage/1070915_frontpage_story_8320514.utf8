 Guwahati, Sept. 14: Mamoni Raisom Goswami may have ignored the enemy within stress in trying to bring two enemies to the negotiating table. 

 The writer admitted to The Telegraph during her first interaction with the media since being hospitalised with a mild cerebral stroke on Sunday that she was overly worried about not being able to break the Ulfa-Delhi deadlock. 

 I am very serious about whatever I do. So I was disturbed. I was restless since Sunday morning and felt weak. Anticipating that something was wrong, my family members admitted me to hospital, she said from her bed at GNRC Hospitals. 

 Goswami said she was still hopeful of her initiative bearing fruit. I am okay now and will be back among my people soon. I am grateful to the people of Assam for their support and care. I will continue my peace mission. 

 The spokesman for GNRC Hospitals, Manoj Kumar Deka, said Goswami was responding well to treatment and should be back on her feet soon. Singer Debojit Saha and the president of the Asam Sahitya Sabha, Kanak Sen Deka, were among the visitors at her bedside today. 

 A family member said Goswami had been under stress because of constant travelling across the state for functions and projects. 

 Neurologist N.C. Borah, who heads GNRC Hospitals, cut short his visit to New Delhi to guide the team of doctors attending on Goswami. Chief minister Tarun Gogoi offered Rs 1 lakh for her treatment.

 Goswamis face lit up as she spoke about her new English novel, Journey of Ravana. The writer said the book was ready and would hit bookshops after her discharge from hospital. The novel is about the personality of Ravana, his good and bad qualities. It is based on my observations on a character who is considered devilish.

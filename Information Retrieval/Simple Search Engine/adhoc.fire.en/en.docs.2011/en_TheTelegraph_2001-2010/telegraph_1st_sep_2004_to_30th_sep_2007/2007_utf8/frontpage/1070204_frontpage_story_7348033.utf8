 Myanmar visit to rein in Ulfa

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Feb. 3: A high-level Indian delegation led by Union home secretary V.K. Duggal will visit Myanmar on February 13 to find solutions to the difficulties in starting operations against Ulfa camps located in Sagiang division of Myanmar. 

 The Indian team will also talk about the progress made on sharing intelligence with Myanmar. 

 Observers believe that although Myanmar has shown its willingness to go after the Ulfa verbally, in reality it has done precious little. Duggals visit comes close on the heels of a three-day visit to Yangon by minister of external affairs Pranab Mukherjee.

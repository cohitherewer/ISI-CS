 Security beef-up for blockade

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Shillong, June 19: The Congress-led Meghalaya Democratic Alliance (MDA) government has beefed up security here in view of the night road blockade called by the Khasi Students Union (KSU) from tonight. 

 The night road blockade, sponsored by the KSU, will start at 7 pm and end at 5 am everyday till Saturday. KSU information and technology secretary Mebanker Lapang announced this in a press communiqu. 

 The KSU has called the night road blockade in protest against the arrest of five of its members, including its organising secretary Daniel Khryiem. 

 The five KSU members were arrested on June 12 and booked under the Meghalaya Preventive Detention Act (MPDA) for disrupting law and order. 

 Elaborate security arrangements have been made by the administrations of East and West Khasi Hills districts as well as Ri Bhoi district. The road blockade is expected to impact movement of traffic along National Highways 40 and 44. 

 These two routes form the lifeline of Mizoram, Tripura, the Barak Valley and parts of Manipur. 

 The Meghalaya home department held a meeting to review the law and order situation, following which it instructed police to be on high alert, particularly on the national highways. 

 Special police teams have been pressed into service to provide security in sensitive areas like Mawlai and Mawiong. 

 Meghalaya chief minister D.D. Lapang said his government would not allow the agitation to impact on movement of vehicles along the national highways. 

 Such forms of agitation should not have any effect on our neighbouring states, which depend on movement of goods and passengers along this route, Lapang told reporters. 

 The Meghalaya chief minister expressed the hope that the KSU would call off its agitation, which he claimed would have an adverse impact on the states development and economy. 

 However, the KSU has shown no signs of abandoning its agitation over uranium mining in Meghalaya. The KSU had organised a 36-hour bandh from 5 am on June 11.

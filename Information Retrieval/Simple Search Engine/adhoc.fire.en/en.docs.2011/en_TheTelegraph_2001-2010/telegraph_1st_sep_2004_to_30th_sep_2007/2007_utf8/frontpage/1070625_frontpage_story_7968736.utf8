 Sparks of nuke hope

 SANJAY OJHA

 Jamshedpur, June 24: Atomic Energy Commission chairperson Anil Kakodkar today brushed away speculation of shelving of a nuclear plant in East Singhbum due to its proximity to uranium ore at Jadugoda.

 The site selection committee is looking into the project and at the moment there is no plan to shelve the project. This is a suitable site and we are keen on its becoming a reality, he said.

 He also hinted at plans to increase nuclear power generation capacity of the country beyond the proposed plants in different parts of the country.

 Eight sites, which have already been approved are at Kudankulam in Tamil Nadu (2x1000 MWe), Kakrapar in Gujarat (2x700 MWe), Rawatbhata in Rajasthan (2x700 MWe) and Jaitapur in Maharashtra (2x1000 MWe). The total additional generation will be to the tune of 6800 MWe capacity.

 Kakodkar was in the city this evening for the inauguration of a processing unit of Uranium Corporation of India Ltd at Turamdih. He is scheduled to visit the other installation of UCIL and proposed mining sites at Baduhurang and Mohuldih in East Singhbhum before leaving for Ranchi.

 Sources in the DAE said approval of ministry of environment and forest for the proposed sites is at different stages. Pre-project activities have been initiated at some of the sites, they said.

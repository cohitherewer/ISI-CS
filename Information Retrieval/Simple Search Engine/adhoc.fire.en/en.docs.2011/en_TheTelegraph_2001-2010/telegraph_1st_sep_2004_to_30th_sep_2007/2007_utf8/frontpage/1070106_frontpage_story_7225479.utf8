 Earlier, Soren reached Dhanbad at 5.05 am in the 2324 Down New Delhi-Howrah special Express. After having food of the railways from New Delhi, he journeyed till Dhanbad without a complain. Well, he has never shown any problem ever. The 10 security men escorting him were also surprised by his disposition, said son Hemant Soren.

 However, since the arrangement in the jail was not found suitable he was further sent to Dumka central jail in the evening. 

 Hemant Soren said his father is ready to stay anywhere as he has faith in the almighty and was ready to stay anywhere he keeps.

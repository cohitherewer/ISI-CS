 Centre mulls new ceasefire monitor

 OUR BUREAU 

 New Delhi, Jan. 25: The Centre is considering a change of guard in the Ceasefire Monitoring Group which oversees the truce agreements of the two NSCN factions. 

 According to sources, former Andhra Pradesh DGP Swaranjit Sen may replace Lt Gen (retd) R.V. Kulkarni, the current incumbent. 

 Sen, who retired in December, may take up the assignment in Kohima after Gen. Kulkarni vacates the position. 

 The move is likely to displease the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) but make it rival group, led by S.S. Khaplang, happy. The latter had been campaigning for Gen. Kulkarnis removal. 

 The real reason behind the move, apparently, is to use the Khaplang group to flush Ulfa rebels out of Myanmar. 

 The NSCN (K) reportedly trains Ulfa militants in its Myanmar camps. 

 From Upper Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, Ulfa militants cross over to that country with the help of the Naga outfit.

 Gen. Kulkarni had repeatedly told the home ministry that despite a ceasefire, not even one per cent of the groups armed rebels stayed within designated camps, whereas nearly 55 per cent of NSCN (I-M) rebels lived in camps. 

 This apparently displeased those in North Block who are in favour of the NSCN (K)s help to tackle Ulfa.

 The move, however, may affect the ongoing peace process with the NSCN (I-M).

 Tea manager 

taken hostage

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Guwahati, Aug. 1: Suspected militants abducted the assistant manager of a tea estate in Sonitpur district of Assam last night.

 Aniruddha Tanti was headed for his bungalow from the factory of Hirajuli tea estate when his captors whisked him away. Nobody from the tea estate or the abducted assistant managers family had received any telephone call or letter for ransom till late tonight.

 Aniruddha is the son of Bhimananda Tanti, a former legislator from Rangapara constituency in Sonitpur. 

 Police said they suspect the Birsa Commando Force of being behind the abduction, though the motive is as yet unknown.

 News of the abduction added to the governments security concerns ahead of Independence Day, when Ulfa and other militant groups invariably run riot.

 Chief minister Tarun Gogoi held meetings with senior officials of security agencies today to review the states preparedness to keep militants in check. 

 As the security establishment mulled ways to keep Ulfa at bay, the outfit found time to ridicule the slow pace of the Naga peace talks. Ulfa said the talks had not gone beyond internationalising the issue.

 The remark, made in the Ulfa bulletin Swadhinata, came a day after Delhi and the NSCN (I-M) extended their ceasefire indefinitely. Ulfa said the NSCN (I-M) raised the demand for integration of all contiguous Naga-inhabited areas at Delhis behest.

 Board amp; Dravid in ad friendly 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 I am sure the BCCI will 

 discuss the issue with the players

 Rahul Dravid

 April 8: Exactly 24 hours after announcing a cap on player endorsements, the Board of Control for Cricket in India has agreed to review the decision taken by its working committee yesterday.

 According to The Telegraphs sources, the BCCI began softening its stand after iconic former captain Kapil Dev spoke to president Sharad Pawar this morning.

 Apparently, Kapil suggested that the BCCI allow a maximum of six endorsements each year instead of the three announced in Mumbai.

 Existing tie-ups dont get affected, though. 

 Kapils argument: Three wouldnt leave scope for sponsors outside bat manufacturers, pad-makers and apparel producers.

 It couldnt be confirmed, but captain Rahul Dravid is understood to have talked to Pawar before releasing a 235-word statement.

 Among other things, he said: It is not correct to project this whole issue as a conflict of commercial interests of the players and the BCCI. Let me clarify there is no conflict between the players and the BCCI.

 The interests of the players and the BCCI are inclusive and not exclusive. The BCCI has always been very caring and considerate about the players interests and I am sure the BCCI will discuss the issue with the players at a suitable time.

 For most, Dravids statement came as a revelation as he normally steers clear of contentious matters. But, then, the players wouldve been expecting the captain to take the lead and he hasnt disappointed.

 It should help him in the dressing room. 

 That Dravid isnt ill at ease stepping out of the crease became evident two months ago when he tore into Goas Chetan Desai, whod been the BCCI-appointed manager during the Test series in South Africa.

 Later, he fought for Virender Sehwag in the selection meeting where the World Cup squad was picked.

 Then, despite being grilled by former BCCI president Raj Singh Dungarpur during last Fridays World Cup review, Dravid refused to identify any teammate as a rotten apple.

 Of course, typically, hes least likely to accept that hes changed.

 Dravids statement elicited a response from two BCCI officials vice-president (east) Rajeev Shukla and secretary Niranjan Shah.

 The cap announced yesterday isnt sacrosanct. Mr Pawar is soon going to meet some players and the issue can be resolved. The players are part of the family and cant be treated as outcasts, pointed out Shukla, a Rajya Sabha member.

 Any fair representation will be considered. When did the BCCI say that its doors have been shut on the players? Please dont make it into a controversy, Shah maintained. 

 Another vice-president (central), hardliner Shashank Manohar, clarified that a news agency had misquoted him. Ive said we wont discuss anything with the agents of players. I didnt say we wouldnt talk to the players themselves.

 That Bangladesh stunned No.1-ranked South Africa (the defeat has made them drop to No.2) last night may have, in a small manner, contributed to a softening in the BCCIs stand.

 After all, its the March 17 loss to Bangladesh which put the Dravids in the line of fire.

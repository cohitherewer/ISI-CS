 Quit notice looms over migrants

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Dibrugarh, April 21: Once again raising the bogey of infiltration, the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad (AJYCP) has issued a quit notice today to suspected illegal Bangladeshi migrants at Doomdooma in Tinsukia district of Upper Assam. They have been asked to leave by Wednesday.

 Mounting pressure on the administration for its failure to evict them, the AJYCPs Doomdooma unit, in a statement released to the media, has warned of stern steps against those who fail to meet the deadline. 

 The statement, however, assured that the organisation would not resort to violence. 

 It is really surprising that the administration has failed to take effective steps to evict illegal Bangladeshis migrants even after we submitted several petitions. Its inaction has compelled us to take strong steps, secretary of Doomdooma unit of AJYCP, Manik Dutta, said. The quit notice is reminiscent of the anti-foreigners movement spearheaded by the All Assam Students Union in the early eighties which finally culminated in the signing of the historic Assam Accord in 1985. 

 Many criminals of Bangladeshi origin are suspected to have settled in Upper Assam. They are allegedly the ones responsible for thefts and robberies in and around Doomdooma. 

 The growth in population of suspected Bangladeshi nationals is a recent development which is a major concern for us, Dutta said.

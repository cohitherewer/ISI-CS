 Ten Ulfa explosives dumps, not a clue

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Guwahati, Aug. 2: Assams capital city is sitting on as many as 10 explosives dumps that police know about but cannot locate.

 These explosives were smuggled into the city a few months ago. Although we have information on these dumps, tracing them has become a big headache and our biggest priority, a senior police official revealed today. 

 He said the dumps could be anywhere, even in rented apartments. 

 Security in and around the city has been beefed up to the highest possible level already and the arrangements will remain in place until at least Independence Day. Ulfa is known to be most active in the run-up to August 15, targeting everything from vital installations to public places. 

 The police believe the explosives dumps are scattered around the citys suburbs. Security forces have launched a special but low-key operation to locate them, albeit without any success so far. 

 The official said Ulfa was delegating the task of assembling bombs and improvised explosive devices and planting them to its recruits rather than old hands. Since the police have no information on these recruits, they mingle with the population and continue their work unnoticed.

 These new recruits are put through a short period of training in the basics of assembling bombs and IEDs. Since the training period is hardly of three or four weeks duration, these youths never become hardcore militants and remain in the mainstream. Even the neighbours of these recruits do not suspect anything as they are absent from their homes only for a few weeks, the official said. 

 The police maintain that Deepjyoti Kalita, the fine arts student who was killed in an encounter at his rented room at Nabin Nagar on June 12, was one such recruit. The grenades they found in the room were, however, far less menacing than the stockpiles that are keeping the security establishment on its toes.

 The police have repeatedly asked landlords to provide information about their tenants to the nearest police stations, but the directive has gone mostly unheeded. We cannot do much unless people co-operate, the police official added. 

 Security agencies are convinced that the explosions in the city this year there have as many as 23 were all the handiwork of Ulfa recruits about whom they knew nothing. 

 Representatives of the police and civil administration went into a huddle today to finalise a security blueprint for the days leading to Independence Day. 

 Chaired by Kamrup (metro) deputy commissioner Avinash Joshi, the meeting decided to put in place multi-tier security arrangements. Apart from fortifying Judges Field, the focus will be on vulnerable areas and installations. 

 The militants strategy is to strike the next available target if they do not succeed in getting their prime targets, an official source said.

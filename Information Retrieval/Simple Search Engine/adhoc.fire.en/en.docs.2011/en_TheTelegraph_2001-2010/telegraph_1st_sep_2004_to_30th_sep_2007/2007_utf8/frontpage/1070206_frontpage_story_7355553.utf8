 Migrant rush near Pyrdiwah

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Shillong, Feb. 5: The BSF and BDR today pushed back a 1,000-strong crowd of Bangladeshis who were allegedly trying to cross over to the Indian side near the Dawki-Tamabil international border in Meghalaya. 

 Villagers on the Indian side raised an alarm around 11 this morning that thousands of Bangladeshis were advancing towards Pyrdiwah, some on boat and some on foot. 

 The BSF immediately swung into action, sealing off all major entry points along the Dawki-Tamabil border. Soon the BDR, which is usually accused of giving cover to illegal migrants from Bangladesh, joined in and stopped the intruders near the zero line. 

 Those who managed to sneak in have been sent back, said an officer of the Jaintia Hills district administration. 

 However, the incident caused a flutter among local villagers who ran for cover. Later, they said they were terrified of a April 15, 2001 rerun at Pyrdiwah when illegal migrants and the BDR had entered the village and occupied it for a week.

 Deputy commissioner of Jaintia Hills, F.R. Kharkongor, said they were yet to find out why so many people were rushing over to the Indian side. He said the unrest in Bangladesh could be a reason. 

 Sources said the BDR has detained 1,500 people for trying to cross over to India illegally. 

 The BSF is sending additional troops to the Dawki-Tamabil sector.

 Bribe cry in Rizwanur case 

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Sept. 26: Rizwanur Rahmans uncle told a public meeting today some Left Front leaders had offered the family money to hush up the youths death.

 Some Left Front leaders came to our Tiljala house. They told us to end the matter and promised any sum of money in return, Shaidul Rahman said, but did not name anyone.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said the allegation would be probed. All complaints coming from all quarters will be investigated.

 Land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah, minority affairs minister Abdus Sattar, CPM MP Mohammed Selim, CPM leader Rabin Deb and mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya had visited the family after the youths death. 

 Rizwanur, a computer graphics designer, was found dead on Friday, just over a month after he married the daughter of businessman Ashok Todi against her familys wishes. 

 His family and a complaint Rizwanur had filed with a rights group allege that the Todis and several senior police officers had pressured him to divorce his wife.

 Rizwanur had been tortured tremendously for the past one month and our family threatened. I appeal to all to stand by our family, his elder brother Rukbanur said at the rally.

 CPM state secretary Biman Bose promised action against the alleged harassment. The way they were harassed was wrong. The harassment will be probed and legal action taken against those found guilty, he said.

 Asked if the CID, which has been handed the case, would also probe the police role, Bose said: I have spoken to the chief minister. An inquiry means it would include everything. 

 Home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray denied reports of a clean chit to police chief Prasun Mukherjee, who has defended his officers intervention. Mukherjee also described the death as suicide without waiting for the post-mortem report. 

 We havent given a clean chit to anyone so far. No officer is outside the periphery of the probe, Ray said.

 The state human rights commission has asked for a report from the police commissioner, who will also have to explain to the government how he could announce that the death was a suicide. He will have to hand in a separate report on the flare-up against the death in Park Circus on Saturday.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, who had clashed with Mukherjee over the CAB poll, visited the Rahmans today. I dont believe that its a case of suicide. The culprits must be punished. I will talk to Rezzak Mollah to ensure financial help to the family to fight the legal battle, he said.

 Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee, who organised the rally where Shaidul and Rukbanur spoke, repeated her demand for a CBI probe.

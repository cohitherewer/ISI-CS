 Patna, May 21: It was a marriage negotiation that went awry. The couple planned to spend Sunday discussing their future together. But intruders put paid to their plan and the prospective groom was flung out of the 10th floor flat. He died instantaneously. 

 She is a spinster and he was a widower. Suresh Mahto had reached Patna in response to a matrimonial advertisement and planned to return to Lucknow the same evening. 

 He had claimed to be a deputy general manager with Tata Indicom, but the company denies he was employed with them. 

 Intruders, who barged into the flat of Sadhna Shrivastav, a spinster in her 40s and posted as a judge with the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), had pretended to be CBI officers. 

 Brandishing toy pistols, they first wanted the copy of an order signed by Shrivastav. Thereafter they wanted her to return Rs 15 lakh, which she had supposedly received from a suspended director-general (home guards), Narayan Mishra. And, finally, they wanted the couple to pose nude for them.

 All this happened around 3 pm and the only eyewitness is the 12-year-old domestic help of the lady, Jaggan, who had opened the door to the intruders. 

 Shrivastav told police that when she and Mahto refused to oblige the intruders, they grew violent and a scuffle broke out. It was during the scuffle, she claims, that Mahto was flung out of the flat.

 One of the intruders, still absconding, has been identified to be a notorious criminal and the son of a police constable who was deemed close to suspended IPS officer Narayan Mishra. 

 The criminal, Anil Singh, has been involved in sex trafficking, extortion and blackmailing rackets and had recently come out of jail.

 On Monday, police again interrogated the suspended DG for over four hours. 

 A case of acquiring disproportionate asset is pending against Mishra, who had challenged his suspension before CAT but the tribunal turned down his appeal. Mishra, however, denied his involvement in the murder of the executive from Lucknow; and demanded a CBI inquiry to clear the air.

 The lady told the police that both she and Mahto hailed from Allahabad and had known each other. His wife had passed away a few months ago and he decided to come down to have a chat with her after seeing the matrimonial advertisement seeking a suitable match for her.

 IG (Patna Zone) Rajvardhan Sharma told The Telegraph that both the intruders, Anil Singh and Pawan Singh, are known offenders. 

 While Anil Singh is absconding, the latter, a clerk at the tribunal, fractured his leg while trying to escape and has been arrested. Anil Singh is known to have committed crimes in both Patna and in Mumbai.

 The intruders, he said, were looking for Shrivastavs secretary C.V. Singh and assumed that Mahto was the secretary. The IG also confirmed that Mahto was almost stripped by the two criminals, who apparently wanted to take photographs of the couple in the nude so as to blackmail them in future.

 Many questions remain unanswered but Bihar director-general of police, A.R. Sinha, declared that the police are on the verge of cracking the murder mystery.

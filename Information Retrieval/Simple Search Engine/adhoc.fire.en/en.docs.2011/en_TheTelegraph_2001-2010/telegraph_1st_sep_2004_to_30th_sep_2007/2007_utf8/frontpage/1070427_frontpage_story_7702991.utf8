 Reveal marks prod to JPSC 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ranchi, April 26: The state Information Commission today directed Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC) to reveal marks obtained by a candidate in the civil services preliminary test and to spell out reasons why he was not declared successful. The marks have to be revealed to the candidate within three weeks.

 Earlier, the Central Information Commission (CIC) had directed the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to reveal marks to a candidate. UPSC had moved the Delhi High Court but the court upheld the order of CIC.

 Even as JPSCs counsel Sanjay Kumar Piparwal pleaded that revealing the marks would make the system vulnerable to misuse in future, the information commissioner directed the commission to inform Manoj Kumar Pathak, the complainant, why he failed to make it to the list of successful candidates. 

 Piparwal argued that marks are awarded according to a scaling process that brings all candidates on a particular level to enable them to compete on a level playing ground. For this, he informed the commission, a special software has been developed by experts, over which the JPSC has copyright and it cannot be made available to others. Vehemently opposing the demand for information, the lawyer argued that the divulged information would be misused by coaching centres.

 In his order the Information Commissioner observed that the candidate has not asked for any special information or even information about marks before and after the scaling. All that he has sought is the marks obtained by him in the preliminary test and reasons why he was declared unsuccessful. 

 The information commissioner, Harish Chandra Patar Munda, also observed that the candidate was eligible to receive any information that could or would be provided to Parliament or a state Assembly. 

 The JPSC chairman, Dilip Prasad, could not be contacted for his comments, but Jharkhand High Court advocate Amit Das said the State Information Commissions order would help in maintaining transparency. The information sought for is related to one candidate only, and is not likely to affect the functioning of JPSC, he added.

 Aspiring actor asks youth for sex, butchered at home

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Sept. 4: An aspiring actor, along with his grandmother, was killed late last night for allegedly putting pressure on the murderer for a gay relationship.

 The body of Priyanshu Pani, 23, was found at his OUAT Colony residence this morning with multiple cuts all over his body made with a sharp weapon. His 80-year-old grandmother had received severe injuries behind her head. The two were hammered by a heavy weapon following the attack with a sharp-edged one around midnight, police said.

 The accused, Arun Dora, 23, was the first one to report the incident to the police. He surrendered before the police soon after committing the crime. Arun, an MCA student at a city-based institute and a friend of Priyanshu, admitted to have killed the duo. In his statement recorded by Khandagiri police, Arun said that the murders were pre-planned. The accused, in his statement, said that Priyanshu had been pressurising him for sex and would make fun of him when he refused. Perturbed by the situation, he decided to kill him. Priyanshus grandmother, who came in between the two, was hammered to death, said Sashibhushan Sathpathy, the inspector in charge of Khandagiri police station.

 Priyanshu, the only son of his parents, had been staying alone with his grandmother since August 27. His parents and elder sister are on way to Vaishno Devi for pilgrimage and are supposed to return on September 12. They could not be contacted, the police said.

 He was driving me mad. He would make calls every now and then and laugh at me. I could not sleep for days together. I had headache and was out of control. So, I decided to kill him, said Arun.

 Priyanshu, currently working with a private bank, was an aspiring actor and had acted in a number of Oriya albums. He also had some offers for Oriya films. After graduating in fashion designing from Bangalore, he also walked the ramp many a time.

 His relatives, however, refuted Aruns charges. There is no truth in the statement. Priyanshu was a decent chap and can never resort to cheap things like that, said his maternal uncle Naresh Pattjoshi.

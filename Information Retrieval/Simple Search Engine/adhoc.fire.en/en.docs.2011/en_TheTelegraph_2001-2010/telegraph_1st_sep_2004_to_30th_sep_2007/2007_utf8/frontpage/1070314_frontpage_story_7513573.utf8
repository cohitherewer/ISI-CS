 Power respite for World Cup

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Shillong, March 13: There is good news for cricket fans here. The Meghalaya power department has decided to reschedule its loadshedding timings to enable people to enjoy the biggest event of the sport, the World Cup. 

 Power supply, which has been disrupted in the city for five hours from midnight for the past month, will now be cut off for three hours from 3 am, at least till the mega event is over. 

 The city has been experiencing regular loadshedding recently because of acute shortage of power supply. 

 The water level of the main dam of the Umiam hydroelectric project is at its lowest because of scanty rainfall during the past year. 

 With the Meghalaya State Electricity Board (MeSEB) incurring huge losses, the government recently decided to resort to daily loadshedding from midnight till 5 am. 

 The states present power generation is only 185 MW against a requirement of 610 MW.

 Notwithstanding the crisis, the government took the populist decision in view of the World Cup and the huge fan following the game of cricket enjoys in the city. 

 The decision was taken at a meeting between deputy chief minister Mukul Sangma, who holds the power portfolio, and MeSEB officials here today. 

 Announcing the decision, Sangma said: There is good news for cricket fans. The loadshedding timings have been rescheduled.

 Several people have been expressing their resentment over the loadshedding timings, which would have clashed with the World Cup matches. 

 Sangma also promised to announce a Meghalaya power policy soon to encourage private investment in the sector.

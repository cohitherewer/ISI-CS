 Maninder drug bust

 Maninder Singh

New Delhi, May 22: Maninder Singh, the former left-arm spinner who could not live up to comparisons with Bishen Singh Bedi, was arrested today on the charge of cocaine possession.

 He was picked up along with Sayyam Siddiqui alias Sam, said to be a Nigerian drug peddler police had been following over the past few days.

 Sources in the Delhi polices narcotics cell said the two were arrested when Sam was handing Maninder 1.5 grams of the drug in Defence Enclave, an east Delhi suburb close to Preet Vihar.

 Maninder lives in the nearby Gagan Apartments. A PTI report said he was arrested from his house.

 The seized quantity, which costs around Rs 5,000, falls a shade below the level that makes it a non-bailable offence. If the seized quantity remains 1.5 gm, Maninder, who has been taken to the narcotics cell office in east Delhi, could be released on bail when he is produced in court tomorrow.

 Possession of more than 2 gm of cocaine is non-bailable. If the quantity crosses 10 gm, it becomes trafficking.

 The sources said the police were surprised by the identity of the cocaine buyer as they were on a blind trail of the peddler.

 But former acquaintances of Maninder said he had been going through a tumultuous phase, probably linked to his marriage, over the last few years. 

 I am not surprised. I had told him to pull himself together four years ago, an associate who once considered himself Maninders mentor said.

 Maninder, who played 35 Tests and took 88 wickets for India from 1982 to 1993, occasionally commentates on television. He has a daughter and a son.

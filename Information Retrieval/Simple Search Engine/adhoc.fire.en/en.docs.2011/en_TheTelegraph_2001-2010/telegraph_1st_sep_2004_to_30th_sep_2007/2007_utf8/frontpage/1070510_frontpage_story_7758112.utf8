 Nod to Bengals landed SEZs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, May 9: The Centre has cleared three special economic zones in Bengal and 13 elsewhere. Firms setting up these zones already own land. 

 The Bengal proposals include a 19.58-hectare IT and BPO park to be developed by Unitech High Tech Structures in Rajarhat, where a similar SEZ will be promoted by Enfield Infrastructure over 20 hectares. Enfield also plans a 10-hectare biotech SEZ in Burdwan.

 Bengal commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said the three companies had bought land themselves as the requirement was modest.

 Unitech will work in collaboration with Universal Success, promoted by Prasun Mukherjee, the Salim group partner in other projects in Bengal. Enfield is run by the Bengal-based Santhalia Group, which has an export unit at the Falta SEZ.

 However, a decision on the Navi Mumbai SEZ, promoted by Reliance Industries chief Mukesh Ambani and his associate Anand Jain, was put off after objections from the finance ministrys revenue department. 

 The department wants details of steps to check revenue leaks, an official said. A railway line and a road pass through the 1,250-hectare SEZ. We need to confirm if the steps planned by the firm to prevent revenue losses through these routes are adequate, he said.

 SEZ rules require an underpass or overbridge to be built if a highway or a railway line passes through the enclave. 

 The idea is to stem revenue losses that might arise if products are moved out of an SEZ through open routes.

 Revenue department officials may visit the site of the Reliance SEZ for an assessment. The proposal might be taken up again on May 31.

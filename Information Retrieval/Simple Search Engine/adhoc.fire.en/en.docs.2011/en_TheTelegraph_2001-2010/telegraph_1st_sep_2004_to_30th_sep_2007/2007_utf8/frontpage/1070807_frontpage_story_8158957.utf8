 Bypoll code traps Salkhan

 NAVTAN KUMAR

 Jamshedpur, Aug. 6: Bahujan Samaj Party leader Salkhan Murmu is again in the soup with another FIR lodged against him for alleged violation of election code of conduct.

 Acting on a complaint by Jharkhand Front leader Surya Singh Besra, the Patamda police have filed a fresh FIR against Murmu for code violation. He is charged with holding a meeting with party workers at Dak Bungalow at Patamda on August 2, which is a violation of Section 144.

 Deputy commissioner Nitin Madan Kulkarni said a report in this regard had been sent to the Election Commission. This is the second FIR against Murmu. Earlier an FIR was lodged against him for taking out a motorcycle procession at Kadma last month.

 Although no candidate filed nomination today, the administration, however, remained busy with preparing for the election. The deputy commissioners office received names of two poll observers Samir Kumar Khare and R.K. Sahu. While Khare will arrive here on August 8, Sahu will come to the city on August 13. Two more observers are likely to come to Jamshedpur to monitor the election here.

 On the political front, BJP today declared that its candidate Dinesh Sarangi would file nomination on August 8. It will be a show of unity as senior leaders like state president P.N. Singh, leader of Opposition and former chief minister Arjun Munda, general secretary Dineshanand Goswami, MLAs Raghubar Das and Saryau Roy will accompany the candidate.

 In another development, Jharkhand Front leader Surya Singh Besra said Jharkhand Front, which claims to provide an alternative third front, would field its candidate in the Jamshedpur byelection. A workers conference has been organised tomorrow at Utkal Association auditorium which will be attended by Jharkhand Vikas Morcha leader Babulal Marandi and Jharkhand Party leader N.E. Horo. Besra said since JVM was now a part of the front, it would have to field a common candidate. 

 In yet another significant development, JMM candidate Suman Mahto met her mother in-law Khando Devi to seek her blessings in the by-election. She was accompanied by senior party leader and deputy chief minister Sudhir Mahto.

 BJP to field Sarangi

 OUR BUREAU

 Ranchi/Jamshedpur, Aug. 2: Setting aside all speculations, the BJP leadership today decided to field Bahragora MLA Dinesh Sarangi for the Jamshedpur Lok Sabha byelections, slated on August 29. 

 The decision was taken at a high level meeting of the Central Election Committee held in New Delhi this evening.

 Sarangi will contest the Jamshedpur by-election to take on JMMs Suman Mahto, the widow of slain Jamshedpur MP Sunil Mahto. The committee announced the candidature of Sarangi after discussing the winnability of the other two contenders Shailendra Mahto and Dineshanand Goswami.

 According to sources, former chief minister Arjun Munda wanted Shailendra Mahto. But, P.N. Singh, Jamshedpur (East) MLA Raghubar Das and also Jamshedpur (West) Sarayu Roy wanted Sarangi 

 Speaking to The Telegraph from New Delhi, Sarangi said misgovernance by the UPA governments both at Centre as well as in state will be his main agenda. Failure of the UPA government at the centre in checking price rise will figure during the campaign. Besides, prevailing corruption under the Madhu Koda-led UPA regime in the state will also be a major election plank, said the senior leader, soon after his nomination.

 The supporters of Sarangi said it would be easier to get the Oriya votes, which are a sizable number in the rural areas. Besides, he has also the potential to get the urban votes. On the other hand, Shailendra Mahto could not have managed even Mahto votes, which are likely to go for Suman Mahto, they added.

 Moreover, we would have no moral guts on the corruption charges against Shibu Soren as Shailendra, too, was an accused in the JMM bribery case, they added. Sarangi was health minister in the NDA government.

 With this, all the major contesting parties JMM, BJP, BSP and Jharkhand Vikas Morcha have announced the names of their candidates. 

 The district administration, too, is ready to conduct the by-elections. Deputy commissioner Nitin Madan Kulkarni said arrangements have been completed for the by-poll. 

 Cooperative College will be used as strong room and as the venue for counting of votes. The notification for the by-elections will be issued tomorrow. Filing of nominations will begin simultaneously. Last date of of the nominations is August 10, scrutiny of nominations will be done on August 11. Last date for withdrawal of candidature is August 13. Elections will be hold on August 29, he added.

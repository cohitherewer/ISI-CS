 Marks muddle probe

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar Aug. 18: Even as the school and mass education minister resigned yesterday, chief secretary Ajit Kumar Tripathy continued his probe into the mark-sheet fudging scandal. 

 Tripathy said he would submit his probe report soon even as the secondary board of education employees were firm on their demand to oust the controller of examinations and the board secretary. 

 Yesterday, Tripathy had questioned a senior official of the board of secondary education and a dealing assistant. The officer, who had signed the application form for issuing the mark-sheet and provisional certificate on a back date (June 11, 2007) but had scribbled the actual date (August 6, 2007) on it, was questioned along with a dealing assistant. 

 Former school and mass education minister Bishnu Dass son, Bijoy, was allegedly awarded 89 in Oriya even as he allegedly scored 39 and 80 in English against actual score of 50. He was awarded 60 in mathematics paper II though he actually scored 40 and 50 in science instead of 40, said sources. In social science paper II, he was awarded 54, nine marks more than what he allegedly scored.

 Meanwhile, the secondary board of education employees agitation might hamper smooth conduct of the supplementary examinations, beginning September 4. The employees have locked the rooms of the two officers.

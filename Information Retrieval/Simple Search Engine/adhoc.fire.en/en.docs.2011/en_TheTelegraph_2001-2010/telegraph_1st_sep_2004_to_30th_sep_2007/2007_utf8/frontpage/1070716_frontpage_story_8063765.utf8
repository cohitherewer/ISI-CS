 Jamshedpur, July 15: When medicines fail, praying remains the only option left.

 This became obvious today with officials of the Tata Steel Zoological Park organising a puja to save ailing Kamini, a hybrid lioness, who has stopped responding to medicines for the past few days.

 Sunday visitors at the zoo were surprised to find priests chanting mantras under a canopy near the Pet Park this morning. Smoke from incense sticks wafted in the air amid slight drizzle as priests were busy in the Maha Mrityunjay Jap.

 Four priests, headed by Raja Vadhyar Aiyar from Dharma Shashtra Mandir in Bistupur, were requisitioned to perform the rituals, generally done for human beings in critical condition.

 Zoo director M.S. Jain, veterinary doctor Manik Palit and other staff members also joined to perform the rituals which lasted close to one-and-a-half-hours. Maha Mriyunjay Jap proves effective to save life of human beings. It is also helpful for animals in distress, said Rajesh Aiyar, one of the priests.

 He added that mantra, havan and arati were the other component of the puja. 

 He added that all of them had taken pledge to help Kamini suffering from kidney and liver complications get rid of the distress.

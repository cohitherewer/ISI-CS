 Stung AASU strikes back 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, Jan. 18: Harking back to its revolutionary past, the All Assam Students Union (AASU) today asked the outlawed Ulfa to stop making irresponsible remarks that belittle the mass movement against illegal migration from Bangladesh.

 Samujjal Bhattacharyya, adviser to the states apex student organisation, said Ulfa commander-in-chief Paresh Barua had perhaps forgotten our revolutionary history after spending many years in Bangladesh.

 The militant leader had recently branded the AASU an agent of the state machinery. He said the organisations campaign against Muslim migrants from Bangladesh smacked of communalism.

 Barua had also challenged the AASU to extract a written assurance from Delhi to hold talks with Ulfa on the subject of sovereignty.

 Bhattacharyya said AASU had always been known for its secular character and did not require Ulfas endorsement. He dismissed the militant groups campaign for a sovereign Assam as one that did not match the student organisations philosophy.

 There is no question of the AASU taking the initiative, as Barua has challenged, to get the Centre to agree to talks with Ulfa on the issue of sovereignty. There is no need for us to take any such initiative because our organisation does not subscribe to this view, Bhattacharyya said. 

 The AASU adviser clarified that not agreeing with Ulfa on some issues did not imply that the student organisation would not support a dialogue for peace. Despite differences of opinion (with the militant leadership), the AASU and the Asom Unnati Sabha had met Union home minister Shivraj Patil to demand unconditional talks with Ulfa. Our stand is very clear. We want unconditional talks between the two sides and decisive steps should be taken, he said. 

 On Ulfas recent hate campaign against Hindi-speaking people, Bhattacharyya said no right-thinking individual or organisation would support a massacre of innocents. 

 The AASU also asked why the outfit had never taken a stand against the ISIs support to influx into Assam from Bangladesh. 

 In an oblique reference to allegations of Ulfa being controlled by foreign powers, the student organisation said time would tell whether Barua had all along been guided by his free will.

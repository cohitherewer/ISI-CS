 Startling facts of admission figures

 SASWATI MUKHERJEE 

 Jamshedpur, June 3: Blame it on the figures.

 Around 25,000 application forms were sold out for admission in BEd course offered in just 10 constituent colleges with a seat strength of 100 in each of them. On the other hand, there is a staggering vacancy of about 13,000 teachers posts in government schools across the state. 

 With the steel city witnessing a clash between the tribal and non-tribal students at the Jamshedpur Co-operative College last Friday over the giving away of forms to tribal students, only the interference of political leaders could bring forth peace on the campus.

 The issue is just being politicised. Meritorious students would automatically get admission, said A.A. Khan, the vice-chancellor of Ranchi University, under whose aegis the much sought-after BEd course is running. 

 Having sensed trouble last year itself after the process of centralisation failed to facilitate smooth admission procedure across the state, this year the university resorted to its earlier de-centralisation process for admission to the course. We received complaints from many students with humble backgrounds saying that it is difficult for them to come to Ranchi for the smallest transaction. Therefore, we reverted to the process where they can fill in forms from their respective colleges in their city, added Khan. 

 But trouble reigned supreme when a group of students raised a furore and managed to scare away students from Bahragora College on the pretext of it being a tribal-dominated area, thereby suggesting only the admission of tribal students to the course. 

 Though experts feel that education should not be divided in the name of caste, a section of tribal students strongly feel that the existing employment opportunities are there for them to enjoy the bigger slice of the pie. 

 Why should we lag behind in the rat race? There is a rule that goes that in case of vacancies in the general category seats, we can fill in the void, so why not, said a tribal student involved in the fight for dominance in the state on the pretext of education.

 Significantly, the BEd form is issued to candidates against furnishing a copy of the states residential certificate. 

 According to the rule, anybody who is a resident of Jharkhand can apply for the course. However, there is no reservation on the basis of place or area. With two constituent colleges each at Chaibasa and Ranchi, three in Jamshedpur alone and one each at Gumla, Chakradharpur and Bahragora, the last date for submission of the forms is June 10.

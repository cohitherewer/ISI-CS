 Gujarats burning secret out

 Vanzara: More trouble

 April 30: Kauser Bano has been killed and her body burnt, the Gujarat government is believed to have told the Supreme Court today.

 The submission, made in a sealed cover, adds an explosive element to a daily dose of disclosures trickling out of the Gujarat fake encounter dossier. 

 Kauser, whose husband Sohrabuddin was shot dead by police after being branded a would-be assassin, was believed to have been executed to eliminate a potential witness to the fake encounter.

 She has been killed, PTI quoted government counsel K.T.S. Tulsi and Hemantika Wahi as telling a Supreme Court bench. But Tulsi later told The Telegraph that he did not make such a comment.

 Sources, however, quoted an action taken report on the probe, submitted in the court today, as saying that the mortal remains of the so far missing 33-year-old were burnt to destroy evidence.

 Last week, the government had said that Kauser, who was pulled off a bus along with her husband in November 2005 and would have witnessed his murder in what was passed off as an encounter, might have been eliminated.

 The sources said the interrogation of three IPS officers arrested in the case revealed that the housewife was killed and her body burnt. 

 Sleuths are now trying to recover parts of the body for a DNA test. More arrests are likely, the government is believed to have said in the report.

 We are looking for any clues like clothing or footwear in some particular directions, a CID officer said about the probe in Vanzaras village Illol in Sabarkantha district. 

 If any part of Kausers body is found, it would strengthen the case against Narendra Modis blue-eyed cop D.G. Vanzara and the two other officers accused of murdering Sohrabuddin who, they claimed, was on a mission to assassinate the chief minister. 

 Sources in the state police said Vanzara was nailed by some senior officers who were sidelined.

 The chance came with the fake encounter probe. They advised the state CID chief to send a copy of the probe report to the governments counsel, who mis- took it for the official stand and presented it before the court, the sources claimed. 

 If the court orders a CBI probe, the trail could lead to at least one minister in the state, the sources said.

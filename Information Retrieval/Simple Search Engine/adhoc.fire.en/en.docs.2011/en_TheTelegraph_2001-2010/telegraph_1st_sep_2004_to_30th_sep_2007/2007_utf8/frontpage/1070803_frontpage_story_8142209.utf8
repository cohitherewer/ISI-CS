 Ranchi/Dhanbad, Aug. 2: The violence perpetrated by the Maoist guerrillas continued for the second day today with two engines of a coal laden goods train and a treetop tourist attraction in Latehar set on fire.

 The engines were burnt at about 4.30am between Demu and Richughata stations in Latehar district, and the lone resthouse at treetop of Manomar area one of the most sought after spots by tourists reduced to ashes.

 Similarly, the generator set of Reliance tower station at Manika area was set ablaze.

 Later this evening, the guerrillas opened fire on a patrol party in Amjharia ghati under Chandwa police station.

 Over 100 rounds of fire were exchanged between the police and the rebels, but there was no casualty on either side.

 According to the Dhanbad division railway authorities, a group of over 30 armed rebels changed the signal that forced the drivers of the goods train to stop between Demu and Richughata stations.

 The drivers and the guard were beaten up mercilessly. Later they set free the two drivers and torched the engine, senior RPF officials said.

 The Rs 3cr engine WDM 2 was of Patratu. It was coming from Rai station in Latehar district after loading coal and was going for the thermal power station at Obra in UP.

 Drivers U.K. Jha and J. Ahmed, who were traceless for over an hour, reported to the Latehar station though guard S. Prasad remains missing.

 The rebels had given a statewide bandh call yesterday, following the arrest of three of their colleagues by Patna police recently.

 The rebels had earlier killed a truck driver for defying their strike. Over 17 bus passengers were also injured when the rebels opened fire at three buses at Garwah district.

 Following the arson, the Dhanbad railway authorities either cancelled or diverted the routes of passenger trains fearing a backlash from the rebels.

 Even the Ranchi railway officials today diverted Hatia-Jammu Tawi Express, Jharkhand Swarnjayanti Express and Ranchi-Ajmer Express. Instead of plying through Barkakana and Daltonganj, the three trains would pass through Gomoh.

 Similarly, the Ranchi bound Inter City from Benaras would reach Ranchi tomorrow via Gomoh, and not Barkakana.

 According to state police officials, the arrest of Madan Pal by Patna police recently had unnerved the rebels since Pal was one of the main leaders who organised all operations in Bihar and Jharkhand.

 Pal is one of the senior leaders of the central committee of the party.

 The rebels organised series of meetings at the forest regions of Latehar in the wee hours of today and vowed to take revenge for the arrest of Pal. The sub zonal commander, Karimji, addressed the meetings.

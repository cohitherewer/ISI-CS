 Mamoni suffers stroke

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, Sept. 12: Novelist and peace activist Mamoni Raisom Goswami was admitted to the intensive critical care unit of a city hospital today after suffering a mild cerebral stroke.

 Doctors attending on her at the GNRC Hospitals, however, described her condition as stable.

 She is recovering now and talking to doctors and family members, a spokesperson for GNRC Hospitals, Manoj Kumar Deka, told The Telegraph.

 She is under medication and we are monitoring her condition closely. She will have to undergo certain tests either later tonight or tomorrow morning, he added.

 The 65-year-old writer who has been trying to bring the banned Ulfa to the negotiating table by acting as the mediator with the Centre was admitted to another private hospital, Nemcare, this morning after she complained of uneasiness.

 She was referred to GNRC this evening, a doctor at Nemcare said. Goswami was taken to the GNRC Hospitals around 8.30pm.

 Family sources said she could have been under stress because of constant travelling across the state to attend different functions.

 She resigned last week from the Nagarik Shanti Mancha, Asom a peace forum saying she would work more actively for the Peoples Consultative Committee (PCG) formed by Ulfa to bring the peace process back on rails.

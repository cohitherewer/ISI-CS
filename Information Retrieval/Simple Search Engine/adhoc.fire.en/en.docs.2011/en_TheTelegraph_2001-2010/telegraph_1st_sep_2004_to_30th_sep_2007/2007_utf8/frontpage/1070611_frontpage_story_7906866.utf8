 Ford game for big names

 - Supreme confidence makes up for lack of Power Point

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Graham Ford

 June 10: The mood among most Team India players is to wait and watch. However, if the seniors have even the slightest apprehension, they neednt worry.

 For one, coach-designate Graham Ford is in the know that theyve backed him. Then, during his presentation in Chennai late last evening, he told the special committee that he was aware of the teams make-up and confident of getting the best out of the seniors.

 According to The Telegraphs sources, both during the presentation and the interview which followed, the South African was a picture of supreme confidence.

 His wasnt a Power Point presentation, like John Embureys, but very high on confidence.... He didnt forget to remind the members that hed successfully handled the biggest names in the South African team between 1999 and 2002, one source said.

 It couldnt be confirmed whether the circumstances of his removal by the South African board, soon after the 2001-02 tour of Australia, came up during the interview.

 Embureys presentation was pretty adequate, too, but hed never really been a strong candidate. Despite Sunil Gavaskars support, not having coached a national team weakened his CV. 

 The Englishman, by the way, took his rejection sportingly.

 I couldnt make out who telephoned, but somebody did to convey Id not been selected.... I was disappointed, but thats the way it is.... I return to Lords (headquarters of Middlesex), while Graham prepares for a new role.... Hes a good coach and I wish him well.

 Speaking around 5 am at the Taj Connemara in Chennai, before setting out (with Ford, incidentally) to board a British Airways flight for London, Emburey added: I was given the opportunity to present my case.... The process was transparent and fair.... It wasnt as daunting as Id thought it would be....

 As expected, most of the questions were fired by the three former captains Srinivas Venkatraghavan, Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri (whose stock is currently sky high). 

 In fact, the Board of Control for Cricket in India president, Sharad Pawar (who chaired the meeting), had decided that technical matters would almost exclusively be handled by the trio.

 For Emburey, the silver lining is that last evenings experience would come in handy when he looked at options at some point in the future. With both daughters now grown up, theres no compulsion to stay in England, he pointed out. 

 Its unclear just how soon Kent will release Ford the county is hoping to hold him back but its confirmed that he wont have any role in Tuesdays selection meeting for the ODIs in Ireland-Scotland and the Test series in England.

 In any case, Ford would hardly have been in any position to contribute, remarked chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty.

 Interestingly, Fords financial package wasnt decided last evening. He has communicated what he expects to treasurer N. Srinivasan, who is going to get back with an answer.

 Greg Chappell received around $ 20,000 per month and its unlikely that Ford, whose contract with Kent is till September 2008, will settle for anything less.

 Media-shy, he declined to comment (At this stage I cant) before heading for the airport in Embureys company. Theyd arrived together as well.

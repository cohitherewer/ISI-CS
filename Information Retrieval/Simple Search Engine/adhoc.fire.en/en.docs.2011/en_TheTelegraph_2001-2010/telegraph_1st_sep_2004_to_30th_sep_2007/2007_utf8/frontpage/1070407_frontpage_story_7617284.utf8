 Govt drive to keep quota date 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 6: The Centre is expected to ask IIMs not to scrap the final list of OBC students who have cleared the admission process, hoping that a legal initiative will bear fruit and the quota can be implemented this year itself.

 The UPA and the Left have recommended after a coordination committee meeting that the government request the Supreme Court to let a larger bench look into the issue.

 Since a two-judge bench had said it is desirable to put off OBC quotas till the validity of relevant data is established, the Centre is expected to ask the court to clarify whether the observation amounted to a formal stay order. Besides, a larger, nine-judge bench had upheld the Mandal Commission recommendations based on the same data, the court will be told.

 Pending a final order, the meeting today decided to ask the Centre to direct the IIMs to keep the final list on stand-by so that successful OBC candidates can be admitted.

 In the absence of any directive, several IIMs had postponed seat hikes meant to accommodate the OBC students.

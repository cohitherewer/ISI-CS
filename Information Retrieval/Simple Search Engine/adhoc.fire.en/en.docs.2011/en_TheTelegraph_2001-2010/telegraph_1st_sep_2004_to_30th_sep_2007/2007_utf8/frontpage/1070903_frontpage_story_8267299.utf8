 Cops clueless in couple murder

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Cuttack, Sept. 2: A twin- murder inquiry has been initiated after the bodies of a 50-year-old man and his wife were discovered at a stately home.

 Police attended a call from one of the unknown residents on Mahtab Road yesterday morning and discovered the bodies of the couple in two different rooms of the two-storeyed mansion.

 Investigating officer P.K. Jena said the bodies of Arun Kumar Kar and his wife, Henna, were found by neighbours. 

 He said both were strangled to death.

 The unidentified suspects had apparently taken Kar by surprise and hit him on the head and later strangled him. 

 Kars wife saw this but the culprits strangled her to death as well.

 Kar was an ex-defence personnel. 

 The couple lived in the ground floor and their daughter was away pursuing studies outside the state. 

 While portions of the building had been rented out, expansion and construction work was in progress on the first floor.

 Police speculate that the unidentified suspects could be from among the masons and labourers engaged for the expansion and construction work who are absconding since Saturday morning also. 

 All of them hailed from Midnapore in neighbouring Bengal.

 There is a telling evidence pointing to killing the husband on the first floor where construction work was on and dragging of the body to one of the ground floor rooms, a police officer said.

 However, there is probably more to it than what meets the eye and the motive behind the murder is not clear, the officer added. 

 The police had ruled out robbery as everything was left behind untouched.

 The investigating team is looking for witnesses to the crime. 

 An electric wire and a bloodstained pillow were found from the spot.

 A forensic expert team is at work getting a lead in the case. The police dog squad has also been pressed into action. 

 The autopsy report is awaited for possible clues.

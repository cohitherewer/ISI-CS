 Wizard spell suffuses all

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Guwahati, July 21: As Potter fever gripped the world today, Guwahati was not left behind. Major bookstalls in Panbazar saw beelines of children, with parents in tow, to catch hold of a copy of the book early this morning.

 I have a collection of the entire series. Now I am excited about the last book in the series, said Surabhi Kakoti, a Class VII student of Maharishi Vidyamandir.

 Not only children, adults were also swept off their feet by Potter mania.

 Manish Choudhury, a company executive, was probably the first to buy a copy of the book from Modern Book Depot in Panbazar. Though Choudhury was late for office, he waited near the bookstall till it opened. I was sure that the bookshop would bring a few copies only. So I decided to come early and wait, he said.

 Satya Kalita, a businessman, on the other hand, has no idea as to who Harry Potter is. But he has heard so much about the book in the news that he made sure he got hold of a copy on the first day. I am simply curious to know what exactly this book is all about, he said.

 Sandeep Jalan of Oxford Bookstore, housed in Sohum Shoppe, was overwhelmed by the response. I had ordered 350 copies and given the response, we are placing a second order for 200 copies tomorrow. The bookstore sold 235 copies today.

 Western Book Depot, another leading bookstore in the city, sold more than 200 copies till late evening. This proves Guwahati is not behind the rest of the worldchildren here are keeping pace, proprietor Ramesh Kumar said.

 Rajesh Joshi, a voracious reader, was surprised by the trend, attributing it to consumerism more than literary appeal.

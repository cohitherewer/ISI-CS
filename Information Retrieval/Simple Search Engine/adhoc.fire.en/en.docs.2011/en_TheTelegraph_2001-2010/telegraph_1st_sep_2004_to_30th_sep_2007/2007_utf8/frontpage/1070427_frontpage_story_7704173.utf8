 Billion with a trillion on paper

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 26: $1,000,000,000,000.

 Better start counting fast because the party may be over before you reach the last zero.

 India has become a $1-trillion economy the decisive thrust coming from a rising rupee.

 The figure is largely a result of conversion rates and purists would dismiss it as an arithmetic rope-trick.

 But patriots among the one billion-plus Indians can rejoice: only 11 other countries in the world have gross domestic product (GDP) the value of all goods and services in a year of

 more than $1 trillion .

 Indias GDP crossed trillion dollars for the first time when the rupee appreciated to below 41 (against a dollar) yesterday, Swiss investment bank Credit Suisse said in a report.

 The bank put the countrys GDP around Rs 41,00,000 crore, a little more than $1 trillion at the current rate of Rs 40.76 per dollar. The GDP was $900 billion a month ago when the rupee was at 45.

 At $944 billion, market capitalisation on Indian stock exchanges is also close to a trillion dollars, the bank said. Market capitalisation is the total value of shares traded on the exchanges.

 Analysts said the trillion-dollar GDP augurs well for stocks. Stocks of as many as eight countries enjoyed sharp spurts after the milestone was crossed.

 All these head-spinning figures may not make much of a difference to your life, other than giving you a nagging headache.

 But consider what you can do with a trillion dollars. The amount can buy as many as 3,135 Airbus A380s the superjumbo featuring in the report at the bottom. 

 Sickened by the greed for the greenbacks? Heres a redeeming option: if you were to distribute $1 trillion evenly among the people on this planet, each would get $150 (Rs 6,000).

 However, if the rupee goes down such fluctuations occur at the drop of a hat the trillion bubble will burst.

 Another sobering thought: the US smashed the trillion barrier in 1970.

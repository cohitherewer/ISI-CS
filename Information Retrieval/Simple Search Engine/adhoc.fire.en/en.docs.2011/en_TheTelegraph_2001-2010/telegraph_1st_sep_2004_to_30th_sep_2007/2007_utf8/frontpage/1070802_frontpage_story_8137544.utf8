 Bihar botch-up on flood fund

 NISHIT DHOLABHAI

 New Delhi, Aug. 1: Flood-ravaged Bihars record in administering relief has crossed the danger mark.

 The Centre has accused the state of diverting calamity relief fund (CRF) to fixed deposits and other accounts instead of utilising it for relief and rehabilitation. 

 This comes even as the opposition RJD lambasted chief minister Nitish Kumar for visiting beaches of Mauritius while thousands were being displaced by the floods back home.

 We have told the state that relief money is not for constructing roads, et al. They have kept it in a fixed deposit, said a home ministry source.

 Out of the Rs 5,000-crore CRF for the country, Rs 157.74 crore is meant for Bihar, of which 75 per cent is states share.

 While the Centre may release its share of Rs 118.31 crore even as rivers, including Bagmati and Ganga flowed above danger level, the state is clearly caught in procedural lapses.

 They are not sending utilisation certificates and we have told them to fine tune their contingency plan, said a home ministry official involved in disaster management.

 Lapses have occurred despite a meeting of state relief commissioners with the home secretary in April, well before the onset of monsoon.

 Incidentally, the disaster management act provisions came into force only yesterday.

 As a result, it is extremely clear who is supposed to do what, indicating that it is the states responsibility to deal with the disaster locally while the Centre provides financial and logistic support.

 If Bihar does not pull up its socks it might not be able to avail in time the overall increase of 35 per cent in relief funds from the Centre, officials warned. 

 Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Assam, Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh are worst affected by the floods this year. It is Bihar though, that is drawing the flak.

 The CRF constitutes 25 per cent of the states share, which is also required to constitute a fund for relief where the money from the Centre and its own share, are kept.

 Bihar has failed to provide its own share despite reminders, complained officials.

 Aussie invincibility

 vs Lankan versatility

 Bridgetown: An

 old boxing adage that a good big fighter will always beat a

 good small one could equally apply to Saturdays World

 Cup final between defending champions Australia and Sri Lanka.

 Australia have added another dimension

 to the 50-over version of the game at the 2007 tournament which

 culminates at the Kensington Oval after seven weeks across

 eight West Indian regions.

 While justifiably proud of their

 skill-levels and a work ethic of puritanical intensity, the

 Australians have also introduced a power element which could

 sway Saturdays final at the spiritual home of Caribbean

 cricket.

 Matthew Hayden at the top of the

 order has hit three centuries and amassed the biggest run tally

 of the tournament with his brutal left-handed assaults off

 the front foot back over the bowlers head.

 His partner Adam Gilchrist has not

 fired yet but remains as potentially destructive as his opening

 partner, should his timing return. Andrew Symonds at No.5 is

 a wonderful athlete who possesses strength and finesse and

 Shane Watson, two places further down the order, can hit the

 ball as cleanly and as far as any of his teammates.

 Australia captain Ricky Ponting said

 before the tournament began that big, strong men hitting through

 the ball were changing the nature of the game. His observation

 was put into practice before Australias final first-round

 match against South Africa in St Kitts, when they devoted a

 training session with both an open and closed net to throwing

 the bat at the ball.

 Several screamed through the air

 into a sugarcane field, others threatened the safety of the

 spectators sitting in a small stand. The result was an Australian

 Cup record of 377 and an 83-run win over the then world No.1

 side.

 This is not to say the Australian

 batting is all about hitting sixes. Ponting, who practised

 against a bowling machine Friday, is in the form of his life

 and it is difficult to conceive that anybody at any time has

 batted better than the quick-footed Australian skipper. Michael

 Clarke has also batted beautifully with precise footwork complemented

 by wristy drives.

 If Sri Lanka are to beat Australia

 they must dismiss or contain the most daunting batting line-up

 around and the 1996 champions have, by common consent, the

 most varied and versatile attack in the competition.

 Lasith Malinga, who took four wickets

 in four balls against South Africa, was lethal in the semi-final

 against New Zealand with his round-arm slingers homing in on

 the batsmen at speeds consistently in excess of 145 kilometres.

 Chaminda Vaas continues to delight

 the purists by getting out class batsmen with immaculate swing

 bowling at a modest pace. Muttiah Muralidharan can simultaneously

 restrict and attack with his rubber-wristed off-spinners and

 the doosra, which snakes in the opposite direction.

 The batting on the slow Caribbean

 pitches where the bounce gets lower as the day progresses depends

 heavily on Sanath Jayasuriya, who does not need the ball coming

 on to him fast to score quickly. Otherwise, the Sri Lankans

 lack the power of the Australians to hit the ball over the

 top.

 Jayasuriyaalso seemed game for a

 verbal battle. Daring opponents to hurl bouncers at him, Jayasuriya

 said: It doesnt matter what they bowl to me. I

 have been around long enough in international cricket to face

 any sort of bowling. If they bounce me, I can pull and hook

 as well.

 Light showers, though, could interrupt

 Saturdays final.

 Mahela Jayawardene said they will

 not veer from their usual gameplan. The most important

 thing for us is to play the brand of cricket that we have been

 playing, he said. That is the best way to beat

 any side in the world.

 As Ponting is quick to acknowledge,

 no team is impregnable and one day the unbeaten Australian

 run at World Cups, which stretches back to the 1999 tournament

 will end. Australia are doing everything in their power to

 ensure Saturday is not that day.

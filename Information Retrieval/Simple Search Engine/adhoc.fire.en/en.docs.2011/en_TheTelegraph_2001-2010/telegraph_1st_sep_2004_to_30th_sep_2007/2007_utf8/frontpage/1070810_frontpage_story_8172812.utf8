 Poser on I-Day man of honour

 KUMUD JENAMANI

 Jamshedpur, Aug. 9: The deputy commissioner-cum-district election officer has asked the chief election commissioner if a minister could hoist the Tricolour during a government-sponsored Independence Day celebration.

 With Independence Day five days away, and the Jamshedpur by-election also round the corner, the district administration is pondering if a minister hoisting the flag during the Independence Day celebrations would amount to a violation of the model code of conduct.

 If the answer from New Delhi is a no, then the deputy commissioner can hoist the national flag during the function, scheduled to be held at Regal grounds. 

 East Singhbhum deputy commissioner Nitin Madan Kulkarni said it has not been decided who would get the honour this year. It has not been decided who will hoist the flag during the Independence Day celebrations. We have written to the chief election commissioner seeking advice on the issue, he said.

 The administration is concerned about the issue and has to clear the doubt, as it has to prepare to observe the occasion successfully, he added. 

 Sources in the deputy commissioners office said orders to print invitation cards for the I-Day event has not been given in the face of this confusion. The name of revenue and land reforms minister Dulal Bhuiyan (in pic) has cropped up as a contender to be the chief guest. The DC is not in favour of rushing to a conclusion and selecting the chief guest, said an official. To be on the safe side, he added, Kulkarni has referred the matter to the CEC.

 Hoisting the national flag during I-Day happens to be a matter of great pride for a minister with a local tag. Bhuiyan could be given the privilege to hoist the Tricolour during the event. But the by-election for the parliamentary seat has proved to be an obstacle in this issue. The model code of conduct, declared in view of the by-election, seems to have upset Bhuiyans prospects for the great scene. This I-Day could have been an unforgettable one for Bhuiyan and his relatives otherwise.

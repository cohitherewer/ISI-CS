 NSCN-K 

makes light 

of flushout

 OUR BUREAU

 Itanagar/Guwahati, April 29: The Khaplang faction of the NSCN today pooh-poohed Delhis efforts to clear out its camps and flush out Ulfa militants from Myanmar, claiming that the military junta in that country would not fully co-operate with Indian security forces. 

 It also distanced itself from Ulfa as far as mutual logistical arrangements within Myanmar are concerned. The NSCN (K) said the Assam outfit had already shifted to the Kachin area from Sagaing division of Myanmar. 

 A spokesman for the NSCN (K), Wangmi Pangmei, told The Telegraph that his organisation still had respect and regard for Ulfa and its revolutionary cause, but there was no tie-up of the kind that is often alluded to by Indian security and intelligence agencies. 

 We have a lot of respect and regard for Ulfa because both of us are revolutionary forces. We support each others causes. But there is no personnel and materiel support to them from our end. In fact, they have moved from Sagain to Kachin. They do not share camps with us, Pangmei said from Changlang, where he heads a unit of the outfit that is operating in two districts of Arunachal Pradesh. The other district is Tirap. 

 On reports of an impending joint military operation by India and Myanmar to flush out Northeast militants holed up across the border, the NSCN (K) said such an offensive would be unable to replicate the success of Operation All Clear in Bhutan. 

 It argued that unlike Ulfa and NDFB militants, Naga rebels were not aliens but an integral part of that country. 

 He was specifically reacting to the Myanmar military administrations assurance last week that it has accepted Delhis request to flush out militants of the Northeast from its territory. 

 Please dont be fooled by these reports. Myanmar will never work according to Delhis will. We dont think there will be much co-operation from Myanmar. India may have succeeded in Bhutan but the reasons there were different. Unlike Ulfa militants, who could be easily tracked down because of their language and physical features, we Nagas are part and parcel of Myanmars history. No matter which side of the international border we Nagas live in, nobody will be successful in crushing our aspirations, the spokesman said.

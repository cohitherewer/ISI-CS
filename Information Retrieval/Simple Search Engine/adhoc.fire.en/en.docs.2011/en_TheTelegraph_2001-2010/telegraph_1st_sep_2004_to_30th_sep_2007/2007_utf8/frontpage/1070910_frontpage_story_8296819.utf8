 Red cache of arms recovered 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bokaro, Sept. 9: Bokaro police have seized a cache of arms and ammunition, including looted rifles of Giridih police in Jharkhand, besides landmines and dozens of police uniform.

 Gomia inspector P.K. Mishra, who tops the Maoist hitlist, led a team to Nawadih, considered a safe bastion of the red, today noon to recover 14 boxes carrying four rifles of Giridih police, seven landmines, dozens of gelatine rods and more than 200 rounds of ammunition, besides police badges and belts.

 Deputy inspector-general of police (coalbelt) Anurag Gupta confirmed the seizure.

 It is definitely a prize catch, said inspector-general V.B. Pradhan.

 Sources said the police had also seized several mobile phones, whose call details could give startling clues to Maoist operations.

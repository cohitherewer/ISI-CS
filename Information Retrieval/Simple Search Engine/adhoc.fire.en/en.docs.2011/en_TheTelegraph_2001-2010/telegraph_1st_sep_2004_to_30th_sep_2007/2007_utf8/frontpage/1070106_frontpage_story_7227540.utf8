 None at crease, Sourav to rescue

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Cape Town, Jan. 5: Sourav Ganguly may have kept Steve Waugh waiting at the toss during that memorable 2001 series, but the former captain had no plans to hold up the third and final Test at pretty Newlands this morning. 

 For absolutely no fault of his, Sourav actually came close to becoming the first batsman in Test crickets 130-year history to be timed out. Thankfully, his CV wont have such a dubious entry. 

 While all four umpires Daryl Harper and Asad Rauf on the field, Marais Erasmus (TV/third) and Murray Brown (fourth) erred by assuming a lot many things, its surprising that the Team India management was also caught napping.

 The drama began when Wasim Jaffer got out to Makhaya Ntini on the second ball of the third over. That was at 10.43 am, 13 minutes after the start of Day IV, and just a couple of deliveries after Virender Sehwags dismissal.

 In normal circumstances, that wouldve been the signal for regular No. 4 Sachin Tendulkar to walk out of the shadows. Instinctively, he headed for the stairs but was told by Brown that he could only bat after 10.48, to compensate for the 18 minutes hed been off before stumps the previous evening. 

 Brown had, a few minutes earlier, reminded the Indian dressing room about it.

 It was done late, yes, but its not clear whether Sachin was informed. According to Harper, the reminder was given solely to ensure there was no misunderstanding.

 The senior Elite Panel umpire put it thus: There are 42 laws, no more.... The players are responsible for their actions and ought to be aware.... The reminder was given to avoid a misunderstanding.... I certainly didnt convey that to the Indians at the start of the (second) innings as I didnt want them to have a negative mindset.

 Harper added: I dont know who keeps a note of these things in the Indian dressing room, but usually the managers do. Indeed, managers do so in a professional set-up. Where the Indian team is concerned, that post is handed out as a favour. 

 With Sachin barred, V.V.S. Laxman should have gone out. The vice-captain, however, was either in the shower (Souravs explanation) or in the toilet wearing the abdominal guard (as a source pointed out)! 

 There was chaos in the dressing room is what The Telegraphs source revealed, but coach Greg Chappell had the presence of mind to quickly ask Sourav, whod been standing closest, to take Jaffers place.

 I was in my track suit and didnt have the time to prepare... There was no time for thoughts, I had to rush, Sourav said. He took guard six minutes after Jaffers exit, but did a grand job. 

 On the field, meanwhile, the South Africans were agitated. Whats the rule? Whats the rule? asked senior-most pro Shaun Pollock. In the midst of all that (the crowd had begun slow hand-clapping), Harper requested captain Graeme Smith to uphold the spirit of the game and not appeal for a timed out.

 Smith agreed after it was explained why the circumstances had become exceptional. His attention was also drawn to New Zealands poor example on the recent Muttiah Muralidharan issue.

 Sourav fell for 46, but not before crossing 200 runs (average of 42-plus) in his comeback series. His total of 214 is the highest for India and has given a reminder that he still has much to offer.

 Its taken for granted that Sourav is going to make his one-day comeback later this month.

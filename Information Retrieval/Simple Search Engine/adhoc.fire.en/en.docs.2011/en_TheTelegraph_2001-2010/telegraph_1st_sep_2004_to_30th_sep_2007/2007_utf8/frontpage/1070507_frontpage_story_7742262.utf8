 Mums the word for Koda

 SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA 

 Ranchi, May 6: Mouths sealed at home, chief minister Madhu Koda will only do the talking with the central leaderships of the Congress, the JMM and the RJD and reply to the allegations of the second grade leaders. 

 Koda said he will soon visit Delhi to apprise the central UPA leaders of the ground realities in the state and answer the scathing remarks of Union minister of state for food processing (independent charge) Subodh Kant Sahay. 

 I believe in doing my job peacefully than indulging in quarrels. All major decisions taken by my government had the consent of top UPA bosses in Delhi. If need be, I will soon go to Delhi to apprise the superiors of the ground realities, he said. 

 Sahay had stirred a hornets nest on Saturday when he commented that there was no government in Jharkhand, adding that the state cannot achieve growth rate targets under Kodas leadership. 

 Sahay, though, stuck to his guns even today and said that though the Congress had succeeded in installing a secular government in Jharkhand, the Koda governments performance was quite disheartening. It has not only failed to avail funds provided by the Centre but also misutilised whatever was available. 

 He also alleged that the UPA partners were not being consulted during the transfers and posting of officials. The chief minister had not only failed to build a team of efficient officials, he had even not held routine cabinet meetings for the last three weeks or so, Sahay had thundered. 

 Talking about his own achievements, the Union minister, who represents Ranchi in the Lok Sabha, said that as a public representative, he has been struggling hard to solve the drinking water problem in the state capital. It is because of his sustained efforts during the last three years, he further said, over 56 syntex tanks have been installed in different parts of his consitutency.

 But we can not interfere in the routine functioning of the state government. We havent received a single proposal for the food processing units after the Koda government came to power. It has even failed to provide lands for the projects that have already been approved during the last financial year, Sahay added. 

 Insiders claim Sahay was unhappy because Koda dumped his recommendations related to transfer-posting of officials. 

 On an average we receive over half-a-dozen letters on Sahays letterhead everyday. These letters are being endorsed to officials concerned without delay, but it is not possible to follow each of them, an official at the secretariat said.

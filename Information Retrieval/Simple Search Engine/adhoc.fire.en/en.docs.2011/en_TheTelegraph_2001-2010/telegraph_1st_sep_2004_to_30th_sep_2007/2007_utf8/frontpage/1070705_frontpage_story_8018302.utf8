 3 hurt in Guwahati explosion

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Guwahati, July 4: Three persons were injured, two of them seriously, when an improvised explosive device exploded inside a running autorickshaw on S.R. Bora lane near Bora Service here at 7.50pm today. 

 The injured were identified as Subhash Chandra Banik, 58, Purnima Gogoi, 49, and Sewali Devi. 

 Police said Banik, a resident of Kalapahar, was driving the autorickshaw. Gogoi was the passenger. 

 Both of them have been admitted to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital. Sewali Devi, a bystander, has been admitted to Nemcare Hospital.

 Baniks condition is said to be critical. According to doctors, one of his legs may have to be amputated, a police source said. 

 He said Purnima Gogoi, wife of one Lachit Gogoi, stays in a rented house in Lachitnagar. The couple hails from Upper Assam. 

 Prima facie evidence suggests that the bomb was in the autorickshaw and either the driver or the passenger was carrying it. 

 Witnesses said a few others were also injured.

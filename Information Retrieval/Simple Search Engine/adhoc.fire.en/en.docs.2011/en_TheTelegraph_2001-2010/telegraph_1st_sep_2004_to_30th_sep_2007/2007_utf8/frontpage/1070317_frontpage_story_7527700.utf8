 Buses amp; trains hit by bandh

 OUR BUREAU

 March 16: Train and bus services from Ranchi and Jamshedpur to Bengal were affected following the 12-hour bandh in Bengal in protest against the Nandigram violence.

 In Ranchi, about 20 buses plying daily to different destinations in Bengal, including Calcutta, did not operate at all. While 10 of these buses were slated to leave Ranchi last night, an equal number were supposed to depart this morning.

 The bus owners refunded the money and suffered huge loses, but who wants to take the risk, said Ranchi Bus Service Association president Krishna Mohan Singh.

 Railway sources said Howrah-Ranchi Shatabdi Express was cancelled. But Hatia-Bankura passenger and Hatia-Howrah Express via Ranchi, Muri and Tatanagar left as usual.

 The trains witnessed rush, as buses did not ply. Demand for berths in Hatia-Howrah Express shot up, said railway reservation officials.

 Four trains plying through Pakur were cancelled, including Howrah-Darbhanga and Rampurhat-Sahebganj passengers.

 Many trains coming from Patna were reported running several hours late. Howrah-Barbil Janshatabdi was cancelled and Howrah-Kurla Express was terminated at the Tatanagar station. Tata-Chhapra Express was stranded at Burnpur. Special arrangements were made for cancellation of tickets at Tatanagar.

 Ranchi, May 13: The vandalism shown by local vegetable vendors at the four newly opened Reliance Fresh outlets in Jharkhand capital Ranchi yesterday has not acted as deterrent to the companys plans here.

 Reliance Digital and Reliance HyperMarket will be the new entrants in the states capital soon.

 Our plan is to open one outlet in every 3,000 household in the country and Ranchi will be also part of this process, said top officials of Reliance from Mumbai. 

 So far, customers are only availing fruits, vegetables and other eatables, but now they would get an opportunity to pick up garments with a new avatar, they added. The Reliance officials informed that a new outlet would come up at Bahu Bazaar for non-vegetarian items.

 Reliance Fresh today carried out its business as usual in the three of its four outlets in the city. The outlets at SPG Mart in Bahu Bazaar, Laxmi Narayan Market at Tharpakhana and Rathore Tower on Circular Road.

 The Morabadi outlet, however, could not function because the vegetable vendors had yesterday damaged it badly during their protest against venture of big companies in vegetable and fruit retailing.

 Company officials at this outlet were seen busy assessing the damage with insurance company surveyors throughout the day.

 Police, who could not act promptly yesterday, too, were seen on vigil.

 Despite being a Sunday and court being closed, the city police did not delay in producing the miscreants, who were caught inciting violence at different outlets of the city, before chief judicial magistrate at his residence, and later forwarding them to Birsa Munda Central Jail. 

 Those arrested include a peace committee member and Jharkhand Vikas Morcha leader Uday Shanker Ojha, who had led the vegetable vendors.

 Meanwhile, some vendors carried out their business today defying the bandh called by their leaders, while some did not turn up anticipating police action.

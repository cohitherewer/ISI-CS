 Abducted officers driver freed

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, April 22: The militant group behind the abduction of the executive director of Food Corporation of Indias Northeast office, P.C. Ram, today freed his driver somewhere in Lower Assam.

 Rabiram Basumatary, who went missing along with Ram while driving back home from their Guwahati office on April 17, reached a police station shortly after dusk. Additional superintendent of police (city) Rajen Singh confirmed to The Telegraph that he was freed and in police custody. 

 Singh declined to divulge more, including the name of the police station where Basumatary went. 

 A source said the driver was freed in Baksa district. A team of police officials from Guwahati, including Singh and superintendent of police (special operations unit) Jitmol Doley, left for Baksa immediately to bring the driver back to the city.

 The police have found evidence of Ulfas hand in the abduction. They have also intercepted telephone calls indicating that Ram is in Baksa district. 

 Ulfa reportedly called Rams family and demanded Rs 21 crore in ransom.

 Smile to shock

 How the sentencing played itself out from 1.10pm in the special court, Arthur Road Jail, Mumbai

 Sanjay Dutts friend Russi Mulla is given probation. A smile creases the actors

 face. Judge Pramod Kode then turns to Sanjay

 Kode: Sanjay

 Dutt made Mulla an offender by asking him to destroy

 an illegal weapon....The 

 case of Mulla and the other three (Sanjay, Yusuf Nullwala

 and Kersi Adajania) are different.

 (Sanjay looks up, mood changes,

 the first sign of panic sets in. Kode asks the actor

 to step forward.

 Sanjays lawyer pleads

 for leniency, citing family tragedies, including wifes

 death.) 

 Kode: Wifes

 death is reason for sympathy, but cannot be a reason

 for granting relief. One definitely has the right

 to defend ones family, but not illegally.

 (Kode begins reading out

 thesentence, punctuating it with comments.) 

 Kode: Sanjay

 Dutt was a mature man of 33 when he committed the

 offence. He committed a chain of crimes. 

 (Kode notes the actors

 presence at a party for Feroz Khans film Yalgaar

 that was thrown by Dawood Ibrahims family.

 He also mentions that the actor had bought an illegal

 pistol with D-companys help a year before

 acquiring the AK-56.)

 Kode: Possessing

 an AK-56 illegally is no mean offence. Acquiring such

 weapons shows scant respect for the law. It is an

 eminently dangerous act. With the punishment of a minimum

 of five years and maximum of 10 years it can in no

 way be a minor offence or of a less grave nature.

 (Kode then delivers thesentence.

 A shaken Sanjay asks to be allowed to come to the witness

 box and speak.) 

 Kode: You may do so. 

 Sanjay

 (with folded hands): Thank you Sir. Sir,

 I made a mistake 14 years ago. Please give me some

 time to surrender. 

 Kode: Everybody

 makesmistakes. Your crime was not brutal, cruel, ghastly,

 inhuman, not anti-social, not immoral and did not result

 in any harm to anyone. But it still is a serious offence

 and can encourage others to break the law. Laws of

 the nation come first. And under the law, I cannot

 grant more time to you to surrender. 

 Kode

 to police: Take him

 into custody, his bail plea stands rejected. 

 Sanjay

 (in tears): Sir, I

 am no hardened criminal. I have not done anything

 wrong in these past years. Please ask the police

 not to surround me right away. I would like to

 make a call to my daughter, if you allow.

 (Daughter Trishala, a student of clinical psychology, is now in New York.) 

 Kode: All right. You may call your daughter. There is nothing in the law that stops you from doing so. 

 Sanjay: Sir, I owe you more than I owe my family. 

 (Defence counsel Farhana Shah seeks time for arguments on granting Sanjay time to surrender. The judge agrees and adjourns the court till after lunch. The court reconvenes at 2.45pm. 

 (Sanjay is a bit more collected and stands in the witness box.) 

 Sanjay: Sir, to be honest, I thought I would get probation. Thats why I did not come prepared. I will be grateful if you grant me some time. 

 Kode: That is not legal, I cannot do so. I cannot violate the law. 

 Sanjay: I am tired, Sir. 

 Kode: I have no choice. 

 Sanjay: Sir, my sister (Priya) is pregnant. I want to speak to my family. Please, Sir. 

 Kode: All right. 

 (Kode asks court officials to arrange for a meeting. As Sanjay prepares to leave the courtroom escorted by policemen, Kode speaks.)

 Kode: Dont be sentimental. You utilised your time outside the jail constructively. And made a big name for yourself in your field. Be calm and quiet. You have a long way to go. Your lawyers will guide you. You have already spent one-and-a-half years of your jail term. The rest of the years will fly in no time. Your career will go even farther. Your father acted in Munnabhai and looked better than you. Be like Gregory Peck. Act till you are 100 years. 

 (In tears, Sanjay leaves the courtroom under police escort.)

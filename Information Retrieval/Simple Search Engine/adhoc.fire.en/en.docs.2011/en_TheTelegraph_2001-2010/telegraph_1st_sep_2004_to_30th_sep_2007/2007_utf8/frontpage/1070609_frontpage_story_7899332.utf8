 Amit does an SRK

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

 Leeds, June 8: If you had fallen prey to the new Dons Temptations, get ready for the original Dons Unforgettable tour. 

 After being on the other end in Don and KBC, for the first time, Amitabh Bachchan is trying to do a Shah Rukh Khan.

 Today in the Oulton Hotel, where he is staying for the IIFA Weekend, Amitabh announced the Unforgettable world tour commencing in April 2008. 

 This is a direct retort to Shah Rukhs Temptations world tour which has been immensely popular in the last couple of years.

 And if there are doubts about Bachchans jab at SRK, well the line-up of stars in his team confirms the obvious.

 Besides the Big B, son Abhishek and daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai will take the stage alongside the likes of Bipasha Basu, Lara Dutta and Riteish Deshmukh.

 The gang does not feature a single Bollywood star who has been a part of Temptations like Rani Mukherji, Preity Zinta, Zayed Khan and SaifAli Khan.

 When The Telegraph quizzed Bachchan why none of the Khans featured inthe group of biggest Bollywood stars, the IIFA brand ambassador smiled and said: Arent we enough?

 Earlier, he had admitted that the world tour was entirely his brainchild and Wizcraft, the company behind IIFA, was simply executing his big idea.

 The last time Bachchan was on a world tour was way back in 1983 when he had done the Kalyanji Anandji tour the highlight of which was his on-stage chemistry with wife Jaya Bachchan. 

 This time too, as he travels six continents, it will be a totally home set-up with Abhishek and Ash giving him company.

 As expected, just like last year in Dubai, Shah Rukh has given this years IIFA a miss. 

 Interestingly, he was just two hours away from Yorkshire in London yesterday for the auction of a painting by M.F. Husain. 

 According to a Wizcraft spokesperson, Shah Rukh was very much invited for the eighth edition of the Bollywood Oscars but till late on Friday evening, he was nowhere to be seen in the county of white roses.

 Now dont be surprised if Shah Rukh starts his own international Bollywood awards ceremony some time soon.

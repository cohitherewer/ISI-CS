 Techie offered guards job

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Cuttack, Sept. 9: Gopalkrushna could not probably think that he would have to do a night watchmans job after finishing his engineering degree.

 But he was not given another opportunity. Taking his case in account, the Orissa State Administrative Tribunal has expressed anguish over the lack of application of mind by the government in offering Gopalkrushna Mahanta, a BE (mechanical), the job of a night watchman at a school under the rehabilitation scheme after the death of his father, a primary schoolteacher.

 The tribunal bench, comprising vice-chairman Haraprasad Das and K.M. Patnaik, has sought clarification from the school and mass education department while ordering for a status quo last week, pending disposal of the case.

 Gopalkrushna had filed a petition seeking intervention of the tribunal for ensuring a job at least on a par with that in which his father was serving till his death.

 According to the petition, Lalit Mohan Mahanta, his father, was a teacher at Narayanpur Primary School under Parlakhemundi education circle in Gajapati district. He died in 2001.

 Gopalpkrushna had then completed Plus Two in science. After nearly six years he received an order in May this year to join as night watchman at a government girls school. He was asked to report on duty before June 21. By then he had completed BE (mechanical) from Biju Patnaik University of Technology.

 The petition claimed that the school and mass education department was duly informed about his latest qualification during an interview session in May.

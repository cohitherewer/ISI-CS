 Beat a student? Pay the price

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, Aug. 3: Schools where teachers beat children may soon have to pay huge compensation to the victims.

 A new law aims to increase the punishment for those who abuse children physically or sexually in schools and correctional or child-care homes, and force them to cough up large sums in damages.

 The money is likely to come in the form of a fixed deposit that the child can access once he or she turns 18.

 The compensation will usually be shared by the institution and the guilty person, but the responsibility will lie with the institution. That is, if the person convicted is unable to pay, the institution may have to shell out the entire sum.

 The new law will also significantly raise the jail term from the six months provided by the Juvenile Justice Act of 2000, and may put the institutions licence under the scanner.

 Child abuse is rampant in schools and childrens homes. A schoolboy in Rajasthans Udaipur died on Wednesday night allegedly after being beaten by his teacher.

 The law, being drafted by the women and child development ministry with help from NGOs and the law ministry, has segments inspired by legislation in other countries.

 The idea of compensation is borrowed from Sri Lanka, which strengthened its child abuse laws after a string of paedophilia cases against foreign tourists, including sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke.

 Lawyers working on the new law said the concept of monetary compensation for children does not exist in India.

 Besides, compensation for a crime, apart from the legal expenses, is paid only in civil cases. So, even an adult victim needs to fight a separate civil case to win damages after winning a criminal case.

 Now, if child abuse is proved against a school or juvenile protection home, the victim will be eligible for compensation at the end of the criminal case if the nature of the abuse so demands.

 As soon as a court convicts a man or woman of child abuse, its next step would be to announce a compensation for the victim depending on the nature of the crime, a senior official said.

 Sri Lankan experts said in their country, compensation often runs into millions, especially in sexual abuse cases.

 The child doesnt need to suffer the trauma of another (civil) case. Its the childs right, and the idea has worked wonderfully in our country, Rohan Wijeysena, a lawyer with Sri Lankas National Child Protection Authority, said over the phone from Colombo.

 The idea for the law came after a government report earlier this year found that two of every three Indian children face corporal punishment, and 70 per cent of correctional home inmates are beaten.

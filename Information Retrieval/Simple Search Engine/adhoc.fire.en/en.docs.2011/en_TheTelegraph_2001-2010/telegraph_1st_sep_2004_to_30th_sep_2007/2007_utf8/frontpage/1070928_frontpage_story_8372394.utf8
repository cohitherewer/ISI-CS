 Indian idol fans clash with locals at Siliguri

 Siliguri.Sept.27 (PTI): Several persons were injured as a procession by fans of Indian idol Prashant Tamang clashed with locals. Thousands of locals chased the 2000-odd processionists from Hasmi Chowk to the nearby Siliguri court- compound. The spot then turned into a battlefield with both sides hurling stones at each other, Inspector- General, North Bengal, R J S Nawla said.

 Rapid action force personnel cordoned off the area as a large police force went to the spot but the stone pelting still continued, Nawla said, while appealing to both sides to maintain amity and communal harmony.

 The IG said that trouble began when an ambulance, with a patient, tried to move through the procession but was intercepted. In the ensuing altercation, local people allegedly beat the patient and those accompanying him sparking off protests.

 As the processionists then began ransacking adjoining shops, more local people assembled and situation worsened further.

 Earlier, a procession was taken out in protest against alleged derogatory comments by a radio jockey in Delhi against Indian idol winner Prashant Tamang.

 CPI leader salvo on Posco project

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, May 27: The anti-Posco agitation got a boost today with CPI MP and Aituc general secretary Gurudas Dasgupta demanding that the plant project be scrapped.

 The project should not be allowed to be established in the state at any cost as it would accentuate poverty, said the veteran leader while addressing a convention organised here by Aituc to oppose the Posco project.

 Dasgupta said he did not want the Posco project to be relocated to some other site, but wanted it shelved forever. 

 We oppose the establishment of the 12-million-tonne steel plant project on farmlands as it would result in the displacement of the resident there and loss of their livelihood, the Aituc leader said.

 The compensation being planned is not adequate for the sustenance of the displaced, he said, and this would only help perpetuate poverty.

 Mega industrial projects should not be located in densely populated and fertile areas because that will lead to massive displacement and related problems apart from the loss of livelihood. Such projects should be set up on barren and non-irrigated patches, he said. 

 Inhabitants of three gram panchayats in Ersama block in Jagatsinghpur are expected to lose their land because of the Posco project. For 23 months, the South Korean steel major has been planing to establish the mega project on lands here. But the plant would eat lands on which betel, cashew nut and prawns are cultivated.

 The Aituc functionary said they were opposed to Indias biggest FDI project as the only motive of the foreign investors is profit, and not the so-called development of the state. We are also opposed to SEZs since they will virtually become a foreign territory, where the law of land will not be in force, he said calling for a state-wide stir by Aituc activists.

 Stating that Posco can be a national issue, the CPI MP promised to raise the issue in Parliament.

 The Aituc state unit general secretary, Souribandhu Kar, said they were planning to hold four more conventions. 

 The events would be held in Paradip, Bhubaneswar, Sambalpur and Balasore next month. After that, a demonstration would be organised before the Parliament as a mark of protest.

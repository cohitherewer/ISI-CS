 Bangla vows to nab Paresh Baruah

 NISHIT DHOLABHAI 

 New 

 Delhi, Aug. 3: Bangladesh today admitted for the 

 first time that Ulfa commander-in-chief Paresh Barua was 

 on its territory and even promised to track down the man 

 who is heard but never seen. 

 As the two-day home secretary-level summit drew to a close in the capital, it was clear that the ice was thawing between India and a recalcitrant neighbour that has been loath to admit the presence of militants. 

 The Bangladesh delegation, led by home secretary Mohammed Abdul Karim, promised action against all militant groups using that country as a base to destabilise India, particularly the Northeast. The big surprise was the promise to trace the fugitive chief of Ulfas armed wing.

 The visiting team said Barua was arrested in 2002 and released the very next year at the insistence of the Bangladesh Human Rights Commission. He jumped bail and has since been elusive.

 Another Ulfa leader, general secretary Anup Chetia, was lodged in a Bangladesh jail for some years and released in 2006 when his term ended, sources quoted the delegation as saying. 

 Both sides agreed to expedite inter-ministerial consultations on the proposed extradition and mutual legal assistance treaties in criminal matters and a bilateral agreement on combating international terrorism, organised crime and trafficking. 

 It would, as a senior Union home ministry official put it, end the rather ineffective practice of simply exchanging lists of terrorists fugitives and usher in a dynamic style of functioning. This will be augmented by the revival of the Joint Working Group.

 The home ministry official disclosed that India might soon be able to begin fencing within 150 yards of the border, hitherto a contentious issue. 

 Home secretary Madhukar Gupta told the media after the talks ended that an institutional mechanism a fourth tier had been added to the three-level mechanism evolved to increase cooperation between the two countries. 

 The three tiers that have been in existence since 1994 include consultations between Bangladesh Rifles and Border Security Force officials, meetings of the Joint Working Group comprising the joint secretaries of home affairs and home secretary-level talks. 

 Gupta described the fourth layer as a fundamental change in the negotiations between the two countries. 

 A source pointed out that on earlier occasions, acceptance of the fact that militants from India were operating from that country was almost unthinkable. Now that Bangladesh has a new political dispensation, there is a clear willingness to act, he said.

 Karim said there was also a discussion on how Bangladeshis illegally staying in India could be legally deported. Assam recently witnessed a surge of migrants of suspected Bangladeshi origin, all of them expelled from neighbouring states. The Congress government has since certified the majority of these people as Indian citizens.

 Sleepless night in cell

 GAUTAM SARKAR

 Dumka, Jan. 6: The first night in Jharkhand after spending almost a month in Tihar jail in Delhi was not a pleasant experience for JMM chief Shibu Soren. 

 He spent a sleepless night in the special ward of Dumka central jail shivering in cold. Worse, he complained of uneasiness in the small hours of today. The timely arrival of jail doctor, however, saved the prison authorities from blushes.

 Soren, shifted to Dumka central jail from Jamtara district jail last evening, entered his cell around 8.30 pm. After he complained restlessness around 2.40 am, the jail sentinels rushed to his cell and found him shivering. After an alarm by the sentinels, jail authorities summoned the jail doctor, Dilip Keshri.

 I rushed to Sorens cell from the Sadar hospital. His blood pressure was abnormal. I asked the jail personnel to arrange for some firewood and massaged him with oil, Keshri said. 

 According to the doctor, the big windows in the special cell were not properly covered. Thus, the room turned cold, he said. The JMM chief was also tired because of the travel from Delhi to Dumka via Dhanbad and Jamtara, the doctor said. 

 In a damage control exercise this morning, the jail authorities engaged a group of plumbers to cover the windows. 

 The special cell having two rooms was given a facelift at the eleventh hour in view of Sorens arrival. 

 We had virtually no time to make proper arrangements, said a senior district administration official. 

 Keshri, who examined Soren this morning again, found him normal. However, he advised a thorough check-up by a panel of doctors. 

 On his recommendation, the district administration has constituted a panel comprising the civil surgeon, who would ensure his regular check-up on the jail premises. 

 Soren was, however, looking fresh this morning when he appeared before his admirers. A smiling Soren waved at his supporters from the window of the visiting room inside the central jail. 

 Meanwhile, the court of additional district judge, Arun Kumar, today sought an explanation from Jamtara jail in-charge Uday Kumar Kushwaha for allowing Soren to shift to Dumka ignoring the courts direction to lodge him in the Jamtara jail.

 A Nandigram test, far away

 DHIRENDRA K. JHA

 The Up Poll Boiler 

 Ferozabad, April 6: 

 The CPM is already fighting the Nandigram election in a 

 corner of Uttar Pradesh.

 As the partys loudspeakers 

 rain promises in working-class hub Ferozabad, which votes 

 tomorrow in the polls first phase, Hamid Ubaidullah 

 curls his lips.

 There they kill us; here 

 they want our vote, says the bangle factory worker 

 as he finishes his lunch and stands up, ready to rejoin 

 his shift.

 Hamid isnt the only voter 

 here torn between the reality of the death of villagers 

 1,300 km away in CPM- ruled Bengal and what he suspects 

 are illusory pro-worker assurances of the local 

 Marxist candidate, Mukesh Yadav.

 Ferozabad and its twin constituency 

 Tundla, both held by the Samajwadi Party, could give the 

 CPM an idea, however faint, of the political costs of Nandigram 

 in the first election it faces after the March 14 flare-up.

 At first sight, though, the predominantly 

 rural Nandigram seems to have little in common with these 

 two constituencies, both dotted by bangle and glass factories. 

 Only about a fourth of Ferozabads population, and 

 a half of Tundlas, is rural and land wars hardly strike 

 a chord among them.

 But the voters and the candidates 

 are acutely aware of a similarity. Muslims make up more 

 than 30 per cent of the population in Ferozabad and Tundla 

 marginally less than Nandigrams 35-40 per cent.

 The issue for the voters here 

 is mainly the emotive one of villagers being gunned down. 

 What the distance has done is exaggerate the extent of the 

 violence. Many claim to know that the actual 

 number of people killed on March 14 is over a hundred.

 Pavez, a bangle worker from Tundla, 

 is not as bitter as Hamid. Something is wrong somewhere. 

 Either all this (the Nandigram violence) is just a rumour 

 or the CPM is behaving like any other party, he says.

 Its anybodys guess 

 how the CPM might have fared even without the shadow of 

 Nandigram looming over it. 

 The CPM is contesting these two 

 seats for the first time after having diligently built a 

 strong base in the past few years.

 But the Samajwadi Party is already 

 reeling under an anti-incumbency wave, fuelled by crime 

 and lack of development. Although the Bahujan Samaj Party 

 is the favourite in both seats, not too many would have 

 been surprised if the Marxists came second.

 The CPM and the Samajwadi Party 

 dont contest against each other in seats where one 

 of them is very strong.

 Local CPM leaders dismiss the 

 Nandigram factor.

 It isnt like that. 

 Nandigram is not being debated at all. The workers and the 

 villagers have full faith in us. Our rallies and street-corner 

 meetings have been much better than those of other parties, 

 says Daulat Ram, Citu leader and CPM candidate from Tundla.

 District party leader Nawal Singh, 

 who is overseeing the Ferozabad campaign, echoes him.

 Minors raped in Guwahati

 - Muted screams from stadium amp; PCO 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, Jan. 3: From Noida to Guwahati, sexual perverts are preying on minors like never before.

 Two girls, one nine years old and the other a mere five, were raped in the Assam capital since last evening. In both cases, persons known to the victims committed the crime.

 The first incident took place in a ladies toilet at Nehru Stadium, usually abuzz with sports activities but deathly silent when a 51-year-old employee of the Board of Sports forced himself on his nine-year-old neighbour around 6.30 pm yesterday. Sulav Charan Mohanty, the supervisor of the R.G. Baruah Sports Complex and a grandfather, has been absconding since 2.30 am. 

 His family members wife, two daughters, sons-in-law, two sons and grandchildren have had to pay for his crime. Police have detained the entire family.

 The second incident occurred at Bagheswari, under Dispur police station, today. The accused, 26-year-old Rabi Sarma, allegedly raped the five-year-old victim in the PCO where he works. The girls mother works in a beauty parlour in the same area and was away when the incident occurred.

 Sarma lured the victim from her home to the PCO around 10 am, bolted the door from inside and raped her. When the traumatised victim told her mother and neighbours what she had been subjected to, they caught Sarma and beat him up before handing him over to Dispur police. 

 Paltan Bazar police station, which is investigating the other case, said a case has been registered against Mohanty under Section 376 (I). 

 The Board of Sports has already placed him under suspension and asked him to appear before it within a week or face dismissal from service. It has also decided to bear the medical expenses of the victim.

 A member of the investigation team said the accused lured the girl, an accomplished swimmer and an equally good student, inside the stadium while her parents were on a visit to their native village in Nalbari. Her mother is also an employee of the Board of Sports. 

 On returning home around 8 pm, the victims mother found her daughter sitting pensively by the swimming pool in the R.G. Baruah Sports Complex. She also spotted bloodstains on her clothes and immediately informed her sister about it. 

 Prodded by her sister to enquire from the child whether she was with anybody during the day, the scared mother approached her daughter again and out came the story of abuse. 

 Mohanty confessed to the crime when he was confronted and taken to the officer-in-charge of the Board of Sports around 10.30 pm. 

 The officer asked some employees of the office to put the accused under house arrest till morning. However, Mohanty fled the house around 2.30 am.

 Nehru Stadium is one of the venues of the National Games from February 9 to 18 and Union home secretary V.K. Duggal will be here tomorrow to take stock of security measures for the event. Ironically, there was no security for the girl raped at the same site yesterday.

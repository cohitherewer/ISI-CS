 Cheat slur on MLA daughter

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, March 11: Copying has become a major menace in the ongoing high school certificate examination. More than 123 students have been caught in the four days since the exam started on March 7. 

 Yesterday, the 14-year daughter of Sundargarh MLA, Sushma Patel, was allegedly caught copying while writing the mathematics paper. 

 The student, who was writing the test in a sick room after her mother wrote to the centre superintendent, allegedly had a test paper with her. 

 A test paper was found under her answer sheet, said centre superintendent of Town High School, Sundargarh, Kamla Patel.

 The MLA vehemently denied the allegations. The whole thing has been given a political twist, she said.

 The president of the Board of Secondary Education, Subhakant Behera, said they would look into the allegations and take appropriate action.

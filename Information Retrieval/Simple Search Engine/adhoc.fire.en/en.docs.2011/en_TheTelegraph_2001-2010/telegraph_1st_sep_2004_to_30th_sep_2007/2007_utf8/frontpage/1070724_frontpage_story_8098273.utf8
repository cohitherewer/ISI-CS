 Lucknow, July 23: Call it the high place of death where people in high places live.

 Three persons plunged to their deaths in the span of a few hours from a 14-storey building today, one from the sixth floor that has flats belonging to Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi Party MLAs.

 The building is one of two in an apartment complex called the Old Councillors Residence and is less than a quarter km from Lal Bahadur Shastri Bhavan that houses the chief ministers office.

 The first thud of death was heard around 11am when a middle-aged woman, who did not look very well off, went crashing down from a flat in the south-west corner of Block A.

 Two more thuds followed within two-and-a-half-hours, this time from an eighth-floor flat in the south-east corner of the building, which is in the heart of Lucknow.

 The victims, both of whose heads were crushed, were a man who appeared to be in his mid-thirties and a woman in her early thirties. The man was dressed in trousers and shirt and the woman in a salwar-kameez. 

 None of the three was a resident of the building, police said.

 This is not the first time that such mystery deaths have been reported from the building. Since 2002, 16 such cases have happened, many of which still remain unsolved.

 There was panic this morning as the middle-aged woman lay bleeding in the compound. The police moved in soon after and cordoned off the building but could not prevent the deadly replay.

 I had just begun questioning the lift men in connection with the first case when I heard two thuds from the south-east corner of the building, said B.B. Jogdand, the senior superintendent of police.

 There were no MLAs or ministers to be seen. Most of their flats were locked because they usually move in when the Uttar Pradesh Assembly is in session. At other times, the flats are occupied by party workers.

 The incident has left us in a daze. Residents said the woman and the man came to the apartment half an hour before they died. They got out of the lift on the eighth floor, Lucknow DIG Chandra Prakash said.

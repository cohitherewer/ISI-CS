 Mumbai, Aug. 4: The rare privilege of an attached loo at his egg-shaped cell couldnt ensure Sanjay Dutt a pleasant start to his second day at Punes Yerwada jail.

 As the actor got ready to begin his early morning routine three hours spent in praying and reading the Hanuman Chalisa it suddenly dawned on him that he had run out of incense sticks.

 He complained of chest pain soon after, fuelling rumours that he was sick enough to be hospitalised.

 Doctors were summoned immediately from Punes Sassoon Hospital. As the news seeped outside the prison gates, waiting journalists and fans began speculating whether the star might be shifted to Sassoon Hospital. Some suggested he might be brought back to Mumbai.

 It all ended rather tamely. After a thorough check-up, the four jail doctors declared the actor normal. The physicians from Sassoon never turned up.

 Theres nothing serious about his condition and no cause for worry. It must have been the change of environment that caused his sudden illness. Its normal for new inmates, a jail official said.

 He added that the pain could also be a result of smoking. Sanjay, however, is more likely to suffer from withdrawal he is being denied cigarettes in Yerwada.

 The chest pain brought mixed blessings. The jail superintendent ended his solitary confinement, moving him from his anda cell to Barracks No. 3. Now Sanjay has a cell of his own, but is within other inmates sight and the range of their comments, as he had been at the Arthur Road Jail where he had felt like an animal in a zoo two days ago.

 But jail sources said the actor looked happy. He has a clear view of the jails farm. He can look out on open space and breathe in fresh air, an official said.

 He loses the attached lavatory, though, and must now share one with a couple of prisoners from similar cells in his barracks.

 The other problem was solved quickly. The actors secretary, Kaleem, arrived around 11am with packs of incense sticks and papers for Sanjay to sign so that a bail application could be moved in the Supreme Court.

 Officials claimed the secretary didnt meet the actor. The prison rules allow visitors once in 15 days and the actors family stayed away today. 

 But, sources said, Sanjay looked calm. Todays Sanjay is a far cry from the days he was in Arthur Road Jail in the 90s, said an official who was posted at the Mumbai prison then and is at Yerwada now.

 He would then be always chatting with the other inmates and continuously smoking his Marlboros. Now he concentrates his energies in prayer. He has matured a lot.

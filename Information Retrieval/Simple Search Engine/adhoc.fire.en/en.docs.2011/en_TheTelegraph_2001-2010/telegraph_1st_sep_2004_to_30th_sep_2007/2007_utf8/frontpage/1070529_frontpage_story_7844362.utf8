 Maya touch to TN President pick

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, May 28: M. 

 Karunanidhi, Tamil Nadu chief minister and DMK chief, added 

 his own twist to the process of electing the countrys 

 next President by indicating he would prefer a Dalit over 

 a Brahmin.

 Among the host of names from the Congress featuring in the presidential poll sweepstakes, a political aide of Karunanidhi suggested his leaders choice would be Sushil Kumar Shinde, the power minister.

 The aide explained that just as Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati hoped to make a point to her newly-acquired Brahmin constituency by backing a person from the caste, Karunanidhi figured out that he had to do his own social engineering by reaching out to the Dalits of Tamil Nadu who form 25 per cent of the population and are mostly aligned with the AIADMK or smaller caste-based parties.

 Backing a person like Shinde will be politically significant, even if its symbolic, the aide said. 

 A recent survey of the vote-shares of the Tamil Nadu parties as of date done by a respected Chennai-based outfit (not Dinakaran, the paper owned by the Marans) showed that the DMKs was down by seven per cent. Therefore, its strategists believed that to recoup, Karunanidhi would have to rejig his caste coalition.

 There was an added reason for the DMKs anxiety to support an upper caste candidate. Karunanidhis aide recalled that the only time the party did it was in 1969, when by a sleight-of-hand, Indira Gandhi coaxed the DMKs votes for her candidate V.V. Giri, an Andhra Brahmin. The DMKs votes were critical to getting Giri through but there was enormous pressure from its MPs not to back him. Indira Gandhi turned the tables on Karunanidhi by asking him to contest in case Giri was unacceptable. The DMK chief was so stumped that he proffered his partys support, fearing he may be pensioned off from politics if he dithered.

 However, the aide said if a non-Dalit/upper caste name was inevitable, the DMK would go along with the UPA.

 Theres no question of opposition or dissent. After all, much water has flowed down the Cauvery over the 40 years since Giri became the President. We have also reviewed our attitude to the high castes from time to time, said the aide. 

 Through the day, Karunanidhi met Sonia Gandhi, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat, HRD and agriculture ministers Arjun Singh and Sharad Pawar, the Prime Minister and CPI leaders A.B. Bardhan and D. Raja.

 Asked if names were discussed, Congress sources said they might have. As the word got around that Shinde was on Karunanidhis radar, there was worry in the Congress camp that the Dalit MP from Maharashtra may not garner the kind of acceptability or emerge as a consensus candidate that somebody like, say, Pranab Mukherjee could, with effort.

 Sources said Shinde was trounced in the vice-presidential election in 2002 against Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, thanks to serious cross-voting and feared a repeat.

 The DMKs counter argument was the man from Maharashtra could in fact get even the Shiv Sena votes on the regional sentiment.

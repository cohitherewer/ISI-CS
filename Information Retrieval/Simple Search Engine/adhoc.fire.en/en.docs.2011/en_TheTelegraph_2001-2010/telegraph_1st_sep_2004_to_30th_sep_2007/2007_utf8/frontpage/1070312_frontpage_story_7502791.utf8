 Death knell for marriage party

 OUR BUREAU

 Bhubaneswar/Cuttack, March 11: The party for a group of marriage revellers ended on a sad note when the mini-truck they were travelling in turned turtle killing 10 and injuring 34 others at Talavenda village of Bargarh district around 11 this morning. 

 Eyewitnesses said more than 50 people had boarded the truck to escort the bride at her in-laws place, according to the local custom. The couple, however, was travelling in a different car and has escaped unhurt. 

 The mishap took place about 10 km from the village when the driver, in a bid to negotiate a bend at a high speed, lost control. 

 Six people died while being rushed to the Bargarh district hospital while 37 others were admitted to a local hospital. Eighteen of them were shifted to VSS Medical College at Burla, of which four succumbed to their injuries later. Three succumbed to their injuries at Burla. At least 15 others are in a serious condition, hospital sources said. 

 Those killed include Uttar Bhoi (35), Debendra Bhoi (35), Uchita Sahu (22), Lingaraj Bhoi (22), Sudama Sahu (25), Butulu Sahu (40) of Talmenda and Brundaban Pradhan (45), Raju Sahu (35), Judhistir Pradhan (35) of Bahalipali and Gopal Barik (22) of Sargipali.

 Collector Harihar Panigrahi, who visited the spot, said he has directed the district Red Cross to supply all aids to treat the injured. 

 Bus rams into tree

 In yet another accident near Khuntuni under Cuttack district, a Angul-bound minibus carrying nearly 30 passengers from Bhubaneswar rammed into a tree around 12 noon when a cow ran across the road. The driver turned left to save the cow and hit a tree, said Muralidhar Behera, ASI of Gudijhatia police station. 

 The left hand of conductor Hujaraj Sahu (25) was severed from his body.

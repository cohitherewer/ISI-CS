 Lanka pleads, Delhi ponders

 - Wanted: Aid to counter LTTE

 SUJAN DUTTA

New

 Delhi, May 29: The Sri Lankan government has gone beyond seeking arms assistance in its conflict with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and is asking for more pro-active help from a reluctant India.

 Sri Lankas defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapakse who is now in Delhi, wants Indian intelligence inputs and logistics deployment in sea denial or naval blockade tactics to deter the Sea Tigers, the LTTEs naval wing, since a May 25 attack on the island of Delft near Jaffna.

 We are not involved in Sri Lankas war but we are keeping a close watch and are deploying assets that we think are necessary for our own security, a high-level defence ministry source said here today after two days of talks that Rajapakse who is also Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakses younger brother had with senior army, navy and air force officials. 

 India is moving more aerial and naval platforms to Palk Bay.

 The increased deployment of ground, air and naval assets practically opens up a new south-eastern theatre for India for the first time since Operation Pawan the Indian Peacekeeping Force in Sri Lanka (1987-1990). 

 Ironically, apart from domestic political compulsions from Tamil Nadu, it is the experience of the IPKF that is deterring Delhi from aligning itself with Sri Lankan forces visibly though the military acknowledges that the LTTEs new capabilities are a definite security threat.

 If it was the aerial strike on Colombo and Palaly in the last two months, it was last weeks attack on Delft island, which the Sri Lankan forces claimed to have thwarted and the LTTE claimed was successful, that demonstrated the Tigers ability to attack from the sea.

 Gotabaya Rajapakse, who survived an LTTE attack on himself in December, met the army chief and chairman, chiefs of staff committee, General Joginder Jaswant Singh, this morning. 

 But it was at his meeting with navy chief Admiral Sureesh Mehta, which was also attended by other senior Indian naval officials, on Sunday that he gave one of the most significant briefings.

 The Lankan defence secretary also met national security adviser M.K. Narayanan.

 Almost in consonance with the Lankan officials visit, the Indian Navy has deployed two more ships, in addition to four, in Palk Bay. These two ships are missile corvettes of the Khukri class that are capable of sailing fast, intercepting and engaging small targets from a distance.

 The ships are being deployed from the Eastern Naval Command headquarters in Visakhapatnam headed by Vice-Admiral Raman Prem Suthan.

 The eastern naval command is already overseeing low intensity conflict operations in the region under an exercise that began 12 years back codenamed Operation Tasha. 

 Operation Tasha is now set to be intensified and will bring within its ambit air defence measures. 

 Indias Eastern Naval Command and Sri Lankas Northern Areas Command are expected to increase coordination beyond meetings on the international mari- time boundary.

 The navy and the air force are coordinating the setting up of mobile radar units near Rameswaram. The naval air station at Ramnad (Ramanathapuram) is also set to operate Israeli-made Searcher Mark II and Heron pilotless spy planes. The unmanned aerial vehicles are capable of sorties at night. 

 The Sri Lankan security forces night vision capabilities are doubtful.

 The Southern Air Command of the air force, in addition to the deployment of mobile radar stations, has also asked for aerostat balloons tethered radar systems that will be deployed along the peninsula.

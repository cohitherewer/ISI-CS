 Withdraw, what withdraw? 

 - Stability onus on govt: Karat

 MANINI CHATTERJEE 

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: The CPM central committee today authorised the politburo to take whatever necessary measures to ensure that the Indo-US nuclear deal is not operationalised but also decided that the onus of destabilising the UPA-Left alliance should be placed firmly at the governments door.

 In other words, while the party leadership has decided not to budge from its no next step stand, it does not want to be seen as toppling the government.

 If the government insists on going ahead in defiance of majority opinion in Parliament against the deal, it alone should be blamed for forcing mid-term polls.

 This was the message, between the lines, of both the resolution unanimously adopted by the central committee and the responses given by party general secretary Prakash Karat at a news conference that followed. While making it clear that there had been no change in the CPMs firm opposition to the nuke deal, the resolution underlined that it was not for destabilising the government either.

 The central committee does not want the current crisis to affect the government, it said, a point iterated by Karat when he told the media that we have not used the words withdraw support in any of our statements. You wont see a single leader of the CPM either in Delhi or in Calcutta or in Hyderabad having said we will withdraw support.

 Commenting on the Prime Ministers if winter is here, can spring be far behind? line, Karat quipped: I hope there will be no nuclear fission and not a long nuclear winter.

 But lest these remarks be taken as a softening of stance, the resolution as well individual central committee members clarified that the partys bottom line remained save the government or save the deal.

 After stating that it did not want the current crisis to affect the government, the very next line of the resolution noted: However, this is contingent upon the government not proceeding further with the agreement.

 Karat made the same point repeatedly. The responsibility for the future of this government lies with the government, he said. Asked if it could continue as a minority government, he said: This government runs on our support. How can it continue without our support?

 But the issue of mid-term elections had not come up before the central committee, which discussed only the implications of the nuclear deal and authorised the leadership to block it, he said.

 In what appeared a veiled effort to drive a wedge between the governments eagerness to go ahead with the deal and the Congresss reluctance to risk a mid-term poll, Karat also stressed that the Left leaders were waiting for the Congress leaderships response to their demand rather than that of the government.

 We are not in a hurry, he said. We have already said three days ago that we are prepared to consider any mechanism or committee to examine all the problems connected with this agreement provided they do not proceed with the next step.

 On Atomic Energy Commission chairman Anil Kakodkars proposed visit to Vienna to attend the IAEA conference, Karat said: We know we are members of the IAEA board. Our representatives will attend the international conference. We expected them to be there. We have to have Indias representatives there.

 The central committee decided to launch a mass campaign to highlight the way the tie-up with the US is affecting the various policies which affect the peoples livelihood, economic sovereignty and independent foreign policy.

 The CPM will conduct its independent campaign till September 15 by when the governments response should be known.

 Congress upbeat

 The Congress expressed the hope that some understanding will be reached and some way will be found.

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Feb. 13: The city, which woke up to a nagging drizzle and a cold gust this morning, can expect more rain tomorrow, the weather office said.

 The weather is likely to improve from tomorrow afternoon. The minimum temperature will fall by one or two degrees, Met office director G.C. Debnath said.

 He said a combination of two weather systems a low-pressure trough over Bengal since yesterday and a cyclonic circulation over Jharkhand today had sucked in moisture from the Bay of Bengal.

 Tall columns of clouds have covered Calcutta and neighbouring districts, he said. The minimum temperature slipped to 17.3C but the maximum was eight degrees below normal at 20.6 C. In north Bengal, the rain and cold winds will continue till Thursday.

 Parts of north India, like Mussoorie and Shimla, had snowfall and Delhi saw rain after a warm spell. Madhavan Rajeevan, director of Punes National Climate Centre, said the weather was unusual but not unprecedented.

 Dravid has no doubt on mates, Dilip is stung

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Dhaka, May 9: A sting operation on match-fixing coincided with the Indian cricketers arrival here for the 2000 Asia Cup. Seven years on, another undercover exercise got aired a day after the Rahul Dravids landed for what has become a big tour.

 Given the disparity in rankings, the Indians have everything to lose and little to gain. Dravid and Co. dont start as underdogs, thankfully, but their task is truly cut out for the three-match ODI series beginning tomorrow. The two Tests start rolling on May 18. 

 Now, to the lead-up.

 All, obviously, wasnt well in the dressing room Indias disastrous World Cup campaign and the latest sting operation (by a television channel) seems to confirm that.

 However, one of the central figures caught by the hidden camera, North Zones representative on the five-man selection committee Bhupinder Singh (Sr), insisted that the channel has attributed quotes to him in different voices.

 Ive asked the board for permission to initiate action.... Ive recognised my voice in some parts, but dont know who has talked in other segments.... Certainly not me, Singh told The Telegraph.

 Its no secret that both Sachin Tendulk ar and Sourav Ganguly wouldnt mind getting back the captaincy Sachin stepped down in March 2000, while successor Sourav had a good run till he was removed in October 2005.

 Its also no state secret that former coach Greg Chappell adopted a divide-and-rule policy. Hed specifically target players close to Sourav, with whom there was no love lost.

 Whats damning is that Sachin and Sourav stand accused (by Singh) of not their captain.

 Dravid, though, rubbished that charge on the morning after the telecast. Im not going to react to sting operations.... I got as much support as I could (from teammates) during the World Cup.... I was happy with the team I had.

 Chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar took on the media. Its a shame that some are stooping to such levels. I wish the government bans such unethical acts.... How can you betray in this manner? Its beyond me.

 He added: I have faith in my colleagues and in their integrity.... Easts Ranjib Biswal is the other selector caught by the hidden camera.

 But, surely, after what Singh has been quoted as saying, wouldnt the whispers that Sachin and Sourav have actually been dropped for the ODIs get louder? 

 Vengsarkar got a tad irritated. Please dont ask such questions. Havent we announced theyve been rested? Also, havent they been picked for the Test series?

 Yes, but....

 Board secretary Niranjan Shah, another victim of the undercover exercise, declined to comment. Right now, theres nothing to say. Except, perhaps, prayers to end the bumbling.

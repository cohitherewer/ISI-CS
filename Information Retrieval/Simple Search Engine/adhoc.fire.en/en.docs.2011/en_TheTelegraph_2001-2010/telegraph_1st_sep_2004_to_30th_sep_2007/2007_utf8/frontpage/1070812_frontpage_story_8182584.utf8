 Killings convulse Karbi belt

 SARAT SARMA

 Dolamora Rongteron (Karbi Anglong), Aug. 11: Ulfa and anti-talks Karbi militants continued their terror run in Karbi Anglong district, with a total of 14 Hindi-speaking people being slaughtered in attacks at three separate places not far from each other last night. 

 Six persons, including a three-month-old baby, were the latest to be massacred at a remote village in the district. The nearest town is Bokakhat in Golaghat district. Six others were injured. Two of them were critical and have been shifted to Golaghat Civil Hospital. 

 Militants had earlier gunned down eight Hindi-speaking people at Dolamora under Bokajan police station in the district around 9.30pm. 

 A joint team of militants from the Karbi Longri NC Hills Liberation Front and Ulfa were responsible for all the attacks. These two outfits were responsible for a massacre on Wednesday as well, when eight Hindi-speaking persons were gunned down at Aampahar. 

 The body of a trader, identified as Sajan Jaiswal, was found today on a riverbank at Kakochang in Golaghat district bordering Karbi Anglong. His hands and feet were tied. 

 Shocked and furious over Dispurs failure to protect the lives of the people of the community, the Sadou Asom Bhojpuri Yuba Chatra Parishad and Sodou Asom Bihari Yuba Manch had called a 12-hour statewide bandh today in protest against the killings. 

 Chief minister Tarun Gogoi, who went to Aampahar today, condemned the killing of innocent and defenceless people and appealed to the Hindi-speaking population in Karbi Anglong to stay together in settlements rather than at scattered locations. 

 Gogoi announced ex gratia of Rs 3 lakh each for the next of kin of those slain. Assam Governor Lt Gen. (retd) Ajai Singh also condemned the killings. 

 Karbi Anglong SP Anurag Tankha said a 12-member ga-ng was behind the massacre. 

 He said the district administration has sought three more CRPF battalions to aid the two already operating in Karbi Anglong. Deputy commissioner M. Angamuthu said security forces have launched operations to apprehend the culprits.

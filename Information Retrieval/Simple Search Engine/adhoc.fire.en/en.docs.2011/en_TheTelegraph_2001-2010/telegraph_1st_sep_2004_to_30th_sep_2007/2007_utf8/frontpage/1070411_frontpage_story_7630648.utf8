 Red wrath rattles schools 

 - Over 100 guerrillas blow up CRPF pickets at Munger

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Patna, April 10: Close on the heels of killing two RPF jawans on the Howrah-Mokama passenger train near Narganjo in the Jamui district, Naxalites struck yet another blow at security bastions and blew up two adjacent schools that housed a CRPF picket in Munger district, about 160 km from the state capital. 

 Over 100 Maoist guerrillas raided the Banahara village under Mungers Haveli Khadagpur police station blowing up a high school and middle school adjacent to each other. 

 Confirming the incident, Munger superintendent of police Ravindran Shankaran told The Telegraph that the Naxalites used dynamite to blow up the schools. He said a couple of cane bombs has been recovered from the places of the attack. 

 No casualty, however, has been reported as the attack took place in the wee hours when no one was present at the spot, the police said. 

 Official resources revealed that the administration had to close down a school in the Goh area of Aurangabad district recently, thanks to Naxalite threats. Those schools, too, had housed the para-military forces till a few months ago. 

 In fact, the police have been vacating the school premises in response to the Nitish Kumar governments instruction to stop using the school premises for operations and stay. 

 The para-military forces had occupied over 200 schools in central and south Bihar in the absence of proper places to stay impeding primary and secondary education in Aurangabad, Jehanabad, Bhojpur, Rohtas and Gaya districts. 

 A senior police officer dealing with the Naxalite activities in the state said Maoists, who were lying a bit low ever since the formation of the Nitish Kumar government in December 2005, have suddenly got to their feet particularly after their counterparts joined the government in Nepal. 

 Though he clarified that the state police does not have anything substantial to link the two factors, their chronological association seems too much of a coincidence. 

 A group of Maoists had raided a police station in Sitamarchi and damaged a bridge, a sugar factory and looted a bank in the district last week.

 Delhi alerts Myanmar

 - Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland sounded on Ulfa incursion

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Jan. 9: The Centre has alerted the Myanmar government to be on the lookout for Ulfa activists who could take refuge across the border after the scaled-up military offensive in Assam.

 According to intelligence inputs, it is feared that after going on a killing spree in Tinsukia and Dibrugarh districts of Assam, Ulfa activists might cross over to safety into the Sagaing region of Myanmar, which is largely under the control of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Khaplang). 

 There are currently around 14 camps of various Indian insurgent outfits in Myanmar, including three or four camps of Ulfa. The NSCN (K) has claimed that it is currently imparting training to a few thousand Ulfa militants in Sagaing division.

 India expects Myanmar to take immediate and concrete steps in view of the Ulfa move. During talks between the home secretaries of both countries last year, Myanmar had assured India that it would not allow the insurgents to use its territory to carry out any activities against India. It had also agreed to intensify action against such outfits and arms smugglers.

 This understanding was reiterated at the recent meeting of Union home minister Shivraj Patil with Maj. Gen. Maung Oo, home minister of Myanmar. 

 Sources said the Centre has also alerted the state governments of Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland to be on the lookout for Ulfa militants on the run. The only way into Myanmar lies through Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh or Mon district of Nagaland. 

 A worried Centre has also asked the Assam government to give a boost to its local intelligence network by filling up the 1,500 posts lying vacant in the special branch and the 5,000 vacant posts in the state police. The Assam government has also been told to take effective steps to stop all covert political patronage of Ulfa activists. 

 The Centre feels that operations against Ulfa have not been as successful because of the alleged patronage accorded to the militants by some important political leaders of Assam.

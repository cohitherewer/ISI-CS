 Bold beauties ready for ramp-age 

 - Quartet from N-E high on hopes to walk the Bipasha-Celina-Koena line 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, April 7: After a dash of glitz and glamour, it is time for the beauty quartet from the Northeast to strut their stuff on the ramp during the finals of the Dabur Gulabari Sananda Tilottama contest in Calcutta next month. Oozing confidence, they said not once did they allow their attention to deviate from their goal to make it big in the fashion world. 

 Wannabe model Ananya from Guwahati, one of the four girls who hogged the limelight at the preliminary round of the beauty pageant held in Shillong, said, I always dreamt of making it big in modelling and I am thankful to the organisers for providing me a platform to realise my dream.

 I am keeping my fingers crossed. Hopefully, the beauty pageant will prove to be a turning point for me, the 16-year-old smiled.

 Like Ananya, Popi Barman (20) and Neharika Dholua (17) from Assam and Laila Iarisha Kharkongar (19) from Shillong have set their sights on the grand finale in Calcutta on May 19.

 The 20 finalists, including four from the Northeast, will be groomed by model Noyonika Chatterjee from April 21 to May 18. The participants will also be vying for titles like Miss Beautiful Eyes, Vatika Shampoo Miss Beautiful Hair and VLCC Miss Perfect 10, among other categories. 

 Oozing confidence, Kharkongar hoped to do well in the grand finale. I feel that the girls from the Northeast are on a par with others from the rest of the country in talent. Now that I have a platform, I look forward to do well in the final, Kharkongar said. 

 Echoing her, ace fashion designers Prasantt Ghosh and Dipankar Kashyap said that the youngsters were all grace and poise on the ramp which is the sine qua non of success on the ramp. 

 Besides the designer duo, the two other judges of the preliminary round were beautician Jula Baruah and second runners-up of Gladrags Mrs India 2007, Nandini Baruva Jajodia. 

 Some of the previous winners of the pageant promoted by Sananda were stars like Bipasha Basu, Celina Jaitley and Koena Mitra. 

 Preliminary rounds were held in Guwahati last year and the organisers received an overwhelming response. This year, regional rounds were held in Jamshedpur and Shillong.

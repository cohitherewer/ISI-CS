 Metal help for Bengal

 RANJAN DASGUPTA 

 Ranchi, July 16: National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology (NIFFT), Ranchi, is all set to use its expertise to chart the growth of foundry units located in Howarh district of Bengal. 

 The Foundry Cluster Development Association (FCDA) has appointed NIFFT as the nodal agency for establishing and running a research and development centre and a training institute at the proposed foundry park in Bengal.

 The decision has resulted from the series of interactive meetings between the senior authorities of the institute for the past few months. 

 Director of NIFFT Moloy Banerjee, expressing excitement over the new assignment, said: It is a prestigious project that NIFFT has bagged. We shall put in our best efforts to ensure that foundry units in the park grow in a proper manner, he added. 

 FCDA and NIFFT would be signing a memorandum of understanding and bringing out a vision statement shortly, following which work would start on establishing the two institutes.

 FCDA is a special purpose vehicle floated jointly by industry stakeholders, including the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation and Indian Foundry Association, for establishing a foundry park at Howrah district at a cost of over Rs 110cr. The Centre is partly funding the project under the Industrial Infrastructure Upgradation Scheme by providing about Rs 45cr. 

 Over 160 foundry units producing over 10lakh tonnes of casting shall come up in the park along with over 60 allied units. There would be also be special economic zones in the park. Over 2,500bighas has been identified for the project. 

 NIFFT would get about 10bighas for the R amp;D centre and the training institute. Our task would be to help and guide the units to overcome production bottlenecks and produce casting and forging material of internationally-acceptable quality, Banerjee said.

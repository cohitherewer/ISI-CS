 Tide turns in engineered JEE

 Calcutta, May 21: Two students of schools in Rajasthan have made it to the Top Ten list of Bengals joint entrance examinations (engineering) for the first time but the success of the duo masks a significant shift.

 A preliminary analysis of the JEE results revealed that unlike last year, fewer students from outside Bengal figure on the overall merit list this time.

 Gourav Malpani and Ankush Bajoria, two students from schools in Kota in Rajasthan, have bagged the third and fifth positions.

 We are yet to complete the process of compiling a state-wise performance list. But a quick glance reveals that there has been an at least 10 per cent drop in the number from outside Bengal, an official said.

 As many as 45,000 students are on the overall merit list in engineering for filling nearly 17,000 seats in the 54 engineering colleges. Around 1 lakh students had appeared for the 2007 JEE in engineering. 

 Last year, nearly 40 per cent seats in government as well as private engineering colleges were taken by students from other states.

 If the tide has turned this year, it is not an accident. The government, pushed by the CPMs student wing SFI, had tweaked the examination process to remove perceived disadvantages to the local students.

 Last year, the JEE board had introduced multiple-choice questions. Higher secondary students were not accustomed to the format and they performed very poorly, said Sudip Sengupta, the SFI state committee president.

 The government later decided to change the examination pattern under the higher secondary curriculum and incorporated multiple-choice questions. The new system has helped students perform better in JEE this time, Sengupta claimed. 

 Other changes, too, played a part. We have made it compulsory for students to score a minimum 30 per cent in English in Class XII, N.R. Banerjea, the JEE board chairman and Besu vice-chancellor, said. 

 The threshold must have kept away a substantial number of prospective candidates from neighbouring states.

 The board also tightened invigilation at exam centres outside Bengal, addressing complaints of lax supervision in some places. Questions were juggled for different sets of students to make cheating difficult. From next year, the exam will not be held in centres outside the state. 

 In the medical category out of bounds for students from outside the state 1,700 students figured on the merit list.

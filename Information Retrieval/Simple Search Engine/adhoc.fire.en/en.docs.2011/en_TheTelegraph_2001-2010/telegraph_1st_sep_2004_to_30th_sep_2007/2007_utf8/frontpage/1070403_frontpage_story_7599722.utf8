 4 Ulfa rebels killed

 OUR BUREAU

 Guwahati/Jorhat April 2: Four Ulfa militants were gunned down during an encounter with the army in Assams Udalguri district today, even as Jorhat police were looking for two dacoits hired by Ulfa to carry out subversive activities in the run-up to its raising day on April 7.

 R.M. Singh, the inspector-general of police of Bodoland Territorial Areas Districts, said a nine-member team of the 172 field regiment had gone to Kaitpara Bathagaon village under Tangla police station around 2.45 pm on a regular patrol. 

 The team noticed that one person, later identified as Jhintu Boro, came out of a house and ran back on seeing the army unit. His behaviour roused suspicious and the patrol party approached the house to check. 

 As the army personnel advanced towards the house, Ulfa militants holed inside opened fire. The rebels also lobbed a grenade, but it did not explode. 

 The patrol party retaliated, killing the four militants. The rebels have not been identified as yet. The bodies will be kept at the Mangaldoi civil hospital morgue for identification. 

 Two AK-56 rifles, two grenades, 125 live ammunition, four magazines and 25 empty cases of AK-56 rifles were also found at the spot. 

 The army has picked up Boro for interrogation and is looking for the owner of the house, Dhaniram Boro.

 Singh said the area was a known hideout of Ulfa. 

 In Jorhat, police today revealed that they were on the lookout for two dacoits who have exploded two ASEB transformers on the outskirts of the town. The second transformer went off last night at Garmurh.

 Deputy inspector-general of police (eastern range) Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta said both the dacoits have been identified. The outfit has hired the dacoits for Rs 50,000 each to plant the bombs at four selected targets in Jorhat town Sadar police station, Pulibor police station, the official residence of a senior police officer and a community centre of a Hindi-speaking population. Powerful bombs have already been delivered to them. 

 Mahanta said information suggests that Ulfa has threatened to kill the duo if they do not follow instructions. 

 The district administration has appealed to the public to be cautious and inform the police if they observe any suspicious activity. Pillion riding and wearing full-mask helmets have been banned.

 Kokrajhar/Guwahati, June 30: Seventy-four days after Ulfa militants abducted Food Corporation of Indias executive director in charge of the Northeast, P.C. Ram, police today exhumed his body from a pit at Anandapur village on the bank of the Mora-Pagladia in Assams Baksa district. 

 The officials adopted daughter, June Murmu, identified the body as Rams. However, the Assam government and police said they are waiting for Rams family members to corroborate the identification. 

 A senior police official involved in the search operations for Ram said it is better to be 100 per cent sure in such cases, but added that they were practically certain the body was his. 

 The body was recovered in the presence of a magistrate from a deserted spot under Borbori police outpost, which is located in the Bodoland Territorial Area Districts. 

 Yes, a body has been found. We are trying to ascertain whether it is Rams, Assam director-general of police R.N. Mathur said tonight. 

 Local villagers had informed the police that there were signs of recent burial at the spot. The body was exhumed and brought to Barama police station this morning. It was later taken to Nalbari civil hospital for post-mortem. Police said it would be kept in Guwahati till Rams next of kin arrives. 

 According to Baksa superintendent of police Kongkonjyoti Saikia, the body was probably buried some six to seven days back. 

 It was exhumed and brought to the police station, where it was identified by the FCI officials adopted daughter, Saikia said. 

 A team of top FCI officials and union members rushed to Nalbari when the news broke. 

 Police sources suspect that Ram was strangled to death since there were ligature marks on the neck. There were also injury marks on the abdomen. 

 Rams body was recovered after four Ulfa militants were arrested in Baksa district on Thursday. The police said the rebels were helping the core group which had been holding Ram captive. 

 Sources said Ram had probably been slain as he had become a burden for the militant group after operations were intensified, slowing down their movements.

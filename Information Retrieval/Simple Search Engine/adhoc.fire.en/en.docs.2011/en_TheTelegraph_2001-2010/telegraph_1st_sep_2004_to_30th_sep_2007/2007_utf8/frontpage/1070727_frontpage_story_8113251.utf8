 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 26: A young woman who became a mother two days ago has accused a city nursing home employee of molesting her while she was recuperating from a Caesarean section.

 The accused a man who supervises the ayahs at the nursing home in Shyampukur fled after an alarm was raised but was tracked down and arrested this evening.

 According to police, the woman in her twenties from an affluent family in Howrah was admitted to the nursing home on Bhupen Bose Avenue on Monday. She gave birth on Tuesday.

 The mother was admitted there because she underwent a surgery. The baby was in the special unit of the nursing home and the mother was in her bed, said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police. Her husband, a garment businessman, arranged for two ayahs to take care of his wife.

 According to the complaint lodged by the woman, she woke up this afternoon when she felt someones presence. The suspect was later identified as Sheikh Asraf Ali, supervisor of the ayahs.

 She saw him leaning over her bed, pulling her hands and attempting to touch her. When she raised an alarm, Ali said he was trying to clean her bed. On hearing the womans screams, other employees rushed to the cabin, prompting Ali to run away, Singh said.

 Ali, who also oversees cleaning at the healthcare unit, used to inspect the womans cabin several times, the police said.

 The police searched a number of places in Shyambazar and a relatives house on BT Road to trace Ali.

 In the evening, we received information that Ali was roaming around near the nursing home, an officer of Shyampukur police station said.

 BCCI bats to solve dispute

 ARUN KUMAR THAKUR

 Ranchi, Sept. 28: To prepare a report on the ongoing dispute in Jharkhand and Bihar over affiliation and status of cricket associations, the Board of Control for Cricket in India today formed a four-member committee at its 78th annual general body meeting in Mumbai.

 The committee was constituted following a Supreme Court directive on August 31, 2007, in response to a special leave petition (15596 of 2006). 

 The apex court had directed the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to form the committee to look into the disputes of different bodies to manage cricket in the two states after their bifurcation on November 15, 2000, and submit a report before January 18, 2008.

 The disputes involve Cricket Association of Jharkhand (CAJ) headed by Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman, Jharkhand State Cricket Association (JSCA) led by inspector- general of police Amitabh Choudhary, the Bihar Cricket Association (BCA) headed by railway minister Lalu Prasad and a state association headed by former cricketer Kirti Azad.

 The committee consists of Chirayu Amin, Sanjay Jagdale, M.P. Pandove and Niranjan Shah, said Aditya Verma of BCA, who, along with CAJ secretary Ramesh Saxena, was in Mumbai for the BCCI AGM.

 It all began after Jharkhand was carved out of Bihar, and later in Janu- ary 2001 Bihar Cricket Asso- ciation 1935 was dissolved, giving way to CAJ for Jharkhand and a new BCA for Bihar.

 Following some developments, however, BCA-1935 was revived and was renamed as JSCA at a special general meeting on August 15, 2004. It was accorded full affiliation by BCCI, then led by Jagmohan Dalmiya.

 BCA led by the railway minister was not granted full membership of BCCI.

 JSCA, armed with full affiliation, started looking after cricket in both Jharkhand and Bihar, and players from Bihar were allowed to play for the Jharkhand team in all BCCI tournaments, including Ranji Trophy.

 BCA, meanwhile, pur- sued their claim that they are the rightful successors to BCA-1935.

 Therefore, they should be granted full affiliation, they claimed. 

 On the other hand, Muthuramans CAJ claimed that it was formed following a general body decision at its meeting in January 2001 and even elections were held subsequently, thus it had the bona fide to run cricket in Jharkhand.

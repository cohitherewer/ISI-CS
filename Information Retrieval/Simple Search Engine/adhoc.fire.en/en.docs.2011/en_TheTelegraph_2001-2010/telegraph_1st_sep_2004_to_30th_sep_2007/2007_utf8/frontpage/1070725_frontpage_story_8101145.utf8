 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, July 24: Even as a nine-member central team today reached Orissa to assess the damage caused by the recent floods in the state, the government today raised its demand for financial assistance of Rs 306.7 crore.

 The team, led by additional secretary in the Union home ministry Dinesh Singh, reached Bhubaneswar today and headed for the worst flood-hit areas in Balasore, Bhadrak, Jajpur, Mayurbhanj and Koenjhar this afternoon after a meeting with special relief commissioner N.K. Sundarray.

 The state officials said the floods have caused huge damage across 12 districts while damaging basic infrastructure such as roads and bridges. More than 13 lakh people have been affected by the floods while 37 died. Crops were also damaged, the team was told.

 The state government also demanded 38600 tonnes of foodgrain for the flood-affected people. The special relief commissioner said a memorandum would be submitted to the Centre for assistance.

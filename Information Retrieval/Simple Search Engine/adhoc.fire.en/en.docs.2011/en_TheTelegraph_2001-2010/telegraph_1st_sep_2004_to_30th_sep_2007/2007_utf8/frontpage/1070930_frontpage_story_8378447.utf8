 Calcutta, Sept. 29: Two police officials accused of pressuring Rizwanur Rahman to end his marriage with Priyanka Todi told the CID today they were only following instructions from their superiors.

 Assistant commissioner Sukanti Chakraborty and sub-inspector Krishnendu Das were summoned to Bhabani Bhavan for interrogation a week after the body of the 30-year-old graphic designer was found on the rail tracks. 

 There were several discrepancies in their statements and these need to be verified, said Bhupinder Singh, additional director-general, CID.

 His family and a complaint Rizwanur had filed with an NGO alleged that Priyankas father, businessman Ashok Todi, and several senior police officials had tried to break up the marriage. In a statement to CID yesterday, Priyanka corroborated this.

 Das admitted he had made several phone calls to Sadique Hossain, a witness to the marriage who too has complained of police harassment. The anti-rowdy squad official told interrogators: We received a complaint forwarded by our superior that Sadique had made threat calls to the Todis Salt Lake residence and the phone calls were part of our investigation.

 But Singh said: We pointed out that neither the Todis nor Hussain live under the jurisdiction of the city police, so how did the anti-rowdy squad get involved? 

 The Todis live in Salt Lake while Hussain is a resident of Akra in South 24-Parganas.

 The officials had arrived at Bhabani Bhavan at 5pm. Das was questioned first till 6.40pm by Singh and Niraj Narayan Pandey, a special inspector-general of police, CID. Then Chakraborty was interrogated for over two hours. 

 Chakraborty was asked since when he knew Todi and how the squad got involved in the marriage of two adults. 

 The officials were also asked why they continued to call the couple after they were shown proof the marriage was registered under the special marriage act and Priyanka said she wanted to live with her husband. Both said they were acting on the orders of their seniors, a CID source said. 

 Priyankas uncles Pradip Todi and Anil Saraogi were also questioned today.

 Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said the judicial commission set up to probe Rizawanurs death has been asked to submit its report within three months. But legal experts said this was not possible.

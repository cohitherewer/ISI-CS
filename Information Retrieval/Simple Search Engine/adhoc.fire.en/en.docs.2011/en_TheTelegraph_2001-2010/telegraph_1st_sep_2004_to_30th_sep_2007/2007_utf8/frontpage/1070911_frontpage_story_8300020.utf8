 Bihar would soon get an IIM, like this one in Lucknow

 Patna, Sept. 10: After IIT, it is the IIM, which is all set to make a debut in the so-called under-developed state.

 The state government has set in motion the process to open a B-school after its success in securing the arrival of some top-class institutions, like the IIT, National Law School University and National Institute of Fashion Designing, in Bihar.

 The late principal secretary of the human resource development department, Madan Mohan Jha, had finalised all the modalities of opening the institute through a series of meetings with IIM, Ahmedabad, director B.H. Dholakia.

 Jha, who died on Friday, has also left behind a detailed project report (DPR) and the bylaws of the B-school in the offing. 

 Anjani Kumar Singh, who has replaced Jha as the departments new secretary, said the new business would begin functioning from the next academic year. We have all the groundwork ready, he said.

 Sources in the department said that the government had already decided to appoint V. Mukund Das, a former professor of IIM-A, as the first director of its proposed school of management.

 In fact, Das, at present working as the dean of Indian Institute of Information Technology, Kozhikode, has also been working on the new project for Bihar. He, along with Piyush Sinha, a professor at IIM-A, got the DPR of the proposed institute prepared in consultation with Jha.

 The proposed B-school will start with 50 students at the outset and the admission would be through CAT. Singh said the government had already procured the approval of taking admission in its upcoming B-school through CAT. Apart from the six IIMs, around 70 other B-schools take students based on CAT score.

 Initially, the institute will function at the Hindi Bhavan adjacent to the All India Radio office here. Later, it will be shifted to a venue that the government would exclusively build for it. 

 The law university, too, is at present functioning at the AN Sinha Institute here. But the government has already allotted land for it in Mithapur on which the new building for the university is under construction. The government has also allotted 500 acres for the proposed IIT at Bihata on the outskirts of Patna.

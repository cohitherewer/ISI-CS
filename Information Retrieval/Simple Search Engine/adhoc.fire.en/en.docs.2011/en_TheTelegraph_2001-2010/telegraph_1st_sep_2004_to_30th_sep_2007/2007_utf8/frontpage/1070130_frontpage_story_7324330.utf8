 NSCN-K quit notice

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Kohima, Jan. 29: The Khaplang faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland has reiterated its quit notice issued to the Tangkhul community. 

 Reaffirming the notice asking all Tangkhuls to quit the state, the NSCN (K) issued what it described as this final directive to all Tangkhuls to leave Nagaland bag and baggage before February 5, 2007. 

 If anything happens to any Tangkhul, whether he/she is a government servant, a businessman, a student or a terrorist, it will be taken to be self-inflicted punishment. No Naga organisation or the NSCN/GPRN can be blamed, stated a directive issued by Seochem Sangtam, deputy kilonser in the ministry of information and publicity of the NSCN (K). 

 Alleging that killings and brutalities have been re-enforced by the presence of Isak Swu and Th. Muivah at the so-called Hebron Camp, the directive orders NSCN (K) regional authorities to see that the directive is implemented in letter and spirit.

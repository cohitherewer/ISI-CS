 TCS comes calling 

 - CEO to explore options AT NICT 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Guwahati, Aug. 30: The Northeasts biggest information and communication technology exposition, NICT 2007, today turned into a platform for a major announcement. 

 Chief executive officer and managing director of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), S. Ramadorai, will arrive in Guwahati tomorrow to explore possibilities for investments in Assam by the IT giant.

 Ramadorai, leading a high-level seven-member delegation, will arrive in Guwahati on a chartered flight. 

 Union minister of state for commerce Jairam Ramesh and Assams IT minister Himanta Biswa Sarma highlighted Ramadorais visit to drive home the point that the region is starting to attract the industry captains. 

 Organised jointly by NASSCOM and The Telegraph, the IT conclave was inaugurated at Vishwaratna Hotel this morning by Governor Lt Gen. (retd) Ajai Singh who was the chief guest. 

 Besides Ramesh, others present at the inaugural function were NASSCOM president Kiran Karnik and D.D. Purkayastha, the CEO of ABP Pvt Ltd and organising secretary of NICT 2007.

 It gives me pleasure to say that S.Ramadorai will arrive in Guwahati for holding discussions with chief minister Tarun Gogoi on the possibilities of doing business in the state, Ramesh said. 

 This could be the single largest IT investment in the region. 

 Ramesh said that the government was serious about the visit could be gauged from the fact that he himself would be at the airport to receive Ramadorai. That is the sign of the times. A Union minister is going to receive an IT captain. 

 Himanta Biswa Sarma, who delivered the keynote address at the theme session on Enabling the Northeast this afternoon, also highlighted Ramadorais visit, saying it could pay rich dividends for the state. 

 He said Dispur had initiated a move to set up an IT park which would be completed in the next couple of years. The park will be spread over 300 bighas and have all the facilities to attract investors. 

 NICT organising secretary Purkayastha said NICT, too, had started to show the same results in Assam like Infocom in West Bengal. 

 Infocom brought in major IT investments to West Bengal. Now we are witnessing a similar phenomenon in Assam with NICT acting as a catalyst in bringing TCS, he said. 

 Earlier, in his inaugural address, the governor said NICT for the past two years had been providing the perfect networking platform for the industry and the government. 

 Participation of a large number of companies prove that the event has evoked tremendous response from the industry, Karnik said.

 Assam IT secretary V.S. Bhaskar said, Governments are looking at the PPP model for IT development but the question is to get the best private partner. We have to live in a symbiotic ambience and not in one tarred by animosity. 

 Speaking on the subject Public Private Partnerships New Models for Addressing Diverse Communities, MD of AMTRON M.K. Yadava said there has to be a legal and policy environment for successful launch of the PPP model.

 The conference concludes tomorrow.

 8 hurt in bandh clashes 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mangaldoi, June 2: Eight persons were injured during a 12-hour bandh in Darrang district called by the Assam United Democratic Front (AUDF) today. 

 The bandh was called by AUDF from 5 am demanding Presidents rule in Assam and protesting against attacks and derogatory comments made against them by other parties. 

 Nearly 100 AUDF supporters clashed with Congress workers. The former had gone to down shutters of shops at Besamari. Two hotels belonging to a local Congress leader were ransacked there and a Maruti car was set on fire at Gendachowk. Three persons have been picked up in this connection. Police escorted vehicles on the national highway from Dhula to Rowta. 

 Additional superintendent of police S. Singh said more forces are being called in. 

 In Guwahati, a delegation led by AUDF president Bad-ruddin Ajmal met Assam Governor Lt Gen. (retd) Ajai Singh and demanded Presidents rule. The party workers also took out a rally protesting the frequent bomb blasts.

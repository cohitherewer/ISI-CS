 Grenade gift sparks media shutdown

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Imphal, Aug. 1: A

 rocket-propelled grenade, gift-wrapped and delivered

 to a newspaper office in Imphal last night, triggered

 a media explosion of a different kind today.

 Manipurs embattled fraternity of journalists decided overnight to suspend publication of all dailies indefinitely and yank news bulletins off local cable channels. Nearly 100 media personnel also began an indefinite sit-in demonstration near Keisampat junction in Imphal from 9am.

 The grenade gift received by The Sangai Express last night ostensibly came from a faction of the militant Peoples Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak. The faction was trying to intimidate the newspaper into dropping a statement issued by its rival. Several other newspaper houses received threatening telephone calls.

 Khogendra Khomdram, the editor of The Sangai Express, said unidentified persons came to his office around 7.15pm and left the grenade packed in a box meant for a mobile phone with a staff member. The packet contained a label on which was written in bold, home department of Prepak.

 The grenade couriers told the employee who received the packet that this was the first warning for the editor and that he would be in trouble if the newspaper published any statement by the other Prepak faction.

 A delegation of senior journalists met chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh a little after 10pm and apprised him of the threat. 

 The decision to suspend publication of all dailies was taken jointly by the Editors Forum, Manipur, and the All Manipur Working Journalists Union during a late-night meeting at Manipur Press Club. ISTV, the lone cable television operator in Imphal, showed solidarity with the print media by taking its four daily news bulletins off air. 

 We will not resume publication and continue the sit-in protest daily until the threat to media organisations is withdrawn. No group should put pressure on media organisations and their employees, the president of the journalists Union, S. Hemant, said. 

 A home department official said security forces were asked to intensify patrolling and frisking in the vicinity of all newspaper offices. Police personnel were deployed in all media houses.

 This is not the first time that dailies in Manipur have suspended publication to protest intimidation by militant groups. In February 2006, newspapers shut shop for a few days after militants shot at and critically wounded a senior journalist, Ratan Luwangcha.

 Newspapers had done the same in October the previous year, too, to protest interference by militant groups and attempts to use the media as a weapon against rivals.

 Lahore leash grounds Imran

 - Blame pinned on Pervez

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Imran Khan

 May 27: Imran Khan, the iconic cricketer-turned-politician seen as a threat by the Establishment in Pakistan, is going to challenge the restraining orders slapped on him by the provincial governments of Sindh and Punjab.

 Late last night, Sindh barred Imran (a first-term member of the National Assembly from his native Mianwali) from entering the province. 

 This morning, Punjab ordered him not to leave capital Lahore for three days.

 Imran, who heads the Tehrik-e-Insaaf party which he founded in April 1996, couldnt therefore board a flight for Sindhs trouble-prone capital Karachi. 

 The governments in both provinces are backing President (Pervez) Musharraf and theyve acted on his direct orders.... Im not taking this lying down and will move the high courts in Sindh and Lahore.... My fundamental rights have been infringed upon.... My freedom has been curbed, a distinctly peeved Imran told The Telegraph.

 Clearly, much water has flowed down the Indus since Musharraf offered Pakistans only World Cup-winning captain the prime ministership.

 Speaking late this evening, after meetings with lawyers, Imran added: Ive been perceived as a threat to law and order, but thats absurd.... Its ironical that Pakistans No.1 terrorist, Altaf Hussain, is the one calling the shots in Sindh that, too, from London!

 Altaf, an ally of Musharraf, has been in exile for years and leads the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) which holds sway over Karachi and other areas in Sindh.

 The Sindh government barred Imran as hed stepped up an anti-MQM campaign, even threatening to initiate action against Altaf in a British court. He has squarely held Altaf and his MQM responsible for the May 12 mayhem in Karachi.

 The countrys suspended Chief Justice, Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, was to have visited the provincial capital that day. Eventually, he went back to Islamabad without stepping out of the airport.

 The MQM, believe me, is a fascist party and Altaf has been ordering assassinations.... Musharraf stands exposed for, on the one hand, hes supposed to be helping (President George) Bush fight the war on terror, yet hes himself taking the MQMs support.... Altaf has to answer for the killings on May 12.

 Its unheard of that the head of a party which is in a coalition at the federal level and in a province resides outside the country.... Besides, Altaf is a British citizen.... I cant think of any precedent, Imran said. 

 Chaudhry, of course, has become the rallying point for anti-Musharraf forces and Imran is in the forefront.

 My party stands for insaaf (justice).... Thats why I was one of the first to stand alongside the Chief Justice.... If Pakistan is to move forward, then an independent judiciary is an absolute must.... Its an institution which needs to be respected, Imran pointed out passionately. 

 Now that hed taken on the MQM (incidentally, once seen as contemporary Javed Miandads strongest backer), would he become less disdainful of security?

 For the first time during our conversation, Imran laughed: Dont worry.... I have a mission and believe in destiny.

 Friends, though, have been asking him to be careful.

 Footnote: For whatever reason, Imran didnt enjoy the same following in Sindh as in other regions during his years as a top-class all-rounder. However, that didnt come in the way of plans for a cancer treatment facility in Karachi. The one in Lahore, built in his mothers memory, has brought relief to thousands from the mid-nineties.

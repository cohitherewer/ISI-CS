 Stir rerun at steel mill 

 OUR BUREAU

 Ranchi/Jamshedpur, Aug. 8: Work at Kohinoor Steel came to a grinding halt once again between 7am and3pm today after some JMM workers disrupted transportation of iron ore from Chandil railway yard to the company premises in Seraikela-Kharsawan.

 The JMM supporters prevented the company authorities from unloading iron ore that arrived at the Chandil railway yard in 35 wagons to protest against the alleged injustice meted out to a local JMM leader Sukram Hembram, who transports the minerals to the company premises. 

 We stopped paying Hembrams bill amounting to Rs 70 lakh since we found that the iron ore he supplied to the company was less than the quantity requisitioned by the company. The firm incurred a loss of about Rs 25 lakh for this, said a company functionary. 

 By stopping the transportation of the iron ore from the yard, sources said, Hembram wanted to exert pressure on the local management to withdraw the FIR it had lodged against JMM cadre last month after some party workers went on a rampage on the company premises on July 25. 

 Senior Kohinoor Steel officials rushed to the railway yard today after being informed about the hold-up in the unloading of iron ore and transportation of the mineral.

 The JMM workers used filthy language and even threatened officials of dire consequences if their demands were not met with. However, after discussions they allowed us to continue work in the afternoon, an official said.

 Hembram confessed that he is peeved with the management for lodging a false FIR against him. I also want the management to clear my pending bill. If I have supplied iron ore in less quantity, the management should provide evidence. I am apprehensive that the management is targeting me and harassing me for no fault of mine, he claimed.

 Medics plot entrance racket

 - Scholars flown in for a fee to sit exam for candidates

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, July 21: Two city doctors and a final-year MBBS student have been arrested for running a racket in which scholars with touched-up admit cards would substitute for aspiring candidates at medical entrance tests.

 A father-son duo, who agreed to pay Rs 5.83 lakh, and a Steel Authority of India employee also fell into the net as police widened their probe beyond the city.

 This is the first time such a racket involving doctors has come to light in Bengal.

 Police sources said they didnt know how many had got admission through this route but asserted that the dummy candidates would be picked from a bank of scholars.

 The scholars brilliant students would be selected from across the country, including Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, said an officer involved with the probe, while dummies from Bengal would be used for tests outside the state.

 Detective department chief Ajoy Kumar said the two doctors Mihir Kumar Jha and Ayan Mukhopadhyay and Ranvijay Pathak, the MBBS student, would target candidates trying to get admission through the management quota. The price would vary between Rs 6 lakh and Rs 7 lakh.

 The police said a candidate would be asked to paste a slightly hazy photograph on the admit card, which would be sent to Patna to be touched up on computers to resemble the scholar. He would then be flown in, put up in a hotel, and handed the admit card and a detailed CV of the person he is substituting for so that he doesnt fumble if challenged.

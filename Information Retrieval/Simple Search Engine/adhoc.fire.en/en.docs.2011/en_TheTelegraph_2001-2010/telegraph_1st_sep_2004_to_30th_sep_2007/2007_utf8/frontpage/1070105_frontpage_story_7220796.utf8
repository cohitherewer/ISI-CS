 SHASHANK SHEKHAR

 Bokaro, Jan. 4: Four employees of Bokaro Steel Plant were seriously injured when boiling liquid steel with a temperature of more than 1600C spilled on them during a blast, which occurred as the hot fluid was being poured from one container into another. 

 The accident took place around 10.30 am today while the morning shift was on. The workers were rushed to the Bokaro General Hospital, where the condition of two of them, who suffered more than 75 per cent burns, was stated to be serious. 

 The injured have been identified as G.P. Boury (45), Nakul Vishwakarma (39), S. Mahto (50) and B. Gope (31). 

 Managing director of the steel plant V.K. Srivastav has ordered an inquiry into the matter. 

 The inquiry will be conducted by a four-member committee headed by J.N. Singh, general manager (mechanical); S.N. Prasad, deputy general manager (refractory); R. Bamba, assistant general manager (personnel) and A. K. Lal, assistant general manager (safety) and the report is expected to be submitted within 48 hours. 

 According to Bheem Singh, the operator of the SMS (Steel Metal Shop) II boiler, where the accident took place, the blast took place around 10.30 am when liquid steel was being poured from one container into the other.

 The liquid steel, as a result of the explosion, burst over the place and the four workers, who were standing at a distance of 11 metres. 

 Immediately, the work at the SMS II boiler, which prepares about 300 tonnes of steel in an hour, was stopped for several hours till the spilled liquid steel attained the normal temperature. Only then could the floor be cleaned.

 Speaking to The Telegraph over phone, Basant Kumar Thakur, chief of corporate communication, said the condition of one of the workers was critical. 

 He added that the managing director of the plant had rushed to the site immediately after the accident and even met the victims later.

 The managing director also, Thakur further said, has assured all help to the relatives of the four workers and pledged that all safety precautions will be taken before the work resumed.

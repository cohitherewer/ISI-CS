 Cop clincher to nail DGP

 - Parole extension letter in high court 

 LALMOHAN PATNAIK

 Cuttack, Feb. 16: Rajasthan police has submitted to Orissa High Court a copy of the application state home guards chief B.B. Mahanti reportedly wrote to seek extension of parole to his son Bitihotra.

 The letter dated December 2, 2006, a copy of which is available with The Telegraph, was addressed to the superintendent of a Jaipur jail. The DGP had sought extension of parole to Bitihotra, a rape convict also known as Bitti, on medical and humanitarian grounds.

 The letter was attached to the affidavit which additional superintendent of police, Jaipur city (east), Sanjay Shtotriya, submitted before the high court yesterday.

 Sources in the visiting Rajasthan police team claimed the application would be a clincher in corroborating the allegation that the rape convict who jumped parole on December 4 last year is under the protection of his father.

 The bench of Justice L.K. Mohapatra yesterday extended till February 26 its interim restriction on the arrest of the senior IPS officer. The court would then hear the maintainability of Mahantis anticipatory bail plea.

 Mahantis application claimed his son underwent an electroencephalography test. The test reveal(s) that the person is experiencing emotional stress. There is indication of abnormal brain activity. His mental sickness may be associated with presence of trauma, tumours, hematoma, epilepsy and other seizure disorders and periods of confusion and unconsciousness. He is under medication and sedation, the DGP pleaded while requesting extension of parole for another 15 days on extreme compassionate and humanitarian grounds.

 The application had presented Bitti as an unfortunate victim of motiveless malignity who should receive sympathy and humanistic treatment from the authorities of Rajasthan.

 The contents of the extension application clearly go to show that Bidyabhusan Mahanti is fully aware of the whereabouts of Bitihotra Mahanti and he (Bitti) is in the aegis of his senior IPS officer father, ASP Shtotriya claimed in the affidavit. 

 The senior IPS officer had been from the very beginning emphasising much... to seek parole and when the same was granted, he started requesting for extension of the same. Ultimately when he did not succeed in getting the extension... he took a turn and came out with a strange version totally denying... the grant of parole... on his execution of surety bond, the document said.

 Shtotriya further contended that the planned manner in which the senior IPS officer has been proceeding in the instant case since the beginning is reflected in the incorrect averments made by him in the petition for anticipatory bail.

 The way the senior IPS officer and his wife responded to the Rajasthan police team who visited Cuttack leaves no room for doubt that they know the whereabouts of Bitihotra, the affidavit claimed.

 The senior Mahanti and his wife had started sending applications for grant of parole to their son since September. The basis of the pleas was ill health of father, mother, grandmother or sister. Later, Bitti requested for a medical check-up at Jaipur.

 Subsequently, the youth was transferred to the central jail in Jaipur from the district prison in Alwar. He had earlier been convicted on April 12 for the rape of a German woman.

 Mahanti was not available for comment.

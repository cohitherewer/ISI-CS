 Chennai, June 9: John Emburey struggled to get past the revolving door of the Taj Connemara on the way to the Park Sheraton, venue of this evenings selection meeting to choose the Team India coach.

 Clearly, the former England all-rounder didnt do much better during his presentation before the seven-member special committee of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), chaired by president Sharad Pawar.

 After almost two hours of deliberations, which included nearly 30-minute presentations from each of the two blazer-and-tie-attired candidates, BCCI spokesman N. Srinivasan announced that South African Graham Ford would be Greg Chappells successor.

 While struggling to get out, Emburey had quipped, Ill be giving a tough fight. Thats a promise.

 Its not clear to what extent Emburey ran Ford close, if at all, but The Telegraphs sources on the committee explained that three factors worked to the 46-year-olds advantage.

 First, that hed handled a national team South Africa, from mid-1999 to early 2002. Then, hed worked with big names like the late Hansie Cronje, Allan Donald, Gary Kirsten, Shaun Pollock and Jonty Rhodes. Also, South Africa won a handsome majority of the Test series during his tenure.

 What was left unsaid is that captain Rahul Dravid and at least some of the seniors had indicated their preference for Ford through Ravi Shastri, one of three former captains on the committee.

 As the players have to work with the coach, Pawar and Co. couldnt overlook that. Indeed, it didnt matter that Ford hasnt played international cricket.

 Till something emerges to the contrary, its assumed that the decision was reached unanimously.

 Ford wasnt available for a reaction after his appointment (which will be ratified by the BCCIs working committee on Tuesday), but while setting out for the meeting, hed said: I wouldnt say Ive got butterflies in the stomach. But, in the past few days, too many things have happened too soon.

 Both candidates not only arrived on the same flight from London, early today, but went for the presentation in the same vehicle a Qualis.

 Emburey, one understands, was the first to make the presentation. It was a Power Point one. Ford followed, but he chose to speak of his vision instead of using the laptop.

 The meeting began 25 minutes late as Sunil Gavaskar got delayed on the way from Goa. Yesterday was my mother-in-laws 80th birthday and, this morning, there was a puja. I couldnt have come earlier.

 Embureys name had been suggested by Gavaskar, during Mondays inconclusive meeting in Bangalore, perhaps as a counter of sorts to Shastri proposing Ford.

 Fordie doesnt know what hes letting himself in for! was senior South African pro Mark Bouchers initial reaction. Grinning, he quickly added: I was joking.... Grahams a hands-on guy who wont be competing for the headlines. Hes there for the players and Im sure your team will benefit.

 As expected, Ford has been offered a one-year contract. The option of a two-year extension will be there. He has asked for time to have a dialogue with his current employers, Kent. At the moment, then, one isnt sure when exactly he comes on board.

 Fords contract with the county is till September 2008. Incidentally, Indias first coach from overseas, John Wright, had also been with Kent when he got the job in November 2000.

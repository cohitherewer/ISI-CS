 Murder inside angle

 - Woolmer probably knew killer: Police

 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES

 March 23: The cricket worlds deepest fears came true today as Jamaican police confirmed that Bob Woolmer was strangled to death in his hotel room, probably by one or more persons known to the Pakistan coach.

 Growing suspicion that the match-fixing mafia was behind the murder cast a shadow over the World Cup on a day a big-ticket game pitted rivals from the subcontinent, the hub of the betting racket.

 Former South Africa pacer Allan Donald put the hype over sporting success in perspective saying: I just cant believe that people can go to these lengths about a game of cricket, and suggested the tournament be called off.

 But International Cricket Council CEO Malcolm Speed said the event would be continued to demonstrate that cricket cannot be put off by a cowardly criminal act.

 The police said Woolmers death was caused by asphyxia as a result of manual strangulation and his neck was broken. Bob was a large man it would have taken some force, deputy commissioner Mark Shields said, adding that more than one person could be involved.

 But one theory is that Woolmer may have been drugged first suggesting a planned murder and the toxicologists report is awaited.

 With no sign of forced entry or a struggle, Shields said Woolmer most likely knew the attackers. Common sense would dictate we start on the inside and work out.

 Pakistani players and officials were questioned and fingerprinted yesterday, and were to be DNA swabbed today, but team media manager Pervez Mir suggested this was to find out who else might have visited the 12th-floor room, No. 374.

 The teams departure, scheduled for Saturday, has been put off till Monday or Tuesday, a Pakistan board source said. The players have left Kingston for the resort of Montego Bay.

 Although police officially said the team was free to leave, Islamabad announced it was sending a top diplomat, Khawar Zaidi, with a legal team to Jamaica.

 Team manager Talat Ali denied his players were the only suspects. A former Pakistani player, tainted by the 90s fixing scandal, claimed that phone numbers of several Indian and Sri Lankan players had been recovered from an arrested non-Jamaican suspect.

 The police denied any arrest first claimed by a Pakistani TV channel but didnt say if anyone had been detained.

 Rumours flew about the theft of Woolmers laptop and the manuscripts of a book he had written, apparently revealing details of the match-fixing racket (see box). A team source said the coach had been disturbed about pages of a book he was writing having gone missing.

 There are already whispers about foul play in Pakistans shock defeat by Ireland, which happened hours before Woolmers death.

 A fan said the murder would stain crickets showpiece tournament. No matter which team wins, Woolmers death will emerge the single most eventful thing that happened to this World Cup.

 London, Feb. 26: Jade Goody, who gave Shilpa Shetty a hard time on Celebrity Big Brother, offered her first interview today to Sky Television after arriving suddenly in India on what she claimed was a private visit. 

 The Sky reporter, Alex Crawford, found Jade looking relaxed, which will be a relief to readers of celebrity magazines who have been fed stories of how the mother of two was in a state of near suicidal depression and popping in and out of clinics. 

 Sky caught Jade after she and her agent, Sally Andrews, had visited a monument in Delhi. 

 Jade said: Obviously, Ive said my apologies. Im here on a private visit and Im having meetings with certain people. 

 She had made her surprise visit to India, declaring she was trying to put the Big Brother stuff behind me. 

 Jade, 25, has left boyfriend Jack Tweed, 19, and her two sons, Bobby, three, and Freddy, two, at home and is staying at the Le Meridien in Delhi. 

 People have been really nice out here, she insisted. Its private and there are no cameras or anything. 

 She had travelled by Jet Airways and said that she had spent the first few hours of her trip travelling around the capital as a tourist. 

 I am here on a strictly private visit, she told Sky News. 

 I could have had my entire trip paid for and the people travelling with me could have been paid for but I didnt want that. I am paying for the trip and all the expenses myself. I dont want to be seen to be making money out of what happened. 

 Asked whether she was here to do a deal with an Indian television company in an attempt to rehabilitate her floundering career, her agent replied: No, this is not a business trip. It is strictly private. 

 They also denied they would be meeting Indian politicians during the four-day visit. 

 On being asked whether the row over her treatment of Shilpa had blown over, the former dental nurse said she did not want to make light of what had happened but things were getting better. 

 She said: I only got two hate mails (after the show). People are being all right to me. 

 When she had visited the monument, there had apparently been a good response from the Indian public to her presence. 

 Jade has been to India before to do research on her own brand perfume called Ssssh! The bottling factory is in India but the perfume has now been taken off the shelves in Britain.

 At the height of the race row, the India tourism office in London issued an open invitation to her to come to the country to find out for herself about the culture and the people. 

 In advertisements placed in several national newspapers, including the Guardian and The Daily Telegraph, an open letter to Jade Goody and friends stated: Dear Jade Goody. Once your current commitments are over, may we invite you to experience the healing nature of India. Being one of the worlds oldest civilisations, our land is one where the ancient and the modern co-exist and a multitude of religions live in harmony. As a beauty therapist, you may be especially interested in visiting one of the many spas where you can cleanse your stresses away. You could enjoy yoga in the land that invented it and experience Ayurvedic healing which promotes positive health and natural beauty. 

 Her hosts never imagined she would take up their offer. 

 If Jade travels to Mumbai, Shilpa has said she will welcome her former tormentor but privately, rather than at a press conference.

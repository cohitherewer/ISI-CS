 Mamoni lines up options 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Shillong, May 5: Assamese author Mamoni Raisom Goswami today said it was high time that Delhi took steps to hold direct talks with Ulfa. The government must take the first step, she stressed, revealing that the PCG had lined up alternatives that it would put to practice next month. 

 Goswami, who was in Shillong for a book release function, said she was convinced that the peace process would be hampered without an interface between Delhi and the Ulfa leadership. 

 Goswami is part of the Peoples Consultative Group (PCG), which has been mediating between Ulfa and the government. 

 We will wait for a month and if nothing happens, we will suggest amendments which can take the peace process forward, she said. However, she was optimistic that the peace process would be revived, though she refused to divulge her options. 

 The government can also come up with a new proposal, she said, hinting at the possibility of a separate dialogue between PCG members and the Centre prior to reinforcing the peace initiatives. 

 She revealed that she has talked to Ulfa chief Paresh Baruah over telephone and would convince the outfit to come for talks, provided the Centre took the first call.

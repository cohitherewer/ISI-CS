 Ulfa duo held in Punjab

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, Aug. 13: Two suspected Ulfa militants were arrested in Jalandhar today in a joint operation by Western Command military intelligence and Punjab police. 

 Jalandhar senior superintendent of police Arpit Shukla said Hemanta Roy and Jagdish Das were rounded up following intelligence reports about their suspicious activities. We seized five driving licences, two PAN cards, a camera, defence maps and some sensitive documents from them, Shukla said. 

 Roy, who hails from Shingrapara village in Assams Baksa district, is a member of Ulfas 709 battalion and a relative of Hira Sarania, the commander of the unit. Das was his associate, Shukla said. 

 Das has been living in Jalandhar for the past four months. He was picked up from Domariapull, but no arms or ammunition were found on him. Roy joined Das three months ago and was working as a waiter in the hotel from where he was arrested. 

 This is perhaps the first time that we have had specific information on Ulfa militants in Punjab. The cell could have been tasked with procuring guns from across the border or via Jammu and Kashmir or could have had nefarious designs to destabilise the region with the help of Pakistans ISI, an army officer said. 

 The police have registered a case under Sections 124 A (sedition) and 120 B (conspiracy) of the IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the Officials Secrets Act.

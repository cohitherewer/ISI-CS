 Film stunt turns fatal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bokaro, Aug. 17: Vinay Kumar wanted to be John Abraham or Hrithik Roshan to dhoom past the streets of the steel city before his Apache smashed into an electric pole after killing two, including him, and injuring four.

 The Class XI student of DAV, Bokaro, Vinay got his dream bike just three months ago from his parents who stay at Bhagalpur in Bihar.

 However, this morning was a bit different when the teenager bunked classes before being adventurous taking two of his classmates along. 

 Police sources said that Vinay, with his classmates, Sapan Kumar Rai and Ravi Mahto, after attending their morning prayer at school went for a fast ride with a promise to show his speed skill.

 Fooling his teachers on a lame excuse that he was on way to get books, Vinay, 17, left the school in Sector IV at a very fast speed hitting a vegetable vendor first but did not even bothered to stop as he increased his speed to hit another morning walker just 400m away. 

 Even The Telegraph photographer Pankaj Singh had a close shave who was overtaken on the left as the students laughed and sped away fast.

 Reaching Pathharkatta Chowk near the crossing of Sector IV and V, Vinay hit morning walker R.N. Singh of Sector III who died on the spot. Not in a mood to slow a bit, Vinay then hit Bokaro steel employee Ranjit Ranjan Prasad of Sector IV and then hit an electric pole and got wounded.

 Even before the students were rushed to Bokaro General Hospital, Vinay had died. 

 The other two both critical were admitted to a private nursing home.

 The school authorities were taken aback as how the students escaped without official information as they were under the impression that they were in the classrooms.

 A case has been lodged against the students at Sector IV police station of Bokaro and further investigation is going on, said an officer of the police station.

 June 27: Movement of train has been stopped following a blast, triggered by the Maoists, on the most commercially viable railways section.

 The rebels, as part of their economic blockade, blew up a portion of the railway tracks between Daniya and Dumri Vihar stations in the small hours today disrupting traffic on the CIC section.

 Following this, divisional railway manager Ajay Shukla said that the restoration of movement on this section would start on Friday.

 The Maoists had blocked the tracks near Daniya station last night by unloading three trucks of coal. Even on the NH-2 between Dumri and Girdih, a few trucks were deflated affecting movement for more than two hours.

 Inspector-general of police (North Chhotanagpur) B.B. Pradhan said that barring few incidents of violence, the economic blockade had no major impact though the railways suffered losses running in several crores. Police have been deployed in Naxalite-hit areas as a precautionary measure.

 Four trains from Ranchi and Hatia have been cancelled tomorrow.

 South Eastern Railway senior divisional commercial manager Vivek Srivastava said that the Tata-Jammu Tawi Express, Hatia-Jammu Tawi Express, Hatia-Delhi Jharkhand Swarna Jayanti Express and the Ranchi-Ajmer Express would remain cancelled.

 The cancellation of the four trains was to be done because of the non-arrival of the rakes concerned due to the economic blockade enforced by the rebels, Srivastava said.

 But Eeast Central Railway senior PRO (Dhanbad) Amarendra Das said that depending on the situation, they would ply the Gomoh-Barkakana passenger that would leave Gomoh at 6am tomorrow.

 PTI adds that three live bombs were found on railway tracks near Biramdih station, 55km from Purulia in Bengal, which the Maoists burnt down early today.

 The signalling system of the station was destroyed by the fire, affecting train movement on Purulia-Chandil section of Adra division.

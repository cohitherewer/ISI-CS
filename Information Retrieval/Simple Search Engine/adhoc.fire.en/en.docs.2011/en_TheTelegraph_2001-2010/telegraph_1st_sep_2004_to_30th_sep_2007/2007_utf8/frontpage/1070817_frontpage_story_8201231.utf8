 All-party talks over Naga unity plea 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Imphal, Aug. 16: Chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh has convened an all-party meeting tomorrow to discuss a memorandum submitted by six Naga legislators and a Naga MP from Manipur to the Prime Minister in support of the demand for Naga integration. 

 The memorandum, submitted on July 28, states that any settlement between Delhi and the NSCN (Isak-Muivah) will not be acceptable to the Nagas. 

 We do not want piecemeal solutions which allow the authorities to divide and rule and undermine the democratic structure of the country. That is why any settlement reached between the government of India and the NSCN (I-M) must result in the unification of all Naga territory, the memorandum stated. 

 The document was signed by Outer Lok Sabha MP Mani Charenamei and Opposition MLAs Morung Makunga, Khashim Ruivah, Awangbou Newmai, Danny Shaiza, W. Keishing and K. Raina. They are all Independent MLAs and were sponsored by the United Naga Council in the February Assembly elections. 

 The petitioners also alleged that the Meiteis, who are in a majority in the state, were neglecting the minority community. 

 Ibobi Singh convened the meeting after delegates of the Opposition Manipur Peoples Party called on Governor S.S. Sidhu, Speaker S. Budhichandra Singh and him over the memorandum. 

 Led by party president and former deputy chief minister L. Chandramani Singh, the delegates urged the trio to convene a special session of the Assembly to discuss the conduct of the Naga legislators. 

 They maintained that the memorandum was a threat to the states territorial integrity and communal harmony. 

 Seeking disintegration of Manipur after being a member of the state Assembly is unbecoming of a legislator. The matter needs to be discussed by the House without any delay, Chandramani Singh said. 

 He said Sidhu gave them a patient hearing. Ibobi Singh is understood to have taken a serious note of the development. 

 MPP leader Okram Joy Singh warned that the party would not remain silent if the chief minister refused to convene the special session.

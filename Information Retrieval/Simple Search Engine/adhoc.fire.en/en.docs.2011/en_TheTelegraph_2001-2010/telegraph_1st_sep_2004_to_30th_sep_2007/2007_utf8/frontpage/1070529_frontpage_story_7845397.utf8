 Before results, CBSE spills burning truth 

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, May 28: The nearly seven lakh students who will wake up tomorrow to their Class X results will have to contend with another revelation.

 The Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE) will burn all answer scripts three months after the results are declared.

 Along with the answer scripts, any chance students have of using the Right to Information Act to verify if their answer scripts were evaluated properly will also burn to ashes. 

 The CBSE made this declaration before the Central Information Commission on an appeal seeking details of the re-evaluation process that the board follows post-examination. 

 The board replied to the appeal, saying it had no re-evaluation process in place. Instead, it has a mechanism under which a student can seek re-totalling of marks. 

 The CBSE claimed that, therefore, it had no details to divulge. Some other boards have a re-evaluation system. 

 While the absence of a re-evaluation system under the CBSE is known, several students over the past two years since the Right to Information Act came into place have sought copies of their answer scripts. It was assumed that the new act would make the examination system more transparent.

 The act makes citizens eligible to receive documented information up to 20 years old. 

 But if our answer scripts are destroyed within three months, the CBSE is making a mockery of the act, Rajiv Shukla, a Class X student at Delhi Public School RK Puram, said. 

 Central Information Commission officials said they, too, were shocked at the revelation. The commission is learnt to be thinking of asking the CBSE to put in place a proper re-evaluation system. 

 A senior CBSE official said the board was forced to destroy the answer scripts as the large numbers become unmanageable. 

 While the guidelines give us freedom over how to destroy the papers, burning them is the best way... in the students interest. This prevents their marks from ever falling into wrong hands, a tension we live with till the papers are destroyed, he said. 

 Now, only schools and individual 

 students can access marks.

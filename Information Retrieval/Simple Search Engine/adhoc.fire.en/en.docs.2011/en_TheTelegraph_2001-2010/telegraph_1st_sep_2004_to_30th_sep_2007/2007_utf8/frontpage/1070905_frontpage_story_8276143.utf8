 Police inactive, bank knocks HC door for CBI probe

 CHANDRAJIT MUKHERJEE

 Ranchi, Sept. 4: The Bank of Baroda filed a petition with the high court today requesting for CBI probe in a police case filed against Binod Sinha.

 Sinha, known for his proximity to chief minister Madhu Koda, has allegedly taken Rs 2 crore as loan from the Chaibasa branch of the bank to provide tractors to beneficiaries in May last year.

 The petition has been filed by the banks general manager, Sukumar Saha, for initiating action by the authorities concerned for investigation of a police case filed in Chaibasa against Sinha and his partners Manoj Kumar Sinha, Vikas Kumar Sinha and Sunil Kumar Sinha for cheating the bank.

 Saha has mentioned about an FIR filed against Sinha and his partners by the banks Chaibasa branch manager, Lal Fani Sahdeo, in the same month. Sahdeo has stated in the report before the police that Sinhas partnership firm had contacted the bank to finance loans for a particular scheme of the government by which tractors would be provided to beneficiaries.

 Saha said that the police are not investigating the case filed against Sinha and harassing innocent bank officials against whom Sinha has filed a false case with the same police station. Sinha enjoys political patronage and lodged a false case against the bank to put pressure on the officials to not follow the case against his firm, Saha alleged.

 Sinhas firm collected as many as 87 applications from different areas in West Singhbhum and furnished the forms along with other necessary documents for getting the loan amount to purchase the tractors and other necessary fittings to be used for agricultural and commercial purposes. The bank financed Rs 3.84 crore and loaned the amount through Sinhas firm to beneficiaries. As per the norms, the application forms were to be attached with land possession certificates of the beneficiaries and without the certificates the loan could not be finalised. It has been alleged by the bank that Sinhas firm produced many forged certificates which were detected on subsequent scrutiny by the bank. But Sinha threatened the officials with dire consequences, Saha said.

 Wipro to set up major hub

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Aug. 4: Information and technology giant Wipro will soon set up the states biggest software development centre, where 15,000 IT engineers would be employed.

 Chief information officer of Wipro Laxman Badiga, who met chief minister Naveen Patnaik in the secretariat here last evening, said the company would open a global training centre, too, in Orissa. 

 The new training centre would be similar to the companys Global Training Centre in Mysore. The proposed hub, to be constructed on the Puri-Konark Marine Drive, would have facilities to train about 3,000 persons, said the states information and technology director Vishal Dev.

 Wipro, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, had signed a MoU with the state government in 2004 to set up its software development centre with a proposed investment of about Rs 200 crore. It was allotted 27 acres of land in Infocity, opposite to the Infosys centre. The construction work has begun and the work is expected to be complete by 2008.

 Wipro is among the four major IT firms for whom a 130-acre special economic zone is being carved out of the 350-acre Infocity-I. The other three companies are Hexaware, MindTree and TCS.

 Significantly, Orissa has witnessed a spurt in its export earnings from the information technology sector in 2006-07. In 2005-06, the earnings were Rs 465 crore but it shot up to Rs 732 crore in the next fiscal.

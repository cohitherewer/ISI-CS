 IT professional run over on Sector V killer stretch

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 8: An infotech professional in his thirties was knocked down and killed by a car that veered off course apparently because the driver dozed off on a treacherous stretch in Salt Lakes Sector V.

 Debasish Sau, a senior business analyst with Cognizant Technology Solutions, was out on his daily morning walk around 6 am when the white Ambassador hit him from behind.

 As Debasish Sau collapsed on the bonnet, the frightened driver stepped on the accelerator. The car then knocked down a cyclist before choking to a halt.

 A bleeding Sau slipped from the bonnet. Minutes later, he was dead, yards from the intersection that leads to his workplace in the showpiece infotech hub.

 Police said the driver of the car ironically, hired by another infotech company might have dozed off because he was working through the night an occupational hazard stalking industries that run round the clock on shifts.

 Accidents have happened while cars ferry employees home but this is possibly the first time that an infotech professional has been killed on the doorstep of Sector V while taking a stroll.

 The loss of a life also brought under glare the shoddy upkeep of roads in Sector V and the lack of police force to monitor traffic. The industry has been repeatedly complaining to the authorities about both problems, and the fork is infamous for a spate of accidents. (See Metro)

 Ajayendra Mukherjee, the vice-president of Tata Consultancy Services, said the intersection leading to Sector V was dangerous for pedestrians. We had voiced our concerns to the police. Today, our fears came true, he said.

 It is an unfortunate incident. His parents have been informed and they are arriving from Orissa. We have started a case, said North 24-Parganas police chief Praveen Kumar.

 Sau, whose father is a doctor in Bhubaneswar, had joined Sector V recently and was staying as a paying guest in a house in AE Block.

 He was walking close to the footpath when the Ambassador suddenly swerved and hit him from behind. He fell on the bonnet. The car then hit a cyclist before coming to a halt, said S.P. Bhattacharya, the constable on duty at the traffic post near the accident site.

 Sau and the injured cyclist, Tapas Das, were taken to Bidhan Nagar Sub-divisional Hospital, where doctors declared the professional dead. 

 Bidhan Nagar (East) police have charged the 35-year-old driver with culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

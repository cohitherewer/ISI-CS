 Anti-Posco activists gear up

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, April 11: Anti-Posco activists and social organisations today warned the state government of a repeat of Nandigram and Kalinga Nagar like situation in Jagatsinghpur area as tension mounted at the proposed steel plant site following beefing up of police force around the area.

 The Naveen Patnaik-led government has already brought in 12 platoons of armed force to enter the three gram panchayats of Dhinkia, Nuagaon and Gadakujanga, part of the proposed site for Poscos Rs 52,000-crore integrated steel project.

 We are trying to normalise the situation so that panchayat polls can be held here, said Jagatsinghpur SP Y.K. Jethwa.

 Jethwa asserted that police wanted to remove the bamboo gates as the rural polls, which could not be held in 13 booths in the area in February, were to be conducted there.

 There is no link to the Posco project.

 Activists of the Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti (PPSS) today held a preparatory meeting at Dhinkia.

 As Dhinkia, the nerve centre of the anti-Posco agitation, will possibly be the target of police action from three sides (Paradip, Trilochanpur and Balitutha), we have also mobilised our activists accordingly, Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti leader Abhay Sahu told The Telegraph over phone.

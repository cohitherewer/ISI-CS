 Woman in medic net

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 22: One more arrest was made today in the medical entrance scam as investigators said the network extends beyond the states borders.

 Smita Chatterjee, 25, was picked 

 up from Durgapur. She had allegedly introduced a girl seeking 

 admission to kingpins Mihir Kumar Jha and Ayan Mukhopadhyay, 

 arrested yesterday. A second-year medical student from a 

 university near Kanpur wrote the exam for the Bengal girl 

 and secured her a rank in the 700s. The Kanpur student is 

 on the run, police said.

 Port of Spain, March 17: Team Indias innings today could almost be a dj vu of its last few one-dayers but for a small difference.

 If the series win against Sri Lanka in February had provided a timely boost to the Blues World Cup hopes, minnows Bangladesh gave them a most untimely jolt, bowling them out for 191.

 For the rest, Sourav Ganguly (66) was top-scorer again, Yuvraj Singh (47) showed glimpses of the form that had clinched the Lanka series, and Virender Sehwag (2) disappointed once more.

 The Delhi opener may have just managed to avoid the sort of careless run-out he was guilty of in the teams last ODI, but failed to erase the questions over his temperament.

 In the games first over, as he jogged lazily for a run, his heel luckily landed inside the crease in the nick of time even though his bat had stayed in the air.

 In the next over he was gone, chopping one from outside the off on to his stumps a method of getting out that is becoming a habit with many in the Indian top order.

 Former West Indian fast bowler Colin Croft, watching from the commentary box, grinned as he saw Mashrafe Mortaza use the bounce and movement to finish with four for 38.

 If I had the opportunity to bowl on this surface, it would have meant death for the Indians, he said with a wink.

 Nor did the Indians stand up to spin, with left-arm tweakers Mohammad Rafique and Abdur Razzak snaring three each to strangle them from 157 for four to 159 for nine.

 In office, a risk lurks in lasers

 - Study raises fears of emission linked to toner in printers

 Print poison?

 Delhi, Aug. 1: If you are working in a no- smoking office and feeling safe, keep a wary eye on the ubiquitous laser printer and ask the boss to ensure good ventilation.

 Some laser printers widely used in offices and homes release tiny, microscopic particles that may enter human lungs and pose a health hazard, scientists in Australia reported today.

 Physicist Lydia Morawska and her colleagues at the Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, believe the particles come from the toner the ultrafine powder used in laser printers to produce text and images.

 The researchers have said people may be able to lower the risk of inhaling the particles by ensuring that rooms in offices and homes with laser printers are well-ventilated to allow any emitted particles to escape.

 The scientists investigated emissions from 62 printers and classified 17 as high emitters. One of the printers they examined released particles at a rate comparable to the particle emissions from cigarette smoking, the researchers said today in a report in the journal Environmental Science and Technology. 

 The study also found that 37 of the 62 printers emitted no particles, six released only low levels and two released medium levels. The study included models sold under the Canon, HP, Ricoh and Toshiba brand names.

 The findings have prompted the researchers to call on governments to consider regulating emissions from laser printers. By all means, this is an important indoor source of pollution. There should be regulations, Morawska said.

 In response to a query, HP said it is currently reviewing the Queensland University research on particle emission characteristics of office printers. As part of its quality controls, HP assesses its printing systems and original print cartridges for dust release and possible material emissions to ensure compliance with applicable international health and safety requirements, the company said.

 HP has had a programme since 1992 to take environmental impact into account for every design and lifecycle phase of a product. This includes the environmental impact of a product on the consumer and the environment.

 Attempts to contact other companies named in the study failed.

 Morawska conceded that more research is needed to study the chemistry of the particles and to determine whether they have any health effects. Even small concentrations can be related to health hazards, Morawska said.

 The small size of the particles allows them to be inhaled and be lodged in the narrow passages in the lungs where they could pose a health hazard, according to the researchers. The health effects from such inhaled particles would depend on the exact composition of the particles but, Morawska said, they might range from mere respiratory irritation to more severe illnesses such as heart disease or cancer.

 The Queensland team discovered the emissions from laser printers by accident.

 The scientists were trying to study the efficiency of ventilation systems in an office when they observed the emissions from laser printers. They found that indoor air pollution increased five times during work hours. The printers emitted more particles when operating with new toner cartridges and when printing graphics and images which require greater quantities of toner.

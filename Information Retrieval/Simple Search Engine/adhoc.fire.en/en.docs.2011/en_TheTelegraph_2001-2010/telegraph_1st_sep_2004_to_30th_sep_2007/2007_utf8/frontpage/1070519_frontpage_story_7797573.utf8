 Underworld implicates IG

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, May 18: A senior IPS officer of the Orissa cadre was today placed under suspension for his alleged links with the underworld in Jharkhand. 

 Inspector General of Police Sanjiv Marik (52) was not, however, arrested. The Orissa DGP said legal action will follow amid strong indication that the government is toying with the idea of filing a case of criminal conspiracy against the IG, posted as the director of Biju Patnaik State Police Training Academy. 

 He is accused of helping a gang of six robbers from Jharkhand, who were allegedly involved in looting Rs 21 lakh at Bhadrak in February this year. The money was being shifted to a bank when the criminals struck. Two bank employees were killed and five people were injured in the gunfire. 

 Marik himself is said to have family links with Jharkhand, having been born in Santhal Pargana. 

 Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today said the suspension followed a probe report submitted by the states director- general of police to the home secretary late on Thursday evening. There is prima facie evidence against the officer. We will initiate legal and disciplinary proceedings against him, the CM said. 

 The probe report nailing Marik has reportedly described how the IG helped and hosted some of the gang members, who had been arrested and lodged in Bhadrak jail, in planning their escape.

 The DGPs report is said to have claimed it was with Mariks tacit support the gang members from Jamshedpur went to Bhadrak jail to plan a rescue operation. They, however, failed.

 Last month a joint police team from Bhadrak and Jamshedpur had followed leads and arrested several gang-members from Patna, Hajipur and Dalmianagar areas of Bihar in separate raids. 

 They allegedly confessed to have planned and executed the heist in association with local miscreants.

 Last week, the DGP had admitted that he had a video-taped confession by the criminals in his possession.

 The clamour for Miriks arrest grew today though IPS officers refused to comment. They appeared to be in a state of shock.

 The controversial officer was SP of Bhubaneswar for more than four years during Biju Patnaik government.

 Water panic in Howrah

 Howrah, Sept. 8: Taps across Howrah town went dry today but many of the 10 lakh residents would not have touched the water anyway.

 Supply was stopped from the Padmapukur treatment plant, which feeds 44 of the 50 wards, after a decomposed body was found in its reservoir last night. 

 After 14 hours of cleaning, supply resumed in some parts from 4pm and was expected to become normal by night.

 The mayor said there were no reports of illnesses but officials admitted that with the plants testing equipment defunct, the degree of contamination could not be ascertained.

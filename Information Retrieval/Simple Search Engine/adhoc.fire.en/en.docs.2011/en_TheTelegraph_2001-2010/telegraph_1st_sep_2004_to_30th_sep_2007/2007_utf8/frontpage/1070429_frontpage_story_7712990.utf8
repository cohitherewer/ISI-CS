 Patna, April 28: Life once again imitated art here. And 19-year-old Varun, arrested for auto-lifting, claims to have been inspired by the character played by John Abraham in Dhoom four years ago.

 Besotted with Abrahams performance, the teenager decided to become a speed-biker and went on an auto-lifting spree.

 His middle class family is devastated. One of his brothers is a doctor and another one an engineer. His father retired from Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. 

 An unfazed Varun told his interrogators that doctors and engineers are known only in particular cities or even localities. But his ambition is larger than life: to become a don like Dawood Ibrahim or his aide.

 He and his accomplices had lifted six motorcycles from Kankarbagh, Phulwari, Buddha Colony and Kadamkuan areas of the Bihar capital during the last three months.

 His luck, however, ran out this week when the teenager, sporting Abrahams hairstyle and imitating his mannerisms, was about to grab another motorcycle at gunpoint. A police patrol happened to be passing and the teenager was overpowered.

 Varun, who has studied till Class 12, came to Patna six months ago and started living with his friends at Mandiri, an undeclared den of petty criminals. 

 Mantu, his accomplice, told police that Varun had found an ultimate negative hero in John in Dhoom. John is so much in his mind that he has not appreciated Hrithik in Dhoom 2. 

 Smartly dressed in branded clothes and sporting an expensive wristwatch, the teenager, charged under the Arms Act, is likely to spend three to six years behind bars. But once he comes out of jail, he would leave for Mumbai for an apprenticeship that will, he hopes, turn him into a big underworld don one day.

 Teen found hanging inside schoolbus

 A STAFF REPORTER

 March 28: The body of a teenaged handyman of a schoolbus was found hanging from the roof of the vehicle in Fatasil Ambari this morning with circumstantial evidence pointing towards suicide. 

 With police yet to commit before the post-mortem report is out, the residents of the area alleged that the victim, Tapan Chandra Barman, aged 16, could have been murdered. 

 The police said Barman was working as the handyman of the schoolbus (AS-01 H/5438) of Sankardev Sishu Niketan. He was a resident of Nizaraban Path in Fatasil Ambari.

 Soon after the body was noticed hanging inside the bus parked near Tula factory, the people beat up the driver of the bus, Mohammad Hussain Ali, and school guard Khagen Chetri, suspecting them to be the killers. Both were later handed over to the police.

 The people alleged that the duo may have killed the boy earlier and strung him up to make it look like suicide. Their fears were fuelled by the fact that the boys feet were touching the floor of the bus. 

 The incident came to light when Ali noticed the body around 8 am and raised an alarm.

 We suspect it to be murder and demand a thorough inquiry by the police. We have came to know that the driver and the guard had an argument with the victim and they had even assaulted Barman before his body was found, P.K. Das, a resident of the area, said.

 Both the accused have been detained for interrogation and the body sent for autopsy.

 The police said the body was found hanging from a handle on the roof of the bus with a rope. We cant say whether it is a suicide or murder without the post-mortem report. For the time being, we have registered a case of unnatural death and if we find any foul play, we will register a case of murder, a police officer of Fatasil Ambari police station said.

 The driver told us that Barman washed the bus at that particular time everyday. But today when Ali went up to see whether Barman was doing his job properly, he was shocked to see him hanging from the roof. We are verifying his statement, the officer added. Additional SP (city) Rajen Singh said initial circumstances do not indicate murder. We have not been able to arrive at any conclusion as investigation is still on, he added.

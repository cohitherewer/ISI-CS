 A tale of two 

 scarlet women

 - One was forced into prostitution, the other opted for it 

 It's my life

 Mamoni Raisom Goswami

 The 

 author recalls the time when she first saw a prostitute, 

 during her stay in Jammu amp; Kashmir

 I still remember my first sight 

 of a prostitute, in flesh and blood. 

 It was a long time ago but the 

 exact moment is still etched in my memory like the haunting 

 theme music of a well-made film. At that time I was at Riyasi 

 in Jammu and Kashmir with my engineer husband Madhu and 

 his official dwelling was close to a forest of pine and 

 maple trees. 

 There inside the forest was the 

 memorial of a freedom fighter killed by the British. The 

 stone and concrete memorial had then become the shelter 

 of a peer (soothsayer), who was supposed to have 

 divine powers. I had heard that he could tell many things 

 about a person just by looking at his or her face.

 I was very curious to meet the 

 man. One day, when Madhu had gone to his work site, I asked 

 our two helpers, Keya and Sitamadev, to accompany me to 

 the peer. 

 Just a few hundred metres into 

 the woods led to an incredible sight. There, sitting by 

 a tree was a woman with tattered clothes, which barely covered 

 her body. It was a sight, which took me completely by surprise. 

 As I looked at the woman in stunned 

 silence, I could only wonder who she was. My thoughts were 

 interrupted all of a sudden when our middle-aged Oriya domestic 

 help Sitamadev caught hold of my hand and virtually dragged 

 me from the place, whispering faintly, She is a prostitute...she 

 is a prostitute..... 

 I had the same shock many years 

 later, during my stay in Vrindavan. One day, my teacher 

 called me and said, I am sending to you a lady who 

 wants a letter drafted. Kindly do it. 

 Instantly, there appeared a young 

 woman in saffron clothes at my door. She introduced herself 

 and said, I have come from Bajali, in the Pathsala 

 area.

 When did you take to the 

 life of an ascetic? I asked her. In reply, she only 

 gave me an enigmatic smile and parried my question. 

 On a few earlier occasions also, 

 in Guwahati itself, I had come across a few Assamese mendicant 

 women. I was glad to find, after a long time, a girl from 

 Assam. I treated her to tea and snacks. Then I asked in 

 what language, Assamese, Hindi or English, she wanted the 

 letter to be written. 

 Giving me a sweet smile, she said, 

 Let it be in English. He can follow it. The 

 letter revealed to me that the woman lived with a well-to-do 

 man, who also happened to be an ascetic of sorts. The man 

 also had a temple to live in Ahmedabad, where he was away 

 at that time and taking advantage of his absence, some local 

 rowdies had started harassing her. 

 She appealed to him to return. 

 Having written the letter, I said to her, If you find 

 it unsafe to live in your temple, you could temporarily 

 shift to ours. Under the protective shade of my teacher, 

 everybody lives here in peace.

 Once again, she gave me an enigmatic 

 smile. I felt rather puzzled at her behaviour. As she left, 

 Lalita Dasi, who was observing the woman at my door while 

 she was busy sweeping the courtyard, came to me and stood 

 beside my writing desk. 

 A nauseating smell always emanated 

 from Lalita Dasis body. Her complexion was fair, but 

 she did not give herself a regular wash. As a result, smears 

 of dirt freckled her face and hands and other parts of the 

 body. She was often seen sitting with the beggars in front 

 of different temples. 

 Then, with an air of surprise 

 writ large on her face, she said, This woman for whom 

 you wrote a letter just now hails from Assam. You dont 

 seem to have any suspicion of her ways.

 No, I dont, 

 I said. 

 Then she came close to me and 

 whispered in my ears, She lives on this sacred soil 

 of Vraj, smears sandalwood paste on her forehead, wraps 

 herself with saffron clothes and also sports a garland of 

 beads. But can you imagine what her vocation is?

 By no means can I, 

 I cried in consternation. What is it, to be sure? 

 Shes a prostitute. 

 Thats how shes known in this place.

 A prostitute? You say this 

 woman is a prostitute? Sounds so incredible!

 Her revelation struck me dumb 

 with surprise! The image of the woman came to my mind vividly. 

 Her complexion was like that of earthenware glowing in the 

 light of a lamp. An oval face, and the eyes far from large. 

 And her hair? Well, her shock 

 of hair itself seemed to be the abode of all her mysteries. 

 It was thick, long and dark and had a peculiar shine to 

 it. Her age was difficult to determine. For many people, 

 the face is hardly an index of ones age, which lies 

 hidden under a deceptive mask of flesh and blood. So it 

 was, for this woman, too. 

 From her looks, you could hardly 

 say how old she was.

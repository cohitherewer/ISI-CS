 Cricket? For beer guzzlers 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 8: Prodded by Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, Indias MPs may have wished Rahul Dravids boys success in the World Cup. But today they made their contempt for cricket plain.

 Its a game only for rich, lazy people drinking beer in the afternoon, Biju Janata Dals Tathagata Satpathy said. The Shiv Senas Suresh Prabhu compared cricket fever to another fever dengue.

 Yet it could be good news for Indian cricket, considering the health of the sports the politicians professed to love: football, kabaddi, hockey, archery, volleyball, kho-kho almost any game as long as it wasnt played on 22 yards.

 Too much emphasis on cricket was pushing these neglected sports towards oblivion, the MPs were agreed.

 What they didnt say was that unlike cricket, the neglected sports have almost always been run by politicians.

 Congress leader Suresh Kalmadi has been athletics boss for years, with hardly anything to show for it. V.K. Malhotra and his BJP colleague Yashwant Sinha manage archery and tennis.

 The Congresss Jagdish Tytler, Digvijay Singh and K.P. Singh Deo head the judo, rifle-shooting and rowing federations. The Chautalas, Abhay and Ajay, run boxing and table tennis. During P.R. Das Munshis two decades at the helm of football, Indias world rankings have slipped from the 90s to the high 150s.

 In cricket, Indias steepest rise came when it had non-politicians managing the game in the country.

 The MPs didnt seem to spot the irony in their words or the action accompanying them. As they trashed cricket, they passed a bill that forces private channels to share sport telecasts with DD so that those without cable, too, can watch Team India play.

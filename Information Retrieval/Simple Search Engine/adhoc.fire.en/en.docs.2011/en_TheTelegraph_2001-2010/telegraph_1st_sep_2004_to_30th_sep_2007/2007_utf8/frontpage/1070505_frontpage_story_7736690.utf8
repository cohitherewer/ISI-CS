 Govt unveils rehab policy

 - Announcement after cabinet nod

 RANJAN DASGUPTA 

 Ranchi, May 4: The much-awaited rehabilitation and resettlement policy of the Jharkhand government has been finalised and approved by senior UPA leaders.

 Sources in the states industries department informed that the policy awaits the nod of the cabinet before being notified.

 The elaborate policy, they claimed, is possibly the best bargain unveiled so far by any state government. It is meant for companies investing a minimum of Rs 100 crore in the state and, thus, will not be applicable to small and medium-sized industrial units.

 It provides for compensation, payment for land acquired at prices determined by a panel in each district, alternative land in the industrial township and additional money to build temporary shelter as well as a new dwelling unit.

 Besides, one member from each displaced family to be given employment by the company. In addition, Rs 2,000 will be paid every month to each family for two years as a kind of sustenance allowance.

 A flat rate of compensation has been proposed for families losing land to industry. The maximum compensation of Rs 5 lakh has been proposed for families losing their entire land.

 For families not losing their entire land, the compensation goes down progressively but a minimum compensation of Rs 2 lakh is assured for even those families residing on government land. Those who lose one-third of their land holding are assured Rs 3 lakh. The payment for land will be over and over this compensation, explained industry department officials. 

 The families will be given three options under which they would be able to collect the full compensation or spend half of it to buy shares of the company or, finally, invest the entire compensation in fixed deposits or mutual funds. The draft policy is said to have been approved by the JMM leader Shibu Soren, now in jail, and chief minister Madhu Koda. 

 It is likely to be announced any time later this month after the formal cabinet approval.

 The draft policy also provides a liberal definition of the family. Husband, wife, aged parents, unmarried daughters and sisters, sons and minor brothers are all included in the family. And also any other member staying with the family for at least the previous three years.

 The investors will also have to assure a job per family and land up to one acre in the township meant for the companys employees. In case the displaced family is not willing to accept land in that zone, he will be entitled for an additional compensation of Rs 1 lakh.

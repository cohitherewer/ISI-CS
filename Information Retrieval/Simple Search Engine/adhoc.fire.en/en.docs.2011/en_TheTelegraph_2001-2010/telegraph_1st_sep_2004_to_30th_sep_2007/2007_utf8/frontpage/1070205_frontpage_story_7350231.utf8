 Retirement scramble post-attack

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 4: As many as 11 forest officials of the Kamakhyanagar division have applied for voluntary retirement after three of their colleagues fell prey to Naxalite brutality on late Wednesday night. 

 We have not been provided with even a lathi to protect ourselves. We shall rather opt for voluntary retirement rather than being killed by the Maoists, said Brajabandhu Behera, a forest official.

 Another staff, on condition of anonymity, echoed his sentiments and said he was panicked after their colleagues were killed by the extremists. A group of Maoists had, on Wednesday night, dragged three forest officials in their sleep, stoned them, slit their throats and finally gunned them down. 

 Manager of Kamakhyanagar division of Orissa Forest Development Corporation Dillip Das said the three employees had earlier opted for VRS on health grounds. However, others had applied after the Maoist carnage.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Nagaon, Aug. 29: A jawan of the Bihar regiment allegedly raped a 42-year-old Karbi woman in an interior village under Hauraghat police station on Monday.

 The family members of the victim led by a Karbi womens organisation, filed an FIR in Diphu police station today alleging that a team of the army regiment entered Mansingh Bey village, 14km from Haur-aghat police station, at midnight and raped the woman. 

 Karbi Anglong deputy commissioner M. Angamuthu said the matter was being investigated. 

 We have received the FIR and sent the woman for a medical examination, said Karbi Anglong additional superintendent of police (headquarters) Nityananda Goswami.

 The regiment was recently deployed in the troubled district after the series of attack on Hindi-speaking people by the anti-talks faction of the Karbi militant outfit and Ulfa.

 Jan. 12: Five weeks after welcoming Sourav Ganguly back with a handshake, in Potchefstroom (ahead of the Test series in South Africa), Greg Chappell proposed that the former Team India captain be recalled as an opener in the ODIs.

 Senior national selectors Dilip Vengsarkar, Venkatapathi Raju, Bhupinder Singh, Sanjay Jagdale and Ranjib Biswal were thinking on the same lines as the coach and, so, Sourav has returned after 16 months. 

 His Test exile ended last month.

 The unhappy Zimbabwe chapter in their relationship wont be forgotten, but Chappell has been doing much to establish he actually didnt have anything personal against Sourav.

 As reported in the lead-up to todays selection meeting in Rajkot, Souravs comeback will be versus the West Indies in Nagpur (January 21).

 For now, the selectors have picked 15 only for the first two ODIs. The second is in Cuttack, on January 24. The ones in Chennai and Vadodara are later. 

 Incidentally, Souravs ODI debut had also been against the West Indies in Brisbane, 15 years ago. He didnt get another match for the next four-and-a-half years, though. That wont be repeated.

 Speaking at the Eden on a day he completed another Ranji century (122 off 118 balls at Rajasthans expense), Sourav said: I expected this call I knew the opportunity would come my way one day.

 One-day cricket is seen as a young cricketers game, yet somebody who turns 35 in July has made a return. Its one comeback which is going to be recounted many times over.

 Not just in and around Behala.

 According to sources, Chappell took the line that a left-right combination would serve India well. The right-hander of his (and the nations) choice is Sachin Tendulkar.

 As a pair, Sachin and Sourav have as many as 16 century partnerships. 

 If Souravs has been a remarkable return, no less significant is Sachins appointment as vice-captain for Indias first two ODIs of the year.

 The former captains brief is to guide Rahul Dravid.

 One understands he will be retained as Dravids deputy till the end of the World Cup. What happens thereafter is going to be interesting. 

 Besides selecting 15 for Nagpur and Cuttack, Vengsarkar and Co. chose the 30 World Cup probables.

 Virender Sehwag and Irfan Pathan, two big omissions from the 15, are there. While Sehwag should be recalled sooner rather than later, its tough going for Pathan. 

 What can work in his favour is that Baroda have made the Ranji semi-finals. Therefore, theres at least one more opportunity to make an impact with the ball.

 If Pathan doesnt, then comeback man Joginder Sharma may board the flight to the West Indies. When the season began, it was assumed a seat had been reserved for Pathan.

 While the squad for the first two ODIs has six making a comeback Sourav, Gautam Gambhir, Ramesh Powar, Joginder, Rudra Pratap Singh and Robin Uthappa there are three absolute newcomers among the World Cup probables.

 Delhi medium-pacer Ishant Sharma, Saurashtra batsman Cheteshwar Pujara and Barodas left-arm spinner Rajesh Pawar are the only ones who didnt figure in the probables list for the last Champions Trophy.

 Harbhajan Singh was to have been dropped for a few matches, but survived as Anil Kumble was rested.

 Tinsukia terror rerun claims 2

 OUR BUREAU 

 Jan. 20: Terror revisited Tinsukia as Ulfa triggered a powerful explosion in the heart of the town around 6.20 this evening, leaving two persons dead and 10 injured. The condition of one of them is stated to be serious. 

 A mangled motorcycle at the blast site indicated that the bomb was planted on the two-wheeler parked on Chamber Road, one of the busiest business hubs in the Upper Assam town. While one victim has been identified as Roshan Tiwari, the other, Dasharath Jha, passed away at AMCH, Dibrugarh.

 Rafiqul Islam, 26, who sustained splinter injuries on his head during yesterdays grenade blast at Adabari, died at GNRC Hospital today. 

 Former Jharkhand chief minister Arjun Munda had a close shave in Tinsukia as the bomb exploded minutes after his cavalcade passed through the spot. 

 Munda today visited Dibrugarh, Dumduma, Lanswal, Duliajan and Tinsukia, where a large number of people from Jharkhand were killed during the recent spate of violence. 

 The army was only guarding the important places. The residents of remote villages were left to fend for themselves, Munda said over telephone.

 Police launched a combing operation to flush out militants around 1.30 am atop a hillock at Nepali Basti near Gorchuk and gunned down a suspected Ulfa rebel. Additional SP (city) Rajen Singh said two Austrian grenades, a bundle of fuse wires and some incriminating documents were seized. 

 Police also picked up Motlib Khan, a suspected ISI operative, from the Hatigaon area of the city. Sources said Khan was coordinating with Ulfa to carry out recent strikes in the city. 

 In another incident, suspected Karbi militants hurled a grenade at a police point near Diphu Stadium around 7.10 pm. However, no one was injured.

 The Opposition AGP expressed concern over the law and order situation in the state and reiterated its demand for Presidents rule. AGP president Brindaban Goswami said conflict between the government and Ulfa had vitiated the atmosphere in the state.

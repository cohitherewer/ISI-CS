 Now, rape case looms on Subba

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Guwahati, June 7: Fresh trouble is brewing for controversial Tezpur MP Mani Kumar Subba. Till now, the lottery baron has been accused of murder, cheating and citizenship fraud. Now, a rape case has come back to haunt him. 

 The Gauhati High Court has directed the Sonitpur superintendent of police to submit a detailed report by Monday providing the present status of case number 150/2006 at Gohpur police station, wherein one Phuleswari Gogoi has accused the sitting MP of the ruling Congress of raping her daughter. 

 Acting on a writ petition filed by the victims mother, Justice Amitava Roy issued the directive on Monday. The copy of the order was made available today. The petition alleged that political pressure was being applied to stall the probe. 

 The case was registered under Section 366 of the IPC. Neither Subba, the family of the alleged victim nor the lawyers of the petitioners were available for comment. 

 A senior member of the Assam PCC said the party had no comments to offer as the case was sub judice.

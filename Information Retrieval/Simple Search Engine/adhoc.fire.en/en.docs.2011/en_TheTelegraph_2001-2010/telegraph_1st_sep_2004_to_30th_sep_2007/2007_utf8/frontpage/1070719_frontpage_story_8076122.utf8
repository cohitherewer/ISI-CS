 Kidnap whiff in missing trader

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jamshedpur, July 18: Vishwanath Garg (45), a city-based businessman, was allegedly abducted when he was returning home from his steel plant unit at Chandil last night.

 According to sources in the Garg family, Vishwanath left his office, Galaxy Exports Private Limited at Bhuiyandih in Chandil, at 8pm. The family owns seven industrial units in the state.

 Before leaving office, he called home and said he would reach by 9.30pm. When he did not reach home by 10pm, we started calling him but both his cellphones were out of reach, said a family friend. After 10-15 minutes, when his cellphones were found switched off, two of the family members, along with some close friends, rushed for Chandil. 

 Most of the time he stays in Delhi because of our wholesale business there and hardly interacts with people here. So, initially we thought he must have met with an accident.

 When they reached there, they came to know that he left for Jamshedpur by taking Chowka-Kandra road because a factory staff, Chittranjan Sharma, had informed him that the NH-33 was blocked following an accident at Kandarbera. But, on their way back along the same route they found no trace of Vishwanath.

 When he did not return by 11.30pm, we called the Seraikela-Kharsawan superintendent of police Laxman Prasad Singh, expressing our fearing of abduction. A case of abduction of Vishwanth and his driver Deepak Kumar (40) was immediately registered with the Chandil police, he said. Vishwanaths car, a chocolate-colour Chevrolet Tavera (JH 05 R 2277), is also missing. 

 The information was also passed on to Singhs counterpart in East Singhbhum Pankaj Kumar Darad as the victim lives at Sonari.

 Singh said: The family has not received any ransom call. We have detained one of the employees.

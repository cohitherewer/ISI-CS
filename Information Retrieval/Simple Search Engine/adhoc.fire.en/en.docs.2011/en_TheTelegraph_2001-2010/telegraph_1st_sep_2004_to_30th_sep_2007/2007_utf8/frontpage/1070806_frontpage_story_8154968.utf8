 Terror is back on wheels 

 - 30 wounded in explosions in sivasagar and goalpara 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Dibrugarh, 

 Aug. 5: Three explosions with the stamp of Ulfas 

 modus operandi signalled the beginning of the outfits 

 ritualistic pre-Independence Day terror run and left 30 

 people wounded in Sivasagar and Goalpara districts today.

 The first explosion occurred almost in front of the police station in Sonari town of Sivasagar district around 8.10am, when the Sunday market was just coming to life. Vendors who were readying their roadside stalls bore the brunt of the explosion. A couple of shoppers were wounded, too.

 Police said the bomb was kept in a hand-pulled cart.

 Exactly 15 minutes later, a second explosion occurred in the vicinity of the Assam State Transport Corporations bus terminus in Sivasagar town, 40-odd km from Sonari. The bomb was an improvised explosive device and strapped to a bicycle parked in front of a roadside eatery. 

 Four persons were wounded in that incident.

 In the evening, another bomb kept on a bicycle exploded at Agia Bazar in Goalpara district, wounding 16 people. The police said the bomb went off around 6.30pm. 

 Ulfa has been routinely using bicycles, rickshaws, autorickshaws and handcarts to plant bombs in public places. In Sonari, the police said two militants masquerading as shoppers hired a cart-puller to ferry several packets of groceries, one of which contained the bomb, this morning.

 Do ladka Sonari daily bazaar se 10 kilo alu, 5 kilo maida aur ek carton anda mera thela me utha ke bole Sonari thana ke paas rokne ko. Main ruka hua tha thana ke paas tabhi ek bada dhamaka sa hua. Main thoda dur me tha is liye bach gaya (two youths loaded 10 kg of potato, 5 kg of maida and one carton of eggs on my cart and asked me to park it in front of Sonari police station. They said they would follow me. I was waiting for them when the bomb went off. I escaped because I was at a safe distance, the cart-puller, Md Kalam Mia, told the media.

 The wounded persons are Sanjoy Gupta, Bijoy Gupta, Durga Gupta, Pawan Borthakur, Gobin Patnahock, Rakesh Singh, N. Shah, Krishna Pandit, Debnath Pandey and Sudip Dey. 

 Doctors at the Sonari community health centre referred two of them to Assam Medical College and Hospital in Dibrugarh. Bijoy Guptas condition was stated to be critical. The rest are stable but we are not taking chances and will be monitoring their condition over the next 24 hours, Dr P.D.Gogoi of the community health centre said over phone. 

 The persons wounded in the Sivasagar explosion are Shaktipada Saha, Harindra Koshowara, Nirmali Baruah and Amir Hussain. All four were admitted to Sivasagar Civil Hospital. 

 The police had received a wireless message from an intelligence agency yesterday evening about an Ulfa plot to trigger four blasts in Sivasagar district, including an attack on Sonari police station, before Independence Day. 

 A senior police official in Sonari described the explosions as acts of retaliation to the anti-Ulfa offensive across the district. 

 The army recently busted an Ulfa hideout at Singlopathar in the Abhaypur reserve forest, the police arrested two of its members at Konwargaon and an IED planted near a bridge on the Sonari-Bhojo road was detected and defused in the nick of time, the official added.

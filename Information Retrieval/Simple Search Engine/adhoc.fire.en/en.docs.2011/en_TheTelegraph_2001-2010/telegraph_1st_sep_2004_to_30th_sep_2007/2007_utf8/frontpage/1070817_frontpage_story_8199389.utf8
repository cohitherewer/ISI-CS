 Judges daughter disappears from running train 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Aug. 16: The daughter of a fast track court judge went missing from a moving train between Katihar and Mokama on Tuesday night. 

 Rani Archana Singh, a law graduate and the daughter of Banka additional district and sessions judge Subhash Chandra Prasad, was returning Patna from New Jalpaiguri by Capital Express with her husband, Rajiv Singh. 

 The judge suspects it to be a case of kidnapping, given the states crime records.

 Archanas husband Rajiv, who registered a case with GRP at Mokama, said: We boarded the train at New Jalpaiguri on August 14 and reached Katihar around 8.30pm. We went to sleep around 8.40pm. When I woke up at 5.10am on August 15, the train was near Bakhtiyarpur. I found her missing. Her slippers and purse were there. 

 Rajiv, a railway engineer working in Jodhpur, was travelling with his new bride in a sleeper compartment. Rajiv stresses that there was no question of his wife getting down at any other station because they were returning home (Patna). 

 Rajivs family stays at Laljitola near Patna railway station. 

 We married on April 29. I had taken time out from my training for our first vacation to Darjeeling on August 10, said Rajiv, ruling out possibility of illicit affairs. 

 Mokama GRP in-charge Kundan Kumar Singh said: We have alerted all stations between Katihar and Mokama and have been searching for her in all in-between platforms and hospitals. 

 Patna railway SP Ajitabh Kumar said: A police team has been talking to their co-passengers for clues. The police are working on all possible angles, including kidnapping. 

 Meanwhile, Archanas relatives have ruled out any foul play by Rajiv. The victims brother, Ravishankar Prasad, said: Archana is an educated and bold girl. She can take care of herself.

 Archanas father and Banka district judge Prasad said: I suspect it to be a case of kidnapping and dont doubt my son-in-law. 

 Rajiv, too, believes Archana has been kidnapped. My father-in-law deals with criminal cases. Anyone who nurses ill-feelings for their family can be involved in the case, he added.

 Last rites without body after morgue demands bribe 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, May 27: The state could not protect Mani Maddis life. Neither could it give her the dignity the dead deserve.

 Two teenagers have performed the last rites of their murdered mother without her body because they could not rustle up the Rs 200 allegedly demanded as bribe by employees of a state-run morgue.

 After being told by the morgue hands at the district hospital in Malda that money has to be paid for the body to be released, the sons, Bablu and Gopal Tudu, declared that they would not return to claim their mothers remains.

 We could not pay the Rs 200 the morgue employees were demanding. After our repeated requests fell on deaf ears, we decided to return home on May 23, Gopal said today. 

 It is true that we could not cremate the body, but we have performed her last rites according to our adivasi customs, he added.

 Police directed Bablu and Gopal to the hospital on May 21 after they reported that their mother was missing. The police had found the body of an unidentified woman on May 19 in Palashbona village, 350 km from Calcutta. 

 The boys, whose father is no more, hail from Deotola village, four km from Palashbona.

 We told the boys to go to the district hospital morgue and see the body of a woman in her forties. They later identified her as Mani Maddi, their mother, the officer-in-charge, Gajole police station, Hemanth Singh, said.

 Bablu and Gopal went to the morgue again on May 23 but the employees allegedly insisted on the bribe, following which the teenagers decided to perform the last rites. 

 The boys have identified two to three employees who demanded the money. The chief medical officer of health, Radharaman Banik, has ordered an inquiry.

 Banik conceded that the morgue staff often demanded money. They have not done the right thing by demanding money. That is an act that can be rightly termed inhuman, the medical officer said. I will not allow this to continue.

 Maddis body is still lying in the morgue. Under normal circumstances, the hospital will wait for sometime and then dispose of the body.

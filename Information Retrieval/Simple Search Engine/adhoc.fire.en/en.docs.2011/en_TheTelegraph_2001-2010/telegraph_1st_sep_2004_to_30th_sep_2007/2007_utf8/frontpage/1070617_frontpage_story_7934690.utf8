 Flare-up blame on outsiders

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Nandigram, 

 June 16: Police have blamed yesterdays Nandigram 

 violence on outsiders, claiming off the record 

 that Maoists had led the attack on CPM refugee camps and 

 the force.

 The CPMs retaliation bid, too, was spearheaded by armed cadre brought in from outside, officers said.

 The attack was led by outsiders who had incited villagers. These people, who are bringing in arms, are bent on disrupting the peace process, the inspector-general of police (south Bengal), Arun Gupta, said.

 Thats why, when things were generally looking up and there was no reason for trouble, these outsiders struck. We have their names and will reveal them soon.

 Police sources said these outsiders were Maoists. They are inciting the villagers, who dont want any more violence, a senior officer said.

 He added that Maoists from Calcutta had entrenched themselves in Nandigram, infiltrating the land movement and trying to build a base there.

 The sources said certain lobbies in the CPM, too, wanted the refugee stalemate to continue despite the governments appeals for their safe return. This could be a reason why cadres were brought from outside.

 This section feels the party can gain if, during next years panchayat polls, it can holler that thousands of its supporters are still homeless because of Trinamul Congress attacks, the officer said. But if all the refugees return and there is peace, Trinamul can claim credit and earn goodwill.

 Even todays violence was led by outsiders, Gupta said.

 He was referring to fresh clashes this morning around Tekhali bridge, about 12 km from Bhangabera where a CPM refugee camp was burnt down yesterday and a police camp ransacked.

 CPM supporters hurled bombs and stones across the bridge at the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committees areas, bringing quick retaliation. After about 45 minutes, the police managed to chase both groups away by firing in the air. No one was injured.

 Local CPM leader Ashok Guria and the Pratirodh Committees Sheikh Sufian agreed that there were outsiders but blamed each other for bringing them in first.

 The outsider angle isnt new. Late last year, the government had blamed the Singur land battles on the Maoists. Even in Nandigram, the police have picked up a few alleged Maoists now and then.

 Immediately after the March 14 police firing when 14 protesters were killed, Nandigram villagers had alleged that CPM cadres from outside had joined in the attack. On March 17, 10 armed cadres were arrested from the CPM stronghold of Khejuri and admitted they had been sent to regain lost territory in Nandigram.

 We know there are outsiders, district police chief A.G. Srinivas said, but since we cant enter Nandigram we can hardly do anything about them.

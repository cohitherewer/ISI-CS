 Congress colleague denounces Dubey

 SHASHANK SHEKHAR

 Mabel Rebello

 Bokaro, July 15: In an apparently face-saving tactic for the Congress party, its senior MP from Jharkhand Mabel Rebello today termed the statement made by Dhanbad MP Chandrashekhar Dubey yesterday, about tribal chief ministers, as totally individual and uncalled for.

 Talking to The Telegraph on phone, Rebello said: I am surprised. Issuing a statement that a tribal is not fit to rule the state is wrong and uncalled for. The party might even consider disciplinary action against him. She clarified that the Congress has always worked for the prosperity and upliftment of tribals.

 Going against the party line, which could turn embarrassing for the Congress in coming days, Chandrashekhar Dubey yesterday went public saying a tribal chief minister could not do any good to the state and which, according to him, was the main obstacle for the development of Jharkhand.

 None of the tribal chief ministers, including Babulal Marandi, Arjun Munda and Madhu Koda, did anything good for the people of Jharkhand apart from working for their own vested interest, Dubey said at the news briefing. He purposely missed out JMM chief Shibu Sorens name, whom he did not want to target at this junction, fearing party repercussions.

 A CBI inquiry must be conducted against all the three CMs who have amassed huge property, both movable and immovable, and the state should be put under the Presidents rule immediately, followed by Assembly elections, the MP, who is highly antagonised over the style of functioning of the present UPA government led by Madhu Koda, said.

 Rebello also refuted the allegations of Dubey against Bokaro deputy commissioner Sunil Kumar.

 Wielding a bunch of papers in his hand, Dubey had declared at the news conference that he had documentary proof against the DC, who, he alleged, was involved in corrupt practices siphoning off Rs 200 crore as DC of Simdega and Rs 80 crore in Bokaro. 

 He, however, denied the media a look into the documents when asked for, saying he would only hand it over to the CBI. Rebello said she had personally assessed development work in Simdega and finds the allegations false and baseless.

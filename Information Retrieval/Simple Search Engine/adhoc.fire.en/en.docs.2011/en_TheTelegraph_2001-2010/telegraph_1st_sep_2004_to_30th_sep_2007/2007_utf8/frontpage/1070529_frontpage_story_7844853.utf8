 Staff unhappy over Net culture for job growth

 NALIN VERMA

 Patna, May 28: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar is an engineer and his deputy, Sushil Kumar Modi, is Net savvy.

 True to the image of the leaders at its helm, the Bihar government has proposed to give promotion only to computer literate employees.

 We are considering the proposal to promote only computer literate personnel. To get a service in developed state such as Gujarat, even a sweeper or a guard needs to be computer literate, Modi said.

 However, the minister clarified: The move is in its initial stage. But the government is seriously considering to take a final decision soon.

 In fact, to introduce Net culture in the state, the government has also decided to connect all the police stations using computers. The process has begun with the computerisation of five of the 39 police stations in Patna, said deputy inspector-general of crime record bureau Arbind Pandey. Other police stations will be connected soon.

 The officers and employees, however, are extremely unhappy over the governments move. We dont know what to do with the screen and keypad lying on our table. We are not trained to handle a computer, said a constable at a Patna police station.

 Computer literacy was not a precondition for promotion at the time of our appointment, said a sub-inspector in his late 40s, expecting his promotion to an inspector.

 Even a section of senior IAS and IPS officers many of whom are not Net savvy are resenting the idea to introduce Net culture in a sudden manner.

 Arbind Pandey said the government has initiated a programme to train the officials. However, the officials denied knowledge about any such programmes.

 Sushil Kumar Modi justified the governments decision on the ground that most of the private sector banks, companies and establishments are computerised. 

 However, state RJD chief Abdul Bari Sidiqui describes the proposal as utopian at this stage. We should train the people before implementing the proposal. Otherwise, our investment will go in vain.

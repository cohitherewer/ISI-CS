 Anguished 

 PM to Left: If you want to withdraw, so be it

 MANINI CHATTERJEE

 TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE

 I told them 

 (Karat - picture below and Bardhan) to do whatever they want to do, 

 if they want to withdraw support, so be it...

 Manmohan Singh 

New 

 Delhi, Aug. 10: Tired of the Left parties 

 constant bark, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh dared them 

 to bite after their latest diatribe against the Indo-US 

 nuclear deal on Tuesday. 

 In an exclusive interview to The 

 Telegraph, the Prime Minister said: I told them 

 that it is not possible to renegotiate the deal. It is an 

 honourable deal, the cabinet has approved it, we cannot 

 go back on it. I told them to do whatever they want to do, 

 if they want to withdraw support, so be it.

 He was referring to his conversation 

 with the CPMs Prakash Karat and the CPIs A.B. 

 Bardhan on Tuesday night, hours after the Left released 

 a statement on the nuclear deal.

 In a frank conversation, the Prime 

 Minister said he was not angry but anguished 

 at the harsh tone and tenor of the Lefts reaction 

 and made it clear that the UPA-Left relationship could not 

 be a one-sided affair.

 Replying to a question, he said: 

 I dont get angry, I dont want to use harsh 

 words. They are our colleagues and we have to work with 

 them. But they also have to learn to work with us.

 Although he did not raise his 

 voice, those last 10 words had a hint of steel which underlined 

 the Prime Ministers new resolve to take on the Left. 

 There was no immediate response from the Left leaders, Singh 

 said, adding: They havent thought it through. 

 They (the Left) are our colleagues and we have to work with them.But they also have to learn to work with us

 Manmohan Singh 

 In the course of the interview, 

 the Prime Minister made it clear that the Left had a flawed 

 understanding not just of the 123 Agreement but also of 

 Indias intrinsic strength and its enhanced status 

 in the world.

 On the nuclear deal itself, he 

 said: It is an honourable deal which enlarges Indias 

 development options, particularly in regard to energy security 

 and environmental protection, and it doesnt in any 

 way affect our ability to pursue our nuclear weapons programme. 

 We have not surrendered an iota of our freedom in this regard; 

 not an iota of our sovereignty.

 In this context, he referred to 

 the interview in The Hindu newspaper today with R. 

 Chidambaram, the former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission 

 and currently the governments principal scientific 

 adviser. I cannot improve on what he (Chidambaram) 

 has said. He has said that all three conditions (there will 

 be no effect on the strategic programme, there will be no 

 deceleration in our three-stage nuclear power programme, 

 and there will be no effect on our advanced R amp;D programme) 

 have been met.

 Asked why then was the Left objecting 

 to the deal, the Prime Minister said: I dont 

 know (but) they seem to have a problem with the United 

 States. Elaborating on his own stand, Singh added: 

 I want Indias relations to improve with all 

 powers and we have been doing that with the US, with Russia, 

 with the EU, with France, and particularly with China. We 

 have had a breakthrough with China, a historic agreement 

 where we have defined the principles that will outline the 

 border agreement. 

 On the Lefts fears that 

 the 123 Agreement would draw India further into a strategic 

 alliance with the US, rendering it an American satellite, 

 Singh said: How can we ever become anyones satellite? 

 Yes, we live in an increasingly interdependent world but 

 the challenge before us is to forge new linkages, widen 

 our strategic options and, at the same time, guard against 

 the negative side of the process of globalisation.

 Although he did not directly attack 

 the Lefts stand on the US as outdated or alarmist, 

 he made his meaning clear by referring to the way communist 

 countries were dealing with the superpower.

 China, he pointed out, had a huge 

 trade surplus with the US but was not worried about losing 

 its independence. Look at Vietnam, look at China (the 

 way they are engaging with America) out of fear of dealing 

 with the US, we cannot become a frog in the well, 

 Singh said.

 If the Prime Minister was anguished 

 at the Lefts obvious lack of trust in him to do right 

 by the country, he appeared equally dismayed at their low 

 levels of confidence in the nation. India, with a 

 billion people and with such a diversity of languages and 

 cultures and religions, with its functioning democracy and 

 respect for rule of law is a unique country; we are a role 

 model for the world. 

 By railing against the nuclear 

 deal, the Left was underestimating the intrinsic strength 

 of India, of Indias capacity to defend its national 

 interests, he felt.

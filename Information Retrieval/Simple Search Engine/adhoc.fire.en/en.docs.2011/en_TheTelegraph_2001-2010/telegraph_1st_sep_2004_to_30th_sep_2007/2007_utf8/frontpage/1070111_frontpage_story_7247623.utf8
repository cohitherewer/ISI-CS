 Big-league plans in Jindal bag

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Jan. 10: The package deal that the Jindals will bring to Bengal is expected to require a cumulative investment of up to Rs 35,000 crore. 

 Sajjan Jindal, JSW Steels managing director, will sign a deal with the Bengal government tomorrow, providing a morale-booster at a time the administration is licking the wounds of Nandigram.

 The investment will cover a steel plant, a dedicated port, a coal mine and a power project. The initiative will be spread over 10 years.

 If the final investment figures tally with the projection, the Jindal project will elevate Bengal to the big league of other eastern steel states like Orissa and Jharkhand.

 The first phase of the steel project will need an investment of Rs 15,000 crore. It will bankroll a 3-million-tonne plant with a 600-MW captive power unit, an independent 1,000-MW plant, development of coal mines and a berth at Haldia port to facilitate exports.

 The next two phases will require investments of Rs 10,000 crore each to ramp up steel output to 10 million tonnes.

 The government has to arrange 4,000-5,000 acres for the steel plant, for which it has identified a stretch at Salboni near Kharagpur. The plant is expected to create 10,000 direct and indirect job opportunities.

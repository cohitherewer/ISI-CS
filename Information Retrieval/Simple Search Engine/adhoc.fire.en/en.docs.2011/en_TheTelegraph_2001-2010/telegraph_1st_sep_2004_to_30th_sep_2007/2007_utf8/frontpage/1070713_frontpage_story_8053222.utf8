 Where innocence is bought and sold

 - The author gains entry into a Delhi brothel 

 Its 

 My Life- Momoni Raisom 

 Goswami 

 The writer continues her narrative 

 of a visit to a red light area in Delhi and her research 

 into the lives of young sex workers

 At the brothel, I watched a young 

 girl a minor with her child. The little mother had finished 

 feeding her baby. The other girls now took turns to play 

 with the infant. 

 By now, another customer had arrived. 

 He was very young and he looked as if he was a student. 

 He had probably come straight from the railway station. 

 He was slim, had long hair, and his shirt and trousers were 

 drenched in sweat. I couldnt look him in the eye. 

 What I had feared happened. He 

 came and stood next to the girl-mother. She took back her 

 child, opened her blouse and gave it another feed. She then 

 handed the baby to one of the girls and went in with the 

 boy. 

 Santokh Singh, my autorickshaw 

 driver, was yelling from below, Madam, come down. 

 Its getting late. 

 I asked a heavily made-up girl 

 sitting beside me, Wouldnt you like to do something 

 else? 

 What should I do?

 Teach in a school or something. 

 Teach in a school? 

 The very idea seemed revolting to all of them. She remarked, 

 I cant even buy a pair of shoes with the salary 

 of a teacher. 

 An obnoxious smell emanated from 

 the toilet in front of us. I took out my handkerchief. Santokh 

 Singh yelled again, There is no one here to tell you 

 the truth. Come on. Lets go. 

 A few harsh lines from Ghalib 

 rang in my ears: 

 When my life was filled 

 with infinite sorrow/ when none of my hopes was fulfilled/ 

 how could I remember that I, too, had a god?/...If I find 

 the door to Kaaba closed/ Id rather go back than wait 

 on my knees. 

 Again, these lines of a Persian 

 poet seemed to hang in the air: 

 Those who sacrifice to 

 the sword of divine love/ For them new life comes from unseen 

 lands.

 Did those sex workers feel the 

 touch of divine love?

 Suddenly, a girl from inside a 

 cubicle tumbled out and landed at my feet. Someone from 

 inside the same cubicle ran out surreptitiously from the 

 back of the room. 

 There was blood dripping from 

 the girls white salwar! I screamed. 

 Everyone on the bench turned towards 

 her. The woman at the water pump shrieked with concern. 

 Oh, that old goat from Bundelkhand must have come, 

 or it may be one of those African students... Go, change 

 your clothes... They are all animals! 

 The girl went in. 

 I asked the girl sitting next 

 to me, Will you show me your cubicles? 

 She looked at the older woman 

 washing clothes. The woman nodded. 

 I followed her and stood in front 

 of a cubicle. She lifted its curtain. A wooden bed occupied 

 the entire space. There was a floral printed sheet spread 

 on it. Of the five cubicles, two had their curtains drawn. 

 The young student-like boy was in one of them with the girl-mother 

 and the Pathan was in the other one with another woman. 

 What should be my next question? 

 Santokh Singh hollered again, 

 Come down now, madam. 

 Can I come here again? 

 I asked the girl who had shown me the cubicles. 

 She looked at the other girls 

 who, in turn, looked at the woman sitting by the water pump. 

 She was still washing clothes. She nodded her assent.

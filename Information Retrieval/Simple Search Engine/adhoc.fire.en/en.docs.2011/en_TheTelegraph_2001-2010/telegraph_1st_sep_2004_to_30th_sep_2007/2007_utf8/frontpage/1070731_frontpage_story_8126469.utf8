 Leaders seek bigger House for stability

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ranchi, July 30: The political leaders with varying hues have apparently reached to a consensus on the vexed Assembly seat rejig issue. Nothing less than 150 can bring political stability to the state, they believe. 

 Former Speaker Inder Singh Namdhari today asked the Madhu Koda government to stick to the Assembly resolution, adopted in 2005, to increase the House strength to 150 or more.

 Namdhari said the state government should not agree to a House less than 150 members, as it would not ensure political stability in Jharkhand.

 The resolution adopted in the House in 2005 was sent to the Union home ministry with the consent of all the House members, he said. 

 Former chief minister Babulal Marandi said the House strength should be 150, given the states population. Besides, a House with 140 or more members would entitle Jharkhand to create a legislative council, where public figures could be accommodated, he added. 

 Congress Rajya Sabha member Mabel Rebello said it was great injustice that Jharkhand has only 81 seats for around 2.70 crore people while states like Nagaland and Meghalaya, with just 10 lakh population, have 60 seats. 

 Constitutional experts, too, said an Assembly with less than 100 members is one of the main reasons behind political instability in several states. 

 Delimitation Commission chairman Justice Kuldip Singh, who had to defer his Jharkhand visit in view of public unrest, has urged the Prime Minister to increase the number of constituencies to 120 instead of preventing the delimitation exercise. The Prime Minister, who responded positively, asked the Union law secretary to examine the demands raised by the Jharkhand governor and the chief minister. The law secretary is slated to submit his report by August 20. 

 Meanwhile, the Delimitation Commission said it was likely to pass the final orders and issue notifications for redrawing the boundary lines of Jharkhand Assembly and parliamentary seats before August 31.

 Xavier Institute of Management: Enlightening ways

 Bhubaneswar, Aug. 3: 

 As the last class ended, Chenna Bhasavas (24) eyes 

 brimmed with tears.

 Just two more days remaining of yoga at six, lectures at nine and then free time with classmates. Two more days to stay in the lush campus of Xavier Institute of Management here and of not letting the fact of being an HIV positive person bother him.

 He and his 24 colleagues are the fourth and final batch undergoing a certificate programme in leadership and managerial proficiency (LAMP) at Orissas premier B-school. We have our main term exams tomorrow and then its over. Well be packing our bags, Chenna said. 

 LAMP takes the credit of being the country and the worlds first-ever programme for HIV positive persons at a B-school. XIMB, in association with UNDP, had launched the programme as an experiment aiming to build personal capacity, sharpen professional knowledge and skills of HIV positive people who work with different non-government organisations. 

 As the last batch prepares to leave, the faculty, too, is left nostalgic. They were different. Mostly, the interest is in grabbing a good job and a fat salary, but with our special students the priorities were different, said S. Peppin, faculty and LAMP coordinator.

 It was all about demystifying management. As they came from different backgrounds with different level of education, some were slow learners. Thus, it was a challenge to make the subject as simple as possible. Unlike others, a job was not the primary requirement. We had to put in our best efforts and make their moments worthy and meaningful, he said.

 The 24-odd people in the final batch and the others before this were all from different NGOs specialising in the field of HIV education and awareness. 

 In the B-school, classes stretched between 9am and 7.30pm and were accompanied by assignments and homework. It was hard work, but we understand that we had to complete a two-years course in six weeks. We dont have so much time, said K. Satyanarayan (55), the oldest student. 

 The management did its job well ensuring that all the students attended the classes unless there was a genuine reason to skip it. 

 Of course some students were absentminded and inattentive but that was also an affect of the medicines they took. Some of them were very sharp, said Snigdha Pattnaik, a faculty member. 

 The syllabus for the course included project management, crisis management, human resource development, team building, leadership, gender issues, communications besides financial costing and sustainable livelihood models. 

 Two things I learnt from XIMB planning and discipline. I would certainly continue the disciplined life I have led here and teach my friends, too. Also, now I know how good planning helps one to manage a job. So, I would certainly plan things and avoid haphazard attempts, said P. Gayatrai, a student. 

 XIMB plans to host a grand graduation ceremony for all the 100 LAMP students, in all its four batches, on Monday.

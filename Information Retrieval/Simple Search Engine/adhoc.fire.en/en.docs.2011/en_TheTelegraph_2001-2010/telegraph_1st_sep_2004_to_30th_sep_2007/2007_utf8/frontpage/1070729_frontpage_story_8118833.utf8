 One of the bullets pierced his head and came out through the other side, said Keonjhar superintendent of police Ghanshyam Upadhyaya. 

 The police officer was not sure how many criminals were involved in the shootout. 

 Maybe there were five criminals. We had to retaliate in a restrained a manner as it was a crowded place, said the superintendent of police.

 The injured police personnel, Kerketta, was rushed to Tisco Hospital in Joda, where he died. Today his body was shifted to Barbil for post-mortem.

 One of the criminals has also been admitted to the hospital, said the police. He was injured in the shootout and was caught. 

 The police claimed to have seized a pistol and two live magazines from him. His accomplices fled into the nearby jungles and are believed to have crossed the border.

 We have sealed the border and combing operation is on to nab the others, said the SP.

 India plays ballot cop

 Siliguri, May 28: A wannabe democracy staged the final dress rehearsal today, with the largest democracy beating back thousands bent on voting uninvited.

 Bhutan today held the last round of mock polls before its democracy debut sometime next year but the quaint exercise took on a menacing edge as 4,000 refugees sought to force their way in from Nepal through Indian territory and vote.

 The refugees are Nepalese of Bhutan origin (Lhotsampas) forced to flee their home around two decades ago because the rulers felt they were not doing enough to assimilate with the rest of the population.

 Living in camps in eastern Nepal, the refugees have grown to 1.6 lakh. They have been demanding repatriation to their homeland, which can only be reached through the Indian corridor.

 The mock election, which boiled down to a fight between the Druk Yellow Party and the Druk Red Party, acted as a lightning rod for a fresh attempt at crossover today.

 The Yellow Party stands for the preservation of tradition and values while the Red Party advocates industrial development. The Yellow Party won by a huge margin.

 The refugees were trying to enter India through a bridge on the river Mechi, 45 km from Siliguri, along the India-Nepal border when they were stopped. 

 Personnel from Indias Sashastra Seema Bal and district police aborted the attempt. The forces were deployed in strength along the border from Sunday night.

 We stopped the Bhutanese refugees from entering our mainland, Rajesh Subarno, Darjeeling superintendent of police, said. 

 Clashes broke out between another group of refugees and police in a Nepal camp around 80 km from the Mechi, killing at least one person.

 The standoff on the Indian border remained peaceful till dusk but the situation worsened later. The crowd started throwing stones at the jawans and the policemen guarding the bridge.

 The security forces then chased the protesters who had surged forward. Several people have been arrested. We feel they might try again to enter India at night, an SSB official said.

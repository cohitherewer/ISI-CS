 Lalu tough talk

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Sept. 29: While playing down questions on a possible mid-term poll for the Lok Sabha, railway minister Lalu Prasad today dared the NDA government in Bihar by announcing a chetavani (warning) rally here on October 28.

 Laughing at chief minister Nitish Kumars predictions on RJD scoring a zero in the event of a mid-term poll, Lalu said: Nitish has become arrogant. Time alone will decide if he or I get a zero.

 The RJD chief, who addressed national and state-level RJD functionaries here today, asked in-charges of the rally to get ready for a powerful but peaceful rally to nail the Nitish government lies.

 While breaking away from RJDs tradition of carrying lathis during rallies, the party chief said that hitting the state government for its failure on all fronts would be the rallying point. So a lathi rally, maha rally or raila, the Lalu coined masculine version of a rally, ceases to be the USP of the rustic charmer, who now prefers to speak the language of a management guru.

 Lalu behaved as much as a railway minister when he asked party workers to get tickets for the rally. I have asked in-charges of the rally to get tickets booked for workers. We may end up reserving several compartments to ferry party workers from the state capital and back.

 Law and order, Lalu said, had gone for a toss. One would have now realised what a real jungle raj was all about.

 Bihar, a box-office hit

 NALIN VERMA AND PTI

 Patna, June 19: A 20-member Bhojpuri drama troupe that performed in Sydney to regale the Hindustani-speaking audience of Australia yesterday has come as music to the ears of Bihar people.

 Our efforts to encourage Bhojpuri artists and promote Bhojpuri films have been paying dividends now, making the states folk culture popular even in Australia and other foreign countries, said deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi, who was on a 10-day trip to Australia last month.

 A Bihar troupe led by Dineshlal Yadav Nirhua, is on a 20-day tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Singapore and other countries.

 Reports reaching here said the three-hour ticketed performance on a Sydney stage, which included dance, music and songs, was a big hit with the audience enjoying the show to the hilt.

 The venture will go a long way in promoting Bhojpuri language and culture abroad, said Modi.

 The troupe has planned 11 shows in five countries, the troupes spokesperson, Ashok Bhatia said from Mumbai.

 We have got the tickets for all the shows sold out. The troupe is registering good commercial gains, besides promoting Bhojpuri culture. 

 On his trip to Australia and Singapore in May, Modi appointed Umashankar Kesri, Sanjay Pandey and S. Rai as the Bihar Foundation coordinators at Melbourne, Canberra and Singapore.

 The Nitish Kumar government had created the Foundation to galvanise people of Bihar living in different parts of the globe to promote the states culture.

 Nirhua has starred in Chalat Musafir Moh Liye and Ho Gayela Pyaar Odhaniya Waili Se among six others movies.

 It is a matter of great pride that following our success in India we are able to take the process forward internationally, Nirhua said before leaving for Sydney.

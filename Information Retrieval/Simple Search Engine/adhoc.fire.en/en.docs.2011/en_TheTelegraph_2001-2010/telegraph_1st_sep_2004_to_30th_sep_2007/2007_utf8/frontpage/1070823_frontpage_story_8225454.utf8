 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Aug. 22: Chambal Infrastructure Ventures Limited of the KK Birla group today expressed interest in setting up a 2,000MW thermal power plant at an estimated cost of Rs 9,000 crore.

 H.S. Bawa, the managing director of Zuari Industries and senior vice-president of Chambal Fertiliser and Chemicals Limited, made a presentation before chief minister Naveen Patnaik this evening regarding the matter. Bawa expressed the multinationals interest in the project.

 In fact, the firm has already applied for 2,000 acre near Siaria in Dhenkanal. 

 Orissa energy minister Surya Patro said the company has expressed interest in signing an MoU with the government as early as possible. 

 It had also offered to set up a thermal power plant in a joint venture with PSUs.

 The proposals appraisal would be made by the state-run Industrial Promotion and Investment Limited, which is a nodal agency for industrial projects. 

 In turn the agency examines projects before they are referred to a single window clearance committee, which is headed by the chief minister himself. 

 Meanwhile, the company has applied to the coal ministry for blocks. It has also applied to the water resources department to seek permission to use riverwater for plants. 

 If the proposal is cleared by the government, Chambal Infrastructure Venture Limited will be the 14th company to sign an MoU with Orissa government to set up a thermal power plant in Orissa.

 Already 13 power companies have signed MoUs for setting up plants with a total capacity of 16,000MW and for am investment of Rs 70,000 crore.

 Many have already acquired land and obtained environment clearance, as well as, permission for industrial water use. 

 Two to three firms have also been allotted coal blocks, Patro added. 

 Construction of power plants proposed to be set up by Vedanta Power Limited has already started in Jharsuguda.

 Leaders amp; babus on collision course

 AK Chugh (top) and Pradeep Balmuchu: At loggerheads 

 Ranchi, July 6: The states political scenario got murkier today with politicians and bureaucrats marching on a collision course.

 The IAS Officers Association, at a general body meeting, condemned the growing incidents of humiliation and insult of the government officials, including the IAS officers by MPs and MLAs.

 The association also decided to send a memorandum to Rajya Sabha chairman, Speaker of the Lok Sabha as well as the Assembly, chief minister and the All-India IAS Officers Association to rein in the truant public representatives.

 The immediate provocation for the IAS officers to come out against the public representatives had been an incident in Bokaro on Wednesday, where, as the association claimed, a few members of the Assembly publicly insulted, humiliated and made unsubstantiated charges against deputy commissioner Sunil Kumar. 

 This is not an isolated incident but the latest in a series of such events against government servants in general and IAS officers in particular, the association said. It has also demanded the government to take remedial steps to avoid recurrence of such incidents.

 The resolution adopted by the association states that the IAS officers have the highest regard for legislators and their role in parliamentary democracy. However, we also believe that being a legislator does not entitle anyone to indulge in derogatory behaviour and to exceed the limits of decorum and decency. On the contrary, legislators and public representatives are expected to set standards of behaviour, it said.

 Even though, as a service, we are reluctant to publicly react to such incidents, the situation in Jharkhand, where not only the members of the IAS, but government servants in general, are being constantly demeaned, demands a response, it adds.

 Meanwhile, the Congress launched a proxy war against chief minister Madhu Koda by seeking the removal of chief secretary A.K. Chugh and his principal secretary Sukhdev Singh. State Congress president Pradeep Balmuchu made them their target alleging that the two officers were creating roadblocks for the development of the state. He added that ambitious schemes like strengthening vigilance units at district levels and setting up well-equipped sadar hospital did not materialise due to apathy of these officials.

 Sources, however, said that Chugh objected to the sadar hospital proposal on the grounds that he wanted a comprehensive proposal, including creation of requisite posts and equipment, instead of constructing the building merely.

 According to officers, the job of Sukhdev Singh was just to point out the legal points involved in any issue. It is the chief minister who takes a final decision in any case, they added. Singh, a few days back, had invited the ire of road construction secretary Arun Singh who charged him with throwing a spanner in his proposals. The principal secretary had shot back, saying he could not land the chief minister in jail by not pointing out what is wrong.

 Release hope for engineer 

 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES

 New Delhi/Guwahati, May 21: Talks between the abductors of two engineers in Nigeria and their employers for the safe release of the hostages are on, the wife of one of them said today.

 Negotiations are on between the kidnappers and officials of Indorama for the safe release of the two men, Lata Kakoti, wife of kidnapped 32-year-old fire engineer Debasish Kakoti, told PTI from Port Harcourt in Nigeria. Though they (company officials) have not assured me anything, they said they are hopeful of brokering a breakthrough, maybe by tonight. 

 Debasish, who is from Sivasagar town in Assam, and Sunil Dave of Maharashtra were abducted from their residential quarters in Port Harcourt on Saturday morning.

 The abducted mens employer, oil exploration company Indorama, has been contacted by the abductors who said they were safe.

 Indoramas officials did not give Lata details about the kidnappers or say whether any ransom was being paid for the release of the two men.

 Ajit Kakati, father of the abducted engineer, said they were expecting some positive news very soon as the company which employed his son had assured to pay the ransom to secure the release of Debasish and his two colleagues. 

 He said over telephone that Debasish spoke to his colleagues and wife Lata this morning and said that he was safe and sound. 

 Lata told her father-in-law this morning that the company officials were in touch with the abductors. Our time difference with Nigeria is posing a problem. Nigeria is about four-and-a-half hours behind us. They are expecting Debasishs release by this evening, his father said.

 Company officials have not given me any assurances. But they are hopeful of brokering a deal maybe by today, Lata said.

 The Centre yesterday said there were some positive signs in the negotiations with the abductors. Some private parties and not the government are conducting the negotiations as the kidnappers are purely criminal elements, said an official in the external affairs ministry. 

 The abduction of the Indians is the latest in a string of kidnappings of foreign workers in Nigeria.

 Trains on track as red stain fades

 OUR BUREAU

 Sambalpur/Jamshedpur, June 28: After two days of disruption, rail services in the Ranchi division of South Eastern Railway returned to normalcy from this morning.

 Train services across the state were adversely affected since June 26 following the two-day economic blockade called by the CPI (Maoist). 

 However, the blockade was not without its share of bloodshed. Maoists struck at two places late Wednesday night, holding up traffic on national highways 33, in Jharkhand, and 42, in Orissa. 

 In the attack in Jharkhand, a businessman was killed and another sustained bullet injuries when Maoists opened fire on a mini-truck in Tikra, under Tamar police station.

 The firing occurred late last night when the truck was carrying pipes to Ranchi, violating the economic blockade called by the rebels. 

 The deceased has been identified as Saroj Kumar Singh, while the injured is Pintu Singh both resident of Adityapur. They were sitting beside the driver. Pintu Singh has been admitted to Tata Main Hospital.

 Meanwhile, on NH-42, 50-odd Maoists fired upon one Kishore Chandra Mohanty, who was travelling from Hirakud to Talcher in his car. Mohanty underwent an operation at VSS Medical College in Bhubaneswar last night and his condition is said to be stable. NH-42 connects Cuttack with Sambalpur and passes through the dense forests of Rairakhol, where Maoists are said to be active.

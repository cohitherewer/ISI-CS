 Arms fail 

to prevent rhino death

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, July 18: A consignment of weapons arrived at the Kaziranga National Park yesterday to add teeth to the armoury of the forest guards just hours before poachers killed a rhino and took away its horn. 

 The new consignment of arms was supplied to the national park in the wake of an increase in poaching in recent times. The consignment includes 50 .315 rifles and 8,000 bullets. 

 The carcass of the female rhino killed yesterday was recovered from the Goroimari area under Bagori range. The range has the highest concentration of rhinos in the national park and as such is heavily guarded. 

 The poachers struck barely an hour after labourers engaged in road repairs in the area had departed for the night. 

 With yesterdays killing, nine rhinos have fallen prey to poachers this year. 

 In another incident, a giant tusker was electrocuted at Diplonga range in Sonitpur district today when the elephant came out of Kaziranga in search of food. The elephant hit a live wire.

 State dials Centre for flood recce

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, July 9: The state government today requested the Centre to depute a team to make an on-the-spot assessment of extensive damage caused by the devastating flood in north Orissa as the official death toll reached 16.

 While the flood and heavy downpour claimed 12 human lives in the worst-hit Balasore district, three persons have died in Bhadrak and one in Jajpur district.

 Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today visited flood-hit areas of Jajpur district and reviewed the situation at the district headquarters town. Yesterday, Patnaik had made an aerial survey of Balasore, Bhadrak, Mayurbhanj and Jajpur districts.

 State disaster management minister Manmohan Samal told The Telegraph over telephone from Jajpur that the state government had written to the Centre to depute a team to make an on-the-spot assessment of the prevailing flood situation and the extensive damage caused by the deluge.

 Special relief commissioner N.K. Sundaray said air-dropping of food packets was on in inaccessible pockets. 

 Two IAF helicopters were engaged in the job, he added.

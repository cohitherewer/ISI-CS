 No change in NSCN truce rules

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Kohima, March 24: Union home ministry officials held a closed-door meeting with National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Khaplang) representatives at Mon today to review the ground rules of Delhis ceasefire with the outfit. 

 The NSCN (K) had entered into a ceasefire pact with the Centre on April 31, 2001 but political dialogue is yet to begin.

 The secretary of the outfits ceasefire supervisory board, Sechom Sangtam, told The Telegraph over phone that the meeting, attended by special secretary (internal security) M.L. Kamawat and intelligence bureau director in-charge of the Northeast A.K. Goel, was not satisfactory. 

 Sangtam said the outfit had tabled the list of civilians killed by the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) after the ceasefire in 1997, but the officials refused to discuss it in the absence of the rival faction. 

 He said there was no discussion on amendments to the existing truce ground rules, but the ministry had assured stricter implementation of the pact to avoid factional clashes, which have emerged as an impediment to peace in the state. 

 Sangtam said his organisation has agreed to identify designated camps for the cadre in the state as instructed by the Centre within six weeks. He said regular attacks on camps by the NSCN (I-M) had forced the outfit to close them down. 

 The Centre allotted seven designated camps each to both factions of the NSCN, but the Khaplang group is now left with none, while the Isak-Muivah outfit has several camps spread across Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and parts of Assam. 

 Yesterday, the team from Delhi met representatives of the NSCN (I-M) in Dimapur, where the focus was mainly on reinstating peace. Both sides want strict adherence of the ceasefire ground rules, Kamawat said. 

 The special secretary said ministry officials would attend all consultative meetings of the ceasefire monitoring group henceforth. 

 Convenor of the NSCN (I-M) ceasefire monitoring cell Phunthing Shimrang, who led the team at the meeting, said no amendment to the pact was discussed. He was, however, tight-lipped about the details of the talks. 

 Last evening, the delegation met the states top officials and later called on Governor K. Shankaranarayanan and chief minister Neiphiu Rio to discuss the implementation of the truce. 

 In a related incident, NSCN (K) men attacked the Town Command Office of the NSCN (I-M) at Wokha, 80 km from here last night, killing a woman member of the group.

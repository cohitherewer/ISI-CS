 Lady gives lads their day

 - Some men line up a November 19 reply to March 8

 Delhi, May 17: Real men respect women. So it should be no surprise if male lobbies clamouring for a Mens Day choose to celebrate it on Indira Gandhis birthday.

 But the mens reasoning is a bit different. The former Prime Minister had been hailed as the only man in her Cabinet by supporters and critics, so who better as a role model?

 Therefore, come November 19, and male bosses will be giving staff time off to go and celebrate. At least, so it says on the worldwide web.

 Blogs are being created and ringing messages sent out across the cyberspace urging all good men to join the cause of setting up a counterbalance for March 8, International Womens Day.

 Unlike the women textile workers who had protested in New York on March 8, 1857, demanding better working conditions and wages, the mens grievances are not economic. They are angry with women for ignoring their rights.

 One of the groups behind the move is called Save the Family. 

 Its unclear if the other organisations include those formed to protect men from harassment by their wives, such as the Pirito Purush Pati Parishad (Forum for Harassed Husbands) in Calcutta and the Akhil Bharatiya Patni Virodhi Morcha (All-India Anti-Wife Front) in Delhi.

 These bodies bristle at the laws against domestic violence and sexual harassment at the workplace. Their favourite target is Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code, which they claim is regularly misused by women to get their husbands booked for cruelty.

 The website www.genderindian.sulekha.com provides another reason for the choice of date.

 November 19, which is celebrated as mens day in many countries -- Brazil, Canada -- will also be celebrated in India, a message says.

 Wrong, of course: Its Trinidad and Tobago, and neither Brazil nor Canada, that celebrates November 19 as Mens Day.

 There are suggestions about how to celebrate the day. One way is to take the day off. Watch a film or at least share a bar of chocolate with your colleagues, suggests a sympathiser.

 But some techies in Delhi and Mumbai are planning it big.

 IT managers are convinced that it is the day men will keep for themselves. They will be providing free tickets to their subordinates (men and women) for films. There will be a reflection and a celebration card for every one who watches the film, says a message.

 A manager in Delhi plans a McDonald moment. Another in Mumbai will hand out chocolates among co-passengers on his local train.

 Not everyone is excited. Its a weird idea and is not selling well to me, Wipros Puneet Kumar said. An international day for women I can understand. They live in a society where every day is a mens day. Men rule every day.

 Not if they have an Indira Gandhi to reckon with, though. But the former Prime Minister has always attracted unexpected fans, especially from among conservative men.

 Former Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief K.S. Sudarshan is said to have rated her even above the parivars own Atal Bihari Vajpayee as Prime Minister because she had divided Pakistan. Vajpayee herself saluted her as Durga after the 1971 war.

 The same year, when she visited Washington, President Richard Nixons assistant asked his Indian counterpart how she liked to be addressed. He was told her cabinet colleagues addressed her as Sir.

 The date was an easy choice, the mens lobbies say.

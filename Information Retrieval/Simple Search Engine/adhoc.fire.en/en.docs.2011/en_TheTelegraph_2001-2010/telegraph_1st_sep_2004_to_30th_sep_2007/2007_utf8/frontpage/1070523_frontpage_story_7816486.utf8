 HS results out, 

faster amp; better

 OUR BUREAU 

 May 22: And the topper isthe Assam Higher Secondary Education Council.

 Results of the higher secondary examinations in all three streams arts, science and commerce were declared together today, marking a first for a state that has just taken the route to radical education reforms.

 Today is really a historic day. We have declared our higher secondary results before the CBSE. Tomorrow, the matric results will be out, again before the central board. Both the AHSEC and the Board of Secondary Education, Assam, deserve credit for giving students who aspire to study outside the state ample time to make their plans and apply for seats, education minister Ripun Bora said.

 He did not forget to remind everyone that this has been made possible by the process of reforms initiated by our government.

 While reforms made the evaluation process faster, the results continued to follow a trend that was established a few years ago. Junior colleges and small-town institutions again produced the toppers, leaving behemoths like Cotton College to do some introspection.

 Kangkana Sharma, an institutional private candidate, topped the honours list in the arts stream. The second spot also went to an institutional private examinee, Tridip Bordoloi.

 Although Cotton College redeemed itself in the science stream, somebody else was on the summit. Anupjyoti Deka of Darrang College bagged the first position and Bikash Kumar Agarwal of Cotton College got the second place. Two more Cottonians figured in the top five.

 In the commerce stream, Gauhati Commerce College maintained its monopoly. Nishika Ajit Saria led the merit list, with classmate Ankini Singh in second place.

 Except in the science stream, the pass percentages increased marginally over last years results.

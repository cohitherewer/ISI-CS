 Breast cancer gene breakthrough

 - Discovery expected to help design tests in 15 years to predict risk

 New Delhi, May 28: Scientists have discovered four new genes linked to breast cancer, a significant step towards designing tests to predict a womans risk of developing the disease. 

 In a large study spanning continents, an international research team has identified four genes that appear to make women susceptible to certain familial or inherited forms of breast cancer. 

 The researchers are confident that their study will allow a screening programme, in which the inherited risk of developing cancer can be assessed for every patient, to be in place in an estimated 12-15 years. 

 One scientist described the findings as the most important in breast cancer genetics since 1993 and 1995 when the first identification of genes that increase the risk of developing the cancer was made. Doctors believe that around 80,000 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in India each year.

 Douglas Easton from the UK and his colleagues compared the genetic make-up of over 21,000 breast cancer patients and 22,000 women with no cancer to identify the four hitherto unknown genes. 

 One of the new genes, when found in a mutated form, increases the risk of developing the cancer by up to 60 per cent giving a woman a one in six chance of the disease. Its most damaging variant is carried by one in six women, making it much more common than previously identified genes that contribute to breast cancer. 

 The study, published in the journal Nature Genetics this week, also hints at the possible existence of a fifth susceptibility gene. 

 During the 1990s, scientists had identified two genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 associated with breast cancer that runs in families. 

 But these susceptibility genes account for less than 30 per cent of the familial risk of breast cancer, said Satya N. Das, professor of biotechnology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi. 

 Weve always suspected that there were other undiscovered genes, said Das, who has conducted studies in India to identify mutations for inherited breast cancer here. 

 With several susceptibility genes, scientists hope to design predictive tests that could tell women their risk of developing breast cancer. A woman who has a family history of breast cancer and who has such genes would need to be extra careful about diet and hormone levels, Das said. 

 Easton and his colleagues who discovered the new susceptibility genes said the four new genes by themselves do not appear appropriate for predictive tests as they account for only a small proportion of inherited breast cancer. 

 However, as new susceptibility genes get identified in future through similar studies, scientists hope to design tests that combine several such genes to predict a womans risk of developing the cancer. 

 A national atlas of cancer, released by the Indian Council of Medical Research two years ago, had shown that breast cancer is the primary site of cancer among women in several Indian cities. 

 Previous studies by Das at AIIMS and other Indian scientists have indicated that mutations that account for familial breast cancer in India are different from those seen in the West. 

 A study by Das three years ago had shown that two families in Kerala with breast cancer had mutations previously found in the Askanazi Jews. There must have been contact between the two populations, he said. 

 Scientists caution that the presence of a susceptibility gene does not always translate into certain cancer. Several environmental factors such as high fat diet or hormone imbalances in the body are also believed to play a role in the development of breast cancer.

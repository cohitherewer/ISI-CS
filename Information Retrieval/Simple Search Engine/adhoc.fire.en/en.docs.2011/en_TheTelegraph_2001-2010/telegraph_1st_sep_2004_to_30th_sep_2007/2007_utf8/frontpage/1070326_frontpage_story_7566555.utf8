 London, March 25: The Pakistani cricket team, led by its captain, Inzamam-ul-Haq, and assistant coach Mushtaq Ahmed, who were questioned by police about Bob Woolmers murder shortly before their departure from Jamaica, arrived today at Heathrow. 

 They are expected to stay overnight in London before flying home tomorrow to Pakistan. 

 A report in todays Sunday Times said that in the early hours of March 18 shortly before he was killed, Woolmer resigned in an email sent from his laptop to Nasim Ashraf, chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board. 

 Woolmer apparently wrote: I would like to praise my association with the Pakistan team but now I would like to announce my retirement after the World Cup to live the rest of my life in Cape Town.

 According to the paper, Pakistani sources suggested Woolmers resignation e-mail was sent from his laptop to Ashraf at 6 am last Sunday, less than five hours before his body was found in his room by a hotel maid. He had earlier (3.12 am) written to his wife Gill saying he was depressed by the defeat to Ireland but added that it was in the past and one had to move on. 

 Ashraf told the Sunday Times that in the e-mail, Woolmer expressed his great disappointment over the stunning defeat (by Ireland). But he still believes the boys tried their best and fought till the last to make the most of the match. 

 This morning, 22 of Pakistans players and officials were the last to disembark at Heathrow from their Air Jamaica flight and received an escort of six police officers. 

 Observers said they were not very communicative as they went into baggage claims. They then boarded a bus parked at the back of the building to avoid the camera crews waiting in the main concourse. 

 Waiting for the team to come through arrivals at Heathrow airport was Dalawar Chaudhry, who is employed by the Pakistanis team to take care of travel arrangements and hospitality in the UK. 

 He said he would be looking after them during a short stay in London which, he said, was prearranged and would provide them with a time for prayer and reflection before heading back to Pakistan to be with their families. 

 He ruled out any talk of a row between the team members following Pakistans defeat by Ireland. There is a great amount of uncertainty within the team because they are as baffled and confused as you and I are. 

 Jamaicas deputy police commissioner, Mark Shields, told a press conference shown on Sky News that the questioning of Inzamam and Mushtaq was to clear up any possible ambiguities given in the statements from the team. 

 Shields said: There are no further questions. They were asked just to clear up some possible ambiguities but those answers were satisfactory and they are now on their way.

 Back to five frozen minutes

 ANANYA SENGUPTA IN MUMBAI

 6.23pm to 6.28pm, July 11, 2006. 

 The five minutes will stay frozen forever for some. On the first anniversary of the train blasts that killed 187 people in Mumbai, five recall where they were, then and now.

 Name: Kanaiyalal

 Nichani 

 Age: 56 

 Occupation: Insurance

 consultant 

 7/11, 2006: Nichani

 defied death by a whisker. He was on the Borivli fast

 local that was torn apart in Bandra at 6.23pm, killing

 22 people. I was just three doors away from death, says

 Nichani, who was also witness to one of the 1993 serial

 blasts.

 7/11, 2007: Nichani

 took the same train back home to Borivli. When he reached

 Bandra, he thought he heard the sound that made him

 shudder a year ago. I cannot forget that sound.

 But I have learnt to deal with fear, he says. 

 Name: Georgina

 Morenas 

 Age: 40 

 Occupation: HR executive 

 7/11, 2006: Georgina

 was on the train that blew up in Matunga at 6.24pm.

 The first class compartment was immediately behind

 her coach. I heard a loud bang. At first, I thought

 somebody was playing a prank with crackers. But then

 I saw people jumping out of the train, she says.

 Georgina had dizzy spells soon after the blasts a

 fallout, doctors said, of the trauma.

 7/11, 2007: Georgina

 took the same train back home. I have stopped

 worrying about these things. I was paranoid that it

 would happen again. But now I have realised that life

 goes on. 

 Name: Rajesh

 Prakash Lanjekar 

 Age: 30 

 Occupation: Sales

 coordinator, Discovery Channel 

 7/11, 2006: Lanjekar

 witnessed death from close quarters for the first time.

 He was on a train that was running adjacent to the

 Borivli fast that blew up in Mahim. How can I

 forget those five minutes? I was listening to songs

 on my radio when I heard this earth-shattering sound.

 I jumped off the train and pulled 20-25 people out

 of the compartment which, by then, was soaked in blood. 

 7/11, 2007: Lanjekar

 was one among the many Mumbaikars who prayed for the

 victims. I went to the Mahalaxmi temple with

 my friends and offered prayers around the same time

 as the blasts.

 Name: Pankaj

 Shah 

 Age: 53 

 Occupation: Diamond

 merchant 

 7/11, 2006: Shah

 was among the few who survived in the coach of the

 Borivli fast that exploded at Mahim. Almost everyone

 was dead. Bodies were everywhere. I lost the capacity

 to hear in my right ear. I will have to live with this

 all my life, says Shah. 

 7/11, 2007: Shah

 boarded the Borivli fast again. I have no fears.

 Those five minutes changed my life, but I havent

 changed the way I live it.

 Name: Velma

 Fernandes 

 Age: 47 

 Occupation: Executive,

 Bank of Maharashtra 

 7/11, 2006: Velma

 represents the thousands who died many deaths but will

 not make it to official records. Her brother-in-law

 and sister-in-law were out in the evening. When

 you are at home and a thing like that happens, you

 think of all the gruesome things. My sister-in-law

 had two small children alone at home. I kept calling

 her, but to no avail. It was the most horrifying five

 minutes of my life. Later, she found out both

 had escaped the blasts.

 7/11, 2007: Her

 church held a Holy Hour from 6pm to 7pm. Velma was

 there to pray.

 Kingpin dead in court crossfire

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, May 9: An undertrial gangster shot dead another underworld don and his rival prisoner in Motihari on the court premises, which was dotted with security forces, lawyers and judges. 

 The incident triggered a furious burst of violence in the north Bihar town, 150 km from here. Police fired six rounds in the air to quell the slain mans supporters, who went on rampage pelting stones on the forces and the people. 

 According to the police, Raju Kumar Rathor, a UP-based criminal, shot in the head of notorious gangster Chhote Lal Sahni with a 9-mm pistol around 9.30 am killing him on the spot. Sahni was known as a terror in the Champaran region and was also involved in the abduction of many traders operating in Nepal and along the Indo-Nepal border.

 Rathor, too, is a notorious underworld operator involved in cases of murder, abduction and road hold-ups, said Motihari deputy superintendent of police Harendra Kumar Verma. Both headed rival gangs. And both were in the Motihari prison for nearly two years. 

 Sahnis supporters went on rampage soon after his death. They followed his body that was taken to the Motihari sadar hospital and began pelting stones on the police party and the passers-by. Unable to restore peace by persuasion, the security forces fired six rounds in the air to disperse the crowd, the DSP said.

 Asked how an undertrial procured a pistol, a police officer said: It appears that some Rathor supporters gave him the pistol. However, we are looking into the matter.

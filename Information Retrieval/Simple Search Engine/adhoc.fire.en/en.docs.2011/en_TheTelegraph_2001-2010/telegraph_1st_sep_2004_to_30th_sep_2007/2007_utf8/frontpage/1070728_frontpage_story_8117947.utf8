 Saga of the 

 evil in the flesh

 - Women on display at a brothel disgusts author 

 IT'S MY 

 LIFE - Mamoni Raisom Goswami

 The writer continues her narrative 

 of a visit to a red light area in Delhi

 The visit to the brothel was proving 

 to be a harrowing experience. Somehow, however, I had gained 

 a measure of confidence. 

 Now, before going back, I went 

 into another room. To do so, I had to cross another room, 

 which seemed to be on a mezzanine. In place of the usual 

 posters of filmstars, the portrait of a courtesan of the 

 past adorned a corner of a wall. 

 Its wooden frame was worn out. 

 She had plump and well-formed legs and arms, like in a portrait 

 by Ravi Verma. In her pointed nose, she wore a nose ring. 

 Her face was veiled with a dupatta. Her pyjamas were 

 in the style of the courts, in heavy peshwaj and 

 zari. 

 I had read about Padmini, Chitrini 

 and other kinds of women in the shastras. I was reminded 

 of the description of a Shankhini. These extremely 

 beautiful women are always smitten with the arrows of Madan, 

 the god of love. They leave their husbands, frolic with 

 others and have sex with a glad and thrilled heart. 

 How old is this portrait? 

 I asked. 

 Should be a hundred years 

 old. 

 Who is the lady? 

 Heera Bai. 

 Who painted it? 

 A white man. She had taanka 

 with him. 

 Taanka? 

 The prostitute gave me an arch 

 look and smiled. I understood. 

 In the meantime, I had taken out 

 my notebook. But it was not easy to put things down in black 

 and white. 

 As I was coming downstairs, I 

 noticed some more cubicles. These must never have seen a 

 fresh coat of paint. Their walls were peeling off like the 

 skin of a rotten muskmelon. 

 There were stoves and rags scattered 

 everywhere, and women were sitting around them like bags 

 of wheat. 

 Finally, I came out in the courtyard. 

 Surprisingly, Santokh Singh was still there. He was pacing 

 in front of the shops selling marble, iron rods, cement 

 and other goods. He came towards me and told me that he 

 had parked his vehicle near the kerb. 

 In the building next to the one 

 with the signboard of Bharat Marbles, a group of whores, 

 garishly dressed, was peering down at the road below from 

 the balcony. A motley crowd of men, young and old, tall 

 and short, was staring up at them. It was a horrible spectacle. 

 Like a butchers shop, with live human flesh hanging 

 from hooks. I had never before seen such a disgusting sight. 

 As we were making our way through 

 the gaping group, a shrill voice assailed my ears. If 

 you are really men, why do you stand there ogling? If you 

 have money on you, go up. 

 A thin boy from among the ogling 

 crowd tittered, Look, look, now a hijra wants 

 to teach us how to be men! 

 Angered by the taunt, the eunuch 

 went down past me and swooped down and caught hold of the 

 boy. Shouting in a kite-like voice, she dragged the boy 

 to the bottom of a flight of steps and said, You wicked 

 brat, Im taking you up there. Ill even pay for 

 you. 

 It was followed by a free-for-all. 

 I somehow extricated myself and hurriedly made for Santokh 

 Singhs three-wheeler.

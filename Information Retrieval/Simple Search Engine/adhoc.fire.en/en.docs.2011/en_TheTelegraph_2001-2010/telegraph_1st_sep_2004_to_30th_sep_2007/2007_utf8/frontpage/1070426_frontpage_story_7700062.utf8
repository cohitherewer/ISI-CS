 Earths cousin, wet and warm

 New Delhi, April 25: Astronomers 

 have discovered the first planet outside the solar system 

 that could have liquid water and liveable temperatures - 

 a potential new spot to look for extraterrestrial life.

 The planet, orbiting a red dwarf 

 star named Gliese 581, is the first that appears to lie 

 in a habitable zone the region around a star where 

 water is in its liquid form a team of European astronomers 

 has said.

 The astronomers, who announced 

 their finding today after submitting it to the journal Astronomy 

 and Astrophysics, have estimated that the average temperature 

 on the planet which is about five times more massive 

 than Earth would be 0 to 40 degrees Celsius. 

 Like other exoplanets 

 orbiting other stars the planet around Gliese 581 

 is too small and too far for direct observations or temperature 

 measurements. The researchers detected its presence indirectly 

 by tracking tiny changes in the velocity of its parent star 

 in the constellation Libra.

 This planet will most probably 

 be a very important target of future space missions dedicated 

 to the search for extra-terrestrial life, said Xavier 

 Delfosse, a team member at Grenoble University in France. 

 On the treasure map of 

 the universe, one would be tempted to mark this planet with 

 an X, Delfosse said. 

 Gliese 581 is among the 100 stars 

 closest to the solar system only 20 light years 

 away from Sun, but smaller and colder. Although astronomers 

 have detected more than 220 exoplanets, most are gas giants 

 that resemble Jupiter or Saturn. 

 Smaller planets are harder to 

 find, but computer simulations of the formation of planets 

 show that small planets are more likely to be rocky and 

 hold water. 

 Calculations show that 

 small planets turn out to be rocky like Mars or Earth, 

 Xavier Bonfils, a team member at Lisbon University, Portugal, 

 told The Telegraph. During formation, 

 small planets may accumulate water which if still 

 present would be liquid in the temperature range 

 weve estimated.

 The planet is so close to its 

 star that it takes only 13 days to complete an orbit. The 

 astronomers estimated the temperature using star-planet 

 distance and assuming that the reflecting power of the planet 

 is the same as that of Venus in the solar system. 

 This finding suggests that 

 planets may be fairly common in our galaxy, Thierry 

 Forveille, a Grenoble astronomer said. Red dwarf 

 stars of this type are the most common in our galaxy, 

 he said. Among the 100 stars closest to Sun, nearly 80 are 

 red dwarfs. 

 The scientists now plan to look 

 for transits of the planet across the face of its star. 

 There is a small chance that such a transit will 

 occur, but if it does, we could measure the size of the 

 planet, said Forveille. Our current size estimations 

 are based on computer models not measurements.

 The scientists detected the Super 

 Earth by observing the change in the velocity of the parent 

 star typically caused by orbiting planets with the help 

 of an instrument called HARPS located in an observatory 

 perched high in the mountains of Chile. 

 The velocity change method has 

 been used to detect at least 200 of the 220 planets discovered 

 outside the solar system. HARPS is the most precise 

 instrument in the world to measure the velocity change and 

 has helped detect 11 of the 13 planets with masses within 

 20 Earth masses, Stephane Udry, an astronomer at 

 Geneva Observatory, said. 

 Two years ago, Udry and his colleagues 

 had detected a planet with the mass of Neptune around the 

 same star. Their new finding adds two planets the 

 five Earth mass planet in the habitable zone and an eight 

 Earth mass planet further away.

 Astronomers cautioned that the 

 estimation of temperature on the planet was based on unproven 

 assumptions and that the idea of liquid water is mere speculation. 

 The atmosphere of a planet 

 is absolutely crucial to determine its surface temperature 

 and we know nothing about its atmosphere, Eugene 

 Chiang at the University of California, Berkeley, told The 

 Telegraph.

 The standard way to study the 

 atmosphere would be to examine the feeble emissions of light 

 from a planet. But we dont have technology 

 yet to study emissions from so far away, Chiang said. 

 But when technology becomes available perhaps 

 in about 20 years this planet would be one of our 

 first targets.

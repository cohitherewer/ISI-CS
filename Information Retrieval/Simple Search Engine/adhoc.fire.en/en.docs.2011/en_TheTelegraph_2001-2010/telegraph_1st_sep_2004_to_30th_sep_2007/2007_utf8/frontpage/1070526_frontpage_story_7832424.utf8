 Kiss of Brazilian bombshell

 - Deal in the works for joint production of films

 Ana Cristina Costa e Silva: Friend from Brazil

 Brasilia, May 25: If Raj Kapoor and Soviet actress Kseniya Ryabinkina took the message of friendship between their countries into the remotest enclaves of the Soviet Union three decades ago, Calcutta-born Indranil Chakravarty and a leading film producer here, Ana Cristina Costa e Silva, are hoping to lay the foundation for replicating that magic in Indo-Brazilian relations next month.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Brazils President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva are to approve an agreement for joint production of Indo-Brazilian films when they meet in New Delhi in the first week of June.

 That agreement will immediately lead to the joint production of the first venture of its kind, starring Sonia Braga the Latin American superstar known as the Brazilian bombshell who is best known outside Brazil for her role in Kiss of the Spiderwoman.

 On the Indian side, negotiations are under way to cast Naseeruddin Shah and Zohra Sehgal, among others, in Tamarindo, the story of a Brazilian journalist who travels to Goa in search of his father.

 The film, to be shot in India, Portugal and Brazil, begins with the liberation of Goa and will be directed by Chakravarty, who taught screenplay at Calcuttas Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute in its early years.

 A student of Gabriel Garcia Marquez at the International Film and Television School in Havana which was founded by the 1982 Nobel Prize winner for literature as a symbol of his friendship with Cuban President Fidel Castro Chakravarty is now professor of screenplay-writing at Whistling Woods International in Mumbais Film City.

 Ana Cristina, who is president of the Association of Brazilian Film Commissions and founder of her countrys first regional film commission, is an ardent Indophile, who has named her production company Dharma Filmes e Producoes to flaunt her love for India.

 But the efforts by her and Chakravarty to get a joint Indo-Brazilian film off the ground met with the usual bureaucratic dead ends in both countries until she met the Indian Prime Minister in September last year.

 Singh, who was visiting Brasilia, had expressed a desire to meet a cross-section of Brazilian intellectuals, including writers, economists and arts personalities. It was arranged by Indias ambassador to Brazil Hardeep Singh Puri and Cristina was one of the intellectuals who agreed to take part in the dialogue.

 During a conversation with The Telegraph in Brasilia, she recalled: Suddenly, ambassador Puri, who was moderating the discussion, told the Prime Minister that this young lady has some things to say about films. I did not know where to begin, but soon, like a dam bursting open, I was telling him the story of our hopes and frustrations.

 From that point, it was easy. On Monday, authorities in New Delhi cleared the text of the joint production agreement that will be signed during Lulas visit to India.

 A few days earlier, the Brazilian authorities had approved the text and sent it to India for final clearance.

 Puri recalled that films were the most powerful instrument in Indo-Soviet relations, transforming and interpreting what the two states were doing with one another into bonds that made the two peoples aware of each other.

 Far away from mainstream Russia, in places such as Ashgabat and Tashkent in Central Asia, this reporter had been accosted by people many years ago, singing tunes from Sangam and Awara. 

 With the signing of the agreement, films produced in one country will be treated like a national production in the other.

 This will only be the second agreement of its kind that India has signed with any country. It provides for tax incentives and is expected to see Indian producers eventually make a beeline for Brazil in search of shooting locations because of economic incentives in the agreement, which reduce their financial risk, according to Chakravarty.

 Meghalaya DGP shifted

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Shillong, March 19: Meghalaya director-general of police W.R. Marbaniang has been transferred as the director-general of home guards and civil defence. He will be replaced by B.K. Dey Sawian, the director-general of home guards and civil defence. 

 The decision was taken during a meeting convened by chief minister D.D. Lapang, who also holds the home portfolio. Chief secretary S.K. Tiwari told The Telegraph that the transfer was a routine reshuffle.

 Marbaniang, however, has been under the scanner since a 26-year-old girl, Rinehskham Kharsahnoh, was found dead in the ancestral house of his wife at Nongthymmai here on March 7. 

 The Marbaniangs stay in the house occasionally. The DGP was in the house when the body was found.

 Rinehskham used to stay in the house with her mother Shinti Kharsahnoh and her two-year-old son. She had moved here in December last year after the death of Marbaniangs mother-in-law B.C. Thomas, for whom she used to work as a domestic help. 

 A milkman apparently spotted her body lying in a room of the house on the morning of March 7. 

 The body, with the head barely attached to the torso, was sent for post-mortem immediately and handed over to the girls family later in the day. 

 Police claimed that Rinehskham had slit her throat to end her life for some reason. 

 Raising a hue and cry against the suicide theory propounded by the police, the girls family claimed that Rinehskham had been murdered. Her mother dared the police to exhume the body and send it for forensic examination to unearth the truth. 

 Shinti said in her statement that the police had not allowed her to see her daughters body that day saying that dogs are sniffing around and you cannot see the body now. 

 The Civil Society Womens Organisation and several other NGOs of Shillong have demanded a CBI probe into the incident. 

 The organisations chairperson Irene Hujon had said they would meet chief minister D.D. Lapang on Tuesday to put forth their demand. 

 According to the PTI, the state government today recommended a CBI inquiry into the girls death.

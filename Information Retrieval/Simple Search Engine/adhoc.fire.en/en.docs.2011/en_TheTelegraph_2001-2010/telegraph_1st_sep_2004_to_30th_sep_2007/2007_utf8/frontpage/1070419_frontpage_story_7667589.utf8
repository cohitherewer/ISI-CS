 Mumbai, April 18: What do you do when your ex ties the knot with someone else?

 Salman Khan or at least someone who resembled him congratulated the groom, Rani Mukerji stayed away, Karisma Kapoor was ignored and Viveik Oberoi bore the brunt.

 As the celebrations for the Abhishek-Aishwarya wedding got under way today with the sangeet ceremony at Amitabh Bachchans old Juhu bungalow, Prateeksha, the couples former sweethearts danced to their own different beats.

 Salman handled it coolly. When all eyes and cameras were focused on Prateeksha this afternoon, the other Bachchan bungalow, Jalsa, saw an unexpected guest get off a blue Scorpio.

 Some speculated he might be a duplicate planted to mislead the media. After all, an Abhishek look-alike had caused a security breach at Ashs home earlier in the day. But no, the man in the white shirt seemed Salman all right.

 A source close to the actor said he had been invited to Fridays wedding but wouldnt be turning up. So, he wanted to congratulate close friend Abhishek in private.

 He was one of the first people to congratulate Abhishek when the engagement was officially announced in January, the source said.

 But Rani, once tipped to become the Bachchan bahu, has put off moving into her new bungalow in Juhu.

 She told The Telegraph she had been slated to move in this month, but the interior decoration is taking some time, so it will only be in May, I guess.

 But sources said the bungalows proximity to Prateeksha and Jalsa had prompted Rani to postpone her housewarming at a time wedding bells are ringing in the neighbourhood.

 As the industry buzzed with excitement over the big Bollywood marriage, Rani was away from it all, shooting for a special television promotional of her new film Ta Ra Rum Pum in Andheris Yash Raj Studios.

 After the shoot, when she was requested to congratulate Abhishek and Aishwarya on camera, Buntys Babli refused.

 Karisma Kapoor, who used to be formally engaged to Abhishek, has not been invited to the wedding. While the rest of the Kapoor family has supposedly been sent the cards, Karisma and sister Kareena have been left out.

 Handed the snub in a different way has been Viveik Oberoi. The actor, who was seeing Aishwarya before she became Abhisheks girlfriend, has been described as a man on a mission by the grooms mother, Jaya Bachchan, on Karan Johars TV chat show Koffee With Karan.

 The music release of Viveiks forthcoming film, Shootout At Lokhandwala, which has guest cameos by Amitabh and Abhishek, was given the miss by the Bachchans last weekend.

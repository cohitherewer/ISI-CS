 10-year jail for lecturer

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Cuttack, Sept. 29: A lecturer of a private college and five others were sentenced to 10 years rigorous imprisonment by the court of the additional district sessions judge today in a counterfeit currency-printing racket busted in 2001. 

 Nirmal Timu from Assam, the kingpin of an inter-state fake currency racket, is among those convicted with the lecturer, Nilambara Baral, and Pronab Kumar Maity, Hafeez Gulam Rabbani, Nrusingha Charan Mallik and Brahmarabar Sahu.

 The additional district sessions judge, Ghanashyam Panigrahi, found them guilty under Sections 489 (a) and (d) of IPC and sentenced them to 10 years in each count to be served concurrently, public prosecutor Hemanta Jena said. 

 The judge also imposed a penalty of Rs 10,000 on each of the convict and ordered additional two years rigorous imprisonment on non-payment of the fine.

 The racket was unearthed following raids at a rented shed at Madhusudan Nagar on November 22, 2001. Eighteen half-printed currency notes in the denomination of Rs 50 were seized along with a computerised printing set-up replete with high power printers and stacks of quality paper.

 Baral, a chemistry lecturer of Christ College, was arrested from the spot while taking his wife, also a lecturer in the same college, into custody.

 However, his wife Sandhyarani Baral was acquitted with six others.

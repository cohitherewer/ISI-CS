 Quit step to BJP door

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ranchi, March 20: Former Speaker Inder Singh Namdhari today moved closer to a much-anticipated return to the BJP, when his resignation from the House was formally accepted by the present incumbent, Alamgir Alam.

 I have accepted his resignation with a heavy heart, said Alam. The Assembly has lost an efficient and experienced member. 

 Namdhari had submitted his resignation on March 11 but he had asked the former Speaker to reconsider, said Alam. I once again spoke to him yesterday and enquired whether his resignation is final. He replied politely that he would not withdraw the resignation, said the Speaker, leaving me with no option but to accept it.

 With Namdharis resignation, the strength of the JD(U) has been reduced to five from six. With one of the AJSU legislators occupying a ministerial berth, the NDA strength in the Assembly has suffered a further jolt, which will no doubt enable the UPA government to breathe more easily. 

 Namdhari resigned ostensibly to protest the earlier JD(U) decision to field a candidate for the Palamau byelection. But though the JD(U) had second thoughts and decided to support the BJP candidate in the election, Namdhari refused to review his decision.

 He is already campaigning for the BJP in Palamau and his formal home-coming appears to be a matter of time. 

 An old BJP loyalist, he has been a minister in united Bihar and held organisational posts before revolting against the party leadership. But elected Speaker of two consecutive Assemblies in Jharkhand, he finally resigned last year after the NDA government led by Arjun Munda lost its majority.

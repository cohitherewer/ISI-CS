 Hundreds and thousands of small, 

 irregular pieces of broken porcelain were once used to embellish 

 the surfaces and floors of dwelling houses, temples, mosques 

 and eateries in Mumbai and Calcutta. Known as crazy paving 

 (some say mosaic), these shards of china, some patterned 

 but mostly white or blue, turned buildings into pieces of 

 gleaming jewellery that stood out a mile. Bijou, in the 

 true sense of the term.

 The most striking of structures 

 decorated in this fashion is the Parasvanath Jain temple 

 of Maniktala. This fantastic, quaint shrine with a pond 

 in front and Palitana-fashion shikhara is still encrusted 

 with tiny chips of porcelain in floral motifs. Most of these 

 gleaming china pieces have dropped off but what remains 

 still makes this temple a very precious example of a craft 

 that has all but disappeared. 

 Crazy paving may remind one of 

 the work of architect Antoni Gaudi, who had created a huge 

 undulating bench of the same material in a park in Barcelona. 

 This form of embellishment was very popular in Latin American 

 and Spain and other Hispanic cultures. 

 Pieces of china were used maybe 

 because they had a cooling effect on the interiors in climes 

 that were relatively warm by European standards. Perhaps 

 it has something to do with the Islamic occupation of Spain 

 but few have any idea of how crazy paving arrived in India.

 I asked pioneering potter Ira 

 Chaudhuri if she had any clue. All she could say was that 

 in Mumbai, where she grew up, there used to be several houses 

 owned by Parsis with crazy paving, which was locally called 

 kodi floor, which was a popular term for porcelain 

 even among Bengalis. Now most of them have disappeared.

 Although developers are playing 

 havoc in Calcutta too, things are not as bad as in Mumbai. 

 So some buildings and eateries where crazy china was used 

 have survived. There are still some houses in the Ripon 

 Street-Eliot Road neighbourhoods Anglo-Indian heartland 

 of yore where one can find houses with traces of crazy 

 china flooring. The shards gleam like mother of pearl through 

 the layers of cement.

 If one looks carefully, one can 

 detect some Muslim eateries resplendent in crazy china. 

 There is a particularly beautiful example on Rafi Ahmed 

 Kidwai Road diagonally opposite Wellesley Square. Inside 

 this eatery, which must be close to a century, green creepers 

 grow all over the walls against the white background.

 I saw some beautiful crazy china 

 on the oven of a tiny little eatery in Colootolla. Beef 

 kebabs are cooked in it. One evening I had stumbled upon 

 some beauties in a most unlikely place a potato godown 

 behind Futnani Chambers at the other end of Society cinema, 

 closer to Rani Rashmonis house in Janbazar. The flowering 

 creepers were clearly etched out against the dark walls.

 But to catch sight of two truly 

 spectacular examples one has to travel from one end of the 

 city to the other and beyond Bagbazar and Barisha, close 

 to Behala.

 Siddheswari Kali temple in Bagbazar 

 is opposite Gobindaram Mitters once-lofty Black Pagoda. 

 There is little worth seeing in this temple dedicated to 

 Ginnikali (housewife), as the deity is locally known. Except 

 for the stunning crazy china flowers which could have been 

 painted by Jogen Chowdhury. Even more remarkable is the 

 lettering in Bengali announcing the names of the sebayets 

 (those who have the right to perform puja) all over the 

 walls. Though much of the crazy china on the pillars has 

 been effaced whatever remains is unique. 

 The dargah of Moulali close to 

 Sealdah station was once a fine example of crazy paving. 

 It has lost that beautiful skin for years, but the sanctum 

 sanctorum where crazy china glowed till the other day is 

 now being replaced with tiles in the name of repairs.

 There is, however, a showstopper 

 of a mosque in faraway Barisha. It is at 109 Diamond Harbour 

 Road, and according to a small plaque, it is wakf estate 

 which belonged to Azimunnesa Bibi and Amina Bibi. It is 

 a tiny, feminine mosque with graceful minars and a flat 

 dome. Severe geometric designs relieved by crazy china flowers 

 cover all of the structure.

 A few paces away from it is a 

 crazy china notice board which reads: Established 1929, 

 Azimunnesa Free School, Barisa. Was the mosque too built 

 in that year?

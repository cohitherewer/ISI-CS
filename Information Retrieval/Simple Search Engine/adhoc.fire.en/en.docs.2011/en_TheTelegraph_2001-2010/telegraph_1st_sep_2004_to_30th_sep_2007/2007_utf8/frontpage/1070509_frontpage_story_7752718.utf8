 Bihar MP son linked to Guwahati murder

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Guwahati, May 8: A story of crime and passion with a political connection thrown in unfolded after a hitman allegedly hired by a Bihar MPs son shot dead a youth in the Assam capital today.

 The killer, Manish Ranjan Sharma alias Munna from Bihar, shot Prabhat Kumar Singh while travelling with him in an autorickshaw, police said. 

 After committing the crime at Motghoria, he issued a quick warning to the autorickshaw driver and melted into the crowd that had gathered on hearing gunshots. Munnas arrest at the railway station later in the day revealed that this was not just another murder. 

 Additional superintendent of police Rajen Singh quoted the killer as saying that he shot Prabhat at the behest of Rajya Sabha memberMotiur Rahmans son.

 The killer hails from Samastipur district of Bihar and claims to have killed Prabhat on the instructions of Faizlur Rahman, the MPs son. Faizlur and the victim were fighting over a girl based in Guwahati, he said.

 The police have not ruled out other possible motives. The investigation is at a preliminary stage and we need to crosscheck and verify Munnas statements before reaching any conclusion. We need to find out whether a love affair was the sole reason behind the killing, the additional SP said.

 The killer was carrying a pistol and six rounds of ammunition when a police team caught up with him.

 Sources said Munna was an experienced contract killer and apparently came to the city two days ago with two accomplices. 

 The killer told the police that he telephoned Prabhat this morning and said he wanted to meet him to discuss something very important. The victim agreed and the duo met at the appointed place near Narengi some time later. They then hired an autorickshaw and headed towards Motghoria.

 Bittu, a friend of Prabhat, told The Telegraph that the victim and his killer were last seen in and around Satgaon. Going by what we have heard, they had a discussion in the autorickshaw before Munna took out his pistol and fired from close range. He then fled the scene. We came to know about the incident only when the autorickshaw driver carried the body to a nearby private hospital. My friend was declared brought dead. 

 Prabhat, also from Bihar, had been doing business at Satgaon in Narengi for a few years. Residents said a small restaurant in the locality was his source of income.

 If Munna is to be believed, the victim and Faizlur were in love with the same girl and had quarrelled over her. The MPs son allegedly threatened him with dire consequences if he did not end his relationship with the girl.

 Anurag Agarwal, superintendent of Government Railway Police, said information from Noonmati police led to the killers arrest. Railway police identified Sharma from the bloodstains on his clothes. The killer immediately confessed to the crime and we found a pistol and bullets on him.

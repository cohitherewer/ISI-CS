 Clashing comrades taste iron hand

 OUR BUREAU

 (Top) Pinarayi Vijayan, V.S. Achuthanandan 

 May 26: The CPM today suspended Kerala chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan and party state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan from its politburo after publicly rapping them for fighting each other.

 The biggest disciplinary action in the CPMs history is likely to dent its image as a regimented party that reserves the right to lecture others on right and wrong. The duo, however, keep their jobs in the state where they will continue to discharge all their functions. The length of the suspensions will be decided by the central committee.

 The faction feud in Kerala had reached flashpoint with the chief ministers popular bulldozer drive against illegally built tourist resorts and hotels at the hill station of Munnar. Achuthanandan had also threatened to reclaim land leased to the Tatas there. The Vijayan camp accused him of usurping credit for the demolition decision taken by the ruling combine, Left Democratic Front.

 On Wednesday, the chief minister accused his rival, without naming him, of leaking LDF discussions to the media. Asked if he was referring to Vijayan, he said: Dont you know what I mean?

 Vijayan reacted at once, saying: If he had doubts about another politburo member, he should have said it clearly. This is a courtesy expected between comrades.

 Members have earlier been dropped from the politburo, but quietly and only over political differences or for organisational reasons. Never before have leaders of this stature been publicly accused of infighting and punished.

 As CPM cadre debated who was the bigger loser, many suspected that the move was part of a long-term plan to ease the hardline Achuthanandan out.

 The Vijayan camp, the dominant faction in Kerala, is working to topple the chief minister after the August party elections. It has been weeding out Achuthanandans regional commanders from party rungs.

 But Achuthanandans backers may counter that their leader has retained all his powers as chief minister while organisation man Vijayan, who draws his strength from the cadre, has had his moral authority eroded.

 Even if party chief Prakash Karat wanted sterner or more direct action today, his hands would have been tied. Unlike the Congress high command that rules by diktat, the CPM central leadership cannot entirely ignore the three state units where political power is concentrated.

 The chief minister has been exploiting his public image of a hero to make it almost impossible for the party to unseat him.

 On Thursday, both leaders arrived in Delhi on the same flight but travelled to Kerala House in separate cars. Achuthanandans supporters shouted slogans against film star Mammooty, who is considered close to Vijayan and whose relatives and friends reportedly own plots in Munnar.

 At the politburo, Achuthanandan accused Vijayan of trying to push his loyalists out of party bodies. The meeting ended with a resolution referring to the feud and announcing the suspensions. These remarks and open criticism have violated the norms of the party and the clear directive of the politburo and the central committee, it said.

 Signs of the rot in the CPM may not make its allies too unhappy. Congress leaders will be hoping Karat and company will at last get off the high horse and stop bullying them.

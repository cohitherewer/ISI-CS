 After peoples car, a peoples bike

 - Calcutta firm to set up manufacturing unit at Chaygaon with China help

 OUR BUREAU

 Aug. 

 3: The two-wheeler version of the Tatas Rs 

 1-lakh car will soon roll out from Assam with a Calcutta-based 

 firm ready to set up a manufacturing unit at Chaygaon near 

 Guwahati in collaboration with a Chinese company. 

 To be sold under the brand name Rhino to give the bikes an Assam connection a 125cc bike will cost around Rs 25,000 while a 150cc bike will cost around Rs 28,000. 

 The firm will invest nearly Rs 100 crore in the manufacturing unit for which the Assam government has allotted a 50-acre plot of land the Industrial Growth Centre at Chaygaon. Industry minister Pradyut Bordoloi today confirmed the development and said a delegation of the Calcutta-based Ambica Iron Industries Pvt Ltd will visit Guwahati on Monday to seal the deal with Dispur. Saying the project was expected to give visibility to the industrialisation process in the state and also generate jobs for the local population, Bordoloi added, We are keen on seeing the deal through.

 Giving an insight into the project, Bordoloi said the venture would see 2.5 lakh units of motorcycles, besides 12,000 powertillers and 12,000 tractors a year. He said the firm is in the business of manufacturing components for the automobile markets for the past several years with the Tatas and Hindustan Motors on their client list. 

 The minister said the plot to be allotted to the project is one of the 15 they have cleared at the IGW, Chaygaon. It is spread over 400 bighas with its own boundary and water and power supply, an official said. 

 Manoj Chhawchharia, the MD of Ambica Iron Industries Pvt Limited, said chief minister Tarun Gogoi himself suggested the name Rhino, given its significance in the state, and to give the products a local feel. We hope to hit the roads by April next year. Powertillers and tractors will, however, be available by this year, Chhawchharia said. 

 Stating that the MoU was just a formality, Chhawchharia said though the company was keen on the Assam government having an equity stake in the company, we are not hankering on this issue. We want it as it would lend more credibility to the project. But if the state government does not agree, we will still go ahead. We are very positive. He added that the plot of land given to the company a month back could be the governments share in the project. The company is aiming to coincide the launch of the bike touted by the company as the peoples bike with the Tatas peoples car. 

 He said the industry minister has already seen the prototype developed by the company at its unit at Kharagpur during his visit to Calcutta last week. I was impressed by what they have created, Bordoloi said. 

 We are carrying out road tests on the prototypes, said Chhawchharia. The company is now procuring components for the bike from four Chinese companies. We are doing a mix and match of the components, Indian and Chinese both, to test the bikes cost effectiveness, pollution levels and road worthiness in Indian conditions. Once our R amp;D department gives the go ahead, we will select one of the companies for supplying us the components, he added.

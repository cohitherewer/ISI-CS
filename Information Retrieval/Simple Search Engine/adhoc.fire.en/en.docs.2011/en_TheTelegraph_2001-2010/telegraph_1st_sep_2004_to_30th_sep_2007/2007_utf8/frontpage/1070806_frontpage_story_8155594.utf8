 Women throw girls off train

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 5: Four schoolgirls were fighting for life in a Calcutta hospital tonight after they were thrown off a running train by a gang of women pickpockets.

 The Class VIII students returning from an athletics meet were tossed out of the ladies compartment near Belghoria station, 15km from Calcutta, in North 24-Parganas around 10pm. 

 Under the impact of the fall, the girls lost consciousness. They have suffered head injuries one girl has fractured an arm, too and have been rushed to RG Kar Hospital after first aid at a local hospital.

 The condition of two girls is said to be critical. At 12.30am two-and-a-half hours after the incident none of the four had regained consciousness.

 The four, students of Nandan Nagar Girls High School in Belghoria, have been identified as Dola Sarkar, Puja Das, Puja Das (two girls share a name by coincidence) and Rinku Dutta.

 The girls were on their way back from Ichhapur, where they went to participate in an athletics meet, on board the Sealdah-bound Shantipur local train. 

 Travelling in the ladies compartment, they reached Sodepur around 9.55 pm. The gang of pickpockets around eight women in their thirties then boarded the train and asked the passengers to hand over their belongings.

 When the girls refused to do so and protested, the women dragged them towards the door and pushed them off the train as it approached Belghoria station.

 Before other passengers only a handful were in the compartment as it was a Sunday could react, the gang jumped off the train that had entered the platform and escaped under the cover of darkness. 

 Alerted, a Government Railway Police team found the girls lying unconscious near the tracks. They were first taken to the nearby Sagar Dutta Hospital.

 With the help of some documents in the girls bags, their parents have been found and informed, police said.

 The police said many such gangs were active on the local train routes at night. They specialise in pickpocketing but turn to robbery when the circumstances are favourable.

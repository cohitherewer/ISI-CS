 - Wheeled gift gone wrong

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, July 26: It was perhaps a matter of gift exchange that went wrong. 

 Police and public alike were left puzzling today morning when a Fatuah contractor Neeraj Kumar usurped a vehicle that belonged to JD(U)s Fatuah MLC, Saryug Paswan. 

 Interestingly, the disputed Sumo Victa is registered in the name of Neeraj, who is not related to Paswan. The obvious reference (drawn by the police) thus was that the two share a cordial politician-contractor relation. 

 Today, like every other day, Paswans driver set off with the Sumo Victa at 7am from Paswans house to drop the MLCs grandson to a private school in Buddha Colony. Having done his duty the fellow returned to find Neeraj comfortably seated in the vehicle. 

 He was then apparently ordered to drive Neeraj to a residence of an MLC, Balmiki Singh, at flat number-185, R-Block. Again, Neeraj is not related to Singh, but they are said to be closely associated. 

 With his vehicle missing, Paswan later registered a case of extortion and possession by force against Neeraj and MLC Balmiki Singh. 

 Then, Paswan went ahead and accused Singh of provoking Neeraj to usurp the vehicle that the MLC s been using since its purchase in 2006.

 In his report, Paswan has added that the contractor had forcibly taken away the Sumo, as he had not awarded a Rs 25-lakh contract to Neeraj. The MLC conceded that the vehicle was indeed registered in Neerajs name, but he added that he was paying the monthly instalments for it.

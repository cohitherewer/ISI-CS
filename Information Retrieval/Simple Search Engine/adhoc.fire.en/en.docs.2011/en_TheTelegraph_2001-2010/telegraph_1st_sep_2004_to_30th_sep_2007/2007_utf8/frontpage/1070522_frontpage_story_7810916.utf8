 DGP stays away from court

 OUR BUREAU

 May 21: Orissa additional director-general of police (home guards) B.B. Moha- nti today didnt surrender before a sessions court in Rajasthan, fuelling speculation that he might be arrested by the police there.

 The police officer is facing charges of facilitating the jumping of parole by his son Bitihotra Mohanti, convicted of raping a German tourist last year.

 On Saturday, Supreme Court had refused to extend the stay on the arrest of Mohanti after it granted him relief for six weeks. The six-week relief on the arrest of the controversial police officer came to an end today.

 Though Mohanti was expected to surrender before a court in Jaipur today, as per the directions of the court, but the senior police officer was no where near the Pink City. Rather, he attended office in Cuttack. 

 Mohanti said he moved Rajasthan High Court today through a lawyer for a stay on the proceedings arising out of the FIR registered against him by the Rajasthan police at Lal Kothi police station. 

 Criminal cases were lodged against Mohanti on January 10 for alleged conspiracy in facilitating jumping of parole by his son Bihotra Mohanti. For several months, the police officer has been saying that he has no idea of where his son is. 

 Inspector-general of police, Jaipur, .P. Galhotra told The Telegraph that his department was weighing all options of arresting the Orissa police officer. I am yet to discuss the case with seniors. But the arrest option is surely open to us, he said over phone from Jaipur.

 The senior IPS officer had subsequently filed an anticipatory bail petition in Orissa High Court. He had also filed a petition challenging the FIR. 

 Mohanti, looking rather relaxed, said he has no problems in discussing his possible surrender or arrest. 

 I will wait for the outcome of the petition filed (before Rajasthan High Court), he said. 

 I dont feel the Rajasthan police has to issue an arrest warrant in view of the changed nature of the case after it has dropped section 130 of IPC (abetting a state prisoner or prisoner of war) from the charges registered against me.

 But Rajasthan government lawyer P.K. Parhi said: I dont have any knowledge that section 130 of IPC has been dropped. I have received no such instruction from Rajasthan police that the section has been dropped.

 Orissa home secretary T.K. Mishra said that he cant take any action against Mohanti unless he gets a directive from the courts. 

 Supreme Court directive will definitely be carried. But right now I dont want to speculate on the actions to be taken against the officer, he said.

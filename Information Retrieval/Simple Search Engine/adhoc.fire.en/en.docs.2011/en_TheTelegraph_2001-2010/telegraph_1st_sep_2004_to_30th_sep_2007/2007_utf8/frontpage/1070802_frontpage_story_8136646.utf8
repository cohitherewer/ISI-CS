 Proposal for jumbos dropped

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Aug. 1: Environmentalists are seeing red over the state governments latest move withdrawing two proposals for elephant reserves which where pending for notification, which they say is a massive conspiracy by the mining and industries lobbies.

 The Centre had already approved the proposals for South Orissa elephant reserve and the Baitarani elephant reserve. After keeping the file pending without any reason, the state has asked the Centre to drop these proposals. Proposals for increasing the area of existing elephant reserves have also been dropped.

 The South Orissa elephant reserve was proposed over an area of 4,216sqkm in Rayagada, Kandhmal and Kalahandi and the 10,516sqkm Baitarani elephant reserve would spread over Keonjhar, Sundargarh. Many of the mines and industries are coming up on elephant corridors.

 Sanctuary Asia editor Bittu Sahgal said the chief minister, who also holds the forest portfolio, is compromising the future of elephants. Naveen Patnaik is not mining ore, he is mining the future of the state. If elephants have no place to live, tomorrow the humans would have no place to live either, Sahgal said.

 Orissa has more than 90 per cent of the east India elephant population, including a good proportion of breeding adult tuskers, thereby making it a very important state for elephant conservation in the country.

 Interestingly state chief wildlife warden Suresh Mohanty has no idea why the proposal was withdrawn. I have no idea. Ask the top officials of the department. We had given the idea. They withdrew it, he said.

 Noted environmentalist and the secretary of Wildlife Society of Orissa, Biswajit Mohanty, said the states elephant population of 1,862 would be seriously threatened by this disastrous move as mega bauxite and iron ore mines and metal industries proposed in these areas would find it easy to obtain clearances without assessment of impacts on wild elephants.

 Instead of increasing the present protected area, which is only 4.2 per cent of the geographical area to at least 10 per cent, the sanctuaries are now under serious threat due to mining on the fringes. 

 Incidentally, the chief wildlife warden suddenly changed his own proposals without any reason for declaration of ecological sensitive areas that come within the 10km boundary of wildlife sanctuaries within two months of submission to the government according to the Wildlife Conservation Strategy, 2002.

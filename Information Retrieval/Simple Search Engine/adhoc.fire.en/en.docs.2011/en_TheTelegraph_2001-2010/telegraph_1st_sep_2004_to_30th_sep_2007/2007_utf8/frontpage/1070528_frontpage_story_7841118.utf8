 Sourav, the almost forgotten

 Sourav Ganguly almost returned as a loser despite Indias victory over Bangladesh on Sunday. 

 Sourav and Man-of-the-Match Zaheer Khan were standing with teammates for their medals, but L. Sivaramakrishnan, anchoring the ceremony, forgot to call them to the podium. 

 The local liaison officer, Waseem Khan, brought the gaffe to the anchors notice and he called out to the duo to collect their medals. 

 Sourav and Siva refused comment. Waseem said it might have been an oversight by the anchor.

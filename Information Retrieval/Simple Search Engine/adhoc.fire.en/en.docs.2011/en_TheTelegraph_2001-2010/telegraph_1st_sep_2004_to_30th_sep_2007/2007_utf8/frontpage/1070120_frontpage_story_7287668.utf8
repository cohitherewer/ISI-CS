 MP has to prove he is Indian

 New Delhi, Jan. 19: A member of Parliament has been asked to prove he is an Indian.

 Mani Kumar Subba, Congress MP from Assams Tezpur, has been many things to many people: a scam-tainted lottery baron, self-styled assasination target of party colleagues and even the owner of a Delhi farmhouse that threw up a corpse in 2004.

 But the one thing the apex court felt he may not be is an Indian citizen a must for contesting polls. How are you an Indian? How did you come to India? the chief justice asked today, directing Subba to produce documents to prove his place of birth and citizenship within six weeks.

 A PIL alleges Subba is a Nepalese citizen and had fled the country while serving a life sentence for murder.

 The court rapped the CBI for failing to solve the matter. The additional solicitor-general began saying we went to Interpol but was told: This is your problem. You go to Interpol and dont look at the ground situation here.

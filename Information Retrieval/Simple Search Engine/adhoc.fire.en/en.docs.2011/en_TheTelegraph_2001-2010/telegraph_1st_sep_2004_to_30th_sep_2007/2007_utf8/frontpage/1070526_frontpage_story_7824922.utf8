 Madam too lame, call us Sir

 - Women members of panchayat samiti want an expression of power amp; parity 

 SANTOSH SINGH

 Patna, May 25: Sir, to them, is not just a way to address male seniors but an expression of power and parity.

 The homemakers made elected as mukhiya, sarpanch and panchayat samiti members last May, are now trying to establish themselves in their position of power. Madam, to them, is too lame and does not sound anywhere close to Sir. Several panchayat representatives want to be addressed as Sir.

 At a recent public meeting at SK Memorial Hall, one Ramkali Devi, a mukhiya from Barh village, said: Hame Sir kaha jay (call us sir). Her demand was supported by over 2,000 women panchayat representatives gathered there to discuss womens empowerment. They also asked the people to stop calling their husbands mukhiya pati and sarpanch pati new coinages by way of derision.

 And the demands did not end here. Chandrawati Devi, mukhiya at a Piro village, said: Bhojpuri geet me hamni ke majal udawal jata (Bhojpuri songs deride newly elected panchayat members). Devi came to Patna last month and lodged a compliant with the Bihar State Women Commission against several Bhopuri singers, including Manoj Tiwari. 

 The chairperson of the commission said: It is heartening to note that village women are objecting to the offensive and derogatory references. As for demand for Sir, she said there was nothing wrong in it as it is about respecting chair, not person. 

 Though chief minister Nitish Kumar did not have to say anything on the Sir address, but at a Kishori Mahotsava function this March, he said: Women have been coming forward in a big way to realise their empowerment. My political Opponents wonder what I intended to do with 50 per cent reservation to them. The coming years will show what is my intention.

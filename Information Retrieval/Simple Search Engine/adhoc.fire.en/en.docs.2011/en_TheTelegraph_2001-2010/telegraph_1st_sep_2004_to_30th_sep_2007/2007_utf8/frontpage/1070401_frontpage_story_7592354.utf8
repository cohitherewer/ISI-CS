 IIM seat hike on hold

 OUR BUREAU 

 March 31: The Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, today shelved its seat hike plan because of the Supreme Court stay on the other backward classes quota, but went ahead with the proposed fee increase.

 There had been speculation that the IIMs, which had sought to raise intake to make room for OBC reservation, might still do that and admit more students under the general category and the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe quotas.

 But after a meeting of the institutes board of governors today, director Bakul Dholakia said: If there is no reservation, there will be no expansion.

 The if leaves room for the apex court vacating its interim stay by April 12, the deadline for the B-school to publish its final list of successful candidates, or the human resource development ministry sending a clear guideline to implement the quota, Dholakia explained.

 In Delhi, Union HRD minister Arjun Singh said the Centre would take all constitutional measures to get the court stay vacated. He said the government did not want a confrontation with the court, and added that the Prime Minister would call an all-party meeting after the Saarc summit to discuss the issue.

 IIM Ahmedabad had earlier planned to increase seats for its two-year MBA course from 250 to 280 this academic session. Of the 30 new seats, 17 were to be reserved for OBC students.

 The fee hikes were announced by the institutes new chairman, Vijaypat Singhania. The yearly fee for the MBA course has been raised from Rs 1.77 lakh to Rs 2 lakh.

 The fee for the PGPX (one-year programme for experienced executives) rises from Rs 8 lakh to Rs 10 lakh for the 2007-08 batch, and to Rs 14 lakh for subsequent batches.

 Singhania explained that the B-school spends about Rs 4 lakh on every postgraduate student per year. The hike is meant to recover 50 per cent of the cost from the student and subsidise the rest.

 Pupils pen peace plea over Posco

 Bhubaneswar, May 4 (PTI): In a fervent plea to prime minister and Orissa chief minister, thousands of school children in Orissas Jagatsinghpur district today said they wanted peaceful atmosphere to prevail in the wake of agitation launched against proposed project of Posco.

 We are not concerned with anti or pro-Posco movement. We just want peace to prevail in the area... We have every right to grow in peaceful atmosphere, said one of thousands such letters by Sasank Sarangi, a Class IX student of Dhinkia High School.

 The students letter campaign, sources said, came in the wake of mobilisation of police force at Kujang, some kilometre away from Poscos proposed steel plant site, as tension mounted in the nearby villages.

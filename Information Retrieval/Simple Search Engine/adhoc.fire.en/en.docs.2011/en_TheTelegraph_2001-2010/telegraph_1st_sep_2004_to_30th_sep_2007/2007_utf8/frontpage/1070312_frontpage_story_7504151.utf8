 Namdhari resigns

 OUR BUREAU

 Ranchi, March 11: Former Speaker and JD(U) MLA from Daltonganj Inder Singh Namdhari today tendered his resignation as the member of the Assembly.

 Though the resignation has been received, said Speaker Alamgir Alam, he would take some time before accepting it.

 Explaining the reason for the resignation, Namdhari said: I have tendered my resignation on moral grounds. I have decided to support the BJP candidate, instead of the JD(U) candidate, in the Palamau Lok Sabha byelection. Morally, it would have been difficult for me to campaign for the BJP being a JD(U) MLA. So I have tendered my resignation as an MLA.

 The former Speaker said with this move, he has also ceased to be a JD(U) member.

 Hereafter, I automatically cease to be a JD(U) member. However, if need be, I will give (the resignation) in writing to the JD (U) leadership as well, said Namdhari. 

 I am pained at the level of corruption in the state. Sacrifice by those who care for the state is the need of the hour. My resignation is a positive step in this direction, he added.

 The sudden turn of events has exposed the ongoing squabbles within the NDA coalition in the state. 

 Namdhari has not spelled out anything about the rumours that he would join the BJP, the party he had quit before joining the JD(U) a few years ago. Of late, said sources, the former Speaker was facing difficulties in his home turf because of Ajsu chief Sudesh Mahtos new political ventures. 

 A couple of months ago, when he was the Speaker, Namdhari had alleged that the then home minister, Mahto, was patronising criminals. 

 Now, political observers said, toppling the Koda government has become more difficult for the NDA.

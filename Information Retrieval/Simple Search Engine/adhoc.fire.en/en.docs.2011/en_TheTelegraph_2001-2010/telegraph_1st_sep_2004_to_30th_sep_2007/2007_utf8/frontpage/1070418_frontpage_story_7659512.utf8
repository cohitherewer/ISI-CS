 Insulted by cops, man hangs himself

 PRIYA ABRAHAM

 Bhubaneswar, April 17: Harassed and insulted by the police, Kailash Raul (45), a resident of Randa village near Berhampur, yesterday chose to hang himself and put an end to the humiliation. 

 Yet to recover from the shock and grief, Kailashs widow has filed a petition with the state human rights commission seeking action against the police officials responsible for the tragedy. 

 The unfortunate turn of events was triggered off by the visit of H.K. Tarai, the officer-in-charge of Golanthar police station to the Raul household on Sunday evening to enquire about Kailashs son Jitendra, who, along with three other youths, was allegedly involved in a group clash. 

 Earlier, too, Jitendra was involved in a ransacking case and was released from the Berhampur jail on bail after a three-month stint behind the bars. 

 Both Kailash and his son absent at their home, the inspector had asked Kailashs wife, Amulya, to send them to the police station when they returned. 

 Accordingly, Kailash visited the police station on Monday morning where he was reportedly insulted by the police. He apparently returned home hurt and broke into tears. 

 He wept bitterly and I had to console him saying everything would be alright, said Amulya to a private TV channel today. 

 He then locked himself in a room and when he refused to answer to the repeated knocks, Amulya called the neighbours and broke open the door. Kailash, who was found hanging inside, was rushed to the hospital, where he was declared brought dead. 

 The police recovered a suicide note from Kailashs pocket that read: Tarai babu has lodged a baseless case against my innocent son. I am deeply aggrieved. This has defamed our family. I was insulted at the police station. The cops laughed at me. After losing all my prestige, I have no reason to live. So, I am hanging myself. But, when asked, the police officer concerned today rubbished the allegations. I had never visited his residence. The allegations are baseless and its a conspiracy against me, Tarai told The Telegraph. 

 Amulya, meanwhile, in a letter to the SP, district collector and the state human rights commission has demanded a proper inquiry into the incident and appropriate action against the guilty. 

 We have received the letter and are looking into the matter. We have sought help from the handwriting experts to ascertain if the suicide note is genuine, said Berhampur SP Dayal Gangwar. 

 Civil rights activists have gone to town in protest against the incident. We are planning to send a fact finding team to the spot to ferret out the truth, said Pramodini Pradhan, a PUCL activist.

 Fine for Amar kid scorcher

 SINGH GYANANT KUMAR 

 New

 Delhi, June 7: If Amitabh

 is feeling the heat, so is good friend Amar.

 The

 National Human Rights Commission today asked the Uttar

 Pradesh government to pay Rs 5,000 each to 49 children

 who fainted while being made to wait in the sun to

 welcome Amar Singh and Jayaprada on Gandhi Jayanti

 in Kanpur in 2005.

 ldquo;Forcing children to sit in the scorching sun

 for six long hours is blatant violation of human rights

 and the state government should pay token relief to

 the affected to prevent recurrence, rdquo; the commission

 said. It also condemned the practice of using schoolchildren

 as ldquo;showpieces rdquo; during VIP visits. 

 Amar rsquo;s Samajwadi Party

 is no longer in power in Uttar Pradesh but the Mayavati

 government is expected to use the order to rub salt

 into his wounds.

 The

 commission noted that children, who should be handled

 with ldquo;care and affection rdquo;, had been made

 to wait without arrangements for first-aid or transport.

 By

 the time Amar and Jayaprada arrived mdash; they were

 late by three hours mdash; 49 children had fainted.

 Ranchi, Sept. 8: Khushboo Sharma reached where hardly a woman politician from Jharkhand ever ventured into. 

 Bagging the joint secretarys post in the Delhi University students union election today, Khushboo, a postgraduate student in Buddhism, earned pride for the state.

 Elated over her victory, Khushboo hailed the support extended by the students from Purvanchal. She also promised to make special efforts to make them comfortable to pursue their studies on the DU campus. I have been toiling hard for the last three years, she added.

 Hailing from Palamau, Khushboo completed her school education from DAV, Hehal. She graduated with honours in English from Satyavati College, Delhi, where she was the vice-president of the students union. She had worked as an air-hostess for a year in Air Sahara after her graduation. Hailing the victory, the state National Students of India hit the streets of Ranchi and burst crackers at Albert Ekka Chowk.

 Blast in Guwahati

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, Aug. 8: After showing it can plant bombs in front of police stations, Ulfa today struck close to the seat of power.

 Three persons were wounded when an improvised explosive device went off around 3.15pm at Nayanpur Path in Hengerabari, only 2km from the capital complex.

 Police suspect that the bomb was kept on one of the three rickshaws that were reduced to a mangled mass of wood and metal in the blast. Investigators zeroed in on the rickshaw with the registration number 3168 as the bomb carrier.

 The site of the blast is close to the public health engineering departments office in Hengerabari.

 Bhubaneswar, March 24: The deadlock over the removal of Orissa Assembly Speaker Maheswar Mohanty was resolved today with the Opposition-sponsored no-confidence motion withdrawn following request from the ruling BJD-BJP alliance.

 Deputy Speaker Prahlad Dora, who has been presiding over the House since last four days in absence of the Speaker, announced that the notice for the motion was withdrawn.

 The Opposition whip Satya Bhusan Sahu and a few other members submitted a notice on March 9 intending to move a removal motion against the Speaker had been submitted by. As per the rules of business of the Assembly, the discussion on the motion is to be taken up any day after 14 days i.e. from today.

 Before the Opposition pressed for the motion today, state parliamentary affairs minister Raghunath Mohanty appealed the Opposition to withdraw the notice to uphold the dignity of the Assembly and the office of the Speaker.

 Lets not create any precedent which the future generation will cite, said Mohanty.

 Responding to the request, Sahu said: We would not press for the discussion on the motion keeping in view the request of the minister and the fact that the Speaker had shown a good gesture by not presiding over the House till the disposal of removal of motion.

 The Opposition whip, however, said they expect the Speaker to remain above all the controversies, give protection to all members and uphold the democratic norms in the House.

 The Speaker had announced on March 22 that he would not preside over the House till the removal motion was not disposed of and had vacated his chair forthwith.

 There were hectic parleys before the minister made a formal appeal to the Opposition in the House. Parliamentary affairs minister Raghunath Mohanty and government chief whip Kishor Mohanty had met the Leader of Opposition, J.B. Patnaik, and other leaders yesterday and requested them not to press for the removal motion.

 The Congress Legislature Party met this morning before the Assembly sitting to discuss the matter and take a decision.

Several members from both the Opposition and treasury benches expressed their happiness over the resolution of the impasse in a dignified manner and thanked both the Opposition and ruling alliance.

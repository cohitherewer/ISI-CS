 Rummage through Tagore cupboard

 - Filmmakers glare falls on relationship between poet and grandfather 

 AMIT ROY

 Sanyal at Dwarkanaths tomb in London

 London, Aug. 5: After Gandhi My Father, which examines the fraught relationship between the Mahatma and his son Harilal, some of the hidden skeletons in the Tagore family may now receive equally searching cinematic examination. 

 Documentary filmmaker Aniruddho Sanyal revealed today that he was considering writing a screenplay on the reasons why Rabindranath Tagore showed scant respect for his grandfather, Dwarkanath Tagore. 

 Rabindranath did not know his grandfather but his mind was poisoned by his father, Debendranath, said Sanyal, who has just addressed the Nehru Centre in London on the dysfunctional aspects of the Tagore family. 

 Sanyal acknowledged he personally held Rabindranath in very high regard as a writer and poet, but I am not blind to certain strange aspects in his behaviour. I dont believe in deification of great people. 

 Sanyal pointed out that on his visits to the UK, Rabindranath, it seems, did not visit the tomb of Dwarkanath, who is buried in Kensal Green in northwest London until recently, the tomb was in a poor state. 

 In Rabindranaths writings, there are relatively few references, favourable or otherwise, to his grandfather, said Sanyal, who has made a documentary focusing on the moral and financial support given to Raja Ram Mohun Roy, one of the great men of India, by Dwarkanath, his principal benefactor.

 Whatever the shortcomings of the Gandhi family, Harilal did not badmouth the Mahatma to his children. According to Sanyal, Debendranath imparted to Rabindranath a somewhat unflattering picture of his grandfather. 

 Yet, said Sanyal, who is confident he has done his research carefully and is backed up by scholars, neither Rabindranath nor his father could have enjoyed the leisurely life they led without the wealth built up by Dwarkanath. He implied they should have been a lot more grateful. 

 Sanyal expects some sort of an attack from Rabindranath loyalists but said: Indians are now much more mature. A film like Gandhi My Father would have caused riots 10-20 years ago. 

 With economic success had come greater national confidence and a willingness to re-examine the lives of the sacred cows of yesteryear, he said. 

 Sanyals ambition is to set the record straight and demonstrate that although Dwarkanath was far from being a perfect human being, he was certainly not the immoral, carousing, spendthrift, wine-drinking and much too westernised character conjured up in Rabindranaths mind by his father.

 Sanyal studied at St Xaviers College in Calcutta before going for further studies to the US, where he has lived for 20 years. He now works in New York as a product manager for a software firm but his real passion has been uncovering aspects of Indian history even though he acknowledges he is not a professional historian.

 He has had great success in tracking down the death mask (a model of the face of a person who has just died) of Raja Ram Mohun Roy to a museum in Scotland a similar mask of Dwarkanath, who died in 1846, has been lost. 

 It is amazing how few Indians know that Ram Mohun Roy died in England, said Sanyal. Even fewer know that Dwarkanath Tagore, the grandfather of Indias much adulated poet Rabindranath and a pre-eminent entrepreneur of his time, met with a similar fate during a visit to England. 

 He added: It is a sad irony that having bankrolled the magnificent mausoleum to Ram Mohun Roy in Arnos Vale, Bristol, this all-weather friend of the great reformer was himself interred in a grave so plain and pedestrian that the casual visitor to the graveyard might have difficulty locating it. 

 As a consequence, he gets far fewer visitors than does Raja Ram Mohun Roy. Even more shocking is the realisation that his famous grandson, who visited London a number of times, almost surely never went to pay his respects to Dwarkanaths tomb or, if he did, chose to keep quiet about it curious in a man who wrote voluminously about all who mattered, including of course, Raja Ram Mohun Roy. 

 Sanyal posed the question: Why then have we very nearly forgotten these men? It seems Dwarkanaths slippage into oblivion was assisted in no small measure by his own family, especially his infinitely more famous grandson, Rabindranath. 

 Sanyals line is that Dwarkanath was a good and much misunderstood man, and that if he was the victim of character assassination, the guilty ones were his own son and grandson. 

 Asked if he was now prepared for a backlash, Sanyal told The Telegraph: I can stand the heat.

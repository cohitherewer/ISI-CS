 Mittal plant on smooth course

 SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA 

 Ranchi, April 26: There are no serious bottlenecks in executing its greenfield project in Jharkhand, declared Sanak Mishra and M.P. Singh of Mittal Steels India operations after calling on chief minister Madhu Koda here today.

 The company has already finalised the site in Jharkhand, claimed Singh but he refused to disclose the location. Before we do that we would like the pending sub-judice matters to be resolved, he said and claimed that land acquisition is not a major constraint.

 Reiterating that the company has always been in touch with the state government, both executives said that while it might take a little more time, the company is quite serious.

 Mishra claimed that the Orissa project and the Jharkhand project are two different proposals and they are not meant for bargaining with the respective state governments.

 Singh clarified that Mittal Steel had never demanded Chiria mines. It was offered by the Jharkhand government; the company is only interested in adequate reserves to meet its routine requirements, he added. 

 Koda claimed talks were encouraging and said he is hopeful of an out-of-court settlement on Chiria mines. The state government has also identified other iron ore reserves for supply to new units, he said.

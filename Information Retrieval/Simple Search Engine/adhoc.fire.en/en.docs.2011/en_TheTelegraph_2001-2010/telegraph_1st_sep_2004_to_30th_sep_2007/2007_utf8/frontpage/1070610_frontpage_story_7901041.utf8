 Calcutta connects soar

 ANUPAM SHESHANK

 Ranchi, June 9: Come Monday, and the Jharkhand capital will get its third daily flight to Calcutta. 

 For, MDLR Airlines, worlds first purely vegetarian airlines, has decided to extend the services of Chandigarh-Delhi-Ranchi flight up to the Bengal capital. 

 For the first three days, the airline would offer a promotional fare of Rs 1,000, inclusive of all taxes and surcharge, on the new route. Later, the fare would be around Rs 2,000. 

 Filling up the afternoon slot, MDLR will link Ranchi with Calcutta with its 70-seater four-jet engine AVRO RJ aircraft. The flight will leave Ranchi at 11.20am and reach Calcutta at 12.20pm. 

 The flight to Ranchi would take off from Calcutta at 1pm and reach the state capital at 2.20pm. 

 MDLR Airlines sales and marketing head Vinod Kumar told The Telegraph over telephone from Gurgaon that a demand existed for Ranchi-Calcutta flight and the response to this proposed service had been very positive. 

 Kumar is very happy with the response from the Jharkhand capital. 

 While the Ranchi-Delhi flight is doing well, the response to the Ranchi-Chandigarh flight overwhelmed Kumar. 

 When we launched our services in May from Ranchi, we focused on the Ranchi-Delhi sector. But we were surprised to see the number of passengers flying from Ranchi to Chandigarh. Many Jharkhand tourists also use this service to visit Shimla, he said, adding some travel companies had already come up with Ranchi-Shimla package tours.

 Seeing the potential of air travel in the region, the company is working on linking more cities with Ranchi, especially southern ones like Bangalore and Hyderabad. MDLR Airlines Services from Jamshedpur would also start soon, he said. 

 Additional coach

 Taking into count huge demand for tickets in Ranchi-Howrah Shatabdi Express, the South Eastern Railway has attached an additional (10th) coach to the train Shatabdi Express since May 30. The extra coach would be retained for the next three months. 

 Running six days a week (except Sunday), Shatabdi Express leaves Howrah at 6.10pm and arrives here at 1.10pm. The departure time of the train from here is 1.25pm. It reaches Howrah at 9.10pm.

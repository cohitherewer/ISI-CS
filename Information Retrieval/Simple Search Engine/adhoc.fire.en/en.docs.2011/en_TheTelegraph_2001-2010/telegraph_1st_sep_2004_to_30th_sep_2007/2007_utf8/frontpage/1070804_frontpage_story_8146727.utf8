 Namdhari: Finding friends

 Ranchi/Jamshedpur, Aug. 3: Former Speaker Inder Singh Namdhari is not averse to joining hands with Babulal Marandi for a better Jharkhand.

 In fact, sources close to Namdhari said Marandis decision to put up a candidate against him in the Daltonganj bypoll was not a hurdle.

 Marandi had called up Namdhari before the Lok Sabha bye-election in Palamau seeking his support. But it was not possible for him to forge any friendship with the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha since he was supporting the BJP, sources said.

 Namdhari, when contacted, refused to reveal the details of the talks he had with Marandi yesterday.

 I am brainstorming over his offer, he told The Telegraph.

 Namdhari, however, said the timing and outcome of the Jamshedpur bypoll is crucial for the state politics. So, Marandi is discharging his duty, he added.

 Marandi is desperately looking for a victory for his nominee Vikas Mukherjee and more for his political survival. He is trying to lure the disgruntled leaders in all the political parties. A couple of days back, he had offered Congress leader Roshan Lal Bhatia to join his outfit. Namdhari enjoys considerable support among the electorate in Jamshedpur and his support will certainly give an edge to Marandi to regain his political status.

 The bye-election process for the Jamshedpur Lok Sabha seat, meanwhile, gained momentum today with the lone candidate filing his nominations. Bireshwar Prasad Singh was the first to file his nomination from Shiv Sena on the first day of issue of notification.

 He, however, did not submit his affidavit and, therefore, was asked to do so by the last date of filing nominations. Deputy commissioner Nitin Madan Kulkarni said all preparations have been completed for the bye-election.

 The election will be held at 1197 booths. Out of them, 470 have been declared supersensitive while 393 are sensitive. All these booths fall under the Naxalite-affected areas, said Kulkarni, who is also the returning officer. He said election observes are yet to arrive. More than 6,000 government staff are directly involved, he added.

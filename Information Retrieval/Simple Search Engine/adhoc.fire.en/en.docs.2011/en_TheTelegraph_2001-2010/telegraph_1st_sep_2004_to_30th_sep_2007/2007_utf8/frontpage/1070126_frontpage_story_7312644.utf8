 Leash on liar fair

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Jan. 25: The 

 high court today slammed the brakes on preparations for 

 Book Fair 2007 on the Maidan, hauling up the organisers 

 for their blatant lie to get the armys 

 nod and state agencies for colluding in the deception.

 The matter will again come up for hearing on January 29, and the Publishers and Booksellers Guild hopes the court will allow it to get on with the work for the fair, scheduled to start the following day.

 In an earlier order, too, Calcutta High Court had stopped work related to the fair but tempered the ruling by saying that the guild could carry on with the preparations subject to approvals from the agencies concerned but at its own risk.

 Today, the court said: The guilds claim to the army (the Maidans custodian) that it had received permission from all relevant state government agencies before starting preparatory work in the Maidan was a blatant lie. The guild has deceived the army.

 In their interim order, Justices B. Bhattacharya and K.K. Prasad also expressed dissatisfaction with the way various state agencies had given clearance to the guild. The state government agencies, while giving the guild the no-objection certificates, did not follow the norms by giving instant clearances, they said.

 For instance, fire inspectors issued clearance without visiting the site and police gave the go-ahead without clearance from the public works department.

 The state pollution control board also came in for flak as the court said it had failed to perform its duty. It should have monitored the atmospheric condition of the Maidan during the earlier book fairs.

 The judges asked the pollution board to file a report on records it had collected over the last few years on levels of fine dust particles (RPM) in the air in the fair area. The board will have to file the report on January 29.

 Soon after the stop-work order came around 3.30 in the afternoon, guild officials rushed to Writers Buildings and briefed the chief minister.

 What advice could I give them? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee later said in the evening. Lets hope for the best.

 Guild ground secretary Sudhanshu Dey justified the instant clearances by saying: Since we have to hold the fair from January 30 onwards, we were obviously rushed and tried to obtain all clearances as soon as possible.

 While work on the superstructure is 90 per cent complete, decorating the stalls hasnt started yet and would take time, Dey added.

 Guild officials refused comment on whether the fair would be deferred by a few days. They said they were depending on the January 29 ruling.

 The judges said the guild had deceived the army to obtain a no objection from the force. Hence, we are modifying the interim order passed earlier and are restraining the guild from setting up stalls there until further orders.

 The ruling came on a petition 

 by advocate Sabyasachi Roy Chowdhury who had challenged 

 the way the guild got instant clearance from the government 

 agencies. State advocate-general Balai Ray and lawyers for 

 the guild tried but failed to get a favourable order.

 Fund hope to fight rebel menace

 RANJAN DASGUPTA

 Ranchi, June 1: Centre has made an allocation of Rs 50 crore for Jharkhand under the police modernisation programme in the current financial year. 

 The Union home ministry today held a discussion with the two senior state police officials additional director-general (modernisation) Jadish Raj and DIG (provisions) Satya Narayan Pradhan in New Delhi.

 The ministry will provide funds of about Rs 50 crore this fiscal. The two senior police officials have also provided a blueprint of the modernisation plan that they want to carry out with the Union government funds, said sources in the police department. 

 The Union government has been providing financial assistance to all the Naxalite-hit states every year to improve the police infrastructure, including communication, arms and vehicles. 

 During the last fiscal, the state received Rs 60 crore in two phases. 

 Apparently satisfied with the utilisation of the initial amount of Rs 40 crore, the Centre granted an additional amount of Rs 20 crore in the later part of the financial year.

 Sources said the Centre vigorously monitors the utilisation of the funds. There are physical verifications and the state police officials have to apprise the Union home ministry at regular intervals about the spending pattern.

 We are satisfied with the allocation made this year. If we are able to make proper use of the funds like last financial year, we are sure that Centre would grant us more in the later part of the fiscal, said a senior police official. 

 The thrust for the Jharkhand police, official sources said, would be to improve the state intelligence network and create a better infrastructure for the special branch wing of the state police to garner concrete information about rebels in a quick manner.

 The major portion of the Centres funds would be utilised for this work. There is an imperative need to improve the intelligence network to keep a track of the rebel activities, sources informed. 

 Another two areas where the funds would be utilised, include purchase of more arms and ammunitions and bullet-proof jackets for the jawans and strengthening of the police communication system.

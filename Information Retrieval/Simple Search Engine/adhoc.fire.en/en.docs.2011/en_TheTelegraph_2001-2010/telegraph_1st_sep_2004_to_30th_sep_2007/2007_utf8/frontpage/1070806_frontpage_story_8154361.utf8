 Waiting for political miracle

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ranchi, Aug. 5: After Inder Singh Namdhari and Anosh Ekka, JVM (P) chief Babulal Marandi is now eyeing on N.E. Horos support to work out viable alternatives in current power politics. 

 He also talked to old-time Jharkhand movement activists like Bimal Kachchhap and Suraj Singh Besra to give a new twist to state politics.

 After having realised his real 

 might during the recently concluded by-election for 

 Palamau Lok Sabha seat, the former chief minister is now 

 struggling hard to join hands with potential forces who 

 are ready to keep equal distances with both UPA and NDA. 

 Just two days ago he surprised all when he walked into Namdharis 

 Ranchi residence early in the morning and sought his help 

 to build a strong third force. Yesterday, he had a closed 

 door meeting with rural development minister Anosh Ekka 

 at a circuit house in Simdega and today he invited Jharkhand 

 Party chief N.E. Horo to his place for important discussions.

 A pioneer of Jharkhand movement, Horo is though no more able to walk or talk properly, he assured Marandi of supporting a third front to teach lessons to the UPA and NDA.

 In fact, small regional parties who though played crucial roles during the Jharkhand movement, but are marginalised in current politics, have been struggling hard since long to form a third front. 

 Apart from Horo, Kachchhap and Besra, B.P. Keshri and Shailendra Kumar Mahtha too participated in todays meeting with Marandi.

 It was unanimously agreed that a strong third political force in the state was real need of the hour. For this, it was necessary all political parties who name has the word Jharkhand should unite first. Once this being done, efforts will be made to join hands with other like-minded forces as well.

 Marandi said that his main aim now was to form a potential third front. For this, he was approaching all like-minded persons and political parties, who wanted to give a positive twist to Jharkhand politics. He claimed to have received positive assurances from different quarters and added that miraculous changes would take place soon.

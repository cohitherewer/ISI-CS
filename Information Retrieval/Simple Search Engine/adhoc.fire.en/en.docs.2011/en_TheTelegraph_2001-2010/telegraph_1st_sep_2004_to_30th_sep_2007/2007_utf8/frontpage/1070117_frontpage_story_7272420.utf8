 PM gets 

junta 

promise

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Dibrugarh, Jan. 16: Myanmar has promised to extend all possible help to Delhi in evicting militant groups of the Northeast from its territory if there is specific information about the presence of guerrilla camps on its soil.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told the media at Mohanbari Airport in Dibrugarh today that the offer of help from the junta came directly to him. Only yesterday (Monday), I had a talk with the premier of the Myanmarese government and apprised him about the situation which we are facing. He assured me of all possible help in uprooting terror camps in that country. 

 Singh said Ulfas violent ways had left Delhi with no option but to order a military offensive against the militant group. 

 I would like to make it very clear that there is no room for violence and it will not be tolerated. The army has already moved one full brigade to Upper Assam from elsewhere and we have already dispatched 30 companies of paramilitary forces to the state. We will provide all possible help to the state government to curb militant activities. 

 Chief minister Tarun Gogoi briefed the Prime Minister on the situation in Assam on his arrival at the airport .

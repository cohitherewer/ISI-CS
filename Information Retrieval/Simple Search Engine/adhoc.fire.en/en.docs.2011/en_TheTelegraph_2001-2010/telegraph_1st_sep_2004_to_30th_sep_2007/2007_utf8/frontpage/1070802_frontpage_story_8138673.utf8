 Minneapolis, Aug 1 (Reuters): During evening rush 

 hour on Wednesday, killing seven people and injuring dozens, 

 officials said.

 Cars were crushed under huge slabs of concrete, flipped onto their roofs or thrown in the river as the 40-year-old bridge, packed with vehicles in nose-to-tail commuter traffic, collapsed with a thunderous roar.

 The U.S. Department of Homeland Security in Washington said there was no indication of terrorism in the disaster.

 The 150 metre span of the steel and concrete bridge, which carried an eight-lane highway and was under repair, buckled and fell into the river and onto concrete embankments at about 6:05 p.m. CDT (2305 GMT). About 200,000 cars ply on the bridge everyday. The span had stood about 20 metres above the river.

 Minneapolis city officials said more than 60 people had been taken to local hospitals. Seven people were confirmed dead, but they said they expected that number to rise.

 The cause of the disaster was not yet known, state police said.

 The bridge, which was built in 1967, was inspected in 2005 and 2006 and the Minnesota Department of Transportation found no structural defects. Work was being done on the concrete surface, signs and guardrails.

 Rescue boats and divers searched the water on a hot evening as thunderstorms threatened the area.

 One yellow school bus carrying about 60 children had a narrow escape, remaining intact despite the destruction around it. All those on board were rescued, although 10 were taken to the hospital for treatment.

 A freight train was passing on a track running under the bridge when it collapsed, and the train was cut in two, WCCO television reported.

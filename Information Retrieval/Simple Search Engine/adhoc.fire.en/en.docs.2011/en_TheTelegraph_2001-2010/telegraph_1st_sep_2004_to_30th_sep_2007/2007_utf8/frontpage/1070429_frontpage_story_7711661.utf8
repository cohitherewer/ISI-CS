 Flunked on study front

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, April 28: Both Jharkhand and Orissa have been pulled up for being laggards by a parliamentary standing committee on human resource development.

 In a report presented to the Rajya Sabha on Friday, the committee, headed by Janardan Dwivedi, has expressed concern over the large number of districts in the two states without the sanctioned District Institutes of Education and Training (DIET)

 While six of the 12 such institutes are functional in Jharkhand, 13 out of the 30 sanctioned for Orissa have come up so far.

 Investigation by the committee has revealed that more than a fifth of teachers (22.44 per cent) in Jharkhand are appointed on contract. 

 The committee has stated that this aspect needs attention, as only teachers with job satisfaction can be ideal teachers.

 Jharkhand also takes a beating in training teachers under the 20-day in-service teacher training programme. About half the teachers (48 per cent) in the state have not undergone the training that is seen as a crucial factor for improving quality of teaching under SSA. 

 The standing committee has said the Mahila Samakhya programme is dogged by the problem of non-registration of MS societies in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. 

 As a result, this programme has shown under-utilisation of funds. Out of the Rs 140 crore allocated to the scheme for 20,380 villages in nine states, only Rs 77.15 crore could be spent.

 Ammo under sofa in Mushahary home

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Guwahati, July 18: Rajendra Mushahary, the former Assam minister who settled a rape case five years ago by marrying the complainant and accepting that he sired her son, is in trouble again for keeping 95 rounds of AK-47 ammunition in his home.

 A team of police and CRPF personnel raided Mushaharys private residence at Rukminigaon in Guwahati today on being tipped off abo-ut the ammunition and found the cache under a sofa. The former AGP legislator was in detention tonight and could be arrested, sources said.

 Evicted from the AGP after his wife Monila Brahma put him in the dock in 2000, Mushahary contested the Gossaigaon seat in the 2006 Assembly elections as a member of Prafulla Kumar Mahantas AGP (Pragatisheel).

 A police officer said it could not be immediately verified whether the former minister knew that AK-47 ammunition a favourite with militants was hidden in his home. We are not yet sure whether the ammunition was kept there (in a bag under the sofa) with his knowledge. He will definitely be arrested if his involvement is established.

 The police seized Mushaharys mobile phone and registered a case under the Arms Act at Dispur police station. 

 A source quoted him as saying during interrogation by the police that a visitor to his house may have left the ammunition there. 

 The police did not disclose the identity of the visitor. 

 On whether the ammunition was meant for any militant group, the source said nothing can be ruled out at this moment.

 Mushahary, in his late forties, was minister of state for welfare of plains tribes and backward classes in the last AGP government. He was a powerful politician until Monila came up with the rape allegation that led to a prolonged court drama. 

 Mushahary was arrested after a DNA test confirmed that he was the biological father of the child born to Monila. He accepted her as his wife in June 2002. 

 The former ministers tryst with infamy, however, continued. In 2005, he landed in jail for the second time for allegedly raping a 12-year-old domestic help. Another case was registered against him under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act after drugs were found in his Guwahati residence a couple of years ago.

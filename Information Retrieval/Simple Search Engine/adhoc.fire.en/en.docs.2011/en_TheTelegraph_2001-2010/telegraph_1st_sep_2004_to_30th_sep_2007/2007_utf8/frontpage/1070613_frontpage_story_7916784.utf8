 Hello, grandads army

Board recalls Borde

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 New Delhi, June 12: Last

 September, the genial Chandu Borde travelled to Kuala

 Lumpur with a one-point agenda: To get the Indian cricketers,

 who were in the Malaysian capital for a tri-series,

 to visit the Global Indian International School. 

 Much to his and the kids delight, senior pro Sachin Tendulkar took a small group there on an off-day. Borde is one of the schools trustees. 

 For the next two-and-a-half months, though, the players will be making requests. Borde, after all, has been appointed cricket manager for the June 20-September 9 tour of Ireland, Scotland and England.

 So, instead of celebrating his 73rd birthday (July 21) in Pune, the former India captain, selection committee chairman and manager is going to cut the cake in England.

 That the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) chose to pull him out of retirement is as surprising as Graham Fords decision to reject the Team India coachs job.

 Its another interim arrangement from an organisation which, within the fraternity, has become the laughing stock. All because of the clumsy manner in which it has gone about recruiting Greg Chappells successor.

That somebody who should really be taking things easy has been put in the firing line confirms the BCCI didnt have a Plan B when the seven-member special committee called Ford and John Emburey for the presentations.

 Bordes last managerial assignment had been all of 18 years ago, in Pakistan. 

 BCCI president Sharad Pawar suggested Bordes name during this afternoons working committee meeting. In keeping with Indian tradition, it was unanimously accepted.

 According to The Telegraphs sources, the process was set in motion when former president Raj Singh Dungarpur recommended Borde to Pawar.

 Borde said from Pune: It has come like a bolt from the blue. Im happy, but I wasnt expecting this. 

 He added: I havent received anything in writing, but (chief administrative officer) Prof. Ratnakar Shetty called. Ill be involving the seniors and working closely with the specialist coaches. Im for taking decisions collectively.

 Raj Singh was the only one present at todays meeting to label Fords U-turn very embarrassing. He also felt that the special committee, which offered the job to the South African, ought not to have gone public till Kents position was clear. Its bad. The episode has embarrassed the BCCI. The special committee should have waited for Ford to be released by Kent or taken his consent in writing. Our image has been affected.

 Raj Singh had ensured John Wrights smooth transfer from the same county in November 2000. Its a pity that Pawar and Co. didnt take advantage of his contacts in the UK.

 While suggesting Bordes name, Pawar informed the working committee (and the special invitees) that former captain Ravi Shastri had declined a second innings as interim cricket manager.

 Shastri was one of the special invitees. Another former captain, Sunil Gavaskar, as well. Both briefed the members about what unfolded during the presentations.

 According to a source, Shastri (who initiated the dialogue with Ford) disagreed with Raj Singh. Its no embarrassment when somebody goes back on his word.

 Spokesman N. Srinivasan took the same line: It happens in life.... With Ford, it wasnt if but when.

 Srinivasan, a member of the special committee, added that he and his colleagues would start a fresh hunt. At best, he was vague.

 Pawar, one understands, emphasised that nothing ought to be done in haste.The idea of putting out a global advertisement wasnt encouraged. The BCCI, clearly, doesnt believe in learning lessons.

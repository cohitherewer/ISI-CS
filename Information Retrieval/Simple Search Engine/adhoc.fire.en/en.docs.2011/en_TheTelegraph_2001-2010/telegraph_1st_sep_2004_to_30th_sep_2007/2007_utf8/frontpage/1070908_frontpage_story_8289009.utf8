 Stewart School

 Cuttack, Sept. 7: It has been a part of Cuttacks history and townscape for over a century. On November 20, Orissas Stewart School gears up to celebrate its 125th year. 

 The institution, where Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose received six years of elementary education, is marking the occasion by asking former students to come forth and to share memories of the alma mater. 

 Through this exercise, principal Asha Margaret Das hopes to accumulate an school information archive. On November 20, a five-day celebration with a host of programmes is also expected to start. 

 So far, the school has started a special unit to receive messages from former pupils. I am sure that former pupils from far and wide must have interesting anecdotes to share, she said.

 If you have any stories related to the old higher-secondary school or any other information, we would love to hear from you. We believe that its important for former pupils to realise they are a part of a rich historical past, Das said. It is one of the oldest schools in Cuttack and the few that are older are so by 10, maybe 25 years.

 The school, which started in 1882, was re-christened Stewart School in 1919 after its founder William Day Stewart, a civil surgeon. Stewart School began as the Orphanage School in November 1882. Soon, it came to be known as Protestant European School (in 1891) and in the same year its doors opened to Indian students. Since 1971, the institution has been managed by Diocese of Cuttack, Church of North India. Until that time it was under the Baptist Missionary Society.

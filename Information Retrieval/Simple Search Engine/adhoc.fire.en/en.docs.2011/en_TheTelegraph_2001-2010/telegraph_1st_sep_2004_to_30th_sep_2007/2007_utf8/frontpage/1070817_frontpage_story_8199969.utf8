 Tech schools spread wings

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ranchi, Aug. 16: The engineering education is set to spread its wing in the state. 

 While the chief minister would inaugurate the Deoghar extension centre of BIT, Mesra, on October 2, Dumka, Ramgarh and Chaibasa would have engineering colleges next year. 

 At a high-level meeting presided over by Koda today, it was decided to allocate Rs 10 crore to start the three engineering colleges. Foundation stones for these colleges were laid by the chief minister a couple of months ago. 

 The Deoghar extension centre of BIT is being operated from the Panchayati Raj Training Centre building in Jasidih. The government decided to allow the BIT to use the facility for another year. The new building in Deoghar is ready. I will inaugurate it on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti. First year classes will begin there. The BIT management is free to use the panchayati raj building for the time being, said Koda. 

 Expressing concern over the plight of higher education, particularly technical, in Santhal Pargana, Koda said efforts were being made to ensure that an engineering college was functional in Dumka next year. 

 I have asked the science and technology minister to ensure that the necessary formalities for starting the three engineering colleges are completed at the earliest, he said. 

 Now Santhal Pargana has found a place on the technical education map. We are also trying to set up medical colleges in the divisional headquarters.

 The vice-chancellor of BIT, Mesra, the chief secretary, development commissioner and the panchayati raj director attended the meeting.

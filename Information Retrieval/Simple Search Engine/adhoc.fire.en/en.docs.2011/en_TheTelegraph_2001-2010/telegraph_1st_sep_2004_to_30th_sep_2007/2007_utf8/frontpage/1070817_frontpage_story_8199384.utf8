 Bid to board plane with ammo lands man in cop net

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Aug. 16: A 48-year-old man was detained last night for allegedly trying to board a plane with ammunition. 

 The airport authorities nabbed Rajiv Dutt Mishra around 8.45pm yesterday and handed him over to Airfield police, who were interrogating him since then. 

 Mishra, who claimed to be associated with a Delhi-based firm, was detained after his suitcase was placed under the security scanner. The machine indicated that some objectionable objects were in the suitcase, following which the ammunition was seized from his possession. 

 Three 0.32mm cartridges and other accessories were seized from his baggage and sent for forensic tests. We want to confirm if they are live cartridges, said Utkal Das, the inspector in-charge of Airfield police station.

 The detained person said he had arrived in Keonjhar from Raipur by road on Saturday to seal a deal with some clients and had to board a flight to Delhi from Bhubaneswar last night. 

 As Mishra left Keonjhar, his nephew, Rajesh Goel, reportedly called him up and asked him to take a packet with him.

 Goel is the director of Delhi-based Alliance Metals Pvt. Ltd, where Mishra works as an adviser. 

 I picked it up and put it inside my suitcase without checking what was inside, claimed Mishra.

 After Mishra reached Bhubaneswar, he found the Indian flight to Delhi cancelled and decided to take an Air Deccan flight to Calcutta and then fly to Delhi. When he was trying to pass through the security zone, security personnel nabbed him. 

 This morning, however, the police received a courier from Delhi containing the photocopy of the licences of the items seized from the businessman. The documents were apparently sent by Goel and the police were examining if they were genuine. 

 We have decided to detain Mishra for another 24 hours for more interrogations, said the inspector. He would be charged under Section 25 of the Arms Act, said inspector Das.

 Investigating officer Niran- jan Behera said: The case is important in view of the Independence Day celebrations. Such a seizure raises questions on Mishras motive behind carrying the explosives.

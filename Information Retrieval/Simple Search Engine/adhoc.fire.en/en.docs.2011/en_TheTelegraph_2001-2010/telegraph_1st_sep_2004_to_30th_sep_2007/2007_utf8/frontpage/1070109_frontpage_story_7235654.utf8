 Nod for IAS property attach

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 8: The state government has given its sanction for attachment of properties of two senior IAS officers Vinod Kumar and Santosh Kumar Mishra who have been charged of amassing disproportionate assets.

 G.C. Nanda, the director of vigilance, said property attachment proceedings had been initiated against several persons. 

 Besides, the state vigilance department had sought the sanction of the government for attachment of properties of 52 corrupt officials, including Kumar and Mishra. The governments nod for attaching properties of the two senior IAS officers has already been obtained, he said.

 Kumar was arrested and lodged in Jharpada special jail here in connection with Rs 100-crore scam of the Orissa State Rural Housing Development Corporation (ORHDC), a state government undertaking. He was, however, recently released on bail following orders from the high court.

 Mishra, who is facing corruption charges, has been declared as officer without duty by the state government.

 The state vigilance department has so far filed chargesheets against eight IAS officers in 13 corruption cases and against six IPS officers in seven cases.

 The eight IAS officers include Santosh Kumar Mishra, R.C. Behera, B. Rout, A, Swain, M.M. Mohanty, S.K. Ray, Fani Bhusan Das and C.R. Pal. The IPS officers who face the trial are B. Rout, B. Jena, N.K. Parija, K.C. Mohapatra, N.C. Padhi and P.C. Mishra.

 Out of these 14 IAS and IPS officers chargesheeted so far, only two officers (Vinod Kumar and P.C. Mishra) were arrested while the 12 other IAS and IPS officers have not been arrested yet, vigilance sources said.

 So far, 1,898 criminal cases have been registered by the vigilance department against 479 grade I, 459 grade II, 1,335 grade III and 22 grade IV government employees on corruption charges during the past six years. These cases are under various stages of investigation, added the sources.

 At a meeting of chief vigilance officers of various departments and PSUs at the state secretariat today it was decided that the internal vigilance wings of various departments would be activated and corruption cases would be followed up in this year. 

 Orissa has secured the second position in registration of vigilance cases. On an average 300 vigilance cases are registered every year. Trap cases, which constitute 30 per cent of the total corruption cases, are proved to be more effective in which conviction rate is almost 100 per cent.

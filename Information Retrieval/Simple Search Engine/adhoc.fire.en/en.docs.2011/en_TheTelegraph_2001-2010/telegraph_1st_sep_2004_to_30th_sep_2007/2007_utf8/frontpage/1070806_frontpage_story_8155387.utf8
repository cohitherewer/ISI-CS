 Parents pick 

 holes in IIT list

 - Big difference between JEE cut-off and independent figures 

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

New 

 Delhi, Aug. 5: The Indian Institutes of Technology 

 violated their own stated admission procedures last year, 

 almost certainly at the cost of some deserving candidates, 

 research by the parents of some aggrieved students shows.

 The managers of the all-India Joint Entrance Examination 2006 selected students using a series of cut-off marks. But when a group of parents used the IITs own stated procedure to calculate the cut-off marks, the figures were drastically different from those actually used in the admission procedure.

 The IITs had set 48 as the cut-off mark in physics, 55 in chemistry and 37 in math in 2006, based on the performance of the two lakh-odd students who took the three tests.

 A fourth criterion an aggregate cut-off was then set at 154. This figure was based on the seats available 5,487 in the general category in the IITs and other institutes that admit students through the JEE.

 But when the parents calculated the individual subject cut-offs using the IITs stated statistical procedure, the figures they got were 26 for chemistry, 22 for physics and 24 for math.

 The parents calculations were based on the mark sheets of 32,000 of the better performers those who had cleared at least one of the subject cut-offs used by the IITs. The figures would be even lower and the discrepancy with the official cut-offs even wider if the mark sheets of all the two lakh candidates were taken into account, which the IITs were supposed to have done.

 The parents got the information relating to the mark sheets and the procedure for computing the subject cut-offs from the IITs themselves. They had to use the Right to Information Act to obtain these hundreds of pages of documents from the IITs, raising questions about JEE selections till 2005 when the legislation came into force.

 The Telegraph has verified the documents and independently calculated the cut-offs.

 If the new subject cut-offs are used even while keeping the aggregate cut-off unchanged at 154 the official list of successful candidates changes drastically.

 Consider these cases (the candidates real names and ranks have been withheld):

 Rachit scored 104 in physics, 75 in math and 52 in chemistry. But his total of 231, which is well over the aggregate cut-off, was of no use because his chemistry score was three short of the 55 required.

 Abhijit scored 50 in physics, 51 in math and 73 in chemistry. His total of 174 was above the aggregate cut-off but well below Rachits tally, but he made it to an IIT because he had scraped past each of the subject cut-offs used.

 Had the new cut-offs been used, both would have been eligible, with Rachit standing a better chance of getting a seat.

 The chairman of the Joint Implementation Committee (JIT) for JEE 2006, Virendra Kumar Tewari, told The Telegraph the correct cut-offs cannot be computed with the incomplete data made available to the parents. When told the data were sufficient, he didnt pursue the argument.

 These are baseless allegations, made by parents of children who could not qualify, said Tewari, a faculty member at IIT Kharagpur, which was in charge of conducting JEE 2006.

 Shishir Dube, who was IIT Kharagpur director at the time and headed the body that in 2005 set the procedures for JEE 2006, said: The IIT system is time-tested. There is no substance to these allegations.

 But he distanced himself from JEE 2006, saying the JIT was the final authority in setting cut-offs. Dube is now a faculty member at IIT Delhi.

 The current IIT Kharagpur director, Damodar Acharya, didnt wish to comment as the matter is sub judice. A parent has challenged the 2006 selections in Calcutta High Court.

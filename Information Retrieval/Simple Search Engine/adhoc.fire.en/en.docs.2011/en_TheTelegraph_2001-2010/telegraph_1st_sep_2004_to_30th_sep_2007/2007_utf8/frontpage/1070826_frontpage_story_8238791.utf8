 Aug. 25: Father Salim Khan has succeeded where the mother he created couldnt.

 The Bollywood scriptwriter last night persuaded his actor son Salman to fly to Jodhpur and give himself up before the law today.

 Go and face your fate like a man, he is believed to have said. You are a celebrity and avoiding the law will give you a bad image.

 The surrender didnt go to script: Salman running from the law since yesterday when a Jodhpur court upheld his five-year term for killing a chinkara was arrested at Jodhpur airport and put in jail.

 But the script had still outdone one that Salim had written in the 70s. In Deewar, mother Nirupa Roy tries in vain to get Amitabh Bachchan, playing a smuggler, to surrender to the police.

 Yesterday, Salim overruled Salmans lawyers who were devising ways to delay the jail trip.

 This morning, dressed in pristine white, Salman seemed to borrow his fathers words. I am a law-abiding citizen and therefore I am going to surrender, he told journalists outside his Bandra home.

 Standing behind him was the 72-year-old patriarch, flanked by his other two sons, Arbaaz and Sohail.

 As Salman left for the airport with younger brother Sohail, girlfriend Katrina Kaif and director David Dhawan, Arbaaz and Salim stepped back indoors to tend to Salmans heartbroken mother Salma. The last time the actor had gone to jail in April after his conviction she had to be taken to hospital.

 At Jodhpur airport, Salmans lawyers argued with the police saying he wanted to surrender, but the officers waved a court warrant and hauled the actor into a Gypsy.

 When Sohail broke down at the sight, Sallu tried to cheer him up, a family friend accompanying them said. He told Sohail, You go back to the hotel; Ill go to my five-star hotel, dont worry.

 Salman was produced before a magistrate, who rejected an oral appeal for bail. 

 Fans shouted their support as the actor walked into the jailhouse but Salman, whose eyes had turned misty, ignored them.

 His lawyers filed a revision plea 

 challenging the jail term before the Jodhpur bench of Rajasthan 

 High Court. A hearing is expected on Monday, when a bail 

 petition will be filed.

 Nilgai calf falls prey to flood in zoo

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jamshedpur, July 9: A four-month-old female nilgai calf died at the Tata Steel Zoological Park late last night.

 The zoo authorities confirmed the death of the calf and said that it was suffering from pneumonia. The incessant downpour, which resulted in flooding of the zoo a couple of days ago, caused its death.

 Nilgai (Boselaphus Tragocamelus Pallas) is the largest Asiatic antelope.

 The death of the calf one of the 12 staying at the zoo was the first such incident at the zoo. The calf, weighed about 20kg, was found lying at its cage this morning. Veterinary doctor and the zoos deputy director, Manik Palit, said the post-mortem report confirmed that the animal was suffering from pneumonia. The calf had fallen sick as flood water entered the zoo on July 6. It also could not feed milk for the last couple of days, he said.

 An overflowing nullah, connecting the Subernarekha, in the zoo inundated the crocodile and leopard enclosures too raising concern for four gharials and crocodiles. The reptiles are not taking food, said a zoo official.

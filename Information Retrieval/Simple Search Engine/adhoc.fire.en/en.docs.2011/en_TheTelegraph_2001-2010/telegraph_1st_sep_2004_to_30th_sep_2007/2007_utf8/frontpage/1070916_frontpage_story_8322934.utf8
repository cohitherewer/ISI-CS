 Imphal wheels back to life

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Imphal, Sept. 15: The Manipur capital wheeled back to life today after the Senapati District Students Association lifted its eight-day-long economic blockade along the Imphal-Kohima highway.

 Stranded supply trucks reached Imphal today after the students union suspended the blockade temporarily till Monday in view of the current flood situation in the state. 

 The students association had imposed the blockade to protest against the assault on some persons by troops of the India Reserve Battalion (IRB) at Senapati district headquarters on August 29.

 Police said the IRB personnel, who were escorting supply trucks, reacted when some persons threw stones at them.

 The students association, however, alleged that the personnel assaulted innocent bystanders under the influence of alcohol. The association is demanding termination of se-rvices of the guilty personnel. 

 A ministerial team that met a delegation of the students association in Senapati district headquarters on Thursday had appealed to the students to call off the agitation in view of the present situation. The team sought more time to probe the assault case and initiate action. 

 The students union warn-ed against reimposing the economic blockade if the Okram Ibobi Singh government failed to punish the guilty personnel.

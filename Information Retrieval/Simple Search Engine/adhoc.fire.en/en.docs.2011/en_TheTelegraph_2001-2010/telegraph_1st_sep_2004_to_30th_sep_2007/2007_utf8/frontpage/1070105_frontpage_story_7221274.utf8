 Go easy chant at Ramdev camp

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 4: Do as much as your body allows you to, new age yoga guru Ramdev (in picture) was heard saying here today morning.

 He also specified that heart patients should take special care, telling the audience repeatedly not to pressure their body for the exercise. 

 That is the difference the death of thirteen-year-old Manoj Das, while allegedly practising one of the breathing exercises in the yoga camp yesterday, has made to the camp.

 Manoj was cremated at the Satyanagar crematory yesterday evening. His parents and relatives, who had arrived here for the cremation wanted to meet the yoga guru. But we could not meet him. Manojs father is insistent on not going back without meeting Ramdev, said his cousin Gangadhar Behera.

 Purushottam Patra, an organiser of the event, said: Its a closed chapter now and that was an accident. No precautionary measures have been introduced.

 Meanwhile, policemen busy with security arrangements at Ramdevs camp had little time for any serious inquiry. 

 The post-mortem report is yet to arrive. We have been carrying out the necessary interrogations, said Gyana Mohapatra, the inspector-in-charge of Chandrashekharpur police station.

 On the second day of the camp, the crowd inflow at the Janata Maidan could be seen swelling as usual, though some patients were already aware of the mishap and others tipped off by their counterparts during consultation sessions. 

 I have been standing here for the last two hours. There are many more in front of me, said Bishwanath Hota, a retired forest officer from Kalahandi. Hota had been attacked by mild paralysis a year ago.

 More than 4,000 people attended the free consultation service today, though there were just 25 vaidyas (ayurvedic doctors) from Haridwar to prescribe medicines.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ranchi, May 14: MDLR Airlines today extended its Chandigarh-Delhi flight to Ranchi. The state capital can now boast of five flights to Delhi but the first to Chandigarh and also the first flight to the national capital in prime-time. All the other flights take off in the evening hours.

 But the MDLR flight, the 70-seater Avro, will take off from Chandigarh at 7.30 in the morning, landing here via Delhi three hours later. It will take off at 10.50 am and land in Delhi by Noon, claimed Kaustav M. Dhar, President (Commercial and Special Projects).

 The airline plans to connect Jamshedpur with Calcutta by this winter and also introduce flights from the state to some of the southern states by December, he asserted.

 The first vegetarian airline, he informed, will extend the flight to Calcutta in the first week of June. It also plans to operate the flight twice a day in the near future, he claimed. This flight will go up to Calcutta by June first week and we also plan to operate it twice daily from mid June. We are in the process of linking Ranchi with Jaipur from mid June and are also exploring the possiblities of giving connectivity to Surat, Mumbai and Goa via Delhi at the earliest, said Dhar. 

 A BIT (Mesra) alumnus of the 1991 batch, Dhar claimed that Ranchi was in their priority from the beginning and that the airlines has major plans for the state. Links with Jammu, north-eastern and southern states , he claimed, are on the cards. 

 The airlines that serves 10 different cuisines on board including French and Italian is offering promotional fare of Rs 1,000 for Ranchi-Delhi and Rs 1975 for Ranchi-Chandigarh (inclusive of all taxes) till May 26, but Dhar assured the fares will remain attractive even later.

 He said the fares will start from Rs 1,000 and will always be 15-20 per cent lower than other full services airlines like Indian and Air Sahara. Tickets till May 26 have been sold out, he claimed.

 The AVRO RJ aircraft, he pointed out, is very spacious and while there are 64 economy seats, business class seats are only six. 

 The four jet engine soundless aircraft flies at almost the same speed as Boeing and Air Bus and is very safe, he said. He added unlike other airlines, MDLR is committed to remaining a regional operator that will connect state capitals and metros. 

 Although it is a full-frills airlines, Dhar demanded fuel subsidy from the state government, which will help aviation industry prosper and prompt MDLR to launch more flights, he asserted.

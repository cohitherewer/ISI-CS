 NSCN-IM rulebook to set wrongs right

 - Outfit plays cop for Nagaland govt amp; people

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Kohima, 

 Aug. 25: Shopkeepers, Internet users, encroachers 

 and even the state government. Playing moral and social 

 police, the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) 

 excluded none from a set of dos and donts it issued 

 today, warning of serious consequences if the guidelines 

 were flouted.

 Claiming that state government vehicles were involved in illegal transportation of alcohol into the state from Assam, the NSCN (I-M) warned that if any such car was intercepted, its owner or officer-in-charge would be held responsible for the crime.

 In a circular issued by the central administrative officer, G. Tokishe Swu, the outfit also suggested to the business community in Dimapur, particularly meat and fish sellers, that electronic balances or table-stand balances be installed in their shops. It warned that anybody found cheating customers while using hand balances would be penalised.

 The outfit expressed concern over misuse of Internet cafes in and around Dimapur town by schoolchildren. The term misuse has been interpreted as surfing of pornographic sites. It said that if children or students up to the higher-secondary level were caught misusing cafes, the owner as well as the user would be severely punished. 

 The NSCN (I-M) also warned against illegal encroachments into places of historical importance, monuments, reserved forests and zoological parks, particularly Rangapahar. Several hectares of land in Rangapahar Zoological Park have been encroached upon by anti-social elements, despite repeated warnings and eviction drives by the government. Several hutments have now come up within the park.

 Rampant illegal encroachment is taking place; natural lakes, flora and fauna and their habitats should never be exposed to encroachment at any cost, the outfit said.

 The NSCN (I-M) also made it clear that all operations or commercial activities in this connection should first be subject to the interests of indigenous Nagas.

 Hence any Indian state agencies, individuals, corporate, firms or entrepreneurships are hereby forewarned to acknowledge strict ownership over what is under the ground, on and above the Lim, it said. Lim is the Naga word for land.

 The stand of the Government of the Peoples Republic of Nagalim is hereby once again made plain that ownership of the Lim of the indigenous or native people is defined beyond any argument, the outfit said.

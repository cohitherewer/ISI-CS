The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage

 In new draft, 

 a better deal

 - Indias silent nuke blast 

 K.P. NAYAR 

 Calcutta, Aug. 3: 

 Scorched-earth negotiations conducted by Indian officials 

 with the Bush administration have produced results that 

 were earlier only in the realm of fantasy for Delhi, a scrutiny 

 of the 123 Agreement has revealed.

 About the only thing in common between an original draft agreement submitted by the Americans for Indias approval in April 2006 and the final agreed version is that both texts run into 22 pages.

 During the intervening 15 months, it is now clear that Indian negotiators convinced their US counterparts to comprehensively jettison the prescriptive original draft, which was a long list of nos for India, aimed at crippling Delhis nuclear weapons programme and bringing the countrys strategic independence to heel.

 The original draft is in the possession of The Telegraph while the mutually acceptable final version was put up on official websites in New Delhi and Washington on Friday.

 During protracted negotiations, Indian officials pinned down their American counterparts into redefining the 123 Agreement in its entirety: as a result there is a new Article 4 in the agreed text.

 It says the sound and efficient administration of this agreement... should not be used to restrict trade. 

 This article, which runs completely counter to the tone and substance of the prescriptive draft of April last year, says India and the US recognise that reliability of supplies is essential to ensure smooth and uninterrupted operation of nuclear facilities and that industry in both the parties needs continuing reassurance that deliveries can be made on time in order to plan for the efficient operation of nuclear installations. 

 Similarly, the original American draft insisted that material transferred pursuant to this Agreement and material used in or produced through the use of material or equipment so transferred shall not be reprocessed unless the Parties (India and the US) agree.

 The latest version, however, says that within the territorial jurisdiction of either Party, enrichment up to 20 per cent in the isotope 235 of uranium transferred pursuant to this Agreement, as well as of uranium used in or produced through the use of equipment so transferred, may be carried out. 

 India insisted and got away with two major changes in the preamble to the agreement.

 One of these commits that cooperation under this Agreement is between two States possessing advanced nuclear technology, both Parties having the same benefits and advantages, both committed to preventing WMD proliferation.

 That is the nearest the Americans have so far come to recognising India as a nuclear weapons state and is a vast improvement over last years US text.

 The preamble to that text began by declaring that the 123 Agreement was being negotiated mindful of their (Indias and the USs) shared commitment to preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

 Such hardcore references to non-proliferation as the sheet anchor of the nuclear deal have been omitted from the new preamble.

 This is in line with Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs considered view that the Indo-US nuclear deal is about civilian nuclear energy.

 Senior US officials, including secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, have gone before the US Congress and insisted that the deal is about bringing India into the ambit of global non-proliferation.

 With the revised preamble, the US has been converted to Singhs view, which will be vital for support for the deal within the Nuclear Suppliers Group that controls global nuclear commerce.

 Compared to the harsh provisions in the original draft against future nuclear tests by India and similar issues, the article dealing with cessation of cooperation in the new text is extremely conciliatory.

 It says: If a Party seeking termination cites a violation of this Agreement as the reason for notice for seeking termination, the Parties shall consider whether the action was caused inadvertently or otherwise and whether the violation could be considered as material.

 After all the protracted negotiating effort, it is perhaps not surprising that the duration of the agreement has been revised to 40 years from the original 30 years.

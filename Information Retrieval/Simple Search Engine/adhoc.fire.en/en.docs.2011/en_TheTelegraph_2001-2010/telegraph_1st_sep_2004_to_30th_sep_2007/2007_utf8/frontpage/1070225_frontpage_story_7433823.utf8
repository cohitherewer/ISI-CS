 Charity starts at MLA home

 - After legislator, his better half to appear in board exam

 SASWATI MUKHERJEE

 Chaibasa, Feb. 24: Not many politicians believe in the adage charity begins at home, but Chakradharpur MLA Sukhram Oraon does. At least on the education front.

 While the legislator is keen on spreading education among the underprivileged, he believes women can earn respect only if they are enlightened. 

 Girls must be educated. This can help them earn the respect that they might otherwise be deprived of, said Oraon after coming out of SPG Mission Boys High School, his examination centre in Chaibasa.

 While the legislator himself is taking the matriculation examination this year, he wants his wife to appear in it in 2009 along with his daughter. 

 My wife will take the board examination with my daughter in 2009, said Oraon.

 Setting an example himself by appearing in the board examination, Sukhram wants his wards to excel in life by studying.

 He has ensured a bright future for all his children. The elder one is taking the matriculation examination this year itself. His other two sons and daughter study in a leading school in Ranchi. 

 Oraon is proud of his enterprising daughter, Suman. The Chakradharpur legislator is particularly impressed with her consistent academic performance. 

 She is sure to go very far in life, said Sukhram, adding that he has decided to give all his children a free hand in choosing their career. 

 I will never pressurise them doing what they do not want to do, said the legislator. 

 But everything said and done, he misses his children a lot. For, they do not visit his Chakradharpur home frequently, courtesy studies.

 Regaining his composure soon, Oraon reasoned his appearance in the matriculation examination saying that it would help him earn the respect that others in similar ranks enjoyed but he did not.

 This Chakradharpur legislator had been a patron of education for some time now. He felicitates six district toppers in the board examination each year. 

 When we hit upon the idea, the topper scored 37 per cent marks. But last years topper bagged 78 per cent marks, said a happy Oraon, who rewards the achievers with a computer and motorbike each year. 

 The girl students are gifted scooters under the Lattu Oraon Smarak Medhavi Chhatra Puraskar. 

 Currently, he is sponsoring the education of 10 destitute girls. They are staying at the Panchayat Bhawan, 100 feet away from Oraons house in Chakradharpur. 

 Moreover, four youngsters, including two boys and girls, are also staying with him for the sake of being educated. And all of them are being imparted education at the legislators initiative.

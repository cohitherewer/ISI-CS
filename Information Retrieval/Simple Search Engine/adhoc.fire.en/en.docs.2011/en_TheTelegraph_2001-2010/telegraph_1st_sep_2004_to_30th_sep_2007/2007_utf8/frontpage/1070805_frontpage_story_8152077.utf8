 How not to be dubbed a Haneef

 - A preventive check list for terror-stricken Indians abroad 

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

Aug. 

 4: Ever since Mohammed Haneef was detained in Australia, 

 Mohammed Sakibs busy Silicon Valley schedule has been 

 interrupted by worried calls all the way from Mumbais 

 Dombivilli.

 On each occasion, he is asked to be careful.

 Its an irritant. But I understand their feelings. The irony is, my family asking me to be careful could land me in trouble, the 27-year-old Google software professional laughed into the telephone.

 Sakib fears that someone listening in an allusion to authorities on the lookout for potential terrorists might just consider the use of the word careful suspicious.

 Behind the irony that Sakib speaks of is a genuine fear felt by many Indian students and professionals abroad.

 It isnt enough to be on the right side of the law any more. Now, we need to be seen to be the antithesis of what is perceived here as the stereotype of a terrorist, said Rahul Sharma, an Indian who teaches actuarial science at the University of Kent, UK.

 But how does one do that? he asks.

 Haneefs nemesis had been a SIM card the doctor from Bangalore gave his second cousin Sabeel Ahmed a suspect in the failed UK bombings a year ago. He was arrested on July 2 and charged with supporting terrorists. The charge was dropped, but not before the doctor had spent over three weeks in detention and had his visa taken away.

 Former Intelligence Bureau officer Malay Dhar believes that Indians studying or working abroad might do well to adopt certain habits and precautions that could help their cause. (See chart)

 If Haneefs only fault was that he had handed his SIM card unknowingly to terrorists, there are certainly some lessons to be learnt from this, he said.

 His first advice: condemn terror attacks, and ensure that others see you in the act of condemnation.

 Community groups that come out in condemnation of terror attacks are unlikely to be suspected as potential terrorists, he said.

 Mohammed Ilyas, a research scholar in environmental engineering at the University of Colorado, said that in his experience, those who mingled more with the local population got a better deal.

 Youve got to participate in as many public activities as you can, as a student or as a professional. Then the local population doesnt see you as an outsider, and the chances of your receiving a negative branding decrease.

 A retired Research and Analysis Wing officer, who did not want to be named, suggested being helpful to others. Also, be an extrovert. That helps.

 Sakib, however, laughed off all this advice and offered his own prescription. Its simple. Just dont share your belongings with anyone.

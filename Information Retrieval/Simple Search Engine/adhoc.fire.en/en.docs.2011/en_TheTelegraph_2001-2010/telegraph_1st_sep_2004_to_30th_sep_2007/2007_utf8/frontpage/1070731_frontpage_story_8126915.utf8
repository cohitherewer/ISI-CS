 Bhubaneswar, July 30: The doctor allegedly involved in the Nayagarh abortion muddle today surrendered before the Khurda superintendent of police, Amitabh Thakur.

 The states crime branch was looking for Sudhir Brahma, the tainted medico, since the shocking recovery of female foetuses from a well opposite to the Capital Hospital here on July 22.

 The other accused doctor, Sanjay Ray, is yet to be traced.

 Brahma, the senior gynaecologist and deputy chief medical officer of the hospital here, reached the superintendent of polices office this afternoon and surrendered before him. A visibly pale Brahma, sporting a T-shirt, hid his face from the cameras. 

 He had intimated us that he would be surrendering today. After he surrendered, we handed him over to the crime branch, said the Khurda superintendent of police. 

 After Brahma surrendered, Thakur informed the crime branch inspector-general B.K. Sharma about the development. He immediately rushed to the superintendent of polices office and whisked away Brahma to Nayagarh.

 We have some evidence regarding his alleged involvement in the abortions. We are examining different angles and if his involvement is ascertained, action would be taken against him, said Sharma.

 The crime branch inspector-general said Brahma might be arrested after more evidence is gathered. 

 On July 22, the macabre find at Nayagarh a pit covered with skulls and bones of what appeared to be of aborted female foetuses hinted at an organised nexus between police, administration and nursing homes.

 With the governments firm decision to not to spare anybody involved in the ghastly act, a joint team of crime branch and local police raided several nursing homes and clinics. Many doctors are absconding or are on leave since then. Besides Sanjay Ray, a doctor of Capital Hospital, four doctors of Nayagarh district headquarters hospital are still at large.

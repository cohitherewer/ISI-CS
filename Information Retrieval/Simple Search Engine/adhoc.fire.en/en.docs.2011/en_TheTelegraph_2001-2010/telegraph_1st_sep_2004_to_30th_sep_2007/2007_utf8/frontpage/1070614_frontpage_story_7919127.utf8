 Fake kill, probe plea

 SANTOSH SINGH

 Patna, June 13: Imposing allegation of fake encounter on Ranchi police, an Ara family has preserved the body of Dadan Kumar Ram for the past three days and sought the intervention of NHRC to lodge a case against the guilty.

 Dadan, a Dalit student who took this years civil services preliminary test, was killed in an encounter with Ranchi police last Thursday after a Rs 1.53cr bank robbery.

 Dadans elder brother Gorakhnath Ram, a sales tax officer recently transferred from Ranchi to Dumka, said: I will preserve my brothers body till an NHRC team arrives to see that Dadan was shot at point blank at his temple while he was asleep.

 Ram said that his brother was an upright student and didnt have any criminal record. He never had any bad company. We have applied chemicals on Dadans body and are waiting for an NHRC team to arrive, said an enraged Ram.

 Gorakhnath had faxed his application regarding police atrocity three days ago to NHRC in New Delhi. However, the family has not heard from the commission till this evening.

 Dadans elder sister Shashikala said: We want justice. My brother is gone but we do not want family long-earned honours go with him.

 The body of the Dalit boy, applied with turmeric paste and chemicals, is covered by marble plates outside Rams residence at Jawahar Tola in Ara. The family received the body on June 11.

 The family has also decided to seek legal opinion to file a writ petition in either the high court in Bihar or Jharkhand.

 Dadan, who graduated from a Ranchi college, was the youngest of his four brothers. 

 However, Ranchi senior police superintendent M.S. Bhatia denied killing Dadan in a fake encounter. He said the encounter was real and the police took action in self-defence. Gorakhnath is playing safe. Knowing well that he will have to explain the reason behind giving shelter to criminals in his government quarters, he has started taking action in his self-defence. Otherwise, how can he say so confident that his brother was not killed in an encounter when he was present at the spot? he said.

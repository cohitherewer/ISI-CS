 MP killers on police radar

 OUR BUREAU

 Ranchi/Jamshedpur, March 10: Director-general of police (DGP) J.B. Mahapatra claimed today that the police have resolved the Sunil Mahto murder case even as two Intelligence Bureau officials started an independent investigation into the assassination of the MP.

 Revealing the news of the success, the DGP conceded that the police were yet to establish the motive behind the murder. 

 He also refused to divulge the details of the case citing that the police team had been working on various theories. We will reveal minute details in the next couple of days, Mahapatra said. 

 Sources in the East Singhbhum police said the motive behind the killing can be established only after the police get hold of a Maoist involved in the murder of the MP. 

 East Singhbhum superintendent of police Pankaj Darad trashed the widely believed notion that the gory incident was video recorded. The pictures of the match were clicked using a camera of Jarpa Sporting Club, the organiser of the football match, he said.

 The SP also clarified that 10 persons of Baguria village had been detained and not arrested for interrogation. The detainees include the village chief, Dasman Soren, the president of Jarpa Sporting Club as well as the chairman of the organising committee of the match, Sonaram Soren, and Sudhir Soren, who allegedly provided food and shelter to the Maoists before the killing. 

 We are gradually zeroing in on the real culprit, he said. 

 The police are also interrogating the family members of Prabhakar Mahto, the JMM leader killed along with the MP.

 Meanwhile, an Intelligence Bureau officer in the rank of assistant director arrived in Jamshedpur this morning with another official from Delhi and visited the spot of the murder.

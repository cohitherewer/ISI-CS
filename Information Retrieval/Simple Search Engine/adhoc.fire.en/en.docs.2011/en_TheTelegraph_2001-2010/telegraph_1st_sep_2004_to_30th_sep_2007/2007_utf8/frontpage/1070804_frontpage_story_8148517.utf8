 New Delhi, Aug. 3: 

 Maanyata, let Sanjay be for now. 

 Sanjay Dutts friends and family who repeatedly call on him and chase his caravan to lift his spirits will only worsen his trauma, psychiatrists have said. 

 The actors earlier 16-month stint in jail is also likely to exacerbate the pain, according to the psychiatrists, including one who has gained deep insights into what goes on in the minds of new prisoners. 

 The emotional response to the prospect of a long jail sentence is usually quite different among convicted celebrities and VIPs, they said.

 The disorientation and trauma is far worse. Self-esteem takes a nosedive, said Rajat Mitra, a consultant psychiatrist in New Delhi, who is often called by officials at Tihar Jail to help VIPs come to terms with life behind bars. 

 Weve noticed that after one-to-one sessions with family members, celebrities or VIPs appear a lot more devastated than other convicts, Mitra said. The process of repeated separations can be extremely distressing. People should support a person in prison from outside.

 The way to help him adapt is to let him be for now, he said.

 Last night, Maanyata, Sanjays girlfriend, and several cheering supporters had followed the van that took the actor from Mumbais Arthur Road Jail to Punes Yerwada. However, realising that she could be of little help, a reluctant and tearful Maanyata returned to Sanjays Pali Hill home early this morning.

 The perceived fall is much harder to stomach, said Vivek Benegal, a psychiatrist at Bangalores National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences. Particularly among people for whom public perception is very important.

 Benegal said the initial trauma that Sanjay is likely to experience during the second stay could be much worse than the first term. 

 A process called sensitisation allows the human mind to retain memories of an experience. When it happens again, it is perceived as much worse and the trauma experienced may be magnified.

 Mitra believes that Sanjays distress is also likely to be more intense now because he appeared to have counted on his good behaviour to bail him out. Dutt had been involved in socially relevant films Munnabhai and become a good citizen. He believes that he didnt deserve such a punishment.

 Doctors also feel that its much harder for older individuals to face jail terms. In middle age, a person has usually developed roots and bonds that are much stronger than at a younger age. 

 Anecdotal evidence also suggests that adaptation to life in prison takes longer for celebrities and VIPs than for other convicts. An ordinary first-time prisoner may take anywhere from two weeks to three weeks to get used to being locked up, but it could take up to three months for VIP prisoners, Mitra said. The scope for studies is limited because of the lack of large numbers of VIP prisoners.

 Doctors familiar with prison practices said celebrity and VIP convicts also dont mix too much with other prisoners.

 Prison officials also prefer it that way, a doctor said. These are people who tend to ask questions, demand rights, and arent as subservient as the other prisoners. Officials usually dont want that kind of attitude to infect the other inmates.

 Army scraps career cell

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, May 21: The armed forces have disbanded a cell that was working with the defence ministry to deal with disputes on careers of senior officers. This signals a rift between the defence ministry and the services headquarters on promotions of general-rank officers.

 The decision to disband the Armed Forces Tribunal Cell was executed on May 1 in a move that was not publicised. It was ordered by Gen. Joginder Jaswant Singh immediately after taking over as the chairman, chiefs of staff committee. The general is the seniormost of the three services chiefs.

 As the chief interface between the services and the ministry, the disbanded cell would have been tasked to create the armed forces tribunal and implement its rules. It was staffed by the adjutant-general and was to be expanded with more members.

 The disbanding follows questions posed by the bureaucracy in the defence ministry on inconsistencies in the armys promotion policies. The army was asked to explain why it was recommending that two tainted generals be moved to more prestigious appointments even after they were censured. The defence ministry had turned down the armys recommendations.

 Lt Gen. S.K. Dahiya was named in lists of officers who were being investigated on charges of corruption. The lists were included in replies that defence minister A.K. Antony gave in Parliament in November 2006 and March this year. Gen. Dahiya was indicted for irregularities in operation of frozen meat contracts. 

 The northern command chief awarded recordable censure to the general officer, despite the fact that army headquarters has recommended that Dahiya be moved up as director-general, supplies and transport. He is currently commandant of the Bangalore-based Army Supply Corps College.

 Another censure was awarded to Maj. Gen. Lumba. An internal inquiry found a swimming pool was built in his Hissar division instead of a water tank. The tank was to be built near an ammunition dump. But army headquarters has recommended that he be promoted and take over as the general officer commanding the 21 (strike) Corps headquartered in Bhopal. 

 He is currently with the Army War College, Mhow.

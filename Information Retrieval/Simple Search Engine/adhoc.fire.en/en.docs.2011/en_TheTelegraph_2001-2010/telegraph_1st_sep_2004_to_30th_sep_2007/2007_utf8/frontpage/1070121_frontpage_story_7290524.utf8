 Comeback grit amp; guts on trial

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Jan. 20: The debonair Yuvraj Singh, once seen as Sourav Gangulys boy, had barely landed in Calcutta last evening when a petite assistant manager of a private carrier welcomed him and, then, began going gaga over the former Team India captains determination.

 What determination! Just look at Sourav. A comeback even in the one-dayers, she said passionately. Yuvraj, working towards a comeback of his own after a terrible injury, nodded in agreement: Absolutely, thats determination.

 Indeed, that alone has taken Sourav to Nagpur, where the first ODI versus the West Indies gets under way tomorrow. His last appearance in that form of the game was in Harare, more than 16 months ago.

 Mohinder Amarnath got labelled Indias comeback man, but Souravs has been extraordinary. He believes sport is different from fairy tales, but his return fits that category.

 Plus Souravs going to open (with Gautam Gambhir and with a heavier bat than in South Africa), a slot hed vacated in the teams interest when every word of his was a command.

 Frankly, even the most sycophantic of scriptwriters couldnt have visualised such a comeback when, nine months ago, the Greg Chappell-Rahul Dravid combination was toasting a record 17 successive wins batting second.

 Few remembered that the first two in that sequence had actually begun at the fag end of Souravs captaincy. 

 Brian Lara is convinced Sourav wont take time to settle down. Thats a handsome compliment, but one expects somebody with Souravs credentials (279 ODIs, 10,123 runs, 22x100) to be up for it from ball one.

 Its debatable whether even a 30-hour day would be enough for Sourav to meet the demands when in Calcutta, but he took time off (before heading for Nagpur) to speak at length to The Telegraph.

 He was emotional.

 During the interaction, he confessed to feeling lonely when Dravids men hammered Pakistan in the Karachi ODI last February to take that series with an awesome 4-1 margin. He talked about having missed the challenge of competing against the best.

 The revelation came in the manner Sourav handled the question on former coach John Wrights book, Indian Summers. He has said the truth. As an individual, hes entitled to an opinion and I have to respect it.

 The one-time partners, perhaps, will hug each other should they meet (as is likely) in the World Cup. One as a player, the other in his latest avatar that of a commentator on TV.

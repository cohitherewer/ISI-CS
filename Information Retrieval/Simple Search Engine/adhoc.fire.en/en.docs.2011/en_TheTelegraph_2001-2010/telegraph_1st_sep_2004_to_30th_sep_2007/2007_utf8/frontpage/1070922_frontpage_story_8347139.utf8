The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage

 Out of hospital, with eye on task

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Guwahati, Sept. 21: Undeterred by the mild cerebral stroke that sent her to hospital nine days ago, Mamoni Raisom Goswami today said there was no question of giving up her efforts to restore peace in Assam. 

 She told the media before being released from the GNRC Hospitals this afternoon that her prime responsibility was to get Ulfa and Delhi to the negotiating table. 

 The writer said she would convene a meeting of the Peoples Consultative Group, formed by Ulfa to do the spadework for talks, at her residence after resting for some time.

 Doctors have advised her complete rest for a couple of weeks. 

 The chairman and managing director of GNRC Hospitals, Dr N.C. Borah, said doctors were satisfied with Goswamis recovery from a cerebral stroke but she needed more rest to be completely healthy. 

 We have advised her not to travel for some time. There will also be restrictions on the number of visitors to her home. It will be good for her to answer only a few telephone calls everyday. The hospital is confident that she will totally recover if she follows the restrictions, he said. 

 The neurologist also advised the writer not to stress herself for the sake of breaking the deadlock between Delhi and Ulfa. 

 In an interview with The Telegraph at the hospital last week, Goswami had admitted to being overly worried about the fate of the peace process. 

 I am still very hopeful about the peace talks. There is no reason why peace cannot return to Assam. Look at Mizoram... how peaceful the state is today. We have to make a little bit of sacrifice to bring back peace. Paresh Barua (the Ulfa commander-in-chief) called up one of the members of PCG during my stay in hospital and asked about my condition. I believe Barua will take the initiative to start peace talks, she said. 

 Goswami, 65, has long been trying to bring Ulfa to the negotiating table by mediating between it and Delhi. On different occasions, she has accused the central and state governments of not being sincere about breaking the deadlock.

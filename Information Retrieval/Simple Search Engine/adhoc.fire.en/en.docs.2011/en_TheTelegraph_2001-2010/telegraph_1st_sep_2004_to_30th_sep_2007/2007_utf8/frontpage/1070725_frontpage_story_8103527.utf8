 Master meets but misses magician

 - When Potter actor queued for autograph, Sachin was lost in sign spree 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sachin: Next time, look up

 Nottingham,

 July 24: Sachin Tendulkar managed no more than 37 and 16 in the Lords Test, almost surely his last there, but that didnt stop the much-in-the-news Daniel Radcliffe from queuing up for his autograph last evening.

 Had daughter Sara or son Arjun been around, they would surely have drawn his attention to Radcliffes presence in the queue, behind the dressing room.

 They werent and so, despite the Pottermania, Sachin obliged the actor without realising who he was.

 Its after youve asked me that Ive checked with (Team India physio) John Gloster, who was there at that time. Well, he has now confirmed that Radcliffe had indeed been in the queue, a bemused Sachin told The Telegraph.

 Speaking shortly after arriving here in the afternoon, Sachin added: When there are that many autographs to sign, one keeps obliging without looking up.... Unless, of course, somebody says something.... Obviously, he (Radcliffe) didnt say anything.

 Next time, perhaps, Sachin may look up once in a while. Just in case....

 Radcliffe had turned up at Lords on a day he had turned 18, according to a PTI report.

 Daniel:

 Next

 time,

 speak

 up

 Himself a target of autograph hunters, the actor admitted he queued with other fans to get signatures from Sachin and England opener Andrew Strauss.

 Radcliffe had recently spoken about a nightmare where the opener stalked him. 

 I was telling people in a recent interview that I had a dream that Strauss was chasing me with a cricket bat. It was during the West Indies series when Andrew wasnt doing too well and an Australian who was listening in piped up and said I wouldnt worry about Strauss, if he had a swing at you at the moment hed probably miss! 

 Strauss obliged Radcliffe with an autograph and got a Harry Potter book signed by the actor for his child.

 Palamau, July 8: The Tritya Prastuti Committee (TPC), a breakaway faction of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), claims that it has expanded its organisation across Jharkhand.

 The Tritya Prastuti Committee also revealed that it has established units in each of the 22 districts. Each district has been divided into three sub zones and each sub zonal commanders have been entrusted to groom and train the Tritya Prastuti Committee cadres.

 Formed way back in 2002, the area of operations of the Tritya Prastuti Committee so far was restricted in districts like Latehar, Garwah, Palamau and Chatra. And with expansion of the organisation, there are apprehensions that bloody clashes between Tritya Prastuti Committee and Communist Party of India (Maoist) would escalate.

 Our main enemy is not the police machinery, but the CPI(Maoist). They have diverted from their original principle and are involved in petty activities. And to successfully wage armed struggle against the Maoists, there is an imperative need to strengthen our own organisation. The results of our expansion would give us positive results in near future, claimed one of the sub zonal commanders of Palamau, Giriji.

 The other two sub zonal commanders of Palamau are Promodji and Prashantji.

 In an exclusive interview to this correspondent at the forest area of Patan block of Palamau, the sub zonal commander claimed that the strength of Tritya Prastuti Committee is swelling as disillusioned Maoist cadres are joining the outfit.

 When this correspondent reached the forest area, a group of 40 Tritya Prastuti Committee cadres in army attire and aged between 15 and 40 years were being imparted armed training under the watchful eyes of Giriji. 

 The cadres were trained how to aim and shoot the enemies, how to take vantage positions while being attacked from enemies, movements after dusk etc. 

 The arms consisted of pistols and guns.

 Such training, the Tritya Prastuti Committee leader claimed, take place at different parts of the state under the supervision of the local sub zonal commanders.

 But the leaders were not ready to reveal much about the chief commander of the organisation who is known as Sardarji.

 Spewing venom against the Maoists, Tritya Prastuti Committee leaders accused them of collecting levy for their own vested reasons. And their activities have brought all development work in the state to a grinding halt.

 We, too, shall collect levy from contractors, admitted Giriji, as we need funds for the organisation. But we shall not demand hefty levy from contractors that could prevent them from carrying on with the construction, said Giriji.

 The TPC leader was critical of the Maoists for targeting the family members of their cadres and killing them.

 But such acts of the Maoists would not in any way weaken our outfit. Rather, it would make our cadres mentally stronger to take on our enemies with more vengeance, declared Giriji.

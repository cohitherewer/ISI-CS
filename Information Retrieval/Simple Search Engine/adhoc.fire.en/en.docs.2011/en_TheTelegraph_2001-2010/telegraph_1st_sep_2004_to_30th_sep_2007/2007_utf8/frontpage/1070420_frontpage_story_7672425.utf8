 Mumbai, April 19: Prateeksha, Jalsa now add Naivedya to the Bachchan bungalow list.

 Only, this time it may just be Mr and Mrs Chhota B living there with a certain Salman Khan as neighbour.

 Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai, sources say, are not going to live with Amitabh and Jaya. They may stay on at Jalsa for a while after Fridays wedding but chances are that in a couple of months, they will move to Naivedya, a sea-facing, four-storey bungalow on Carter Road.

 The construction of the apartment-shaped bungalow, which reputedly has a huge rooftop swimming pool, at the Bandra address of 85 Carter Road began three years ago.

 According to Anil Goel, who stays just off Carter Road, there has been a rapid increase in the pace of work since last December and the building has been hastily renamed from Nirvana to Naivedya.

 Sources say the new name is derived from Navya Naveli and Agastya, the children of Amitabhs daughter Shweta Nanda.

 Nirvana was meant to be Big Bs gift to Abhishek and his former fiancee Karisma Kapoor. A plywood piece still hangs as a reminder of the old nameplate.

 A little distance away, the memories of another ex-flame may lurk. Just three blocks from Naivedya, a new bungalow-cum-apartment is coming up on Carter Road, which belongs to the Khan who once stole Ashs heart.

 The guards and the gatekeeper at Naivedya, of course, would not reveal whether AbAsh will be moving in. They did let on, though, that the owner of Naivedya is related to the Bachchans.

 But the neighbours have more to say. Amitabh Bachchanji aaye the jab is building pe kaam shuru hua tha (When work started on the building, Amitabh did pay a visit), said Merram Razza, who owns a stall nearby.

 Khub zoron sa kaam chal raha kuch dinon se. Abhi finishing touches de rahein hai (The work picked up pace sometime ago. Now they are lending the finishing touches).

 Once the official wedding reception and the honeymoon, being planned for June, are over, the housewarming may not be too far off.

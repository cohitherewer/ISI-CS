 Murder plot to avenge marriage

 OUR BUREAU

 Raipur/Patna, July 27: A woman legislator of Bihar Assembly has allegedly hired contract killers to eliminate her former personal assistant for eloping with her daughter and marrying her in Chhattisgarh. 

 Anshu Rai, the daughter of Saharanpur (Bihar) legislator Kalavaty Rai, fled with Rajiv Ranjan on June 23. 

 The duo reached Chhattisgarh and tied nuptial knot on June 28. 

 When Anshu informed her mother about marrying Ranjan, a personal assistant of the legislator, over telephone, the Bihar legislator refused to accept Ranjan as son-in-law and threatened to eliminate both. 

 The couple, in the Chhattisgarh capital at present, is passing their days suffering from an uncanny fear. When the duo emerged in a commercial complex last evening, a police team tried to detain Ranjan following alleged pressure from the MLA. 

 The police did not have the warrant and so the couple opposed the police action. Luckily, a section of media persons also reached there on time and foiled the move of the police, an eyewitness told The Telegraph. 

 The Bihar legislator strongly denied that she had planned to hire criminals to eliminate her secretary and her daughter, but claimed it to be a case of abduction rather than the consent between two adults to live together.

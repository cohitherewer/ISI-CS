 Varsity offer for BPL students

 AMIT GUPTA

 Ranchi, Sept. 10: Ranchi University will offer free education and stipend to two students from below poverty line families in postgraduate studies while toppers of all 23 PG departments will be offered temporary jobs for one year so as to develop their teaching skills.

 A syndicate meeting under the chairmanship of vice-chancellor A.A. Khan took the decision. Other important decisions include amendments in guidelines for transfer of teachers and principals of constituent colleges.

 To meet the expenditure under these heads, the university has decided to develop a corpus fund of Rs 3 crore realised from students under provisional and migration certificate heads. The fund will be fixed-deposited in a nationalised bank and the expenses would be made on interest realised from this.

 Two BPL category students will be provided free education along with a monthly stipend of Rs 500 per month in PG studies. Besides, toppers of all PG subjects will be offered jobs of teaching assistants in respective departments at a monthly remuneration of Rs 4,000, initially for a period of one year. During the period, the toppers would develop teaching skills as well as prepare for lecturers jobs, said Khan.

 The corpus fund will also be utilised to hire 15 computer operators on contractual basis to be posted in computerised tabulation centre (near Central Library) to expedite the process of publication of results, said proctor Jyoti Kumar.

 The syndicate also took other important decisions, including service confirmation of as many as 94 Grade IV and III employees who were hitherto serving in a fixed remuneration of Rs 2,000 per month in different constituent colleges.

 The proposal to set up independent infrastructure, including a building of its own for BEd studies (currently in 10 constituent colleges), was also accepted. 

 Besides, on the matter of Jamshedpur-based BV Parikh Janta Mahavidyalaya, that ceases to function since last year, the syndicate decided to utilise a fund of Rs 5.55 lakh deposited in a bank for the purpose of giving salaries to its teaching and non-teaching staff transferred elsewhere.

 In an another important decision, the syndicate gave its nod on matter of transfer of teachers and principals of the colleges following a committees report. Once the proposal gets approved by the governor and the state government, a possible change would be made in the statutes. The proposal suggests for every principal/teacher to serve at least one term of three years in a college situated in rural area or non-classified cities.

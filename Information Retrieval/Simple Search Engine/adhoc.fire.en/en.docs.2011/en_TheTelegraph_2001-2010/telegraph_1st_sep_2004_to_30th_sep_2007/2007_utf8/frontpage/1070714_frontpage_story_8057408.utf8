 AUDF support for Pratibha

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Guwahati, July 13: The Assam United Democratic Front (AUDF) today assured UPA presidential candidate Pratibha Patil of its support for Thursdays election to the countrys highest office. 

 Leaders of the AUDF, however, stayed away from a programme organised by the Congress at Machkhowa ITA Complex to garner support for her candidature for the presidency.

 They met Patil later at Borjhar airport, before she left for Lucknow to attend another rally. 

 AUDF general secretary (administration) H.B.A. Qassimi said a delegationcomprising eight of its 10 MLAs interacted with Patil. 

 He said they conveyed to her their support in the presence of AICC leaders Digvijay Singh and Chandan Bagchi, Union minister Sontosh Mohan Dev and MP Kirip Chaliha. 

 Our president Badruddin Ajmal greeted her with a gamocha and a japi. He has formally announced our support for her, Qassimi said.

 Congress leaders of the Northeast, led by chief ministers Tarun Gogoi, D.D. Lapang, Okram Ibobi Singh and K. Dorjee and Assam PCC president Bhubaneswar Kalita, presented a picture of unanimity in support for Patils candidature. 

 They heaped praise on her for her long and distinguished career. 

 An overwhelmed Patil thanked everybody for their support. She said the beautiful Northeast had a special place in her heart. 

 She had last visited the region as a Maharashtra minister in the seventies to study the problems faced by tribals. 

 In her brief speech, Patil highlighted the virtues of secularism and inclusive growth and pledged to work for the progress of the nation.

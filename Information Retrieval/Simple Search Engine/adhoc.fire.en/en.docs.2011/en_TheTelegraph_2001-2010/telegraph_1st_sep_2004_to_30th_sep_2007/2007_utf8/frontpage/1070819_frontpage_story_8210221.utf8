 NSCN extortionists lynched 

 - Govt institutes judicial inquiry, outfit looks into episode

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Kohima, Aug. 18: Three activists of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) were lynched by a mob in Tuensang town, some 250km from here, this afternoon. This was confirmed by sources in the Tuensang district administration as well as the NSCN (I-M). 

 Nagaland commissioner T.N. Mannen disclosed that a crowd comprising hundreds of irate residents overpowered the few security personnel posted at the Tuensang police station. The mob dragged out the activists and lynched them. 

 The fracas began when some policemen tried to prevent the three NSCN (I-M) activists from collecting taxes illegally from one of the areas in the town. The three extortionists had a scuffle with the policemen. 

 According to an official source, the extortionists even tried to snatch the service rifle of one of the policemen. In the melee, a policeman sustained an injury from a bullet fired from his rifle. The three activists were then arrested and locked up at the police station. 

 As word of the incident spread, hundreds of irate townspeople came to the police station and overpowered the few guards there. The mob then proceeded to beat the extortionists to death. 

 The state government has instituted a one-man judicial inquiry into the incident. 

 The NSCN (I-M) has confirmed that its activists were beaten to death this afternoon by a mob. Self-styled brigadier Phungthing Shimrang of the outfit said they were looking into the whole episode. 

 That the Naga people are fed up with extortion demands by the two factions of the NSCN and other underground outfits is also clear from another development. 

 The Angami Nagas today decided not to pay any tax or donation to any Naga underground outfit. 

 This resolution was adopted in the wake of the attack on former Angami Students Union president Medo Yhokha on Thursday. 

 Yhokha was attacked at Jail Colony by activists of the Khaplang faction of the NSCN. 

 We will not pay tax or donation to the factions till they unite, president of the Angami Students Union, Kelhouniezo Angami, announced after a meeting. The NSCN (K)s Singson Kuki, military supervisor of union territories I and II (Dimapur and Athibung), said they would meet the Angami leaders to sort out the matter. Shops and business establishments will remain closed till then.

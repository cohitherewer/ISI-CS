 System upgrade for power board

 - Assam to make optimum use of technology

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Guwahati, Aug. 31: Assam power minister Pradyut Bordoloi today said the Assam State Electricity Board (ASEB) would soon introduce the state-of-the-art supervisory control and data acquisition system for online monitoring of its network and consumer base.

 Bordolois announcement came on the final day of NICT 2007 the regions biggest information technology and communication conclave at the Vishwaratna Hotel here. 

 Information and communication technology usage has become all pervasive and it is only imperative that the ASEB, too, adapts to the changing times, Bordoloi said during his keynote address on the subject, Driving Business Value Through ICT in the Energy Sector.

 He said the introduction of the system would enable the state power board to do several things online, including meter readings of its consumers. The system will be introduced in Guwahati and later in other parts of the state in a phased manner.

 The power minister also said the board was going for extensive use of GPS and GIS technology for its transmission network. 

 Giving a broad overview of the changes being brought in to the ASEB since the power reforms started, Bordoloi said the board has been able to bring down transmission losses to a great extent. He added that the board was looking at newer technologies to enhance production.

 While hydropower is a possible answer to our energy needs, most of the rivers in the state flow through plains, which makes the conventional hydel power stations unviable. An MIT professor has come up with a turbine which generates power from water stream in the plains. We are also studying this innovation as Brazil has been able to generate over 600MW from the Amazon using this turbine, Bordoloi said.

 Numaligarh Refinery MD Bhupati Das also spoke on the subject wherein he highlighted the extensive use of ICT in the oil sector.

 Padmashree Patricia Mukhim, columnist and development activist, however, felt that instead of big power projects, the states should try to concentrate on non-conventional power sources like wind and solar energy.

 Pradyut Bordoloi said there was need to identify alternative energy sources in the country and nuclear energy was one of those. He said the nuclear deal with the US would help in this regard.

 The two-day conference saw 22 speakers from the IT world, academicia and bureaucracy make presentations on the penetration of IT in different fields of life.

 Assam Governor Ajai Singh, Union minister of state for commerce Jairam Ramesh and state IT minister Himanta Biswa Sarma attended the conclave yesterday.

 The delegates included a large number of young IT enthusiasts from different institutes.

 One of them, Rahul Dolakasharia Saikia, a student of the Assam Institute of Management (AIM), won a laptop in the lucky draw held on the final day.

 Shraman Jha, vice-president of The Telegraph, who declared the event closed, said before signing off that NICT has been an exciting journey in the IT field for the Northeast.

 This was the third edition of NICT, which started in 2005.

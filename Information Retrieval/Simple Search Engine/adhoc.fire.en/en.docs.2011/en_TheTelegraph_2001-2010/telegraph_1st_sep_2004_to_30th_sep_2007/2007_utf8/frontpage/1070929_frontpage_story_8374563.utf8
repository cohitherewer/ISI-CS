 Guwahati to be first to fete Amit

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, Sept. 28: Residents of Guwahati will be the first in the Northeast to felicitate Amit Paul ahead of his hometown Shillong after his electrifying performance in the musical reality show, Indian Idol III. The show ended last week, with the crowning of Darjeelings Prashant Tamang. 

 Paul will be felicitated on Tuesday during the Guwahati Mahotsav 2007 which starts at the Sonaram Higher Secondary School ground on Sunday. 

 Amit Paul, who lost out on the Indian Idol crown, will return to his hometown on October 6 to a grand welcome organised by the Meghalaya government, which has appointed him the states brand ambassador. 

 Amit will be felicitated at 6pm on October 2 at the fair ground. Prominent personalities from Assam and Meghalaya will felicitate him, said an official spokesperson of event management group Joya Communications, the organisers of the event. 

 He will also be cheering on participants of the TVS College Icon, a singing talent hunt organised as part of the carnival from October 2 to 6. The contest will select the best singing talent from among students of colleges in the city.

 The winner of the contest will win a motorcycle and also get the chance to cut an album with a reputable music company of the state.

 Expecting a huge turnout by Amits fans at the fair ground on the day of the celebrations, the organisers have made elaborate security arrangements.

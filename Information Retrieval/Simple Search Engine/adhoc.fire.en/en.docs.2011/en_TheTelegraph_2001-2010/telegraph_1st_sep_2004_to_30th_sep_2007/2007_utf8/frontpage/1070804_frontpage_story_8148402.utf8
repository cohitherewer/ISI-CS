 Trader gunned down near car

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Aug. 3: A garment dealer who owns a shop in the landmark Satyanarayan Park underground AC market was shot dead tonight in Burrabazar when he was about to get into his car.

 Uttam Chaurasia, 45, was shot in the head at close range on Ratan Sarkar Garden Lane, near Posta Bazar, where his car was parked.

 Police suspect extortion by an inter-state gang could be the motive behind the crime possibly the first murder of a Burrabazar businessman since 2004 and almost similar to another a few months earlier in the same year.

 At least six rounds are said to have been fired at Chaurasia. One bullet hit him in his head and two pierced his chest and abdomen while the others missed the target. Investigators feel that the shots were fired from a sophisticated pistol.

 Sources at Shree Visudhanand Hospital and Research Institute, where Chaurasia was brought dead, said a gunshot injury behind the right ear proved fatal.

 The sources said some people brought Chaurasia to the hospital in a rickshaw van. He was clad in black trousers and an orange shirt.

 The police said people in the neighbourhood found the businessman lying face down in a pool of blood between 9.45 and 10 pm.

 The businessman was a tenant of an apartment on Kali Krishna Tagore Street, located close to the site of the murder.

 Chaurasia is survived by three daughters and one son aged between 12 and 3 wife Sunitadevi and his octogenarian mother, according to Narayan Minani, a neighbour.

 The police cordoned off some streets near the murder site and tried to seek out witnesses. But till late tonight, none could be found.

 The Satyanarayan market was in the news four years ago when Calcuttas first underground fire broke out there. Around 300 garment shops in the central Calcutta market, inaugurated by chief minister Jyoti Basu in 1998, were destroyed in the fire.

 In November 2004, a gang had shot dead Shekhar Roy, a soft drinks and consumer goods dealer in Burrabazar, after robbing him of Rs 4 lakh near Vidyasagar Setu.

 A few months earlier in February, a 25-year-old businessman, Shambhu Choudhury, was abducted and shot dead in his Santro.

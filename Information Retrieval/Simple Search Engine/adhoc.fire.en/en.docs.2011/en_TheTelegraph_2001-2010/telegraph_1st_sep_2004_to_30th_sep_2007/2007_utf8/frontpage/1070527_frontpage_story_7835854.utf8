 Bomb fury rips Guwahati 

 Injured recount tales of horror

 OUR BUREAU 

 Guwahati, May 26: One moment it was business as usual on S.C. Road, a narrow lane lined with residential buildings and shops at Athgaon. The next moment, it was Dantes Inferno recreated on earth. 

 The bomb planted by Ulfa in an abandoned autorickshaw triggered a chain of events, which will haunt many for a long time. As the smoke cleared, the scene that surfaced was one of pure horror. 

 Witnesses talked about the intensity of the blast, saying that the sound was heard far and wide. Buildings bore the impact, with shattered glass strewn all over the street. 

 I heard a deafening sound and fell on the ground. As I gathered my wits, I saw bodies and dismembered parts lying on the road, said Roshan Pandey, one of those injured in the blast. Pandey said he was horrified at a sight of a body with a severed head lying on the mangled remains of a cycle-rickshaw. People vented their anger on the police, who they alleged had failed to act despite reports that such explosions were likely. 

 The blasts are happening owing to the laxity of the police. The policemen at checkposts are more interested in greasing their palms than in detecting explosives, Sunil Sharma, a student, alleged. 

 The blast was followed by an impromptu bandh in the citys central business district comprising Fancy Bazar, Panbazar, Athgaon and Machkhowa.

 The sense of shock and grief was writ large on the faces of the people who gathered at the blast site. Similar scenes were witnessed at the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital (GMCH). Those who had come to get information about their relatives could be heard bemoaning their plight as utter chaos prevailed. 

 The mother of 28-year-old Partha Shah was inconsolable. Her son was the sole breadwinner of the family. 

 Lying on a hospital bed at GMCH, 16-year-old Habijur Islam, a carpenter, described the scene. There was a huge blast, sending bodies flying into the air. People started running helter-skelter in confusion. Some were bleeding profusely. 

 Angry residents of Athgaon later took out a procession carrying placards with anti-Ulfa slogans. 

 East Guwahati MLA Robin Bordoloi, who visited GMCH to enquire about the condition of the injured, criticised Ulfa for spilling the blood of innocent citizens. 

 The All Guwahati Students Union will observe a black day tomorrow in protest against the blast. It will unfurl a black flag at Swahid Nyas, the AASU headquarters.

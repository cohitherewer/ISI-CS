 Report on AMCH probe today

 OUR BUREAU 

 Guwahati/Dibrugarh, May 22: The Gogoi government today cracked its whip on the Assam Medical College and Hospital for the assault on two attendants accompanying a minor on Saturday. 

 Health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma today said the principal of Barpeta Medical College, T.R. Borbora, has replaced AMCH principal Debojit Hazarika. He added that the magistrate probing the incident would submit his report to the government tomorrow. 

 Sarma said police have been asked to register cases against the accused and those found guilty would not be spared. The administration of the AMCH has left a lot to be desired though it receives more assistance compared to Silchar Medical College or Gauhati Medical College and Hospital, Sarma said. 

 Several organisations have called for a 12-hour bandh in Dibrugarh from 6 am tomorrow to protest against the incident.

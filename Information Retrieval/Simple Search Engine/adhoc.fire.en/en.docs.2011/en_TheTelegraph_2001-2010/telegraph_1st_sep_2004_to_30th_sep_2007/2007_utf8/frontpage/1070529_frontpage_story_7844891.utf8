 Khandu push for visa talks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 28: Peeved at Chinas repeated denial of visas to officials and politicians from Arunachal Pradesh, chief minister Dorjee Khandu today said he had urged the Centre to take up the issue with Beijing.

 Khandu, who is in the capital to attend a conference of chief ministers on the power sector, said Chinas refusal to accept Arunachal Pradesh as an integral part of India on the ground that it is a disputed area is unfortunate.

 He is planning to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee to mount pressure on them to issue strong statements against Chinas action.

 Last week, the Centre had cancelled a trip to China by a group of IAS officers following Beijings denial of visa to an officer from Arunachal Pradesh. 

 Chinas refusal to grant visa to one of the states officials implies that it wants to project Arunachal Pradesh as not being an integral part of India, Khandu said.

 Beijing had earlier denied visas to officials and politicians from Arunachal Pradesh. Many in capitals political establishment feel such affirmative steps like the one by New Delhi last week should have been taken much earlier.

 We have said what we wanted to say. The matter should now be taken up at the diplomatic level between the two countries and we have told this to the Centre in no uncertain terms, principal adviser to Khandu, Tsering Gyurme, said.

 A minister in the previous Gegong Apang ministry, he visited China last year on a tourist visa after being denied a visa by Beijing for an official trip. 

 Beijing, however, did not object to his visit to Tibet. The purpose of his visit is being investigated by the Centre.

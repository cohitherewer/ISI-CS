 Death shock on terrace

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, March 24: Decomposed body of a woman was found this morning on the terrace of a house in Kalinga Nagar Residential Colony, situated on the outskirts of the city.

 This is the second body of a woman to be found in the locality having several unoccupied government quarters. Another decomposed body was found here on January 16 last. 

 Today, the body was recovered from the terrace of an unoccupied quarter on plot number 164. It is situated a few yards away from the quarter where the first body was found. Along with the skeleton, a sari, two petticoats, a blouse, pieces of cloth, bangles and an anklet were also found. 

 The remains were spotted when some residents of the colony spotted a dog with a bone and informed the police.

 Foul smell had been emanating from the house for about a month now, said Basudev Rath, a resident. We thought some animal must have died there. But this morning we saw some stray dogs fighting for a bone that appeared to be of a human beings hand. 

 Sub-inspector G.S. Chakrabarti said it is too premature to make a statement, but added: it seems to be a case of gangrape and murder. 

 The police are yet to solve the mystery of the earlier body. 

 The colony consists of about 2,000 quarters. The place is criminals haven as 400 of them are unoccupied.

 Excel in exam fails to stop mass exodus

 ARTI SAHULIYAR

 Bangalore beckons

 Ranchi, May 20: The state seems to be ill-equipped to prevent Class XII pass-outs from migrating to other states to pursue higher studies.

 DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir, Shyamali, and Delhi Public School are being considered as centres of academic excellence owing to their brilliant performance at the board examinations every year. But 97 per cent of the science pass-outs from these schools are migrating to Pune, Karnataka, Bengal and Delhi to pursue engineering and medical education.

 As per rough estimates, around 40-50 per cent students from commerce and arts background too are moving out. Those who stay back either prepare for CA or law, while others opt for MBA after completing graduation.

 There are many who try to get into IITs and AIIMS, Bharityapith Engineering College, Pune, Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, and Jadavpur University in Bengal, SRM Engineering College in Orissa among others.

 If students fail to get a seat in reputed engineering or medical colleges, they make their way to Karnataka, which has around 110 engineering colleges and the fee structure is comparably blow.

 If there are 500 students from the city studying in reputed engineering colleges, around 50 move abroad for better prospects, mainly Indonesia, to get a job in mechanical field and the US in software field.

 As for those completing Class X, they either take admission in Plus Two in either DPS or DAV Shyamali. According to students, biology stream is good in DAV Shyamali, while for mathematics, DPS is always the preferred choice.

 Nitesh Tiwary, a Class XII (science) student of DAV Shyamali, awaiting his result, said he had appeared in five competitive examinations across the country. If I get through those, IIT would be my first choice. After four years in engineering, several students opt going to the US or Indonesia, Tiwary added.

 Nikhil Jain, another Class XII student awaiting his result, rued the absence of any engineering college in the city. So for science students, moving out has become an obvious choice. Besides, Pune has become the new destination to study engineering. Not many students opt for BIT Mesra for some unknown reasons, added Jain.

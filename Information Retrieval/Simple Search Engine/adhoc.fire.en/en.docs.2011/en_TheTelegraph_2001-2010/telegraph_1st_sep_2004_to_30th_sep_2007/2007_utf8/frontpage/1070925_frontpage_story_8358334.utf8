 A deluge threatened to engulf the World Cup delight in Calcutta and the rest of South Bengal as relentless rain kept the city on edge through the day. Cricket lovers initial relief at an excuse to stay indoors to watch the match turned into despair as the water level began rising and many family members were marooned. Nine persons died in the districts. The weather office has predicted more heavy rain at least till tomorrow afternoon, saying a decrease was likely from the evening provided the depression that submerged Calcutta today moved northwest. Officials at Alipore measured nearly 170mm rain between 8.30am and 8.30pm today, but were yet to calculate if the 24-hour figures would outstrip the 211.6mm on September 22, 2006 the second-highest September rainfall ever recorded.

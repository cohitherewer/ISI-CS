 Ranchi, June 17: The state will soon have the countrys first rifle shooting range of international standard at Hotwar, the site of the 34th National Games.

 National Rifle Association secretary D.K. Shukla and technical experts made the claim after visiting the rifle shooting range early this morning. Jharkhand will have the pride of being the first state in the country to have a rifle shooting range equipped with each and every requirement of hosting an international meet, he said.

 Two other international standard shooting ranges will follow in Pune and Delhi, respectively, he added.

 This range will be the first in the country to have electronic scoring targets. It will also be the first to have the latest machines and equipment for trap-and-skeet shooting using a shotgun, he said.

 The advantage of this latest machine is that the shooters command will open the trap and the target will be released. Thus, a shooter will not be dependent on a technical man operating a switch to open the trap and release the target, which often led to complaints that the switch was operated just that bit late.

 The range will also have the latest scoring targets that were used at Doha Asiad and will be used at the coming Beijing Olympic next year, Shukla said.

 If everything goes according to the plan, the electronic boards will automatically display the scores and respective positions of the shooters for both participants and spectators and will also rule out any suspicion of manipulation.

 The ranges main advantage is that the contestants, or shooters, will not be disturbed either by spectators or the VIPs as they will have a separate entry and exit facilities and at no point there would be the least possibility of any interaction between a shooter and spectators.

 The arena will also have separate air-conditioned rest rooms and a cafeteria so that a shooter can relax and prepare himself without getting tired, as shooting events take almost 10 hours to complete.

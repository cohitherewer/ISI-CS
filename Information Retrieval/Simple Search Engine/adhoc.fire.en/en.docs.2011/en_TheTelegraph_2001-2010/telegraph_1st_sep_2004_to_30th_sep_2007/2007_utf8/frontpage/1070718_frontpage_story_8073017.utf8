 Sulfa duo 

hired to kill Deka 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 July 17: The man who plotted to murder PWD engineer Ajay Deka for demanding his money back paid Rs 1 lakh in advance to two surrendered Ulfa militants for the deed, police said today.

 The prime accused, Rintu Choudhury, had taken Rs 6 lakh from his victim to fix a railway job for an acquaintance. When Rintu failed to keep his part of the deal, Deka demanded his money back and a murder conspiracy was hatched. The engineer was found dead just outside the Narengi army cantonment yesterday.

 The police said Rintu hired surrendered Ulfa militants Anil Sarania and Subhash Roy for Rs 2 lakh to kill Deka. He paid them Rs 1 lakh in advance and promised to give the remaining amount after the murder, a police official said. 

 A police team found Rs 1 lakh in cash and the victims mobile phone during a search of Rintus residence at Pathsala in Barpeta district. 

 One Amar Thapa had introduced Rintu and his brother Jintu to the Sulfa duo and brokered the deal. 

 The Sulfa rebels then hatched the conspiracy to kill Deka at the quarter of lance naik Akon Kumar Das at Narengi cantonment. Das was also an Ulfa militant before surrendering and getting a job in the army. He was reportedly paid Rs 50,000 for assisting in the murder, the police official said. 

 Except Subhash and Amar, all the conspirators in the murder are in police custody. The five accused were remanded in police custody for three days on being produced in court this afternoon. 

 Deka went missing after leaving home in his Wagon-R on Saturday evening. The police said he was murdered that very night.

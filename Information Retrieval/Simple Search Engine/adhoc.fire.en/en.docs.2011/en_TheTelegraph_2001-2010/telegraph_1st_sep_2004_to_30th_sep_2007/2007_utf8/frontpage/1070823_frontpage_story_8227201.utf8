 Vienna, shut 

 and open

 - IAEA agenda deadline passes but options still exist 

 K.P. Nayar

 Washington, 

 Aug. 22: While the Left parties and the Congress 

 are quarrelling over the next steps towards operationalising 

 the nuclear deal, the deadline for formal consideration 

 of any India-specific agreement by the International Atomic 

 Energy Agency (IAEA) this year has quietly passed.

 According to IAEA officials in 

 Vienna, August 17 one month before the start of the organisations 

 General Conference was the deadline for including any 

 item in the agenda for the annual meeting.

 Should the Director General 

 receive by 17 August 2007 any request under Rule 13 for 

 inclusion of a supplementary item in the agenda, such an 

 item will, unless Rule 21 applies, be placed in a list which 

 will be circulated no later than 27 August 2007, according 

 to an IAEA circular sent out to member countries as part 

 of preparations for the annual meeting. 

 Officials said that till the passing 

 of the deadline, New Delhi had not given notice of any India-specific 

 item related to the nuclear deal to be included in the General 

 Conference next month.

 Whether an act of omission or 

 commission, it may provide an olive branch in the standoff 

 between the Left and the Congress that could be the starting 

 point for a compromise.

 The IAEAs next General Conference 

 will take place only from September 29, 2008, which will 

 give the ruling alliance enough time to either sort out 

 the nuclear tangle or split up and seek a new popular mandate.

 By then, however, the nuclear 

 deal may be dead for practical reasons. The US will be only 

 a few weeks away from elections for a new president and 

 a new Congress. It is highly unlikely that a president with 

 three-and-a-half months left in transition will have the 

 political capital to see through the passage of the 123 

 Agreement in his legislature.

 The US Congress may itself decide 

 that it is best left to a new legislature to take a view 

 of the 123 pact in consultation with a successor White House.

 The provisional agenda for next 

 months IAEA General Conference, however, has loopholes 

 to take a view on issues related to the nuclear deal even 

 past the August 17 deadline if the Manmohan Singh government 

 takes a hard line and decides not to give in to the Left 

 ultimatum.

 According to the provisional agenda, 

 which has been distributed among ambassadors in Vienna accredited 

 to the UN, there are two items of interest to New Delhi. 

 Item 16 refers to strengthening 

 the Agencys technical cooperation activities 

 while item 18 refers to strengthening the effectiveness 

 and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system and 

 application of the model additional protocol.

 If the Indian delegation to the 

 General Conference, which is likely to be led by Anil Kakodkar, 

 chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, is determined 

 or creative enough to use these loopholes, they may still 

 be able to push in their priorities or at least discuss 

 the Indian issues, if only to gauge the mood in the global 

 nuclear watchdog.

 If this is the Indian strategy, 

 neither the India-specific safeguards agreement nor an 

 additional protocol need go to the IAEA Board of Governors 

 beforehand.

 The board is meeting from September 

 10 to 14 but will reconvene on November 22 and 23.

 By that time, the crisis in the 

 UPA may have been sorted out one way or another and Kakodkar 

 would have obtained a sense of the mood in the IAEA at the 

 General Conference before India can approach the board for 

 the next steps in the nuclear deal.

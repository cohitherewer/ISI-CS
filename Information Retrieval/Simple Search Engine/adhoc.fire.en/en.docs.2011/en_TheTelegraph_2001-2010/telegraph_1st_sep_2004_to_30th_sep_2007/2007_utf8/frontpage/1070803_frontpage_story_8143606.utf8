 Mumbai, Aug. 2: Sanjay Dutt has been led out of the Arthur Road Jail where he felt like an animal in a zoo and into Punes Yerwada Central Prison, 250km away.

 Munnabhai should feel at home there, for the Pune jail teaches its inmates the philosophy of the Mahatma, who did two terms there.

 Sanjay, revived by packs of gutkha brought by sister Priya after a bout of low pressure, left the Arthur Road Jail this evening, still wearing the white shirt and jeans he had arrived in on Tuesday.

 The actor and his sisters had so far been insistent that he should serve his time closer home in the Mumbai jail.

 But his lawyers today withdrew their plea against a shift after Sanjay, according to a source close to the family, told sisters Namrata and Priya: I feel like an animal in a zoo. Get me out of this place.

 A jail official said other inmates had badgered Sanjay through Wednesday. They recited dialogues and sang songs from his movies to tease him and get his attention. But he sat quietly, often burying himself in a newspaper.

 The official admitted that security was poor at the jail, and bullying and fighting common among inmates.

 State jail authorities, however, believe Sanjay would have had to shift anyway.

 Our senior officials were annoyed at the way Sanjay kept going directly to the court seeking a jail of his choice. Its not his prerogative to do so. Once he has been convicted, its the jail authorities decision, a jail official said.

 The inspector-general of prisons, Satish Mathur, today explained to judge Pramod Kode why the film star should be moved.

 One, the Mumbai jail is meant only for undertrials. Two, security isnt as tight as at the Yerwada jail. Three, its overcrowded, housing 3,000 prisoners although its meant for just 800. Four, all other 93 blast convicts have been shifted.

 And five, the jail has no provisions to make inmates work, whereas the actor has been sentenced to six years rigorous imprisonment.

 Tailor-made

 Those with Bollywood-inspired visions of prisoners quarrying stones and straining at chakkis can breathe easy, though.

 Yerwada, known for the best use of manpower among inmates, teaches them computers, carpentry, tailoring, handicrafts even gardening, farming and cooking. Trainees get Rs 20 a day and skilled hands, Rs 60.

 A family friend said Sanjay was keen on tailoring, especially designing, because he is fond of clothes. He wants to learn the basics in case he wants to start his own line of clothes, the friend added.

 Sanjay, however, could straight away be sent to work in the garden, which grows fruits, vegetables and medicinal plants, said jailer Rajendra Dhamane. But he didnt rule out tailoring.

 The countrys second-largest jail after Tihar is self-sufficient, growing its entire food requirement and then selling some, and is also a small-industry hub with an annual turnover running into crores.

 Shirts made by the inmates are exported to Europe, and the furniture they build is bought by the state.

 Sanjay is unlikely to be involved in carpentry, or in handicrafts that are meant mainly for women and the aged, Dhamane said.

 He didnt say if Munnabhai, too, would need to take the Gandhism lessons.

 More worrying are reports that the vaunted security counts for little forced sodomy and suicide are rampant.

 The actor, though, will get a quiet, solitary cell to himself, breathing the breeze blowing in from a nearby golf course. At Arthur Road, his cell was at the end of a barracks, open to its noise, chaos and bullies.

 But he may now start feeling a little lonely: his sisters can only meet him once every 15 days.

 Today, though, girlfriend Maanyata and fans followed the police van all the way to Pune. A mild lathicharge was used to disperse a crowd shouting slogans in support of Munnabhai outside the jail.

 Indian airline strike called off

 New Delhi, June 14(Reuters): Employees of India's state-run air

 line, Indian, on Thursday called off a three-

 day strike that had 

 stranded thousands of 

 passengers as scores of 

 flights were cancelled 

 or delayed, a 

 spokesman said.

 The decision came 

 after an agreement be

 tween the union of 

 ground staff and the 

 management, allowing 

 the resumption of nor

 mal flight operations, 

 an aviation ministry 

 spokeswoman said.

 ldquo;There were some 

 minor issues on wage 

 arrears and career pro

 gression which were 

 amicably settled be

 tween the manage

 ment, ministry and the 

 workers, rdquo; she said. 

 ldquo;They will see how 

 soon normalcy can be 

 brought about. rdquo;

 The strike started late 

 on Tuesday when em

 ployees of Indian, for

 merly known as Indian 

 Airlines, stopped work 

 demanding higher 

 wages and benefits 

 amid a boom in air 

 travel in the country, 

 the world's fastest-

 growing aviation mar

 ket.

 It led to the cancella

 tion of some 200 

 flights and scores more 

 were delayed, creating 

 chaos at airports across 

 the country and throw

 ing air travel off 

 course.

 Thousands of ground 

 staff and some cabin 

 crew of the predomi

 nantly domestic carrier 

 defied a court order to 

 end their protest, as 

 well as warnings of 

 suspension and closure 

 from the government, 

 saying they would not 

 be cowed by threats.

 Details of the settle

 ment were not imme

 diately available and 

 union leaders could 

 not be reached for 

 comment. Local televi

 sion news channels 

 said the government 

 had agreed to pay 

 salary arrears demand

 ed by the workers by 

 next year.

 The management had 

 also agreed to recon

 sider suspension notices issued to 23 striking employees, they 

 said.

 Passengers distraught

 Indian, which had a 

 monopoly of the skies 

 before the sector was 

 opened up to private 

 carriers in the early 

 1990s, operates about 

 330 flights every day, 

 carrying about 30,000 

 passengers.

 The airline was notori

 ous for its poor service 

 but has pulled up its 

 socks since the entry of 

 private players trig

 gered intense competi

 tion.

 Analysts said Indian 

 currently had nearly a 

 quarter of the country's 

 domestic aviation 

 business, as a booming 

 economy has led to a 

 sharp rise in air travel 

 and the launch of several private, low-fare 

 airlines.

 Indian is being merged 

 with Air India, the 

 state-run international 

 flagship, to take on the 

 competition.

 For many harried pas

 sengers, the disrup

 tions were a throwback 

 to the days when 

 strikes or delays were 

 frequent.

 Vinoth Kumar, an en

 gineer, was not sure if 

 he could be by the side 

 of his wife, who was 

 expected to deliver 

 their first child on 

 Thursday in the south

 ern city of Coimbatore.

 ldquo;I don't think I can get 

 there, I am just having 

 to talk to her by phone. 

 I think I will miss the 

 birth, rdquo; he said outside 

 Delhi airport before 

 the strike was called 

 off, adding that some 

 private carriers had 

 raised fares to take ad

 vantage of the strike.

 Susan Montez, a 

 tourist from Texas, 

 said she was stuck at 

 Delhi airport since she 

 arrived from Dubai on 

 her way to the northern 

 Indian Sikh holy city 

 of Amritsar.

 They just have me run

 ning back and forth. 

 This is my first trip to 

 India, it's going to be 

 the last too, rdquo; she said.

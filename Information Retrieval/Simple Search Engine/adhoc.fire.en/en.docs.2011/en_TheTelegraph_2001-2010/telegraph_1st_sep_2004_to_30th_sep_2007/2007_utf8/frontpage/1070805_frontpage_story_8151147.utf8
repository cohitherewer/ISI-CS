 Strike threat to steel units

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Jamshedpur, Aug. 4: The shadow of indefinite economic blockade at Gua mines would stretch over four more mines Kiriburu, Megahataburu, Chiria and Bolani in West Singhbhum tomorrow, posing serious threat on production at SAIL units in Bokaro, Durgapur and Burnpur. 

 After marathon truce talks between Supply Mazdoor Sangh, the union spearheading the movement at Gua, and SAIL ended inconclusively in Calcutta today, the labourers union decided to intensify its stir from tomorrow. 

 The meeting between the labourers union and the officials of SAILs raw material division continued in Calcutta for about six hours but it failed to bring a positive outcome. 

 Rajesh Koda, the president of the Supply Mazdoor Sangh and brother of chief minister Madhu Koda, told The Telegraph that a decision had been taken to spread the economic blockade to four other mines from tomorrow. 

 We will create disturbance and not allow the PSU to function properly until our demand of regularising the 700-odd contract workers is met with, said Rajesh Koda. 

 An agitated Koda went to the extent of asking the SAIL officials attending the meeting to pack up its operations from Jharkhand. He alleged that against the minimum wage of Rs 81 (as per the Minimum Wages Act), the contract workers were being paid Rs 39.70 per day. 

 The executive director of SAILs raw material division, Jayant Kanjilal, headed the PSU delegation in the meet.

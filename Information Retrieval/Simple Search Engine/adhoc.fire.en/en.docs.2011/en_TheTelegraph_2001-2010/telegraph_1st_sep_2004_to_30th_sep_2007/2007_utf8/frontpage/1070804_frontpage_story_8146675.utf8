 Ram: Back again

 Ranchi, Aug. 3: Vishnu Dayal Ram is back to his old office: the director-general of police.

 He vacated this office about nine months ago after Madhu Koda became the chief minister.

 J.B. Mahapatra, the incumbent, will replace Ram in the homeguard and fire-tender brigade. He will also hold the additional charge of police housing corporation chief.

 The Election Commission has approved the change of guards although election code is in force because of the Jamshedpur bypoll. This apart, additional director-general (headquarters) Neyaz Ahamed has been given the additional of vigilance bureau.

 Mahapatra has been in the eye of storm for the past few months for allegedly availing railway passes, even after his term as chief of railway police in Jharkhand was over. The case is being probed by the Central Vigilance Commission. Despite repeated demands from the allies, Koda continued to protect the controversial cop. Mahapatra does not even happen to be an empanelled DIG because of adverse observations against him during the Bhagalpur riot in 1989 when he was the Bhagalpur DIG, said a senior official of the home department.

 Sources said that the Prime Minister too recently pulled up Koda in Delhi for poor law and order condition in the state. He also sought explanation for not appointing a full-time chief secretary and making a controversial cop the police chief. 

 Recently, a section of the media reported Mahapatras alleged involvement in felling trees and controversial appointments when he was the DIG of police training centre in Hazaribagh. He also allegedly breached protocol at a programme involving the governor yesterday.

 Road construction department under secretary K.K. Das was shifted to Dumka as sub-divisional officer and N.P. Yadav, the additional collector of Simdega, will join the office of tribal welfare commissioner as deputy secretary.

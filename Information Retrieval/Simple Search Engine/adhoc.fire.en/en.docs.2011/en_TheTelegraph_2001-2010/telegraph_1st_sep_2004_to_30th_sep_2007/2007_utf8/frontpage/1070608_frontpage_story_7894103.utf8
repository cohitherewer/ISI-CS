 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow,

 June 7: A certain

 Amitabh has been charged with dropping one of the most 

 famous

 surnames in the country.

 The

 identity crisis of Amitabh Bachchan deepened today

 with the Uttar Pradesh government telling a court

 that the actor concealed his surname while procuring

 farmland that gave him the now-overturned farmer status.

 ldquo;To avoid identity, Amitabh Bachchan did not

 use his surname. Even his father rsquo;s name was written

 as just Harivansh. Bachchan acquired the land through

 forgery and fraud, rdquo; additional advocate-general

 Devendra Upadhya said.

 Bachchan

 had also given a misleading address, the government

 counsel said while opposing the actor rsquo;s petition

 in the high court challenging the cancellation of

 allotment of the land in Barabanki, 35 km from Lucknow.

 The

 Faizabad additional commissioner rsquo;s court had

 last

 week ordered the cancellation, saying the land was

 allotted through fraudulent means.

 The

 actor had given his address

 as 17 Clive Road, Allahabad,

 while the house belongs to lawyer S.S. Tiwari,

 the

 government counsel said.

 ldquo;Amitabh rsquo;s father Harivansh Rai Bachchan

 was just a tenant at 17 Clive Road, rdquo; 

 Upadhya

 said later. The late poet lived in the house till

 1958, he said. After that, he moved to Nainital and

 then to Mumbai.

 The

 judge heard the arguments of both sides for almost

 90 minutes today and reserved the ruling on the maintainability

 of the petition.

 Supreme

 Court lawyers Mukul Rohatgi and I.P. Singh appeared

 on behalf of Bachchan.

 Singh

 told The Telegraph the petitioner rsquo;s argument

 was that the additional commissioner of Faizabad, Vidya

 Sagar Prasad, had issued the cancellation order without

 giving Bachchan rsquo;s counsel an opportunity to be

 heard. ldquo;It was an act of denial of natural justice, rdquo; he

 said.

 Bachchan,

 who is in Leeds now for a film awards event, told

 PTI he had full faith in 

 the

 judicial system of the country.

 ldquo;I will be holding a press conference when I

 get back to India on this matter, but this is not the

 right platform to talk about this, rdquo; he said.

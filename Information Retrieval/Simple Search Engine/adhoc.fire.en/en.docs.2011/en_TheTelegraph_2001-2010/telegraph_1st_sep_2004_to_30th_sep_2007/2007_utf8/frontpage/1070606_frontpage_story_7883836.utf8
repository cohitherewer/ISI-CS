The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage

 Ford finds the bunch decent

 - My job is to stay in the background, says frontrunner

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Bangalore,

 June 5: Despite being excited over the call from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), Graham Ford sounded somewhat concerned: Over the next few days after all, beginning tomorrow, Kent has important matches. 

 But, then, Ford is respected for a high degree of professionalism and an excellent work ethic qualities which made the BCCIs seven-man special committee look at him and not, say, a Dav Whatmore while shortlisting those best suited to succeed Greg Chappell.

 Englands John Emburey has also been called to Chennai on Saturday, but the 46-year-old Ford (who coached South Africa for over two-and-a-half years after the 1999 World Cup) is the absolute favourite to wear the Team India coachs hat.

 Ford, who is Kents director of cricket, spoke to The Telegraph for at least 20 minutes this afternoon. The one-time offie even took a question on tennis, a sport he has played with some distinction. 

 The following are excerpts:

 On being invited

 by the BCCI to make a presentation

 Its an honour and a compliment.... Getting to coach India will be a big challenge, a really huge one.... Exciting too.

 On who conveyed the committees decision

 I got a call from Ravi (Shastri) while the meeting was on last night.... Hes the one who started the process by asking whether Id be available...

 On whether his current employer, Kent, is going to release him

 Ive been keeping them in the loop from the time Ravi called some days ago.... Theyve been fantastic employers.... Very supportive.... I expect theyll continue to support me. My contract, of course, is till September 2008.

 On his travel plans

 This call has come at a difficult time.... We play an important four-dayer (against Yorkshire) from tomorrow and, then, theres an important one-day fixture (versus Hampshire) on Sunday.... Im awaiting word from our chief executive....

 [Late in the evening, Kent issued a media statement saying Ford had been allowed to interact with the BCCI.]

 On the presentation

 he intends making

 I cant go into details.... I need to sit with the committee and understand my role and responsibilities.... Know whats expected of me.... As I havent got the job yet, it wont be proper to say more.

 On the presence

 of real big names in the Indian team

 At different times, Ive interacted with quite a few of your players.... Ive found them a decent bunch.

 On Team India

 The players are hugely talented and theyre exciting to watch.... The manner of their game does bring them under a lot of attention.... However, they need to improve their away-record and, if I get the job, thats one area Ill be looking to work on.

 On whether he will

 have a chat with immediate predecessor Chappell if

 he does get the job

 Im definitely going to talk to a lot of people.... I need to be filled in.... Need to know more about Indian cricket.... Somebody like John Wright, whom Ive known well, will be high on the list of those Im going to call.... I realise Ill have to talk to former India players as well.

 On whether captain

 Rahul Dravid, a key backer, has spoken to him

 He hasnt. 

 On his style of

 coaching

 Generally, coaches need to adapt to the environment... For me, a coachs job is to create an environment for the players to improve.... Its about instilling confidence....

 On being labelled

 a coach with no ego

 My role is to stay in the background.

 On the areas where

 a coach can make a difference

 Team spirit... Getting the bunch to pull together... Helping the players believe in themselves, something thats very important.... Basically, a coach has to get his players to play like a team.... Its a priority. 

 On the unhappy ending

 of his innings with the Proteas, in early 2002

 Im not sure of the correct terminology, but the board did get rid of me.... I joined Kent in 2005.

 [Apparently, Ford paid the price for taking strong exception to the late Percy Sonns intervention on the morning of the 2001-02 Sydney Test. Thats when Jacques Rudolph got left out in favour of non-White Justin Ontong. Sonn was then heading the board.]

 On his academy in

 Natal

 Yes, Ive started the Graham Ford Cricket Academy, which is located between Durban and Pietermaritzburg.... I enjoy working with cricketers.... Enjoy the challenge of trying to improve their game.... 

 On whether, irrespective

 of the sport, he has been strongly influenced by any

 one coach

 Quite a few.... It wouldnt be fair to single out one or even a couple of them. 

 Finally, on whether

 hes still passionate about tennis

 (Laughs) Sadly, I dont get the time to follow it that closely.... I do try and make it to Wimbledon each year, though.... Be it at Big W or elsewhere, Roger Federer is my man... Hes phenomenal, isnt he?

 Babudom blues for CM

 OUR BURAU

 Ranchi/Bokaro, July 7: The battle over babudom between the Congress and chief minister Madhu Koda might script a new course of political twist in the state.

 The Congress is set to intensify its attack on Koda as the chief minister is said to have declined to remove his principal secretary Sukhdev Singh as per the wish of the Congress state president, Pradeep Balmuchu. I should have the discretion to keep the principal secretary of my choice, he curtly told Balmuchu.

 But Balmuchu, who rushed to Delhi today, seemed determined to remove Singh. I will stick to my stand and coax Koda to remove Singh and chief secretary A.K. Chugh.

 I am not saying they are corrupt. But they have certainly put a spanner into the development wheel by raising unnecessary queries. I have apprised Congress Jharkhand in-charge Noor Bano about all these, he said.

 Against this backdrop, Congress MP Chandrashekhar Dubey has multiplied the worries of Koda. He has set an eight-day deadline to transfer Bokaro deputy commissioner Sunil Kumar. He has threatened that the MPs and MLAs would stage a dharna in front of Raj Bhavan if Koda failed to fulfil his wish within the stipulated timeframe. 

 While several MPs and MLAs are fighting a pitched battle with the officialdom to establish their supremacy in their respective constituency, the IAS officers association has asked the legislators not to exceed the limits of decorum. The Bokaro unit of bureaucrats association has decided on Saturday to boycott all the programmes of Dubey. 

 Koda, significantly, has not intervened either to publicly clear the air over Balmuchus comments or on the IAS officers demand to tame the public representatives. Playing safe, he remained confined to his official residence after getting released from the hospital.

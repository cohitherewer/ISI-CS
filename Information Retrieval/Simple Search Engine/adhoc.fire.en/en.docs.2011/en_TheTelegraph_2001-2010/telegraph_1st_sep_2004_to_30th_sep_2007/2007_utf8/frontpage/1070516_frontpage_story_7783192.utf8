 June debut for maiden multiplex

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ranchi, May 15: The state cabinet today paved the way for the first multiplex to open its doors in the state when it allowed multiplex and cinema hall owners to fix rates of their choice. 

 Earlier, they were bound to keep the rates below Rs 60, which was the highest ticket cinema halls could sell in the state. Todays decision will allow for more flexible rates.

 The states first multiplex, Eyelex, built at an estimated cost of Rs 8 crore has been ready since January this year. But the promoters were reluctant to open the multiplex at Hinoo because of the existing rule that restrained them from fixing rates beyond Rs 60.

 Eyelex promoter Narayan Jalan welcomed the decision and said it would encourage entrepreneurs to set up more multiplexes in the state. Eyelex itself will start operating within a month, he hoped.

 Two more multiplexes are under construction in the city, pointed out Jalan, one on Ratu Road in place of Uphaar cinema and another in front of the GEL Church Complex. The decision will give a fillip to many more multiplexes in different parts of the state, he asserted.

 Even existing cinemas, which were no longer being maintained, will be given a fresh lease of life , said Jalan. The freedom to fix flexible prices to attract different kind of viewers at different hours of the day and night, he pointed out, will prompt cinema owners to spend more money on refurbishing the halls and get better and newer films to screen.

 The state government also ratified a 6 per cent increase in dearness allowance for state government employees. 

 The revised DA will be effective from January this year, said cabinet coordination secretary N.N. Pandey while briefing the media. 

 The DA, he said, will now be on a par with central government employees.

 Tax exemption for one year was granted for rice, wheat, potato, onions among others and the cabinet also approved service rules for appointment of officials and employees for the implementation of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act.

 In another important decision, the cabinet gave its approval to accepting postal orders and non-judicial stamps as application fees for seeking information under the Right to Information Act. 

 The cabinet also decided to grant lease to mine granite over 8.5 acres of land in Koderma to Jharkhand State Mineral Development Corporation and over 10.36 acres of land in Deoghar to Harmeet Singh for mining of felspar and quartz.

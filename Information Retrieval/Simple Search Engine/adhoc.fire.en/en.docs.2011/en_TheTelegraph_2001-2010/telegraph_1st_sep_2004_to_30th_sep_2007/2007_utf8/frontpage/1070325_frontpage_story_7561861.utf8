 Ranchi, March 24: People lifted a road blockade at Bariatu late on Saturday afternoon but only after police registered an FIR against two medical students of Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) accused of instigating an assault on some youth following a verbal duel at a petrol pump outlet near the institute.

 City SP Richard Lakra and SDO Dipankar Panda had a tough time pacifying the agitated demonstrators, who squatted on the road with traditional weapons. They confirmed that a minor quarrel snowballed into a full-blown clash between RIMS students and neighbouring people last night. Three local youth Atul Munda (23), Ankit Minz (22) and Rajesh Munda (23) had to be hospitalised. Their condition was described as stable today.

 Lakra confirmed that the police were looking for two RIMS students, identified as Amit and Sanjeev, both of whom are allegedly absconding. Raids, Lakra said, would continue till the duo surrenders or is taken into custody.

 The road blockade, in support of the demand to arrest the medical students, disrupted traffic on Bariatu Road for the better part of Saturday. But what threatened to spill into a full-blown conflict between tribals and non-tribals, fortunately subsided after the assurance that the students would be charged with assault.

 The RIMS director has been informed and we have sought more details of the medical students named in the FIR, said the City SP. The situation had returned to normal, he claimed, with shops reopening and additional security forces withdrawn from the troubled area.

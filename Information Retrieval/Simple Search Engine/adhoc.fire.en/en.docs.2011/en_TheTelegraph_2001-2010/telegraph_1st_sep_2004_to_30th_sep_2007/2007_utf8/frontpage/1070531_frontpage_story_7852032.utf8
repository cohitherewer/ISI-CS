 Cop call on drug- amp;-rob racket

 RANJAN DASGUPTA

 Ranchi, May 30: A newly-wed couple are heading for Darjeeling for honeymoon by train. A well-dressed co-passenger soon befriends the couple. Later, the gentleman offers tea to them. He himself goes to the one end of the compartment to fetch it from a hawker. A few sips, the couple become unconscious and the gentleman decamps with their luggage.

 This five-minute skit prepared by the Railway Protection Force (RPF) headquarters of South Eastern Railways are being shown in televisions across all important stations. Further pamphlets printed in English, Hindi and Bengali are being distributed to commuters highlighting dont while travelling.

 The entire awareness programme is to make the gullible passengers aware of such anti-social elements posing as fellow passengers. And the programme would be continuous one, said the senior divisional safety commissioner of Ranchi, Ravindra Verma.

 Generally, these anti-socials use AT Vamm tablets or spray to make passengers unconscious. These tablets are dissolved in tea or cold drinks or mixed with cream biscuits.

 The problem, said senior RPF authorities, has reached gargantuan proportions and is showing signs of going out of hand. In Ranchi alone, 10 cases were reported in April where passengers were drugged and then looted. Similarly both Chakradharpur (under SE Railway) and Dhanbad divisions (under East Central Railway) too are befaced with this problem. Sources in RPF headquarters said in Jharkhand, the anti-socials involved in drugging passengers hail from hamlets in South 24 Parganas in Bengal and Jamtara district of Jharkhand.

 There are about 3 to 4 villages in both these areas where the male members are involved in such activities. They split in different groups and board different trains during evening and return home next day morning. And there is a tacit understanding between them and the unauthorised hawkers. Although arrests were made in the past, the goons were granted bail from court and again got involved in such activities.

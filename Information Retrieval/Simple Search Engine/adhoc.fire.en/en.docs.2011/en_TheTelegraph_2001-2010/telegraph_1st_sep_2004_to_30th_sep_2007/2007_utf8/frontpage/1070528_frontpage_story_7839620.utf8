 Just do it, Gogoi tells his DGP

 - ulfa and government in line of fire 

 OUR BUREAU 

 Guwahati, May 27: Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi was forced to do some introspection and tough talking at a function intended to blow his governments trumpet. 

 I have told my DGP and chief secretary that you will be held responsible... that you have to improve the law and order situation, he said today on the sidelines of a Judges Field rally organised by the government to mark a year of the Congress-led government. 

 The rally was meant to flaunt the achievements of his ministry, the police and the bureaucracy. But on a day marked by anti-government protests over more deaths in violence six died in the blast in Athgaon yesterday Gogoi was forced to focus on the sores, too.

 The chief minister admitted that the administration had been found wanting on the law and order front and said Delhi had been requested to send additional paramilitary forces. We are increasing the strength of our own police and also planning to take the help of ex-servicemen. We are doing everything possible to improve the situation, he told the media later. 

 The All Assam Students Union (AASU) observed Sunday as a black day in protest against Dispurs failure to prevent repeated acts of terror. Activists staged a sit-in at Latasil and hoisted black flags at Dispur, Ulubari, Maligaon and Chandmari to protest the blast in Athgaon. Samujjal Bhattacharyya, adviser to the AASU, led the demonstration. 

 Representatives of several other organisations, including the Purbottar Hindustani Sammelan, the co-ordination committee of different trade associations, and the Chandmari Mahila Samity participated in the protest. 

 Another sit-in demonstration involved members of 12 Opposition parties AGP (P), CPI, CPM, NCP, Purbanchaliya Loka Parishad and the Assam United Democratic Front. The AGP and the BJP were not represented. 

 The states premier educational institution Cotton College joined the chorus of protests by deciding to cancel all programmes on its 106th Foundation Day. 

 An unperturbed Gogoi seemed to endorse the spate of protests and bandhs. Asserting that his government was determined to improve the situation, Gogoi said acts of violence would not be able to cow down his government and appealed to the people to co-operate with the government in battling the menace. He even welcomed the 12-hour Kamrup district bandh called by the Kamrup Chamber of Commerce (KCC) tomorrow. 

 During the public rally, Gogoi said his government would deal with the situation with an iron hand. 

 AICC secretary Chandan Bagchi, who attended the rally, said Ulfa was playing into the hands of a foreign power out to destabilise Assam.

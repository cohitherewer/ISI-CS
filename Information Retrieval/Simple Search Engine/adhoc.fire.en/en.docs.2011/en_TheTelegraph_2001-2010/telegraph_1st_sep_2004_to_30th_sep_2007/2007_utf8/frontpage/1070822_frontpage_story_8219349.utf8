 Bhubaneswar, Aug. 21: At least 33 students were injured, five seriously, when a bus of an engineering college veered off the road and crashed into a low-lying field early this morning. 

 Fifty-five students, including 40 girls, from Orissa Engineering College (OEC) were on the bus when the mishap took place near Sunderpada village near Kaliasuni Square, 20km from here, around 7.45am. The five seriously injured students have been rushed to the SCB Medical College at Cuttack. 

 OEC located along Bhubaneswar-Jatni road at Nijigarh in Kurki has as many as 25 buses to take students daily from Bhubaneswar to the campus. This morning, the buses had started as usual for classes which were supposed to begin from 8am. 

 One of the buses had just crossed Kaliasuni when it took a sharp turn trying to avoid some cows on one side of the road. Its wheels slipped off the road and the vehicle rolled twice before coming to a halt on a field about 5m deep. 

 We were all falling over each other. There were screams, yells and crying, said Aditi Prasad (19), who suffered fractures on her left arm. Eyewitnesses said that rescuers from the Airfield police station reached the site soon after the accident. The skid marks indicated that the driver might have lost control, said Utkal Das, an officer in the Airfield police station. 

 College administrative officer Suprita Pattnaik said the five seriously injured were Aditi Prasad, Manisha Tiwari and Archana Jha from Ranchi and Supriya Mohapatra and Abhay Kumar from Orissa.

 Cap for cool and calm Dhoni

 Sept.18: Nobody will go on record, but a lack of support from key Board of Control for Cricket in India officials absolutely necessary for the captaincy scuppered Sourav Gangulys chances of leading again, this time in the upcoming ODIs.

 The selectors, as it turned out, took the least controversial step and promoted Twenty20 captain (and ODI vice-captain) Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

 At 26, he has age on his side and is respected for facing challenges head-on (like when Shoaib Akhtar was hurling grenades in the January 2006 Faisalabad Test) and being positive.

 Cool too.

 Sourav came into the picture last evening after a couple of those involved with the selection process began having second thoughts over burdening Dhoni. 

 Their argument: If the team did not do well in the seven ODIs against Australia and five versus Pakistan, then Dhonis confidence would take a beating, affecting his long-term prospects. 

 According to well-placed sources, the officials let it be known to the selectors that Dhoni would be backed even if the teams performance was found wanting. What was also conveyed, though not in as many words, is that the Sourav option should not be pursued.

 It is pretty well established that some in the BCCI have strong Sourav-specific reservations. Moreover, having got used to Rahul Dravid, they would not feel comfortable entertaining somebody with such a strong presence.

Seniormost pro Sachin Tendulkar ruled himself out once he told chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar that he would not be available for every ODI. 

 Strangely, Vengsarkar said: We did not offer the captaincy to anyone.

 Even if it is true, the BCCI ought to have clarified at the weekend itself when word spread quicker than the last bushfire that Sachin had been sounded out. 

 Dhonis appointment confirms that the captaincy is to be split this possibility was reported by The Telegraph last Saturday.

 Today, Sachin is the favourite to lead in the sports oldest form and Dhoni is sure to be vice-captain.

 Given the animosity towards Sourav, Indias most successful Test captain, hes unlikely to be in the frame two months from now.

 Indias first Test in the post-Dravid era is from November 22 against Pakistan in New Delhi.

 Dhoni, incidentally, is Indias only specialist wicketkeeper to get the captaincy full-time. Back in 1983-84, Syed Kirmani had captained in the Guwahati ODI versus the West Indies. That was in a stand-in capacity. 

 Look, Sourav is 35 and both Sachin and Rahul are 34 They arent getting any younger and have to be rotated We need a captain who is available for all matches That Dhoni had been vice-captain (for the ODIs) in Ireland, Scotland and England made him an automatic choice, Vengsarkar explained this evening. 

 All three former captains are in the squad for the first three ODIs against Australia. They wont, of course, be rested together.

 The obvious on-field challenges apart, in the dressing room, Dhoni has to be sensitive about the one-time captains and deputy Yuvraj Singh who, till a year ago, was talked about as Dravids successor.

 Given Dhonis mental make-up, only the very brave are going to bet he wont beat the odds.

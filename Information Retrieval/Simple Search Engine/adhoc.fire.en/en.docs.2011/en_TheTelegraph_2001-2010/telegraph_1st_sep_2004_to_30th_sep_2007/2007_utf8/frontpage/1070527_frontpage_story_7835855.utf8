 24-hour Kamrup bandh tomorrow 

 OUR BUREAU 

 Guwahati, 

 May 26: A bomb planted in an abandoned autorickshaw 

 went off with deadly precision in the heart of Guwahati 

 this morning. Seconds later, an LPG cylinder, being ferried 

 on a rickshaw, became the second bomb under the impact of 

 the first. Then all hell broke loose. 

 Six persons died and 28 were injured today in one of the deadliest militant attacks in the capital in recent times as the Ulfa targeted the citys business district with impunity once again. 

 The banned outfit planted the bomb in an autorickshaw parked by the side of S.C. Road, a narrow but busy street that connects a main thoroughfare, F.A. Road, with Kumarpara Paanchali, in Athgaon. The militants triggered the bomb with a timer device at 10.35 am, just when the area was starting to bustle with activity. Top police and administrative officials arrived at the scene soon after, sirens blazing and escorted by a posse of security personnel. 

 Senior superintendent of police (city) S.N. Singh said: The bomb was kept in an autorickshaw parked on the road. When it exploded, an LPG cylinder being carried on a cycle-rickshaw also exploded under the impact of the blast. This maximised the damage. 

 The victims were identified as Nirmal Dey, Md Anwar Hussain, Partha Shah, Mukram Ali and Nareswar Deka. The identity of the sixth could not be ascertained. 

 Two of the injured were admitted to Mahendra Mohan Choudhury Hospital while the rest were taken to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital. GMCH chief superintendent M.M. Deka said one of them was critical. 

 The growing fear and insecurity was fanned by a rumour that top Ulfa leader Jiten Dutta had warned of more attacks in the city in the next 72 hours.

 Twenty-one trade organisations, including the Kamrup Chamber of Commerce (KCC), have called a 24-hour bandh in undivided Kamrup district from 5 am on Monday in protest against the blast. The city unit of the AGP has extended support to the bandh. KCC president M.P. Jain said the trade organisations would also stage a daylong dharna at Mahavir Park on Monday. 

 The Tarun Gogoi government called off all cultural functions scheduled to be held at Judges Field tomorrow to mark the completion of one year in office. However, a public rally will be held as per schedule, sources in the chief ministers office said.

 Apart from top police and civil officials, former chief minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta and BJP leader Bijoya Chakraborty visited the blast site. Mahanta demanded an inquiry by a sitting Supreme Court judge into the recent explosions and adequate compensation for the victims.

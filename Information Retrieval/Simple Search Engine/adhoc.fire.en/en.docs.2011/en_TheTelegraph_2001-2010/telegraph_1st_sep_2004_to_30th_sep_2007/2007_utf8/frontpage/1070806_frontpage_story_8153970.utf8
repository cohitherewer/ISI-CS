 Bhubaneswar, Aug. 5: Heavy overnight rains threw normal life out of gear after a well-marked low pressure formed over the Bay of Bengal concentrated into a deep depression.

 It lay centred over the northwest Bay of Bengal about 230km south of Balasore till early this morning, Met officials said. 

 The depression was likely to intensify further and move in a westnorth direction to cross the Orissa-Bengal coast between Paradip and Digha tonight.

 Under its influence, the state is likely to receive heavy to very heavy rains during the next 48 hours, said the weathermen. Heavy to very heavy rains are likely to occur at a few places with extremely heavy rainfall measuring more than 25cm at isolated areas, said the officials. 

 At least 10 people were killed and several others injured due to lightning in the past couple of days. 

 Local cautionary signal number three have been hoisted at Paradip, Chandbali, Puri and Gopalpur. Fishermen have been warned against entering the sea, as it would remain rough to very rough. Bhubaneswar received 139.2mm rain today leaving many of the low-lying areas waterlogged.

 Roads at places like Nayapalli, Jaydev Vihar, Acharya Vihar, Saheed Nagar, Shatabdi Nagar, Munda Sahi, Shastri Nagar and Vanivihar remained waterlogged putting the residents of the area housebound. The municipality has been giving false promises all these days. The drains have overflown and solid waste is flowing inside our house. We havent been able to sleep since last night. I dont know what is going to happen if this continues for another day, said Sabita Beuria, a resident in the Saliasahi.

 My son is sick and wailing all day and we are not able to take him to a hospital even. The roads are so waterlogged that even an autorickshaw is unwilling to come this way, said Pranakrushna Pradhan, a Bermunda resident. Alipingal received the highest rainfall measuring 35cm followed by Cuttack at 33cm and Naraj at 27cm. 

 Four people died in Balasore yesterday, three members of a family were killed in Cuttack district. Three more people died in Puri district. The situation is expected to be worse in next week with the Met office predicting more rain in the next 48 hours accompanied by wind reaching 45-55kmph speed along and off the coast. 

 Disaster management minister Manmohan Samal said the administration was prepared to tackle the situation. He said undivided Cuttack, Puri and Ganjam districts were mostly affected.

 Samal, however, ruled out the possibility of any imminent flood in the major rivers stating that there was no heavy rainfall in upper catchment areas. Steps have been taken to evacuate water, shift marooned people to safer places and provide relief to them.

 House building assistance will be provided within 15 days to the people whose houses were damaged. While Rs 10,000 will be given to people having thatched houses, Rs 25,000 will be provided to the owners of the concrete houses damaged by flood, he said.

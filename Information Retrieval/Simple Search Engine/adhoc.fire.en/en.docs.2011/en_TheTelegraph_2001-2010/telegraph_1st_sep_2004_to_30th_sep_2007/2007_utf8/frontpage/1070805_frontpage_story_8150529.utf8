 Centre whip on foetus fiasco

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New 

 Delhi, Aug. 4: The Centre has ordered the Orissa 

 government to take action against quacks and errant doctors 

 responsible for illegal abortions, days after a mass abortion 

 racket was exposed in Nayagarh district. 

 An inquiry team of the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights has called the phenomenon of unauthorised clinics and doctors without licenses conducting abortions a malaise spread wide across Orissa. 

 In its report submitted to the ministry of women and child development, the two-member inquiry team has blamed Orissa government of doing almost nothing to stop the spread of such clinics. 

 On July 22, 30 bags with over 100 dead foetuses were recovered from a well next to a private clinic called Krishna Clinic in Nayagarh. 

 District police have arrested several doctors including at least two who work in government hospitals and raided several clinics that carry out abortions without a license. 

 The central team, though, said the response was too little and too late. The governments response now makes us optimistic, but it remains to be seen if they will continue to regularly monitor clinics that conduct abortions, Sandhya Bajaj, one of the members of the inquiry team, told The Telegraph. 

 The centre will evaluate the report that the state has been asked to send in a month before deciding on future action, officials said. 

 The Centre wants Orissa to set up a special task force under the states department of women and child welfare to regularly inspect clinics across the state. 

 The inquiry team, Bajaj said, came across several quacks, posing as doctors, conducting abortions in such clinics. 

 Orissas sex ratio, 976 girls to 1,000 boys in 1912, dropped to 926 to 1000 in 2001, according to central records. 

 A government survey conducted last year revealed that the ratio had nose-dived since the turn of the new millennium. 

 In 2006, Orissas sex ratio stood at a shocking 820 girls to 1,000 boys. 

 If what we saw continues, Orissa is likely to face severe social problems in the days to come, Bajaj said. 

 Low sex ratios, sociologists warn, can, in the long run, pave the way for a spurt in child marriages. 

 There are villages in Punjab, for instance, where I have witnessed parents of boys queuing up for a young bride, as waiting could mean their child ending up without any girl from the village, sociologist Divya Varun from Punjab University told The Telegraph.

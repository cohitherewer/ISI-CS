 Ad show axe on AXN

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Mumbai, Jan. 17: When the government is not monitoring racism in Big Brother House, it is playing the moral policeman at home the television channel AXN was banned today for obscenity. 

 I amp;B minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi announced the ban at a news conference.

 AXN styles itself as an action channel and carries programmes like the Fear Factor and the Amazing Race. But the ministry has taken offence to programmes like the Worlds Sexiest Commercials a collection of suggestive advertisements which, it says, are against good taste or decency and are likely to affect public morality.

 The ban, which comes into effect immediately, will be in force till March 15.

 I am very shocked. Its very upsetting news. All our channels are very respectful, and I dont know where this came from, said Sundar Aaron, AXNs Asia Head.

 The entertainment industry reacted sharply, with ad-filmmaker Prahlad Kakkar calling the ban ridiculous and filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt saying every government of the day wants to be seen to be taking care of the depravity that exists in the media. 

 It was a charge Das Munshi didnt seem to mind. Asked if the ban was not moral policing, he said the government should be moral.

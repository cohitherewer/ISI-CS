 Gujjar warning

 Pushkar, June 24: Gujjars have served an ultimatum on the Rajasthan govern- ment to forward to the Centre their demand for reservation.

 A convention has threatened to launch a wider agitation spanning several states if the demand is not met by September 4.

 Gathered from nine states in Pushkar for a show of solidarity with their community members from Rajasthan, the Gujjars warned the central BJP leadership of electoral setbacks if it did not replace Vasundhara Raje Scindia as Rajasthan chief minister.

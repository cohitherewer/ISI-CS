 Bypoll in end of August

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jamshedpur, July 24: The by-election to the Jamshedpur Lok Sabha seat will be held on August 29.

 The seat had fallen vacant following the assassination of JMM MP Sunil Mahto, who was gunned down at Baguria in Ghatshila subdivision of East Singhbhum on March 4.

 The notification for the by-election will be issued on August 3, the last date for nominations is August 10, the polling on August 29 and counting to be over by August 31. Electronic voting machines will be used in all the booths of the constituency. The election Commission also announced the model code of conduct has come into force with immediate effect in the district.

 The contest, which traditionally has been straight between the JMM and BJP, is likely to see the entry of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which had declared to field Salkhan Murmu.

 Though there has been no official announcement, the JMM is unanimous on Suman Mahto, the widow of the slain leader. There is apparently consensus among the UPA allies like Congress, RJD, Left, too. Last week a meeting of the UPAs district leaders had decided on the same.

 The BJP, which thinks the Jamshedpur bypoll will be a turning point in Jharkhand politics, is apparently divided over several names like Shailendra Mahto, Dineshanand Goswami and Dinesh Sarangi. State BJP general secretary Goswami expressed confidence that people of Jamshedpur would vote decisively in favour of his party as they are feeling disillusioned with the present UPA dispensation. Murmu, on his part, claims to have the backing of Dalit votes.

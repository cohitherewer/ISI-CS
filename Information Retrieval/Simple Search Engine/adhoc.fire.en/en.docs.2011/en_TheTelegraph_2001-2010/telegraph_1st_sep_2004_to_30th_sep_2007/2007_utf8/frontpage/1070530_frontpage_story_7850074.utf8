 America gets a tax break 

 JYOTI MALHOTRA AMP; ANIL BUDUR LULLA

 New Delhi/Bangalore, May 29: Forget the taxing nuke deal. Heres a soothing tax break.

 No one knows when India and America will finally wrap up their civil nuclear pact, but Delhi has come up with a move that is bound to smooth ruffled diplomatic feathers on either side of the Atlantic.

 To fix a spat that was threatening to snowball into an ugly feud with Washington, the Centre has exempted all accredited diplomats from paying tax on as many as 96 services.

 The notification issued on May 23 by the finance ministrys revenue department via the protocol division of the ministry of external affairs is applicable across the board to all diplomatic missions and consular offices in India.

 This is the first time that the finance ministry has announced such wide-ranging tax exemption on services that include airline tickets, credit cards, tourism-related taxes, promotional events, shopping and beauty parlours.

 So what triggered the generosity? 

 Delhis enormous diplomatic corps can thank the US.

 A few months ago, foreign office sources said, the Americans had complained that India was levying a series of taxes on its diplomats. Though the envoys were exempt from certain taxes, they still had to pay tax on a variety of services. 

 On the other hand, Indian diplomats in the US didnt even pay sales tax, an umbrella tax levied on Americans. US officials argued that the Indian service tax was against the spirit of reciprocity.

 But when Delhi didnt make amends, Washington, a few months ago, withdrew the sales tax exemption for Indian diplomats. That meant the Indian diplomats, accustomed to tax-free luxuries, had to start living like ordinary mortals. A diplomatic storm started brewing across the Atlantic.

 Delhi retaliated by withdrawing all tax exemptions for US diplomats.

 The Karnataka government was the first off the mark when, on April 1, it amended the Karnataka Tax on Luxuries Act, 1979.

 State commercial taxes commissioner B.A. Harish Gowda had then said the notification was in line with the Centres directive and applicable only to US diplomats.

 The envoys had to pay 12 per cent luxury tax on lodging, 20 per cent on hotel facilities like health clubs, beauty parlours and business services as well as for using the swimming pool.

 The Centre advised all states to withdraw exemptions to American diplomats as their Indian counterparts did not enjoy reciprocal concessions in the US, Gowda said.

 But that was before the May 23 notification.

 When the taxes paid by the Indian diplomats began to hurt, Delhi amended the service tax regime for the entire diplomatic corps in India.

 Antony no to army 

act repeal

 SUJAN DUTTA 

 Rangapahar (Nagaland) Jan. 10: The defence ministry has practically ruled out a repeal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act in the wake of the Assam carnage and the decision to give the army sweeping powers in a renewed drive against Ulfa. 

 Defence minister A.K. Antony said here at the headquarters of the armys 3 Corps that when our soldiers are operating in such difficult situations, they need special protection. We are in consultations with the home ministry to give it (the army act) a human touch. 

 I am just coming from Assam where more than 60 people have been killed, quot; he added. He also said that despite cordial relations with Myanmar, it was too early to speculate on a Bhutan-type operation against militants based in that country. The issue has been taken up with Bangladesh through several channels, he added.

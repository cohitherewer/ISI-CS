 Bhubaneswar, Aug. 1: All 

 was well with the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation- driven 

 Clean City Green City project until a little 

 saffron stepped in. 

 The city was being painted green, with dustbins, sheds, hoarding and much-hyped vending zones all displaying shades of green. That is, until this Monday, when the vending zone at the ward belonging to deputy mayor Urmila Mohapatra (BJP) displayed an unfamiliar colour saffron. 

 The vending zone on the Power House Square had neared completion and the cabins had already been painted green when on Monday evening a group of men drove in and started collecting money from the 40-odd vendors. They collected around Rs 1.8 lakh from vendors and public alike, alleged the president of the vending association, Pratap Sahu. 

 Some of the men reportedly went back and returned with paint boxes. After asking the vendors to shut down their shops, they reportedly started repainting. When we returned the next morning, the cabins wore a new look, said Prakash Hota, a vendor. 

 The regions vendors are feeling more lost after an official from the BMC told them that the colour would change to green again. 

 The already panicky vendors have received instructions to oppose anyone who tries to bring green back. They (the men) have asked us to protest if the colour is changed. Otherwise we would be removed and the sheds would be re-allotted to some other vendors. The matter is confusing, said Sahu.

 Poor vendors like us are at the receiving end of such political games. The matter should be immediately sorted out between those concerned, said Sahu. However, no complaint has been lodged with the police. 

 Jankiballabh Martha (56), who went through great trouble before finding a cabin for herself is spending sleepless nights. I have seen how vendors have used all means and party affiliations to get cabins. Others who had no contacts have been left out. I was lucky to get one without much fuss but if this continues, I have nowhere to go, rued a lost Martha. 

 The association leaders today met the commissioner to discuss the matter. While the deputy mayor refused to comment on the issue, municipality commissioner Aparajita Sarangi said she was aware of the incident. 

 However, the colour choice depends entirely on the areas vendors. Any colour is welcome, but it should have green with it. Green is a must, as the BMC has been calling it a green drive, she explained. 

 Of the 47 corporators in the municipality, 15 are from BJP. And grapevines report that the vending zones, set up at different wards, would soon sport an orange tinge. 

 The BMC that has a target of 50 vending zones in the city has already set up 29. These would provide space for 5,000 of the total 22,000 vendors of the city. Plans to rehabilitate the other vendors are underway, said the commissioner.

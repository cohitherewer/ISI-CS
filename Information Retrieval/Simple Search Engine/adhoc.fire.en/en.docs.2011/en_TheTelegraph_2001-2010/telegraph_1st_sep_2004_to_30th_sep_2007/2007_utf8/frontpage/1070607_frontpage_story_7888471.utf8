 Hill killings unite parties

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Nagaon, June 6: The murders of Purnendu Langthasa and two of his colleagues in the North Cachar Hills Autonomous Council have temporarily united the troubled districts political parties.

 As security forces began a manhunt for the killers, the Autonomous State Demand Committee and the BJP called a 10-hour bandh tomorrow to protest Mondays killings. 

 The ASDC and the BJP, however, opposed the indefinite postponement of elections to the autonomous council, saying it was tantamount to undermining democracy.

 The Jewel Gorlosa faction of the Dima Halam Daogah killed Purnendu, chief executive member of the autonomous council, along with colleague Nindu Langthasa. Another executive member, Ajit Bodo, was abducted and shot the same day.

 Hundreds of people participated in a condolence meeting at the ASDC office in Haflong town today. Opposition leaders later sent a memorandum to Governor Ajai Singh through deputy commissioner Anil Kumar Borua, seeking an inquiry into the killings. 

 In neighbouring Karbi Anglong, police last night gunned down two militants suspected of playing a role in the ambush in which four policemen were killed on Sunday. Militants of the Karbi Longri North Cachar Liberation Front were behind the attack.

 The two rebels died during exchange of fire with a police team near Sarpo Tissu village, under Manja police station. About eight militants hiding in a jungle at the entry point of Sarpo Tissu fired at the police team when they were passing by. The police retaliated and the exchange of fire lasted 15 minutes. A 9mm pistol was found at the site.

 Capital blast plot foiled

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Dec. 31: Police claimed to have blown a plot to set off bomb blasts in the capital with the arrest of two alleged Lashkar-e-Toiba militants on New Years Eve.

 Samiullah (34) and Ali Mohammad (26), both said to be from Kashmir, were caught outside the New Delhi railway station as they were moving towards the busy Paharganj area, the scene of a pre-Diwali blast last year, to plant bombs.

 Paharganj is barely a kilometre from Connaught Place, a traditional site for New Year celebrations.

 Two improvised explosive devices were seized from the duo who arrived from Jammu by the Andaman Express, said Karnal Singh, joint commissioner of police (special cell). 

 We had intelligence inputs and were keeping a close watch. Two taxi drivers helped us arrest them, Singh said.

 With the help of Gypsy, an Alsatian, the bomb disposal squad found the first bomb in the heap of toys the militants were carrying after nearly an hour of search. It was packed inside a plastic toy racing car. 

 Singh, who inspected the explosives packed inside the toy car with shrapnel, said: It looks like plastic explosive lethal enough to kill people in a radius of 8-10 metres.

 Samiullah and Ali Mohammad, who got off the train at 5.25 pm, had planned to place the two bombs in the crowded Paharganj market and board the train again.

 They had tickets till Chennai, the last stop of the train, and were to use the 45 minutes it was to halt at the New Delhi railway station to plant the bombs.

 The bombs would have exploded long after the train had left the station. 

 They were carrying at least two dozen toys and had marked two of the packs that had the explosives and timer devices.

 Calcutta, March 12: To intensify its fight against the Jharkhand administration and the police, the CPI(Maoist) leadership has decided to strengthen the organisations action squad the wing that oversees the Naxalite outfits armed strikes.

 And for this, the heads of the outfit have decided to join hands with other ultra-Left factions active in foreign countries. 

 The decision was taken during the ninth congress of the organisation, comprising the central committee members and more than 100 delegates from 16 states deep inside the forest of Dandakaranya an area known as Maoists guerrilla zone after a gap of 36 years.

 In the congress, which started in the last week of January and continued till February 6, Ganapati was re-elected as the partys all-India general secretary and Kishanji as head of central military commission.

 According to reports available with intelligence wings, the decision of killing Jamshedpur MP Sunil Mahto, too, was finalised during the course of the meeting. 

 After observing a two-minute silence for the death of two of their comrades central committee member Chandramouli alias Naveen and his wife Karuna Ganapati called for an armed movement in Jharkhand in a bigger way to teach Jharkhand police and other forces a lesson. 

 A decision to join hands with other outfits in Nepal, Philippines, Turkey and Peru where armed resistance is on against the respective governments was taken.

 They are following our route and we need to work together. Therefore, we need to upgrade our armoury with their help by importing sophisticated arms and gadgets for under-cover communication, Ganapati is believed to have said.

 According to reports available with intelligence wings of Bengal and Jharkhand police, three companies of action squad protected the venue of the congress.

 Revealing more, the intelligence bureau in Calcutta said a strategy had been adopted at the congress to strengthen armed movement at Somadih, Gumandih, Koy- ra, Mokro and Chamta areas, where police vigil had been intensified in the recent past. 

 As part of their strike back, the Maoists abducted one Shankar Singh and Hutu Singh from Somadih village, whom they suspect as police informers. The duo was produced before a peoples court where they were beaten up severely and were forced to give in writing that they would never interact with the police, said an IB official.

 As part of their armed movement, a decision to change the style of guerrilla attack was adopted. 

 But what their new war strategy will be is not known to us, the IB official in Calcutta conceded.

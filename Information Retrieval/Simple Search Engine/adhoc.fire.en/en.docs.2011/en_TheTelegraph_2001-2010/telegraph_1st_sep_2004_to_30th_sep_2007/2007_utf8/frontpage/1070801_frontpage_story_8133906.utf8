 Sentenced to 6 years, sobbing Sanjay in jail 

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

Mumbai,

 July 31: The iron gates clanged shut behind the prisoner, but they could not drown out the chant from the jail barracks: Munnabhai aala re (here comes Munnabhai).

 A lone voice from behind strove desperately to put courage into Bhaiyya even as the speakers own seemed to be deserting her.

 Sister and MP Priya Dutt expecting her second child and other family members were seeing off a sobbing Sanjay Dutt, just handed six years rigorous imprisonment in the Bombay blasts case for the eminently dangerous act of keeping an AK-56 and a 9mm pistol.

 The actors escorts eight policemen and the court registrar were in no mood for sentimental scenes. It was 6.20 in the evening and they were in a hurry. Sanjay and his friend Yusuf Nullwala had to be inside their cells before the high-security Arthur Road Jail downed its hatch at 6.30.

 A lesser being than the movie star would have had to miss his dinner, a jail employee said.

 But arrangements have been made for our dear Munnabhai, he winked. It is well-known that even in high-security jails, a special bandobast can always be managed.

 Sanjay will have an entire cell to himself at Barrack No. 1, where his next-door neighbour will be Praveen Mahajan, accused of shooting dead his brother and former Union minister Pramod last year.

 The judge said Sanjay should not be kept with hardened criminals but in a proper place with all facilities. His family would be allowed to come and meet him, the actors lawyer, Satish Maneshinde, told reporters.

 The 6.30pm shutters-down, though, is non-negotiable even for Munnabhai, whose leniency plea was shot down by the court that pointed to his past hobnobbing with D-company gangsters.

 On a day Sanjay swung from hope to utter despair within seconds just as millions of his fans did across the country judge Pramod Kode let off co-accused Russi Mulla on probation but showed no mercy to an actor who got friends to do his dirty work.

 By encouraging others to perform criminal acts, Sanjay had shown a high element of criminality, Kode said, handing out a Rs 25,000 fine as well and bringing the curtains down on the 14-year-long trial.

 Sanjay will serve only four-and-a-half years in jail because he has already spent 18 months behind bars.

 Bollywood stood behind its own today, with Amitabh Bachchan reacting from a remote location in Andhra Pradesh: Very sad and depressing news.

 Sanjays lawyers will move the Supreme Court for relief as soon as they receive the operative order of the sentence, expected tomorrow. After an appeal is filed, it takes at least two days for the matter to come up for hearing. 

 We are sad and think the judgment is harsh, Maneshinde said. (But) we had prepared him (for jail).

 Sanjay, though, was in tears after the sentencing and, when his plea for a delayed surrender fell through, he appeared shattered.

 A sympathetic Kode granted the actor a private meeting with his family right away.

 The registrars room was vacated and Sanjay and his sisters Namrata and Priya stayed inside with their husbands, Kumar Gaurav and Owen Roncon, a court source said. From outside the closed doors, we could hear his wails.

 Sanjays lawyers, too, left the family alone in their difficult private moments.

 They were in the registrars room for about 20 minutes. When they came out, the registrar asked them to hurry up, Maneshinde said.

 Sanjay and his escorts walked towards the jail. Priya, Namrata and their husbands followed them with us.

 The 200-odd policemen guarding the court and jail held the media at bay.

 Sanjay suddenly turned to look back towards his sisters. They rushed to him and held him in a hug.

 As the actor put a foot gingerly inside the jail gates, Priya cried out from behind him: Bhaiyya, be strong.

 The iron gates slammed shut in response.

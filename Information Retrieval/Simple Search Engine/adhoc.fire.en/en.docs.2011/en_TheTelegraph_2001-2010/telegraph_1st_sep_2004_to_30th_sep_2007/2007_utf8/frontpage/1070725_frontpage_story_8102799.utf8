 Review hope on Madhyamik 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 24: A high court order today threw open the possibility of making all Madhyamik candidates not just failed students as is the practice now eligible for reassessment.

 A judge directed the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education to produce the English answer script of a successful Madhyamik student for reassessment.

 The rules of the board have no provision for reassessment of successful candidates. Such examinees can only apply for post-publication scrutiny which means they can check for mistakes in totalling the marks in a subject or whether all answers have been examined. 

 Todays order came on a petition by Arnab Jyoti Mallik, who passed Madhyamik 2007 with 82 per cent marks. But Mallik scored only 51 per cent in English, following which he moved court. 

 We have no provision for reassessment of successful candidates, board lawyer Tulshi Das told the court.

 But Billwadal Bhattacharya, the students lawyer, said: My client will consider that his answer script is either lost or damaged if the board is unable to produce it.

 Justice Biswanath Somadder then asked the board to produce the script in 15 days. I can see the petitioner has scored 51 per cent in English but the marks scored in all the other subjects are higher. I want to see why he is not satisfied with his English marks, the judge said.

 An appeal against a reassessment order in the higher secondary examinations is pending.

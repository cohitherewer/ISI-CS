 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, May 2: Bangalore-based IT company Mindtree Consulting Pvt. Ltd., a manager of computer networks for customers including Pfizer Inc. and Sony Corp. recently said its proposed software development centre in Bhubaneswar will be operational by the end of 2008.

 After signing an MoU with the Orissa government in March last year, the company co-headquartered in Bangalore and Somerset, New Jersey, has moved swiftly to acquire 20 acres at Infocity.

 COO Subroto Bagchi, who was here for inducting 200 new recruits, said construction work on the development centre will start within 4-6 months. The campus will be futuristic and environment-friendly. In style and grandeur, it will be sort of a tourist destination.

 The Mindtree COO further said the development centre would be bigger than its Bangalore campus, but refused to put a figure to the investment his company would make here. It will be substantial, he said. This hub will be its sixth development centre. Mindtree is the fifth biggest IT player to have zeroed in on Bhubaneswar after Infosys, Satyam, TCS and Wipro.

 Scurry for probe after phone scare

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, May 22: A panicky Congress dialled P for probe after the addresses of subscribers of over a dozen mobile phone connections used by militants in recent months turned out to be Rajiv Bhawan, the state party headquarters.

 Reliance and BSNL, the two mobile service providers that had sold these connections, have also launched independent investigations. 

 The army seized the mobile phones from militants of Ulfas 28 Battalion last week. The army kept the incident under wraps until last night, when it was selectively leaked to the vernacular media. 

 The police were in the dark about the development, at least officially, even today. I am not aware of any such development, inspector-general of police (law and order) D.K. Pathak said. 

 There was, however, no way the ruling Congress could plead ignorance about the armys findings. Reports said the mobile phone numbers used by militants to contact extortion targets were in the names of members of the PCC, the Youth Congress and the National Students Union of India.

 Sources said PCC chief Bhubaneswar Kalita would be leading the inquiry. Kalita was unavailable for comment. Other senior party leaders were also incommunicado.

 Those who opened up did so after requesting anonymity. One Congress member said the party had already sought details of the proxy numbers from the two mobile service providers. If the internal inquiry reveals that there is some truth in the media reports, the party will consider handing over the case to the police for proper action, he added.

 C.R. Deka, head of Reliances Northeast operations, said the company would provide details of the subscribers to whom the numbers were issued if the government officially sought any such information. 

 We have all the relevant details. We issued the numbers after proper verification of addresses and the credentials of the subscribers. If a SIM card changes hands after we have issued it, we are in no way responsible for it, he said. 

 The chief general manager of BSNLs Assam Telecom Circle, G. Rajaram, confirmed having instituted a departmental inquiry to probe the veracity of the media reports. Like Deka, he said BSNL always verifies the credentials and addresses of applicants for mobile connections before issuing numbers. 

 We have to find out what has actually happened. If a number is issued to a person and a specific address, the person ought to be there. We do physical verification before giving a number, he said. 

 But another telecom official said breach of rules was not a rarity. During elections, politicians apply for and get connections out-of-turn. The applications come on letterheads of political parties. 

 Subscribers of BSNLs CellOne service today received an SMS asking them to ensure that their mobile phones do not fall into the hands of antisocial elements.

 However, Rajaram denied that the SMS was a reaction to media reports on militants using SIM cards issued to people associated with the Congress. It is a mere coincidence. A decision to circulate this message was taken a few days ago, he said.

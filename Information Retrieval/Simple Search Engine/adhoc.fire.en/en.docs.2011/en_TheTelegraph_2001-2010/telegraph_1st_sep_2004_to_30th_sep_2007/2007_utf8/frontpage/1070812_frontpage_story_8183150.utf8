 Calcutta, Aug 12 (PTI): A blast ripped through the international fast food chain McDonald's in the posh Park Street area of the metropolis today, leaving two persons injured and damaging parts of the building. Police are yet to establish if the incident is linked to a terrorist plot. 

 Unconfirmed reports say two persons died, one of them a milkman who was passing by.

 The impact of the blast was so intense that window screens of cars parked in the vicinity were smashed and glass panes and wooden panels of the building were damaged, police said.

 Two persons were injured in the incident that occurred at 9:40 AM. They were rushed to SSKM hospital where the condition of one person was stated to be critical, police said.

 Fire brigade sources said three fire tenders had rushed to the spot. They were ascertaining whether an explosion in cooking gas cylinders sparked off the blast. The area has been cordoned off and traffic diverted. 

 Passersby said that the blast occurred from an AC compressor.

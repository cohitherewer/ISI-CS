 Lady in distress left in lurch

 RAJ KUMAR

 Ranchi, June 15: It is common knowledge that a loot victim expresses concern over cash and valuables lost, but a widow, who was looted at her residence in Chutia today, expressed concern over non-cooperation of the people in her neighbourhood. 

 Durgakant Prajapati, a private schoolteacher, was robbed of Rs 15,000 in cash and Rs 1.5 lakh worth of jewellery by a group of eight criminals at New Muckun Toli in Chutia police station.

 It was around 1am when Prajapati was sleeping alone at her residence, that the goons struck. They broke open the front door and entered the room where a steel almirah containing ornaments and other valuables were kept. 

 They decamped with the cash and other valuables after an hour-long rummaging. 

 The widow, who was locked from outside during the operation, raised an alarm and clanged steel dishes to alert the neighbours. 

 But no one reportedly turned up to help the lady in distress.

 The residents in the locality reached the spot only this morning, said the lady. 

 She lodged an FIR today accompanying her nephew Anil Prasad from Dangra Toli to Chutia police station.

 Prajapati, in her statement before the police, expressed concern over the non-cooperation of her locality.

 I am not as concerned about the cash and valuables as I am over the passive attitude of the society around me, which did not respond to my calls for help when the goons were plundering my house, the officer in charge of Chutia police station, Mohammed Nehal, quoted the lady as saying.

 The schoolteachers concern about the passiveness of the society is not baseless though.

 Earlier, a freelance photojournalist from Patna, Deepak Kumar, had shared the same experience with The Telegraph about how he was attacked by four armed criminals, who looted his camera and cash at gunpoint in the same police station area last Friday.

 Other than a rickshawpuller, no one came forward to help me after I raised an alarm when the goons were fleeing with my belongings, leaving me injured around 8.50am in front of the South Eastern Railway Stadium, said the photographer.

 Kumar, who had been staying in the state capital for the past two days to cover a story on the impact of delimitation process in the state, was going to his friends house in the Railway Colony from a nearby hotel when he was robbed and left to fend for himself.

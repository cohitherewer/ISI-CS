 Gangrape inquiry ordered

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bokaro, July 8: The deputy inspector-general of the coalbelt, Anurag Gupta, and the Bokaro superintendent of police, Priya Dubey, have ordered an inquiry into an alleged rape of a minor tribal girl by three police officers of Nawadih police station on June 27. 

 Meanwhile, villagers of Jarwatola of Deggadda panchayat have written to National Human Rights Commission, chief minister Madhu Koda, director-general of police and the home minister alleging that a 15-year-old girl was physically tortured in late evening and sexually abused during an anti-search operation in the Naxalite belt. The villagers allegedly remained mute spectators fearing the power of the police.

 The victim, a resident of the Jarwatola village, alleged that the police raided her house at 9pm and caught hold of her father Mihilal, asking him for details of Maoists of the village and adjacent areas.

 When she and her father told the officials that they did not know about any one, her father was allegedly stripped and given a good beating. Later, three policemen, including the officer in charge of Nawadih police station took me to a nearby bush in the deep forest about 200m from my house. After stripping me, they raped me one by one till I became unconscious, said the girl, still under treatment. 

 Phulmani revealed that the officers threatened to frame her in a false police case if she related the matter to the villagers. 

 Nawadih police station OC Pramod Kumar said that the allegation is baseless.

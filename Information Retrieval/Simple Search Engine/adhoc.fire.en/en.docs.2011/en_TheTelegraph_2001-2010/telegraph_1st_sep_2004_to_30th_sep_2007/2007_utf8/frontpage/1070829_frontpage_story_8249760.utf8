 KYKL wild justice for govt official

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Imphal, Aug. 28: Militants of the Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup (KYKL) shot at a senior official of the Manipur secondary education board this afternoon. 

 Phurailatpam Nandakumar Sharma, joint secretary of the Board of Secondary Education, Manipur, was injured in his left knee. 

 The outfit accused Sharma of indulging in corruption, swindling public money and manipulating documents to illegally occupy the board secretarys post. 

 Sharma is currently under suspension over anomalies in appointments of some employees hired on a contract basis by the school board. He was secretary in-charge when the Ibobi Singh government placed him under suspension. Before the suspension, he was demoted to the post of joint secretary. 

 The outfit told reporters that activists of its special task force, which is engaged in cleansing the states education system under Operation New Kangleipak, found the official guilty of the charges after a thorough investigation by an intelligence team of the outfit. 

 The outfit said its members fired a bullet into the officials left knee as a punishment for his crimes at an undisclosed location in the hills this afternoon. 

 Police sources said that they heard unofficial news about the attack, but could not confirm the report right now.

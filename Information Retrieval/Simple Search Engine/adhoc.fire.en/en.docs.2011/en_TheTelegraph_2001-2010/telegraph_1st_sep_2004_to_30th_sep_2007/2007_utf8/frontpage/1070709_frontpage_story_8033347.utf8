 Chandan, a software engineer working with Satyam, had married Sridevi Mishra on March 11 this year. But in less than four months time Chandan (28) and his family allegedly started torturing the girl for dowry.

 In her complaint to the city Mahila police station, she alleged that she was continuously pestered for more dowry. Hailing from a well-to-do- family, Sridevi had brought along goods worth Rs 10 lakh along with a plot at Bhubaneswar. However, my in-laws kept pestering for a Honda City, she alleged.

 Sridevi said that she married Chandan whose claim to fame was last years Babu I Love You because his looks matched Anubhavs, said to be the numero uno of Oriya film industry.

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 9: Skidding on sand, a call centre employees bike veered into the path of an onrushing bus that crushed him to death on EM Bypass and sped away tonight.

 Ananth Hariharan, 36, was heading to the HSBC call centre in Salt Lake with a colleague after dining at a restaurant when the accident occurred around 8pm.

 The motorbike on which Ananth and his colleague Austin Bernard were travelling apparently veered off course after hitting a mound of sand near the Paroma bend. The sand was piled there for widening of the road.

 Phillip Gomes, a friend who was following the duo on another bike, told police that Ananth lay on the road for nearly 30 minutes. Gomes tried to flag down several vehicles but none stopped, the police quoted him as saying.

 Gomes eventually managed to hail a taxi and took them to Apollo Hospital, where Ananth was declared bought dead. Ananth, a bachelor, lived in Gariahat.

 Bernard, 31, who was riding pillion, escaped with a few cuts and bruises. 

 Sand has been piled along the road for the bypass extension work. As they ringed the island, the bike hit the sand and lost control briefly. Just then, the bus hit the bike from behind. The bus seemed to have been travelling at high speed and couldnt slow down at the bend, said an official at the Paroma police outpost.

 Were trying to trace the bus, which sped away after hitting them, the official added.

 Authorities at Apollo said Ananths skull was crushed. It is not known if he was wearing a helmet or whether the protective gear came off after he was thrown off the bike.

 Shanti Nandi, Ananths sister, said their mother had not been told about her sons death till late tonight. The mother is 66 years old and suffered a paralytic stroke six months ago. The family hails from south India but has been living in Calcutta for the past 40 years.

 Politics of protest, home amp; away 

100-hr wheel jam ends in 36 hours 

 OUR BUREAU 

 Kokrajhar/Guwahati, May 25: Assam was reconnected by rail and road to the rest of the country today after 36 hours of blockade-imposed uncertainty for outbound train passengers and vehicles stranded along different points on national highways 31 and 56.

 The wheel jam was to have continued for 100 hours, but the former Bodo militants behind the blockade agreed to curtail it after chief minister Tarun Gogoi promised to look into their complaints against the National Democratic Front of Boroland. The government will hold two rounds of talks with them, beginning Monday.

 Confirmation about rail services being fully restored was not immediately available, though a few trains originating in Guwahati made delayed starts yesterday itself. Sources said traffic on the national highways connecting Assam to Bengal started moving immediately after the blockade was officially suspended at 5 pm.

 Trucks laden with goods were stranded on highways in Kokrajhar, Udalguri, Baksa and Chirang districts since 5 am yesterday.

 The immediate provocation for calling the marathon rail-cum-road blockade was the killing of a former member of the Bodo Liberation Tigers (BLT) along with three civilians in Sonitpur district recently. In a memorandum to the chief minister yesterday, the organisation of former militants said the government must abrogate its ceasefire with the NDFB. 

 Delhi is also a party to the truce, which took effect in 2005. 

 But the Centre today extended the ongoing ceasefire with the NDFB for a period of another six months with effect from June 1. 

 Janamohan Mushahary, chairman of the Ex-Bodo Liberation Tigers Welfare Society, said NDFB members had been repeatedly violating the ceasefire and getting away with it. He said the Bodoland Territorial Council formed after the erstwhile Bodo Liberation Tigers signed an accord with Delhi and Dispur had complained to the government about it on several occasions. 

 The NDFB countered the allegations by accusing the former militants of politicising the loss of human lives. S. Sanjarang, the NDFB spokesman, said no member of the militant group was involved in the Sonitpur killings. 

 He asked the forum of former militants to ascertain facts instead of creating confusion in the minds of the people about the NDFB. 

 We appeal to them not to blame anybody for any incident without properly enquiring what happened and how. We also appeal to them not to harness their political agenda out of human tragedy, Sanjarang said. 

 In another development, a clash broke out at Routa in Udalguri district over ex-BLT members seizing some vehicles. Sources said trouble started when a team from the All Bodo Students Union went to the house of Gereb alias Sansuma Basumatary, a former BLT leader, to retrieve 25 seized vehicles. 

 An argument led to the student activists allegedly ransacking Basumatarys house. 

 The group also damaged two vehicles, Basumatarys Maruti Alto and another owned by BTC executive member Mitaram Basumatary.

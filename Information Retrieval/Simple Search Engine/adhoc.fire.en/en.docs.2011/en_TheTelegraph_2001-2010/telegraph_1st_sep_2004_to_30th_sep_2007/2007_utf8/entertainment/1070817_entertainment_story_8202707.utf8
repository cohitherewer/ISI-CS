 Say it with soul

 Though the Monday rains threatened to wash away the US Consulate General and Spandan-sponsored My Soul is a Witness, the plays director Alex Levy was just happy to be in Calcutta for the first time. 

 Levy was certain that his troupe Pegasus Players and the Calcutta audience would bond, and indeed they did. The show was at Gyan Manch, 7pm. 

 Pegasus Players, from the ethnically diverse Chicago Uptown area, began its journey in June 1978. Thanks to those first few who took this tremendous risk of beginning theatre in a place where no regional theatre existed, recalled Levy, who was born in Chicago and has been with the group for over nine years. All the action was in New York, said Levy, and if the Uptown area wanted to see theatre it had to be brought from New York. In 1979, Pegasus Players found a rented space. Soon other groups came up. Now there are more than 100 and Chicago is a fantastic theatre city. 

 At Pegasus, each play completes a season of eight weeks before it is changed. They do all kinds of plays musical, comedies and serious reaching out to everyone. To nurture new talent for the American stage, Pegasus hires guest directors and technicians, and holds open auditions for each production. From Broadway musicals by the likes of Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine to addressing racial, political and discrimination issues, Pegasus has done it all. 

 Levy believes Chicago theatre has a character of its own. If New York has the talented actors, faces that you see on the boards at every show, and Los Angeles has the prettiest and most charismatic ones, Chicago has its ensembles. It is never I, here it is we.

 My Soul is a Witness by David Barr III deals with the civil rights movement. It resurrects Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and President John F. Kennedy and hundreds of other lesser noticed people of incredible courage. Levy said he had deliberately avoided sets and costume for this production so as to strip it down to the bare essentials. He had five actors playing many parts. 

 So what next for Pegasus? After a show in Mumbai and one in Delhi we go back and will in due time begin our next production, Jitney by Augustus Wilson, said Levy. 

 Jitney focuses on the community life in an African-American neighbourhood in contemporary Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where the unlicensed taxi drivers or jitney drivers are common.

 on whats on her mind and body

 My favourite outfit: 

 A pair of jeans. I love wearing jeans because I can give 

 them a casual as well as a semi-formal look. My tops keep 

 changing depending on my mood

 For evening wear: I 

 would choose an Armani suit or a sari if its an award 

 function. I would also sport a nice salwar-kameez for formal 

 occasions

 Nightwear: I 

 take extra effort while picking up my nightwear. It makes 

 me feel so much of a woman

 A sari; I can really carry it off well. I love authentic 

 saris like Benarasi and chiffons

 My favourite colours: 

 Red, black and white. In winter, I prefer beige 

 and neutral colours

 I have a fetish for: 

 Shoes. I have over 200 pairs. I dont pick up shoes 

 from India as I feel we havent mastered the art of 

 making them. Occasionally, however, I do pick up a pair 

 from Rinaldi

 Dior, Gucci, Fendi

 My handbag contains: 

 Credit cards, a wallet, a dairy, a mobile and its charger.

 The most expensive outfit 

 I have bought: A Gucci gown and then my black Armani 

 suit

 Gucci Envy

 My hairstyle at home is: 

 Simple. I like to tie up my hair. I hate doing 

 anything fancy to my hair

 A man whose hair I admire 

 is: Shaan. His hair is so silky, I tell him he 

 has no business to have such beautiful hair

 Breathe 

in bliss

 Aromatherapy expert Blossom Kochhar talks to t2 about the India Open Cup and more. 

 Sushmita Sen, says Blossom, is a complete aromatherapy person

Blossom Kochhar, beauty and aromatherapy expert, was in town recently to throw light on a rather unique competition India Cup Open 2007, a showdown of professional hairdressers and beauticians, organised by National Hairdressers and Beauticians Association (NHBA). To be held at the India Expo Centre Expo XXI, Greater Noida, on December 4, it will see snipping and styling with speed and skill being put to the test. Excerpts from the chat t2 had with Kochhar, the founder-chairman of NHBA 

 What are the highlights of India Cup Open?

 There are seven categories including Trend Salon Cut and Style for men and women that is basically street fashion. Long Hair Up is one category that I think will be popular as Indians are experts at it! We also have Full Fashion Look for men and women. The whole look should go together. Nail art with acrylic, paint and Swarovski is becoming very popular, so we have included this in the competition. We have also introduced a mehndi category.

 Though people from India are participating in styling competitions abroad, I think they need to gain confidence. Most of them are nervous about entering a competition. This will give them exposure. We also have plans of making it an international event in the future. 

 The competition is open only to professionals across the country. The grand champion gets to go to Chicago in March 2008 to compete in OMC (Organisation Mondiale Coiffure) Hairworld. 

 Contestants can sign up on September 26, at the Calcutta road show.

 How big is OMC?

 OMC is 60 years old. Every two years there is the OMC Hairworld. It is a very prestigious contest. They have many more categories there. You have to finish your style very fast in 20 minutes. That is one of the areas that Indian hairdressers need to work on. We want to host OMC Hairworld 2012. For that we have to be ready for bidding in 2007.

 Whats Indias styling capital?

 Mumbai People in Calcutta have promise but they have not shown off their talent. I think you have some really good long-hair stylists here.

 Top tips for wannabe stylists?

 Practise, practise, practise. Choose the model carefully. The colours that you choose have to match the Indian skin tone. You can use bronze, orange and red. The whole look has to be well-coordinated.

Any quick home remedies? 

 Orange is great it peps you up and makes you feel nice. Lavender oil is good for de-stressing. If you want something more exotic, go for jasmine. 

 For skin care, you can use papaya and milk powder and a squeeze of lemon. This will lighten and brighten you up. If you have oily skin, cut out the milk powder. 

 If your hair is falling, use coconut milk with a squeeze of lemon. 

 Rub tomatoes on your face and rinse it off after two minutes. It closes your pores. 

 If you want shine, splash coconut water on your face and wash it off after two minutes.

 If you are stressed out, the best thing is Dreams, one of my blended oils. Apply it around your navel, eyes and under your feet. This will calm you down and you will sleep like a baby.

 What about your first love, aromatherapy? 

 Aromatherapy remains my favourite, even though I have dabbled in a lot of other things. 

 How effective is aromatherapy in treating diseases?

 You feel mentally good. In certain cases like arthritis and spondylosis, lavender oil really helps.

 Any new trends?

 Aromatherapy wrap and massage it relaxes you completely.

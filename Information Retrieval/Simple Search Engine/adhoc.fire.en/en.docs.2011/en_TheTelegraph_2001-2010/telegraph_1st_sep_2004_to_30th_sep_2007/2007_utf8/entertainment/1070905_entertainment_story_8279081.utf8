The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 My baby 

 Heyy Babyy is turning out to be one of the biggest blockbusters of the year but there are those who feel first-time director funnyman Sajid Khans successful choreographer-director sister Farah Khan should be given a lot of the credit for her behind-the-scenes role.

 Sajid denies the sibling hand: We have never really discussed work with each other. In fact she just choreographed two of the songs for my film because she was busy with her own film (the Shah Rukh Khan-Deepika Padukone-starrer Om Shanti Om). She did not even know the story of Heyy Babyy until she saw the film recently. Its not that she did not offer to help but at the back of my mind I always wanted Heyy Babyy to be only my baby.

 Katrina Kaif

In true Raksha Bandhan spirit, though, Sajid kept praising his sister. Farah is an iron woman on the surface, he says. But deep down, she is a very domesticated girl. She is a one-man woman, an ideal wife to have. Shirish (Kunder) is an extremely lucky guy to have a wife like Farah.

 Sallu family

 Fashion designer Vikram Phadnis has been called upon to design and style the clothes and the look for fictional computer game characters.

 Malaika Arora Khan and Katrina Kaif walked the ramp sporting Vikrams designs at a function to unveil the games and Vikrams look. The crowds were left goggle-eyed with the funky creations created by Vikram for Zapak.com.

 Vikram announced that his clothes were bizarre, funky and impractical unlike his regular line of design. The materials used to create the outfits included leather, lace and lycra.

 The two girls were all praise for Vikram, who incidentally is Salmans regular designer. Katrina said: Among Indian designers, I love to wear Vikrams clothes. Malaika added: I love wearing his designs.

 When Vikram was put under the spot and asked to choose between Salmans sis-in-law and Salmans lady love, the designer was anything but funky or impractical. They both are family, so how can I choose? he laughed.

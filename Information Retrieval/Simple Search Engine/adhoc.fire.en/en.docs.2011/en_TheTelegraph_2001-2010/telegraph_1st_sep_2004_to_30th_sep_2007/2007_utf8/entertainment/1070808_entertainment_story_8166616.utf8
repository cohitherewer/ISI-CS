 Split wide open

 So long Brangelina?

 No, they havent yet. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have denied reports of being on the verge of splitting up. Rumours have been rife that the couple, who have been together for three years, are no longer making each other happy.

They were reported to be on the brink of calling it a day after Angelina threw a glass of wine in Brads face when he said she was immature. The pair was jetting off to the south of France together and is believed to be going house-hunting hardly the actions of a couple in meltdown. It also doesnt seem to matter to them if theyve got almost as many houses as they have kids they fancy yet another.

Another couple reportedly on the verge of splitting is English footballer Frank Lampard and fiancee Elen Rives. The couple has been at each others throats after Elen refused to forgive the Chelsea midfielder for being caught off-side with an East European woman in a hotel room in Las Vegas last month. Elen gave birth to their second daughter Isla in May. They were set to marry this year. Ouch!

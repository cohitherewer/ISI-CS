 Sunny space

 Sunshine

 spoils sleep and noise disrupts peace. Architect and interior designer 

 VIVEK RATHORE comes to the rescue. 

 I have shifted to a new flat where my bedroom is very airy and sunny. Being in the south-east of the house, it gets lots of sunlight in the morning. Sometimes I am unable to sleep late because the room is flooded with sunlight. Is there any way I can block out the light in the morning?

 P. Kohli

 Sunlight is good for your bedroom. If you shift your bed in a direction where the window doesnt disturb you, it will be best. You may also opt for blackout curtains or blackout roller blinds that are available in most of furnishing stores.

 You could also install a light grey solar film on the window panes to reduce glare. If possible, you could use plants to block the light.

 I live in a very noisy locality and it is taking a toll on me. I get a headache very often because of the continuous vehicular noise. Is there any way of soundproofing the house without spending too much?

 Namrata Sen

 Soundproofing is indeed a necessity in houses located in high-traffic zones. A permanent solution is to have double-glazed windows with higher sound attenuation. If that seems difficult, you could try acoustical blinds (muff curtains), from the brand Mac (Acoustik Muff AM 776, AM 777, AM 778). You should install some gasket lining along with window shutters so that while closed, they insulate better. A background sound like instrumental music or gurgling sound of a water fountain can help in perceptive smudging of external noise, so when you want to relax, you can fight the external noise with some soothing music.

 Be

 careful

 while

 cleaning

 the mosaic

 flooring 

 I have read that one shouldnt wipe the floors with detergent as it causes mosaic and marble to lose its lustre. Is this true? What are the other good wiping options to ensure shine? Is vinegar good for the floors?

 Joyeeta Banerjee

 Marble is an alkaline-based

 stone and can be dissolved by acids in cleaning products

 and other kitchen sources such as citrus juices, wine

 and soft drinks. These acidic fluids scour the surface,

 make it rough and enable deposition of dust particles,

 which results in the losing of its lustre. Do not use

 products that contain lemon, vinegar or other acids

 as these may damage the surface. Detergents tend to

 leave the stone very raw or absorbent and

 residues make water penetration into the stone more

 effective. 

 Similarly, for mosaic flooring, scouring of the surface invites accumulation of dust and dirt. If the floor has already been scoured, then going for a re-polish is recommended. Hard damp mopping is recommended on a regular basis. Natural soaps like vegetable-based soaps are best for cleaning stone floors. Speciality soaps or detergents formulated for use on stone are highly recommended for most natural stone floors and surfaces. 

 I have a small desk in my office, which is not a cubicle. How can I personalise it and deck it up? I work in a media house.

 S. Agarwal

 It is important how your desk-top looks. You may go for bold colours (posters, padding or graphics) or a simple stylised signature on white paper placed underneath your glass top. This would discreetly give an identity to your workspace. 

 Have integrated accessories, rather than a mixture of small and big articles. Buy a table lamp, which will highlight your space as well as make for good task light. A clutter-free arrangement is recommended.

 Visuals on song

 RAVI CHANDRAN on the blues and greens of Saawariya.

 Ranbir and Sonam in Saawariya 

After Dil Chahta Hai, Virasat, Yuva, Paheli and Black, Ravi Chandran has just shot Sanjay Leela Bhansalis much-awaited magnum opus Saawariya. Like an aged painting, the film featuring newcomers Ranbir Kapoor (Rishis son) and Sonam Kapoor (Anils daughter) is a visual treat. The ace cinematographer talks to t2...

 You have already shot Black with Bhansali. How different was Saawariya?

 We had never shot any song before because Black had no songs. So here was I encountering for the first time Bhansalis song picturisations. He also hadnt worked with me on a song. So it was level playing ground.

 How was it different from shooting a scene with Bhansali? Completely different. People forget scenes but they remember the songs forever. Even today you will see a Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam song playing on television. Because of TV, songs today have a very long visual shelf life. So songs are that much more important than scenes. And with Bhansali, it is all the more challenging. He looks for perfect moments. He wont settle for anything less. The trolley timings have to be just right, the jimmy jib sweep has to be accurate.

 How many songs are there and how long did you take to shoot them? There are 11 songs in the film and on an average every song took us around 10 days. And I can tell you thats much more than any other director takes.

 Was it because Saawariya has two newcomers? They maybe newcomers but with Bhansali around they have to come up with the same level of performances as an Amitabh Bachchan or a Rani Mukerji. And both Ranbir and Sonam have lived up to his expectations. A Bhansali song also takes a lot of time in explaining to the dance director what exactly he wants.

 What is your take on Ranbir Kapoor? He is a born star. No question about that. As far as his looks go, people are comparing him to Hrithik Roshan but I feel he has a leaner frame. So that makes him different from Hrithik and Salman Khan. Also he is quite tall.

 What about Sonam Kapoor? She has a very classical face. Its very strange that she looks different from different angles. From one angle she looks like Rekha. From another angle she looks like Waheeda Rehman. People will surely find her quite intriguing.

 Does your camera think the two have that requisite chemistry for a fresh teenage romance?

 They are not romantic in real life, just buddies. But in the film they have great chemistry. And Bhansali is the master of that kind of cinema.

 From the promos it looks magnificent but very over-the-top... There is no realistic tone to the film. Even the locations are not realistic. The entire film has been shot indoors. Saawariya has a very romantic, stylish look to it. It was meant to look like a painting. Devdas (cameraman: Binod Pradhan) had an operatic look about it. Even Black was very shiny. Saawariya is more rustic, aged, faded. It has a lived-in feel to it.

 What lighting did you use to get that feel? I have used a lot of smoke. So the background has a soft, diffused tone to it. You know the Gothic feel you get when you watch the Harry Potter or Batman movies. For the first time an Indian film has used space lighting. Usually when you use smoke, you can make out the light source. Here you cannot and that is a big thing if you are working on a huge indoor set. We referenced a lot of Indian paintings and murals during prep. Shooting Saawariya was a delight for me.

 What about the colours? We have used blue and green as the main palette. Our inspiration was the blue city Jodhpur where all houses are blue in colour. Then we made it into Haridwar by having the river run through the city. As for the green, Sonams character is Muslim and she lives in the green part of the city. So, in the film, Ranbir from the blue part of the city goes to meet Sonam in the green part.

 So its an absolute visual treat? It is a musical treat with great visuals. More than half the film is music.

 What next? Nandita Dass directorial debut starring Naseeruddin Shah and Paresh Rawal. We start shooting in November.

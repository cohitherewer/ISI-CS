The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Madam M

 Mona Singh

From one M to another. From one gorgeous lady to another. From Mandira Bedi to Mona Singh, Extraaa Shots on MAX continues to sizzle. The fascinating inserts punctuating Bollywood blockbusters has now got Jassi jalwa written all over it.

 I was very happy and I said yes the moment I was approached, Mona tells t2. I love movies. I have always been a movie buff. Not only that, I think as a person I am pretty filmi. So talking about movies is something that comes naturally to me.

 Mona was last seen as the celebrity dance contestant on Sonys Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa. It was a brilliant experience, she says. After Jhalak I have just been dancing. I went on a world tour. Then I performed everywhere from Canada to the UK and the US. I have done around 150 shows in the last one year. I have lost weight, it feels good.

 As usual, the new movie jockey is all too keen to point out the differences with the old show, hosted by Mandira. Even though the name stays the same, we have revamped the Extraaa Shots show completely, claims Mona. We are going more behind the scenes of every movie. We are going into a lot of trivia around the film being shown. Its more personal, more interactive. Like in Traffic Signal (shown on MAX on September 15), we gave a lot of inside info besides the interviews of the cast and crew of the film.

 Mona will next be seen talking about Vidhu Vinod Chopras Eklavya, to be shown on MAX on September 29.

 Then in October, she will hit the small screen as the host of Extreme Makeover on Sony.

 But that is just the teaser. For a big surprise awaits us all, promises Jassi. The surprise will first come to your drawing room and then maybe a theatre near you, she laughs.

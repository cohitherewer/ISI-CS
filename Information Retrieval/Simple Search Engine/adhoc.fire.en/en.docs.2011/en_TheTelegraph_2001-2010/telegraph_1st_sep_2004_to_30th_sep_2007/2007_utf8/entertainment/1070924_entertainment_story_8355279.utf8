The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Bold amp; beautiful

 The roles played by Amrita (Sanskriti) and Anchal (Siddhi) in Har Ghar Kuch Kehta Hai (Zee TV) are not what you get with the usual saas-bahu spread. The two bold female protagonists who made family soap, airing at a pre-midnight slot (11pm) worthwhile, spoke to t2. 

Amrita Prakash

 She has come of age. The child-actress whos found a place in many hearts with her performances in Tum Bin and Vivah is busy securing a place in our drawing rooms as well. She admits its not a big-screen project that is taking up her time now its her new serial Har Ghar Kuch Kehta Hai on Zee.

 With this serial Amrita has managed to break out of the sweet-little-girl mould. The serial focuses on three girls. Rati, Anchal and myself. Ratis character (Prarthana) is the usual arranged marriage, joint family thing, while Anchals (Siddhi) is a love marriage and a nuclear family. But my character Sanskriti doesnt believe in the institution of marriage. She believes as long as you are committed you need not abide by any institution such as marriage. And she goes for a live-in relationship, narrates Amrita. 

 But isnt that a bold departure from her image? Yes, it is much, much bolder. Its different from anything that I have ever done before, agrees Amrita, who was stuck with the child-artiste image right from when she played Mili in Tum Bin, Chhoti in Vivah and was even a part of shows like Fox Kids.

 Amrita is very clear on what she wants to do now. The final-year student of Mithibai College, Mumbai, is happy playing Sanskriti Thakral (for over a month). The TV stint is a welcome break, but whats next, a re-launch on the big screen? Not necessarily, but preferably, laughs the girl. Actually, I am not really looking at films right now. Maybe after my degree. But I am not going looking for it anyway. If something comes along Ill definitely consider that, says Amrita. As long as it is decent work, the banner is not a big deal either.

 With work and studies taking up all her time, does Amrita not miss having fun? Not quite. I have had my time, says Amrita. I think it is high time that I devote myself to my career. Where is the time for anything else?

Anchal Anand

 Amritas costar, who plays Siddhi, insists that Har Ghar Kuch Kehta Hai is not a typical saas-bahu serial. Not at all. The focus of the story is on three girls and what they expect from their lives and dont get. Just like for Siddhi, my character, the love of her life is everything to her. So she wants a nuclear family. She believes everything can be accepted, but upto a certain limit.

 But how much of this uptight character is Anchal in real life? A part of it is very much me. I dont understand the concept of arranged marriage.... I believe in love, love marriage. And I wouldnt mind staying with my in-laws either, but if I have to stay with a family of 25 members Ill go crazy, laughs the chirpy girl.

 A veteran on the small screen Anchal has already worked in serials like Saathi Re (STAR One), Sinddoor (Zee), Woh Rehne Wali Mehlon Ki (Sahara), Kabhi Aaye Na Judaai (Star Plus) mostly as the docile and loving bahu. Her role in Har Ghar is a welcome break Here, I am playing a very independent girl, who can take her own decision. 

 With three girls as the protagonists, were there catfights and turf tussles? No, no not at all. It doesnt matter at all. Actually it all depends on the storyline. So there is nothing to feel jittery about. Eventually everyones track is going to open, one by one,

 Since her character is one of a strong minded woman and there is every possibility of it turning negative, would she be comfortable with the change? A pause later, Anchal clarifies: It depends on the storyline really. If it changes I wont mind doing a negative role. As long as my track is important to the show and it is the lead role I dont mind, she smiles.

 For the girl whose, work is getting progressively better Har Ghar Kuch Kehta Hai could well be just the beginning.

 Bad girl, good girl

 Are you ready to wear your heart on your head? Priscilla Corner suggests some classic and cool hairstyles to match your personality

 Kangana Ranaut, Kelly Osbourne and Jennifer Aniston

The headline grabbing haircut of the season definitely is Victoria Beckhams. She sported it on her entry into the US. The style was created at the Chris McMillan hair salon, hotspot of Penelope Cruz and Kelly Osbourne, and it has been nicknamed the Pob to incorporate the first two letters of her maiden moniker Posh Spice! While the jury is out on whether the haircut shows Victoria is trying too hard, the outcome of the Pob is that it has given shorter styles a fresh, hi-fashion lease on life. And it also led to Katie Holmes of TomKat fame cutting her tresses in a similar, shorter CopyKat style!

 I am a 30-year-old woman with longer-than-waist length hair. I will be joining an MNC and would like to cut my hair into a style that would suit me. I am really scared as this is the first time I am going to style my hair.

 The safest cut for first-timers who dont want to place themselves in a state of post-styling shock is a below-the-shoulder layered style. You can style it in a twist or a trendy nape knot when it gets warm or when you want to look serious and dont want it falling all over your face. For an evening out, just wash and go! Below are a few cuts you can choose from if you are looking for something extra!

 Jennifer Aniston: The square layers 

 This cut is back with a bang. It is a face-framing, layered, shorter style that flicks out at the nape area. The fringe lends an innocence and the flicks a hint of playfulness.

 Style tip: Wash and dry with a paddle brush. Colour tip: Dark shade on lower flicks and highlights on top.

 Aishwarya Rai Bachchan: Forward graduation

 This is a longer, low-layered style that is feminine and can look glamourous if the layers are heavily sliced or textured. This is an ideal cut for thin hair as it does not interfere with the overall appearance of volume. It is the perfect crossover cut as you can go from temptress to temple with a quick change of clothes and some sindoor.

 Style tip: To accentuate textured ends, use a round brush. Colour tip: Large chunky highlights and lifted base shade.

 Ally McBeal: The bob

 A straight-laced, no-nonsense, low-maintenance one-level haircut that is best worn just below the ears. It can make a little girl look littler if worn with a fringe, or a 30-plus woman look really sophisticated if its worn side-swept and well styled. Ideal for moms who want to go from the cooking to cocktail circuit in a whoosh of a two-minute blow dry!

 Style tip: Use a light-hold styling lotion and round brush to keep ends rolled under. Colour tip: Keep it monochrome.

 Katrina Kaif: Tonged tresses

 This is a cut that, when left to dry naturally, falls in gentle feminine waves. When styled, it can send the wow--meter slamming through the roof. Ideal for those who like putting a sophisticated dancing foot forward now and again.

 Style tip: Apply a medium hold styling product, then wave the bottom layers of the hair with large tongs. Colour tip: Dark mahogany with fringe sliced with a violet hue.

 Halle Berry: The pixie crop

 All wide-eyed innocence with a wild-child core. If you are straddling two identities, this hair cut does well. This short, layered crop can morph you, with a touch of a high-hold styling product, from innocence into a sexy bikini-clad Bond girl, before you can say 007!

 Style tip: Use an ultra-hold style product for the top of hair and a shine serum on the sides. Colour tip: Shoeshine highlights of light ash blonde on tips at top, sides a shade darker.

 Angelina Jolie: The updo

 Reveal, reveal, reveal, whenever you can. The hair is swept away from your face, shoulders and neck to give everyone a glimpse of well-kept skin or a tattoo! 

 Style tip: Use a light mist spray to keep the setting in place. Colour tip: Anything below five on colour shade card and a dash of copper.

 Catherine Zeta Jones: The Chicago bob

 Dark, mysterious, manipulative. It is a sleek high-maintenance cut, which requires a dash to the salon at least once a week it needs serums, blow dries, trims and make-up to match.

 Colour tip: Blue-black with a tinge of violet.

 Kangana Ranaut: Curl souffle

 The cut does sound rather like a dessert, because curls, when cut and groomed well, can make anyone look downright dishy! A heavily layered cut that takes away the weight of the hair and gives it a light airy look!

 Style tip: Wash and semi-air dry hair. Use spray serum or leave-in conditioner and scrunch curls. Colour tip: Deep auburn, with copper highlights.

 Kelly Osbourne: Radical razor cuts

 For the kind of girl no one would dare take home to momma! Cuts styled on the rebellious defiant attitude of the punk ethos have given Kelly Osbourne cult icon status.

 Style tip: Do whatever. Colour tip: As per whims and fancies!

 Britney Spears: Bald

 If your life has suddenly turned into a fiasco and you want to wrest back control by symbolically getting rid of all emotional baggage and style expectations, shaving off your hair may be the way to go.

 Style tip: Temporary tattoo on occipital bone area with the words Passing Phase written on it!

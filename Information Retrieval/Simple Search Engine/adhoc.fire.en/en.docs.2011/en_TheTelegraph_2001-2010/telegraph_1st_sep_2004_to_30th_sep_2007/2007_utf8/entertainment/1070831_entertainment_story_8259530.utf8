 High on the fun factor

 Don rsquo;t have the patience to start with basic ballet? Choreographer Vishal Kanoi tells you how to jump-start your dancing skills with jazz-funk

 Ideally ballet is the thing for beginners. But it requires a lot of discipline and dedication, and not everyone has the time or inclination for it. For those not looking to take up dance professionally, jazz-funk is a good form to start with. 

 A fusion dance form, blending the ethics of jazz and the fun of hip-hop, jazz-funk is perfectly suited to get the beginner into the groove. It requires a lot of hand-leg coordination, which is why I say it is good to start with jazz-funk. 

 Of course the earlier you start the better, for it is easier to mould the body while young, but it can also be picked up later. I even have 60-year-olds in my jazz-funk class! 

 With jazz, which is the more classical form, people often continue for years. But as ones knowledge of dance increases, one tends to move beyond jazz-funk. That doesnt mean this fun style isnt important. In every dance course, it is recognised as a dance form in itself and an important part of the curriculum. 

 It is especially popular with the youth, for it is a very lively, energetic form, full of rhythm. It is a great dance to sweat with. So its ideal for those who are looking at dance as a form of work-out. And because it is so energetic, it is very enjoyable. 

 While Latin is definitely the flavour of the season, in Calcutta jazz-funk is by no means less popular. It is a good way to hone ones social dancing skills. 

 The steps that one learns at the class may not be performed at a party or a night club. But since it improves the body alignment, coordination and the ability to respond to the music, spontaneous movement to any beat becomes easy. 

 Jazz is more for the stage it is theatrical in its execution but jazz-funk has made its way into films. From Dil To Pagal Hai (Shah Rukh Khan and Madhuri Dixit) to choreography for numerous music videos, its jazz-funk all the way.

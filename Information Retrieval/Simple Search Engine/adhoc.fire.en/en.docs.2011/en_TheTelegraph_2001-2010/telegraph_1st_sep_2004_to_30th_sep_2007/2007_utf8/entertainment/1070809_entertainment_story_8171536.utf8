 KIDDIE COOL

 - Style starts early for fashionable young ones

 Todays toddlers and even infants are so well turned out they give their mommies a run for their money. And dont make the mistake of assuming the choice of outfit is left to the parents. Todays kids are far from the fashion-challenged tots of yesterday, who were happy to wear blue T-shirts with red polka-dotted pants. They know their mind; they decide what to wear.

 A stroll around a mall or multiplex is proof of just how fashionable todays babies are. And just how many stores are creating stylish clothes for these pint-sized style icons and at very adult prices. If you are the kind of parent who wonders why half a metre of denim costs Rs 500, you are in for a tough time shopping for your child.

 Trend track

 Baby fashion today is an 

 extension of adult fashion, explains Shiv Daswani, 

 partner, Little Shop, the kids store at New Market 

 and Forum. So its smaller versions of outfits at grown-up 

 shops that you will find in childrens wear stores. 

 Silver and gold prints, sequins, foil prints, polka dots, 

 balloon hemlines, halter-tops, leggings paired with short 

 skirts. The silhouettes rival those seen at fashion weeks 

 around the country, even around the world.

 For to-be dudes, the way to go is trousers with lots of pockets, detachable bottoms that can be made into three-quarter pants, belts with chunky buckles and chains, and experiments with newer hues and prints pinks and lilacs, considered traditionally feminine, polkas and embroidery. Just like daddy.

 And while the colour code is still bright and beautiful, more subdued tones are being used to off-set them. Colours like chocolate browns, olives and fawns which were never thought of as baby colours are big now, explains Daswani.

 Todays baby and kids wear is contemporary, embellished with simplistic stitching. They are well fitted and smart, says Sanjay Arora of Weekender.

 Even if it isnt all decidedly adult frills and flounces might be passe, but cartoon characters continue to be a big draw it has definitely evolved, from the days of horrid mismatched bright colours and loud patterns. Kids today dont wear the dolled-up look. Clothes are more rugged. Capris, shorts, hot pants, sleeveless shirts, spaghetti straps, patched denims. says Harjeet Kaur, executive brand outlet merchandiser, Gini amp; Jony, kids-wear retailer.

 If the demarcation between baby fashion and kids fashion is blurred trends are quite similar for four-year-olds and eight-year-olds for the tiny ones, between zero and six months, the focus is on comfort. Which is why Fabindias kids wear is all cotton. For the really young babies, many of our dresses are unisex. For those above a year, the clothes begin to be different, says Sujata Absar, manager, Fabindia, Hindustan Road.

 Casual wear and formal wear look very different as well. After all, like parents, kids have occasions on which they must dress up. If mommy and daddy are going to be dressed in sari and sherwani, so must baby be. Ethnic wear for children was never been a rage earlier, but for the past two-three years, theres been a tremendous increase in the demand. Almost 25 per cent of our garment sales now consists of ethnic wear, says Daswani. Lehngas, salwar kameezes and kurtas are eagerly bought for a different look.

 One-and-a-half-year-old Khush wore his first dhoti-kurta for Diwali. He looked so sweet. I am not usually fond of ethnic wear for boys, but its a break from the usual shorts and trousers, says mother Jigisha Gathani. For weddings, festivals and special Sundays, Khush is resplendent in his Indian attire.

 While trends cannot be ignored altogether, parents like Jigisha are also trying to cling to the innocent look. He does wear jeans, but I also like to dress him in dungarees from time to time, she smiles.

 Trends change as fast as babies outgrow them. There was a time when my son loved shoes with lights. Now he says they are for kids. He wants laced-up boots, says Ruchika Gupta of her five-year-old son, Varenya. He also knows what kind of hair-cut he wants and dresses right for special occasions, like a saffron kurta for Independence Day, or a dhoti-kurta for Rakhi, explains the mother who has already started accessorising her daughters wardrobe. Parthavi is all of six months.

 International trends too play a part. Kids today want to be dressed like their international counterparts, says Vineeth Nair, director, Raymond Apparel Ltd. Raymonds Zapp is one of the newest kids stores to have opened in the city on Lee Road.

 What is launched in Europe today will be here tomorrow. Baby fashion does follow cyclical changes, and trends change every few months, explains a salesperson at the kids branch of United Colors of Benetton in Forum. A new trend takes time to form, but colour and hemline change more rapidly.

 There are at least two different collections every year spring-summer and fall-winter. We also have to keep monitoring fashion forecasts for kids and keep an eye on adult fashion to adapt kids fashion accordingly, explains Kaur of Gini amp; Jony.

 Budget buy

 It is particularly painful to 

 discard the cute outfits within months sometimes weeks 

 of buying them. But does that stop mommy from splurging?

 Parents today are aware that toddlers safety and comfort are paramount. The consumer is a lot more discerning and willing to pay for products that he or she believes answers the safety, comfort and fashion needs of the kids, says Nair.

 This despite the fact that the money one spends on those tiny garments is enough to buy a full-sized kurta for mommy, or a shirt for dad.

 A childrens pair of jeans or shirt will not be less than Rs 500. An adult might get a dress for as much, says Agnimitra Paul, fashion designer and mother of four-and-a-half-year-old Vignesh. Agnimitra likes to design her sons shirts herself. He went through a phase of being very adamant about what he wants, but now he thinks that if I can dress celebs, he might try my designs too, she laughs.

 One old trick that some parents employ is buying items that are a size or two bigger, to make clothes last a few months longer. But most parents are so indulgent that they seldom check the price tag prior to purchase, points out Kaur. Natalie Shaw, mother of three-year old Liam, buys stuff for her son through the year. I dont mind spending Rs 500 on a pair of jeans or Rs 300 for a shirt, she admits.

 Its no wonder that the baby fashion market is in the midst of a boom. The per-year growth figure is pegged at 15-18 per cent.

 Easy availability of quality wear has also helped the market. When we were young, most of our clothes would be tailor-made. But today theres so much available, and matching international standards, gushes Agnimitra.

 As long as parents are happy buying them, kids are happy flaunting them.

 Just remember: cute is so last year. This season, its all about infantile chic.

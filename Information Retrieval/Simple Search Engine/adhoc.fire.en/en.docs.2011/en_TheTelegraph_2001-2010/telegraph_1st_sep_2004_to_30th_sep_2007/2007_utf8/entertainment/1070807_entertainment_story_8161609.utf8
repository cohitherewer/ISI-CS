 DADDYS GIRL

 ESHA DEOL on why she keeps looking for a bit of Dharmendra in every man and on why she must do more single-heroine films

While shooting for a fun song from One Two Three on the beaches of Pondicherry, Esha Deol got roasted in the sun. Her feet were hurting but she kept her commitment and talked about Cash, her cache of films and being a daddys girl.

 Whats your role in Cash?

 Its the role of a chick on four wheels. She is a Cape Town local and a real tough nut. She is very smart and adept at conning others.

 Sounds like shades of Dhoom...

 Its not like Dhoom at all. The only thing in common are the cars and bikes, which we unfortunately couldnt replace!

 Your look in the film is very glamorous.

 Im playing a well-dressed babe. She is not elitist; she is out there. She is on the run from the cops yet ready to face anything that comes her way.

 Are you wearing a bikini in the film?

 No (laughs).

 You are paired opposite Zayed and Riteish in Cash...

 Riteish is going to shock everyone after Cash. He is going to be the surprise package. He is outstanding in the film and he is looking very good too. I keep telling him that he is going to steal the show.

 Do you prefer doing multi-starrers like Cash or solo heroine films like Ankahee or Just Married?

 It does make a difference if you are doing films with a very sellable hero. I love the camera, so I love to hog the limelight. I have taken a conscious decision to do at least three-four solo heroine projects in a year.

 While doing a multi-starrer with more than one heroine, do you take special care to look good and stand out?

 Im a very no-nonsense kind of person. Im very confident about when Im looking good and know when Im looking bad also. Whatever my role is, I go out and do it.

 Which films have you got lined up for this year?

 After Cash, there is Darling, directed by Ram Gopal Varma. It was a wonderful experience working with him. Then there is Hijack opposite Shiney Ahuja. Right now, Im also shooting for One Two Three. Later, Mahesh Bhatts Jannnat (opposite Emraan) will roll.

 Have you also signed No Entry 2 and Dhoom 3?

 I dont know anything (about these) as of now.

 You recently said you dont want to work with Fardeen in future. How come you are doing 

 Darling with him?

 said that because Fardeen and I have worked together for so long, we ran out of conversation (laughs). After shooting for so many films together, we didnt know what to say to each other during the making of an entire film. I guess we were so bored of each other.

 You are playing a ghost in Darling. How was the experience?

 It was fun because in reality I wish I could come back as a ghost and harass people who have bothered me.

 Have you seen Apne?

 Yes, thats the only film I have managed to see. I have not even watched TV in a long time.

 What do you think of your dads performance?

 He is the most honest, vulnerable and lovely man that I have ever come across. He is looking great and the way he carries himself, I dont think anyone can ever touch him.

 What do you think of Dharmendra and Hema Malini coming back as an on-screen couple after decades?

 I dont know if they are doing a film together but I would love to see them together on screen.

 Which film of theirs have you enjoyed the most?

 Their first film together, Tum Haseen Main Jawaan. It was kickass.

 All daughters who are very close to their fathers want their men to be like their dads. Do you also look for your dads qualities in a man?

 Yes, I do. My father has the most loveable qualities. He is the only man I have known closely at a very emotional level. Thats why till today Im not seeing anyone. Im very choosy, I prefer not to regret after making a hasty decision. Its better to play safe. Yes, I would love someone like my dad to come into my life. His love for my mother is unconditional.

 Do you ever want to do a film with your dad?

 I would love to do a film with my dad and mom.

 You are doing a film with your mom...

 Mom is co-producing this film while Revathy is directing it. Mom and I have lots of film offers coming our way to star together as mother-daughter but we are being choosy. We will definitely work together.

 Hema Malini is said to have wanted you for the role of Basanti in RGVs Sholay. How do you feel about that and also the remaking of Sholay?

 Im glad Im not playing Basanti because the current Sholays Basanti is perfect to the T. I think Nisha Kothari has done a great job. I know Ramu quite well. Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag is going to be a very modernised version of the old Sholay. You cant expect Basanti in a ghoda gaadi today.... I think audiences should go with that mindset and give them credit for putting in so much effort and remaking an epic.

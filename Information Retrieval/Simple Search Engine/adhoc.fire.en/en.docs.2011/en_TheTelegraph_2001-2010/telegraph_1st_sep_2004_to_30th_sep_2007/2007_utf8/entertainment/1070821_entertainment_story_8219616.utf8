The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Talent talks

 Students and teachers from all over Bengal cheered their schools and classmates at The Telegraph School Awards For Excellence on Saturday.

 It felt great to be on the stage to receive the certificate, said IIT Kharagpur student Achin Agarwal, an ex-student of St Thomas Boys School, who received a certificate of honour in the category Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Trust Award for Academic Excellence by a Student. Vinamra Daga of Birla High School came with the rest of his classmates to cheer for his school. I think its a great thing that scholarships were given out to underprivileged students, said the Class IX student. Vinamra was not the only student who felt inspired. Said Sayak Chakravorty, a Class XII student of La Martiniere for Boys, who received a certificate of honour in the category Shaw Foundation Award for the Best All-Round Student: I really liked the scholarships section too. It was great to see so many people persisting against all odds.

 Ive been attending the awards for the past seven years and I think it gets better every time. There are few other platforms like this that recognise and acknowledge young talent, said Aniket Deb Roy, a former teacher of St James School. There are so many people who are never recognised in this milieu and its a great thing that The Telegraph Awards does that, echoed Aparna Chaudhuri, a student of Calcutta Girls High School, who received a certificate of honour for outstanding talent.

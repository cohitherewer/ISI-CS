 Other side of midnight

 Abhay Deol being chased around in Navdeep Singhs noir thriller Manorama Six Feet Under

 Weird things happen in dark rooms. Clandestine, chilling things like lust, massacre, mayhem, nightmares and movies where mysterious shadows slice the world into jagged fragments in the dead of the night. And, in the corner of the room, blackness itself collects in thick pools like congealed blood where paranoia and dread dangle like a double-edged sword.

 Welcome to the darkness of film noir.

 Film noir is a cinematic term used primarily to describe stylish crime dramas, particularly those that emphasise moral ambiguity and sexual motivation. The stories that are usually clubbed under the film noir genre are usually about fatalism, isolation and misdemeanor. Here is a world where its always night.

 Indian cinema, thats coming of age, has recently been re-experimenting with the gloomy genre. Films like Ek Chaalis Ki Last Local, Being Cyrus and the upcoming Manorama Six Feet Under are perfect examples of films with intentions that go bump in the night.

 Bollywood has occasionally dabbled in this genre. One of Bollywoods first film noir films was the 1964 Hemant Kumar-produced film, Kohra (Fog) that was a superfluous remake of Alfred Hitchcocks Rebecca. Director Biren Nag and cinematographer Marshall Braganza captured the frames of this Biswajeet-Waheeda Rehman starrer to dark perfection. Similarly, the 1963 Sunil Dutt vehicle Yeh Raaste Hain Pyaar Ke that was loosely based on the sensational Nanavati murder case was a borderline noir.

 Raakh, an Aditya Bhattacharya film, starring a one-film old Aamir Khan and Pankaj Kapur, told a tale of violent revenge in the black of the night. This crime drama was a worthy contender to the film noir genre. Director Sudhir Mishra also experimented with the genre in Iss Raat Ki Subah Nahin in 1996, capturing murder, mayhem, violence and attempted suicide through the night.

 Of late, several filmmakers are veering towards noir.

 In 2003, the Mahesh Bhatt-written Jism spun a surprise web of wonder at the box office. Jism was based on the 1944 Billy Wilder film noir classic Double Indemnity. It launched Bipasha Basu and beau John Abraham into the big league. The film was an inspired depiction of steamy adultery and murder.

 Ek Hasina Thi, released in the February of 2004, was a magnificent debut by director Sriram Raghavan. This dark drama, starring Saif Ali Khan and Urmila Matondkar, met with critical acclaim.

 Devika Bhagat, screenwriter for the upcoming Manorama Six Feet Under points out: My film is in fact a sub-genre, one that shares common characteristics with private detective thrillers like the Raymond Chandlers pulp fiction, which reside in the company of a few creepy shadows that emphasise the dark side of human existence. Even in Manorama, Abhay Deol plays a crime-writer who gets obsessed with unravelling a mystery, spearheaded by a femme fatale and a voiceover.

 Manoramas director Navdeep Singh reinstates the definition of his film and the genre in particular. Film noir is a classic Hollywood term used for movies made in the 40s and 50s which dealt with human psyche and dark elements of that era. He adds that although his film isnt exactly film noir, it is homage to the genre.

 Being Cyrus, a dark, comedic venture by debutant director Homi Adajania reintroduced the niche dark comedy film genre. Although it is an out-and-out black comedy, its a film that swerves dangerously close to the film noir genre. Being Cyrus spelled some amount of box office success for Saif, Naseer and Dimple.

 Sadly, triumph evaded Ek Chaalis Ki Last Local, a film that borrowed heavily from the same genre. Being fundamentally a low-budget thriller, Ek Chaalis used a harsh, punchy film-making style for maximum impact, typical of the film noir genre. But the filmmakers got it all wrong, threw in toilet humour and messed it up. The film proved to be a box office disaster.

 Ditto for The Blue Umbrella, that was confused, shockingly, between being film noir and believe it or faint, a childrens film.

 Are we going to witness a re-emergence of film noir? While Bollywood explores the other side of midnight, viewers can expect a disturbing darkness to engulf them in the dark of the theatre.

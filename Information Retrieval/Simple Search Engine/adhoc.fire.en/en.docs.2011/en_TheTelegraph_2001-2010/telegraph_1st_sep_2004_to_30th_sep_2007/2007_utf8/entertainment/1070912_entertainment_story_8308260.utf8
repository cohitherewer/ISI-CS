After introducing organised retail to Calcutta in its contemporary avatar across fashion and food through the Pantaloons, Big Bazaar and Food Bazaar formats, Kishore Biyanis Future Group is now ready to bring in its portfolio of new businesses to town, targeting Rs 1,000-crore business in the current year.

 Calcutta today has a lot of momentum. The inherent intellectual capital of the city is now buoyed by a positive energy, which is a lethal combination. We want to strengthen the emotional bond our group enjoys with the people of Calcutta by unveiling all our new formats there, while also growing the existing ones, Biyani told t2 from Mumbai.

 While Collection i, selling home furniture products, and e-Zone, catering to the consumer electronics segment, are already present in Calcutta (at Homeland mall and in Pantaloons Kankurgachhi), Home Town, the large-format home solutions store, is coming up at Rajarhat.

 We have a very aggressive rollout plan for Calcutta, which will see 10 Big Bazaars by June next year besides a number of KBs Fair Price shops. These neighbourhood stores will sell leading brands of around 300 essentials almost 10 per cent cheaper than the market price, while local brands will be up to 20 per cent cheaper, said Biyani, managing director of Pantaloon Retail (India) Ltd, the flagship company of the Future Group.

 Other formats of the group include Depot, Shoe Factory, Brand Factory, Blue Sky, Fashion Station, aLL (a little larger), Top 10, mBazaar and Star and Sitara. It also operates Spoon, a food-court format, and an online portal, futurebazaar.com.

 Most of these will be in Calcutta by the middle of 2008. We also want to tap into the sports craze in the city by opening eight to 10 new Planet Sports outlets. We want to be associated with sports in Calcutta in any way possible. Sponsoring a tournament or even adopting a Maidan club is possible, Biyani declared.

 There will be a big pre-Puja launch of Indigo Nation and Scullers, two of the apparel brands the group owns through Indus League Clothing, and a larger presence in UK-based Lee Cooper and French retailer ETAM, a joint-venture partner.

 The Future Group operates through six verticals retail, capital, brands, space, media and logistics. Group company Planet Retail owns and operates the franchisee of international brands Marks amp; Spencer, The Body Shop, Next, Debenhams and Guess in India. Avani Heights on Chowringhee already houses this high-profile brand basket barring Debenhams, while the South City Mall will be the second stop.

 Through Kshitij, its real estate asset management arm, the Future Group is developing more than 50 malls and consumption centres across the country and has also formed a joint-venture company focusing on mall management with Singapore-based real estate major CapitaLand.

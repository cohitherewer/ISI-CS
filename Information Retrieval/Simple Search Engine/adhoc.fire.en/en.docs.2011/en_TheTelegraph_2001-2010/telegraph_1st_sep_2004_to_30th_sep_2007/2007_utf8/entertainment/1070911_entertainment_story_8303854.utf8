 Shahid Kapur and Kareena Kapoor try to get their reel romance working in Jab We Met 

With these words, unfolds the first trailer of Imtiaz Alis upcoming rom com Jab We Met. Amidst strong rumours of them having split in real life, Shahid Kapur and Kareena Kapoor romance each other in this road movie, boasting of some great music by the hit-man Pritam. 

 After the wise opening line, we are introduced to Kareenas character Geeta who boards a train at the very last moment and thanks the Almighty for keeping her record intact of not missing any train. Thus we are introduced to the crazy quirkiness of Geeta, which is later confirmed by the statement by Shahids character Aditya: Museum mein rakhna chahiye tumhe, ticket lagna chahiye tumhe dekhne ke liye.

 What emerges from the minute-and-a-half-long trailer is that in true DDLJ style, Kareena fails to board her train at some station because of Shahid. And then she threatens him to take her to her destination. Evidently what follows is a romantic road trip that the two undertake and where they encounter all sorts of people in true Dil Hai Ki Manta Nahin style.

 Of course, there are back stories. Adityas lady love is getting married to someone else and Geeta, who was trying to elope with her boyfriend, cannot because the man in question is having second thoughts. And when Aditya and Geeta do reach her house in Ambala, everyone believes they are seeing each other. So theres even a touch of Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha.

 Imtiaz Ali had earlier made his directorial debut with the touching Socha Na Tha, introducing Abhay Deol and Ayesha Takia. While the film got a lot of acclaim, Imtiazs second film, just as a screenwriter, Ahista Ahista bombed badly.

 For Shahid and Kareena, Jab We Met is that one big love story they wanted to do together on screen and in the search of which they have been turning down loads of movies.

 Well this is it then, another test of the Bebo-Dodo (thats what the Kapoor family calls Shahid) romance after the failure of Fida, 36 Chinatown and Chup Chup Ke. Whether their real life love has also failed them needs to be confirmed by the couple. As of now its a countdown to October 19, when the Shahid-Kareena love story will unfold all over again on celluloid.

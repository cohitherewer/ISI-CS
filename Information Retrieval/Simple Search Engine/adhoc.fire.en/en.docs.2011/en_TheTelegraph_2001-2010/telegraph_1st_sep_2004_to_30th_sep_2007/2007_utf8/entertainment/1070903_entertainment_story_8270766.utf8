The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 M for mad L for laabh

 You would be pagal to sit through three long hours, watching premi Ritwick screaming to his sweetheart: Feel my laabh!

 Pagal Premi is a painful mishmash or rather mismatch of romance, comedy and melodrama. The hero keeps stalking the heroine (Arpita) in college, riding a bicycle with a heart-shaped balloon and yelling I laabh you!. The girl gives a wooden stare and snarls I hate you, I hate you and I hate you!, taking you back to the bad Bollywood films of the 80s. Also because the college crowd wears ludicrous make-up and costume, and mouths terrible lines like Oh you blaady phool!

 The girl is committed to another guy, the brawny Yash whose MLA father doesnt approve of the match and gets in the goons. Enter badman Rajesh Sharma, chasing the lovebirds through jungles and on trains. The hero, realising hes being kabab mein haddi, decides to be martyr instead, rescuing the damsel in distress and uniting her with the fiance. After shedding much blood and tear, the heroine finally changes her mind and feels the heros laabh. End of nightmare.

 The camerawork is the only tolerable thing about the film, its smarter than average Tollywood fare.

 PS: To spice up the love story, director Hara Pattanaik has got a song-and-dance sequence atop a train. Instead of Malaika Arora crooning Chhaiya chhaiya, theres a woman in ghagra choli shaking her booty to Aah mane Agarpara, Ooh mane Ultadanga!!!

 We rest our case.

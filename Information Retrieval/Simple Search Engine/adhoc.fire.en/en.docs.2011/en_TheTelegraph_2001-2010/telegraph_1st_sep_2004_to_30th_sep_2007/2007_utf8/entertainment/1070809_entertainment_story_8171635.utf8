 Ya Ali

 Who must Willard Carroll thank for Ali Larter saying yes 

 to his Marigold opposite Salman Khan? A nameless Indian 

 woman who sat next to Ali on a flight when she was still 

 undecided about signing up!

 Salman had given Willard a free hand in auditioning and 

 casting his leading lady. And Willard didnt want 

 to say too much about Salmans star status in Bollywood 

 as it would be lost on Hollywood actresses.

 When Willard approached Ali Larter she said she would 

 first read the script. Soon after they met, she was flying 

 to France and started reading the script on the flight. 

 Next to her was an Indian lady who started chatting with 

 Ali. The actress casually asked her if she knew of anyone 

 called Salman Khan. That did it! The woman turned out to 

 be a huge fan of Salman and she went on and on and on about 

 how good an actor he was and what a big star he was in India. 

 That was that. Ali said yes to Marigold.

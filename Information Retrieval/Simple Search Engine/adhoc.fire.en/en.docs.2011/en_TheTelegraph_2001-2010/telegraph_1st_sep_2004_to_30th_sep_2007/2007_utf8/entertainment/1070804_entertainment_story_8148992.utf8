Queen of oomph Malaika Arora Khan swore by the power of the LBD (little black dress) at the launch of Oriflames Power Shine lipstick on Wednesday. With her hair neatly pinned back and well-heeled feet firmly on the ground, the stylish siren spoke about beauty, fashion, fitness and more.

 Diet n fitness

 Like most other health-conscious celebs, Malaika kickstarts her day with a glass of hot water, lime and honey. I dont indulge in junk food, she says, shaking her head in disapproval. Following a daily beauty regimen is a must. You must take out an hour at least to pamper yourself. Enough sleep, lots and lots of water, a balanced diet and working out are things that keep you fresh through the day. Of course, grandmothers recipes work equally well, she smiles.

 Make-up mantra

 Take a peek into Malaikas bag at any given time and youll find a moisturiser and an eye pencil. Of course, when Im travelling, I carry a lot more, she says. The pretty-as-a-picture star feels that Botox and other cosmetic procedures should be left up to individual choice. Things like Botox are personal choices. Its rampant and its definitely part and parcel of the beauty business. But surgery is not an option for me because I feel that I wouldnt be myself if I went for it.

 De-stress dos

 The model-turned-actress has always been impressive for her ability to look gorgeous while juggling career and family. Its genetic, Malaika laughs. Our lives are very stressful and its important to de-stress through work-outs and exercise. Its equally important to spend time with family and friends. Especially for working women who are also mothers and wives. Thats where the real beauty of a woman lies, feels the young mother in the brilliant job of balancing work and family. Thankfully, Ive come to a stage of picking and choosing what to do.

 Style icons

 Audrey Hepburn, Sophia Loren, Marilyn Monroe, Michelle Pfeiffer define the quintessential sense of beauty, feels the glam babe. Closer home, I think Rekha and Preity are beautiful. Even my sister Amrita has flawless skin. People say she has baby skin and thats a compliment. Indian women are getting more conscious about the way they look, she says. Everybody wants to be slim and join a gym. Its a revolution of sorts. 

 Baby care

 Coming to babies, the mother of little Arhaan feels that as children grow, its important for them to stick to a healthy diet. They should definitely stay away from junk food, she advises. To keep children happy, spoiling them rotten (sometimes) helps. Where Arbaaz and I go for a holiday depends on where our little son wants to go! she laughs.

 Wardrobe wear

 The style icon wardrobe essentials include jeans, a blazer, formal pants, nice shoes and bags, a black belt, a white shirt its endless, she says. My fashion statement is staying comfortable and Im definitely not ruled by seasons. Its more of what I like. While this free-spirited take on style might be okay for now, when she launches her own clothes line which shes so tight-lipped about, were guessing the colours of the seasons will flow into her fabrics.

 Lip lock

 Not all of us can have lips that explode (as the tagline for Oriflames Power Shine Lipstick goes), but Malaika lists a few tips for basic lip care:

 Use lipstick that

 has SPF 

 Hydrate your lips

 with a lip balm which should always find a place in

 your bag 

 Exfoliate your lips.

 Take an old toothbrush and apply some lip balm. Gently

 exfoliate your lips for a fresh feel

 A good lipstick will last

 all-day and its worth investing in one

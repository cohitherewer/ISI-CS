The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Beyond barriers

 Mir

 The British Councils International School Awards were given out to 31 schools across the country on August 27, the culmination of a year-long project to promote internationalism through cultural, social and educational exchanges with schools in the UK.

 The event held at HHI was hosted by Mir, who kept the audience upbeat with his jokes about everything from teaching to Salman Khan. Adding to the mood were colourful kites decorating the white pillars bearing messages of peace, as part of the Kites for Peace Indo-Pak initiative by the Seagull Foundation for Arts. 

 Schools taking part in the International School Awards are required to present a brief at the beginning of the academic year outlining the events and projects they will organise. These projects are based on a whole variety of educational, cultural and social projects carried out by the students and teachers and are well documented in a dossier that is submitted to a committee at the end of the year, said Marina Gandhi, head of Education UK, east India.

 The scheme allows schools from across the country to establish contact with schools in the UK, to interact with the students and teachers for cross-cultural exchange of curricula. A project like this really brings our kids up to international standards, giving us a global perspective on education, said Usha Rao, principal of Laxman Public School, one of the winning schools from Delhi. The participating schools from Calcutta included St James School, Apeejay School, Lakshmipat Singhania Academy and Salt Lake School.

 The event, which was attended by Rod Pryde, regional director, British Council (India and Sri Lanka), packed in more entertainment from Amit Chaudhuri and his band, which performed its brand of fusion music . A song especially chosen for the audience involving teachers was called Moral Education, based on those age-old moral science charts available at every pavement shop, educating boys and girls on becoming good and dutiful children.

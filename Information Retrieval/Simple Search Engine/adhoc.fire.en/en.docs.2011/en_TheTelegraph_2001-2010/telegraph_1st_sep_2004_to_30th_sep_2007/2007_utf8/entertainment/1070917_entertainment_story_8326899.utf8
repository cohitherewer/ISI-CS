 Princess Claire

 CLAIRE DANES will be living out her fantasies and fighting her fears in two major releases this autumn. 

The last time I met Claire Danes was in New York. We were both on the floor and I was playing with her schnoodle. The schnoodle named Weegee and created, Danes explained, by crossing a schnauzer with a poodle, was demonstrating an insatiable appetite for chasing tennis balls across the carpet. It made for an entertaining but not very productive interview.

 This time, my meeting with the 28-year-old actress, in Los Angeles, is much more formal. Weegee has stayed at home. In his absence, Danes is more serious, talking with focus about an acting career that has been steadily assuming a higher profile since she made her film debut at the age of 11.

 This autumn Danes is starring in two movies: the sentimental Evening, based on the bestselling novel by Susan Minot; and Stardust, which is directed by Matthew Vaughn and in which she heads a star-packed cast that includes Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer, Peter Toole, Ian McKellen and Ricky Gervais.

 It is hard to imagine the beautiful, self-possessed actress ever doubting her abilities, but she insists that she had an attack of nerves prior to filming Evening. The story centres on her character, Ann, a young New Yorker who travels to a mansion in Newport, Maine, for the high-society wedding of her best friend. The events are seen in flashback as, 50 years on, Ann lies dying and journeys in her mind back to that fateful summer weekend.

 Danes, who sings onscreen for the first time, is supported by a stellar cast that includes Vanessa Redgrave as the dying Ann, Meryl Streep as her best friend, Glenn Close, Toni Collette, Hugh Dancy, Patrick Wilson and Eileen Atkins. Streeps real-life daughter, Mamie Gummer, in her film debut, plays the jittery bride and Redgraves daughter, Natasha Richardson, portrays one of her daughters on screen.

 Like Ann, Danes can be curiously ruminative when reviewing the events of her life so far. Ive led an imperfect life and Ive faltered and acted foolishly at times, she says with a rueful smile. Its inevitable, but its much more constructive to focus on ones successes than ones failures.

 If Evening led to some melancholic introspection, Stardust was a joy to make. In the fairytale fable based on Neil Gaimans bestselling novel, she portrays a fallen star, a spirited, unicorn-riding young woman injured by a cosmic tumble and is hunted by witches and scheming princes. It was like a realisation of a fantasy I had when I was six, she says. I was not only a princess but a princess from outer space who has long blonde locks and rides a unicorn and, yes, falls in love.

 Although an established, award-winning star, Danes travels without an entourage or personal assistant. While she can walk the red carpet and pose for photographers with the best of Hollywoods royalty, she is basically still a hometown girl. She lives in the same SoHo neighbourhood where she was born and grew up, has the same friends she has always had, and shops in the same area.

 There was never much doubt about the path her career would take. The daughter of artistic parents her mother is a painter and her father a photographer she began studying modern dance when she was six. By nine she was taking weekend acting classes at New Yorks Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, a former training ground for Al Pacino and Marilyn Monroe.

 At 13 she had a guest role on the television drama series Law and Order and temporarily moved to Los Angeles with her parents to star in the TV series My So-Called Life, for which she won a Golden Globe. Only two years after making her film debut as the doomed Beth in 1994s Little Women, she landed a plum role opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in Romeo + Juliet, a critical and commercial triumph that established her as a major star. 

 But then, at the age of 18, she decided she needed something different, so she turned her back on movies and enrolled at Yale. She studied psychology there for two years before the lure of acting drew her away once again. I had been tutored on sets, she says, and I didnt have a chance to go to high school, so I just wanted to have a more conventional experience. I learned a lot about how to think critically, but more than that I got to hang out with kids my own age and get a sense of myself. I discovered I have an identity that is completely my own and not informed by public opinion or box-office takings or the media.

 Her private life has tended to involve people she has worked with. She dated Matt Damon while they were filming The Rainmaker and then spent five years with the musician Ben Lee. Her first taste of tabloid celebrity came when Billy Crudup, her co-star in Stage Beauty, left his pregnant girlfriend MaryLouise Parker for her. The romance did not last, however, and she is currently dating her Evening co-star, British actor Hugh Dancy, who is appearing on Broadway in Journeys End and also helping her with her cockney accent. If, like the dying Anna in Evening, she had to assess her life so far, what would her conclusions be? Ive always very earnestly tried to do my best, she says, so I just have to trust that and forgive myself for being fallible.

 Evening releases on September 21; Stardust on October 19.

 Dna dads

 Eddie Murphy, slapped with a paternity suit by Mel B, has been done in by the DNA test, which has established him as the father of Scary Spices four-month-old daughter Angel Iris Murphy Brown. t2 looks at a few other high-profile cases where DNA has determined dads

Steve Bing

 This was much before Liz Hurley became an In

 dian bahu. After her much publicised split with 

 actor Hugh Grant, Hurley met producer-director 

 Steve Bing, the scion of one of the wealthiest 

 families in America. Things seemed rosy till Liz 

 announced her pregnancy the following year, 

 declaring Bing to be the father of her unborn 

 child. But then Bing refused to accept the child 

 as his, claiming the Bedazzled star had not been 

 exclusive during their relationship. Thats when 

 the Brit bombshell burst Bins bubble with a pa

 ternity suit, forcing him to take a DNA test which 

 proved that he was indeed the father. Her son 

 Damian now has a new father in the form of Arun 

 Nayar 

 Mel Gibson

 Mel Gibson isn rsquo;t far from trouble these days. Recently, a young Australian woman named Carmel Sloane threatened to drag the Hollywood superstar to court and subject him to a DNA test, claiming he had impregnated her mother Marilyn on a mattress in the back of his car in 1976, long before he became famous. Carmel also claimed that her own 10-year-old son bore a striking resemblance to Gibson. Already the father of seven, Gibson may eventually have to go in for a DNA test to clear up the mess

 Larry Birkhead

 When Anna Nicole Smith died leaving behind her seven-month-old daughter Dannielynn and a vast fortune, there was a mad scramble among her numerous boyfriends in a bid to prove who had fathered the girl (and so who would inherit the fortune). This included Howard K. Stern, the former Playboy Playmate rsquo;s companion before death, and Frederic Prince von Anhalt, husband of ageing Hollywood sex symbol Zsa Zsa Gabor. A high-profile paternity case and a DNA test later, celebrity photographer Larry Birkhead was pronounced to be the father

 Chris Rock

 Funny man Chris Rock didn rsquo;t find the 

 allegation that he had fathered Kali Bowyer rsquo;s 13-year-old son Jordan amusing at all. 

 The director of I Think I Love My Wife and the brains behind the hit television series Everybody Hates Chris willingly undertook a DNA test which proved him right mdash; he wasn rsquo;t the father of this child after all

 Belly dancing is the secret to Shakira rsquo;s sexy abs

 I am 18 years old, 5-ft-8 and weigh 62 kg. I have a lot of fat on my belly. Please suggest a complete balanced diet and regular exercise regimen to maintain a good figure. I am not too keen to develop muscles but want to get rid of the extra fat.

 Your problem is zonal fat deposition. Your weight is fine but you need to cut down the extra inches around your abdomen. Ab crunches, sit-ups and regular abdominal exercises are best for you. You can start with two sets of each with 20 counts. This is a sample diet chart for you...

 Breakfast: two tbsp cornflakes, one glass double-toned milk, an apple

 Lunch: two rotis, raita one bowl, one piece fish with vegetable stew

 Afternoon: one guava

 Dinner: two slices brown bread, chicken soup one bowl (home-made, with no corn flour), one bowl fruit salad (no mango, banana or jackfruit).

 I am a 38-year-old woman, weighing 80 kg and my height is 5-ft-3. I go for an hour of brisk walking six days a week and do pranayam daily. I do nothing at home. I want to get slimmer. Please prescribe a diet chart for me.

 Your ideal body weight is 55 kg. So you are overweight by 25 kg. Its very good that you go for an hour of brisk walking. Try to make the pace as fast as possible without causing any discomfort. Here is a sample diet chart for you...

 Mid-morning: one apple

 Lunch: one bowl rice, salad one bowl, vegetables one bowl, one piece fish

 Afternoon: ripe papaya one bowl

 Dinner: two rotis, dal with vegetables one bowl, chicken two pieces

 Supper: double-toned milk one glass.

 I am 21, 5-ft-7 and weigh 67 kg. Fat has accumulated on my thighs and hips, and of late my tummy has started to stick out! I have been going to a gym for the past eight months but this has had very little effect. Please suggest a diet chart and exercises to reduce the fat. I am a vegetarian girl.

 Heaven on earth

 Shikara owners pack tourists rsquo; luggage to be ferried to houseboats on Dal Lake

 Kashmir, the jewel on the map of India, boasts of snow-capped peaks covered with dense forests, meadows of flowers, glaciers and adventure sports... 

 How to get there: Take any flight to Srinagar.

 Stay at: You can stay in a houseboat or shikara. Most of the houseboats anchor along the banks of Dal Lake and Nagin Lake. But do remember not to agree on any boat or price without having first seen the boat and met the owner.

 Spot picks: In Srinagar, there are the floating vegetable gardens on Dal Lake, the famous Mughal Gardens and Nishat and Shalimar Bag. A trip to nearby Vaishnodevi is a 12km trek from Katra. Visit Gulmarg for a days excursion to the slopes and go pony-riding through the meadows of Sonmarg. A drive through saffron fields en route to Pahalgam or the Valley of Shepherds should also feature on your travel list.

 Sip bite: There are numerous restaurants, mainly located on the Boulevard, Shervani (Residency) Road, Lambert Lane and Lal Chowk.

 Shop stop: Pick up a Cashmere shawl or stole. Other pop buys include walnut wood carvings, silk carpets, silverware and a shisha (hookah) to puff on with friends back home.

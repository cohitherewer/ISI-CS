 Models at Anjuna. 

 Picture by Pabitra Das

Shobhit Kaseras first boutique, set up after a few years wholesaling and retailing saris, is an effort to reach out to city fashionistas. The designer, specialising in ethnic wear and print techniques on textiles, launched Anjuna at 113 Park Street, Poddar Point, in late July. The 25-year-old has had no formal training in designing, but taking up fashion came naturally. I always had a knack for it and the appreciation I received was encouragement enough, feels Kasera.

 The look

 The 200-sq-ft store oozes elegance. The interiors, with their cream and brown colour code, are subdued and swanky. A metal-and-glass centre table and pastel-hued curtains add to the luxurious feel.

 The collection

 The racks are filled with saris, salwar suits and tunics. The silhouettes are feminine and flattering, feels Shobhit. The colour story includes bright pinks, olive green and bright blues as well as more sedate ochre, earthy tones and off-whites. Printed cotton, camric, kora, georgette, knits and net have been used extensively.

 The fabrics have been given many an interesting twist with embroidery, jute work, phulkari, foil prints, patch and wool work, tissue trimmings, sequins, applique, mukaish, pleating, tucking and cut work.

 The dupattas accentuate the suits some with frill detailing, some printed and some peppered with embroidery here and there. Some come with attached shrugs.

 The sari section has mixed and matched fabrics like tissue and georgette or tissue, crochet and brocade. Wood and metal detailing jazz up some of the drapes. Tissue saris have also been strikingly teamed with brocade petticoats.

 Amongst the range of tunics, the frock-style ones are cute options.

 Saris are priced at Rs 5,500-plus; salwar suits at Rs 2,000-plus. Tunics start from Rs 1,200.

 Spec Check

 Shopright

Theres no denying that some faces look best four-eyed! But if you are a first-timer, chances are you wont be looking forward to this addition to your face. Make your spectacle shopping experience a fun one by keeping an eye out for the following

 Spectacle frames are just as important as the lenses. A poorly fitting frame will cause you to look through the wrong part of the lens.

 For the fashion-conscious, theres plenty to choose from Plastic, metallic, rimmed, rimless, fashion frames and more. From geeky to gorgeous. Remember how Preity Zinta fuelled a black-rimmed fad with Kal Ho Naa Ho? But do check if you are allergic to metal or shell casings.

 Its advisable to go for an eye check-up before you order new lenses. Opt for high-index lenses, which are comparatively thinner and carry your frames along so the lenses are cut to size. 

 Opting for comfort first is a wise choice, even if it means sacrificing a particular design or brand your heart is set on.

 Watch out for uncomfortable bridges that might make marks on the sides of your nose.

 Check the length of the rims (where it ends behind your ears), the spring of the spectacle rim and the weight of the specs. Your sight-savers should be hardy but not heavy on the nose or behind the ears.

 Children are fussy when it comes to wearing specs. There are a lot of funky cartoon designs to entice them and its best if they accompany you for a trial. If you are still having trouble, try mentioning how a certain wizard by the name of Harry Potter would not be caught dead without his glasses.

 Buying spectacles is not something you can leave to someone else. Its important to try the pair of glasses to see that they fit you all right. Seeing really is believing!

 UTTAM AND I

 On his 82nd birth anniversary, three of Uttam Kumar rsquo;s leading ladies share some special moments and memories with t2

Madhabi Mukherjee

 (Chhaddobeshi, Sankhabela, Agniswar, Biraj Bou, Streer Patra, Bon Palashir Padaboli)

 The man...

 Uttam Kumar is like a diamond, the more you polish it the more it shines. That is what happened with him in each of his films. Acting was something he had on his fingertips. I dont know if theres any other actor like him. He had the aura of a star and the genius of acting, which is a rare combination. Before each of his films, he used to do a thorough character study and thats why he never was Uttam Kumar on screen.

 The memory...

 He was also a gem of a person. Every day with him was special; every moment spent with him is memorable. Quite unexpectedly, he came to visit me on the day of my wedding. He made my day in a very special way.

 Anjana Bhowmick

 (Nayika Sangbad, Chowringhee)

 The man...

 He is the ultimate actor that Indian cinema has had. He had a very distinct style on screen and he was very confident. I always found him to be an introvert. He came across as someone who was lost in himself. He used to be very serious on the set. Our style of working was very different then. We were very disciplined; all of us used to rehearse our lines before coming to the set. He used to do that too. 

 The memory...

 We had lots of fun while shooting for Nayika Sangbad. There was a scene where I had a lot of dialogues and also say Jachhetai, but each time I uttered the word wrongly. He stepped in and made the dialogue simpler for me.... He was also a very good singer. 

 Moushumi Chatterjee

 (Ogo Bodhu Sundari)

 The man...

 He was Uttam kaku to me. He used to make my weekends very special as I used to watch his films with my parents as a child. I knew him personally and loved to go to his sets. He loved and respected my father-in-law, Hemanta Mukherjee.

 He was a special human being because he made everyone around him equally special. He treated everyone on the sets with a lot of respect, even the junior artistes. I dont think there ever was an actor with such personality. His character portrayal was so strong; many of his films have been box-office duds but his characters excelled. He was also very hardworking and he knew how to stay fit.

 The memory...

 I have so many fond memories while shooting for Ogo Bodhu Sundari with him. One day, after a shot, he came up to me, put his hand on my head, and said: Aare tui to aaj amakeo kheye phelli (You acted even better than me today)! Thats a moment I still cherish. 

 He had promised that he would cast me in two of his films which he was supposed to direct. And he had planned to visit my in-laws the day he passed away.

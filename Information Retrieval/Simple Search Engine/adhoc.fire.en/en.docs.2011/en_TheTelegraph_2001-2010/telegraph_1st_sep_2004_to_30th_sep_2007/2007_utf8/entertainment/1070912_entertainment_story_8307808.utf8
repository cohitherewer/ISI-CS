Victoria No. 203 has bombed. Now director Ananth Mahadevan is back to what he did best a small-budgeted musical thriller. After Aksar, which was a sleeper hit, Mahadevan is now ready with Aggar, another love triangle gone wrong. The actor-turned-director spoke about this Friday release and more.

 Victoria No. 203 was a fun movie made in 1972. Did the remake fail because today only double-meaning dialogues and slapstick buffoonery are acceptable?

 Subtle humour always has its place. Our attempt in Victoria No. 203 was to modernise a small icon in the firmament of Hindi cinema and turn it into a new-age film. We had a readymade comic caper in which an ensemble cast frantically tries to locate some diamonds, which are stashed right under their nose. The script already had elements of fun and thrills; so there was no need to resort to crude or over-the-top treatment. 

 Everyones said that you have not been able to recreate the sexy Saira Banu towel song...

 Sonia Mehra has carried off the famous towel scene very well without being vulgar. Its actually a seductive number and she was sensuous enough. 

 What do you think was the difference between your film and the original, in terms of treatment? 

 The original was more of a studio-based movie. Except for one or two shots of the song Do bichaare on Carter Road and Juhu Beach, everything else was restricted to the indoors. We have taken our Victoria outdoors. We have shot on Marine Drive at peak hours, with Sonia actually riding the Victoria in the midst of the traffic. A sea change has happened since the original movie was shot. The entire styling and mounting has changed. 

 Despite an ensemble cast, the film didnt work...

 I always wanted to work with Anupam Kher and Om Puri, who are international actors in their own right. I have worked with a wide spectrum of actors, right from Shahid Kapur to Emraan Hashmi. Similarly, I would not want to be restricted to any one kind of film-making. I have done a musical (Dil Vil Pyar Vyar), a romantic comedy (Yeh Dil Maange More), a suspense drama (Aksar) and now I have made Victoria No. 203, a comic caper. Next is Aggar, a romantic thriller, and Anamika, a Hitchcockian mystery.

 Somewhere down the line, I would like to evolve into a serious director who tackles complex themes, on the lines of Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Ingmar Bergman and Satyajit Ray. 

 An original film like Aggar or a remake like Victoria what is more challenging?

 In a remake, the challenge lies in adapting it so well that the viewer does not miss the original. In an original, you start from scratch. Having said that, I would not want to attempt another remake in the near future. I prefer raising the bar and making an original film like Aggar.

 But the music of Aggar hasnt caught on like Himesh Reshammiyas Jhalak dikhhla jaa had done in Aksar...

 We had a great number in the movie and a great soundtrack too. Aksar should be looked at as a different kind of film which we attempted for the first time. In Aksar, the villain actually gets away with murder! I would look at Aksar as an experiment in mind games, rather than focusing only on the music of the film.

 I would have loved to repeat Himesh in Victoria No. 203 but he was busy with his films. Himesh has already gone on record, saying that he will be composing only for himself. Himesh is simply not on the shelves of provision stores anymore.

 But I am glad to have worked with composers like Anu Malik and Mithoon, who have given me great scores in Aggar and Anamika.

 Knowing Naomi

 Naomi Campbell is staring down at her BlackBerry, or whatever it is, mumbling about her fitting. ldquo;I rsquo;m late for my fitting, rdquo; she says, without bothering to look up at the Little People attending her in a hired room at the Belgravia Sheraton. Her nice American PR girl, who is in attendance during London Fashion Week, smiles uneasily and tries to move things along: ldquo;She rsquo;s running around town today. rdquo;

 ldquo;I rsquo;ve got to get to the fitting because I have another show to go to, rdquo; insists Naomi, head still down, keying away like a bored schoolgirl.

 Miss Campbell is mdash; and this is just a guess mdash; late for her fitting. Which is a shame considering she rsquo;s supposed to be giving an interview promoting Fashion for Relief, a catwalk show staged last night and intended to raise money for charitable and community organisations across the country affected by the July floods. The trouble is that Naomi rsquo;s just given one interview to Independent Radio News (IRN) about the fundraiser, and isn rsquo;t impressed that one has to talk about it again.

 The nice American PR girl promises it won rsquo;t take long and Naomi finally manages to tear herself away from her little electronic friend for a brief, desultory conversation about a subject obviously close to her heart. ldquo;Erm mdash; this is the one that affected me mdash; in the images I saw, rdquo; she says of the summer floods, almost comatose with boredom.

 The world rsquo;s most temperamental clothes horse, who started modelling at 16 and built up a pound;20 to pound;30 million fortune shifting frocks for Versace and Ralph Lauren, is dressed down in black today. Although a native of Streatham, she delivers her words in a slow, world-weary faux Manhattan drawl.

 Her lack of enthusiasm is infectious. The mind begins to wander. There must be more pleasurable things to do with a weekday afternoon than sit in this dimly-lit chamber, shifting uncomfortably in one rsquo;s seat along with everyone else while Naomi is ticking away like an unexploded doodlebug. Root canal work, for instance. Anyway, press on.

 So, why the English floods Naomi? Why not raise some money for the Third World?

 ldquo;I do Third World, I rsquo;ve been doing Third World since 1994, rdquo; she says, making it sound like a standard ingredient of the supermodel repertoire, like having your piccie taken, snorting coke, being fawned over and earning pots of money.

 ldquo;There rsquo;s pound;3 billion worth of damage, rdquo; she says, delivering her fact. Then, without even looking at him, she gestures dismissively to the man sitting next to her. A man from the Rotary Club of Great Britain, whose flood disaster appeal is set to benefit from Fashion for Relief explains how the money will help rebuild scout and guide huts and other community facilities.

 But you don rsquo;t really hear what he rsquo;s saying because you rsquo;re looking at Naomi (who rsquo;s gone back to texting) and wondering how safe it is to be with her in a confined space when she rsquo;s packing a mobile phone. It rsquo;s her weapon of choice, you see. She has a habit of throwing mobiles at people. When she rsquo;s angry. Which seems to be a lot of the time.

 Last year, she brained her housekeeper, Ana Scolavino, who required four stitches to her head. Campbell pleaded guilty to ldquo;reckless assault rdquo; and was ordered to perform five days rsquo; community service and attend an anger management course. The community service involved mopping out lavatories at a New York City Sanitation Department depot. Campbell turned up in black stilettos on the first day and a silver Dolce and Gabbana evening dress on the last mdash; which demands a certain degree of admiration.

 It wasn rsquo;t the first time a member of her personal staff had resorted to the law. In February 2000, Campbell pleaded guilty in Toronto to assaulting her then assistant, Georgina Galanis. An expression of remorse staved off further punishment.

 Campbell is currently facing a lawsuit by another former maid, Gaby Gibson, who claims she was assaulted by her and wrongly accused of theft when her employer failed to locate a pair of jeans. But forget the bad times, back to the good work.

 And the inspiration for her charitable work on AIDS prevention in Africa, her main interest?

 ldquo;It rsquo;s not for public adulation. rdquo;

 Of course not. Perish the thought.

 ldquo;I don rsquo;t ask people for anything. I shared this wonderful man Mandela with so many people. I introduced him to someone who runs on the bandwagon for Africa, which I rsquo;m very happy for, but remember it rsquo;s not just a trend. rdquo;

 Oh yes, Nelson Mandela, father of modern South Africa, world statesman and Friend of Naomi Campbell. But shared? Makes it sound as though she has him locked in the pantry.

 Does the criticism in the press hurt? The Sun refers to her simply as Nutta.

 ldquo;I don rsquo;t read. rdquo;

 What, at all?

 ldquo;I don rsquo;t read. I don rsquo;t read about myself. I know who I am. rdquo;

 She was even less impressed when one critic dared to conjoin the words ldquo;fashion rdquo; and ldquo;superficial rdquo; in one sentence.

 ldquo;People look at our business as superficial because they think models just dress up and wear clothes and look glamorous. rdquo;

 Erm. And your point is?

 ldquo;That rsquo;s not true. We work so hard. I live my life on planes. It rsquo;s a job. It rsquo;s our job. Why is it superficial? rdquo;

 Naomi is 37 now, and past her modelling prime. But she rsquo;s resilient and unlikely to go quietly. You can rsquo;t say she doesn rsquo;t have ooomph. It rsquo;s just, one doesn rsquo;t want to be on the end of the ooomph.

 Is that a jewel-encrusted Nokia I see before me?

 What: Bidesia, an evening of Bhojpuri folk songs.

 Where: Gyan Manch.

 When: August 22.

 Tune in: If you think Bhojpuri music didnt have a fan following here in Calcutta, you werent at Gyan Manch on Wednesday evening. Music troupe Ae Babua depicted the plight of Bidesia, male folk who travel the country for a living. The drama that accompanied the live music traced the Bidesias life his joys and sorrows as he packs his bags, settles down, falls in love and even buys a mobile phone for his priyatama so they can stay in touch. 

 Conceptually, we all migrate and that experience is the same for all. Music is the unifying bond that emotes that experience, said music director Debajyoti Mishra, who played the violin and used instruments like the bouzouki and the rabab to create a percussion and peppy feel.

 Vocalist M.K. Singh, RPO and director of the branch secretariat of ministry of external affairs (MEA), was accompanied by a 13-member chorus.

 Rite of strings

 Haydn and Schumann had to make way for Mozart and Leclair, as the Signum Quartett reduced to a trio with cellist Thomas Schmitz having to fly back following a personal tragedy was forced to firefight with an altered set.

 But the difficult situation, which led to the cancellation of three stops on their South Asia tour, and demanded endless extra hours of rehearsing, still couldnt dampen the spirits of Kerstin Dill (violin), Annette Walther (violin) and Simon Tandree (viola).

 The string quartet from Germany, which won the German music competition in 2004, was presented in Calcutta by the Max Mueller Bhavan and The Calcutta School of Music on Wednesday. The venue for the concert was the St Johns Church.

 A string quartet is like a marriage of four people and everybody is responsible for one another. When Thomas had to leave, we reoriented our repertoire to fit in pieces for the violin and viola, said Annette, who had founded Signum with Thomas in 1994.

 Since theres no leader, its a very democratic set-up and everybody gets to emote on a personal level, explained Simon, the sole Englishman in the otherwise German ensemble. Our music is coloured by our personality, but we have to always find a common expression, which is not easy, he smiled.

 Signum, which often performs pieces by contemporary composers like Jorg Widmann, has had mixed reactions from audiences in Europe about its style. With us, being contemporary is an egoistic issue and not designed to suit audience preferences, stressed Kerstin.

 A string quartet is supposed to be a classical composers visiting card. But Signum dares to be different and flexible in its style of rendition. To survive as a musician, you have to find a niche, an audience, felt Simon.

 But its equally important to educate and orient the audience towards change and progress, felt Annette. You might say Im going to a concert to relax, not to get provoked. Or you might say, Wow, whats going on!. Its your point of view.

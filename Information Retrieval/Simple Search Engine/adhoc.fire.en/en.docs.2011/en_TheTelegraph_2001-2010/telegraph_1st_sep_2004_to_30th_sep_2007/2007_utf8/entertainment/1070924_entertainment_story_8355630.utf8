 Anything but love

 Why are so many women in painful relationships where they cannot live with or without their man? Plus, SWASTIKA MUKHERJEE as love doc 

 Kate Moss with Pete Doherty

They make you want to bang their heads together. As a doctor Im aware that this intervention has no clinically proven therapeutic effect, but the desire to do it is overwhelming. Kate Moss, according to rumours, is now back with her on/off boyfriend Pete Doherty, despite claims that she had cut all ties with the man she dubbed the slug (because hes slimy and leaves a trail of mess in his wake). 

 She has apparently been spied sneaking out of the hotel where Doherty was staying, having walked free from court when a police blunder meant he escaped being sent to jail (yet again). He had faced imprisonment after breaching bail conditions and has so far managed to avoid jail despite a string of convictions for drug offences.

 It makes you wonder exactly what you have to do before you get slung in prison these days. Kates family and management are said to be in despair that the two are together again. Perhaps they could take solace in the fact that the family of the award-winning singer Amy Winehouse are also pulling out their hair over her recent behaviour, which includes drug and alcohol abuse. 

 There have been allegations that Blake Fielder-Civil, her husband of three months they married on a whim in Miami introduced her to class A drugs. Despite this, she remains loyal to him, refusing to go into rehab unless he accompanies her.

 So what is it about such highly successful women, who youd think could have their pick of eligible men around the globe, that keeps them running back to such characters? Amy and Kate are not stupid. They must know that they are at risk from their respective beaux pulling them into a quagmire of misery and self-destruction. 

 But for some people there is something strangely seductive about such relationships. W.H. Auden wrote: Almost all of our relationships begin, and most of them continue, as forms of mutual exploitation, a mental or physical barter, to be terminated when one or both parties run out of goods.

 Pete Doherty and Blake Fielder-Civil have something to gain, but whats in it for Kate and Amy? Could the appeal of these relationships lie specifically in the fact that they are so painful, so destructive? Psychologists might argue that such cases are part of an acting out of a malignant, deep rooted self-hatred. 

 People engage in these types of relationship as a form of self-punishment, usually in response to a notion of perceived personal failure. The fact that Kate and Amy are rich, talented and famous doesnt matter maybe, deep down, they dont think they are worthy of anything better, despite family, friends and legions of fans trying to tell them otherwise. I have sat countless times in A amp; E talking to women and it is usually women in destructive relationships, who are adamant that they cant live with their partner but cant live without them either. But I love him, doctor, they say, as I suggest they pack their bags and run for the hills. It is impossible to make them wake up and see what their partner is doing to them, for the simple reason that they already know but choose to ignore it. While the treatment they endure at the hands of their partners would prove too much for most people, it is precisely this which is what makes them stay. Its the old adage of treat them mean to keep them keen.

 Simply haranguing them to leave their partners isnt enough and rarely produces lasting results. They cant leave their partner because, subconsciously, they feel that they are worthless and this is all they deserve. Its a notoriously difficult psychological position to shift people from, because it operates on the fundamental level of how people perceive themselves. And, as Kate and Amys family could testify, its heartbreaking to stand on the sidelines and watch it happen.

 One way for women in such situations to be able to extradite themselves from these sorts of relationships is to address their underlying self-esteem issues through psychotherapy. But this can be a long-drawn-out process and its frequently too painful for people to address what they have spent so long burying.

 Perversely, in the early stages of psychological work, its often felt to be less painful for them to continue in their destructive relationship than it is to face up to their own problems. Substance addiction is similar to the addiction people exhibit to these pathological relationships; its about eradication and denial of the self.

 Its no coincidence that both Amy and Kate have been associated with other self-destructive behaviours, such as alcohol or drug misuse; if someone else isnt hurting them, they do it to themselves. These kinds of relationships are often also associated with co-dependency, whereby one person enters into a tumultuous relationship with another which they then become consumed by, rather than address their own problems.

 This means that the relationship is ultimately unfulfilling emotionally, but it is precisely this nihilistic quality that is so appealing. But both parties suffer as a result. These women collude with their drug-taking partners, who further perpetuate the cycle of self-destruction by rewarding them with their love and attention.

 Poor Kate and Amy. Theyll never find someone suitable to love until they start to love themselves a little bit more.

 All their friends and families can do is hope this happens before things get any worse for them. And resist the temptation to bang their heads together.

 She loves... she loves me not

 Imaad Shah rsquo;s curly hair can make your heart go blip-blip

 I had fallen in love with a girl four years ago. I stuck to my principle of not approaching any girl, but letting the girl approach me, as I feel that is the basis of a steady relationship. Two years later, she approached me. We were doing well, but after a few months, she backed off, giving various excuses about her career and family. After that I have lost faith in girls completely. I havent got involved with anyone else. But since the girl in question hasnt been involved with anyone else either, I cannot move into any other relationship because I feel guilty, as my friends say she still loves me. What should I do?

 Where did you get this bizarre idea from that if a girl approaches you, you will have a steady relationship? Basically, this is just a fancy way of saying that you are too afraid to make the first move. From what it sounds like, you arent willing to take any emotional risks at all. Sorry boy: nothing ventured, nothing gained. 

 If you like this girl and want her, youll have to do something about it and fast! Finally, if you really do want to see other girls, why are you wasting your time and mine by writing in?

 I am a 20-year-old girl. Any guy with curly hair turns me on. He may not be the best-looking guy around but his curly locks are enough to make my heart go blip-blip. Is this normal?

 Name withheld

 Sweetheart, I think you know the answer to that. Of course it is not normal! Its called a fetish. And if you dont want to scare all the guys around you into getting their hair straightened, I suggest you see a head doctor. And a heart doctor, too, because that blip-blip noise isnt normal either!

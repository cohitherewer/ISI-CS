The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Relaunch revelry

 Dublin rocks once more. Picture by Rashbehari Das

 Dublin, which had dropped off the city club scene for some time, is back. The nightclub at the ITC Sonar Calcutta, which got off to a rocking start when it opened four years ago, gradually fell off the radar of the party people. But it has announced its return with a soft reopening last week.

 After more than a year-and-a-half of doing little to draw back the crowds, Ikraam Aulakh, manager of Dublin, and resident DJ Harish put out the message through word of mouth. Harish even used Orkut to campaign, putting up an ad in his scrapbook. And the response was phenomenal. Old-time Dubliners were so happy that we are back, beams Ikraam.

 Dublin looks much the same as it always did, with a few touch ups here and there. We have improved the lighting. We are also very careful of the people that we let in. We want to project Dublin as a safe, friendly place, where women would feel safe to come even without an escort. We want a healthy blend of youngsters and corporates, explains Ikraam. Prices have been relaxed to facilitate this mix. 

 Cashing in on its proximity to Sector V, the club has already tied up with a number of BPOs with special offers for its employees. And while experimenting with different kinds of music will be the highlight, the club intends to promote karaoke, a territory still largely unexplored in the city. 

 To start with, Dublin which will serve the usual tipple and finger food will be open till midnight on Wednesdays and Sundays, 2am on Fridays and 4am on Saturdays.

 Expert advice on skin woes 

 SACHIN VARMA, CONSULTANT DERMATOLOGIST, ANSWERS YOUR SKIN QUERIES

 I am 56 years old and my facial skin has started losing its elasticity. Can you suggest some medicated creams to keep wrinkles at bay?

 Arati

 A plethora of anti-wrinkle products is available, but choosing the right one is a difficult task. Those with proven benefits include Vitamin A products such as retinoic acid, which diminishes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles by sloughing off dead skin cells and increasing the production of new collagen. It also helps fade uneven pigmentation and reverse early sun damage.

 Alpha hydroxy creams (glycolic acid creams) also help skin exfoliation and collagen regeneration. Idebenone is a new molecule showing promising anti-ageing results. You can look for these contents on the label before choosing your product. 

 What can be done to achieve glowing, flawless skin? 

 Sonia

 Smooth flawless skin is the foundation for a perfect look and its what everybody desires. While some people are lucky to have smooth, flawless skin genetically, for others, regular skin care using proper cleansers, exfoliants, moisturisers and sunscreens and getting enough sleep and exercise and a balanced diet, helps.

 Medically, glycolic peels, non-ablative radio-frequency devices, micro-dermabrasions and lasers can enhance your skin glow when used in conjunction with the above measures.

 My Woman, My Woman, 

My Wife

 Women want wives to get an edge over men at work. Chandrima S. Bhattacharya needs one too but for different reasons 

Women want too much. Now they want wives. A recent foreign agency report says that several women, who have earned their place in their professions, want wives. They say they require wives as they require spousal support, also to get ahead at work. It is too often that men at the office pip them to the CEOs post because they have wives behind them. The women say they require wives because their employers assume they have wives. 

 The real challenge, they feel, is that companies expect women to perform as if someone is at home taking care of everything for them. But for women, that someone may be nothing more than a washing machine with a timer. Or an electric oven with a timer that promises to cook while you are away, though it chars the dish at the bottom. 

 Besides, these professional women dont like the way a man locks the door. A mans attitude towards his home is evident in the way he locks it and just leaves, they say. But when the woman walks out, she is still worrying about the house looking nice and orderly. She carries the house inside her head to work. She needs to share the burden. She needs a wife. 

 A nice, old-fashioned stay-at-home wife. Actually the demand for a wife is not so new. As early as 1971, Judy Syfers wrote a piece in Ms magazine titled Why I Want a Wife. Syfers, a wife, had wanted a wife who would work and send her to school again, take care of the children, of their doctors and dentists appointments, who would take care of her physical needs, of the details of her social life, not interrupt when she talked about things that interested her and her friends, who would assume complete responsibility of birth control and be faithful to her so that her (Syfers) intellectual life was not cluttered with jealousies. But the wife should understand that the person she has married (in this case Syfer) can have sexual needs that may entail more than a strict adherence to monogamy. 

 Its strange, though, how similar a feminist writer from the Seventies in the US, and working women from 30 years later, sound. Women are hard to satisfy. Now that they have got into the workforce, they can only react by being unhappy. Or is it that things havent changed that very much? 

 But I want a wife, too. Not to get ahead at work. I realise that men have better things to do than think of their wives advancement at work, such as watch Sun TV while dinner is cooking. 

 And behind every successful woman, anyway, are mainly a bank loan and her parents. There may be a gaping man too. I dont need a spouse to worry about my work. I also think its quite all right to lock the door, even slam it, and forget about the house, unless the stove is left burning. I need a wife, however, for other things. 

 To pick up the empty bottles of water rolling on the floor when I come back home. To fit the right bottle with the right cap. To pack leftovers in the right containers, so that a spoonful of dal is not put away in the largest microwaveable bowl. To fold the dry clothes. To know which clothes to send to the dhobi. To throw the empty cigarette packs into the bins. To sort out the DVDs, lying on top of each other, and to put them back in their rightful covers. To know what to do with the million scraps of paper that stick out of the computer, the music system, the table lamp. To organise the change of bed-sheets. To find an orderly kitchen even after a dinner has been cooked. To empty ash-trays. And maybe, just maybe, to listen to me when I talk about the ubercool thing I did at work. 

 Of course I will be exaggerating, but women have a right to show off too. I want a wife. Is it wanting too much?

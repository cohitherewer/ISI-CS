The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Top of the WORLD

 Team India lifts the Twenty20 World Cup trophy (above) Irfan Pathan, the Man of the Match in the final against Pakistan

 There was a lot that sent the keyboards clattering last week the winners of two grand events, Twenty20 and Indian Idol 3. Closer home it was the downpour distress that set the blog world abuzz. 

 The final thriller between India and Pakistan gave the people enough reasons to leave the office early, writes a blogger. Another would remember this as the day I saw India lift the cricket World Cup for the first time this time the Boys in Blue have helped fulfil a dream. A dream shared by millions in a country where cricket is a cult cutting (across) the lines drawn between Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs and numerous other religious entities dotting our great motherland. Yet another drew a parallel between Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Prashant Tamang. .Both from humble backgrounds, both from eastern India and both from places very little-known. They are the people who will inspire a new generation of young Indians to believe in themselves This, my friends, was not just about music or cricket or entertainment. This was a celebration of new India. 

 A very observant blogger noticed that when runner-up Amit Paul visited the Meghalaya CM, the Tricolour kept on the desk of the CM was upside down! John Abraham announcing the winner, how the telethon went on and on, and on and showed no signs of wrapping up, the count of votes that went up to seven crore and how the words Indian Idol are powerful ones but how long are their own dreams sustained before they are disillusioned the banter was enough to fill a book. 

 The two words mouthed the most in Calcutta this week, a blogger writes, were jol water and brishti rain. He observed: What is striking me in Bengal, people are very peaceful when it comes to flood issues. They continue everything they anyway do, but a little slower but I wasnt. I hope the sun will help us out. 

 For those feeling rich having stayed with the rocketing stock market over the past few years, a blog reads: Investors are not willing to look back even with the market at dizzying heights Investment gurus think there is a rising tide of good cheer what with the World Cup and Sensex at 17,000. Some of the braver ones talk of 19,000! That sounds good. 

 On the movie front, cinema lovers are waiting for good weekend releases to hit the plexes. Coming Friday, there are two things Im keenly waiting for. One is to somehow lay my hands on Halo 3 (the third video game in the Halo Trilogy). And the other is to see how the new movie Johnny Gaddaar turns out. The songs have been playing on my iPod in a loop for about 3 weeks now.

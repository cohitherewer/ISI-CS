The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Cutting chai amp; Vada-Pav

 Shahid Kapur on his tastes and preferences, when it comes to cooking and eating.

The first thing I have in the morning: Is a cup of tea, to wake me up. I cant eat too much in the morning. So I generally have some fruits and a glass of protein shake.

 My diet: Is pure vegetarian. I turned vegetarian after reading a story about a cow being taken to a slaughterhouse.

 My lunch consists of: Simple ghar ka khana when I am at home. If I am shooting then I often order from outside. A soft drink is a must with my roti, sabzi, dal and rice.

 My favourite dishes are: Rajma Chawal, Shahi Paneer, Vegetable Pulao, pizzas and pastas. When I was a non-vegetarian, my favourite meal was Butter Chicken and Naan, and the biryanis made by my grandmom.

 The number of meals I have in a day: I need to have small meals frequently. I am a very light eater.

 The food at home is: Either Indian, Chinese or South Indian stuff like dosa and idli. Sometimes its a cocktail of the above.

 Salads are: Not a must for me. I am not a salad person; salads are ideal for those who want to lose weight.

 In the evenings I snack on: A small meal of carbohydrates a couple of bananas, a boiled potato or a grilled sandwich. This is generally before I go for my workout at around 5.30-6 in the evening. I work out for an hour-and-a-half. But I dont build up too much muscle as it will not suit my face.

 My dinner is: A regular meal. When I am not shooting, I spend my evenings with my friends or at home watching a film. I like going out for a sizzler or a Chinese meal with my friends.

 My moms cooking: Brings to mind the excellent baked vegetables in white sauce that she makes. I just love it. Mostly, however, she just manages a cup of tea as she is too busy doing other things, and hardly has the time to go to the kitchen.

 My cooking abilities: Are not bad. I can cook amazing omelettes and a variety of parathas pyaaz paratha, aloo paratha, pudina paratha. I can make very good tea and Maggi noodles.

 My favourite dessert: Is hot gulab jamun with ice-cream. But I am not a dessert person. I eat chocolates and ice-creams once in a month.

 My favourite restaurants are: Olive, Pizza Hut, McDonalds for their burgers, and Yokos for their sizzlers. I go a lot to Sampan with my dad. When eating out my priority is food over the ambience. I enjoy even eating raste ka food if it is good. I love the paneer roll at Bade Miyan.

 For a romantic meal: I would like to go to Lonavala or Mahabaleshwar.

 I stay away from eating: Roadside food during the monsoons. Hygiene is very important for me.

 My favourite beverage is: Diet Coke or a Diet Pepsi. On a hot summer day chilled lemonade is ideal.

 My favourite cuisine: Italian and Chinese.

 My favourite fruit: Mango

 I love having: Vada-Pav a lot, kahin ka bhi chalta hai. I also love the cutting chai. On the sets I have 5-6 cups of tea.

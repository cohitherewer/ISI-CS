 Short takes

 How long does it take to script, shoot and edit a film? No more than 48 hours, discovers judge Jack!

 Yours Emotionally!, a UK-India co-production shot in 10 days 

 Whether based in Bollywood or Hollywood, film-makers generally agree about one aspect of the movie industry: it eats time like nobodys business. True, some films can be put together speedily: a feature-length film I acted in a couple of years ago, Yours Emotionally! (2006), was shot in just 10 days. But more often than not the process of moving successfully from script to cinema to DVD release can swallow up three years, five years even a full decade. So when I was approached by New York-based film makers Jeff Clinkenbeard and Kyaw Tha Hla to judge the results of their 48-hour film challenge in which contestants had been given just 48 hours to script, film and edit a short film I was swiftly enthused.

 Jeff and Kyaw, whose work has been screened at Sundance, were inspired by a 48-hour film challenge they once took part in as contestants in New York. Kyaw and I wrote the script and we werent even in the same city, Jeff recalled of the experience, which led to them winning a Telly award. We just emailed each other back and forth all night while the crew slept and then, when they woke up, we had the script and they started shooting and we went to sleep.

 Sato 48, the duos own film challenge, was held in April in the less cosmopolitan town of Springfield, Missouri (Sato stands for Springfield And The Ozarks). That is, according to Jeff, in the middle of the middle of the middle of the United States. Over 40 teams from the area took part.

 To ensure they had not planned anything in advance, immediately before the clock started ticking teams were all given a mandatory theme and prop. The theme was revealed as instances of luck and bad luck and the number 13 (The kick-off date fell on Friday the 13th, Jeff explained), while the prop was a mysterious plastic twist-top box apparently derived from a pharmaceutical company. The rules forbade Jeff or Kyaw to offer participants any help. But that didnt hamper the teams determination to produce some top work.

 As one of the 11 judges, I found the output impressive: a zombie film, a macabre corpse comedy, a story about a child maths-geek in love, a surreal dream sequence and a comedy following a guy who falls head over heels for a girl with 13 terminal illnesses, were among the best offerings. At the awards ceremony held on Saturday, the film about the maths geek, Kirby and the Love Equation, swept the board. An assured and pacey rom-com balanced out with a dash of pop philosophy (and a superb child performance), it won in seven categories including Best Cinematography, Best Male Performance, Best Direction and Best Screenwriting. Best Film was taken by Twist, an effortless comedy showcasing an inspired intermingling of the required theme and prop.

 So is there any chance that Sato 48 could branch out from the middle of the middle of America? Jeff tells me that if all goes to plan in the future the challenge will be held with simultaneous teams in Springfields two sister cities: Tlaquepaque, Mexico, and Isesaki, Japan.

 Indeed, in this age of the Internet, anything is possible. Jeff admitted that getting work in Hollywood remains very, very, very difficult. But these days almost anyone with a little technical expertise can put their film online. Id say its up to the individual to create the product, the marketing campaign, the feedback loop for the fans and always have another project in the works, said Jeff. Now that sounds like a plan.

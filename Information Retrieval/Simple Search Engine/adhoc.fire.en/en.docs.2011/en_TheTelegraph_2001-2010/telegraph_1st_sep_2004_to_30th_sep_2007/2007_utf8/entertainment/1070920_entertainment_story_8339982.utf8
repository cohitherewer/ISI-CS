 A woman president. Its a first for the 106-year-old Saturday Club and in any other leading city club. t2 caught up with Renu Roy, who took over the reins after the club AGM on September 19, to find out what her tenure at the top might bring.

 Social call: Saturday Club is more of a family club now, although it started as a sports club, feels the new president. Saturday Club at 7 Wood Street has one badminton, two squash, and five tennis courts along with a billiards room and swimming pool and one cannot miss its buzzing atmosphere. 

 Future plans: Like any other club, the priority is maintenance of all facilities and then enhancement, says the 59-year-old. There are plans to improve every area of the club catering, bar, sports, entertainment and cultural programmes. Overhauling of the kitchen, improved cuisine, tightening of administration, constant beautification, addressing suggestions from members the goals are many. 

 More specific (possible) changes are reviving ladies coffee meets and a lift to the first floor. Smart card facilities were introduced two months ago and we hope to make the club more smart-card friendly. Its important for billing, transparency and preventing loopholes, says Renu. 

 There are plans to focus on the youth the bar with its vibrant music, pub and disco-nights, cultural programmes and plenty of sporting options make it a youth-oriented hub.

 The committee itself has a mix of young and senior members who will work shoulder to shoulder, explains the lady behind Spandan, the gallery, theatre and film production banner. 

 Profit plans: Even if a major part of revenue for most clubs comes from sponsors, it is important they generate some income through their own facilities.

 There are certain areas that must be made into profit centres, even if they have been running on losses, says Renu. Since sports is subsidised it is important to focus on other areas like marketing of rooms and halls to increase the business of the club.

 While all this is great news for members, theres some bad news for aspiring ones. Membership is closed, says Renu, except for members children, corporates and NRIs.

 Just wanna have fun

 Suresh Menon, Kiku Sharda, Maninee De, Ashwin Mushran, Howard Rosemeyer and Kunal Kumar at the Mumbai launch of Sab Ka Bheja Fry

 Bheja Fry is now on television. No, we arent talking about the TV premiere of the Sagar Ballary film. Sab Ka Bheja Fry is the new crazy comedy show on the small screen. Starting tonight (Monday to Thursday SAB TV 10pm), Bheja Fry will be a comedy show with three separate sitcoms being aired in every half-an-hour episode. All of five minutes, each sitcom will focus on one of the four characters created for the show.

 So, theres Tension Tambi, played by the talented Kiku Sharda, who is always tense about something. It can be as vague as why there are two potatoes on your plate and one potato on mine, says Kiku. His entire existence is based on the concept of what if. What if this roof came crashing down. There is not a moment of peace in his life.

 Muft Ka Chandan, played by Suresh Menon, is the guy who refuses to pay for anything. I would never find my wallet when required or have change when needed, smiles Suresh. While I am not like that in real life I have friends who are like that.

 Then theres Kunal Kumar as Feroze Faltu, who thinks he is the biggest don around. The only problem is that he is the only one who thinks that. 

 And finally theres Rakhi Sawant. No not of na de chumma fame but Ali Asgar. He is called Sawant and he has more than 1,000 sisters but not a single girlfriend.

 Its a completely original and new concept and only after we try it can we say whether it works, Anooj Kapoor, business head of SAB TV, tells t2. On our channel we have romance (Love Story), friendship (Four) and action and drama (Left Right Left). Sab Ka Bheja Fry will fill the missing comedy slot. Comedy is something which the youth of today most identify with and the tagline of our channel is Mera Bharat Jawaan.

 Besides the crazy comic characters, there are small skits running with the show. Sab Ka Big Boss is about a much-hated boss in office. Oudhvasta is a mad epic, very much like the Mahabharata staged in Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron. And Ustad Janab is about two bumbling cops always getting into trouble.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 You cant

 GET THROUGH THIS WEEK WITHOUT...

 Hogging on hilsa 

 Treating yourself to a lavish hilsa lunch or dinner. Steamed, smoked, baked or fried... Or wrapped in leaves, eaten with tamarind, mustard and mangoes. Those with a weaker heart should try it deboned, minus all the tricky bones. Go out to a traditional Bengali restaurant if you lack the time or expertise at home and indulge in all the traditional recipes from your grandmothers time with piles of steaming rice.

 Tea tasting

 Try out exotic varieties of tea and tea infusions on offer in the market. De-stress and detoxify your system with a dose of fruity combinations like mango-strawberry or kiwi-lemon. The exotic green teas with hints of orchid, peony, hibiscus, orange, berry and mint not only revitalise your system but also help fight the rainy-day blues keeping colds and coughs at bay. So trade in your coffee mug for a delicate China teacup and revel in the aroma of steaming chai!

 Post- Rakhi workout

 Its okay if you threw caution to the wind and greedily gobbled up all that mithai on Rakhi but now its time to make amends. Stay far away from sweets, avoid visits to your relatives and call up your fitness instructor fast. Make an emergency appointment or just gatecrash into the nearest gym, if you want to fit into those clothes you just got gifted!

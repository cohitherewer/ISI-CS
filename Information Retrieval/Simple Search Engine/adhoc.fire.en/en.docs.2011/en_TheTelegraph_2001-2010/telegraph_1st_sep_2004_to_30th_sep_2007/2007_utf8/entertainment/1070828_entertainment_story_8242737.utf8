 I never kiss and tell

 EMRAAN HASHMI on how women make him tick. 

Emraan Hashmi the Serial Kisser is now a married man. Here he opens up about birds and bees.

 In Murder, Mallika Sherawat feels guilty about her extramarital affair but you as her lover dont. In reality, would you be guilty about seeing a married woman?

 I would. But falling in love cant be explained. And everyone makes mistakes.

 Would you steal your best friends girlfriend?

 No, though I have been in a similar situation. I liked a girl and so did my best friend, but before it got messy, I found out that she liked my friend. So, I was the loser. Guys dont scheme, so if I know my friend likes a girl and she reciprocates his feeling, I will back off.

 And a woman what would she do in a similar situation?

 I dont know about women. They dont usually confide in men.

 Would you have considered marriage for reasons apart from love?

 I married only for love.

 What is your take on arranged marriage? 

 To each his own, but I dont believe in it. Even today, more than half the population subscribes to the idea of an arranged marriage but it doesnt work for me. You will be surprised, but a lot of my friends, who claim to be very modern and urban, want to settle down with a girl of their parents choice.

 What is your take on premarital sex?

 I have no problems with pre-marital sex or live-in relationships. There are certain societal norms, but accepting them or rejecting them is a matter of individual choice. I choose not to accept most of the norms because I dont feel right about them.

 Who has shaped your opinions?

 Its an amalgam of many influences. My dad is a Muslim and has traditional beliefs. I am partly liberal because of my friends, both in school and college, and also because my mom is Catholic. And Mr Mahesh Bhatt has been a major influence in my life. He is my mentor, my guru. He advises me not just about my profession but also my relationships, my mistakes, everything.

 Did you exchange notes with your buddies on how you scored with women?

 I never kiss and tell.

 What, according to you, spells trouble in a relationship?

 A quest for one-upmanship. I have never experienced it because I see a man-woman relationship as one between equals.

 When did you first become aware of the other sex?

 In school, in the eighth standard.

 Who enlightened you about birds and bees?

 My parents, like most of their ilk, shied away from it. I learnt a lot from my friends.

 Were you awkward with girls at any age?

 Never, I always had girls and boys as friends.

 Did you take the initiative? 

 It works both ways for me. I dont pile on to any woman.

 What is the boldest pass that you have made?

 I caught a girl and smooched her before telling her that I loved her.

 Did you have any opening lines? 

 No, I am terrible in that. I am terrible at saying sweet things, saying romantic things. Even if I rehearse my lines, I end up fouling it up. I just cut to the chase.

 If a woman were to rely on the mirror rather than you to seek approval of her looks, would you take that as a slight?

 I think it is very essential to make a women feel good about herself but I wouldnt get upset if she chose to rely more on the mirror.

 What if a woman tells you that you are a bad actor?

 I would definitely feel upset.

 What if she says you are a good man, but not good-looking?

 I would be upset.

 Are you vain?

 I think most actors are vain.

 Do women like to be flattered more than men? 

 I think everyone likes to be flattered, women and men. But nothing works as well as a genuine compliment.

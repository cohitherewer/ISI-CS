The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 32 sweet teeth!

 - Ishaa koppikars gift of the grub 

 ISHAA is on a roll with rosogolla.

The first thing I have in the morning is: A glass of lukewarm water followed by a cup of tea. Breakfast is either home-made poha, upma, idlis or cereals. And a fruit.

 My dietary habits are: Quite regular. I eat six small meals a day when I am dieting. But when I have finished a long shooting schedule, I take a break from my diet and binge.

 My lunch is: Simple Maharashtrian food. Dal-sabzi, maybe rotis. Non-vegetarian food is not a must with me.

 I am fond of eating: Seafood. I am a fishetarian. I eat chicken once in a while but I prefer seafood fish, prawns, crabs everything. Aah, the thought of rawa-coated Bombil fish being shallow-fried is enough to make me hungry.

 My favourite vegetables: French beans, potatoes, bhindi. I love aloo ki sabzi.

 The vegetable I hate: Brinjals.

 My evening snack consists of: A few Marie biscuits or maybe a brown bread sandwich and a cup of tea. Occasionally, I love to have pani puri.

 For dinner I have: Either salads or a grilled fish.

 I try and avoid: Too much carbs, but when I am slightly relaxed I indulge a bit and gorge on maybe a fried rice and a pastry.

 My favourite fruits: I am not really a fruit person. My favourites are mango when they are in season. I am allowed to eat one mango a day. I also eat litchis, jackfruit, custard apple, bananas and apples.

 My fitness regimen: Comprises eating right and working out for an hour-and-a-half every day. I do some cardio, a little bit of stretching and exercises for the abs. I also maintain myself by practising martial arts and Kathak.

 A food item I always carry: My Shake packets which have both carbs and proteins. My trainer has given them to me.

 My Sunday meal comprises: The mutton that my mom makes at home because my dad and my brother love it. Sometimes she also makes a chicken biryani which is a favourite of mine.

 A food memory: I studied in JB Vachha, which had several Parsis. I would eat Dhansak for lunch every other day.

 And I would visit our neighbours the Shanbhags for lunch, every Sunday. Mrs Shanbhag would make very good green chicken. My brother and I had named it Pachis chicken (Pachi means aunty in Konkani). I still visit them at times.

 My cooking skills are: Limited. Maggi and egg fry are my specialities. My mom is the best cook in the world. My naani, who is now no more, was even better. Naani didnt eat non-vegetarian food but she was fabulous at cooking it. My mom makes excellent Kashmiri chicken, dahi chicken, pizzas and excellent Chinese food. She is famous for her mutton masala.

 My favourite dessert: I dont have a sweet tooth I have 32 sweet teeth! I love rosogolla and ice creams. My aunt Vidya Koppikar also makes a great sponge cake its soft, porous and melts in your mouth. And I am a chocolate person I adore chocolate pastries.

 I like to add to my food: A dash of lemon.

 My favourite cuisine: Thai, Chinese, Goan.

 My favourite restaurants: Trattoria, Indigo, Peshawari and Thai Pavilion (for its prawns). Abroad, I like the Thai food at the Blue Elephant.

 The most memorable food on a holiday: It was in Goacocktail sausages, pork vindaloo, ham and cheese omelettes in the mornings at the Leela Cafe.

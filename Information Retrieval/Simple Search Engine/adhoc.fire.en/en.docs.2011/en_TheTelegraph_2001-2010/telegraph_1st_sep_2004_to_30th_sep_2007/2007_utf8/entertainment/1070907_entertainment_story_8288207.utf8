 Ever wondered how the choice of reel contributes to the visual richness on celluloid? With a gang of Tollywood film-makers turning up for support, Fuji Film launched Fuji Eterna Vivid 160 at Taj Bengal on Wednesday evening to help them explore and experiment. 

 We have come to Calcutta after launching it in other metros, said Sanjay Patel, managing director, Fuji Film, whose biggest market rival is Kodak. 

 To mark the occasion, two demo films, Once Upon a Time in a Shed and Seeing directed by Sanjeet Chowdhury, were screened at Gorky Sadan. Abhik Mukhopadhyay was behind the camera for both the films. I have never tried Fuji for any of my films, but now I will. The colours look more real on screen as the Fuji negatives match the Indian skin tone. Fuji is a little more economical though the difference between Fuji and Kodak is marginal, said Abhik. Film-maker Bappaditya Bandopadhyay observed: I shot Kaal with Fuji negatives. The film was visually rich. Kantataar was shot on Kodak. I think Fuji gives a more enhanced look.

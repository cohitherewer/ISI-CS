 Bobby Deol on what rsquo;s on his mind and body

My fashion statement: A black suit is a classic that always makes an impact. But I am a colourful person so I also tend to wear colourful clothes. I like the colours white and purple, the latter because my son too loves it. But my favourite outfit for a casual occasion would be a pair of jeans and a black shirt.

 My opinion on film clothes: I am largely asked to play rich men on screen; so I get to wear good clothes.

 My film costumes are coordinated by: My wife Tanya. She and I buy clothes during our shopping sprees overseas and coordinate them in accordance with the look that we have planned for that particular film. At times I get my outfits stitched from Gabbana. When Tanya was expecting our second baby, my clothes were done by Manish Malhotra for Barsaat.

 My favourite designer: No one in particular. I hardly shop in Mumbai. And abroad it is all about discovering while shopping. Umesh Jivnani and Manish Malhotra are good at their job.

 My favourite perfume: Creed, Christian Dior, Country, B Men.

 My colour: Black.

 My fabric: Cotton.

 My jeans: Andrew Mackenzie.

 My shoes: The shoes I pick depend on the comfort level rather than the brand.

 My suits: Armani.

 My watch: Is a gift from my wife. The brand is U-Goat.

 For my wedding reception, I wore: A black suit from Prada while my wifes lehenga was an Abu-Sandeep creation.

 My favourite fashion accessory: I love sunglasses and end up purchasing more than I need. Maybe, when I grow old, I will organise a display of my collection of glares!

 The most expensive accessory I own: I have a watch similar to the one worn by Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator 2 or was it 3?

 An outfit I will never wear: A lehenga and dhoti-kurta.

 An outfit that I regret wearing: The girls nightie I wore for a scene in Aur Pyar Ho Gaya.

 The best dressed men in the industry are: My father (Dharmendra) and my brother (Sunny).

 The best dressed woman in the industry are: Er nowadays where do they wear clothes?

 I sleep in: A night suit.

 My tip for those who want to be well-dressed: Wear what you are comfortable in, or you will stand out like a sore thumb.

 Experimenting with hair is: Something I have always done. I had started straightening my hair just before shooting for Soldier, long before rebonding became fashionable. I grew it long, cut it short, then I coloured my hair, straightened it and grew it all over again.

 I wash my hair: Everyday because in our profession we are always sweating under the glare of harsh lights. I dont have any particular brand of shampoo it could be LOreal, Wella or a name which I cannot pronounce!

 My natural hair colour is: Brown.

 My hairstylist is: Aban at B-Blunt.

 My tip for good hair: Dont mess around with it too much or you will lose it!

 According to my wife, my sex appeal lies in: My personality.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 America born desi character

 Let the Aishwarya Rais and the Hrithik Roshans of the world chart their own Hollywood course but one man has been consistently registering quite a desi impact on phoren shores. A bad man at that! After many a cameo in many a Hollywood flick, Gulshan Grover will now appear as one of the main characters in a new American comic book called Nephilim, published by Marsh Hawk Productions of Los Angles.

 I dont really know these people but I am in the entertainment business over there, Gulshan tells t2 in between dubbing sessions for Mahesh Bhatts Showbiz. People know me and are aware of my work. So rather than any particular film or role, this whole gesture is kind of a tribute to my entire body of work. Its certainly a first for an Indian actor.

 The closest Indian movies have come to American comic books is when the Simpsons had a character named after Satyajit Rays character Apu. But for the character of Azazel, the main villain of Nephilim, it was more than just a name. They studied my features for quite some time and then saw thousands of still pictures and also some footage of my films, reveals Gulshan. So if this character Azazel is shown jumping in the comic book, it should seem like me jumping.

 Nephilim is being created and directed by Danny Wilson and produced by Susan Moses. We decided to cast Bollywood star Gulshan Grover because he has universal demographic appeal, says Susan in a written statement. We wanted to introduce a powerful Indian character and he was the best choice. Hes also a known name in the Western market. His performance in Hollywood films like Jungle Book II was loved by the Western audiences.

 For Danny Wilson, the bad man of Bollywood Gulshan Grovers screen persona and variety of characters that he has played is really fascinating. We watched many of his films and it was difficult for us to decide what sort of character to create. We finally created our very own villain, Azazel.

 With the comic book due soon, the film adaptation is not too far away. Its like a dual deal, says Gulshan. The movie will be shot early next year, where I am going to play Azazel. It will be a big movie with a budget of close to 30-40 million dollars. Since the setting of the comic book is very unrealistic, a lot of money has to be spent on the visual effects.

 First up is the comic book. They are not targeting India as one of its markets but now with me in the scheme of things, they may just launch the book here, says Gulshan.

 Being appreciated for his turn as the Anti Terrorist Squad boss in Pooja Bhatts Dhokha, Gulshan is on a high. Usually actors my age have a declining graph but mine is completely upward, he says. Whether its the salary or the length of role, I have never had it so good. Up next, you will see me as a media tycoon in Showbiz who is after everything except TRPs.

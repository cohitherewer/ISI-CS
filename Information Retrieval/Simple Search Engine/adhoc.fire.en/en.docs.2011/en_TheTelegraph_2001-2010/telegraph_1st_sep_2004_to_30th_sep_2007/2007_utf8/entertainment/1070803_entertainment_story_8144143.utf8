 Brotherly love, once more

 Onir (right) with music director Gaurav Dayal

 After My Brother... Nikhil, its going to be My Brothers Bride for Onir. Yes, the Jadavpur University graduate did make Bas Ek Pal in between, but Onir would rather reprise the success of his brilliant debut. Now, before you assume anything, My Brothers Bride is not a sequel to My Brother... Nikhil. In fact, as Onir says, it has nothing to do whatsoever with his first film. I just found My Brothers Bride to be the apt title for the movie; thats it, laughs the writer-director over phone from Mumbai.

 So what is My Brothers Bride all about? Its a sweet romcom among other things and while I can tell you the storyline in one line, its all about how it all unfolds, says Onir. But what is really interesting is the cast of the movie. While Sanjay Suri, Onirs My Brother... Nikhil producer, is, of course, there, Sharman Joshi and Soha Ali Khan are the other young actors roped in. Add to that the Honeymoon Travels oldie pair of Boman Irani and Shabana Azmi. They all look their parts above anything else.

 Onir is producing My Brothers Bride himself and has gone ahead and recorded a couple of songs for the film in Delhi. If Bas Ek Pal had introduced singer-composer Mithoon in a big way, Onirs new film will introduce music director Gaurav Dayal. Even we got a new singer named Abhishek to sing the first song Jalte hain, reveals Onir.

 Only after My Brothers Bride will Onir start shooting his version of Chashme Buddoor.

 Mr Locomotive

 Must-have movies - The General

 Buster Keatons enigmatic, hooded gaze lends him an aura of modernist cool that eluded all his rivals. His influence extends far: Samuel Beckett made his sole foray into cinema Film with him, and the artist Steve McQueen paid homage in Deadpan, his Turner Prize-winning short. Keatons own The General was released 80 years ago, to cool reviews that announced the decline of his career. Today it looks freshly minted.

 Remarkably, its a comedy based on an historical event from the American Civil War. The title character, however, is not a military officer but a steam locomotive. Keaton plays its dedicated engineer, Johnny Grey. There are two great loves in his life: the General and a dizzy Southern belle, Annabelle Lee, in that order. At her urging, he attempts to enlist in the Rebel army and is rejected: he is more useful driving his train. If you lose this war, dont blame me! he exclaims (although The General is silent, the dialogue intertitles also contain some excellent jokes). 

 When Johnnys train is highjacked by Northerners he sets out after it on another locomotive. Unknown to him, Annabelle is on the cherished General and, when he recaptures it, she assumes he was risking his life for her. Sensibly, he does not disabuse her. Shot in the wooded hills of Oregon, because it had the right gauge of railroad, the film looks exquisite. The story falls into two satisfyingly symmetrical halves Johnny goes North in pursuit of the enemy, then retraces his route pursued by them and its brilliant audacity is to mirror the gags on the return trip, with ingenious embellishments.

 Keaton vaults around dangerously, but with a serene acrobatic grace. And its still impossible not to catch your breath at the scene in which a real train plunges off a burning bridge then the most expensive stunt in silent movie history.

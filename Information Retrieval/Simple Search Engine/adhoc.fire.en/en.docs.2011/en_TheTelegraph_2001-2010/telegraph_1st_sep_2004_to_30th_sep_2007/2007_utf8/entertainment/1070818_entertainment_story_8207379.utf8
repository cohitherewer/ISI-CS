 Say no to a sedentary life

 A young man wants to know how to gain weight. Another wants to fight his double chin. Preetom Mukherjee Roy has the answers

 I am 21 years old, 5-ft-10 and weigh 53kg. I joined a gym two months ago and practise freehand exercises. I want to put on weight but being underweight, I feel weight-training wont be beneficial for me. Also, my friends say that seven hours of sleep is enough but anything below nine hours seems to disturb my system. Is that normal?

 Weight training is the way to go and will be most beneficial for gaining weight. Remember that muscle weighs more than fat so putting on muscle will not only make you stronger and look better but will also help you put on weight. Start with an easy weight-training programme and gradually build up. You must also follow a proper nutrition programme where you get ample amount of proteins. Generally, adults need six to eight hours of sleep, but in certain cases one might need nine hours. Everyones body is different so there is nothing wrong with nine hours of sleep.

 I am a 22-year-old boy with a sedentary lifestyle. I experience pain in my thigh during winter which makes me limp for two to three days. Please diagnose my problem and suggest an exercise routine. I will be joining a job soon. Previous visits to doctors have proved futile.

 I would need more details to properly diagnose your problem. However, it seems that there is a lack of proper blood circulation. 

 You need a more active lifestyle, which includes at least 30 minutes of cardiovascular activity five to six days a week along with yoga. Start with that and let me know how you are feeling.

 Also try getting a massage from a qualified masseur once a week to improve circulation and relax your muscles.

 I am a 22-year-old electronics engineer. I am 5-ft-5 and weigh 69 kg. My face has become puffy with bulging cheeks and double chin. What can I do?

 You need to lose 10kg by using an age-old method. Follow a balanced diet, do at least 30 minutes of cardio five to six times a week and try resistance training at the gym. Remember to breathe properly during your workout as this will give you an automatic facial workout. 

 As for your double chin, try an exercise called neck pull. Tilt your head back so you are staring at the ceiling. Now use your lower jaw to simulate a biting action. Counting to five slowly in your head while biting would be one set. Repeat this several times throughout the day.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Where beauty meets brains

 Model-actress Aditi Govitrikar breezed through town for the launch of the Ponds Miracle boutique at Forum. Women can walk into the store for skin analysis and get expert advice from dermatologists and specialists, and receive customised solutions for their skin problems.

 Dressed in a light summery outfit with her flawless skin aglow, Aditi had this to say to t2 about films, family and more:

 Is the profusion of age-defying creams an indicator that Indian women are becoming more conscious about their looks?

 Thank god for them! The increasing number of such products in the market has created awareness about skin care. The fact that they are popular means that finally Indian women are beginning to look after themselves, which is a great thing. 

 Are you seriously associated with the Ponds brand?

 I have personally been associated with Ponds for a long time as it was the first brand I ever modelled for, and when they asked me to be the face of their Miracle product line, I immediately agreed. Also as a wife, a mother and a former Mrs India, I represent the kind of image they want to communicate to the women of the country. 

 What about films?

 I have a few releases coming up, including Victoria No. 203 directed by Ananth Mahadevan, where I play a proud and haughty south Indian actress. And theres Smita Thackerays Kaise Kahein, which is a modern-day love story that pits romance against a career. I like working in ensemble films and hope to get more roles in that genre. I am also doing a number of ad campaigns and music videos.

 Doctor, Mrs World, actress, homemaker, mother of a seven-year-old daughter.... How do you balance so many selves?

 Medicine has always been my first love and I hope to return to it someday. As for the rest, my family has always been a huge support for me. I won Mrs India after I had my daughter. Its always about balancing commitments. If I travel for consecutive days then I take some time off to spend with my daughter. We go on regular holidays to spend time together.

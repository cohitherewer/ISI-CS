The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Of innocence amp; experience

 Days dedicated to the girl child lead Chandrima S. Bhattacharya to wonder what perfect little Indian girls are made of

A reader helpfully suggested that since September 24 was celebrated as Girl Child Day by some NGOs, I could write something on the said girl, perhaps on the role she plays in mainstream Indian cinema. An Indian greetings card company added more grist to the mill: it had declared September 23 as Daughters Day. Though theres already a Sons and Daughters Day, it seems, at large in the Western world and there are several other Daughters Days in several other parts of the world, such as Shanghai, and I dont know if they celebrate one in Iran at all, but the more the merrier since it is still not clear what daughters are exactly supposed to do on Daughters Day. 

 I thought it was a good idea anyway to spare a thought for the girl child. But I got stuck again, at the phrase girl child, wondering how the afterthought child was added, what for, and was it right to use the phrase outside the context of gender discrimination or human rights violation or disempowerment. Girl child kind of demands handling with care, which the word girl doesnt. But this was not the way to think. I should have been focussed. So I started to think of fairly recent Indian cinema, the kind that is seen by people and not only at festivals abroad, and I came up against the biggest hurdle then. 

 Except in Vishal Bharadwajs Makdee, where the heroine is a delightful little girl, there is no girl there. She is missing. I could only recall two or three other films, but I would like to hit all of the creatures that were passed off as girls, or girl children, in those films, real hard. In Black, the little girl was used as nothing more than an exhibition of disabilities, rather violent. 

 But the first on my hit-list is the girl who appeared in the Karan Johar blockbuster Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, the film with the tagline: You know you are in love when kuch kuch hota hai. The first half was shot at a campus where the actors, Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and Rani, were only meant to give a demo of what being young and cool was 10 years ago, something the Nineties India was just discovering, along with miniskirts, tank tops and international brands. Things became really bad later. By the interval, Rani had died, after marrying SRK and leaving him with a daughter and the daughter had grown into a little lady, not more than 10 years old. She was the most precocious thing. She was well versed in all the lessons of life. Her mission was to manage her fathers love life. She decided that her widower father needed a woman, who was Kajol, enlisted two elderly people in her cause and was carefully engineering every situation when SRK would bump into Kajol, when I began to fear that she would start to plan her fathers suhaag raat soon, with some expert advice. While obviously she was the directors and the crowds idea of the embodiment of cute, lively innocence, I was feeling murderous. 

 At this point, a fight broke out between my friend, who had bought the tickets, and I. He said I was silly to take a film so seriously. I said he had offended my soul. We began to argue so badly that we had to leave, film unfinished. 

 I felt almost the same kind of anger while watching a more recent film, Cheeni Kum. A little girl, suffering from a terminal disease, is the 64-year-old Amitabh Bachchans friend, philosopher and guide in his quest for the love of a 30-something woman, Tabu. The girl gives her advice on every move he makes in the form of catechism, the question-and-answer format being all that more authoritative. AB in turn gives her adult films to watch. She is called Sexy. 

 And I had met a beautiful TV child star once. She was 12. She exuded such composure that she left me shaken, making me feel like a child. Four years later, she is a Bollywood heroine. With such girls, who needs old women? On the other hand, according to reports, the Calcutta girl Priyanka Todi, though 23, was not thought old enough by her family to choose a husband.

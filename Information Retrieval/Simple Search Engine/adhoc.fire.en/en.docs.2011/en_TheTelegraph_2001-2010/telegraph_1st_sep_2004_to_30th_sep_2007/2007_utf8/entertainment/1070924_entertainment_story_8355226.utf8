Grips theatre is returning to the city stage after a long gap with Akash Mati Hawa Jal, directed by Jayoti Bose and produced by Max Mueller Bhavan (MMB). Its part of an Indo-German collaborative project on environmental awareness. 

 The last time actors of Sutrapat did a Grips play was Care Kori Na (adapted from Max and Milli, MMB 1993) and Robot Kupokat (an adaptation of Trummi in Pieces, MMB 1994). Grips plays began as a reaction against the Christmas Fairytales which was the only stage fare available to German children in the 60s. 

 In 1966 Volker Ludwig and Rainer Hashfeld established Grips theatre in Berlin which dedicated itself to portraying the real world through the eyes of children. Grips is a Berlin slang for little head. 

 Grips plays, now written and performed worldwide, deal with contemporary situations and topics children really care about. Instead of didactic speeches or readymade solutions, the plays show children how to ask the right questions. The message is merged with fun, suspense and laughter. 

 Akash Mati tells the story of Anu (played by Momo), a young girl from a small town who has an amazing ability to sense all forms of pollution. Anu comes to live with her big-town relatives; soon after she and her cousins demand explanations why grown-ups seem hell-bent on destroying the environment they love.

 Keeping future tours in mind a minimum of sets and props have been used. The language is easy for children in the 10-11 age group to follow.

 Actors Kaveri Basu, Sangita Mondal and Sudipto Das are excited about the project. Like most Grips plays, Akash Mati addresses children of a particular age group. Care Kori Na had 200 shows all over the city and in the outskirts. These shows often ended in rounds of interaction with children, said director Jayoti Bose.

 Akash Mati premieres in the MMB auditorium on September 30, followed by shows on October 6 and 13.

 Repertory is weary

 The National School of Drama (NSD) Repertory Company enthralled audiences on September 8 and 9 with Bhavabhutis Uttarramcharit at Kala Mandir. But though the folk contemporary form adopted by director Prasanna seemed to work fine with its embellishments of colourful designer costumes and music, there was dissatisfaction in the ranks.

 Professor Suresh Sharma, an NSD alumnus who has headed the Repertory Company for eight years, looked tired. We are always on the move. We just had shows in Thiruvananthapuram and now we will be staging the play in Silchar and Dehradun.... he said wearily.

 With just four A grade and 16 B grade artistes, the Repertory is finding it hard to tour the country. Its time the Repertory is extended to at least two teams. One team should only present classics, while the other can concentrate on experimental plays. The groups could be on tour by turn as there is a need for both kinds of plays, added Sharma. 

 With its golden jubilee celebrations coming up in 2008, Prasanna is directing one of the three major productions. I will direct one of the plays which will tour the country. It will probably be a Tagore, one of my favourites like Muktadhara, Raktakarabi or Chitrangada, he said.

Resurrection:

 The dress rehearsal for a new remake of Andrew Lloyd Webbers 1971 rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar in Madrid, Spain. The musical follows the life of Jesus in the last days of his life. Jesus Christ Superstar has been reproduced regularly around the world in the 20 years since its first appearance. It ran for eight years in the UK. (Reuters)

A monarch in decline

Ian McKellen bares his soul and a bit more in the Royal Shakespeare Companys King Lear. The actors superb recreation of an ageing monarch is electrifying. When McKellens formidable presence is holding forth on stage (in London), the play blazes with an emotional directness that cuts right to the heart. 

 Director Trevor Nunn has set his King Lear in a kind of Shakespeare never-never land, a vaguely grandiose 19th-century environment complete with ominous organ music. 

 This has been a year of Lears, from Kevin Klines oddly robust king at New Yorks Public Theatre to Brian Bedfords more chatty, melancholy monarch at the Stratford Festival of Canada. McKellen, his hair and beard a shocking white, is the most successful of the three, expertly capturing the mans physical and mental decline. As the play opens, he ambles on stage in disarray. McKellen has an intimate, conversational way of speaking Shakespeares verse. It never sounds phony or histrionic, yet he manages to find the poetry that snakes through all the major speeches.

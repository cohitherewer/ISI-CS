The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Still got soul

 AROUNDTOWN

 Udit Narayan performs at Nazrul Mancha.

 I did such a show for the first time. It was a great experience for me, rdquo; says Udit Narayan of his experience as an Indian Idol judge. ldquo;I am, however, a very emotional person and cannot be rude to anyone. But on the show, I have to be rude at times. That rsquo;s something I don rsquo;t like, rdquo; he admits. 

 So Bollywood rsquo;s one-time numero uno playback singer was his cheerful self when he came to town for a fund-raising concert organised by the Indian Life Saving Society at Nazrul Mancha on September 3. 

 And who, according to him, is likely to bag the Idol crown this season? ldquo;I really cannot comment on that. There are three contestants left on the show. Any one can win, rdquo; smiles the Ae ajnabi man, all bold and bling in a turquoise suit, white shirt and white trousers. What of Calcutta boy Emon Chatterjee? ldquo;He does have a great chance of winning the contest. He is a good singer, rdquo; smiles Udit. 

 And what about those cat-fights that break out every now and then on the show? Are they real or stage-managed? ldquo;Everything is for real. That is why it is a reality show, rdquo; Udit insists. 

 Udit is all geared up for two of his releases mdash; Farah Khan rsquo;s Om Shanti Om and the Sanjay Dutt-starrer Mehbooba. 

 His old catalogue still works wonders with the Calcutta crowd. Thundering applause greeted him as he took the stage. Papa kehta hai started off the proceedings and Kitna pyar tumko, Jaanam dekhlo, Nazar nazar, Tere naam, Mein nikla gaddi leke followed. The show was interspersed with compere Shakeel Ansari rsquo;s antics.

 Be fit amp; fine

 Fitness pro preetom mukherjee roy tells you how to get the balance right.

 Dancing is an effective way of staying in shape 

I am 23 years old and my height is 5-ft-4. I weigh around 70 kg. The fat is accumulated around my abdomen and this has become a serious problem. I used to do cycling, swimming and Bharatnatyam. But now I am working, and have no time. I swim on weekends and have bought a manual treadmill. Please suggest a routine so I can lose weight before the Pujas. My daily menu now is:

 Breakfast: A bowl of cornflakes or Maggi, a glass of fruit juice

 Lunch: Roti/rice, dal, fish/chicken

 Evening: A packet of biscuits/vegetable sandwich

 Dinner: Rice, dal, fish, vegetables.

 You didnt mention how much time you have for exercise and when you would be doing it. I also needed to know the portions of your current diet and meal timings. What you are having sounds okay provided you are following this and not snacking in between.

 Here are a few tips: 

 a) Dont have fruit juice; have a whole fruit.

 b) Make sure there is some sort of protein mixed into your Maggi, like egg whites or paneer or you could even have a glass of skimmed milk with it.

 c) Make sure dinner is over by 7.30 pm.

 d) Make sure you have breakfast within an hour of waking up.

 e) Add a helping of salad to your lunch and dinner.

 f) Do not eat outside or have junk food more than once a week.

 g) Do 15 laps minimum when you swim.

 You need to do at least 30-45 minutes of cardiovascular exercise six times a week. And do ab exercises on alternate days. I dont know if it would be possible for you to do so much with a manual treadmill. An electronic one is much better and is easier on the knees and back.

 Here is an ab routine:

 1) Ab crunches 3 x 25 repetitions (for upper and mid section of abs)

 2) Reverse crunches 3 x 25 (for the lower and mid section of abs)

 3) Side bends or oblique crunches (for the love handles)

 Hope you look great for the Pujas!

 Swimming tones the whole body and provides an excellent cardiovascular workout

Hi, I am 20 years old, 5-ft-5 and weigh 95 kg. I know I am overweight and have tried going to the gym to jog. But the problem is that I study abroad. So, I have to stop my workout after a month of hard work. I managed to lose quite a bit in this time, but once I leave, it stops and I gain almost the whole lost weight. What can I do?

 I really wish you had given me more details about where you study and your current diet. But I will give you a few tips to get you started. The next time you are in town, you should meet a professional who can set up an entire programme for you. 

 When you go abroad, you must continue your exercises. It should be a part of your daily lifestyle and not just something to do on vacation. If you stop doing cardio, you will obviously start gaining everything back. I am sure your university has a gym, or you could go for a 30-minute walk. As far as diet goes, heres an example of a balanced one: 

 Breakfast: Cornflakes with skimmed milk and fruit or multigrain or whole-wheat toast, a boiled egg and fruit.

 Mid-morning snack: A fruit or vegetable juice or a protein shake or a cup of yoghurt or a granola bar

 Lunch: 1 cup rice/1 roti, salad, cooked green vegetables, grilled chicken/fish/paneer/soya

 Teatime: Half a sandwich or a granola bar or a protein shake

 Dinner: Same as lunch. Or soup and salad if you really want to lose weight fast.

 Festive fit

 Fitness pro Preetom Mukherjee Roy offers tips on how to lose and gain weight.

I am 15 years old. My height is 176 cm and I weigh 68 kg. What should be my ideal weight? I want to lose weight before the Pujas. I have got a gym at home, which has a treadmill, a cross-trainer and a multi-gym. I can afford two hours in the gym daily. Can you please suggest a workout routine and can you also draw up a diet chart?

 Your ideal weight range would be about 62-66 kg. You need to lose about two kg and probably firm and tone your body. Two months is a lot of time for your goal and you should be looking amazing for the Pujas! You seem to have all the right equipment and enough time to use it. Without knowing what you have in your multi-gym station, I cant devise a program. However, you should start by using the cross-trainer and treadmill for about 30-45 minutes total, six times a week. Try doing ab crunches/reverse crunches/oblique crunches to firm and tone your abs. Do three sets of 25 repetitions for each exercise.

 As far as your diet goes

 Breakfast: Cornflakes/muesli/cooked porridge with 200 g of milk; 1 cup tea; cottage cheese on toast

 Mid morning: 1 small glass of tomato/pomegranate/grapefruit/orange/apple juice or any whole fruit

 Lunch: Salad of cabbage, lettuce, carrots, cucumber, tomatoes; 200 g curd (plain or as raita); 1 medium roti (or equivalent)

 Tea: 1 cup tea; 1 toast or a tomato, lettuce, cucumber sandwich made with one slice brown bread

 Dinner: Clear tomato/spinach/mixed vegetable soup; 25 g dal; cauliflower/brinjal/spinach/okra; 1 toast or roti; 1 portion of fruit. Oil allowance for the day: 10 g.

 Im a 19-year-old boy. My height is 6-ft-5. The problem is that Im very underweight. My body weight fluctuates between 46 and 47 kg. Im a vegetarian but occasionally I eat eggs. Please suggest some ways to increase my weight. Is doing push-ups at home okay or should I join a gym? What are protein supplements? Help me as Im fed up of my slim frame.

 Atul

 Wow! Youre really, really tall and like you said, extremely underweight. You must gain around 45 kg soon. The good news is that since youve already grown to your maximum capacity, slowly, over the next couple of years, your body will put on weight. Trust me! The key for you is the right diet and protein supplements (Ultimate is a good company to go for if youre buying whey protein supplement). Because you are vegetarian, you need high-quality protein in your daily diet, which is all a protein shake is. You also need to join a gym and add weight/strength training to your free-hand routine. Try this diet to get started:

 Breakfast (7-8am): 2 pieces of toast; 2 eggs; 1 portion fruit (banana) or milk with chocolate/Bournvita/Proteinex OR halwa, 2 eggs, fruit and milk.

 Mid-day (11am): Protein shake OR 1 roti with scrambled egg (whites only) and cheese, a milkshake and French fries (baked or fried)

 Lunch (2pm):Rice, roti or bread with paneer/soya/rajma/chhola/chana and green vegetables/salad

 Tea (4-5pm): Protein shake or fruit/sweets/puris/chaat/French fries/Ice cream (before your gym workout)

 Dinner (8-9pm): Rice, bread, noodles, pasta with similar proteins as lunch and green vegetables.

 Try to go to bed by 10pm. Drink a glass of milk and have a handful of raisins just before that.

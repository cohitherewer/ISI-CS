 Movers amp;

 - Michael Moore is only the latest in a long line of film-makers 

 to make an impact as documentarians. These interventions 

 stirred the world into action

 Philip Horne

 Minamata: The Victims and Their 

 World 

 Dir: Noriaki Tsuchimoto, Japan

 From 1932, the Chisso chemical companys plant in Minamata, 

 Japan, pumped highly toxic methyl mercury into Minamata Bay, 

 which then accumulated in fish and shell-fish eaten by locals. 

 Serious neurological damage ensued. First manifested in children 

 in 1956, the cat dancing disease epidemic led 

 to a long campaign by victims. Tsuchimotos documentary, 

 filmed over a decade, follows the families who sued the company 

 and won. 

 McLibel 

 Dir: Franny Armstrong, UK 

 Underdog activists Helen Steel (a gardener) and Dave Morris 

 (a postman) had distributed leaflets against McDonalds 

 only to be crushed by the corporation in the courts under 

 UK libel legislation. But then the first version of Armstrongs 

 no-budget film appeared. A new version of the documentary 

 won a US cinema release and McDonalds stopped 

 advertising to schools.

 Death of a Nation 

 The Timor Conspiracy 

 Dir: David Munro and John Pilger, UK 

 Crusading Australian journalist Pilger shows ferocious persistence 

 as he investigates the way things work in the globalised 

 world. He indicts Henry Kissinger and Gerald Ford (and Britain 

 and Australia) for complicity in Indonesias invasion 

 of East Timor. Pilgers expose fills our minds with 

 the haunting sense of what else governments may be doing 

 in our name.

 The Thin Blue Line 

 Dir: Errol Morris, USA

 Aided by a gloriously menacing Philip Glass score, ex-philosopher 

 Morris brings lucidity and persistence to this influential 

 masterpiece, revealing a symptomatic miscarriage of justice 

 in the Texas penal system. The film got Randall Adams, a 

 drifter in the wrong place at the wrong time accused of 

 killing a policeman, off death row.

 Michael Buerks BBC 

 report on Ethiopia UK

 Buerks report seethes with impotent anger at having 

 to bear witness to a tragedy bigger than anybody 

 seems to realise, getting bigger by the day. Theres 

 admirable restraint in the representation of the famine 

 in which an estimated one million people died.

 For Freedom 

 Dir: Hussein Torabi, Iran 

 The theocratic Iranian Revolution in 1979 drove the Shah 

 away and brought back Ayatollah Khomeini from exile in Paris 

 to assume power. This record of the tumultuous events leading 

 to the US hostage crisis, and the Iran-Iraq war, is shown 

 every year on Iranian TV on the anniversary of Khomeinis 

 victory.

 The Triumph of the Will 

 Dir: Leni Riefenstahl, Germany

 What a cast: Hitler at his smiliest, Goering, Himmler, Bormann, 

 Hess, Heydrich and thousands of Nazis at the 1934 Nuremburg 

 rally. It played its part in bringing Europe to a crisis 

 in which tens of millions died. Less likeable than Chaplins 

 Hitler in The Great Dictator, but who can deny Triumphs 

 hypnotic power?

 The Sorrow and the Pity 

 Dir: Marcel Ophuls, 

 Fr-Switz-W Ger

 Until this great film, the French stuck to the official 

 Second World War myth in which plucky resistance to the 

 Nazis and Vichy was the rule and collaboration the exception. 

 Through a patient accumulation of interviews, Ophulss 

 devastatingly intense four-hour story of the four years 

 of occupation establishes that France was the only invaded 

 country in Europe whose government enthusiastically collaborated.

 Heshang The River 

 Elegy 

 Dir: Xia Jun, China

 This controversial six-part TV documentary, said to have 

 created the conditions that led to the bloodily suppressed 

 protests in Tiananmen Square, was shown in June 1988 and 

 banned in 1989, but only after being watched by 200 million 

 people. The film apparently argues that Chinas history 

 consists of a sequence of failures and missed opportunities, 

 and calls for thorough Westernisation. It has never been 

 shown outside China.

 Bowling for Columbine 

 Dir: Michael Moore, USA

 Moore won an Oscar for his sledgehammer agitprop investigation 

 of Americas 11,000-plus annual gun deaths. This entertaining, 

 unscrupulous, outrageous tabloid essay focuses on the events 

 in the Columbine High cafeteria on April 20, 1999. It supposedly 

 made Wal-Mart stop selling bullets. Moores real target 

 is TVs racist scare-mongering and the culture 

 of fear it creates.

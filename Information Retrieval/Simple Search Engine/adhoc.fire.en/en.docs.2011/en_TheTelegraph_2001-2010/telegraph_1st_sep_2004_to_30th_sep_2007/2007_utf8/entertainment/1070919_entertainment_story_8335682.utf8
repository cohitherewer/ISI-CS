The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Theyve got lucky lips!

 This one promises to end in a photo finish. As the countdown to the Indian Idol finals reaches a crescendo, the title contenders Shillongs Amit Paul and Darjeeling boy Prashant Tamang are all well aware of what bearing this final week can have on the rest of their lives. In town on Saturday evening to perform to a packed house at Nicco Park, t2 caught up with the small-town boys who have mesmerised us.

 On the final week jitters

 Amit: We have done our bit. Now it is up to the people to decide. I would be lying if I say that I am not anxious, but whatever the result is, the truth remains that what Indian Idol and the people of this country have given me is something that I hadnt imagined even in my dreams. My life has changed completely in the last couple of months.

 Prashant: Tension toh hai, but Amit and I are good friends. I am glad that both of us are in the finals. I am enjoying the fame and adulation that I have received through this contest. Now it is all upto God and upto the viewers.

 On the frenzy in their hometowns

 Amit: Shillong was a completely different town when I visited it last week. It all seem so unreal.... A couple of months ago, I was this common person walking on the streets of Shillong and on my return to the city, there were thousands of people waiting through the day just to catch a glimpse of me. Many had walked miles just to shake hands with me, talk to me. But what really struck me was that people from all communities and religions have suddenly become a single entity in Shillong. I feel so happy that I have been able to do something like this. It means so much to me.

 Prashant: The people of Darjeeling and all the Nepalese people have stood by me from day one. It is because of them and the Calcutta Police force that I have come so far in this contest. The love of my people is what has kept me going.

 On what gives one the edge over the other

 Amit: I honestly dont know (smiles). Prashant is a great singer and a very close friend. I guess the one thing that works in my favour and what the judges have constantly been emphasising is that I have a very different and individual voice which is very good for playback singing.

 Prashant: I have the love and support of my people which is my greatest asset. But having said that, I strongly believe that Amit has all the qualities of being the next Indian Idol. I will be the happiest if he wins the title.

 On life after Indian Idol

 Amit: This contest has given me tremendous exposure and a superb platform. Irrespective of whether I win the title or not, I will use this platform to further my singing career. I am here to stay.

 Prashant: Singing has always been my first love and that is what I intend to do for the rest of my life.

 On their lucky charm... 

 Amit: My black shoes. I have been wearing them ever since the Indian Idol auditions and I intend to wear them till the finals. They have truly been lucky for me.

 Prashant: The support of my people has been lucky for me.

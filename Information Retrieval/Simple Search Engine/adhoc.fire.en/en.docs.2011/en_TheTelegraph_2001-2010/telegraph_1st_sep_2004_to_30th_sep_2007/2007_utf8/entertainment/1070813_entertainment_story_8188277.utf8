 Picture by Rashbehari Das

 Anchal Tondons bag venture is an effort to create a real place when shopping for bags. Elaborates Anchal: When I went bag hunting, it was a tedious job, looking up six stores and finally liking one. So I opened a one-stop store that would cater to all needs party, daily, wedding Her one-and-a-half-month old boutique, The Bag Store, at 30/1, Ritchie Road is a healthy mix match of all kinds. The decor: From the walls to the cabinets, the 300 square feet outlet is all-green. Pastel rough tile finish flooring is in sync with the dark tan wooden grids on the ceiling. Glass racks stack the line-up of bags.

 The collection: Leather, suede, leather substitutes, patent leather, cotton, canvas and raw silk have been moulded into different shapes and exciting colours. Watch out for animal prints this season, says Anchal. At The Bag Store, crocodile and snakeskin finish catch the eye.

 Leather and suede bags are perfect picks for daily use. Hobos gathered at the mouth and with adjustable straps come in browns, blacks and red. The good old jhola has moved over from fabric to leather.

 Cotton in self-embossed paisley prints with metallic straps or silk clubbed with matte leather finish the result is fashion fusion that works.

 The clutches are striking, some are studded with stones and others embellished with Swarovski, and some silver bags boast filigree work. 

 There is a line with tissue flower trimmings that oozes Victorian charm. At The Bag Store, potlis have been given an unusual twist mouth with silver and metal clasps with all-over embroidery. 

 Fun wallets in canvas have bright hand paintings. Jazz up your existing carry-ons with stone and metallic accessories. Also on offer are jootis and belts. Bags are priced at Rs 650 and can go up to Rs 20,000.

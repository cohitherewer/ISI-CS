The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Big man of small screen

 Hiten Tejwani is armed with a TV resume that spells success. With Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, Kutumb, Karam Apnaa Apnaa... the actor has done it all. And, if thats not all, he even found time to shake a leg on a reality show.

 Hiten Tejwani is counted amongst the most successful and dependable actors on television today. Has the journey been difficult?

 Its been a six-and-a-half-year-long journey. Ive been fortunate to get consistent, quality work. Ive seen so many actors rise, shine and then just fade into oblivion. I definitely consider myself to be very blessed. Plus, when people take my name, they associate it with good work. Of course, Ektaa (Kapoor) has got a lot to do with it as Ive done most of my work with her.

 Hasnt working exclusively with Balaji limited you?

 See, everything I am today is because of Balaji. I cant suddenly say Ive arrived so ta ta. It would be completely unwarranted. Ive always believed in professionalism and ethics and feel that the reason Im blessed is because of the way I conduct myself. Plus, Balaji also gives me the chance to reinvent myself with great characters.

 Do you bring method acting to television?

 See, its difficult to really call it method acting. Sometimes I think about the scene beforehand, but mostly when I get the scene I just totally get into it. I love the expression that comes with spontaneity.

 But there is hardly any scope for spontaneity on television...

 Within the limitations of TV, Ive enjoyed my share of spontaneity. Like for instance my character Karan in Kyunki has gone through every emotion possible. Ive been lucky to explore my range within my characters. Again, I must thank Balaji for the opportunities.

 Are you open to roles for other producers?

 Right now, I dont have the time. My priority is Balaji. It has given me roles most actors can only dream of.

 And how does that make you feel?

 I think every human being craves recognition. Its a great feeling to know that the 13 hours we put in daily have such an impact. It encourages one to strive to do better work. I have fans of all ages. Karan worked with everyone. Sometimes women come up and say they want a son like me. Theyve named their kids after me.

 So there is a sense of responsibility...

 Yes, I feel guilty when I portray extra-marital affairs because the audience doesnt distinguish the reel from real sometimes. I think it sends out a wrong message. But at the end of the day its my job and in some ways I have no control over it. However, I would never do a cigarette commercial or endorse alcohol.

 Speaking of extra-marital affairs, your character falling in love with Ipshitas character in Karam Apnaa Apnaa did work...

 I think it has worked for me. If you follow the track you will see that I havent done anything immoral. Ipshita cheated me. I just got all the sympathy (laughs). I would never do something like that in my personal life.

 Is it a plus having a wife (Gauri Pradhan) on the same sets?

 We are often asked how we live in each others pockets all the time. But if you look at a typical day, we hardly get any quality time together. She has her shoots and I have mine. But we do enjoy each others company.

 Isnt there a flip side?

 The flip side of working together is that you share the same workspace and may tend to let your personal problems flow in from home to the sets and vice versa. If you have had an argument at home, it is easy to continue it on the sets but we have laid down one important ground rule: we sort out our issues in private. If that does not work, I do have my own make-up room which gives us a degree of privacy (laughs).

 Do you feel that television today is regressive?

 Yes, I believe that. Weve had enough of saas-bahu shows. People have shifted from the saas-bahu format. Reality shows are doing so well. I believe that the viewing preferences have to change. People will definitely get bored of the same thing over and over again.

 What about films?

 I would love to pursue the silver screen. Sadly, time constraints and lack of interesting roles act as a deterrent. Im a secure actor and am not worried about the length of my role as long as I can give an interesting performance.

 Any future plans?

 I have this secret ambition of wanting to direct. I would love to make intelligent, thought-provoking films that touch audience, like Life Is Beautiful.

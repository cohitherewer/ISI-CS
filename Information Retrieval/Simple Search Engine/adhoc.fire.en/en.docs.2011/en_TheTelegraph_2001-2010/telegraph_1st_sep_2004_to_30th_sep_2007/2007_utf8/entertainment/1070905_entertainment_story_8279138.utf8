 Keep it flexible

 Companies around the world are adopting fluid schedules to suit employee needs. What model will work in India, wonders RITA BHIMANI

 Flexible work-weeks can result in more 

beach-side holidays, though carrying work always remains a concern

Workers of the world unite! It is time to flex your flexi-time muscle. If you are a workaholic, then ignore this exhortation. But for all those who would like to exercise options about when to come in to work, and when to take time off, because of pressing matters at home, then it is time to start doing something about it. 

 In our corporate rat race, where even the computer mouse dominates our lives, we have to take a re-look at how we move our cheese. I still hark back to our early days in a major multinational, where it was nine-to-four thirty, with a half-hour break for lunch and a five-day week. There were those who worked far beyond those hours, came in on weekends and took work home. My journalist husband was always curious and apprehensive about why people could not finish their work within the time allotted. Being a deadline-oriented guy, he could not fathom why nine-to-five should have become nine-to-nine. He put it down to sheer ineptitude. 

 I do recall that there was a lot of time wasted in chit-chat, gossip, cricket comment (transistors tucked into top drawer) and coffee with business associates. Cerebral work was left for after-office hours, so that you could be seen to be either the hardworking assistant or the entrepreneurial boss to whom company mattered over quality family time. 

 Now, with the world-wide movement to go in for flexi hours, for working from home and for encouraging employees to downsize their own jobs, re-locate, and shuffle work patterns, we in India need to re-convene our priorities. There is a recent news item about IBM employees being given the option to choose their time-off periods as long as they can complete their work on schedule. Apparently these employees can take their vacations at short notice; club weekends with a weekday and generally, with concurrence from superiors, make informal arrangements for time off, just as long as work does not suffer. 

 Many of the employees actually write in their holiday plans on electronic calendars which colleagues can view online. Uh oh! Does that mean they can be accessed at will? That surely is the downside. People frantically checking mail at their favourite seaside resort, and then being accountable to get back at a moments notice. 

 It is happening all around us. So, I do not know what will really work for us in India. 

 I know of people who proudly proclaim that they have not taken leave in five, ah, sometimes seven to 10 years. Great for the corporates they serve, but perhaps not so wonderful for their families. Or for themselves. A person needs repair and maintenance for his body, mind, emotional well-being. For the good of his own persona, and surely for the greater good of the corporation he works for. 

 Negotiating work hours, telecommuting, all of these could contribute to a better work-life balance. 

 No special favours for women are being asked for. Apart from two things. One the possibility of having special creches in office proximity. Second the formalising of paternity leave, so that the male of the species can help out the multi-tasking spouse.

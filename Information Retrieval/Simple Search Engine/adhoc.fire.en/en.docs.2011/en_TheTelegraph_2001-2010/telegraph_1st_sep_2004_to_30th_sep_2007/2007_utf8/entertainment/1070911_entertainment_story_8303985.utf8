On Friday, City Centres Hushh and Kobe Sizzlers saw ad guru Prahlad Kakar whipping up an exotic array of dishes and stirring up some cocktails, with the help of two able assistants Vidya Malvade (of Chak De! India fame) and Urvashi Sharma (of Naqaab fame) . t2 caught up with him for a very politically incorrect rapid fire Q amp;A

 A brief history of Prahlad Kakar the chef:

 Well, I started cooking because of the way I looked and to get all the pretty girls. I figured either I would have to talk my face away or do something so well that they would forget about the way I looked. I learnt the basics from my mother and then from my girlfriends mothers! It was a complicated process where I would use my girlfriends to get to their mothers who would teach me how to cook and then I would whip up all these wonderful dishes to impress the girlfriends. And after that it was all about innovating and adding to the basics.

 His restaurants Papa Pancho and Sarson da Saga:

 Papa Pancho originated from a Punjabi abuse but as abuses are passe in Punjabi now and have turned into terms of endearment, Papa Pancho was the perfect choice. As for Sarson da Saga, it emerged as a result of a love affair between Sarson Singh and Saga Kaur and is a celebration of all things Punjabi.

 His best culinary creation:

 That has to be Daab Chingri Thai style. It has bits of bacon, lemongrass oil and a smoke infusion.

 His different hats adman, restaurateur, producer, scuba diver and chef:

 Ill give you the perfect analogy. It is like dumping your existing dull boyfriend to be a free bird in charge of your own life. It was just that way that I dumped being a banker to become a filmmaker. Its like not belonging to one man or woman but to have them all belong to me. As long as Im having a good time and dont have to do any work I love the stuff that Im doing! The moment it becomes about making money, having to do a regular job, thats when I dump it for something better.

 His different (literal, this time) hats:

 I started wearing hats for the most practical reasons in the Bombay summer while working long hours. But then I graduated from the floppy hat to fedoras, which I love. And now I wear these gorgeous Australian hats called Akubras. Its now become a signature style for me and I rarely am without my hat unless its a disguise like the phantom who doesnt wear his mask when he moves among the people!

 The cigar story:

 Well, I always loved smoking cigars. When I became more discerning, it was the Cuban variety that I liked, but they were far too expensive, so I decided to make my own by blending the Ecuadorian and Cameroon varieties and getting them rolled in the Philippines. And I called it Shergar after the famous Epsom Derby racehorse that was kidnapped by the IRA.

 Being the madman of the ad world:

 My ads lived out my personal fantasies with their humour and throwaway lines and irreverence. As far as Pepsi was concerned, I was their perfect consumer and fit their profile, which was anti-establishment, scruffy, witty and in the 18-24 bracket (broad grin).

 His favourite ad:

 The Pepsi ad with Aamir and Aishwarya and the one with Shah Rukh Khan in the changing room.

 His worst ad:

 There is a whole process whereby I survive the bad ads I stop watching them, then I pretend I didnt make them at all and then in due course of time, I forget I made the ad in the first place.

 Plans for the future and the young vs the old in the ad world:

 Well the young are always full of bright ideas but they get a little daunted working with me so I have to put in extra effort to appease them. As far as plans for the future are concerned, I intend to keep having fun, make movies, start a soft porn production company maybe, cook and keep having fun!

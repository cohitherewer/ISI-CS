The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Arm candy no more!

 After Saif and she split wide open, Rosa did not go running back to her part of the world. Instead, the lady forever in love with pizza is busy finding a foothold in Indian showbiz, food and fashion. Once here, she does not want to leave just like that. I want to incorporate Italian flavours in Indian style, fashion and food, she stresses.

 Now making appearances for the Pizza Hut World Food Fest at Delhi and Bangalore, Rosa is keen to move on with Life After Saif. Queries about her hero-turned-villain are met with a stony silence. But when questioned about the way ahead, the brunette answers in accented Hindi: Zindagi sundar hai.

 Back in Italy, it was all about digging into pizza every Saturday night with friends and family for 20 years. And Rosa is happy that pizza has spread all around the globe, and is going the fusion way. It is a different experience and fun to enjoy various flavours, says the lady who ranks tuna pizza as one of her favourites.

 Rosa, who has a knack for cooking, has taken to Indian food quite well. I love kaali dal and naan, aloo paratha and masala dosa, laughs she. But being a foodie does not make watching her waistline too tough. The idea is to enjoy your food, and burn the calories as well. This outdoor person has a workout regimen including yoga, boxing, cycling and swimming.

 Calcutta is close to her heart. One of my close friends is from the city, says Rosa, recalling her bare-dare Tantra night in a pale pink sari, few years back as fun.

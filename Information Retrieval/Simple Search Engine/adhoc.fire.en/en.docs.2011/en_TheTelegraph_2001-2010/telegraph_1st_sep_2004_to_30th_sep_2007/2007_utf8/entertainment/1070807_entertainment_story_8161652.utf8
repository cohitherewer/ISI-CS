The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Burning the bartop

 What: Royal Mist Demigods 2007 showcasing Vikram Phadniss mens collection.

 Where: Tantra, at The Park. 

 When: Saturday night. 

 Style story: Tantra bartop hosted eye candy of a different kind last weekend. There were no camera phones. There was no four-hour-long wait. This one was full-on fashion. Twenty-four outfits. Six hot men. Twenty minutes. Vikram Phadniss first show in Calcutta rocked the ramp, and how. 

 Saturday night saw four crisp collections but punctuated with an odd song (men take longer than women to change?) here and there. The show began with a linen line, straight-line cream jackets worn with dark denims, formed a sober background for some funky, larger-than-life motifs on the back and arms. Fuchsia, red, green, blue the motifs were striking, off-setting the colour-coordinated cravats and mufflers. The styling was young and hip. The accessories changed with each sequence and spiky hair with a hint of wild colours was the mainstay of the night. 

 The second sequence also focussed on jackets, worn with lighter blue jeans. This time it was tweed and the jackets were longer, almost like trench coats. Military green, camouflage hints, sober stripes, checks The style story was interesting. Sling bags, geometric ties and cool caps also appeared on the ramp. 

 The third sequence showed men in black and some waxed chests too (for the record: Vikram Phadnis happens to be Salman Khans designer)! Mostly overcoats, some hooded, the jackets were teamed with black leather pants. A couple of bandhgalas were also a part of the collection. Occasionally, a dash of silver embroidery on the cuff and back was seen. The third line was accessorised with chunky-buckled belts and of course, six-pack muscles! We liked the satin lining in metallic hues that added to the luxury factor.

 The fourth and final collection saw the first hint of Bollywood fashion for the night. Fun and filmi, the line was a rainbow on the ramp. Green Aligarhi pyjamas, red lungis, emerald jackets, multicoloured checked jackets, wrap-trousers and harem pants, the styles and silhouettes seemed tailor-made for no less than Govinda!

 Ramp rocker

 Gwen Stefani walks the ramp 

with son Kingston

The pop diva, Gwen Stefani, is on a mission to prove she is no one-hit-wonder as a fashion queen. The 38-year-old singer opened New York Fashion Week with a funky, streetwise collection that paid tribute to Op-Art, naughty school uniforms and Londons Vivienne Westwood. 

 The clothes were an offbeat fashion statement which emphasised clothes should be a collection of sassy, but wearable separates put together with a witty and whimsical edge. 

 Preppy blazers were paired with skinny jeans and braces. Tartan micro-skirts came with clinging, sweater girl tops. Retro-style pencil skirts featured a cascade of ruffles down the left-hand side. 

 Tailoring was interpreted in a range of Just William shorts suits and St Trinians-style gymslips in black and white checks, accessorised with round-toe-platform stilettos and knee socks.

 Mini-dresses, in wet look sequins, leopard-prints and 60s-look target patterns and chequerboard-prints, were worn with matching headscarves, knotted under the chin, just like the Queen, and steel-heeled ankle-boots. 

 Stefani, originally the lead singer of the band, No Doubt, who launched her fashion range in 2005, is known as the Carrie Bradshaw of rock roll.

 Her fashion collection is called L.A.M.B., an acronym that stands for Love, Angel, Music, Baby the title of her first solo album. Her pop videos, influenced by Japanese street culture in the style-mad districts of Harajuku and Shibuya, are as much a fashion as a music presentation and her fashion collections, likewise, complete the fusion. 

 Stefani, who is married to the British rock musician, Gavin Rossdale, of Bush, took her bow as a model mum, with the couples first child, 18-month-old son Kingston, wearing a pair of miniaturised head-phones.

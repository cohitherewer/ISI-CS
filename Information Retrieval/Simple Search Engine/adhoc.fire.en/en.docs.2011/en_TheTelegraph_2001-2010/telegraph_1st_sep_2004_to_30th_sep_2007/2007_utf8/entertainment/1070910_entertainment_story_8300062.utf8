 Zodiac sign: Sagittarius

 The quality that defines me: Im always bubbly and full of energy

 My pet name: Son

 My first crush: When I was about four, I was obsessed with this guy for only one reason my naani told me that if you marry, your dad will come down by a ladder. So I wanted to marry this guy in Kenya. The crush lasted till I was 11

 The best compliment I have ever received: A lot of people have told me that I have a nice smile

 What turns me on in a man: I love romantic guys. I like guys who give me a lot of attention

 What turns me off in a man: I hate guys who are full of themselves

 The sweetest thing that someone has done for me: When I was in Kenya , someone sent me a big soft toy of a caterpillar. It was about two metres long and had I love you written on it. It came with 48 roses and till date I dont know who sent it

 The craziest thing that I have ever done: While in school, I broke the fire alarm because somebody had challenged me to do so. The older students were giving their exams and everybody rushed out thinking there was a real fire. I was nearly expelled

 When Im low: I write poems

 Im obsessive about: Cleanliness, my looks, fashion. I love to take care of myself. I am very high maintenance (smiles)

 After a hard days work I unwind by: Taking a nice warm bath. I light some scented candles, put on some Buddha Bar music and just sit there and read books and enjoy the music

 I have a soft corner for: Anything romantic. Lots of roses, lots of teddy bears, lots of flowers, candles, chocolates

 One thing I would like to change about myself: My inability to be on time. I get up in the morning and I know I have a million things to do but I will still delay. Im too lazy

 One thing I want someone to do for me: I want a guy to take me on a private yacht with a big candlelight dinner and then maybe go to Alibaug and have a great dinner on the beach

 If I were to stumble upon a time machine, I would transport myself to the era of: I want to be in two eras. One would be the Victorian times everyone was so elegant then. I would also like to transport myself to the retro era when the punk-hippie kind of fashion existed

 I love gorging on: Ice cream and chocolate. I can live on them

 One fictional character I identify with: There is this book called The Gossip Girls in which there is a character called Blaire her life is similar to mine

 If I were to interview someone: It would be Hilary Swank. Im so jealous of Bipasha because she met her

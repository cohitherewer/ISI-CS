 Flamenco fervour

 The Spanish dance of passion is Rosanna Maya rsquo;s calling

 Calcutta may currently be obsessed with salsa, but there is much more to Western dance than the Latin favourite. And the city got a rare taste of one such form, with Rosanna Maya performing the classic flamenco at a concert at Kala Mandir recently. 

 There are two most popular explanations to flamenco, explains Rosanna, a Maltese citizen whos adopted the Spanish dance as her own. One is that the word is derived from flame, the other that it has been derived from the phrase felah manju or fugitive peasant.

 Rosanna believes that as many Spaniards were gypsies or nomads travelling through many lands and being ruled by many races, flamenco shows the influence of many cultures. The music bears resemblance to the music of the Moors for they ruled the country for a very long time. It has a strong Oriental influence. There are similarities with Indian dance forms too, especially with Kathak. The music, steeped in taal and ragas, has a similar rhythm, she adds. But in flamenco, the gestures and movements have lost their narrative meaning and express passion, points out the dancer, who also teaches.

 Different parts of the body and their movements symbolise different things in this dance form, that has been growing in popularity globally. The lower part of the body stands for fire, passion, whereas the upper part of the body stands for everything mystical, says Rosanna. And while flamenco is often thought of as an energetic dance, there is a lot of sadness in it too the sadness of a homeless people.

 Folklore is very important to the dance, says the dancer. And so is passion, which is why Rosanna insists that one doesnt really need to understand the words of the song to comprehend its meaning. You dont have to understand the music to be able to respond to the dance, because it is such a pure expression of passion, she stresses.

 And it was this passion, grace and confidence in Rosannas performance that charmed the Calcutta audience. The performance included both soft, graceful and feminine movements with a swirl of skirts and the rhythm of the castanets, and bold masculine moves reminiscent of the movements of a bull-fighter in the ring.

 Originally the flamenco was a solo form, but it can be performed by couples as well. There is a lot of interest in fusion art in Spain at the moment. A lot of blending of various music from all parts of the world is happening and a lot of work is being done in flamenco too. It is an evolving form, concludes Rosanna.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Anti-climax!

 This is probably a first on Indian television. Comedy Circus has ended with a whimper and not a bang. Television actor Ali Asgar and partner Kashif Khan have emerged champions on the stand-up comedy show, a news that has leaked out long before the telecast of the final episode (tonight, 9.30pm on Sony).

 ldquo;The fact that someone has already leaked the news that we have won the crown does take away the sheen from the win to some extent, rdquo; laments Ali Asgar, one half of the winning duo. ldquo;We have put so much effort into the show and to be faced with the prospect that the audience might choose not to watch the finals because they already know who the winner is, is a trifle disheartening. I just hope that such a thing does not happen in future. rdquo;

 That apart, Ali is extremely pleased with the win. ldquo;My partner and I were the underdogs right from the beginning. We were neither the production house rsquo;s favourite, nor the channel rsquo;s chosen ones. Moreover, Kashif is from Karachi and he had a lot of visa problems during the course of the show because of which we hardly got any time to practise. However, we stuck in there and emerged champions, rdquo; beams Ali.

 In the finals, Ali and Kashif faced stiff competition from Swapnil Joshi and his partner VIP. ldquo;We just played it cool and did whatever came naturally to us. I am glad that everyone liked the acts we put up, rdquo; says Ali.

 For now, the chhota devar of Kahaani Ghar Ghar Kii has taken time off for a vacation. ldquo;I will look at signing projects only when I get back. My hands are itching to do a negative role, rdquo; he signs off.

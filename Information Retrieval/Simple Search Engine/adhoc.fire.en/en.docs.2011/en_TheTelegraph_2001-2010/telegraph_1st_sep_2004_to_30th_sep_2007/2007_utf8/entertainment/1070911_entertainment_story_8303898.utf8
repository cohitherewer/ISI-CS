 Femme fatale

Juliette Binoche has spent her career turning down action roles. She told Steven Spielberg no to Jurassic Park and refused a part opposite Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible. I have said no to Hollywood roles where Ive been asked to play a secret agent always small roles where they are seductive stereotypes, she says. Now finally, at the age of 43, she is playing the part she has always wanted: a female James Bond. This one was unusual for me. I am always trying to find something that is challenging and enlightening.

 In A Few Days in September she plays Irene, a tough-cookie French agent protecting an American colleague (Nick Nolte) from a CIA assassin (John Turturro). This, however, is the French arthouse version of an action movie. It is a fast-paced, violent, edge-of-your-seat thriller but it also has lots of long silences and characters with bizarre quirks (Irene has a pet tortoise and Turturros character phones his psychoanalyst between shoot-outs). It is the directorial debut of the Argentine-born screenwriter Santiago Amigorena, who also happens to be Binoches partner. Reviews have compared it to Pulp Fiction and praised Binoches performance as bad-ass but charmingly funny.

 It is an interesting move for the Paris-based actress, who could choose any role she wanted. Best known for her 1996 Oscar-winning performance as the grief-stricken nurse in Anthony Minghellas The English Patient, she was nominated for a second Academy Award for the commercially successful Chocolat, in which she starred alongside Johnny Depp, in 2000. Since then, Binoche has consciously taken more sober, intellectual roles: the frumpy, restrained wife in the word-of-mouth surprise hit of last year, Hidden, and a Bosnian war widow in her second Minghella film, Breaking and Entering.

 Binoche describes A Few Days in September as a dramatised version of the events depicted in Michael Moores documentary Fahrenheit 9/11. While preparing for the role she had long conversations with a secret agent, who consulted on the film and on whom she modelled her character. Of course he could not reveal everything to me, but he said a lot, she says.

 So is she saying the film is a dramatisation of real events? Absolutely, she says. I went to see the Iranian ambassador at the time and he said of course its true. Things that I thought were hidden and private they were very open about it. So she means the CIA and other agencies knew 9/11 was going to happen? Of course. So is she saying it was an inside job? Everybody is responsible for it. If you only knew more, its even more depressing. Humour is the only way we can deal with it.

 Binoches stubborn insistence that everything presented in this (wholly fictional) film is true is in many ways unsurprising. In the past as an interviewee she has had a reputation as difficult, tense and moody. In her twenties she gave up talking to journalists for several years, describing the press as a form of pollution. Ten years after The English Patient, she does seem to have mellowed considerably conspiracy theories notwithstanding.

 She comes across as sweet but dangerously unpredictable, wearing her emotions very close to the surface. Minghella once said of her: She has no skin, so tears and laughter are never far away. Any past misunderstandings almost certainly stem from her strange, transatlantic therapy-speak. Binoche is a peculiarly attractive combination of arrogance and insecurity. When she won a Bafta award for The English Patient she wept in her acceptance speech: But I thought you didnt like me. 

 The French use the word artiste to describe their screen actors and Binoche takes it seriously as a vocation. The law of acting for any actor is ups and downs. Sometimes you have wonderful roles, sometimes you have nothing. You have to accept its like that. Its not fonctionnaire (civil servant) work. But its true you have to say no to those roles youre not going to be nourished by. You have somehow to be a little fulfilled in it so that you can bring something out of yourself that is challenging, enlightening, creative. Otherwise you should do something else.

 Binoche spends a lot of time with her two children. Last year she decided not to work for 11 months to be with them, turning down an opportunity to film a Marguerite Duras adaptation in Cambodia. Of motherhood she has said: Giving birth is like a vase of beautiful flowers. Only youre just the vase and only for a very short moment. The flowers are beautiful but they belong to themselves, not to the vase.

 Does she try to lead a normal family life? Normal? I never thought of it, she says. What means normal? Normal is very dangerous for the soul. It can be long and difficult sometimes to be far away. Lately I took my children with me all the time. They have lived in London, New York, San Francisco, South Africa. I let my son choose now whether he wants to come or not because I think he is old enough to decide. And he needs more of his father somehow than his mother because of his age.

 She remains unmarried. It may happen. We will see. Would I like to get married? Well, my life is not finished. She bares her teeth like a vampire and rasps: Im not dead yet. 

 She is right. Normal is indeed dangerous for the soul.

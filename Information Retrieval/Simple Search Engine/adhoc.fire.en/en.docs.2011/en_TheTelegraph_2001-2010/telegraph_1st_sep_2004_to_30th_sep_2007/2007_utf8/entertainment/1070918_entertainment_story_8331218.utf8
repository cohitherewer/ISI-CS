 The dancing girl

 Konkona sheds her inhibitions and matches steps with Rani and Madhuri in two Bollywood biggies. 

She plays younger sister to Rani Mukerji in Laaga Chunari Mein Daag; she matches steps with Madhuri Dixit in Aaja Nachle. With two multi-starrers from the Yash Raj stable in the bag, Konkona Sensharma has entered the Bollywood big league. She chatted with t2 on the sidelines of a party to celebrate the national award won by 15 Park Avenue...

 What is your role in Laaga Chunari Mein Daag? I play Rani Mukerjis younger sister Chhutki. She is very vivacious and spirited; she is full of life. But due to a conflict in the family, she moves out of her hometown, Benaras, and goes to live in Mumbai. The story then takes a turn and tracks the transition of a small-town girl in a metro. It focuses on her trials and tribulations in the city.

 You look very different in the film... Yes, different only because I am dancing in the film, which I havent done before. Actually, I really liked the script. All the characters in the film are properly etched out. I was very nervous while dancing. But a couple of rehearsals made things easy. Also, we were shooting in portions, so it wasnt much of a problem.

 How was it working with the team? It was wonderful. Dada (Pradeep Sarkar) is one of my favourite directors. I liked his Parineeta.... In Benaras, we had loads of fun. We realised that most of us were Bengalis (Sarkar, Jaya Bachchan, Rani and Konkona). Even the crew spoke in Bengali! We would crack jokes in Bengali. Dada used to speak and guide us in Bengali. We gorged on Bengali food. Only Kunal (Kapoor) had no clue what we were talking about.... Rani is great to work with. She is very professional and a wonderful actress. 

 And your role in Aaja Nachle? Its too early to talk about my role in the film. But yes, I had to dance in this film too and dance with Madhuri! Initially I was nervous, not only because it was with Madhuri but also because I am always nervous while dancing. But I was ready after a few rehearsals. Madhuri is very natural; she is extremely nice, talented, warm and a lovely individual.

 Will you now focus on big films? I dont know. I dont plan anything. I will do it if I get an interesting script. For me the script is the most important factor. My character has to be properly etched out and it should be realistic.

 Your other films... Theres Rituparno Ghoshs Sunglass, and the horror film Amavas which was completed two years ago. I have no clue when it will release. We begin shooting for my mothers Goynar Baksho early next year.

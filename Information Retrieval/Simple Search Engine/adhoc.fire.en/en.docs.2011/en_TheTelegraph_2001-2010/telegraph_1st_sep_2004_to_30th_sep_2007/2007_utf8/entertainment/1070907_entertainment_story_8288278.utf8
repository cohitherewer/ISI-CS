 All blues

 Beatroot Blues performing at Someplace Else. Picture by Rashbehari Das

 The gravelly voice of the vocalist with his harmonica and mellow blues riffs set the mood for the night at Someplace Else on September 1. The band performing was Beatroot Blues from Mumbai; the music its own, non-pretentious style of blues.

 The band got the Saturday night crowd going with Hank Williams Honky Tonk Blues, Van Morrisons Moondance and the blues-inflected traditional Midnight Special. 

 The members Rahul Chatterji on guitar, Pratish (Pratz) Motwane on harmonica and lead vocals, Clary Dvisser on bass and backing vocals and Claude Abranches on drums have been playing the blues for a while. Chatterji and Motwane were gigging in clubs in the US and England and decided to come back to India to test the waters. The response, so far, has been encouraging. Beatroot Blues even has its own groupies, including Congress MP Milind Deora a blues guitarist himself who actually went on stage to jam with the band recently!

 Beatroot Blues derives its sound from the 40s electric blues gurus the three Kings (B.B., Albert and Freddie), Muddy Waters and Buddy Guy (whom Motwane jammed with during his concert in Mumbai in 2005) moving on to the electric blues stars of the 60s and 70s, like Stevie Ray Vaughn, Rolling Stones and Jimi Hendrix.

 We take the style of the old folk blues, give it our own interpretation and then add some Indian masala to it, says Chatterji. An album in the pipeline for the end of this year is to have a combination of original compositions with a few covers rendered in their individual style, with Indian percussion. I guess our name sums up what we are trying to do, which is basically move off the beaten track, keep the electric blues alive and also come up with a clever pun on the vegetable! concludes Chatterji with a smile.

 Shaun Kenworthy traces the lineage of veggies that have now become daily staples in India and learns that the tongue knows no nation

 The kebab, the roti, the Kali Dal, the Butter Chicken or the Mutton Rogan Josh, for instance mdash; these traditionally known Indian classics never actually originated in India. On the other hand, Chinese favourites like Manchurian and Chilli Chicken are, without a doubt, completely home-reared Indian dishes. Even the classic Conti dish of vegetable cutlets, I rsquo;m sure, would have first been made here and more than likely travelled to Europe during the late 60s via the hippie movement. Interestingly enough, vegetables like the potato, tomato, bell pepper, chilli, cauliflower mdash; now daily staples mdash; arrived in India only around 300-400 years ago.

 I would think you would have to look to the south to find some lsquo;authentic rsquo; Indian foods that have probably changed only slightly over the centuries. Most of the vegetables used in simple dishes in the south are of the land and I rsquo;m sure little has really changed. The sambar is a great example; based on lentils, mixed spices, drumsticks, tamarind, shallots, curry leaves. The chutneys are usually made with only local ingredients.

 Let rsquo;s start with the humble potato. It started to be cultivated in India around 1700, maybe a little earlier or later, like most internationally used vegetables. It originated in the Americas and wasn rsquo;t properly cultivated till the mid 1600s. Another favourite from around the same time is the cauliflower and the cabbage. Found in Europe and documented as far back as the Romans, these are two more staples that weren rsquo;t fully cultivated till the 1700s. Carrots are slightly more difficult. They again came from Europe and have been written about for a couple of thousand years but we probably owe cultivation to the Flemish, again somewhere around the same period. Spinach is thought to have come from West Asia, so it has probably been here for a couple of hundred years longer. 

 Two items that most of the world couldn rsquo;t imagine life without mdash; the ever-humble tomato and the whole capsicum and chilli family mdash; again arrived into Europe through the Spaniards. 

 I picked up these few items as they are some of the most commonly used vegetables in India, if not the world. A final interesting one for India is that the whole family of beans other than the soyabean originates from the Americas. Leeks from Eastern Europe, celery from the Romans. Lettuce leaves from the European hedgerows. Corn from the 

 Americas and the simple pea from England. 

 I suppose the stimulation behind this is something that will continue to harp on about all my life. Food, wherever you are in the world, is forever evolving and changing into different dishes. In some ways it would be very difficult to pinpoint the origin or original recipe of any dish. If a zucchini turns up at the market, why not throw it into the sambar? It rsquo;s still a vegetable at the end of the day. I made some delicious dal at home the other week and threw in some chopped bacon and sausage. Everyone was shocked at first mdash; ldquo;Dal with Bacon! rdquo; mdash; but it went down like a treat. 

 No rules. Just understand the basic fundamentals and enjoy mdash; it rsquo;s as simple as that. With that, here rsquo;s an interesting recipe that I rsquo;ve written many times in the past: Oriental Chicken Tikka. All those Chinese flavours with that distinct smoky tandoor taste. It rsquo;s fantastic straight out of the oven; try it with maybe some salad and maybe spring onion parathas with a drizzle of toasted sesame oil.

 ORIENTAL CHICKEN TIKKA

 You will need to prepare around 1 kg chicken cut up into tandoori chicken kind of pieces. I rsquo;m sure the guy at the market will do it for you.

 For the marination you will need 1 tbsp sesame oil, 1 tbsp sesame seeds, 1 tbsp ginger paste, 1 tbsp garlic paste, frac12; tsp five spice powder, 1 tbsp light soy sauce, 2 tbsp finely chopped spring onion and finally, 2 tbsp honey. 

 Mix all the ingredients together and throw in the chicken. Make sure the chicken is thoroughly coated and place in the refrigerator for at least two hours.

 Lastly, either cook it in the tandoor or roast it in an oven, or if you like, you can pan-fry the pieces with a little oil for around 3 minutes on each side.

 Curiosity is the key

 MUST-HAVE MOVIES / Rear Window

 Rear Window is what Peter Bogdanovich calls Hitchcocks testament film a French term for a work that perfectly encapsulates an authors style, preoccupations and attitudes.

 Its a wonderfully sleek, sexy, witty American thriller, enriched by Alfred Hitchcocks mischievously English fascination with Crippenesque murder.

 The combination is unbeatable: James Stewart, Grace Kelly, sexy dialogue, a fabulous studio-confected Greenwich Village, danger, mystery, suspense plus real moral and philosophical depth.

 L.B. Jefferies (Stewart), a photojournalist, is confined to a wheelchair by a plaster cast, so we see only what he sees across the noisy courtyard of his apartment complex. He has a restricted view of marriage, too for this bachelor, the society beauty Lisa Fremont (Kelly) is just too perfect. Bored, hes started goggling his assorted neighbours as others might watch television, becoming a bit of a Peeping Tom with dubious rear-window ethics.

 What makes it such a masterpiece? John Michael Hayess dazzling script is among the best and tightest ever written. The impeccable performances, intelligent, nuanced, emotionally complex, show that Hitchcock didnt really believe actors were like cattle. The music by Franz Waxman gives a buzz of random urban reality to this intense goldfish-bowl world.

 But above all, Rear Window is so satisfying because its a film about looking, a multi-faceted allegory of cinema and the ambiguities of spectatorship. Jefferies in his wheelchair watches his neighbours framed in their windows like actors on a screen.

 Theres a lot of pretty private stuff out there, it is said; the dialogue voices disgust at voyeurism. But equally, the movie vindicates human curiosity as an instinct inseparable from neighbourliness. It also partially vindicates cinema itself especially Hitchcocks own.

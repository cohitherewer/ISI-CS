 answers your queries on the ancient science

 I wanted to rent an office space in a sleek glass building. But I was wondering whether it is approved by Vastu. Please advise.

 Tarun Pandit

 Glass walls are acceptable, but you should protect yourself from direct sunlight by hanging curtains. You have to ensure that the south-west zone of the office is heavy with wooden furniture. You should sit with your back to an internal brick wall or filing cabinet. Avoid glass walls behind you. You should sit facing east, north, north-east or south-east.

 My daughter is getting married soon. I want to buy her a flat. What are the features I should be looking for?

 Dinesh Gupta

 First buy a simple magnetic compass and use it to determine the directions in a house.

 Try to buy a flat with entry from north or east side.

 The flat should be located on a higher floor.

 It should have at least north or east open.

 There should not be any toilet or kitchen in the north-east or south-west zones.

 The flat should not have cuts in the south-west and north-east 

 The furniture layout will depend on the position of the walls in relation to the north-south magnetic field.

 It is difficult to buy a flat with all the positive Vastu features. For example the main door should not be in front of the lift door. If it is unavoidable, you will have to go for Vastu rectification.

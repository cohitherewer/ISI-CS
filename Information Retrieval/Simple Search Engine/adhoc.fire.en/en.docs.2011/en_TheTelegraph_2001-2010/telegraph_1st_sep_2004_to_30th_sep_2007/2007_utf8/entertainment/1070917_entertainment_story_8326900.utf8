 The Night Watchman

 Keanu Reeves, seen here in Constantine, plays Tom Ludlow in The Night Watchman 

Director: David Ayer, the American screenwriter respected for his insight into the dual worlds of LA street life and submarines. Ayer wrote the screenplay for the crime drama Dark Blue, and it was his research into the LAPD that led to his most famous script, Training Day, which sold for a million dollars. Ayer signed a contract worth $2 million to write the script for S.W.A.T. based on his original story. The film was directed by Clark Johnson and released in 2003.

 Ayers directorial debut was with Harsh Times. It is a drama set on the streets of South Central Los Angeles and shows how the violence affects peoples attempts to lead normal lives. The Night Watchman is currently in post-production stage.

 Background: In 2004, it was announced that Spike Lee would be directing this film for a 2005 release. In 2005, it was again announced that Oliver Stone was in talks to direct the film. When Stone later denied this, Training Day writer David Ayer took charge. Filming has begun. The screenplay is written by authors James Ellroy, Jamie Moss and David Ayer.

 Stars: So far Hugh Laurie, Chris Evans, Terry Crews, Jay Mohr and Naomie Harris have been confirmed roles in the movie. Keanu Reeves plays Tom Ludlow. Forest Whitaker is also part of the star cast.

 Plot: Tom Ludlow (Reeves) is a veteran LAPD cop who finds life difficult to navigate after the death of his wife. His life becomes cheerless, dark and deadly after the death of his beloved.

 Ludlow is forced into a corner when he is framed for murder by those close to him. When evidence implicates him in the execution of a fellow officer, he is forced to go up against the cop culture hes been a part of his entire career, ultimately leading him to question the loyalties of everyone around him and find a new meaning of life.

 Deeper and more profound themes are interwoven in this story of a mans struggle for meaning in a world that is increasingly controlled by outside forces.

 Release target: Next year.

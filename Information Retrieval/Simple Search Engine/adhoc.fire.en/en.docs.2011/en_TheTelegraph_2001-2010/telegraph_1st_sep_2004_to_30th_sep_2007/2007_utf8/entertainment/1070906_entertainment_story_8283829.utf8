 Three young film talents from Calcutta put their best frames forward at the fifth edition of the Berlinale Talent Campus, which ran parallel to the Berlin International Film Festival this February. 

 Two of them Supriyo Sen, a docu-filmmaker, and Sukanta Majumder, a sound designer shared their workshop experiences with film students at Max Mueller Bhavan. Kanu Behl couldnt attend. Also present was director-cinematographer Debalina Majumder, who had attended Talent Campus 2005.

 It was a great opportunity to meet young producers, directors and technicians from all over the world, said Supriyo, who won his entry with a short excerpt from his documentary Way Back Home. Sukanta, an SRFTI graduate, played an audio recording, Railway Level Crossing, a compilation of natural sounds taped from the roads, fields and railway tracks in Rajasthan and Gujarat. Debalina too shared her moments of discovering Berlin. 

 All three Supriyo, Sukanta and Debalina are now part of the online Talent database.

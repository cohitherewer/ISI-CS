The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Shop, eat and party all night

 A view of Underwater World. Pictures by the author 

When you land in a city whose airport is a shopping complex, you know youve reached Asias shopping paradise. Theres no way you can find your way back home before emptying your pockets here. But theres more to Singapore than shopping till dawn.

 How to get there: Singapore Airlines has direct flights from Calcutta to Singapores Changi Airport. Jet, Indian and Thai Airways have changeover flights.

 Stay at: There is no end to the numerous hotels at every shopping hub. Singapore is well-prepared for tourists.

 Shop-stop: People save all year to splurge during the Great Singapore Sale (GSS), May through July. But you can shop just about anywhere, anytime at the malls down the central Orchard Road, or Takashimaya, or Plaza Singapura malls. A stopover at Sim Lim Square is a must for gizmo-geeks. At Bugis Village and Little India, get unbranded clothes and accessories for cheap. Those with brand loyalty can shop at Orchard Road. Adventure thrills: A visit to Singapore is incomplete without a trip to Sentosa, Singapores island resort. It is a one-stop hub to explore multi-entertainment. Start with a trip to Images of Singapore (a historical and cultural museum) and walk a few steps up to the Merlion Tower. A little away is Underwater World, with colourful corals and a tunnel that leads to exotic ocean-dwellers like the sea-dragon and the blue-ringed octopus. 

 Sip n bite: Being a melting pot of cultures, theres Malay, Indian and Chinese food to choose from. Seafood is a must but you can also dig into Prata (a paper-thin multi-layered pancake), Fish head curry, Rojak (fruit-and-vegetable salad garnished with crushed peanuts), Laksa (creamy curry with thick noodles) or Satay (grilled meat on a stick).

 Party at: Lounge lizards can unwind at ZoukOut, the all night annual beach rave. Live bands are all around. 

 t2 tip: Buy a sim-card for $36 to keep in touch while on the move. A cheaper option is international calling cards vailable at 7/Eleven stores for $10, usable at phone booths across town.

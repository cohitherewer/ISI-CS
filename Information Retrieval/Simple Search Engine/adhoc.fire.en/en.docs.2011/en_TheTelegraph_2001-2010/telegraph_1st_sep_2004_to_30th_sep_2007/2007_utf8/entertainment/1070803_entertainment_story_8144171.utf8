The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Bold amp; beautiful

 Moon moon Sen 

 Two long kisses, the bare butt of a youth, a middle-aged man in blue undies, a lot of cleavage and a flood of four-letter words. Enough ammunition to set the moral police on fire, but for once the Censor Board of Film Certification has passed Anjan Dutts Bow Barracks Forever with an A certificate but without a single cut.

 The film wouldnt have been the same had there been even one cut. All this is very important to the story, even the expletives. Thats how the people in Bow Barracks speak; its a very matter-of-fact way, explains the film-maker.

 The conservative Bengali girl (Raima Sen) in The Bong Connection doesnt let herself be kissed by a friend she is drawn to (Shayan Munshi), neither does the Bengali youth (Parambrata) go all the way with an attractive stranger (Peeya) in America.

 But Bow Barracks Forever is no holds barred. Perhaps this little cosmopolitan community with its different worldview prompted Dutt to go beyond the conventional. The crumbling Bow Barracks building sparks greed, selfishness, frustration and anger among its inhabitants, as it does care, concern, love and hope. Sex adds vital shades to the rich tapestry.

 Its most normal in the most abnormal of circumstances. Rosa (Moon Moon Sen) throws herself at her husband when he is about to leave for work. She says the shabbiness and uncertainty of Bow Barracks is driving her mad. Earlier, a round of euphoric groans and moans in bed with her lover (George Baker) ends with a restless Rosa cribbing about growing old and being stuck in the Barracks.

 Clayton and Neha

 Love-making in Bow Barracks is unlike anything seen before in Tollywood films, where its either about forbidden pleasure or exploitation. Its a moment of tenderness when Bradley (Clayton Rodgers) hugs, kisses and comforts Anne (Neha Dubey), after she has been thrashed by her husband (Sabyasachi Chakraborty). As pain fuels passion, the trembling Anne turns into a temptress, kissing Claytons bare body, all the way down from his chest.

 Physical love knows no moral code of conduct in Bow Barracks, because its true to character, even true to life. For Bradley and Anne its sacrosanct, for Rosa its about living by her own rules in the world she is trapped in. In an arena of pain and pathos, passion keeps them alive.

 Moon Moon is refreshingly real as the wild and wanton Rosa, because of how comfortable she is with her body. There is not a trace of self-consciousness as she flaunts her cleavage.

 In Bow Barracks, I was working with people I was familiar and comfortable with. And I wasnt going to worry about what people would say. George is an old friend but he was shy and I had to make him feel comfortable. The whole thing was hilarious! We just giggled, from Anjan to the spot boy. I was terrified of dubbing though, but Sohag (Sen) calmed me down and I went ahead, says Moon Moon.

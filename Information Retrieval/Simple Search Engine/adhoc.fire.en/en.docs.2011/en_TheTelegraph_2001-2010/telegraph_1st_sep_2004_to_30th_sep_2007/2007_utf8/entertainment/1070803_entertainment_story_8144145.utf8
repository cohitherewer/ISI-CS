 Hot hot hot

 Salman Khans one lucky man. After romancing Miss World Aishwarya Rai, he got hooked to another beauty Katrina Kaif. And now his co-stars too are turning out to be one showstopper after another.

 Ali Larter, Salmans leading lady in his first American film Marigold, has just been chosen sixth in the list of 100 hottest women in the world for 2007 by the international mens magazine Maxim. The topper is always-in-the-news singer-actress Lindsay Lohan, while Ali Larter has scored over the likes of Angelina Jolie (12th), Eva Longoria (9th) and Beyonce Knowles (13th).

 Ali Larter, who had earlier starred in Final Destination, has hit a popularity high with her television series Heroes which was telecast in India on STAR World and is starring in a Hollywood biggie Resident Evil: Extinction the third Resident Evil film with Milla Jovovich, set to release later in December. 

 While in a film like Marigold we wouldnt get to see all of Ali that helped her make it to the Top 10 hotties list but Salman sure got an eyeful. He sure is a Lucky guy.

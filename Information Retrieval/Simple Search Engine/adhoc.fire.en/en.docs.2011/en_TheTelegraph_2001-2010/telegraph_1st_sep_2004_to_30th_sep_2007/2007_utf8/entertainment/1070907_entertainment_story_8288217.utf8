 Urmila Matondkar talks about Mehbooba 

 What did you think of your Mehbooba mehbooba number?

 I dont like anything I do. No matter how well I have performed, I feel that I could have done better. But I think I came pretty close to liking this song when I saw it on screen. I think it has a lot to do with the other people present in the song as well (smiles). Everything from the make-up, hair, dress, to the dancing, and the attitude is very cool; and the choreography is of international standard. The steps may seem very simple; but they arent.

 Were you nervous about the Helen factor?

 I was super excited and super nervous. I was praying that I dont muck up. I have danced to this song a billion times within the four walls of my house. Helenji is a fabulous dancer. She gave cabarets a whole new meaning. The challenge was being out there and still putting up a very dignified and classy act.

 Is Mehbooba a sign of a truce between Ram Gopal Varma and you?

 There was no war to begin with, so wheres the question of a truce? We have done some fabulous work together in the past. I dont see why one should do movies together for the heck of it. Whenever something interesting comes up, he will approach me; and if it excites me, Ill act in the film. There is nothing more to it.

 Mallika Sherawat has also done the Mehbooba number recently. What did you think of it?

 I have just seen the promos. In all fairness, I think I can say that they have replicated the original, from the outfit to the set.

 You have done quite a few item songs. Which is your favourite one?

 I have done a variety of dance numbers like Kambakth ishq, Chhamma chhamma, Zahreela pyaar and Geela geela pani. Its difficult to pick just one.

 Will Mehbooba bring Urmila the sex symbol back in the spotlight?

 I never believed in tags. Dancing is something that I love and it comes very naturally to me. People are either sexy and charismatic or they are not. I brought glamour to roles in Pinjar and Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Maara.

 Of late you are doing intense roles... 

 It is extremely exhausting and emotionally draining. When my mom saw Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Maara, she begged me to not to do such roles again. You cannot fake in front of the camera, its your best friend and its your worst enemy. Even if you are a little unsure it shows on the 70mm screen.... I remember Waheeda Rehman once asked me, Urmila, its so amazing to see you work. I have never seen you talking on the phone. Dont you have a mobile phone? I replied: Of course I have a phone. But I dont feel the need to call or message people when working.

 What kind of roles excite you? 

 Right now Im just dying to do a comedy. Comedies are the most difficult and enjoyable genre. And I am also looking forward to another foot-tapping number.

 Any plans to settle down? 

 One should not plan marriage, it will happen when it has to. Moreover, I feel this city is full of married men!

 Couture jeweller Raj Mahtani is suffering from severe stress. His actress-friend in Mumbai (the pretty woman with deep dimples) is bugged with him because he is too busy to touch base with her. Sigh. The whos who of the country has pressing trousseau needs, and all want his undivided attention. Sigh. International magazines are angling for his interviews. Sigh. And in exactly a months time, Raj will be in Paris with Anamika Khanna for Fashion Week. Gasp! 

 Over to the man

 On Anamika hellip;

 The way she creates textile and design, she puts things in a different perspective. The research and development that goes into her work is outstanding. Anamika is a volcano of talent. When she was offered Paris Fashion Week and she thought of her style story, she called and said that I was the only person who came to her mind. 

 There are three reasons why Im doing the show firstly, its a privilege that I was the first to come to her mind; second, its the prestigious Paris Fashion Week; third, I sincerely thought we could make magic together.

 The style story hellip; 

 I had to understand what Anamikas clothes were like and the style statement that she was going to make on the international ramp. We brainstormed and came up with a fabulous look that has never been attempted before. I am deviating from my signature style but the line is still very OTT, in a very careless manner. The jewels are an integral part of her story and you cant segregate the outfits from the jewels. We have managed to make them look like second skin, almost like inner garments. The jewels are sensuous and the woman can wear them to bed or while shopping. The style story will showcase a very contemporary woman who is very careless. It is about a modern princess.

 The collection hellip;

 Let us say the line is a modern rendition of my signature style. My style has been changed to suit the mood we plan to take to Paris. Our combination is going to achieve a proportion that will be larger than life. The basics are all in place rooted deeply in tradition but the rendition, as I said, is very modern, very contemporary. I will be dressing 10 to 15 girls, but one girl would be wearing as much as two or three girls would usually wear! I have used single colours and have played with monotone. So there will be diamonds with emeralds or diamonds with rubies but rarely have I mixed the two. I have emphasised the size and style to the hilt.

 Since it is a spring-summer collection, there are beautiful floral pieces. The jewels are mad, but there is a distinct method to the madness. The jewels are almost woven together to fit the skin like a glove. It will be all over, but the attitude is going to be as if its just not there, so careless.

 Jewels on the catwalk hellip;

 Jewellery is per se never a part of Paris Fashion Week. It is usually a part of the accessory stall or trade events. Even John Galliano uses expensive costume jewellery and doesnt put precious gems on the ramp. This is one of the few times that couture jewels have been taken to a mainstream international fashion week. There is no question of jewels not getting seen on the ramp. My jewels will be big, they will always be seen, otherwise I would not do it.

 Take 5

 1. Designers who inspire you?

 I love Alexander McQueen rsquo;s work and John Galliano rsquo;s theatrics.

 2. Designers who don rsquo;t?

 Prada rsquo;s clothes do nothing for me.

 3. Who rsquo;s your muse?

 Madonna. I love her spunk and passion to experiment.

 4. A stone that doesn rsquo;t turn you on?

 I don rsquo;t like opaque gems. Stones have to be translucent to turn me on.

 5. Final word...

 After our show in Paris, stylists there will be forced to re-think what they rsquo;ve been doing all these years

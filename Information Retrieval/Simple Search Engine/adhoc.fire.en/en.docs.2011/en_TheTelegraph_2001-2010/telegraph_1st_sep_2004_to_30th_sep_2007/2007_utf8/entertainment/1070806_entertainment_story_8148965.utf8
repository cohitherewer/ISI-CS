 multiplexes.

 Long queues, block bookings and house full weekends at the four multiplexes around town all for a Bengali film. Anuranan, the directorial debut of Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury, has sprung a pleasant surprise on Tollywood. 

 Made on a budget of little over Rs 1 crore, the urban story of two couples and their strained relationships starring Rahul Bose, Raima Sen, Rituparna Sengupta and Rajat Kapoor has entered the fifth week at INOX City Centre, Fame and 89 Cinemas. Its going strong even at standalone halls, like Priya and Star theatre.

 Anuranan fetched more than Rs 45 lakh in the first three weeks, which is phenomenal for a Bengali film that has been released at the multiplexes with just 10 prints, says Mahendra Soni of Shri Venkatesh Films, the films distributor. It has done much better business than Dosor, Dahan, Faltu or Jara Brishtite Bhijechhilo. Weekends have been house full even in the fourth week, while weekdays have seen 70-80 per cent footfall, Soni adds.

 The first two weeks saw an unprecedented rush at the plexes. We had to turn away around 200 people in the first and second weekends. Even now a handful of people go empty-handed in the weekends, says Prashant Srivastava, vice-president, marketing and films, 89 Cinemas.

 Its the same story at single halls, swamped with huge footfalls. Its a packed house on weekends, while weekdays have around 75 per cent footfall. Most of them are women. Only Yash Raj films have done so well before. Anuranan is a trendsetter in Bengali cinema, says Arijit Dutta, owner of Priya.

 Fans and festivals 

 Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury 

 With wife Indrani and friend Jeet Ganguly, Aniruddha set up Screenplay Films to produce Anuranan. Later, Shemaroo Films came forward to present the movie.

 Shemaroo will release Anuranan in the UK and the US in October. A dubbed version in Hindi is also likely to hit some halls across the country. 

 I had conceived the story way back in 1997. But I had no idea about who would want to produce it. Then, we formed Screenplay... The story of Anuranan is very close to my heart. Some people have asked me why I didnt develop the Raima-Rahul relationship further, but I wanted it to remain undefined. I think thats the reason why its touching a chord with so many, says Aniruddha. The success has landed him a four-film deal with Shemaroo. 

 A screening at the Osian Cinefan Festival in Delhi in July drew a packed house too. The auditorium was spilling over. People stood inside the hall and watched. We got a standing ovation after the show and in the question-answer session, the audience spoke about their own relationships. Some even left with tears, says Aniruddha. 

 Anuranan travels to Bite The Mango festival in the UK in September, followed by Lahore Film Festival and Bangladesh International Film Festival next year.

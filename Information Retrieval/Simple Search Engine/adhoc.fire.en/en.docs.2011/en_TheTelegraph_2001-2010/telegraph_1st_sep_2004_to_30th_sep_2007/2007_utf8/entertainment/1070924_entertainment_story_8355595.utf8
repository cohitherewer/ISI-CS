 Grey amp; Gorgeous

 Graceful ageing is all about attitude and authenticity. What rsquo;s more, men actuallyfind it sexy on a woman. Is it time to ditch the dye?

 Diane Keaton

Anne Kreamer was 49 when she winced at a photograph of herself. She was pictured alongside her teenage daughter and her old friend Aki, whose hair was now grey. Alongside them she appeared, she had to admit, like a confused, schlubby middle-aged woman with a much-too-darkly shellacked helmet of hair. She had hitherto thought her long dark hair made her look youthful. Now she saw her pretence for what it was pretence. She decided that in her 50th year she would embrace authenticity.

 Going Gray (as she calls her book) was not a decision taken lightly. Kreamer and her husband Kurt Andersen, the novelist, live in Manhattan, surrounded by metropolitan media chic. Andersen writes for New York magazine and hosts a radio arts programme. They founded Spy magazine with Graydon Carter. Nora Ephron, screenwriter and wit, is a good friend. Ephrons recent book, I Feel Bad About My Neck, stated unequivocally that you cant be grey-haired in a creative milieu. What has transformed womens lives in our lifetime is not feminism or aerobics, Ephron wrote. What has kept them in the workplace is hair dye. 

 Ephron had a good point. Grey hair makes women feel invisible. Ive had the same long hair, same fringe since schooldays, and the same hairdresser since 1969. It has been my prop: keeping the same hair, I could hold back the tide. Indeed, my time-warp brown bob darkened with age. 

 But recently I had a rethink. I cut my hair short, layered it and lightened it. It was amazing how different I felt. Younger, definitely. Unrecognisably so. People in our tennis club thought that my husband was playing with a New Woman. 

 So I was intrigued to meet Anne Kreamer, whose book is subtitled What I learned was about beauty, sex, work, motherhood, authenticity and everything else that really matters. She looked terrific. Casual-chic, slender, and completely, naturally grey. Over a porridge breakfast in an Edinburgh hotel we agreed that we had clung on to our long dark-fringed hairstyles because we thought they were almost talismanic, indicating that you belong to the age of rockroll and are still jiving.

 Kreamer has, over the years, veered from brunette towards red and blonde, but she was jet-black on her 40th birthday, when her friend Larry told her she looked like her own evil twin. Yet she stayed on the tyrannical treadmill of hair-colour upkeep for another decade. But for whose benefit was she doing this? Like me, she was no longer going to an office every day, surrounded by Bright Young Things. Youve been married 30 years, youre self-employed, your kids are almost adults who are you kidding? she asked herself.

The dilemma about succumbing to grey gave her sleepless nights. Kreamer grasped the nettle: to hell with media-induced cultural hysteria that dictates that grey is unsexy. Why not swim against the tide? Three months into her transformation, with two-tone hair, she almost backslid.

 But she emerged with her hair grey and shorter, feeling sleek and light and sophisticated and unencumbered and optimistic. She was saving thousands of dollars, and hours of time and she still got Hey, beautiful! calls in the street. This was the real revelation. Men find grey hair sexy. Men read youth in attitude and energy and vitality, and the way a woman carries herself. 

 I was dumbfounded. It was counter-intuitive! Were scared of losing our sexual attractiveness, but the exact opposite happened. Perhaps, she concluded, at the age of 50, honesty and authenticity is valued by mature males. 

 She didnt actually go through the charade of dating anyone. But she did go bar-hopping and discovered that the hair was no barrier Its all in the vibes.

 What about the other lurking fear being unwanted in the workplace? When she worked at MTV, looking young had been non-negotiable. Now, masquerading as a returner whose children had grown up, she was advised by headhunters that she could no longer be hired, except as a consultant. A grey-haired woman over 40 is regarded as out of touch, even if she has expertise.

 The paradox, Kreamer points out, is that despite womens progress, the range of acceptable womens looks has narrowed. In the shoulder-padded 1980s, the illusion of perma-youthfulness became obligatory. The breach between the dyers and non-dyers is as great as that between women in paid work and those who stay at home and look after their children. And there is a sense of moral superiority in mothering and going grey.

 Image consultants advised Kreamer to update her clothes, to alter her palette of colours and improve her silhouette. Ninety seven per cent of the respondents in her survey actually said that they would rather be thin and grey than overweight with coloured hair. But perhaps her most interesting discovery was that in the world of politics, where maturity and experience should matter, out of 16 female senators aged 54 to 76, not one has grey hair.

 George Clooney

If only she were more French, instead of being so American, she writes. Catherine Deneuve, Isabel Adjani and Juliette Binoche manage to age with inherent style, without great artifice and without the American obsession with looking youthful. She sought advice from Mireille Giuliano, author of French Women Dont Get Fat, who explained that French men value women of any age who are comfortable in their skins. It gives them a quiet confidence and serenity, that seductive je ne sais quoi.

 Men (who are increasingly prone to dye their hair) should observe George Clooney, Richard Gere, Paul Newman, Steve Martin all gorgeously grey. I asked Kreamers husband whose hair is almost suspiciously dark how he liked being anchored to a grey-haired woman. It was Annes decision. I have never particularly noticed womens hair colour, which is odd given that I earn my living as an observer. I think her hair is lovely, and Im glad shes not spending hundreds of dollars a month. But its not in the top five or even 10 things I care about with regard to my wife. 

 Its definitely in her top five, though. Its significance goes beyond external appearance. Having become honest about my looks, I became more honest in dealing straight with people, she told me. Its about growing up, evolving as a person, letting go of crutches I dont need.

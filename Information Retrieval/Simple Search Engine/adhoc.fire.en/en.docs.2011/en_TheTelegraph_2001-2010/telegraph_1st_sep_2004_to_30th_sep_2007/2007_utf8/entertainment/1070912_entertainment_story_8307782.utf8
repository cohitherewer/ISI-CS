 Act of Almodovar 

 Penelope Cruz in Almodovars All About My Mother

London is awash right now in stage shows adapted from movies from musicals Billy Elliot and Dirty Dancing to the quirky comedy Elling, taken from a Norwegian film.

 Few of the adaptations are as exuberantly theatrical as All About My Mother, a reworking of Spanish director Pedro Almodovars 1999 film. But then few film-makers are as theatrical as Almodovar, an auteur who loves emotion and artifice in equal measure. 

 This production marks the first stage adaptation of an Almodovar script in 20 years, and the first ever production of his work in English.

 All About My Mother, which won an Academy Award for best foreign-language film, is the story of Manuela, a Madrid nurse who returns to Barcelona to confront the ghosts of her past after a traumatic event. Its characters include pregnant nuns, transsexual prostitutes and theatrical divas; its plot contains sex and drugs and three untimely deaths. It is unabashedly emotional, heart-wrenching and warm-hearted. Almodovars style is so distinctive, his recipe so unique a dash of melodrama here, a scoop of social realism there that there are many ways this stage version could have gone wrong. For the most part, it doesnt.

 Playwright Samuel Adamsons adaptation takes liberties with the films plot but feels true to its spirit. Almodovar who attended the opening night alongside Penelope Cruz, one of the films stars has said the play is very different from the script I wrote and at the same time its absolutely faithful to the story, to the spirit and to the characters.

 The play opens with a sequence involving an organ transplant, and one of its themes is the resilience of the human heart. It is about love, loss and grief, and survivors regrouping to form new and often unexpected bonds.

 Almodovar draws inspiration from the cinematic womens pictures of the 1940s and 50s in particular the backstage melodrama All About Eve and from the lush emotional plays of Tennessee Williams. Like those works, Almodovar puts the passions, ambitions and relationships of women and, in this case, men who want to be women centre stage.

 The plays language does not always match its visual flair especially in contrast to the chunks of Williams and Federico Garcia Lorca included in the script and it loses some of its buoyancy in the second half.

 The understated performances provide a cooling British counterpoint to the plays Spanish heat.

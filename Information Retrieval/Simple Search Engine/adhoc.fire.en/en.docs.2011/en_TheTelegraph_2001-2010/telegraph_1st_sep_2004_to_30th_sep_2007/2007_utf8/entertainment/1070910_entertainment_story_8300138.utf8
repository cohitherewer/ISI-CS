 Me, muse!

 Scarlett Johansson talks about movies, music and her working relationship with Woody Allen.

Life is good for Scarlett Johansson. The actress and aspiring singer has just recorded her debut album and has a calendar full of film projects.

 At just 22, Johansson has already taken directions from Robert Redford, Brian DePalma, Christopher Nolan and Woody Allen, with whom shes currently working for the third time. Shes shared the screen with John Travolta, Bill Murray, Steve Buscemi and Hilary Swank in roles that have seen her as an outcast, an action star and a little girl lost.

 In her latest project, The Nanny Diaries, Johansson stars opposite Oscar nominees Laura Linney and Paul Giamatti. Set in her hometown of New York City, the film tells the story of a 21-year-old college grad who learns what money can and cant buy when she takes up a job as a live-in nanny for a super-wealthy couples son.

 Speaking from Barcelona, where shes shooting Allens latest film, Johansson talked to The Associated Press about music, her movie career and how she avoids the pitfalls and paparazzi that plague her Hollywood contemporaries.

 Are you Woody Allens new muse? We both kind of think that term is so bizarre. You know, its not like I bring him inspiration when hes got a writers block at three in the morning. We like to work together. Its an easy working relationship and a really nice friendship, so it works out. But I dont know if it goes much further than that.

 What attracted you to The Nanny Diaries? Shari (Springer Berman) and Bob (Pulcini) were attached to it...had written the script, and I was a big fan of American Splendor. So I met with them...and we just got along incredibly well. The three of us spent hours talking about everything, and we have sort of similar upbringings, and were all from New York. Thats what attracted me to the project to begin with. Of course, (also) just the opportunity to play somebody who was a girl who I very easily could have been friends with or known. I felt like Id never really had the opportunity to play someone that I could so easily relate to, someone my own age. I just really loved the script. I thought it was clever and funny and a nice opportunity to do kind of a broad comedy. It was all very attractive.

 How did you like working in your hometown? New York is such a great city to shoot in. Its been a long time since Ive been able to shoot at home and its just so much fun. Its wonderful to be able to just see your friends after work, to be able to go home and sleep in your own bed. Its just such a pleasure.

 What about this album youre releasing? Its all Tom Waits covers?

 Ive always been a huge fan of Tom Waits and I had this kind of golden opportunity to make an album however I wanted and its kind of a dream chance. Originally I thought that I would do an album of standards and I wanted to include a Tom Waits song. And I dont know, I thought maybe everybody does standards, and so, I see Tom Waits as being kind of a composer of modern standards and so it seemed appropriate that I could interpret his songs. Obviously, its not an album where Im trying to sound like him. That would be impossible. He writes such beautiful songs and incredible melodies and theyre so cinematic and kind of open-ended so I felt like it would be something that I could be inspired by.

 Has music always been an interest of yours? I actually started acting because I wanted to be in musicals when I was a little girl. Thats where my dream career was going to be when I was eight years old, like the young Cosette in Les Miserables. Then I started making films and I never ended up doing musical theatre. Of course, by the time I turned 13, I kind of buried that part of myself. You know, its always been there. Ive always loved to sing and Ive always loved music and listened to lots of music and all kinds of music.

 Unlike some of your contemporaries, youre not a famous party person and havent been arrested for drunken driving. How do you stay on track? I dont think necessarily that theres trouble looming around the corner for everyone involved in this industry. I have a really wonderful family thats very supportive. Luckily I never really struggled with any kind of, I dont know, image problems or addictions.

 You know, I think its not just people in Hollywood. Its kind of part of just growing up and growing up in the world that we live in today where everything is so available and so fast-paced. Its hard I think for a lot of youths to avoid these pitfalls.

 Obviously the availability of whatever it may be, whether its drugs or alcohol or partying or whatever, is dangerous for people who are prone to addiction or that kind of lifestyle. Im just fortunate enough to never have had that inclination. I guess I attribute that to my parents and friends and the way I was raised.

 How I lost 20 kg...

 DIETER rsquo;S DIARY

 Gynaecological disorders led 41-year-old Namita Mehrotra to join VLCC a year back, in June. I used to suffer from pain in the legs and wanted to lose weight, says Namita, who has managed to shed a good 20 kg in seven months. 

 She currently weighs 67.35 kg. She follows a strict diet and does free hand exercises regularly. Breakfast consists of milk and cornflakes. Around 11am she has one fruit. Lunch is a simple meal of dal, rice, sabzi, salad and curd. In the evening, she has some more fruit. Dinner is similar to lunch for this vegetarian, sans the rice. Before going to bed, she downs a glass of hot milk. This drains away all my tiredness, says Namita. 

 Apart from free hand exercises, she also cycles regularly. I also do pranayam, explains Namita. Post weight loss, she is a happier woman. The whole personality changes, she smiles.

 What: Fashion Adda.

 Where: Khadims Egaro, Howrah and Bhowanipore.

 When: August 23 and 24.

 Chat show: Sananda and Khadims Egaro got together for a chat on fashion that showcased changing trends. Designer Agnimitra Paul was at the Egaro Howrah event on Thursday, where she provided tips on how to look good and be presentable.

 The fair complexioned are probably more blessed because they can carry all colours with ease. There are some colours that suit everybody while others suit a particular complexion type, said Agnimitra. Black, off-white and red are in fashion these days, according to her. The traditional concept of wearing black has been discarded. We find a lot of people using shades of white and red for evening wear, said Agnimitra. Profession, season and time of the day contribute a great deal towards what one should wear, she added. Ladies in the audience had the opportunity to take customised tips on colours and cuts to suit them. 

 The action shifted to Egaro Bhowanipore on Friday afternoon where the guests were designer Divyakanti Sen and actress Sonali Chowdhury. Fashion is identifying oneself, said Divyakanti, who offered tips on the tones to dress up in during the Pujas and emphasised accessorising outfits just right. Be very careful about the shoes you wear and the bag you carry, he said. Divyakanti also fielded questions from the audience (I am a bit flabby. What should I wear?) with skill. Pink, blue and orange are the colours for Ashtami. You can wear black for Dashami, advised Sen. Actress Sonali Chowdhury felt that ones attire should suit ones personality and also the occasion. Questions interspersed the chats, which marked the beginning of a series of in-house fashion shows to be held every month at both outlets.

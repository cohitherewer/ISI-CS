 HOW THE REEL AND REAL HAVE COME TOGETHER FOR BRAD PITT

While news about Jesse James crawled its way across 19th century America compared to todays lightning-fast Internet, the tone was uncannily comparable to todays celebrity coverage, Brad Pitt found in reading those old accounts.

 I will say I was surprised to see how tabloid journalism was alive and well even then and operating in the same way, just sensationalising a complete fabrication of untruths, said Brad Pitt, who stars as the legendary outlaw in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.

 Theres just more of it today. Theres more of it in quantity, but the executions the same. In that day, when you only had a newspaper to get your information, that would have been the extent of it. But it doesnt seem to have changed at all, Pitt said at the Toronto International Film Festival.

 Pitt and Angelina Jolie, stars of the 2005 hit Mr and Mrs Smith, have been the quarry of celebrity photographers and the object of incessant tabloid gossip since they hooked up amid the break-up of Pitts marriage to Jennifer Aniston. A media vigil preceded the birth of their daughter in Namibia last year, and crowds swelled during the Toronto festival everywhere they went.

 In the late 1800s, James was able to move anonymously through America under a series of aliases, but his notoriety was unparalleled. Jamess image as a Robin Hood-style bandit, a myth he helped perpetuate himself, had made him a folk hero to the public and a demon to the railroads.

 Based on Ron Hansens novel, Assassination of Jesse James dissects the James myth to present a charismatic man in the last year of his life, as his sense of security crumbles and he is overwhelmed by paranoia that associates are selling him out to the law. Into Jamess inner circle comes young idolator Ford (Casey Affleck), who has grown up on romanticised stories of the outlaws deeds. Initially intimate, Ford later becomes an object of scorn for Pitts increasingly unpredictable James.

 Ford eventually feels compelled to become Jamess executioner, coming to believe its almost a civic duty. I dont know what led to his idea, the need to destroy the very thing that he worshipped, but thats certainly whats going on here. You have a demoralised boy, a boy whos subject to humiliation, and in his quiet hours has this lust for the Jesse James celebrity, the Jesse James phenomenon, said Pitt, 43.

 Then at the point where he meets Jesse James, meets his idol, and his idol spurns him, it becomes that thing, needing to destroy the thing you love to become equal with it again.

 At two hours and 40 minutes, Assassination of Jesse James is a challenging tale, yet one that has drawn praise for the lyrical melancholy of its 19th century landscapes and for the key performances. The film earned the best actor prize at the Venice Film Festival for Pitt, a previous Supporting Actor Academy Awards nominee for Twelve Monkeys, who could be in contention for a lead actor Oscar this time.

 The celebrity mystique that surrounds Pitt meshed well with the mythic nature of James, said Andrew Dominik, director of Assassination of Jesse James. It was the sort of part that you could cast a movie star in and it would make sense, Dominik said. It wouldnt be miscasting Brad, who you never really feel like you know onscreen. Hes always retained kind of an essential mystery. Hes not a person people really identify with. Hes more of an object to them. They aspire to be him, but they dont really identify with him. Those were really good qualities for Jesse. Theyre both enigmatic and charismatic.

 Pitt first caught widespread notice in a scene-stealing role in 1991s Thelma amp; Louise and went on to star in such films as Legends of the Fall, Spy Game, Troy and last years acclaimed Babel, co-starring Cate Blanchett. Blanchett and Pitt reunite for next years The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Pitts third film with David Fincher (Se7en), based on F. Scott Fitzgeralds story about a man who is born old and ages backward toward infancy.

 Hes just so open. Hes a great player. Brad loves a good idea and a good conversation, and I think that extends to acting, really, Blanchett said. I think hes got a really good nose for what works, and I think people will be blown away by him in Benjamin Button.

 Pitt now is shooting the Coen brothers dark comedy Burn After Reading with George Clooney, his partner in crime in Oceans Eleven and its two sequels. While Pitt looks for roles that offer fresh dramatic possibilities, finding good work companions such as Clooney has become crucial in his job choices. As I get older, its the company I keep, Pitt said. It means something to me to have these friends out here and people I respect... Most of the movie is spent when the cameras not rolling, and to work with these interesting people is really the most important thing to me.

 With his production company Plan B, Pitt also is active as a producer whose credits include Jolies recent drama A Mighty Heart. (He also was a producer of Assassination of Jesse James.) Pitt jokes that the advantage of todays celebrity culture is that people are not carrying six-shooters around the way they did in Jamess day. Even so, as a new father, Pitt is mindful of the potential dangers that come with fame.

 Along with their biological daughter, Pitt and Jolie have three children she adopted from Cambodia, Ethiopia and Vietnam. Its something that I want to be aware of and be cautious about, especially with the family, that everybodys protected, Pitt said. I mean its rare, but there are imbalanced people out there. Ive had break-ins in the house... Ive had some of these abnormal incidents that can be a bit frightening.

 Pitt is quick to acknowledge questions about plans for more children. Were not done. They say, any plans for a fifth? And I say, And a sixth, and a seventh, and an eighth, and a ninth. Thats my answer.

 They also made a nine-foot-wide bed to fit him, Jolie and all four children. Just big enough. One more and well have to go to 11 feet.

 Sari splendour

 Now there rsquo;s another sari destination to shop at this festive 

 season. From a modest beginning in a Burrabazar lane to 

 the swank store at 6 Wood Street, Rita rsquo;s Boutique has arrived. This family-run business is the brainchild of Rita Bhotika and her son Harsh 

 Vardhan Bhotika, both self-taught. Among their stylistic innovations are the ldquo;dolphin-

 cut sari rdquo;, which basically comes with a fixed pallu that requires no cumbersome pleating. There is also the ghagra-panel sari with rich zardosi work and a lehnga fit.

 ldquo;We started off with tie-and-dye six years ago and then graduated to designing 

 saris. This is the fourth store that we are opening in the city and plan to launch an Indo-

 western line soon, rdquo; explains Rita. The use of leather, sequins and satin on georgette 

 and chiffon creates a distinctive style. There is a range of satin saris for the fall-winter 

 season. ldquo;We have used traditional Benarasi designs and borders, inspired by my 

 grandmother rsquo;s saris, on georgette and chiffon to create a dramatic effect, rdquo; said Harsh. 

 The salwars in cotton and satin have dull gold embroidery, patchwork, zardosi and 

 other embellishments. The saris start at Rs 1,700 and go up to Rs 25,000.

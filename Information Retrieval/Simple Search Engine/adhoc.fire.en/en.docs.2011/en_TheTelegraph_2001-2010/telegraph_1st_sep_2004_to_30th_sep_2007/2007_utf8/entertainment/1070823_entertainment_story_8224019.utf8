 Sweet treat

 What: Christmas cake-mixing ceremony.

 Where: The Oberoi Grand.

 When: August 20.

 Cake mix: Chefs at The Oberoi Grand are rolling up their sleeves four months before Santa packs his bags and mounts his reindeer. The traditional Christmas cake-mixing ceremony saw singer Usha Uthup and actress June turn bakers for the day, donning gloves and digging their hands into 50kg of chopped fruits and nuts including apricots, candied fruit peels, black currants, almonds, cashews and prunes. Wow, this is a stress-buster, grinned June. With liquor like rum, brandy and scotch working its way into the mix, the aromas were heady.

 The annual procedure involves soaking the mix for four months in the chiller, so the flavours have a chance to mingle. Early December, the mix will be blended with the batter and sent into the oven to bake.

 I bake 85 cakes every year. I go to New Market and pick up the dry fruits myself, which are then cut by my children and grandchildren, shared Usha. What is so special about the whole thing is that I am Hindu, married into a Christian Keralite family and the bakers in Park Circus are Muslim. Its the perfect example of how in Calcutta, every person, regardless of their religious roots, has a hand in celebrating festivals.

 Voiceover: Its auspicious to begin the season with a traditional gesture of goodwill. Its not just about the taste: mixing the fruits and nuts symbolises harmony, said Amitabh Rai, general manager, The Oberoi Grand.

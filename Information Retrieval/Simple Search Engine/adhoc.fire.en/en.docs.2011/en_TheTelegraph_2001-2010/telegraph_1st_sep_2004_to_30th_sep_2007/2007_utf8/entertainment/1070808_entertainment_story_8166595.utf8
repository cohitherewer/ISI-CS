 Himesh to do a Rishi

 T-Series has bought the rights from Mukta Arts to remake 

 Subhash Ghais musical classic Karz which will 

 star Himesh Reshammiya in Rishi Kapoors role. The 

 director of the new Karz is still being decided since 

 Subhash Ghai has refused to direct or produce his own movies.

 How can I remake my own 

 scripts when today I am full of new ideas and concepts? 

 But I am sure Karz will be welcomed by a new generation 

 with a new kind of making. I wish Himesh and Bhushan of 

 T-Series my best, said the showman.

 The movie is scheduled for release 

 in August next year.

 Blue highs to baby Spice

 The big win of Team India on I-Day eve kept bloggers busy, as did the two Khans rsquo; capers

 BLOGLOG

 Indias series win in England has sent keyboards clattering. Bloggers are dissecting the Indian team, discussing how Dravid should have enforced the follow-on, how R.P. Singh was under-bowled, how Sachin must practise his bowling more, and how Harbhajan was missed. There is an old saying that it is better to be lucky than good, and Dravids side was lucky, posts a blogger. We all know a 2-0 win would have been better, but if that didnt happen, do we go hammer-and-tongs at Rahul Dravid and his boys? Hmmm

 I-Day was the talk of the virtual world too from remixes of national songs being played in smoke-filled discs, to memories of The Rajpath, India Gate, Vijay Chowk, Red Fort, the parades, unfurling of the national flag and singing of the national anthem, to I-Day billboards, to the Armys hard work in getting the Indian media to show that all is well in Kashmir. We call ourselves a democracy, but does it mean burning the effigies of Richard Gere just because he gave Shilpa Shetty a peck on the cheek, or banning a movie like Parzania just because it shows some people the bitter truth? Protests like the one that got justice for Jessica Lall are the ones we should advocate. We as a country, united, can make a difference. Happy Birthday India.

 Welcome Skype on your iPhone. Technophiles are raving about how a Germany-based company, well-known for creating mobile instant messaging clients, has just announced Skype for iPhone, an iPhone-optimised web site that allows you to access Skype via the browser on the iPhone.

 Mama Mia! Baby Spice is now Mummy Spice. Emma Bunton, 31, gave birth to a baby boy named Beau last week at Londons Portland hospital. Beau is Emmas first baby, and his dad is mommys long-time boyfriend Jade Jones. I cant believe she asked for Coca-Cola and flapjacks following the birth, gasped a blogger. Whats the punchline of Coke again? Lets pick Thanda matlab Coca-Cola over Paanch.

 The Khans continued to dominate showbiz this week with SRKs Chak De! India hitting the halls and Salmans English debut Marigold releasing this Friday. Everyone is curious about Ali Larter, who plays an American actress trying to make it in Bollywood. Playboy Salman Khan had promised co-star Ali Larter that he would make it to Taj Mahal with her. However, we dont think he could ever get a monument like the Taj made even for his lady love because that would leave him no time for painting and partying, or even chinkara and blackbuck shoots! cracks one blogger.

 RICHARD GERE PLAYS A ROGUISH FRAUDSTER IN HIS NEXT FILM

It was the most audacious hoax ever perpetrated on the publishing industry. In 1971, a little-known author named Clifford Irving claimed to have obtained the sought-after memoirs of probably the most famous man in the world: the ultra-reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes. Claiming to have had a series of exclusive interviews with the paranoid tycoon, Irving landed himself a book deal worth half a million pounds and almost succeeded in fooling the world with what he claimed was Hughess authorised autobiography. It was only when Hughes himself broke a decade-long silence to give a telephone press conference declaring the book a giant fraud that Irving was exposed as a liar. He was jailed for two-and-a half years, his wife Edith for two and his helper, Dick Susskind, for six months. Irvings mistress, Baroness Nina van Pallandt, was one of the witnesses who testified at his trial and went on to become a successful actress and singer.

 Determined to wring some money from his deception, Irving wrote The Hoax, which forms the basis for a new film starring Richard Gere as the roguish fraudster, the British actor Alfred Molina as Susskind, Marcia Gay Harden as Edith and Julie Delpy as Nina van Pallandt.

 Directed by Lasse Hallstrom, the film takes a few liberties with the truth. Were not making a documentary about Clifford here, were telling a larger, dramatic story, says Gere. The early 1970s, when this happened, was a time of radical change all over the planet. France and the US were in upheaval and there was the Vietnam War. At the time, Hughes touched many different power structures and controlled them...The small story is of this guy and his friend and his wife who do the scam and theyre caught. The larger story is how that resonates through not just the small lies but the larger lies of that period. 

 Irving himself has been critical of the script, describing it in a newspaper interview as goofy, but he is keeping a low profile in the runup to the films release. Everything in the script came either from Clifford personally or from his book, so he was intimately involved in this as it evolved, Gere says. Its absurd for him to say he didnt have anything to do with it.

 The actor makes no apologies for declining to meet Irving before making the movie, preferring to rely on the script and his own research. There were books about him and the episode, and we had a lot of film and footage on Clifford. I felt very clear about what I wanted to do... Hes clearly a manipulative man and I really didnt want to be overinfluenced by his point of view or in any sense wanting to come off as a good guy in the movie, he says.

 I wanted to be as tough as we needed to be. There was some talk that we would do some interviews together now the movie is coming out but for some reason he hasnt been around. Apparently, hes a guy who cant be trusted.

 Although Gere is enthusiastically beating the drum for The Hoax now, when he was first offered the part four years ago he turned it down flat. It didnt grab me and I didnt think I was right for the part, he says. Im not sure why I had that reaction because two years later, when Lasse called me and said he wanted me to do the film, I read it again and immediately felt I had to make the movie. I thought the script really captured the schizophrenia of that time in America and the coming together of all the elements of that period the New York publishing industry and Watergate and Nixon and Vietnam and Pop Art. It resonated more now than it did when it was originally written, partly because of the war were having.

 Gere believes Irving came close to succeeding with his incredible hoax, banking on Hughess seclusion and notoriously tenuous hold on reality. If Hughes himself hadnt spoken up, it probably would have happened, Gere says. Everyone wanted it to be true because it was such a great story and they could see dollar signs.

 Now 57, Gere has been a star for more than 30 years. He has never fully understood how he became a sex symbol after American Gigolo in 1980 but it stood him in good stead, leading to roles as the aspiring Navy pilot in An Officer and a Gentleman (1982), a rogue cop in Internal Affairs (1990) and Pretty Woman (1990). He reverted to his musical roots in 2002 to tap dance and sing his way through Chicago as the flamboyantly cynical lawyer Billy Flynn, for which he received a Golden Globe, a Critics Choice and a Screen Actors Guild award. Although by then in his mid-50s, he was teamed opposite Jennifer Lopez in the romantic comedy Shall We Dance in 2004, and continues to work regularly, most recently in the yet-to-be released thriller The Flock and as one of multiple actors portraying Bob Dylan in Im Not There. Its a miracle Ive ended up where I am because Im the worlds worst auditioner, he says. Based on an audition, I dont think I could ever get a job. I was just too nervous and I hated people judging me.

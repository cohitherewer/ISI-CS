 David and Victoria Beckham

Victoria Beckham sounds insecure when it comes to David Beckhams popularity off the pitch. It has been reported that she has warned the Hollywood club crowd to stay away from her husband. Now that they have shifted base to Los Angeles, Victoria is possibly finding it hard to keep David out of gaze-and-grab range of all those party girls on the Loos.

 Topping Posh Spices hit list is Paris Hilton, no less. When she heard the hotel heiress describe the Los Angeles Galaxy star as hot, Victoria decided to bolt the door before the stud fled. She warned Paris and other young Hollywood stars including Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears to keep their hands off her David.

A source reveals that although she trusts David 100 per cent, she will not tolerate any of the Los Angeles party girls making a move on him, or seeing him as fair game. This move to LA means everything to Posh Spice. She is happier with David than ever before and looks at this dramatic shift of pitch as the most exciting chapter of her life.

 Apparently Paris had offered her friendship to Victoria saying that We could be soulmates. Someone who read Victorias mind overheard: Over my dead body!

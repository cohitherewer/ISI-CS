 Thriller with a conscience 

 OSCAR NOMINEE ASHVIN KUMAR HAS MOVED ON FROM LITTLE TERRORIST TO A FULL-LENGTH FEATURE. HERE, HE TAKES US TO THE FOREST

 Ashvin Kumar rsquo;s The Forest

 He was our only hope at the 2005 Oscars. And even though Ashvin Kumar missed out on the Best Live Action Short Film Academy Award, Little Terrorist went on to become a groundbreaking film, being the first short to be screened commercially at theatres.

 Now, fashion designer Ritu Kumars son is ready with his first full-length feature film. The Forest, shot in Corbett National Park and Bandargarh National Park, is a thriller with an environmental conscience.

 Starring Javed Jaaferi, Nandana Dev Sen, Salim Ali Zaidi, Tarun Kumar and Ankur Vikal, the international film is slated for a September release in India. Reason enough for a t2 chat with Ashvin.

 After Little Terrorist and all the acclaim, did you think it was time to venture into full-length features? Or was that a decision taken before all that?

The Forest was written soon after Little Terrorist was completed (September 2004). The intention was to use the medium of short film as a stepping stone into full-length features. I wanted to create a portfolio of work that I could show to demonstrate my film-making abilities.

 In addition, I just had some limited theory of how to make films before I started on my first (short) film Road To Ladakh. The only way to learn how to make a film is to actually go out and do it yourself. I wanted to have an opportunity to experiment and learn without the pressure of a full-length feature.

 When you wrote The Forest, a script obviously longer than the short films, what was the teething trouble?

 Well, The Forest is actually my third full-length feature film screenplay. I spent two years writing the first two and abandoned them because they were not up to the mark. Ive taught myself pretty much everything I know today. Writing a good screenplay is not an easy job.

 I think I made things even more difficult for myself by experimenting with my screenplays quite a bit. Actually, Little Terrorist is my most straightforward screenplay. It does not bend genres or take structural risks. The Forest on the other hand does a lot of that.

 Like what?

I had set some pretty unusual goals for The Forest it had to be a thriller but with a dramatic core that explores a psychological relationship. At the same time, I wanted it to talk about the horrific consequences of mans destruction of the environment. These are pretty disparate themes woven into a single narrative. It would have been infinitely easier to write a thriller and obey the rules of that genre but I like to push things to see how far I can go. I do so not for the sake of it, I do it when the need arises. The need did not arise in Little Terrorist, but it did in The Forest.

 You are making English films with actors who are not major stars in Bollywood. What is the intention?

 It is not my interest to make an anti-thesis to anything. I make films. There are a lot of stories to be told from India. My desire is for my films to be seen by as many people as possible within India and IN the rest of the world. I think I have found a way of doing this.

 But why not go for big stars after the Oscar nomination and the big buzz about Little Terrorist? 

 My e-mail and phone were flooded with calls from some of the biggest stars in Hindi cinema after I returned from the Oscar ceremony in Hollywood. In fact, I met quite a few of them and did extensive auditions but eventually, I was looking for people who would do justice to my script and live the characters as I had written them. 

 I think our cinema really needs actors who are also beautiful people. With newer, more unusual, films coming out I am sure well evolve a star system that has some great actors as well.

 The Forest was made for international audiences. The choice was either to cast a mainstream Hollywood actor or go with good actors from India. My script did not have a place for a Hollywood star. So the choice was quite simple, really.

 Would you ever work with a Shah Rukh Khan or a Hrithik Roshan?

 I would love to cast a big star in an intensely dramatic, award-winning role but first and foremost I would like to work with people who inspire me and whose creativity I can push... actors who are truthful and will invest themselves entirely in their craft. The process is much more important than personalities, and for me the final result is the only consideration. 

 Now that you have completed The Forest, how would you sell it?

 The film is an edge-of-your-seat, gripping thriller human beings are in a dense jungle and being hunted by a man-eating leopard. A compelling animal movie has not been made for a long time in India and with the success of films such as Anaconda we have something that will appeal to audiences across the country.

 We are going for a mainstream commercial release in four languages including English. We will be dubbing the film into three languages (Tamil, Telugu and Hindi) and though our main market is going to be multiplex audiences we will be looking to go into smaller towns and target single screens as well.

 What next?

 A feature film set in Kashmir or Ladakh in the genre of action-adventure. It is set in the world of terrorism, Islam and fanaticism. I am also working on a full-length documentary on my travels through India by road. I will start work on two urban feature films one set in Delhi, a gritty love story set in the world of crime and sex, and the other one set in Bangalore. I want to tell great stories artistically, which are socially relevant and entertaining at the same time.

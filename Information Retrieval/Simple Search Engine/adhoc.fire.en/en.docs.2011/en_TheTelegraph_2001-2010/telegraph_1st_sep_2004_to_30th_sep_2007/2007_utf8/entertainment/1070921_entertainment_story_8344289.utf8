 The tanned look

 Partha Sarathi Joarder, who made the sleaze film Premrog early this year, is on to his next, Phera. But Joarder has chosen a more sober topic for this film starring Rituparna Sengupta and Shilajit.

 Phera is about love, separation and sacrifice where Rituparna plays a tribal woman. 

 This is the first time I will play a tribal woman and its a very interesting role. I will have a tanned look; the make-up and hair will be very different too, said Rituparna at the Phera launch party on Wednesday evening. I am very busy back in Mumbai. I have Anup Dass Dil Ke Armaan with Divya Dutta coming up. Its about surrogate motherhood, she added. 

 Phera will be Rituparnas second film opposite Shilajit after Dwitiya Basanta. 

 The Rs 65-lakh film goes on the floor on September 24. It will be shot in Bolpur, Mython and Calcutta.

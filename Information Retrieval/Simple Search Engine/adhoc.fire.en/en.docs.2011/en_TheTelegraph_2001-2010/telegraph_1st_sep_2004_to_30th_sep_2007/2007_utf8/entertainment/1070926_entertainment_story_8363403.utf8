 Spotlight

Jara Brishtite Bhijechhilo has fetched director Anjan Das (picture beside) the Special Directors Award at the Almaty International Festival in Kazakhstan earlier this month. 

 Starring Indrani Halder, Joy Sengupta and Roopa Ganguly, the film is an adaptation of Joy Goswamis eponymous verse novel. 

 The film was screened at the Almaty festival on September 18. Eleven feature films from Spain, Russia and Georgia were also screened at the festival, which began on September 15. 

 This is the first Bengali film to be screened at Kazakhstan and I didnt expect the kind of response Jara Brishtite got. People asked me all kinds of questions. They liked the films treatment.... Many of them were also not aware of regional cinema. Indian cinema to them means Bollywood, says Das, back in town. Apart from Jara Brishtite, the only Indian films to have a screening at the Almaty festival were by Raj Kapoor and Dilip Kumar. Naturally, I am very proud and excited.

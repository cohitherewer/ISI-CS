 Koffee twice as hot

 Lara Dutta, Karan Johar and Katrina Kaif in Koffee With Karan 

With two of Bollywoods sexiest divas Lara Dutta and Katrina Kaif on the couch, this weeks episode of Koffee with Karan (Sunday, STAR One and STAR World, 9pm) promises to be piping hot. Excerpts:

 Karan: Looking hot and sexy and showing more than you would like to has also been a reason for people to notice you, dont you think?

 Lara: Coming from a glamourous background... from being part of the modelling industry being a Miss Universe. Put me in a jeans, T-shirt, a pair of sneakers and I will make it look hot!

 Karan: On this show

 we like to talk about scandals, controversies all

 of those things. You have never gone on record and

 admitted your relationship with Salman Khan.

 Katrina: I thought you are going to wait for at least 10 minutes, you know (laughs).

 Karan: We like to push it right in your face. Are you trying to get over this and then get ahead to the next question?

 Katrina: No. I mean Cancerians are like everyone knows They are crabs that have this hard shell on the outside and inside they have these soft little things....

 Karan: One second was this the answer to my question? Where did she go? It felt like Bejan Daruwala suddenly all astrology.

 Katrina: Ok. I have got a very good answer to that. This is like trying-to-be-a-good-Indian-girl kind of an answer. But, I really think... marriage is eventually when you settle down so why, bother giving this big before-marriage diary of, you know, this is what happened and then this happened and that.

 Karan: Are you single Katrina? I am trying every trick in the trade. Okay, I am turning left, are you single Lara?

 Lara: Nice try. I dont know. I do not encourage speculation.

 Karan: Why, you are dating an Italian man I heard last....

 Lara: Oh ya! I am running a contest with newspapers. Whoever can bring me the photograph of the Italian I can identify, that newspaper is going to get the breaking news scoop.

 Karan: Bipasha and you have steamy stuff happening. I believe there were daggers drawn. You all dont look at each other, there is no camaraderie.

 Katrina: Ahhh. I think that honestly, that is something, you will have to ask her. As far as the whole situation goes, I did try to clarify myself....

 Karan: But, do you wish each other when you come face to face you and Bipasha.... Do you all say hello?

 Katrina: No.

 Karan: What happens Lara, in this industry when you get attached or you have rumours and controversies about you with leading men which is not true? How does that place you?

 Lara: The media keeps falling for the same time-tested ploy. Every time there is a film releasing, the makers of the film or the publicists or whoever decide that it would be so exciting to spread these rumours that the two leading male and female stars are having a scene with each other and the media keeps falling for it again and again. 

 Karan: And with you darling (to Katrina), have you also been through these experiences in the few years that youve been here?

 Katrina: No! Nobody links me with anyone!

 Lara: Theyre too scared (laughs)!

 Karan: Because youre dating Salman?.... Theyre just scared Katrina. No ones linking you because they are just worried about the repercussions. 

 Katrina: No ya! They dont! Maybe Im just so undesirable! Im going through those thoughts lately. Whats going on?

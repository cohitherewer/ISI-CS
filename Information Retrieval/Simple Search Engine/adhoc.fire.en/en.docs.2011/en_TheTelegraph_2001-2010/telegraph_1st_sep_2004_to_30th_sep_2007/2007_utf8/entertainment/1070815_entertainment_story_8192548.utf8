 Cotton cool

 s

 How in sync are you with the Cool with Cotton line?

 I totally support it. Considering India does not have the coolest climate, I think it is very important to build awareness about the fabric. I am in cotton all the time, be it a cotton ganjee or a pair of trousers. Some of my favourite shops, including Fabindia, are into cotton-based clothes. 

 What is your fashion forecast for the coming Pujas?

 It is going to be cotton (laughs)! I love cotton. Being casual and understated can be the best fashion statement. Choose one style for yourself and stick to it. Coming up with a fashion statement every day is ridiculous.

 Have you seen Bong Connection? Now that the movie is doing so well, do you regret having not done it?

 I think whatever happens, happens for the best. No, I havent seen the film. But I am very happy that it is doing well because my sister (Raima) is in the film. There was a date problem because of which I couldnt do the film. My first priority was Mukta Arts to whom I was committed for Apna Sapna Money Money..?, which has also done very well and has given me recognition.

 Are you interested in doing Bengali films?

 I have always been interested in doing Bengali cinema. In fact, Anjan Dutt had approached me for Bow Barracks Forever. The role was that of a schoolgirl (Sohini Pal did it). I did not do it because I did not like the role.

 One Bengali director you would like to work with?

 I would love to work with Aparna Sen. 

 What are your forthcoming films? 

 I have Love Game (co-starring Rituparna Sengupta and Randeep Hooda) coming up. Then there is Mera Bharat Mahan. In Heyy Babyy, scheduled for August 24, I am there in a song that features 20 other actresses.

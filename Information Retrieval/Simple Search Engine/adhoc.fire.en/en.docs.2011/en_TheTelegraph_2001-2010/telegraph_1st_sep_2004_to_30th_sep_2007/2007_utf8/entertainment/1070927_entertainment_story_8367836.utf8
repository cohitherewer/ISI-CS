The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Fatman Slim

 Adnan Sami

 Fitness for me: Is feeling good about yourself and being comfortable in your skinand buying clothes from a normal store!

 The Bollywood body I envy the most: No one.

 The Bollywood heroine with the fittest body: Ill have to closely examine them first (laughs)!

 The body I would like to have: Arnold Schwarzeneggers, but without the rigorous workouts!

 My diet: I dont eat bread, rice, sugar, oil. Instead, I eat food with high protein.

 My fitness regimen: One-and-a-half hours on the treadmill, 40 minutes in the gym and a game of tennis sometimes.

 The supplements I take: None.

 The body part I love exercising: My jaw, when I eat!

 The body part I hate exercising: My legs.

 I started exercising after: I looked at the mirror!

 My first workout was: Difficult. I walked 10 steps in a shopping mall with my dad and a walking stick for support, then sat down for 15 minutes to catch my breath. But I was determined and I resumed.

 The gym I workout in: Oberoi Sky Gardens.

 The best gym I ever worked out in: A steakhouse called Gym they had great starters!

 My personal trainer: Prashant.

 The best compliment I have got: You look great!

 Relationship between fitness and health: Theyre definitely inter-connected. If youre fit, youre healthy and dont have to deal with other complications.

 Relationship between fitness and good looks: None. There is a misconception that you need to be thin to be good looking. Thats just not true. Marilyn Monroe, Sophia Loren were all well-built, and theyre all timeless, classic beauties! I wanted to buy a shirt once that said, Im fat, but youre ugly; and I can diet!

 Relationship between fitness and self confidence: Tremendous. I have always been confident because of my profession but the weight loss has just added a whole new dimension.

 My advice to young overweight people aspiring to lose weight: You must consult a nutritionist and find out what kind of diet suits your body type. Dont follow anything blindly without supervision. If I can do it, so can you!

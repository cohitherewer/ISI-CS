The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Secrets of Sexy Sam

 Sameera Reddy 

Fitness for me is: A state of the mind. It also involves making a lifestyle change. You incorporate what works for you

 Bollywood actress whose body I envy the most: Shilpa Shetty. But I cant say I would like to have anyones body. Everybodys body type is totally different. You only need to compete with yourself

 Bollywood hero with the fittest body: Hrithik Roshan

 My fitness regimen: I do everything from swimming to power yoga to running, jogging and weights. But I alternate. Every week its a change. Also, because I travel so much, it depends on what I can do where I am. I usually work out for an hour every day

 My diet: In the morning, I have three egg whites with a brown bread toast. I believe in having a series of mini meals throughout the day. I have lots of fruits like watermelon, papaya or banana in between my meals. I also have fresh juices through the day. I usually have a salad of sprouts in the afternoon. I have a very early dinner at 8pm. Its usually some lean meat or grilled fish and some veggies. I hardly have any carbohydrates. I stay away from aerated drinks, maida, fried stuff and anything with sugar

 I forget dieting: When I see Chinese and south Indian food

 My energy supplement: The only thing I do take is Spirulina which gives me energy. I also take multi-vitamins

 The body part I love training: My legs. I have got strong legs. I can really sculpt them well so I really enjoy doing a good leg workout

 The body part I hate training: My arms. Im pretty lazy when it comes to my upper body

 My best body feature: I think my legs, because I really work hard on them. With my height, I think it really works for me

 My worst body feature: Maybe my triceps

 I started exercising after watching: My two really hot sisters, Meghna and Sushama. It was enough motivation for me. It was a lot of pressure looking at them

 the fittest of em all: I think we three will agree that I have the fittest body because I had to work the most for it. They are naturally gifted with slim bodies. Thats why they tend to become complacent

 My first workout: I went to Joggers Park with my dad and I remember I couldnt even do one round. Today, I do 30 rounds and it doesnt bother me at all

 The gym I go to: Leena Mogre; and I love going to Otters Club near Joggers Park. I also work out with Prashant, who trains Shah Rukh

 When I work out I feel: Im on cloud nine. Its been scientifically proven that when you work out, your body starts to generate certain chemicals which actually make you feel good

 My workout partner is: My iPod. The music pushes me

 My take on steroid use: I think its absolutely disgusting for anybody to even take a fat burner because for short-term gains you are losing your long-term health. It has taken me a very long time to get the body that I have and Im very happy I have done it the right way

 A piece of advice for aspiring fitness freaks: Eating less or not eating is not the way to lose weight. And having short-term goals is not how you will be able to achieve the body you want. Work hard and try to maintain it. And lastly, dont do it for others, do it for yourself!

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Patriots and paparazzi

 Bloggers favourite topic was Sanjay Dutt as he begins a six-year sentence. On the discussion board was how Munnabhai is now Sanjaybhai, the carpenter, whether he should be allowed to smoke in prison, how 19-year-old daughter Trishala Dutt, sitting far away in her New York home with maternal grandparents wished she was with him. A Save Sanjay campaign has also been doing the rounds. A third category of ppl (people) who were worried abt (about) something else were totally ignored... They are none other than those who were eagerly waiting for the third Munnabhai sequel Munnabhai Chale Amrika (God Save America)... And one among them is my hubby, wails a blogger.

 Sania Mirza created a flutter by adding a new victim to the list of top 20 players she has vanquished. She defeated Martina Hingis of Switzerland in their second round match in the East West Bank Classic tennis tournament. I am not a major tennis fan But stuff like this does not happen everyday, posts an excited watcher.

 Superstar Shah Rukh Khan is all set to break some stereotypes with his role of a patriotic hockey coach in the film Chak De India which hits theatres this Friday. SRK fans are gaga about how the film is hitting the marquee in style with gala premieres in London and LA. I dont know much about hockey, but the real game mustve been shooting with 16 new girls as co-actors, jokes a film blogger. The film has already scored its first goal it was shot using a little over 1,500 cans of raw stock! (An average Bollywood movie consumes between 300 and 400 cans).

 Its Princess Dianas tenth death anniversary this August 31. And Lindsay Lohans mother Dina fears her daughters life who is one of the most photographed women in the world could end in tragedy like the late Princess Dianas. On a more serious note, bloggers feel that William and Harry have done the right thing by giving the cold shoulder to those who cashed in on Dianas memories. Included in the list of left-out invitees for her memorial service later this month are former private secretary Patrick Jephson, Scotland Yard bodyguard Ken Wharfe and butler Paul Burrell.

 Patriotism begins at home. Writes a blogger: I was made to cram the names of my family members, the extended family, remember the faces of the friends, teachers, neighbours but never once was I asked if I knew my country or its Independence Day Even today, your child would have no difficulty pronouncing the tongue twister names of the Pokemon cartoon characters but what about our leaders names? Good question.

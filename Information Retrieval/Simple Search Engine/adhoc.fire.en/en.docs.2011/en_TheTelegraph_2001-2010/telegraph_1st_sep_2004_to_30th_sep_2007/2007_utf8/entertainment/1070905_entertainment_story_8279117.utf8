 Of rabbits and camels

 SASANGASANA

The Rabbit Pose gets its name because the child appears to resemble a rabbit trying to hide its face from possible attacks. Become a self-reliant rabbit.

 Technique 

 Sit on knees with hips resting on the heels (Vajrasana). Breathe deeply, bending forward the whole body so that the head touches the ground and the forehead touches the knee. Clasp the heels of both feet with both hands. Breathe out, raise the hips slowly into the air and remain in this position with normal respiration. Hold it to a count of 20, increasing it gradually to 100. Repeat once or twice. Lie down in Shavasana to relax.

 Safety tips

 Do not force the forehead to touch the knees. Let the forehead face the knees instead from a few inches away if your neck or stomach muscles feel stiff, reducing the possibility of injury.

 How it works

 Good endocrinal asana for the pitutary, thyroid glands.

 Common ailments like tonsilitis, sinusitis, mental fatigue can be controlled.

 Relief from migraine headaches and irregular sleeping habits.

 Aids growth in kids who are short.

 Ustra means a camel. In this asana, all the limbs of the body arch like those of a camel. Thus Ustrasana or Camel Pose is self adjusting.

 USTRASANA 

 Technique 

 Kneel on the mat as in Vajrasana. Breathe deeply, letting the back arch backward with support provided by both the arms and the hands clasping the ankles firmly. Hold here, breathing out. Let the stomach take the shape of a camels hump. Drop the head and neck back freely, breathing well for a few seconds. Repeat two to three times a day. Rest in Shavasana to complete.

 If palms do not go back to reach the ankles, then rest on your toes to increase the height, which will make it easier to perform the back arch. Be careful while executing this.

 How it works

 Exercises the lungs, providing relief to asthama-related problems and makes the chest shapely.

 Improves eyesight.

 Helps improve pain in the neck, shoulder and spine region.

 Helps alleviate trouble in the throat and tonsils.

 Relief from headaches.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 What were they in their previous birth?

 In Satyajit Rays film Sonar Kella, young Mukul is taken to a parapsychologist after he is haunted by memories of his past life. The parapsychologist suggests that Mukul may have lived in Rajasthan in his previous life. The boy is taken to Rajasthan and a brilliant story of adventure unfolds, though its not stated in certain terms whether past life exists.Some doctors now, however, are certain it does and are using it professionally. A recent report says that Past Life Regression Therapy (PLRT) is increasingly being accepted as a scientific way of treating emotional and mental trauma. There is, they say, light at the end of a dark tunnel.

 Two doctors in Delhi, with bona fide MBBS degrees, recently conducted a workshop on PLRT. The doctors, Newton Kondaveti and his wife Laxmi, chose this over conventional medicine to help the participants meditate to enable them to regress to their past lives.

 The participants profiles were diverse: there were accountants, scientists and navy cadets, all professionals who need to apply science to their areas of work. There are many paths, claims a website on PLR. It is generally induced through hypnosis when a person is asked to imagine a dark tunnel that has light at the end of it.

 Extraordinary claims are being made of PLRT. When the individual reaches the end of the tunnel he regresses to his past life. And voila! he comes out completely recovered apparently.

 A website on PLRT mentions a Deep Sethi who used to catch a cold every summer. His regressive journey revealed that he was a dinosaur-like creature in an extremely cold desert planet. This is why even a slight increase in the temperature used to set off an acute cold! The knowledge, apparently, saved Sethi. 

 A Bangalore-based software professional was so claustrophobic that he would never take the elevator to his floor. Hed never go to movie halls or malls and would suffer from nightmares of being squeezed into small spaces. Several visits to psychologists amounted to nothing. He visited a past life therapist and a series of regression sessions revealed that he was a wild goat in his previous life. This knowledge cured him!

 Past life theory originates to a great extent in the Eastern religions: Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, though the Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras also had propagated the transmigration of souls. Vishnu is reincarnated nine times in different forms and according to mythology, his 10th avatar (reincarnation, a word that has long passed into English), the Kalki, hasnt been born.

 US actress Shirley MacLaine believes that not only will she enter a new life from this one, but so will her dog. 

 Despite PLR being touted as the panacea, the world doesnt lack its share of sceptics and non-believers. They dismiss past life theory, regression into past life, and the therapy, as bunkum.

 Past life, they say, exists only in the imagination, or as another means for the opportunist to use it as a New Age spiritual technique.

 Prabir Ghosh of the Science and Rationalist Association of India based in Calcutta, says: Reincarnation has not been proved as a fact. The scriptures define the soul as chinta and chetana or thought and consciousness. We all know that our brain cells control the mind and our thoughts and even our subconscious. So the seat of the soul lies in the brain. How can you explain the soul living on after death, then? 

 He adds: Besides, most PLR therapy is done through hypnosis. It is possible to make an individual imagine or see something that he really isnt seeing through hypnotic suggestions.

 The best way to bond

 How Bengali films are reaching out to a younger audience through Orkut.

Tollywood has discovered the best way to reach out to GenX Orkuting. Float a community on the film to catch the eye of the young Netizens and watch them pour their heart out from gushing about their favourite character to trashing a soundtrack.

 To cash in on the new-found social networking tool, more and more Tollywood films are coming up with forums on Orkut, especially after the success of Anjan Dutts The Bong Connection and Aniruddha Roy Chowdhurys Anuranan. The number of young people seeking membership to the Bengali film forums is growing with every release.

 The Bong Connection boasts the highest count 647-plus Orkutians smitten by the film. The members speak straight from the heart, which the moderators feel is a good step towards assessing the film.

 This is also marketing, which happens in an informal way on Orkut. Here, people are more straightforward about their likes and dislikes, which helps us understand what viewers like to see, says actor Arindam Sil, a busy Orkutian who moderates The Bong Connection forum. Bong Connection got a warm response even from people in Mumbai and Pune, adds Sil, who also moderates a community on Dutts recently-shot BBD, starring Naseeruddin Shah, Kay Kay Menon, Jimmy Sheirgill and Sonali Kulkarni.

 BBD is yet to release but its already going strong on Orkut with 62 members signing up for a peek at the films synopsis, cast, crew and shooting details apart from regular updates on the films progress.

 Following in the footsteps of BBD, forthcoming films like Arindam Nandys Via Darjeeling and Soumik Sens No Poblem are creating a buzz among several 20-something Orkutians. Whoever I meet keep asking me about the film, which includes not just friends and family but many others who have heard about Via Darjeeling. The Via Darjeeling forum has interested people from the Darjeeling communities (on Orkut) and others who happened to stumble upon it, says Nandy, who believes people are favourably disposed towards a film if there is enough discussion before release. Actor Prroshant Narayannan and Atul Sabharwal, who wrote the lyrics, are also on the community. They will take part in discussions to promote the film, he adds.

 And no, the film communities do not fade away post-release. Moderators keep the chat going by inviting members to take part in addas. While Anuranan-The Film has started a dialogue on how much people liked the film, Aamra Tollywoods first adult comedy that released last year has a community that still receives occasional posts on favourite characters from the film.

 Raima in The Bong Connection

Members continue to log into The Bong Connection forum, requesting for guitar chords of their favourite tracks, analysing the jazzed-up Pagla hawa or posting reviews. Some have even sent requests for a sequel, smiles Sil.

 Networking on social communities is a good option in the absence of common publicity tools. Aamras release was hasty with no proper publicity. So I thought of creating a community and sent off invites to our friends and their friends. In fact, a lot of people came to watch the film after knowing about it on Orkut, says Anandi, director Goutam Ghoses daughter who designed the costumes for Aamra. Anandi also moderates Yatra The Film, which however fizzled out with the film. The Padakkhep community, moderated by the films producer Nitesh Sharma, also failed to strike it rich on Orkut. The cause, they say, is the films older target audience.

 Other popular Bengali film communities on Orkut are New Wave Bengali Cinema, Shree Venkatesh Films and Bangla Talkies, steered by members of the film fraternity.

 So in Tollywood these days means Orkut, not ma!

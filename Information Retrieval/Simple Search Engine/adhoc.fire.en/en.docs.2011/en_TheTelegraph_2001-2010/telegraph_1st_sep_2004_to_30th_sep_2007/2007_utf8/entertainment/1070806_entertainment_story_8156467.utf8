The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Funny man

 Vir Das at The Park on Friday. Picture by Rashebehari Das

Stand-up comedian Vir Das went to the US to get a degree in economics and be an investment banker and ended up on stage. I took acting as an extra paper for a semester. But one of the professors told me that I must continue studying theatre. For the next three years, I did 45 plays with him, smiles Vir, who was in town on Friday.

 Straight enough story, but made immensely enjoyable when narrated by Vir. With him, you never quite know when he is serious or pulling a fast one. I was a dog-walker, a chemical loader at a paints factory, a construction painter, a door-to-door knife seller and a waiter at a comedy club, he says. Joking or serious? 

 Brand Vir

 To me stand-up comedy is all about telling the truth, but telling it in a humorous way. Stand-up is a form of comedy that is grounded in real life, he explains. The comedian also has to know how to play with words. The actor feels that after shows like The Great Indian Laughter Challenge, Indian audiences are a little more aware about stand-up comedy, but only some parts of it like characterisation or mimicry. Every comedian has his style. My style is anger, he reveals. 

 Sex, relationships, politics all work their way into Virs act. Not all of it is improvisation. Before every show, I spend about half-an-hour observing the audience from the wings, to feel their tenor. But about 50 per cent of it is carefully prepared and written down, he owns.

 The Indian connection

 So how did Vir shift continents with his funny act? I was home on a holiday and my parents asked me to do a show here. My first show was at the Habitat Centre at Delhi and we sold out, remembers Vir. Soon came his first TV show, Ek Rahin Vir, which was taken off air after a while. What was ahead of its time then has developed mass appeal now, and Vir has landed shows on leading satellite networks. 

 My shows are for the urban, English-speaking audience. Age is not a bar, he says. And he loves Calcutta. Calcutta might not be loud in its appreciation, but it is intelligent. It understands humour.

 Future perfect

 His cameo as one of Katrina Kaifs suitors in Namastey London might not be very well remembered, but Vir has more Bollywood up his sleeve. I am doing a Vikram Bhatt movie, Mumbai Salsa, where I play a hopeless romantic. It is a rom-com, but the comedy doesnt come from me, laughs Vir. The film, set to release in October, also stars Linda Arsenio, (from Kabul Express), Manjari Phadnis and others. Theatre today is often preachy, but Bollywood still has a story to tell, he feels. I have signed two other movies and am writing a book. It will be a compilation of comic essays, reveals Vir. I am also working on an album called Alien Rock, says the man who was once the lead singer of his college rock band.

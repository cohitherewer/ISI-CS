The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Khiladi Kumar

He doesnt pretend to be an intellectual and frankly admits, Reading is not my style but Akshay Kumar knows what book to buy wife Twinkle, a bookworm.

 He doesnt make boastful claims about being an intense actor and yet Akshay has stirred us with gut-wrenching films like Sangharsh and Khakee as well as soft, sensitive ones like Dhadkan and Humko Deewana Kar Gaye.

 His attention span when giving interviews is as little as that of the boy on the last bench in class, but Akshay delivers one-liners that make a journos day.

 When quizzed about his striptease scene in Heyy Babyy, he replies deadpan, It was a good break from item girl numbers.

 Dharmesh Darshan, who directed him in Dhadkan, once rightly said, Akshay has a nature intelligence that works in his favour. Its a gut-level sharpness that can score big in cinema.

 Deepa Mehta must have seen the same qualities in him when she signed him for Water, a touching tale on the widows of Benaras. Yes, the popularly labelled duh actor was her first choice for the role which John Abraham eventually did due to extraneous reasons. A role that had stimulated the actor so much that he actually read up matter on the social background of the period and employed a tutor to teach him Hindi as it was spoken in Benaras in the 1930s.

 It was Tanuja Chandras Sangharsh that was the turning point in the Khiladis career. I had a desire to experiment with roles, Akshay says. That is why I did a small role in Dil To Pagal Hai. Janwaar was a film I was deeply involved in. I used to feel emotionally drained after each days shooting.

 In Abbas-Mustans Aitraaz he empathised with his character to the extent that the normally word-thrifty actor held forth at length about the trauma of a married man being seduced by his bosss wife. To be stripped in court, thereafter, by ruthless questioning, with your wife sitting before you, is very humiliating, he said, echoing the feelings of numerous women rape victims.

 Ram of Dhadkan was very different, but equally strong. Dharmesh Darshan points out the difficulty of portraying the character, Ram was very manly without any traits of in-your-face masculinity but I felt that if I gave Akshay a detailing in character he would deliver.

 And deliver he did! Women adored the strong, understanding husband that Ram was, waiting patiently for his antagonistic wife to reciprocate his feelings.

 Doing a clutch of such films transformed the actors career graph. I developed a passion for sensitive roles, he reveals.

 Simultaneously, the action hero discovered he had a fantastic flair for comedy. He brought to this genre his own audacious touch and gave us side-splitting laughathons like Hera Pheri, Awara Paagal Deewana, Mujhse Shaadi Karoge, Garam Masala, Hera Pheri 2.... Slapstick, black comedy, intelligent comedy he did them all. Comedy is most appreciated when it is situational, especially if the situations are taken from everyday life. Slapstick works best when the situations are funny, he feels.

 Akshays latest film Heyy Babyy also has comic elements that work. The Akshay-Fardeen-Riteish interplay is one of the highlight of the Sajid Nadiadwala production. Director Sajid Khans film maybe loud and repetitive but its doing great business at the box office and that has a lot to do with Akshays presence and performance.

 After yet another hit, Akshay has quite a lot to look forward to. Akshay has Singh Is King produced by Vipul Shah, with whom he had earlier done Waqt and the delightful Namastey London; Welcome with Anees Bazmee; Nagesh Kukunoors next venture opposite Ayesha Takia...

 I am a greedy actor. I want to do action films next, says Akshay.

 Restless and easily bored perhaps thats the secret of Akshays evolution as a multi-faceted actor.

Keira Knightely: ldquo;I was completely 

 self-conscious about my body, but I love nude photographs. One way of getting over feeling inadequate is to go, lsquo;Sod it... and just do it rdquo; mdash; on her nude photoshoot for the Vanity Fair cover. The 22-year-old beauty has recently done a naked ad campaign for Coco Chanel, with a bowler hat covering her breasts

 Scarlett Johannson: ldquo;I rsquo;m proud of my breasts. I call them my girls. They rsquo;re my charms, my feminine wiles. I rsquo;m very comfortable with my sexuality, my body and my face. Well, not always my face, but it rsquo;s stuck there and there rsquo;s nothing I can do about it, rdquo; says Scarlett, who has vowed to strip for a movie and is waiting for the right role to come her way. But she did strip for the Vanity Fair cover with Keira

Angelina Jolie: ldquo;I talk a lot in the bath. It rsquo;s easier to talk when you rsquo;re naked...Get naked with me, and I rsquo;ll talk! rdquo;

 Eva Mendes: ldquo;They (the director and her costars) were very sweet and they poured me a vodka and orange juice and then I was fine, rdquo; says the coy actress on being coaxed to do her first nude scene with Joaquin Phoenix for her film We Own the Night

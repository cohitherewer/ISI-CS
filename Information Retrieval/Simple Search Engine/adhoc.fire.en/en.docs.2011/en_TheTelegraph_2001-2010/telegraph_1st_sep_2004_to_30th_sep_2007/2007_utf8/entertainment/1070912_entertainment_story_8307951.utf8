Rajeev Khandelwal

 Rajeev was magnetic as the intense Sujal in Kahiin To Hoga winning millions of hearts as he charmed women on screen and off.

Chetan Hansraj

 The shaggy, stubbled, sexy, green-eyed Chetan Hansraj (Sasha of Kahaani Ghar Ghar Kii). is the guy every girls parent would ask her to stay away from and therein lies his appeal. Every girl would want to pillion ride on his motorbike and hold on to his leather jacket (at the very least). His attitude and crooked ways leave the girls wanting more. Chetans the bad guy we love to hate. And the chicks just want to cha-cha with Sasha.

 Hunk Rating: Bad Boy Good

Ram Kapoor

 Intense eyes, commanding voice and authoritative demeanour combined with delicately rugged looks make him one of the hottest actors on TV. Ram isnt the conventional hunk, but its his personality that makes him awesome. Combine that with a sexy stubble and a mature look and you have the perfect recipe for the alternative hunk.

 Hunk Rating: Mr Personality

Iqbal Khan

 Made his deadly debut as a crooning rock star in Ektaa Kapoors Kaisa Yeh Pyaar Hai. With his rippling muscles and killer looks, girls would love to be protected by him. His sharp Kashmiri features and soft demeanour make girls go weak in their knees. This stud can make a majority of the TV-watching female population go Haan mujhe iqraar hai.

Shakti Anand

 Shakti (Ek Ladki Anjaani Si) is the conventional Indian poster boy, the chocolate boy hero. Shaktis characters have always been positive, accentuating his so-sweet image. He looks like the lost puppy that every girl would want to pet and pamper. Thats the shakti of this Shakti.

 Hunk Rating: The Lost Puppy

Shabbir Ahluwalia

 His broad shoulders, perfect pecs, his unshaven looks and high cheekbones make Shabbir Ahluwalia (Rishi from Kahiin To Hoga and Milind from Kayamath) a naughty fantasy. Smooth, good-looking and flirty, Shabbir is known for his impish charm and scruffy appeal. Shabbir Ahluwalia even has Ektaa Kapoor admitting that he is such a macho dude.

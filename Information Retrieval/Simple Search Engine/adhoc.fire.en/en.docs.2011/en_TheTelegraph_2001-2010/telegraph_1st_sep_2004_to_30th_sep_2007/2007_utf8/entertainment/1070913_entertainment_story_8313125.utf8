 Im not surprised you killed me with Steasl Assasin, he is SO imba! 

 Yeah, they should nerf him in the next version; hes way too good.

 No, we havent invented a language to torment our readers. Welcome to the world of gamers, where pwn is defeat and noobs are beginners. This rapidly developing hi-tech arena is taking the Indian and global market by storm. The Indian gaming market is estimated at over $10 million annually, and according to Computer Weekly magazine, gaming will overtake box office and music sales in a little more than half a decade! 

 Multi-player games and consoles such as the PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii, combined with increasing awareness, has set the gaming sector up to be one of the hottest new trends this year, feels Jinesh Shah, a finalist at the recent Reliance Inter-Webworld tournament in Calcutta.

 Zipping through fast lanes, defending ones team against dangerously armed terrorists, and fighting to gain control of your enemys base can all be easily experienced at home or at web cafes. In Calcutta, Sify and Reliance Web World centres offer the most popular games such as Counter-Strike, Need for Speed, Warcraft 3, Frozen Throne and Age of Empires 3. Calcutta is also home to two gaming cafes Tambam, located at 47/2 P Majumder Road and Cyberia at 6/1 S.N. Mukherjee Lane, that cater mainly to game enthusiasts. Equipment such as a headsets, mikes and joysticks are provided, and Tambam, a hub for local gamers, even conducts competitions in football, car racing and Counter-Strike. 

 At Reliance Web World, most games can be played for around 70p a minute. But the bills can add up. One hour seems like nothing when youre fighting for your life, metaphorically speaking, smiles Jinesh.

 The gaming community in Calcutta is growing, though it is still comparatively quite small. Theres plenty of room for growth. The gaming community here is relatively insignificant. One Korean or Chinese city would have more gamers than all of India, points out Debraj Bose, a top Warcraft player nationally. The numbers show that gamers are usually in the 15-35 age group, and are largely male.

 As a gamer, fast reflexes, intense practice sessions, experience and teamwork (for multi-player games) are musts for success at this sport.

 For the competitive gamer, Indian segments of international tournaments such as the World Cyber Games (WCG), the worlds largest gaming competition, and the Electronic Sports World Cup are held annually. Domestically, a Reliance tournament is held. 

 Jinesh Shah promises that this, fast-paced, adrenaline pumping experience will have even non-believers hooked once they get started. With talent, hard work, and a bit of luck, gaming can prove to be an exciting hobby, and even a career. But its not all fun and games. Gaming, especially on a competitive level, needs to be taken as seriously as any sport such as tennis or basketball, warns Debraj Bose. Gone are the days when computer games consisted of little dots on the screen that needed to be navigated home. Today, its a battlefield out there.

 Hey noob, what are you waiting for? Get your game on.

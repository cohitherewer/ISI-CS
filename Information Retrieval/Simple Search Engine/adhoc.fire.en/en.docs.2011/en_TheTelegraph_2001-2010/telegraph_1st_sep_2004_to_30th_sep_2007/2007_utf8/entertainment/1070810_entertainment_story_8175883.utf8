 SHAH RUKH KHAN in a Chak De chat.

 Shah Rukh Khan in Chak De India

 Rippling muscles and flowing hair. Its a whole new Shah Rukh Khan we meet in one corner the loaded recreation room of his Bandra bungalow, Mannat. Just before he rushes off to launch a new cola and hours before he flies off to London for the world premiere of Chak De India, SRK spoke to t2 about the film with a difference...

 This must be the first film (Chak De) in all these years where you do not have a leading lady

 I didnt have one in Darr, also. There I was trying to get myself a leading lady (laughs).... Yeah, there is no heroine as in no typical commercial heroine opposite me. If I discount the many special appearances I have done, this will perhaps be the first full-fledged film where I do not have a heroine.

 So you sacrificed heroine for hockey?

 I played hockey in school and I have not been able to play it on screen. I do not expect to use my economics study or science study to good use in films but then hockey was a great idea. Shimit (Amin) is a friend whom I have known for years. It was a completely different idea 16 girls, no heroine an honour (winning the womens hockey world cup) which is not popular a screenplay with no villain a look where there is no typical Shah Rukh Khan stylisation These are decisions I take every year. I do these films because I want to know these subjects before anyone else does and if I can pull it off as an actor I feel I can do this. Also it makes me enjoy the regular stuff I do every year. Okay, I have done that and now I will shift back to what I do best romance a girl.

 Which is tougher to do? 

 Aaaaahhh, I dont know. Loving 16 girls or loving one girl. Its a tough decision. I like romance because it comes naturally to me. As a character you sort of discover things that you may not have done earlier. When I am doing a song for Om Shanti Om, as I am shooting it, I know I have to do this, this way If I was to go and shoot a music video for Chak De as I did, I dont know how to do it. Its interesting as an actor to go out there, figure it out as an actor, do it and still dont know whether it works or not. It does make me nervous God have I done this ok?

 In recent years, you have been experimenting a lot with your looks

 (Laughs) Its not that. People say and think that I am very stylish. I am not. In fact, I remember someone asked me Are you metrosexual? I said if thats what its being called these days, okay Im metrosexual. I have no problem in whatever look a director gives me as long my pants dont come off. The Chak De look is entirely Shimit and Adis (Aditya Chopra) idea.

 In many ways Chak De is a feminist film...

 I am a believer in the cause of women but in a subtle manner. I believe women should be given equal opportunities. I have been surrounded by women all my life. Mother, sister, wife, daughter and my heroines I really feel they should be treated with a lot more respect and I respect them. I have a special soft corner for women. I like women.

 So what do Shah Rukh Khan fans expect when they go in to watch Chak De India?

 Aaaaaaaaaaa, its very difficult for me to say yaar. I didnt know what to expect when I saw the film for the first time. I would want everyone to see this film without any expectations. Lets go and see what this is about. A lot of people may get disappointed not seeing me as I am normally. But I think there will be a set of people who will feel its good. Its shot very well. Its got some lovely moments. Its got lovely acting by a lot of people. Its patriotic. Inshallah people should go in to watch different people and just find a regular star in it. It would be nice if they come out wanting to play hockey.

 (Will you watch Chak De India for hero or hockey?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Instant karmas got him

 Euphoria frontman Palash Sen will return to the doctor rsquo;s chamber the day his band stops performing.

He came, he sang, he conquered. Looking dapper as always, Euphoria frontman Palash Sen kicked up a storm at The Rotary Youth Awards, organised by Rotary International District 3290, held at Bharatiyam on Saturday. The Dhoom Pichuck man belted out some of Euphorias greatest hits, including Maaeri and Soniye. He was also made an honorary Rotarian on the occasion. Excerpts from his chat with t2: 

 What have you been up to of late?

 I just completed a film called Mumbai Ten, where I play the lead role. The film, directed by Manish Jha, is pretty offbeat. It is based on the Mumbai floods. It is the story of two people. The background score is by Euphoria. You have to check out the album to know what the songs are like (smiles). We are also doing a couple of songs for a film directed by Kitu Ghosh. The next Euphoria album will be released in July-August 2008. I have been travelling quite a lot for concerts. 

 What has the Bollywood experience been like?

 I am not a part of it. I am not fond of the Mumbai film industry. There is too much nepotism. Manish, with whom I have just completed Mumbai Ten, is an experimental filmmaker. So, you see, I am on the fringe. 

 On Hindi bands

 Music should be in a form which people understand. A band like Jal may not be so great, but the reason they are so popular in India is that they can sing in Hindi.

 Any plans to go solo

 No way! Id feel very low if I go solo.

 Your most memorable gig?

 Every Euphoria gig is memorable!

 If Euphoria ever stops playing, where will you plan your comeback concert?

 If Euphoria ever stops playing, Ill pack my bags and go back to the doctors chamber. If, however, I ever plan a comeback concert, itll be in Calcutta. 

 What remains your first preference the stage or the studio?

 The stage, most definitely. Performing live is like instant karma. You immediately get to know whether people like you or not. 

 Given a chance you would like to jam with...

 Britney Spears, Shakira, Beyonce

 Who remains your favourite musician from Calcutta?

 Gautam Chattopadhyay (of Mohiner Ghoraguli).

 On reality talent hunt shows

 I think these are great platforms. I was the Principal on Fame-X. The only thing that is not so nice is that the contestants dont know whats going to happen next.

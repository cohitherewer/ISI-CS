 Beauty goes hi-tech

 Rekha and (top) Madhuri Dixit: Is beauty more than skin deep?

 Beauty used to be the product of grandmothers secret Multani mitti formula, vitamin A-rich carrots and sandalwood face-packs. But now you can leave all these, and the much-used contents of every kitchen, alone. Instead, head to hi-tech clinics for non-surgical beauty procedures that promise to leave you looking young and flawless.

 Eye Allure

 Correcting eye vision through laser treatment is fast gaining ground. Many people dont want to wear glasses. Lasik corrects vision through laser treatments and does away with glasses. We treat at least 40-50 cases with laser treatment every month, says Divyesh Shah, eye catalyst, Himalaya Vision Care Centre, Rashbehari Avenue.

 Lasik surgery costs around Rs 26,000 for both eyes. It has become popular with couples gearing up for weddings, those unable to wear contacts because of very high power, and those with anisometropia (in which the two eyes have an unequal refractive power). Foreigners are also good customers, coming to India for cheap treatment. In the initial years, more women would come, but men now come in equal numbers, adds Shah.

 But not everybody is eligible for Lasik. We reject 20-30 per cent cases because of complications like corneal thickness, observes Shah.

 The procedure involves a hi-tech machine like Zyoptics, the latest in eye corrective surgery from the US.

 While the surgery itself is painless, some discomfort may be experienced for two-three hours, after which you will feel almost normal. Do not rub eyes, swim or splash water for six weeks after surgery. Patients are advised to apply drops post treatment.

 Big on Botox

 Botox is the beauty biggie of the season because it has fast and dramatic results, is relatively painless, and apparently has no side effects.

 It removes wrinkles, fine lines and softens the face. It is almost like a soft-focus photo. Many people acquire a frowning look and Botox helps get rid of that, says Sanjay Agarwal, skin specialist and cosmetologist, Cosmetic and Laser Clinic, CMRI. In the UK, Botox has spilled over from celebrities to the common man. In India, this will take some time because it is expensive and there is a shortage of trained people, he explains. Botox treatment for a 35-40 year-old woman would cost approximately Rs 8,000-10,000, with the effects lasting for six-eight months. Results are satisfactory in over 95 per cent cases, they say.

 Skin Saga 

 If your skin is hungry, try a lunchtime procedure. Thats what non-surgical cosmetic procedures like micro-dermabrasion and chemical peels are being called. They hardly consume time and working women can drop in before lunch and rejoin work in the afternoon, just like a trip to the salon, says Agarwal.

 These techniques reduce blemishes, blackheads, sunspots, pigmentation and give a rejuvenated glow just like after a long holiday! Micro-dermabrasion uses a machine with a vacuum. It pushes aluminium-oxide crystals so that the skin breaks. The dead skin is sucked up by the vacuum, says Agarwal.

 Chemical peels come in bottles and exfoliate the skin or remove dead cells. The peel is painted on with a paintbrush and the depth of the peel depends on the severity of the problem.

 Indian women should opt for superficial peels and those who are really brave could try peels of medium strength. Deep peels are best avoided on Indian skin because of sensitivity and colour, stresses Agarwal.

 A treatment in the face region costs Rs 500-600; the average patient requires four-five sessions. For micro-dermabrasion/ chemical peels, avoid direct sun contact. Use sunscreen and moisturiser.

 Hair Bare 

 Hair reduction is one of the most popular hi-tech beauty treatments. It started with threading, waxing and depilatory creams till technology took over with electrolysis. After which came laser hair reduction.

 The advent of technology in dermatology has helped treatment in a positive way, both for healing and beauty, says Piyali Chatterjee, medical co-ordinator, eastern region, Kaya Skin Clinic.

 Indian women have more hair on their body. And men have started going for the bare look, too. Laser is equally popular amongst men, especially those who have thick beards that grow up to their noses, she adds.

 Upper lip hair reduction for women would cost around Rs 6,500. In time to come, it will become as cheap as threading, feels Agarwal. Around 40 per cent of Kayas clients opt for hair reduction.

 Trendspot

 Non-surgical methods of fat-reduction through ultra-sound and radio-frequency waves are the next big thing you can expect in a few years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Canada call

 Calcutta boy Shayne Hyrapiet is 

 all set to perform his original songs for the first time 

 at the weeklong 2007 World Anglo-Indian Reunion at Toronto, 

 starting August 12. 

 Shayne, whose father is Armenian and mother Anglo-Indian, is the only Anglo-Indian representing eastern India at the multi-cultural extravaganza of song, dance and comedy at the Living Arts Centre. 

 But for the 20-something singer who has shared the stage with Atif Aslam, Shaan, Stereo Nation, Jal, Usha Uthup, Bombay Vikings and KK, performing abroad isnt new. Having wowed audiences in the US, Switzerland, Bangkok, Dhaka and Bhutan, Shayne is confident of making a mark when hes next on stage on August 14. This will be the ideal platform to present my songs My Greatest Friends and Afterwards in front of a foreign audience. I hope to tap into the market in Canada, says Shayne. He will also perform some vintage rockroll (mostly Elvis and Beatles), Hindi numbers (Om shaanti om and Tum kya jano) and some peppy Punjabi music. There is also talk of Canadian-Indian stand-up comedian Russell Peters performing at the reunion. Ask Shayne to describe his brand of music and he says: High-energy, fun and minimal audience distraction!

 Masked amp; anonymous

 Sex amp; the city 

 Unknown authors make Chandrima S. Bhattacharya wonder about their influences on our lives

I was thinking the other day of the influence Anonymous has had on my life. Its not that I noticed him before the third or fourth grade, when I think I came across the first poems written by him. At poetry contests, there would invariably be some offerings by Anonymous. But these were instances in which the man was credited for his works. 

 There were so many of his creations that held me absolutely in thrall since very early. My childhood would have been impossible without him. The first rhyme (though, I believe, its not a canonical one) that I learnt was: Miss Molly had a dolly/ Who was sick, sick, sick/ So she called for the doctor and/ Asked him to be quick, quick, quick. This, to the immense pleasure of spectators all around me, I would perform with the aid of a plastic doctors set, to the accompaniment of action. I am sure this early act of mine goes a long way towards explaining the many strange things that I went on to do later in life, but I was actively encouraged into the nursery rhyme by my teachers and family. 

 I am also quite sure that I am not alone in this. What would Bengali childhood be without the informing presence of English nursery rhymes, all written by the said Anonymous? How many of us have not had to also recite Baa Baa Black Sheep, Have you any wool? with a shake of the head and a thrust of the three fingers? How many of us have not felt bewildered by Humpty Dumptys fate? What had he done to deserve such a fate, breaking into such small pieces? Was he an instrument of Evil punished ruthlessly by the Unseen Hand? And Little Miss Muffet? Her trauma was ours. It was only later that we realised that the spider was really a metaphor of a virulent masculine sexuality breaking into the blameless world of a small virgin and not just a spider. The stories of Cinderella, of The Beauty and the Beast and Little Red Riding Hood all these had deep political meanings, Little Red Riding Hood being an elaboration of the Miss Muffet plot, which is why they all had such a powerful grip on young minds. Anonymous was quite scary. 

 But when it came to Bengali, except the alphabet rhymes that started with -e Ojogor, most rhymes and poetry and fairy tales that I read in my childhood could have been traced to names, mostly to Tagore. From Sahaj Path to Birpurush, that most inspiring poem about how a child defends his mother on a most perilous journey and I became him, of course almost everything that I read and loved in Bengali as a child was written by Tagore. Even Thakumar Jhuli was attributed to an author with a long, difficult name Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumdar and I would have a tough time trying to match his portrait in the book with the picture that I had of my grandmothers. And the ancient rhymes that we heard Aye aye chandmama or Dol dol duluni were not really childrens; they were meant for elders to sing to children. 

 Hardly anything was anonymous. Maybe because the anonymous author of the Indian languages was busy with bigger things like collaborating on the epics. He was really into the adult imagination. For though Ramayana and Mahabharata are attributed to the sages Valmiki and Ved Vyas respectively, there is a suspicion that many, many unnamed other people wrote it. As they wrote some of the other biggest works of literature in the world: The Bible and The Arabian Nights. 

 The tradition continues in Bengali. There is a piece called Mahayana, which is still being written and available in different versions. Originating in a Calcutta campus, which, no one is quite sure about, Mahayana is a collection of Bengali shlokas, brilliant takes on the underground lives of the Ramayana and Mahabharata characters. But not one can be published as they are very subversive and somewhat unprintable. 

 However, after Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag, Ram Gopal Varma must be wishing he was Anonymous. But its difficult to hide such a long name and a swollen head.

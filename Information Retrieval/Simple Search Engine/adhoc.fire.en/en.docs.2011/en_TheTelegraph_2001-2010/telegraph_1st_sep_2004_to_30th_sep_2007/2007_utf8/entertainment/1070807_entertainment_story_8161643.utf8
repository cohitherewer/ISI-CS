The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Reel amp; ramp

 Four shows in last seasons fashion weeks and two more coming up this season. Plus, so many film assignments. What do you think about your crossover from films to fashion? 

 According to me there is no difference between designing for films and for the mainstream. I am a designer, so creatively it is the same. The only difference is the medium. Also, the models are different. On one platform, an actor or actress wears my design, and the other platform caters to people next door via the runway model. So clearly, the movies-mainstream divide is overrated. Too much is made out of it. Everyone wants to do everything. Costume designers are trying mainstream and mainstream designers all hide a burning desire to be part of Bollywood whether they admit it or not!

 Youre participating in both Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week and Lakme Fashion Week. How do you manage? 

 It is crazy. But not as crazy as last season when I juggled four! Actually I got one show in each of the fashion weeks, plus both the sponsor shows. It was too hectic and then somewhere quality does suffer. I am more organised this time. The theme of the first show in Delhi will be Earth, because we all come back to earth in a way. There will be lots of cream, beige and gold. The Mumbai show will be typical Indian kitsch. I havent begun work on that collection yet! 

 Youve brought a fashion line for men to Calcutta. But the mens fashion scene is nowhere compared to the West, which has dedicated fashion weeks to man style. Why the gap?

 Its not like men dont want to experiment with style. Men here are not given enough to experiment with. If you dont supply, there will be no demand. Slowly they are ready to play with colours and cuts. But then again, there is so much you can do for womens fashion and only that much you can do for men

 What do you enjoy more? Men or women 

 Women! Like I said, theres only that much you can do with men.

 Film direction is where youre heading next. What can we expect? 

 Contrary to what people might think, let me first clarify that my film is not about fashion. Yes, visually it will be very glossy and overall it will be a very good-looking film, but it is not centred round the fashion frat. It portrays the relationship between two women. Im still writing the script.

 And which two of your actress buddies get to play the lead roles?

 (Smiles) Yes, I do have many actress buddies and itll be a tough choice! Thankfully, my film will be able to accommodate two of them instead of only one! The roles are performance-oriented so Ill take a call once the script is ready. 

 And who is your muse? 

 That would be Priyanka Chopra. Four of her best films Mujhse Shaadi Karogi, Aitraaz, Waqt and Salaam-e-Ishq were with me. She has a great body and a terrific sense of style.

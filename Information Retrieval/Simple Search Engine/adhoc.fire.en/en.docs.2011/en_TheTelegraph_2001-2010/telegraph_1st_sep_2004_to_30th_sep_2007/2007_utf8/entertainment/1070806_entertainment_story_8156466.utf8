In town on Friday for the launch of Flying Cats, an airhostess training school, Neha Dhupia was perfectly poised answering questions about her future projects, the importance of good grooming and her journey from top model to Bollywood actress. 

 Posing in a black dress with an eye-catching neckpiece, she was candid, articulate and quite the star as she smiled and posed for shutterbugs. Heres what she had to say to t2: 

 On flying right

 I have been associated with Flying Cats for a long time now. There are many institutes everywhere and they are very important because of the boom in the aviation industry. These institutes groom the girls and boys in the right direction, instilling in them all the skills required for this services-oriented industry. I personally am not fond of flying and this morning, I was quite scared when there was some turbulence during my flight. However, the airhostess with her reassuring smile made me feel better at once! 

 On moving from beauty queen to screen

 Ive come a long way and still have a long way to go. All I can say is that it has been a wonderful journey with all the people Ive met, all the places Ive been to and all the luxuries Ive had. I feel thankful for all the attention or the lack of it and love being a part of the Indian film industry. 

 On the kind of roles she wants to take up in the future:

 You know its no fun being an actor if its the same thing thats being done all the time. Ive still not entirely understood what Im good at and I need to tap the different genres to be able to figure this out and that is why I am trying to experiment with different kinds of cinema. 

 Her roll roster

 My next release is Mithya, directed by Rajat Kapoor, co-starring Naseeruddin Shah and Ranvir Shorey. It was screened at the Osian Film Festival and was pretty well received. Other projects in the pipeline are Dus Kahaaniyan, which has an ensemble cast and 10 separate stories directed by different people; I M 24, which is about a 42-year-old mans struggle to get the woman of his dreams by pretending to be 24; and Kuch Love Kuch Drama.

 Working wish-list

 I have a long list of directors I would like to work with, from Mani Ratnam to Rajat Kapoor to Sudhir Mishra to Anurag Kashyap and, of course, Karan Johar, who is every girls dream director! As far as actors are concerned, I really want to work with Shah Rukh Khan as Im a big, big fan.

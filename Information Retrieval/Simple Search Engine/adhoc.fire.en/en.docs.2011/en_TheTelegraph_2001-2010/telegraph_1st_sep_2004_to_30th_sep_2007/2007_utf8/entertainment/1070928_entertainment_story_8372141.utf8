 Tales of trafficking

 SOLD, the lead feature of the MTV EXIT campaign in South Asia, is a powerful programme aiming to raise awareness about and help prevention of human trafficking. 

 Bollywood actress Lara Dutta (left) is one among many international artistes who have joined the MTV EXIT campaign and will present the documentary. 

 SOLD features the real life stories of people in South Asia connected with the trafficking issue. These include victims like Pramila, a 17-year-old girl from Nepal who was trafficked into a brothel in Delhi, Afsana, who was trafficked from Bangladesh and forced to work as a domestic in Calcutta, and Zakir, who was just 11 when he was trafficked from Uttar Pradesh into a zari factory in Mumbai by his aunt. 

 Their harrowing stories are told alongside other people in the trafficking chain including Shravan who used to pick up young girls from railway stations to force them into prostitution. Then there rsquo;s a young man from Mumbai whose friends pay for sex and Mohammad, a zari factory owner, who has seen factory owners exploit trafficking victims. 

 Ashok and Shwetank are on the other side of the fence mdash; they help rescue victims of trafficking. You can also meet Geeta, a survivor of trafficking who now works as a Border Patrol guard on the Indo-Nepal border looking out for traffickers and potential victims.

 Finally there rsquo;s Bhuwan, a passionate lawyer who hopes to see the end of child labour and trafficking in his lifetime.

 Catch SOLD on MTV today (Friday) at 11pm.

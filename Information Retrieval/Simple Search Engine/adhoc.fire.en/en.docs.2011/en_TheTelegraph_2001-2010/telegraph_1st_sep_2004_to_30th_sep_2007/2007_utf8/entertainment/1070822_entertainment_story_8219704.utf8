 One tight slap

 Esha Deol, while shooting for a scene in her upcoming movie Darling, produced by T-Series and directed by Ram Gopal Varma, gave co-star Zakir Hussain one tight slap.

 It was fortunately just part of a scene in the Fardeen Khan movie, set in a hospital. But Esha, whos heavily into gymming these days, was in peak form and slapped Zakir so hard that it practically shook the man up!

 Zakir, who is known for intense performances (Sarkar, Darwaza Bandh Rakho), did not flinch, took it in his stride and got ready for the next scene. When the shot was over and Esha realised what she had done, she was all apologies, which the actor graciously accepted. He didnt have much of a choice really because a retake would have meant another stinging slap from the Dharam putri!

 Nobel praise for Gandhi

 Nadine Gordimer, the South African writer who won the 1991 Nobel Prize for literature, has been touched by Gandhi My Father. In a letter to the director, Feroz Khan, Gordimer writes: ldquo;A groundbreaking film in its originality and boldness. No one before in cinema has tackled like this one of the most difficult of human emotional situations: what it means to be the son of a great man for whom the cause of freedom of his people inevitably comes before freedom of a son to choose his own way of life divergent from political urgency. A beautiful achievement combining recognition of greatness and tragedy. rdquo;

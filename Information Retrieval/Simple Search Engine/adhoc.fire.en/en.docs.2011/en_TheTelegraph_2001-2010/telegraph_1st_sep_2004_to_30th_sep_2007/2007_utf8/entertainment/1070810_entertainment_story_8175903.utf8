 On Guard!

 If the gleam of swords in action flicks has always brought a shine to your eyes, fencing might just be the thing for you

 Antonio Banderas in the Mask of Zorro is every sword-lover rsquo;s hero 

Growing up, our dreams of becoming one of the three musketeers, acquiring Luke Skywalkers prowess with the lightsaber, or even fighting Zorros romantic battles have slowly faded away. Toy swords get dumped at the back of the closet, cricket bats and tennis racquets take over. 

 But you can wield a sword with skill, grace and safety. Today, fencing the art of sword fighting is an internationally recognised sport. Not only is it rich in tradition, it faces an increasingly bright future, with a steadily rising number of countries participating in global events every year. 

 To the layman, dressing in white padded suits and attacking opponents may seem a bizarre way to spend time, requiring little athletic ability and even less intellect. But fencing is about self-control; it is a sport in which decision-making, rather than instinct, is imperative; and a combination of mental and physical strength is needed to overcome an opponent, not just brute force. A strenuous activity that develops endurance, flexibility and grace, this sport also helps one develop clear thinking and better problem-solving skills.

 The basic equipment is easily acquired at a price of Rs 5,000-8,000 per set. This includes practice swords, a fencing glove, mask, jacket, chest protectors, pants and shoes. If you are unsure about your long-term interest in the sport, the Bengal Fencing Association can provide equipment to get you started. (You can contact the BFA at 84 Sarsuna Main Road, phone : 9830127885.)

 Once you do decide to take up fencing in earnest, the type of sword you choose is important. The three types of Olympic swords used are the foil, a light thrusting weapon with a target area restricted to the torso; the epee, a heavier thrusting weapon with a target area covering the entire body; and the sabre, a light cutting and thrusting weapon which includes a target area of almost everything above the waist.

 The first steps are learning the rules such as right of way and how to use your feet and hands. Mastering simple attacks and defensive moves like the lunge and parry, combined with intensive practice drills will make you duel-worthy in no time. Success in fencing goes to the skillful rather than to the aggressive. You can choose your sword according to your body type and natural traits. Height and a long reach help with the epee, while being small or thin makes it harder for people to attack when playing with the foil, which has a chest-only target. Speed, fitness, strength, dexterity, concentration and a level head can all be used to ones advantage. 

 Currently, Bengal is lagging behind other states such as Punjab, Manipur and Karnataka in the field of fencing. The BFA has just returned from the Federation Cup, where the top eight teams in India participate. The BFA ranked seventh.

 Pradeep Kumar Das, joint secretary of the Bengal Fencing Association, attributes the teams loss to the fact that swords are traditional to the culture and sports of states such as Manipur and Punjab, while the art of sword fighting is new to Bengal. S. Pande, senior player at the BFA, believes lack of electronic equipment hinders Bengal fencers as practice equipment differs greatly from the actual equipment used in competitions. 

 But dont be disheartened. Even if you arent thinking of taking up the sport at a competitive level, the exhilaration of facing an opponent and the satisfaction of the sword tip finding its target is unbeatable.

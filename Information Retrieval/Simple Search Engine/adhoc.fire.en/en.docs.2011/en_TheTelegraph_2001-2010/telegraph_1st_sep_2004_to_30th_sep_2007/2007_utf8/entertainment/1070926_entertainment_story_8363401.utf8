 The lonely lady

 Locket and Gargi at the launch of Krishnakali... Picture by Aranya Sen

After Arjun Chakrabortys big-screen venture Tolly Lights, here comes the small screens take on tinsel town. ETV Banglas Krishnakali Tarei Boli is about the colourful world of movies with an estranged couple on centre stage. 

 Gargi Roy Chowdhury plays the lonely wife Krishnakali whose husband (Shankar Chakraborty) is a famous film-maker. Their home is shattered when Krishnakali discovers her husbands dalliance with upcoming actress Swarnali (Rupa Bhattacharya). A wounded Krishnakali walks out on her husband. 

 I am very excited about the role. It has been properly fleshed out. Although mega serials take up a lot of time, I have learnt to juggle work and home with ease, says Gargi. 

 Rupa, too, is excited about playing a wannabe filmstar. I have been doing a lot of negative characters recently, but this one is different. Swarnali is a very interesting woman. She is smart and independent. The character will give me a lot of scope to experiment, she says. 

 The serial also features Locket Chatterjee as a former actress and Sanjib Dasgupta as her failed director-husband. Directed by Anindya Sarkar and Prasenjit Roy, Krishnakali Tarei Boli begins on October 1, to be aired Monday to Saturday, at 7pm.

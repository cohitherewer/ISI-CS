 Juggling Jai amp; Raj

 PRASHANT RAJ claims he is not nervous about being compared to Amitabh.

He is the only debutant in Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag. As Raj (not Jai), Prashant Raj sure has large shoes to fill. Heres his take on this Fridays release and on his playing Amitabh Bachchans role...

 How did you land the role?

 Im originally from Delhi. I began as a model, and was the first runner-up at Grasim Mr India. I was moving to LA to pursue my modelling career when suddenly I got a call from RGVs office. When I met Ramuji for the first time he just kept staring at his laptop. He asked me a couple of questions about acting and told me to do an audition.

 How did the audition go?

 I couldnt see myself going out and breaking into a dialogue. I just looked into Ramujis eyes and said, Main yahan aapka ya apna time waste karne nahin aaya. I was totally candid. After saying that, I did not know what would follow. I thought I might be thrown out of the office.

 What was your reaction when you came to know that you had been selected?

 I was flummoxed. Ramuji gave me the script and told me to come prepared the next day. I asked him to give me an extra day to prepare. I reached home, practised in front of the mirror, and worked on my look.

 You didnt grab the DVD of Sholay?

 No I didnt. I did not watch the film till I had signed the movie. And it helped because it gave me an opportunity to approach the character from my perspective.

 What was the toughest call whilst shooting?

 I was told to look at a leaf, imagine it was Ajay Devgan, and talk to him. Arre, how can I talk to a leaf?

 In Sholay, Jai is an intense guy. How different is your character from him?

 My character Raj is a very modern guy. Hes a bit serious, sensitive and restrained. He respects women. Sushmita is a widow, who is older to him. He develops feelings for her, which she reciprocates. This will be established through our conversation in the movie. In Sholay, there was no conversation between the two (Jai and Radha).

 Jai and Veeru enacted one of the immortal friendships on screen. Will Raj and Heeros relationship in Aag be like that?

 In Sholay, the interaction between Jai and Veeru was one-on-one. They were friends but here Im playing a character younger to Ajay. Hes protective about me and takes care of me like an elder brother because I have lost my family at a very young age. In real life too, Ajay took me under his wing. We would lunch together. He also took me to his gym.

 In Sholay, Jai was played by Amitabh Bachchan. There are bound to be comparisons. Are you nervous?

 No, Im not. Sholay was set against a rural backdrop whereas Aag is placed in an urban setting.

 Did the original Jai give any inputs to Raj?

 No, he never intervened. Hes really a directors actor. If we had a scene together, he would give me suggestions; but otherwise, he wouldnt go out of the way to tell me how I should act out a scene. He was very involved with his own character. Guys, if you think that I didnt play Jais role properly, blame Mr Bachchan because hes the original Jai (laughs).

 How was your interaction with Sushmita?

 I was far more nervous about meeting her than I was about meeting Mr Bachchan. Sushmita is a very strong woman, a womans woman. She has a powerful aura she can walk into a room and just light it up. When I met her on the sets for the first time, I was dumbstruck. She came up to me, introduced herself, gave me a huge hug and put me at ease in a second.

 What was the best compliment you received while shooting?

 I was doing a scene with Sushmita. The moment we shot it, RGV announced on the mike that it was an awesome shot. Ramuji had been sceptical about me being able to pull off the scene but I did it in my own style. At another time, I did an action scene after which the entire crew clapped. I was elated.

 Were you ever ticked off on the sets?

 Quite a few times; but it was not because of my performance. I got late for the shoot twice.

 So whats next?

 I just completed shooting for my second film. Its called Toss. And no, its not being made by Ram Gopal Varma!

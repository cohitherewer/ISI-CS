 Moumita Saha 

- Homemaker

 Moumita Saha rsquo;s mother realised early on that her daughter had a knack for cooking. After graduation, when her mom was away for a while, Moumita mastered the nuances of cooking full time. Today Moumita, 31, ldquo;loves eating and loves treating people to food she cooks rdquo;.

 Married for the past five years, this multi-tasker balances homemaking and work for an NGO with ease. Moumita rsquo;s father-in-law is a great encouragement. ldquo;He often picks up tips and recipes and passes them on to me. My husband too is great help. When responsibilities are shared, a kitchen job is fun, rdquo; she feels. Her tip for reluctant cooks? ldquo;Cooking is easy. It does not take time if the ingredients are ready. rdquo;

 Shaina NC will be back in town 

 this weekend. After a gap of five years, the sari specialist 

 is travelling with an exhibition to Calcutta a market 

 that you can no longer ignore. t2 caught up 

 with the Mumbai-based designer for a quick chat...

 Youre coming to Calcutta 

 after so long

 Yes, and I am really looking forward 

 to my trip. My exhibition will be held at 85 Lansdowne on 

 Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The collection is typically 

 Shaina NC concept saris, detachable borders, interesting 

 drapes and pre-pleated pieces all in a heady mix of colours. 

 Fashion designer and BJP spokesperson 

 for Maharashtra. How? Why?

 I joined politics three years 

 ago and people who know me werent surprised at all. 

 I studied political science and law and it was all sorted 

 out from the beginning. Fashion is my profession, my bread 

 and butter, and politics is my passion. The NC in my name 

 can also be interpreted as Non Corruptible! When I joined 

 the party in 2004, I was not interested in just a fancy 

 stint. I fought elections within a week of joining and since 

 then my focus has been to make a tangible difference to 

 society. I also work with Cancer Patients Aid Association 

 and always try to merge fashion with a cause. Its 

 also true that most men come to ogle at women during fashion 

 shows, but even if five per cent go back home with a message, 

 I feel that my mission is accomplished. 

 So you must have an amazing 

 time-management secret? 

 Oh yes. There are millions of 

 things that need to be done every day. My advice to all 

 of you who want to manage time effectively is to segregate 

 what you want to do. Surely there will be constant guilt 

 about not giving enough time to family, but once you fix 

 your priorities and balance your routine, everything will 

 fall into place.

 Coming back to fashion, one 

 school of thought feels that saris have hit a slump

 According to me, its all 

 about a mindset. Yes, there are some people who think wearing 

 saris is cumbersome but for them too there is a solution 

 wear a pre-pleated sari! Saris are forever fashionable. 

 But its sad when it takes a Liz Hurley to wear a Jaipur 

 bandhni to remind us exactly how stunning a sari 

 really is. 

 Which saris are must-haves 

 for a young womans wardrobe?

 A black chiffon sari is the ultimate 

 in seduction. Wear it with any accessory and it looks beautiful. 

 A woman must also have a Benarasi weave for traditional 

 functions. The third must-have is a line of simple cotton 

 saris. Dress them up with chunky silver jewellery. Every 

 girl must also possess a few embroidered saris, threadwork 

 or sequins. But make sure they are lightweight and easy 

 to handle. Always pay special attention to sari blouses. 

 Make them fun, interesting and well fitted.

 Handling a sari is another 

 battle that our generation is fighting. Any expert tips?

 Here are some pointers that will ensure a non-clumsy 

 sari stint: 

 Make sure the pleats are well-fixed. 

 Stay away from satin petticoats. Stick to lizzy-bizzy 

 (cotton).

 Fall on saris are passe. Most modern saris dont 

 need a fall. The border is heavy enough.

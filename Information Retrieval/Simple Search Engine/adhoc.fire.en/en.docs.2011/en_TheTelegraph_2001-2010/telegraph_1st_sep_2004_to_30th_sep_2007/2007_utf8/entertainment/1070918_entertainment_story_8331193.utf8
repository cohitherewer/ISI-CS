 Calcutta Medical College (CMC)s annual fest Rhapsody 2007, in association with t2, saw medical students combining headbanging, dancing and singing with social awareness and health drives to set the event apart from the regular festivals.

 From September 11 to 14, the College Street campus was swinging in sync with the spirit of a medical school, with the students participating in a pre-clinical and medical quiz which tested them on their knowledge of physics, chemistry, biology, aspects of their syllabus as well as medicine in general.

 The AIDS seminar on September 12 had doctors and students making presentations on prevention and control of the disease. Through the day, HIV-AIDS awareness was promoted with ribbons and pamphlets being handed out among the students. The AIDS seminar was especially important because it was promoting an important social and health issue and is quite unlike the kind of events that usually happen at fests, said Jyotirmoy Ghanta, one of the third-year student organisers.

 Other events included a fashion show of ethnic wear called Colours of India; Antakshari, a battle of bands, Eastern solo, medley and a debate on the motion Education system produced learners or earners. One of the special events was a contest called Made For Each Other, with couples being quizzed on their partners and taking part in paper-dancing and cola-drinking competitions. 

 The evenings saw rocking performances by bands like Insomnia, Fossils and Lakkhichhara, with much energetic headbanging being the perfect conclusion to the days activities.

 This is the 61st year of the fest and there has been an overwhelming response, not only from the students but also from other colleges. There were more than 750 people on the day of the Fossils concert and many had to be turned away because the venue was overcrowded, said Aveek Mukherjee, a third-year student.

 For hardworking medical students, these four days provided the perfect excuse to unwind. As third-year student organisers, we are extremely proud of being able to do something for our college and its students. Theres a great sense of satisfaction in seeing everyone enjoying themselves as these four days offer a welcome break from all the academic pressure and hectic schedules, concluded Ghanta, pleased at the fabulous turnout and student response to Rhapsody 2007.

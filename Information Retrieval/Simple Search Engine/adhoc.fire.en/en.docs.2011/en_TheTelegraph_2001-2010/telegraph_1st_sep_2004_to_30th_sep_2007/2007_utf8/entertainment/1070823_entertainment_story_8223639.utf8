The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Here comes the king

 - Naseeruddin Shah wears the crown in a Greek tragedy

 He has delved deep into Saadat 

 Hasan Manto and Ismat Chugtai for the past couple of years. 

 Now, Naseeruddin Shah is all set to revive 

 a Greek tragedy Sophocless Antigone for 

 his group Motley. A chat with t2.

 What is your role in 

 Antigone?

 Im playing Creon. Creon, the king.

 Is it challenging enough?

 For me, every role that I choose to play, be it on stage or on screen, is a sort of challenge. Creon is no different. 

 Why have you chosen Antigone? 

 My understanding of Antigone is limited to money and power. The play is about what money and extreme power do to a man and how he is left alone in playing the game. The issues that the king deals with are still very relevant. That is how I perceive my role, the rest depends on the director Satyadev Dubey. That way its much easier.

 Will the play be a period 

 piece?

 No, Satyadev has edited the plot considerably. But in doing that he has not lent a contemporary feel to it. The costumes in the play will be very interesting. It is nothing like the Greek costumes but somewhat abstract. Its between Indian and Greek. We have decided on a designer; if he does the costumes it will be a bonus for us. 

 Does theatre improve 

 an actor?

 Yes, it certainly does. You cannot afford to go wrong on stage. There are no retakes.

 Will you come to Calcutta 

 with the play?

 Im waiting for an invitation!

 Die of disgust

 Buddha Mar Gaya

Crude wouldnt be such a rude word if used to describe Rahul Rawails appaling black comedy thats what the opening credits proclaim called Buddha Mar Gaya. As the credits start to roll along with the title song, and a motley crowd dances around a dead body, the warning youll die laughing soon proves to be most misleading.

 It is more like dying of shock when you see actors like Om Puri, Anupam Kher and Paresh Rawal making such an ass of themselves on screen.

 The story is about a multi-millionaire businessman Anupam Kher whose family (sons, daughters-in-law, sister and her paramour, grandchildren) would love to see him dead. And he dies, without much ado, in the very first scene, while on top of a struggling actress (Rakhi Sawant, of course). Reason enough to all his family members to go berserk each trying to hide the dead body to cash in on the corpse.

 Rawails interpretation of a black comedy is grotesque. All the characters are greedy, vulgar, cruel and complete sex maniacs. Together, they turn the cinema hall into a torture chamber.

Rawail uses visual innuendo like a rocket launch or a dripping injection to highlight Rakhis deadly sexual antics. Risque Rakhi is deadly, literally, as everyone who clambers into bed with her must die.

 And then theres a grand-daughter who suddenly decides to shed her inhibitions and clothes in front of Prem Chopra all to try and convince the bald old man that she has what it takes to be an item girl.

 But the worst act of all is godman Om Puris whether dancing topless draped in a sari or making out with both aunt Mohbanoo and nephew Mukesh. Eeew! And if you still havent fled the hall, you will be subjected to the sight of mutilated parts of the dead Buddhas body.

 With such vulgarity on show, from all and sundry, Rakhi Sawant seems tame in comparison, despite her ample presence.

 P.S: We were too dead with disgust to rate the film.

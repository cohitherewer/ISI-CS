 Vidya Balan has problem arms 

I am a 24-year-old

 girl with a good body, but my arms are disproportionate.

 I dont have time to go to the gym and I must

 admit I am quite a foodie too! Can you please suggest

 some freehand exercises?

 Any exercise aimed at toning your body needs something to provide resistance for your muscles to work against. For optimum results, simple hand-held weights such as water bottles that are easily gripped or dumb-bells in the range of one-five pounds are used. Start your programme with lighter weights (for fat loss) and then gradually build it up (to gain muscle). But before you start with any exercise, you must remember to warm up each time with either simple marching or spot jogging, interspersed with some gentle stretches to avoid injury.

 Here are a few examples of simple arm-toning exercises:

 Bicep curls: Hold two dumb-bells/weights by your sides with palms facing in and arms straight. With elbows fixed by your sides, raise one dumb-bell and rotate the forearm till it is vertical and the wrist faces the shoulder. Lower to the original position and repeat with the opposite arm. Continue to alternate between sides. You can move on to work both arms together once you master the movement. 

 Tricep extensions: Position one dumb-bell/weight overhead with both hands. Lower the forearms at the elbows, pulling them down so your elbows point towards the ceiling. Flex the wrists at the bottom to avoid hitting the dumb-bell/weight on the back of the neck. Raise the dumb-bell/weight overhead by extending the elbows while hyperextending the wrists. Return and repeat. 

 Forearm palms-down curl: Stand with your feet hip-width apart, holding a three- to five-pound dumb-bell/weight in each hand with arms down at sides and palms facing in. Now glue the elbows to the sides of the body and keep the palms facing down, raise dumb-bells up and out to sides till they are parallel to the floor. Hold for five seconds, then lower and repeat. With this move, you can target the major muscles in your arms and shoulders to help strengthen and sculpt them.

 Sit upright on a sturdy chair with your feet flat on the floor and hold a dumb-bell in each hand with your arms extended down at the sides and your wrists facing forward. Keeping your upper body stable, bend your elbows to curl weights up towards your shoulders and right away rotate your wrists so that they are turned away from you. Press the weights over your head while maintaining the same distance between the dumb-bells, as you lift but ensure that you never extend the arms up completely straight. 

 Be careful not to arch your back or look up. Keep shoulders relaxed and keep the weights overhead and slightly in front of your body. Hold this position for five seconds and then slowly reverse the movement. Lower the weights.

 PS: Always remember to breathe

 correctly (exhale on the exertion and inhale on release). 

 One arm push-ups: Lie on your left side, with the left hand resting on the right shoulder and the right hand on the floor with fingers pointing towards the head. Contract the abdomen and chest while you use the strength of your right arm to push off the floor and lift the torso several inches off the floor. Slowly lower the torso. Repeat 10 times, and then switch sides.

 Besides these exercises, recreational activities like swimming, racquet sports and shadow boxing can help tone and shape the arms. 

 Lastly, I must say that you need to alter your habits. Being a foodie and not being a gym-goer is a bad combination! Adopt any activity that you fancy and incorporate it into your lifestyle.

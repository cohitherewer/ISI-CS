The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Extravaganza

 The Telegraph Weddings, the three-day fair, proved that come rain or shine, the city is ready to spend big bucks for a grand bash

 At designer Abhishek Duttas studio, his signature leather touches were seen in abundance. His cushion covers, too, unusual and rich, were a hit. We have booked many appointments, smiled Abhishek. The home decor section flew off the racks

Sundays rain was not enough to keep shoppers indoors. The bustling Hyatt Regency banquet, which played host to The Telegraph Weddings exhibition was proof that the city will brave the elements to make the most of a good thing.

 Even at 6.30pm, with just hours to go before the wedding extravaganza came to a close, hundreds were flocking in to be a part of the fun fair, which had over 40 studios filled with fashions, jewels and more, primarily for those gearing up for weddings.

 The exhibition was a good platform. I will be the first to put forward my participation request the next time it is held, smiled designer Chhuti. Visitor Sangeeta Singh was impressed with the ambience and participants. With biggies like Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Kiran Uttam Ghosh and a host of upcoming talent, it was a good mix. The weather is no excuse to stay away from such brilliance, added the 26-year-old from Golf Green.

 Heavy bridal wear was what most visitors were looking out for. Calcutta has a strong bridal market that is price-sensitive. But if you give them quality, they will buy, said Sabyasachi Mukherjee. The exhibition should take place twice a year, he added, before dropping in at Golechas Jewels to pick up a pair of earrings and pendant for his mother.

 While Sabya registered impressive sales, designers Kiran Uttam Ghosh, Dev and Nil and Abhishek Dutta had filled up their appointment books. I have managed to sell 90 per cent of my exhibits, revealed Radhika Singhi from Threds. Calcutta has finally opened up to experimentation, said Ayan Sarkar from Couture Wala, where the concept saris were a hit. 

 Apart from garments, there was much to be had. At Senco Gold, Nemichand Bamalwa amp; Sons and Sunil Jewellers from Jaipur, heavy pieces drew attention. At Godrej Interio, modular kitchens were in demand.

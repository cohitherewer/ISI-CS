The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Fastforward

 What are men coming to?

 The nice men are ugly.

 The handsome men are not nice.

 The handsome and nice men are married.

 The men who are not so handsome, but nice, 

 have no money.

 The men who are not so handsome, but are nice men 

 with money think we are only after their money.

 The handsome men without money are after our money.

 The men who are handsome, 

 nice and have money and are straight, are shy and never 

 make the first move!

 The men who never make the first move lose interest in us when we take the initiative. 

 Men!

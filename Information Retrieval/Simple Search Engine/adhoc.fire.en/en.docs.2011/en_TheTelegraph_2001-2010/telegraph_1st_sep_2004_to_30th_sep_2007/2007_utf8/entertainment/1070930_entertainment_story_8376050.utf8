 Return to nature

 Interior designer Ajay Arya on 

 how man-made materials are passe

 Manufactured goods were the technological wizardry of the 50s and 60s. Man-made materials were considered far more desirable than the traditional ones that have been around for centuries. In the home, wood, stone, leather, glass and natural fabrics all gave way to more expensive man-made alternatives, which were thought to be superior in quality, easier to maintain and thoroughly lsquo;modern rsquo;. 

 This trend has come full circle, with a backlash against imitation and a desire for the genuine. We now crave real oak hardwood flooring or silk curtains where wipe-down plastic and easy-care polyester were once the peak of desirability.

 The real thing

 Today, surrounded as we are by the instantaneous effects of microchips, we value a sense of history. While the vogue for faithfully restoring Victorian interiors are waning, the appeal of original materials is becoming increasingly strong. We cheerfully pay more for something more rustic or earthen in finish. Glass mosaic tiles, with their echoes of ancient Rome, bring quality into a bathroom in a way that modern ceramics cannot. A pure linen tablecloth will always have a style and presence that is far richer than synthetic fabric.

 Regardless of its size or style, you can bring the ideas of permanence and purity of the natural world into your own living room. Many items available on the high street have been inspired by this mood, but they are by no means lsquo;natural rsquo; or rustic-looking. Raw or recycled materials can be adapted in ingenious ways.

 A walk by the sea, through a forest or hillside, could inspire you to bring reminders from the outdoor into your home. You can give green plants the status of furniture by going for a few statuesque, floor-standing specimens with large sculptural leaves to give a room an outdoor flavour. Terracotta-coloured plastic containers will jar, so swathe your potted plant in jute, or choose ceramics with their associations of clay and firing. Include a miniature water feature, animated with air bubbles, for true dynamism. You can also surround yourself with the atmosphere of a woodland, using bundles of twigs or cinnamon sticks from a florist. 

 Shapes of the future

 Organic forms tend to be fluid and curvy. You will see very few straight edges or sharp corners, so keep this in mind when it comes to furniture. Choose rounded chairs in natural materials, such as rattan or wicker. Although one might consider concrete the epitome of a modern building material, it can be moulded into any shape one may desire, while keeping a rough, unfinished surface and a stone-like quality. It can be used to introduce waves and twists that mimic ancient fossils.

 Alternatively, consider using some bamboo cladding to create a textured wall. Grouping similar items together is also an effective way to introduce a variety of height and texture. A cluster of pots or cobbles of different sizes will breathe life into a lacklustre space as well as add interest.

 There can be a sanctuary within your home, where the desire for natural simplicity is fulfilled, a place where you want to do little more than curl up into an all-enveloping chair and switch off your mind along with your mobile phone. The living room can offer you refuge from stress and allow you space to unwind. Surround yourself with natural forms and colours and materials that are easy on the eye and take a break from the present day. You will emerge refreshed and ready for whatever the future holds.

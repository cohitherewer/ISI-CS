 Riya Sen at Hushh. Picture by Rashbehari Das

 Bengali babe in Bollywood Riya Sen was found chilling with her father and friends, including golfer Lakshman Singh and his wife, at Italian resto-lounge Hushh at City Centre on Saturday night. t2 had a chat with her about how she unwinds, her sense of style and more hellip;.

 Where do you like to party?

 I mostly party at home. I do go to a nightclub once in a while, but the best parties are always at home. Even in Mumbai, I have a beautiful house and when in a mood to party, my friends come over to my place. In fact, there is hardly a day when there is no one at our place. hellip;

 What would be on your preferred menu?

 I enjoy Thai food. Again, I do eat out, and in Mumbai I have tried out most of the places, but I love what rsquo;s cooked at home.

 And your favourite tipple?

 Depends. Sometimes I don rsquo;t drink at all, and sometimes I drink what everyone else is drinking! I don rsquo;t have a particular favourite drink. I like cocktails, but my favourite cocktail has no alcohol. It is Virgin Mary!

 Who are your favourite party companions?

 I like to party with my close friends and family. In Calcutta I chill out with my family and school friends from Loreto House. In Mumbai, I party with a mixed group of designers, models, cameramen, actors hellip;. I like industry parties and premieres too, because I know everyone now!

 How do you like to dress for a do?

 Like this (points at the blue jeans and chic white shirt that she rsquo;s wearing). White is my favourite colour. I have to wear so many colours during shoots hellip;.

 And if you were in a more feminine frame of mind?

 I wear a lot of corsets and long skirts.

 And the make-up?

 Minimal hellip; just some eye make-up, maybe. Again, because I have to wear so much make-up during work, I like to allow my skin to breathe when I am not shooting. Also, I feel very overdressed if I put on much make-up!

 How else do you unwind?

 By watching movies. I watch French movies, Spanish movies. I love dark, realistic films. I enjoyed watching Black Friday. My sister Raima and I often watch movies together, because we have the same taste in films.

 But the kind of movies you do are very different hellip;

 Yeah, I am happy doing comedies. But I would also love to do a dark film.

 Do you get to meet Raima that often now, with your different shooting schedules?

 Yeah, but we have a common group of friends. And we come back to the same house after work!

 And your mother visits you often?

 Oh yes, she comes every two weeks, and behaves like she is seeing us after six months (laughs)!

 So, are you single and ready to mingle now?

 (Laughs) Very! Actually I am not very sure whether I am that ready to mingle either. I don rsquo;t like being tied down. It rsquo;s difficult for a working, successful woman hellip;. I don rsquo;t see marriage happening for a long time. I am not ready for it.

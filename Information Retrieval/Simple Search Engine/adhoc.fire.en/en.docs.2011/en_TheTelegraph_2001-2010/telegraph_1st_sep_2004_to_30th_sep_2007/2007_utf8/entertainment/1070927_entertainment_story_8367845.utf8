 Snip amp; Sip

 Now, you can even sip a drink as you treat yourself to a snip-snip at The Salon, the small and swanky parlour at The Park, managed by Headturners, alongside the pool at Aqua. 

 Due to space constraints, there are not more than three hair-styling chairs and a shampoo section at the rear of the 400 sq-ft area. The gamut of hair makeover services includes styling cuts, fashion colours, streaking and rebonding services and bridal make-up. 

 Style right: Bollywood has a big role to play in the styles people wear. After Dhoom 2, Bipashas spiral curls were all the rage, says Susan Francis, hair stylist, The Salon. 

 The staff, which has been trained in-house, uses different colour applications like classic pie section, block colouring and graduated and inverse highlighting. This season, were keeping the base natural and playing around with highlights, says Susan. The salon has tied up with LOreal Professionnel. 

Expert speak 

 With short hair, asymmetrical bangs are in. So are graduated bob cuts with razor textures at the end.

 If you like it long, go for a multiple-layer cut, short and textured in the crown area.

 lWaves and short curls will be back this season.

 The colours of the season are magenta red, brunette, copper, ash and platinum with highlights of tobacco, biscuit, honey and auburn.

 Go for block colouring and contrast highlights instead of global colouring.

 For men, the out-of-the-bed messy look is hot.

Add shimmer to your locks with value-added services like dandruff and nourishing spas, hair-loss and scalp solutions, anti-pigmentation and acne treatments. The unique factor which customers can enjoy here is a style makeover in a great ambience. We have also tried to keep the prices moderate, say Pankaj and Usha Killa, owners, Headturners. 

 Fashion fever: A fashion show at the poolside provided glimpses of the different makeover hairstyles. Shonal Rawat was stunning in a star-layered soft curl look while Jessica wore a vintage 70s look. Tinas oval face was best suited for a multiple layered cut and Russa, with a heart-shaped face, sported the girl-next-door-chic look. Sreshthaa carried off a party look with ease while ash and gold blended with her curly hair. For the guys, it was reverse graduation and a Mohawk cut for Dev and Neeraj respectively. 

 Pocket pinch: For gents, style makeovers start at Rs 1,600, haircuts are priced at Rs 400 and hair colouring at Rs 1,000. For ladies, style makeovers start at Rs 2,200, haircuts are priced at Rs 550 and colouring services start from Rs 1,800 (excluding taxes). Its open from 8am to 8pm everyday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Just in 

 Naram Dharam

 Veteran actor Dharmendra is on a comeback trail these days with Metro and Apne having done well and now Sriram Raghavan rsquo;s Johnny Gaddaar ready for release. Ask him about his experience while shooting the kissing sequence with Nafisa Ali in Metro and he recounts: ldquo;When (director) Anurag Basu told me: lsquo;Sir, you have to lock lips with Nafisaji rsquo;, I thought to myself: lsquo;Yeh lip toh suna hai aur lock bhi suna hai 

 par yeh liplock kya hai? rsquo; rdquo; Veeru admits that he was apprehensive about the kiss 

 but fortunately ldquo;Nafisaji was very sporting and cool about it rdquo;.

 Nanha entertainer

 While shooting for Nanhe Jaisalmer in the deserts of Rajasthan, the weather would change at the drop of a turban. It would stir up a sandstorm one moment and the next, there would be a sudden burst of unexpected rain. But cinematographer Binod Pradhan remained as calm as ever thanks to the film rsquo;s 10-year-old actor Dwij Yadav, who plays the title role. Dwij would stand in front of the camera and make so many funny faces that Binod rsquo;s face would light up instantly.

 Ayesha clarifies

 The otherwise bubbly Ayesha is upset. She is displeased at reports which suggest that her latest film with her rakhi brother Nagesh Kukunoor mdash; the Akshay Kumar-starrer Tasveer mdash; is a copy of the hit Hollywood blockbuster The Sixth Sense, directed by Manoj Night Shyamalan.

 ldquo;Once and for all, Tasveer is NOT Sixth Sense. It rsquo;s a sci-fi thriller. It is a sort of genre which Nagesh is attempting for the first time, rdquo; states Ayesha, currently in Calgary, Canada, for the shooting of Tasveer. This will be her second film with Kukunoor after her impeccable act in last year rsquo;s Dor.

 Say Cheese

 Rani Mukerji on her gift of the grub

 My day begins with: A glass of flavoured milk. Sometimes I have tea. I prefer my tea light. My breakfast keeps changing. Sometimes I have only juice and fruits. At other times, only eggs. When I am in a mood to indulge myself, I binge on aloo paratha or puri-aloo.

 I prefer eating: Simple food, like my favourite dal-chawal.

 My favourite vegetables are: Palak, karela and aloo.

 My favourite non-vegetarian foods are: Fish and chicken. I can eat them any which way mdash; fried, steamed or in a curry.

 My lunch: Comes from home when I am at a shoot. It comprises dal, chawal, roti, sabzi. An aloo and chicken/fish dish is a must. Bengalis have this dish called shukto where you mix vegetables like beans, carrots, cauliflower, karela, baingan, aloo etc, and make a curry. I like that as it is very light and healthy.

 I snack on: Toast and a few biscuits with tea when I feel hungry in the evenings. I avoid fried stuff but if I am really very hungry, I call for a chutney sandwich or a pizza. Throughout the day, I keep having a lot of energy drinks or orange juice and water.

 In chatpata food I like: Chaat, sev puri and dahi puri. In winter, my appetite increases and I can eat really well. I love to have ice creams, burgers, hot dogs and French fries in winter.

 I cannot live without eating: Aloo. I am also always willing to eat rajma.

 Food items I am not too fond of: Salads and curds.

 My dinner is: A combination of Punjabi and Bengali dishes. I love rajma, paratha, chhole puri and halwa cooked in Punjabi style. Bengalis too love chhole puri and aloo-puri.

 When I get dessert pangs: I go crazy over ice creams, pastries, mishti doi, sandesh, milk cake, atta ka halwa, sooji halwa.

 My cooking skills include: Baking cakes, cooking kheer (whether it is made of rice or vermicelli) and also enjoy making parathas. But nowadays I don rsquo;t get enough time to cook.

 My favourite restaurants: I am not really a restaurant person; I enjoy home food a lot. I keep trying out new places. Before going out, I ask my friends to suggest a good place as I am not into restaurant food.

 My favourite cuisine is: Indian. When I am abroad, I relish Mexican food a lot. I experiment with different cuisines but after a couple of days, I start missing my dal-chawal.

 My favourite beverage: I prefer to sip water and orange juice. Alcohol-based drinks are a no-no. But I am not really fond of water so my mom keeps a check on my water intake. In summer, I have watermelon juice or litchee juice or orange juice and fruits which have a lot of water content, like watermelon, grapes, mosambi and oranges.

 On a rainy day: I love to eat rice and yellow moong dal khichdi made by my mom. It should be accompanied by baingan fry mdash; we call it begun bhaaja. Aloo fry or fish fry or bhujiyas would also be perfect.

 I am crazy about: Jams and cheese, especially all the Swiss cheeses. When I am in Switzerland, for breakfast and all through the day I keep munching on cheese, butter, jam and bread.

 I maintain myself by: Walking on the treadmill. We Bengalis love fried stuff. But after my dad has had two bypass operations we go very easy on the oil at home.

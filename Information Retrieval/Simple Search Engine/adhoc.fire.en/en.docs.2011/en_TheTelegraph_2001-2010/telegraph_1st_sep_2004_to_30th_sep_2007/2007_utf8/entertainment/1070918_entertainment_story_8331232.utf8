The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 More telly than tinsel

Director Swapan Ghoshal must have had a TV serial in mind while making the two-and-a-half-hour-long Bonobhumi, based on Bimal Kars novel.

 The story traces the lives of five couples Monami-Rudranil, Rimjhim-Santu, Locket-Ashish, Bidipta-Chandan and Indrani-Rajesh living in a remote village. The film is about love, remorse and the rupture of relationships. But like a TV serial, its broken up into episodes. At every pause, you feel something will happen. Sadly, nothing really happens.

 Indrani hates men but develops a soft corner for Rajesh and Ashish. Monami worships Lord Krishna and deserts her husband as she detests physical proximity with him. 

Locket and Ashish are an estranged couple. Bidiptas husband Chandan works in a coal mine and dies in an accident. Rimjhim decides to leave her impotent husband, whos double her age, but doesnt.

 The film doesnt move. The characters dont grow. Rana Dasguptas cinematography is dreary. The performance by TV actors like Rimjhim and Monami is a silver lining. Indrani is very real, and so is Ashish (but he does need to brush up his Bengali).

 Desi touch

 Forget the west. Traditional ethnic accents and details are as exciting as contemporary ones, says interior designer Ajay Arya

 Trends from the West have forever influenced interior design. Its refreshing to witness our very Indian touch in interior design and other forms of art. Artists, designers and architects from the Indian subcontinent have been interpreting ancient art and design in very contemporary styles. Such creations from various fields of design have helped a modern India emerge in global eyes.

 Over the years, I have been inspired to add ethnic design details in interior works. Traditional methods and materials that have been a part of our heritage have been instrumental in creating many art objects as well as a serene indoor ambience. 

 I recommend the following materials and their applications for decor purposes:

 Semiprecious stones and

 marble: Stunning inlay works of semiprecious stones over white makrana marble has adorned our palaces and places of worship in India for centuries. Though pure white marble has become scarce, semiprecious stones like mother of pearl, malachite or lapis for delicate inlay on furniture pieces or flooring could be used in a subtle manner, along with clean lines of design. 

 Accentuating these with tabletop accessories made with the same stones would define understated luxury.

 Paisley prints and motifs: The very beautiful traditional Indian paisley prints and motifs are very much in vogue the world over. Such designs, either printed or embroidered on fabric, could be used for curtains, upholstery and even on home linens for added drama. A single wall bearing a flowing paisley print or randomly placed motifs could be a highlight of a room. Try getting a printed wall covering or have them hand-painted.

 Wood carving: Craftsmen have produced hand-carved ornamental pieces of furniture in India for centuries. Many such pieces have been passed down through dynasties and generations. It has now become a thing of the past to make such heavy pieces of furniture, as houses and apartments are now smaller in size and maintenance of such pieces can be tedious. 

 However, a small wood carving detail when added to a straight-line piece can generate a lot of interest. Such fusion can make a very contemporary statement. Alternatively, an antique wooden sculpted art piece, perhaps of mythological relevance, in an otherwise very crisp room can add a warm Indian feel.

 Gold and silver leafing: The technique of gold leafing has been used by artisans from this region since ancient times. 

 A good example is the fine Tanjore art works from southern India. The application of gold or silver leafing on individual furniture pieces or even wall panels has become very popular with designers. When used in limited quantities, the touch of gold and/or silver adds metallic chic to interiors. Three-dimensional design forms can also be leafed for a strong visual impact.

 Mirrors, crystals and lamps: 

 Accentuating spaces with mirror and crystal is very hip. Crystal pieces can be added to lampshades and small decor accents like candlesticks and napkin rings. 

 Ethnic designs and patterns when engraved on mirror can enhance grandeur, while mirror work on fabrics adds Indian chic.

 I have been forever fascinated by antique oil lamps in glass, which are still used in some parts of the country. The charm of such lamps and chandeliers is endless and brings alive the romance of the Mughal era. One such chandelier or table lamp can become the focal point of a room.

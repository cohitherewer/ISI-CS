The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 BREAKING NEWS

 Print media, electronic media... How 

 different can a job be when all it involves is a change of 

 medium? A whole lot, discovers Poulomi Banerjee 

 Poulomi Banerjee, STAR Ananda 

 Poulomi Banerjee, STAR Ananda Poulomi Banerjee, STAR I 

 was rehearsing my identity for the day, as I drove down 

 to the STAR Ananda studio on AJC Bose Road for my day as 

 a television journalist. I was relatively relaxed. After 

 all, am I not a journalist too? How much of a difference 

 can a change of medium make? I was soon to find out.

 Reaching STAR Ananda

 1pm

 I present myself at the studio 

 and am given a brief overview of the functioning of the 

 channel. I am also taken on a tour of the editorial, the 

 production control room (PCR), master control room (MCR), 

 the studio, the graphic designing department and the CAR, 

 where the signals from the OB Van (outdoor broadcast vans 

 equipped with instruments to send direct signals to the 

 studio which are then telecast) are received and the analogous 

 images are changed into digital form for transmitting. I 

 am beginning to feel a little bogged down by the various 

 technologies at work, all for a less-than-a-minute news 

 capsule.

 At the writers 

 desk in the editorial department

 1.30pm to 2.30pm

 Yes thats right. The story has to be written, and 

 not blurted out, even for television.

 What I am told

 The reporter might not have the time to come and file a 

 story. In which case, hell just call the assignment 

 desk to break the story. Someone from the desk will then 

 call up the reporter, get the story and write it out. 

 Editing is a three-tier process. 

 The editor has to edit and fit in the written matter, get 

 a view-artist (thats just one of the jargons; simply 

 put, it means anyone who reads out the story in the background 

 as the visuals are shown) to read out the story; edit and 

 fit in visuals, sound-bites and the reporters sign-off 

 statement.

 What I do

 Nothing! I just gape and ask questions. 

 I am severely crippled by my restricted knowledge of Bangla, 

 that just does not fit the bill for the job at hand.

 What I learn

 That its a tough job writing 

 copy. Not being at the spot, the writer is completely dependent 

 on the reporter for the details.

 That the editor has to be prepared 

 for every last-minute change possible. When a news capsule 

 is sent to be telecast, one really doesnt know how 

 many will come, so each is of 90-seconds duration. The final 

 decision on the importance of the news and the time slot 

 lies with the producer. 

 That live news might not really 

 be live, unless it is a late entrant from the OB van. Everything 

 else usually passes through the editor.

 At the PCR

 2.30pm to 3.30pm

 I am lucky, theres a live 

 sports chat show being shot in the studio. But the PCR is 

 not a part of the studio. And its not even remotely 

 like the sets that we have seen in films and on television.

 What I am told

 That even a small mistake from 

 me can switch the channel off air for a few vital seconds. 

 So I must watch and learn. 

 What I do

 I feel chastised. I feel I can 

 be of some help till I enter the PCR that is and see 

 the various screens and audio control systems and graphic 

 monitors and the rest of the paraphernalia. I am quite happy 

 to fade into the background and watch as the producer shows 

 me the various control panels.

 I start the countdown under my 

 breath as the time for the show approaches. I sweat and 

 stare in dismay as the anchor, still in the camera frame, 

 makes an impatient gesture and wipes the perspiration from 

 his forehead. I hear the producer swear under his breath, 

 and I quietly leave the room panic-sticken!

 What I learn

 That even on a live show, every 

 element of a scene is monitored separately. 

 That the studio is just a room, 

 with a plain green virtual set where the anchor stands and 

 talks. At times even the cameraman sets the camera in advance 

 and leaves, so the anchor is alone in the studio.

 That in a news bulletin, the anchors 

 lines might be shot separately, and the rest of the news, 

 already edited, played simultaneoudly from the MCR or PCR.

 That the PCR has separate panels 

 to telecast graphics, a complicated audio monitor and many 

 screens to monitor and telecast the show. 

 Reporting

 3.30pm to 7pm

 Finally on familiar ground almost! 

 I am sent out on a reporting assignment.

 What I am told

 The brief is simple! As a follow-up 

 on the arrest of lovers at Central Park, Salt 

 Lake (with a seasoned TV journalist and cameraperson for 

 company) I have to find out what people feel about police 

 violation of personal freedom.

 What I do

 Easy story, difficult to execute. 

 Which youngster would like to be seen on television demanding 

 that lovers be left to themselves by insensitive cops? We 

 finally call up a student at Jadavpur University and find 

 some of his friends who would stand up for the rights of 

 young lovers. Once there, I coax a few students and ask 

 them to keep it general. I then watch as my colleague holds 

 the boom (no sound here, just the microphone) and records 

 their indignation.

 What I learn

 That the reporter writes his own 

 stories, but there are riders wholl pick up the disc.

 That it is at once easy and tough 

 you have to write less, but there is pressure to give the 

 entire story in a few words and ASAP.

 Also you have to think on your 

 feet. You dont have the luxury to go back and choose 

 your words.

 My day at STAR Ananda is almost 

 over, but I linger to check the buzzing newsroom before 

 heading back to office.

 That half-a-second slot on camera 

 saying Poulomi Banerjee, STAR Ananda is a heady 

 feeling, but I would rather return to t2 and write 

 1,000 words about it!

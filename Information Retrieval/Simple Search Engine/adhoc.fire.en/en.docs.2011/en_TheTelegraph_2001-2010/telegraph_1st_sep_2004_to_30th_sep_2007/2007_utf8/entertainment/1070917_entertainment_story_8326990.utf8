The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 From haircuts to hair colouring, PRISCILLA CORNER tells you all about some hot global trends this season.

 Lady Diana rsquo;s hairstyle was a rage with women in the 80s and 90s

That Lady Diana was a style icon of the 80s and 90s who helped the flagging fashion industry back to life is a fact so firmly established in celebrity circles, it needs no more discussion. Her trademark colourful but co-ordinated look of matching jackets and skirts with their correspondingly hued pumps and handbags was rivalled in popularity only by her hair cut known by stylists here as the Lady Diana cut. This neat, every hair in its propah place, layered style, was the rage among women who liked crisper shorter cuts.

 Its now 10 years since her death and fashion and hair trends now lean less toward synchronised packages and more towards being disconnected thematically. Haircuts in mode these days sport elements of styling/colour with all kinds of asymmetry and directions.

 This year, the Academy of Toni and Guy in Hong Kong, where I was an invitee for almost a week, held updating sessions for senior stylists. I enjoyed every moment of my stay there shopping, endless walking, midnight meals at late-night marketplaces and my interactions with the international stylists who constantly work on shaping the silhouettes of hairstyles to come!

 On the streets and in the high-end salons, colouring has made a move towards being global in tones that are subtly mixed and can only come from a professional shade card.

 Violets, mahoganies, deep dark auburns and blue blacks were what I saw the most of. Haircuts that had shorter layers, known as undercuts, that were either hidden or totally disengaged from the longer layers of the rest of the hair, were the rage. I cannot as yet see many in Calcutta daring to experiment with these.

 In keeping with the premise of disconnection is the question of the week it has totally nothing to do with the paragraphs preceding it! Its about make-up.

 Hi, I am a 24-year-old girl who will be a bride in November. I would like to have my make-up airbrushed as I hear the effect is one of naturalness something I am really keen on. I DONT want to look like an over-made-up bride.

 Name withheld

 Airbrush make-up, available at leading city salons, is the fastest growing segment in the beauty market and its effects are as stunning and radiant as they are made out it to be. Airbrush make-up was first used on the sets of the film Ben Hur, as the cast of the film was huge. The procedure was fast and hordes of actors were made-up in a matter of hours, while traditional procedures would have taken much longer.

 It has other uses, too. It is being used to paint the most fabulous designs on nails and for temporary tattoos.

 What is airbrush make-up?

 It is a technique that involves spraying the skin with micron-pigment mist colours (water-based foundations) with an applicator gun that releases air and a steady stream of the foundation or colour. The result is an organic, evenly distributed blend of colour on the face that leaves it looking poreless and natural.

 How is it different from normal make-up? 

 It is very fine, therefore the look is flawless.

 Is it expensive?

 It is a little more expensive than the traditional make-up application, but the final outcome most often compensates for that.

 Does it last as long as foundations?

 Yes, if applied by a seasoned professional. The effects of airbrush make-up can last eight hours or more. Since it is water-based, the skin can breathe and feels much lighter than under other forms of make-up.

 How safe is it?

 Some people may be concerned with the jet mist getting into delicate areas like the eyes, but the use of stencils and an experienced hand can solve that problem. Besides, all artists use FDA-approved colours. The eyes, of course, should be kept shut while the face is being made up!

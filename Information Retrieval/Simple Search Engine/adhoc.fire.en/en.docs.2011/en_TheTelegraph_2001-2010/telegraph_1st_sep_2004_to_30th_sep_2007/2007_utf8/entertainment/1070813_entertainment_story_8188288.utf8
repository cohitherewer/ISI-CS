 Eat out, eat smart 

 - t2 explores some Oriental restaurants for waistline-friendly options

 Who said that being a foodie and watching your waistline cant go hand in hand? Or that if your cholesterol is on the rise, you have to give up eating out altogether? While the moderation mantra holds true in this department more than any other, even those with health concerns can enjoy a meal out now and again, without severely compromising their fitness regimen. 

 Today t2 begins an exploration of what city restaurants have to offer for the health-conscious foodie. We begin with the reigning favourite: Chinese food.

 Chinese restaurants may top everyones list while eating out, but those crispy fried wantons and spring rolls, fried noodles and konjee lamb pack in plenty of calories and contain bad cholesterol.

 For starters, dietician Doel Bishnu Roy suggests that health-conscious diners choose clear soups rather than cornflour-based thick soups. 

 Avoid starters as they are usually deep fried. For the main course, go for the stir-fries and fried rice options instead of noodles. Stick to the Cantonese variety and order dishes without any fried additions. Finally, skip dessert, advises Doel.

 Generally, the Cantonese variety of Chinese cuisine is a far healthier option than Szechwan, which uses many more spices and chillies. The Cantonese dishes are healthy as they are stirfried or steamed with lots of greens, says Bharat Dhamala, chef and one of the directors of Red Hot Chilli Pepper. 

 At the restaurant chains Ballygunge Circular Road address, a live grill has recently been introduced, just right for those paranoid about their lipid profile. Our live charcoal grills use less fat. We also do a large variety of Oriental seafood grills with mackerel, pomfret and squid without any monosodium glutamate, cornflour or even oil if people so desire. The stewed rice, which is part of these main courses, is also steamed and thus, a healthy option, adds Dhamala.

 Chef Gaurav at Chinoiserie describes how their rather extensive selection of healthy Chinese food at Taj Bengals speciality restaurant includes a number of steamed options. Our steamed dimsums, steamed rice paper rolls and steamed bread stuffed with meat and vegetables are great healthy starters. We also have steamed tofu, vegetables, meat and fish for the main course. We have a special range of wholewheat noodles and low-calorie desserts like fresh fruit servings and a toffee walnut targeted at our health-conscious guests.

 Mainland China offers what it calls lean cuisine, where fresh ingredients are cooked at high heat and are usually steamed or stir-fried, minimising the use of oil and sealing in the nutrients. We have a number of steamed and stir-fried specials including appetisers like sauteed garden fresh vegetables, steamed dimsums with vegetable, chicken and seafood stuffing. There are main course dishes like steamed whole bekti in ginger soy which has no oil, steamed chicken with straw mushrooms in a wine sauce and steamed green giant asparagus, says restaurant manager Kaustav Das.

 Lomein (chimney soup), which is a traditional broth with noodles, vegetables, meat and seafood, is a light choice as the ingredients are cooked in their own juices. Another winner on the menu is a special zero-calorie dessert, Almond Curd Dew, where almond paste is stuffed into a dumpling and steamed.

 There is a handful of other Oriental options, apart from Chinese food, in town. The momo, similar to Chinese dimsum, has become a huge hit and is a safe bet when steamed. Stick to the chicken variety, of course.

 There are a few places in town offering Thai food, which is relatively healthy because of its high-fibre content and fresh herbs. Although Thai food is very spicy, it is a better option than Chinese as it is cooked in very little oil or fat and also has a number of salads which are exotic as well as tasty, says Doel. 

 At the Oberoi Grands Baan Thai, the menu includes raw papaya salad, a boiled glass noodle salad and squid salad, explains Chef Swapnil. The dishes are low in fat, with only coconut milk as the calorific ingredient in them.

 The Japanese are known for their healthy cuisine, and it is a shame that there is still only one restaurant that offers the finest from the Far East. Delectable sushi is made with the freshest of ingredients with no oil and very little seasoning and heart-healthy sea fish. The Japanese also believe that seaweed increases life expectancy if regularly consumed. 

 Our Tuna Maki (a type of sushi roll) is extremely popular and uses the freshest of ingredients without tampering with any of the vital nutrients. We also use basic seasoning like vinegar, salt and sugar, making it an extremely healthy dish, says Chef Pramod of Pan Asian at ITC Sonar Calcutta.

 Sadly, Calcuttas favourite chilli chicken and chowmein dont figure on the list of healthy Oriental treats.

 But once in a while, ignore what your head is telling you and listen to your tummy. If you are still overcome by guilt, you can always make up for it with an extra session at the gym.

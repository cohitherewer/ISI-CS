 Musical 3-some

 Who will play Prosenjit rsquo;s wife? Juhi Chawla or Mahima Chaudhary

 A musical scripted by Aparna Sen, with Prosenjit as either Juhi Chawla or Mahima Chaudharys husband Aniruddha Roy Chowdhurys second Bengali film after Anuranan sure is high on the star quotient.

 Preetom, Shantanu Moitra and Tanmoy Bose will compose music for the eight-nine tracks revolving around a happy family of three a musically-inclined father, his gorgeous wife and their teenaged son. Saregama Films will produce the project.

 Like his maiden Anuranan, Aniruddhas untitled second will also be about love and relationships. Prosenjit will play a middle-aged man who works in a private firm and lives with his wife and son. This is the first time Rinadi (Aparna) has agreed to write the script for a director other than herself and I am honoured, says Aniruddha.

 The story is about a young percussionist, who is Prosenjits son. I wrote the script for myself, but since I got involved with other films I gave it to Aniruddha. I have seen Anuranan and I think his execution is very good, says Aparna. 

 Aniruddha is eager to seal the deal with either Mahima or Juhi as the female lead. Talks are on with both of them. One of them will play Prosenjits wife.... Its a young, urban film with lots of teenaged characters. My target is the multiplex audience once again. 

 The entire film will be shot in Calcutta as the characters are all based in this city. It will touch upon the present value system and the approach will be very realistic. All the characters will be normal people whom we meet in our everyday lives, stresses Aniruddha, planning to shoot two films simultaneously from February.

 Apart from the Bengali film, he is also gearing up for a Hindi film with Rahul Bose. That will be about love and terrorism, says Aniruddha, riding high on the 10-week run of Anuranan.

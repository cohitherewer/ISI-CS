The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Miss matter of fact

 Achint Kaur

The set of Virrudh is a far cry from the set of most daily soaps. Instead of the usual frenzy, there is a sense of serenity. The first thing that greets the eye is a large Buddha. Then there are fragrant candles and floating flowers placed conspicuously around the set. And walking comfortably around the large room is Achint Kaur. With rollers in her hair, Achint guides us to her make-up room where she is Miss Candid.

 I had an arranged marriage at the age of 18. There were several reasons why the marriage did not work. But we parted ways cordially. In fact, my ex-husband and I are still friends, says Achint. I dont follow any particular life philosophy, I just have a matter-of-fact approach to life. I dont get bogged down by situations. I cant stand people who wallow incessantly, she adds.

 What about the people around her? I am very grateful for my support system. On top of that list is this girl who has been my house-keeper and much more for well over 16 years now. Apart from her, I have four to five close friends who I think of as my family, says Achint.

 Stardom has come after quite a struggle for Achint. Financially, it got very tough at times. I dont believe in the concept of alimony or taking financial assistance from my ex-husband to look after our son. I think alimony is justifiable in cases where the woman is uneducated or has not been allowed to work, stresses Achint. But my friends always tell me Im blessed. Even Mohan (Kapur) always tells me that Im just bloody blessed. And that somebody up there is just watching over me. Somehow, things just work out for me.... I dont know what it is. I guess its positive energy that makes things fall into place for me eventually.

 How does she cope with the stress of being a single mother? I have always been very honest with Preetanjan. So, there is no disparity between what he sees and what he hears. He was just 5-6 years old when I got divorced. So, I didnt really explain anything to him. As questions arose, I answered them. But we did not have any round-table conference to discuss the matter, says Achint, in her matter of fact tone. Also, I wanted my ex-husband to be very much a part of Preetanjans life. I told my ex-husband that no matter what happens between us, he and Preetanjan should always share a good relationship. explains Achint.

 Then, Mohan happened. When Mohan entered the picture, Preetanjan was a bit confused and started asking questions. Thats when I explained to him that his papa and I had our own lives but we are still good friends. Now Preetanjan is fine with my new relationship, Mohan and Preetanjan get along well together, states Achint. 

 The chat is interrupted as Achint is whisked away to shoot a scene opposite actor-producer Smriti Iraani. The lines are rather long, but she delivers them to perfection. A few scenes and an hour later, she is back in her make-up room to light a cigarette and chat.

 So what advice does she have for single moms? No advice actually. All Ill say is stop wallowing. Be selfish, work for yourself. Take stock of the situation and stop worrying constantly about the future. Live your life today, concludes Achint.

 STRESSBUSTER - Pradyumna Pointers

Spending quality time with your family is the simplest de-stresser that helps you switch off your mind from the stress at work. When you are relaxing, avoid discussing office matters and politics. Do not put off unattended chores till the weekend, either.

 Comedy, adventure or fiction best suit your de-stressing needs if you enjoy movies or reading. A spiritual mind has lots of options to read and this also supports introspection and gives food for thought and personality development. 

 If you are addicted to news channels, try turning off the TV as soon as you see the headlines repeating in a never-ending loop. Reading a newspaper would certainly be a better option. If you spend time on the Net at night, make sure you dont sacrifice sleep.

 Alcohol can help de-stress. Ayurveda says alcohol, like food, when properly used and misused leads to health and disease respectively.

 Multi-tasking is the need of the day, but being organised can take the stress element out of it. Here are three tools for stress management:

 Bath

 Enhances circulation, raises energy levels and refreshes the mind

 Washes away dirt and sweat

 Relaxes tense muscles

 Improves your appetite

 Promotes better sleep

 Keeps disease at bay

 Balances the emotions, the mind and the nervous system

 Adds a healing dimension to your day. 

 nWhen you return from work, try keeping your feet under running water for a few minutes and also splash water frequently on face and eyes. This gives as much relaxation as a calm deep breath during stressful situations.

 Sleep

 Healthy sleep nourishes mind and body and augments strength, complexion and digestive efficiency and is the only re-charger your mind can be plugged into. The deeper the sleep, the less of it you need. Avoid unnecessary naps and try to differentiate between lethargic and healthy sleep.

 Meditation

 It is said that meditation is conscious sleep and sleep is unconscious meditation. It is always recommended that you start meditation as a guided practice and do it yourself only when you are confident of focus.

 Body, mind and soul are nourished by good food, healthy sleep and spiritual introspection. Ayurveda calls them upasthambas, meaning supportive pillars for the tripod of existence.

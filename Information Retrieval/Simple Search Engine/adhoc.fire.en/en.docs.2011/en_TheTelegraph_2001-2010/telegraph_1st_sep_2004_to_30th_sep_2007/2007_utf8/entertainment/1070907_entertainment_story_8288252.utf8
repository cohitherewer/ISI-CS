 In the land of bandits

 Setting foot in Veerappan territory was exciting, but the security restrictions were too stringent, writes SABYASACHI CHAKRABORTY

 DIARY

 Veerappan ruled the forests of Tamil Nadu when we made our trip to Bandipur (2003). On reaching, we met the field director who entrusted a guide to take us around the forest. Not surprisingly, there were lots of restrictions. Isse zyada jaana mana hai (You cant go further than this), is all you got from the authorities. 

 I loved the Bandipur jungle. We saw loads of elephants, wild dogs, deer, boars and birds. We saw the STP (Special Task Force) camps that the Tamil Nadu and Karnataka governments had jointly set up to catch Veerappan. Inter-state surveillance was very tough, as Veerappan would constantly hop from one state to another. His corridor was through the forests of Bandipur, Nagarhole and Mudumalai. 

 After roaming Bandipur for a day (with nothing much to do since we couldnt go deep inside the forest), we decided to check out Mudumalai on Day Two. 

 Theres a toll-gate at the Mudumalai entry point where the authorities carry out a thorough security check. They asked me my name. I replied. Then one of them asked: Aap Mithun Chakraborty ke koi lagte hain? Mithunda is very well-known in these areas. He has done a lot for tribal welfare. He also has a farmhouse, probably in Mudumalai. Later, I told Mithunda about this interaction. He said: Amar ekhane eli na, etaki thik korli? He is a very warm person. 

 We were driving in my Tata Sumo but the forest officials asked us to take the tourist bus if we wanted to go inside Mudumalai forest. They dont allow private cars for security reasons. 

 But I was averse to the idea because you cant roam freely then. You dont get any good angles to take snaps. So, we had to be content watching the trained elephants and birds flocking by the roadside. We lunched at Mudumalai and decided to call it a day travelling back to Bandipur. We were on our way when something happened that really shook me up.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : etc

Knowing nisha 

 My pet name is: Pinki

 My date of birth: November 28

 My zodiac sign: Sagittarius; but I don rsquo;t posses the Sagittarian quality of being shy

 I got my first pocket money at the age 

 of: I don rsquo;t remember. But I do remember that 

 it used to be around Rs 10 only and it was 

 never enough for me. So I would steal 

 money from my dad rsquo;s or mom rsquo;s purse

 I used to spend my pocket money on: 

 Ice creams, films. I used to love buying stuff 

 and making other kids jealous by flaunting 

 them

 I was at my wackiest best when: I was a 

 child. I used be very naughty. I had a boy cut 

 and used to love wearing guy rsquo;s clothes. I 

 would have honey from the jar and refill it 

 with water. I would also get into fights with 

 boys. Till today, I have a mark on my 

 forehead.... I was thrown out of my school

 If I wasn rsquo;t an actor, I would be: Nothing. I 

 am not capable of doing anything except 

 acting

 I have a soft corner for: Soft toys

 I rsquo;m possessive about: My mom. I 

 wouldn rsquo;t like it at all when she gave attention 

 to other kids

 My biggest blunders: I would hit kids my 

 age with a scale and give them biscuits 

 when they cried

 My idea of fashion: I was never fashion 

 conscious. If you are too conscious, you lose 

 your innocence and real style

 I love gorging on: Dal chawal

 My favourite actress in Bollywood is: 

 Sridevi. I feel she is very sexy. At the same 

 time, she is a very good actress and an 

 amazing dancer. She has great body 

 language. I love her big eyes

 I would love to do films like: Chaalbaaz, 

 Chandni, Sadma

 I am fascinated by: Beauty. I feel a 

 woman is all about beauty. If an actress is 

 beautiful, half her job is done. Good acting 

 skills are like the icing on the cake

 I am sensitive about: My skin. If you slap 

 me, I rsquo;ll have a fever in the evening

 The part of me that I want to change: I 

 want to groom myself and I rsquo;m doing that

 My most memorable day: The day I meet 

 Rajanikanth. I rsquo;m his die-hard fan. I saw Sivaji 

 four times

 My best trait: My will power

 My worst trait: I am not a very good 

 listener

 My most embarrassing moment: Once I 

 went to a departmental store with make-up 

 in only one eye. This was before I had 

 started my acting career. And when I saw 

 everybody staring at me, I was really happy 

 thinking it was because I was looking pretty

 If I were to teach a Hollywood 

 actor Hindi it would be: Richard 

 Gere, though he is a little old

 If offered the main role in an 

 Ektaa Kapoor serial I would: Say 

 yes, if I have the time

 The casting couch: Does exist. 

 People who do it should be beaten 

 up

 The most pathetic dish that I 

 have tasted so far: A Japanese 

 dish. I don rsquo;t know what it was but I 

 didn rsquo;t like the smell

 The most interesting gift I have 

 received: No one gives me gifts. 

 Recently, a friend of mine who is in 

 Paris asked me what I wanted. I said: 

 5,000 dresses. But he refused to 

 fulfill my demand

 I like men who are: Like 

 Rajanikanth. I like his personality and 

 the way he dresses. He is so humble 

 and grounded but once he comes in front of the 

 camera, he is completely different

 My sex appeal is: My naturalness, carefree 

 attitude and innocence. I think sex lies in your eyes

 I get turned on by: Arrogance in a man

 I get turned off by: Double-faced men. I hate 

 luchha men who lech at me

 One actor who looks best without his shirt: I 

 have not seen many shirtless men but Hrithik looks 

 hot without a shirt

 My guilty passion: I rsquo;m a complete foodie.

 I like collecting: Lipsticks. I have 250 but I want 

 to collect at least 2,500. I don rsquo;t use them because I feel they will get over

 I love to play: Dumb.

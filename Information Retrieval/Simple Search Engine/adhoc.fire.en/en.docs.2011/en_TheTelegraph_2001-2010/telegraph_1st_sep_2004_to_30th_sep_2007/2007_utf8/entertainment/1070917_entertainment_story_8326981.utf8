 FLYING HIGH

 Being an air hostess means much more than looking pretty. It means smiling when you least want to and doing everything just right, discovers Karo Christine Kumar

 A wide smile, when I dont feel like it, doesnt come to me any easier than it does to Mona Lisa. So when I played the part of an air hostess on a 45-minute flight carrying 110 budding air hostesses of Frankfinn Institute of Air Hostess Training as part of their in-flight exposure, I was apprehensive and it showed. But since becoming an air hostess figures high on any little girls wish list, as it did on mine 20-something years ago, I couldnt miss it for the world.

 SEATING AND TAKE-OFF

 Up up and away! Wish it was that easy for an air hostess, too. But work begins even before the first passenger steps in. Opening the overhead baggage hatches, standing at the doorway to greet passengers, ushering them to their seats, answering several queries at the same time, fastening seatbelts and always on the lookout for alerts. It takes no less than a hawks eye and a doves look! Take-off time is crucial. I take my place as an usher.

 What Im told

 Assist the passengers to their seats without confusion. If anyone wants to change seats, tell them you will attend to them as soon as all the other passengers are seated.

 Prior to take-off ensure that everyone is seated, seat belts are fastened and all hand baggage is kept either overhead or under the passengers seat. You know the overhead baggage compartments are shut when you hear a snap. 

 Take your place in the aisle to start the routine demonstration of switches, oxygen masks and emergency exits. Each action requires deft movements.

 Make sure that the in-flight voice system is working. Regulate the music when making live announcements.

 What I manage

 Stop myself from shouting out loud at silly queries.

 Check seatbelts and request passengers (students in this case) to switch off their mobile phones.

 Accidentally increase the volume of music instead of decreasing it when a live announcement is being made.

 Give the routine demonstration a miss it requires too much practice for a first-timer, and making a fool of myself in front of 110 air hostesses in the making is not my gig.

 As the plane takes off, the earth is at an angle to the plane, or the other way round! The students are thrilled. Its a first for many of the Frankfinn students up in the air and their excitement rubs off on me. I feel good.

 Lessons learnt

 I must maintain eye contact when wishing passengers as they board the flight. With time, I will learn to look through lecherous eyes.

 Three out of five passengers have questions to ask about their seats.

 Five out of five check out their co-passengers.

 During take-off everybody is seated, including each and every member of the flight crew. 

 Repeating live physical demonstrations at the head of the cabin, first in English and then again in the regional language, is a bother. For flights that have TV demonstrations, work is definitely easier.

 MEALTIME

 Finally! I am sure that is what all the students were thinking as they spotted the food trolley. The best part of the flight for most passengers, but the worst for the flight crew. Its mealtime, baby.

 What Im told

 The food-trolley must be manoeuvred carefully. For a bigger flight, a 56-tray trolley is used instead of a 42-tray one. There are two pedals at the bottom, red and black, brake and neutral respectively.

 A list with the passengers names lies atop the trolley. I must address the passenger by name before serving pre-meal drinks or meal trays at each row. Soon, it is time to ask them if they would like tea or coffee. 

 Sleeping beauties are not to be disturbed.

 Hand out hot towels to freshen up after the meal.

 What I manage

 Wear an apron over my uniform, although Im not wearing a uniform!

 One of the students vomits. Ugh! It is a bad take-off for her. I stay far away from the scene and serve drinks instead.

 Instinctively use my hands to collect the us- ed towels instead of sterilised tongs. Eeew!

 Confuse the brake for the neutral. Thank god the considerate engineers didnt put in an accelerator!

 Lessons learnt

 Sometimes the weather can get so bad its like serving drinks on a rocking boat.

 A flight crew member must be prepared to clean someone elses mess and aid ailing passengers. First-aid is part of the training course.

 Any part of the meal accidentally touched by the hand cannot be served.

 Something as simple as removing a tray from the food-trolley and smiling at the same time is difficult.

 Surprise, surprise! Passengers cannot sit pretty. Because its a narrow-bodied aircraft with six-abreast, the window-seater is expected to stretch out his cup for coffee/tea because the air hostess cannot stretch so far. The aisle-seater is also expected to pass across the meal tray.

 Students really stare. Passengers in general stare. After some time, you get so accustomed to it, it doesnt matter. 

 Touchdown

 The flight is nearing its end and the Frankfinn students are restless. Its clear they want more. During the short span of 45 minutes, the 80 students from Frankfinns Jamshedpur wing have made friends with the 31 from Calcutta. Some exchange numbers and for a minute, I feel like Im back in school.

 What Im told

 To ensure all seatbelts are fastened and loos are empty before touchdown. Then grab a seat myself.

 To help the passengers retrieve their overhead baggage.

 To stand at the exit and say Thank you, Maam or Have a good day, Sir, when the flight lands.

 What I manage

 I stand at the exit and say Thank you, Maam or Have a good day, Sir. Most of the students are nice to me and reply.

 Lessons learnt

 Now I know why the flight crew is always so happy when passengers disembark. Theyre probably thinking Good riddance!

 To smile a wide, warm one when you really dont want to.

 My job is done, but the real air hostesses have much more to do check to see no belongings have been left behind, complete paperwork and usher in the next batch of crew. And I thought it was all about pretty faces and short skirts!

Time: Friday morning.

 Place: A tiny room on the first floor of a Rashbehari Avenue address.

 Project: The telefilm Scoop.

 Cast: Tota Roy Chowdhury, Aparajita Ghosh Das, Mithu Chakraborty.

 Hair pulled back, script in hand, a jeans-and-kurti-clad Indrani Halder rattles off instructions to technicians, looks through the camera and acts out a scene or two to her cast. When she is satisfied, she shouts action.

 Not many have seen this Indrani before the boss of all she surveys, from behind the camera.

 I did two telefilms long ago for a channel in Bangladesh, so this is almost like starting afresh. So I am a bit cagey. On top of that, I am a perfectionist and I want every scene to happen my way. I am not at all liberal on the sets, says Indrani, all smiles after a shot. I sat with my actors thrice with the script and though Atanu Ghosh wrote it I took active interest in it.

 Her story is about a TV reporter, Akanksha (Aparajita), who is constantly under pressure from her boss to deliver scoops. As if that wasnt enough, back home her mother (Mithu Chakraborty) pesters her to marry someone Akanksha doesnt like. Scared of losing her job and being forced into an arranged marriage, Akanksha looks for an exclusive story everywhere. One day she stumbles upon a cellphone on the street. It belongs to Sayan (Tota), who is a filmstar, and Akanksha tries to cook up a news item, says the director, sipping on black tea in between shots.

 After the break, Indrani urges Riingo, who is supervising the camera, to explain the next scene. I have too many missed calls on my phone and they are all important. You can say that it (taking up this project) is a compromise, but Im enjoying it, she adds.

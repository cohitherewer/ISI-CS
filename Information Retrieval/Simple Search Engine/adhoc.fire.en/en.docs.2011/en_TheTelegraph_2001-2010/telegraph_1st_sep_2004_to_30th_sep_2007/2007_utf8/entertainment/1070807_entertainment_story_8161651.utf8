The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Fitness first

 What: Muay thai or Thai kick-boxing classes.

 Where: Golds Gym near Rabindra Sadan.

 When: From August 6.

 Kick-start: Thai kick-boxing is an art of combat, blended with vigorous exercise and is one of the new-age mantras to keep bulge at bay. 

 While kick-boxing comprises only punching and kicking, Thai kick-boxing is almost like street sparring where you can use your elbows and knees. It has several grappling techniques too, says Mrityunjoy Roy, the technical head of West Bengal Amateur Thai Kickboxing Association, who has been signed up by Golds Gym to conduct Muay Thai classes. 

 Mrityunjoy, also a Taekwondo exponent, plans to introduce the sport to beginners with flexibility enhancement techniques. It will also include a lot of footwork exercises. Students will then move on to master the basic moves, including air kick and air punch. The advanced level will consist of engaging in combat with a target. 

 The hour-long sessions will enable the students to get a grasp of at least 20 kinds of kicks, including side kick, knee kick, back kick, thrust kick along with a whole gamut of punches like straight zap, hook, upper cut and elbow strike. You can reduce weight through regular practise because it involves cardio and core exercises. In a months time, you can reduce three to four kg, says Mrityunjoy. It is, however, advisable for people suffering from back pain or heart ailments to stay away. 

 Pocket pinch: Members have to shell out Rs 1,500 plus taxes for a month while for non-members it is Rs 1,700.

 Thai treat

 What: The Roxy Wine Club Thai Wine Dinner with Vir Das.

 Where: Galaxy, at The Park.

 When: Friday.

 Toast to laughter: Wine and finger food set the mood for a laid-back evening. Stand-up comedian Vir Das had the guests in splits, ridiculing George Bush and Mallika Sherawat (in different ways, of course), taking pot-shots at himself, and sharing his uproarious take on the man-smart-woman-smarter debate. 

 I had to come back to India, because I got sick of the Americans pronouncing my name as Weirdass, began Vir, before moving on to his hilarious view on life and relationships. With dinner on the cards, even food was the object of the comedians scrutiny. 

 That didnt stop the crowd from digging in to the three-course Thai dinner by chef Nut Kunlert. Lettuce, corn and crispy noodle salad was followed by pan-fried chicken breast in curry sauce, served with Thai-style spaghetti or sauted tofu with black fungus and ginger, served with flat noodles and vegetables. 

 Dessert was fruit spring rolls with green tea ice cream and mango creme brulee, all served with coordinated wine.

 Voiceover: Thai food is spicy, a little bitter, with a clawing sweetness. An acidic wine, on the sweeter side, complements it best, said Anirban Simlai, executive assistant manager, The Park.

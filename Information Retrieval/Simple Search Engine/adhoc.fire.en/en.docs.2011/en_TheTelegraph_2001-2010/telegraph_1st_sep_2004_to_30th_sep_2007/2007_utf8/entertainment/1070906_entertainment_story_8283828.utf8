 Tagore with a twist

 - Rituparna-Saheb as Amit-Labanya of Shesher Kobita

 Rabindranath Tagores much-loved novel Shesher Kobita is all set to come alive on the big screen. 

 Rituparna Sengupta and Saheb Chatterjee will breathe life into the Amit-Labanya love affair, with Tota Roy Chowdhury playing Sovanlal. 

 Mon Amour Shesher Kobita Revisited will be documentary film-maker Subhrajit Mitras debut feature film. Mon Amour takes off from where Tagore left off, dwelling on what could have happened to the love triangle after a long gap.

 Subhrajit has set the early 20th century novel in contemporary times, where Amit becomes Rajarshi, a London-based film-maker, and Labanya is both Tilottama, who appears in his dreams, and Brishti, the woman he loved and lost. She is married to Indrajit, her college friend who is Sovanlal in the Tagore classic.

 When Rajarshi comes to Calcutta to make his film Mon Amour he runs into his old flame and rival.

 Mon amour in French means my love. I wanted an urban set-up for the film. All my characters are modern in their approach to life and thats why I have changed their names. The essence would be the same but the characters would react and emote the way we do now. The story begins from what happens when Rajarshi comes back to India and meets Brishti and her husband, says Subhrajit, whose docu-feature The Unknown Stories Of The Messiah on Jesus Christ, featuring Aparna Sen and Soumitra Chatterjee, has roamed a couple of film festivals.

 I would have loved to play Amit Roy from Tagores story, but in Subhrajits version the sufferings of Indrajit are so intense that Im more than excited to take it up, says Tota.

 Mon Amour will be bilingual (English and Bengali). The Rs 40-lakh film is being produced by Calcutta-based NGO Men At Work. It will be shot in a Salt Lake house, in the hills of North Bengal and partly in Mandarmoni.

 Kalyan Sen Barat will compose music for six Tagore tracks. Apart from Srikanta Acharya and Shubhomita, Saheb too will playback for the film.

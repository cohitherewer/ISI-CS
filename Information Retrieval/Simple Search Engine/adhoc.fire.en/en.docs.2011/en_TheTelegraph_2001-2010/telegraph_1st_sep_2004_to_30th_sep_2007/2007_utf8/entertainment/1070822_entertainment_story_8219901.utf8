 Lunch: one bowl rice, one bowl salad, one bowl vegetables, two pieces fish

 I am 163 cm and weigh 54 kg. I work from 8am till 9pm. What is my ideal weight? What kind of diet/exercise regimen should I follow?

 Sarmishtha Ghosh 

 You are about 8 kg underweight. I can understand you have a hectic schedule. You can definitely gain this weight, but it will take some time. Apart from following the diet I give you, try to do some freehand exercises for about 20 minutes and light walking after dinner for 15 minutes. This will help increase your appetite and improve digestion. Heres a sample diet for you.

 Early morning: one glass milk with nutritional supplement, six to eight almonds

 Breakfast: two idlis with sambar and chutney, one sweet

 Mid-morning: two bananas

 Lunch: two chapattis, one bowl vegetables, one egg

 Afternoon: one glass milkshake

 Evening: two potato sandwiches

 Dinner: one bowl rice, vegetables with potato one bowl, one bowl dal, two pieces fish, fruit custard one bowl 

 Supper: one glass milk with nutritional supplement

 The diet has been formulated keeping your schedule in mind. Apart from early morning and dinner, you are eating all the meals outside the house. The food given will be available, easy to digest and nutritious.

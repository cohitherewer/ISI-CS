The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Formula family

 Director Prabhat Roy sure knows his job the art of injecting novelty into a done-to-death script better than many others.

 Pitribhumi will surely appeal to those who cant digest dinner without a daily dose of saas-bahu serials. For this is a world of scheming boudis and brawling brothers, their lovestruck daughters and rapist sons. All part of one big disjointed joint family, till he arrives...

 The foreign-returned moneyed boy (Jeet) looking fresh in funky tees, cargo pants and a blue lens realises alls not well with the family he adores. Theres greed, jealousy and debauchery lurking in every nook.

 So, the heros homecoming holiday, post-interval, turns into a moral science class, with Jeet desperate to set things right.

 But he still finds the time to romance Swastika. The lovebirds even manage a trip to Tagoreland and sing Jodi tare nai cheeni go sheki. That apart, Swastika has nothing much to do.

 The background music matches the mood, leaving no room for mindless dancing.

 The family feuds and bonds have blended well too, with Tollywood veterans Dipankar Dey, Lily Chakraborty, Shakuntala Barua, Tanima Sen, Moumita Gupta supporting Jeets down-to-earth persona. Newcomer Subhosree makes a promising debut as Jeets cousin sister.

 Only the second half drags towards a predictable end. Some cliched scenes spoil the fun further. 

 Case in torture point: The sequence of a raped woman pretending to die in order to drum some sense into the brute she loves. Oh, please!

 Eyes wide shut

Its good that Victor Banerjee doesnt watch his own films. At least the likes of Aloye Phera, where he a plays a hysterical granddad and hams his way through the film.

 Victors primary occupation is to play hide-and-seek with his little grandson (Anshu) one of those sagacious, all-knowing kids that afflict our films who one day brings home the visually-challenged orphan Rituparna after discovering her flair for sculpture.

 As for the plot, it progresses little from the time Shakti Samanta made Anuraag (1972). Rich boy Tota falls in love with Rituparna, but his father Biplab refuses to accept a blind girl as barir bou.

 Enter, melodrama. The kid is in his death bed with cancer and he will donate his eyes to Rituparna. But it doesnt end there. Theres an epilogue with a social message which will force you to shut your eyes from further torment.

 Rituparna looks frazzled in her frosty make-up. She also refuses to shed her deadpan expression. Tota makes a fitting pair with his wooden look. Theres Tapas Pal too, an exuberant flower seller whom you remember when he makes sudden appearances in between scenes speaking accented Hindi. Laboni Sarkar as the kids widowed mother has only one task singing lullabies to her son, and also her father-in-law!

 The music is mundane, adding little to a film that trips from one scene to another with abrupt jerks. Soppy story, sloppily made.

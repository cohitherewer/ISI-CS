 12 ways to live longer, with a smile!

 Theres a perception that getting older is a doddle. Sixty is the new 40, 50 is the new 21, headlines shout. Look at all the fabulous role models for older women! We can all be like that!

 No, we cant. Real women dont have an army of people on hand to make them look fabulous. And they dont get air-brushed.

 Lets be realistic: weve all got to get older. Even the age-defying superstars cant avoid it. So we have two choices: resent it and moan about it or try to find a way of staying fit and healthy for as long as we can.

 Actually, there is another choice: have work done. But the idea of hacking chunks out of your face and body because youre scared of ageing is just so frighteningly stupid that I will push that suggestion aside with a distasteful sneer and return to common-sense solutions.

 The biggest problem faced by the baby boomers those of us born between 1945 and 1965 is getting us to admit were growing old. We still think we can do anything. Were fit, fast and most of us are still working. We may be grandparents but we bristle at the assumption that we need to be spoken to very loudly and clearly, and offered a comfort stop and a community sing-song every time we get on a bus. Remember the well-meaning council that got short shrift for offering tea dances and slipper exchange(!) for the over-fifties.

 However lithe we think we look in Lycra, we certainly dont look 18 any more. But if any generation is going to sprint into retirement with 20/20 vision and a perfect smile, it should be us.

 We have been bombarded with health advice from young adulthood, when we reached for the yoghurt and wholemeal bread and went for the burn with Jane Fonda. Unfortunately, most of that advice has been far too vague take exercise, eat healthily, stay alert or just plain conflicting.

 Take the latest stark warning that there has been an alarming rise in skin cancers due to sunbathing. But only last week we were told that we need the vitamin D from sunlight for the good of our health.

 Remember the report that said red wine is good for post-menopausal women? (I stored that information away with glee.) Then came the bombshell that, no, its not really. Apparently, we should only have a small glass once a fortnight, or something completely ridiculous.

 Scientists, please make up your minds! But they cant so we have to. What do we think works? Why should experts, statisticians and researchers know any better than those of us who have lived for half a century or more?

 Im the oldest of four sisters, all of whom, like me, are in their fifties. Last month, we spent a week together learning to sail on a yacht in Greece. We were pretty impressed with our stamina and agility and thanked our lucky stars that our mother, now in her early eighties, set a good example and enjoyed keep fit until only a few years ago.

 But there are other common-sense guidelines we agreed that we wished we had known about sooner. When asked by the yacht skipper to use one word to describe me, my sisters chorused, in unison, Bossy and thus I drew up this snappily titled Bossy Big Sisters 12-Step Common Sense Guide to Growing Older.

 Here goes.

 1) LOOK AFTER YOUR TEETH

 Our gums are now receding faster than the Arctic ice shelf. Im in detention with my dentist for acid erosion. I came late to flossing, but Im making up for lost time by whizzing string through my molars faster than an oral cats cradle. The dental hygienist is my new best friend.

 2) KEEP THE STAIRS

 If youre about to exchange contracts on a bungalow, dont. Keep the stairs in your life for as long as you can, for the sake of your legs, hips and knees and for great cardiovascular exercise. As Elaine Stritch memorably said, in a famous monologue about a call girl realising finally that she should retire: Its not the work, its the stairs!

 3) SWIM

 Swimming is a lifelong exercise and the water cushions all your joints. It gives you stamina and flexibility. Get goggles. Learn to swim properly and you can outpace all those 20-something lads, which is a great ego boost.

 4) ACCEPT INVITATIONS

 Go out. Be sociable. Say yes to things that are out of your comfort zone. An opera on a boat in the North Sea? Fantastic!

 5) STOP MOANING

 Dont complain about your health all the time. If someone asks how you are, the answer should be: Great. How are you? Its always the ones with minor creaks and ailments who never stop talking about themselves. We all have friends with serious illnesses and, without exception, they deal with it with more grace and humour than the moaners.

 6) DONT JOIN A GYM

 Nine times out of 10, you can get all the exercise you need without an expensive membership, a free towel and a huge amount of guilt (because you havent been there since April). Just get out your walking boots or a bike. The only exception is a swimming pool. Find a local pool preferably open-air and heated.

 7) EAT YOUR GREENS

 Yes, it does make sense, Im afraid. In childhood, we were force-fed cabbage (along with Virol and cod liver oil) but isnt it interesting that most of us start to like greens as we get older? Maybe this is Natures way of keeping us healthy.

 8) NAG YOUR HUSBAND

 One of the many annoying things about Gerald, said my friend Kate, is that he drops off to sleep after the lunchtime news. He says, Winston Churchill always took a power nap. I say, Yes, well, he had power. He was running the country. All youve got to remember to do is take the bins out. Women who nag their husbands are less likely to die of heart disease. Do you need another reason? Its fun.

 9) BE POSITIVE

 We all know people who never have a good word to say about anyone or anything. They make my shoulders slump and my spirits fall. If you have friends like that, dump them. Its tough enough getting older without being surrounded by negative miseries.

 10) DRINK WATER

 It flushes the system. It makes the skin look good. Its free.

 11) MOISTURISE

 It doesnt have to cost the earth, but it should have a sun-protection factor of at least 15.

 12) DRINK RED WINE

 Common sense tells me that it is good for me. If it isnt, Ill let you know when I reach 100.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Mandy masala

 Mandy baby wants to change her image for ESPNs new show Dream Job. Been there, done that, style-wise she is now in a different phase. Her hair is also different. The poker-straight look is gone and for the first time theres a hint of colour five red streaks, no less!

 I was fed up going for a touch-up every time curly hair appeared at the roots! So I told my stylist to chop it all and I am so happy with my natural hair its not all curly like Shanti and its not flat. All the rebonding has changed the texture permanently. Her look is also not the same. No kitsch, no drama. Kiran Uttam Ghosh is designing a new look through the 17 outfits she is doing for her.

 Mandiraspeak: Ive lost a lot of weight and my hips have never been this size before. But contradictorily I am in this no-show mood. Its all going to be classic and chic (Sorry boys, sorry cricket fans!). Being on a jury means jackets for me and Kirans name sprang to my mind.

 Kiranspeak: Mandira is always fun to work with. This time her look is very understated chic. Its all jackets and structured, with a controlled sense of volume. Colours are lots of greens, watermelon reds, aubergines and turquoise. Since there was a time crunch, some pieces are from my fall-winter line, tailored to fit her needs. She will also wear some saris as the show progresses.

 Mandira Bedi is unpredictable. And this is not about her style statement. She likes the quirky newspaper print sofa at Kiran Uttam Ghoshs Ballygunge Park studio. She also likes the forever dependable mirror shot. But only till she spots the niche peeping out of two staircase pillars. Hey, thatll be nice, she says jumping to the newly discovered hotspot. And then she decides to do a filmi pose with the rope line. She puts on a seductress smile, pout and all. But just before the camera goes click she breaks into her trademark dimpled-chin grin. Mandira was in town for a whirlwind trip on Saturday to spend time with Kiran and attend a friends wedding party. We caught up with the two ladies at Kirans studio. Heres the censored bit of a rapidfire round, t2 style:

 Black sari or LBD:

 Mandira: Im a sari person. So its a black sari.

 Kiran: LBD (Little Black Dress).

 32A or 34D:

 Mandira: 34C.

 Kiran: Wonderbra. 

 Baby boy or baby girl:

 Mandira: Baby girl.

 Kiran: Baby girl.

 When: 

 Mandira: Koshish jaari hai! 

 Kiran: Ditto! 

 Spa holiday or adventure sports:

 Mandira: Adventure any day! I also won my episode of Fear Factor. 

 Kiran: Adventure sports, me too!

 I like my husband to wear:

 Mandira: Not suits at all. I like Raj (Kaushal) in long kurtas which he wears every Diwali! Also, classic blue denims and white shirt. 

 Kiran: Linen, linen and more linen. 

 When in doubt, I will wear: 

 Mandira: Doubt means Ive put on weight. That means my hips are bigger. That means only a sari can hide it! 

 Kiran: Blue jeans with something white or grey. Maybe Ill also put on my pinstriped waistcoat.

 A now trend I care a damn about: 

 Mandira: I have no clue about trends. Ever! 

 Kiran: Bubble skirts. Ugh! 

 Me and my make-up: 

 Mandira: The Revlon kajal. Its the blackest and best. If I dont have it on, I spend the day answering if I am unwell! 

 Kiran: A YSL under-eye cover.

 Tattoos 

 Mandira: I have two, one on my back and another on my stomach. Tattoos are addictive and so Im thinking of a third spot.

 Kiran: Too painful. I like them, but not on myself.

 Whats the most painful thing youve suffered for the sake of beauty 

 Kiran: Waxing!

 If you were entitled to employee discount, which international brand would you intern with? 

 Mandira: (Thinks, thinks, and thinks some more) This is the first time I am stumped by a question. I would say Guess. Their jeans do amazing things to my hips. But I dont want to work there. Just cash in on the employee discount. 

 Kiran: Bottega Veneta. I love their bags.

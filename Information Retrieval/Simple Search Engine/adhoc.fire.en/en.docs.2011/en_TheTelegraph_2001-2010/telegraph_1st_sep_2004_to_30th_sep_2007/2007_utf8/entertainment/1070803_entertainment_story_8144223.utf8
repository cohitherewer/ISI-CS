Corbett National Park had charmed me so much that I wanted to come back again. So, six years later we made another trip with my brand new Tata Sumo. There were five of us in the team, and we drove down to Delhi via Varanasi. 

 It was a very chilly January morning when we reached Corbett. This time we put up at Gairal, an isolated spot in the forest. Compared to Dhikala, Gairal has a more old-world feel with its quaint British bungalows overlooking the Ramganga river. Gairal has a flourishing canteen too, which serves only vegetarian fare.

 We scoured the jungle for wildlife, but unfortunately no tigers were in sight. There were elephants, jackals, birds and crocodiles though. The jungle is so serene that I just loved sitting in a place and watching the surroundings. A narrow road snaking through a canopy of trees, birds cooing, butterflies flying, a deer sprinting across the jungle track.... These were moments to cherish. 

 Spotting a herd of elephants sauntering across the jungle, I promptly moved closer with my camera. But the moment I aimed, the elephant leading the pack charged at me. I was surprised; I lowered my camera and tried again a while later. The elephant charged again. 

 We were puzzled; we thought it best to wait for them to pass. When the pack crossed the track, we saw a baby elephant trundling along, which was till now covered by the long grass. That was its mother who was upset with us! Elephants are very protective about their kids. 

 Near Ramganga, theres a sign saying Paani mein utarna mana hain. We took it for a forest conservation measure, but a guard said it was an alert against crocodiles. If you dive into the river for a dip, chances are that you will be dragged away by crocodiles! But the elephants just dont bother and the crocodiles dont mind tigers either when they cross the river.

 Matt moves 

 Matt Damon booms 

 back with Bourne 3, but not without feeling an ache here and 

 a pain there...

 The Bourne franchise has made a name for itself with car chases, and The Bourne Ultimatum is no exception. At the climax of the third in the series, releasing later this month, Bourne is pursued through New York by a black ops assassin driving a VW Touareg. The 4x4 becomes an instrument of mass destruction, ramming through busy intersections, stationary traffic and into the back of Matt Damons stolen police car. The tyresmoking chase scene culminates in one of the biggest crashes in cinema history, a fact that Damon might have reservations about. In real life, Damon anguishes over the damage automobiles are doing to the planet, even when they are driven sedately.

 I drive a Toyota Prius and I have one of the Lexus hybrids, he says. Next year Im getting a Tesla Roadster, which Im very, very excited about. Its an electric car, gets about 250 miles to the charge and is fast as hell! I cant wait to get it. Driving a green car is one of the ways we can all do a little more, so Im trying to do that.

 Although Damon, not long married and with a baby daughter, says he makes a point of not getting caught up in the celebrity mania that comes with his job Ive made a conscious effort to stay away.... I dont live in Los Angeles, so that helps his choice of car proves he is not immune to the Hollywood fashion for eco-friendly vehicles.

 But it wasnt always that way. Back in the early days, Damon and Ben Affleck, with whom he wrote the Oscar-winning film Good Will Hunting, were Hollywoods hottest bachelors. Damon dated Winona Ryder, Minnie Driver and Penelope Cruz, and Affleck was linked to Jennifer Lopez. It was a dream come true for the pair who had grown up together in Boston, where they would cruise the streets looking for adventure. Ben had a big black 1969 Cadillac we called the Batmobile, he remembers. It was huge and had dark tinted windows and youd start it up and it would go glug, glug, glug. It probably did five miles to the gallon, and we would drive around our home town in it. But cars like that are definitely in our past.

 Bourne may be Damons most famous character but it was the massive success of Good Will Hunting that catapulted him into the Hollywood superleague. He has since starred in films as diverse as Saving Private Ryan, The Talented Mr Ripley and as one of the all-star cast of Oceans Eleven and its two sequels. There is a sense, however, that he misses those early days when he was a penniless actor wandering the streets of Hollywood. I think back to those days when I was sleeping on friends couches. For years I had two duffel bags and I went from set to set and everything I had in the world was in those two bags. I didnt have a house. I had nothing. And I loved that and there was incredible freedom in it; I could be in and out of a place in a minute I could have everything on my body and moving. And now I have 20 bags and cribs and strollers and Pack Plays.

 It is not the only area where family life is in evidence. Audiences watching a stressed and haggard-looking Bourne as he races between Madrid, Moscow, Tangiers, Paris and New York may think that it is the result of some clever make-up or method acting on Damons part, but the reality, he says, is more domestic: he is simply showing the stress of fatherhood. He and his wife, Luciana Barroso, insisted their 14-month-old baby accompanied them on the film sets. 

 Last night my daughter was up all night, he says, rubbing his eyes. Halfway through the movie Paul Greengrass (the director) looked at me and said, You look terrible. I told him, Im sorry. Im awake all night with the baby, to which he said, No, its really good. She came along just at the right time shes really helping your performance. In the previous two Bourne films Id have to achieve that same ragged look by staying out all night in Paris.

 Damon is feeling his age in other ways, too. I realised how little of a life I had on the first two Bourne movies because I guess I just used to work and then Id go to the gym and then Id go to sleep maybe go out on the town. On this one I was in shape at the beginning of the filming and then I slowly got out of shape because I never had the time to work out. By the end of the movie my jacket was being zipped higher and higher.

 The stunt sequences have also taken their toll. On the first movie, Doug Liman (director of The Bourne Identity and executive producer of the latest film) and I had to put our heads together, because this role was so different for me. We tried to figure out what were the best ways to make me believable in the role, and one of the things we came up with was that I should do as many of the stunts as possible and that he shoots it in a way where its obviously me.

 That really worked well for us, so if its a fight scene it means I have to give up my weekend to go learn a fight and learn the choreography. The problem with that is in the first movie I was 29 and in this latest one Im 36, so I definitely felt my age. Particularly in the big fight scene in Tangiers, where Joey Ansah the other actor Im fighting is 23. When the first movie came out he was probably still in high school. So I was like, Oh, man, Joey, youre killing me! You gotta slow down.

 For this film, Damon went all over Europe, back to New York and then back over to Europe. It was the hardest movie Ive ever done in terms of scheduling. We had a 140-day schedule. I was coming back from Europe a couple of months ago and I looked at my daughters passport: she was 11 months old and she already had 11 stamps on her passport. Thats a record even Bourne himself might be proud of.

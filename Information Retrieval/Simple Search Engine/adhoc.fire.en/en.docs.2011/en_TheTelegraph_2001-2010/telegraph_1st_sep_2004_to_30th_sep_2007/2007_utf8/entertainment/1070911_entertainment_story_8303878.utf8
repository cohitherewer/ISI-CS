The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Meet the Class of 2007

 Neil Nitin Mukesh in Johnny Gaddaar

Be it the uber-cool way they carry themselves or the PYTs they sport on their arms, these boys have got everything going for them. Ladies and gentlemen, we give you the creme de la creme of the Class of 2007.

 Ranbir Kapoor

 Age: 24

 Pedigree: Son of actors Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Kapoor

 USP: Another Kapoor is all set to create a tizzy in the constantly swirling world of newcomers. Not only has this guy got all the babes swooning, but the producers too seem to have made a beeline for him. Ranbir Rishi Kapoor will debut in Sanjay Leela Bhansalis much-awaited Saawariya. And he has already been grabbed by the Yash Raj banner as well. In Saawariya, Kapoor Junior will be starring opposite Anil Kapoors daughter Sonam while Salman and Rani Mukerjis presence in the film will give the newcomers a big boost. Blessed with an amalgamation of mom Neetu Singhs easy charm and dad Rishi Kapoors infectious confidence, Ranbir has reportedly managed to impress the drop dead gorgeous Deepika Padukone.

 Harman Baweja

 Age: 20-something

 Pedigree: Son of producer-director Harry Baweja

 USP: Earlier, he was known as the boyfriend of Piggychops, better known as Priyanka Chopra. Thanks to his light eyes, angular face structure and peaches-and-cream complexion, Harman is now being touted as the next Hrithik. But itll be a tough call for this newcomer to meet the standards set by Greek God Roshan for that, besides Harmans looks, his acting skills too must do the talking. His debut film, Love Story 2050 is a sci-fi flick filmed in Australia . The movie is deemed to be one of Bollywoods most expensive movies and is expected to release in the coming few months.

 Sikandar Kher

 Age: 20-something

 Pedigree: Son of actors Anupam Kher and Kirron Kher

 USP: He may not be your conventional chocolate hero, but if Sikandar has inherited his parents acting proficiency, he is bound to work! A string of ladies Gul Panag, Shivani Kapoor and now Miss India , Sarah Jane are said to have succumbed to his innate sex appeal. December 2007 will showcase him in Sanjay Guptas Woodstock Villa opposite Neha Uberoi. He may not be the stereotypical knight in shining armour, but as a bad boy on a bike he dhooms far ahead!

 Mimoh

 Age: 21

 Pedigree: Son of actors Mithun Chakraborty and Yogeeta Bali

 USP: With a name like Mimoh, he is bound to evoke curiosity. Disco king Mithun, in a unique tribute to his favourite idols, Michael Jackson and Mohammed Ali, borrowed Mi from Michael and Moh from Mohammed and named his son Mimoh. Mimoh was nestled in the hills of Ooty but the world of showbiz seduced him to return to Mumbai. Mimoh is making his debut in He The Only One. The film is a remake of a Telugu film, an action-musical with strong family bonding. Mimoh dances like a rock star (apparently better than the Disco Dancer himself!), he is imposingly tall, but wish he would work on his voice and wouldnt endorse so many hair colours.

 Neil Nitin Mukesh

 Age: 24

 Pedigree: Grandson of legendary singer Mukesh

 USP: Hailing from the crooning fraternity, comes a non-conformist dude whose bending the family traditions a wee bit. Grandson of Mukesh and son of Zindagi ki na toote ladi singer, Nitin Mukesh, this young man is all set to venture into Bollywood. With his smashing, phoren good looks, hes sure to win many hearts. But his debut vehicle Shriram Raghavans Johnny Gaddaar with Dharmendra better show off his acting prowess lest he becomes one more Johnny who tried his luck in films. The man claims his aim is to be a romantic but macho lover! Err, ok, good luck with that one!

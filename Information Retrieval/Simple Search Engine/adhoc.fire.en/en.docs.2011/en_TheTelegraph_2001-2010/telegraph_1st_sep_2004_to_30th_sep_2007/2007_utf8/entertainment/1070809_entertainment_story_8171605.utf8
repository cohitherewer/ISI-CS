The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Making a musical 

 mark

 RISINGROCKERS

 Glass Onion strikes 

 a rather motley pose. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta 

 Who: A motley group that 

 hits the cramped mezzanine quarters of a Lake Terrace house 

 almost every evening to practise its music. The members 

 are liberally sweat-streaked there are no fans. But no 

 one minds. Drummer/vocalist Priyanka takes the tiny area 

 leading to a slightly larger room, where the two guitarists 

 find space to sit, while bass player Subhayu stands and 

 plays. Meet Glass Onion, comprising students from Jadavpur 

 University, Presidency College and Future Institute of Engineering 

 and Management.

 Why: The unusual name is 

 derived from a song from The White Album by the Beatles, 

 borrowing from the Fab Fours insistence that their 

 songs did not carry profound meaning, but were meant to 

 be enjoyed.

 Where from: Formed last 

 year, the band has passed through line-ups before hitting 

 on a working chemistry. The reason it works, according to 

 guitarist Debarshi aka Laddu, is because they are 

 friends before being band members. All except lead 

 vocalist Arunava grew up together around Southern Avenue. 

 Style: Glass Onions 

 music is not about flash, says the other guitarist Vinayak, 

 a masters student at JU. Diverse influences, from 

 the Beatles to Jaco Pastorius and The Ventures come into 

 play when the band performs. Currently, Glass Onion has 

 four originals, but they also play covers from CCR, Fleetwood 

 Mac and The White Stripes. 

 What next: Glass Onion 

 has finally started getting shows. They have picked up hard-learned 

 lessons along the way. We realised that while approaching 

 people, professionalism went a long way. We now have a card, 

 a brochure with a CD inlay, explains Debarshi. Glass 

 Onion won the JU engineering fest, Sanskriti, in 2006 and 

 went on to perform at Princeton Club. The band also reached 

 the finals of the Scholastic Beats band battle, held in 

 association with t2.

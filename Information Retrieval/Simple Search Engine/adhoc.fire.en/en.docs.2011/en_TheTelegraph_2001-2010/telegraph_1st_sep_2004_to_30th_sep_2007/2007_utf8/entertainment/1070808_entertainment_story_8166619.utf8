The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Out of order

 WE ARE NO LONGER HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR OUR OWN ACTIONS, SAYS CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

 Following the spate of incidents of sexual harassment in the city, one of my colleagues was asked to write a psychological profile of an offender. She was left feeling a little confused after speaking to some experts. 

 Molestation, she was told, could be an Impulse Control Disorder. The man who tries to grab you in the Metro may be suffering from a condition that makes him unable to control his urges. So he reaches out for a certain body part of an unsuspecting woman as a child might reach out for food. My colleague was also told that if the perpetrator was observed to be equally impulsive in other fields of life, he was suffering from the said disorder. If not, it could be an Organic Disorder caused by a brainwave imbalance. Or Over-stimulation Disorder, which comes from excessive exposure to and consumption of the media, malls and junk food, which are not his fault, but of the private sector. 

 Unlike in the age of free will, which was invented in Europe during the Renaissance, man is not responsible for his actions any more. His disorders are. They have mostly been invented in the US and are fairly recent. 

 According to this school of thought, a psychopathic killer could once have been a boy sleeping in his Mickey crib dreaming of Spider-Man when he woke up to find in the grey light of dawn that his father was a cross-dresser. Or, once his mother did not bother to check the tiny bone that was lurking in the hamburger it shattered one of his teeth and his self-esteem forever. 

 Taking my cue from this line of thought, I present a few cases of severe disorders. 

 Osama bin Laden: He suffers from the Intermittent Explosive Disorder. It can only be understood in terms of the diathesis-stress and biopsychological models, but such persons, under stress, need to let themselves go. And bin Laden has been under stress since the US has been the worlds superpower. (They did it carefully even before he was born.) But then it became a hyperpower in the 90s. The difference between a superpower and a hyperpower is the difference between a supermarket and a hypermall. There is an excellent hypermall in Goregaon, Mumbai, though Calcutta is yet to get one. 

 Anyway, the danger posed by the person suffering from Intermittent Explosive Disorder to other individuals and property can be substantial. They could be two 110-storey American towers. 

 George Bush: Osama bin Ladens bete noir could be suffering from Narcissistic Personality Disorder. It consists of delusion (a false belief based on incorrect inference about external reality that is firmly sustained despite what almost everybody else believes, says the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, a manual published by the American Psychiatric Association), arrogance and insensitivity. It makes Bush Jr look at the mirror again and again. But instead of seeing a devastated Iraq, he sees Marilyn Monroe. 

 Some feel that bin Laden and Bush could exchange their disorders and the results would be the same. 

 Hannibal Lecter: Hannibal the Cannibal, had an eating disorder. He once ate the brain of a man still alive. Thank God he didnt think of the calorie count, in which case he would be suffering from anorexia. 

 Salman Khan: Had a sleep disorder. He (allegedly) ran his vehicle over a man sleeping on a pavement in Mumbai in the early hours, killing him. 

 And dear Sanjay Dutt: Sanjubaba and Munnabhai to everyone, Tragic Hero according to the most-widely circulated English weekly, for whom the nations heart is still bleeding, because he had suffered every kind of personal disaster. We have the list thrust on us again and again. He lost his mother early. He was into drugs. He had one affair after another. He lost his divorced wife. He lost his daughters custody. He must have suffered from Depression, Mania, Hypomania, Bipolar Disorders I and II, Cyclothymia, P Type Personality and Rapid Eye Movement. 

 He needed an AK-56 to protect himself against the wicked, wicked world, because Superman didnt come to his rescue. He was a little boy all along. 

 But Justice Kode is probably ignorant of psychological theories.

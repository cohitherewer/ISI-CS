 BORDERLINE

 As we enter the seventh decade of Independence, here rsquo;s another reminder that we share the distinction with a neighbour. BBC World has launched a month-long season mdash; India amp; Pakistan 07.

 The more globalised the world becomes, the more the boundaries will blow and interdependencies will come into focus. So as a global broadcaster, we decided not to look at India in isolation, Narendhra Morar, commissioning editor, BBC World, told t2 from London. 

 On August 14 and 15, there will live coverage from both countries. World News Today presenter Nik Gowing will be reporting from India while BBC World presenter Mishal Husain will be in Pakistan on the eve of the Independence Day celebrations. They will discuss future prospects of the two countries, especially in the light of Indias growing economic profile, Morar said.

 In addition, BBC World will beam some unusual documentaries exploring both countries from unique perspectives. The Wedding Business follows a young Indian couple preparing for the big day, thereby looking at the multi-million dollar industry. From the family match-maker to online sites, kaarigars to branded jewellers, the business is a microcosm of Indias growth. By our estimates, the wedding market involves about 700 tonnes of gold a year.

 Indian School follows a school year in two private schools in Pune, looking at the dreams and anxieties of pupils, parents and teachers. Desi DNA has young British-born Indian and Pakistanis going back to their roots and revealing how much the countries have changed. There are some Pakistan-only shows too, like Another Pakistan, that shows a country the rest of the world rarely sees: colourful, musical and vibrant. 

 The documentaries will be beamed through the weekends till mid-September.

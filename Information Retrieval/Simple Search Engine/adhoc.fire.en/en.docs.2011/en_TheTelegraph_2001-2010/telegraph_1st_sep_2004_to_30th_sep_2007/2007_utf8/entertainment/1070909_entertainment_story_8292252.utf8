 Meet the juggler

 Doctor-turned-model-turned-TV star-turned-businessman-turned-producer-turned restaurateur Anuj Saxena is a man who really does wear many hats. From the early success of shows like Kkusum on Sony, Kumkum and Saara Aakash on STAR Plus and Prratima on Sahara One to his new avatar as managing director of the Elder Group of Companies, Saxena juggles his various roles with ease. t2 caught up with him at the launch of his companys latest skin care product for men.

 On the transition from medical school to the business world to K serials: Well, I studied medicine for six years and then my father convinced me to join the family business even though I was really bad in math and didnt know too much about the corporate world. Soon after, in 1991, a few modelling assignments came my way and I did ads for Proline, ICICI.... Then it seemed to be a logical progression towards serials and my first serial was aired on DD in 1993; an Indianised version of Ayn Rands Fountainhead called Aasman Se Aage. Then Kkusum happened and with the character of Abhay Kapoor my life changed forever as I was expected to be a persona and not just Anuj Saxena anymore. I have been blessed in many ways and never really needed to struggle but with Kkusum I got my first taste of fame and popularity. Thereafter the roles poured in and I got to play Jatin in Kumkum and Karan Singh Rathore in Saara Aakash each of which was entirely different giving me a chance to explore a whole gamut of characters and people in different shades of good and bad.

 Favourite roles: All the roles I have played have been very different and interesting in their own way. The role of Abhay Kapoor gave me a huge fan following and adoration that I didnt know was possible. It was a great feeling and motivated me to do newer and more challenging roles, which I found with Karan Singh Rathore, who was a sophisticated character with subtle negative shades to him. Then there was Jatin in Kumkum where I knew exactly where the role started and ended, giving me a chance to plan the whole graph of the character.

 On films and future plans: My production house Maverick Productions, which was launched in 2005, has a number of scripts lined up and our first big release is Dulha Mil Gaya which is scheduled for December 2007. It stars Shah Rukh Khan and Sushmita Sen and marks the directorial debut of Mudassar Aziz. The general plan for the production house is to work with one big-budget film and two small-budget films per year to balance things out. As far as acting is concerned there are a few films in the pipeline where I play second lead to the hero. I am willing to start at the bottom and build up gradually. I want to try my hand at the new multiplex films as the tastes of the audience are changing and they are more receptive to new ideas. Due to my various commitments it is goodbye to television for the moment, as I simply dont have the time. However, tomorrow is always another day. 

 On being a jack of all trades: Theres the money and power that comes from the business. The production house, the restaurant Blue Waters in Andheri... are all an attempt to branch out and create a corporation. Then there is my passion, which is acting, and finally and most importantly my family which is the support system of my life. To manage it all I have to juggle well and on an average sleep not more than three hours a day and take off on Sundays.

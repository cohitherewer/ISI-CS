The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Picture Power 

 CELEBSPACE

He may have seen mere moments on the football pitch in his Galaxy jersey, but David Beckham and wife Victoria seem quite at home in Los Angeles already. In this scene from a party held to welcome the Britons to their new home, it is clear Team Beckham is comfy partying with the likes of Tom Cruise and Jim Carrey. And with Poshs new show on air, they look all set to score as glitteratti, if not with goals.

 Oh dear! Dr Shilpa Shetty is holding on to her certificate for dear life. The glint in her eye gives her the look of a kid lost in a toyshop with mommys credit card in hand. And we understand why. Bollywood B-lister turned Celebrity Big Brother victor never made it through college, and a degree is something she always wanted that money couldnt (apparently) buy. And skipping the lowly BAs and MAs for the lofty Doctorate would make anyone (and her mum) very, very proud.

 Did they? Or didnt they? This picture is not very useful in helping us decide whether soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo really did kiss Bipasha Basu, but the quizzical expression on her face makes it interesting all the same. The Wonders of the World co-hosts were caught on camera seemingly doing the dirty but not coming clean about it at a Lisbon nightclub. And while both the Man U star and the Bengali bombshell are denying the deed, they do seem to share far more chemistry than Bips and John seem to do of late.

 President Pratibha Patil and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh stand obediently by the side of the fount from which their power springs. Sonia Gandhi, the ruler by remote, seems to be quite enjoying her role as high priestess bestowing power with her nose firmly in the air.

 The cameras seem to all be trained on Mrs Aishwarya Bachchan (nee Rai) who looks quite at home on the Cannes red carpet. In stark contrast with Ashs diva-like presence, husband Abhishek looks grumpy and distinctly uncomfortable as he nervously adjusts his shirtsleeves. Could it be that it finally dawned on Abhishek that his wife is a bigger star than he, that the paparazzi were there for her not him? Sorry,

 BluffMaster, life is like that only...

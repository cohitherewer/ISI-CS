The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Return of the entertainer

 Govinda on Partnerships old and new. Plus, a new film that you must not watch

Govinda has made a thumping comeback with Partner. The actor may not be a romantic icon like Shah Rukh Khan or an all-rounder like Hrithik Roshan, but he does remain Entertainer No. 1. Heres a Chi Chi chat...

 Congratulations for Partner. It must feel good to be back...

 I feel over the moon. Im thankful to God for giving me this opportunity when everything seemed down. It feels great. Everyone has ups and downs, but my down stretched for much longer than I, or anyone, expected (smiles). The emotion behind the comedy in Partner is the biggest reason for its success. People are very happy. They are calling Partner my comeback film. My fans didnt consider Salaam-e-Ishq or Bhagam Bhag as a proper comeback.

 How have your wife, daughter and son reacted? 

 Since my son has come of age, he has never seen my success. He waited for five years. After Partner he feels great for the first time he has come to know that his father is also a star. My daughter is enjoying the feeling too. My wife is happy that I am back to my original form.

 The film has resulted in a new Partner-ship between Salman and you...

 I think the partnership has just begun. I hope God saves us from evil eyes. We are one family. Salman treats the whole film industry like family. Salman has given me this fabulous opportunity in his home production. It is very rare that in the home production of one hero another hero gets so much prominence. What they have done for me, I can never express in words.

 Has Sohail Khan gifted you a Merc? I had refused to quote him a price, I said, Main chhote bhaiyon se paisa nahin leta. They gave a Mercedes to (wife) Sunita.

 Your thoughts on Salman in Partner... I think Salman is fantastic. He looks so handsome in the film. After Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!, Maine Pyar Kiya and Karan Arjun this is one film where I whistled for him. He is the most handsome man in Bollywood. I think somebody had declared him the Tenth Most Handsome Man and me the Tenth Most Popular person in the world. But now Salman has become the first or second most handsome man; I am somewhere around the sixth in my category, maybe (smiles).

 When was the last time you felt this happy? I did struggle when I was beginning my career but not so much. When Love 86 began, I was really happy. And I am equally happy with Partner.

 Why did you hit such a low? And why did it happen? It all depends on your stars, even if you are a star (smiles). Ups and downs keep coming in life. When they are harsh, it becomes very difficult to handle the situation. With me, it went on for a longer time because of my own stars; I went through a black phase for almost 10 years. Muqaddar ke liye toh muqaddar hi zimmedar hota hai (fate alone is responsible for ones fate) but to sustain and survive through this difficult period is very tough.

 How did you manage to keep your chin up? I think my mothers blessings helped me the most. My constant hard work, my sincerity and my cumulative goodwill in the industry also helped. I got affected by the sudden death of my mother. When she passed away in 1996, I went totally haywire. It took almost seven years for me to become emotionally normal. For the last three years, Im trying to come back.

 You have got back into shape too from 105 kilos to 85 kilos? I was 108 kilos. I am 85 now and Im aiming to be 75 kilos.

 Do you think you will be back to your Shola Aur Shabnam days when you had rippling muscles?

 During Shola Aur Shabnam, I weighed around 82kg. So I am three kg more now (smiles). The muscles will also come back, just 20 more days to go. I have a perfect gym routine. I can work out now with Salman after the release of Partner. For Partner, the role demanded a slightly plump character. Salman exercises really hard, he works out for two hours every day.

 What films are you doing now? A film for Ravi Chopraji. Talks are on with Ashtavinayak, Priyadarshanji, and Davidji. Ravijs script is one of the finest edited scripts that I have heard. It is a three-hero film, I am one of the main heroes.

 How happy are you to be back with David Dhawan? David has matured and become a very sincere film-maker. Earlier he made films, nowadays he paints films. We have given about 12 hits together. I must give major credit to him for the way he has handled both of us in Partner.

 What is the status of the sequel to Partner called Tom and Jerry?

 Sohail Bhai ke picture mein I dont have to see the script or the screenplay. I will just do the film. Jo role milega kar doonga.

 Your daughter Narmada and son Yash are also keen to join films...

 Narmada is already assisting Rakesh Roshan. I have asked her to learn all about films, so that when she comes on screen for the first time, she should have my experience to back her too. There will be high expectations from her so her plus is also a minus point. My son is too young to discuss films. Woh jahan jaayega, hero hi banega.

 How will you balance politics and films? If you plan your life, you can give quality time and work hard too. I would not neglect my duties as an MP at all. Aage ka uparwala jaane.

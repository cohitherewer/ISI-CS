Introducing

 SIKANDAR KHER

 Even before the release of your first film, you have started shooting for your second film mdash; Summer of 2007...

 Yes, I was shooting for Summer of 2007; but now, after a long time, I have got a break from work. I play a student in this youth-centric film.

 And have you completed your debut film, Woodstock Villa?

 Except for the dubbing, Woodstock 

 Villa is complete. It is a suspense 

 thriller and I had a blast working in it.

 Making her debut alongside me is Neha Oberoi. We expect to release the 

 film in December.

 You rejected quite a few roles before zeroing in on Woodstock Villa . Why single out the Hansal Mehta film?

 The film just felt right and the role was good. The production house White Feather Films has Sanjay Dutt rsquo;s name associated with it. Sanjay Dutt is like family. No, I wasn rsquo;t skeptical before I signed the film. Every film does not become a hit and Hansal rsquo;s work in the past has been quite impressive. He has done a good job in this film too.

 How involved was producer Sanjay Gupta in the making of Woodstock Villa?

 He was totally involved. He gave me a lot of support.

 You were linked to your Summer of 2007 co-star Gul Panag...

 Gul is playing one of the girls in Summer of 2007 but the girl paired opposite me is Ambika Chaudhary.

 You have also been linked to Shivani Kapoor and Sarah Jones hellip;

 I really do not know yaar hellip; Why don rsquo;t you ask the people who have been making up such stories?

 Did you become an actor because you had actor parents at home?

 No, it was not because of my parents. I wanted to become an actor since I was four years old.

 Did you undergo formal training in acting? 

 I did do a workshop with NSD (National School of Drama). Any kind of training helps one become a better actor. Acting is all about working and practising. Acting schools do help in polishing a newcomer rsquo;s skills.

 What was going through your mind when you faced the camera for the first time?

 It was a wonderful experience and I absolutely loved it. It was what I had wanted to do my entire life and I was finally doing it.

 Is Anupam Kher a better actor or a better father?

 You cannot compare him as a father and an actor yaar hellip; He is a fantastic father and a fantastic actor.

 Your mother Kirron Kher mostly plays compassionate mothers on-screen. How is she off-screen?

 She is a lot more compassionate off-screen.

 Is it an advantage to have popular actors as your parents?

 Nobody is going to place their money on me just because my parents are famous. It does help you in getting touch with people but once you walk through that door, you have to prove yourself.

 You will be now sharing screen space with Abhishek, Aishwarya and John...

 Yes, we are working in a movie together. All I can tell you at the moment is that I play a biker in it.

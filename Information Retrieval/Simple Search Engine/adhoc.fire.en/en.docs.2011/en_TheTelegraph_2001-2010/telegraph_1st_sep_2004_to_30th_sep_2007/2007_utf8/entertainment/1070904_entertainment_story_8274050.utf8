 The winter woman

 Spring-summer has evolved to fall-winter and the baby doll has grown into a sophisticated glam woman. She doesnt want to wear a trapeze top anymore; shed much rather wear a classic trench coat teamed with skinny lowers. She doesnt care for blinding bling; minimal sheen is what makes her shine. She doesnt like to spend on trendy trinkets anymore; shed prefer to invest in an elaborate bag. And for her face, she isnt afraid of a little fruity fun. t2 puts together her look book for fall-winter 2007

Charcoal code

 When and why has black, every womans fail-safe friend, fallen out of favour? Take heart charcoal is the next best thing. While its different in tone, it shares the same slimming properties of its more celebrated relative.

 International biggies like Marc Jacobs, Karl Lagerfeld and Gucci went all out with charcoal for their latest fall-winter statements and so did Indian designers. Rohit Gandhi and Rahul Khannas Light Fantastique is all about a non-colour movement and Tarun Tahiliani also opted for a near-black tone. Rohit Bal went a step ahead and decided to name his collection Koyla! Call it Gothic, call it granny glam, charcoal will be everywhere this winter.

 Get it right: You really cant go wrong with charcoal, but if you dont like the colour, go for substitutes. Delhi-based designer Gaurav Gupta prescribes solid colours like olive and aubergine.

 The it silhouette

 The it silhouette continues to be a long top or a dress worn with leggings or tights. Covering the legs is an absolute must this season, says Delhi-based Rohit Gandhi of H2O and Cue. Gaurav suggests the top be anti-fit. Wear the look with cool ankle-high boots.

 Get it right: Though leggings create an illusion of slim legs, Delhi-based designer Nikhil Mehra (of Shantanu amp; Nikhil) suggests you dont wear anything too short to avoid looking tarty! Cover your thighs, the widest circumference of your legs. Team your leggings with knits, dresses and leather trench coats. Remember that leggings are pop high-street fashion picks. They are not for evenings-out and definitely not a replacement for your jeans! They have their limitations and timings, warns Nikhil.

 Jacket jazz

 The three must-own jacket styles this fall are a trench coat, a boxy and a peplum jacket all in charcoal, the shinier the better. (In Calcuttas warm winters, these are all of rather limited utility. Could it be time to plan a trip?)

 Draped boleros, A-line jackets, double-flap coats and bandhgalas will also be seen.

 Hold on to your shrug as well but make it slightly longer, till mid-waist, says Gaurav. The focus this season, say designers, is on the neckline of the jacket. They could be convertible collars, peter pan or round necks.

 Get it right: Though these jackets are easy to wear, do layer correctly. And find a cut that complements your body type.

 Metallic hint

 A hint of metal on your clothes is a huge trend this winter. The metal mania could hit you in the form of matt sequins, Givenchy style, or it could glisten from the fabric itself, Versace style. It could also be shiny black lacquer the wet black look from Cue. If you like Manish Arora, who doesnt believe in just a hint of anything, you could also go for full-blown exaggeration.

 Metal magic has dazzled the world for at least five seasons in a row. This is because embellishment is slowly losing its charm. New-age manmade fabrics are the way to head. And they always have a lot of sheen, explains Nikhil. But this season, be sure to make the most of that dazzling metallic ensemble, as it is likely to go out next spring-summer.

 Get it right: For the style junta, its best to restrict the metal to a hint. The trend is not about OTT bling. It is subdued. Also, stay away from cheap substitutes in plastic or polyester. They look ugh, says Rohit Gandhi.

Accessory appeal

 Big neckpieces, chunky cuffs and oversized glasses continue to be a hit. Black and grey are the two colours when it comes to shoes and bags. And if you havent bought your shiny black pumps yet or ankle-high boots, its time to hurry up. Also, make sure the sheen travels higher to the bag this winter with glossy patent leather making a mark.

 Get it right: The too-much-together look can mess things up royally. When in doubt, ditch all the jewellery and concentrate on an elaborate bag, is Gauravs top tip.

 Make-up and hair

 Make-up ace Ambika Pillai is all for colour returning to the face this winter. The summer has gone and so have nude lips and smoky eyes. The fall-winter shows saw a lot of plum on the mouth with biggies John Galliano and Gucci followed by Rajesh Pratap Singh and Raghavendra Rathore colouring the mouths on the ramp. The lips go brighter with orange, pink and red, says Ambika.

 The hair, she says, is tightly curled, close to the scalp. If you have poker straight hair then tie it back tight into a chic ponytail. Designers have also played with the Twiggy look or 60s bob. Go experiment!

 Get it right: Dont follow these rainbow trends blindly. See what works for you and not the airbrushed model pouting from the magazine cover. 

 Style surplus

 Major trends apart, some other noticeable looks will be a luxe sporty statement. Jersey takes a glam route as track pants get jazzed up and bomber jackets are blitzed by Swarovksi. Take a cue from Aki Narulas studded sporty fall-winter 2007 line. Classic Grecian drapes are also big this season, a la Tarun Tahilianis georgette or Gaurav Guptas jersey drapes. Finally, there is a special focus on sleeves. Puffed, exaggerated, churi, fitted, tapered, kimono, boxy, draped, rolled up. The sleeve story goes on and on.

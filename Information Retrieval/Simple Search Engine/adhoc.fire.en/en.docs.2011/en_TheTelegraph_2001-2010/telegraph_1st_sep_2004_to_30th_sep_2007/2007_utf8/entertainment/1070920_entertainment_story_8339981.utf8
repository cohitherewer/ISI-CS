 Rhythm eternal

 Dhakis from West Bengal, khol players from Manipur, dhamsa players from Jharkhand, thavil (a south Indian temple drum) players from Chennai, Cuban beats on the cajon (a box drum originally used by the slaves in South American colonies to combat the governments ban on music) and African drums came together in an extravaganza of percussion at Swabhumi on Sunday night. Tabla maestro Tanmoy Bose, with his Taal Tantra project and classical and folk artistes, regaled the audience at the concert titled Sound of Soil. Our concert was designed around these folk artistes. Modern inputs were used to centralise their rhythms rather than obscure it, thereby recognising their art, said Bose. 

 The evening began with a Mangalam Arati and moved into a piece called Pancha Dhwani celebrating the five elements. The artistes from West Bengal also included Kartick Das Baul and Ghulam Fakir, bringing with them the rich heritage and philosophy of Ananta Jibon or the life eternal. Ghulam hails from a village called Gorbhanga in Nadia. The particular type of Murshidi songs that Ghulam sings is a tradition in Bengal which goes back hundreds of years but is hardly practiced anymore, said Bose. Ghulam was discovered by a group of youngsters who call themselves the Calcutta Cycle and work on musical projects with folk artistes. Along with Ghulam, Kartick Das Baul regaled the audience with a beautiful piece called Sadhana.

 The audience was also treated to a visual treat through the Kalaripayattu and Chhau performances. The curtain call was a piece called Communion that showcased about 10 dhakis, khol players, South American and Indian percussion elements added by Bose and Ratul Shankar Ghosh, followed by a rendition of the Ganesh Vandana by Pandit Debasish Bhattacharya.

 Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week has chosen Rohit Bal as the finale designer to close the weeklong fashion festivities in Delhi next month. The designer made a day trip to the city on Wednesday to show a ldquo;very small tip of the iceberg rdquo; of his collection titled Intertwined. Modelled by Sheetal Malhar, Bhavna Sharma, Sonalika Sahay, Sahil and Aryan, the afternoon was moderated by Jessica as the city got a glimpse at what is in store for next season rsquo;s style.

 Intertwined, set to rock the ramp at Delhi rsquo;s Pragati Maidan on the night of September 9, is inspired by the ldquo;ancient styles of Iznik in Turkey rdquo;. Dubbed Syahi by Gudda (what the fash frat calls him), the collection rsquo;s mainstay is ink blue, a colour that finds such a prominent place in Iznik tiles of Turkey.

 ldquo;The silhouettes are like Koyla, my last season rsquo;s collection, but only more mad, rdquo; smiled Rohit. Like always, Indian craftsmanship and detailing are present in his ldquo;avant-garde and modern rdquo; line. t2 caught up with the man for a rapid fire. And yes, Rohit did rock.

 No preferences. I hate them both as much!

 It is more professional and less bitchy. 

 Two bad ways that the industry has changed in the past three decades hellip; 

 It still needs to be professional and a lot less bitchy.

 (Long pause) Still tacky. 

 Delhi vs Mumbai brigade hellip;

 There rsquo;s not much of a comparison. Delhi is way ahead.

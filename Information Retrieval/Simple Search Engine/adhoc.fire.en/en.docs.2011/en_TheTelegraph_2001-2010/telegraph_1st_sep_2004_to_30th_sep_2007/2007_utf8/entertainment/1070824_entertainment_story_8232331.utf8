The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Gameland goes to Bollywood

 Reach Salman Khans house, sneak past the guard dogs, get into his drawing room, click him striking one of his brawny poses and get rich quick. Thats what a gaming portal challenges you to do. And there is much more action to get you closer to the hunk. Virtually, of course.

 Salman Khan now has a gaming zone styled after him, called www.zapak.com/salmanzone.z. Puppy Razi was one of the first games we had introduced when our brand was launched. It has been very successful. So we wanted to create a whole range of games centred around the star, says Rohit Sharma, COO of Zapak.com. 

 The next thing they did was approach Khan himself. Salman plays games on his mobile and gave us a broad overview of the kind of games he would like in his zone. He wanted games on racing, painting and kite-flying. Though the games were developed by our researchers, he was consulted at every stage, says Sharma. One result of that is the guard dogs in Puppy Razi are named Myjaan and Myson, after Salmans grand mastiffs. 

 While he is busy filling up canvases for an exhibition to fund his charity in real life, the virtual artist, in the game Art Attack, asks the player to figure out what he is drawing before a paint can, which acts as a timer and empties out. 

 While it is not known whether Salman flies kites, in another game called Kite Fight, he seeks help to cut as many kites in his way as he can. The kite is tied behind Salmans bike which zooms ahead, giving the kite the much-needed lift. The birds have to be avoided to guard against losing penalty points. 

 The fourth game in the zone is called Safe Mode. In this game, Salman is racing in a championship, but the goal is safe driving and not turning into a road bully. Rather ironic, all considered.

 The gamer has to follow traffic rules for road safety like watching out for pedestrians, stopping at signals and following the speed limit in the Speed Limit Zone to accumulate points. The arrow keys are used to drive, P for pausing or resuming the game and the spacebar for blowing the horn in order to overtake. 

 Every time the gamer breaks a traffic rule, he gets a ticket from the traffic havaldar. He loses if he gets five traffic tickets from the policeman or if he runs over a pedestrian. One wonders how much Salman himself, booked for rash driving and running over a man a few years ago, would score in this race!

 Black beauty

 Fleetmaster

 Year: 1947

 Registration: WBC 

 4547

 Genesis: 

 The 1947 Chevy was a handsome car. It wasnt low-slung 

 and modern like the first post-war Studebakers, or streamlined 

 like the contemporary Packard, but it certainly was handsome. 

 This car was the last chapter in the history of a model 

 line that started in mid-1941.

 While the 1942 Chevy appeared quite new with its low, 

 wide grillework and headlights smoothly blended into front 

 fenders that flowed Buick-like into the doors, the underpinnings 

 were much as had come before. Civilian automobile production 

 shut down to make room for war production in early February. 

 A number of 1942 models, held in storage for high 

 priority buyers by the Office of Price Administration, 

 were slowly released after June 1943. These were all blackout 

 models. 

 This period saw the start of the car famine. By 1946, America 

 needed new cars. The old ones were worn out and replacement 

 parts were in short supply. Most of the American manufactures 

 were then cranking out face-lifted 1942 models. Chevy installed 

 a wider, less fussy grille and started selling all it could 

 build. The 47 Chevrolets sported an even wider, more attractive 

 and cleaner grille and more up-to-date side trim. Sales 

 were booming. Chevy set an all-time convertible sales record 

 when it produced 28,443 units. But the Chevy started to 

 look old by 1948. Nash, Packard, and Hudson had introduced 

 their versions of Buck Rodgers space rocket and GM wasnt 

 ready to show its next generation of cars until 1949. The 

 48 was the last and the best of its pre-war line.

 Line of ownership: Sanjay 

 Ghoshs maternal grandfather Justice J.P. Mitter bought 

 the Fleetmaster for his personal use from Walford Transport 

 Company in 1947 for Rs 7,000. The car was used regularly 

 and today retains most of its original parts.

 Maintenance: The 

 overhead 29.4 HP Straight 6 engine was overhauled after 

 it covered 2,60,000 miles. The car has made several long 

 hauls between Calcutta and the Ghoshs ancestral house 

 in Allahabad. New pistons, new rings, fresh 

 bearings were added. The suspension was overhauled, four 

 shockers, ball bearings, bushes changed, the servo-assisted 

 gear-box revamped. 

 Coachwork: 

 Sidewall tyres have replaced the originals. The car has 

 been painted several times with the last coat being spartan 

 black. The upholstery is in brown corduroy with a matching 

 suede ceiling and thick woollen carpeting.

 This Fleetmaster is a rallier and has been in rallies since 

 1992. It has had podium finishes on 11 occasions and has 

 won 30 trophies overall competing with the best of brands 

 like Cadillacs, Buicks, Triumphs, MGs and Jags.

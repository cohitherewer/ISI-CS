The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 fine as a fiat

 - The new PALIO STILE sports cool looks and is lighter on the pocket

 The Fiat Palio, when it was launched for the first time in India in September 2001, was the most butch car among hatchbacks on Indian roads. An

 Italian thoroughbred, designed by Goiregetto Giugiaro, it was wide bodied with flowing lines and came with that twangy orange colour that stood out 

 on Indian roads. But the car drew a lot of flak for fuel economy, pricing, spares, 

 to name just a few. And as Tata Motors tied up with Fiat this year, the first step 

 for the JV has been to send Palio back to the drawing board. 

 Fresh out of the factory, prior to the grand launch of Grande Punto and 

 Linea next year, Palio Stile 1.1 and 1.6 petrol variants are revving again. To address the fuel factor is a downsized 1108 cc 56 bhp 8-valver that replaces the 

 1242cc, 72-bhp 8 valver, the rationale being a smaller engine will consume less 

 fuel. The revamped 1.1 pumps out 57 PS @5250 rpm and delivers a torque of 92 

 Nm @ 2750 rpm. Consequently, the company has also lowered the kerb weight 

 of Palio Stile by 25 kg and the price too by Rs 50,000. So for those looking for 

 more power and torque, Palio Stile 1.6 Sport generates 100 PS @ 5500 rpm with 

 137 Nm @ 4250 rpm and is the only sporty B-segment hatchback in India! 

 Slotting it in the first gear and edging out of chock-a-block traffic on Prafulla Sarkar Street, the Palio Stile felt sturdy, manoeuvrable and dependable. 

 But as you hit second and then third gears on less congested streets, the deliverable torque is not easily available. Cane the engine and it rsquo;s fast though mdash; in 

 the mid-range it gives you decent power and torque. So those who are used to 

 pre-multi-injection engines should have no problem with the Stile at all. 

 The wheelbase has been stretched by 64 mm and the space inside is comfortable. While the company claims that 15.5 kmpl is not quite achievable for 

 lesser seasoned drivers, in its second innings, the Palio should give a good 

 mileage of 14 kmpl. However, what Fiat can really bank on to boost sales is the 

 extensive dealership network and servicing points of Tata Motors.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Awesome All-rounders

 Meet the uber-talented pair fighting it out to be the Confidence Champion

Seven special kids from across the country fight it out to be named the nations next Confidence Champion. Among them are two extremely bright and talented youngsters from Calcutta: santoor player Rhitam Bhattacharya and academic whiz Ameetosri Basu.

 Cadbury Bournvita Confidence Academy, being aired Sundays at noon on Pogo, has brought together child champs of go-karting, music and even magic! This 13-episode game show, judged by Derek Brien, rewards kids for their ability to go beyond their own fields of expertise to teach their skills to their peers, and learn their opponents talents. The concept of what parents want from their kids has changed from to know and know to know and grow, which basically translates into a combination of knowledge and development of ones soft skills, says Brien, the man behind the show which is as much about teaching as it is about learning. 

 And they all had a blast doing it. Rhitam, a 14-year-old student of DPS Ruby Park, had to teach the other six contestants to play the santoor along with percussion and rhythm instruments like the tambourine, mridangam and guitar. Ameetosri, also 14, who received a double promotion from Class V to VII at Modern High School, had to coach her peers ahead of the general knowledge round.

 The son of santoor player Pandit Tarun Bhattacharya and Odissi danseuse Sanchita Bhattacharya, Rhitam discovered his love for the santoor quite accidentally. In fact, the first tune he chose to play was from favourite band Linkin Park. I was always fond of music and used to play the guitar and it was three years ago that I discovered the santoor. Since then I have been practising three to four hours daily, smiles Rhitam. 

 Training under his father in the tradition of the Maihar Gharana, the bubbly youngster is fond of playing around with his fathers compositions. His plans for the future include training in Western classical music to create a new kind of fusion sound with the traditional santoor. Rhitam also counts dancing (breakdance mostly) and computers amongst his many other talents. Who knows, maybe I could become a great hacker someday, laughs the teen.

 Ameetosri has lots of poise and dignity. But it didnt take the quiet girl long to warm up to her Confidence Academy companions, participating in pillow fights and water wars with gusto. I loved being a part of the show as it provided a great platform to dance, sing and act, which I wouldnt have got under ordinary circumstances, because I like doing different kinds of things, admits Ameetosri, who is at the moment caught up with pre-board preparations

 Though Ameetosri plans to undertake a daunting double major in theoretical physics and international relations, there is more to this class topper than brains. She learns the piano, has been taking Bharatnatyam lessons since she was four-and-a-half-years old and is an avid reader whose favourite authors include Asimov, Tolstoy, Tolkien and Maupassant. She is also is an active debater.

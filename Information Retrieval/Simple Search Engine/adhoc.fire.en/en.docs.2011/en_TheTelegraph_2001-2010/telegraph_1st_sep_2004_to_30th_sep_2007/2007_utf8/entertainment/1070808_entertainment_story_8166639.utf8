The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 House proud 

 What: The flagging-off of 48 Hours Sananda Smart Interiors, a series of workshops.

 Where: 2, Justice Chandra Madhab Road (off Elgin Road).

 When: August 4.

 Furniture flourish: The string of workshops has been designed to address the rising demand for imported furniture in the city, that is tailor-made to suit modern-day sensibilities. The series will pack in live interactive sessions, with city-based celebrities and interior designers providing a low-down on how to give your house a new look. The first workshop has been slotted for August 30, between 2pm and 5pm.

 The Saturday afternoon launch saw actor and t2 columnist Sabyasachi Chakraborty with his actress wife Mithu and actress Chaiti Ghosal engaged in a light-hearted chat, sharing their views on who wears the pants when it comes to the choice of curtains and more.

 Voiceover: We will help you make your house look smarter. These workshops are not only meant for women. We think a lot of men will also be interested, says Jaydeep Chitlangia of 48 Hours, a nine-month-old furniture outlet.

 Coastal cuisine

 What: Go Goa, a Goan food festival, and Eelisher Etikatha, a hilsa festival.

 Where: Oceanic and Aaheli at The Peerless Inn.

 When: Till the end of August.

 The spread: The Peerless Inn is offering an exclusive spread of Goan dishes in its multi-cuisine restaurant Oceanic. For fish lovers the a-la-carte menu has Prawn Balchow, Goan Giant Lobster Curry, Rawa Fried Fish, Pomfret and Crab Xac Xac. The lobster curry with plain rice and lemon juice melts in the mouth. Or, dig into the Mutton Vindaloo.

 Since Oceanic specialises in seafood, coastal regions play a very important part. We have tried to maintain authenticity with Goan toddy vinegar, curry paste and wines. There are Indian as well Goan wines to choose from, says F amp;B manager Sumanta Maity.

 Aaheli is hosting Eelisher Etikatha with Ghoti and Bangal dishes. Eelish Tenga is hilsa in a tangy gravy, while Eelish Pulao is fish and basmati rice cooked in fish stock. Also on the menu are Narkol Doodhe Eelish and Kacha Eelisher Jhol. You can go boneless with Dhumrogondh Eelish.

 Everyone was bored with the old dishes. To jazz up things, we decided to make some additions to our repertoire, adds Maity.

 Pocket pinch: A meal for two at Oceanic will cost about Rs 1,200 (Rs 2,000 if you go for the lobster). For the hilsa delicacies at Aaheli, expect to pay around Rs 1,200.

 Style special

 What: Rhythm in Colours.

 Where: Rotary Sadan.

 When: 21 September.

 The show: Rhythm in Colours was the cultural programme presented by World Vision, Calcutta, a child-focussed relief and development agency working with people living with HIV. HIV-positive women walked the ramp for a fashion show choreographed by city model Tina Mukherjee, with clothes designed by Sunipa Samadder. The women, from 20 to 40 years of age, sashayed down the ramp in innovative choreographed sequences, some confident, some shy but all of them looking stunning in their finery and makeup.

 The objective was to make these women feel glamorous, beautiful and have a great time as well. These are women who are living with a lot of stigma and difficulties and are rather withdrawn. We had to work really hard to bring them out of their shell and change their concept of what it is to be a model, explained Tina, who worked with these women for five days to perfect their walk and attitude. Sunipas clothes emphasised comfort, celebrating the overall theme of colour.

 Voiceover: We wanted to do something to remove the stigma by bringing these women under the spotlight, said Biju Abraham, programme manager of the AIDS India project at World Vision.

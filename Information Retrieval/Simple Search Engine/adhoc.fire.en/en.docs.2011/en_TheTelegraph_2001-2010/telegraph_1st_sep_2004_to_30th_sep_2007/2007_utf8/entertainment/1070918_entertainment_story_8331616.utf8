The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Fashion fusion

 In town for the Sunfeast Open 2007, tennis stars scorched the ramp alongside top models.

 Since Monday the action has been on the tennis court. But a day ahead of the third edition of the Sunfeast Open 2007, the crowd at the Pala banquet at The Sonar Calcutta witnessed energy off court as well. Thirteen tennis stars scorched the ramp along with top ramp walkers Jesse Randhawa, Candice Pinto, Alicia Raut, Sanya Shaikh and others at a fashion show that showcased ensembles from Miss Players, a fashion wear line from the ITC stable. 

 ldquo;It was a sports and fashion fusion hellip; an event that showcased the glamour in the sport and allowed the players to have some fun, rdquo; said Ravi Naware, divisional chief executive, ITC Ltd (foods business).

 Mood meter

 It was 7.30pm and the white chairs were fast filling up. Large screens on either side of the stage provided glimpses of fashion wear by Miss Players brand endorser Amrita Rao. The audience comprised well-heeled socialites and also spotted were some young fans cheering on their favourite tennis stars. Only this time, the 200 or so in the audience were all set to cheer their sporting champs for their style not strokes. For a flavour closer home, palmists, potters, bangle-sellers and mehndi-artists took their place at the back of the hall.

 Fashion fever

 Party and casual, formal and informal mdash; every wardrobe requirement stormed the stage in turns. Choreographed by t2 columnist and grooming coach Achla Sachdev, the collections painted the stage in colour sequences. First up was passionate red. Halter necks, off-shoulders, tights hellip;. Pink, purple and yellow followed. Sexy and short, snug and a few inches above the knee mdash; when the event is a prelude to a tennis tournament, skirts with a sporty feel are bound to make a statement. And then there were the formal skirts and those hip-huggers. Silk tops, well-fitted trousers, corset tops, tee-on-tees, denim dungarees, capris, leggings, tunics, tiny jackets and knotted shirts that came in splashes of black, white, orange, blue and more. Pointed high-heeled ballerinas teamed with striped socks introduced a winter fashion flavour.

 Tennis turn

 When you spend most of tour time sweating it out on grass or clay, mastering backhands and forehands, acing the ramp is definitely untried territory. So for the 13 international sports stars, adrenaline was at an all-time high.

 Vocalist Shazneen, Merlin D'Souza on the piano and Rhys on the saxophone provided live music for the girls. For 19-year-old Ekaterina Ivanova, ldquo;the peppy music definitely helped rdquo;. ldquo;I was nervous and when on stage, in front of the crowd, my first reaction was lsquo;oh-my-God rsquo;! But I kept my calm thankfully. I am in good form and the game on court is definitely easier, rdquo; smiled the Russian in denim hot pants and a red tee. 

 While some chose to sizzle in black cocktail numbers and silk uppers, others sported a cool and casual look. Smiles in place, poised walks and constant encouragement from the crowd ensured that the girls rocked. A few flaunted painted nails and stilettos, but for most comfort ruled. So sneakers and chappals were seen aplenty. ldquo;Nerve-racking rdquo;, was how ldquo;been-there-done-that rdquo; Sunitha Rao described her ramp affair. 

 Twenty-year-old Yaroslava Shvedova looked all set for a business meet in a formal skirt and top. ldquo;Backstage, I was keeping a close look at how the models were doing their job. My tryst with fashion was different, rdquo; smiled the Russian.

 After posing for the camera, they were back to their sporty selves. ldquo;I wouldn rsquo;t give up tennis for the world, rdquo; signed off Sunitha. 

 Tennis rsquo;s gain is fashion rsquo;s loss.

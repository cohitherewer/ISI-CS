 Beyond lager

 There is a glimmer of hope that the city will get a taste of more than the mass-produced kinds of beer, finds Shaun Kenworthy

 People are finally starting to talk seriously about 

 the idea of opening up microbreweries in India. A 

 friend of mine has just spent the past one year try

 ing to get an amendment to change the excise law to 

 make the idea of a bar with a microbrewery inside a 

 possibility. 

 I used to work in a restaurant in Manchester about 

 12 years ago that had a microbrewery running up 

 through four floors. One floor for each stage of the brew

 ing process. It used to take somewhere in the region of 

 four weeks from the mash, to the stage where it was 

 drinkable. We brewed one simple German-style pilsner 

 beer. That was our staple, if you like. We also brewed a 

 wheat beer, which was slightly cloudy, a peach beer 

 which had a slight taste of peaches and a blackcurrant 

 stout which was black with a good creamy head. There 

 were a few others that popped up throughout the year mdash; 

 a green beer for St Patrick rsquo;s Day, a strawberry beer in 

 the summer and an Xmas beer. Again a stout but with a 

 slightly spicy flavour (nutmeg, cinnamon, orange peel, 

 etc).

 Yellow, brown, black, call it what you want, but to me 

 it rsquo;s all beer. It may come with all sorts of different 

 names and in all manner of different packages but it rsquo;s 

 all just the same variation of fermentation of hops, 

 wheat or other grains. It comes in the category of being 

 one of the most social of all forms of alcohol because 

 unless you drink vast quantities of the liquid, you rsquo;re 

 not going to get that drunk that quickly. Not always the 

 case, though, let me assure you. I have a number of 

 heavily drunken nights behind me when I was much 

 younger, usually after the rugby on Saturday, when my 

 friends and I had gone out on the town celebrating victo

 ries or miserably questioning each other why we had 

 lost. Now I know I rsquo;m going against the grain here, but 

 it rsquo;s also social as it can help you open up a bit which in 

 all reality can rsquo;t be such a bad thing as far as I rsquo;m con

 cerned.

 The brewing of beer is nothing new. Early records 

 date back around 6,000 years and historians believe that 

 it first probably occurred when a piece of bread or some 

 wheat got wet and started to ferment. There have been 

 poems written about it, songs sung, festivals made for it 

 and marriages broken because of it! And probably put 

 back together because of it also! 

 Oktoberfest, the beer festival, may have started in 

 Germany but now is celebrated all over the world. It 

 started on October 12, 1810 and was a celebration of the 

 wedding of King Ludwig to Princess Therese and car

 ried on for five days. The festival was so popular that it 

 was allowed to be repeated by royal decree. During 

 those times, no beer was drunk; this only started in 1918 

 when a licence was given to sell beer and meals. Things 

 like a carousel, swings and clay pigeon shooting were 

 also put in place so people could amuse themselves. 

 Soon after, every brewery in Munich got permission to 

 sell beer during the festival and hence, this is what it rsquo;s known for 

 today. 

 Here are a few facts stolen from the Internet. Today, on the same 

 meadow where the wedding was first held, there are 800 market 

 stalls, about 4,000,000 litres of beer are drunk, 500,000 chickens are 

 eaten and the festival commences with the first mug of beer being 

 passed to the Bavarian prime minister. After that moment, the festi

 val carries on for 16 days

 I rsquo;ve found myself playing around with beer in food preparations 

 over the years mdash; beef in Guinness is an old British favourite. I rsquo;ve 

 even made beer ice cream and lager and lime sorbet in the past which 

 were both big winners.

 BEEF WITH STOUT AND 

 DRIED FRUITS 

 Here is a simple recipe that 

 I rsquo;ve just made up for the 

 occasion, along the lines 

 of a classic beef stew with 

 Guinness. 

 Heat around 3 tbsp of 

 either butter or olive oil in 

 a largish cooking pot and 

 saute around 500g of lean 

 diced beef till browned. 

 Next, add 200g each of im

 ported dried apricots and 

 prunes. Then add three cin

 namon sticks, 2 tsp of ground roasted garam masala, 

 700ml stout and freshly ground pepper and salt to 

 taste. Bring to the boil and reduce the heat. Simmer 

 tightly covered for around 90 minutes or till the meat 

 is tender; by this time, the dried fruits will have thick

 ened the juices to make a deliciously rich, sumptuous 

 gravy. Serve with steaming hot buttery rice and enjoy.

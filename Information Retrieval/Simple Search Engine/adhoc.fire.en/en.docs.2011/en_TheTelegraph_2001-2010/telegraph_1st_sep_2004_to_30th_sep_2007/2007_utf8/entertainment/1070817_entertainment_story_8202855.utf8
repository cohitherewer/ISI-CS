 Jungle Book

 Saranda was eerie and desolate,

 I wasnt too keen on Saranda but we wanted to go on a short trip, so I didnt mind. We drove all the way and it was a very rough ride. Luckily, I had a new car on this trip; the old one wouldnt have stood a chance. 

 The Steel Authority of India (SAIL) had arranged our stay in their guesthouse. Saranda has a beautiful resthouse deep inside the forest, called Thalkobad, but no one stays there. Thalkobad has earned a bad name due to Maoist trouble. 

 Once upon a time, Saranda teemed with wildlife. Now, its a sorry sight trees felled in several places, dry leaves scattered all over. Theres an eerie feel about Saranda. We checked out Thalkobad; theres only one caretaker who looks after it. This spot is practically out of bounds for tourists. A few years back, there was a face-off between a politician who had come here to party and the local people. It had resulted in a killing spree, with the MCC swinging into action. 

 We went to see the two iron ore mines Kiriburu and Meghahatuburu and those were fantastic. Theres some incredible work going on over there. 

 We were invited by the officers club to attend a small function, where we drank a lot. They invited us to stay in Saranda during the monsoon; apparently its very beautiful at that time. 

 Saranda reminds me of another adventurous trip down south. It was in September-October 2003. We roamed four spots Bandipur, Nagarhole, Mudumalai and Ranganathittu. 

 We drove down to Bangalore from Calcutta in three days, a distance of roughly 2,000 km, covering around 680 km a day. Our first stop was at Chilika, then Vijayawada and finally Bangalore. We halted in Bangalore for a day, picked up my friend Anirban, his wife and their kid and headed for Bandipur. 

 East of Bandipur is Tamil Nadu, and west is Kerala. It was Veerappans territory and a fascinating place. We had a memorable time. 

 (Next week: Feluda roams Bandipur and Nagarhole)

The Taj Bengal had an important guest last week Raymond N. Bickson, managing director and CEO of The Indian Hotels Company Limited, Tajs parent company. Bickson was in town for a special screening of Jewels and Marble Palaces, a film made by Zafar Hai for Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces about some of the historic jewels in the Taj crown. He chatted with t2 about the groups plans. Excerpts

 The story so far 

 Taj Bengal is an oasis in Alipore, one of the most beautiful residential areas in the city. We form a vital part of the community and are a meeting point. Ninety per cent of our food and beverage sales comes from residents of the city, not guests of the hotel. Weddings, banquets or meetings Taj Bengal plays an important role in the citys DNA 

 Taj 2

 We are still not present in Rajarhat or Salt Lake. We had land on the Bypass where Silver Spring has come up. We missed that opportunity and the 1.9-acre Taj Gateway near Ruby Hospital is going to make up for it.

 We have 83 hotels in 15 countries across five continents. Out of these, 66 of them are in India. We are a 104-year-old company and all our luxury brands are in prime locations. We enjoy a certain position in all the metropolitan cities.

 Our biggest challenge is to be present in major CBDs (central business districts). Cities are growing and the traditional landscape is changing. Taj Gateway is a hotel modelled on our business brand of hotels because every area cant support rates of the luxury segment, but it can support three/four-star rates. 

 Once they settle down, infrastructure improves and demand rises, they will probably be ready for luxury hotels. Taj Gateway will have 200 rooms, each between 300 and 350 sq ft, an all-day dining room and room service full but not elaborate. Its a nice corner plot and a two-year timeline is what we are looking at. It is important to consolidate our positions in different market segments.

 SWOT analysis 

 Strength: Our room occupancy, average room rates and RevPAR (revenue per available room) premium.

 Weakness: We have no weakness, though upgrading is a continuous process.

 Opportunity: There is a lot of opportunity in a variety of rooms and hotel segments.

 Threat: There hasnt been any new inventory that has come up in the last three-four years in Calcutta. Now we hear of two the restoration of Great Eastern Hotel and Lady Ranus property There is room for everybody to grow.

 Taj Bengal report card 

 Occupancy: Average rate of occupancy is positive.

 Banqueting: We dont have enough space. 

 F amp;B: Were adding a new restaurant within a year.

 Facilities: We have renovated the salon. A spa can come up.

 Expansion plans

 Ginger, our budget brand hotel, is on a roll. The next one is coming up in Agartala. There are going to be five more Ginger hotels in the next four months. 

 Expansion within India apart, I believe that a diverse portfolio abroad is very important to balance out the seasons. It is essential to go beyond borders and so Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces wants to be present in all the key cities of the world. We have to make sure that our loyalty programmes are profitable for all our guests. Some of our new projects are Dubais Palm Finger and properties in Cape Town and Johannesburg. China tops my wish-list!

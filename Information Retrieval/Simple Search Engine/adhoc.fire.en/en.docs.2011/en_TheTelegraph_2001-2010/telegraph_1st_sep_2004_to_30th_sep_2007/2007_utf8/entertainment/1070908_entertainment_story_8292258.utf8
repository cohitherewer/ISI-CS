 Hack hows

 Ethical hacking almost sounds like a misnomer. But experts explain that hacking is nothing but technical adeptness. Theres one group of people who loudly call themselves hackers, but arent. Real hackers call these people, who get a kick out of breaking into computers, crackers and have nothing to do with them. 

 The goal of the ethical hacker is to take pre-emptive measures against malicious attacks, which have now evolved into organised crime, said Manohar Malani, CEO, NCS Computech, organisers of a two-day workshop on ethical hacking at the Hyatt on August 31. 

 Hacker or cracker, white hat (hired ethical hackers) or black hat (hackers with unscrupulous intent), as the number of Internet users are fast increasing, so is cyber crime, making this discussion a crucial one.

 Organisations like Coal India, The Assembly of God Church, Metro Railway, Spencers Retail and Webel Informatics took part in the meet. Although hacking is something that is restricted to government and corporate institutions, security at home is equally important, said Malani.

 Imagine losing a blank cheque and then wondering what happened to your bank balance! Thats what an insecure portal is like. An IP address, from where mails are fired, is like an authentic company letterhead. Its important to keep it secure and we hope to familiarise participants with the kind of attacks their systems are exposed to, stressed Malani. The aim of the workshop was knowing your enemies before they know you. 

 The experts also envision a world where all financial transactions will happen online. People are using ATMs today. In coming years, they are bound to shift to the Internet. Thats when they will realise the need for security of their systems, said Debesh Das, Bengal IT minister. 

 You can best catch a thief by thinking like one. So the workshop taught participants how to scan, test, hack and secure their own systems.

 Left with laughter punched out of us...

 Classic Scene 

 Jean-Luc Godard

 Pierrot Le Fou

Jean-Luc Godard, the most incorrigible of the Nouvelle Vague directors, is remembered for pushing the boundaries of all conceivable art forms to create something bold and unique. His movies, by design, revolt against cinematic convention and slip into the abyss of self-reflexive cinema.

 Pierrot Le Fou, being one of his most mature works, creatively embodies all of this and more its comedy is a scathing indictment of capitalism and a telling critique of contemporary society. Not only was this noted for its technical and narrative innovativeness but also for the use of its Eastmancolour pallete with an extensive use of red and blue.

 The film follows Ferdinand (Jean-Paul Belmodo) fleeing a stultifying bourgeois existence with his high- spirited lover Marianne (Anna Karina) in search of a romantic Utopia. Thematically a much darker and more substantial film than his previous works, the films pessimistic vision of romantic relationships escalates from mere betrayal and disillusionment to murder and a most dramatic suicide.

 Their flight to southern France becomes a spontaneous series of bizarre incidents, which leads to their temporary separation. Later, after their eventual reunion, Marianne uses Ferdinand to get a suitcase full of money from gangsters, before running away with her real boyfriend, whom she had previously referred to as her brother.

 The climatic end that follows is unforgettable. Pierrot, having been heartlessly betrayed by Marianne, demonstrates his frustration by killing her and her boyfriend in a shootout, paints his face blue and wires himself up with dynamite and decides to blow himself up with red and yellow dynamite. As the scene proceeds, the camera takes a close-up and he is strangely handcuffed to be a sadly ridiculous figure.

 Regretting his decision he reacts with the words Oh, this is stupid and tries to extinguish the fuse. In an instant its comedy engineered by Godard where he successfully distils the notion of death and we are left with laughter punched out of us as the dynamite explodes and he dies in a flash of flame and smoke against the brilliant blue of the Mediterranean sea and sky.

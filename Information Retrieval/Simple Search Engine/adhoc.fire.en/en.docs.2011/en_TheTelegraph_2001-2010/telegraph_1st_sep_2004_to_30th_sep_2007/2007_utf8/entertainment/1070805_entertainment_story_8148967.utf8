Priyanshu Chatterjee played a villain opposite Jeet in Bidhaatar Lekha, but the handsome star of Tum Bin wanted to be a hero in Bengal. The opportunity came in the form of Swapan Sahas Aamar Pratigya. Here. Priyanshu gets to romance Priyanka Trivedi, the Saathi girl who made a comeback last year with Agnipariksha but is yet to recover lost ground. 

 After Bidhaatar Lekha, I wanted to do a proper commercial film, and what better than a Swapan Saha film, smiles Priyanshu at Technicians Studio. He plays a rich boy who stands against all odds.

 Inspiring him in his mission is lady love Priyanka. I keep getting offers, but I have my family back in Bangalore. This film will be shot in Hyderabad, which is closer home. Besides, a Bengali film gives me the chance to catch up with friends and family in Calcutta. My kids are very happy to meet their naani too, laughs Priyanka.

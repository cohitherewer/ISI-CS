 The Kankurgachhi Reid amp; Taylor opened its doors in 2004. Recently, with women walking in and requesting ensembles for themselves, the outlet decided to add a feminine dimension to their venture.

 Sachi Sarees, at P-58 CIT Road Scheme-VII M (opposite Kankurgachhi ESI Hospital), came up on September 14 this year. We wanted to cash in on the festive season, says director Naveen Agarwal.

 The decor

 The Reid amp; Taylor showroom leads you to the 2,250-sq-ft basement store. Old-school motifs have been clubbed with contemporary elements. A colour code in gold and pastel makes for a swank ambience. Glass on pillars and scroll designs on the walls and floors adorn it further. The flooring is an Italian marble and vitrified tile combo. Low seaters in pale green and ochre take care of tired feet. 

 The collection

 Sachi is home to saris, suits and tunics. Georgette, chiffon, crepe, Benarasi weaves, net, crepe-silk, cotton-silk, chanderi-silk, katan-silk. The fabric story is wide and varied. The colour palette offers dusty greys, onion pink, pastels, red, black, maroon and more. 

 Orange, turquoise, burgundy, and sunflower yellow are perfect for weddings and receptions. Patterns ethnic and geometric have been formed with prints, crochet work, leather embellishment, Parsi work, cut work, Kashmiri embroidery and a host of other hand embroidery. 

 In saris, georgettes with pita work, pearl and sequin adornments and intricate Parsi work on chiffon look pretty. For a bold and beautiful style statement, pick up animal print drapes. Salwar suits stitched, semi-stitched or unstitched in cotton are popular picks. Short kurtis in empire-lines and those with shrugs are suitable buys for trendy teens. 

 While saris start at Rs 485, the suits come for Rs 995-plus. Kurtis are tagged at Rs 895-plus.

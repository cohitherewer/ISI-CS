 Lets celebrate life

 JAIDEEP SAHNI 

 rewinds his writing lines, from organised crime to women rsquo;s hockey

 A Computer Engineering graduate Jaideep Sahni worked in IT consultation before moving on to advertising. This was followed by stints in ad film-making. Then he became an independent communication consultant for brands and organisations, but it was movies where Jaideep was destined to be. Turning screenwriter with Ram Gopal Varmas Jungle, he went on to write some of the biggest hits of the last five years. Heres how Jaideep scripted success, from Company to Chak De India.

 Company

 My fathers a civil servant, my mothers a teacher. What the hell would I know about organised crime? But once we started researching, we researched everything from Colombian underworld to the Italian mafia to the Red triads. And the story is same everywhere. Guys get together in business, make a lot of money and then they fall apart. And because it is the business of crime, you dont resign, you get killed. We gave Company a certain larger-than-life, but very realistic form. It was a highly designed film. Ramu and I were very afraid that Satya had already come out and nobody will watch Company. Out of that fear we created a very adrenaline form. I had written the song Ganda hai par dhanda hai yeh as part of the script.

 It was all born out of our insecurities.

Khosla Ka Ghosla

 It had happened in my family. When I was small, it happened to my aunt. The day of their daughters wedding they found out that their plot of land was gone. The entire first half of the film is what happened to my aunt. The second half was my fantasy of how it could have happened. In real life we had to sell the plot of land and share half of the money. After the world of organised crime, I wanted to run back to Mummy Papa. So it was a blessing.

 Bunty Aur Babli

 During my advertising years, I had done a lot of small-town work, a lot of work with UNICEF. And I started realising in all that touring around small towns that they were not the do bigha zameen we had grown up in. They were changing damn fast. You find these boys sitting together under a tree watching Baywatch together. The volume is turned off because they cant understand the language, but the rest is quite universal, actually. They are getting the same 250 cable channels that someone in South Extension or Cuffe Parade or Shakespeare Sarani is getting. They are bound to have the same dreams. That is how Bunty and Babli originated. Now the form of the film was more mainstream. Our intention was to form a bridge between the small towns and what is supposedly Shining India. And we didnt want to build a sorry bridge. Shaad (Ali) was born in Kanpur. I had done my engineering in a town called Bidar in Karnataka. We decided to celebrate small towns. 

 Chak De India

 Between Company and Khosla Ka Ghosla, I read a small news clipping about the Indian womens hockey team doing well at a championship. It was all of 10 cc. If the cricket guys would have done it, it would have been the whole damn page. The subject didnt leave me. Then I began researching. It led to all Indian sports that were not cricket. I also noticed how the womens hockey team was rising. I told Adi about the idea. He said that the film has to be made. Then Shimit came in. What we didnt realise was that we had bitten off more than we can chew. It had become huge. Hockey is not like cricket where you can join separate shots and make it look perfect. So all the girls had to learn to play. Where do you get players who can act? Or where do you get actors who can play? This search for all these girls took seven-eight months. Then we shortlisted them. We thought now it will be easy. But it turned out to be a camp. From 4.30 in the morning they would play till lunchtime. Then their acting classes would start. After evening tea, their dialect lessons will start. Then because of all the injuries, sauna and steam and physio will start. This went on for half a year. So, it ended up being a damn tough film. Its an action film, its drama, its hockey... But we finally achieved it all together. Hopefully, tomorrow when a girl picks up a hockey stick, her father wouldnt slap her.

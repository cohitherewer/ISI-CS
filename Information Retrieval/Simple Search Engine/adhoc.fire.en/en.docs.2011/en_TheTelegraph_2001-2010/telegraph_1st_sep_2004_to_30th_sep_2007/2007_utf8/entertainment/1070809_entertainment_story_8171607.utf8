The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Street food 

 special

 HOTHANGOUT

 The phuchka at Vivekananda 

 Park is a must-have on a foodies list. Picture

 WHAT: Vivekananda Park. 

 Or more specifically, the street food strip on one side 

 of it.

 WHERE: Off Southern Avenue.

 WHY: Calcutta lives by 

 its stomach and roadside food provides not only sustenance 

 but also spirit. So it doesnt matter whether it is 

 the peak of the summer heat or a late, chilly evening, students 

 still make a beeline for the snack stalls around Vivekananda 

 Park for their fix of their favourite treats chaat, 

 phuchka, lemon tea all at throwaway prices.

 VP is a part of my life, 

 really. Since my childhood I have been coming here to eat 

 after playing football in the park, says Mourjo Chatterjee, 

 a recent graduate from Ashutosh College. Arnesha Das, a 

 Manipal University student, feels that VP is the true Bengali 

 cha-adda initiator in south Calcutta with original 

 ambience. The lemon tea, a drag of a cigarette 

 and long hours of casual conversation with friends is what 

 VP is all about, she says.

 THE SPREAD: Prices spiralling 

 up, up and away at restaurants? Have no fear, VP has a buffet 

 to beat the best. Its the phuchka and 

 chaat that really drag us here, smiles Ashmita 

 Chakraborty, a law student. If you havent tried 

 the batatapuri out here, you are missing out on something 

 great, says Pooja Ghatok, St. Xaviers student. 

 Eating at VP is a lot more than just casual evening 

 snacking with dahi phuchka, churmur, soda 

 shikanji and ice-cream on offer, adds JU student 

 Debdutta Ganguly. 

 By street food standards, the 

 consensus is that it is slightly overpriced, 

 but that rarely comes in the way of a solid tuck-in. It 

 is okay to pay a little more for good stuff. I have never 

 heard anyone complaining of stomach upset or food poisoning 

 after having eaten here, points out Mourjo. The icing 

 on the cake is the warmth with which they are 

 welcomed every time they arrive.

 But VP is about much more than 

 just food. It has witnessed a lot of new romance and 

 also a good share of heartbreak. Its one place were 

 everyone minds their own business and lets love grow, 

 smiles Neepa Mitra, a Xaverian. 

 DOWNSIDE: Despite the sun 

 or the rain, everyone seems to love VP being outdoors. Its 

 the perfect hangout for Calcutta summer. The slow breeze, 

 the casual atmosphere, the huge trees make it very relaxing, 

 says Neepa. The cater-to-your-car convenience while 

 its raining definitely earns the VP stall-owners extra 

 points, adds Pooja.

 But its not always sunny-side-up 

 for VP. We often have to leave VP earlier than we 

 want because the badly-lit area makes it very unsafe, 

 says Pooja. Debdutta complains that it gets unbearably 

 muddy during monsoon.

 The open garbage vat located a 

 little away from the stalls is the worst feature of the 

 favourite hangout, which raises plenty of questions about 

 hygiene and maintenance, or the lack of it.

 But at the end of the day, students 

 are willing to ignore these blemishes, continuing to flock 

 there whenever they are in the mood for a chatpata snack 

 or a chilled-out evening. And VP never lets them down.

 Kunal Kapoor may be a hunk, but he could still do with a few more kilos 

I am 29 years old, 5-ft-7, and weigh 51 kg. Before giving birth to my baby I was 62 kg. I have no health problems and enjoy eating very much. How can I get back to my normal weight? Please suggest a diet chart. I stay mostly at home.

 You need to gain five to eight kg. This diet chart should do the trick:

 Breakfast: muesli, three tbsp; milk, one glass; one banana

 Midmorning: cashews, two tbsp

 Lunch: Rice, one bowl; dal, one bowl; vegetables with potato, one bowl; fish, two pieces; one serving dessert

 Afternoon: Suji halwa, one bowl

 Evening: Chhena, one bowl

 Dinner: Dal-stuffed roti, two; chicken, four pieces; one serving pudding

 Supper: Milk, one glass with nutritional mix.

 Go for a 15-minute walk after dinner. It will help digestion.

 I am 43 years old, am 5-ft tall and weigh 54 kg. My THS hormone secretion is high, and cholesterol level is on the maximum side of the normal range. My vital statistics are 37-33-39 and I feel tired and weak. I sweat heavily and have trouble breathing when I walk. I am doing half an hour of freehand exercise. What should my ideal weight be? And can you please draw up a healthy diet chart. How do you calculate your ideal body weight?

 You are not very overweight. Your ideal body weight is around 52 kg. Your main problem seems to be the irregular distribution of fat. This can be solved by proper exercise and diet. As for calculating your ideal body weight, it is based on your age, height, weight, medical complications and other parameters.

 Please start walking for half an hour and then slowly increase it up to one hour. Here is a sample diet for you:

 Breakfast: Brown bread, one slice; egg white; one apple

 Midmorning: Coconut water, one glass

 Lunch: Rice, one cup; dal one bowl; vegetables, one bowl; fish, one piece

 Afternoon: Two protein biscuits

 Dinner: Two rotis, vegetables one bowl; salad, one bowl; chicken, two pieces.

 I am a 20-year-old college student, am 5-ft-9 and weigh 54.4 kg. I am very slim and suffer from stomach problems. I cant digest milk. I do not get time to work out. How can I gain weight?

 Tuhin Purkayastha

 Your ideal body weight is around 60 kg. So you need to gain six kg. Always drink boiled water and avoid eating food from outside totally. Here is a diet plan for you:

 Breakfast: Suji upma with potato, 1 bowl; one egg

 Midmorning: Two bananas

 Lunch: Vegetable pulao; one bowl chhole; chicken, four pieces; one serving dessert

 Afternoon: Four biscuits and two tbsp almonds

 Dinner: Three rotis stuffed with dal; vegetables one bowl; fish, two pieces; halwa, one bowl.

 This diet will help you gain weight. You can take protein supplements but since most supplements are made from milk protein, they wont suit you. You can try taking B-protein supplements. Mix two tbsp in one glass of water and drink it twice a day.

 I am 20 years old, 5-ft-1 and weigh 72 kg. I am a student and have to travel around 60 km a day. I do some freehand exercises. Can you draw a diet chart that will keep me fit as well as help me get proper energy? 

 Satabdi Datta

 Teen trends

 Interior designer Ajay Arya tells you how to balance taste and utility in your teenager rsquo;s room.

It is almost impossible to fathom that a scrawny 13-year-old obsessed with boy bands and computer games and a poised young adult embarking on college or a career are the same person. Youngsters change rapidly during their adolescent years and are notoriously difficult to please. A teenagers bedroom is a real challenge. 

 A room for this age-group must fulfill several functions, which need to be given equal priority. Obviously, the bedroom is primarily for sleeping in. Second, the child needs someplace quiet and properly equipped for homework. Thirdly, they would have friends over listening to music, playing games or just lounging about. All these requirements have probably set you thinking that your child needs the largest room in the house, but everything can be accommodated in a fairly small, stylish and appealing space. 

 BED amp; BEYOND

 Curving contours are an excellent way of bringing life and a sense of movement to a space of any size, and they also serve to delineate different functions without physically dividing the room. 

 Raised areas also add interest and give a sense of separate zones. In a rectangular room, two oval platforms, for example, can be used to mark out areas for a bed and a desk. Where the rounded edge of the bed meets the wall, it will form a boxed-in corner. Use the top ledge for a clock, lamp, etc. Wiring and power points can be neatly concealed inside the box. If the room is not large enough for seating, youngsters will happily lie around on the bed, but make it comfy with plenty of cushions. 

 As these years are some of the most crucial for education and exams, anything that encourages studying has to be good. A desk is essential and doubtless, a computer too. An atmosphere of order and efficiency will help concentration, but the surroundings will also need to be as appealing as possible. If they like the style, they would be induced to sit there more often. 

 A specific place in the bedroom for study perhaps a raised area will help put teenagers in the right frame of mind for school/college work. A change of flooring will also add to the impression of entering a different sphere with another function. Apart from the writing desk, a work station to accommodate their computer is necessary. 

 The right environment and accessories can go a long way towards inspiring a positive attitude to homework and studying. Even simple, inexpensive touches, such as smart, fashionable stationery and colourful files, can help. 

 It is vital for a room to grow with its occupant. Make sure you allow for enough power points, bearing in mind the ever-increasing quantity of gizmos, like music systems, TV, hairdryer etc. It is safer to install extra facilities than risk overloaded plugs and dangerous extension flexes. For everyones sanity, think about sound insulation, too. Its quiet heartless to treat teenagers to a new stereo or an electric guitar, and then expect them to be quiet. 

 KEEP IT COOL 

 A neutral palette of khakis and creams might not instantly spring to mind, but they are the best unisex choice of teenagers. They work really well with geometric patterns. Try to anchor a design around something you have seen them choose for themselves a pattern, checks, a predominant colour. Look for something that gives you a clutch of related tones, some deeper, some paler, so that you can team bed linen and other accessories to fit in.

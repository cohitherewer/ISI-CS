 Shopping abroad

If men (allegedly) have roving eyes, women are no different. They just save it for the shopping spree, an integral part of even those foreign trips that are meant to be business only.

 lSome of the best deals you will get are at duty-free shops in airports. Chocolates and even perfumes are great buys at airports customs will let you go with more than 100 ml liquid in your hand baggage. Plus, its a great way to while away those hours waiting for your flight.

 lWhen shopping abroad, do as the locals do. Pick up a few bargain words in the local language and youll probably get a better deal. Get to know someone whos living there and take him/her along to bring the mark-up levels down.

 Do your homework. Travel when the sales are on. Find out what is worth picking up. 

 Stock up on the currency of the country you are going to. Contrary to popular belief, foreign exchange rates are not lower at airports, so make sure you are getting the best deal. Remember, even a few dollars saved means more shopping.

 Check the VAT, which can increase the price of what you are purchasing and check if youre eligible for a tax-back refund of some kind.

 The downside of being a shopaholic is that you are likely to spot something you cant live without! And it could be a huge item, which would mean shipping it home. Find an insured shipper who can handle large purchases. Otherwise ask the hotel youre staying in to help you out.

 Lastly, dont go overboard with the buys. Shopping isnt always about buying things a lot of it is window-shopping. Easier said than done!

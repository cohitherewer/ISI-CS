The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Itsy bitsy

 Ample ardour

 Pamela Ample Anderson could well 

 be on the verge of quitting TV and films. She is having 

 a ball with her new boyfriend, illusionist Hans Klok and 

 is busy being his assistant for his magic shows. I 

 am enjoying my role on stage alongside him like never before.... 

 There is a lot of love backstage, she smiles. The 

 woman whose red swimsuit act in Baywatch left male 

 viewers around the world wanting to drown and then be rescued 

 by her is said to have been signed up for Kloks Las 

 Vegas magic shows till the end of this year. No more 

 TV or film. This is what I love doing. Its so over 

 the top.... I love theatre. Im having the best time. 

 I want to be in Vegas forever, gushes the 36-DD 

 sex symbol.

 Titbits 

 Keira Knightely is as candid as 

 they come. Especially when it comes to talking about her 

 shortcomings. When Keira was shown as a buxom beauty in 

 her King Arthur posters she shrugged and said, those 

 things certainly werent mine. She went on to 

 tell the Daily Mail: We had an interesting discussion 

 when they said, we want to make them slightly larger 

 and I was like, OK, fine. I honestly dont give 

 a shit. And now Keira has decided to take her 

 hat off to her assets. She has bagged a one-year-contract 

 worth 500,000 pounds to be the face (and body) of perfume 

 giant Chanel. And she dares to bare, with her left breast 

 peeping out from behind a bowlers hat. I dont 

 have any tits, so I cant show cleavage, announces 

 the pretty star of Pirates.

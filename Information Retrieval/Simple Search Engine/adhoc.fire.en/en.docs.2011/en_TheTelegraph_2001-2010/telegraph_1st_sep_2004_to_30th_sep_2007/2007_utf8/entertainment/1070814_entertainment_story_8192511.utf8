 August 10 saw a packed Someplace Else for the third part of the Pub Rock Fest organised by the Rock Street Journal. The show that started at 10pm had the crowds rocking to the music of Delhi-based Half Step Down and a Calcutta favourite, Span.

 In line with the Pub Rock Fest vibe, both bands belted out originals-heavy sets. Half Step Down (HSD) a rockroll band with undertones of reggae, blues and funk comprises Dhaval Mudgal on vocals, Karan Dutta on guitar, Carl Abraham on bass, Srijan Mahajan on drums and Shiv Lumba on keyboard.

 Given the buzz in town about Delhi exports and the Mudgal factor Dhaval is Shubha Mudgals son there was a lot hanging on the half-steppers. Blame it on a bad audio mix or otherwise, the band didnt quite play up to its promise. HSD did its originals the singalong Overture To Outer Space and the bluesy Knocking At The Back of My Head among them to a supportive crowd, but the show never really picked up due to sound glitches.

 Its great playing in Calcutta as the audience really understands the kind of stuff were trying to do, signed off Dhaval. 

 Span whose only cover was the popular traditional drinking song I Wish I Was Single Again enjoyed a cleaner sound. Just back from a Mumbai tour, the band is going places after being well-received at the Channel V Launch Pad.

 Span had the crowd clamouring for more with its originals Dont You Worry, Start It Again, Dry Your Eyes and Does Your Mother Know. All our songs tell stories, said Span frontman Neel Adhikari. If the crowds reaction on Friday night was anything to go by, those were stories well told.

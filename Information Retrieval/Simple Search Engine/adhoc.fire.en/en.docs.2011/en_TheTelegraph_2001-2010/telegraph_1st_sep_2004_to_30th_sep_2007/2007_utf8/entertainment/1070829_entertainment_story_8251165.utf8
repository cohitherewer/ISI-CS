 The fine art of SMS 

 Sex amp; the city

 Brevity is the order of the day in today rsquo;s post-colonial world, feels Chandrima S. Bhattacharya 

 Now that a bank has had to change its name from UTI because it was being mistaken for an infection, its time someone gave acronyms their due respect. We all know the power of words such as QSQT, DDLJ, K3G and KANK. Brevity is the way out of having to spell the whole thing. The age belongs to abbreviations, particularly since the mobile phone and email. 

 SMS speech is empowering. The language, which is flourishing especially in India, is evolving and adding numerous words to the English language, so much so that on certain days I only communicate in SMS-speak. Its the best post-colonial, post-modern strategy to deconstruct the English language. SMS speech perfectly illustrates what Derrida says of language, if he was saying that at all: that finally, its very difficult to know what it means. 

 I will start with the more sophisticated SMS words not the common CU or Gr8 or Lol. Suppose a friend has asked me to take her out for lunch. To her I say: TANSTAAFL. Which means: There aint no such thing as a free lunch. But if she wants to take me out, I say: A3, A3, A3. It means anytime, anywhere, any place, and because its been reduced to such a small word, I can use it forcefully and thrice. When I am asked what my favourite place in the office is, I say: AFK (away from keyboard). When I am back at the keyboard, which is most of the time, I have to send an email saying: BAK (back at keyboard). 

 Then I happen to see the news on Salman Khan not appearing in court, with one television channel playing the shot of the actor striding through a hotel lobby bravely, courageously, holding his head high, the night before the Jodhpur court pronounced the verdict sentencing him to five years. And the next thing he has done is to disappear. How can a man wearing such a skimpy little top and flanked by so many bodyguards go missing? His triceps can be spotted miles away. I FOMCL: Fall out of my chair laughing. Has he been kidnapped? I ROFLOL: Roll on the floor laughing out loud. But next day he surrenders, apparently on the advice of his father, script-writer Salim, who is said to have admonished him thus: Go and face your fate like a man. Avoiding the law will give you a bad image.

 As rightly detected, Salim, with Javed, had written this originally in Hindi, for Deewar, where Nirupa Roy was addressing errant son Amitabh. Jao aur mard ke tarah apni fate ko face karo. Kanoon ka haath bahuth lamba hai, she must have said. I ROTFLMAO: Roll on the floor laughing my ass off. But when Salman surrenders, he is wearing a white tee with sleeves. I just ROTG: Roll on the ground. 

 There are days when I can write full sentences in SMS speak. Instead of I am sorry that I forgot to call you last night, which is 37 characters, I say sry 4gt 2 cal lst nyt, which is only 16 characters. I save space, conserve energy. 

 On certain days I attempt to transcribe classics into SMS speech. I can make Hamlet say: 2 b or nt 2 b/dats da ? I also think the government should equip the unenlightened Indian villages with mobile phones: thats the one certain way of lettering the masses. 

 But there are two problems. I have seen that it takes about the same time to key in AFAIK without the dictionary on and As far as I know in predictive text. Second, India being India and vast, complex and multitudinous, it defies gross generalisations. So while SMS speech thrives, so do extra letters. Otherwise why is the films title spelt Heyy Babyy? 

 We are a growing superpower and we can take every liberty, this way and that, with our former colonisers language.

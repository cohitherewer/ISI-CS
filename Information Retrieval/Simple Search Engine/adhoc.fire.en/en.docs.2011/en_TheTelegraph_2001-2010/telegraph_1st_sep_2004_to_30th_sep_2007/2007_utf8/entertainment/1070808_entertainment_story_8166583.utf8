 You have seen him in films like New Delhi Times and Tamas, but M.K. Raina has chosen to work on stage. With over a 100 theatre productions the most famous are Kabira Khada Bazaar Mein, Karmawali and Andha Yug Raina has straddled several languages, from Kashmiri to Ladakhi, Manipuri to Bengali, for theatre. 

 This September, he goes to Kashmir to conduct a two-month workshop with children and revive the Kashmiri folk tradition of Bhaand. Last week he was in town with his latest directorial offering, Stay Yet A While, at the Rabindra Utsav. 

 t2 caught up with him backstage at GD Birla Sabhagar.

 What is the idea behind Stay Yet A While? Stay 

 Yet A While introduces Tagore and Gandhi in a new light. 

 Gandhi had come to Santiniketan in 1915 and a bond developed 

 between him and Tagore. From the time he left right up to 

 Tagores death, letters flew back and forth between 

 them. The letters encapsulate the freedom movement and the 

 reactions of these two great minds. 

 The play is based on historian Sabyasachi Bhattacharyas book The Mahatma and The Poet. The title is borrowed from Gandhis telegram greeting to Tagore on his last birthday. My actors are not dressed to look like Tagore or Gandhi, though I use real footage from the freedom struggle. I want the audience to pay attention to the text and understand how conflicts can be resolved without malice and violence through political discourse.

 What will be the focus of the workshop in Kashmir? 

 The workshop is an effort to reclaim the cultural space that Kashmir has lost to violence. For 12 years, Bhaand, the only folk theatre form of Kashmir, has been stubbed out as un-Islamic. Bhaand used to be performed almost anywhere in temples where these performances were part of the ritual, as also in dargahs and at Muslim and Hindu weddings. With the lack of practice, these traditions are being forgotten. We will try to initiate the children of some traditional performers into the art of their forefathers. 

 How do you intend to go about it? That we can only decide 

 when we meet these 60-70 children. Our approach is always 

 developed on the spot. But we never work only with theatre. 

 I have a multidisciplinary team of musicians, writers and 

 painters. We plan to introduce the children of the Bhaand 

 community to modern concepts of theatre.

 Do you feel any change in Calcuttas theatre scenario? 

 The passion for theatre is still very alive in Calcutta. 

 I feel at home here. I had directed Gorkys Mother 

 as Maa in Bengali with Rangakarmee, and I had acted 

 in Mrinal Sens Genesis. Two years back, I was 

 here with a Punjabi production, Buhe Barian.

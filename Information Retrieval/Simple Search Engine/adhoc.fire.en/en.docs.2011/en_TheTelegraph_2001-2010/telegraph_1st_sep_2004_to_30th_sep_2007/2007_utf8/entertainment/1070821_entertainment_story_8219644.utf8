 Love amp; longing

 They were destined to meet. Thus opens the longish trailer of Sudhir Mishras much-awaited ode to Indian cinema of the 1950s Khoya Khoya Chand. And so they meet. Zafar and Nikhat. Zafar is the romantic writer-director, played by Shiney Ahuja, and Nikhat the beautiful screen diva played by Soha Ali Khan.

 And just how it must take place in the movie, they fall in love in the promo with a playful, simple and conversational Shantanu Moitra song Behek behek behek jaane de kadam. Sonu Nigam is at his casual best as Shiney and Soha give glimpses of electric chemistry.

 But, of course, theres trouble in paradise. That comes in the form of Prem Kumar (Rajat Kapoor with a horrible perhaps intentionally so wig) the reigning superstar who, in the name of giving a break to young Nikhat, completely takes over her life and every decision she makes. Zafar is not spared either. He is being chased by the seductress Ratanbala, played by Sonya Jehan (last seen in Akbar Khans Taj Mahal as Mumtaz Mahal).

 Thus begins a passion play involving these four characters in the backdrop of how the film industry used to function during those years. By Sudhir Mishras own admission, it is his own story, of a director-poet who wants to make films on his own terms and not be influenced or bullied by the business around him.

 Another highlight of the trailer is the song Aaja aaja deewane aaja. If you shut your eyes and listen to the first few lines, you would never be able to make out its a new song for a new film and not a Geeta Dutt number from the 1950s. 

 The trailer reaches a crescendo with the line: But were they destined to be together? Well, the way they are made to look in the movie Guru Dutt and Waheeda Rehman in true Kaagaz Ke Phool style Zafar and Nikhat will never live happily ever after.

 Khoya Khoya Chand also stars Sushmita Mukherjee, Saurabh Shukla and Vinay Pathak. Sudhir Mishras next film after Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi and Chameli is slated to release in end-October.

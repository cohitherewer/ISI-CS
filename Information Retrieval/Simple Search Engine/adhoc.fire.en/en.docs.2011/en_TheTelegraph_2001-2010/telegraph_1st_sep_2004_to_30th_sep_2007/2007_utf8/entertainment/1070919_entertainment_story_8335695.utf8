 Childrens lives involve a lot of physical and mental activity. Sometimes improper care can cause back ailments, such as spondylosis, slip disc and other spinal problems. These problems can be rectified with very simple back-bending asanas.

 DHANURASANA

 Dhanusha means bow. The hands are used like a bowstring to pull the entire body, head, trunk and legs up to resemble a bent bow.

 Technique

 Lie on your stomach, face downwards. Relax your muscles. Keep the arms resting alongside the body. Bend the legs at the knees. Raise the arms and hold the ankles with hands. As you inhale, pull the ankles to haul the entire frame of the body up. Straighten and hold your hands and also the legs firm in that position. This is the bow, a complete convex arch of the spine. Exhale once legs and chest are raised to the maximum position. Hold the pose, breathe normally to 10-20 counts and repeat three to five times daily. Relax in Shavasana.

 Benefits

 Chocolate story: Nidhi Bhageria was always fond of chocolates. Passion turned profession when she launched her own brand, Celeste. After concentrating on the Delhi market for over three years, Nidhi is all set to woo Calcuttans with her choco delights that draw inspirations from chocolatiers of Belgium, France, Switzerland and the US.

 The chocolates are churned out at the factory in Wazirpur, with ingredients imported from Belgium. Celeste offers more than 150 flavours. Flavours like coconut, truffle, cappuccino, walnut fudge, and the liqueur chocolate range, are big hits. Choose from various collections: diet, signature, anniversary, baby shower, corporate, and more. Wedding, anniversary and baby shower chocolates come in customised packages. The Misht collection goes the Indian way with ingredients like pistachios and cashews. The diet chocolates are made with natural sweeteners.

 The Celeste range will be available at 12/2 Hungerford Street and Sumangal Apartment, 4 Lee Road. 

 Pocket pinch: Rs 1,000 a kg. 

 Voiceover: Chocolate is a delicate product and we make an effort to reach out to our customers without compromising on quality, smoothness and taste, smiles Nidhi.

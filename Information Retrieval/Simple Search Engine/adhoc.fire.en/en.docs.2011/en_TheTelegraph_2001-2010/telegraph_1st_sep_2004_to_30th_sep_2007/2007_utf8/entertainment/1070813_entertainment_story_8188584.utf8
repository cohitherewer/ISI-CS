 Men get wilder post-marriage

 Riteish with his women in Heyy Babyy

 Riteish has this image of being a true gentleman when it comes to women. But that has not stopped him from playing an outrageous flirt in Out Of Control, Kya Kool Hai Hum, Masti and now Heyy Babyy.

 Are you confident in the company of women? Honestly, a lot of women intimidate me. I am a little nervous of women who carry Louis Vuitton bags and wear Prada shoes. I wear brand names myself but I dont know what to say to brand-conscious women beyond a polite hello.

 Do you identify more with your character in Masti who is petrified of women or are you this cool dude as seen in your other films? I fall in between the two extremes. I would like to pick up some of the traits of my character in Kya Kool Hai Hum. I like the way he carries himself.

 You seem to be playing a wild bachelor in Heyy Babyy. Are bachelors wilder than married men or is that just a myth? Its a myth. Men get wilder after marriage (laughs).

 Have you thought about taking the plunge? I have not thought about marriage though I guess I am old enough to start thinking about it. The thought of marriage scares the living daylight out of me. Its a huge commitment.

 Do Indian men feel as guilty about premarital sex as they do about extramarital affairs? No, I think they are guiltier about extramarital affairs.

 What is your opinion on premarital sex? If its between two consenting adults, its fine.

 Do you have locker room conversations? Not at all. I am a very personal guy. I dont share notes on my love life even with my closest friends. But I am most interested in listening to their escapades.

 Do you know when a woman is giving you vibes? No. She has to spell it out, big time. She has to write it down on a placard, like the ones cricket fans carry in stadiums.

 What is the most common compliment you pay to a woman? You have a great smile. I never compliment her about her body because I feel that is too personal.

 Do women gossip more than men? On the contrary, I feel men crave for gossip. They bitch a lot. I love gossip. But I know where to draw a line.

 Who does Riteish find pretty? Preity, Kareena, Rani.

 Did you ever share your adolescent pangs with your dad? No. My relationship with my father is one of respect; but I can say anything to my brothers. I have a younger and an elder brother, no sisters.

 What is your concept of an ideal woman? My mother is my ideal woman. Her world revolves around her family. My father, my brothers and I owe our success to her.

 What would the world be without women? Full of men.

 Is it a good idea to have a world full of men? Probably for certain men. But I would rather have a world full of women and... me!

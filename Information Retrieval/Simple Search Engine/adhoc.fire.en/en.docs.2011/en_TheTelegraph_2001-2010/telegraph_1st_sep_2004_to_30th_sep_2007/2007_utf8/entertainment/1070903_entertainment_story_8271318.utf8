The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Tech stop

 First Look 

 RPG Cellucom has flagged off its first Calcutta store. The 400-sq-ft mobility item store on the third floor of Forum stocks different models of phones and laptops. The small yet compact store is situated near the third-floor escalator. With its bright yellow-and-white decor, it is quite an eye-catcher.

 All gadgets complement each other and enabling mobility is our priority. You either find mobile stores or stores with an IT range here you have both, says Sunil Bhagat, CEO, RPG Cellucom. Everything from products to accessories is available under one roof. We keep high-end products and also cater to the low-end market, he adds.

 What is really drawing the crowds and boosting sales to start with is an introductory offer in which goodies are up for grabs pick up any laptop or mobile worth Rs 5,000 and win a return ticket to any destination of your choice in India! Here are some gizmos that grabbed our attention at the Cellucom store.

 Laptops: If youre thinking of shifting from the desktop to the convenient laptop, this is one place to explore options. HP and Compaq are currently on offer, with 60 per cent of total market share. Lenovo, Acer, Toshiba and Sony will soon be stocked. What seems like a great buy is the HP tablet PC (model no: HP Pavilion TX1003AU). Power-packed into this baby is AMD Turion 64 X2, 1GB memory, card reader, integrated Bluetooth and more, with a 12.1 widescreen, priced at Rs 55,600. The rest of the laptops range between Rs 30,000 and Rs 1,50,000.

 Cellphones: Ready to throw your cellphone away because its completely dated or over-used? Step in to choose from a series of high-end models and most brands you can think of. Nokia dominates, even in terms of sales, confirm officials. Samsung and Motorola follow. Business phones like the E61i (check out the large landscape screen of this smart phone), i-mate, latest HTC touch (with a touch-screen that makes quick dialling, navigation and selection a breeze), Sony Ericsson P1i (successor to the P990i) make good buys. N95 and Motorola Rokr E6 are pop tech picks, which sold out in the first two days.

 IT accessories: Pen-drives, memory cards (512MB to 2GB), Bluetooth headsets and other laptop/mobile accessories stock the shelves in brands like Kingston, Novel, Transcend and Gemini. Some interesting accessories are on offer, like super-mini optical mouse with retractable cables, web cameras, amplifying speakers, three-in-one chargers and a video iPod remote control. Mobile phone connections from major service providers are also available at the store.

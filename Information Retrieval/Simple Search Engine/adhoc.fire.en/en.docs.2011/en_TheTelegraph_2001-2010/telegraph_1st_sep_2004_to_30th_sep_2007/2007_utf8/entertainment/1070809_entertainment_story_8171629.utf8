The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 FOOD 

 FUNDA

 Bipasha Basu on her gift of the grub

 Begin my day with: A steaming cup of tea 

 or hot water with lemon and honey before rushing out of the 

 house if I have a shoot. When I reach my sets, I eat a slice 

 of toast, have some fruit or snack on soya chaklis. 

 Love to eat: Melons and pomegranate. I 

 make it a point to eat at least one full fruit everyday.

 Love to drink: At least three-four glasses 

 of daab (thats what we call coconut water in Calcutta) 

 or some fresh orange juice daily.

 My school tiffin box consisted of: French 

 toast, aloo paratha and besan chilla. But I got fed up of 

 home food by Class IV and started taking a lunch allowance. 

 But instead of spending it, I would eat from my friends 

 dabbas and hoard the lunch money.

 Unit food is: Something which I relished 

 eating earlier. I am a big foodie, but I try to control 

 myself when I am shooting because you dont know what 

 kind of food is in store for you! Now I call for some vegetarian 

 salad on the sets and add some low-fat dressing 

 I always carry Thousand Island dressing with me. At times, 

 I eat some grilled chicken. A big bowl of sprouts keeps 

 me going through the day.

 My dinner: Was usually a big meal comprising 

 daal, fish, chicken and two rotis. At times I had egg curry 

 too. But I now have a light dinner.

 My favourite salad: Fresh fruits mixed 

 with curd, a dash of sugar, salt, mustard paste and chaat 

 masala.

 Non-veg food I like: Seafood! I dont 

 eat red meat at all and rarely ever eat lamb.

 My food habits: Have changed after coming 

 to Mumbai. I loved rice earlier but now I have started eating 

 rotis.

 Calcutta food I like: Jhaal muri, aloo 

 kaabli and very soft rosogolla. Oh, how I miss them. And 

 how I miss my mothers cooking, especially prawn curry, 

 mustard fish and Hyderabadi biryani. My father too makes 

 exotic Thai dishes and excellent palak meat.

 My cooking experience: I made Maggi noodles 

 for the first time when I was in my teens. Now I am an expert 

 at making Hakka noodles. I can cook daal, rajma and chicken 

 curry too.

 Desserts I dig: Creme brulee, hot gulab jamun, 

 and hot jalebi once in a while. I did not particularly care 

 for sweets earlier but now I am beginning to like them. 

 But I am still not very fond of chocolates.

 Drinks and beverages I like: Sipping coconut water 

 or a hot cup of tea. On a hot summer day, I love to drink 

 nimbu paani. My favourite mocktail is a tall glass of peach 

 flavoured iced tea. I dont like the taste of alcohol. 

 But occasionally, I like to sip a glass of white wine.

 My favourite cuisine: Thai, South Indian, 

 Bengali and Hyderabadi. I like eating at the Thai Connection, 

 Olive, China Gate, Tian and at the Marriott coffee shop 

 in Mumbai. I also love eating at the President but its 

 so far from where I live that I dont get the time. 

 I freak out at Only Fish when Im in the mood for 

 Bengali food. Grand Kakatia, Hyderabad, has an excellent 

 buffet. They serve the best Hyderabadi biryani. At Bheemas 

 in Bangalore, you get the tastiest and the heaviest thali 

 I have ever eaten.

 Eating abroad: I try out all kinds of eateries. 

 In New York I love to eat at Jaya. I just love Thai food 

 abroad because it is so different.

 My idea of a romantic meal: Tasty food 

 and pleasant weather.

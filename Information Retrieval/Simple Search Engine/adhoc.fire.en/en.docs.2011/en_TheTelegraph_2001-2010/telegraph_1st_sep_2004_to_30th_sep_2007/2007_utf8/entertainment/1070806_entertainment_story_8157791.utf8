The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Look dont leer. Listen , dont lap it up

 It is time to put an end to the stigma attached to what have long been considered social vices: eavesdropping, and an associated crime, staring. We all do it, so why deny it? 

I once listened myself outside a tent when there was a mutiny brewing. Its all a question of the degree of provocation. My life was at stake, said Captain Bluntschli in Bernard Shaws Arms and the Man. He makes a powerful point in favour of eavesdropping its fine, as long as the ends justify the means. We agree, and would add another rider: the method is as critical, as it distinguishes discreet observer from unpolished boor.

 And as long as certain rules are observed (read on to learn what these are), we may even go as far as to say that observing people around us is our responsibility. It is instructive (teaching us how not to dress); it informs us about world events (in as far as they unfold in other peoples kitchens); it allows us to assist people in need (if only more people would, particularly on buses).

 But more on the edifying effect of snooping later. First, lets acknowledge an irrefutable truth: it is almost impossible not to overhear others in our world. Our city, with its (unofficial) population density of 3,543 people per square centimetre, leaves us with little buffer space. On public transport, pressed up against strangers, personal space and privacy have long been dispensed with. But even in places such as restaurants, with tables packed in and seats arranged back to back, only the hearing impaired could escape the next tables talk. So if the discussion is interesting, all the better. And since not to look at your neighbouring diners would require you to walk around wearing blinkers, better make the most of it, and try to spot what they are having and whether it looks any good.

 The power of a prolonged glance is widely acknowledged. Take the pictures you see on this page and on our cover. They were taken at an eye-gazing party in a Manhattan nightclub. This is apparently one of the latest fads in New York. It involves single people sitting in pairs, staring at each other for three minutes. They work through the whole room in this manner, before presumably settling down for some conversation with those whom they enjoyed staring at, and being stared at by.

 Food of love

 Breaching social norms can indeed lead to romance (and much more to follow, but that is not our concern here). Suchi Chakraborty remembers staring herself into love when she was in school. I found a senior of mine a little peculiar. I didnt know why. To find out exactly what was wrong I unconsciously started staring at him. Soon, I began to like what I saw. He was very different, and before I knew it I was in love, remembers the 27-year-old.

 It is but natural that looking at an attractive person could lead to love or what feels like it. But so can the dulcet tones pouring forth from an unseen mouth. I get drawn by voices and conversation. Often if I have heard a good voice, or hear some intelligent remark, I have turned to stare at the person, admits Sayantan Das Adhikari, PR professional.

 This brings us to the most burning question: at what point does observing become staring and staring become leching? A sidelong glance is okay: it indicates curiosity, guarded by modesty. Eye contact, if brief, is acceptable. But to keep looking fixedly after eye contact has been made is downright rude. To avert the eyes on being caught watching is almost a tacit acceptance of the fact that the glance could be construed as an intrusion if prolonged.

 In Bengali, jhaari kora is all about letting the eyes do the talking. This is where we draw the tricky line of a man looking at a woman with interest or the other way around. When two people make eyes at each other, the admiration is clearly mutual, and therefore, agreeable. When the eyes travel elsewhere, and linger, discomfort and disgust frequently follow. Its when eyes go straight to your bust, and you know whats going on in their minds, that it makes me uncomfortable, feels Jessica, a city-based model. 

 Stealing one glance or even a second one is okay, but one shouldnt stare fixedly, adds Prithwiraj Deb, technology consultant.

 Psychologist Moharmala Chatterjee explains the difference. If staring makes someone uncomfortable or if someone is staring at someone as a sexual object, then it becomes demeaning.

 So once again, the method and motive are called into question.

 Leaving sex and love out of the equation, observing those around you can also lead to a pleasant aside to a regular evening out. For communications professional Chandni Chatterjee, most evenings end at Oly Pub, on Park Street. I get to hear some of the most interesting conversations there, shares the 26-year-old. Two weeks ago, she found one conversation so interesting it was about Nandigram that she joined in.

 If the topic is interesting, apparently, passive absorption can become active participation. I enjoy sports, especially cricket. So if I hear anything interesting being discussed about sports I join in, says Vaijayanta Chattoraj, a software developer.

 At the very least, it is a pleasant way to spend a few minutes (we hope not hours) when we have little else to do. For Jessica, the greenroom is the most common place to eavesdrop unintentionally, of course. Before a show, we often have to be in the greenroom from the morning. And when you have nothing to do, you end up listening to what other people are talking about, she admits. It has worked in her favour leaving her with valuable information about make-up and other modelling essentials, and even cooking.

 One-way traffic

 The mobile phone has introduced imagination to the eavesdropping equation. With people talking so loudly on their mobile all around you, you cant help but hear. And since you are hearing only one side of the conversation, it is very engrossing to imagine what the other person might be saying, feels Chandni. Love-life troubles are what she and the rest of us most frequently overhear.

 The life of a mobile spy is fraught with uncertainty. Mandy Sen, a mass communication student, complains that while listening in on other peoples cellphone conversations, the traffic sounds from the road often get in the way, leaving you with only half the fact. Annoying indeed.

 Most amusing is when people lie about their whereabouts. Dont be surprised if you hear someone on a Salt Lake-bound bus telling the person on the line that he is in Barrackpore for the day. I hear it all the time, on the Metro, on buses. People being at one place and saying there are somewhere else, says Vaijayanta. Sometimes its obvious they are trying to avoid the person they are talking to. Sometimes, its because they are late for an appointment.

 All of these (free) pleasures would be lost to us if we were forced to black out those around us. It would be a shame indeed.

 We would, instead, entreat those amongst us who gape rather than casually look, and fall over in their seats rather than cock a ear to mind their manners.

 For discretion is most certainly the better part of voyeurism.

 When staring

 Do: Look briefly, then look away

 Don rsquo;t: Gaze fixedly for too long

 Do: Look at the face, or any neutral zone

 Don rsquo;t: Undress with your eyes

 When eavesdropping

 Do: Try to look like you have other things to do

 Don rsquo;t: Gape till they feel the need to change the topic

 Do: Stay seated

 Don rsquo;t: Lean towards the speakers. It is a dead give-away

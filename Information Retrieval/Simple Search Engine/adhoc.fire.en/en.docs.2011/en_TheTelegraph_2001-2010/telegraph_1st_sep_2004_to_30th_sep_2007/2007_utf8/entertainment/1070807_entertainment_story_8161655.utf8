 SHAUN KENWORTHY TRACES THE LINEAGE OF WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE, AN INGREDIENT WITH INDIAN ORIGINS THATS NOW A KITCHEN STAPLE

 Ive been interested in where the Worcestershire sauce originates from ever since I set foot on Indian soil. With ingredients like tamarind and molasses, it really is a bizarre concoction, to say the least. Its also an ingredient most Western and east Asian kitchens couldnt do without. I came across a really interesting read a couple of years ago that gives the lowdown on the stuff and something I wanted to share with you all. It starts thus:

 Once upon a time, 1835 to be exact, Lord Marcus Sandys, an ex-governor of Bengal, approached chemists John Lea and William Perrins, whose prospering business in Broad Street, Worcester, handled pharmaceuticals and toiletries as well as groceries. He asked them to make up a sauce from a recipe which hehad brought back from India. While His Lordship was apparently satisfied with the results, Messrs Lea and Perrins considered it to be an unpalatable, red-hot fire-water and consigned the quantity they had made for themselves to the cellars. During the stocktake-cum-spring clean the following year, they came across the barrel and decided to taste it before discarding it. 

 To their amazement, the mixture had mellowed into an aromatic, piquant and appetising liquid. They hastily purchased the recipe from Lord Sandys and, in 1838, the Anglo-Indian Lea Perrins Worcestershire sauce was launched commercially. 

 One of the myriad 19th-century pungent English sauces based on oriental ingredients, it had many imitators sporting pretentious names such as British Lion and Empress of India. Its exact recipe still remains a secret. All that is known is that it includes vinegar, sugar, soy sauce, molasses, tamarind, shallots, anchovies (not so common to India), ginger, chillies, cloves, nutmeg and cardamom. Lea Perrins product was exported worldwide, including to the then British colony of Malaya (as Malaysia was known before independence), where it was incorporated by Hainanese cooks into various dishes prepared for their British employers. Many of these dishes became part and parcel of Malaysian home cooking and still feature in some restaurants, in particular, The Coliseum Cafe in Kuala Lumpur. 

 This institution, once the haunt of British plantation managers, still carries Anglo-Hainanese classics on its virtually unchanged menu. One such is Chicken or Pork Chop, comprising the relevant protein slab crumbed or egg-flour coated pan-fried and served with peas, carrots and potato slices in a Worcestershire and soy sauce-flavoured gravy carrying softened fried onion rings. Chicken macaroni pie, an Anglo-Hainanese dish mainly seen in Penang, is always accompanied by Worcestershire sauce and freshly sliced chillies. The Nonyas (Straits Settlement Chinese) also took up Worcestershire sauce with gusto. Some families make their own special versions using jealously guarded recipes handed down through generations. Termed Ang Mo Tau Eu (literally, white persons soy sauce) in Hokkien, it is, with sliced chillies, an essential accompaniment for dishes such as Panggang Ikan (grilled banana leaf-wrapped seasoned whole fish), Roti Babi (stuffed French toast) and Inchee Kabin (Malaysian Spiced Fried Chicken).

 I myself have been using Worcestershire sauce since starting my career, an item that Im sure started off all the other famous steak sauces of the world, things that I grew up on like H.P. sauce, all derivatives and thickened emulsified versions of the original. America has its own steak sauces and all in all, a wonderful little story that I could rattle on about for pages and pages. I also have for you one of my all-time favourites where Worcestershire sauce plays an integral part to the dish.

 Sticky, smoky baby back rib

 As I rsquo;m sure everyone is well aware by now, I worship the pig and all its delicious offerings. Here rsquo;s a really simple dish that you can leave to cook while you go out to do your shopping. Serve with fries, mash, rice or noodles and some well-cooked seasonal veggies.

 To 1,200g pork ribs or chops, add 300g sugar, 100ml Worcestershire sauce, 100ml malt vinegar, 100ml tomato ketchup, 1 rdquo; fresh ginger chopped, six cloves of fresh garlic chopped, 200ml pineapple juice, salt and pepper to taste and around 2tbsp sesame oil. Toss all the ingredients together and rub well into the pork ribs. Cover and leave refrigerated for at least 24 hours. Lastly, you can either place into a cooking pot and throw it in the oven on low for around 2 frac12; hrs or till the meat is falling off the bone and the liquid is a rich, sticky consistency. You could also grill on a BBQ to give a wonderful smokiness.

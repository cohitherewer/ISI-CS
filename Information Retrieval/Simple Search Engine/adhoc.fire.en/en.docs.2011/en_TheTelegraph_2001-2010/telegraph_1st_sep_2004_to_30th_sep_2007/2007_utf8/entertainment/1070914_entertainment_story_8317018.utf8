The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Box Office 

 Darling

 After the Aag debacle, Ram Gopal Varma can breathe a little easy. Darling, a horror-meets-comedy flick, has registered a good opening week at the box office. 

 Pro: Esha Deol and Fardeen Khan; the intriguing premise

 Con: Not scary enough

 Dhamaal

 This outrageous comic caper featuring some of the best names in the comedy business has managed to pull in the crowds in Week One, with the queues set to grow longer in the second week. 

 Pro: The performances, especially Jaaved Jaaferis; some one-liners; a few hilarious moments; good music 

 Con: The screenplay tends to sag towards the end; the lack of logic 

 Apna Asmaan

 Even with a stellar cast and an unusual storyline, debutant director Kaushik Roys Apna Asmaan has not been well-received in its opening week.

 Pro: The performances

 Con: A sagging screenplay; the film tends to get a tad preachy

 RGV Ki Aag

 Brickbats continue to rain down on this poor rip-off of Sholay. Counted as one of the biggest box office disasters of 2007, the crowd count is dwindling with each passing day as the film fails to manage a third week at most theatres.

 Pro: Nothing

 Con: Everything

 Heyy Babyy

 Sajid Khans laugh-a-minute caper continues to create box office magic, with many turning up for a repeat watch.

 Pro: Akshay, Fardeen and Riteish; the music; the baby 

 Con: Vidya Balan is miscast; the film tends to drag in the middle

 Chak De! India

 Its Week 5 and the Chak de! craze refuses to wane with the SRK-starrer still scoring big at the box office. The Indian hockey teams resurgence could not be better timed.

 Pro: Shah Rukh Khan hasnt looked and acted better; the supporting cast; gender and region sensitive

 Con: Nothing really

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Stupid QS Day

 There may be no such thing as a stupid question, but there is a Stupid Question Day all right, which is today. We seize the occasion to ask some questions, borrowed from several sources, which defy answers or people are afraid to answer them or no one has actually bothered to think about them. Some of them, we suspect, are profound. 

 Here we go:

 From Bollywood and TV (with special thanks to Sholay):

 Kitne aadmi the?

 Yeh Ramgarh-waale apney betiyon ko kaunsi chakki ka aata khilaatein hain?

 Is bachche ka baap kaun hai?

 Wheres the party tonight?

 Kya hua, tera waada?

 Hum aapke hain kaun?

 Kya yahi pyaar hai?

 Ssshhhh Koi Hai?

 Woh kaun thi? 

 Aur tumhaare paas (kya hai)?, followed by the post-MTV Can you repeat the question?

 Main kaun hoon? (post-amnesia)

 Who Let The Dogs Out? Who? Who? Who? (Baha Men; off the eponymous album)

 Who The F*** Is Alice? (Originally Living Next Door To Alice by Smokie; spoofed by many)

 If you still have not had your fill, youre a manic-depressive Pink Floyd acolyte. Their album The Wall is a series of question marks, starting with the song In The Flesh?, to Mother do you think theyll drop the bomb?/Mother do you think theyll like this song? in Mother to Daddy what else did you leave behind for me? in Another Brick In The Wall, Part I to Hello?/Is there anybody in there? in Comfortably Numb to Isnt this where...? in The Trial.

 How many you have? (Fastrack shades and watches)

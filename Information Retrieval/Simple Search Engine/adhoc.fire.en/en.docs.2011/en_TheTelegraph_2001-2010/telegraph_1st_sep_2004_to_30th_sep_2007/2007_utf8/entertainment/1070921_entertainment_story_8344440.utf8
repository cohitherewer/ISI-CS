 Face-off

 As the privacy of the social networking website is under threat, here are a few tips on how to avoid embarrassment on FACEBOOK

 Splitsville: With relationships breaking up all the time (like Justin Timberlake rsquo;s with Cameron Diaz), leave the relationship status field on Facebook blank

 The news that Facebook will be making its member list available to Internet search engines is sure to send a shudder of fear through its users. In the coming weeks, anyone, even those without a Facebook account, will not only be able to search for friends via the Facebook homepage but also through popular search engines, such as Yahoo! and Google.

 While Facebook insists that these public listings will include only names and profile pictures, some members fear it rsquo;s the beginning of a slippery slope. Facebook rsquo;s rise in popularity is due in part to the privacy it offers compared to open, searchable social-networking sites as MySpace. 

 Although the decision to make its member directory available to search engines could help to boost membership, it could also backfire: members could leave Facebook in their droves for new private pastures.

 It rsquo;s a clear sign, too, of Facebook rsquo;s ambitions. As Om Malik, tech blogger, notes on his website gigaom.com: ldquo;We rsquo;re leaving digital litter all over the web and some day it rsquo;ll cause problems. rdquo;

 There are simple steps that Facebook users can take to protect their profiles from prying eyes and unsolicited snoopers, simply by adjusting the privacy settings. Of course, the only cast-iron way to ensure you do not expose any embarrassing information to the general public or, worse still, employers and colleagues, is to be careful how much and what kind of information you post on your profile page. It undermines the fun, free-and-easy element that has made Facebook so popular, but by following a few golden rules you won rsquo;t be caught out.

 DO AND DON rsquo;T

 The site is responsible for more misunderstandings, break-ups, sackings and fights than any other social-networking site. Facebook was originally designed for students and, since students thrive in this kind of social minefield, it was perfect. But what about the meaningfully employed? How can we keep our jobs, friends and relationships intact while still enjoying Facebook?

 The friendly boss: Your boss will join Facebook because she can see it on her employee rsquo;s screens for 80 per cent of the working day. Now she wants to befriend you. The problem is, your Facebook page is laden with photos of that fancy-dress party to which you wore stockings and suspenders (and you rsquo;re a man), smiling drunkenly with a traffic cone for a hat. Your boss will be offended if you don rsquo;t accept her friend request, but if you do you rsquo;re forced to lay bare everything you and your friends get up to outside work.

 Since people do get fired because of their Facebook profile, tick the box that means they can see only your limited profile. This can be edited via the privacy page.

 Misuse of the Wall: The Wall on your Facebook page is public. This is easy to forget. Some users treat the wall as if it were a private email between themselves and their friend. If you don rsquo;t post objectionable material in the first place, you won rsquo;t have a problem. Be careful, too, of the kinds of messages you leave for other people. 

 The lsquo;relationship 

 status rsquo; field: Your Facebook profile has a space for you to declare your relationship status. To the unwitting, it seems like a good idea to proclaim your love and commitment through Facebook but, in fact, it is a rather foolish one. Many younger Facebook users don rsquo;t think a relationship is real until it rsquo;s ldquo;Facebook official rdquo;, and this means linking your page to the page of your partner. 

 But when the relationship ends everyone knows, from your closest friends to people you barely know. 

 Leave that relationship status blank.

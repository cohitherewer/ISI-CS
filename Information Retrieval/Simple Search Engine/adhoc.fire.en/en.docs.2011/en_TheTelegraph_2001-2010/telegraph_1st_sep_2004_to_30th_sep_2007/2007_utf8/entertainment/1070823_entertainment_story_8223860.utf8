 Parineeta goes glam

 - Vidya 

 Balan on her new avatar in Heyy Babyy 

 Vidya Balan in Heyy 

 Babyy 

 After her very Bharatiya avatars in Parineeta and Eklavya and her cute Jahnvi act in Lage Raho Munnabhai, VIDYA BALAN is going all glam in this Fridays big release Heyy Babyy. Heres what the Pradeep Sarkar discovery has to say about the Sajid Khan movie.

 Your look is really different 

 in Heyy Babyy... 

 Yes, I have this glam western 

 look thanks to Manish (Malhotra). He has always been known 

 to create magic with his heroines. He has given me a very 

 different look in this movie. I hope he creates magic with 

 me, too.

 In Salaam-E-Ishq, Eklavya 

 and Guru this year your performances were appreciated, 

 but you had rather small roles. What about Heyy Babyy?

 There were reasons why I did the earlier films. Im happy I did them. They were all part of my learning curve. I feel you should be convinced about a film, a role and the director. I am happy with the roles I have done; and I hope Heyy Babyy only makes me happier.

 What made you agree to do Heyy 

 Babyy? 

 When Sajid (Khan) came to me with 

 this film, he narrated a 10-minute storyline to me. I was 

 convinced about the story and my character. I had this innate 

 faith in Sajid that he would make a great film because his 

 cinematic sensibilities are absolutely in place. I love 

 his sense of humour, so I instantly said yes and everything 

 just fell into place. We have a great cast and superb technicians. 

 The good thing about Sajid is that he ensures a very chilled-out 

 atmosphere. It helps you give your best shot.

 Do you have a comic role like 

 the three heroes? 

 No, this particular role is not 

 comic. I would love to do a comedy and I would love to do 

 one with Sajid. I wish he repeats this team in his next 

 film and, will hopefully, make an out-and-out comedy. In 

 Heyy Babyy Im the point of conflict. Thats 

 all I can divulge now (smiles).

 Why has the film been set in 

 Sydney? 

 The film is about Indians settled 

 abroad. Heyy Babyy simply but very effectively underlines 

 the fact that You can get out of India but you cannot 

 get India out of you. The ethical values of an Indian 

 remain the same no matter which part of the world he is 

 in.

 What do you play in the film?

 My character has shaped up really 

 well. I am amazed that Sajid came to me with this role. 

 There is a certain emotion I am expected to portray in this 

 film, which no other director I have met so far would probably 

 even associate me with. But Sajid had the conviction and 

 he came to me. Since it is something I have not done before 

 as an actor, I was always a bit high-strung while shooting 

 for the film. I was a bit unsure and it took me a bit of 

 time to get my bearings; but Sajid was absolutely clear 

 about the way he wanted things. Plus, I was working with 

 this amazing bunch of co-stars who just made life so much 

 simpler.

 How did your co-stars made 

 it simpler for you? 

 It was like a mad house. Each 

 one of them is madder than the other. They helped me unleash 

 the madness in me. They treated me like a guy on the sets. 

 So much so that when I was asked to pose amongst the melee 

 of men for the music release, I was like, Wow, I finally 

 feel like a woman. The guys treated me like a buddy; 

 it almost felt like I was back in college. Many pranks were 

 played on me and I also joined in. Both the Sajids (Khan 

 and Nadiadwala, the producer) were great fun.

 What pranks were played on 

 the sets? 

 We were shooting our first schedule 

 in Madh Island and there was this model who was shooting 

 with us. We were playing dumb charades and this model happened 

 to mention to us that she was planning to sack her driver 

 because he had come drunk to work. Sajid (Khan) and Akshay 

 (Kumar) just took off on her. How can you sack your 

 driver? They scared the living daylights out of her. 

 Sajid told her: Do din pehle mere padosi ne apne 

 driver ko kaam se nikaal diya aur aaj uska khoon 

 ho gaya. The model was petrified because she had 

 to drive back all alone from Madh Island to Bandra. Akshay 

 hurriedly wrote a note and sent it to her. It was a letter 

 purportedly containing a threat from the driver. 

 She was scared out of her wits. We couldnt bear it 

 anymore so we finally let the cat out of the bag.

 Who was your favourite co-star 

 Akshay, Fardeen or Riteish?

 My favourite co-star is the baby! Look, I had a great time with all my three heroes, so I cant pick and choose.

 Whats next on the cards?

 Halla Bol with Ajay Devgan, 

 Bhool Bhulaiya with Akshay (Kumar) and Shiney (Ahuja), 

 and Aziz Mirzas next, an untitled film with Shahid 

 Kapur.

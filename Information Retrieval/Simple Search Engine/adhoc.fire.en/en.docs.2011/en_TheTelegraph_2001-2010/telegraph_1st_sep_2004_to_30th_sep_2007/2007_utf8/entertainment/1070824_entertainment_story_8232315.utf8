 Bye, bye baby doll

 Designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee talks to t2 about his passion, fashion and why has he been in hiding.

 Sabyasachi rsquo;s models on the ramp 

 in New York last year

 A white and red striped Tommy Hilfiger shirt worn with his favourite jeans, a guilty smile on his face thanks to the half-hour delay, Sabyasachi Mukherjee is quite composed despite his schedule over the next two months. Hes showing at Olympus Fashion Week in New York back-to-back with an exhibition at London Fashion Week in September. A quick trip he is thinking about comes in between to collect his National Award for Black (I never thought it will happen) and then two ramp shows at Lakme Fashion Week. He talks to t2 about his current state of mind and matters:

 Mood of the moment 

 I am in a renunciation mood. This time my collection has no theme, no name. Im inspired by The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini and Paulo Coelhos The Witch of Portobello and have created an imaginary character in my head. She defines the kind of woman I want to dress now. She is between 25 and 35, is mature and real. Im sick of saccharine-sweet baby dolls. I have always been excited with the Islamisation of fashion where sexy is all about loose garments and covering up.

 Personally also, I took a sabbatical for my sanity. It is difficult to do so many collections and be proper and politically correct all the time. So I took time off, didnt take calls, offended people but did some soul-searching. 

 I have also decided to skip shows because I am fed up of churning out two collections every year. The next line always wears a hangover of the previous one and with global warming, seasons have come closer! Now if someone sees a nice jacket in the summer, they will buy it and wait for the winter to wear it, regardless of what is in. Thats the way to be.

 The Olympus collection

 The New York collection is political but only in its look. I have no political agenda and I have nothing to say. It is inspired by communalism and has symbols, Urdu scriptures and dabbles in religion. The silhouettes are inspired by Islam and the Church. 

 There is also active sportswear. Lots of layering and also grunge that is not fashions favourite but looks beautiful if done cleverly. My collection this time is unabashedly Indian. There are salwars turning into track pants and biker jackets worn with lehngas. There are Taekwondo pants and the garments are big and super-long. The story is about overtly ethnic silhouettes but with a punch in them. I am inspired by Raja Ravi Vermas paintings so the hair is centre-parted and knee-length. The main colours are communist red, military, ivory and black. The fabric story has lots of stained satin. Imagine how a satin piece would look after the Pearl Harbour attack. There is also brocade, mul, linen, denim.

 Always wear a great bra when you are being measured for a blouse 

 The double show at Lakme Fashion Week

 This time I showing two collections at Lakme Fashion Week. One is an Indian story inspired by the ghats of Varanasi. Think about it, romance in India began at the bathing ghats. I am also moved by Steve McCurrys photographs, so the colours are vintage and retro. The second collection will be the New York Fashion Week line.

 Bollywood projects

 I have completed Laaga Chunri Mein Daag and there are no new projects coming up. I couldnt finish Konkona Sensharmas look in the movie because I was not able to do justice to both Ranis (Mukerji) and Konkonas looks. Both have equally strong roles and since I am not based in Mumbai, things get difficult. I finished Ranis ethnic and Western look and only managed Konkonas Indian look.

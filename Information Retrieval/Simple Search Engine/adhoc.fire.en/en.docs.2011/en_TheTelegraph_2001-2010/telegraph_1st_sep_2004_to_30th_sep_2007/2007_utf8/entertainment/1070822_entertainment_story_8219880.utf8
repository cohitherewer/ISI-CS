 Snip in style

 Liked the hairstyles in Dil Chahta Hai? You could treat your tresses to similarly snazzy styling at Juice Salon and Spa, the Mumbai-based brand that is all set to make a significant difference in this part of the country. The premium salon chain has made its eastern India debut with a plush snip stop in the city on August 16.

 We are here to provide consumers professional services of international standards. From styling to maintenance, from detailed attention to consultation, we have the answer to everything, says Reshma Sambtani, owner of the Juice franchise in Calcutta.

 The city may be experiencing a salon boom, but Reshma is confident that the brand behind the styling of films like Humraaz and Armaan has much to offer that the city hasnt seen. Our stylists are professionals from Mumbai. The city has had nothing like this ever before, says Reshma, who has worked with cricketer Shahid Afridi, actress Nandita Das and model Yukta Mookhey.

 Juice, at 7 Burdwan Road, Burdwan Court, Alipore, is spread across 2,000 sq ft. There is a lounge ambience for the hair section with wooden flooring, white walls, seats in electric pink and white and circular mirrors. The pedicure and manicure section overlooks a trimmed lawn and has been decorated in sedate browns and pastels. Then there are two facial rooms, a nail extension bar and colour bar.

 The salon uses products from brands like TIGI, a professional UK-based hair-care label, and OPI, famous for its nail and skin care lines. We have a lot to offer to the city, feels Homai Billimoria, senior stylist from Juice, Mumbai. Here the styles are conventional and the terminology used by stylists is often not correct. The Juice haircuts, she explains, take into account factors like face structure, appearance and profession. Each client enjoys a consultation where the requirement and suggestions are thoroughly discussed, adds Homai. This service comes at a price. 

 While a senior stylist would charge about Rs 800, the services of a junior stylist come for Rs 400. Services like spa pedicure with The Body Shop products comes for Rs 550. Anti-ageing and glow-enhancing facials come for Rs 700-plus. A nail extension session would set you back by Rs 1,500.

 The salon also packs in a three-month hairdressing course Kick Start for Rs 60,000. The curriculum includes hair and scalp analysis, product knowledge, cuts, colouring, salon management through videos, theory, practical, workshops and demos. The best will be absorbed by us, says Reshma.

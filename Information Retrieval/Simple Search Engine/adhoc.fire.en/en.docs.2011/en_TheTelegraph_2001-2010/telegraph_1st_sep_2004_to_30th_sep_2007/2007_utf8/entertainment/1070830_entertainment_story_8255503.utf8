 Do the Diesel

 - Better engines have made this the clean, efficient and cheap fuel to tank up on 

 Picture by Amit Dutta 

 Diesel is no longer a dirty word. It is fast emerging as an alternative fuel to petrol with cleaner emissions, better fuel efficiency and less maintenance hassles thanks to common rail technology. So apart from the chuggy SUVs or MUVs, sedans and hatchbacks too are sporting diesel engines under their bonnets. 

 Ford and Hyundai have recently launched diesel models in mid-size cars. Tata did it long ago with Indica and refined it with their patented DICOR engines. Market leaders Maruti soon followed with the diesel Swift. Ford, which launched the Fusion diesel in July, pioneered diesel engines in the C segment with Escort. Hyundai rsquo;s diesel Verna was another entrant in the same segment. 

 Auto-makers have now turned to the B+ segment with the diesel variants. ldquo;Earlier, customers had to make a choice between a big car with a diesel engine and a small car with a petrol engine. But today, even mid-size cars are sporting diesel engines without compromising on ride quality, rdquo; said Gagandeep Singh of Chevrolet, which has recently launched the diesel variant of Magnum Optra.

 The noise, vibration and harshness factor (NVH) that drove many away from the diesel engine, despite the fuel being cheaper than petrol, has been addressed with superior technology. The common rail direct fuel injection has been adopted by all auto-makers under different trade names. The BMW calls them D engines, DaimlerChrysler CDI, Fiat Group JTD, Honda i-CTDi, Hyundai CRDi, Ford TDCi Duratorq, Tata DICOR and Maruti Udyog DdiS. It is a modern variant of direct injection system for diesel engines. 

 Customers, particularly in India, when making rational choices about their cars, are finding diesel much more economical in the long run. They are a little more expensive than their petrol versions (by about 15 per cent) but in the long run, after four or five years, the higher price difference is offset by the lower running and maintenance costs. ldquo;I have been waiting for this car for a long time, rdquo; said S.K. Das, who booked a diesel Fusion the day it was launched. ldquo;I needed a diesel hatchback. I do at least 70 km a day and needed a low-cost fuel engine fitted into a smaller car. rdquo; Das, who also has a petrol Zen, feels the ride quality and smoothness of his diesel car are ldquo;as good as my petrol car rdquo;.

 Not only is it cheaper, but auto experts agree that diesel being a high-energy fuel gives better mileage than petrol. Maintenance is also on a par with petrol cars. 

 Singh predicts that diesel engines will soon find their way into the sub-compact segment as well. In fact, the Tata one-lakh car is to have a 600-cc diesel engine.

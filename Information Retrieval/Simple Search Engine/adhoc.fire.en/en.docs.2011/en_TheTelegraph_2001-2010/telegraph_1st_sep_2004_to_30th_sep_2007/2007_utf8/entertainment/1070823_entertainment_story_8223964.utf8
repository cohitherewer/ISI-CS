The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Zen and the 

 art of scratching

 SEX 

 amp; the city

 A couple in a restaurant leaves Chandrima 

 S. Bhattacharya feeling more than a little nuked 

 On Saturday, a friend and I wanted 

 to discuss the fine print in the N-deal over a plate of 

 Chana Bhatura and filter coffee at a well-known south Indian 

 restaurant on Central Avenue, which smells so strongly of 

 dhoop that you also start smelling of it. On weekends 

 it is very crowded and this Saturday was no exception. 

 I was sharing the bhatura 

 with a friend with the hope of splitting the calories, and 

 again exhorting the heavens to explain, why, oh why, does 

 guilt not burn calories, as I have guilt in plenty with 

 much to spare, when I noticed the couple sitting at the 

 table next to ours. 

 He was in a safari suit, but she 

 was beautiful in a red printed chiffon sari with a diamond 

 sparkling on her shapely nose. But he had his hands under 

 the table and in one of them he was holding the glass of 

 water that had been served to him. He was trying to wash 

 his hands there. When he met my startled eyes, he stopped 

 trying to do that, but without looking the least bit discomfited, 

 extracted his hands and rested them on the table for a while. 

 But just as I relaxed a bit, in one swift movement he grabbed 

 the glass and washed his hands on the potted plant that 

 separated him from another table. 

 When the food came they were 

 sharing a dish too he pulled the steaming steel boat with 

 the vadas stewed in the sambar towards himself 

 and plunged into it. I was glad in a way he was lending 

 credence to the theory that a lot of the violence against 

 Indian women is acted out on the dining table when the 

 woman shifted on her haunches and let out a loud belch. 

 Then there was no looking back. 

 The man pulled out his flashy mobile phone from his pocket, 

 flicked it open and dialled a number, all of this with one 

 hand, since the other hand was busy with the Chana Bhatura 

 that had arrived recently. He was presumably speaking to 

 his daughters in-laws. He asked how each of the familys 

 12 members was doing in a voice that can only sound right 

 when accompanied by right head-banging, devoting about exactly 

 a minute to each relative. 

 He passed on the phone to his 

 wife and while she asked the same questions at the same 

 decibel level to the same people, he remembered the 13th 

 member of the family and was frantic till his wife spoke 

 to him. 

 The conversation over, the woman 

 belched again. This time, it was louder and lasted longer 

 it indicated satisfaction with the world. 

 Last seen, the mans hands 

 were where his trousers met and he was scratching the joint 

 with a certain force that led to a slight, scraping, but 

 rhythmic noise. The expression on his face showed 100 per 

 cent pure peace. He knew the meaning of Zen. 

 All this happened before my very 

 eyes, at a restaurant, and I am not exaggerating one bit. 

 I was imagining the couple abroad, where they looked likely 

 to have gone, at John F. Kennedy international airport, 

 behaving exactly this way. I felt slightly nuked. Why is 

 Prakash Karat afraid of the US? One of our greatest strengths 

 lies in our absolute inability to distinguish between the 

 private and the public and it can devastate any nation. 

 Then why cannot people here bring 

 themselves to pronounce certain words? 

 Take this sample from a manual 

 prepared by the Centre on a subject that is crucial to life, 

 in more than one sense, but cannot be mentioned. The manual 

 is to be used by teachers across classrooms for high-school 

 students, who are to be warned of every danger that attends 

 their age. This is an indecent proposal from a boy to a 

 girl: There is nothing harmful in it, do it for my 

 sake. I do so much for you, wont you do this one thing 

 for me? If a student asked the teacher what did it 

 mean, what would he say? 

 Anyway, thats not my problem; 

 I have learnt to be as discreet. In India, you get away 

 with anything, as long as you dont mention it.

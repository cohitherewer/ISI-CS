 Drape drama

 Tollywoods designer brigade sure is growing in number. The latest to hit film fashion is Chandrani Singh Flora. Having occasionally dressed some leading ladies, Chandrani is now raring to go full-time. 

 One of her recent achievements has been draping Rituparna Sengupta in a black netted sari teamed with a tricolour corset for a premiere party. Rituparna apart, Debashree Roy, Koel Mullick and Rachana Banerjee have tried out her creations. 

 I designed a few shirts for Jisshu and some saris for Debashree in Mahaguru (starring Mithun Chakraborty) recently. Before this, I had worked on Koels wardrobe in Chore Chore Mastuto Bhai, co-starring Mithun and Chiranjeet, says Chandrani, who designs saris, kurtis, corsets and some western wear. 

 Armed with a degree in fashion technology from Wigan amp; Leigh College three years ago, Chandrani didnt have to go through the grind as her parents gifted her a boutique on Sarat Bose Road. But now I regret it, says the mother of a two-year-old boy. Its important to work under a designer.

 Chandranis mother Sharmila Singh Flora is a veteran stylist who has worked closely with the likes of Prosenjit and Indrani Halder. She launched her cosmetic line Floras Cosmetics on Saturday.

 Among the stars, Chandrani found dressing up Debashree the most challenging. She is very particular about her blouse. I had designed a halter-neck blouse to go with a Benarasi sari. Debashree was hesitant, but she finally wore it and turned all heads at a party, smiles Chandrani. 

 Now her dream is to dress Raima Sen in western wear. Raima carries off western clothes really well, adds Chandrani.

 Riteish at the receiving end

While shooting for Heyy Babyy, director Sajid Khan called Riteish and told him it was imperative that he spoke to the Sydney Tourism Board. Riteish recalls: He told me that we have to praise them to get grants. So I called the number Sajid gave me and started praising Sydney: There is no place like Sydney. If after Mumbai, there is a place I would root for it is Sydney.

 When the Sydney Tourism Board at the other end responded by telling Riteish that he had a lot of fans in Sydney, a surprised Riteish, tentatively asked: My fans in Sydney? Are you sure? Later, a female fan called Riteish and revealed that she was from Sydney and that she really admired him. Just when Riteish was ready to fly Sidney high, Akshay Kumar burst his bubble. He told Riteish that the person posing as a member of the Sydney Tourism Board at the other end of the phone line had been he-man Akshay himself and the fan was none other than Vidya Balan. I wanted to strangle both of them... (and Sajid), laughs Riteish.

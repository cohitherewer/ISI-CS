The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 To each his Owen

 Why Clive Owen wants the audience to understand and believe him, rather than like him.

CLIVE OWENS latest film was directed by that master of moodiness, Wong Kar-wai, and lasts all of 20 seconds. In a commercial for Lancmes new mens fragrance shown on television outside Britain and the United States but easily found online he strides down a hall, a suggestive expression on his face, to embrace a beautiful woman. Thats it. Yet this stylised minifilm captures some elemental aspects of his career.

 There is, obviously, the movie-star handsomeness. But there is also his pattern of working with top directors, and above all his minimalist acting style: so much emotion on his face, so little visible movement. That subtle approach, nuanced so the slightest glance registers with the camera, has shaped his finest, deepest work: in 2004 as a jealous, manipulative doctor in Mike Nicholss Closer (he got an Oscar nomination for that), and last year as the disaffected alcoholic who helps save the human race in Alfonso Cuarons visionary Children of Men.

 And arriving almost back to back, his two new full-length films create a moment that highlights his immense versatility. Shoot Em Up begins with an image found in several of his movies, as well as the Lancme spot: an extreme close-up of his eyes, shrewdly hinting at surprises to come. Here the camera pulls back and reveals him to be a rumpled guy sitting on a bench munching a carrot, which he soon uses as a lethal weapon, stabbing a villain through the throat. And if a cartoonish action movie can find a way to exploit his looks, how much easier for Elizabeth: The Golden Age (opening October 12), in which he plays a seductive Walter Raleigh opposite Cate Blanchett as the middle-aged Elizabeth I. Wrenching a line furiously out of context, the films trailer has her take one look at him and say, Well, well in a way suggesting that its Elizabethan for Ooh-la-la. 

 We met in a downtown cafe when he was in New York a few weeks ago. His greenish eyes are wider than they seem on screen, as if he is perpetually surprised; he talks fast, in a casual, friendly way. But one quality sets him apart from most actors and offers a clue to his minimalist approach: he does not need to charm everyone who crosses his path, just as he does not need his characters to be loved on screen.

 The worst piece of advice I was ever given by somebody, a long, long time ago, was Clive, its all about likeability, he said. Even now, Im fearless about that, he said. I dont go into my parts wanting the audience to like me. Im much more interested that they understand and believe me. 

 His fierce refusal to play the likeability game is a huge asset artistically. Even his heroic characters have the depths and shadows of real men. And without an easily-pegged persona, he carries little baggage to the screen. If Tom Hanks is the Nice Guy and Jack Nicholson the Devilish Guy, Clive Owen is whatever guy he happens to play. 

 But that slightly chilly relationship with the public may also account for the one thing missing from his career: a megahit. In last years remake of The Pink Panther he even had a cameo mocking rumors that he was in line to be the new James Bond. Steve Martin, as Inspector Clouseau, walks into a casino where Owen, urbane in a tuxedo, introduces himself: Boswell. Nigel Boswell, he says. Agent 006. Know what that means? Course I do, says Clouseau. You are one short of the big time. (Owen has always said he was never approached for Bond.) 

 Shoot Em Up, the first splashy action movie he has had to carry, is decidedly un-Bond-like, a grittier, more youthful film. His character, known only as Smith, delivers a baby in the middle of a shootout and, with the help of a breast-feeding prostitute, protects the boy from killers. This is not the career choice of someone calculating the next big thing at the multiplex.

 The Looney Tunes carrot sets the tone for violence that is playfully over the top, yet Owen portrays Smith with utter realism. I wouldnt have liked to have done that film nodding all the time, saying, It is ridiculous, you see, its ridiculous, he said. I have always thought cinema audiences are pretty sophisticated, and the heart of screen acting is communicating something as economically and concisely as you can. 

 The Golden Age proves he can play a traditionally dashing romantic hero: in a central scene Raleigh tells Elizabeth about discovering land, describing his adventure in veiled sexual terms. But Shoot Em Up seems more typical: it comes from the part of him drawn to thornier types. 

 People ultimately respect honesty more than they do charm, he said. That, is quite charming in its honesty.

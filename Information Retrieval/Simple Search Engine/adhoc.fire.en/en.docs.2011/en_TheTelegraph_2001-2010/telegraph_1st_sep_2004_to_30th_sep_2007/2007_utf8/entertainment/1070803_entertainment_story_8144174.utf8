The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Mandira not out

Want to criticise Rahul Dravids captaincy? Want to point out the glaring glitches in Sourav Gangulys technique? Want the world to know about your knowledge of the game that you can only sound out to your friends? Well, heres your chance ESPN-STAR is back with another edition of Dream Job. Only this time you also get to become the face of a new channel from their stable STAR Cricket.

 And besides the serious line-up on the jury Ravi Shastri, Wasim Akram, Harsha Bhogle and Alan Wilkins there will be Mandira Bedi to pick the best cricketing brain beyond the pitch. 

 But what is the lady, who revolutionised cricket viewing with SET Max, doing on ESPN STAR? My contract with Max was only till the end of the World Cup and Max has no more cricket, comes the straight drive from Mandira. 

 I got this great opportunity at ESPN-STAR so why not grab it with both hands? This is so much bigger. Max is an entertainment channel which also did cricket. ESPN-STAR is an out-and-out sports channel. The focus is totally different. Its obvious that Mandira has changed sides for good.

 So what is Mandira looking for as the celebrity judge on the show? I am looking for a television talent that loves sport and especially cricket,explains the lady who made spaghetti straps a fashion statement on the box. He has to have the knowledge of the game and the presence of mind. He must be spontaneous and confident.

 But doesnt he have to look good? Its not only about looks, but yes, the person has to be presentable, Mandira says. Someone can be very knowledgeable but may not be that good in front of the camera. So he has to be groomed. After all, the winner would not only be the face of STAR Cricket, the person would have a one-year contract with the network.

 What about Mandiras own contract with the channel? Will she bring her brand of cricket viewing to ESPN-STAR? See, I am not a commentator; I am a presenter and if the opportunity arises, I would love to do a show for this network, Mandira says. 

 As for her long-awaited cricket movie Meerabai Not Out, Mandira reveals that it could not possibly be released during the World Cup after Indias debacle. Otherwise it would have been another Hattrick or Say Salaam India. It should now release in August-September, Mandira whispers. India loves cricket too much to be angry with cricket for long. One NatWest final win like that and it will all be back.

 Dream Job candidates short-listed after phone entries will be called for on-ground auditions at the four metros in the presence of the jury. Starting with Delhi on August 20, Dream Job will travel to Mumbai on August 27, Bangalore on September 3 and Calcutta on September 10.

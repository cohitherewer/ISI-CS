The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 PROMO WATCH

 Mad Caper

 Sanjay Dutt fans will surely be 

 waiting for Dhamaal, his first release after his jail sentence. 

 And although the film has four other prominent actors, there 

 is no doubt that all eyes will be on Dutt. The comic caper 

 promises to be a fun ride from first to last and its 49-second 

 promo sure lives up to its name.

 The opening shot of the Dhamaal 

 promo comes with a warning: Bewareyou might 

 just die laughing which prepares the viewer for what 

 is to follow. 

 iteish, perched atop a tree and 

 making funny faces at a monkey, is introduced as Roy. Arshad 

 Warsi, in a red shirt and playing a trumpet, is Adi. Jaaved 

 Jaafferi, making a desperate attempt to steal a painting 

 and subsequently getting caught, is introduced as Manav. 

 A harried Ashish Chowdhury is Boman. The best is saved for 

 last and Sanjay Dutt, alighting from a white car and sporting 

 cool sunshades, is introduced as Kabir.

 The Dhamaal promo is similar 

 in parts to that of Dhol, which also deals with the antics 

 of four young men. Riteish, Arshad, Jaaved and Ashish are 

 then shown getting into real trouble chased by a 

 mob, getting involved in freak accidents and even sitting 

 in a car which seems to be flying. One shot shows the four 

 of them bound and gagged two with a noose around 

 their necks and perched precariously on the shoulders of 

 the other two.

 In the closing stages of the 

 promo, Sanjay Dutt sprays a gooey substance on Arshad Warsis 

 face while an aeroplane tears through a billboard with Goa 

 written on it in big, bold letters. The last 10 seconds 

 of the promo are the most hilarious Sanjay Dutt 

 is shown brandishing a revolver, seeing which the quartet 

 freezes midway while trying to escape. Aapko aisa 

 kyon lag raha hai ki hum bhaagne waale hai? ask the 

 four. Main guess kar raha tha, replies Dutt.

 The peppy title track plays all 

 through the promo. Not a single woman is shown. Directed 

 by Indra Kumar who has hits like Dil, Beta, Raja and Ishq 

 in the bag, Dhamaal seems to be a paisa vasool flick. Adnan 

 Samis music might well prove to be a plus point. 

 After Munnabhai, Dhamaal reunites the magical jodi of Sanjay 

 Dutt and Arshad Warsi. The film is slated to release on 

 September 7.

 Trivia: The shooting of the film 

 was stalled for a long time when Sanjay Dutt was involved 

 in the TADA case. Now, Dhamaal will be his first release 

 post-arrest.

 What: Loreto Convent Darjeeling Alumni Associations charity Masquerade Ball. 

 Where: Burdwan Palace.

 When: August 25.

 Merry time: When the event is by, of and for old school pals, its hard to go wrong. Friends from the 50s, 60s and 70s got together to remember the good times. Dora Datta and Sumita Banerjee bonded in Loreto Convent, Darjeeling, more than 30 years ago. From the books we studied, to the fun we had, we laughed about everything. We are no longer in Darjeeling but no one can take Darjeeling away from our hearts, smiled Sumita. For Dora, the evening was like the eagerly awaited socials back in school.

 There were graduates from other neighbouring hill schools as well, like North Point, St Pauls, St Josephs Convent, Kalimpong. Mukesh Mirchandani from North Point remembered his school days fondly. I am eager to meet my friends from the hills, beamed Leorina Shah from St Josephs Convent, who had left school in the 90s. After the Loreto Convent Darjeeling pupils sang their school anthem, it was finally dance time. Graceful ballroom dancing, not disjointed disco, ruled the evening. Masks were also pulled on and the mysterious ambience of a masquerade ball was created. Actor Victor Banerjee, in a red kurta, was the show stealer on the dance floor. This gathering is all about well being, happiness and joy and I am enjoying being here, smiled Victor, accompanying wife Maya. The evening was all for fun with a cause, said Maya, secretary of Loreto Convent Darjeeling Alumni Association. The idea is to raise funds for scholarships of students from the school, said Karuna Devi, president, Loreto Convent Darjeeling Alumni Association.

 From the floors

 Badshah and Moumita in bed for Andhokar Hridoy Obdhi. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta

The telefilm: Andhokar Hridoy Obdhi is a murder mystery, starring Moumita Gupta, Badshah Maitra Bidipta and Rajesh Sharma. It will be aired on Tara Muzik on September 2.

 Shooting spot: A house in Dover Lane.

 The bed partners: Are Badshah and Moumita. He is a cop probing the murder of a businessman (Rajesh) and shes a psychiatrist. Getting up close and personal with Moumita is clever cop Badshahs way of drawing the truth out of her, as he suspects she has a hand in the murder. Clad in a baby pink negligee, Moumita moans and groans, while Badshah caresses her, slowly.

 The mood: Is hardly relaxed. The ceiling fan has been switched off and the tiny room with a bed in the middle is stuffy. Moumita is concerned about there being fewer people in the room, but director Birsa Dasgupta has other things on his mind. I want more spontaneity in the scene. I dont want any inhibition; just go with the flow, Birsa urges his actors.

 Actorspeak: My character in this telefilm loves younger men. This is a very passionate scene. Im very comfortable with Badshah, but too many people around is distracting. Otherwise, its just another scene for me. The other day Badshah played my son in the mega serial Khela, chuckles Moumita.

 Badshah seems more relaxed. I have done intimate scenes in the films Teesta and Byatikromi. Its a little difficult when one is not comfortable with the co-actor. But Moumitadi is a very good actor. Here, it was much more spontaneous. Like rolling over each other and being on the verge of kissing; it wasnt in the script, but since Birsa insisted we did it impromptu, says Badshah.

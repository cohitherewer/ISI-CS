 Anirban Banerjee - Instructional Designer

 Anirban Banerjee developed an interest in cooking during his MBA days. He bought his first oven with some money he got on completion of a project and since then, there has been no looking back. The different features of the OTG allowed him ldquo;to try different ways to reinvent traditional cuisines and methods of cooking rdquo;. ldquo;I was really excited about this oven and read up recipe books, talked to my friends and family. From the first overcooked tandoori chicken, I learnt how to cook pretty decently, trying out cakes and exotic tandoori items, rdquo; says Banerjee. 

 Over the past nine years, he has been experimenting and innovating with a number of dishes, cooking on holidays and weekends as a de-stressing and creative activity. ldquo;From the Sunday morning idli and dosa specials to a lavish tandoori meal for friends, cooking has always been a pleasurable activity for me. But I can rsquo;t cook the dal-bhaat variety on an everyday basis, rdquo; says this Indian food junkie.

 Tandoori Chicken

 One whole chicken cut into four large pieces (the chicken should be fatty to enable the cooking process)

 300 g onion

 30 g ginger

 5-6 cloves garlic

 Three green chillis

 Tandoori masala (available in packaged form), one-and-a-half tbsp

 Salt to taste

 Method

 Make a paste out of all the spices. Place the chicken on a large flat-bottomed dish with high edges and make deep incisions in the flesh. Apply the paste on to all the pieces liberally. Cover and keep for five to six hours. 

 No oil is used in this preparation and thus it is important to get a chicken with a lot of fat so the meat cooks in its own juices. Set the oven at 350 deg; F and roast for 45 minutes to an hour, turning the chicken pieces over from time to time, checking to see whether it is done with a fork. Serve on a plate with shredded onion, carrots, bell peppers and lime slices and dig in!

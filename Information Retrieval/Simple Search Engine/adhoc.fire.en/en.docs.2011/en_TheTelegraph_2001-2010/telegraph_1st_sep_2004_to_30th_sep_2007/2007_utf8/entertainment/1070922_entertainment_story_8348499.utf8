 Miss Disarming

 A year-and-a-half ago, Kierston Wareing was all set to leave the acting behind. Having struggled for years to find work, she had qualified as a legal secretary and was enjoying her job as a solicitors clerk in the high court. It felt like it all was falling into place, Wareing laughs. But sods law 

 Last summer, after three months of auditions, Ken Loach, the Palme dOr-winning film director, changed all Wareings plans by casting her in his forthcoming film, Its a Free World. Whenever she came in to see us, she just lit up the room, he says. There is something completely disarming about her, completely appealing.

 Wareing, 29, plays Angie, a young single mum who sets up an employment agency for migrants. Angie is magnetically fanciable, a motorbike-riding, smart-mouthed blonde who negotiates with factory owners in her leathers. Her toughness feels like something to admire, until it hardens into an uglier ruthlessness as she takes bigger risks to maximise her earnings I was thinking, how bad can this woman get? That Angie should be so likeable and engaging was crucial: you feel her scruples falling away all the more keenly.

 Meeting Wareing in the cafe of Londons Institute for Contemporary Arts, the uncalculated charm that won Loach over is apparent. She admits to not having seen any of Loachs films before meeting him, and held off until after she had finished filming Its a Free World. Her unkempt sexiness echoes that of the late Carol White, best known for her appearances in Loachs Up the Junction, Cathy Come Home and Poor Cow. Wareings screen heroines Marilyn Monroe and Brigitte Bardot are the same two White idolised.

 Kierston Wareing grew up on the front in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, and she now owns a property a 10-minute walk from the home where her parents still live. Her mother is a carer in an old peoples home, and her father runs an advertising business for which her 28-year-old brother also works. She was known at home as Faye, but always preferred her middle name Kierston, changing it by deed poll 18 months ago when she realised it only cost 25. Wareing remembers first harbouring acting ambitions at seven. Jodie Foster sparked it.

 After leaving school, she moved to New York with a now ex-boyfriend to study at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute. In New York she was consistently cast in independent films and music videos, but things were harder when she moved back to the UK seven years ago. I couldnt even get an extras agent, she says. Even when she did secure representation, Wareing says she would only be in the running for two roles a year. She added to her CV an appearance in EastEnders as Rowdy girl and the odd music video: one for Oasis alongside Rhys Ifans, one with Pop Idol winner Michelle McManus. Film was so far away it was just a pipe dream.

 You get the impression the past few years have been transformative for Wareing, with Its a Free World being just the latest development. Loach hopes her gutsy performance will kick-start a varied career. What she does (in this film) fits her like a glove. But shes worth too much to be typecast. Wareing gelled easily with Loach (hell hate me saying this but hes like the grandad you never had), his particular approach he allows the actors to see only part of the script at a time suiting her perfectly.

 She was not overawed by the size of the role beforehand, nor could she anticipate Angies frightening trajectory. It was a great way of getting the best performance out of me, not knowing exactly what was in store, she says. Thats how real life works.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Sizzler!

After some dilly-dallying, Indrani Dutta finally took the plunge. The actress has done a sizzling dance number in Purnendu Halders feature film Preyoshi. 

 I was a bit apprehensive initially. I did four to five rehearsals before the final take. The steps are very different from classical dance. Its all contemporary steps. But the director is happy about the way the item number has shaped up, says the trained classical dancer, who sports tight red pants and bustier in the song. I admire Sridevis dancing style. Shes my icon. I loved her steps in the song Hawa Hawai in Mr India, adds Indrani. 

 The Preyoshi track, Bondhu amar aaj raate kachhe dekechhe, has been choreographed by Mumbai-based Kailash. 

 But Indrani has more to do than just move and shake in Preyoshi; she plays a rich, pampered brat called Babli. I play the love interest of Samrat (Mukherjee), while Pauli (Dam) plays his other girlfriend. Though he loves Babli, she is not aware of it and gets married to someone else. The dance number is actually an imagination of Samrat, who thinks of me sitting in a bar, adds Indrani.

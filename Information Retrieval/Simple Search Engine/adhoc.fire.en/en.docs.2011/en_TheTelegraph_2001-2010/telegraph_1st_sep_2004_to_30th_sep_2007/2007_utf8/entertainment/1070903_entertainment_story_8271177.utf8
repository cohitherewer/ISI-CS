 Style stop

The latest offering from designer Abhishek Dutta is a fashion stop at 3A Siddheswari Road. The flamboyant store is divided into two sections pret and couture. The pret is accessible to walk-in customers while the couture section that houses his bridal line can be accessed by prior appointment only. Says Abhishek: Over the past six years, fashion has changed dramatically. The pret and couture demarcation is big now. We have focused on pret since there is a huge demand for it. The idea is to reach out to a greater section of the crowd.

 The decor

 The exterior looks striking with glass, lanterns and textured blue walls. The 850-sq-ft interiors reflect the designers funky image. Carved bamboo doorknobs are an unusual touch. In the pret zone, there are generous doses of wood, stone-finish floors with inlaid grass panels, red and orange walls. A leather treasure chest on a ship bow completes the rugged ship-like look. Adjacent to it is the couture room in pastel and leather. Here the seats in red and black are a striking contrast. And lest the unusual style gets stale, the designer intends to revamp the interiors every eight months. 

 The collection

 The designer element is important but comfort always rules when it comes to pret, says Abhishek. The fabric story revolves around stretch cottons, cotton lycra, linen, soft knits and light denims in a range of colours, ruled by pastels. Applique, laser cuts, enzyme washes, cut work, rubber prints and block printing are some of the accents to be seen.

 Corset-style tops and well-fitted jackets look smart. Then there are skirts, dresses and harem pants. The couture section, on the other hand, comprises saris and lehngas in earthy tones. The mens wear section houses jackets and coats. Giving them company are floral printed shirts with leather cuffs and linen waterproof shirts. The pret line starts from Rs 1,500, while the couture line is tagged at Rs 25,000-plus.

 DDLJ duo back in biz

 Its yesterday once more. The pair that created Bollywood history is back together. Yes, Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, the jodi who urged the nation to Come... fall in love more than a decade ago in Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, will be seen again in Karan Johars next film My Name is Khan.

 Yes, Shah Rukh and Kajol will be doing Karans film, Bunty Behl, whose company Carving Dreams handles Kajols brand account, told t2. It will be great to see the pair together again.

 And so it will, going by the hysteria the pair had created first in Aditya Chopras love epic followed by Karans magnum opus Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham. Thats the last time Shah Rukh and Kajol were paired together, dancing around the pyramids in Egypt to Suraj hua maddham.

 Kajol did make a special appearance in the Mahi ve song in Kal Ho Naa Ho and the Rock roll soniye number in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, both featuring Shah Rukh Khan, but that can hardly be considered as a comeback for the jodi.

 Even when Kajol did make her much-awaited comeback last year it was opposite the other Khan, Aamir, for the Yash Raj Films production Fanaa. When Shah Rukh came on the inaugural Koffee With Karan show this season with Kajol and Rani Mukerji, he made it quite clear he hadnt even seen Fanaa.

 Karan has always approached Kajol for each of his films but the actress, now the mother of Nysa, has always given him the slip. But now that she is back on celluloid, she has agreed to be part of Karans next directorial venture.

 When asked a couple of weeks ago, Karan had not revealed the casting coup simply saying that no one other than Shah Rukh has been cast for that film.

 He did mention that he plans to start shooting My Name is Khan some time next year after his assistant Tarun Mansukhanis multi-starrer (Abhishek Bachchan, John Abraham, Priyanka Chopra) has hit the floors.

 My Name is Khan is KJos take on terrorism, about Muslims in a post 9/11 world and it wont be surprising if Kajol is seen as Shah Rukhs wife in the film, rather than his lady love running through mustard fields.

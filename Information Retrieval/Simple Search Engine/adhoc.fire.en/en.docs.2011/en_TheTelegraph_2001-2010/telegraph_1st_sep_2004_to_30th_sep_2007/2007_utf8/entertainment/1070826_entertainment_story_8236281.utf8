The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Crime amp; cuisine

 Mukul Dev, missing from soaps and serials for quite some time, has surfaced in Tollywood. He is shooting for debutant director Tarun Chatterjees Dando, which also stars Rituparna Sengupta as a feisty lawyer and Kalyan Ray (Aparna Sens husband) as a mafia don.

 Mukul plays a criminal (which explains his lean mean look) suffering from multiple personality disorder. On a stuffy day at Bharat Lakshmi Studios, we caught him munching on muri and chhola bhaja. This is very healthy and keeps you fit, smiled Mukul, who had hit the big screen opposite Bengali bombshell Sushmita Sen in Dastak.

 Ive finished shooting for E. Niwass comedy De Tali with Aftab Shivdasani. Theres a serial Kasme Vaade and the cricket show Full Toss. But Im open to more Bengali films, he announced.

 Mukuls links with Bengali films is not limited to Satyajit Ray and Rituparno Ghosh, whose works he has watched and loved, but extends to Prosenjit. I have watched a couple of Prosenjits films. Hes a superstar here! he said, adding that he was loving his first film shoot in Calcutta. 

 Work apart, food is the other area Mukul plans to explore on this trip. And no, he doesnt want to gorge on rosogolla and mishti doi. For him, its true-blue Shorshe Ilish.

 If Kranti starring Jeet and Swastika (picture right) earned kudos for its slick cuts, the sleaze feast Shapmochan took the cake for the worst visual tricks. All this will change in the next 10 years, promised M. Arul Moorthy, managing director of Digital Magic Visuals Academy, which had supervised the visual effects of both the films and has now opened an animation academy in town.

 Digital Magic Animation Academy, the city branch of the Chennai-based post-production set-up, is operating from 41 Sarat Bose Road. The institute is offering one-year diploma and six-month specialisation courses in animation, which will include Maya interface, lighting, shading and texturing. With TV channels mushrooming, Moorthy feels there wont be a dearth of jobs in the city. We will assure 100 per cent placement. Bengal needs a lot of technically sound manpower, he said. 

 The training will be a great help to the industry, especially since Tollywood mostly churns out low-budget films, felt Kranti director Riingo.

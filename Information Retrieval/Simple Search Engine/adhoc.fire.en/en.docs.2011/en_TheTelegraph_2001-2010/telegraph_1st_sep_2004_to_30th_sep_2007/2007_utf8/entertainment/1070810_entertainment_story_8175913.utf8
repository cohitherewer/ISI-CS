FELUDA'S DIARY 

 Melghat was beautiful, despite the disappointment of the forest being closed, says SABYASACHI CHAKRABORTY

 Achain of more than 100 hills makes up Melghat, in the foothills of the Western Ghats in Maharashtra. We made our trip to this picturesque rocky riverine forest in October some years back. With my family and friends, I drove my grey Tata Sumo down to Melghat Tiger Reserve, via Amravati. The terrain was very rough.

 The forest resthouse at Melghat has six quaint huts perched near a river. Everybody loved the spot. After unwinding for a while, we were all raring to hit the jungle when the forest ranger came up to us and said very bluntly: ldquo;Jungleto abhi bandh hai. rdquo;

 Imagine coming all the way from Calcutta and being told that the tiger reserve is closed! There was great confusion. We learnt that the forest is closed during the monsoon, like anywhere else, but Melghat Tiger Reserve stretches the period till November. But tourists are allowed to come and stay at the resthouse. Everyone was most disappointed. I will never make this mistake again. 

 We had no option but to roam around the outskirts of the jungle. So, we walked along the two-km jungle trail down to the river and back. I took snaps of birds, jungle fowl, frogs and snails. But since Melghat is so beautiful, we still enjoyed our three-day stay.

 Melghat has several peaks and we climbed the highest one. There rsquo;s an echo point where each one of us took photographs. I was surprised to see a lot of predatory birds hovering over the echo point.

 The first night, we heard some weird noises coming from outside. I got a bit scared; I thought it was some animal but couldn rsquo;t recognise what it was. Then, we found out that the sound was coming from a bamboo thicket. I didn rsquo;t know that when bamboos brush against each other in the wind, they creak and make these weird noises!

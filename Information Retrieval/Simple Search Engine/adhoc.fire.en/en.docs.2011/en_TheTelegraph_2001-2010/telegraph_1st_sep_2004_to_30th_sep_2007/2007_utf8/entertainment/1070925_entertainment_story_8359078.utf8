The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Im very simple off-screen

 Udita Goswami

 Four films in four years why do you take long breaks between your movies?

 It is totally out of choice. See, I dont want to sign films just to announce that Im doing so many movies. Its very simple to do that. But if you do any film, film-makers think that there is nothing exclusive about you. I do not want to overexpose myself. And if people think that I was not doing anything since I was away for a year, then let me tell you I have been busy setting up my home. Im very happy with the year that went by.

 I believe you were also busy with stage shows alongside Himesh Reshammiya. Is that fulfilling?

 On stage, there is so much for you to do. When you are performing, you are being yourself. It all depends on how well you interact with the audience. I think most Bollywood actors are very bad on stage. On camera, anybody can look nice; but when a celebrity is on stage its doodh ka doodh and pani ka pani. I really enjoy my stage performances and I think that after all my stage performances, I have become a better actor.

 Aggar is your third thriller after Zeher and Aksar... 

 Actually, to date, I have got my best reviews for Aggar. I dont think I have ever got so many compliments for my acting as Im receiving now. It feels good. When you work with talented actors like Tusshar (Kapoor) and Shreyas (Talpade), they kind of raise the bar for you.

 Why did you choose Aggar?

 Producers Shyam Bajaj and Narendra Bajaj called me for a narration for another movie called Jai Veeru starring Fardeen and Kunal Khemu. But our discussions were not reaching any conclusion. Then they called me again and narrated Aggars script to me and I loved it. I thought it was a much better script than Aksar. Besides, I had worked with director Ananth Mahadevan earlier too, in Aksar. We are friends and share a common love for animals.

 Would you say your career has shaped up the way you would have wanted it to?

 Im happy with the way my career is going. I dont like people judging me. Rather than thinking about what I dont have and being unhappy, I prefer to think about what I have and staying happy.

 Despite being a Bhatt discovery with Paap, why are you not doing more films with them?

 (Irritated) Im neither in the Bhatt camp nor in any other camp. I am too new to be in any camp. Everybody moves on, and so did I.

 How come you are not doing more films with Emraan Hashmi either?

 Yes, there is nothing as of now, but lets see in the future. Right now, Im concentrating on working with different heroes. I want to work with all the talented actors because when you work with them, they raise the bar for you.

 Do you keep in touch with your co-stars?

 No yaar, I think everyone is too busy with his own life.

 You have two movies Amar Joshi Saheed Ho Gaye and Kisse Pyaar Karun that seem to be on hold for a long time now...

 These are both comedy films, which I had shot a long time back. I really dont know what the reason is behind the delay of these films. You know I have crossed the stage where I worry about a film. Sometime back I would get really worried, but not anymore.

 After playing the femme fatale in most of your films, are you trying to expand your range by doing comedy?

 If comedy comes my way, I will be glad to do it because Im good at it. I just need to try different things.

 Your on-screen image is pretty bold. What is Udita like in real life?

 Im very simple off-screen. I am perfectly happy eating Maggi or simple meals. I like to stay at home and spend time with my dog. I dont really like going out nor am I into designer clothes. I could wear a simple Rs 100-200 top from a roadside market as long as it looks cool on me.

 Coming from Dehradun, would you say you have settled down to life in Mumbai?

 I didnt come to Mumbai directly from Dehradun. I have stayed in Delhi. There is not much of a difference between the two metropolitan cities. Yes Dehradun to Delhi was a huge change for me. You know, Mumbai is such a small place, you will always bump into known faces. Yesterday, I just bumped into one of my friends from Delhi. This can happen only in Mumbai.

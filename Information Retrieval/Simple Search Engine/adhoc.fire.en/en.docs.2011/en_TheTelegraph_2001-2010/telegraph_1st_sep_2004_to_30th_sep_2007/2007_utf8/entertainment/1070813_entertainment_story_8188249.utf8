The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Me?Monica

 I, Monica Bedi, gangster Abu Salems former moll, alleged to have been married to him, have learnt the magic of detox in prison. Today, our environment is toxic and the food we eat, the water we drink and the air we breathe in, especially the air with Salem around, is laden with chemicals foreign to my system. So I embarked on the detox drive to purify myself from within and without, starting from the bottom of my heart and working up to the pores of my 

skin, and today 

I declare myself clean. 

I used selective memory 

and new fashion statements. I metamorphosed. 

Heres how I did it...

 Stage 1: The process began early enough, when the talk of my extradition with Salem from Portugal was at its height around May 2005. I enrolled in an online detox programme. I started to wear less revealing clothes, because I didnt want revealing photographs. I also applied for asylum in Portugal, where Salem and I had run away. I said I was married to a Muslim and would not be treated in a fair way in India.

 Stage 2: But I am extradited anyway on November 11, with Salem. Next day, I am taken to Hyderabad, where I am put behind bars in Chanchalguda jail. I am wanted in connection with three fake passports, one of which was issued from Andhra Pradesh. On that day, I am still wearing an animal print top from which I am squeezing out, but you will notice the cleavage display has already shrunk. I am also wearing a little foundation, some lipstick and mascara and eye shadow, but my most notable accessory is a sturdy policewoman.

 Stage 3: I am already free of some real wrinkles in my brain. I stun the court in Hyderabad on November 19 by saying that I am not married to Abu Salem. I repeat to the court that I am single.

 I also tell the court that all the three fake passports allegedly used by me the first was in the name of Neha Jaffri; the second, issued in Bhopal in June 2001, was in the name of Fauzia Usman; the third was a Pakistani passport in the name of Sana Kamal were obtained under Salems influence.

 In jail, I begin to eat more rotis and avoid rice.

 Stage 4: The difference begins to show. During my numerous visits to the court, which are very well photographed, the new woman in me begins to surface. I have dropped make-up, my skin looks fresh. I never look up, I contemplate my feet and look downcast. If I have to smile, I just stretch my lips. I look contrite.

 But the biggest change: I am into salwar kurtas. I have chosen cotton. During this time, one day my father visited me in jail. His jaw dropped. His dear daughter was in a cotton salwar kameez! I told him that cotton was the best cloth for the dry and dusty cell where she now lived.

 Stage 5: In September 2006, the CBI sentenced me to five years rigorous imprisonment for cheating, criminal conspiracy and impersonation while securing a fake passport in Kurnool district in Andhra Pradesh. I filed an appeal at the high court.

 By this time, salwar kurtas are my second skin. Abu Salems name does not crop up so much in reports on me. I have lost nearly 10 kg. To avoid sunburn, I have chosen indoor activities like tailoring and embroidery in jail, rather than making soap outside. I also teach dance and yoga to other women inmates.

 Stage 6: From March 2007, things speed up. Andhra Pradesh High Court reduces my term by two years, as I was already in prison in Portugal for nine months. I have spent two years and four months in prison.

 On July 16, I am acquitted by a Bhopal court in another fake passport case. On July 25, after a favourable order from the Supreme Court that said that I would not have to surrender my original passport (yes, I had one of those, too) as it was lost, I was released from the Chanchalguda jail, in jeans and a pink kurta, and was received by my father.

 I was looking like a flower (much better than that Kangana Ranaut in Gangster). I could be mistaken for a demure daughter, which I had become. I looked so nice against the gods and goddesses at the family altar, in my village Hoshiarpur in Punjab, where I was born. Though my parents later settled in Norway. 

 I have a number of film offers. I also want to play a policewoman and act with Amitabh Bachchan and the latter may be easier.

 I have come a long way. I can even retox.

 Main Monica Bedi hoon.

Fengshui

Pinky Kapoor answers your Feng Shui queries

 I have started a new business connected with post-production of ad films. The office is spread over three levels. My chamber is on the first floor, facing south-west. Though I am doing well, there is a lot of wealth drainage. The marketing staff is also lazy, which further hampers the growth of my business. The compound gate faces the building gate, which in turn faces the back gate. Could this be the reason for wealth not being retained in office? Please suggest remedial measures.

 Kartik 

 You office breaks the golden rule of Feng Shui, where three doors are in the same line. The energy that enters from the front door flows through the second door and escapes through the back door. This is a sure sign of drainage of wealth.

 It is always desirable to have a curved walkway to the front door from the compound gate to encourage the gentle flow of chi into your office. This can be done by placing a round earthen pot filled with water and floating flowers between the compound and the main gate to the office. The back door should be sealed.

 Relocate the marketing staff towards the north-west of the office. The ruling movement energy of this area will not let anybody laze around.

 According to the kua number calculated by the year of birth, my husband belongs to the west group while I belong to the east. How should we sleep? His favourable direction is south-west, but it is not possible for us to place the bed in this position. How should we place the bed?

 Sheetal 

 If a couple belongs to different groups, then the wife must follow her husband rsquo;s auspicious directions and sleep accordingly. If you cannot place the bed in the south-west, then the second, third or fourth favourable directions can be considered. These would be north-west, north-east and west.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Im afraid of lizards amp; heights

My nickname is: Tush.

 I got my first pocket money: When I was in the fourth standard. It must have been Rs 15 or 20.

 As a child: I was very confused. One day I wanted to be a pilot, the next day I wanted to be a businessman and then an actor.

 I was scolded by my parents when: At an unedited, four-hour long trial of my dads film, I jumped from one seat to another and ran to touch the screen. My mom took me home in the interval and thrashed me.

 I was at my wackiest best: When I appeared on the TV show Lola TV. I was kinda rude and Lola walked off the show. I told her she should be one of the vamps in my sisters (Ektaa) serials.

 I love gorging on: Pizzas, burgers...

 Im nostalgic about: My life in the 80s when we lived in our old house at Pali Hill.

 Im scared about: Losing the people Im close to; also of being betrayed.

 I want to change: The fact that I think a lot about everything.

 My most memorable day: May 25, 2001. Metro theatre the first day, first show of my first film Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai.

 One thing about me that very few people know: Im afraid of lizards and heights. I have vertigo.

 The place I am gaga about: Im nostalgic about Detroit in the US because I studied there. I love Los Angeles too.

 nI was embarrassed when: I was doing a restaurant scene for my first film and I was unable to get it right. I heard the junior actors mumbling Damn its so hot and this guy is not getting the shot. He needs to open up and he needs experience.

 The fictional character I associate myself with: Archie.

 If I were to co-star with a Hollywood actress and teach her Hindi then it would have to be: Meryl Streep. I am a big fan of her and Ive learnt a lot from her.

 If Ektaa Kapoor were to become the president of India: She would make chocolates free for the whole country and get all her serials cleared by and beamed on all channels.

 When Im nervous: I meditate and psyche myself into getting over it.

 The casting couch: Is for people who are willing to offer themselves.

 My college days were: Wacky. The two years in NM college were completely useless. We would hang out all the time, watch movies, attend socials and eat junk. My years in Detroit, Michigan, were responsible for my mental growth as a person.

 The song that makes me go wild: Turn me on by Kevin Lyttle.

 The worst pick-up line that somebody has used on me: There was this girl at a nightclub who came up to me and asked, Are you like an actor? I instantly knew she was putting on an act.

 The craziest dream I have ever had: A bhoot would follow me outside our old house which was on a slope. I would hide myself but it would find me.

 I cannot live without: My cellphone.

 Love is: The most beautiful experience one can have. It changes your life for the better or worse.

 I date: No particular person, I date whenever the opportunity arises.

 If I had a last 10-rupee note I would: Give it to a beggar. What can you buy with Rs 10 nowadays?

 One actor who could give me a run for my money: Is Hrithik Roshan. He is giving everyone a run for their money, where discipline, determination and hard work are concerned. No one to beat him.

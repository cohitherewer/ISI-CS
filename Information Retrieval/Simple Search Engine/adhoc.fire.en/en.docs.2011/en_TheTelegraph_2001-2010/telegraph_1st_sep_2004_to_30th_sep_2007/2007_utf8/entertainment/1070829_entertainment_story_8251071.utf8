 Spotlight - Judo Ramu

Who is he?

 The man behind all action in Tollywood. He has taught Mithun how to send an army of 100 bad men flying into the air (Minister Fatakesto), trained Jeet in sword fight (Jor) and armed Prosenjit with the power punch (Refugee, Sangharsha...). Judo Ramu born Ramu Murthy in Chennai has been the fight director for more than 75 Bengali films. His first was Aami Shei Meye, starring Prosenjit.

 Following in the footsteps of his father...

 My father Judo Ratnam was a stunt director for more than 100 Kannada films. I grew up watching him. But he was dead against me taking up the profession. One day, I bunked college to see Bruce Lees Enter The Dragon. I ended up watching it 25 times. That was the turning point; I almost immediately decided to be a stuntman, laughs the black belt in karate, looking back at his two-decade-long career.

 It was Prosenjit who got him into Bengali films...

 I was doing Kannada and Oriya films when Bumbada (Prosenjit) asked me to work in Tollywood. After Aami Shei Meye, he did Pratibaad and has been a regular ever since.

 A close shave on the sets of a Rajanikanth film...

 Has put Ramu on his guard. I was Rajanikanths stuntman in the Kannada film Mannan, where I had to ride a horse. I fell off and hurt myself badly. From then on I became very cautious. Thats my only advice to the actors calculate time and be careful.

 Now he is busy beating up goons...

 With Jeet in Swapan Sahas Jor, Prosenjit in Prashant Nandas Kali-Sankar and Mithun in Milan Bhowmicks Satyameva Jayate. There are a couple of films down south too. 

 His favourite leading men are...

 Bumbada. But teaching stunts to Mithunda and Jeet is also great fun. Mithunda picks up very fast. Jeet too is a quick learner.... I am in awe of Jackie Chan and Sunny Deol.

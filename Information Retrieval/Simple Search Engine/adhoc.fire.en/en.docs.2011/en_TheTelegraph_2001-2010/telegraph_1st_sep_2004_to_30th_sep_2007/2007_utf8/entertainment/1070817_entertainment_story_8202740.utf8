 Small talk

 Karan Oberoi and Himani Kapoor 

Mom rsquo;s back 

 Shahid Kapurs mom and one-time film actress Neelima Azeem will make a comeback on the small screen with Aek Chabhi Hai Padoss Mein. Heres what Neelima has to say on her comeback, After a four-year gap, I felt the need to get back to work. Despite the fact that there is a lot of work happening these days, there wasnt much that I believed in. But I completely liked the idea of Aek Chabhi Hai Padoss Mein because here was a serial that I could identify with. It can be compared to Nukkad, in the sense that they are both set in small mohallas and belong to the same genre. Neelima plays a positive role in the serial. My character is warm, lovable, charming and believes in relationships. Shes a woman with a zest for life and Im sure audiences too will identify with her, signs off Neelima.

 Rakhi rage

 During Zee TVs Titan Antakshari shoot recently, Himani Kapoor went running after Karan Oberoi to tie a rakhi on his wrist. Everyone was enjoying the fun till Karan got very irritated and screamed across the floor: Dont irritate me. Others on the sets didnt know how to react to this, resulting in an awkward silence descending on the floor. Shouldnt we read something into Karans reluctance to be Himanis rakhi bro?

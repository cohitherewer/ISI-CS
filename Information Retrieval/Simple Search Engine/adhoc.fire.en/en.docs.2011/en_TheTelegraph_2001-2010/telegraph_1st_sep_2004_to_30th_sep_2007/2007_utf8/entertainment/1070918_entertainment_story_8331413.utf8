The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 SRK, all 

the way

 KARAN JOHAR on his style statement and his fashion likes and dislikes

My favourite outfit for a formal occasion: Nothing to beat a suit.

 My favourite outfit while at work: Track pants and a T-shirt. Comfort is of prime importance when you have to concentrate on making a film.

 My favourite outfit for a casual outing: I like to wear tight-fit jeans and a full-sleeves T-shirt. Earlier, when I was overweight, I wore half-sleeves shirts and drawstring pants. Now I can be more experimental with my clothes. One should try and keep ones waist size within 34 inches. Sporty clothes suit you only if you have a well-toned body.

 My favourite accessory for a semi-formal occasion: I like to sport Versace and Prada jackets.

 Brand awareness is: A part of my psyche. I must admit I am a brand person. But I dont blindly veer towards brands. A rule that I think everyone should follow is: try your clothes before buying them. For example, Gap and Iceberg fit me better than Levis though the latter has great jeans.

 My favourite designers: DKNY, Armani, Versace Sport. Guccis belts and shoes are fabulous.

 My favourite Indian outfit: Kurtas. I do mad things like tearing up saris to make kurtas. I think I look best in a Pathani Salwar.

 My favourite colour: I love earthy tones like rust and burgundy. Black is a perennial but one can also try out soft colours like powder blues, mint and cream.

 My favourite fabric: Linen, especially for summer. It keeps you cool and makes you look smart.

 My favourite accessories: Dark Gucci glares. I also like Alexandra McQueen sunglasses. They are incredible. But I rarely wear the glasses over my eyes, they are usually perched on my head.

 I love shopping in: Milan. Italians are amazing fashion designers, especially Roberto Cavalli. I also like shopping at Selfridges, Bond Street and on Kings Road in London.

 The best-dressed man in the industry is: Shah Rukh Khan.

 The best dressed woman in the industry is: Hema Malini. She exudes class.

 My most expensive outfit: A winter jacket I left behind in London!

 My favourite cologne: 212 Cologne for men by Carolina Herrera.

 A fashion suggestion: A good fit is a must. For the premiere of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, I wore a badly-fitted black suit. I had designed it to my old measurements. I looked mad.

 The texture of my hair is: Thick. I have inherited it from my mother. Unfortunately, I have also inherited her migraine and rheumatism.

 My hair colour: The grey in my hair, I inherited from my father. I colour my hair with LOreal.

 When I want to make hair more manageable: I gel it.

 I envy the hairstyle of: No one. I have a good crop myself, but I like the way Shah Rukhs hair flops on his face.

 I admire the hair of: Dimple Kapadia. Even today, when I see her in Saagars Maria song, I marvel at her auburn tresses.

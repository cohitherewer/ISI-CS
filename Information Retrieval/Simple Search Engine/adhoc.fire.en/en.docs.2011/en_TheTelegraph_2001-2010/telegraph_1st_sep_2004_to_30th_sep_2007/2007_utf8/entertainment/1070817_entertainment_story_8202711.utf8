The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Laugh out loud

 A moment from One Into Two. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta

 For four days on the trot, Aamir Raza Husain made city theatregoers laugh their lungs out with One Into Two. The 90-minute comedy designed and directed by Husain is about a London cabbie, John Smith, with two wives. One lives in Stratham, the other in Wimbledon. 

 John, a successful but tired bigamist for three years, spends his days flitting between Mary and Barbara. He keeps a diary to help him remember things like HDB (Half Day Barbara) or LNBEMM (Late Night Barbara Early Morning Mary).

 One day, he is taken to hospital with mild concussion and thats when John has to handle two irate wives, two prying detectives and two nosy neighbours, Stanley Gardner and Bobby. Finally, he blurts out his well-guarded secret under pressure.

 The play by British scriptwriter Peter Seasons plays with words and mistaken identities. Husain makes an appearance as neighbour Stanley. I usually prefer not to act and fall into that trap when Im directing. I slip into a role when I cant find a good actor, said Husain, after the Monday performance at The Sonar Calcutta. His wife Virat Husain plays one of the wives.

 One Into Two rides a budget of Rs 7-8 lakh, and thats nothing unusual. Husains repertoire boasts of huge mobile sets, often touching Rs 1.5 crore. But whether it is big or small, historical or contemporary, serious or absurd, I believe there are only two kinds of theatre good and bad, smiled the Delhi-based theatre director.

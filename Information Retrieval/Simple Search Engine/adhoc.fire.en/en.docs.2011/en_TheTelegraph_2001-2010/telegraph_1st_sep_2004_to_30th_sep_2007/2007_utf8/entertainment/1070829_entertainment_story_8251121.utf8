 Eat smart

 Long hours, high levels of stress, endless cups of coffee, irregular eating habits and lack of exercise the perfect combination for workplace blues. Carrying meals from home can be a drag, and so the easiest option often is ordering from local fast food/Chinese/Mughlai restaurants and takeaways. They may offer a quick and tasty bite but as soon as that grease starts to show on your waistline watch closely, its coming! you know you have gone too far.

 Here are our quick tips on how to beat the workplace bulge:

 Eating out every day is a really bad idea and try to avoid it by carrying food from home which requires little effort to prepare. Carry roti rolls, which could have veggies or chicken inside as these can be eaten while working or on the move, advises clinical nutritionist Anu Jhunjhunwala.

 A healthy and wholesome breakfast is extremely important for people leading hectic lives and it should include cereals like oats or muesli with low fat or skimmed milk along with an egg (just the white) and some fruit. 

 Snack healthy. Carry apples and guavas rather than fruit juices as they are calorific and lack the fibre contained in the actual fruit. Keep light snacks like roast chira (rice flakes) and biscuits in your drawer to munch on as alternatives to samosas or kachoris and, finally, it is very important that a good diet should be well balanced with a workout, says the diet expert.

 At the end of the day, as age catches up, work-hard-party-harder has to give way to moderation. I think it is important to understand that my body is precious and I want it to go the distance, feels Rahul Sen, a designer who spends many hours in closed workspaces. I take care to never push it too hard and balance all my bad habits with equally good ones like yoga and meditation along with eating lots of greens. I try to avoid too much beer or meat and jog and cycle to keep the body running well.

 Eating right may be half the battle but there are no shortcuts on sweat. If the gym doesnt excite you, try yoga or even a simple jog every morning. Leave a tad early and walk half the distance to work. 

 And dont even glance at those chocolates for now.

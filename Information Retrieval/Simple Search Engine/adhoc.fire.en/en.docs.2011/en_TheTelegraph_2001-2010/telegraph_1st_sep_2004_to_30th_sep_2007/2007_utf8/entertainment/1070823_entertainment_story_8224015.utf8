The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Ciao Calcutta!

 Agostino Pinna

 Former Italian consul-general Agostino Pinna spoke to t2 on his experience in Calcutta days before leaving town. Excerpts:

 What was your perception of Calcutta before you arrived? Was it matched by the reality?

 My impressions were almost inevitably shaped a lot by Mother Teresa and Dominique Lapierre, and I must say those poorest of poor images dont do justice to the city at all. Once I settled down and mixed around, I realised how vibrant Calcutta was in its arts and cultural scene and how knowledgeable people were here. 

 Also, I think I came at the right time since the government was trying hard to project a modern image of the city and everywhere you looked, new restaurants, retail malls and nightclubs were coming up. So, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.

 What were the key projects on your agenda during your tenure as consul-general and what were the major success stories?

 The core thrust was on strengthening ties between Italy and Bengal and the process had already been set in motion by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees visit to Italy prior to my arrival. 

 The biggest event during my stint was undoubtedly the visit of Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, with the largest-ever business delegation.

 The second objective was to create an instrument to promote bilateral trade, for which the Indo-Italian Chamber of Commerce was revived. 

 A major shot in the arm for Calcutta will be the opening of the Italian Trade Commission office in the city in October. With so many trade offices being shut down in Europe, the opening of the Calcutta office will send out extremely positive signals to Italian business captains.

 Education has been another key area and a number of Italian universities have inked tie-ups with institutions here, like the JU-Verona pact. Our roadshow, Invest your talent in Italy, has also been a success.

 Besides, there has been a 50 per cent jump in applications following simplification of visa procedures and a sum of 3 million euros was sanctioned as the second phase of technical support for Roopkala Kendra.

 You have been the most visible consul-general at most parties in town. Calcuttas social life seems to have grown on you

 When I arrived, I didnt know Calcutta had such an active social circuit and so many nice places to go to. As I started attending some of the parties, I made friends with many interesting people and I have to say my stay here has been so much more enjoyable, thanks to them.

 Any regrets?

 Yes, may be not being able to bring a big musical event, an opera or a glamorous fashion show to Calcutta, for which we needed more resources. Also, I would have loved to bring Umberto Eco to this city of great intellectuals.

 What is the fondest memory you are carrying back?

 Well, Italy won the World Cup (in Germany last year) after 24 years and I watched the match on TV here in Calcutta. This was a moment Ill savour because who knows, we might have to wait another 24 years for the next one!

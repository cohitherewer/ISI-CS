The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 World is a football

 WHY FOOTBALL SCORES OVER CRICKET

 You spend just an evening, not a full day or a full five days, watching it.

 Its played in shorts how can any game be played in pants?

 Its a running game, not a fetch-and-put-your-hands-in-your-pocket game.

 Its played by big boys shoulder crashing against shoulder, the crunch of ankle against ankle, head against head. In cry-baby cricket, youll get life suspension for any of the above.

 In cricket we know Team India cant climb much higher; with a rank of 152, in football we can climb Everest.

 What better sight than Maradona dribbling past three defenders!

 Top footballers make more money in a year than a top cricketer does in a lifetime.

 No commercial breaks after every three/four minutes.

 Football WAGs (Linda Evangelista, Adriana Karembou) far sexier than cricket WAGs.

 Anyone cuter than Cristiano Ronaldo in cricket?

 The worlds coolest people, the Italians and the French, are good at it.

 And oh, the boys and babes of Brazil!

BHAICHUNG on the ball

 Last week, Bhaichung Bhutia made bigger news than Sachin Tendulkar. And with good reason. The night after he led Team India to the Nehru Cup triumph, Poulomi Banerjee caught up with the champagne-drenched soccer champ during a party at Hushh...

 Q Winning the Nehru Cup must be a big boost for you and for the game you love

 Its a great win for the team and its a great win for India. It feels wonderful (smiles).

 Q India is such a cricket-crazy nation. Has there ever been a point in your career when you felt that you would have rather played cricket?

 Never. One plays for the love of the game. I think for every sportsperson its his/her game that matters. I love football and thats what matters to me. I have never felt like playing anything else.

 QHave we become a nation of world rather than local football watchers?

 That is the common belief. But this win has given us immense exposure, and it has also shown that people do follow our football. The kind of response that the game evoked in Delhi was very pleasant.

 Q Do you intend to use your current cult status to inspire more youngsters to take up the game?

 I havent thought about it, and I have not chalked out plans to inspire youngsters. I think the important thing for us is to keep on doing well. People will automatically be attracted to the game if the team continues its good work. 

 Q In a country of cricket stars, you are our answer to David Beckham. How does that feel?

 Its really for the people to say what they think of me. What can I say?(Smiles)

 Q Who is your favourite footballer? Diego Maradona. For his style of play.

 Q You are a very stylish sportsperson. How do you define style? For me comfort is the most important thing and style too has to be comfortable. I do follow trends, but I am not particular about brands or designer-wear. I buy what I ike.

 Q Chak De! India has sparked a lot of interest in hockey. If there is a similar film on football, would you be interested in acting in it?

 No! (Smiles) I enjoy movies and I would like to watch Chak De! India. I havent had the time to watch it yet. But I am not interested in acting in any film. I am happy on the field.

 REview 

 Tryst with destiny

 August 15, 1947: As the whole

 country rejoiced at their newfound independence, one

 Indian was more interested in the sweets that were

 being distributed and not the flags with them.

 That

 was the ldquo;tryst with destiny rdquo; of Harilal

 Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, a streetside beggar by

 the time Nehru was announcing India rsquo;s arrival

 to the world.

 As

 a father-son story, Feroz Abbas Khan rsquo;s Gandhi

 My Father is not very different from Ramesh Sippy rsquo;s

 Shakti but it is the historical backdrop which turns

 everything upside down. In fact, there is so much

 of shock value in the going-ons that Khan (also the

 writer) has to deliberately jam the brakes on the pace

 to help the audience soak it all in.

 The

 inner angst of Junior Gandhi mdash; that rsquo;s what

 Harilal was called in Phoenix Settlement in South Africa mdash; was

 so deep that he would try to change his future by changing

 religions as fast as he changed his clothes and appearances.

 But it was the past he couldn rsquo;t rid himself of. ldquo;Mera

 itihas lambi hai aur bhugol gol, rdquo; he cries in

 despair.

 Thanks

 to a father who would ldquo;define the meaning of

 independence and then set its parameters rdquo;,

 Harilal was lost in his lineage. As years passed,

 he kept getting tonked around back and forth from

 South Africa to India and internally things got so

 bitter that at one point of time he says: ldquo;Whenever

 I fail, he (Gandhi) succeeds. rdquo;

 But

 interestingly, they would both come back to each other

 from time to time looking for redemption. Harilal

 would first seek Gandhi rsquo;s permission, then his

 money and then even his identity. He almost tells himself: ldquo;I rsquo;m

 Gandhi rsquo;s son; how can I cheat? rdquo; Gandhi,

 on the other hand, realises that he could have done

 so much more for his elder son but cannot take out

 time to do so. In a telling scene, he asks Harilal

 to come back to him but, as the train rolls out of

 the station, he has to leave him there.

 Yes,

 producer Anil Kapoor is right mdash; this is a story

 that had to be told. And told with the responsibility

 that Feroz Khan brings on board. You can feel an overtone

 of Mahatma Gandhi rsquo;s insensitivity towards his

 son but the director never screams it out. Because

 he comes from a rich background of theatre, Khan rsquo;s

 script tends to become episodic in parts. But the

 stage-to-screen switch works with the stress on physical

 acting by the main players. Feroz also uses close-ups

 of on-lookers to great effect.

 Harilal

 is Akshaye Khanna and not the other way round. Letting

 go of his familiar dimpled chuckles, Akshaye sinks

 into the role seamlessly. And the scene when he comes

 shivering home to his dead wife looks set to become

 one of the finest pieces of acting in the history

 of Indian cinema.

 Darshan

 Zariwalla is so effective as Gandhi that you never

 miss Sir Ben Kingsley, which is quite an achievement.

 Even Shefali Shah and Bhoomika Chawla are knockouts

 as the ladies caught in the middle. Another hero of

 the enterprise is cinematographer David McDonald who

 uses natural lighting and colour schemes to great

 effect.

 The

 silhouettes stay with you and so does the lingering

 question: Was Gandhigiri a fool-proof formula?

 Broke and boring

 If Anubhav Sinha needed a

 reminder that the Dus magic may not necessarily work

 so well a second time, Cash is it. If bikes, babes,

 thrills and spills made a film, then Cash would be

 right there on top of the list. Unfortunately, this

 Dhoom meets Oceans series flick is too much style

 and just no substance. Billed as ldquo;a high octane

 heist thriller rdquo;, Cash is anything but. The action

 sequences (by Anthony Stone) and the picturesque

 South African locales are the only redeeming features

 of the film. What could have been a slick, well-executed

 thriller simply falls flat on its face, despite a

 fair share of animation mdash; rarely seen in Bollywood mdash; thrown

 in.

 The

 film opens our eyes to a host of things: South Africa

 is apparently a country where you will find an Indian

 in every nook and cranny mdash; pubs, bars, roads,

 shops and even in the police force. Even if we were

 to believe this, given its sizeable Indian-origin population,

 we can rsquo;t quite buy non-Indians conversing in

 Hindi.

 Cash

 would also have us believe that it is ample doses

 of cleavage that makes a film. The leading ladies mdash; Dia

 Mirza, Shamita Shetty and Esha Deol mdash; flash their

 assets with such aplomb that we don rsquo;t really

 blame the director for having forgotten to have a

 script for this film.

 Cash

 also suggests that cops in South Africa are a pretty

 useless bunch who struggle throughout the film to

 catch a couple of petty robbers from India. They are

 headed by a ldquo;no-nonsense cop rdquo; Shamita,

 who is otherwise very intelligent, but is not aware

 through the film that her boyfriend happens to be

 the mastermind behind the heist.

 While

 Dus had an engaging narrative

 and knockout performances, Cash lacks in these departments

 too. A gaunt looking

 Ajay Devgan is simply not in form and Suniel Shetty

 hams from the first frame to the last. Zayed Khan,

 as expected,

 sleepwalks through the film while Esha Deol has

 nothing

 to do (apart from flashing cleavage, that is). Dia

 Mirza and Riteish do well in their small roles while

 Shamita is no patch on sister

 Shilpa rsquo;s tough-cop 

 act

 in Dus. A cameo by Ayesha Takia does nothing,

 either.

 So,

 it is left up to the

 questionable charms of Mindblowing

 mahiya to fill some seats.

 Hollywood Review 

 Hitting the road

 The Four Little Piggies mdash; Wild

 Hogs, the real title, doesn rsquo;t work as well mdash; is

 a comedy about male midlife anxiety. Some of us may

 not find the subject so funny, but never mind. Somebody

 needed to revive the City Slickers formula, and this

 time the job has gone to Brad Copeland, who wrote

 the screenplay, and Walt Becker, who directed.

 Four buddies, fed up with

 the frustration and disappointment

 of their lives, set out on a road trip aboard their

 beloved motorcycles. Doug (Tim Allen), a dentist,

 worries that he has become so dull and uncool that

 he has lost the respect of his pre-adolescent son.

 Woody (John Travolta) is a hotshot deal maker who has

 lost his wife and his money. Bobby (Martin Lawrence),

 a plumber turned writer, is hopelessly henpecked,

 while Dudley (William H. Macy) is a hopeless nerd.

 (He is also at least the second character in a comedy

 released this year, after Diane Keaton rsquo;s in Because I Said

 So, whose computer gets stuck on a noisy Internet porn

 site, a situation he is unable to remedy. This kind

 of thing must happen a lot to Hollywood screenwriters.)

 The main thing about these guys mdash; the main source

 of the movie rsquo;s fumbling attempts at humour mdash; is

 that they rsquo;re not gay. Really. Seriously. No way.

 They may worry about people thinking that they rsquo;re

 gay, and they may do things that might make people

 think that they rsquo;re gay mdash; dance, touch one

 another, take off their clothes, express emotion mdash; but

 they rsquo;re absolutely 100 per cent not gay. No no

 no no no no. No sir, I mean, no ma rsquo;am. That rsquo;s

 what makes it funny, see.

 After

 camping out one night, for example, they have a conversation

 that rsquo;s overheard by a highway patrolman (John

 C. McGinley) who decides, based on his misunderstanding

 of the perfectly innocent things they rsquo;re saying,

 that they must be gay. But the thing is mdash; get

 this mdash; he rsquo;s the one who rsquo;s gay! You

 think he rsquo;s a stereotypical homophobe, but he

 turns out to be a homophobic stereotype. It rsquo;s

 magic!

 Anyway,

 the four non-gay guys run afoul of some real bikers mdash; one

 of whom might be gay! mdash; and have to prove their

 manhood by standing up to the bullies. In the process,

 one of them gets it on with Marisa Tomei in the most

 non-gay way imaginable within the limits of a PG-13

 movie. The wives of the two who still have wives show

 up, proving, well, you know. And the fourth one? Could

 it be? Shut up!

 Lawrence

 and Allen, who have never aspired very far beyond

 their affable television-comedy personas, are easier

 to watch than Travolta or Macy, who both undertake

 what can only be called acting. This is more than

 the picture deserves, but then again, so is Ray Liotta,

 as the chieftain of the bad bikers, and so is Tomei.

 Wild

 Hogs does deserve credit for a small but significant

 measure of originality. Its soundtrack is full of

 classic, open-road rock rsquo;n rsquo; roll songs mdash; Highway

 To Hell, for example mdash; not one of which is Born

 To Be Wild. Wild Hogs is rated PG-13 (parents strongly

 cautioned). It has swearing, fighting and sexual innuendo.

 But don rsquo;t get the wrong idea.

 Birds on Board

 Ever since Luc Jacquet rsquo;s

 endearing documentary March of the Penguins persuaded

 Hollywood that penguins are the new Bambis, we have

 endured singing, wisecracking and even tapdancing versions.

 Now, treading eagerly on the flippers of last year rsquo;s

 Happy Feet, comes Surf rsquo;s Up, a computer-animated

 comedy featuring birds on boards.

 To

 deliver its winning-isn rsquo;t-everything message,

 this ho-hum addition to the kiddie canon follows

 Cody Maverick (engagingly voiced by Shia LaBeouf),

 a young Rockhopper penguin with surfing in his blood

 and dreams of greatness in his head. Trailed by a

 documentary film crew, the fatherless Cody (Dad was

 eaten by a killer whale) heads for his first professional

 surfing competition, at which he will learn about

 love, perseverance and the feet-of-clay principle.

 Assisting

 in his education is a washed-up champ (Jeff Bridges),

 a coy lifeguard (Zooey Deschanel) and the reigning

 titleholder (Diedrich Bader), whose relationship with

 his trophies borders on the indecent.

 Directed

 by Ash Brannon and Chris Buck (both contributed to

 the screenplay), Surf rsquo;s Up has a friendly, blue-collar

 vibe (Cody is an ex-fish-sorter from the Shiverpool,

 Antarctica) and some sly, low-key humor. Nevertheless,

 a moratorium on penguins might be called for, despite

 the inevitable anthropomorphic void. Lord help us if

 Ratatouille is a hit.

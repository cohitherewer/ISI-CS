The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Box Office

 Heyy Babyy

 Funnyman Sajid Khans directorial debut has had a big opening in city theatres. The laugh riot has clicked.

 Pro: Akshay, Fardeen and Riteish; the one liners; the music

 Con: If this is not your brand of humour it all seems quite stupid and so the film tends to drag; Vidya Balan is a misfit

 Ratatouille

 This animated film based on the culinary aspirations of a rat has had a decent Week One at the box office.

 Pro: Craftsmanship, Peter OTooles performance as Anton Ego

 Con: The premise is a bit silly

 Kaisay Kahein

 This attempt at a mature young love story has received a lukewarm response in its opening week, with the audience choosing to stay away from the Smita Thackeray film.

 Pro: A script with potential

 Con: Disappointing performances; lacklustre direction; average music

 Ballygunge Court

 Even with a good cast, this film dealing with the parent-child equation in the context of career and mobility, fails to strike a chord.

 Pro: Refreshing foreign locale

 Con: Gloomy and depressing narrative; cliched handling and performances

 Chak De! India

 SRK and his gang of hockey girls continue to create box office magic in Week 3.

 Pro: Shah Rukh Khan hasnt looked and acted better; the refreshingly real supporting cast; gender and region sensitive

 Con: Dhoondte reh jaoge!

 Partner

 The Salman-Govinda partnership is still going strong with the David Dhawan comic caper emerging as one of the biggest grossers of 07. And Salman fans now have another reason to catch it.

 Pro: The partnership; the one-liners

 Con: Loud in parts

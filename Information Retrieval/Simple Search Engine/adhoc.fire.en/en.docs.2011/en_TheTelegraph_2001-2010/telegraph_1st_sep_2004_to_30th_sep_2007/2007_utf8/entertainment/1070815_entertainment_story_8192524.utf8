 Beyond borders 

 IT MAKES SENSE FOR INDIAN DESIGNERS TO DO WELL ABROAD. DELHI-BASED DESIGNER VINEET BAHL TELLS YOU WHY. PLUS, SOME STYLE PICKS FROM THE CITY

 Fashion shows have become quite a Page 3 pastime in our cities. Local socialites are generously spread over newspaper supplements posing with their it bag or it friend, sipping vintage or vinegar, not being able to tell the difference. 

 In smaller towns, theyve actually become a venue, of sorts, for family outings, second only to multiplexes or a tambola evening. To the last-minute rescue comes a local fashion institute sending out its brave army of students marching to Himesh Reshammiya or Michael Jackson.

 While one can undoubtedly see the funnier side to these events with the social spectacle they make of themselves, we fail to notice the awareness that they create amongst the daily-reading public. Awareness turns to acceptance and this foreign concept of designer with fancy words like pret-a-porter or haute couture become part of the verbal exchange between aunties discussing wardrobe makeovers, and catapulting the designer to quasi-celebrity status.

 But what about the clothes, you may ask. Is anyone designing them at all? Well, sadly in most cases, the clothes become a tool to achieve the secret fantasies of the designer social or sexual. Market economics and seasonal studies do not exist in their radius, only moods and feelings. Hence, you have many flash-in-the-pan designers displaying promise with their first show, but disappearing into oblivion soon after. Sustainability is the key, and frankly very few have it.

 But thankfully the scenario is changing. Lakme and IMG have given us India Fashion Week, the first fashion event of its kind in our subcontinent. Designers are judged not on their clout, but on their marketability and sustainability. Buyers are registering themselves across India and abroad to attend the event. And the buzz you hear at the venue is not loose talk but actual, constructive business dealings.

 Internationally, India has been the flavour of the fashion circuit for a while now. Every possible fashion brand LVMH , Dior, YSL has flaunted its India connection in one collection or the other. Whether it was a collection inspired by the landscape of India, or colours of Rajasthan, or our gods, the workmanship has been visible on the international ramp for a while. To the extent that an India-inspired collection is digested with the same ease as Valentinos range of red evening ball gowns!

 Hence it was only natural in the line of progression for Indian designers to take up the mantle and take the story forward. We may be global citizens but it is OUR legacy after all.

 International ramps in the last decade have seen many designers from our shores showcase their collections at prestigious venues.

 Of late, GeNext designers are getting invited to present their story on the ramp. Its interesting to note the variations and technique that the designers of my generation are unfolding in the international arena.

 The cut, the silhouette, the international styling, the unmistakable twist of merging the east with the west has been received well. Its not surprising anymore to see young designers retailing from high-end stores in European and American markets.

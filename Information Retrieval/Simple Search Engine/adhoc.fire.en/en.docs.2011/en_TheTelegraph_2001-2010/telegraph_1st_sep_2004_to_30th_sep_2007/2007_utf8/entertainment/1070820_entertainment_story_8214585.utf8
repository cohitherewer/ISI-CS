 Finger on the pulse

 Sunaina Gulla, Karan Singh, Muskaan Mehani, Shilpa Anand and Pankit Thaker in Dill Mill Gaye

Five years after Sanjeevani was launched, Cinevistaa Productions is now ready with a second series on medical practitioners and their lives. Dill Mill Gaye (starting Monday on STAR One, 8.30pm), looks like Sanjeevani revisited, with a new look and a fresh appeal. 

 Dill Mill Gaye is not a sequel or a part two to Sanjeevani, clarifies Siddharth Malhotra, the creative producer of Cinevistaa.The basic premise is the same but Dill Mill Gaye looks at the lives of five young interns in a hospital. Keeping in mind that the show is going to be aired on STAR One, which targets young people, we decided to have a more youthful approach with Dill Mill Gaye, adds Malhotra.

 But didnt Sanjeevani start off as a youth serial before gradually becoming a saas-bahu drama? It was the demand of the channel (STAR Plus) that forced Sanjeevani to change track. From an initial TRP of five, its TRP jumped to 13 when it started focussing on melodrama and relationships, reasons Malhotra.

 Everything about Dill Mill Gaye might be new, but there is one obvious link with Sanjeevani Mohnish Behl who played Dr Shashank Gupta in that essays the same role in this. Since the story is about five young interns on the threshold of becoming doctors, a mentor was needed and thus Mohnishs character was retained, explains Malhotra.

 Gurdeep Kohli, Arjun Punj and Mihir Mishra of Sanjeevani have been given a miss in favour of younger actors such as Muskaan Mehani, Karan Singh, Shilpa Anand, Sunaina Gulla and Pankit Thaker . 

 But those expecting Dill Mill Gaye to focus on medical procedures along the lines of Greys Anatomy will be disappointed. The show is more character-oriented than case-oriented. A case, as and when it comes along, will be given attention, but Dill Mill Gaye is essentially the story of the lives of these five young people, signs off Malhotra.

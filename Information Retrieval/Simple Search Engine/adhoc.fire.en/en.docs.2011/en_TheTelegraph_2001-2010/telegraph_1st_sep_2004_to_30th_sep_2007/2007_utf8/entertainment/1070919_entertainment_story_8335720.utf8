 When a wedding fair boasts a wedding planner that handled part of the decor for the Mittal reception in Calcutta, internationally-acclaimed designers like Sabyasachi Mukherjee and a jewellery house with Bollywood connections, you can expect it to be nothing short of a grand bash. Here is a peek into some of the 40-plus stalls that will be at your disposal at The Telegraph Weddings at Hyatt Regency, September 21-23

 Fashion fiesta

 There will be studios from designer biggies like Sabyasachi, Kiran Uttam Ghosh and Dev and Nil. Veteran designer Sharbari Datta will also display her creations. An array of sherwanis, angrakhas, achkans and shawls are part of her collection, in silks from all over the country.

 Designer Abhishek Dutta is looking at ethnic wear with a global twist. Saris come in many avatars pre-stitched, pre-pleated and even skirt-cum-saris. Lehngas come in traditional voluminous styles as well as in fishtail cuts. For the men there are sherwanis. The price tag reads Rs 25,000-plus.

 Chhuti and Raja will display Indian and Indo-western ensembles. Suits boast patchwork, frill and thread balls. The cuts are international. The colour palette is neither very bright nor too dull, says Chhuti. Tops have been teamed with sequinned tights. Prices start at Rs 2,000. Wedding is more than just D-day. The collection will take care of wardrobe requirements pre- and post-marriage, adds Chhuti.

 With not more than 15 saris, and a few sari borders, kurtis and stoles, exclusivity is the mantra for Revival from Mumbai, reveals creative director Rayomand Maneckshaw. Specialising in Persian gara work, the label offers flowers, foliage and paisleys in crepes, georgette and chiffon.

 Designer Radhika Singhi offers bridal saris and lehngas. Lots of muted colours, khadi, brocade, Benarasi and gold weaves have been used for the traditional and cocktail saris. The lehngas are heavily embroidered. The collection starts at Rs 7,000.

 Orly will unveil its Gharana range of wedding wear comprising an array of sherwanis, jodhpuris and churidar kurtas in brocades, jamewar, silk and handmade fabric.

 Suman Nathwani, lingerie and sleepwear designer and t2 columnist, will lay out her signature line in burnt-out fabric, georgette, reptile prints, silk satin and velvet satin.

 Shine amp; shimmer

 Nemichand Bamalwa amp; Sons will add dazzle with diamonds and kundan sets. From bangles to necklaces, baajubandhs to maangtikas, there is quite a variety. And men need not be disappointed. They can take a look at diamond-studded cufflinks, tie-clips, belt buckles, watches and rings. The price tag reads Rs 50,000-plus. 

 Krunal Gems amp; Jewellery will woo customers with schemes like free diamond and gold jewellery on purchase of any gemstone.

 Jaipur-based Golechas Jewels, Senco Gold and Sangini will also be present.

 This and that

 At the Kaya Skin Clinic stall, skin experts will guide clients about the services on offer. For visitors walking in there will be complimentary Skinscription, Kaya Hairfree Underarms and laser testing.

 If you feel there is more to a wedding than looking great, stop by the Ragini Art stall. A piece of art can be very much a part of the trousseau. It is a lifetime treasure, says Nidhi Jain of the Delhi-based art and sculpture label.

 Wedding planners Wedding Xtra Ordinaire will not only bring to you LCD shows on sangeets and weddings, there will be choreographers providing tips to jazz up your sangeet. Mehndi, sari draping and nail-art sessions will add to the fun element.

 Display drama

 Exhibitors have put almost as much effort into their display spaces as what is in them! 

 The package as a whole counts. When you are one among many stalls, visual merchandising is important enough to attract customers, says designer Abhishek Dutta, whose 6-sq-m wedding pandal style stall offers an Indian wedding theme. My stall reflects my inspirations, the mood of my collection.

 Orly too is decorating its stall in the theme of a marriage mandap.

 With a huge mirror, a mannequin showcasing honeymoon wear and a cosy and personal ambience, Suman is looking at creating a walk-in wardrobe.

 Designers Chhuti and Raja will go the nature and rural way with fishnets and fish incorporated on lampshades and Santiniketan owls. The idea is to make the customer feel at home, says Chhuti.

 Nemichand Bamalwa amp; Sons will sprawl across five studios. The idea is to showcase a lot of variety, explains partner Bachhraj Bamalwa. The jewellery stable will stick to its white colour code that has been a hit over the years.

 Vinod Bhandari of Wedding Xtra Ordinaire will display themes and ideas over three studios. With wedding budgets crossing the crore mark, the promotion has to be worthwhile as well. We need to give them an idea of the theme possibilities they can ponder. The studio will offer a Rajwada theme of a Rajasthani palace. Special light effects, flowers from Holland and Bangkok, jharokhas and LCD panels will complete the look.

 Simplicity is the mantra for exhibitors like Delhi-based Ragini Art, and Revival from Mumbai. The highlights are the pictures and will make up for the decor themselves, says Nidhi Jain, from Ragini Art.

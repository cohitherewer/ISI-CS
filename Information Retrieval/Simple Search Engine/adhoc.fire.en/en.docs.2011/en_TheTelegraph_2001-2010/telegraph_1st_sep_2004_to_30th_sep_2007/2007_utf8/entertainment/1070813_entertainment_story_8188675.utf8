The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Festival fave

 Anjan Dass Jara Brishtite Bhijechhilo may not have worked wonders at the box office but it is travelling to a string of festivals in the country and abroad. 

 The film based on Joy Goswamis eponymous verse novel stars Indrani Halder, Joy Sengupta and Roopa Ganguly. Revolving around the coming of age of a poet, the film touches upon sexual exploitation and even lesbianism.

 After Osians Cinefan Festival last month, Jara Brishtite is now booked for Thrissur International Film Festival, beginning August 10. It will be screened in the competitive section of Almaty Festival of Kazakhstan in September. In October, the film will go to Lahore Film Festival and Palm Spring Festival USA. It will also be shown at the Bangladesh Film Festival next year.

 The response at Osians was great. We had full house. Roopa, Indrani and Joy were present. The jury wanted to screen it in the competitive section but I wasnt too keen as it would have been difficult to get an entry into the foreign film festivals. Im hopeful that it will be appreciated at the festivals, says Das.

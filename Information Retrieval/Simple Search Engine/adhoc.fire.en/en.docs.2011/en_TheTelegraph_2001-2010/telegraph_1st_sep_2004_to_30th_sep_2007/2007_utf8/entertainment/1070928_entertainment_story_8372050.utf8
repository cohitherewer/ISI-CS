The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Box Office

 Manorama Six Feet Under

 Despite good reviews, this attempt at a noir thriller has not managed to pull in the crowds in its opening week. 

 Pro: Intriguing plot and taut screenplay; great performances; cinematography

 Con: For those not into it, its too slow

 Dhol

 The occupancy ratings in Week One have been far from encouraging for this mindless comedy, generated from the Priyadarshan assembly line. 

 Pro: Some hilarious moments

 Con: Unoriginal plot; a weak musical score; unnecessary buffoonery 

 Loins of Punjab Presents

 Sharing the same box office fate as the other releases this week, Loins of Punjab Presents, good reviews notwithstanding, has been playing to near empty halls in most city theatres.

 Pro: The unconventional premise; the performances; the dialogues

 Con: Lack of stars 

 The Bourne Ultimatum

 The final instalment of the thriller series has not found many takers in Week One.

 Pro: Matt Damon as Jason Bourne; riveting screenplay; sparkling dialogues; the action sequences

 Con: Nothing really (except that its a Hollywood film something that the Calcutta audiences stay clear of)

 No Reservations

 This Catherine Zeta Jones-Aaron Eckhart romcom has got a thumbs down from the audience in its first week.

 Pro: Great food on view

 Con: Cliched plot; lacklustre performances

 Dhamaal

 In its third week, Dhamaal continues to score big at the box office.

 Pro: Clean fun

 Con: No heroine

 Shes 

 all action

 - Chandreyee gets behind the camera

 From the floors

 Chandreyee explains 

 a shot to Sudipta. Picture by Aranya Sen 

 A dead serious look with not a 

 trace of make-up on her face. Thats actress Chandreyee 

 Ghosh, behind the camera for her debut feature film on same-sex 

 relationships, Samothe equals. And latching on to 

 every instruction are buddies Sudipta, Ananya, Sohini, Swaralipi 

 and Kaushik.

 The 

 place: The 11th floor of an apartment building 

 on Ballygunge Circular Road.

 The 

 time: Monday noon.

 The 

 players: While Chandreyee (wo)mans the camera, 

 her cast is having a blast on the sets. They chat, crack 

 jokes, play pranks and enjoy every moment. But the moment 

 Chandreyee yells action, everyone gets into 

 work mode. Sudipta plays college-goer Noyon, in love with 

 Mati (Mallika Majumdar). Its a bit unusual and 

 unexplored for me as an actor. But its fun, 

 giggles Sudipta.

 Directors 

 cut: Its a huge responsibility 

 to be behind the camera, managing the cast and crew, keeping 

 every detail in mind and planning a scene in advance. Its 

 quite an experience, smiles Chandreyee, hair tied 

 back in a no-nonsense ponytail, ready to shoot for a fortnight.

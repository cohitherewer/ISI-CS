 Dream jeans

Look down. What are you wearing? Why, jeans of course. And even if you arent, at least one person around you is sure to be sporting a pair. Jeans, they say, are the next best thing after sliced bread. And why not?

 nDenims are our best friends. They go with anything, everything and nothing. If you are brand conscious, then dont look beyond your nearest shopping mall. If unbranded works fine, then some scouting is in store. Dont buy without a trial, however good a pair looks. Tailor-make a pair only if your tailor is tried and tested.

 nEven if you own five pairs of jeans, there will always be that one favourite. It doesnt matter if its faded and dirty and torn in places. So try not to buy more than one pair at a time. But if you find a pair that gives you the made-for-each-other feel, then be brave and buy in multiples.

 nThe first thing a girl is likely to do when trying on a pair of jeans is turn around and check out how it hugs the derriere. A boy would care more about where it falls on the waist.

 nThe essence of any pair of denims lies in its fit. Watch out for creases in the crotch region or a bunched waistline just above the butt when you sit down. Check the zips and buttons too original brands usually have their name embedded.

 nThe hem of your jeans often ends up under the soles of the shoes. If you wear heels, remember to tell the salesperson to keep it two inches longer than where your bare foot touches the ground. If flats are more your style, keep the length short.

 nThe tapered look is back again. So get in shape, and fast.

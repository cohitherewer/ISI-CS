 Fitness pro Mrinalini Mukherjee offers tips on how to make the most of a treadmill workout.

 A 10-minute treadmill run three times a week raises the good 

HDL cholesterol and helps in cardio conditioning

 I have recently bought a treadmill and am trying to work out on it three to four times a week. Can you suggest an exact routine to follow, including the speed, time, frequency and the right posture. Also, some dos and donts while on the treadmill. I am 5-ft-3 and weigh 62 kg.

 I am assuming that you are a beginner and new to a workout on the treadmill. This can give you an aerobic workout that is personalised for your needs. To start with, invest in a good pair of walking shoes. Always start slow and build your time and speed gradually. The key is to work at a pace that you can stick to. It is very important that you perform this activity correctly. 

 Ensure that as your foot comes forward and your heel strikes the ground, you raise your toes and roll forward on to the outside of your foot (but do keep the entire shoe sole on the ground). As your foot passes under your body, straighten your knee and press the ground with the ball of your foot, maintaining pressure till your toes leave the ground. 

 Remember to walk from your waist, allowing your hips to rotate naturally with the forward and backward movement of your legs. Meanwhile, your shoulders should stay relaxed and face forward. 

 Allow your arms to swing at your sides in the same forwardbackward direction as your hips and legs and, as you increase speed, bend your arms at a right angle and swing them faster in rhythm with your legs. 

 Do not lean forward while walking and practise walking hands-free from the start as balancing is a part of the exercise and the body becomes more efficient when challenged. Only hold on to monitor the heart rate. Hydrate yourself an hour before you start. 

 Always start by warming up for five to 10 minutes. Thereafter, gradually build up the routine till you are breathing hard and to a pace where you find it difficult to sing but can carry on a conversation. 

 Initially invest 10-15 minutes on a programme, walking at 34 mph, listen to your body and walk at a comfortable pace but allow your heart to beat at an increased rate. Then as you get conditioned, move on to walk for 30-45 minutes or even up to 60 minutes at 56 mph. By then you should be able to consider mileage and target heart rate (subtract your age from 220 to get your maximum heart rate (MHR).

 Your target zone can be between 50-90 per cent of your MHR to see the training effect. Always keep in mind that you need to modify your workout according to your fitness level.

 Perform this workout three times a week with a days rest in-between to begin with. Be sure to progress each week by adding time and/or increasing intensity. 

 Interval treadmill exercise plan: You need to change your speed here, like run at a sprinting pace for one minute and then reduce to a moderate jogging pace for two minutes to cool down. For a different effect, try reducing to a slow jog or walking pace. Look at adjusting the intensity of these intervals. 

 Sustained speed exercise: Whilst the interval method can burn more calories, incorporating sustained speed in your treadmill exercise plan will help develop stamina and endurance. 

 Brisk exercise: A 10-minute treadmill run three times a week markedly raises the good HDL cholesterol and helps in cardio conditioning. 

 Always end with a cool-off segment coupled with some stretches.

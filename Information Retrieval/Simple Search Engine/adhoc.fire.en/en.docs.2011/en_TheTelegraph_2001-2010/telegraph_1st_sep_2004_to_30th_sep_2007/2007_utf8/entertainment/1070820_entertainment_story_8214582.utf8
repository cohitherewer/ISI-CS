The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 She spreads her wings 

 Jennifer Winget

 With a name like hers, who would associate Jennifer Winget with saas-bahu melodrama? But thats precisely what has made her a household name. With Kkusum, Kya Hoga Nimmo Ka and Kasautii Zindagii Kay in her CV, Jennifer is now ready to play the innocent Ganga in the Fox production Sangam (starting Monday, STAR Plus, 7pm) . A chat

 On Sangam being her first non-Balaji Telefilms project:

 I started my acting career with the comedy show Shakalaka Boom Boom, but it is Balaji Telefilms that has made me a popular face on Indian television. I have had well-defined roles in all my Balaji Telefilms productions Kkusum, Kya Hoga Nimmo Ka and Kasautii which I am still a part of. Sangam came to me at a time when I was looking to do something different. When I was told about my role and the set-up, I decided that Sangam would be the right serial to take up at this point in my career.

 On her role in Sangam:

 I play Ganga, a sweet, innocent village girl who is very close to her father (played by Shishir Sharma). Her only aim in life is to fulfil her fathers hopes and dreams and that is what she sets out to do. A lot of setbacks happen along the way, but each time she emerges a stronger and more resolute individual.

 On what makes Sangam different: Sangam is not a family melodrama. It is a simple tale well told. Besides, Sangam is partly set in a village, something that one would not find in regular soaps today.

 On what makes Fox Productions different from Balaji Telefilms: They are both professional production houses. Fox is definitely a very big name, but apart from the fact that I am working with a lot of new people, there is no major difference between Fox and Balaji. Besides, my Sangam co-star Chaitanya Chaudhury is also a Balaji find and I have known him for a very long time.

 On how she manages to juggle two daily soaps:

 I am definitely overworked most of the time (laughs). But then there are some days when I manage to go home early. Its all part and parcel of the profession I am in and I wouldnt like to have it any other way.

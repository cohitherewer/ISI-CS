The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Southern comfort

 South India has much more than traditional exotica to offer to travellers

 Down South is the direction to head. On the heels of the three-day Travel and Tourism Fair (TTF) at Netaji Indoor Stadium that ended on August 20, the Kerala and Andhra Pradesh roadshows followed for a comprehensive showcase of what each state has to offer. 

 ldquo;Kerala and Bengal have always been called lsquo;intellectual cousins rsquo; mdash; we have a lot more in common than just fish, rdquo; said Venu V, secretary, Kerala Tourism. Seven-time winner of the Best Tourism Award from the government of India, Kerala Tourism (KT) has grown by 105 per cent in the past five years. The land of Ayurveda, houseboats and backwaters is now tempting tourists for new experiences like monsoon tourism, adventure and even village tourism.

 ldquo;There are more than 500 homes offered for hospitality. Kerala sees Bengal as one of its best markets. There is an impression that Kerala is very pricey but we would like to dispel that too. Around 20-25,000 people from Bengal come to God rsquo;s own country on leisure trips, rdquo; revealed Venu. For more information, visit www.keralatourism.org.

 The next treasure house is Andhra Pradesh. ldquo;Hyderabad, soon to be the medical capital of India, will get its first private international airport in March 2008. This will cut down on travel time, rdquo; said K.V. Reddy, director, department of tourism, government of Andhra Pradesh. On the cards is also the Southern Splendour Express train that will cover a number of popular southern tourist spots, spread over roughly 550 km and four states.

 From excursions to nearby Warangal, Medak and Alampur famous for temples of exquisite Kakatiya architecture, beach paradise Vizag, religious site Tirupati and trekking haven Nagarjunasagar, a trip to Andhra Pradesh can only mean pleasure and relaxation. The AP tourism department is also keen on showcasing its Buddhist attractions. ldquo;AP has more than 150 Buddhist archaeological sites. We are also developing a Buddhist theme park across 270 acres of land with a 100-ft wide and 80-ft high stupa, rdquo; said Reddy at the AP Road Show on August 21.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Curtain call

Rohit Bal 

 A fashion finale has never been more fitting. Rohit Bal rocked the ramp and how. An avant-garde collection inspired by Iznik tiles of Turkey in ink blue and ivory, an evening dedicated to late Rohit Khosla and the designer brigade catwalking his finale collection, this is the stuff grand fashion moments are made of. Rohit Bals line had larger-than-life features, volume being the key word. Totally unwearable, the designer has admitted, it is a collection he designed just for fun. Well, fun it was! 

 Falguni amp; Shane Peacock

 Animal prints met historic wallpaper designs for Falguni and Shanes spring-summer statement. Yellows, pinks, oranges, peacock blue The ramp was a rainbow. The fabric story revolved around lustrous chiffons, satins and linen. Silver embroidery, sequins, crystals, stones and Amrita Arora contributed to the bling quotient. Balloon silhouettes, flowing trails, empire-lines... Did someone say Roberto Cavalli? 

 Varun Bahl

 Day 4 also saw Varun Bahl presenting his designs for associate sponsor Essenza di Wills. Bollywood star Celina Jaitely did the catwalk honours for him as happy spring colours like apple green, lilac, lime green, mint, coral, fuchsia and mauve flooded the ramp. Linen with a metallic effect, mesh, muslin and crepe moulded themselves into shift dresses, shorts, voluminous bermudas and blouses. Overlying gold and silver, 3-D flower and leaf motif embroideries added an exciting texture to the ensembles. 

 Raghavendra Rathore

 The penultimate day of WIFW saw Raghavendra Rathores ready-to-wear collection take the ramp. Taking his last seasons story forward, this time too his silhouettes were mostly Indo-western. An odd print here, and a little applique there, his colours were quiet yet strong mauve, sand, gold and wine. Tunics, kurtas, straight pants and capris for the ladies and his signature jackets in grey and charcoal were the main silhouettes.

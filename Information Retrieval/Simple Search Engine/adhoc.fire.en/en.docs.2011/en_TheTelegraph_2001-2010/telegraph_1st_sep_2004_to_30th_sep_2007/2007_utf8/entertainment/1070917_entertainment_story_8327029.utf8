 Style stop

 A glimpse of Seema Bhasin rsquo;s studio. Picture by Pabitra Das 

Seema Bhasin has been around in Calcuttas design scene since 1989. Retailing from home, supplying to Taj Khazana, Kali, Espee and Ogaan kept Seema busy till she moved out of the city. Then, with kids and a home to manage, she had to slow down. Back in town, Seema began by retailing from Tollygunge Club. That was for four years, till her flagship store was born in 2003 at 22 Unnayan, The Commercial Centre, 1050/1 Survey Park.

 I started out when I was a college-goer with limited pocket money to spend. It was difficult to find designer stuff at affordable rates. So I took matters into my own hands. I was looking at something everyone could afford. Seema also created costumes for Usha Gangulis Himmat Mai. For Habib Tanvirs Visarjan last year, she designed the costumes with Zarine Chaudhuri .

 The look

 Spread over 337 sq ft, the studio is neat and simple. The mosaic flooring is in sync with cream walls and sandstone panelling. The use of glass creates a spacious illusion. Soft lighting makes for a warm and informal ambience.

 The collection

 I love doing pret. When it comes to size, I stack up on extra large, explains Seema, clearly not interested in a models-only kind of clientele. Georgette, chiffon and muls are popular fabrics. Winters will be all about silks, brocades and cotton jamewar. Black-white, ivory, sand, English rose pink are perennial favourites along with bright splashes of greens, reds and blues. Matte gold and copper embroidery, gota, sequins, buttons and crochet have been used as embellishments.

 On offer are salwar suits, materials, tunics, skirts, shirts, kantha dupattas and cotton and printed georgette scarves. Pakistani salwars with lace and patches and lace leggings are fast flying off the racks.

 Salwar suits with detailing on the neck and arms and tops with simple necklines are suitable for everyday wear. Tunics boast a lot of prints, highlighted with embellishments. Skirts with varying hemlines are pretty picks too.

 Salwars cost Rs 750-plus, while tunics and kurtas are Rs 400-plus.

 t2 pick: A georgette salwar in black with honeycomb-like patterns created with sequins comes for Rs 2,500.

 Body odour turns 

me off 

 URVASHI SHARMA gets candid about her pursuits and her passions.

 Date of birth: October 13, 19** (smiles)

 Birthplace: Delhi

 One quality that defines me: I am genuine

 Pet name: Maina

 My first crush: My work

 The best compliment that I have ever received: Lagta nahin yeh aapki first movie hai said a random lady at Metro theatre in Mumbai, after watching Naqaab

 What turns me on in a man: Intelligence, good sense of humour, a good physique and, of course, loads of money. He should be able to afford me (smiles)

 What turns me off in a man: Body odour

 I am possessive about: My family. Actually, more than being possessive Im very caring

 The craziest thing that I have done: When I was learning how to drive, I felt confident after just two days. On the third day, I took off for a drive without telling anybody. Every time I would leave the clutch after the first gear the car would stall! My dad got really scared when he found out

 I lie: Only about things that do not matter to me

 My greatest fear: Loneliness and the dark

 My favourite perfume: Whatever I find on my dressing table

 After putting in a hard days work I unwind by: Going home and relaxing. I meet my family and I am relaxed

 The part of me I would like to change: Nothing. I want to groom myself further, but not really change anything

 The historical character I identify with: I think I mustve been some warrior in my last life, because I fight a lot (smiles)

 The child in me: Is always out (smiles)

 If I were to throw a coin in a wishing well, I would wish for: My familys happiness and that I should always be with them

 I got my first pocket money: Never really got it. My mom used to give me 50 paise or one rupee to spend (smiles). My first pay was when I did an ad for McDonalds for which I got Rs 3,500 and I was really happy

 I love gorging on: Everything! I can eat anything but I swim and burn it off because considering the amount I eat, I have to do something

 One person I would love to interview: Myself. I will look for something new in me

 If I wake up one morning and find myself on a different planet, I would do: Nothing, Ill start staying there. Bhagwan ne jo diya theek hai

 My most cherished possession: My family again, I dont have anything else till now (smiles)

 My most expensive purchase: I dont like spending (smiles). I get gifts... Mujhe kya zaroorat hai khareedne ki?

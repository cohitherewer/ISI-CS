 The beckham syndrome

 The English Institute of Sport has warned that David Beckhams travel schedule is taking its toll. Ken Van Someren, responsible for the health of Britains prized athletes, expressed concern about Beckhams frequent flying, which he said could have two-fold consequences of reduced performance and an increased risk of injury.... And we thought flying was fun! Travelling might be exciting for the holidayer, but it ceases to hold that pleasure for very frequent flyers 

 Karan Paul: Flight pro

 Shonal Rawat: Power napper

 Bhaichung Bhutia: Lag loss

It is far more serious than just jetlag. Our home-grown frequent fliers will tell you how repeated long-haul flights can acquire a completely different meaning as they rocket through multiple destinations in a matter of days due to hours spent in air, delays, and the greatest evil time zone shifts. The result? Bleary-eyed travellers ready to crash even before they hit the appointed meeting or show.

 Industrialists, designers, musicians, athletes, and executives attest that living out of a suitcase can play tricks on the body and the mind.

 The most commonly-known hazard is DVT or deep vein thrombosis, also referred to as economy class syndrome, but which can strike passengers in any section of an aircraft. Disorientation from waking up in different cities every alternate day can also lead to psychological changes and prolonged depression. Long-flight fatigue and jetlag can also bring about a dip in performance levels.

 Bhaichung Bhutia feels Beckhams pain (rather a small part of it). The footballer who finds it difficult to catch those early morning flights, finds himself on many six-hour flights to West Asia for matches. I cant get sleep either on or off flight. The body becomes stiff and it has affected my performance many a time. Three years back, we were on a 10-hour flight to Turkmenistan and had to step on to the field right after. We were tired and lost the match, rues Bhaichung.

 The strains and sprains can take time to surface. Tabla exponent Tanmoy Bose, who has been making four round trips a year to Europe and the US ever since he started performing with Ravi Shankar 10 years ago, has not had it easy. Just the thought of travelling exhausts me even before Ive started out. Ive developed uric acid problems and eating disorders. I also suffer from acute dehydration that has led to pressure problems and all of these have cropped up in the past one year, complains Bose.

 Designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee is forever travelling and has already paid the price for it. The designer landed on a risky route with an ear drum problem, affecting his sense of balance and hearing.

 Calcutta-bred model Shonal Rawat now living in Mumbai will tell you how incessant domestic flights too can take a toll. I need to catch an early morning flight at least once a week. International flights happen once in two months and can be quite maddening. I try to reach two days prior to the show to rid myself of jetlag but cant do much on a domestic trip when we have to get down to rehearsals and trials as soon we reach and return on an early morning flight the very next day, says a weary Shonal. She strongly recommends power naps, even if they last only five minutes.

 But there is hardly a choice in the matter. Its a job hazard one has to undertake, they all agree. So they find their own ways to beat the stress and ease the impact.

 Tanmoy Bose sticks to seafood meals, which go easy on the stomach. I never drink alcohol during a flight to avoid dehydration and take a walk down the aisle to prevent my feet from swelling, says Bose, who nearly collapsed after a flight from Singapore to Los Angeles a year ago.

 Shoots and award functions travel from Dubai to New York to Malaysia and so does fashion designer Manish Malhotra. Drinking lots of water is my only trick. I keep sipping to keep myself going. Yes, there are days when the travel stress is unbearable but then again, what can be done?

 Industrialist Karan Paul takes a minimum of 150 flights a year, and uses all his flying time to catch up on sleep and read. Though Paul does try to make flying more comfortable by choosing his aircrafts, seats and timings personally, the jetlag still hits. So, he works from home the day he is scheduled to travel and the day he returns. Travel fatigue is fought out at the gym, in the swimming pool and sometimes in the spa. And he also has a time-tested tip: If Im doing London-Calcutta-London very often, I begin work an hour earlier in the UK and an hour later when in India.

 First and business class on international flights offer gourmet meals, a choice of music and chairs that recline into a horizontal position, which is a far cry from the conditions in cattle class. So economy travellers try to get themselves front-row seats for greater leg space, take strolls down the aisle and do some isometric exercises as advised by the airlines.

 Once on the ground, some pamper time can help. The best way to refresh for a meeting is checking into a spa for a foot soak or a back and head rub to get the circulation going, advises fitness consultant Preetom Mukherjee Roy. Just an hour spent at the spa followed by a quick cardio-workout can help detox and give you renewed energy.

 Fitness expert Mrinalini Mukherjee offers some quick tips on how to relax anxious muscles that aid in better circulation on flight:

 Stretch your neck. Turn your head to the side and point your chin toward your shoulder. Keep head lowered and move it towards your other shoulder in a rolling motion.

 Stretch your shoulders. Gently roll your shoulders forward, up, back and down. Repeat in the reverse direction. 

 Open and clench your hands, spread your fingers. 

 Relax your calf muscles. Press your hands against the seat and raise one leg with your knee bent. Tense your thigh muscles. Relax. Change legs.

 Stretch your legs. Place both feet on the floor and lean forward slowly, keeping your back straight. Allow your hands to glide along your shin toward your ankle. Hold this position for 15 seconds. Then lean back.

 Stretch and rotate your feet. Lift one foot off the floor. Rotate 10 times clockwise, then 10 times anti-clockwise. Relax. Repeat with the other foot.

 Relax your buttocks. Tense the muscles for five seconds. Relax.

 But if none of this works, our jetsetters could perhaps try going the Dennis Bergkamp way. This Dutch star striker developed an aversion for flying and chose a way out of the skies by ditching the plane for the road and sea. So Bergkamp would drive to Spain or set out on sea for Arsenals Champions League match at Real Madrid but the only time youd see him air-borne was while heading a cross into the back of the net!

 Why David Beckham rsquo;s move to LA Galaxy will do him no good... 

 The Body

 At the age of 32, Becks is no spring chicken, and a body that has already had its problems in the past is getting a much greater beating than it has ever gotten before under his new LA routine. Be it catching up with family and friends, or playing for England, lots of to-ing and fro-ing will be inevitable.

 Becks now has to travel greater distances than he ever has done before mdash; the distance between London and Los Angeles is 8,750 km, with the flight time never being less than 12 hours.

 The boy from London rsquo;s poor district of Leytonstone is already showing signs of the strain. On August 29 Becks sustained a serious knee injury when playing against Pachuca in the American Superliga. It was later revealed that he would be out for about six weeks, missing not only a whole host of LA Galaxy matches, but also a few crucial England ties.

 The Mind

 The American soccer league is simply not that great in terms of quality, and a player of Beckham rsquo;s calibre (even in the twilight of his career) should not be messing around in a league as irrelevant as this. 

 Beckham and his fans have made much of his arrival in America being a signal that the American league is now a major player in world soccer. But we suspect that his shift had more to do with the astronomical pay packet that LA Galaxy dangled under his mdash; and queen Victoria rsquo;s mdash; nose. The American league as centre of soccer? Huh, the Federation Cup in Calcutta stands a better chance.

 The upside of the move for us is that no matter how popular he may become in the United States, he will always remain relatively anonymous as a soccer player in America. This may lead to games being played in the minds of Mrs and Mr Beckham, but it will sure spare us the trouble of reading about them every time they sneeze or stutter.

 The Obsession

 Arnold Schwarznegger and half of Hollywood rsquo;s big names may have turned up for his first match for Galaxy against Chelsea, and hordes of fans may have been waiting to greet him at the airport, but America is obsessed with Beckham for all the wrong reasons. In truth, they don rsquo;t care whether Beckham can bend it like, well, Beckham. Los Angeles is out to greet a great brand that adds to the prestige of the place. One can rsquo;t help but feel that this is not a new beginning, but the beginning of the end for David Robert Joseph Beckham.

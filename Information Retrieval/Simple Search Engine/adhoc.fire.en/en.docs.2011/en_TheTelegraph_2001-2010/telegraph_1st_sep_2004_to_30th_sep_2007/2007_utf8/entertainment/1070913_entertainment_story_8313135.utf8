The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 The root of the matter

 Picture by Bishwarup Dutta

 Zubeen Garg, the singing sensation from Assam with hits like Ya ali, Ek din and Jhoom barabar jhoom, was in town recently to launch his new Indipop album Zindagi. With over 7,000 songs performed in a variety of languages to his credit, Garg is a versatile performer. Not surprisingly, his own music draws from a broad palette folk, melodic rock and Sufi music. 

 Hes come a long way since his 1992 debut album Anamika. True to his image as an entertainer, Garg, in bright pink shirt and shades, was at his swinging best at Aquatica on Sunday, belting out chartbusters from Kaante, Pyaar Ke Side/Effects and Gangster. Off the album, he performed Jia re, jia re and Zindagi kahin gum hai. Heres what he had to say to t2: 

 Fill us in on Zindagi...

 This is my second album, which tries to incorporate various musical styles from Western club and pop to Sufi strains and Assamese folk music. All the songs have poetic and catchy lyrics. It is different from the regular Bollywood fare. The album also features Shafqat Amanat Ali and Chitra. The music was composed by Dudul. 

 Whats on the Bollywood anvil? 

 Im singing for two films by Nagesh Kukunoor called Aashayein and Bombay to Bangkok. Theres also Victoria No. 203 and Manorama Six Feet Under. Apart from these, Im also working on my debut directorial venture in Bollywood called Chakra. I have written the script and will act in the film as well.

 What about the Bengali film industry?

 I have worked as a music director for the Bengali film Shudhu Tumi, which wove Bangla and Northeastern folk elements and was very well received. I have scored for a few TV serials and have just finished another film called Maharathi. Theres also an album of the Bangla translations of my Assamese songs called Tumi due for a pre-Puja release. 

 Who is your musical inspiration?

 My mother was my first inspiration as I trained under her. My friends were also really significant in developing my talent as we used to all sit and jam together. Folk music has always been a big influence on my life and music. People who I consider my idols are Sting, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, A.R. Rahman, Ilaiyaraja, and, of course, Kishore Kumar.

 What is singing in so many different languages like?

 I have sung in Tamil, Kannada and most of the tribal languages of the Northeast. I enjoy it all, as I try to understand the inflections of every tongue and bring its vitality and meaning to my music. 

 And your future plans?

 I would really like to move into music direction from playback singing. After a while, Bollywood tends to get static and I want to retain the vitality in my music and would like to work extensively with folk music and perhaps even come out with an album of English songs. I am quite open to cinema and would like to both act and direct offbeat films. I will keep singing songs in Assamese. I can never leave my roots behind.

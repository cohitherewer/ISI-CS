 Mumbai on the Boyle

 The man who directed Ewan McGregor in Trainspotting, Leonardo DiCaprio in The Beach and Cameron Diaz in A Life Less Ordinary may now direct Shah Rukh Khan.

 Danny Boyle, the British film-maker who has done groundbreaking sci-fi cinema with films like 28 Days Later and Sunshine, is now adapting Vikas Swarups bestseller Q amp; A, which won the Paris Book Fairs Readers Prize in March this year.

 Boyles film version, titled Slumdog Millionaire, is about an 18-year-old slum resident who has to win Kaun Banega Crorepati in order to get in touch with the girl he loves. He has no clue how to contact her all he knows is that she is a big fan of the quiz show and if he wins, she will surely watch him on TV and get in touch with him. The script is being written by Simon Beaufoy, who had earlier penned the charming The Full Monty.

 For his pre-production work, Boyle has been making frequent trips to Mumbai. According to sources, who are helping him out in India, Boyle plans to shoot in Dharavi, Asias largest slum area. He plans to use only Indian actors and all of them new ones at that, says our source. He and his team of assistant directors has been auditioning a lot of theatre actors and carrying videotapes with them back home.

 But there has to be one major known face in the cast. With a major part of the film being actually the quiz show, Boyle needs someone to play the host of his Kaun Banega Crorepati.

And of the two real-time contenders Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan the one person Boyle has met in Mumbai is SRK. While Shah Rukh didnt mention Slumdog Millionaire among his forthcoming films when he spoke to t2, he is believed to be keen on Boyles film. 

 If Shah Rukh does go on to do it, this will be the second movie where he plays himself. The only other time he was himself was in Samar Khans Kuch Meetha Ho Jaye. When t2 quizzed SRK about Season Two of his KBC, King Khan did confirm that he was still in the game. Yes that will be next year and hopefully, we will come in with a lot of changes.

 Coming back to Slumdog Millionaire, during his Sunshine promotion interviews, Boyle has said: ... the Hindi version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? isnt like the American or British version. Its actually incredibly difficult to win, because what you have in India is this incredibly highly populated educational strata who are very poor... they dont have much money, but they are professors... Im really looking forward to it! Its completely the opposite of Sunshine, cause Mumbai is kind of an ordeal of humanity, just humans coming at you endlessly day and night!

 P.S: The other famous foreign film-maker shooting his next film in India is Bosnian director Danis Tanovic, whose No Mans Land crushed Lagaans Oscar hopes. He will shoot his next film in and around Punjab but call it Pakistan!

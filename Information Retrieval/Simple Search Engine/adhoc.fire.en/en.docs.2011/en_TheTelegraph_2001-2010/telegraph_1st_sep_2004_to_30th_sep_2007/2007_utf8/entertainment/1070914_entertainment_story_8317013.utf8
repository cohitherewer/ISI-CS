The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Leading lady

 Her recent roles may not have added up to much (think MLA Fatakesto, Mahaguru...), but Debashree Roy is now busy at Bharat Lakshmi Studio shooting for Lal Ranger Duniya, where she plays the substantial part of a sensitive sex worker. t2 engaged the reticent actress in a chat, between shots.

 Whats special about your sex workers role in Lal Ranger Duniya?

 My character Dalia Karmakar is a compassionate human being who chooses to make a lot of sacrifices in her life. She also protects other girls who are trapped in flesh trade. When I read the script I found the character very interesting. Maybe I have done roles of sex workers before but they were not like Dalia. There is tremendous growth in her character; she is extremely emotional and very real. She even refuses to marry and settle down with her lover Tapan (Kunal Mitra).

 What kind of roles are you offered nowadays?

 All types of roles. I still play the leading lady in most of the films I do. My fans love to see me in commercial films. I cant sit and wait to get roles in art films. And I think I have maintained myself well enough to be cast as the heroine in commercial films. I practise dance and I am conscious about what I eat. That way, I keep fit. 

 Is there a dream role?

 I dont believe in dream roles. I am never satisfied. I have done more than 300 films and yet theres an urge to do more.

 Any plans to direct a film?

 That may be a possibility. I might venture into direction or start my own business. Now I am concentrating on my films. I have a lot to contribute to cinema. I love the industry and the people here. If I stay out of the city for too long, I feel claustrophobic.

 What other films are you busy with?

 I am doing Tiger with Mithun. I play his wife who becomes unstable after losing her only child. Then there is Goutam Sens Pakhi where I play a blind woman.

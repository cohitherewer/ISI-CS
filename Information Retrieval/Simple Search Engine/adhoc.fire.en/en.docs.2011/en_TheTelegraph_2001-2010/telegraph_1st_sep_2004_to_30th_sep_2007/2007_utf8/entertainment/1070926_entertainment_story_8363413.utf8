 The Award for the Strangest Rumour this month goes to the buzz that Aditya Chopra, son of Yash Chopra and head honcho of the Yash Raj banner, is going to break his vow never to make an appearance in front of the camera.

 An insider tells us that the younger Chopra has got over his famed camera shyness (he rarely attends awards functions either and was only seen entering Prateeksha for the AbAsh wedding in April) and is making a special appearance in pal Kunal Kohlis next, which stars Saif Ali Khan and Rani Mukerji. The film is currently being shot by Sudeep Chatterjee at the Yash Raj Studios.

 When we approached the Yash Raj spokesperson for her take, she laughed and claimed it was just a funny rumour.

Neil Mukesh, the grandson of legendary singer Mukesh and son of Nitin Mukesh, is making his acting debut with Johnny Gaddaar this Friday. Mukesh (JrJr) has a major fascination for cars. The youngster who earlier owned a Maruti Esteem, has just been gifted a brand new Honda Civic by his doting dad.

 Neil says: I love cars and I love driving down the Napean Sea Road stretch near my house. Its only when I am tired that I let the driver take the wheel. I dont even give my car for valet parking. When I drive down to a hotel, I ask the manager if I can park my car somewhere close by. I dont mind if I have to walk even if its raining.

 Neil also says his car is like a second home. The moment I step out of my house, Im in my car and travelling five hours a day. I am extremely attached to it. This Mukesh sure loves his mean machines.

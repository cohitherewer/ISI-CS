 Padmini comeback

 Just in

 Padmini Kolhapure is making yet another comeback with a film called Daughter. As the name suggests, the film is about a mother-daughter relationship. Padmini plays the mother of Richa, a debutante and the daughter of the producer of the film.

 Dr Medha, the producer of Daughter says: It is a sensitive story of an orphan girl who believes that her grandfather will one day come and take her home. She thwarts all efforts by strangers to adopt her.

 When asked why she cast her daughter in the film, the producer says: It was my director Viju Manes idea. Richa is currently in junior college and studying medicine. And the director thinks she has got the spark.

 Good for Padmini!

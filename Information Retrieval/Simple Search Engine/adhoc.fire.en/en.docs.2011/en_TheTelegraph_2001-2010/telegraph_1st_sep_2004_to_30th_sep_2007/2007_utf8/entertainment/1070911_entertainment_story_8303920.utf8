 Rita Bhimani discovers that tapping into our subconscious could be the way to true achievement

 NYSE trader Matthew Schojam takes his daily mediation break outside the NYSE building on Wall Street in New York

Every morning, when I am out for my whisk (brisk walk) and swim, I find people in the pool, at the edges of the walking path and even under trees by the roadside in all kinds of meditative postures. At an office where they were having a conference, the first couple of minutes was with lights low, heads bowed. Meditation, before all agendas are let loose. The enforced calm before the blame game storm, probably.

 People are individually and collectively trying to find ways to reach an inner self, to reflect and re-jig in tranquility. Can they achieve this on their own? Or are there people waiting to give a helping hand?

 Sure there are. While we have been exposed to a variety of corporate therapeutic modules, an encounter with Jimmy K. Mody, a clinical hypnotherapist and a psychotherapist, threw up some great new motivations for self-improvement. And for self-healing as well. People today are faced not just with work-related stress, but with a variety of physical ailments as well, and hypnotherapy apparently can achieve in a few sessions what it might take years through traditional mediation techniques.

 As Jimmy Mody very lucidly explains his methodology: A fusion of physchoanalysis, group dynamics, hypnotherapy and spirituality to understand the true potential of every human being and to help people realise that they can live and work at a much higher level than they are.

 He feels that the tragedy we are all perpetuating is that we use only 10 per cent of our mind. So that every decision we make is a mere 10 per cent of what should actually be put into gear. He actually looks at the 90 per cent of the mind that is not conscious which is 6,000 times more powerful than the conscious. The subconscious terrain has to be used in our daily living, he maintains. 

 In seeking to integrate the spiritual by exploring ones true potential with the materialistic, Mody seeks to go from the growth of the individual self to the more macro issues of group self and corporate self. Leading us to the ultimate perception, and the ability to look ahead and beyond. 

 On a more down-to-earth note, hypnotherapy does help to boost self-confidence, enhances levels of enthusiasm and helps improve time management and relationship management skills. 

 Mody further expands on what motivates him to practise this kind of individual and corporate healing-teaching-leading. We hear incredible stories about the Big Achievers. What was it that motivated them? If you say that was HIM and this is ME, then you block yourself out of that whole achievement picture. And so, trainers like him (Mody is a certified teacher of the California Hypnosis Institute) take on the mission of helping and guiding people to reach their full abilities. 

 Incidentally, dont confuse hypnotism with mesmerism, or with any trance-creating rituals. Hypnotherapy, with its healing, teaching and leading techniques and its vestiges of spirituality, could be the scientific way to overcome physical and emotional anxieties, and come out on top, with a new intuitive and positive approach to life and work.

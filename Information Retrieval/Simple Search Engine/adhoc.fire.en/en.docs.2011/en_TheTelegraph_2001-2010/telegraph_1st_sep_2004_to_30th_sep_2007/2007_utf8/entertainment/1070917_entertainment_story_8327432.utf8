 Generation gap

 If Shakespeares King Lear remains a classic example of generations in conflict, many heroes and heroines of today tragic and otherwise are engaged in enduring battles with their own flesh and blood. t2 turns the spotlight on some infamous cases of family friction which keep hitting the headlines...

Ozzy Osbourne Vs Jack Osbourne

 Jack Osbourne, son of rock legend Ozzy, also known as the Prince of Darkness, recently blamed his father for being a bad influence leading to his addiction to alcohol and drugs. Jack claimed that his problems peaked when his mother Sharon was diagnosed with colon cancer and undergoing treatment. That was when he resorted to alcohol and a painkiller for thats what he saw his dad doing. With no one to turn to, he admitted to just hanging out with friends drinking and doing drugs till he ended up in rehab.

Arun Nayar Vs Vinod Nayar

 It was more than just a squabble between father and son after Vinod Nayar wrote a letter to his son Arun and daughter-in-law Elizabeth Hurley and ceremonially disowned them, unable to bear the hurt of being ignored and humiliated at their extravagant wedding. A crest-fallen Vinod came out with a long list of complaints starting with Liz Hurley refusing to wear the diamond and ruby necklace worth 35,000 offered to her as a wedding gift, followed by Liz refusing to be welcomed into the family according to Indian customs. His 87-year-old mother not being invited to the wedding and lack of attention to family members agonised Vinod further. Liz retorted that she would have nothing more to do with Vinod and his wife. Liz and Arun even offered to pay for all the expenses that Vinod had made for the wedding. Baap re baap!

 Angelina Jolie Vs John Voight

 Angelina Jolie and her Oscar-winner father have been estranged for many years, but trouble peaked in 2002 when John accused his wild-child daughter of suffering from serious mental problems. Thats when Angelina shed her last name Voight. John is reported to have been trying hard to reach out to his daughter in the recent past, but in vain. Angelina stopped associating with him nearly five years ago because she felt that being around her father would not be healthy for her and her children she didnt specify who or how many.

Amisha Patel Vs Amit and Asha Patel

 It has been a long-standing fight that climaxed after Amisha took her parents to court after realising that father Amit had been mismanaging her accounts and depleting her assets to run his own audio cassette manufacturing company. She sued them for Rs 12 crore. Mother Asha added fuel to the fire by accusing Amishas ex-flame Vikram Bhatt of misguiding their daughter. A desperate Amisha had to leave her parents home and move into a rented apartment following the feud. Kaho Naa... Pyaar Nahin Hai!

Shahid Kapur Vs Neelima Azeem

 Shahid had enough of his mom Neelimas meddling in his private life after the well-known actress married for a third time. His father Pankaj Kapur and mother were divorced when he was only three. The rift between mother and son brought Shahid closer to father Pankaj after he moved out of Delhi to begin his career in Mumbai. And then Bebo happened to beta Kapur.

Britney Spears Vs Lynne Spears

 The never-ending brawl between Britney Spears and her mother Lynne Spears continues to take wild turns as mother and daughter indulged in a shocking slap fest back in mid-June. An argument ended in violence when Lynne questioned Britneys parenting skills after stomping into her house and insisting on taking her kids out for some private time with them. Spears apparently got a restraining order against her mom after the showdown and Lynne too was planning a counter strike. But mommy doesnt blame her daughter entirely. Its probably a troubled phase and a state of depression for daughter Britney, is what she believes. Hmmm....

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Monsoon magic

 What: The Telegraph and White Mischief in association with RCGC presents Monsoon Bash. 

 Where: Royal Calcutta Golf Club.

 When: Sunday night.

 Splash bash: Finally, a monsoon bash that wasnt a washout. Lose control the message was written loud and clear on the stage backdrop of the clubs annual monsoon bash. And the party swingers did just that. A little natural rain had a lot of help from artificial sprinklers on the clubs Tee Lawn. The dress code ranged from skirts to jeans and the nearly 1,200-strong crowd hovered around and on the dance floor. While youngsters had no qualms about getting drenched, the older bunch preferred to keep the evening dry. The girls seemed to outnumber the boys. We sold around 500 individual passes for girls only, said Jaideep Gangopadhyay, manager, administration, RCGC.

 Fashion fever: Beachwear was the predictable focus for a monsoon bash fashion show. Four collections by designer Mitra Bhattacharjee showcased fusion, party wear, sporty and casual beachwear. From glittering little black dresses to sarongs and bikinis, models scorched the ramp in colours bright and cheery. Feather headgear brings in the Goan carnival flavour, explained Mitra.

 Music and food: Not that the crowd needed more reason to party, but Bangalore-based DJ Ivan set the note right with house music. DJ Ritzzze also churned out some Bolly favourites. Free-flowing drinks and fresh fruit juices did the rounds while Mumbai-style Pau Bhaji, Gol Guppa and other snacks were served up to keep the energy level as high as the party spirit.

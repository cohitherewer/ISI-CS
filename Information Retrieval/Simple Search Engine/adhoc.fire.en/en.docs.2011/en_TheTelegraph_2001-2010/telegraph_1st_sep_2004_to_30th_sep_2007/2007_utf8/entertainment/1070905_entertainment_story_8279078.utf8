The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Still going strong at 71

 Dharmendra is happy to share screen space with the grandson of the man who sang his first song

 Dharmendra and Neil Nitin Mukesh in Johnny Gaddaar 

After the age of 71, most star comebacks come a cropper. But Dharmendra has managed a thumping comeback this year with two successful films Metro and Apne. I have never put myself into any bracket, says the veteran actor, whose energy levels can give several youngsters a run for their treadmill. I do not believe in the rat race but when I was not doing films, I was lifeless. What I want is love of the audience. And the love for me has come back again.

 Happily for Papaji, as Dharam is known in the industry, its not just his home banner but other producers too who are offering him interesting roles. Next up for him is Johnny Gaddaar. It is todays story, right out of the news. Today, everyone is chasing fast money this movie doesnt preach but it will subtly convey to people that our obsession with money is bad.

 This thriller revolves around five characters including Dharmendra debutant Neil Nitin Mukesh, Zakir, Vinay and Daya. I play a retired smuggler, smiles Dharmendra. We all are playing Johnny and we all are playing Gaddaar. Anyone who talks about money and only money is negative.

 Ask him to comment on newcomer Neil and Dharmendra quips, Can someone tell me whos new in the movie? To me they all were trained, seasoned actors. It didnt feel as though they were new.

 The famous face softens as he ponders: Yes, Neils first movie is with me and coincidentally my first song was sung by his grandfather Mukeshji. The song was Mujhko is raat ki tanhai mein awaaz na do.

 Dharmendra rewinds to his association with Mukesh and the early days of his struggle. When I came into this industry, I had to struggle. During those days, in the early 1960s, I was staying in the Mumbai locality of Seven Bungalow which was barely developed then. In fact there was open farmland all the way till Mehboob studio in Bandra. One day, being a Jat, I walked down to Mehboob studio as I was supposed to collect some payment from my producer who was going to be there while Mukeshji recorded his song for our film.

 After crossing the farm and upon reaching the studio, I was told that the recording had been cancelled as Mukeshji was not feeling well. It was 2 clock and I was really hungry. On the road was a restaurant owned by Gupta, a very loveable and helpful guy. But being a Jat I couldnt ask for help so I just acted as though I had forgotten my money and asked him for 10 rupees. He gave me the money, I had my lunch somewhere else and the next day, I returned the money to Gupta.

 When Mukeshji got to know this, he called me and hugged me. What an affectionate man he was. He said, Sorry Dharam, because of me, you couldnt get your money.

 Today, Dharmendra can afford to rest on his laurels but he is in no mood to do that. The last few years were very bad for us but we never cried about it, he reflects. Now I have started going to our office. I overheard Sunny saying to someone, Ask dad to come to office everyday, the moment I see him I feel confident.

 And yes, he is also putting down all his experiences in the form of an autobiography. I had started the book long time back; right now Im giving the finishing touches. I write what I feel. Let me recall something from memory for you:

 Hasrat thi parwaaz loon/Leke sab ko mein udoon/Khuda ne chehra padha/Suni sachche dil ka sada/Ho gaya roshan rasta, jaanib-e-manzil main chal padaa/Jisse bhi main ja mila, seena se mere aa lagaa/Ummad rahee thi laakho chaahate/Ban ke duaa lagi barasne/Ho gaye buland hausle/Taye hone lage faasle/Main bas chalta gaya/Kaafila badhta gaya

Judging from the crowds at Lake Land Country Club on Saturday, plenty of people in the city are stuck in the wrong job. And many share the dream of being a sports presenter.

 The auditions for the second edition of ESPN-STARs Clinic All Clear Dream Job saw actor-presenter Mandira Bedi sifting through contestants who hoped that their passion for cricket and gift of the gab would be enough to land them a slot in STAR Crickets hosting line-up.

 After Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, Calcutta is the final stop for the auditions and we are pretty impressed with the turnout that we have had today, said Mandira, sporting a short black lace dress and red streaks in her hair. The lady who is remembered as much for her noodle straps as she is for her comments on cricket was aided in the selection task by sports presenter John Dykes and Sharon van Zwieten, executive producer ESPN-STAR.

 We are looking at people who are spontaneous and passionate and have that certain X-factor. Anand Narasimhan, the winner of the last edition, had all these qualities and now works with ESPN Singapore, revealed Dykes.

 What is interesting about the audition is that it drew in hopefuls from many walks of life. If people from IT and aviation dominated the try-outs in Delhi and Bangalore, Calcutta threw up a mixed bag, including a psychiatrist! Its heartening how passionate India is about sports, remarked Dykes. Fifteen candidates from each of the five Indian cities will make it to round two of the auditions. Calcutta is the sports capital of the country and we are expecting a lot out of the candidates here, smiled Mandy.

 The auditions went international this year with ESPN-STAR zeroing in on four candidates from among the spectators of the India-England series. The final two chosen will be given the opportunity to do a story live on SportsCenter. The winner will be awarded a contract with ESPN-STAR as a sports presenter. 

 Dream Job airs from September 20.

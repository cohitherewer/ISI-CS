 Tabus the chosen one

 After completing Bhootnath with Amitabh Bachchan and Juhi Chawla (with Shah Rukh Khan in a special appearance), Ravi Chopra has started his next film, Pappu Paas Ho Gaya, with Govinda, Lara Dutta and Tabu. 

 Shedding light on the story and its characters, Ravi Chopra said: ldquo;It rsquo;s a love triangle but a very funny film. The tagline of the film is: lsquo;If you dare to dream, you can get anything in life rsquo;. rdquo;

 Tabu will play a public prosecutor in the film with a storyline that has more than a passing similarity with the Joe Pesci-Marisa Tomei-starrer My Cousin Vinny. Asked how he convinced Tabu to say yes, Ravi quipped: ldquo;It wasn rsquo;t at all difficult to convince Tabu because the role was good. She is playing a public prosecutor. Actors are convinced by nothing else but their roles and this role spoke for itself. rdquo;

 So why did Ravi not think of casting Tabu in Bhootnath too, considering Amitabh and she made such a good pair in Cheeni Kum. ldquo;I didn rsquo;t want to cast Tabu in Bhootnath because the role of Amitabh rsquo;s wife was not very significant. I didn rsquo;t want to waste her talent. rdquo; Is Juhi reading this?

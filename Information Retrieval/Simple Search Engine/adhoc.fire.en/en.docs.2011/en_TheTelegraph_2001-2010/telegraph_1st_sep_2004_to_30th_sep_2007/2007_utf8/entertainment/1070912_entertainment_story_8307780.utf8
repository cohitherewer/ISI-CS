Raktogantha, a translation of Eugene Neills Mourning Becomes Electra (by Aarshi), premiering later this month, will present sets and costumes designed by Siobhan Antolioni, a New York-based designer. And two interpretations of Tagores plays, Raktakarabi (by Kasba Arghya) and Sacrifice (by IFTA), flaunt sets and costumes conceived by artists Suvaprasanna and Shanu Lahiri. 

 Suddenly, set design is drawing big names on stage. Not too many followed Nandalal Boses footsteps after he designed the sets for Tagores dance dramas. Apart from Dharmanarayan Dasgupta and occasional forays by upcoming artists Chhatrapati Dutta and Samir Aich.

 It is unfortunate that artists have not associated themselves more often with theatre productions. It can be very fruitful, says Suvaprasanna.

 Invited by Arghya to design for Raktakarabi, directed by Manish Mitra with eight poems and six songs from Tagore, Suvaprasanna was captivated by the abstract quality of the play. 

 The theme is at once contemporary and universal. My sets help establish the significance of the two kinds of wealth described, the living greenery and people on the surface and the non-living wealth in mines. The costumes heighten the conflict between Nandini and the king. 

 His set incorporates various levels, a fort-like wall suggests a demonic visage that threatens the world of Nandini. Under certain lights, the set gives off a burnt metallic glow touched with gold.

 Designing sets for a professional theatre group will be a first for Shanu Lahiri. It seemed a worthy venture.... I have watched enough theatrical productions by the legendary Ajitesh Bandopadhyay and Sombhu Mitra in my childhood to acquire a taste. I even acted in plays arranged in our courtyard, says Lahiri, the brain behind Sacrifice. 

 The set is costing young group IFTA (Institute of Factual Theatre Arts) Rs 75,000. Its partly funded by Sangeet Natak Akademi. The bilingual production features a high structure made of several wooden bench-like forms, representing the temple and palace ramparts by turns.

 Actors clamber on the structure and play music from the mysterious shadowy interiors. There is a giant visage of Kali that can be turned easily. Under Lahiris guidance, Sangita Paul has fabricated the costumes.

 Few groups have gone for such heavy innovative structures, says production director Debasish Dutta.

 Raktogantha, directed by Abanti Chakraborty, packs the six-hour play into a little over two. The use of antique furniture and two Greek columns of plywood is eye-catching.

 Siobhan and I decided to use the columns as something that directs the play through time and space. They function as links with the original Greek tragedy of Electra and also become characters as they flow with the incidents, says Abanti.

 Raktogantha will premiere on September 17 at Academy of Fine Arts.

 Raktakarabi will be staged on September 20 at Madhusudan Mancha and Sacrifice on September 27 at Girish Mancha.

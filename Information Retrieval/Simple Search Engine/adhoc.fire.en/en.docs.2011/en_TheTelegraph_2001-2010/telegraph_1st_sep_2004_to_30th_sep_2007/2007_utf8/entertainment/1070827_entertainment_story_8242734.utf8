The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Watchable, but...

It introduces Rajveer and Neha. But Kaisay Kahein...is not a boy-meets-girl story. Nor is it a formula love story. The plot here deals with things like conflict between career and love, ego clashes, unspoken words that widen the gulf between soulmates.

 This Smita Thackeray production picks real-life situations and dwells on grown-up issues. Yet, the look of Kaisay Kahein... is so ice-candy and at times immature. Well, it might be because for both the director Mohit Hussein and the leads this is their first venture.

 In the initial scenes, both Rajveer and Neha can be seen struggling to get their act together. Its at times tiring to watch them using their hands as much as their lips while delivering dialogues. Towards the second half, however, they seem more at ease and manage much better.

 Neha looks the part of a glamourous TV journalist based in London in her well-tailored suits and minis. Rajveer is a banker on the fast track in London, but looks more like a wannabe Hrithik Roshan.

 (That suspicion is confirmed when after a heart-rending ending the screen suddenly flares up for an item number with him and Yana Gupta completely out of context.) 

 Aditi Govitrikar has a bit role as the seductive boss but she is too plastic to leave us shaken or stirred.

 Shital and Kunal, as friends, are adequate. Zarina Wahab does not have much to do.

 On the whole, KK is flawed but not a bad watch. Given the Heyy Babyy hype, however, this film will probably pass unnoticed.

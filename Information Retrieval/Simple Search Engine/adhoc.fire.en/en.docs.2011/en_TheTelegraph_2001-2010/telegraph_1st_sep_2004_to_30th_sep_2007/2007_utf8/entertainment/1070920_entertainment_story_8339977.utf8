 Cooking up a storm

 - Catherine Zeta-Jones on salmon sandwich and relationship recipe

 You play a chef in No Reservations... 

 The idea of being a chef, for me, was pretty terrifying, to be quite honest. Im serious. But we had this intense training together, which was a laugh because we arrived in this kitchen at Fiamma. Ive got my little apron on, looking ever so professional, looking at Aaron (Eckhart) going, Oh, God, my fingers coming off before you know it. We had a few weeks of that, then we were up and running. I felt very comfortable in the kitchen, and I still do, actually. 

 You cook at home now? 

 Oh, all the time. I have a new appreciation of being in a kitchen. Ive a new appreciation of when a plate of food gets put on my table, how much goes into it, as opposed to going, Is this cooked right? 

 What would you make for each other if you used the skills youve learned? 

 I think Id make Aaron some Welsh lamb, some good roasted potatoes, good food that I was brought up on.

 Do you have a favourite restaurant? 

 Theres this restaurant outside of Barcelona, which is like going into a chemistry lab. El Bulli. I went there, and it was completely jam-packed because you have to book two years in advance. So, I got to eat in the kitchen. You see all these people that looked like scientists literally concocting these amazing dishes with textures that youve never even seen or been able to feel. It was genius. Thats why, for me, that experience was one of the best Ive ever had.

 Is there anything that you cant resist? 

 Actually it sounds so ridiculous and so crazy, but Im obsessed with smoked salmon sandwiches on brown bread with potato chips in the middle crushed down. I had it on each of my pregnancies and I had it two nights ago for dinner. Its one of those comfort foods.

 Did you create this recipe?

 Yes, I did. A little bit of lemon, a little salt and pepper. 

 What was it like working with your young co-star, Abigail Breslin? 

 Well, just adorable inside and out, such a talented actress, and a real young lady. Not pretentious in any way. Ive been really lucky to be working with great talent, children that I think youre going to watch for the rest of their careers. She was an absolute dream.

 You have a busy career, but you also have a family and a husband. How do you find the balance? 

 Well, I hate to say balance with my work and my children because at the end o f the day, that is my life, and everything else is a bonus. Whats changed for me considerably since Ive had my family is that the logistics have completely gone crazy, as opposed to me being offered a role in Romania for four months, Id say, What time is my flight? Ill pack my case and Im gone. Now, I cant do that. I try to schedule my work in between times when they can either come with me or I know that Michaels (Douglas) definitely not working and hes with them.

 What is the recipe for a successful relationship?

 I think just to be kind to each other. We meet so many different people in life and sometimes we spend more time being nice and friendly to complete strangers than you do to the person you love more than anything else in the world. So, just to have that at the back of your mind, just to be respectful, kind and nice.

 What struck you about No Reservations that made you want to become involved?

 I think what the film also does is that it says, quite clearly, that its not just bereavement that you have to heal; its the way you conduct your life, the way you look at the world outside, how blinkered and how self-centered we can be, and how through different relationships, and sometimes through grief, youre able to heal and come out the other side stronger, happier and with a different life than you ever imagined you could possibly have. As for my character Kate, I found a quietness in her that I related to. 

 You play a very different role in this film than the glamorous leading lady. Did you enjoy playing somewhat against type? 

 When I read the script, I went, Wow, this is not a character that a director would naturally think of me as a slam dunk, and I think thats what was exciting to me, to be able to play a much more vulnerable character than what is necessarily an image of me on-screen. Ive found this such a fascinating experience, just the process of going in to work, and the hair and make-up every day I went in, just stuck on my chefs outfit and that bloody green coat, okay. I had a great time doing it.

 Mime and the mind

 Its mime theatre minus painted faces. And thats what promises to make this Action Players production more exciting. A bunch of 13 young adults 12 of them orally challenged and a voice actress will take the stage this evening at Gyan Manch to put up Our Time: a show in mime. 

 I have consciously done away with the stereotypical white-paint-on-the-face look and worked on emphasising the eyes more, says theatre veteran Zarin Chaudhuri, who has been directing plays for the group since 1974. 

 Some of the productions have toured the country and also gone abroad. The performers are mostly from the Oral School for Deaf Children, located on Short Street.

 At The Action Players, our aim is to showcase the capabilities of the orally challenged to the world. Some of them are immensely talented. All they need is an opportunity and we give that platform, adds Chaudhuri. 

 This time we have had the entire cast and crew to contribute to the play. Through mime, the performers are going to narrate what they feel about different issues. The spectrum is wide it can be about anything from cyber cafes to female infanticide. 

 All this has been achieved with two months of extensive rehearsals.

 Chaudhuri never auditions. She includes all those who volunteer to participate. This year, there are five new members, alongside some who have been with The Action Players for over a decade.

 Our Time will be staged in association with The Telegraph at Gyan Manch on September 1, 2, 8 and 9.

 There was nothing of Bharat Dhabolkars cheeky humour (you saw them in the Amul ads) in Its Got to be Aishwarya. Written and directed by Dhabolkar, the Mumbai play came to town last weekend.

 The plot is about a glamour-struck 22-year-old (Ananya Dutta) who arrives in Mumbai looking for her long-lost father. She dreams of making it big in Bollywood with help from her scriptwriter father. The two try to salvage their relationship and embark on a journey in self-discovery. Mona Ambegaonkar plays Alters love interest.

 But the play was monotonous from word go. The dialogues were melodramatic; the humour was trite. With no novelty in the plot it limped from scene to scene without any twists there was little stage veteran Alter could do to hold his audience members who started trickling out of a packed GD Birla Sabhagar post-interval.

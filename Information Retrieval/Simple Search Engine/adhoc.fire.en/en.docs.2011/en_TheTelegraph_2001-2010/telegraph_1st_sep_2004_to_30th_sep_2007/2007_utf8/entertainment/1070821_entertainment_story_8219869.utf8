 Tress talk from Down Under 

 Australian hair expert Millicent Howe talks to t2 about hair here and there.

 Millicent Howe is not a hair stylist. The Australian who has worked with the likes of actress Cate Blanchett and rock star Mick Jagger, prefers to be known as a creative artist. The hair expert, associated with Schwarzkopf Professional, was in the city last week for a workshop on the latest styles and colours governing the world of hair fashion. She shared these insights with t2:

 What trends have you showcased in your workshop?

 The collection that I showed here today is called Inspired Grandeur. It is inspired by my last visit to India. So, I thought the Indians should have a first look at it. Palaces, forts, drapes everything inspired me. I had to bring myself back here when I was designing the collection. That took me two weeks. Ill soon be launching it internationally too.

 The first look is called Dose of Laughter. It has a fresh look and natural tones. Distinguished Divinity has flashes of colours like honey, coffee, caramel and gold running underneath. Charged Elegance is the third look and it is more creative. I have used marbelling technique here, combining two colours. Illuminating Grace is another look where I have used browns and coppers.

 What are the trends that are going to rule the coming season?

 Curls are back in fashion. The 70s style, with big hair flicks and even short hair will do well. Length wise, you can keep it short at the back. Fringes are also back. Dont, however, cut straight fringes, for Indian women have high cheekbones and that can make your face look square.

 And the cool colours?

 Honey, golden blends, caramel, frosty brown, coffee and red. Those who have medium to light complexion can try the frosty brown.

 What is your maintenance mantra?

 Use a good shampoo and a conditioner. Cream treatment is very popular nowadays. It nourishes and moisturises your hair. 

 You have done shows in Australia as well as in other parts of the world. Are there any differences?

 You see, fashion is different everywhere. In Australia, people are more active. It is a very sporty nation. They want something that can be done quickly. There you will find lots of highlights and blondes. In the UK, they live for fashion! Bright colours and short hair do well.

 Have you noticed any changes in the Indian hair-dressing industry?

 India is elegant and glamorous. It has changed so much. There are a lot of innovations now. I have noticed a lot of workable fashion. It is also open to experiments.

 How do you strike a balance between international fashion and indigenous style in a country like India?

 You must design something that suits the culture. I am trying to teach a short haircut with a fringe that ends at the eye-line. Here in India, they would not like it. Side-partings look good on Indian women. It opens up the face and shows off the high cheekbones and almond eyes. Try layers, be it short or long. Young girls with straight hair can try disconnected layers, where short layers are followed by long layers. Long hair, if well maintained, will look nice on younger guys.

 Any Indian celebrity whose hairstyle you like?

 Who is that guy in the Motorokr advertisement (Abhishek Bachchan)? I really like his haircut. He looks well groomed and his hair is beautifully cut to suit his bone structure. There is also that guy with white beard and black hair (Amitabh Bachchan). Who is he? Even he has nice hair.

 Who has been your favourite celebrity to work with?

 Jodie Kidd. She is a British model. I love working with her.

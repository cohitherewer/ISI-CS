The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 From Ektaa to Smita

His industry peers might be swearing allegiance to Ektaa Kapoor, but former Balaji Telefilms protege Sanjit Bedi thrives on being different. The VJ-turned-actor who struck gold on television with roles in a host of K-ventures, has now shifted loyalties to Ektaas arch rival Smriti Iraani, having bagged plum roles in two television productions of the erstwhile Tulsi.

 I am blessed to have had a chance to work with Smriti Iraani. She is fantastic as a co-star and even better as a producer, gushes the former B4U VJ. Having started off with the role of a tapori in Thodi Si Zameen Thoda Sa Aasmaan (STAR Plus), Sanjit has now graduated to the suave and sophisticated Siddharth in the multi-starrer Virrudh.

 Smriti has always been very encouraging. Its not everyday that one gets the opportunity to play such diverse roles. I am having the time of my life, smiles Sanjit, clearly in awe of his mentor. 

 But doesnt working with a single producer limit an actor? You are right in a way, admits Sanjit with a grin. But Smritis production team is just like family to me and as of now I am content with whatever I am doing, he asserts.

 Not too long ago, Sanjit was a Balaji camp loyalist, with roles in popular serials like Kasautii Zindagii Kay and Kyaa Hoga Nimmo Ka. Things soured between him and Ektaa Kapoor when Sanjit was unceremoniously dropped from Kasturi. All that is in the past. Its part of the game, the actor shrugs.

 So is he open to working with Balaji again? I have no problems with anyone whatsoever. If a good role comes along, I will definitely take it up, says Sanjit.

 But much before Ektaa and Smriti made an entry into Sanjits acting career, it was the medical series Sanjeevani which made him a household name. As the popular Dr Omi, Sanjit garnered a sizeable fan following.

 Does the actor miss not being a part of Dill Mill Gaye, Sanjeevani revisited? Yes and no, actually, smiles the dimpled Sanjit. Its true that Sanjeevani gave me a lot of popularity, but Dill Mill Gaye does not have anything common with Sanjeevani. Neither the old cast, nor the old look. But, if they offer me a role similar to Omis, then I might just give it a shot, he adds quickly.

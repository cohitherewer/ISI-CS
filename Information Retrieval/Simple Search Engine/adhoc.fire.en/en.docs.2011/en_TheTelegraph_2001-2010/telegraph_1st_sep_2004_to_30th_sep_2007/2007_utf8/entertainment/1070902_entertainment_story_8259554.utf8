The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 THE HEIST HOAX

Victoria No. 203 (1973). A full-on entertainer with a handful of diamonds inside a buggy called Victoria No. 203, a sensuous Saira, and the amazing chemistry between two over-the-hill petty thieves Pran and Ashok Kumar who become instrumental in tying up the missing links between a robbery and a murder. Engrossing with a capital lsquo;E rsquo;. Let rsquo;s not even get there.

 Victoria No. 203 (2007): Diamonds Are Forever. Diamonds may be, but the film is definitely not. Forever, that is. The plot remains the same but what was fun then is now farcical, what was engaging then is now exasperating. For director Ananth Mahadevan has delivered a dud, the caricature of a mini-classic.

 Jaaved Jaaferi, as the rich Mr Bombata who plans a heist with his arm candy Preeti Jhangiani and calls her Mona, is more dumb than dangerous.

 For Sonia Vinod Mehra, this is an ill-chosen debut vehicle. To live up to Saira Banu rsquo;s sizzle is no mean task. The comparison is odious but inevitable, especially since a couple of songs are reused. Thodasa thehro, remixed of course, is reduced to a silly ad for Bombay Dyeing towels! Had the film Victoria No. 203 (1973) been digitally coloured and released, Saira Banu rsquo;s sex appeal would have beaten Sonia rsquo;s by a mile. Jimmy Sheirgill looks good that rsquo;s about it. Kamal Sadanah, the producer, plays the bad guy Ranjit.

 The actual robbery of the diamonds, during the opening sequences, apes the Entrapment laser-dodge routine made famous by Catherine Zeta-Jones in a body suit. Here, it rsquo;s merely a mindless excuse to display Tora rsquo;s cleavage, from every possible angle. 

 After their sorry sleaze show in Buddha Mar Gaya, the two buffoon buddhas Om Puri and Anupam Kher are back in form with this Raja-Rana caper. Their lines are funny and they are good fun to watch. Do bechare can still make you smile, despite the rap and bhangra beat.

 But that can rsquo;t be reason enough to watch Victoria No. 203, remixed of course.

 Terror tale

 A few minutes into the new Bhatt film Dhokha and you may be excused for thinking it rsquo;s an Urdu classroom where five words are taught mdash; zillat, kaum, mulk, junoon, jehaadi. 

 Like all of Pooja Bhatt rsquo;s films, the heart is in the right place. Who rsquo;s the real terrorist? The woman who blew up a club as a suicide bomber or the policeman who raped her? Who is the messiah and who is the monster? The man who inspires young minds to die for a perceived cause or the world leader who kills in the name of defence?

 Pertinent questions all, but it is the treatment that makes it all so cliched and tedious.

 Dhokha starts off fast and furious. Cop Zayed (Muzammil) finds himself giving blood in a hospital after a Mumbai blast at a nightclub. All hell breaks lose when his wife Sarah (Tulip) is named as the suicide bomber. All fingers point at Zayed, who had no inkling that his lady love was a ticking time bomb.

 From there begins Zayed rsquo;s quest for an answer to the question ldquo;why her rdquo;, that takes him into a murky back story.

 What could have been a fiercely visceral journey a la United 93, turns out to be a never-ending verbose ordeal. Pooja sure has handled a couple of scenes quite effectively, especially the one where Ashutosh Rana rsquo;s cop terrorises Anupam Kher and his two grandchildren. Your blood boils and you begin to see some sense in Sarah rsquo;s violent vengeance. But then again Pooja tries to be politically correct and balance it all out and manages to douse the fire she had herself lit.

 The performances are just like the movie mdash; mixed. While Tulip is perfect as the beauty caught in a sinister web, Muzammil is so weak in the emotional scenes that his otherwise confident debut comes a cropper. Aushima Sawhney as the other lady Nandini is really bad. Gulshan, Ashutosh, Anupam lend some credibility to the flawed enterprise. M.M. Kreem rsquo;s music soothes the senses with Roya re being the highlight.

 Paap, Holiday, Dhokha hellip; we rsquo;re waiting, Pooja!

 PDG

 Heyy Babyy

 Funnyman Sajid Khans directorial debut has had a big opening in city theatres. The laugh riot has clicked.

 Pro: Akshay, Fardeen and Riteish; the one liners; the music

 Con: If this is not your brand of humour it all seems quite stupid and so the film tends to drag; Vidya Balan is a misfit

 Ratatouille

 This animated film based on the culinary aspirations of a rat has had a decent Week One at the box office.

 Pro: Craftsmanship, Peter OTooles performance as Anton Ego

 Con: The premise is a bit silly

 Kaisay Kahein

 This attempt at a mature young love story has received a lukewarm response in its opening week, with the audience choosing to stay away from the Smita Thackeray film.

 Ballygunge Court

 Even with a good cast, this film dealing with the parent-child equation in the context of career and mobility, fails to strike a chord.

 Partner

 The Salman-Govinda partnership is still going strong with the David Dhawan comic caper emerging as one of the biggest grossers of 07. And Salman fans now have another reason to catch it.

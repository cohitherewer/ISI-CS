The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Bargain guide

 Shopright

 There are two types of salespersons aggressive and polite. The first will shake his head in strong disapproval as he is visibly shocked that you have suggested a price slash. The second whines and pleads, he smiles in earnest and says no, Madam, and please, Madam and uses con words like bouni (first sale of the day). Watch out for sister its the icing on the cake.

 Try some RTS reverse tonal strategy. Speak to him in a tone thats just the opposite of what he uses. He is thrown off-guard and thats the moment to spring the price you think is perfect.

 Always begin low. If the shirt you like is priced at Rs 120, start at Rs 80. Then work your way up to Rs 100.

 Company helps. The man behind the counter usually shrinks under the influence of several pairs of glaring eyes. 

 Even if you go back to a shop to buy the same top (maybe in a different colour) from the same salesperson, five minutes after you have been rejected, repeat the bargain process.

 Try the open-door policy for elevated bargaining power. Feel free to walk away. A good salesman will not be able to watch his victim escape. He will, in all probability, call you back at your price.

 Familiarity doesnt always breed contempt. Tell him that your sister, mother and best friend shop from him and that he will lose all his clients if he doesnt see your point of view.

 If the salesperson is a woman, pray! Believe us, she is a far tougher adversary.

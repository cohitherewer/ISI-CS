The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Just in

 Saif vs Akshaye

 Naqaab may still be running at the theatres but Abbas-Mustan are all excited about their next film Race mdash; ldquo;a film with a big canvas rdquo;. The shooting of the film starring Saif Ali Khan, Akshaye Khanna, Anil Kapoor and Sameera Reddy is over and post-production is in top gear.

 Elaborating on the title of the film, the director duo says: ldquo;People should not expect a car race as the pivot of the film although it does form part of the backdrop. It rsquo;s basically a film about two brothers, Saif and Akshaye, constantly trying to outwit each other. It promises a lot of thrills and entertainment. rdquo;

 The brothers go on: ldquo;People will see Saif in an action role after a long time and they will see Anil Kapoor and Sameera Reddy in never-seen-before roles. rdquo;

 Race is produced by Ramesh Taurani of Tips, who also backed Naqaab, which is doing decent business at the box office.

 UTV signs Kher-Kaushik

 Anupam Kher and Satish Kaushik rsquo;s in-house banner, Karol Bagh Film and Entertainment, has signed a co-production deal with UTV. Anupam Kher and Satish Kaushik will each direct one production per year and produce at least two others, which means UTV and Karol Bagh will together release at least four co-produced films per year.

 This association plans to make movies that span a variety of genres with varying budgets. The intention is to develop a blend of projects featuring established talent from the industry while also tapping into the wealth of young talent.

 Says Ronnie Screwvala of UTV: ldquo;We are very happy to be associated with Anupam and Satish in their new venture. I am confident we can combine our strengths to make movies that will break through the clutter, both commercially and creatively. rdquo;

 UTV has struck gold with films like Rang De Basanti, Khosla Ka Ghosla and Life in a...Metro.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 LIVING ON MALL STREET

 Malls and multiplexes do not come alone. A big shopping mall brings in its wake numerous other shops and restaurants, eager to cash in on the increased footfall in the area. It can be called the shadow effect. Whenever an organised structure of commercial nature like Forum or City Centre comes up, it brings with it other retailers. Since City Centre opened, many plot-owners in Salt Lake have applied to get their residential properties changed to commercial ones to lease them out, says Abhijit Das, regional director of Jones Lang LaSalle Meghraj, property consultants.

 Bazaar Kolkata, a mega-store, has come up opposite City Centre. Bata opened an outlet near one of the City Centre exits six months back. There was never this kind of customer-base in Salt Lake, says an employee of the shoe store.

 Forum has led to a mushrooming of stores on Elgin Road and Lee Road. Sumangal, Arrow and Zapp are here. As are Simaaya and Siyaa. Visitors to Forum often drop in. Even newcomers to the city usually visit the mall and stop by at the boutique, says Mayank Agarwal of Simaaya, which opened a year after Forum.

 Not just big stores. Small eateries, fruit-sellers and shops sprout near the mall. A pavement eatery has come up opposite Haldiram and caters to those working in the food court and others, grumbles Kavita Arora of Ballygunge Park.

 A mall turns a neighbourhood into a mela. But how do the residents of the area feel? Not very well. Living next door to a mall, multiplex or big store has advantages and disadvantages, but the problems often get the better of the plus points.

 Traffic trouble

 The most obvious change is in 

 the number of cars that flood the neighbourhood. A mall, 

 multiplex or mega-store means that the opening to your lane 

 is blocked by cars parked by visitors. It creates a buzz, 

 sometimes very loud, but is also a little bewildering for 

 the residents used to a quiet lane and familiar faces.

 Traffic has really increased in the area since Forum came up. During peak hours it is difficult to approach the lanes. Taxis add to the chaos, says 25-year-old lawyer Sarvapriya Mukherjee, a resident of Lee Road, opposite Forum. Sometimes the situation is so bad that one has to just walk, he adds. But there has been a positive change too. There used to be a garbage vat at the corner of the street. It was removed after the mall was opened. Also, having a hangout close to home and the presence of a young crowd feels good, says Mukherjee. 

 The impact of increased traffic has been glaring or maybe blaring in Salt Lake, one of the quietest areas of the city, pre-City Centre. There are other problems. City Centre often organises shows and contests either in the open area in front of INOX or in the Kund area. The noise is deafening. The problem becomes serious if there is a patient or a student at home, says Anin Chatterjee, a resident of EC block, adjacent to City Centre. Residents had once complained to the police about the noise pollution, the parking problem and the traffic situation; there has been a marginal improvement since. 

 15 minutes for Fame

 Metropolis, which houses Fame, 

 Big Bazaar and a pub or two and is next to Hiland Park, 

 a giant residential complex, signals severe traffic jams. 

 On weekends it takes close to 15 minutes just to cross 

 the stretch in front of the store and the multiplex. Rowdy 

 boys are a problem too, says Vanessa Liu, a 24-year-old 

 employee of an insurance company, who lives in Hiland Park. 

 Vanessa counts the last show at Fame as an advantage, but 

 feels commercial and residential areas should be separate.

 Kavita Arora of Ballygunge Park agrees. Ballygunge Park is no longer a tranquil area thanks to the gigantic Haldiram. The problems far outweigh the advantage of having a place to dine round the corner, sighs Arora. Visitors to Haldiram often park their cars in our lane. This makes it very difficult for the residents and their guests to find parking space and even enter or exit the lane, she says. The problem is aggravated during weekends and the wedding season, since Haldiram rents out its banquet hall. I have heard from neighbours that the food court puts out its garbage on the streets to be cleared away, which leaves the place filthy and stinking in the mornings, Arora adds.

 Security often becomes an issue. Earlier, in Salt Lake, an unknown face was easily spotted, but since City Centre has come up, we have all kinds of people in the block at all hours, complains resident Biman Roy.

 And there are more insidious problems. A mall stirs desire, especially in the young. It increases the tendency to spend. They might just hang out at the mall, but even a Coke or snacks at the mall is more expensive than at other places. And its natural for a kid to want the clothes and other things at the mall, if they see it all the time, or to want to watch a movie at the multiplex. The closer one stays to the mall, the more frequent are the visits, Chatterjee, of Salt Lake, feels.

 Landmark rents

 For others, that is the greatest 

 attraction of a mall. Ask Moushumi Das, 27, a media-person. 

 Leaving City Centre after dinner, her favourite hangout 

 zone, for a week is tough. I do so wish my house was 

 close to a mall. I feel like I live in a village. I envy 

 people who stay in the houses around City Centre, 

 says the resident of Tollygunge. And she is not alone.

 Real estate prices around a mall are shooting up, as residents now have to compete with retailers for a limited amount of space. From Rs 1,800-2,500 per sq ft, the price of plots on Elgin Road has gone up to Rs 4,500-Rs 5,500 in the past four years. Near City Centre, the price of property has gone up from Rs 1,200-1,600 to Rs 3,000 per sq ft in the past three years. Lease rates have gone up from Rs 15-25 to Rs 80-100 per sq ft near City Centre, says Das of Jones Lang LaSalle Meghraj.

 The property value around Forum and City Centre has gone up by 100 per cent. Around Forum the rent has gone up from Rs 3,000-4,000 to Rs 20,000 per sq ft, adds Jitendra Khaitan of Pioneer Property Management Limited.

 Mallspeak

 The malls, of course, deny they 

 have any adverse effect. Salt Lake lacked life before 

 City Centre opened. We have given the place spirit and life. 

 So many youngsters have a place to hang out, claims 

 Brigadier Kar, COO, City Centre. As for the noise, 

 we are extremely careful. We do not have outdoor shows in 

 March-April because of exams. Once a parent called me on 

 Valentines Day and told me his daughter could not 

 study. I persuaded the child be sent to the mall and told 

 him that the show would be over by 7pm, so it would not 

 hamper her studies. Whenever we have something special at 

 the mall, I send my staff to invite people staying close 

 by, he adds. 

 Forum, too, says it is socially responsible. The mall needs parking space for only about 200 more cars. But we are opening Parkomat with a capacity of 550 cars so that the neighbourhood may benefit from it, says Khushboo Saraf, brand manager of Forum. And she is quick to point out how the mall has given the place character. Today Forum is a landmark.

 If only the landmarks came with wider roads, more parking space and less chaos.

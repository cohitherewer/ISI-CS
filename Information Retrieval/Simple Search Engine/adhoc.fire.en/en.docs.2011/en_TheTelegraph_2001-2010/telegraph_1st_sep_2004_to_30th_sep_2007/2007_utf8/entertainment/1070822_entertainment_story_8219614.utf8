The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Shine on

 The first leg of The Telegraph School Awards For Excellence 2007 rolled out the red carpet for student achievers from across the state

 China Pan, a student of Deshbandhu Balika Vidyapith, passed her Madhyamik examinations with a score of 302. Most would dismiss her as just another student who managed to scrape through her exams. But what they wouldnt know was that China was suffering from tuberculosis when she took her exams.

 August 18, Saturday, was a special day for China and other champions like her. The first leg of The Telegraph School Awards For Excellence was held at Vidya Mandir where young people from across the state were felicitated for their extraordinary feats.

 China,whose father passed away when she was very young, was brought up by her mother, a domestic help, who is also very unwell and often misses work because of her health. The family can barely manage two square meals a day. So China was rewarded with the Nirmal Varma Memorial Scholarship, one of several scholarships given every year to children battling the odds to do well. Certificates of merit and honour were also handed out in a large number of competitive categories, the winners of which will be announced on August 25 at the Science City finale.

 Manshi Mitra, a student of environmental science at Vidyasagar University, was awarded the Merlin Scholarship. Her father is bed-ridden and unable to work and her sister is physically challenged. She cannot commute to Haldia everyday for classes and manages to attend just the practicals. If she has to attend class two days in a row, Manshi stays on the railway platform. 

 The Balrampur Chini Mills Award For Outstanding Talent certificates went to painters, debate champs and even numerology experts! 

 Said Kaustuv Das of Burnpur who was representing sister Oendrilla: My sister could not attend the programme as she is in Mumbai shooting for a show. But Im happy she got this certificate. Oendrilla received a certificate of merit under the outstanding talent category for her special vocal skills.

 Other categories included The Ambuja Realty Award for the Best Maintained School, the Patton Award for a School That Cares, the The Telegraph Education Foundation Award for Best Academic Performance by a School (ISC, HS and CBSE boards), the Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Trust Award for Academic Excellence by a Student, the Anand Paul Memorial Award for Social Service, the Surrendra Paul Memorial Award For Courage, Best Sportsperson of the Year and the Shaw Education Foundation Award for the Best All-Round Student. 

 The Shining Star Employee certificates were given out to the non-teaching members from school staff. Said Nabin Bagh, who received a certificate of honour in the category: I have cherished all of the 33 years that Ive spent in Loreto House. And it was an honour to receive this certificate.

 The programme ended with a vote of thanks from host Barry Brien. The Telegraph School Awards is all about reaching out and lending a helping hand. Please remember to do your bit. Even if it is by not complaining when your parents ask you to study.

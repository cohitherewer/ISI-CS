 Time for KJos Koffee break

 Karan Johar with Farah Khan, Deepika Padukone and Shah Rukh Khan

 Karan Johar still cant have enough of Chak De! India. He has seen the film more than once and considers it to be one of the best films of the decade.

 Chak De! has completely blown my mind, KJo tells us over phone from Mumbai. I think it is one of the most outstanding films that I have seen in a very very long time. And all I can say is more power to cinema, more power to people who support cinema like this and keep us on our toes and egg us to do better.

 The presence of best friend Shah Rukh Khan, of course, makes it extra special for Karan who is planning his next movie My Name Is Khan with SRK of course. And he had Shah Rukh for what was the last guest episode of this seasons Koffee With Karan on STAR World and STAR One.

 I thought Shah Rukh was a great way to finish the season, he explains. He began it (with Kajol and Rani), so he should finish it. Also, he had a release coming up Om Shanti Om. That made it a very topical show.

 Although ravishing OSO debutante Deepika Padukone was present on the Koffee couch on Sunday, Karan attributes the success of the episode to the camaraderie between Farah Khan and Shah Rukh. It was super fun because of them. The chemistry between Farah and Shah Rukh is unbelievable and thats because they are so close to each other.

 Shah Rukh, of course, stole the show with his usual witty one-liners. Am I child molesting? he queried when reminded that Deepika was eight years old when she watched Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. Then he went on to talk about the six-pack body hes working on. Ive just got four till now! But the most hilarious moment was when SRK did a Madhuri Dixit impersonation when asked about the sexiest mom around. With that (American) accent she cant be sexy! he joked.

 Karan is, of course, unfazed by allegations that he only brings his friends on the show and serves Koffee to promote their films. People say lots of things, he says casually. You have to do your own thing. I always tell people that if you have a problem watching me with my friends, then dont watch it. Such conviction comes from the fact that Season Two of Koffee With Karan has had a heady brew. I am very happy with the feedback weve got. We had different kinds of people this time, other than people from my comfort zone. And I was very thrilled with the way I conducted myself in those interviews!

 But it aint over just yet. We have two very interesting episodes coming up, Karan reveals. One is the making of Koffee and the other is the Koffee Awards. We have done nominations and also have a jury deciding on those nominations. We have done it in a very intimate and sweet way.

 That taken care of, it will be one long Koffee break for KJo. Yes, it will be off for some time at least, he says. I have too many things to handle at the moment. I have a channel (NDTV Imagine) which starts next year and I am going to be an active part of that. Otherwise Sameer Nair is at the helm of things and he is doing a super job. More than anything else there are films that I am producing. I am also directing one next year. Lots of films to make, lots to do...

 And what are those films? My Name Is Khan, the film I am directing, with Shah Rukh will start mid next year, sometime in May or June, reveals Karan. Then theres my assistant Tarun Mansukhanis film. Aishwarya is not doing it. Theres Abhishek (Bachchan), John (Abraham) and Priyanka (Chopra). And there are a couple of other projects which I want to announce a little later.

 Not just behind the camera, whenever he gets a chance Karan takes a crack at the camera. The latest in that pursuit is a commercial for ICI Paints with Kareena Kapoor. That was great fun, shooting the ad in Jodhpur, he laughs. And more so because it was Kareena. We have a great comfort zone with each other.

 But life hasnt been all smiles for Karan, what with friends Sanjay Dutt and Salman Khan looking down the wrong end of the legal barrel. When I speak about Sanjay and Salman, I will always speak emotionally, he says. I know both of them and their families very well. I just hope and pray that things sort themselves out for them. They are very special people and as film industry people we all love them a lot.

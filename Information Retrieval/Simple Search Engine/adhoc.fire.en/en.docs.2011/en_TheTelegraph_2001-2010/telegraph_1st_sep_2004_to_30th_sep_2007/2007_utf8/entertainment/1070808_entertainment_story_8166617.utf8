 Suddenly something

 Ones confused about a last-minute marriage proposal and anothers not sure if its time to call it quits... Swastika Mukherjee to the rescue

 I have been dating this guy for three years and till now, I saw no signs of a marriage proposal. He was due to leave for his Ph.D for five years, and I was worried that our relationship would come to an end. Suddenly, he proposed the day before he was going! He cant take me along right now, nor can I leave my job and family behind. What do I do?

 Three years is a long time to invest in a relationship. Why he chose the day before leaving to propose, I dont know. Does he have any plans to come down in the near future?

 And do you want to marry him in the first place? If the answer to these questions is a yes, I think you should discuss the issue with your folks and tie the knot when he is here and then leave with him, or whenever the visa formalities are complete. Long-distance relationships are very unpredictable and best avoided. Five years is a long time to be apart, and who knows what will happen.

 My boyfriend and I never seem to agree on anything, whether it is a dish in a restaurant or a movie. If I want to eat Chinese, he wants Indian food. If I want to see Harry Potter, he wants to watch Die Hard! We end up having major fights. Compromising is becoming too much of an issue. Should we just call it quits? 

 Sneha

 Since you have already thought of the quit option, I think you should simply go ahead and end it! If you think you are not compatible and you cannot compromise anymore, why prolong the relationship unnecessarily? 

 You clearly dont feel it is worth it, and trust me, you will have to compromise a hell of a 

 lot more than this in future if you do 

 decide to stick 

 it out.

 It doesnt sound like you have strong feelings for this guy at all, if the choice of restaurant is becoming your main issue. And dont you have anyone else you can watch movies with?

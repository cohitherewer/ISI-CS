The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 It is a picture of neglect

 SUDEEP CHATTERJEE 

 recalls how growing up in Calcutta played a big part in him 

 taking up the camera for Chak De India

 After Iqbal, Kalpurush, Dor and Jaan-e-Mann, Sudeep Chatterjee is poised to score big with Yash Raj Filmss Chak De India starring Shah Rukh Khan. Shuttling between Melbourne and the YRF Studios in Andheri, heres Sudeep Chatterjee talking to t2 about shooting what is Indias first out-and-out sports film.

 You are very choosy about what you shoot. Why did you take 

 up Chak De India?

 I always like to do something which I have not done before. Its like a challenge to me. Chak De India presented to me the opportunity of shooting an out-and-out sports film. I love action a lot. Tarpor Kolkatar chhele... I love sports. I may not have ever been a sportsman but being in Calcutta I grew up in an atmosphere where I could appreciate a century by Sunny Gavaskar or cheer Mohun Bagan against East Bengal. So I thought I could relate to the game of hockey. Also I wanted to do something drastically different after Jaan-e-Mann.

 What kind of a look did you plan for Chak De India? 

 That hockey the game is in a state of neglect, I wanted 

 that to come out visually. So I wanted to shoot the sport 

 in locations which are not glamorous. Run it down in a way. 

 But then again this was a Yash Raj film starring Shah Rukh 

 Khan. So I couldnt go completely deglamourised. I 

 tried to create a worked-upon look which stimulates reality. 

 So we ended up using a lot of desaturation and a lot of 

 toning here and there. Adi (Aditya Chopra, producer) had 

 a very different look in his mind but he was very open. 

 We used tube lights a lot for the shoots inside the studios, when we had to show living quarters, dormitories, locker rooms.

 Since hockey is such a fast-paced sport was it difficult 

 to shoot an actual match?

 We shot almost 70 to 80 per cent of the film hand-held. See, hockey has never been shot before on this scale anywhere in the world. And hockey by itself is not a very cinematic sport. You have these people bent over running around with sticks. Khali chokhe (naked eye) jeta dekhte bhalo lage camera-te lage na... So we took the help of Rob Miller who runs a sports action choreography company called Reel Sports. He turned the whole action into a dance choreography. The entire ground plan was turned graphically into a comic book storyboard.

 How many cameras would you set up for one shot? Initially 

 we had planned to use six cameras at the same time. But 

 then we ended up shooting with a maximum of three cameras 

 simultaneously. The hand-held camera brought a lot of energy 

 to the proceedings and then we used what we shot with the 

 static cameras for the cutaways.

 Cinematographers have great things to say about Shah Rukh. 

 What did you think of him? I have not seen an actor 

 so technically perfect. Mark neoa, light bojha... 

 he is always spot on. Also, his involvement and excitement 

 levels are truly infectious. He is a treat to work with.

 Shimits first film Ab Tak 

 Chhappan was quite a visceral trip...

 You will get that gritty feel in Chak De as well. For the last one year that man doesnt know anything but hockey. He is like a scientist. Also, he is very evolved photographically. I did get a lot of support from him in my attempt to make the movie a complete departure from how Hindi movies are shot. 

 Any favourite sports films? I only started watching 

 sports films after I took up Chak De. I liked Oliver 

 Stones Any Given Sunday and Kon Ichikawas 

 documentary Tokyo Orimpikku on the Tokyo Olympics. 

 Chak De India has supposedly used 1,500 cans of raw 

 stock, which is a record of sorts in Indian cinema... Its 

 around 1,000 cans. On an average a film uses 500 cans. Here 

 we were shooting with three cameras simultaneously. So whenever 

 we had to retake we were wasting stocks of three cameras 

 together. Thats no big deal. We had estimated 1,200 

 cans.

 What next? I have already shot two Nagesh Kukunoor films 

 Bombay To Bangkok and Aashayein. Then I 

 am shooting Kunal Kohlis next with Saif and Rani.

 Just do it

 As the India Now festival reaches a crescendo, a new British release, starring Harish Patel, disappoints big time

 A moment from Run Fatboy Run

It began with a replica of the Taj on a barge, and last Sunday it reached a crescendo with the arrival of the Bollywood Brass Band. Londons three-month long festival, India Now, took over one of the citys premier shopping streets, Regent Street, for an all-out party. 

 The name of the eight-hour event, Indian Summer, seemed like wishful thinking after the UK has suffered one of its whimpiest summers in a decade. But, although the sky was overcast (again), the parade was not rained on and the sounds and sensations of India were out in force. 

 Of these, Bollywood pop was the first to hit the eardrum. A main stage tent sponsored by BBC Asian Network delivered a sizzling dance routine, Bollywood Grooves. Elsewhere an array of street performers showed off specialised Indian dance performances, an aerial trapeze act wowed and amazed, a bazaar boasted Indian handicrafts, Londons Apple store housed a Bollywood DJ and a series of photo-booths gave visitors the opportunity to take pictures of themselves before painted fairy-tale backdrops from India. 

 But the highlight had to be the Bollywood Brass Band. The crowd roared as an ensemble of trumpets, tubas and trombones delivered renditions of Dum maro dum and Love is Sweeter than Sugar. I asked one Indian family of three watching if they were enjoying the day. My son is, the father told me as he lifted his five-year-old aloft, giving him a better view.

 Also in the UK this week the film Run Fatboy Run, starring Harish Patel (of Chicken Tikka Masala, Pyaar Mein Twist and Calcutta Mail), got a nationwide release. Patel played Mr Ghosh Dastidar, an obese landlord who turns into an unlikely marathon coach. He takes on his tenant Dennis (Simon Pegg), who is looking to redeem himself after deserting his fiance Libby (Thandie Newton), at the altar. Dennis tries to win back the woman of his life by running the London Marathon. He is encouraged by Libbys new fiance Whit (Hank Azaria), a muscled and squeaky-clean American marathon enthusiast. The film is directed by ex-Friends star David Schwimmer. 

 It would have been a nice enough rom com. But its gait becomes overly affected and its all because of the relentless Nike footwear it appears to be wearing. For starters the London Marathon-inspired event is named the Nike River Run. Harmless enough, but the film degenerates into a clear case of Nike product placement running amok. 

 At one point Whit, proposing to Libby, tells an assembled audience that passion, determination and stamina are all things that love has in common with running. Next shot: Whit proposes to Libby with an engagement ring discovered inside, guess what, a pair of Nike trainers. Im surprised the script-editors werent inspired to turn the question will you marry me? into just do it. 

 Pegg and Patel both turn in fine performances, Pegg bursting with a compelling mix of determination and self-loathing and Patel with a winning, infectious charisma. But sadly both actors find themselves in a film that looses self respect by hotfooting it towards a wince-worthy gala of Nike-endorsed individualist rhetoric. Patel is even seen telling Dennis that his Nike trainers will help you be a good man. Come again? Give us a film, not a two-hour commercial.

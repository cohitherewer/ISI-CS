 What: Launch of Camellia Tea Bar. 

 Where: Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC).

 When: August 23.

 Sip it up: Two new tea stops from Assam Company Limited have come up at RCTC. A 150-sq-ft tea stop is housed in the Grand Enclosure and a 25-sq-ft kiosk has been set up in the Members Enclosure. If you like your tea hot, try out Masala Tea, Dhaba Special, Hot Buttered Apple Tea or Saffron Tea. Then there are mocktails like Litchi Tea, Lady Marmalade, Wine Tea, Grappa Tea and Tea Colada. 

 Film-maker Goutam Ghose and actress Locket Chatterjee were present at the launch. My father was very finicky when it came to tea and he liked his drink to be perfectly brewed and blended. For me, it is almost 10 cups of tea a day, revealed Ghose. Locket was all for the cool beverages. They are not only refreshing, but a great healthy substitute to cold drinks.

 For something more filling, dig into brownies, patties, burgers and momos. And if teas not your thing, try the vanilla, strawberry, mango, chocolate or coffee shake.

 Pocket pinch: While ordinary tea is priced at Rs 4, specials like Tea Colada come for Rs 33. 

 Voiceover: The idea is to spread tea awareness and make the brand popular. We are looking at expansion within the city as well as other metros, said Mukundan Raman, vice president, marketing, Assam Company Limited.

 Opening gaffes 

 CHAPTER SEVEN OF THE DEATHLY HALLOWS MAKES ABHIJIT GUPTA SIT UP AND DISSECT REALLY GOOD BAD WRITING

Like many others the world over, I read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows soon after July 21, and was pleasantly surprised by the fairly satisfactory denouement of the seven-part saga. But then in Chapter Seven, I came across the following paragraph:

 Theres the silver lining Ive been looking for, she whispered, and then she was kissing him as she had never kissed him before, and Harry was kissing her back, and it was blissful oblivion better than firewhisky; she was the only real thing in the world, Ginny, the feel of her, one hand at her back and one in her long, sweet-smelling hair.

 A paragraph like this would not have passed muster in a college magazine, so either Rowling was having a really bad day, or the copy-editor had fallen asleep, blue pencil in mouth. Or maybe it was deliberately written, intended to provide the strangely perverse pleasure that bad writing often generates.

 Really good bad writing is a minor art form, or in any case, ought to be. Prizes are sometimes given to honour (?) such writing, of which the most prestigious is the Bulwer-Lytton prize, given to the most wretched opening paragraph of a novel. The prize is given yearly by the English department of San Jose State University, and contestants are invited to compose the opening sentence to the worst of all possible novels. Each entry must consist of a single sentence thought the sentences may be of any length (for details see www.bulwer-lytton.com).

 But why Bulwer-Lytton? The man was a more-than-readable Victorian novelist, with such potboilers to his credit such as The Last Days of Pompeii and The Coming Race, the last-named one of the earliest genuine science-fiction novels. But in Paul Clifford, he had the misfortune of starting his novel with the phrase It was a dark and stormy night, surely the most-mocked opening lines in the history of the novel. Those who follow the cartoon strip Peanuts will know that this is the only line that the Beagle Snoopy succeeds in writing when he sits down at his typewriter.

 My own favourite worst ending is Where now? Who now? When now? from Samuel Becketts unreadable novel The Unnameable. Not far behind is his one-time employer James Joyces opening to Finnegans Wake: riverrun, past Eve and Adams, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs, which is actually a continuation of the last line of the novel. Finally, I close with one of the shortlisted entries for this years Bulwer-Lytton award. This one did not win the prize, but in my opinion, fully deserved to do so: As a scientist, Throckmorton knew that if he were ever to break wind in the echo chamber, he would never hear the end of it. Indeed.

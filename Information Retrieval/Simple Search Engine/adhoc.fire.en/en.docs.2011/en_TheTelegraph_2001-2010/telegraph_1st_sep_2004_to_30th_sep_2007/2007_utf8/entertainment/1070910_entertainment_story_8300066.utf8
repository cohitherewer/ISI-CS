 John Abrahams appetite

 JOHN ABRAHAM on his gift of the grub.

 The first thing I have in the morning is: A cup of tea. I like to have a strong cuppa in the morning with a fair amount of sugar, but with less milk. I drink a lot of tea throughout the day. I know that can cause acidity but I cannot help it. Later, I have my breakfast which consists of milk along with seven-eight eggs, either an omelette or scrambled, with slices of toast.

 I turned vegetarian: In the late Nineties. When I was a non-vegetarian, my favourite food would be Patrani Machhi, now it is Dhansak.

 My favourite vegetables: I am fond of all vegetables, even karela and brinjal. I like paneer, salads and can guzzle carrot juice at any time.

 My favourite spice is: Cinnamon. But by and large, I go for non-spicy vegetarian fare that has been made at home.

 My lunch when I am shooting: I don rsquo;t carry food from home, I have fruits galore. I don rsquo;t have a problem eating the unit food but if it rsquo;s oily I stick to just daal and chawal or maybe order a salad.

 My favourite junk food: I don rsquo;t eat junk food because it leaves me with a very uneasy feeling. I think a pizza is an exaggerated and overpriced food item.

 For my workout I eat: Normal food. But I make sure I eat a good amount of proteins. I work out for about an hour, three-four times a week. My aim is not to build my body but to keep myself fit. Also, I feel, big is not lsquo;in rsquo;, neither is huge and muscular. But I don rsquo;t want to be too lean either.

 My favourite cook is: My mom. She makes the best food in the world.

 My favourite cuisine: Parsi food, especially Lagan nu Bhonu. I also relish South Indian food, since my dad is a Keralite. My favourite is Appam. I also like Puttu with coconut milk or stew.

 Eating out is: Fun but I am not really a restaurant person. Since mom loves fish, I like taking her out sometimes to a restaurant. When I am eating out, I usually have a clear vegetable soup, daal and rice. If I am having a Chinese meal, I order stir-fried vegetables.

 My favourite restaurants: Thaibaan in Bandra and Jimmy Boy, which serves excellent Parsi food. Abroad, I like Jaya in New York mdash; the ambience there is breathtaking. At any restaurant, the food and service have to be good. I wish restaurants would go easy on the artificial colouring.

 Desserts I am fond of: Once in a while, I binge on brownies and fudges or Indian sweets but by and large I don rsquo;t feel the urge to have something sweet after a meal.

 My favourite beverage: Besides tea, I like a cappuccino. I am not into cocktails and mocktails. But once in a blue moon, I have a shot of tequila or a pint of beer.

 My Sunday lunch consists of: Vegetable Dhansak or vegetable pulao made by my mom.

 My cooking abilities are: Non-existent. I can rsquo;t cook anything.

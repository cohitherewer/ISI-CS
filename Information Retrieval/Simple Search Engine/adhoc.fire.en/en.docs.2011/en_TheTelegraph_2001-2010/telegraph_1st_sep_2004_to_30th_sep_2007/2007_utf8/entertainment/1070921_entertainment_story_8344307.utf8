The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 The Sen siren

 She doesnt mind being trapped in her sexy image and shes in no hurry to prove herself. Suchitra Sens youngest granddaughter exudes a carefree charm, and also loads of attitude. Riya Sen uncorks her thoughts for t2 while partying at Hushh, City Centre. 

 What are your forthcoming movies? I have two movies, Love Tadka and Mera Bharat Mahan. Love Tadka is being directed by Srinivas and I was not very sure of the role. But he persuaded me and now I am very happy I did the film. I play a schoolgirl in the film. Not any glamorous schoolgirl though. My co-actor is Randeep Hooda and there are other female stars. Its a relationship-based story and looks at each of the womens relationship with Randeep. 

 Mera Bharat Mahan is a multi-starrer and a comedy. It has everybody including Salman Khan and Bobby Deol.

 What do you look for while choosing a film?

 The banner. Thats very important. I hardly look at the length of the role or how many stars there are in the film. When Subhashji (Subhash Ghai) called me for Apna Sapna Money Money, he had called me with two films Apna Sapna and Good Boy Bad Boy. He asked me which one Ill do. I asked him to choose for me. Finally I did Apna Sapna And I am so glad I did it. I got so many offers after that film, but I am in no tearing hurry. I am choosing only the best ones. I also enjoy doing ad films and I make many promotional appearances.

 Doesnt the length of the role matter to you at all?

 No. If you do good work, you are noticed. The length doesnt matter. And I dont mind doing special appearances. 

 You dont seem to be in a rush to prove yourself...

 I am not. Theres enough work in Mumbai now for everybody. There is no need to feel stressed. I consciously do only one or two movies a year and some ad films.

 Your image is that of a sexy actress. Arent you bothered by such typecasting?

 You cant avoid it! Here you are typecast after your very first film. Personally though, I have no problems with my image.

 And the controversies that surround you? I dont care. I dont read the articles any more. I just count them.

 Do comparisons with your sister Raima affect your relationship with her? 

 Comparisons are unavoidable I guess. I am used to it. But in no way does it affect my relationship with Raima. If I get a good film Raima is the first person Ill call and its the same with her. We confide in each other more than in our parents.

 Do you regret not doing The Bong Connection with her?

 I never regret anything. I havent seen the movie, but I am glad it did so well.

 Any plans to do a film with Raima?

 Only if there is a good offer. 

 What is your biggest asset as an actor?

 (Thinks) I dont know! (Laughs)

 Looks? 

 Sure, thats important.

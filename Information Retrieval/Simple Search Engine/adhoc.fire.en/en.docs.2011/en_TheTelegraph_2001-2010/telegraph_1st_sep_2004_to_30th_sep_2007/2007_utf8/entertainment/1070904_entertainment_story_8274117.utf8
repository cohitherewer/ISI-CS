 City analysts caught out by recent stock market slump would have done well to heed the autumn/winter fashion collections unveiled at the start of the year. The first shoots of financial trouble emerged back in February, just after designers sent midi-length skirts which hover anywhere between the knee and mid-calf down the catwalks. As extraordinary as it might sound, hemlines and prosperity go hand in hand. Almost without fail, skirt lengths rise when times are good, and fall when theyre bad. 

 This observation, dubbed the hemline effect, was first made in the 1920s by economist George Taylor. As markets soared after the First World War, Taylor noted, skirts rose to daring new levels. After the Wall Street Crash in 1929, hemlines tumbled to the ankles, where they remained throughout the 1930s. Its a theory that was borne out time and again throughout the last century.

 This years autumn/winter collections herald a dip in hemlines, from last summers mini to the midi-length skirt. Which means, by Taylors model, the markets are in for a stormy patch. Its time to start tightening your belts.

 Its not just grim news for economists. Women are divided about the virtues of the midi. Fashion people see it as refreshing, exciting and challenging stylist-speak for extremely tricky to pull off but others are justifiably concerned about the merits of wearing a skirt that can look both unsexy and unflattering (on the wrong shape, it can draw attention to stumpy legs).

 Perushka de Zoysa, contemporary buying manager at Selfridges, agrees. Midi-skirts might have looked great on the catwalk, but in reality they are quite tricky to wear, she says. Put them with the wrong things, and you go from 1940s siren to frumpy teacher in one swift move.

 Theres a knack to carrying off a midi with style and its mostly in the buying. First, avoid mid-calf-length skirts that are excessively billowy or printed, which is a certain recipe for frumpiness. Marc Jacobss below-the-calf-length skirts were a borderline success on the models what hope for mere mortals?

 Instead, take a tip from the Louis Vuitton catwalk, where midis came in shimmering metallics: a flash of intense colour makes gentle A-line shapes look sharper and more modern especially if you add a contrasting patent leather belt and floppy Vermeer-style beret.

 One of the seasons most prominent looks is the 1940s, and the midi plays a key role. Many designers, from Alberta Ferretti to Antonio Marras at Kenzo, have produced skinny 1940s-style, fine-tweed skirts which look fabulous paired with silky or satin tops. Just avoid thicker tweeds, which look bulky and schoolmarmish. According to Bridget Cosgrave, womenswear buyer for the Matches boutiques, the safest midi silhouette is the pencil skirt. Alexander McQueens pencil encapsulates the best way to wear it, she says. The cinched-in waist adds definition and it hits at the calf, which is the most flattering. The key with the midi is to be mindful of proportion, she advises. Balance the length with a fitted silhouette to keep the look young and create a lean, elongated shape.

 As Yasmin Sewell, buying director of Browns, points out, the right shoes are crucial. This is a very sophisticated length for all ages, but its very important to keep ankles slim. Either wear it with high heels or a great boot that really tapers in on the ankle. Definitely no slouchy leg boots, and avoid flats altogether.

 The new length will also have an impact on other parts of our wardrobes. Shorter jackets or 1940s-style swingy coats that end at the hip work best. Underneath, opt for neat, fitted sweaters and tops especially with narrow belts.

 Love amp; voyeurism

 Buddhadeb Dasgupta rsquo;s latest film hits the festival route.

 Buddhadeb Dasguptas curiously titled Ami Yasin Arr Amar Madhubala (The Voyeurs) is not yet ready for release but is all set to trot the film festival circuit. 

 First up is the Toronto International Film Festival, where Ami Yasin... will be screened in the masters section, followed by the Athens and London film festivals. 

 Ami Yasin... has three pivotal characters Prosenjit the first person in the title, Amitabha Bhattacharya who is Yasin and Sameera Reddy who is not Madhubala. Though the film seems to be about Peeping Toms, its as much about love and failed communication.

 Besides, voyeurism brings in the more weighty issues of mistaken identities with a hint of terrorism when the two youths are caught catching a girl on camera and the ordeal that follows.

 But theres a strong romantic undercurrent even if its not a romantic film on the surface, says Prosenjit, who plays the title role of Dilip, a youth from the suburbs working in the city. 

 He is into computers and cameras, and when Sameera starts living next door, Dilip gets into the habit of watching her. He is joined by Yasin, another suburban youth trying his luck in the city.

 Dilip is enamoured of the screen goddess Madhubala but eventually falls for Sameera, the simple girl from the suburbs. Its as if his feelings for Madhubala are transposed on to this girl. He shares his thoughts with his computer but never musters up the courage to confess it to the girl. So when he is caught, she misunderstands him for being just a voyeur, explains Prosenjit.

 And thats a point that Dasgupta wants to drive home about communication (or the lack of it) being the cause of problems in love. Its all right as long as Dilip shares his feelings with the computer, but the moment it comes to interacting with the object of his love, problems begin. I think I have made a different film, says Dasgupta, who won the national award for the fifth time this year (for Kalpurush).

 Madhubala, Dasgupta feels, is a figure most Indian men including him have been in love with in the first flush of youth. 

 For Sameera, Ami Yasin... is her second film with Dasgupta after Kalpurush. Though she plays a middle-class Bengali girl in both films, her look and characterisation are completely different, adds Dasgupta. 

 Producer B.A.G Films plans to release this Bengali film with English subtitles across the country by the year-end. We want to do more films with Dasgupta, as his films are a success both commercially and at festivals, says Anuradha Prasad, managing director, B.A.G Films, which forayed into regional films last year with a Punjabi release. The Bengali film industry is really big, only after the Marathi film industry, and we are open to good concepts.

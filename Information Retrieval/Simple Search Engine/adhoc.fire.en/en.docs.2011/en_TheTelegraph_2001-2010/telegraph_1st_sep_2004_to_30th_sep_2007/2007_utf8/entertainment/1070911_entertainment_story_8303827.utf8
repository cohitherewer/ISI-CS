 New Zealand calling

 Lincoln University at Christchurch

New Zealand is the hottest new education destination, offering a whole range of undergraduate and postgraduate courses in business, computer science, engineering, health and social sciences to the more eclectic Maori studies.

 At the recent career fair held at The Oberoi Grand, Perya Short, who works with the ministry of education and is presently posted at the New Zealand High Commission in New Delhi, briefed students about the advantages of studying in New Zealand. 

 There are a number of universities, colleges and technical schools offering quality education that nurtures individuality and originality. The cost of living and tuition fees is lower than that in America, England and Australia and the fairly large international community along with job opportunities and low unemployment rates make this a viable education destination and future career opportunities, said Short.

 Over 20 educational institutions were represented at the fair, and drew quite a substantial crowd. The universities present included AUT University, Massey University, Cornell Institute of Business and Technology, Unitech New Zealand, Natcoll Design Technology and University of Canterbury.

 The cost of studying in New Zealand, including tuition and living costs, is an average of between Rs 2 and Rs 4 lakh per year, explained Short. A good academic record and IELTS scores are requisites for admission in universities in New Zealand and many of the admission officers were offering on-the-spot admissions. A job with a six-month extension on the visa, plus industry contacts, are added incentives. Other selling points being highlighted were tie-ups with Indian technical institutes, a big Indian migrant community, the scenic beauty, bright career prospects and care provided to international students.

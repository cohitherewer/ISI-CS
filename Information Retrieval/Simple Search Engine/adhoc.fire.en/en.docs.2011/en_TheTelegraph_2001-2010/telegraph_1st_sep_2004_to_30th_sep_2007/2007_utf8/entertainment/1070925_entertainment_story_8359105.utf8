 Eye defined

An Indian womans favourite beauty tool, kajal can make ones eyes speak volumes. Beauty indeed lies in the eyes of the beholder its the kajal ka kamaal!

 Ones tryst with the dark beauty usually begins during campus life and lasts forever. Theres nothing like traditional homemade surma, which is applied with the fingers. Though not everybody is lucky to get hold of this, it works like magic and is wonderfully dark and strong.

 When buying kajal or eyepencils, dont compromise on the brand. Kajal comes into contact with the eye and its best not to take chances.

 Watch out for marketing tricks. Lots of kajal pencils are enclosed in long and sleek casing but end halfway down. Decide if you want kajal that needs sharpening or if you prefer the readymade roll-up variety. 

 The most annoying thing about any kajal is if it rubs off easily. Dont hesitate to test its longevity at the counter before you make your purchase. 

 Try not to use mascara or kohl thats older than six months as your make-up provides good conditions for bacterial growth, and you wouldnt want to end up with an infection.

 Experiment with colour. Instead of everyday black, pick up a glittery kajal for those special dos or use a nice blue one for a refreshing change (but only if it looks good with your skin tone).

 Even if youre dog tired, take a minute to wipe those eyes clean before you hit the sack, or you might just end up looking like a raccoon in the morning.

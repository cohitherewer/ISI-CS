The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 BOX OFFICE

 RGV Ki Aag

 Easily one of the biggest Bollywood disasters of the year, RGV Ki Aag is playing to near empty theatres in the city, even on weekends. The big-budget star-studded enterprise is a total washout at the box office.

 Pro: Nothing.

 Con: Everything.

 Dhokha

 Following in the footsteps of Aag, Pooja Bhatts take on terrorism through the eyes of a suicide bomber and her unsuspecting husband has had a poor opening at the box office.

 Pro: A script with potential; some gripping moments; Tulip Joshi 

 Con: Too verbose and preachy; a wooden Muzammil Ibrahim

 Victoria No. 203

 Completing the hat-trick of flop releases this week is Victoria No. 203, a dismal version of the Ashok Kumar-Pran-Saira Banu caper.

 Pro: Anupam Kher and Om Puri doing the Raja-Rana act; funny one-liners

 Con: A weak supporting cast; lacks the punch of the original

 Heyy Babyy

 In the absence of any real competition, funnyman Sajid Khans comic caper continues its strong run on city screens, with the crowd count swelling rather than dwindling.

 Pro: Akshay, Fardeen and Riteish; the music; the baby. 

 Con: Vidya Balan is miscast.

 Chak De! India

 Its all good news for SRK and the Chak De! girls as they continue to lure cinegoers in Week 4.

 Pro: Shah Rukh Khan hasnt looked and acted better; the supporting cast; gender and region sensitive

 Con: Nothing really

 Ratatouille

 After a decent opening week at the box office, Ratatouilles occupancy figures have dipped in Week 2.

 Pro: Craftsmanship, Peter Tooles performance as Anton Ego.

 Con: The premise is a tad silly.

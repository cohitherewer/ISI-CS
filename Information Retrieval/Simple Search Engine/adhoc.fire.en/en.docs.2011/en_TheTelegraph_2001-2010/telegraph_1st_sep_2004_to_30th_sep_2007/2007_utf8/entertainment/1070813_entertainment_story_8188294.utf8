 I stay in shape by...

 DIETER rsquo;S DIARY

 Surbhi Bajoria, 19, joined Solace about two years ago in order to maintain her slim frame.

 Last year, lack of proper diet and workout saw her piling on quite a few kilos. I put on some 7 kg, says Surbhi, whose weight shot up to 64 kg. Since then, regular workout sessions and a wholesome diet have taken care of her bulge bother and Surbhi has managed to shed all the weight she gained. I feel much better now as I have regained my original weight, she smiles.

 Though Surbhi does not follow a strict diet, she sticks to small portions. I have drawn up my own diet chart and it suits me fine.

 Breakfast consists of a cup of tea, two or three wholewheat slices of toast with honey or low-fat cheese spread. Post exercise, she downs a protein shake or buttermilk.

 For lunch, she has two or three rotis, brown rice, vegetables and dal. I usually combine three or four kinds of atta, including jowar and bajra. This is to ensure that my meal contains high-fibre foods, explains Surbhi.

 Though a vegetarian, she eats eggs occasionally. Evenings are time for some tea combined with light bites like upma. Dinner is wholewheat pasta.

 Surbhis exercise regimen lasts for about 90 minutes in the morning. I go to the gym five days a week. Sometimes I drop in on Sundays too.

 She packs in half-an-hour of cardio and one hour of weight training.

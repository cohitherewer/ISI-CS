 REVIEW

 Whats new?

 Dhol is about a group of four wastrels wanting to get rich, the easy way. Just like Dhamaal. Dhol is about four friends who are ready to do just about anything to catch the eye of a girl. Just like Golmaal. And a lot of Dhol is about the four getting into the stickiest of situations. Just like Heyy Babyy.

 A sense of deja vu pervades the entire two-and-a-half hours of this Priyadarshan film with the plot, the comic sequences, the gags and even the dialogues of Dhol a throwback to some film or the other. Toss in a murder subplot and an unnecessarily long-drawn-out flashback sequence and what could have been a fun-filled timepass joyride ends up being a big bore. The comic sequences in the film do manage to elicit a decent amount of laughter, but for Dhol, Priyadarshan borrows heavily from most of his earlier films, with even the climax being a combination of Hera Pheri, Hungama and Bhagam Bhag. Theres even a sequence where after the murder of a gang of goons at a railway station, a dancer comes slithering out of a train and starts shaking her hips in the middle of the melee. Bizarre!

 What saves Dhol from degenerating into a farce are the performances by its four leading actors. Tusshar Kapoor and Sharman Joshi fit the bill, and after hard-hitting roles in Kalyug and Traffic Signal, Kunal Khemu displays a refreshing comfort level with comedy. But as always, it is Rajpal Yadav who stands out. As the only girl around, one would expect Tanushree Dutta to have a meatier role, but she disappoints. And her dress sense remains as bad as ever. Pritams music doesnt have any high points.

 If youve watched Dhamaal and Golmaal, dont waste your money on Dhol. Watch T20 instead.

 Yo, yaar!

 Not going overboard with either American Desis or Americans on Desis, Loins of Punjab Presents by Manish Acharya is good fun. The wannabe-Bollywood spirit among the ABCDs (American Born Confused Desis) is the driver of this smart 88-minute film that steers clear of excess.

 A horny event manager (Jameel Khan) ropes in the largest supplier of pork loins, Loins of Punjab, to host a Desi Idol contest. Enter, a bunch of random wannabes. A bitchy socialite Rrita Kapoor (Shabana Azmi), with a double r of course; Turbanotorious B.D.G (Ajay Naidu) the rapper who thinks he is the f-ing greatest (and so does his gay partner) and sings Khoon Kharaba the chick (Seema Rehmani) who feels Bollywood is the place to be, and though she cant understand Hindi she pretends she knows it all.

 There is the really good 19-year-old singer (Ishitta Sharma) who has her entire Patel family out there, with words of encouragement written all over their T-shirts, and theres an analyst (Manish Acharya himself), whose job has been outsourced to India and who is still out there analysing his chances of winning. Finally, you have the white guy (Michael Raimondi), in love with India and an Indian (Ayesha Dharker), who sings Jana gana mana to perfection. The bitchy and the powerful try every trick in the trade but alls well that ends well. As the crooked event manager sums up: We may be brown but we are very fair.

 Writer-director Manish Acharyas comments on the ABCDs and other serious issues related to Indians in America are kept deliberately muted. The film works through its scenes, dialogues, characters and performances.

 As the Patels put it Tip-top, wall-to-wall fun.

 MADHUPARNA DAS

 Desert Rose 

 Jack Nicholson got his nose slashed in Chinatown because his Jake Gittes was a very nosy fellow. Abhay Deol gets a gash on his forehead in Manorama because his Satyaveer Randhawa has a phata kopal.

 Navdeep Singhs directorial debut is an intriguing tribute to Roman Polanskis cult noir thriller and not another copy-paste job. Even if he didnt have Abhay watching a scene from Chinatown on TV, those who have seen the original would know where the difference lies. Just like in Zinda, where Sanjay Gupta conveniently bypassed the incest angle when copying the Korean film Old Boy, Navdeep keeps stressing the mother plot to stay away from Chinatowns shes my sister and my daughter premise. And it is there, in that last half-an-hour, when things tumble out of the box, that he loses grip on what till then was a fine piece of old-school film-making.

 Satyaveer aka SV (Abhay) is a failed writer who hasnt kept a single copy of his only detective novel Manorama even though only 200 of them have ever been sold. One of them is read by Manorama (Sarika) who finds enough in the pages to appoint SV as a private eye to follow her husband (irrigation minister Rathore played by Kulbhushan Kharbanda) and freeze-frame him in compromising positions.

 Before you know it she is dead and SV, still recovering from his second honeymoon romp with his wife (Gul), is in the middle of his first case. Add his malpua-eating saala sub-inspector Brijmohan (Vinay) and Manoramas fishy roommate Sheetal (Raima) to the proceedings and the small desert town of Lakhot in Rajasthan comes alive.

 But then what you see is not what you get. Staying true to the genre, Navdeep spins his yarn like a veteran, sprinkling clues and characters judiciously. Well-paced, superbly shot and laced with sharp dialogues, Manorama is quite a watch till the backstories start getting too heavy and do not stack up on closer scrutiny.

 Each member of the ensemble cast, including the two goons who keep roughing up SV is well cast. Effectively controlled, Abhay shows great potential as the reluctant sleuth who gets dragged into a bloody mess. Gul Panag is quite brilliant. Playing the sloppiest of characters, that of the nagging wife, she mixes warmth and humour. And yes, she and Abhay share what must be the most passionate Bollywood screen kiss in a long time. Another high point is the extended Raima-Abhay interplay across the aquarium. Vinay Pathak is, as usual, infectious.

 You may have to dig six feet under to rearrange the storyline chronologically but even then Manorama is recommended.

 Mundane menu

 Somethings cooking this summer a plateful of bogged down Catherine Zeta-Jones served with a dash of uninspired Aaron Eckhart, finished with a twirl of the lively Abigail Breslin, and what do you get? A movie so mundane that it rather stressfully redefines the word mediocre (despite Breslin) and leaves a bitter aftertaste.

 A master chef at a posh Manhattan restaurant, with too many rules and even more problems, Kate (Zeta-Jones) is unbelievably dictatorial in the kitchen even more than Amitabh Bachchan in Cheeni Kum and is so on the edge that her boss signs her up for therapy (instead of showing her the door).

 Kates world goes into a spin when sister (Arija Bareikis) meets with an accident and dies, leaving behind her nine-year old daughter (Breslin) with her. While she is found vacillating between being the head cook and a dedicated yet utterly confused caregiver for her niece (though she never quite establishes the character as either), her boss hires a new chef (Eckhart) and she feels threatened. With his unconventional ways in the kitchen, including listening to opera while cooking, he is quickly accepted and loved by all.

 Then the inevitable happens and the new chef gets all knotted up with Kate.

 No Reservations is dull from start to finish and director Scott Hicks should accept responsibility. 

 Zeta-Jones is seen labouring here, relying on her previously established persona rather than any discernible acting ability. Eckhart, who looks prettier than the ageing Zeta-Jones, too has a hard time convincing us that his character is capable of sweeping away the always upright and uptight head chef (save for a few poses in which he flashes that sexy smile).

 Breslin alone brings a little sunshine into the otherwise rather dreary attempt right out of the cliched Hollywood assembly line.

 On the run 

 Jaw clenched, brow knotted, body tight as a secret, Matt Damon hurtles through The Bourne Ultimatum like a missile. Hes a man on a mission, our Matt, and so too is his character, Jason Bourne, the near-mystically enhanced superspy who, after losing his memory and all sense of self, has come to realise that he has also lost part of his soul. For Bourne, who rises and rises again in this fantastically kinetic, propulsive film, resurrection is the name of the game, just as it is for franchises. This is the passion of Jason Bourne, with a bullet.

 The three Bourne movies drill into your psyche and your body. You dont just feel Bournes hurt, you feel the hurt of everyone he kills.

 The Bourne Ultimatum picks up where The Bourne Supremacy left off, with this former black-bag specialist for the C.I.A. grimly, inexorably moving toward final resolution. After a brush with happiness with the German woman (Franka Potente) he met in the first movie (The Bourne Identity) and lost in the second, he has landed in London. Stripped of his identity, his country and love, Bourne is now very much a man alone. Damon makes him haunted, brooding and dark. He looks like death in more ways than one.

 Death becomes the Bourne series, which, in contrast to most big-studio action movies, insists that we pay attention and respect to all the flying, back-flipping and failing bodies. Theres no shortage of pop pleasure here, but the fun of these films never comes from watching men die.

 Paul Greengrass keeps the pace going relentlessly, without mercy or let-up, scene after hard-rocking scene. Without fail, he picks up the pieces, reshaping them so that Bourne can move to the next location, the next kill, as he gets closer and closer to the mystery of his terrible existence. But he also wants to complicate things, mix some unease in with all the heart-thumping enjoyment. Because the Bourne series is, finally, about consequences, about chickens coming home to roost.

 The Bourne Ultimatum drives its points home forcefully, making you jump in your seat and twitch, but its careful not to leave any bruises.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Entertainment

 Globe trotter

 Trendy traveller: Priyanka Chopra

 What: Launch of the MakeMyTrip office in Calcutta.

 Where: Ideal Plaza, Sarat Bose Road.

 When: August 23.

 Travel talk: Online travel site MakeMyTrip (MMT) has opened its first Calcutta office. Launched in 2000, MMT already has offices in Gurgaon, Ahmedabad, Delhi, Bangalore and New York. 

 Customers can now drop into the office for greater flexibility and customised itinerary, while buying the best international and domestic holiday deals. Referring to Calcutta as the most cultured city in the country and the most travel-loving city, founder and CEO Deep Kalra threw light on how travel and tourism is slowly but surely going virtual. Today one-third of all air tickets are bought online, said Deep. He also spoke about the Long Tail phenomenon, where buyers come from smaller towns. Their alternatives are even fewer and quality is so poor that Internet is the best option, he explained.

 Voiceover: What attracts the customer is a lot of user content like photographs. One can even map the hotel in a city. Moreover, we promote a safe transaction environment where no credit card details are stored. Our investment in full service walk-in offices is a step towards innovation, said Deep.

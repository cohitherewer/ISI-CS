 Ranjana amp; him

The man who wooed Bela Bose on the phone is poised for a comeback after seven years. Singer-songwriter-filmmaker Anjan Dutt riding the success of The Bong Connection and Bow Barracks Forever is now ready with his new album Aami Aar Godot. This time, he has son Neel for company.

 I felt it was pointless to record more albums unless I had something different to offer in terms of sound and lyrics. An offer for Neel and me to work together on an album sounded interesting, says Dutt. 

 Aami Aar Godot meaning Dutt and Neel (Godot is his petname) is a work of contemporary meanings and sounds. Both father and son will sing their individual compositions; the songs will reflect their differing views on life.

 My songs are unabashedly about what I am today. Im concerned about tiredness, death and life afterwards. It may sound philosophical but its neither spiritual nor a lament. I cant take the same interest in a Bela Bose as I did previously. It isnt sensuality in a woman that attracts me today but other qualities like compassion that have a greater appeal, explains Dutt. 

 Dutt will, however, resurrect Ranjana, a character he had created through a rock--roll number, in his forthcoming album. Its a contemporary take on the old song. Now when I sing Ranjana aami aar ashbo na its not because of the parar dadas but because she is no longer the same Ranjana. Shes just a faceless name glued to the computer, bonding with strangers on the Internet, says Dutt, contradicting his sons composition Jaanla.

 Jaanla for me is the computer window which I feel is a window to a persons soul. In a way it is a love song, says Neel.

 In another one of his songs Dutt pays tribute to cinema that he defines as life, flesh and person and brings to light a surprise character he reveals at the end.

 While Neels compositions are a mix of Indian and western strains with sounds of the bongo, distortion guitar and Indian classical fusion, Dutt offers a light and mellowed bluesy sound. My songs are more Simon Garfunkel or Lobo-like with a live acoustic feel, says Neel. His father adds: Mine are warm and old-fashioned like Dylan or Cohen.

 The title track composed by Dutt features father and son. They have also sung together a contemporary version of a popular Rabindrasangeet. The duo has teamed up with the old line-up of Gyan Singh on bass and Amyt Dutta on guitar. 

 The album is slated for an end-September release under the Saregama label.

 Chinas green plans released

 JIM YARDLEY

 Beijing, June 4: China today released its first comprehensive strategy on addressing climate change, a plan that calls for improving energy efficiency and controlling greenhouse gas emissions but that rejects mandatory caps on emissions that could harm the countrys sizzling economy.

 Our general stance is that China will not commit to any quantified emissions reduction targets, but that does not mean we will not assume responsibilities in responding to climate change, said Ma Kai, head of Chinas powerful economic planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission. The 62-page report unveiled by Ma is dense with figures and programmes on subjects like reforestation, public education and improving regulatory enforcement. 

 But, in broad terms, the plan merely restated Beijings position that mandatory emissions caps are unfair to China and other developing countries that are still trying to modernise and improve their living standards. China has the worlds fastest-growing major economy and had been projected to surpass the US by 2009 or 2010 as the worlds biggest emitter of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. 

 At his news conference today, 

 Ma applauded President Bushs proposal but said that 

 it should complement, not replace, the existing framework, 

 including the 1997 Kyoto Protocol sponsored by the UN. Under 

 the Kyoto Protocol, industrialised nations are subjected 

 to caps on certain industrial emissions, while developing 

 countries, including China and India, are exempt.

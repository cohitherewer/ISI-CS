 Wolfowitz admits helping aide

 Wolfowitz

 Washington, April 9 (Reuters): World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz said today he accepted full responsibility for the promotion of a staffer with whom he is romantically involved.

 The banks staff association last week questioned Shaha Rizas promotion and pay increases, and the banks board said on Friday they would look into whether the actions possibly violated the banks staff rules.

 Wolfowitz told the banks staff in an email that he would ensure the board has access to the facts in the case in a manner that also respects the banks rules concerning the right of every staff member to the confidentiality of his or her records.

 He said he accepted full responsibility for the actions taken in this case and that he had always acted to uphold bank rules on employee rights and treatment.

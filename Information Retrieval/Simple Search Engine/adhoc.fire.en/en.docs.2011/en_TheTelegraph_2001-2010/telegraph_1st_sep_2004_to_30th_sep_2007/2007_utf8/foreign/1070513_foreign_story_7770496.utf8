 Gibson relief

 Los Angeles, May 12 (Reuters): Actor Mel Gibson got a thumbs up today from a judge overseeing the alcohol rehab programme he was ordered to take after a drunken anti-Semitic outburst at police last year.

 I truly believe the rehabilitation (in) this case is effective, and I dont want to do anything to interrupt that, said Malibu superior court judge Lawrence J. Mira, explaining why the actor was not asked to appear for yesterdays hearing. I know his extensive participation in a self-help programme and I should note he has done extensive work, beyond which was required, Mira added.

 Gibson, 51, was arrested in Malibu, California, on suspicion of drunken driving last July, and he caused a furore by launching into a tirade against Jews, saying they were responsible for all the wars in the world.

 Turtle trips

 New York (AP): A determined turtle crawled up a flight of stairs and trudged towards Central Parks ice skating rink in an apparent urge to lay eggs near the rink, park officials said. The 9-kg snapping turtle turned up near the Wollman Rink three times on Friday. The reptile was returned each time to a nearby pond, sometimes in a wheelbarrow. Turtles are a common sight in Central Park.

 Scotty trek

 White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico (AP): A rocket payload carrying the ashes of actor James Doohan Scotty on Star Trek and astronaut Gordon Cooper should be recovered within a week from a remote New Mexico mountain range, the launch company said. UP Aerospace Inc. president Jerry Larson said recovery crews can

 get no closer than 400 meters to the payload because it landed in rocky, steep terrain in the San Andres Mountains. Its on top of the mountain, Larson said on Friday. The only way to get in there is by helicopter. But once we spot it, getting it out is the easy part.

 Ewan wage

 London (AP): Actor Ewan McGregor may earn millions making movies, but he has decided to perform on the London stage for a minimum wage. The 36-year-old star, known for Hollywood roles such as Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Star Wars films, will earn 400 ($790) a week standard minimum wage for actors in Britain playing Shakespeares arch villain Iago in Othello, a spokeswoman said on Saturday. McGregor was recruited for the role by Donmar Warehouses artistic director.

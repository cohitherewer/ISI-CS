 Khaleda to fight charges at home, says aide

 Dhaka, April 21 (Reuters): Bangladeshs former Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia, under government pressure to go into exile, wants to fight any charges brought against her at home, a close aide said.

 Khaleda and bitter rival Sheikh Hasina, also a former Premier, have been hounded by the army-backed interim authority in a crackdown on corruption that has so far netted more than 160 senior politicians. Hasina, who faces charges of extortion and murder at home, has effectively been barred from returning to Bangladesh after making a private visit to the US. She is presently in London.

 Former army brigadier Hannan Shah, a former minister and a member of Khaledas Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), met Khaleda late yesterday in Dhaka. She is not going into exile but trying to restructure the party, Shah said. The chief strongly opposes going abroad. She would rather face the law within this country, if it comes to her.

 BNP insiders said the government was maintaining pressure on Khaleda to leave the country with younger son Arafat Rahman. They said she had been told travel documents were ready for her family to board a plane to Saudi Arabia. Hasinas spokesman said she would make another attempt to board a flight to Bangladesh tomorrow.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 After US sanctions, India wakes up

 JYOTI MALHOTRA

 New Delhi, Sept. 26: For a full month, as Myanmars monks participated in a peaceful pro-democracy movement against the military junta which climaxed in an army crackdown today, India kept very quiet. 

 But within 24 hours of President Bush announcing sanctions against Yangon, Delhi issued a statement saying that the government was concerned and (was) monitoring the situation in Myanmar. It is our hope that all sides will resolve their issues peacefully through dialogue. India has always believed that Myanmars process of political reform and national reconciliation should be more inclusive and broad-based .

 The statement hid the governments nervousness over whether this was the beginning of the end of Myanmars military regime. For more than a decade, Delhi has ignored the covert pro-democracy movement in Myanmar, believing that it was wise to be pragmatic. 

 Chinas influence in Myanmar, in fact, persuaded India to woo the generals and lay out the red carpet each time one of them visited here.

 Govt asks ex-PMs to come clean on wealth

 Under pressure

 Dhaka, July 18 (Reuters): Bangladeshs anti-corruption commission said it had asked two former Prime Ministers to submit statements of their wealth, as part of a crackdown on corruption by politicians.

 A notice seeking the statement was sent to Sheikh Hasina, now in jail for alleged extortion, through prison authorities, commission officials said today. Another notice was served to her rival Begum Khaleda Zia, also aformer Prime, at her home in Dhaka yesterday, they said. Both leaders have been given a week to submit the statements.

 Police arrested Hasina, chief of the Awami League, at her home in the capital on Monday and a city court jailed her the same day.

 The countrys army-backed interim government, which took charge in January, had previously restricted the movements of both leaders, keeping them confined to their homes.

 Hasinas arrest sparked speculation that Khaleda, who is also accused of extortion and abuse of power, might be put behind bars soon.

 Khaleda, who heads the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, and Hasina have denied the charges, saying they were politically motivated and designed to force them out of politics. They blame the caretaker authority as well as reformists in their own parties, who want Khaleda and Hasina ousted from top party posts.

 The commission today said it was sending notices to another 20 political and business leaders, including detained Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil, for them to declare their wealth.

 A court today ordered a 7-day remand for Giasuddin Al Mamun, a businessman and friend of Tarique Rehman, Khaledas eldest son, allowing police to interrogate him further on corruption charges. Police earlier took Mamun into remand several times. Anti-corruption officials said they had found Taka 630 million ($9.13 million) with Mamun. 

 The interim government headed by former central bank chief Fakhruddin Ahmed says parliamentary elections will be held before the end of next year, after completing the anti-corruption drive and implementing a series of electoral reforms to make the vote free and credible.

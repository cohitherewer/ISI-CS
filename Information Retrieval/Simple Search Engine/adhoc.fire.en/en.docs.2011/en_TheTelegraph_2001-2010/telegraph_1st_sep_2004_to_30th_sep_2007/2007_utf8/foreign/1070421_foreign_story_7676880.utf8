 Putin stops removal of icons from victory flag

 Moscow, April 20 (Reuters): Russian President Vladimir Putin intervened today to stop his own supporters removing the communist hammer and sickle from one of the most hallowed relics of the countrys history.

 A draft law passed by the pro-Kremlin lower house of parliament and put on Putins desk for approval stripped the hammer and sickle device from copies of the Victory Banner.

 The banner was the flag that Soviet troops raised over Berlins Reichstag building on May 1, 1945, official histories say, an act caught in an iconic photograph and which came to define the victory over Nazi Germany. Those wanting to remove the hammer and sickle from the flags that festoon Russian towns for May 9 Victory Day celebrations said it was out of date.

 Lower house speaker Boris Gryzlov, whose pro-Kremlin United Russia party initiated the law, met Putin and veterans representatives and announced a climbdown: the hammer and sickle would stay.

 The Kremlin later said Putin formally vetoed the bill and sent it back to parliament.

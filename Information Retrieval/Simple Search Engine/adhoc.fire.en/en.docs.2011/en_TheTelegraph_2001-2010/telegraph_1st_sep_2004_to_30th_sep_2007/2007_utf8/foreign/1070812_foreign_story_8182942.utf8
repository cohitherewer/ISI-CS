 World issues over a casual meal

 Kennebunkport (Maine), Aug. 11 (AP): President George W. Bush welcomed French President Nicolas Sarkozy today for a heart-to-heart talk on world issues and to repair relations with France.

 We have had disagreements on Iraq in particular, Bush said as the French President arrived at the seaside vacation home of Bushs parents. But Ive never allowed disagreements to not find other ways to work together.

 The White House billed the event as a casual meal between two leaders just getting to know each other.

 But Bush said the two would also talk for 45 minutes on world issues, including Iran, where he wants Sarkozys aid in halting Irans pursuit of a nuclear weapon.

 Well have a heart-to-heart talk, Bush said. Well be talking about a lot of key issues. The good thing about President Sarkozy is you know where he stands. He can tell you exactly what he thinks. I hope hed say the same thing about me.

 The French President had his own warm words, part of an overt attempt by the leaders of both countries to warm their nations chilled relations. Sarkozy called the US a long-time friend, one he admires for trying to spread freedom around the world.

 Do we agree on everything? No, he said, an apparent reference to the divisive Iraq war. Because even in family, there are disagreements. But we are still the same family.

 Sarkozy arrived alone on a sparkling day. His wife, Cecilia, cancelled at the last meeting because she and her kids were sick. She informed First Lady Laura Bush in a phone call, and President Bush said the family understood. Sarkozy said they had sore throats.

 By welcoming Sarkozy to his parents seaside home, Bush is laying a foundation for what he hopes are drastically improved relations with France over the rest of his term. 

 In turn, the newly elected Sarkozy is eager to bond with Bush and display a pro-American mind-set.

 Fine Print

 Under cover

 Pullman (Washington), March 27 (AP): A Washington state man was charged with theft and burglary after police said they found 42 kg of womens panties, brassieres and other underwear at his home.

 Investigators believe Garth M. Flaherty, 24, took as many as 1,500 undergarments from apartment complex laundry rooms before he was caught, the police said. They found enough underwear in his bedroom to fill five garbage bags, Tennant said. He said he had a problem. 

 Late ticket

 Waukesha, Wisconsin (AP): A

 $1 parking ticket from 1980 has been paid

 off, after the offender sent the payment along

 with a $3 (euro2.26) late fee to police without giving a name. Its kind of cool that someone took the time to take care of their obligation after 26 years, the

 police told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel for

 a story posted online Monday. Maybe

 their conscience got to them.

 Edge miss

 Los Angeles (AP): The Edge is donating his favourite instrument to an auction benefiting Music Rising, a charity the U2 guitarist co-founded to replace musical equipment lost or destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. He has logged thousands of hours of stage and studio time on the 1975 Gibson Les Paul. The 45-year-old musician has used the guitar throughout his years with U2. I wanted to give something really significant that would really mean a lot for me to give. It deserved something that I would miss, The Edge said.

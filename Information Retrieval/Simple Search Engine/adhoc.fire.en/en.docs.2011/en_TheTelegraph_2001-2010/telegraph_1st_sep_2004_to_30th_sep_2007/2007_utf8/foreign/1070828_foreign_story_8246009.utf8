 Pervez sends team for Benazir talks

 Islamabad, Aug. 27 (Reuters): Pakistans embattled President Pervez Musharraf has sent representatives to London to negotiate with former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on a power-sharing pact, a government official said.

 Pakistan is facing weeks of uncertainty and the risk of turmoil as Musharraf prepares to secure another term as President while his opponents vow to end military rule.

 In a blow to Musharraf, a junior minister resigned from the cabinet, saying he objected to the Presidents plan to seek another term while remaining army chief.

 Minister of state for information technology Ishaq Khan Khakwani said he was resigning because of Musharrafs plan but would vote for him if he stepped down as army chief.

 We are in contact with Benazir Bhutto, thats true, said information minister Mohammad Ali Durrani, referring to newspaper reports that three senior Musharraf confidants were in London for talks. He declined to elaborate.

 Musharraf met self-exiled Bhutto in Abu Dhabi last month. Liberal-minded Bhutto is seen as a natural ally of Musharrafs who promotes a vision of enlightened moderation.

 Her Pakistan Peoples Party is generally seen as the countrys most popular party, and a pact with her would broaden Musharrafs support base. But Bhutto, has said any deal would depend on Musharraf taking confidence-building steps by the end of August.

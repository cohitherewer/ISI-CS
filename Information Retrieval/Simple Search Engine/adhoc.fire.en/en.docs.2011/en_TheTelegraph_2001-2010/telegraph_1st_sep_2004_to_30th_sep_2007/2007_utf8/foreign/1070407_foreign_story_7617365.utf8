 Solution to Korea fund row found

 Washington, April 6 (Reuters): The US has found a way to transfer frozen funds to North Korea and US negotiator Chris Hill will leave for the region on Sunday to refocus attention on denuclearisation.

 State department spokesman Sean McCormack said the US supported the release of the entire $25 million in funds held at Banco Delta Asia in Macau. 

 We have consulted the interested parties and assured them that there is a potential solution that is consistent with international banking laws, said McCormack. A US treasury department spokeswoman was more circumspect about the arrangements for a transfer, saying that North Korean parties needed to ensure the funds would be used for humanitarian purposes. 

 It was not immediately clear whether the other parties involved in the dispute were of the same view.

 Climate meet focus on cost

 Bangkok, April 29 (AP): The costs of cutting greenhouse gases and who will pay for it are likely to be the key issues at a major climate change meeting of scientists and diplomats in the Thai capital this week, participants said today.

 Some of the worlds biggest greenhouse gas emitters like the US and Australia and top oil exporters such as Saudi Arabia will try to water down language in a draft report that suggests reducing emissions could cost less than 3 per cent of annual global economic activity, environmental activists said.

 Much can be done in the near future to cut greenhouse gas emissions, such as investing in energy efficiency and reforming the agriculture sector, the head of the worlds top climate change agency the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said today.

 I think there are a lot of things doable in the short term, R.K. Pachauri said. Whether the world agrees will depend on what they see as cost of the alternative, which is doing nothing.

 Environmentalists say the price of keeping the status quo far outweighs the cost of tackling global climate change now.

 Cost will be on everybodys mind, said environmental protection group WWF Internationals Martin Hiller of the five-day meeting that starts tomorrow in Bangkok. Changing the energy system is costly but we can still afford to do it. The cost for doing nothing is staggering and could be up to 20 times more expensive.

 Michel Petit, a member of the French delegation, said he feared some countries including Saudi Arabia, China, and the US will say the costs of near-term action are greater than the report suggests, and the moves it proposes to reduce emissions would be hard to implement.

 Some countries may challenge these figures, said Petit. Some countries always put forward the argument that it is very difficult and expensive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

 The IPCC, a network of more than 2,000 scientists, will finalise the report on how the world can mitigate rising levels of carbon dioxide, methane and other heat-trapping gases.

 The draft report, which will be amended following comments from dozens of governments, says emissions can be cut below current levels if the world shifts away from carbon-heavy fuels like coal.

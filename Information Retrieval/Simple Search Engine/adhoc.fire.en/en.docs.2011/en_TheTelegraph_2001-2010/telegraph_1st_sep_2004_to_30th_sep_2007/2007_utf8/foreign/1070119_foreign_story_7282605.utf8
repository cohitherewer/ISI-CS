 Black cool, so are blue, green

 Milan, Jan. 18 (Reuters): Black was cool on Monday, but yesterday Giorgio Armani went for midnight blue, dark green and rich purple velvets in his menswear show.

 Theres not much black today, its true, said the designer, who stated Black is cool after his Emporio Armani show on Monday aimed at younger men.

 But he said: Black is a common denominator. I wear black trousers with a different hued jacket. Black is reassuring, so it will keep being cool.

 Armani did two performances of his Giorgio Armani show yesterday, the only designer to do a repeat show this week, in a huge grey brick, metal and glass space just off Milans trendy canal district.

 Diagonally fastening jackets in imperial hues were worn over straight-legged velvet trousers that swung loose or were tucked into mid-calf leather boots. Velvet was used for shirts too, mostly worn with wool jackets and trousers. 

 Models walked down a black polished glass catwalk to a broadly disco beat and confounded the audience by taking the exit door instead of turning back at the end of the catwalk. For the evening, they wore sky blue shirts buttoned up to the collar without ties under velvet again, this time teamed with petrol blue shiny shoes.

 Armanis soft, sleek clothes were reflected in a gentler look to his models with longer hair and just-woken faces than the line-up of sharp-featured young boys at other shows this week.

 The 72-year-old designer, ended his show with evening wear modelled by Spanish bullfighter Cayetano Rivera and Armanis niece Roberta. Rivera wore a black dinner suit with white shirt and no tie, while Roberta was in an evening dress sheath of chocolate, black and white sparkles.

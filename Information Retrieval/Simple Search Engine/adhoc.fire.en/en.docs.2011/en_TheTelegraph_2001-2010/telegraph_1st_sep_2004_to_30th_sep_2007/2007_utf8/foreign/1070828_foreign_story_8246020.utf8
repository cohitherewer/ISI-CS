 Laura laid low by nerve injury

 Crawford (Texas), Aug. 27 (AP): Laura Bush has cancelled plans to accompany President Bush on next months trip to Australia due to a pinched nerve, her office announced.

 Bush is due to arrive in Sydney on September 4, three days before he participates in the September 7-9 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation annual leaders summit being held there, according to Australian Prime Minister John Howard. Bush is to have bilateral talks with Howard and take part in a state visit to Australia before the start of the summit.

 Lauras press secretary, Sally McDonough, said in a statement yesterday that the First Lady informed Howards wife, Janette, on Saturday by phone that she regrets she will not be coming on the trip.

 Laura injured a nerve in her neck and shoulder earlier this year while hiking and has been treated with physical therapy since, McDonough said. Her doctors have strongly advised her not to travel overseas, saying such long flights could aggravate the problem she added. The President and his wife are spending a few days relaxing out of sight at their Texas ranch.

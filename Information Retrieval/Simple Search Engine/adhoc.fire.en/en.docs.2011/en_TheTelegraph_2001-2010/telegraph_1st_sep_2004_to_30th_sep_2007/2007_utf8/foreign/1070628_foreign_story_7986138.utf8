 Iran fuel rations spark riots

 Tehran, June 27 (Reuters): Angry Iranian motorists queued for fuel for hours today after the worlds fourth-largest oil exporter imposed fuel rationing, sparking chaotic scenes and the torching of at least two pump stations.

 One Iranian news agency, Fars, said 12 fuel stations were set ablaze in Tehran after the governments announcement late yesterday, but only two could be independently confirmed.

 Some drivers had scuffled while waiting to fill up their tanks before the rationing started at midnight. Others openly criticised President Mahmoud Ahmadinejads government, which came to power vowing to share out Irans oil wealth more fairly.

 We are swimming in oil and all they do is just put pressure on people, said taxi driver Hasan Mohammadi.

 Despite its huge energy reserves, Iran lacks refining capacity and must import about 40 per cent of its fuel, a sensitive issue when world powers have threatened new UN sanctions in a row with Tehran over its nuclear programme.

 Seeking to rein in soaring consumption and costly imports, the government on May 22 raised the litre price by 25 percent to 1,000 rials (11 cents) but rationing was delayed.

 Drivers rushed to pump stations after the oil ministry said the scheme would finally go ahead after weeks of confusion.

 One fuel station in Pounak, a poorer area of the capital, was set alight while another in eastern Tehran was partially burnt, two of its pumps destroyed by fire, witnesses said.

 Windows at Pounak were smashed, six pumps wrecked and walls blackened. State radio blamed opportunistic elements.

 Police were not immediately available for comment on the total number of pump stations damaged.

 Last nights riots were an expression of the anger of people with lower incomes, said government employee Saeed Sameti, who said he had queued for five hours.

 Motorists still faced long lines today in a country where many see abundant and cheap fuel as a national right.

 Short of public transport, many rely on their cars or taxis to get around of the sprawling capital of 12 million people.

 I cannot tolerate more economic pressure, said teacher Hasan Sanjari.My monthly salary is $300. I have three sons.

 Some lawmakers were drafting a bill to stop rationing, Irna news agency said, without saying how much support they had.

 Parliament had argued for offering fuel above the rationed amount at market prices, a step opposed by the government which fears this would stoke inflation, already at 17 per cent.

 No announcement was made yesterday about whether drivers could buy extra fuel. An oil official said the government was being deliberately ambiguous to see how rationing worked, but economists said inflation would be affected whatever happened.

 Either they are going to offer (extra fuel) at a high price or there is going to be black market at a high price, said Hatef Haeri, head of business consultancy ICG.

 But he said Iran had no choice but to curb consumption because of the burden on state coffers. 

 All fuel, whether imported or domestically produced, is sold at heavily subsidised prices, encouraging waste and smuggling.

 Private cars will get 100 litres of fuel a month but less if they also burn compressed natural gas, state TV said.

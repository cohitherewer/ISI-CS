 Nepal panel for poll delay

 J. HEMANTH 

 Kathmandu, April 13: The Nepal peace process received a severe jolt today after the election commission announced that it would be unable to hold polls to the Constituent Assembly on June 20. 

 Chief election commissioner Bhoj Raj Pokharel said the commission had sent a formal letter to the government this morning. 

 The letter states that if elections are to be held by mid-June, the offices of the poll officials must be set up by the third week of April. However, since tasks like updating the voters list and registering of political parties cannot be completed before mid-May, it would be impossible to hold the election within the stipulated time.

 Pokharel said it normally takes 110 days to prepare for the elections. 

 He added that the entire poll process would be affected if the government failed to address all political issues related to the elections.

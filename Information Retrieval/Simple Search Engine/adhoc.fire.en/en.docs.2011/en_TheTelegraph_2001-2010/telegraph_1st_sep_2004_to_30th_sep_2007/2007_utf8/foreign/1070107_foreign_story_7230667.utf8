 Second bus attack in 2 days kills 11 in Lanka

 Peraliya (Sri Lanka), Jan. 6 (Reuters): A suspected Tamil Tiger suicide bomber blew up a bus in Sri Lankas south coast resort area today, killing herself and 10 passengers and wounding 50, police said of the second bus attack in as many days.

 The blast near the coastal town of Peraliya, around 70 km south of Colombo where around 1,000 people were killed when their train was swept off its tracks by the 2004 tsunami comes after suspected rebels killed six civilians in a bus blast north of the capital yesterday.

 Analysts fear rebel attacks, which have largely been confined to military and political targets during a new episode in the islands two-decade civil war, may now increasingly target civilians as in earlier stages of a conflict that has killed more than 67,000 people since 1983.

 The blast blew a hole in the back of the bus, which sat on the verge of the islands main road along the south coast, amid tsunami-damaged homes and rudimentary shelters. Glass from the broken bus windows was strewn on the ground.

 Eleven people were killed in the bombing and 50 were wounded, officials said. We think it was a Tiger suicide bomber, chief inspector of police H.M. Edrisuriya said.We have found only a portion of an unidentified woman, who we think was the bomber.

 The LTTE, who say they are fighting for an independent state for minority Tamils, denied they were behind the bus attacks. We have no connection with those incidents, a Tiger spokesman said.

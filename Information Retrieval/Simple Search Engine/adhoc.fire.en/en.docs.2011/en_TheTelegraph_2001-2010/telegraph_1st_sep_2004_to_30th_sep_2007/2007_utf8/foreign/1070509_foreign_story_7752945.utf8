 Clinton: All in a days work

 New York, May 8 (AP): Former US President Bill Clinton has supplied the clues to a crossword puzzle on the website of The New York Times.

 Jim Schachter, deputy editor of the Times magazine, said today that Clinton was given the grid with the letters and asked to provide clues for the words.

 For letit he came up with first two words of a Beatles title.

 The puzzle is part of a special issue on the new middle ages as in baby boomers and several clues poke fun at the boomer generation to which Clinton belongs.

 Clinton today announced deals with two Indian generic drug companies, Cipla and Matrix Laboratories, to cut prices of AIDS treatment for second line anti-retroviral drugs for 66 developing countries, reports Reuters.

 Chaudhry blames judges

 Islamabad, April 17 (PTI): Pakistans suspended Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry accused his fellow judges for hatching a conspiracy against him.

 Chaudhry said he did not see any of Musharrafs aides being involved in his suspension. However, he believed that the action against him was a result of a conspiracy hatched by his colleagues in the supreme court in association with some top officials, a media report said.

 His remarks follow speculation that Musharrafs confidants held talks with the judge to work out a compromise which probably could result in his reinstatement.

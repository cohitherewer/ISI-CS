The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Corporate India optimistic

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mittal

 London, June 27: Corporate India is reasonably optimistic that Gordon Brown as Prime Minister will be as good a friend to India as Tony Blair has been possibly even better. 

 This was the opinion of Sunil Mittal, president of the Confederation of Indian Industry, who is in London with colleagues from Indian industry for talks with their opposite numbers as well senior British government figures just as the changing of the guard is taking place. 

 Tony Blair is a great friend of India, there is no question he will remain so, commented Mittal, speaking not as chief executive of Bharti Enterprises but on behalf of the increasingly influential Indian business world. He will remain so. He is a very popular Prime Minister. 

 On Brown, Mittal recalled his last trip to India when the Chancellor of the Exchequer had addressed a business conference in Bangalore. 

 I chaired the session in Bangalore, the last partnership summit for Gordon Brown, and we were stunned to hear the speech, Mittal recalled. He was all praise for India, all praise about Indias prowess and knowledge-based society and what he said was if (ancient) India could add (invent) a zero and do all the numericals and do basic fundamental research centuries back, India should do very well (now), to do this stuff on the IT and bio-tech. It should be all childs play for India, he said. 

 Browns backing for Indias presence at meetings of the G8 was also appreciated. 

 On the G8 we have never seen even Tony Blair make such a strong statement, added Mittal. I would say its going to be a stepped-up relationship and not a step down. Mittal was backed by Phiroz Vandrevala, who has just taken over as co-chairman, with Lord (Karan) Bilimoria, of the Indo-British Partnership Network. Vandrevala, who is also the executive vice-president of Tata Consultancy Services and a member of the CII council, said: His (Brown) visit (to India) was extremely positive. If you look at something like the G8, every member of the G8 on some occasion said, It would be nice to engage India, it would be nice to have India in the dialogue. What did Gordon Brown say? India must (italics) be a member of G8. It was a clear, categorical statement. We have never had a statement as positive as that. 

 Vandrevala stressed: From our limited interaction and what we have heard from his team and advisers, we believe he will be an extremely friendly prime minister and an extremely pro-active prime minister.

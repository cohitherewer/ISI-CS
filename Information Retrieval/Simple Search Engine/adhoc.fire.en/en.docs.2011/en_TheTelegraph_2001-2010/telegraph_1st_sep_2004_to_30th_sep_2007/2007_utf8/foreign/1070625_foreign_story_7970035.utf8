 Qatar dream, of money amp; escape from Lanka war

 Now 65, this father of four boys and an adopted girl lives in a resettlement colony 25 km from this port town which is under the armys siege for the past year or so. He owns no land, lost his little kiosks as he was tossed around from one camp to another, and is without work. His sons are daily wagers and his foster daughter stacked some savings after working as a maid in Jordan for three years.

 The army searches his tin shack daily. The family doesnt venture out after sundown for fear of being picked up by the soldiers who stand guard at the check-posts the only permanent feature on a deserted landscape.

 The truncated working hours mean reduced earnings, but that doesnt bother the family as long as the dreaded ranuvam (Tamil for army) leaves them alone. As he survives by the hour, Sitravelu has two dreams: We will get our Tamil Eelam (homeland) some day. If the LTTE was not around, not one of us would have lived to tell our tale. 

 The other dream is a more pragmatic one: that his sons will get to Qatar, make some money as security guards and janitors and return to the island for a better life, hopefully.

 In the numerous Tamil camps and resettlements dotting the eastern province of Sri Lanka, now virtually bereft of any original Tamil village, Qatar means more than money. It is a way of escaping from the army and the LTTE, said Mary (an assumed name), who heads a voluntary organisation.

 For the army and the Tigers, always looking to reinforce their strengths, Sitravelus young and thus-far able-bodied sons are cannon fodder. A mother of a boy, on the cusp of adolescence, in a refugee camp near Kantale, 35 km from Trinco, spoke of how afraid she was of her boy sprouting a stubble. They will take him away. Id rather he goes away to Qatar, she sobbed.

 Trincomalee is central to chasing the Qatar dream. For the Tamils of Jaffna, wanting to reach the West Asian Emirate, the first stop is Colombo. In the pre-war era, the journey by road to the Sri Lankan capital would have taken about six hours and cost Rs 500. Today, it takes about three weeks and costs Rs 6,000.

 Elangovan (assumed name), camping in a seedy Trinco lodge for two weeks, explained: Getting an army clearance (to go to Colombo) is tougher than getting a visa. It takes 15 days, if we are lucky. From Trinco, we take a bus to Colombo.

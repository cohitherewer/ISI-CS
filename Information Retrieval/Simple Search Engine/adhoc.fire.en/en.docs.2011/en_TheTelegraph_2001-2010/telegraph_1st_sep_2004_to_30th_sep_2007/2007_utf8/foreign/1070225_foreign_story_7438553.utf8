 The clumsy phrases that you, like, hate

 CHRISTOPHER HOWSE

 London, Feb. 24: Your view: What is the most annoying phrase in the English language?

 Like some Crufts for ugly mongrels, hundreds of linguistic pet hates were sent in by readers yesterday. It started with a criticism by Noel Pepperall on Thursdays Letters page of draw down applied to withdrawal of troops from Iraq. Crufts is the worlds greatest dog show organised by the Kennel Club UK.

 Chief among the breeds you loathe are empty speech-markers, equivalent to er, such as, basically, you know and I mean. Tudor Gwilliam-Rees counted Tony Blair saying Yknow 40 times during a Today radio interview.

 Old clichs like at the end of the day are joined by new clichs, such as no brainer, iconic and inspirational.

 Manners were found to enter into language when shop assistants say things like: No problem, No worries, Cheers, mate or There you go. A reader called Chrissie complained online about a letter from Marks amp; Spencer beginning: Hi, Mrs xxx.

 David Llewellyn confessed online to Your View that he was guilty of saying: Bear with me. It eventually becomes an involuntary reaction, like yawning when somebody else yawns, he wrote.

 Class crept into readers hatreds, as in Eliza Doolittles day (1913). Several readers disliked references to the ground outdoors as the floor. Others shivered at the pronunciation of the name of the letter H as haitch. One pet hate is not verbal at all: a rising intonation at the end of spoken statements, as if they were questions. RW Burchfield, the editor of Fowlers Modern English Usage, some years ago located its origins in antipodean speech. It is now common among the under-thirties.

 Also thriving among the young is the hated syntactic device of using like with a quoted exclamation as the equivalent of an adjective, such as: I was like, Wow! to mean, I was surprised.

 A reader calling himself Ludovic Muggleton, perhaps a pseudonym, was among many to denigrate chill out. Older people are guilty, wrote another reader, if they now start using cool, never having used it in their youth.

 A regular announcement on London Undergound infuriated one traveller: Trains are not stopping at Kings Cross in both directions. Surely, she reasoned, theyre not stopping in either direction.

 Injury seemed to be added to insult when words were misused by politicians. One that made readers extremely cross was refute, used as if it meant reject. Malcolm Hamer wrote from Barnes to ask a less narrowly linguistic question: Why do politicians say they make things absolutely clear, when they dont?

 By the way, Crufts, founded by Charles Cruft, now spells itself without an apostrophe.

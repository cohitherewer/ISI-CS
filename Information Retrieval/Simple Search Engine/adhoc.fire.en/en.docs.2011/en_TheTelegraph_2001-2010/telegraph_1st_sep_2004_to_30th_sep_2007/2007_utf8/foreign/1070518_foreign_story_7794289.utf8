 Google puts all services under one search

 Mountain View (California), May 17 (Reuters): Google Inc. said today it is combining its different Web search services into one Universal Search service that will present websites, news, video and other results on one page.

 The move, a significant overhaul of Googles most-used function, will take effect on Wednesday and be improved over time, executives told reporters at the companys Googleplex headquarters.

 I think of it as a pretty natural evolution, with the one interesting thing being the video side of it, said Martin Pyykkonen, an analyst with Global Crown Capital.

 The thing everyone is wondering right now is what will an advertiser be willing to pay for a video link, Pyykkonen said. From the advertiser standpoint, I think they will be interested in how to hook their customer better.

 Universal Search means that standard Google searches will draw results from separate properties covering books, local information, images, news, and video, said Marissa Mayer, vice-president of search and user experience.

 Its breaking down the silos of information that have been built up. Its a broad, long-term vision that will unfold over the next few years, Mayer said. 

 The combined search includes any site indexed by Googles services. On the video side, for example, it will include YouTube, Google Video and independent sites like Metacafe.com. Mayer did not directly discuss advertising plans, but she indicated the new service could open the door to more relevant ads on search result pages.

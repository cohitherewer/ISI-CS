 Beer in drain

 Kuala Lumpur, May 8 (Reuters): Malaysian customs officials plan to send more than 196,000 cans of smuggled beer gurgling down the drain after confiscating them from a gang that specialised in reselling duty-free drinks to pubs and grocers.

 Officials cannot auction off the beer, worth about 287,000 ringgit ($84,040) with 1 million ringgit ($292,900) owed in unpaid duty and sales tax, because the sale would affect the domestic market, the Star newspaper said today.

 Each of the 8,178 seized cartons was to have been sold for 30 ringgit, or about a third of the market price, a customs official said.

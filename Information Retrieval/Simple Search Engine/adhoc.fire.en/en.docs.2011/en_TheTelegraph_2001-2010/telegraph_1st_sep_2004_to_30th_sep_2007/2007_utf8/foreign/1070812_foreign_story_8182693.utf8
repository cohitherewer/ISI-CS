 Race to claim Arctic seabed

 Toronto, Aug. 11 (AP): Canadas Prime Minister announced plans for an army training centre and a deepwater port on the third day of an Arctic trip meant to assert sovereignty over a region, while Denmark said it was staking its own claim with a scientific expedition.

 The US launched an expedition yesterday towards the Arctic to map the sea floor off Alaska, but a scientist linked to the project denied the US was actively joining the Acrtic competition.

 The race to secure subsurface rights to the Arctic seabed heated up when Russia sent two small submarines to plant a tiny national flag under the North Pole last week. The US and Norway also have competing claims in the vast Arctic region, where a US study suggests as much as 25 per cent of the worlds undiscovered oil and gas could be hidden.

 Prime Minister Stephen Harpers three-day trip to the Canadian Arctic had been planned for months. But it has taken on added significance since the Russian flag-planting, which Canada and the US promptly dismissed as legally meaningless.

 Harper, speaking from the territory of Nunavut, said the new military installations would help back up Canadas claim to the waters and natural resources of the Northwest Passage, which runs below the North Pole from the Atlantic to the Pacific through the Arctic archipelago.

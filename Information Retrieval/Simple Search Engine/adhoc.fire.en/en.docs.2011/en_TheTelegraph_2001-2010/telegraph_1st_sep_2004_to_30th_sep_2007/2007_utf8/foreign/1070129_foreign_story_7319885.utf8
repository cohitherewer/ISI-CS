 Israels first Muslim minister

 Magadla: Voice of Arabs

 Jerusalem, Jan. 28 (Reuters): Israel today appointed its first Muslim cabinet minister, a step he said would help its Arab citizens identify more strongly with the Jewish state.

 The first step has been taken and this has given Israeli Arabs a feeling of belonging, Galeb Magadla told Army Radio after the cabinet ratified his appointment as a minister without portfolio.

 Arabs make up about 20 per cent of Israels population and have long complained of being treated like second-class citizens and about a paucity of government funds for their towns and villages.

 Officials have denied any policy of discrimination against the Arab citizens, saying they enjoyed more political freedom in Israel than in anywhere in the Muslim world.

 Magadla was nominated by the Labour Party for a ministerial post last October.

 In 2001, an Israeli Druze became the first non-Jewish cabinet member, serving as a minister without portfolio.

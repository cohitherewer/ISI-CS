 Bangla poll chief calls for easing meet ban

 Dhaka, Aug. 28 (PTI): Bangladeshs chief election commissioner Shamshul Huda today said the military-backed caretaker government should ease the ban on political activity by the middle of next month even as a retired judge started an investigation into last weeks student protests.

 Huda said he would like to see the ban imposed under emergency rule in January this year lifted or relaxed by September 12 when the commission begins talks with political parties.

 He said talks with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the Awami League and other parties would continue till November 29. The discussions would focus on party registration and electoral codes of conduct.

 Justice Habibur Rahman Khan today began a probe into the student unrest last week that escalated into violent anti-government protests across the country leaving one person dead and over 400 injured. Khan must submit a report on the probe in 15 days. He plans to interview students, teachers, police officers and witnesses.

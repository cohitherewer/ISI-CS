 LOreal faces flak for exaggerated Cruz ad

 London,

 July 25 (Reuters): The advertising watchdog criticised LOreal today for a mascara commercial featuring actress Penelope Cruz that exaggerated the products effects.

 The Advertising Standards Authority said the company broke its rules and misled consumers by failing to make it clear that Cruz was wearing some fake individual lashes.

 In the television commercial for LOreal Paris Telescopic mascara, Cruz stood on a terrace next to a telescope and said: Imagine, lashes that could reach for the stars. The watchdog said the commercial exaggerated the effect that could be achieved by using the mascara on natural lashes.

 It ordered LOreal to make it clear in future adverts if models are wearing fake lashes. The watchdog also criticised LOreals claim of 60 per cent longer lashes. 

 Some people might take that to mean their lashes would actually increase in length, rather than just look longer, the ASA said.

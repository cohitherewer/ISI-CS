 Lebanon war threat to Israel PM chair

Jerusalem, May 2 (Reuters): Israeli foreign minister Tzipi Livni said today she had told Prime Minister Ehud Olmert he should resign and that she wanted to take over as leader of his centrist Kadima party.

 Livnis announcement may be a fatal blow to Olmert as he scrambles to contain the political fallout from a report by a government-appointed commission that blamed him for serious failures in the handling of last years Lebanon war.

 I told the prime minister that I thought to resign was the right thing to do, Livni said after meeting Olmert privately. Now is the time to restore the publics trust in the government.

 Olmert (in picture) has so

 far resisted calls to step down.

 Earlier, Avigdor Yitzhaki, one of parliaments most influential lawmakers, said Olmert had lost the confidence of his centrist Kadima party and of the nation.

 Olmerts faction was expected to hold a meeting later on today to decide how to proceed.

 The political crisis spread further when aides to defence minister Amir Peretz told Israel Radio and Army Radio he was considering stepping down.

 At his first cabinet meeting since the report was released on Monday, Olmert acknowledged personal failings.

 It is primarily incumbent on this government, which is responsible for the failings, to also be responsible for fixing them, he said, adding: I suggest that all those who are in a hurry to take advantage of this report and make political gain slow down.

 Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said he hoped political developments in Israel would not set back efforts to restart peace talks. I hope we will not find ourselves in a vacuum, he said.

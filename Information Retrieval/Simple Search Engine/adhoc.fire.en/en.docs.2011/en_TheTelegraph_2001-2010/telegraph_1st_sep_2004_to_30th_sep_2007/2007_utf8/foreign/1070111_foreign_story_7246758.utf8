 Man who voted for teen Sophia dead

 Carlo Ponti

Rome, Jan. 10 (Reuters): Carlo Ponti, one of Italys best known film producers and the husband of actress Sophia Loren, has died at the age of 94, his family said today.

 In his 50-year career, Ponti produced more than 150 films, including La Strada in 1954, Dr Zhivago in 1965 and Blowup in 1966.

 But he was equally famous for discovering a teenage Loren and turning her into one of the worlds most glamourous stars.

 His death marks the end of an era for film-making because Ponti embodied a great and courageous push to innovate, promoted unforgettable talents and enjoyed huge success, Italian culture minister Francesco Rutelli said.

 Alessandra Mussolini, niece of Loren and grand-daughter of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, said Ponti had been in a Geneva hospital since Christmas. His wife and children were with him. Sophia has always been with him throughout, she said.

 Italys golden couple of the movie industry met in 1952 when Ponti, already an established producer and a married man, cast his vote for a poor 17-year-old girl from a Naples slum in a beauty contest.

 Loren made her name soon afterwards when Ponti, 20 years her senior, gave her a part in a semi-documentary. He then stood back as she became Italys sex symbol, standing in comparison with Brigitte Bardot and Marilyn Monroe.

 In 1957, after unsuccessfully seeking a Vatican annulment of his first marriage Italy then had no divorce laws Ponti married Loren in Mexico. 

 The furore over the affair forced the couple to leave Italy, where he was charged with bigamy. They moved to Hollywood and later had two sons; bitter towards his homeland, Ponti became a French citizen in 1965.

 In his absence, he was sentenced in 1979 by an Italian court to four years in jail and fined $26 million for illegally exporting money. Ponti was cleared of the charges in 1987.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Fine Print

 Barbra back

 Los Angeles, May 30 (Reuters): After cancelling a Rome performance that would have launched an upcoming European tour, Barbra Streisand plans to kick off her first continental concert series in Switzerland, organisers said yesterday.

 Streisand is scheduled to open her eight-city tour with a performance at the Hallenstadion in Zurich on June 18, followed by stops in Vienna, Paris, Berlin, Stockholm, Manchester, Dublin and London.

 The 65-year-old superstar originally planned to launch her European outing with a concert on June 15 at Romes Flaminio Stadium. But organisers dropped the Italian capital from her itinerary last Friday, citing production delays.

 Family high

 Cottonwood Heights, Utah (AP): Three

 generations of the same family, including

 a 72-year-old grandfather, are getting high

 school diplomas. James Nunley, 36, his daughter

 Brittany Wright, 17, and father Jim Nunley,

 72, of the Salt Lake City suburb of Cottonwood

 Heights, are all graduating. Jim Nunley would

 have graduated in 1953 but left school with

 less than a year to go while working in the

 familys paint business. All those years, I kept thinking about it and thought I ought to do something about it, the

 elder Nunley said. Jim Nunley entered a programme

 for adults and his son joined him. James Nunley,

 a truck driver, worked a 10-hour shift, then

 studied history and science each night for

 a month to make up 3.5 credits needed for

 a diploma.

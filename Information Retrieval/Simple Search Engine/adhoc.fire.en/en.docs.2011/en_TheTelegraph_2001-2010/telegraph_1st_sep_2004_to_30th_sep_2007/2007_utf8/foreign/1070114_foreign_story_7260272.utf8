 Isabel Peron arrested in Spain

 Madrid, Jan. 13 (Reuters): Spain yesterday arrested former Argentine President Isabel Peron, who is wanted in her home country for questioning over the killings of Leftist dissidents prior to the 1976-1983 military dictatorship.

 Police arrested Peron, the widow of Argentinas former President Juan Domingo Peron, at her home in the Spanish town of Villanueva de la Canada and a judge later granted her conditional release while a decision is taken on whether or not to extradite her.

 Peron succeeded her husband as President after his death but she struggled to hold onto power as political violence between Leftist guerrillas and anti-communist death squads accelerated. In March 1976, she was ousted in a coup.

 A day before her arrest in Spain, an Argentine judge issued an international warrant for the former leader, whose full name is Maria Estela Martinez de Peron.

 Federal Judge Raul Acosta wants to question her over the 1976 disappearance of a man who rights groups say was last seen being taken into custody by state security officials.

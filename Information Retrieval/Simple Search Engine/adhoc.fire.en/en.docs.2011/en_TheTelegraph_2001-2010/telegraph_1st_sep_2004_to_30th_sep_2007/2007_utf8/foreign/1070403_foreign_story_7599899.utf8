 UK shift softens Iran tone

 Tehran, April 2 (Reuters): Iranian television said today it had detected a shift in British policy that could help to resolve a crisis over 15 sailors and Marines Iran is holding.

 The television channel showed new footage on Monday of the 14 men and a woman, saying they had all admitted to entering Iran illegally when captured in the northern Gulf on March 23.

 Talk of a shift in Britains approach, so far heavily criticised by Iran, marks a softening in Tehrans tone in a crisis that has heightened tensions surrounding Irans nuclear standoff with the West and pushed up oil prices.

 Iran had previously aired confessions from four of the British sailors and marines, footage condemned by Britain which says they were in Iraqi waters when they were seized.

 The latest images showed other members of the group talking to camera but their voices could not be heard.

 In a commentary accompanying the images, the television report said: It seems that Britain has shifted a little bit from its stance in the last one or two days over the undeniable facts and from some of its clamour.

 If this path continues, one can hope that the issue would be resolved in a bilateral process and far away from fuss and clamour and with achieving Irans logical demands.

 The report did not give details of Britains shift in policy. London said yesterday it was in direct communication with Iran. British foreign secretary Margaret Beckett said on Saturday everyone regrets that this position has arisen.

 A British official said work was going on behind the scenes to end the standoff, but did not give details.

 Britains ambassador to Tehran, Geoffrey Adams, has met Iranian foreign ministry officials most days since the crisis started. He was expected to have another meeting today.

 Irans ISNA news agency earlier said Iran had more film of the Britons but details of the interviews would not be shown because of Britains policy shift, which could explain why the new footage was aired in brief snippets without sound.

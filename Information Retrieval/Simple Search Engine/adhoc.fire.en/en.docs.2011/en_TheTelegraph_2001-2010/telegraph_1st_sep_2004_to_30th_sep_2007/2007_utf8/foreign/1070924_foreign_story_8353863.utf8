 Mime artist Marceau dead

 Marceau

 Paris, Sept. 23 (Reuters): Marcel Marceau, the worlds best-known mime artist who for decades moved audiences across the globe without uttering a single word, has died aged 84.

 The Frenchmans extensive tours and appearances on camera brought his silent art to people around the world. His comic and tragic sketches appealed on a universal level, with each audience interpreting his performance in its own way.

 Mime, like music, knows neither borders nor nationalities, he once said. If laughter and tears are the characteristics of humanity, all cultures are steeped in our discipline.

 On stage, he charmed with his deft silent movements, a white-faced figure with a striped jersey and battered top hat.

 Off stage, with the costume and the pancake make-up removed, Marceau was a slim, agile man whose eloquent description and explanation complemented his mute mastery of mime.

 In mime, Marceau said, gestures express the essence of the souls most secret aspirations. To mime the wind, one becomes a tempest. To mime a fish, you throw yourself into the sea.

 The exact cause of his death was not immediately known.

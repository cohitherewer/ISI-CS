The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Prison poser

 Dhaka, June 5 (Reuters): Authorities in Bangladeshs central jail in Dhaka said they were struggling to find room and safety and some special consideration for streams of top politicians and other VIPs detained in an army-led anti-corruption drive.

 Where do we put them? They are mostly VIPs and their comfort and security is a prime concern while they are in prison, said Brigadier-General Zakir Hasan, inspector general of prisons. We are facing tremendous pressure to ensure accommodation and other facilities for the extra flow of high-profile prisoners. The prison was already overfilled before the new stream started coming in, he said.

 The interim government, which took over in January, has vowed to clean up politics from widespread corruption before holding parliamentary elections around the end of 2008.

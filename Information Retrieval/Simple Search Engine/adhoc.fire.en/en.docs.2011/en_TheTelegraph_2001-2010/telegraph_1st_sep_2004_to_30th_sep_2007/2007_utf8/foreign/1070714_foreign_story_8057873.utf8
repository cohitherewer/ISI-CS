 Christies notches up record art sales

 London, July 13 (Reuters): Christies International auction house recorded the largest half-year sales in art market history, boosted by demand from wealthy fund managers and entrepreneurs wanting pieces of modern art, it said today.

 Christies, which has 14 salesrooms around the world including London, New York and Hong Kong, recorded global sales of 1.63 billion for the first six months of 2007, including buyers premium a rise of 32 per cent on last years figure.

 A total of 358 works of art sold for more than one million dollars, compared with 189 auctioned during the same period last year. Never before has interest in art and collectibles been so widespread, said Edward Dolman, chief executive officer at Christies International. 

 The market is being driven by a lot of new buyers including Wall Street hedge fund managers, guys in the City (of London) and Russian oligarchs as well as West Asian and Asian businessmen, he added.

 The most popular works were by post-war and contemporary artists, up 111 per cent at 459 million, and Impressionist and modern artists, up 28 per cent, at 435 million.

 Andy Warhol and Mark Rothko were most in demand with Warhols Green Car Crash (Green Burning Car I) attracting the highest bid at 36 million in New York.

 Dolman said contemporary artists were popular because the new breed of collectors wanted something that says more about them and the society they live in rather than eighteenth-century values.

 They want something that has more relevance to them symbols of the modern world, he said.

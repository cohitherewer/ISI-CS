The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Barclays sends jobs to India

 AMIT ROY 

 London, March 6: Just days after Lloyds TSB disclosed it was shutting down an overflow call centre in Mumbai which had become surplus to requirements, leading to a sense of satisfaction among union leaders, Barclaycard moved today in the opposite direction. The credit card firm said its call centre in Manchester will close in July and its work would be moved to Mumbai and Delhi as well as to Teesside. It put the number of jobs that will be lost in the UK at over 600. 

 Barclaycard said the restructuring will affect 630 workers, who will be paid until October to help them find other jobs. Barclaycards profits fell 40 per cent to 382 million last year, although the Barclays group made more than 7 billion.

 Justifying the move to India, Antony Jenkins, chief executive of Barclaycard, said: Decisions like these are never easy and well be doing everything we can to support those affected. Barclaycards business is becoming more global and to stay successful, we must change how we operate to reflect this. Unfortunately, closing our Peterloo House site in Manchester centre is part of that process. 

 Staff were given the gloomy news today, but told they would be offered support to find other work. Amicus, the white collar union which had applauded Lloyds TSBs decision to redeploy its Mumbai staff, condemned the closure. It said the move was totally inappropriate for such a profitable firm. Steve Pantak, a spokesman for Amicus, said: At a time of increasing pressure on all staff in Barclaycard, we believe it to be totally inappropriate for this large and highly profitable employer to be announcing closures and job losses. We have made our opposition to these moves very clear to the bank. We are, however, continuing to meet with the bank and do have robust agreements in place which will help in finding alternative jobs for those affected elsewhere in Barclays, he added. 

 We believe that with such a large presence in the North West, Barclays should be able to accommodate all staff who are displaced, but wish to remain with them. We will be pushing the bank hard to achieve this outcome, Pantak said.

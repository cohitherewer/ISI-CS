 UK stop- amp;-quiz law

 London, May 27: British police could be given controversial powers to stop and question anyone in the UK under new anti-terror laws, it emerged today.

 The measure so far used only in Northern Ireland is part of a package of reforms being prepared by John Reid, the UK home secretary, who steps down next month.

 Anyone who refuses to co-operate could be charged with obstructing the police and fined up to 5,000, the draft proposals say. At present, officers may stop and search individuals if there are reasonable grounds for suspicion that they have committed an offence, but have no rights to ask for their identity and movements.

 The new powers which would have no reasonable suspicion criteria would help reduce the use of unpopular stop and search powers, according to Tony McNulty, the counter-terrorism minister.

 A less intrusive power of stop and question that could be used by the police in the first instance would be useful. The effect of this power should therefore be to reduce the number of times stop and search is used, he wrote to the UK Prime Minister, in a letter seen by the Sunday Times.

 The proposals have already met with scepticism from Reids colleagues. Peter Hain, the Northern Ireland minister, today said the powers could become the domestic equivalent of Guantanamo Bay.

 Confirmed as PM, Brown to rebuild trust

 London, May 17 (Reuters): Gordon Brown, confirmed today as Britains next Prime Minister, promised a new style of government to rebuild trust in a demoralised and unpopular Labour Party after a decade of Tony Blair.

 But Brown said he was not announcing any shift in Londons relationship with Washington, despite public anger over Blairs unwavering support for President George W. Bush over Iraq.

 I will lead a new government with new priorities, Brown said after Labour named him the sole leadership candidate. It is about a different type of politics, a more open and honest dialogue.

 He pledged to restore public trust in politicians, to listen and learn and to make health and education his top priorities. Today marks the culmination of an agonising 13-year wait for Brown to become Labour leader. 

 Brown inherits a party and a country divided by the Iraq war and disillusioned after a decade of Blair. He will have his work cut out to ensure a fourth straight Labour victory in the next national election due by 2010 at the latest.

 Brown has wasted no time in setting out his vision but the fact that he will not face a vote for the job, not even internally, has been seized on by the Conservatives youthful leader David Cameron who called the transition ludicrous. If Gordon Brown really wants to restore trust, he should give the British people the chance to vote on him in a general election, the Conservatives said.

 Brown was assured a clear run to the premiership after his only potential rival, a Left-wing Labour lawmaker, failed to win enough support from fellow parliamentarians to get on the ballot paper.

 Signs were there but loophole in law

 Richmond (Virginia), April 19 (AP): There were subtle signs that Cho Seung-Hui had problems.

 The 23-year-old South Korean immigrant an outcast by his own account, a bully and a perverted loner by others who took his life and 32 others at Virginia Tech this week had troubled classmates and professors more than a year earlier with his dark writings and brooding.

 He had been kicked out of class, and two women complained to campus police that they had received annoying and unwanted messages from him. Their complaints and an acquaintances concern that Cho was suicidal were enough to get him taken for a psychiatric evaluation.

 But they were not enough to have him committed under Virginia law, one of the most restrictive in the US when it comes to forcing treatment on a person showing signs of mental instability. Mental health experts say his case will heighten a discussion about whether it is time to revise those laws.

 It does raise some questions and a concern about a system that can find someone imminently dangerous and not continue to follow up on them and make sure they are getting the treatment they need, said Mary Zdanowicz, executive director of the Treatment Advocacy Center.

 State law allows involuntary commitment only if a person is determined to pose an imminent danger to himself or others or is substantially unable to care for himself.

 Only Georgia, Hawaii, Montana and Ohio have similar standards, according to the non-profit Treatment Advocacy Center in Arlington, Virginia. Other states do not use the word imminent in conjunction with danger or harm, making it easier to force treatment.

 Retired state police superintendent Colonel W. Gerald Massengill, who was appointed by Governor Timothy M. Kaine to head an investigation into the shootings, said he expects the review will cover mental health issues as well as law enforcement response.

 Mondays shootings also will intensify a state commissions year-old scrutiny of the imminent danger standard, commission members and mental health experts said.

 We certainly welcome any effort to reform our system and make it as helpful as possible for treatment as well as public safety, said James Reinhard, the state mental health commissioner.

 On December 13, 2005, after the second woman complained about Cho, an initial evaluation found probable cause that Cho was a danger to himself or others and a magistrate ordered him evaluated at Carilion St Albans, a private psychiatric hospital.

 The next day, according to court records, doctors at Carilion examined him and Cho denied he was suicidal. An exam showed his insight and judgment are normal, records state. A special justice concluded he was an imminent danger to himself but not to others and approved outpatient treatment.

 Virginia law makes it too difficult to get help for mentally ill people who are incapable of making their own treatment decisions, according to Pete Earley, a member of the state commission.

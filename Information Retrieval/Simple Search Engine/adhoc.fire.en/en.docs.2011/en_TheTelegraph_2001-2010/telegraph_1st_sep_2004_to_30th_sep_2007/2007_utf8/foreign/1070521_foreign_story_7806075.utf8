 Charles wants Camilla as queen

 ANDREW ALDERSON

 Royal partnership 

 London, May 20: Amid the joy of Charles and Camillas wedding announcement, a carefully sounded note of caution suggested that the Duchess of Cornwall would never be queen.

 Clarence House went some way to appeasing critics of the couples previous adulterous relationship by suggesting that the duchess will become princess consort when Charles becomes king.

 Now a television documentary is to claim that the Prince of Wales is, in fact, determined to make his wife queen when he accedes to the throne. It is understood that he is intent on gaining public support so that by the time of his coronation, both will be crowned at Westminster Abbey.

 The programmes claims will infuriate critics of the couple who still feel that because of the once-adulterous nature of the relationship, the duchess should never become queen.

 Under present legislation, she will automatically become queen when Prince Charles, as her husband, becomes king. It would almost certainly require an Act of Parliament for her not to be queen but the prince is said to hope that with the public support on his wifes side by the time of his coronation, this will not be necessary.

 Channel 4, which will show the programme Queen Camilla on May 31, claims that it will reveal the real relationship between the prince and the duchess. They married in April 2005 after an on-off relationship lasting more than 30 years, enduring through Charless marriage to Lady Diana Spencer and Camillas to Andrew Parker Bowles.

 Former royal staff disclose in the programme some of the ruses used by the prince and Camilla to try to keep their relationship secret. It has been alleged in the past that she used to hide in the boot of a car to slip in and out of Highgrove, the princes Gloucestershire home. The documentary contains interviews with friends of the couple, including Lords Carrington and Gowrie, both former senior politicians, and Angela Huth, the writer and broadcaster.

 A Channel 4 source said: The film exposes the campaign to resurrect Camillas reputation and install her as queen beside Charles, and asks whether she offers hope for the future of the British monarchy.

 When the marriage was announced in February 2005, Clarence House explained the title that the then Camilla Parker Bowles would use when her husband becomes king, saying: It is intended that Mrs Parker Bowles should use the title the princess consort.

 Royal aides were being sensitive to widespread public criticism of Camilla, in the light of the couples relationship while both were married to other people. An opinion poll at the time indicated that 65 per cent of people believed the couple should marry, but only seven per cent wanted Camilla to be queen.

 The original statement issued by Clarence House was carefully prepared by Sir Michael Peat, Prince Charless principal private secretary, and Paddy Harverson, his communications secretary. It received the support of the Queen, the Prime Minister and the Archbishop of Canterbury.

 Senior courtiers have indicated to The Sunday Telegraph, however, that it was carefully worded so as not to commit Camilla to her future title. One senior royal official said that ultimately, what she is called is a matter for the government and the prime minister of the day. We will have to consider what people feel at the time.

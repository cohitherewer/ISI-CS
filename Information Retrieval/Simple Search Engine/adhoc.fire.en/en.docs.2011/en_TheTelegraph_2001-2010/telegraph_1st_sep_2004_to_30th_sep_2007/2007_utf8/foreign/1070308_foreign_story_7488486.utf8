The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 US plagiarism

 Boston, March 7 (Reuters): A veteran Boston Globe reporter has been suspended for plagiarising parts of a football column from another publication, the newspaper said yesterday in the latest incident to embarrass the US media.

 The Globe, which is owned by The New York Times Co., said it suspended sports writer Ron Borges for two months without pay because of a football notes column that ran on March 4 about a Seattle Seahawks football player. Globe editor Martin Baron said the column included material from a story published on February 25 by The News Tribune of Tacoma, Washington.

 The Globe does not tolerate plagiarism, Baron said in a report published in the Globe. Extensive passages written by the Tacoma reporter were used verbatim in the column by Borges, and that is prohibited. Borges, a Globe sportswriter for 24 years who was named Massachusetts Sportswriter of the Year four times and is a regular guest on a local sports radio station, was also barred from broadcast appearances over that period.

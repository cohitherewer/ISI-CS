 Fine Print

 Light Drew

 New York, Jan. 6 (AP): Drew Barrymore wants everybody to lighten up.

 You know, its all just humour, the 31-year-old actress says in an interview in the February issue of Harpers Bazaar magazine. Dont take life so seriously. Dont take fashion too seriously. Dont take the movie industry too seriously. Dont take love and your relationship so ... heavy all the time.

 Barrymore, whose screen credits include Charlies Angels: Full Throttle, says times have changed since when she was younger.

 Now if you go out and get trashed at a party on Saturday night and everyone at school knows, I think thats pretty much the equivalent of Us Weekly (magazine), she says.

 Urinal theft

 London (Reuters): British police said on Friday they were hunting a man who stole a urinal from a pub toilet. The suspect walked into the Royal Oak pub in Southampton, on the English south coast, ordered half a pint of beer and then made several visits to the mens toilet. There he carefully removed a white urinal from the wall, stuffed it into a rucksack and was captured on closed circuit television walking out with the bulging sack on his back.

 Game poll

 Abuja, Nigeria (Reuters): The presidential candidate from Nigerias ruling party has challenged his critics to a game of squash to prove he is healthy enough to rule Nigeria. Umaru YarAdua, a reclusive 55-year-old state governor, made his first public comments about his health since the Peoples Democratic Party chose him as its flagbearer for next Aprils elections. I am fit and healthy. I will invite them to a game of squash, he was quoted as saying in Nigerias main newspapers on Friday.

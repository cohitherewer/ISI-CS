 India loses tax case in US court

 Washington, June 14 (AP): The US Supreme Court today sided with New York City in its efforts to collect property tax from the governments of India and Mongolia.

 In a 7-2 decision, the justices said US courts have jurisdiction to decide the dispute. New York City is seeking $16.4 million from India and $2.1 million from Mongolia for their UN missions.

 The city is trying to collect property taxes from nations that house their employees in the same buildings where they operate diplomatic offices.

 The countries have tax exemptions for the diplomatic mission section of the properties, but the city says they must pay taxes for the space that houses employees.

 The 2nd US circuit court of appeals had upheld a federal judges ruling in support of the city. The judge refused to dismiss the lawsuit against the missions of India and Mongolia. They had sought dismissal on sovereign immunity grounds.

 The law does not immunize a foreign sovereign in such circumstances, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote.

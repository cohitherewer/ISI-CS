 Men jailed for online rape plot

 London, Feb. 5 (Reuters): Three paedophiles who planned to rape two young girls they had targeted over the Internet were jailed for a total of 27 years today in what police said was the first case in Britain to use cyber chat as evidence.

 David Beavan, Alan Hedgcock and Robert Mayers used the Internet to put together their conspiracy to kidnap the two girls, aged 13 and 14, take them to woods and rape them.

 Detective constable Dave Adams, from the Metropolitan Polices Child Abuse Investigation Command, said: These three men took a step beyond fantasy and had actually identified the children they would target, the location where they would approach them and what exactly they planned to do to them. 

 It is appalling to consider the potential repercussions if this hadnt come to police notice.

 This is a really significant investigation because for the first time Internet chat logs have been used to prove a charge of conspiracy to rape a child. This case should act as a really stark warning that the Internet is not a hiding place to plan and participate in criminal acts.

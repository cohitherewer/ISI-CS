 Paris will leave jail on Tuesday

 Los Angeles, June 23 (AP): Paris Hilton will leave jail on Tuesday after spending almost three and a half weeks behind bars.

 The release date, announced on Friday, was determined by the Los Angeles county sheriffs departments inmate reception center. 

 Theres no set time, said deputy Luis Castro, adding he did not know if any special arrangements had been made to return Hilton to her Hollywood Hills home.

 The 26-year-old Hilton, who was sentenced to 45 days in jail, surrendered on June 3. Although her sentence was for 45 days, authorities have said all along that with time off for good behaviour and crowded jail conditions, Hilton was likely to serve only 23.

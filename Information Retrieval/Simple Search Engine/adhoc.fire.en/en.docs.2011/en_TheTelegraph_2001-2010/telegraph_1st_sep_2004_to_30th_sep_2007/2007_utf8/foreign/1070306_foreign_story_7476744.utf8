 Kathmandu, March 5: The coalition government headed by Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala today decided to start the process of taking action against 202 individuals, including King Gyanendra, for their role in suppressing last Aprils pro-democracy movement which led to the end of the monarchs absolute rule. 

 A cabinet meeting presided by Koirala today endorsed the recommendations of the high-level Rayamajhi commission which probed the government excesses in April last year. Twenty one people died during the pro-democracy protests. 

 Briefing reporters after the meeting, minister for information and communications Dilendra Prasad Badu said the report would be tabled in parliament soon after completing the necessary formalities.

 The eight parties will be responsible for the action against those indicted by the Rayamajhi commission for suppressing the pro-democracy movement, he said.

 Badu added that instructions have been issued to the relevant authorities to take action against those responsible for the crackdown in April. 

 He said that the government would take action against political figures who were involved in the excesses after the eight parties had decided on what should be done with them.

 The high-level probe commission, headed by former justice of the supreme court Krishna Jung Rayamajhi, had submitted its report in early November last year and recommended the government to take action against 202 individuals, including King Gyanendra, for their role in suppressing the April protests. 

 The commission also asked the government to formulate laws which would allow the government to take action against the king. The current laws have no such provision.

 The cabinet decided to withdraw all charges and arrest warrants against leaders and activists owing allegiance to the Jay Krishna Goit and Jwala Singh-led Janatantrik Terai Mukti Morcha (JTMM) which has launched a violent agitation in the Terai region. 

 The home ministry has been asked to bring the JTMM talks team to the capital to hold discussions with the government, he said.

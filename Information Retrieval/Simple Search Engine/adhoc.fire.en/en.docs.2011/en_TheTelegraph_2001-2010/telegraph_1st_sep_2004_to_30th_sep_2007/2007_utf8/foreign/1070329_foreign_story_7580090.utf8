 Democrats, Bush head for Iraq bill showdown

 Washington, March 28 (AP): Congressional Democrats are showing no signs of backing down on their rebuke of the Iraq war, insisting President George W. Bush will have to accept some sort of US legislative timetable in exchange for the billions of dollars needed to fund the war.

 We would hope that the President understands how serious we are, said Democratic majority leader Harry Reid after the Senate voted to uphold a proposal in a war spending bill calling for the troop withdrawal.

 With the Senate resuming debate on the $122 billion (euro91.41 billion) bill today, Bush reminded lawmakers their move will not prompt him to negotiate but to veto any funding legislation that includes a deadline for withdrawal.

 Members of Congress need to stop making political statements, start providing vital funds for our troops and get a bill to my desk that I can sign into law, Bush was expected to say in a speech at a meeting in Washington.

 Excerpts were released in advance by the White House. If Congress fails to pass a bill to fund our troops on the front lines, the American people will know who to hold responsible.

 But Reid and other Democrats say they will not back down. Rather than making all the threats that he has, lets work with him and see if he can give us some ideas how we can satisfy the wishes of a majority of the Senate, the majority of the House and move forward, Reid said.

 The bill finances operations in Iraq and Afghanistan but requires Bush begin bringing home some combat troops right away with a non-binding goal of ending combat missions as of March 31, 2008. The House of Representatives last week passed a similar bill by a 218-212 vote. That bill orders combat troops out by August 31, 2008 guaranteeing the final spending measure negotiated with the Senate will include some sort of timetable on the war.

 The Senate and House bills will have to be reconciled by negotiators from both chambers before any legislation goes to Bush.

 Senator John McCain, a 2008 Republican presidential aspirant, called the vote in his chamber a very bad decision. McCain, appearing on NBC televisions Today show today said the war was badly mismanaged But there are signs of progress everywhere. ... I am confident that given the opportunity, we can have success.

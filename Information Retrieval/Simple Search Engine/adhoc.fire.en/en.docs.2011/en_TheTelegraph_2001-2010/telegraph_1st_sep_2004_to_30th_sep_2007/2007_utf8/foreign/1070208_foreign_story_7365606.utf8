 Signs of strain

 Orlando (Florida), Feb. 7 (AP): Until a few months ago, Lisa Nowaks life seemed to be on a perfect trajectory.

 She became an astronaut after winning a series of navy service awards. She had flown on the shuttle Discovery, and was a mother of three children. She said in a September interview with Ladies Home Journal that her husband, Richard, works in Mission Control, so hes part of the whole space business, too. And supportive also.

 But even before she was charged yesterday with attempted first-degree murder, attempted kidnapping and three other crimes all stemming from what police called a love triangle involving a fellow astronaut there were signs that not everything was right in her life.

 In a Nasa interview last year, before her mission aboard Discovery, she spoke about the strain her career placed on her family. She has twin 5-year-old girls and a son who is 14 or 15. Its a sacrifice for our own personal time and our families and the people around us, she said. But I do think its worth it because if you dont explore and take risks and go do all these things, then everything will stay the same.

 In November, a neighbour reported hearing the sounds of dishes being thrown inside Nowaks Houston-area home, and the police came. And weeks ago, Nowak and her husband separated after 19 years. The final unravelling came this week after police arrested her for allegedly trying to kidnap a woman she believed was her rival for the affections of astronaut William Oefelein.

 Perplexed is the word that Im sticking with, said astronaut Chris Ferguson, who attended Nowaks bail hearing in Orlando with chief astronaut Steve Lindsey. Nowak and Oefelein, who both live in the Houston area, had trained together as astronauts, but never flew into space together. Shipman works at Patrick Air Force Base near Kennedy Space Center. Details of Oefeleins relationships with the women were unclear.

 Algerians fear more bloodshed

 Algiers, April 12 (Reuters): Algerians angered by the worst bombings in years voiced fears today that the North African oil exporting country may return to the political bloodshed of the 1990s.

 We thought the days of terror were over. I am still shocked. I am afraid, said Mohamed Rabhi, a young student drinking a coffee in a central Algiers street.

 Interior minister Nourredine Yazid Zerhouni said the suicide blasts that killed 33 in the capital yesterday may have been designed to disrupt May 17 parliamentary polls and torpedo efforts to put a definite end to years of political violence.

 We shouldnt exclude the possibility that there were also other interests not wanting to see the Algerian state recover, rebuild and work more effectively, he said without elaborating.

 The Al Qaida Organisation in the Islamic Maghreb claimed responsibility for the bombings. The claim could not immediately be verified but the group has taken responsibility for several deadly attacks on police, troops and foreigners since January.

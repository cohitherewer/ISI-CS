 Whos cheating

 Jerusalem, July 22 (Reuters): An Israeli man who hired a detective to find out whether his daughter was cheating on her husband was told by the private investigator his wife was in fact the one being unfaithful, an Israeli newspaper reported today.

 The daughter was found innocent, but the investigator managed to snap photographs of the mother and another man caught in the act, the Maariv daily said. The man has since sought to end the marriage.

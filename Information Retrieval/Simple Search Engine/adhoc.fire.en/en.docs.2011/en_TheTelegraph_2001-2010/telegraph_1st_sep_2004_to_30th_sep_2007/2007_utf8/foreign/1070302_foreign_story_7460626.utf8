 New York bans racial slur

 New York, March 1 (Reuters): New York city symbolically banned use of the word nigger yesterday, the latest step in a campaign that hopes to expunge the most vile of racial slurs from hip hop music and television.

 The city council unanimously declared a moratorium that carries no penalty but aims to stop youth from casually using the word, considered by most Americans to be the most offensive in the English language.

 The New York city measure follows similar resolutions this month by the New York State Assembly and state senate, and supporters of the ban are taking their campaign to The Recording Academy, asking it not to nominate musicians for Grammy awards if they use the word in their lyrics.

 Many rap artists and young New Yorkers toss the word around as a term of endearment or as a substitute for black, angering some black leaders who consider those who use it as ignorant.

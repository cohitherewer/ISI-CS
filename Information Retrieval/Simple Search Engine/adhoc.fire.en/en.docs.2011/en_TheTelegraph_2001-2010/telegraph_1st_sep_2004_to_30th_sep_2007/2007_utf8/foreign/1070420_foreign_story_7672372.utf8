 A scene from the Korean film Oldboy

 New York, April 19 (AP): 

 One of the photographs in the Virginia Tech killers 

 multimedia manifesto may have been inspired 

 by a bloody South Korean movie.

 Oldboy, from the respected director Chan-woo Park, is about a man unjustly imprisoned for 15 years. After escaping, he goes on a rampage against his captor. In one scene, he dispatches more than a dozen henchmen with the aid of a hammer.

 In the package of materials that Cho Seung-Hui sent to NBC News, one photo shows the killer brandishing a hammer in a pose similar to one from the film. Oldboy, the second film in Parks Vengeance Trilogy, won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival.

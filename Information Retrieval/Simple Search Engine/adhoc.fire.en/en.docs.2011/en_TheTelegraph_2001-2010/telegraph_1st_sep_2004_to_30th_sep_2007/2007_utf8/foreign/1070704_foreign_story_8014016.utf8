 Free tripper

 Amsterdam, July 3: (Reuters): Police officers in the Dutch city of Alkmaar were surprised to see a car passing by with a man sitting on a bicycle on its roof. The driver and his wife said they heard a noise while waiting at a traffic light, but did not realise they were taking on an extra passenger. The cyclist was fined for public drunkenness.

 Di concert

 London: Organisers of Prince William 

 and Prince Harrys memorial concert for their mother 

 could have sold more tickets but left it too late, says 

 The Daily Telegraph. The terror threat and forecast 

 for bad weather also meant hundreds who had bought tickets 

 did not turn up, contributing to the number of visibly empty 

 seats on what was billed a sell-out event . In all 63,000 

 tickets were sold in advance for the event.

 Potter

 London: Harry Potter-mania has reached frenzied heights with fans around the world swamping Amazon by pre-ordering nearly 1.6 million copies of the final Harry Potter book, The Daily Telegraph says. Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows is already the online retailers most pre-ordered product ever.

 Dubai, March 12 (Reuters): Dubai airport, West Asias busiest, reopened today after an accident involving a Biman Bangladesh Airlines aircraft forced its closure for more than seven hours, causing major disruption to flights.

 Aviation authorities said 27 people were slightly injured in the 0230 GMT accident which happened during takeoff. No details of the cause of the accident were available. Dubai civil aviation authorities are investigating.

 Flight BG 006 from Dubai to Dhaka, carrying 229 passengers and crew, had an accident during departure and failed to take off, a Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) statement said. The airport reopened at about 1000 GMT, but the closure affected 71 flights, it said. 

 Dubai, one of seven emirates comprising the United Arab Emirates, is the biggest trade and tourism centre in the Gulf region. Its airport is a major hub for transfers between Europe and Asia.

 Thirty-six outgoing flights were cancelled and 35 incoming flights were diverted to airports in neighbouring emirates or to Oman, Kuwait or Irans Shiraz airport, the statement said.

 The closure of the runway ... was primarily to inspect its condition and ensure that operations could be resumed. We are operational at full capacity but passengers should check with their respective airlines to confirm the status of their flights, DCA spokesman Huraiz Bin Huraiz said.

 Some passengers complained there was no information about their flights.

 Its crazy, I cant get any sense out of anyone, Joe Murphy, 73, in transit on his way from Australia to Britain, said during the closure. All I want to know is whats happening.

 First they told me the flight was on, then it was off, said Marc Latamie, 54, hoping to take a flight to Paris. I have no idea what is happening.

 UK to raise tobacco bar

 London, Dec. 31: (Reuters): The British government will raise the minimum age for buying tobacco to 18 from 16 in an attempt to reduce smoking by teenagers.

 The new rule will take effect in England and Wales on October 1, 2007, a government statement said. 

 Scotland plans to increase the minimum age to 18 sometime in 2007 and Northern Ireland may also raise the age in forthcoming legislation.

 The government has already ordered a ban on smoking in all workplaces and enclosed public spaces in England from July 1, 2007.

 The government says around 9 per cent of Britons between 11 and 15 smoke and it is determined to check it. 

 The change will bring England and Wales in line with several European countries and the US.

 Panda names

 Beijing, Jan. 24 (Reuters): China has asked its public to come up with names for 18 baby pandas and vote for the naughtiest, most voracious and sleepiest of them all, local media reported today.

 The naming of the cubs is customary when they are weaned and eventually released into their nursery garden in February, www.sina.com, one of the sponsors and the countrys largest Webportal, said.

 The names should be civilised, standard, creative and able to highlight the pandas character as a national treasure, the website said on a special page where ideas could be submitted and votes cast.

 High heels

 Beijing (Reuters): It gives a whole new meaning to high heels. Customs officers in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou have discovered 28 kg of marijuana leaves hidden in 215 pairs of shoes abandoned at the airport last year, Xinhua news agency said on Wednesday.

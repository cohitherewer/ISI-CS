 Lohan says she is not an addict

 So weird

 Los Angeles, April 19 (AP): 

 Lindsay Lohan said she felt safe being in rehab earlier 

 this year, but she does not consider herself an addict.

 The 20-year-old actress told Allure magazine during an interview that she decided to enter the secluded Wonderland Center, an addiction treatment facility, at the suggestion of her therapist.

 Its so weird that I went to rehab. I always said I would die before I went to rehab, Lohan said. Her room was all white, with a parquet, and it was different! I just felt safe, Lohan said. I thought, Im going to stay here tonight. And I stayed there. For a month. It was great, she said.

 Lohan said in January that she had checked into the centre. 

 Her publicist Leslie Sloane Zelnick confirmed in December that Lohan was attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Still, the star of Mean Girls and Freaky Friday told Allure: I dont know that Im necessarily an addict.

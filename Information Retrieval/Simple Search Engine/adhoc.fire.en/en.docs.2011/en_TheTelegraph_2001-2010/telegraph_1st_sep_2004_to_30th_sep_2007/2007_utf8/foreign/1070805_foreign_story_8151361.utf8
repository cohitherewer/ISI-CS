 Marc prepared for worst with JLo

 High standard

 New York, Aug. 4 (AP): Marc Anthony says he was prepared for the worst when working with his wife, Jennifer Lopez, on their new film El Cantante, a biopic of salsa legend Hector Lavoe.

 Oh, I got calls, the 37-year-old actor-singer tells Fashion Rocks magazine. Just friends, you know, giving me the heads-up about working with your partner.

 I thought, jeez, thats like the fourth call I got this month! What are they preparing me for? he says. I thought it was going to be World War III, when, in fact, it was Club Med.

 Anthony plays Lavoe, a talented but troubled Puerto Rican singer. Lopez portrays Lavoes long-suffering wife, Puchi. The 39-year-old actress-singer also produced the movie.

 We have a high standard for each other; I know what hes capable of, and he knows what Im capable of, even more than we know ourselves, Lopez said.

 So when you see the light and the shine and all that someone is capable of, you want that person to achieve that. And I think he has the same thing for me.

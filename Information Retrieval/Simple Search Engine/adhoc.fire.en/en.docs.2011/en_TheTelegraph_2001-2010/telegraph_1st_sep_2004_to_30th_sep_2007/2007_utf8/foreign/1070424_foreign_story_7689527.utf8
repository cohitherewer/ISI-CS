 Sarkozy, Royal head back to campaign

 Paris, April 23 (Reuters): French presidential candidates Nicolas Sarkozy and Segolene Royal went back to the campaign trail today as they battled for votes from the undecided centre ground that will be key to their runoff on May 6.

 Yesterdays first round ballot set up a classic race between Left and Right in France after Sarkozy, the conservative former interior minister, scored a resounding win with 31.2 per cent against 25.9 per cent for the Socialist candidate Royal.

 Sarkozy holds a clear lead before the decisive second round, with polls giving him 52-54 percent against 46-48 percent for Royal and leaving the Socialists with a big hill to climb.

 Im a bit worried, said former Socialist Prime Minister Michel Rocard.Segolene Royal can, of course, still win, but the figures are the figures, he added.

 Both candidates are eyeing supporters of centrist Francois Bayrou, who captured 18.6 per cent of the vote after a dynamic campaign based on a pledge to sweep aside the ruling elite and overcome traditional political divides.

 Essentially, the results will be dictated by the behaviour of his voters. They are the ones who will make a difference, Roland Cayrol, head of pollsters CSA said.

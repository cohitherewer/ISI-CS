The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Bond, ageing amp; weak but highly sexed

 Daniel Craig as James Bond in Casino Royale

 London, July 10 (Reuters): British novelist Sebastian Faulks has written a new, officially approved James Bond thriller portraying the ageing spy as vulnerable and damaged but as highly sexed as ever.

 Faulks, author of Birdsong and Charlotte Gray, was at first hesitant when approached by Ian Flemings estate to write a book to mark the centenary of the authors birth. But Faulks, re-reading the thrillers he first devoured as a 13-year-old boy, said: Quite soon I saw the books had stood up very well. What I liked about them was that you had the sense of this single, vulnerable man who was in extreme jeopardy all the time.

 The result is Devil May Care, a pacey thriller written in true Bond style with exotic locations, glamorous women and larger-than-life villains.

 He adored writing the book. I couldnt wait to get to my desk every day, he told Reuters in the first print media interview to mark the announcement.

 Faulks took up where Fleming left off in 1966 with Octopussy and the Living Daylights, the last of 14 Bond books which have sold 100 million copies since. The Bond films have been seen by the equivalent of half the worlds population.

 Faulks was determined to follow Flemings style.

 The books have no cliches or bad writing. They are written as though by a journalist. He learnt to write prose working for Reuters in Moscow. They have a very direct style with short sentences, lots of active verbs and no semicolons, he said.

 Fleming used to write 1,000 words in the morning at his house in Jamaica then go snorkelling, have a cocktail and lunch on the terrace before writing another 1,000 words in the afternoon.

 Faulks followed exactly the same routine at his desk in west London apart from the cocktails, lunch and snorkelling.

 He wrote the book over six weeks, determined come hell or high water to keep the story driving on. I wanted to write a book that Fleming would have approved of and made him smile.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Prefume firm stands by Britney

 New York, Feb. 23 (Reuters): Elizabeth Arden Inc. said yesterday it would continue to support troubled pop singer Britney Spears and her perfume line, although fans may shun the fragrances after her recent behaviour and negative publicity.

 We have a long-standing and very successful relationship with Britney Spears. We care about her personally and remain completely supportive of her, the beauty company said, after a New York Post story on Wednesday outlined how her recent antics may be hurting sales.

 Celebrity perfumes have been a strong source of earnings for companies such as Elizabeth Arden, which makes and sells Spearss Fantasy, Midnight Fantasy, In Control and Curious scents. Curious, which was launched in late 2004, was the first in the line.

 and an instant success. The latest, Midnight Fantasy, also got off to a strong start, the company said.

 Less than two weeks ago, New York-based Elizabeth Arden reported quarterly profits that topped Wall Street estimates.

 Sales rose nearly 20 percent, fueled by sales of its fragrance brands. The Britney Spears fragrance line brought double-digit gains, Chief Executive Scott Beattie said in a statement.

 BALD IS BEAUTIFUL?

 But 25-year-old Spears has grabbed the headlines recently for entirely different reasons.

 The mother of two shaved her head at a Los Angeles salon earlier this week after a stylist refused to do it for her and topped that off with a trip to a tattoo parlor.

 Not surprisingly, a Web site has also been established offering to sell Spears hair, her cigarette lighter and a can of Red Bull energy drink she was apparently drinking when the shearing occurred for at least $1 million.

 Spears has also been in and out of rehab centers, once in the Caribbean island of Antigua, after staying for less than a day, and on Wednesday checked into and out of an upscale Los Angeles center within a few hours, according to news reports.

 Reports said she later checked back in after her estranged husband, Kevin Federline, refused to let her into the house where he is living with their two children.

 Elizabeth Arden shares ended up 7 cents on Thursday at $22.73 in Nasdaq trading.

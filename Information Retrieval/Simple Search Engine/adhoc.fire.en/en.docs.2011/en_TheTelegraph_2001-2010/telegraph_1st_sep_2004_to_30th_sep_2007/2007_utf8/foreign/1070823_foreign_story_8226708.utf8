 Taiwan jet logo removed

 Tokyo, Aug. 22 (AFP): China Airlines painted over its logo on the charred remains of a burnt-out plane as investigators today sifted through the debris to find out why the jet blew up moments after landing in Japan.

 Television footage showed a maintenance crew in green suits whitening out the name China Airlines on the planes mangled body as well as the Taiwanese carriers plum flower emblem on its tail.

 The Boeing 737-800 burst into a ball of fire just eight minutes after it landed monday on the southern island of Okinawa. All 165 passengers and crew escaped.

 China Airlines official Yoko Kuroda confirmed the carrier had whitened out the corporate logo last night with the permission of Japanese authorities. Our officials in Taiwan said they recognised that there was a precedent for painting over logos, said Kuroda, from the marketing branch of the airlines Tokyo office.

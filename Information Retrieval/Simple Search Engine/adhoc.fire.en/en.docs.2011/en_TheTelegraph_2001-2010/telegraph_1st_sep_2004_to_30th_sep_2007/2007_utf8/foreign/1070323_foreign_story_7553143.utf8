 College alert to India

 K.P. NAYAR

 Washington, March 22: India, which supplies a rising number of prestigious IIT graduates and other engineers to the US and global markets, is playing politics with its education and compromising quality with quotas, a comprehensive academic study has warned.

 The study, which covered 100 universities and engineering colleges in India and 200 in China in addition to the entire technical education scene in the US was undertaken in the light of widespread concern here about the growing technological capacity of the two emerging Asian giants.

 What could be outsourced next (to India and China) is research and design, and that the US stands to lose its ability to invent the next big technologies, the study by the Pratt School of Engineering and the Center on Globalization, Governance and Competitiveness at Duke University concluded. 

 It confirmed oft-repeated figures here that China and India collectively graduate 12 times more engineers than does the US.

 Roughly 70,000 students graduate from engineering colleges in America annually. China graduates 600,000 and India 350,000. These figures have alarmed political leaders here and two years ago, an Innovation Agenda was proposed in the US House of Representatives to raise the output of American engineering graduates to 100,000 a year.

 After exhaustive visits to India and interviews at the ministry of science and technology, the University Grants Commission, the National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom) and the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), the study concluded that the countrys public education system is mired in politics and inefficiency.

 It noted that current national debates focus on a demand for caste-based quotas for more than half of the available seats in public institutions. The study concluded that private enterprise in education has been Indias salvation, but warned that most of the private colleges face quality issues, although there are a few exceptions.

 It paid tributes to the IITs that have been the subject of rave TV programmes and documentaries here in recent years because their graduates are now leaders in technology enterprises across the US.

 Among the universities funded by the government, the IITs are best known and reputed to provide excellent education. But they graduate only a small percentage of Indias engineers. Although the quality of other engineering institutions colleges vary greatly, representatives of local companies and multinationals told Duke University researchers that they felt comfortable hiring the top graduates from most colleges in India unlike the situation in China. Even though the quality of graduates across all universities (in India) was inconsistent, corporate officials felt that with additional training, most graduates could become productive in a reasonable period. The study came up with the worrying assessment that while China is racing ahead of the US and India in its production of engineering and technology PhDs and in its ability to perform basic research, India is in particularly bad shape, as it does not appear to be producing the numbers of PhDs needed even to staff its growing universities.

 The lead author of the study is Vivek Wadhwa, an executive in residence in the Master of Engineering Management Program at Duke Universitys Pratt Schoolof Engineering.

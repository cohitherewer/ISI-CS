 Net abuzz with petitions from Paris fans amp; foes

 Cyber war

 Los

 Angeles, May 9 (Reuters): The Internet was abuzz with rival petitions yesterday from fans and foes of jail-bound heiress Paris Hilton alternately asking California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to pardon her or make sure she serves her time.

 Four days after a Los Angeles judge sentenced Hilton to 45 days in jail for violating her probation by driving on a suspended licence, the competing petitions provided a rallying point for a lively debate over whether the celebrity socialite and reality TV star deserves her punishment.

 We think 45 days in jail is a cruel punishment for the calibre of what she did, said Kyle Vincent, an artist who launched the FreeParis.org website and is trying to collect one million signatures on a petition seeking clemency by June 5, the date the hotel heiress was ordered to report to jail.

 Vincent, 27, described himself as a longtime Hilton fan who believes her story that she was unaware her licence had been suspended when she was caught driving over the speed limit after dark without headlights in February.

 Vincent said he had collected over 500 signatures on his petition so far and had sold about 200 pieces of merchandise, with proceeds going to support the petition drive, myself and the organisers. A no-pardon petition urges Schwarzenegger to ignore other petitions asking for clemency and show the people of California that no one is above the law.

 Hilton herself appeared to embrace the clemency effort with a short note posted on what was identified as her personal page on the popular social networking hub MySpace.com: My friend Joshua started his petition, please help and sihn it (sic). I LOVE YOU ALL!!!!!

 Schwarzeneggers press secretary, Aaron McLear, said the governor had received no formal request to consider a pardon but added: It would be premature for the governor to become involved in any case.

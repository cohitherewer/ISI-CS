 Drunken prize

 Seoul, May 9 (Reuters): On second thoughts, maybe it was not a good idea to give an award for drinking to local government officials.

 The South Korean county of Koesan has decided it will discontinue giving out its Drinking Culture Prize after being flooded with complaints that the award promotes drunkenness among municipal employees and encouraged binge drinking.

 A county official said today the public misunderstood the intention of the award, which was meant to recognise government workers who go out to local restaurants and bars to meet citizens and hear what they have to say.

 A cream-coloured 1975 Travis Bean electric

 guitar belonging to the bands legendary,

 late lead guitar player, Jerry Garcia, brought

 in $312,000 in a brisk sale, auction house

 said. Enthusiasts also bid $102,000 for an

 acoustic guitar and $39,000 for a Gibson electric

 Wonder art

 New York (Reuters): The spring art sales got off to an auspicious start on Tuesday when Sothebys sold nearly $280 million worth of Impressionist and modern art, the second-best result in its history. Any doubt about the strength of the market for 19th and early 20th-century works in light of skyrocketing prices for contemporary art were laid to rest by the colossal sale, at which 90 per cent of the lots found buyers and several records were set. Led by Cezannes Green melon still life and Lyonel Feiningers Jesuits III, the auction took in $278,548,000, near the high end of its pre-sale estimate.

 Dance out

 Los Angeles (AP): Billy

 Ray Cyrus, who said appearing on Dancing With the Stars was the scariest thing I could possibly think of to do, has bid farewell to the ballroom. The 45-year-old singer and actor was eliminated from the ABC dance-off on Tuesday. He seemed to know his time was up before the results were announced. This is a celebration tonight, he said early in the show. I

 got to meet my hero, Muhammad Ali, last night.

 I conquered my fear.

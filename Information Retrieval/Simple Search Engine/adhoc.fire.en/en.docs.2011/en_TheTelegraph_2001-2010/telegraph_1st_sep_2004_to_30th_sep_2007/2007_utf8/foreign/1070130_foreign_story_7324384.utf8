 Dhaka, Jan. 29 (Reuters): A political crisis in Bangladesh worsened today after the high court ruled that elections could not be held for at least three months or until the voter registration process had been completely overhauled.

 The court also ordered the countrys election commission to explain why transparent ballot boxes and proper voter identity cards could not be prepared ahead of the polls.

 The decision came after a petition brought by a private citizen, Manumur Rashid, who argued that the constitution had been violated. The case was not challenged by the election commission and is binding unless challenged at the supreme court.

 Bangladesh has been in political crisis since the dissolution of the government at the end of its five-year term on October 28 and the appointment of an interim administration that was supposed to oversee elections originally scheduled for January 22.

 But feuding by rival political parties has seen the caretaker government dissolved once and the appointment of two different heads of the election commission.

 The court issued the order after hearing a writ petition by a voter who claimed that the election commission had violated the constitution by announcing a recent poll schedule (which was later cancelled), a court official said.

 So far no date has been set for elections in part because a multiparty political alliance led by Sheikh Hasina, a former Prime Minister and chief of the Awami League, wants reforms implemented.

 Hasina has insisted on the removal of election commission officials she accuses of bias towards her rival, Begum Khaleda Zia, the immediate past Prime Minister who ended her five-year tenure in October.

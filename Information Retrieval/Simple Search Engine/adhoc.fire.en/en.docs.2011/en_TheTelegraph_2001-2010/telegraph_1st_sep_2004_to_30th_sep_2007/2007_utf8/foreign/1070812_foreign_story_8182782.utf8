 Fate of nukes worries US

 New York, Aug, 11 (PTI): The US is worried about the fate of Pakistans nuclear weapons if President Musharraf is killed or overthrown.

 Quoting three American sources, CNN said Musharraf may still impose a state of emergency despite ruling it out a couple of days ago. American military intelligence officials, it said, are urgently assessing how secure the Pakistani nuclear weapons would be if Musharraf is killed or overthrown.

 CNN said key questions in the assessment include who would control Pakistans nuclear weapons after a shift in power.

 The US television channels sources independently confirmed details of the intelligence review but would not allow their names to be used because of the sensitivity of the matter. American analysts, the report said, are watching current Pakistani troop movements closely to see whether Musharraf is making any moves that could indicate he is about to impose emergency.

 It appears that in recent weeks a large number of troops headed to the Pakistani tribal regions along the Afghan border, officials say.

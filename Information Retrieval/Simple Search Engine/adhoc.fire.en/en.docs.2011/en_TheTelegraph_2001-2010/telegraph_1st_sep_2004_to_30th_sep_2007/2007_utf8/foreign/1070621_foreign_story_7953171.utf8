 Foreign tag on dead militants

 Islamabad, June 20 (Reuters): Most of the 32 militants killed in an apparent missile attack in a Pakistani tribal region were foreigners, mainly Uzbeks, a senior Pakistani government official said today.

 Intelligence officials said missiles, possibly fired by US forces in Afghanistan, hit a suspected militant training base yesterday in a hamlet in the mountainous North Waziristan tribal region, killing 32 militants.

 All the dead are foreigners and most of them were Uzbeks, said a senior official working in the region, who declined to be identified. No senior member of Osama bin Ladens al Qaida network or the Taliban was killed, he said.Thats for sure, no high-value target was there.

 Pakistani military spokesman Major-General Waheed Arshad said there had been an explosion in the area but denied missiles caused it and said the army had not carried out any operations there.

 He suggested the explosion occurred while militants were making a bomb. Such explanations have been offered in the past when US forces in Afghanistan fired missiles at targets on Pakistani territory.

 Pakistans anti-terrorism alliance with the US is unpopular with many Pakistanis, and the government is sensitive to any report of foreign forces carrying out operations in its territory or airspace.

 Many members and supporters of al Qaida, including some Uzbeks and other foreigners, as well as Taliban members fled to North Waziristan after US-led forces overthrew Afghanistans Taliban government in 2001.

 Afghan and US military officials say the militants direct their intensified insurgency in Afghanistan, and plot violence elsewhere, from sanctuaries on the Pakistani side of the border.The government authority responsible for the tribal lands on the Afghan border said the explosions had hit a training base for foreign militants, but it too denied missiles had been fired.

 A resident of the area said three missiles had been fired but he denied the dead were militants.

 Fine Print

 Britney boards

 Tampa (Florida), June 19 (AP): Radio station billboards that featured unflattering photos of a bald, scowling Britney Spears have been taken down after the pop stars attorneys threatened legal action.

 In a letter to Clear Channel Communications, Spearss attorneys accused the company of offensive, unauthorised commercial exploitation of the singer, and demanded that the three billboards in the Tampa area be removed. The letter was posted on the www.thesmokinggun.com website.

 The billboards depicted the bald Spears and show host Todd Schnitt along with the slogans Total Nut Jobs, Shock Therapy and Certifiable.

 Monet sale

 London (AP): A view of the Thames painted by Claude Monet sold for almost 18 million ($36 million) at auction on Monday, kicking off a week of big-budget sales on the London art market. Waterloo Bridge, Temps Couvert (Waterloo Bridge, Overcast Weather) was bought by an anonymous American bidder for 17,940,000 ($35.6 million). The price is the second-highest ever for a Monet at auction. The record of almost

 20 million was set at Sothebys in 1998.

 Paris time

 Los Angeles (AP): Paris Hilton is settling into her cell at an all-womens jail and is doing better, her parents said after a weekend visit. They said the 26-year-old socialite is passing the time at the Century Regional Detention Center in Lynwood reading letters from fans, relatives and friends and reflecting on her life. Basically just reading and just sitting there thinking ... what she wants to do with her life and the changes that she wants to make, Kathy Hilton told Fox News Channels Greta Van Susteren on Monday. 

 Card crush

 Berlin (Reuters): A 16-year-old Berlin student was so worried he would have to repeat a year at school because of poor marks he convinced two friends to storm his class and steal the report cards with his bad grades. The youth sat quietly at the back of the classroom as the two masked robbers, aged 14 and 15, burst in and threatened his teacher with a steel bar if she did not hand over the reports. After grabbing them, the two tried to flee but dropped the reports as other students leapt to defend the teacher. The two were arrested close to the school.

 Thief steal

 Berlin (Reuters): A would-be German thief went from predator to victim when he tried to mug a taxi driver but ended up having his own wallet snatched instead. After the 20-year-old stole the drivers wallet, a scuffle broke out between the two, in which the cabbie not only recovered his property but also took his attackers wallet, police said. The driver then locked himself in his taxi and called the police, who were amazed to find the mugger waiting patiently for them.

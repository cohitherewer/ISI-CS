 Islamabad, Sept. 6 (PTI) Pervez Musharrafs term as President ends on November 15 but he will remain as army chief till his successor is appointed, the Pakistan government today told a seven-member bench of the supreme court.

 The court rejected a plea filed by the government urging the bench not to hear a petition seeking to block the Presidents re-election plans.

 In a written statement to the bench headed by Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, Musharrafs lawyer Syed Sharifuddin Pirzada said the Presidents term will end on November 15 and he would continue to be in uniform till a new army chief is appointed to replace him.

 The court yesterday asked Pirzada to find out when Musharrafs dual office period will expire after observing that things should be in black and white.

 The court is hearing a petition filed by the Opposition Jamaat-e-Islami leader, Qazi Hussain Ahmed, challenging an act of parliament that allowed Musharraf to hold two offices at the same time.

 The formal notification on the expiry of Musharrafs tenure as President would end the confusion over the issue. The President plans to get re-elected for a five-year term by the present Assemblies before the end of his term.

 Musharrafs plans to get re-elected in the next few weeks ran into trouble as the court declined his lawyers plea to turn down the Qazi Ahmeds petition.

 The bench also rejected the governments plea to at least stay the proceedings on Ahmeds petition as the court itself has admitted a review application on the validity of the President to Hold Another Office Act, 2004, which Musharraf claims had legalised his continuation in dual posts.

 Naked news

 Tokyo, Aug. 17 (Reuters): An embarrassed Japanese government has cut the subsidy, but a Tokyo TV company said today it would carry on making a striptease news show with sign language for hearing-impaired viewers.

 The government made grants totalling 400,000 yen ($3,500) to help cover production of the weekly five-minute programme on satellite TV, which features a newsreader who removes her clothes between news items that she delivers in sign language.

 Most people who had contacted the station about the programme were supportive, saying deaf people had the right to enjoy the same programmes as other people, he added. 

 Fiery sex

 Berlin (Reuters): A teenage couple having 

 sex for the first time were interrupted when candles set 

 fire to the girls attic bedroom and forced them to 

 flee naked from her parents house, German daily Bild 

 said. The girl had wanted to create a romantic atmosphere 

 for the occasion. But when the room suddenly became engulfed 

 with flames, they had to make a hasty escape. The couple, 

 both 18, were pictured naked in the paper among the burned 

 wreckage of the attic.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 The noisiest Hilton

 Los Angeles, May 9 (AP): The Hilton who made the most noise in and out of court last week was not named Paris.

 Kathy Hilton, mother of the notorious party girl, became a media magnet herself at her daughters probation-violation hearing. She laughed in the courtroom when a city prosecutor argued that Paris deserved jail time. When a judge ordered the 26-year-old Paris to serve 45 days in county jail, Kathy Hilton blurted out: May I have your autograph? She also shared her feelings with reporters outside: This is pathetic and disgusting, a waste of taxpayer money with all this nonsense. This is a joke.

 While her media exposure does not rival that of her famous daughter, Kathy Hilton is no stranger to the spotlight. She was a guest star on the television show Happy Days in 1977 and appeared on The Rockford Files in 1978. She hosted a programme and starred in her own NBC reality show in 2005, I Want to Be a Hilton, in which contestants competed for a chance to live like a socialite for a year.

 Accompanying her adult daughter to court made Hilton a public face again. She was likely on hand out of typical parental concern, said Dorian Traube, a professor of social work at the University of Southern California.

 Any time your kids stumble, you question yourself as a parent, she said. She has one daughter thats done really well and another that keeps stumbling in the public eye. For a family thats very prominent, its probably quite humiliating.

 While it is common for families to come and show support in high-profile court cases, Hiltons outspoken behaviour was a little unusual, Traube said.

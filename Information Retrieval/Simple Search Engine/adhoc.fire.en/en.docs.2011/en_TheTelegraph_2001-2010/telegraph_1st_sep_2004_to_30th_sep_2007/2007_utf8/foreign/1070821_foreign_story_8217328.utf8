 London, Aug. 20: Madonna is considering leaving Warner Music, her career-long record label, to move to Live Nation, the venues and promotions company, in a deal valued by music industry executives at about $100million, reports The Times newspaper.

 The agreement being talked about involves combining the superstars future recordings with her proven ability to generate massive income touring.

 Warner has yet to acknowledge defeat, but industry executives expect the singer to move and receive a payout that would be in line with the 50million that Robbie Williams received from EMI in 2002. It would be a significant coup for the Los Angeles-based Live Nation, which is Britains leading venue owner and promoter, running Wembley Arena and owning the Brixton Academy.

 US to ease citizen rule for foreign workers

 Washington, April 18 (PTI): The US state department has said it wants to cut down the number of years foreign employees must work at US embassies or consulates before they can apply for American citizenship.

 The department is going to ask Congress to reward foreigners especially those working in tough assignment areas of Iraq and Afghanistan by cutting the requirement from the current 15 years to three.

 We want to do right by people who have served well and honourably on behalf of their country and the US, said state department spokesman Sean McCormack. 

 The proposal under consideration will give the secretary of state the powers under exceptional circumstances to allow foreign service nationals to apply sooner for special immigrant visas. 

 The rule change would apply to all 37,092 foreigners working at US embassies, but are being made mainly keeping those working in Baghdad and Kabul in mind.

 Sir Paul or Papa Paul? Paternity test will tell 

 - Love child makes new demand

 Trouble from every quarter

 The case is the latest twist in a paternity battle over Bettina Krischbin, who is now 46, that has rumbled on for decades.

 Krischbin, who has two children of her own, lives in Berlin but says she was conceived in Hamburg in the early 1960s, before the Beatles rose to world fame.

 She claims that Sir Paul sent a double to carry out a paternity test 20 years ago, which appeared to prove that he was not her father.

 The signature on the documents he signed at the time was false, she said. 

 We found the signature is from a right-handed person and he is not. I want a new paternity test, she added. It is my right.

 Now German authorities have opened a case to investigate the claim. A spokesman for the public prosecutors office confirmed: There is a complaint of fraud against him (McCartney) that we are investigating.

 Krischbins mother, Erika Hubers, who at 64 is the same age as the billionaire musician, said she fully supported her daughters efforts to win recognition as his daughter. I think we have a good chance now, because he lied to the court provided it with false evidence, she said.

 Paul and I were teenagers in Hamburg and very much in love you know how teenagers are. We were together for two years (between 1960-62) and I know for sure that Bettina is his because I was completely faithful for that time. I dont know if he was, but I was!

 Hubers, a former nightclub waitress, alleged that Sir Pauls lawyers had approached her three years after Bettina was born, offering to buy her silence. 

 They paid me 16,000 German marks (then about 7,000) to keep my mouth shut, she said, adding that 30,000 marks was paid to German social services which assisted single mothers.

 I wasnt allowed to speak, was forced to keep silent, she said. I never even told my daughter until she was 12 years old, and she has never met her father.

 If the new case does prove Krischbin is Pauls daughter, she could be entitled to 10 per cent of his estate after his death, totalling tens of millions of pounds, according to German law.

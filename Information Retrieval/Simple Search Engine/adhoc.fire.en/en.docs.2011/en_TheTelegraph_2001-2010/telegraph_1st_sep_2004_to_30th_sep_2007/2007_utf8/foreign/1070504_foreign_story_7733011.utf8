 Lohan wants to milk it when she turns 21

 Legally wild

 Los

 Angeles, May 3 (AP): Lindsay Lohan will not be satisfied with a cake and some candles when she turns 21.

 The raspy-voiced actress, who celebrates her big birthday on July 2, said yesterday on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that she plans to milk it when she becomes old enough to legally go to clubs.

 Lohan said turning 21 has been a long time coming for her friends who own clubs in Los Angeles. After shes legal, they dont have to worry about getting into trouble, for letting her inside, she told host Ellen DeGeneres.

 She will celebrate by partying in Vegas, she said, and also with a dinner in Malibu, California, with family and friends. Lohan, who stars opposite Felicity Huffman and Jane Fonda in the upcoming Universal Pictures film Georgia Rule, also showed off a white tattoo of the word breathe on the inside of her wrist. And its breathe because? asked DeGeneres. I forget to breathe sometimes, Lohan replied.

 She has also starred in films like Herbie: Fully Loaded and Freaky Friday.

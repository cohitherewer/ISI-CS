 Nepal hunting reserve

 Kathmandu, July 15 (PTI): Nepalese authorities have decided to open the only hunting reserve in the country after almost a decade of closure as the game population has increased.

 The Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, situated in the erstwhile Maoist stronghold of Rukum district in the countrys mid-west, was closed during the decade-long insurgency.

 A recent survey has revealed that the number of Himalayan blue sheep, the main trophy for gaming, has crossed 1000, officials at the department of national parks and wildlife reserve said.

 During the insurgency, the Maoists had captured most of the reserve, and the population of the blue sheep reportedly declined as they were hunted by the rebels for meat.

 The conservation area spread across 1,325sqkm is the only protected area in Nepal, where hunting was legally permitted.

 Top Gears Clarkson in green soup

 Clarkson: Breaking rules?

London, July 8: Jeremy Clarkson has been accused of damaging one of the worlds last pristine wildernesses while recording a programme for the BBCs Top Gear.

 Fury erupted after the presenter and his team drove three cars across a vast but fragile national park in Botswana, allegedly leaving scars on the landscape.

 Conservationists say that only quad bikes should be driven across the fragile salt pans, only in dry conditions and only in single file, so that just one track is made on the land, most of which has never been touched by man.

 But Clarkson and his team stand accused of ignoring the single-file guideline and of racing all over the place on the fragile ecosystem known as the Makgadikgadi salt pans. Conservationists said the tracks would last for decades.

 The Makgadikgadi salt pans are the largest in the world, the residue of a great lake that once covered 23,000 square miles of northern Botswana. Climactic changes less than 10,000 years ago caused the lake to evaporate, leaving only salt deposits. The legacy is a hauntingly beautiful, flat, uninhabited expanse under a vast sky. It is home to flamingos, wildebeest and one of Africas last big zebra migrations.

 The BBC said it had been guided by environmental experts and said that no permanent damage had been caused.

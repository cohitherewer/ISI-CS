 Kathmandu, Jan. 25: The Nepal government has decided to replace King Gyanendras picture on currency notes with photographs of Nepali heroes, the Buddha and the Himalayas.

 At a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister G.P. Koirala recently, a proposal finalised by the finance ministry to replace the kings picture on currency notes was approved. 

 From now on, currency notes will have pictures of Nepali heroes, the Buddha and the Himalayas. The new notes will be issued by the Reserve Bank in May this year. The decision puts an end to a 50-year tradition of adorning currency notes with royal figures.

 Los Angeles, May 5 (AP): Paris Hilton worked as a farmer and maid on her TV show The Simple Life. Now shes facing a real-life hardship in her latest role: jail inmate.

 Hilton, who attained worldwide notoriety for her relentless partying, was sentenced yesterday to 45 days in a county jail for violating probation in an alcohol-related, reckless driving case by driving with a suspended licence.

 As an inmate, she might have to spend most of her day in a cell smaller than her closet her only luxury escape a short period to shower, watch TV, exercise or talk on the phone.

 Im very sorry and from now on Im going to pay complete attention to everything. Im sorry and I did not do it on purpose at all, Hilton, 26, told a judge before the sentencing. Superior court judge Michael T. Sauer, saying theres no doubt she knew her licence had been suspended, ordered that Hilton report to a womens jail in suburban Lynwood, California, by June 5.

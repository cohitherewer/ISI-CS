 BA cabin crew vote for strike

 London, Jan. 15 (AP): Thousands of British Airways employees have voted to strike following disputes centering on sick pay and pensions, union officials said today.

 In one of the largest majorities seen in such a dispute, some 96 per cent of cabin crews voting on the action opted for a strike, the transport and general workers union said. No strike deadline was set.

 Cabin crew workers had claimed the airline pressured them to come to work even if they felt sick, the union said. A separate dispute focused on pension plans.

 BA cabin crew have voted to say the airline has gone too far, said Jack Dromey, the unions deputy-general secretary. 

 BA must rebuild the trust of its cabin crew by negotiating rather than imposing change and by listening to its staff rather than riding roughshod over their concerns.

 British Airways officials issued a statement to decry what they described as an unnecessary strike. 

 We have not been seeking to achieve new ways of working by imposition, but by negotiation as in many other areas of our business, the airlines statement said.

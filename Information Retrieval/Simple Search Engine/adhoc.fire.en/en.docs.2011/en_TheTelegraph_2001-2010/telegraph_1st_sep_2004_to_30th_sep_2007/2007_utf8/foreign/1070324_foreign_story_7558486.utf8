 Islamabad, March 23 (Reuters): Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf tried today to defuse a political crisis over the suspension of the countrys top judge, saying the law must be allowed to take its course.

 Musharraf, speaking at a Pakistan Day ceremony in Islamabad, also said every Pakistani had to stand up to the extremism and terrorism spreading through society.

 The governments suspension of Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry on March 9 triggered protests by lawyers and the Opposition and has snowballed into Musharrafs biggest political crisis in the run-up to an expected attempt to seek another term. It is legal issue and it will be resolved only though legal and constitutional means, Musharraf said.

 I appeal to all lawyers that they should let this constitutional and legal process be completed. It should not be made a law and order or political issue, he said. 

 Chaudhry, in his first media interview since his suspension, told the Dawn newspaper he was innocent and wanted the closed hearing into the accusations against him open to the public.

 The move to sack Chaudhry led to suspicion that Musharraf feared the independent-minded judge would block any attempt by the President to keep the post of army chief, which he is due to give up this year.

 Chaudhry might also have been called to rule on the timing of the next presidential election.

 Under the Pakistani system, parliament and provincial Assemblies elect the President and Musharrafs aides have said he might call on existing Assemblies to do so, rather than the new Assemblies that get elected late this year or early next.

 Many judges and lawyers see the move against Chaudhry as an attack on the independence of the judiciary and seven judges and a deputy attorney-general have resigned. Lawyers and Opposition activists clashed with police in Islamabad and Lahore last week. Protests have continued this week but there has been no serious trouble. More protests have been called for coming days.

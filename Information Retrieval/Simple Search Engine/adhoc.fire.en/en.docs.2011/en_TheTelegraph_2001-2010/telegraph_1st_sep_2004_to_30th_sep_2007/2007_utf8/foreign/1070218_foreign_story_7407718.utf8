 Congress defies Bush on Iraq

 NIGEL DAVIES-PATRICK, TOBY HARNDEN

 Bush: Debate looms

 London, Feb. 17: A resolution rebuking George W Bush over his surge strategy in Iraq moves to the US Senate after the House of Representatives dealt a symbolic blow to the President.

 Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader of the House, led the assault on Bush, using the debate to warn him against attacking Iran. 

 Congress should assert itself and make it very clear that there is no previous authority for the President, any President, to go into Iran, she said. The House passed the resolution by 246 votes to 182, with 17 Republicans supporting it. The resolution is not binding but represents a politically potent message to Bush.

 Pelosi suggested it would signal a change in direction in Iraq that will end the fighting and bring our troops home. 

 The Senate refused today to consider a resolution denouncing Bushs Iraq troop buildup. For the second time in two weeks, Senate Democrats failed to overcome Republican resistance and get the votes necessary to debate a non-binding measure. 

 The resolution passed in the House promises that Congress will continue to support and protect American forces but disapproves of the decision of President George W. Bush... to deploy more than 20,000 additional US combat troops to Iraq.

 The stage is set for a bitter constitutional clash between Congress and Bush, raising the vital question of how much discretion Americas commander-in-chief should be allowed on decisions over peace and war.

 Debate is also looming on a new requirement that would stop Bush from sending troops to Iraq until they were certified as combat-ready. This would mean soldiers being allowed a year at home before redeployment in Iraq. 

 Democrats, stoked by their partys fervently anti-war activists, want to limit Bushs room for manoeuvre and hamper his Iraq strategy without cutting off funding for the war a risky move last employed during the Vietnam war.

 Bush, who has aggressively asserted his constitutional powers as commander-in-chief, has heavily criticised Democrats for approving the nomination of General David Petraeus as commander of forces in Iraq while trying to frustrate the surge plan he helped to author.

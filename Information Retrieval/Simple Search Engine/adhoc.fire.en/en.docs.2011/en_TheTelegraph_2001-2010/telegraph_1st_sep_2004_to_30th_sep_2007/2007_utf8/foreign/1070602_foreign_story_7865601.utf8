 Dr Death leaves jail unbowed

 Detroit, June 1 (Reuters): Jack Kevorkian, the US assisted suicide advocate dubbed Dr Death, stepped free from a Michigan prison today with few words but plans for a media blitz to support his cause.

 Kevorkian, 79, had served eight years for a second-degree murder conviction after he videotaped himself administering lethal drugs to a 52-year-old man suffering from the debilitating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrigs disease.

 The former pathologist won international notoriety in the 1990s after presiding as a doctor in dozens of suicides and advocating the legalisation of assisted suicide in the US.

 Under police escort, Kevorkian and his lawyer drove out of a state prison in rural Coldwater, Michigan, about 165 km southwest of Detroit.

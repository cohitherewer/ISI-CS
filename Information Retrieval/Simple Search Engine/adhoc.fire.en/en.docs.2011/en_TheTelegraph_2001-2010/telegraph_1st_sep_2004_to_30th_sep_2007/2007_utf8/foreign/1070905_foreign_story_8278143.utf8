 Chemical Ali

 Ali Hassan al-Majeed

 Baghdad, Sept. 4 (Reuters): An Iraqi appeals court today upheld the death sentence against Saddam Husseins cousin, widely known as Chemical Ali, for masterminding a genocidal campaign against Iraqs Kurds in the 1980s.

 The nine appeal judges have upheld the death sentence against Ali Hassan al-Majeed, and according to the law of the court, the sentence must be carried out within 30 days, the chief prosecutor in the trial, Munkith al-Fatlawi, said.

 He said the court also upheld the death sentences against two other accused, Sultan Hashim, Saddams former defence minister, and Hussein Rashid, the former deputy head of operations for the Iraqi military.

 Majeed, once one of the most feared men in Iraq, was convicted of genocide in June for directing the 1988 Anfal military campaign against Kurds. Prosecutors said up to 180,000 people were killed, chemical weapons used and villages razed.

 Majeed has also just gone on trial for his role in crushing a Shite rebellion in southern Iraq in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War. Prosecutors have said Majeed could be executed before the latest trial is completed.

 The appeals court also upheld the life sentences issued by the Iraqi High Tribunal to two other defendants in the Anfal trial and agreed with the decision to drop charges against the former governor of Mosul.

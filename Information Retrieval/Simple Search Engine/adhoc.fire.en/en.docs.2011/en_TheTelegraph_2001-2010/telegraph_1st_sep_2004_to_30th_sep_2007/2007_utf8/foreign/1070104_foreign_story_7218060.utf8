 Demi again keen on babies

 special bond

 Los Angeles, Jan. 3 (Reuters): Their May-December romance has lasted longer than many a Hollywood marriage, and now actress Demi Moore, 44, tells Vanity Fair magazine that she and husband Ashton Kutcher, 28, are considering having kids.

 Most definitely, she told the widely-read magazine in its February issue that hit newsstands in New York and Los Angeles yesterday.

 Once you hit three, where youre outnumbered, its really, like: Whats the difference between (three or) four or five?, she said.

 Moore, the star of movies such as G.I. Jane, Ghost and Indecent Proposal, already has three children ages 18, 15 and 13 with former husband, actor Bruce Willis. She and Willis divorced in 2000.

 Moore and Kutcher, who gained fame on televisions That 70s Show, met in 2003 and married two years later. While many Hollywood watchers first took bets on how long they would last, the pair seem to have forged a special bond.

 The actress told Vanity Fair that being married to Kutcher is the best thing that has happened to her.

 If somebody would have said: OK, here is the prediction: Youre going to meet a man 25 years old, and hes going to see being with you and having your three children as a bonus, I would have said: Keep dreaming, Moore said.

 I think it caught us both by surprise, particularly him, she said later, adding that for us, the age was never even a thought because it was really just like meeting somebody Ive always known.

 The magazine said Moores kids now call Kutcher MOD for My Other Dad.

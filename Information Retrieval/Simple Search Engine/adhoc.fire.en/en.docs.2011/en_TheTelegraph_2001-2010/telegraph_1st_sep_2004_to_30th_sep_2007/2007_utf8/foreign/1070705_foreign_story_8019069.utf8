 07/07/07? Forget July 4, let us get hitched

 Washington, July 4: Americas July 4 Independence Day celebrations have been dwarfed this year by a frenzy across this country: the craze to get married on 07/07/07.

 July is normally a slow month in America for weddings, especially in those parts of the country where the heat and sweat can dampen celebrations. But not this year, at least not on July 7.

 The Knot, one of Americas largest wedding planning websites with 1.1 million members, reported this week that 38,000 of its members are making preparations to tie the knot on Saturday. 

 Usually, The Knot handles about 12,000 weddings on a typical July Saturday, but this weekend it is coping with three times that number.

 And businesses have joined in to make hay while the summer sun literally shines. 

 Wal-Mart, the retail company ever eager to scrub off its unpopular public image, jumped into the fray and organised a contest called Lucky in Love Wedding Search. Seven couples who won the contest will wed in the lawn and garden areas of seven of its stores on Saturday. 

 Why an in-store wedding? Because of the huge popularity of 07/07/07 among prospective couples it has been hard to find other places for the nuptials. 

 Many popular wedding sites across America were booked as early as 2005 even as florists and caterers are working overtime this week to accommodate an unusual flurry of orders.

 Some couples-to-be are going to extremes. They not only want to wed on 07/07/07, they even want the wedding to be solemnised at the exact time of 00:07 hours, 07:00 hours or 07:07 hours that morning or a similar time in the evening. Others are serving seven-course meals or planning to walk the church aisle holding seven blooms.

 Caterers say demand for serving Seven and Seven cocktails, made with Seagrams 7 whisky and 7 Up served in a highball glass with ice, at wedding receptions on Saturday have gone up.

 The rich set has ordered wedding rings with seven diamonds. 

 As a thank you gesture for attending 07/07/07 weddings, some couples will give away lottery tickets to their guests. The tickets will have at least one number with 7 from among 7, 17, 27, 37, 47.

 Hoteliers have reported special requests from those getting married this weekend for Room 7 at their establishments. At least one TV news report spoke of a request for a stretch limousine with a 777 number plate to transport the couple after the ceremonies.

 Hopefully, none of those marrying for luck on 07/07/07 will have seven divorces or seven marriages in their later lives.

 It is not just ordinary, superstitious people who have chosen to wed on this presumably lucky Saturday.

 Eva Longoria, the popular TV actress best known in the US for her role in the ABC television series Desperate Housewives will marry basketball star Tony Parker in a castle north of Paris on Saturday.

 Organisers of Independence Day celebrations have planned more than the usual fireworks display tonight to lift Americas mood from a low one caused by the Iraq war, an unpopular government and dislike of the US across the world. On New Yorks East River, for instance, exploding shells will be aimed at the waters surface this year, not at the sky. 

 But it will be the July 7 celebrations, instead, that much of this nation will be preoccupied with. 

 Casinos in Las Vegas are gearing up for the big Saturday when hordes of gamblers are expected to look for the 7-7-7 jackpot on slot machines and others playing Black Jack will seek three sevens to add up to 21.

 In many cities in the US, there will be special screenings of James Bond movies, a tribute to 007.

 Those who are left out of the 07/07/07 festivities could have looked forward to 08/08/08 next year. Unfortunately it falls on a Friday which many consider to be unlucky.

 Musharraf options bleak

 GRIFF WITTE

 Islamabad, Sept. 5: A top 

 adviser to Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf acknowledged 

 yesterday that the generals options for staying in 

 power are increasingly bleak and said that a declaration 

 of emergency is being considered as a way of keeping him 

 in office.

 Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, president of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League, said that while a complete military takeover under martial law had been ruled out, a state of emergency that would allow for the postponement of elections for up to a year and the curtailment of individual liberties was still on the table. 

 Martial law is a very harsh word, Hussain said in an interview. Emergency rule is not so harsh. 

 The comments came on the same day that nearly simultaneous bombs tore through a market and a bus in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, killing 25 people and injuring more than 60 in attacks that seemed to target the Pakistani military. 

 If the President loses before the supreme court, Hussain said, Musharrafs presidency will be over unless he takes one of two steps. He could declare emergency rule, which Hussain called the last option, or he could call parliamentary elections before the presidential vote.

 However, both options would be major gambles. Musharraf seemed on the verge of declaring an emergency last month, reportedly on the advice of Hussain and others. But he backed down under domestic and international pressure. 

 The current parliament is stacked in his favour, but with his popularity in fast decline, there is a strong chance that the new parliament would not elect him.

 A deal with Bhutto could give Musharraf additional leverage, though Hussain, who has been a critic of the negotiations, said he believes there is only a 20 per cent chance of an agreement. Musharrafs opponents expressed concern yesterday that the Rawalpindi attacks may be used as part of a pretext for cancelling polls.

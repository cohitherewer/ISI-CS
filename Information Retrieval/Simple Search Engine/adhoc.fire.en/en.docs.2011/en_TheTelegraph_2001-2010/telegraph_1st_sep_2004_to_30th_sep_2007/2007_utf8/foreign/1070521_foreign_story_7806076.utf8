 Brown bomb ticks on US

 Brown, Bush: An unpredictable relationship? 

 London/Washington, May 20: Gordon Brown is prepared to risk the future of the special relationship with the US by reversing Tony Blairs support for the Iraq war, US President George W. Bush has been warned.

 He has been briefed by White House officials to expect an announcement on British troop withdrawals from Brown during his first 100 days in power. It would be designed to boost the new UK Prime Ministers popularity in the opinion polls.

 Bush recently discussed with a senior White House adviser how to handle the fallout from the expected loss of Washingtons main ally in Iraq, The Sunday Telegraph has learned.

 Details of the talks came as a close ally of Brown called for a quicker withdrawal of British troops. Nigel Griffiths, a former minister, said: We should get out of Iraq as soon as is practicable. We should consult the Iraqi government but they cannot have a veto. This cannot be delayed.

 Griffiths, who resigned as deputy leader of the Commons this year over the decision to replace the Trident nuclear weapons system, spoke out as reports suggested that Brown would use an early trip to Iraq to reassess Britains role and accelerate the withdrawal. Revelation of the US fears will reinforce expectations in Westminster that Brown will make a decisive break with Blairs support for the war.

 During a surprise farewell trip to Iraq yesterday, Blair suggested that his successor would continue his policy. Speaking shortly after a mortar attack by insurgents on Baghdads fortified green zone, he said: I have no doubt at all that Britain will remain steadfast in its support for Iraq, for the Iraqi people and for the Iraqi government as it tries to make sure it overcomes the threat of terrorism and continues to make progress.

 The policy I pursue is one for the whole of the government, so even when I leave government I am sure that support will continue.

 However, it can be revealed that senior figures in the National Security Council, the Pentagon and the state department in Washington have expressed fears about Brown.

 They believe that cordial relations between the two leaders will be at an end if the incoming premier plays gesture politics over Iraq.

 Mark Kirk, a Republican congressman who discussed Iraq policy at the White House last week, said: The American view is that hes a much weaker political leader than Blair. Theres the fear in Washington that he wont be as strong an ally.

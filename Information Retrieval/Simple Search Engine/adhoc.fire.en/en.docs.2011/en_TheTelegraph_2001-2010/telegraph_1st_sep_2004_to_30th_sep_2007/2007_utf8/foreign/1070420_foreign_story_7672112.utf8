 Khaleda aide in bid to block exile

 Dhaka, April 19 (Reuters): A supporter of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia lodged a petition in court today to block efforts by the army-backed government to send her into exile.

 Babul Chowdhury, a member of a front organisation of Khaledas Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), filed the writ in the high court saying it was a human rights violation to force her to leave the country or put her under house arrest. Khaleda has been under virtual confinement at her home for nearly two weeks.

 Sources in the army-backed interim government and Khaledas party said earlier this week she had entered a deal with authorities to go abroad in return for dealing leniently with her jailed elder son and political heir apparent Tarique Rahman.

 Reports said that under the same deal authorities released Khaledas younger son Arafat Rahman just 24 hours after he was detained. But yesterday Khaledas close associates said she had changed her mind and now wanted to stay in Bangladesh.

 The high court said it would examine and rule on the writ on Sunday.

 Analysts said Khaledas decision to fight to stay in the country may have been encouraged by her rival Sheikh Hasinas determination to return to Bangladesh against government orders.

 Vista threat to iPod: Apple

 London, Feb. 6: iPods could be damaged by Microsofts new computer operating system, the company behind the popular digital music players has warned. 

 Apple, the long-standing rival of Bill Gatess Microsoft, is urging users not to upgrade their PCs to the Vista system until it comes up with a compatible version of the software that runs iPods. Microsoft launched its long-awaited Vista operating system in a blaze of publicity last week and claimed that more than 5,000 hardware and software products would work with it. 

 But Apple, which has sold 90 million iPods since 2001, says many users of the iconic portable music players have had problems when connecting them to PCs using Vista. 

 It claims some have found that songs bought on its iTunes Store will not play on the new system, and that other Vista users have even seen their iPods corrupted when they try to unplug them. The contacts and calendar functions on iPods are also said to be affected. A statement on Apples website reads: iTunes Store purchases may not play when upgrading to Windows Vista from Windows 2000 or XP. 

 Ejecting an iPod from the Windows System Tray using the Safely Remove Hardware feature may corrupt your iPod. Microsoft has already released a software update for Vista users so they can play their iTunes Store songs. But Apple is still warning PC users not to use Vista until it can release a completely new version of the iTunes software. Apples website states: Apple recommends that customers wait to upgrade Windows until after the next release of iTunes which will be available in the next few weeks. 

 Microsoft introduced its own music player, the Zune, only last November. This is a place where we are deeply committed to being successful, Gates told the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last month. You are going to see us in this space in a leadership position in the years to come.

 Two days later in San Francisco, Steve Jobs, the flamboyant head of Apple, overshadowed the arrival of Vista by announcing the iPhone, a combined phone, music and video player and handheld computer.

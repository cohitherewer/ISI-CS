 Anger heat on Hillary

 New York, Aug. 3 (Reuters): A man who gets angry at work may well be admired for it but a woman who shows anger in the workplace is liable to be seen as out of control and incompetent, according to a new study presented today.

 Whats more, the finding may have implications for Hillary Clinton as she attempts to become the first female US President, according to its author Victoria Brescoll, a post-doctoral scholar at Yale University.

 Her research paper, When Can Angry Women Get Ahead?, noted that Clinton was described last year by a leading Republican as too angry to be elected President.

 Previous research has indicated that anger can communicate that an individual feels entitled to dominate others, and, therefore, perhaps is. But in a paper to be delivered at a weekend conference, Brescoll said such studies focused on men.

 As Senator Clintons experience suggests, however, for a professional woman anger expression may lead to a decrease rather than an increase in her status, Brescoll wrote.

 She conducted three tests in which men and women recruited randomly watched videos of a job interview and were asked to rate the applicants status and assign them a salary.

 In the first, the scripts were identical except where the candidate described feeling either angry or sad about losing an account due to a colleagues late arrival at a meeting.

 Participants conferred the most status on the man who said he was angry, the second most on the woman who said she was sad, slightly less on the man who said he was sad and least of all by a sizeable margin on the woman who said she was angry.

 The average salary assigned to the angry man was almost $38,000 compared to about $23,500 for the angry woman and in the region of $30,000 for the other two candidates. In a second experiment, the script was similar except that the job applicant also described his or her current occupation as a trainee or a senior executive.

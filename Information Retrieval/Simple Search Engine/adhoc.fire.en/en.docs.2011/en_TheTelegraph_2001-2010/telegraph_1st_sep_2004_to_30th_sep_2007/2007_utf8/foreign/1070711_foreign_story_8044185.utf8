 Senator in DC Madam net

 (Top) Senator David Vitter

 and Deborah Jeane Palfrey 

 Washington, July 10: Republican Senator David Vitter from Louisiana apologised last night after his telephone number appeared in the phone records of the woman dubbed the DC Madam, making him the first member of Congress to become ensnared in the high-profile case.

 The statement containing Vitters apology said his telephone number was included on phone records of Pamela Martin and Associates dating from before he ran for the Senate in 2004.

 The services proprietor, Deborah Jeane Palfrey, 51, faces federal charges of racketeering for allegedly running a prostitution ring out of homes and hotel rooms in the Washington area. 

 Authorities say the business netted more than $2 million over 13 years beginning in 1993. Palfrey contends that her escort service was a legitimate business.

 This was a very serious sin in my past for which I am, of course, completely responsible, Vitter, 46, said, which his spokesman, Joel DiGrado, confirmed.

 Several years ago, I asked for and received forgiveness from God and my wife in confession and marriage counselling, Vitter continued. 

 Out of respect for my family, I will keep my discussion of the matter there with God and them. But I certainly offer my deep and sincere apologies to all I have disappointed and let down in any way.

 Neither Palfrey nor her attorney, Montgomery Blair Sibley, could be reached for comment last night. Sibley said his client posted the phone records of her escort service on the Internet yesterday, four days after a federal judge lifted a restraining order preventing their publication. 

 The records were included in a series of files on a website devoted to Palfreys legal defence fund.

 Im stunned that someone would be apologising for this already, Sibley said.

 Vitter is in his first Senate term after serving six years in the House. During his Senate campaign, Vitter was accused by a member of the Louisiana Republican State Central Committee of carrying on a lengthy affair with a prostitute in New Orleanss French Quarter.

 In a radio interview, Vitter then called the allegation absolutely and completely untrue and dismissed it as just crass Louisiana politics.

 Vitter was the first senator to endorse former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for President and serves as the campaigns southern regional chairman. A reliable conservative vote in the Senate, Vitter was among a small group of Republican lawmakers who sought to block an immigration overhaul from advancing last month.

 Vitter and his wife, Wendy, a former prosecutor, have four children. On his Senate website, Vitter says he is committed to advancing mainstream conservative principles.

 Vitter attended Harvard University and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University. He won a convincing victory in 2004, defeating two Democrats with a slim majority of the vote, to succeed Democrat John Breaux .

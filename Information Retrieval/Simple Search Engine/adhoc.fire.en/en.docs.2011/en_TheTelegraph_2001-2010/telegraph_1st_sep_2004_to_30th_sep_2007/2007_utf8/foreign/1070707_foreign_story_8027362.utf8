 iPhone hacked for Net amp; music

 An iPhone

 Menlo Park, California, July 6 (Reuters): A well-known hacker claims to have overcome restrictions on Apples iPhone, allowing highly technical users to bypass AT amp;Ts network to use the phones Internet and music features.

 In a post dated July 3 on his blog, Jon Johansen, 23, a prolific hacker of consumer electronics gadgets since he was a teenager in Norway, said: Ive found a way to activate a brand new unactivated iPhone without signing up for AT amp;Ts service.

 The iPhone does not have phone capability, but the iPod and Wi-Fi work. Stay tuned! he wrote on his long-running blog, which is combatively named So Sue Me. The post was entitled iPhone Independence Day, a play on the July 4 US holiday.

 The site contained technical details for other hackers, as well as links to software necessary to complete the process.

 One potential use would be for an iPhone user living or travelling outside the US to access the iPhones music player and Internet service over Wi-Fi connections without using the phone. Apple has yet to reveal network operator deals in markets outside the US.

 AT amp;T spokesperson Mark Siegel said it was necessary to activate the iPhone on AT amp;Ts network to ensure optimum performance. Using the phone without AT amp;Ts two-year service contract was unauthorised under the phone carriers exclusive US network service contract with Apple, Siegel added.

 He did not elaborate on potential action AT amp;T might take.

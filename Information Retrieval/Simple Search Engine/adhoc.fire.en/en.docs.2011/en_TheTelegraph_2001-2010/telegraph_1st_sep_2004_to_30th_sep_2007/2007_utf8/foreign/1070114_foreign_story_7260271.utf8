 Molly mulls joining Islamabad madarsa

 Molly: Time to choose

 Islamabad, Jan. 13: Molly Campbell, the 12-year-old girl at the heart of a custody battle between her Scottish mother and Pakistani British father, has returned to Lahore after living in Islamabad for a month where she was reportedly considering enrolling at a religious school.

 Molly was convinced by her father, Sajad Rana, to return home with him for fear that her staying away could affect a Supreme Court hearing, set for January 17. The young girl ran away from her mothers home in the Western Isles last August to live with her father, sister and two brothers in Lahore.

 A court ruled last month that she should return to Britain, but last week Mollys mother, Louise Campbell, 38, offered to drop her demand citing psychological strain caused by the dispute. 

 On Wednesday, both parties are supposed to present a written agreement to court explaining how they might share access to their daughter in an out of court settlement. Rana, however, has already indicated he would not allow Molly to return to Scotland where he claims she suffered because of her mothers alleged non-religious lifestyle.

 The young girl, known in Pakistan as Misbah Rana, has indicated a desire to stay with her father in Lahore and called on both her parents to allow her to choose where she lives. While she was staying with a family in the Pakistani capital, she reportedly considered enrolling at madarsa in the city. Abudur Rashid Ghazi, the schools administrator, said yesterday she had visited his institution and enquired casually about the classes but left without applying to enrol.

 Rana told The Daily Telegraph: In fact, she is in the process of looking and finding some institution where she could do her levels and get some religious education. But it appears he became concerned over publicity surrounding his daughters time away from Lahore. Khalid Khwaja, who now runs a human rights charity, said she stayed with his family after they met during court hearings over her case.

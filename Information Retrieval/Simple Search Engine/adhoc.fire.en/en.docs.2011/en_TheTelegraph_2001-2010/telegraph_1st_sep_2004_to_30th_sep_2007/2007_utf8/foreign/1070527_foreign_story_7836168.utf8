 Grisly US attack on India family

 Anaheim (California), May 26 (AP): Charred remains found on a hiking trail earlier this week have been identified as those of the father of an Indian family that was brutally attacked and their house burned, authorities said.

 The coroner used dental records to determine the remains were those of 56-year-old Jayprakash Dhanak, Anaheim police said yesterday.

 Dhanak is the father of Karishma Dhanak, 20, whose body was also found on the bike trail. Police found the mother, Leela Dhanak, unconscious and badly beaten outside the burning home on Monday. The bodies of Jayprakash Dhanak and his daughter were found on Tuesday after someone noticed smoke coming from a hiking trail 32 km from the home.

 Another daughter, Shayona, 18, was elsewhere when the attack occurred and was under police protection. Leela Dhanak remained hospitalised with severe injuries to her head and upper body, which has prevented investigators from speaking with her. The family immigrated from India years ago. Local newspapers said they had been in California at least since the early 1980s, were active in the Indian community and were devout Hindus.

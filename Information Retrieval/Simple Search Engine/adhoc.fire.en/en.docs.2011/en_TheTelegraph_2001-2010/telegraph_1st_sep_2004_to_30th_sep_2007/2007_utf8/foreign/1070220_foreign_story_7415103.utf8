 Arrest in UK letter bomb case

 London, Feb. 19 (Reuters): British police arrested a man today in connection with a series of letter bombs in the last two months and said they could not rule out the possibility that another similar device was still in the postal system.

 Assistant chief constable Anton Setchell said in a statement that a man in his 20s was arrested in the eastern English city of Cambridge and was being held at a police station. 

 He described the arrest as very significant and said: At this stage I am not able to guarantee that there is not another postal package containing an explosive device within the postal system.

 At least 10 people were hurt by five letter bombs which exploded between January 18 and February 7, although no one was seriously injured. Two other bombs were detected before they went off.

 In one of the worst attacks, six people were hurt in Swansea, south Wales, on February 7 when the seventh letter bomb exploded at the offices of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency.

 The devices were all contained in A5-size padded envelopes.

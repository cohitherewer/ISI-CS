 No babies right now: Paltrow

 Two is enough

 New York, Aug. 11 (AP): Gwyneth Paltrow, who has two children with husband Chris Martin, says she is not ready to have more babies.

 I dont think so. Well, definitely not right away, the 34-year-old actress tells W magazine in its September issue, on newsstands on August 17.

 Paltrow and Martin, the lead singer of Coldplay, have a 3-year-old daughter, Apple, and 1-year-old son, Moses.

 I have a dream version where I think, maybe in four years Ill have two in a row really quickly again how fabulous to have a whole bunch of them! she says. But then at that point, when everyones potty-trained and sleeping through the night, are you really going to go back?

 Id also like to work a bit. My husband really wants to adopt, she says. So I dont know; Im sort of open for anything.

 Paltrow, who won a best-actress Oscar for 1998s Shakespeare in Love, had small roles in last years Running With Scissors and Infamous.

 Her upcoming films include The Good Night, directed by her brother, Jake Paltrow, and Iron Man, co-starring Robert Downey Jr.

 Its been a long time since Ive done a big part in a movie, and Im very excited about work now, she says.

 The actress was recovering from knee surgery when she was interviewed by the magazine last month. I bashed it on some furniture over Memorial Day weekend at the Malibu, California, home of Steven Spielberg, says Paltrow.

 I always try to do everything all at once, and to do it perfectly, she says. I think it was the universe saying to me: Just stop. You dont have to make yourself crazy.

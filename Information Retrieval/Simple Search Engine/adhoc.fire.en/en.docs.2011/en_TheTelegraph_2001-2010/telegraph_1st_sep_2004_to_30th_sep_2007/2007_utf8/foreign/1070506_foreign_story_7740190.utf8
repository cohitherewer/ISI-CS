 London, May 5 (PTI): Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed has filed a case against British Airways claiming over a million pounds in damages for denying her a boarding pass to a flight to Dhaka on April 23.

 In the five-page legal notice issued to the BA managing director on Hasinas behalf, the Awami Leagues legal action committee claimed that Hasina, who is also the party chief, had suffered grave mental stress and agony after being denied a boarding pass despite having a valid ticket and passport.

 It gave BA two weeks time to reply to the notice.

 Former supreme court judge Shamsuddin Choudhury, who is the chairman of the committee, said: Sheikh Hasina is determined to pursue her remedy through law suit, claiming damages to the tune of over a million pounds for the humiliation she suffered and the damage caused to her image, he said.

 Hasina, who is leaving for Dhaka tomorrow night, told reporters at a dinner last night: I have left it to my partys legal action committee and solicitors to file the suit and they will look after it.

 Asked about her future plans, the 60-year-old daughter of Bangladeshs founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman said: First, I want to go back to my country. Then I will see. I have faith in our people and they will decide.

 On whether the military-backed interim government would restore democracy, Hasina, who was the Prime Minister between 1996 and 2001, said: We have our past experience with military government. How can they give democracy. They can give martial democracy not peoples democracy. 

 However, she added: I would not like to predict anything. First let me go back and observe the situation.

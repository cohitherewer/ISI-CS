 Water planet found

 Washington, April 11 (Reuters): Evidence of water has been detected for the first time in a planet outside our solar system, an astronomer said yesterday, a tantalising find for scientists eager to know whether life exists beyond Earth.

 Travis Barman, an astronomer at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, said water vapour has been found in the atmosphere of a large, Jupiter-like gaseous planet located 150 light years from Earth in the constellation Pegasus. 

 The planet is known as HD 209458b. Other scientists reported in February that they were unable to find evidence of water in this planets atmosphere, as well as another Jupiter-like planet.

 Im very confident, Barman said. Its definitely good news because water has been predicted to be present in the atmosphere of this planet and many of the other ones for some time.

 Lowell Observatory, a privately owned astronomical research institution, announced the finding, which has been accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal. The research was backed by Nasa, it said. The detection of the presence of water vapour was possible because this planet, from the vantage point of Earth, orbits directly in front of its star every three-and-a-half days, allowing crucial measurements to be made. It is what is known as a transiting planet.

 Scientists searching for signs of life beyond Earth are keen to learn about the presence of water on other planets both in and beyond our solar system.

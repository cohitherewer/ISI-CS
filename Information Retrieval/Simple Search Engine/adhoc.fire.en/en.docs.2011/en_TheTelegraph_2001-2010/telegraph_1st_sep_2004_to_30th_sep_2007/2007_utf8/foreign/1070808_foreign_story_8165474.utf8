 Glaucoma early warning for Alzheimers

 ROGER HIGHFIELD AND STEPHEN ADAMS

 London, Aug. 7: A major link between Alzheimers and glaucoma has been discovered by British scientists that could lead to the eye disease being regarded as an early warning for dementia.

 Scientists at University College London (UCL) found a clear link between what causes Alzheimers and one of the basic mechanisms behind glaucoma, it is revealed today.

 The research could speed up the development of new treatments for Alzheimers and revolutionise the treatment of glaucoma, the most common cause of blindness.

 If glaucoma is confirmed as a major risk factor for Alzheimers then the early warning signs it gives could help ensure that patients have more opportunities to delay the onset of dementia using drugs.

 The researchers discovered that the same plaque proteins are a key process in the development of both diseases. Clumps or plaques of beta-amyloid proteins, which kill brain cells in Alzheimers patients, also kill optic nerve cells in the eyes of glaucoma sufferers.

 Dr Francesca Cordeiro, who led the team at UCLs Institute of Ophthalmology, said: Weve seen for the first time that there is a clear link between what causes Alzheimers and one of the basic mechanisms behind glaucoma.

 Iran-origin mayor for Beverly Hills

 Jimmy Delshad

 Beverly Hills, March 28 (AP): The citys first Iranian-American mayor was sworn in late yesterday.

 Jimmy Delshad, 66, won re-election to the city council earlier this month, which placed him in line to become mayor. His inauguration ceremony was attended by several hundred people.

 Many people were asking whether Beverly Hills was ready to elect a Persian American to the city council, Delshad said. I told anyone who asked that I think Beverly Hills is ready to make sure every citizen felt welcome to set forward and make contributions to civic life.

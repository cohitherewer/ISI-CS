 Islamabad, April 10 (PTI): Two radical clerics, who issued a fatwa against tourism minister Nilofar Bakhtiar yesterday for posing in a picture with French paragliders, have said that they were not aware of any such decree.

 Maulana Abdul Aziz and his deputy and brother Maulana Abdul Rashid Ghazi expressed ignorance about any fatwa against Bakhtiar. The clerics said they had issued no such decree, the Online News Agency reported.

 The turnaround by the clerics comes after a government team, led by Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid-e-Azam) president Shujaat Hussain, urged the radicals to give up their plans to impose shariat law in Islamabad.

 Several media organisations in Pakistan have copies of the fatwa which alleges that Bakhtiar committed a sin and sullied the name of the Islamic world.

 The photograph of her hugging a male paragliding instructor cannot be tolerated by any religion or a respectable man, and, therefore, it becomes the obligation of the government to remove her as minister and punish her, the two-page fatwa said.

 Reacting to the fatwa, Bakhtiar, currently campaigning to popularise Pakistan as a tourist destination, said today that she would not hesitate to jump again for a good cause. We dont need to be intimidated by these people, she said

 Newspapers said Bakhtiar did the jump from an aircraft to raise funds for survivors of an earthquake in Pakistan in October 2005.

 I have no regrets, said Bakhtiar. I would do it again happily if it helps the people of Pakistan.

 Education minister General (retd) Javed Ashraf Qazi said the Jamia Hafza girls seminary, which is right next door to the Red Mosque, was illegal as it was constructed on government land and called for its immediate demolition.

 In a separate development, the government said today it had blocked the Red Mosques website, saying that it was inciting hate. Clerics at the mosque had launched a website last week as part of a unilateral anti-vice campaign in which students from their nearby Jamia Hafza seminary kidnapped an alleged brothel owner and forced her to repent in public.

 The www.lalmasjid.org site is no longer accessible, and Tariq Aziz, minister of state for information, confirmed that the government had blocked it for distributing hate material. 

 He provided no further details.

 The mosque compound has taken on the form of a rebel camp, with young men armed with sticks posted at the gates and at look-out points along banner-strewn walls. 

 Two or three men have been seen with guns which the clerics say are properly licensed.

 Falling in love amp; losing Harry

 For the last several years, AP National Writer Allen G. Breed has taken his daughter, Miana, to the midnight release of the latest Harry Potter book and written a first-person story about the joy and angst of watching Miana and Harry grow up.

 Miana is 14 now, a rising high schooler and a writer in her own right. She tells readers in her own words what its meant to grow up with Harry.

 Wake Forest (North Carolina), July 20 (AP): My generation has grown up with Harry Potter. Weve grown attached to him whether on purpose or by just hearing Daniel Radcliffe say: Expecto Patronum! on-screen and we dont want to let him go.

 First, we fell in love with the wonderful books based on his adventures and then we fell in love with the movies that brought this story to life. Weve grown attached to Harry and his merry band of mischievous pals. Weve sympathised with him when he mourned for his parents. Weve felt hatred with him when he confronted Malfoy. Weve felt happiness with him when he found love.

 To me, the end of this series coincides with the ending of middle school seeing all your friends go, wondering if youll ever see them again, crying while you hug those who are gone forever. Losing Harry is just like losing one of my best friends.

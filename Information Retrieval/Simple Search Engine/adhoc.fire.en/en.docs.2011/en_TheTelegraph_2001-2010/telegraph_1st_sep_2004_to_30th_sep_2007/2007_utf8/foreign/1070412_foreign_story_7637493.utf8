 Rabat, April 11 (Reuters): 

 Moroccan security forces were hunting more suspected suicide 

 bombers a day after four were killed in Casablanca, newspapers 

 reported today.

 Three suspected bombers detonated their explosive belts, killing themselves and at least one police officer and wounding more than 20 people in a police raid on a safe house in which a fourth was shot dead, police sources said.

 Moroccan security forces are pursuing their search of a gang of people wearing explosive belts that threaten the safety of the citizens and the countrys security, said leading pro-government Arabic-language Al Alam daily. 

 The four were killed a day before a series of bombings in Algiers, capital of neighbouring Algeria where al Qaida seeks to bring together radical groups in the region.

 Among the four dead suspects, police named Ayoub Raidy, brother of Abdellatif Raidy who killed himself at an Internet cafe on March 11 in the Sidi Moumen slum to avoid arrest. The government says Abdellatif Raidy, a 23-year-unemployed man, was the leader of a ring of more than 50 radical Islamists that included an unknown number of suspected bombers. 

 Analysts questioned governments assertions that such Islamist Jihadists were home-grown and posed no serious threat to security because they lacked experience. I think there are links abroad, said Moroccan analyst Mohamed Darif. The authorities will have to correct their interpretation after yesterdays events.

 Tornado slams into US town

 Kansas City (Montana), May 5 (Reuters): A tornado wiped out most of a small farming town in southwestern Kansas, killing seven people and injuring at least 63, emergency officials said today.

 The funnel cloud hit Greensburg yesterday evening, smashing buildings, overturning vehicles and knocking out communications towers. Aerial television news footage showed ruins throughout the community of about 1,800 people.

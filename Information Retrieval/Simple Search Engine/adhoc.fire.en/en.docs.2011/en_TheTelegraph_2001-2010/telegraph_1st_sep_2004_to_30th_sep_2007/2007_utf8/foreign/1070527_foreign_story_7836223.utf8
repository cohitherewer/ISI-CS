 Washington, May 27 (AP): A long-time Indian-born Clinton benefactor used corporate jets to fly the former President and Hillary Rodham Clinton on business, personal and campaign trips that a lawsuit brands as wasteful company spending.

 The supporter, Vinod Gupta, also secured contracts worth more than $3 million for Bill Clinton to provide consulting services to Guptas Nebraska-based company, infoUSA, from 2003 to 2008, according to the suit.

 Since 2002, Gupta spent $900,000 flying the former President to international locations on presidential foundation business and flying Hillary Clinton, a Democratic Senator from New York, to political events.

 Gupta has said in interviews that he is from the village of Rampur, Uttar Pradesh. He is an IIT graduate and moved to the US in the late 1960s.

 The suit, filed by infoUSA shareholders last year, claims those expenses as well as millions of others unrelated to the Clintons were a serial misuse of corporate assets and resources. The Clintons are not a party to the suit. Details of the suit were first reported in February by The Deal publication.

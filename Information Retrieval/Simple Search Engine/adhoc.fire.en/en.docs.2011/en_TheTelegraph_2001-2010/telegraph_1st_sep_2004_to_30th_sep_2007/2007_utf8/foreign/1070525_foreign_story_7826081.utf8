 48m lottery for ex-wife

 John, Beverley 

 London, May 24 (Reuters): A British multi-millionaire businessman today declared the divorce courts alimony system a lottery after losing an appeal against his ex-wifes record-breaking, 48 million settlement.

 Insurance underwriter John Charman, 54, had challenged the size of the award to his former wife Beverley, 53, made by the high courts family division last year. He had offered her 20 million. It was the highest sum ever awarded by a British divorce court.

 Judge Paul Coleridge said at the time Beverley of Sevenoaks, Kent, deserved half her husbands money because it had been a long marriage during which all the wealth was generated from scratch.

 And today, president of the high court family division, Sir Mark Potter, sitting with Lords Justices Matthew Thorpe and Nicholas Wilson backed the high court decision.

 Beverley said outside court afterwards: I acknowledge that the sum awarded to me is huge by any standards, but the Court of Appeal has decided that it fairly reflects the contributions made by John and me during our 28-year marriage.

 Her ex-husband said he intended to appeal, and branded the English family legal system a mess.

 It is muddled, incomprehensible and lags behind that in most other countries, he said after the case. Its now all something of a lottery and has little to do with fairness or justice. 

 I am just the latest high earner to be penalised by this flawed system.

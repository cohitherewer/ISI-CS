 Pervez, Benazir in secret meet

 Musharraf, Bhutto

 Islamabad, July 27 (Reuters): Speculation intensified today that Pakistans embattled President Pervez Musharraf and former Premier Benazir Bhutto will form a power-sharing pact, as television channels reported they met secretly in Abu Dhabi.

 Musharraf flew to the Gulf state earlier in the day, and was expected to return on Sunday, after also visiting Saudi Arabia.

 Three television channels Geo News, Aaj TV and Dawn News said Bhutto had also gone there from London and the two met secretly, but state-run Pakistan Television said officials had denied the reports.

 Musharrafs spokesman former general Rashid Qureshi scoffed at the reports, while Wajid Shamsul Hasan, a close aide to Bhutto in London, said he was unaware of any meeting.

 Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, the leader of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League, was more forthcoming when speaking to Aaj.

 I dont know about the meeting, but this issue was discussed when we met the President the day before yesterday and we said doors should not be closed for such contacts, Hussain said.

 US ally Musharraf is going through the weakest period of his eight-year rule, and a supreme court decision last week to reinstate a chief justice he had spent four months trying to sack raised questions about his ability to secure a second five-year term with elections due by the turn of the year.

 The National Assembly is scheduled to be dissolved in November, and elections should be held in December or January.

 Musharraf had wanted to secure his own re-election from the outgoing Assembly, but the supreme court decision last week made it more likely constitutional challenges to his plan would succeed.

 An alliance with two-time Premier Bhutto could be his last chance, analysts say, unless he goes back on his word not to declare a state of emergency.

 Musharraf has had no public engagements, and made no television appearances in the wake of the court decision and rumours have inevitably filled the void left by his silence.

 Today one newspaper, The News, ran a front-page story, citing anonymous sources, saying that Musharrafs fellow generals had advised him to step down.

 A day earlier two papers, Dawn and The Nation, reported Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz was under pressure to be the fall guy over the chief justice fiasco. For days there have been expectations heads would roll, the law minister and attorney-general among them. But none have.

 Instead a sense of Musharrafs isolation grew, fuelling feverish speculation the military democracy Pakistan had lived under since a 1999 coup was coming to an end.

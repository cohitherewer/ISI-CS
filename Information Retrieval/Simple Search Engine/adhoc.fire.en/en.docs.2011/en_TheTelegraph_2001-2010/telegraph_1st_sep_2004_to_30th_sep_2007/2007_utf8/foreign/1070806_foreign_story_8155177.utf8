 Dome bomber killed

 Baghdad, Aug. 5 (AP): US troops killed the al Qaida mastermind of bombings at a prized Shia shrine, officials said today.

 Haitham Sabah Shaker Mohammed al-Badri was the al Qaida in Iraq emir of Salahuddin province, and the figure responsible for two bombings at the Golden Dome mosque in Samarra, the US military said. 

 He died in a US operation east of Samarra on Thursday, though his death was announced three days later.

 Al-Badris body was positively identified by close associates and family members, Rear Admiral Mark Fox, a US military spokesperson, told reporters today.

 Al-Badri had been a suspect in a June 13 attack which toppled the Askariya shrines twin minarets, as well as in an earlier bombing, in February 2006, which destroyed the same mosques golden dome and set in motion an unrelenting cycle of retaliatory sectarian bloodletting.

 Fox said US aircraft spotted al-Badri among insurgents moving into tactical fighting positions on the ground.

 From the surveillance that was going on, it looked like they were setting up an ambush, he said in the heavily guarded Green Zone. So they brought in rotary wing and close air support and there was some strafing that occurred from helicopters, he said.

 Another 80 suspects were detained in US and Iraqi raids in the Samarra area over the past week, the US military said in a statement. More than 1,000 Iraqi soldiers and police took part in the giant operation, backed by US paratroopers, it said.

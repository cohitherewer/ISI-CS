 New Berry

 A BlackBerry 

 New York, Feb. 12 (AP): BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd today unveiled a new version of its top-end email phone for business users, replacing the signature side navigation wheel with a front trackball that first appeared last year on the consumer-oriented BlackBerry Pearl.

 The BlackBerry 8800 will be offered in the US by AT amp;T Incs Cingular Wireless from February 21, priced at $300 with a two-year contract commitment.

 The new device enters a far more crowded market for multifunction smart phones than the 8700 did when it was launched in late 2005. Back then, the main competition was Palm Incs Treo.

 RIM is billing the 8800 as the thinnest BlackBerry to date, measuring 0.55 inch from front to back. Thats just a hair thinner than the Pearls 0.57-inch thickness, but 0.2 inch thinner than the 8700 model that the 8800 will replace over time. 

 The 8800 is also a shade narrower than the 8700 from right to left, but slightly taller. Other features include the ability to pick up signals from global positioning system, or GPS, satellites for location tracking. The device comes installed with BlackBerry maps, an application that can use the GPS signal to provide driving directions as well as integrate with other applications.

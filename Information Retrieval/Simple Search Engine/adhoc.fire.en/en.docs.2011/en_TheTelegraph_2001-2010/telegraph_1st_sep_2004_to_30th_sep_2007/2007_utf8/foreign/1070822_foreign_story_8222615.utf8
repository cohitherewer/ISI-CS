 Demon dwarf

 Edinburgh, Aug. 21 (AFP): A dwarf performer at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival had to be rushed to hospital after his penis got stuck to a vacuum cleaner during an act that went horribly awry.

 Daniel Blackner, or Captain Dan the Demon Dwarf, was due to perform at the Circus of Horrors at the festival known for its oddball, offbeat performances.

 The main part of his act saw him appear on stage with a vacuum cleaner attached to his member through a special attachment.

 The attachment broke before the performance and blackner tried to fix it using extra-strong glue, but unfortunately only let it dry for 20 seconds instead of the 20 minutes required. He then joined it directly to his organ. The end result? A solid attachment, laughter, mortification and ... Hospitalisation.

 It was the most embarrassing moment of my life when I got wheeled into a packed auditorium with a vacuum attached to me, Blackner said.

 Top trick

 Shirley, New York (AP): Male drivers who paid $5 for a topless car wash in New York city ended up getting doused with disappointment. Scantily- clad women held up signs along a parkway advertising the car wash and telling the drivers where to go. But hidden behind a big blue tarp, there were shirtless male firefighters who were washing the cars. A little bit of a bait-and-switch, assistant chief Donald Prince admitted. All the guys back there are all topless. Female drivers did not seem to mind the shirtless firefighters.

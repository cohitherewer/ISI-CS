 Prachanda slams royal proposal

 J. HEMANTH 

 Kathmandu , June 18: The Maoists today rejected Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koiralas proposal to save the monarchy and said that they will not rest till the institution was abolished. 

 Koirala had suggested yesterday that the monarchy can survive if King Gyanendras five-year-old grandson Hridayendra was annointed as the new king.

 Maoist chief Prachanda said Koiralas proposal would gravely affect the unity of the eight-party alliance. Talking to reporters after addressing Maoist lawmakers in parliament, Prachanda said Koiralas comments were against the spirit of the interim constitution. 

 Koiralas statement is totally unacceptable as the interim constitution does not envisage any form of monarchy in Nepal, he said.

 Prachanda said the statement comes exactly a week after parliament adopted a resolution which seeks to abolish the monarchy through a two-thirds vote in parliament.

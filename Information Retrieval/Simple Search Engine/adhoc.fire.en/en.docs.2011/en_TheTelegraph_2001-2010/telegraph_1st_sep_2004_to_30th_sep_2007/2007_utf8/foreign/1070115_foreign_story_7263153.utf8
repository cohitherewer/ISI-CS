 Mickeys army on the rampage 

 JACQUI GODDARD

 Attacking mood 

 Los Angeles, Jan. 14: As neighbours of the worlds most famous mouse, the townsfolk of Apopka, 25 miles from Walt Disney World, might be expected to have a soft spot for rodents. 

 But when hundreds of thousands of the creatures invaded their community, it was clear that there could be no mercy for Mickeys marauding cousins. 

 With mice scuttling into homes and businesses, nibbling electrical wires and plumbing, and even infiltrating office vending machines, the people of the Florida town mounted a civil defence operation. 

 Officials set up a rodent command post from where they marshalled eradication efforts, and established a mouse hotline for locals to call for help. Even a squadron of orphaned barn owls from a bird rescue sanctuary was pressed into action. 

 Now, after a three-month campaign that has cost several hundred thousand dollars, Apopka and its 31,000 human residents are beginning to scent victory over the interlopers. 

 Theories about the cause of the infestation range from an abundance of acorns and uncut brush, which may have attracted the mice, to a population explosion triggered by lunar cycles.

 NY fakes fund terror 

 New York, Feb. 12 (Reuters): A false door at the back of a cramped New York city store swings open to reveal a secret room lined with fake Prada, Gucci and Fendi bags and wallets.

 Its very cloak-and-dagger, said a British tourist, who declined to give her name and who was lured to the store by a smooth salesman prowling Canal Street in New Yorks Chinatown.

 Fake designer bags are part of a $500 billion global trade in counterfeit goods, and US authorities say some of that money funds terrorism.

 In the year between October 2005 and September 2006 the department of homeland security made 14,000 counterfeit goods seizures worth $155 million, almost double the previous year.

 In New York alone the trade was worth $80 billion and costs the city $1 billion a year in lost sales tax revenue.

 Its virtually all profit and it isnt funding anything good. It is a threat to democracy and a threat to the rule of law, New York police commissioner Raymond Kelly told a conference on counterfeiting on February 1.

 Kelly said the group accused of the 2004 Madrid train bombings, which killed 191 people, used proceeds from the sale of fake CDs. US authorities have said a group sells counterfeit goods including fake Viagra to support Hizbollah. But while a US crackdown on counterfeit goods has pushed fakes into back roooms, in Asia sales are more blatant.

 Iran frees detained US scholar

 Haleh Esfandiari

 Tehran, Aug. 21 (Reuters): Iran today released a US-Iranian academic, who had been detained on security-related charges since May, after payment of 3 billion rials ($320,000) bail.

 I thank all the people who made an effort ... so that I can go home now, Haleh Esfandiari told a reporter from Iranian state television as she stood outside the gates of Evin prison in Tehran where she had been held.

 The footage showed her walking towards a small group of people standing outside the jail. Her lawyer, Nobel Peace laureate Shirin Ebadi, had said her family had gone to the prison to pick her up and that she was now at home.

 Iran has accused Esfandiari of involvement in what it says is a US-led plot to topple its clerical establishment in a soft revolution. Washington has dismissed the allegation.

 Im happy that the judiciary and the Islamic revolutionary court finally accepted the law and released my client on bail, Ebadi said. Esfandiaris family had paid the bail.

 Esfandiari was detained in early May while on a visit to Tehran to see her elderly mother.

 In Washington, US state department spokesman Gonzalo Gallegos said that Esfandiari and three other Iranian Americans who have been detained or otherwise prevented from leaving Iran have done nothing wrong ... and should be free right now.

 On August 12, Irans judicial authorities said they had completed their investigations into Esfandiari and another detained Iranian-American, Kian Tajbakhsh. A third US-Iranian is also being held while a fourth is already out on bail. Ebadi said Esfandiari was now legally allowed to leave the country. Parnaz Azima, the dual national earlier freed on bail, has been unable to leave because the authorities kept her passport, rights groups say.

 Last month, Iranian television aired confessions by Esfandiari and Tajbakhsh, which the foreign ministry said had revealed a US-backed plot to overthrow Irans clerical rulers. The US denounced the broadcast as illegitimate and coerced.

 Esfandiari, wearing a headscarf and long coat covering her body as required by Irans strict Islamic dress codes, praised the prison staff and her treatment, even during interrogation. The gentlemen that I had contact with regarding interrogation were extraodinary, polite and respectful, she said.

 Maoist backing

 J. HEMANTH 

 Kathmandu, Feb. 1: As the Terai region in southern Nepal continued to be rocked by violent clashes, the Maoists today decided to join ranks with the Madhesis, saying their demands were legitimate and needed to be addressed positively by the multi- party government. 

 Addressing a news conference here today, Maoist chief Prachanda said that his party would be forced to launch a peaceful agitation if the twin demands of the Madhesis, federal governance and proportional electoral system, are not implemented. The two demands are legitimate and in consonance with the demands of our party, Prachanda said. He added that the Madhesi demands are directly linked to the Maoist objective of a republican governance. All the demands raised by the Terai people are also our demands, Prachanda said. 

 In fresh violence today, police opened fire on hundreds of protesters attacking government buildings in Inaruwa, 300 km southeast of Kathmandu, killing three persons, officials said.

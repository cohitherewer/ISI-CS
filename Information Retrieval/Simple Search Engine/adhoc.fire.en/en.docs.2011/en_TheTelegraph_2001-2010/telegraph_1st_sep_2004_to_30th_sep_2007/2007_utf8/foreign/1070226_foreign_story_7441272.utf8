 Kathmandu, Feb. 25: Embarrassed by the exodus of Peoples Liberation Army personnel from special cantonments across Nepal, the multi-party government today decided to provide a daily allowance of Rs 60 to each member of the Maoist army.

 The decision was taken at an informal meeting of the council of ministers, chaired by Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala at his official residence here this morning. 

 The meeting discussed the desertions by PLA members and conceded that the government needed to ensure their upkeep.

 After the meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Amik Sherchan said the decision would be ratified at the next cabinet meeting. He said todays meeting had also decided to release an additional Rs 5 crore to the Maoists for the management of the 28 cantonments spread across several districts. 

 The meeting was convened in the wake of large-scale desertion by PLA combatants who were moving out in search of livelihood following severe food shortage at the designated camps.

 Although the combatants have returned to the camps at the insistence of various quarters, including the UN, the Maoist leadership stepped up pressure on the government to ensure basic needs, such as food, at the camps. 

 For the second successive day today, Maoist cadre clashed with activists of the agitating Madhesi Peoples Rights Forum in the volatile Terai region bordering India.

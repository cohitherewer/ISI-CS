The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Sandra first felt partner was bigot

 New York, Feb. 14 (AP): Before she got to know him, Sandra Bullock says she thought of her husband, mechanic and reality TV star Jesse James, as a brutish bigot.

 I assumed he was a homophobic chauvinist, a bigot who killed people, she says in an interview for In Style magazines March issue. And later I felt saddened by my assumptions because I wondered how many times had I written off people who truly were real.

 Of James, she now says: I finally felt I had a net for the real me.

 Bullock, 42, and the 37-year-old James, who hosts The Discovery Channels Monster Garage, married in California in July 2005.

 The star of the upcoming Sony Pictures thriller Premonition says she aims to be as cognizant of nurturing her marriage as she is focused on her career. You know how you see sweet relationships not work because of time spent apart? Going for more than five days without seeing Jesse is hard, she says.

 People are so good at attending to their jobs, their plants, their pets. Why is it that when it comes to a relationship, we just sort of go, oh, its here. It should just work. It doesnt! And please, she says, do not ask her why she is not pregnant.

 Lennon mind

 Alexandria (Virginia), March 31 (AP): Sean Lennon is accustomed to people recognising him because of his famous parents, but one incident really caught him off-guard.

 When I was 15, a cabdriver asked me if I was Paul McCartneys daughter, the 31-year-old singer told AP Radio in a recent interview. That really blew my mind.

 Lennon said he usually finds himself unfazed by all the attention he gets as the son of Yoko Ono and former Beatle John Lennon, who was killed in New York city in 1980.

 I dont have any perspective on a life without people freaking out about my parents, so I dont know what it would be like for that not to happen, he said.

 People only have glimpses of like, you know, who I might be and I dont think people have a real sense of what Im like necessarily, he said.

 Hiroshima fells Japan minister

 Tokyo, July 3 (Reuters): Japans defence minister resigned today over remarks that appeared to accept the 1945 atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, attempting to quell the latest furore plaguing the ruling camp ahead of an election this month.

 Prime Minister Shinzo Abes support rates have already been slashed by outrage over government mishandling of pension records, and defence minister Fumio Kyumas perceived gaffe has been adding to his headaches before the July 29 upper house poll.

 Abe tapped national security adviser Yuriko Koike, 54, a former environment minister who speaks fluent English and Arabic, to succeed Kyuma and become Japans first female defence minister. She will be sworn in tomorrow.

 I regret that my comments have caused trouble. I am very sorry, Kyuma whose election district includes Nagasaki told reporters, adding that Abe had accepted his offer to resign.

 Kyuma had apologised several times and Abe had tried to dampen criticism by reprimanding the 66-year- old minister, who said on Saturday the atomic bombings just days before Japans surrender in World War II could not be helped.

 But Opposition parties, keen to press their advantage ahead of the election, had kept up pressure for him to resign. The scale was tipped when a prominent lawmaker in the ruling coalitions junior partner obliquely called for Kyuma to go.

 It is natural he should resign. The heavy responsibility of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has many problem cabinet ministers, remains for appointing him, Yukio Hatoyama, a senior leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, told reporters.

 Kyuma is the second minister to resign since Abe took office in September, after a funding scandal felled a cabinet member of December. A scandal-tainted farm minister killed himself in May.

 Its a big blow to Abe. The problem for Abe is that his initial reaction was to try to defend him, said Gerry Curtis, a Columbia University political science professor.

 I think the damage is pretty substantial. Its better for Abe that Kyuma resigns than not, he added.

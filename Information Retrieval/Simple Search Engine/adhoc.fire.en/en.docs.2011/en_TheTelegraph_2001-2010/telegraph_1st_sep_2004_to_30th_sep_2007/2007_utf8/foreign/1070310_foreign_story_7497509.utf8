The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Mother play

 London, March 9 (Reuters): For playwright Ian Curteis it is an irresistible cocktail corrupt tycoon Robert Maxwell clashes with saintly nun Mother Teresa in a formidable battle of wills.

 They locked horns but grew to like each other, Curteis said of the bizarre 1988 encounter between saint and sinner that he has dramatised for the stage in his new play The Bargain.

 It was an extraordinary clash between two very over-the-top characters. Both were formidable and determined, he said of the London meeting at which Maxwell hoped to persuade Teresa to endorse a World Encyclopaedia of Religion he was publishing.

 Its easy to see Mother Teresa as the living saint and Maxwell as the villain. But like all human beings they were much more complex than that, the 71-year-old Curteis said of their meeting at Maxwells Mirror Group Newspapers.

 Curteis said in an interview to mark the plays premiere next week: He liked money for its own sake. She liked it for what it could do. She didnt hesitate to accept money from crooks like Haitis Papa Doc Duvalier because she said: I can make it good.

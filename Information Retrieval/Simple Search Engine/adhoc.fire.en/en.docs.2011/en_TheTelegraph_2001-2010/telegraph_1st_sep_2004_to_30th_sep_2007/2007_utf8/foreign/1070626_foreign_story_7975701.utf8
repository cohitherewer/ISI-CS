 Problem pants

 Washington, June 25 (Reuters): A judge in the US capital lost his $54 million lawsuit today against a dry cleaner over a pair of misplaced pants and will have to pay the defendants trial fees.

 Roy L. Pearson, an administrative law judge in the district of Columbia, claimed that a satisfaction guaranteed sign in Custom Cleaners misled consumers like him.

 The judge hearing the case ruled that Pearson did not interpret that sign in a reasonable fashion.

 A reasonable consumer would not interpret Satisfaction Guaranteed to mean that a merchant is required to satisfy a customers unreasonable demands, Judge Judith Bartnoff wrote. Bartnoff ruled that Pearson must pay the defendants filing fees and other miscellaneous costs for the trial.

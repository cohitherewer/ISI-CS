 Britney flees and returns, for children

 Los Angeles, Feb. 22 (Reuters): Pop star Britney Spears has checked back into rehab, celebrity website www.tmz.com reported today, thus temporarily halting a court action in which estranged husband Kevin Federline planned to discuss custody of their two children.

 A spokesman for Spears could not be reached for comment but TMZ said the 25-year-old pop princess, who has been on a wild spree that included shaving her head, had entered rehab at an undisclosed location just a day after fleeing a clinic in Malibu, where she had spent less than 24 hours.

 Los Angeles county superior court spokesman Allan Parachini said commissioner Scott Gordons staff was notified yesterday that papers requesting a hearing on the children could be filed. But Parachini said he was told no court action would be held today.

 Spears and Federline currently share custody of their two children, Jayden James, 5 months old, and Sean Preston, 17 months old. Spears filed for divorce in November, and both she and Federline are seeking custody of the children. News of the possible court hearing came after Spears checked out of the Promises rehab centre in Malibu, where she spent less than 24 hours.

 The latest developments continue a bizarre time for Spears, who last week fled a rehab centre in Antigua after staying for less than a day, according to press reports. When she returned to Los Angeles, she shaved off all her hair.

 TMZ sources said the children are in the Federlines custody and have been since last week. They said Spears showed up at Federlines house to see the children but he wouldnt let her in.

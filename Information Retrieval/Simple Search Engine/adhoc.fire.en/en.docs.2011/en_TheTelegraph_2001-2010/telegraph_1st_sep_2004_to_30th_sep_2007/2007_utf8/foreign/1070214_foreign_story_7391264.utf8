 Beer from spilt milk

 Tokyo, Feb. 13 (Reuters): Great news for beer and milk lovers: A liquor shop owner in Japans largest dairy farming region has stopped crying about local spilt milk and started making beer from it instead.

 We came up with the idea after hearing about surplus milk, said Chitoshi Nakahara, head of the Nakahara liquor shop on the northernmost island of Hokkaido. Milk consumption has been declining steadily in Japan, and Hokkaido disposed of nearly 900 tonnes of milk last March due to over-production.

 Nakaharas new brew, Bilk a combination of milk and beer is about 30 per cent milk. It also contains hops, and the production process does not differ much from that of regular beer, he said. Apart from a slightly milky scent, Bilk looks and tastes like ordinary beer.

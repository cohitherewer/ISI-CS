The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Nightclub to football fans 

 London, April 30 (Reuters): The convicted bomb plotters discussed numerous targets and schemes according to prosecutors.

 These included:

 Nightclub

 Akbar was caught by covert recording discussing with Omar Khyam about targeting the Ministry of Sound nightclub in south London.

 The biggest nightclub in central London, no one can put their hands up and say they are innocent those slags dancing around, Akbar said.

 Khyam asked him: If you got a job in a bar or club, say the Ministry of Sound, what are you planning to do there?

 Akbar replied: Blow the whole thing up. 

 Shopping centre

 Waheed Mahmood had suggested carrying out a bombing at the huge Bluewater shopping centre in Kent on a busy Saturday.

 He was caught by surveillance officers suggesting a little explosion at Bluewater tomorrow if you want. 

 Utilities 

 Waheed Mahmood was employed by Morrison, a main contractor for National Grid Transco, which owns and operates the electricity and high pressure gas systems in Britain.

 He had suggested targeting utility plants and telephone networks.

 He knew exactly the thing to hit. Whether it be telephone, electricity or gas, he seemed to have an idea of what he was talking about, Babar said.

 Akbar also referred to such attacks and was heard talking about missing CDs labelled Transco.

 I think the club thing you could do but the gas would be much harder, covert surveillance officers heard him say.

 Football fans

 Waheed Mahmood had also suggested to Garcia and Amin that the conspirators could get jobs working as barmen at soccer stadiums and use syringes to inject beer cans with poison.

 All you need is some poison in a syringe and all you have to do is put it in the can, put a sticker over it and hand this out, Mahmood said according to Babar.

 He also suggested setting up fake burger vans and poisoning the food before handing it over.

 Takeaways

 Another of Mahmoods suggestions was to set up a phoney takeaway restaurant and poison its food, Babar said.

 The other idea is dont start up a restaurant, just make make up fliers theres a new restaurant in town. You would just have a phone number where they could call up and order food, Babar said of the plan.

 What you could do is poison the food like that when they call for a takeout.

 Not a solution

 Islamabad, March 24 (PTI): The Hindus in Pakistan are happy with Justice Rana Bhagwandas becoming the first member of the community to head the countrys apex court, but caution that it does not mean he will be able to solve their problems.

 We are definitely happy with his appointment, but he cannot solve the problems of the Hindu community which is actually the responsibility of the government, former Pakistan Peoples Party member of the National Assembly Dr Khtoomal was quoted as saying in the Daily Times.

 He said the constitution provides equal rights to every citizen but unfortunately this has not been the case for Hindus who have been ignored on many fronts.

 Gianchand, a businessman from Sindh which has a large number of Hindus, welcomed the appointment but said it was a shame that he was only appointed to the top post during a judicial crisis.

 Larkana-based lawyer Kalpana Devi also appreciated the governments decision but cautioned that the Hindu community should not expect that he would necessarily solve their problems, the report said. Tharparkar-based journalist Surrenadar V. Alasai took this point a step further, saying a Hindu judge would have certain reservations while addressing issues relating to the community.

 Baghdad, Feb. 25 (AP): A suicide bomber struck today outside a college campus in Baghdad, killing at least 41 people and injuring dozens as a string of other blasts and rocket attacks left bloodshed around the city.

 Most of the victims were students at the college, a business studies annex of Mustansiriyah University that was hit by a series of deadly explosions last month. At least 46 people were injured todays blast.

 The wave of attacks around Baghdad came a day after Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki lauded the progress of an ongoing US-Iraqi security operation seeking to cripple militant factions and sectarian killings in the capital.

 The suicide attacker detonated a bomb-rigged belt near the main entrance to the college, where students were resuming mid-term exams after the two-day weekend in Iraq. Police said that guards confronted the bomber as he tried to enter the college grounds.

 A 22-year-old student, Muhanad Nasir, said he saw a commotion at the gate. Then there was an explosion. I did not feel anything for 15 minutes and when I returned to consciousness, I found myself in the hospital, said an injured Nasir.

 The blast left cement walls pockmarked by shrapnel and twisted parts of the metal gate and turnstile. Parents rushed to the site and some collapsed in tears after learning their children were killed. Students used rags and towels to try to mop up the blood.

 The school is located in a mostly Shia district of northeast Baghdad, but does not limit its enrollment to that group. The main campus of Mustansiriyah University, located about 2 km away, was the target of twin car bombs and a suicide blast last month that killed 70 people.

 Earlier, two Katyusha rockets hit a Shia enclave in southern Baghdad, killing at least 10, and a bomb near the fortified Green Zone claimed two lives, police said.

 The Green Zone houses the US and British embassies and key Iraqi government offices.

 Bombers arrested

 Karachi, Feb. 20 (Reuters): 

 Pakistani police arrested two suspected suicide bombers 

 from a banned Islamist group today and seized explosives 

 and jackets to be used in suicide attacks, police said.

 Police arrested the pair in the southern city of Hyderabad after a tip-off from three other suspected suicide bombers arrested in the city of Karachi last week.

 Senior police officer Ghulam Haider Khoso in Hyderabad said the two suspects were linked with the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen militant group. They were arrested with hand grenades, pistols, explosives and jackets.

 Harry trouble

 London, Sept. 7: Prince Harry appeared to have got on the wrong side of his girlfriend Chelsy Davy yesterday when he reportedly kept her waiting at the airport for an hour.

 Davy seemed not to be amused after arriving at Heathrow on a night flight from Johannesburg at 6.30am to find the prince was not there. The 21-year-old Zimbabwean blonde had to wait in a coffee shop. She tried calling the 22-year-old prince but it appeared he had either overslept or forgotten. The couple had not seen each other for more than a month.

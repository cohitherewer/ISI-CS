 Hasina return

 Washington, April 16 (Reuters): Former Bangladeshi leader Sheikh Hasina will return to her country early next week, she said today, dismissing as false and fake murder and corruption charges brought against her in Dhaka.

 Police charged Hasina with murder on April 11 in connection to the deaths of 10 people in Dhaka political violence last October. Of course, Ill go back. Ill go back to my people, she said by telephone from Washington, where she was visiting her son and his family. All are false and fake cases, I know, Hasina said. She said she would leave Washington for London on Wednesday and intended to depart for Dhaka at the weekend. They can do whatever they like, but I know my conscience is clear, I havent done anything wrong, and I havent committed any crimes, Hasina said.

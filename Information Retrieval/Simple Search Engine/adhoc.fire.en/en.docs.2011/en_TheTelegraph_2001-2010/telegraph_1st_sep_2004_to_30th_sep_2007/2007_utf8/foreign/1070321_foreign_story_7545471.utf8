 Uma split

 Los Angeles, March 20 (AP): Actress Uma Thurman and hotelier Andre Balazs have split up.

 Thurmans New York-based publicist Robert Garlock confirmed the couple, together on and off for three years, are no longer an item.

 Thurman, an Oscar-nominated actress who starred in Pulp Fiction and two Kill Bill movies was once married to actors Gary Oldman and Ethan Hawke.

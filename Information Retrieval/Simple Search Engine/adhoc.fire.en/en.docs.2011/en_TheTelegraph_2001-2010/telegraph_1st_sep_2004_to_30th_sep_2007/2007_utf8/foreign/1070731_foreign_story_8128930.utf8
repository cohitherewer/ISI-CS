 Hasina gets bail, not free

 Hasina

 Dhaka, July 30 (Reuters): Bangladeshs former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was granted interim bail by the high court today, nearly two weeks after she was detained on extortion charges, her lawyers said.

 The court gave the authorities two weeks to provide justification for the use of emergency laws to prosecute the Awami League leader, but she was unlikely to be freed immediately because of a second extortion charge filed against her on yesterday.

 The court ordered authorities to release Sheikh Hasina on bail, suspended the prosecution and asked the government to explain within two weeks, the legality in putting the charges under emergency rules, lawyer Rafiqul Haque said.

 Her lawyers said they would challenge the second case in the high court as soon as possible.We will take it up in a day or two after, and hope our client will get justice, said another lawyer, Shafique Ahmed.

 Awami League acting president Zillur Rahman said: Its a victory of truth, which prevails over the false and injustice. We hope the government will release the leader soon.

 Bangladesh has been under a state of emergency imposed by the army-backed interim administration, which took over in January and launched a crackdown on corruption ahead of elections planned for late next year.

 Hasina was arrested on July 16 and sent to a house converted into a prison inside Dhakas sprawling parliament compound. Charges of extorting money from a businessman were formally filed against her a week later.

 Hasinas lawyers filed a petition signed by her with the high court yesterday, arguing emergency rules imposed this year.

 Strange bullet

 Hanoi, April 16 (AP): Doctors have removed a bullet from the heart of a Vietnamese soldier nearly four decades after he was shot by US troops during the Vietnam war, doctors said today.

 Le Dinh Hung, 60, underwent surgery at a Hanoi hospital on Friday and is recovering quickly, said Dr Nguyen Sinh Hien, who spent three hours operating on Hung. It is the strangest case that I have ever seen, Hien said. 

 Hung was shot during a 1968 battle in Quang Tri province, near the former demilitarised zone that separated north and south Vietnam. He had been living with chronic pain ever since. Hien said the bullet went through Hungs stomach, damaged his cardiac valve and came to rest at the back of his heart.

 Rabbit row

 Budapest (Reuters): Hungarys busiest highway, connecting Budapest with Vienna, was closed early on Monday after a truck carrying rabbits crashed, letting 5,000 of the animals loose on the road, police said. The M1 motorway was closed around 40 km west of Budapest while police try to capture the escaped animals, police said.

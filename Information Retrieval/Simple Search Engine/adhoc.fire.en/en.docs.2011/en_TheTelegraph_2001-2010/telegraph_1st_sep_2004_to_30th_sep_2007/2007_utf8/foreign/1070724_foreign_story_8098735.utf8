 Potter book zooms to record

 London, July 23 (Reuters): The seventh and final volume in the Harry Potter series has become the fastest selling book in history, publishers said today, with more than 11 million copies sold during the first 24 hours in three markets alone.

 US sales of the eagerly awaited Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows hit 8.3 million, comfortably beating the previous Potter instalment, which posted sales of 6.9 million copies in the first day, US publisher Scholastic announced.

 In Britain, Bloomsbury sold a record 2.7 million copies of the final Potter book in the first 24 hours, up from 2.0 million for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.

 The same company also announced nearly 400,000 copies of the English language edition of J.K. Rowlings story were bought in Germany over the same period.

 Thousands of Potter fans queued outside book stores in major cities to get hold of the book.

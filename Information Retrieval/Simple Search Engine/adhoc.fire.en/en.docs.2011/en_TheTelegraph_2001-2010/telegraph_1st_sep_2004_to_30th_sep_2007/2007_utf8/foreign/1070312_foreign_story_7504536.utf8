 Pak judge asks for open trial

 Chaudhry

 Islamabad, March 11 (PTI): Sacked Chief Justice of Pakistan Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry today asked for an open trial by the supreme judicial council to adjudicate the allegations of misconduct and misuse of authority levelled against him by President Pervez Musharraf.

 Chaudhry, who has been kept incommunicado by the government after he was sacked on Friday and sent home with police escort, was permitted to meet Air Marshal (retd) Asgha Ali Khan this evening .

 Khan told the media after meeting the sacked chief justice that Chaudhry firmly denied the allegations against him and has asked the council to conduct an open trial by permitting the media and the lawyers fraternity in. 

 The council has asked Chaudhry to appear before it to contest the charges. 

 Khan said Chaudhry has been confined to his house for the past two days and denied access to a telephone, television and newspapers.

 Yesterday, Chaudhry had told Supreme Court bar association president Munir A. Malik on phone that he would contest the allegations against him. I will never resign voluntarily. I have done nothing wrong, Chaudhry responded when he was contacted on phone by Malik during a news conference. 

 Chaudhry also told Malik that he would contest the reference of corruption and misuse of authority sent by Musharraf to the council.

 Malik made the phone call as the media and lawyers were prevented from meeting Chaudhry at his official residence which was surrounded by a big posse of police personnel. 

 Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said the sudden action against Chaudhry at a time when crucial constitutional issues are to come up for decision appears to be an attempt to influence the judiciary by pressuring it through the removal of the chief justice.

 In a statement issued in the US where she was currently touring, Bhutto said the removal of the chief justice has alarmed the bar associations and political parties.

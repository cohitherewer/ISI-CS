 Smelly cabs

 Beijing, March 4: (AP): Beijing taxi drivers should stop eating and sleeping in their cabs as the smells they make could tarnish the citys image during the 2008 Olympic Games, a political adviser was quoted today as saying by Xinhua News Agency.

 About one-third of the taxis in Beijing were smelly, Shi Xiangpeng, a Hong Kong representative at the annual session of the National Committee of the Chinese Peoples Political Consultative Conference, said.

 Space chef

 Houston (PTI): Astronaut Sunita Williams, aboard the International Space Station was trying her hand at making a Japanese sushi meal with packaged salmon, when accidentally a load of green stuff, wasabi, flew into the air everywhere. As everything is weightless, spilled food clean-up is a big challenge. We finally got the wasabi smell out after it was flying around everywhere, Sunita told her mother this week in a conversation arranged by a Boston radio station.

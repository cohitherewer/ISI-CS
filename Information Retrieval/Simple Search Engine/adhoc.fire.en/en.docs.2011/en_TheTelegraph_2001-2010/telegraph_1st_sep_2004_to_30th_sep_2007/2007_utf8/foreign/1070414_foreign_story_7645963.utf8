 Pomona (California), April 13 (AP): A 22-year-old woman and her mother are suing electronics retail giant Best Buy and its Geek Squad computer repair team.

 They are claiming that a technician dispatched to their home used a cellphone camera to record the daughter taking a shower. Sarah Vasquez and her mother said that Hao Kuo Chi placed his cellphone in the bathroom during a service call. Vasquez said she noticed the phone on the sink when she got out of the shower. 

 In his masters absence

 Berlin (Reuters): A German dog locked inside a caravan turned on his absent masters radio and left it blasting out music, setting off howls from neighbours and prompting police to cut power to the mobile home. The dog seems to have switched on the radio while sniffing around, and somehow turned it up full blast, police said.

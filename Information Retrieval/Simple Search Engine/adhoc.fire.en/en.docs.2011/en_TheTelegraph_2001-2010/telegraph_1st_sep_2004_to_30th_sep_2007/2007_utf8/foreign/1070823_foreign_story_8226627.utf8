 Renee has Clooney in a spin

 London, Aug. 23: George Clooney is back with his former girlfriend Rene Zellweger on the set of a new sports film but the couple are far from having a ball.

 The pair, who went out with each other briefly six years ago, both appear in Leatherheads, a romantic comedy based around 1920s American football.

 Clooney, who is directing the film and also wrote the screenplay, stars as an ageing sporting hero who is the owner of an ailing team on the brink of collapse after losing their sponsor.

 He picks a strait-laced college player to revive the clubs fortunes, but the new coach ends up falling for his fiance, played by Zellweger. During the filming in South Carolina this week, 46-year-old Clooney practised throwing a football between takes. But he is said to have stormed off when Zellweger, 38, walked onto the pitch to join in the game while in full period costume.

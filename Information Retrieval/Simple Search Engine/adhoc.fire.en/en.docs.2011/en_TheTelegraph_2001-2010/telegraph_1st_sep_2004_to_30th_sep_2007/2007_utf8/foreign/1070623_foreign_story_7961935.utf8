 Pak nuke threat to India

 - New reactor raises atomic arms race spectre: Watchdog

 The Khushab nuclear site

 Islamabad, June 22 (AP): Satellite images show that Pakistan is building a new nuclear reactor that can produce weapons-grade plutonium, an American watchdog group said, warning that it could contribute to an atomic arms race with India.

 A picture taken on June 3 shows work progressing rapidly on the reactor at the Khushab nuclear site, 160 km southwest of Islamabad the Institute of Science for International Security said yesterday.

 The development of the reactor and other nuclear-related activities imply that Pakistan has decided to increase significantly its production of plutonium for nuclear weapons, the Washington-based institute said in a report analysing the images.

 Pakistan foreign ministry spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam said it shouldnt be a surprise that Pakistan is working on its nuclear programme but declined to discuss it in detail. We are a nuclear weapons state. We have facilities at Khushab, so this shouldnt be a surprise to anyone, Aslam said. She disputed the risk of a South Asian arms race. We were not the first to introduce nuclear weapons to the region or test them, Aslam said. We have no intention of entering into a nuclear arms race with India whether nuclear or conventional.

 The report, co-authored by former UN inspector David Albright, said Pakistan may have decided to produce more plutonium for lighter warheads for cruise missiles, or to upgrade weapons aimed at Indian cities.

 Most Pakistani nuclear weapons use highly enriched uranium, it noted. Albright said the work on the reactor shows that the country is trying to improve its nuclear capabilities with a new generation of plutonium-based weapons that pack more explosive power into smaller, lighter packages than those made with uranium.

 The work on these reactors reflects a Pakistani decision to create a new generation of nuclear weapons. By going plutonium ... we have to interpret that as an attempt to make smaller, more powerful weapons that are going to be more destructive in India, Albright said in an interview.

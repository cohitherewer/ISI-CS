 Anti-women zealot kills minister in Pakistan

 Zil-e-Huma

 Lahore, Feb. 20 (Reuters): 

 A suspected Islamist zealot opposed to women in politics 

 shot dead a Pakistani provincial government minister at 

 a political meeting today, officials said.

 Zil-e-Huma, social welfare minister of the Punjab government and a supporter of President Pervez Musharraf, was about to give a speech to dozens of people when the lone attacker shot her in the head.

 The accused, identified as Mohammad Sarwar, was immediately arrested by police.

 Punjab law minister Raja Basharat said the gunman had been implicated in six previous murder cases but had never been convicted because of a lack of evidence.

 He revealed during interrogation that he is against the involvement of women in politics and government affairs, Basharat said.

 Basharat said the gunman was not a member of any Islamist group. He is basically a fanatic, he said.

 The shooting occurred at Humas party office in the town of Gujranwala, 70 km north of the provincial capital, Lahore. Huma had planned to meet Pakistan Muslim League activists at Gujranwala.

 Musharraf, a key ally in the US-led war on terrorism, espouses a vision of enlightened moderation to project Pakistan as a moderate Muslim nation and has vowed to empower women.

 But women still face widespread violence and discrimination in a male-dominated society.

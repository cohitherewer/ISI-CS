 Kiev tug of war

 Kiev, May 26 (Reuters): Ukraines President Viktor Yushchenko ordered extra troops into the capital today as he haggled with his main rival over a date for parliamentary elections amid a protracted political crisis.

 After 24 hours of confusion over just who controlled the interior ministrys force of 30,000 troops, a top official said Yushchenko had ordered extra units into the capital in what he described as a routine operation. The troops commander said he would obey only orders issued by the President. But news reports said some of the 2,000 extra troops had been halted by traffic police on their way to the capital.

 Weeks of political turmoil boiled over yesterday when the head of state said he was taking control of the ministry troops, a move denounced by Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich as dangerous and unconstitutional. 

 Yanukovich, the Presidents rival from the upheaval of the 2004 Orange Revolution, arrived for the talks at Yushchenkos office more than two hours later than planned today.

 A spokeswoman said Opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko, realigned with the pro-western Yushchenko after a period of estrangement, had taken part in the talks.

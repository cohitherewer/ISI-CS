The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Sex scenes laughable

 Nervous

 New York, Sept. 12 (Reuters): Daniel Radcliffes first kiss as Harry Potter attracted global attention but in reality the 18-year-old British actor already had lost his on-screen virginity.

 The setting for the love scene with Australian actress Teresa Palmer filmed when Radcliffe was 16 was a remote cave by the Australian shore for the movie December Boys. It is his first major role outside the boy wizard film series. The movie opens in the US and Britain on Friday and will make its debut in Australia later this month.

 Radcliffe, who has since appeared nude on the London stage in Equus and hopes to do so again on Broadway, said filming the sex scene was laughable and decidedly not sexy. Its a laugh. Its very, very hard to stop giggling I found, Radcliffe said. I suppose the thing I was worried about was: Am I going to get an erection? Is this going to be really sexy? Is this going to be a bit awkward?

 But when you get in there, its not sexy in the slightest, he said. December Boys is the tale of four boys on a beach holiday away from their outback Australian orphanage home. Radcliffe plays the eldest boy, named Maps.

 What was quite nice about doing that scene was the dynamic between my character and Teresas character was very much like it was between us as actors on that day because I had never done a sex scene before, Teresa had done a few, he said.

 I was quite nervous and she was sort of guiding me through it, said Radcliffe, who is about to start filming the sixth Harry Potter movie. Radcliffe started playing Potter when he was 11 and found that the December Boys role gave him confidence when he returned to Britain to film Order of the Phoenix.

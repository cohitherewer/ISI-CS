 US tribunal

 Guantanamo Bay US Naval Base (Cuba), June 5 (Reuters): US military judges yesterday dropped all war crimes charges against the only two Guantanamo captives facing trial, rulings that could mean none of the 380 prisoners held at the US base in Cuba will be tried any time soon.

 The judges said they lacked jurisdiction under the strict definition of those subject to trial by military tribunal.

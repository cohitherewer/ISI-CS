 Interpol notice for Saddam kin

 Raghad: Aggressive

 Baghdad, Aug. 18 (AFP): The international police organisation, Interpol, today issued a wanted notice for Saddam Husseins eldest daughter, who is sought by the Iraqi government on suspicion of terrorism.

 Interpols red notice does not represent an international arrest warrant but is a request for foreign police forces to cooperate in tracking down 38-year-old Raghad Hussein and in extraditing her to face justice in Iraq.

 Raghad has lived openly in Jordan since July 2003 and since last year has been on a list of 41 people associated with her fathers regime that the new Iraqi government is seeking to prosecute for inciting violence. Known to some as little Saddam for her aggressive temperament, Raghad has taken a more public role in defending her father, who was executed on December 30 last year.

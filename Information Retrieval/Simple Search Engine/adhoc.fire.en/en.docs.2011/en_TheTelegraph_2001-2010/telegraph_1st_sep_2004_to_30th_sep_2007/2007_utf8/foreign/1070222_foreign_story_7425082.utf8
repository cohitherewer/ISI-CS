 Kathmandu , Feb. 21: The fragile peace process in Nepal suffered a serious setback today after 3,000 Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) combatants deserted their barracks at a special cantonment in Chitwan district of southern Nepal.

 The soldiers said they were going in search of work for not being fed adequately there. 

 According to reports, the Maoist soldiers left the camps and spread out into the countryside seeking work in construction sites and farms. They said that since the government was ignoring them, they were forced look for jobs to feed themselves. 

 Reports quoting Maoist army deputy commander Prabhakar said more PLA soldiers would leave their camps in the next few days if the government continues to do nothing to improve the facilities at the camps. Prabhakar said that 1500 soldiers would stay back in each camp to guard the weapons which have been stored and sealed in special containers under UN supervision. 

 UN chief representative in Nepal Ian Martin, who formally informed the government about the completion of the disarming process on February 18, criticised the facilities for the Maoist soldiers at the camps. He said they were inadequate and below the required standards. 

 As the news of the desertion reached Kathmandu, the government sprang to life and held talks with Maoist leaders to resolve the crisis which is threatening to derail the peace process. 

 The Maoists are scheduled to join the interim government now that they have been successfully disarmed. 

 Home minister Krishna Prasad Sitaula began holding discussions with Maoist parliamentary leader and spokesperson Krishna Bahadur Mahara to make the combatants return to their barracks. 

 The discussions lasted till late in the evening with the Maoist leader insisting that the government release the second instalment of funds for providing the necessary facilities to the Maoist soldiers.

 The rebels said that they had already spent the Rs 400 million given by the government for the upkeep of their soldiers. 

 Gyanendra action

 The government plans to take action against King Gyanendra for his unconstitutional and reactionary Democracy Day message in which he defended his February 1, 2005, takeover of power, deputy Prime Minister Amik Serchan said.

 The interim constitution has not provided the king any right to deliver such a message and we will take action against him, the deputy Prime Minister said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Brown accused of favouring Mittal

 ANDREW ALDERSON AND JASPER COPPING

 London, Jan. 21: Gordon Brown has been accused of doing favours for Lakshmi Mittal, the Indian billionaire who has helped to bail the Labour Party out of its cash crisis. 

 Mittal, Britains richest man with a personal fortune estimated at 14.8 billion, last week gave 2 million to the Labour Party, which recently reported debts of more than 23 million. The steel tycoon has given more than 4 million to the party since 2001. 

 The chancellor was in India where he attended a meeting on Friday of leading bankers in Mumbai organised by ICICI Bank. Mittal is a director and substantial shareholder in the bank. 

 Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat MP who has been scrutinising the relationship between Mittal and New Labour, also discovered last week that the Treasury had sidelined a pledge that it would close a loophole which allows wealthy businessmen to operate elaborate, but legal, tax avoidance schemes while living in Britain. 

 Baker was told in a government answer to his parliamentary question that the review of residence and domicile tax rules had started in 2002 and is ongoing. He said: If Mr Brown had closed this tax loophole as he said he would, perhaps Mr Mittal and other billionaires would be less willing to donate large sums of money to the Labour Party. I think it is curious that such an obvious tax loophole has not been closed when Mr Brown promised that it would be. 

 The most common loophole used by billionaires is to take advantage of the British system of offering non-domicile status to foreigners, or those with foreign-born parents, living in this country. 

 Under the scheme, wealthy foreigners can legitimately claim they are domiciled abroad even though they may have lived in Britain for decades. Some may even have British passports. Those with non-domiciled status place their assets in offshore tax havens and pay tax only on money brought into Britain. 

 Mittal is an Indian passport holder whose company does not pay tax in Britain. He is believed to pay a modest tax bill as a resident. He was at the centre of one of Labours biggest financial controversies in 2001, when Tony Blair allegedly intervened to help him buy a steelworks in Romania after he gave the party a 125,000 donation. 

 A Treasury spokesman said: There is no link between the donation and the event in Mumbai. 

 A spokesman for Mittal said: He is not expecting anything in return for his donation. It is because he is a long term supporter of the party and has no links to anything else whatsoever.

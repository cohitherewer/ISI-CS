 Lopez cover

 New York, Jan. 5 (AP): Jennifer Lopez is among the entertainers selected by People en Espanol for its 100 Most Influential Hispanics issue, which honours those who have made an impact in the Hispanic community.

 Lopez, who graces the cover of the magazines February issue, says being an example to others is a big part of my work. The 38-year-old singer-actress also says she would like to have children someday.

 I come from a strong family, so of course I want to have one, Lopez tells the magazine.

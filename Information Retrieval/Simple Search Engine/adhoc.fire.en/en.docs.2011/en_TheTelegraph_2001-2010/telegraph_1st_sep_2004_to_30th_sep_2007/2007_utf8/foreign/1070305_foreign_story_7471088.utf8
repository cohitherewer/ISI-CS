 Foreign capital to lose edge

 Beijing, March 4 (AP): The tax honeymoon for foreign investors in China is ending. 

 For two decades, China has rewarded new investors with hefty tax breaks, helping lure the nearly $700 billion in investment that has helped make the country the worlds fourth largest-economy, but fuelling growing complaints by Chinese companies about unfair treatment.

 Now, Chinas legislature is expected to end this special status after it opens its annual session tomorrow. 

 A law that state media said is expected to be enacted would equalise tax rates, raising foreign companies tax bills and cutting those for many Chinese entities.

 This special treatment could not continue forever, said Winston Zhao, a lawyer in Shanghai for the US law firm Jones Day, who is advising companies on the change. Foreign investors have to be prepared mentally, though nobody wants this to happen.

 The change is part of sweeping efforts to modernise Chinas laws to keep pace with explosive economic change and meet World Trade Organisation commitments to treat companies equally. 

 It is too early to know what the financial impact will be on foreign companies. But business groups and consultants said major changes in business plans are unlikely, because companies are still attracted by Chinas low labour costs and 1.3 billion potential consumers.

 Companies are largely profitable, in it for the long term here and willing to put up with a change in the tax system that is more clear and more fair, said Robert Poole, the vice-president of the US-China Business Council, which represents 250 American companies.

 Until now, new foreign investors have been exempt from income-tax for two years and got a 50 per cent cut for another three. After that, other breaks such as for investing in special economic zones could keep taxes as low as 10 per cent. By contrast, Chinese companies pay 33 per cent of their profits in taxes.

 The new law would set taxes for all companies at 25 per cent, with lower rates for companies in technology development, according to a draft that was given to foreign companies. It says tax breaks already granted to foreign investors would continue for up to five years. 

 A unified tax code will create a taxation environment that favours fair competition among all ventures registered in China, finance minister Jin Renqing told lawmakers in December.

 It is not clear when exactly the new regulations would kick in. Chinas next tax year starts on January 1, 2008.

 The proposed new tax code is part of efforts to impose uniform business conditions nationwide.

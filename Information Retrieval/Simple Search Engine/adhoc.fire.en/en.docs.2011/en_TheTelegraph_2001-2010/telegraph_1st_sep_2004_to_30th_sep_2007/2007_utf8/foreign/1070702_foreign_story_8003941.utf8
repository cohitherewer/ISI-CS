 China ban 

 Beijing, July 1 (PTI) China today banned the production and import of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and Halon, two ozone depleting substances with immediate effect, honouring its promise to phase out the substances two-and-a-half-years ahead of schedule. 

 As the biggest producer and consumer of CFCs and halon among developing nations, China had disposed of about 100,000 tonnes of CFCs and about 80,000 tonnes of halon since it signed up the Montreal protocol in 1991. 

 Prosecutor 

 Dhaka (PTI): Mahbubur Rahman, chief prosecutor of Bangladeshs anti-corruption commission, resigned on Sunday after his appointment last month sparked criticism from fellow lawyers and media, which alleged the anti-graft body itself had listed him as a corruption suspect several years ago. The commission said he has resigned on health grounds.

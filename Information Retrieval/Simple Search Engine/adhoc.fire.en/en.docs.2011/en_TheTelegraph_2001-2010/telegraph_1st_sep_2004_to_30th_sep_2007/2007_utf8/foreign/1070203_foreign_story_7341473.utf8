 Miller moves to movies

 Miller, Law: In the spotlight 

 New York, Feb. 2 (Reuters): After being hounded by tabloids about her private life, especially her relationship with ex-fiance Jude Law, Sienna Miller wants the focus to be on her acting and burgeoning career.

 The New York-born 25-year-old English actress has her biggest role yet in the film biography Factory Girl, which is being released in the US this week.

 She plays the title role pop artist Andy Warhols short-term muse Edie Sedgwick, who grabbed attention in the 1960s displaying an outlandish fashion style while hanging off the arm of a celebrity.

 It would be nice if the focus was on something other than my personal life, the blond-haired, blue-eyed Miller, wearing a sweater over a floral baby-doll dress, black tights and boots, said.

 Everything else that is created and hyperbolised is not my doing, its the circumstances, it is the way my life turned out, but I wouldnt change one bit of my life.

 Media attention on Miller soared after Law, who she appeared with in the 2004 film Alfie, publicly admitted to an affair with his childrens nanny. She said that hype is not really a reflection of me or who I am.

 In the past 12 months shes turned her attention to working on five movies, including Factory Girl. The film exposes Sedgwicks short-lived fame derived from an intense friendship with Warhol that blossomed in The Factory, his New York art studio.

 Unlike Sedgwick, who died of a drug overdose at 28, Miller intends to have a long career in Hollywood I would like to be doing this when I am 50 and 60 and unlike Warhol, she said she is not fascinated with fame.

 It has never been about achieving fame. I think that is something that gets put upon me, she said, adding that she was uncomfortable with the attention.

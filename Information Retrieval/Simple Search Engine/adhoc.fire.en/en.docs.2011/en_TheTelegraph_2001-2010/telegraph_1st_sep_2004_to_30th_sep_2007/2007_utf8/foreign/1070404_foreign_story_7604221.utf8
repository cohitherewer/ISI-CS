 Door open for talks, Blair tells Iran

 London, April 3 (Reuters): Britains Prime Minister Tony Blair said today the way was open for diplomatic efforts to secure the release of 15 British sailors and Marines seized by Iran, and the next 48 hours would be critical.

 The two countries have been at loggerheads since Iran seized the sailors on March 23 in the northern Gulf, but there have been few tangible signs of progress in the 12-day stand off.

 Yesterday, Ali Larijani, the secretary of Irans Supreme National Security Council, said he believed bilateral diplomacy could resolve the crisis quickly. Britain responded by saying it too would like early talks to end the row.

 Were not looking for confrontation over this and actually the most important thing is to get the people back safe and sound. And if they want to resolve this in a diplomatic way the door is open, Blair told a radio station in Scotland. The next 48 hours will be fairly critical, he said.

 Oil prices tumbled more than a dollar after Blairs comments on hopes there may be a diplomatic end to the crisis that has stoked fears crucial oil supplies from the Gulf could be hit.

 British moves to get the international community to condemn Iran had angered Tehran while Britain has criticised the parading of its military personnel on Iranian television, saying the broadcasted admissions of guilt had been forced. The dispute centres on where the sailors were when they were seized. Britain insists they were in Iraqi waters on a routine UN mission, but Tehran says they were in its territory.

 Both sides are standing firm on this, but Larijani left the door open by saying a delegation should be sent to determine whether the British sailors were in Iran or not.

 Iran said today the row could be resolved soon if London continued its changed behaviour and accepted its sailors and marines had entered Iran illegally. However, analysts said hopes for a diplomatic success could still be derailed by anti-western hardliners within Iran, the worlds fourth-biggest oil exporter.

 They say the powerful Revolutionary Guards who seized the Britons are relishing the chance to flex their muscles against London, a former imperial power with a long history of involvement in Iranian politics. 

 Irans anti-western President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will talk about the detained sailors tomorrow, according to Iranian television.

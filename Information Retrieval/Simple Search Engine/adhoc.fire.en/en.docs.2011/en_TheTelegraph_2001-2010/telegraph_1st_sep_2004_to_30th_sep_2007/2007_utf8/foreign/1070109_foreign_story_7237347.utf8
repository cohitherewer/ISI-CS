 Jan. 15 date for Nepal constitution

 J. HEMANTH 

 Kathmandu , Jan. 8: The ruling Seven-Party Alliance (SPA) today decided to promulgate the interim constitution on January 15, effectively bringing the curtain down on the Shah dynasty which has ruled Nepal for the last 238 years. 

 The constitution keeps the institution of monarchy in suspension till the Constituent Assembly elections which are supposed to be held in June this year. 

 Top leaders of the ruling alliance attended the meeting which was held at Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koiralas official residence in Kathmandu this morning. 

 Briefing reporters after the meeting, Nepali Congress general secretary Ram Chandra Poudel said the SPA and the Maoist rebels have agreed to submit the final list of their representatives in the interim legislature to Koirala by January 14. 

 However, he said todays meeting could not finalise the names for the 48 remaining seats in the 330-member legislature. 

 According to Poudel, another meeting of the top leaders would be held before January 14 to fill up the vacancies.

 Judge complaint

 Islamabad, May 11 (Reuters): The judge standing in for suspended Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry has found time to take up a college girls complaint that male students harass her by singing a pop song.

 Acting supreme court Chief Justice Rana Bhagwandas decided to answer the girls plea for help made in a letter to a local newspaper. Whenever I pass by the college canteen, the boys start singing this song and laugh at me, wrote Parveen, who is studying in a commerce college in Lahore. Bhagwandas ordered the singer and lyricist to appear before him along with a lawyer, a court official said today.

 Google maps in terror raids

 Basra (Iraq), Jan. 13: Terrorists attacking British bases in Basra are using aerial footage displayed by the Google Earth internet tool to pinpoint their attacks, say army intelligence sources.

 Documents seized during raids on the homes of insurgents last week uncovered print-outs from photographs taken from Google.

 The satellite photographs show in detail the buildings inside the bases and vulnerable areas such as tented accommodation, lavatory blocks and where lightly armoured Land Rovers are parked.

 Written on the back of one set of photographs taken of the Shatt al Arab Hotel, headquarters for the 1,000 men of the Staffordshire Regiment battle group, officers found the camps longitude and latitude.

 This is evidence as far as we are concerned for planning terrorist attacks, said an intelligence officer with the Royal Green Jackets battle group. Who would otherwise have Google Earth imagery of one of our bases?

 We are concerned that they use them to plan attacks. We have never had proof that they have deliberately targeted any area of the camp using these images but presumably they are of great use to them. We believe they use Google Earth to identify the most vulnerable areas such as tents.

 One soldier has been killed in the past six months following a mortar attack and there have been several injuries.

 Since the maps were found, intelligence chiefs have been keeping track of where rounds land to see if the insurgents are using them to pinpoint weakly protected areas. The British camps experience mortar and rocket attacks on a daily basis. Salvos are fired from up to four miles away and are increasingly accurate. 

 Anyone with the Internet can sign up to Google Earth and by simply typing in the name of a location they can receive very detailed imagery down to identifying types of vehicles.

 The company is one of several Internet outlets that buy aerial imagery, usually taken by aircraft but sometimes by satellite, from governments or mapping companies. It is unclear how old the maps are but it is believed the Basra images were made within the past two years. A Google spokesman said the information could be used for good and bad and was available to the public in many forms.

 Pervez gets court notice

 - Chaudhry plea admitted

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 Apex warning

 Islamabad, April 19: The Pakistan supreme court today admitted a petition filed by suspended Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry and issued notices to President Pervez Musharraf and the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC). 

 This is the first time in Pakistans history that a notice has been served directly on the President by the apex court.

 The court issued the notices after preliminary hearing on Justice Iftikhar Chaudhrys petition, which was filed in the apex court yesterday Aitzaz Ahsan, chief counsel for the suspended top judge, said after the hearing. 

 Chaudhry yesterday filed a 200-page petition with 132 constitutional objections. His petition created history as he became the first chief justice of Pakistan who sought justice from the very court he headed.

 Today, his petition was initially rejected by the registrar of the court but later a three-judge bench took it on file.

 President Musharraf had sacked Justice Chaudhry on March 9 and sent a reference against him to the SJC for misuse of power. 

 The petition questioned the validity of Musharrafs reference, the legality and composition of the SJC and notification issued by the President appointing Rana Bhagwan Das the acting chief justice and the legality of his appointment as head of the SJC.

 In his petition, the chief justice has also sought interim relief to halt proceedings of the SJC, Ahsan said, adding that the council is not a proper forum to try the chief justice. 

 He said: I told the apex courts full bench today that the chief justice could only be tried by a full court and the SJC cannot be convened under presidentship of the acting chief justice. 

 Interestingly, the supreme court bench, which admitted the petition, will meet again on April 24, the same day when Chaudhry is to attend the next hearing of the SJC. Asked how the Chaudhrys team of lawyers will attend both hearings, Ahsan said: We will first attend the supreme court hearing.

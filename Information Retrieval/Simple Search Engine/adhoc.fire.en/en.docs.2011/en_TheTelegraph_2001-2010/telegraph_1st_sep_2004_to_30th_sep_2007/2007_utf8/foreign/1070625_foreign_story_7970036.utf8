The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Not poor as a Churchill

 MICHAEL COCKERELL

 Churchill

 London, June 24: When Tony Blair leaves Number 10 on Wednesday he will be much better off than Winston Churchill was when he became an ex-Prime Minister in 1945 after winning World War II and losing the general election.

 My grandfather was effectively bankrupt by the end of the war, says Winston Churchill, the great mans grandson. Churchill was forced to put his home, Chartwell in Kent, on the market.

 Lord Camrose, the then proprietor of The Daily Telegraph was outraged, says young Winston. And he corralled 10 wealthy well-wishers and they each ponied up the princely sum of 5,000.

 So for 55,000... they bought Chartwell on the understanding that my grandparents would live there until the end of their days and then it would be presented to the nation.

 In contrast to Churchill, Blair will receive a severance package from the state worth about 300,000 a year. Thanks to some astute lobbying by other ex-Prime Ministers, he will get a car, a police driver and round-the-clock special branch protection.

 He will also receive an immediate prime ministerial pension of nearly 64,000 a year, as well as a further 84,000 to run his office on top of what he makes as an MP.

 But how will Blair cope with life in the ex-Prime Ministers club, after what his predecessor John Major describes as the longest farewell tour since Dame Nellie Melba? Tony still doesnt know whats going to hit him, says one of his closest advisers.

 The thing he will miss most is being cut off from top-grade information. He will no longer receive secret intelligence reports and papers and briefings that tell him what is really going on both in Britain and the rest of the world.

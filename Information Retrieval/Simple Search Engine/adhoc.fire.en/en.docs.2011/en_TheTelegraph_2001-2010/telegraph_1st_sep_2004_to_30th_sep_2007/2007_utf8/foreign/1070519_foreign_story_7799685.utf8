 EU snubs Russia at frosty summit

 Volzhsky Utyos (Russia), May 18 (Reuters): Russia and the EU clashed over democracy today as German Chancellor Angela Merkel took Russia to task for stopping Opposition figures reaching a rally near an EU-Russia summit.

 At the frosty meeting which cooled ambitions for deeper ties between Russia and the bloc, EU leaders also snubbed Kremlin requests that it rein in its eastern European members that are locked in rows with Moscow.

 Officials at a Moscow airport had stopped a group including chess champion and anti-Kremlin activist Garry Kasparov from flying to Samara, the nearest big city to the summit venue, where they planned to lead a March of the dissenters against Putins rule. All of those who want to stage a rally in Samara should be able to do so, Merkel said in her opening remarks at a post-summit news conference.

 I can understand if you arrest people that are throwing stones or threaten the right of the state to enforce order ... But it is altogether a different thing if you hold people up on the way to a demonstration.

 Putin said the actions of Russian police were not always justified. But, becoming visibly riled, he hit back, saying Kasparov and his colleagues were marginals and that EU countries also had flaws in their democracies.

 What is pure democracy? Putin asked a news conference at the venue, a holiday resort on the banks of the Volga river 1,000 km southeast of Moscow. It is a question of ... whether you want to see the glass half full or half empty.

 A police official at Moscows Sheremetyevo airport blamed a computer glitch that meant Kasparov and his companions could not be issued with a ticket. As expected, the summit failed to unblock the launch of talks on an EU-Russia partnership agreement. They are stalled because of a Polish veto, part of a trade row with Russia.

 Moscow had hoped the EU leadership would persuade Poland as well as Estonia and Lithuania which have their own rows with Russia to moderate their stances. 

 Poland blocked the talks after Russia imposed a ban on imports of Polish meat. Moscow has accused Estonia of desecrating the memory of World War II victims after it moved a Soviet-era war memorial. Lithuania is unhappy that Russia has switched off an oil pipeline.

 But European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso made clear the bloc was squarely behind its members. We had occasion to say to our Russian partners that a difficulty for a member state is a difficulty for the whole European community, he said.

 It is very important if you want to have close cooperation to understand that the EU is based on principles of solidarity.

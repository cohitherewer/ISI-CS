 Floppies forsaken

 Too small

 London, Feb. 1 (AP): PC World, Britains largest chain of computer superstores, has decided it will not be selling floppy disks once its stash is gone. The store said yesterday, the disks do not hold enough data and there are better alternatives.

 PC World has about 10,000 of the disks in stock and decided last week not to order any more, spokesman Hamish Thompson said. Its had a good, long and productive life, but really, its just too small to hold any real data, Thompson said of the disks. It just doesnt make sense any more.

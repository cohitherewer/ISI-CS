 Sewage tsunami hits Gaza

 Gaza, March 27 (Reuters): A sewage reservoir burst next to a village in the northern Gaza Strip today, killing at least four people and injuring 20 in a torrent of putrid water and waste that buried their homes, officials said.

 Two children, aged one and two, were among the dead in Gazas small Bedouin Village when the sewage overflowed in what one resident called a man-made tsunami.

 At least 25 makeshift homes were destroyed or completely buried. As many as 96 were damaged. Has anybody seen my child? stunned resident Abdel-Salam Abu Atiq pleaded. This is a disaster. Who is responsible?

 It was not immediately clear what caused the sewage to erupt from the reservoir, but local residents blamed the municipal government for failing to address the mounting sewage problem.

 Aid officials said the capacity of the wastewater plant had been stretched to breaking point. The narrow coastal strip is home to 1.5 million Palestinians and the plant served two densely populated areas, Beit Lahiya and Jabalya.

 Lanka jets raid Tiger naval hub

 Colombo, April 4 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan air force jets bombed and destroyed the headquarters of the Tamil Tigers naval arm in the far northern district of Mullaithivu, the military said today, but the rebels said a landmine victim charity was hit.

 As the headquarters were inland in a town called Puthukkudiyiruppu, and the feared Sea Tiger fleet of attack boats are stationed near the coast, it was unclear if any rebel vessels were damaged, the military said. The Tigers said two civilians were killed by the air strike.

 We took one target today. It was the Sea Tigers headquarters, a fuel dump and vehicle parking area all completely destroyed, an air force spokesman said.

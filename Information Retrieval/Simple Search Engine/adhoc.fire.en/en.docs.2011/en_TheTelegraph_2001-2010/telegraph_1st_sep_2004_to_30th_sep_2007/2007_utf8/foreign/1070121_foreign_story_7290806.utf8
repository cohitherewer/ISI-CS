 Charles in carbon ruse 

 London, Jan. 20 (Reuters): Britains Prince Charles, criticised for booking a transatlantic flight to collect the Global Environmental Citizen Prize, has cancelled a ski trip to Switzerland to reduce greenhouse gases, a source said today.

 The decision not to take the annual holiday in Klosters was part of Charless commitment to reduce his carbon footprint, the source said. 

 British environment minister David Miliband has questioned the need for the heir to the throne to fly to New York next week with a 20-strong entourage to collect the award.

 CIA to share family jewels next week

 SAM KNIGHT 

 Washington, June 22: The CIA is to release hundreds of pages of secret files describing its illegal assassination attempts, wiretappings, kidnappings and behaviour experiments between the 1950s and 1970s. 

 A 693-page document describing the agencys so-called family jewels was compiled in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, when it was revealed that former CIA officers had helped President Nixon carry out dirty tricks against his political opponents. 

 The then-CIA director, James Schlesinger, sent a letter to every employee of the agency to report all activities that they knew about that may have fallen outside the CIAs charter. 

 The result was information on hundreds of incidents including the detention of a suspected Russian spy for two years and attempts to kill Fidel Castro whose disclosure Henry Kissinger, then US secretary of state, warned would have heavier consequences than the scandal that caused the inquiry in the first place. 

 Announcing last night that the file would be released next week, the current CIA director, Michael Hayden said: Much of it has been in the press before, and most of it is unflattering, but its the CIAs history.

 Many of the events described in the papers are already known, but the official versions have never been seen. 

 Hayden, who has made a conscious effort to separate Americas senior intelligence agency from a recent inglorious past, the invasion of Iraq and allegations of the illegal wiretapping of US citizens, said the documents showed a very different time and a very different agency. 

 Ahead of the full publication of the family jewels and a further 11,000 pages of CIA memos, mainly about Soviet and Chinese internal politics and Warsaw Pact military programmes, the National Security Archive at George Washington University last night released a series of other documents describing their contents. 

 One memo was an account of a conversation between William Colby, Schlesingers successor at the CIA, and President Gerald Ford in January 1975 about allegations of CIA domestic activities that took place shortly after The New York Times revealed details of an illegal wiretapping programme of 9,900 Americans uncovered by the internal inquiry.

 Iran halts captive release

 Tehran, March 29 (AP): Iran today took a step back on a pledge to free a British woman sailor soon, saying her release may be delayed if Britain follows through with a freeze in relations and refers the issue to the UN Security Council.

 Irans foreign minister had said Tehran would soon free Faye Turney, the only woman among 15 British sailors and marines seized last week in what Iran says were its territorial waters near Iraq.

 Today, however, Iranian negotiator Ali Larijani told Iranian state television that British leaders have miscalculated this issue and if they follow through with threats, the case may face a legal path presumably putting the Britons on trial.

 Iranian military chief, Gen. Ali Reza Afshar, said that owing to the wrong behaviour of the British government, the release of a female British soldier has been suspended, the semi-official Iranian news agency Mehr reported.

 Britain maintains the 15 were seized in Iraqi waters after searching a merchant vessel and has asked the UN Security Council to support a call for their immediate release.

 British Prime Minister Tony Blairs government also said it was freezing most contacts with Iran. But Irans official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted a government official as playing down the consequences of the British freeze.

 Tehran-London relations were already cold, the agency quoted an unidentified official as saying. Britain has also enlisted international help in pressing its demand for the service members freedom.

 Today, UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon discussed the fate of the captives with Iranian foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki on the sidelines of an Arab summit in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, that both were attending. Bans spokeswoman, Soung-Ah Choi, said the UN secretary-general was addressing a number of issues in the talks and that the detention of the Britons was among them. She would not give immediate details on the talks, which were still ongoing.

 In Brussels, Belgium, the European Unions foreign policy chief urged Iran to free the captives, saying the standoff is blocking efforts to improve relations between Tehran and Europe.

 What Iran has to do is to liberate immediately all the soldiers, Javier Solana told reporters. We want to have good relations with Iran, and this does not help.

 Mottaki told The Associated Press on Wednesday that if the alleged entry into Iranian waters proved to have been a mistake this can be solved. But they have to show that it was a mistake. That will help us to end this issue.

 Admitting the mistake will facilitate a solution to the problem, he said. Mottaki said Iran had GPS devices from the seized British boats that showed they were in Iranian territory.

 But tensions soared after Iranian television showed a video yesterday of the detained Britons. On the brief footage, Turney said her group had trespassed in Iranian waters.

 French concern

 In Paris, the French foreign ministry summoned Iranian ambassador Ali Ahani today, expressing concern over Irans detention of the 15 Britons. The ministry said it expressed its solidarity with Britain and urged Tehran to free the 15 as quickly as possible.

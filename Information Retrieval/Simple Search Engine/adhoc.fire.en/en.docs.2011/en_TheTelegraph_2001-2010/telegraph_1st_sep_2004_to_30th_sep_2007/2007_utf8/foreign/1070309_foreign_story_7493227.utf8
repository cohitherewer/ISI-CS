 Pak artefacts

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 Islamabad , March 8: The US government today returned to Pakistan some 39 rare Buddhist artefacts which were dug up by treasure hunters and illegally smuggled to America. 

 The artefacts, which are worth millions of dollars, were recovered by agents of the US department of homeland security in Newark, New Jersey. According to the US ambassador to Pakistan, Ryan Cocker, an alert customs officer in Newark seized the shipment of artefacts in September 2005. The collection included a relief panel depicting a dance scene, a frieze showing monks meditating, various Buddha statues and other items from the Gandhara civilisation.

 Mobiles safe in short term

 London, Sept. 12 (Reuters): Mobile phones do not pose short-term health risks, but it remains too soon to say whether they can cause brain cancer or whether children face greater risks than adults, British scientists said today.

 Publishing the largest UK investigation into possible health problems from mobile technology, scientists said the six-year programme found no evidence that short-term mobile phone use affected brain function or could cause brain cancer.

 But Lawrie Challis, chairman of the 8.8 million Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research (MTHR) Programme, said studies so far had included few participants who had used cellphones for 10 years or longer.

 We cannot rule out the possibility at this stage that cancer could appear in a few years time, he told a news conference. Most cancers take 10 years to appear.

 Challis also noted that the UK studies that made up the report had not yet examined children. 

 British scientists had shied away from exposing children to radio-frequency (RF) fields, which are generated by devices such as mobile phones and phone masts, for ethical reasons, he said.

 However, he noted that it was possible for children to be more sensitive to RF radiation than adults and said a second MTHR programme was underway, involving 200,000 people in Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Britain.

 However, he stopped short of advising parents against allowing children to use mobile phones as a precautionary measure. Im afraid its up to someone else to give advice, he said.

 The MTHR Programme was jointly funded by the government and telecoms industry. The telecoms industry, however, merely signed the cheques, Challis said.

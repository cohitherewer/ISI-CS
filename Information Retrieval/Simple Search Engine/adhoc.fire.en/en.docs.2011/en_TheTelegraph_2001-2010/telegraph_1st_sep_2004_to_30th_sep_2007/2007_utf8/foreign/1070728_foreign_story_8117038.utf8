 Last Supper theory leads to frenzy

 Milan, July 27 (Reuters): A new theory that LeonardosLast Supper might hide within it a depiction of Christ blessing the bread and wine has triggered so much interest that websites connected to the picture have crashed.

 The famous fresco is already the focus of mythical speculation after author Dan Brown based his The Da Vinci Code book around the painting, arguing in the novel that Jesus married his follower, Mary Magdelene, and fathered a child.

 Now Slavisa Pesci, an information technologist and amateur scholar, says superimposing the Last Supper with its mirror-image throws up another picture containing a figure who looks like a Templar knight and another holding a small baby.

 I came across it by accident, from some of the details you can infer that we are not talking about chance but about a precise calculation, Pesci told journalists when he unveiled the theory earlier this week.

 Websites www.leonardodavinci.tv, www.codicedavinci.tv, www.cenacolo.biz and www.leonardo2007.com had 15 million hits yesterday morning alone, organisers said.

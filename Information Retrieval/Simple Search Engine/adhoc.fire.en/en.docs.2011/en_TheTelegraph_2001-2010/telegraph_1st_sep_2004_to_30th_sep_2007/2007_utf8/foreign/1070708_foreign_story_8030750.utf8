 Pope backs Latin amid Jews fears 

 Vatican City, July 7 (Reuters): Pope Benedict issued a decree today authorising wider use of the old Latin Mass, denying criticism within the Church that his move could split Catholics and roll the clock back on reforms.

 The Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) replaced Latin with local languages in the liturgy, reached out to other religions and struck texts which may now stage a comeback that Jews found particularly offensive.

 The worlds 1.1 billion Catholics can now request their local priest to celebrate Mass in Latin and even get baptised or married according to the old Latin rite. If the priest refuses, they can appeal to their bishop and can go all the way to the Vatican. Previously, local bishops had the power to deny use of the Latin Mass.

 Jewish leaders are worried that the move would revive a 1962 missal praying for the conversion of the Jews. But the Popes decree was not immediately clear on that.

 The Good Friday missal asks God to take the veil off Jewish hearts, and to show mercy even for the Jews.

 Weapon culture in line of fire

 Blacksburg (Virginia), April 18 (Reuters): Some of those affected by the shootings at Virginia Tech university were quick to direct their anger and grief not just at the gunman who killed 32 people, but also at the two weapons with which he killed them.

 As students, their parents, staff and local residents struggled today to come to grips with the deadliest gun rampage in modern US history, some said they hoped it might help control Americas long love affair with the gun.

 I thought about it (gun control) when I saw the weapons, and how easy it is to buy those guns, said Chris Keats, 58, of Salina, Kansas, who attended a memorial service in honour of the shooting victims with her daughter, Virginia Tech student Ashleigh Keats, 21, yesterday.

 John, a retired US air force officer and Virginia Tech graduate from Blacksburg, who declined to give his full name, lamented the fact that the gunman, Tech student Cho Seung-Hui, was able to purchase and use the easily concealed handguns.

 I really think handguns are a problem, he said, as opposed to rifles, which are difficult to conceal.

 He said he did not resent those who might see the deaths on the campus as a chance to push for tighter controls on handguns. I dont mind the political ends, if they are good ends, he said.

 About one-third of US households reported having a gun, according to a 2001 government survey. The debate over what restrictions should be placed on gun ownership is a perennial political hot button in the US, and groups that support gun rights are among the best-funded, and most effective lobbyists in US politics.

 The second-largest US gun lobbying group, the Gun Owners of America, said the Virginia Tech shootings proved it was a mistake for the university to ban weapons on campus. If students or faculty had been allowed to carry guns on campus, they might have been able to stop the killer, it said.

 The latest school shooting at Virginia Tech demands an immediate end to the gun-free zone law, which leaves the nations schools at the mercy of madmen, said Larry Pratt, the groups director. 

 Virginia governor Tim Kaine, a Democrat, told an on-campus news conference today, a day after the shootings, that it was too early for a policy debate. For those who want to make this into some little crusade, I say take that elsewhere, let this community deal with grieving individuals, he said.

 The Virginia Tech Pistol and Rifle Club acknowledged in a statement on its website that the right to bear arms certainly has been abused in this instance. 

 But just like airplanes were not forever banned after (September 11), we certainly oppose the unconstitutional act of banning guns, it said.

 French engineering student David Freche, 22, said the shooting brought home the enormous cultural difference between the United States and his homeland. Everyone knows in America there are lots of guns, that it is very easy to get a gun here. Its a huge problem, he said.

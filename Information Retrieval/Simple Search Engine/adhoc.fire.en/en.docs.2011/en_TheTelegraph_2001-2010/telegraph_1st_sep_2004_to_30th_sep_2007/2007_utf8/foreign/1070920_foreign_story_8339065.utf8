 Scared for safety, UK granny to divorce Osama son

 GARY CLELAND

 Jane Felix-Browne with Omar bin Laden in happier times

 London, Sept. 19: A grandmother from Cheshire who married Osama bin Ladens son is divorcing him because she fears for their safety. 

 Jane Felix-Browne, 51, met 27-year-old Omar bin Laden a scrap metal merchant in Egypt in September and married him in April. 

 But the five-times married parish councillor told The Sun that the pair lived in fear of their lives, and that the powerful bin Laden family felt humiliated by the marriage. She said: People are opposed to my marriage because I am British. I wasnt prepared to see the man I love die. 

 It was a really, really good marriage, a strong marriage. But I cannot stand by and watch my beloved husband die before my very eyes. 

 The bin Laden family are afraid of the political implications of a British woman being married to the son of Osama bin Laden. They fear embarrassment and complications, not just in their own country, but in Britain and America. She added: I want him and his son, who is just three, to return to as normal a life as possible. 

 This decision will hopefully take the pressure of Omar and his family. I will never marry again. My heart will always be with Omar and I will take my love for him to the grave. 

 Felix-Browne said her husband had received threatening phone calls about their marriage last week, but would not tell her who they were from. 

 Yesterday, Omar bin Laden who is the fourth eldest son of Osama but has not seen his father since 2000 confirmed the marriage was over. 

 He said: I dont want a divorce but there are serious reasons for this break-up that I cannot talk about. 

 I adore being with this woman, but we cant stand up when the waves from the sea are coming to wipe us out. 

 After their marriage, Felix-Browne told The Times: It would be nice if, like any other married woman, I could stand up and say this is my husband and this is his name, but I have to be realistic about things. She added: I hope people dont judge me too harshly. I married the son, not the father.

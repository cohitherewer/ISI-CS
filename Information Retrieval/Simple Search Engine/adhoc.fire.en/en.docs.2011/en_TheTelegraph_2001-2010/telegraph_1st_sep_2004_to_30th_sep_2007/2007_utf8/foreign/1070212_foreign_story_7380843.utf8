 Nasa diapers butt of jokes

 Los Angeles, Feb. 11: Its the diaper that boldly goes where no incontinence product has gone before. 

 The sordid saga of a love-struck, diaper-clad astronaut has transformed a somewhat obscure Nasa undergarment into a cultural phenomenon. 

 Comedians and bloggers cant get enough of the topic. 

 We will not be stopping for commercials tonight... because I am wearing a diaper, Jay Leno joked on Thursday. 

 And David Letterman told his audience that when police nabbed astronaut Lisa Nowak in Florida, she was wearing a wig and an adult diaper and there was a lot of confusion because authorities originally thought she was Elton John. 

 Meanwhile, Nasa officials have been besieged with questions about their special space diapers, which are officially known as maximum absorption garments. 

 Who manufactures these long-distance disposables? The answer is shrouded in mystery. 

 According to a 1998 Associated Press article, astronauts were outfitted with Depend adult diapers and an inserted pad called Rejoice, made by a Seattle company. But a spokesman for Kimberly-Clark, which makes Depends, insisted the product isnt used in space. And the company apparently went out of business. 

 A collection of astronaut toilet technology at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington revealed few clues. Curator Valerie Neal said she checked the museums eight astro-diapers and found no labels or logos. 

 The aerospace undies, which come in several styles, are worn when astronauts dont have access to the spaceship toilet, Neal said. 

 In the early 1980s, female astronauts relied on zipper-fastened disposable absorption containment trunks. Men wore urine collection devices, which featured a condom-like sheath connected to a tube and pouch. 

 In the 1990s, these orbiting bedpans were exchanged for adult diapers laced with a liquid-absorbing chemical called sodium polyacrylate. 

 On space shuttle missions, each crew member receives three diapers for launch, reentry and a spare in case reentry has to be waved off and tried later.

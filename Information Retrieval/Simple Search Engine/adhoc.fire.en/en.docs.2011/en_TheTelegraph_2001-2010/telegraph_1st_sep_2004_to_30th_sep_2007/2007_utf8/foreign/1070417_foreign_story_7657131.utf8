 Superheroes also get the blues

Tokyo, April 16 (Reuters): Even superheroes get the blues, as Spider-Man discovers in this latest sequel during which he confronts a mutant made of sand, a vengeful former friend and, ultimately, himself.

 Spider-Man 3 is packed with stunning special effects such as the crumbling, morphing Sandman and an evil black suit with a life of its own that brings out a persons dark side, but the characters also show a complexity rarely seen in action movies.

 In the sequel, Peter Parker, played by Tobey Maguire, is finally enjoying life with the beautiful Mary Jane Watson, played by Kirsten Dunst, when he discovers a mysterious suit that enhances his power, but stirs hidden feelings of bitterness and revenge. The ensuing battle between good and evil, revenge and forgiveness, is played out in airborne superhero fights as well as more mundane rows with friends and colleaguese.

 To see Spider-Man cry so much was different, said Gerry Penacoli, a critic for Extra entertainment magazine, after seeing the Spider-Man preview in Tokyo ahead of the premiere.

 Its more intense you still have great action but certainly its the deepest of the three. Kids and adults will learn so much more from this than from a movie thats just wham-shezam, he added.

 The special effects were also a reminder of the production cost of slightly more than $250 million, making the movie a huge financial gamble for Sony Corps Columbia Pictures.

 The gamble paid off for Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2, which grossed $822 million and $783 million, respectively. While sequels tend to do less well than the original movie, Spider-Man 3 could draw new fans with its sophisticated plot.

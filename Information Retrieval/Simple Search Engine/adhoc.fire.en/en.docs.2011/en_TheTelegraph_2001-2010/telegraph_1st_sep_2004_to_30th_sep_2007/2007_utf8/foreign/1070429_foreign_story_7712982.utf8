 57 killed near Karbala shrine

 Karbala, April 28 (Reuters): A suicide car bomber killed 57 people and wounded nearly 160 near one of Iraqs most revered Shia shrines in the city of Karbala today, in an attack likely to inflame sectarian tensions.

 The blast occurred at a checkpoint on an approach to the golden-domed al-Abbas shrine, situated among shops and restaurants in the holy city. The area was crowded at the time, witnesses said.

 Television images showed a man running down a smoke-filled street holding a lifeless baby above his head. Smoke was rising off the child. Ambulances had rushed to the scene in Karbala. Salim Khadhim, a health spokesman, said the blast killed 57 people and wounded nearly 160. Officials said local hospitals had to send some of the wounded to nearby cities because they were unable to cope.

 A car entered the checkpoint for the shrine and blew up in the midst of a crowd of people, said Jasim Najim, a nearby shop owner. The attack bore the hallmarks of Sunni Islamist al Qaida, which US and Iraqi officials accuse of trying to tip Iraq into full-scale civil war between the majority Shias and minority Sunnis.

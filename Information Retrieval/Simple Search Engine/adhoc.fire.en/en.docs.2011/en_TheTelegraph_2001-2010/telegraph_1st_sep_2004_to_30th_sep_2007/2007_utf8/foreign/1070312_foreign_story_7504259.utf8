 French farce

 Rapid City (South Dakota), March 11 (AP): A show where French performance artists vomited, simulated sex and threw fake faeces was stopped by the promoter, who quickly apologised. Lisou Prout and Jean-Louis Costes also stripped and spit potato chips on the crowd at a local arts centre.

 The audience said the act depicted American life from birth to death. The show was stopped after a simulated sex act involving a carrot. I think they got their point across, but... most people... were either completely shocked or disgusted, a member of the audience said.

 Dog saved

 Omaha, Nebraska (AP): A man saved his drowning dog from death by performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Once you get a pet, its truly part of your family, Randy Gurchin said. The dog had jumped into a partly frozen lake in pursuit of ducks. Ten-month-old Lucy is fine now.

 Aziz to US: Dont halt aid

 Terror ultimatum

 Islamabad, April 11 (Reuters): Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz warned the US today against any legislation that makes military aid conditional on its results in fighting terrorism and introducing democratic reforms.

 Azizs comments came after leading US Democrats submitted a non-binding resolution to the Senate calling for such steps. The resolution, submitted by Senators Chris Dodd, John Kerry and Joseph Biden, was reported by the Web edition of the News, Pakistans biggest-selling English-language daily, today.

 Given the sacrifices Pakistan has made in the war on terrorism any legislation critical of Pakistan would involve a negative public reaction that would prove to be counter-productive, Aziz said in remarks to a military symposium organised in Islamabad by the Pakistani and US militaries. 

 President Pervez Musharraf is engulfed in a crisis over moves to sack the countrys supreme court chief justice, but has assured Pakistanis that he will not invoke emergency powers, and that elections due later this year or in 2008 will be on time.

 The USs relationship with its ally in the war on terrorism has been under intense scrutiny for months because of growing frustration over the strength of a Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan, and the failure to capture al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri.

 The sovereignty and territorial integrity is sacrosanct. Our armed forces are fully capable of taking any action required in our territory, Aziz told the audience of military representatives from 22 countries.

 It is counter-productive to engage in accusations and counter-accusations as these only benefit our opponents, he said, adding that quiet diplomacy should be used to settle differences. US leaders habitually praise Musharraf for cooperation in security matters when they meet him.

 Lower-ranking officials, however, often have aired frustration over the presence of what they say are Taliban sanctuaries in Pakistan, and US generals say the insurgencys command and control is located there.

 More UK boys named Muhammad

 London, June 6 (PTI): Muhammad is now the second most popular name for baby boys in Britain, next only to Jack, and is likely to become the most sought after name by the year end, a study indicated today.

 The name, if all 14 different spellings are included, was shared by 5,991 new-born boys last year, beating Thomas into third place (5,921), followed by Joshua (5,808) and Oliver (5,208). There were 6,928 baby boys named Jack in 2006.

 Muhammad, which means one who is praiseworthy, is often given to boys as an honorary prefix and is followed by the name by which they are commonly known. It is regularly cited as the most common name in the world.

 Fine Print

 Dandy drivers

 Kuala Lumpur, Sept. 3 (AP): Malaysian taxi drivers are being told to put their best foot forward, with a shoe on it, and a sock. Or else.

 Authorities have warned taxi drivers of hefty fines if they are caught without socks, shoes and other proper attire prescribed by a licensing board, an official said today.

 The Commercial Vehicle Licensing Board has threatened to crack down on taxi drivers for violating the dress code, which requires taxi drivers to tuck in their shirts which have to be white, not the beige that many have been wearing.

 Pants must be dark, no sandals are allowed, and shoes must be leather ones worn with socks, said board chairman Markiman Kobiran.

 Jodie fear

 New York (AP): Parallels to Martin Scorseses dark classic Taxi Driver led Jodie Foster to take a role in her new movie, The Brave One. The 1976 film portrays a cabby driven to madness amid a crime-ridden and debt-filled New York city climate. The newer film is a story about living with fear in New York after the September 11, 2001, attacks. When I first read the script, honestly, it didnt remind me enough of Taxi Driver, Foster said in an interview in Newsweek magazine. That was one of my issues with it. There was all this room for something more beautiful.

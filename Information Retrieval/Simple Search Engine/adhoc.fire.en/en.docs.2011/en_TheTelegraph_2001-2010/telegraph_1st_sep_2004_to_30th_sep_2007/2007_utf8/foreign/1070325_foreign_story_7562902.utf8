 6 militants held in Bangla raid

 Dhaka, March 24 (AP): Bangladeshi security forces recovered a large cache of bomb-making materials and arrested six suspected Islamic militants today after a raid on an Islamic school, an official said.

 A team belonging to the elite anti-crime force Rapid Action Battalion carried out the raid early today at a village madarsa in Jamalpur district, about 145 km north of Dhaka, the battalions spokesman Gulzaruddin Ahmed said.

 The confiscated materials included 27 packets of gel explosives, 75 grenade casings, 80 grenade covers and a large number of detonators. The agents also seized 117 books and four discs on jihad, Ahmed said.

 He said the men belonged to the Jumatul Mujahideen Bangladesh group, and they were being interrogated in Dhaka. The outlawed group has been blamed for a string of bombings across the nation that have killed 26 people.

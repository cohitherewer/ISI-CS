 Builder claims Dubai tower tallest

 The Burj Dubai tower

 Dubai, July 21 (Reuters): Burj Dubai, a tower under construction in the United Arab Emirates trade hub, became the tallest building in the world today, measuring 512.1 metres, its developer said.

 Burj Dubai is now taller than Taipei 101 in Taiwan, which at 508 metres has held the tallest-building-in-the-world title since it opened in 2004, Emaar Properties, which is developing the Dubai tower, said.

 Burj Dubai has now reached 141 storeys, more storeys than any other building in the world.

 The developer wants the tower, set to be completed next year, to be the worlds tallest building according to all four criteria listed by the Chicago-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat.

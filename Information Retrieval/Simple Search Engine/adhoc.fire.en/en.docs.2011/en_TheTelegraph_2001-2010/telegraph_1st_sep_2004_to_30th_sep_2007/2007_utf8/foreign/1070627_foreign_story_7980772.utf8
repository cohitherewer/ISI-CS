 CIA targeted Castro with gangsters help

 Botched plan

 Washington, June 26 (Reuters): The CIA worked with two of the countrys most-wanted criminals in a botched attempt to assassinate Cuban President Fidel Castro in a gangster-type action in the early 1960s, according to documents released by the CIA today.

 The CIA declassified hundreds of pages of long-secret records that detail some of the agencys worst illegal abuses during about 25 years of overseas assassination attempts, domestic spying and kidnapping.

 The documents are known in the CIA as the Family Jewels, and some describe the agencys efforts to persuade Johnny Roselli, believed to be a mobster, to help plot the assassination of Castro.

 A CIA official at the time, Richard Bissell, in August 1960 approached Colonel Sheffield Edwards of the agencys Office of Security to determine if Edwards had assets that may assist in a sensitive mission requiring gangster-type action, according to the documents.

 The mission target was Fidel Castro, one memo said.

 Roselli was believed by the CIA to have been a high-ranking member of the crime syndicate and who controlled all the ice-making machines on the Las Vegas Strip.

 He was approached by a go-between, Robert Maheu, who reckoned Roselli had connections leading into Cuban gambling interests. The story Roselli was to be told was that several international business firms were suffering heavy financial losses in Cuba as a result of Castros action and they were willing to pay $150,000 for his removal.

 In documents that often read like a cheap detective novel, the story is outlined: The pitch was made to Roselli at the Hilton Plaza Hotel in New York and Roselli was initially cool to the idea. But the contact led the agency to two top mobsters, Momo Salvatore Giancana and Santos Trafficant.

 Giancana, who was known as Sam Gold, suggested firearms might be a problem and said using a potent pill that could be slipped into Castros food or drink might work.

 Eventually, six pills of high lethal content were provided to Juan Orta, identified as a Cuban official who later got cold feet.

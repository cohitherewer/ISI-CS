 Nod to Bangla N-plant

 Dhaka, June 24 (PTI) Bangladesh has received approval from the International Atomic Energy Agency to set up a nuclear power plant.

 Bangladesh has been given the green light for the proposed plant, energy adviser to the interim government Tapan Chowdhury said today.

 He said a delegation from the UN nuclear watchdog would visit Bangladesh next week to work on the issue. Chowdhury said he had also received an offer from South Korea to finance 60 per cent of the project.

 Bangladesh is facing a severe power crisis, forcing authorities to ration electricity supply. Industry is hit by the power cuts, as are common people.

 Officials said that against an estimated demand for at least 5,000mw electricity at peak time, they struggle to produce 3,500mw. 

 Despite increased budgetary sanctions, experts here said they see no overnight solution to the problem. 

 The army-backed interim government of Fakhruddin Ahmed is trying to sign a deal with Myanmar to import hydro-electricity to address the power shortage.

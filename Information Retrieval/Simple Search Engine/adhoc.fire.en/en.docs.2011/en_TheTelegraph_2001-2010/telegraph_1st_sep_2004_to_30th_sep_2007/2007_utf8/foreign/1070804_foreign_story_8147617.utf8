 Pak court frees radical leader

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 Javed Hashmi

 Islamabad, Aug. 3: In another setback for embattled President Pervez Musharraf, the supreme court today ordered the release of firebrand Opposition leader Makhdoom Javed Hashmi, sentenced to 23 years in jail for defaming the army. 

 The order to release Hashmi, de facto leader of the Opposition Pakistan Muslim League led by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, comes a day after Sharif petitioned the court seeking his return to the country.

 A three-member bench, headed by the reinstated Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, ordered Hashmis release on surity bonds worth Rs 50,000. On July 20, a 13-member supreme court bench reinstated Chaudhry and set aside a presidential reference of misconduct against the top judge as unlawful and illegal. 

 The conviction and sentences of the petitioner are suspended and he shall be released forthwith, if not required in any other case, subject to his furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs 50,000, the order said. 

 Hashmi had spoken about the dissatisfaction in the armed forces at a news conference in October 2003. Hashmi had also shown an unsigned letter allegedly written by army officers against Musharraf. 

 The PML-N has welcomed the court order, calling it a victory of democratic forces. 

 Top PML-N leaders said the decision will go a long way in holding free and fair elections in Pakistan.

 Nepalese House can abolish monarchy

 J. HEMANTH 

 Kathmandu, June 14: Nepals lawmakers burned the midnight oil yesterday to adopt an amendment to the interim constitution that empowers the parliament to abolish the monarchy with a two-thirds majority vote. 

 The second amendment to the interim constitution was adopted overwhelmingly with all but two of the 285 lawmakers voting in favour of it at the end of an intense debate, which lasted several hours and spread over many sessions of the interim parliament. 

 However, the amendment says the parliament can move in to remove the king only if it is convinced that he is trying to derail Novembers constituent assembly elections, which will decide the fate of the monarchy. But the move will have to be ratified by two-thirds of the 329-member House. 

 The development is significant because this is the first time ever the 238-year-old monarchy will come under the jurisdiction of parliament. 

 The king, revered till recently as an incarnate of Vishnu, has always been above the law and parliament. 

 The bill was tabled in parliament by Nepals home minister Krishna Sitaula on behalf of law minister Narendra Bikram Nemwang. 

 Before it was adopted, Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala said the second amendment would ensure the constituent assembly elections are held as per schedule. 

 Earlier, a special committee of parliament formed on Tuesday and headed by Nepali Congress Democratic leader Purna Bahadur Khadka, had approved the bill with some changes in the draft presented by the cabinet. 

 The bill also has a provision to sack the Prime Minister with a two-thirds majority vote.

 Fine Print

 Dress by Madonna

 London, Feb. 10: Madonna the worlds highest earning female performer, worth an estimated 165 million still has time for a few little jobs on the side, reports The Daily Telegraph.

 Working closely with the Swedish fashion chain H amp;M, she has helped to create a high street collection closely based on her own glamorous wardrobe staples. 

 The range, M by Madonna, goes on sale next month and includes chic belted trench coats, an elegant black jersey maxi dress, a fitted, 1970s-inspired bomber jacket and skinny black trousers.

 Hole-in-socks horror

 Singapore (Reuters): Cut-outs in clothing may be cool, but when in Asia, make sure they stop at your socks. Holes are the ultimate fashion faux-pas in this region, where taking off your shoes is a courtesy expected at social, religious and professional events. World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz made news and raised eyebrows this week when he was photographed stepping into a mosque in Turkey wearing grey socks riddled with holes.

 Fine dining

 Bangkok (AP): Beluga caviar, truffles and Dom Perignon sorbet were on the menu on Saturday for a night of fine dining in Bangkok that chefs, wine experts and organisers have dubbed the meal of a lifetime. Some of the worlds wealthiest food lovers have flown in for the dinner, which carries a price tag of $25,000 (euro19,000) a head.

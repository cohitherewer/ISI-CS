 Less sleep raises heart disease risk

 London, Sept. 24 (Reuters): People who do not get enough sleep are more than twice as likely to die of heart disease, according to a large British study released today.

 Although the reasons are unclear, researchers said lack of sleep appeared to be linked to increased blood pressure, which is known to raise the risk of heart attacks and stroke.

 A 17-year analysis of 10,000 government workers showed those who cut their sleep from seven hours a night to five or less faced a 1.7-fold increased risk of death from all causes and more than double the risk of cardiovascular death.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 King owns up coup blame

 Gyanendra 

 Kathmandu, Feb. 19 (Agencies): Isolated King Gyanendra defended his short-lived grab for absolute power two years ago in a rare public statement today that sparked protests from political parties that accused him of illegally meddling in politics.

 In a traditional Democracy Day message to the public, the king said he was compelled to seize power because the government had failed to conduct elections and provide public security.

 It is clear that the situation compelled us to take the February 1, 2005, step in accordance with the peoples aspiration to reactivate the elected bodies by maintaining law and order, Gyanendra said.

 Security forces cracked down on demonstrations against his rule. At least 25 protesters died and hundreds of Opposition politicians, journalists and students were jailed.

 Facing unrelenting protests and international pressure, the king relinquished control in April 2006, reinstating Parliament and appointing veteran politician Girija Prasad Koirala as Prime Minister.

 Gyanendra took responsibility today for the fallout from his takeover. We are also morally responsible for any success or failure during the 15-month effort, he said.

 The new government and Parliament have stripped the king of his powers and ended his command over the army. A special assembly will be elected in June to rewrite the constitution and decide if Nepal should continue to have a king.

 Gyanendra said Nepals new leadership, which will include former communist rebels, must abide by democratic principles and work towards fulfilling the wishes of the people. In order to consolidate multiparty democracy, elected representative bodies must be installed, taking into consideration, in a mature manner, the grievances, aspirations and sentiments of all the Nepalese to the satisfaction of all.

 The Nepalese people alone are the arbitrators of their own destiny and they wish to build a prosperous Nepal through a meaningful exercise in multiparty democracy.

 The kings statement sparked sharp criticisms from the Maoist leadership. Maoist chairman Prachanda said it was a conspiracy hatched to foil efforts to hold the constituent assembly election in June.

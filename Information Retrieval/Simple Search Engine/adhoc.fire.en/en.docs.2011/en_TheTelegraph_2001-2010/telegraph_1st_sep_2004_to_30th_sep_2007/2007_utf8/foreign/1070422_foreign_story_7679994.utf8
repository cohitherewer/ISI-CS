 No deal with Benazir, says Musharraf

 Islamabad, April 21 (PTI): Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf today said there was no deal at all with former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and insisted that he would not quit as army chief till the general elections.

 Theres no deal at all, no alliance, no deal with Benazir, Musharraf told the Dubai-based Al-Arabia television channel in an interview.

 He said the general elections would be held by the end of the year in a fair and transparent manner and any political action will be based on the result of the polls.

 Musharraf also said he was legally entitled to continue President and army chief. I am not removing the uniform till the elections because I have been allowed constitutionally to remain the President and the chief of the army staff till the end of the year, he said without elaborating.

 He said it was decided by parliament with a two-thirds majority to keep the two offices at a time.

 According to media reports, Musharraf had been pursuing a deal with Benazir under pressure from the US. 

 In the interview, Musharraf said any change in Pakistan would be through a political process by its people and not due to any outside pressure.

 Fair, free and impartial elections would be held this year according to the constitution of the country, Musharraf said. This is election year and we will follow the constitution of Pakistan.

 On relations with the US, Musharraf dispelled the impression that the ties were under strain over ways to tackle the Taliban.

 Musharraf said US and Pakistan had excellent contacts. We have excellent intelligence cooperation, we have excellent cooperation at the strategical and operational levels.

 He said there was complete understanding between him and President Bush. So there was no doubt about Pakistans role and importance in the war against terrorism.

 Musharraf said there were certain areas where there could be difference of perception. However, that did not mean that the US doubts Pakistans role in war against terrorism or Musharrafs resolve or intention to fight the taliban or extremists, the Pakistan President said.

 Tehran spy charge on three US-Iranians

 Haleh Esfandiari

 Tehran, May 29 (Reuters): Iran has charged three Iranian-Americans with spying, a judiciary spokesman said today.

 The espionage charges were announced just one day after the US and Iran held their most high-profile talks in almost 30 years. The Baghdad discussions between the two foes were restricted solely to Iraq. The judiciary spokesman said the three facing spy charges were academic Haleh Esfandiari, social scientist Kian Tajbakhsh and journalist Parnaz Azima.

 Under Irans Islamic sharia law, the charge could carry the death sentence.

 Tehran accuses Washington of using intellectuals and others inside the country to undermine the Islamic state through what it calls velvet revolution. The US has dismissed the accusation.

 Iran has arrested, detained or prevented a number of US-Iranian citizens from leaving the country, including Esfandiari, the director of the US Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars Middle East programme. Washington has condemned the arrest of Esfandiari, detained on May 8 for acting against national security and spying.

 Judiciary spokesman Alireza Jamshidi said the intelligence ministry was investigating the case of Tajbakhsh. Tajbakhshs charges are acting against Irans national security ... and spying for foreigners, Jamshidi told a weekly news conference.

 The intelligence ministry has launched the complaint against him and investigations are at preliminary stages. The New York-based Open Society Institute said last week the social scientist and urban planner had been arrested and imprisoned in Iran around May 11.

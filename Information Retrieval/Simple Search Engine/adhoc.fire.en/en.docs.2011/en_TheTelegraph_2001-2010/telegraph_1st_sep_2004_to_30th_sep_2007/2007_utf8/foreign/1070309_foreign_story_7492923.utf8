 Gates renews fight for H-1B visas

 ANNE BROACHE

 Urgent plea

 Washington, March 8: Microsoft chairman Bill Gates yesterday renewed his fight for infinite H-1B guest-worker visas and improvements in US education before largely receptive senators on Capitol Hill. 

 In only his third appearance ever at a congressional hearing, Gates urged politicians here on the US Senate Health, Education, Labour and Pensions Committee to pursue a three-pronged approach to boosting the nations competitiveness:

 Equipping American students and teachers with necessary math and science skills,

 Elevating research spending, and

 Rewriting immigration laws to allow American companies to hire more foreigners. 

 The US has much to be proud of in the technology realm, Gates told the politicians, but when I reflect on the state of American competitiveness, my feeling of pride is mixed with deep anxiety.

 On education, Gates called for doubling the number of science, technology and math graduates in the US by 2015. Doing that, he told the committee, requires more funding. 

 Politicians indicated they were also willing to take cues from Gates as they craft new laws in the immigration area. In his testimony, Gates said theres only one way to solve what he deemed a crisis level shortage of qualified scientific talent: Open our doors to highly talented scientists and engineers who want to live, work and pay taxes here. 

 Gates repeated a now-familiar plea by high-tech companies for an overhaul of the H-1B visa system. Established in 1990, that programme currently awards 65,000 visas to foreigners with at least a bachelors degree in their area of specialty and allows them to remain employed in the US for up to six years. 

 Gates said theres a terrible shortfall in the number of visas available to high-tech companies and cautioned that the nation will find it infinitely more difficult to maintain its technological leadership if it shuts out the very people who are most able to help us compete. America has always done its best when we brought the best minds to our shores, Gates said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Govt lawyer quits after loss

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 Islamabad, July 23: Pakistan attorney-general Makhdoom Ali Khan resigned today over his ministrys failure to win the case against Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry in the supreme court.

 His resignation comes amid reports that law minister Wasi Zafar may also step down.

 Geo TV channel quoted government officials as saying that Khan today sent his resignation to President Musharraf. However, none of the officials, including law secretary law Justice Mansoor Ahmad were able to confirm the attorney- generals resignation. The President has asked the attorney- general to continue till the appointment of his successor, the channel said. One of the officials in the law ministry told The Telegraph on condition of anonymity that the the law minister is also under fire for the weak performance of his ministry and may have to step down. Zafar remained unavailable to comment on the situation despite repeated calls made on his cellphone. 

 Media reports also claimed today that the government is trying to find a scapegoat after the supreme court set aside the reference against Chaudhry. According to the reports, the most likely candidate seems to be Khan. Political leaders have demanded that Musharraf, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz and Zafar should resign.

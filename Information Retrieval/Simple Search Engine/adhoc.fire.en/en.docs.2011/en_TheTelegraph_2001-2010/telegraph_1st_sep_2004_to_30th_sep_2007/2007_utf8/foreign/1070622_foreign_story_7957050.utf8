 Austin (Texas), June 21 (AP): A crowd at a large outdoor party attacked and killed a passenger in a vehicle that apparently had struck and injured a child, police said.

 Investigators were struggling to piece together what happened on Tuesday when David Rivas Morales died defending the driver from members of a crowd leaving a celebration. There could have been anywhere from two to 20 attackers, Austin police commander Harold Piatt said.

 The car in which Morales, 40, was a passenger had entered an apartment complexs parking lot when it struck a 4-year-old child, Piatt said. The child was taken to a hospital where his condition was said to be not life-threatening.

 The driver got out of the car to check on the child and was confronted by several people, Piatt said. When they attacked the driver, Morales got out of the car to protect the driver and was attacked as well. Police said no guns or knives were used.

 The driver got away and is cooperating with investigators, who are not releasing his name. Margaret Morales said a young boy came to her door to tell her that her brother was lying on the ground outside. She found David Morales, sprawled on the pavement 30.48 metres from her townhouse, battered and choking on blood.

 Police arrived one minute after receiving an emergency call, by which time the beating had stopped. But the Morales family complained that medical help was slow in coming.

 David Morales arrived at the hospital about 35 minutes after the emergency call was received, an Austin emergency services spokesman said. Emergency officials said police ordered them to wait until the area was secure.

 An estimated 2,000 to 3,000 people were in the area for a city-sponsored festival for Juneteenth, which commemorates Texas slaves getting the word that they had been freed.

 Several hundred people had filled the parking lot and street as the festival at a nearby park ended and spilled over into the surrounding neighbourhoods, said Katherine White, a Morales friend, said.

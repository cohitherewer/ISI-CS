 Spears charged in LA crash

 Smashed

 Los Angeles, Sept. 22 (AP): Britney Spears legal woes mounted yesterday as prosecutors charged her with misdemeanour counts of hit and run and driving without a valid licence after she allegedly smashed her car into another in a parking lot in August.

 If convicted, the singer could face up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine for each count, said Nick Velasquez, a spokesman for the city attorneys office. 

 Spears, 25, was filmed by the paparazzi on August 6 steering her car into another vehicle as she tried to turn into a spot in a parking lot. After assessing the damage to her car only, she was shown on paparazzi video as walking away. Three days after the accident, the owner of the other vehicle filed a police report. Investigators later determined that Spears did not have a licence, officials said.

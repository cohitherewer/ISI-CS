 Tehran warns US

 Tehran, March 26 (Reuters): Irans elite Revolutionary Guards warned the US against attacking the Islamic republic, a news agency reported today, two days after the UN imposed new sanctions on Iran.

 However, the White House accused Iran today of turning a blind eye to its UN obligations by limiting nuclear cooperation but reiterated that the United States has no intention of going to war with Iran.

 If America starts a war against Iran, it wont be the one who finishes it, Morteza Saffari, naval forces commander of the Revolutionary Guards, was quoted as saying by the ISNA news agency. Our people will not even allow one American soldier to enter our country, he said.

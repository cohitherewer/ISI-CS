 Bush thrilled by son

 Washington, Sept. 6 (Reuters): President George W. Bush, who sometimes treats his dog Barney like the son he never had, was thrilled about his daughters engagement because now he will get a son for real, First Lady Laura Bush said yesterday.

 Jenna, one of the Presidents twin daughters, became engaged last month to longtime suitor Henry Hager, who comes from a prominent Republican family and worked in Bushs re-election campaign. 

 You all know that George is thrilled to have a son, finally, because hes been calling Barney the son he never had, the First Lady joked to a small group of journalists at the end of an interview on Myanmar. The engagement has prompted a flurry of speculation about the possibility of a White House wedding. But the brides mother did not spill the beans.

 Well Im not going to announce where the weddings going to be because actually we havent quite figured it all out, Bush said. The plans will become more solid after Jennas book tour, she said.

 Obama slip

 New York, Jan. 3: CNN apologised yesterday for mistakenly promoting a story on the search for Osama bin Laden with the headline: Wheres Obama?

 A spokesman for Illinois Senator Barack Obama said the apology was accepted.

 The blunder came on Monday evening on Wolf Blitzers news show The Situation Room. Both Soledad Brien and Blitzer offered separate apologies during CNNs morning show yesterday. CNN called it a bad typographical error by its graphics department. We want to apologise for that bad typo, Blitzer said. We also want to apologise personally to Senator Barack Obama. Im going to be making a call to him later this morning to offer my personal apology.

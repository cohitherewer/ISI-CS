 Fine Print

 BBC windows

 London, May 13: First it was claimed that it took five staff to change a light bulb at the BBC. Then staff complained it cost 10. Now the BBC seems to be having trouble with natural light, says The Sunday Telegraph.

 Staff in the new Broadcast Centre and Media Centre have been told not to adjust the blinds on their windows without specialist assistance because of safety concerns. The prob lem began last month when a worker in the Broadcast Centre in White City, west London, tugged at a roll-down blind. The metal casing on top fell down and hit her in the mouth. It is understood she did not require hospital treatment and is back at work.

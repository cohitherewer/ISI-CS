 Pencil problem

 Berlin, Aug. 6 (Reuters): A 59-year-old German woman has had most of a pencil removed from inside her head after suffering nearly her whole life with the headaches and nosebleeds it caused, Bild newspaper reported today.

 Margret Wegner fell over carrying the pencil in her hand when she was four. The pencil went right through my skin and disappeared into my head, Wegner told the newspaper.

 It narrowly missed vital parts of her brain. At the time no one dared operate, but now technology has improved sufficiently for doctors to be able to remove it.

 The majority of the pencil, some 8 cm long, was taken out in an operation at a private Berlin clinic, but the 2 cm tip had grown in so firmly that it was impossible to remove.

 Bourne box

 Los Angeles (AP): Super

 spy Jason Bourne delivered more than an ultimatum

 this weekend as the third in a series of spy

 thrillers topped box office charts and delivered

 the biggest August opening of a film ever. The Bourne Ultimatum took

 in $70.2 million this weekend, the most of

 any of the Bourne films based on novels by

 Robert Ludlum. It also topped the opening

 of the previous Bourne film by nearly $20

 million. The opening also pushed last weeks

 top film, The Simpsons Movie, to second

 place, with $25.6 million. 

 Jam fest

 Chicago (Reuters): Veteran rock group Pearl Jam closed the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago with a muscular two-hour set for an enthusiastic, if tired and sunburnt, crowd. Earlier on Sunday, 60-year-old Iggy Pop, punk rocker before the term was even coined, turned back the clock with an energetic performance applauded by fans old and new. Others playing at day three of the event included Modest Mouse from Issaquah.

 Man vents anger at computer

 Berlin, July 17 (Reuters): A German man who startled his neighbours when he hurled his computer out of the window in the middle of the night, was let off for disturbing the peace by police who sympathised with his technical frustrations.

 Police in the northern city of Hanover said they would not press charges after responding to calls made by residents in an apartment block who were woken by a loud crash in the early hours of Saturday.

 Officers found the street and pavement covered in electronic parts and discovered who the culprit was.

 Asked what had driven him to the night-time outburst, the 51-year-old man said he had simply got annoyed with his computer.

 Who hasnt felt like doing that? said a police spokesman.

 While escaping any official sanction the man was made to clear up the debris.

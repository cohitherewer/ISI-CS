 US braves rage, bombs Somalia

 Mogadishu, Jan. 10 (Reuters): US forces hunting al Qaida suspects hit four sites in air strikes in southern Somalia today, a Somali government source said, as international criticism mounted over Washingtons military intervention.

 As we speak now, the area is being bombarded by the American air force, he said.

 The source said the attacks hit an area close to Ras Kamboni, a coastal village near the Kenyan border where many fugitive Islamists are believed holed-up after being ousted by Ethiopian troops defending Somalias interim government.

 Four places were hit Hayo, Garer, Bankajirow and Badmadowe, the source said. Bankajirow was the last Islamist holdout. Bankajirow and Badmadowe were hit hardest, he added.

 Pentagon officials confirmed one air attack on Monday, as part of a wider offensive involving Ethiopian planes.

 The strike was aimed at an al Qaida cell said by Washington to include suspects in the 1998 bombings of US embassies in east Africa and a 2002 attack on a hotel in Kenya.

 Somali officials said many died in Mondays strike the first overt US military action in Somalia since a disastrous humanitarian mission ended in 1994.

 A Somali clan elder reported a second US air strike yesterday, but that was not confirmed by other sources.

 The US actions were defended by Somali President Abdullahi Yusuf, but criticised by others, including new UN chief Ban Ki-moon, the European Union, and former colonial power Italy.

 The secretary-general is concerned about the new dimension this kind of action could introduce to the conflict and the possible escalation of hostilities that may result, official Michele Montas said.

 Italian foreign minister Massimo DAlema said Rome opposed unilateral initiatives that could spark new tensions in an area that is already very destabilised.

 Mondays attack on a southern village by an AC-130 plane firing automatic cannon was believed to have killed one of three al Qaida suspects wanted for the 1998 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, a US intelligence official said.

 Washington is seeking a handful of al Qaida members, including Abu Talha al-Sudani, named in grand jury testimony against Osama bin Laden as al Qaidas east Africa commander.

 Critics of the action say it could misfire by creating strong Somali resentment and feeding Islamist militancy. 

 Before this, it was just tacit support for Ethiopia. Now the US has fingerprints on the intervention and is going to be held more accountable, said Horn of Africa expert Ken Menkhaus. This has the potential for a backlash both in Somalia and the region.

 Ethiopia sent troops across the border last year to oust Islamists who had held most of the south since June and threatened to overrun the weak government at its base.

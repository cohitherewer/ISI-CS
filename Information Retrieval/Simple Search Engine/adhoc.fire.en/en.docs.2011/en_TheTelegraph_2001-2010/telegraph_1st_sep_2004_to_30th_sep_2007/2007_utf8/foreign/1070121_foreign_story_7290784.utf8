 Iraq crash

 Baghdad, Jan. 20 (Reuters): A US military helicopter crashed northeast of Baghdad today, killing all 13 military personnel on board, but US officials gave no immediate details on the cause.

 It was one of the deadliest single incidents for US forces since the 2003 invasion and the bloodiest since President George W. Bush announced an increase in troop numbers that has run into opposition among Democrats now controlling Congress.

 US :Pak travel dangerous

 Washington, Sept. 22 (AP): The US state department has reissued a travel warning for Pakistan that said the threat of terrorist activity makes non-essential travel there too dangerous.

 The warning, superseding one issued 10 months ago, said Americans could be targeted by al Qaida and Taliban elements as well as by members of sectarian Pakistani groups. 

 Pervasive violence in West Asia could increase the danger not only for Americans but for other westerners as well, the state department said.

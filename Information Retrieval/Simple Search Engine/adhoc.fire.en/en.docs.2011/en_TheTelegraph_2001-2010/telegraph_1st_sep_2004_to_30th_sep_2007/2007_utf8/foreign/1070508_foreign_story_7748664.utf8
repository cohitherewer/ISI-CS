 Paris, May 7 (Reuters): French President-elect Nicolas Sarkozy disappeared on a retreat with his family today to consider his government line-up and plot strategy for a crucial parliamentary election in June.

 Sarkozy, a combative conservative, won a strong mandate for political and economic change by winning 53.06 per cent of the vote in yesterdays presidential run-off against 46.94 for Socialist Segolene Royal.

 But he needs to secure a majority in the election for the National Assembly on June 10 and 17 to make good on his vows to loosen rigid labour laws, trim fat from the public service, cut taxes and restore full employment.

 We are going to see how we can give him the biggest parliamentary majority possible so he can put into effect his undertakings, defence minister Michele Alliot-Marie told reporters outside Sarkozys campaign headquarters.

 Sarkozy left Paris in the morning with his wife and son, after spending the night in a luxury Paris hotel, and they were widely expected to spend a few days on the Mediterranean island of Corsica to recharge his batteries.

 These few days rest were planned to put him more in the mindset of a President after the tumultuous battle, said Claude Gueant, his campaign director.

 His victory was marred by overnight clashes across France between police and anti-Sarkozy protesters. Police said they arrested 592 people after demonstrators set fire to 730 cars and injured 78 policemen in numerous incidents. Some of the worst violence occurred around Pariss famous Bastille Square where youths went on the rampage, smashing phone cabins and shop windows.

 Sarkozy, the son of a Hungarian immigrant, will take office on May 16, succeeding President Jacques Chirac who is standing down after 12 years in power.

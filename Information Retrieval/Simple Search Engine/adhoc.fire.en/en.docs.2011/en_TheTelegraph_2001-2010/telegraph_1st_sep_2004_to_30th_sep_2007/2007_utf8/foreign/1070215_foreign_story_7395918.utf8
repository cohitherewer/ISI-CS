 Nepal in jaundice grip

 Kathmandu, Feb. 14 (PTI): With Nepal Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala and six of his cabinet colleagues suffering from jaundice, the government has warned people across the Himalayan nation to take precautions against the disease.

 The Prime Minister, six ministers and 12 to 15 members of the staff at the PMs residence are suffering from jaundice, said Koiralas nephew Shekhar, who is also a central committee member in the Nepali Congress.

 The government said the disease is spreading fast across the Kathmandu valley and urged people in the capital to take precautions.

 Drink only boiled water, eat fresh, well-cooked and hygienic food, refrain from eating stale food and wash hands with soap before taking meals, the home ministry said in a statement. Jaundice is transmitted through the consumption of contaminated water and unhygienic food. 

 Six ministers of the Seven-Party Alliance government, including deputy Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli, are suffering from jaundice. The government found sewage leaking into the water pipe connected to Koiralas residence.

 Enough of Shrek, Diaz explores Inca capital

 Lima, June 20 (AP): Having wrapped up a publicity tour for Shrek the Third that took her to London and Taiwan, the voice of Princess Fiona set her sights on the real kingdom of Far Far Away the ancient Incan capital of Cuzco in the Peruvian Andes.

 Undeterred by the altitude Cuzco is some 3,350 meters above sea level Cameron Diaz explored the cobblestone streets yesterday just a few hours after her arrival with a group of nine people. She also plans to visit the jungle-shrouded Inca citadel of Machu Picchu and other ruins in the area during her week-long stay, according to Luis Ponce La Jara, who is helping with her security.

 Shes on vacation, Ponce La Jara said.

 In the latest Shrek movie, Fiona mentors Snow White, Cinderella and other princesses, teaching them not to wait around for their princes to come. And Diaz didnt hold back on her first day in Cuzco, hiking up steep and narrow streets with a wide smile.

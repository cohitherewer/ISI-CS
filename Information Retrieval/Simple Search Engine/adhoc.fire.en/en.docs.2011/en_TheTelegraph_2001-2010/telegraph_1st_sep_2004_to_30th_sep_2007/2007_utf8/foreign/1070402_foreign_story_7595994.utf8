 Winkie upstart

 Los Angeles, April 1 (Reuters): So hes faster than a speeding bullet and can leap tall buildings, but there is one thing Superman cannot top a Winkie.

 At least, not according to Joe Maddalena. 

 The Hollywood memorabilia experts auction house on April 5 is holding one of its widely followed sales of movie and television items.

 Heading the list is a Winkie costume from the 1939 movie The Wizard of Oz, expected to fetch between $100,000 and $120,000 roughly double the $50,000 to $70,000 estimated sales price for actor Christopher Reeves costume from his first Superman film.

 Scotty trek

 Phoenix (Reuters): The remains of actor James Doohan, who played the starship Enterprises chief engineer Scotty on Star Trek, will be blasted into space later this month, the company organising the flight said. The Canadian-born actor who inspired the catchphrase Beam me up, Scotty even though it was never actually uttered on the TV show died two years ago at the age of 85.

 Royal drink

 London (PTI): Expressing concern about the drinking habits of Prince William and Prince Harry, royal security officers have cautioned that the princes were putting themselves to unnecessary risk. Harry, 22, fell outside a London nightclub in the late hours last weekend after an alleged spat with a paparazzi photographer, the Sunday Express reported. On Saturday, William was pictured revelling with night-clubbers in Dorset.

 Hasina accounts to be frozen

 Dhaka, Aug. 3 (Reuters): Bangladeshs tax authority has asked all commercial banks to freeze accounts of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her five family members.

 Hasinas husband M. Wajed Miah, sister Sheikh Rehana, son Sajeeb Wajed Joy and daughter Saima Wajed Putul and her husband are on the freeze list.

 All have bank accounts in Bangladesh, tax officials said, but only Hasina and her husband live in the country. The National Board of Revenue (NBR) issued the freeze order.

 It also ordered bank accounts of former foreign minister M. Morshed Khan, state minister for home affair Lutfuzzaman Babar who both served in the government of former Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia and 47 other people, NBR officials said. Hasina has been detained since July 16 on charges of extortion and is being held inside a building that has been turned into a special jail.

 Handcuffed Paris taken to court

 Los Angeles, June 8 (Reuters): Paris Hilton was put in handcuffs and taken from her home in a sheriffs car for a court hearing today that could end with the socialite being sent back to jail to serve out a three-week sentence.

 Hilton, 26, was transferred from jail to house arrest yesterday for unspecified medical reasons after serving only three days of a 23-day sentence. That decision outraged local politicians and brought charges of celebrity privilege.

 Los Angeles city prosecutors filed papers late yesterday demanding that Hilton be returned to jail.

 They also demanded that the Los Angeles Sheriffs Department, which runs the jail system, be held in contempt for releasing her early and violating the sentencing order, which expressly barred electronic monitoring of Hilton.

 Hilton had been expected to testify by video conference from her lavish Hollywood Hills home, but Judge Michael Sauer told sheriffs to bring her to court.

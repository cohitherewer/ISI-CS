 Civilians killed

 Miranshah (Pakistan), June 23 (Reuters): Ten civilians were killed when international forces battling Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan fired across the border into Pakistan, the military said today.

 Afghanistans Nato-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said troops clashed with a large group of insurgents near the Pakistani border in Paktika province, killing 40. Pakistani military spokesman Major-General Waheed Arshad said some rockets fired by the international forces flew over the border into Pakistans North Waziristan region during last nights battle.

 Some rockets were fired across and landed in our area. They hit a couple of houses and 10 people died, civilians who were living there, and 14 were injured, Arshad said.

 We asked for an explanation from the (US) coalition and Afghan authorities and they apologised and said it was inadvertent firing, he said.

 The fighting was in an area that is a known route for Taliban activists infiltrating into Afghanistan from Pakistan but Arshad said he had no information about any infiltrators.

 Pervez term

 Islamabad, April 23 (Reuters): President Pervez Musharraf will be elected for a second term in office by the sitting parliament before it is dissolved ahead of general elections due later this year or early 2008, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz said.

 While Musharraf has made no secret of his plans to stand for a second term, the comment from Aziz was the clearest sign yet the President will take a route that opposition groups have labelled unconstitutional.

 The election of the President is due in September-October this year ... and President Musharraf will be re-elected by the present assemblies with comfortable majority, state-run Associated Press of Pakistan quoted Aziz as saying late yesterday.

 The Prime Ministers remark comes at a time when the country is abuzz with speculation that Musharraf is hatching some form of power-sharing deal with former premier Benazir Bhutto, which would allow her to return home after nearly a decade living in self-exile to avoid a raft of corruption charges. Under Pakistans constitution, the National Assembly and Senate along with the four provincial assemblies elect the President, and Musharrafs allies enjoy a majority in the sitting parliament. The next parliament may elect him, the next parliament may not elect him, Shafqat Mehmood, a political commentator, said.

 By getting himself re-elected from the sitting parliament, it means he obviously wants to get a guarantee that he is here for the next five years, no matter who wins the next elections.

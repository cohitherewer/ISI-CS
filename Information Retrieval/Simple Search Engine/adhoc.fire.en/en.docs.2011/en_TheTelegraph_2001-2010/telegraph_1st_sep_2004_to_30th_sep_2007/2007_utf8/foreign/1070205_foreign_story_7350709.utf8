The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Bangla crackdown on leaders

 new poll panel chief

 Retired bureaucrat A.T.M. Shamsul Huda has been appointed as Bangladesh rsquo;s new chief election commissioner, the information ministry said on Sunday. 

 Huda will replace M.A. Aziz, a former justice minister, who resigned on January 21 following violent protests demanding his 

 removal. 

Dhaka, Feb. 4 (Agencies): Security forces in Bangladesh detained seven former ministers and several other influential politicians from across the political spectrum today in swoops on their Dhaka homes.

 They were the most high-profile figures to be detained since the declaration of a state of emergency on January 11, which followed weeks of street protests and pre-election violence.

 An election planned for late January was postponed, and the interim government charged with holding the poll has vowed to root out corruption from politics and the administration.

 Those detained in the capital before dawn today included former interior minister Mohammad Nasim and former minister Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir of the Awami League.

 Nasims son, Tanmoy Mansur, said his father was taken away by a squad of police and army around 1.30 am. They gave no reason but said the order to detain him came from the top, Tanmoy said.

 Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) figures detained included former communications minister Nazmul Huda and state ministers Ruhul Kuddus Talukder, Mir Nasiruddin, Amanullah Aman and Iqbal Hasan Mahmud.

 Security officials confirmed the detentions and said the drive would continue as part of the governments bid to organise a fair, peaceful and credible election.

 The interim authority headed by former central bank chief Fakhruddin Ahmed is strongly backed by the armed forces, which are acting behind the scenes, apparently to keep their international peacekeeping profile high.

 In Tongi, on the banks of the river Turag, outside Dhaka, around three million Muslim devotees raised their hands in prayer seeking global peace and harmony at one of the worlds biggest mass religious congregations that concluded today. 

 Many of the pilgrims were on boats or on the rooftops of nearby buildings as the crowd overflowed the designated venue. President Iajuddin Ahmed, the countrys interim leader Fakhruddin Ahmed and two former Prime Ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina joined the prayer today.

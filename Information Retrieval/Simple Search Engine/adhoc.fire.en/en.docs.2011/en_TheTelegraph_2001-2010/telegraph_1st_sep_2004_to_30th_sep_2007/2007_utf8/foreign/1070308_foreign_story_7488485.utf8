 Inspired by Unicef, Jenna plans book

 Jenna: Hope message

 New York, March 7 (AP): First daughter Jenna Bush is writing a non-fiction book for young adults, Anas Story: A Journey of Hope, that will focus on a 17-year-old single mother who is HIV positive.

 Based on her time working for Unicef, the UN childrens agency, the book will be published this autumn by HarperCollins. 

 I have been inspired by my work with adolescents in Central and South America, Jenna Bush said in a statement released by her publisher yesterday.

 These young people have faced extreme hardships and exclusion but are strong in spirit and have an incredible will to succeed. Through their stories, it is my hope to motivate young Americans to increase their awareness of other young people around the world: to learn about the challenges they face, how they triumph over adversity, and to become involved in helping them.

 Financial terms were not disclosed, although bidding had reportedly topped $300,000 (euro229,000). 

 Bush, 25, has been a Unicef intern since autumn 2006, working in Argentina, Paraguay and Panama, where she is now teaching at a shelter. We were very moved by Jennas passion for this project, Susan Katz, president and publisher of HarperCollins Childrens Books, said in a statement. Her message in this book is about hope.

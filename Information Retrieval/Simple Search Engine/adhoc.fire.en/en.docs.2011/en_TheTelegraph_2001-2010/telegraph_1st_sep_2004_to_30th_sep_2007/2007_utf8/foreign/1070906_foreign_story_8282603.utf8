 Bodily harm

 London, Sept. 5: The actor Jude Law has been arrested after allegedly attacking a photographer outside his London home.

 The star of Alfie and upcoming film Sleuth is said to have attempted to grab the photographers camera in the alleged incident in Maida Vale, west London yesterday.

 The 34-year-old was held on suspicion of actual bodily harm and bailed to return to a London police station in October. 

 A police spokesman said: A 34-year-old man from Maida Vale was arrested yesterday on suspicion of actual bodily harm after voluntarily attending a London police station.

 The arrest followed an allegation of assault yesterday at a residential address in Maida Vale.

 The 34-year-old man was released on bail to a date in October pending further inquiries.

 Law, the former husband of the actress Sadie Frost, recently returned from the Venice Film Festival where he showcased Sleuth, in which he co-stars with Sir Michael Caine. Law is also producing the film.

 The remake is in contention for the Golden Lion prize for best film in Venice.

 A spokesman for Law was unavailable for comment.

 Bangla govt bars Hasinas US visit

 Travel trouble

 Dhaka, June 14 (Reuters): A Bangladesh court has barred former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from leaving the country, police said today, two months after she was briefly banned from returning home.

 The court ordered Dhaka airports immigration authority not to allow Hasina, who has been charged with extortion, to leave for the US via London tomorrow night.

 Hasinas close associates said she had been planning to visit her son and daughter and their families in the US.

 The court order came after police had sought legal intervention to prevent Hasina from flying out, because her presence in the country was essential for investigation of a series of extortion charges against her, said a court registrar.

 In April Bangladeshs army-backed interim government, which is conducting a massive anti-corruption hunt to prepare for a free and fair election, barred Hasina from returning from an earlier visit to the US. She was stranded in London for about two weeks, before local and international pressure forced Dhaka to lift the ban.

 Today, police blocked a trip by Hasina to Chittagong to visit survivors of landslides that have killed at least 122 people and injured about 100.

 Hasina branded the Chittagong ban as inhuman, undemocratic, unconstitutional and against the freedom of (the) individual.

 The police filed two new cases against her yesterday for extorting some 70 million taka ($1 million) from two businessmen.

 Mainul Husein, adviser to the interim government and head of the law ministry said today: The situation is not yet congenial to lift the ban on indoor politics.

 The election commission had recently urged the government to lift the indoor politics ban to enable discussions with party leaders about preparing a digital voters list.

 Reforms questioned

 Sheikh Hasina has questioned attempts to usher in reforms in her party as well as its main political rival BNP, wondering if this was aimed at easing her and Begum Khaleda Zia out of the parties, reports PTI. 

 Does reform mean Awami League without me and BNP without its chairperson (Khaleda)? Its mysterious, UNB news agency quoted Hasina as saying yesterday. 

 There should be reform not only in Awami League and BNP but also in all political parties, she said.

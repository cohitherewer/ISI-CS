 Eagles out of Eden

 London, Aug. 22 (Reuters): US rock group the Eagles will release Long Road Out of Eden, their first full studio album for 28 years, in October, Universal Music Group said today.

 The top-selling band, whose hits include Hotel California and Life in the Fast Lane, split in 1980 but reunited 14 years later and have toured intermittently since. Universal will distribute the new album outside North America, while in the US the record will be released through Wal-Mart stores, warehouse retail chain Sams Club and the bands website www.eaglesband.com. It will hit the shelves globally on October 29 and in the US one day later, Universal added. The first single from the album, How Long, has already had its video and radio premiere.

 The Eagles, comprising Glenn Frey, Don Henley, Joe Walsh and Timothy B. Schmit, last released a studio album of new songs The Long Road in 1979.

 Gilded garments for sale

 Riga, Latvia (Reuters): Latvias former President, Vaira Vike-Freiberga, is considering using eBay to auction off the wardrobe she wore in office in an attempt to recoup money she spent to look attractive and presidential. Freiberga told Latvian public radio in an interview this week that most of her salary during her years in office went on garments fit for a President in all situations. I literally spent all my salary to take care of myself ... to be able at any time to stand next to the Japanese Emperor, the British Queen, (Hollands) Queen Beatrix, any other lady, she said. I considered it my duty, representing Latvia, to present myself in an attractive and correct way. I might put them on eBay for auction to get the funds back, she said.

 Member up in flames

 Moscow (Reuters): A woman set fire to her ex-husbands penis as he sat naked watching television and drinking vodka, Moscow police said on Wednesday. Asked if the man would make a full recovery, a police spokeswoman said it was difficult to predict. The attack climaxed three years of acrimonious enforced co-habitation. The couple divorced three years ago but continued to share a small flat, something common in Russia where property costs are very high. It was monstrously painful, the wounded ex-husband told Tvoi Den paper.

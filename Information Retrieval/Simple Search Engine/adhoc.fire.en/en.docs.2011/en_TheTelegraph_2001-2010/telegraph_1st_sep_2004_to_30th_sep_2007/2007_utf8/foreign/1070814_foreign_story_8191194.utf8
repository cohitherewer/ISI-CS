 Heathrow protests

 Sipson (England), Aug. 13 (Reuters): Hundreds of climate demonstrators set up a tent camp next to Londons Heathrow airport today and threatened direct action at the worlds busiest air hub to protest against global warming.

 Police with batons were on alert at the field where the camp is based, within one kilometre of the airport complex. The campaigners plan a week of activities which will culminate on Sunday in 24 hours of direct action in a bid to force the government to halt the planned expansion of the airport.

 The expansion of the airport just runs completely in the face of everything we know about climate change, said activist Tom James at the camp. We are bringing totally unacceptable risks for future generations and people around the world.

 Organisers said direct action could involve a mass picnic in Sipson, a town slated for destruction if a third runway is built, and targeting of the offices of airport operator BAA. But they said the airports perimeter fence would not be breached.

 Banners urging a halt to airport expansion fluttered over the marquees and tents were being erected in the field as supplies of fruit and vegetables were brought in. Protesters ranged in age from pensioners to teenagers and children.

 Local resident Tom Creeden said the anti-expansion campaigners were fighting a losing battle: It is progress and it is needed. You have got to have a bigger airport and it might as well be here as anywhere else. Scientists say air transport contributes heavily to global warming, noting that the carbon dioxide and water vapour emitted at altitude are four times more potent than at sea level. Police said around 250 protesters had arrived at the camp just to the north of the airport and directly in line with the site of the proposed third runway.

 Tehran to end oil sale in dollars

 Tehran, March 30 (Reuters): Irans central bank governor said Tehran had plans to end the sale of its oil in dollars completely in a move to protect the Islamic Republic from mounting US pressure, state television reported today.

 Washington is leading efforts to isolate Iran over a nuclear programme which the West says is aimed at building atomic bombs despite Tehrans denials. Tensions with the West have increased with a row over Irans detention of British naval personnel.

 A big Iranian state bank has been targeted under UN sanctions passed this month, the second resolution since December. US officials suggested yesterday Irans dependence on fuel imports might be a target in future.

 Iran has plans to stop selling its oil in dollars completely, governor Ebrahim Sheibani was quoted as saying. The report did not say when the plan would come into effect.

 Iranian officials have previously said the worlds fourth largest oil exporter is seeking more oil revenues in currencies other than the dollar. A Iranian oil official told Reuters this month 60 per cent of Irans crude income was now in other units.

 Central bank and other officials have also said Iranian oil was still being sold based on the international dollar price even if payment was being requested in other currencies. Irans shift out of oil sales in dollars has accelerated a fall in the dollar portion of Irans foreign reserves.

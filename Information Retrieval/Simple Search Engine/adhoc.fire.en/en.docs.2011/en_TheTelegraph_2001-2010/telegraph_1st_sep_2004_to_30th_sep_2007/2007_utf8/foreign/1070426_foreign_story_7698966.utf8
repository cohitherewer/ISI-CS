 Toilet stuck on toddler

 London, April 25 (Reuters): British firefighters said they had come to a boys rescue after he got a toilet seat stuck on his head which he couldnt get off.

 The toddler, aged two-and-a-half, and his mother walked into a fire station in Braintree, Essex, on Tuesday saying the boy had put his head through a small trainer seat for the toilet and now could not remove it.

 We simply put some dish washing liquid on his head and ears and it slid off nice as pie, a firefighter said.

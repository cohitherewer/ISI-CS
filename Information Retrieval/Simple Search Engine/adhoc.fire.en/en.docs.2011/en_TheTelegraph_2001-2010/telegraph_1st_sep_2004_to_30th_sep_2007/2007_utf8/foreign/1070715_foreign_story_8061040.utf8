 Maoist anger

 Kathmandu, July 14 (Reuters): Nepals former Maoist rebels accused the government today of misleading the public by creating a fund for unpopular King Gyanendra after earlier announcing he would receive no public money.

 Unveiling his 2007/08 budget yesterday, finance minister Ram Sharan Mahat allocated no funds for the royal family. Yesterday, though, he said he had set aside $385,000 for allowances to the king under an account in the Prime Ministers office. The palace received $3.1 million in the previous tax year. This is an effort to revive reactionary forces by cheating the people, said senior Maoist leader Janardan Sharma, a member of the interim parliament. 

 We oppose this. Gyanendra was forced to abandon his absolute rule last year amid massive street protests.

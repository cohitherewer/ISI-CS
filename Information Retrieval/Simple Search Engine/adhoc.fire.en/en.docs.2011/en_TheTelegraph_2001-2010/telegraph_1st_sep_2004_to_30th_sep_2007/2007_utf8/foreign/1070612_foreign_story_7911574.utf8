 Conviction in London honour killing

 London, June 11 (Reuters): A Kurdish man was convicted in a London court today of murdering his 20-year-old daughter in a so-called honour killing after she left her husband and fell in love with another man.

 Banaz Mahmod was strangled with a shoelace in her home in London, her body was stuffed in a suitcase and taken some 190 km to Birmingham, where it was buried in the back garden of a house.

 Mahmod Mahmod, 52, ordered his own daughters murder with the help of his brother Ari Mahmod, 51. The killing itself was carried out by their associate Mohamad Hama, 30, and two other suspects who are still at large, police said.

 The court had been told that Banaz had been forced to marry an Iraqi Kurd when she was 17 but the relationship collapsed. She returned to live with her parents in 2005, later falling in love with Rahmat Suleimani. 

 Her family decided to kill her because they believed the relationship had brought dishonour on the family as Suleimani was an Iranian Kurd and not a strict Muslim.

 Banaz had contacted police a number of times before her death, saying her life was at risk, but no action was taken.

 An inquiry is under way into the police handling of the case.

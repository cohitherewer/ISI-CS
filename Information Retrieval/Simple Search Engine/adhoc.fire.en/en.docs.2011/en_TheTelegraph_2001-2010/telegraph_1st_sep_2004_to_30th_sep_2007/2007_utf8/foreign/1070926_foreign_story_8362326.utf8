 Kate worried about affair with William

 Kate with William

 London, Sept. 25 (PTI): Prince Williams girlfriend Kate Middleton is having a flutter over their love affair. 

 The reason: Kate fears that if she becomes a member of the British royal family in the future, she would not be able to match the expectations of snotty royal courtiers, the News of the World reported today. 

 She and Wills love each other dearly but Kate has just woken up to what the next few years could have in store. She is suddenly realising the enormity of what could lie ahead if she walks down the aisle with William. Its one thing having an on-off relationship with wills, its quite another becoming queen, one of Kates close friends was quoted as saying.

 Fine Print

 Sinead new tune

 Paris, May 22 (Reuters): Singer Sinead Connor, who once inflamed Catholic sensibilities when she ripped up a picture of Pope John Paul II, hopes a new batch of psalm-based songs will cast off the brash, shaven-headed image accorded her 20 years ago.

 Theology, her new album to be released next month, turns Old Testament psalms into songs that she delivers with the same powerful voice and signature sound that made her instantly recognisable after her major 1990 hit Nothing Compares 2 U.

 In the music industry a lot of people are feeding on you, on your creativity, I want to do something that nurtures me, she said in an interview.

 Vacation-wary workers

 New York (Reuters): Almost

 half of US workers did not take all of their

 vacation days last year, even though many

 reported being burned out by their jobs, according to a survey by Yahoo Hot Jobs. The online recruiter said 45 per cent of the 1,800 respondents did not use all of their days off for 2006, while 39 per cent said they were too exhausted to take a real vacation.

 Among the top reasons for not taking time

 off were having too much work (36 per cent),

 cost (34 per cent) and wanting to save vacation

 time for emergencies (32 per cent).

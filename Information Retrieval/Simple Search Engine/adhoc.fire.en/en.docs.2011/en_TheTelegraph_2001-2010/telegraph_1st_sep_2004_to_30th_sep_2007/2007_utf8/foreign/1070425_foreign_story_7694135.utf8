 Girl trouble? Look no further than Team Clinton

 STEVEN R. WEISMAN

 Wolfowitz

 Washington, April 24: Paul D. Wolfowitz, signalling anew that he will fight for his job as World Bank president, has enlisted a prominent lawyer who defended Bill Clinton against accusations of sexual misconduct to help convince the banks board that Wolfowitz has done nothing to justify being ousted.

 Robert S. Bennett, the lawyer selected by. Wolfowitz, said in an interview that before the banks board acted on charges of ethical lapses, he and Wolfowitz wanted more time to prepare a case showing that the bank president had acted properly on all matters that the board is investigating.

 I am very worried about the rush to judgment, Bennett said. I have reviewed the essential documents, and I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that Wolfowitz exercised good faith and that everything he did was in the best interests of the bank.

 It was unclear whether Wolfowitz intended to pay his legal fees himself or whether he would seek reimbursement from the bank. His latest sign of apparent determination to keep his job came as the furore over his record continued to spread.

 Bank officials said that after several days of canvassing hundreds of employees, about 25 vice-presidents of the bank were preparing to document that the overwhelming majority of the employees favour Wolfowitzs departure.

 The Financial Times reported yesterday that the independent agency within the bank that assesses the effectiveness of bank programmes concluded last week that swift changes in management were needed to restore its credibility.

 Wolfowitz has tangled with the board and staff members on various issues, especially his anti-corruption agenda, since he arrived in 2005 after serving as deputy secretary of defence and a chief architect of the Iraq war. But anger erupted this month over Wolfowitzs acknowledgment that he had played a much larger role than previously understood in the pay-and-promotion package given to Shaha Ali Riza, his companion, two years ago.Bennett, a longtime player in Washingtons legal and political scene, said in the interview that he had not completed his own review of the Wolfowitz documents but was convinced that, on the matter of Riza, he had acted in good faith and that whatever his shortcomings such as becoming involved directly in the matter of her salary were being seized upon by people with other agendas.

 I dont see any hanging offenses here, certainly no violations of law, Bennett said. People with their own private or personal agendas are using this incident to accomplish broader goals inconsistent with the mission of the bank.

 Bennett would not give details, but Wolfowitzs supporters maintain that European directors of the bank are using the episode to wrest control of the bank away from Wolfowitz and the Bush administration.

 Bennett was the lawyer last year for Judith Miller, the former reporter for The New York Times who was jailed for refusing to testify to a grand jury in the investigation of the leak of the identity of Valerie Plame as a CIA operative.

 He represented Clinton in the case brought by Paula Jones and helped settle the lawsuit.

 Airbrushed Keira in fame warning

 Screen magic

 London, Aug. 21: Airbrushed actress Keira Knightley has issued a warning to young people who want to be rich and famous.

 It frightens me when kids go: I want to be famous, she told the Radio Times. Why? Because you can get into a restaurant?

 You know what? If you book, you can get into a restaurant! I want to be rich and famous. Go and work on the stock market.

 Knightley, 22, also complained about the worlds obsession with her looks. Somebody goes: Gosh, youre pretty. Thanks. Ive got good genes! OK, Im on the cover of a magazine but somebody else does the hair, and the make-up, and airbrushes the f*** out of me its not me, its something other people have created.

 Knightley also said it was better to know nothing about stars private lives. I think it ruins the magic. Thats why I like watching films from 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago, because I dont want to know who (the actors) are, I dont want to know their life story.

 I want them to be characters on the screen. The magic is in the screen, not knowing whats behind it, because that ruins the magic. The actress, soon to appear in the film adaptation of Ian McEwans novel Atonement, also agreed with critics who said her acting in Bend It Like Beckham was bad.

 I completely agreed on every level, she admitted, adding: I didnt go to drama school, so I didnt get the training. It was difficult to get over that: What am I doing? Im pretending that I can do this and everybodys telling me I cant. But she went on to be Oscar-nominated for her performance in Pride and Prejudice.

 She said of her role in Atonement: Its the first film Ive done where Ive actually felt any confidence whatsoever.

 Atonement premieres at the Venice Film Festival later this month.

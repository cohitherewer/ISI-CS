 UK judge cleared of flashing on train

London, June 13: A senior judge has been cleared of exposing himself to a woman on a commuter train after a court decided there was insufficient evidence to back up her identification.

 The alleged victim, who has not been named, claimed Sir Stephen Richards flashed her on a train between Wimbledon and Waterloo on two occasions in October last year. After hearing the evidence, senior district judge Timothy Workman said that the case came down to his word against hers.

 While he praised the young womans evidence as clear, dignified and truthful, he said he was not convinced beyond reasonable doubt that Sir Stephen was her assailant due to the lack of supporting evidence. 

 And he criticised British Transport Police for failing to investigate the womans allegations quickly enough, meaning CCTV footage of the alleged incidents was lost.

 That evidence may well have supported her identification and, equally, may have exonerated Sir Stephen, he said. A grainy mobile phone photo taken by the woman during the second flashing incident was central to the prosecution case.

 Sir Stephen was not arrested until January, when he was spotted on a train by his alleged victim a City worker in her 20s who tipped off police. On the court steps after the verdict this afternoon, Sir Stephen, accompanied by his wife Lucy, expressed relief. 

 Throughout the trial I have put my trust in the legal process and I am delighted that it has enabled me to clear my name, he said.

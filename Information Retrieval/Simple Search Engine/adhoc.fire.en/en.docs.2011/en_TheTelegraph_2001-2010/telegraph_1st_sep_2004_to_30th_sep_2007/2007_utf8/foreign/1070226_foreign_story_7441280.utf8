 Bangla VIPs in graft net

 Dhaka, Feb. 25 (pti): Five influential persons suspected of corruption, including two former ministers of Bangladesh, were today arrested when they appeared before the anti-graft commission to submit their wealth statement. 

 Former works minister Mirza Abbas of Khaleda Zias Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and former aviation minister Mosharraf Hossain of Sheikh Hasina Wajeds Awami League had appeared before the anti-corruption commission, complying with its order to explain their wealth or face confiscation of assets. 

 The panel had served a 72-hour ultimatum, which ended this evening, to 50 suspected officials and ministers as part of a crackdown on corruption.

 Former power secretary Anh Akhter Hossain and Dhaka city ward commissioner Abdul Qaiyum of the BNP were also arrested by the joint forces, comprising army troops, elite anti-crime rapid action battalion and police.

 The development comes with the new panel chairman, retired army chief Lt Gen. Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury, and two other commissioners taking charge today.

 Anti-corruption officials said eight people, apparently on the run, did not respond to their order within the deadline that expired at 5 pm.

 If their properties were seized, it would be an unprecedented event in Bangladeshs history.

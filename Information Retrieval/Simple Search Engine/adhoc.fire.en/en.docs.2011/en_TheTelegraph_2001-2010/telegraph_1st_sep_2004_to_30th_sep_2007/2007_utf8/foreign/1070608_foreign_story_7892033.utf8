 Spy chiefs dig out dirt on Pak judge

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 Islamabad, June 7: The Pakistani intelligence establishment has struck back at suspended chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, accusing him of trying to usurp power and spying on colleagues.

 Months before the suspension, Chaudhry wanted President Pervez Musharraf to dissolve the Assemblies and make him the head of an interim government which would oversee elections in the country, the director general of military intelligence, General Nadeem Ijaz Ahmed, said today.

 In an affidavit filed in the supreme court, Ahmed accused Chaudhry of using spy agencies to keep tabs on judges several months before his ouster. 

 The general said the chief justice frequently interacted with the chiefs of the intelligence bureau and Musharrafs chief of staff, General Hamid Javed, to gather information on the judges.

 Ahmeds affidavit came a week after Chaudhry filed a petition in the supreme court, saying the President and the intelligence chiefs, including Ahmed, had pressured the judge to resign during a meeting on March 9, the day he was suspended. The supreme court is seeking to decide whether a panel inquiry into the charges against Chaudhry should continue, or the case should be transferred to the court.

 In the affidavit, Ahmed said Chaudhry used to task him on a regular basis to provide information on judges in Punjab so (that) he (Chaudhry) could build a database for his own reference. Intelligence bureau chief Ijaz Ahmed Shah and Javed also filed affidavits today.

 On Chaudhrys claim that he was forced to resign in March, Javed and Shah said the question of any one present at the meeting being discourteous to the chief justice did not arise at all. They said neither Musharraf nor anyone else was harsh with Chaudhry. 

 Asked by Chaudhrys lawyer Atezaz Ahesan why Musharraf and the ISI chief did not file their counter-affidavits, the government lawyer said the two held exalted offices and did not need to respond to Chaudhrys charges. Ahesan called the affidavits absurd, fictitious and a figment of their imagination.

 US bars Baez at army event 

 Baez: Twist of fate

 Washington, May 3 (Reuters): Rocker John Mellencamp and folk singer Joan Baez are both vehemently against the war in Iraq, but only one of them was permitted to perform for recovering wounded US soldiers last week.

 Mellencamp has sung many anti-war tunes but left politics out of his performance last week at Walter Reed Medical Center, a concert he put together after learning of the poor living conditions and bureaucratic delays soldiers experienced there.

 He invited Baez to join him, but she said the army told her she was not welcome. Four days before the concert, I was not approved by the army to take part, Baez said in a letter published in The Washington Post yesterday.

 Baez said she has always advocated non-violence and had refused during the Vietnam conflict to sing for the forces then because she felt it would have condoned a war that was ripping apart the country.

 I realise now that I might have contributed to a better welcome home for those soldiers fresh from Vietnam, Baez wrote. Maybe thats why I didnt hesitate to accept the invitation to sing for those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.

 I would assume that the bureaucracy in the Army is the toughest in the world, I have no idea what was going on there, Baez said during an interview with CNN.

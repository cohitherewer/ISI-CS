 Border JLo

 Los Angeles, Feb. 3 (AP): Jennifer Lopez will receive an award for her work as producer and star of a film examining the ongoing murders of hundreds of women in a Mexican border town, officials with Amnesty International said yesterday.

 Bordertown, Lopez plays an investigative journalist reporting on the serial killings of women in the border city of Juarez, Mexico. Directed by Gregory Nava, the film also stars Antonio Banderas and Martin Sheen.

 Halen tour

 Los Angeles (AP): The rumours were true. Van Halen will reunite with original singer David Lee Roth for a summer tour of North America. I am very excited to get back to the core of what made Van Halen, guitarist Eddie Van Halen said on the bands website announcing a 40-city tour. No specific dates have been named. It will be the first time that Roth performs live with the band since 1984, when he was replaced by Sammy Hagar. A brief reunion with Roth in 1996 resulted in two new songs but no tour.

 Kevin sorry

 New York (AP): Kevin Federline has something to say to those who are offended by an upcoming advertisement to air during the Super Bowl football championship featuring him as a fast-food worker: Hes really sorry. The commercial is completely intended for me, making fun of myself and my own situation, the aspiring rapper and estranged husband of Britney Spears said. It has nothing to do with anybody in the fast-food industry at all. So, you know, if weve offended anybody, Im really sorry about that.

 Los Angeles (AP): Actress Anne Heches husband has filed for divorce after five years of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences. In documents filed on Thursday, Coleman Laffoon asked the court to award him spousal support and joint custody of the couples 4-year-old son, Homer.

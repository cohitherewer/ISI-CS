 Refugee work leaves Jolie tearful

 Overwhelmed

 New York, March 12 (AP): Angelina Jolie says her work as a humanitarian ambassador for the UN at first left her tearful and overwhelmed.

 The first two years, I just cried constantly, the actress told Newsweek magazine. I couldnt really talk about the situation without being emotional. And I went through a period of just complete lack of hope.

 During her February visit to the Oure Cassoni camp on the border between Darfur and Chad, she came across a disturbed seven-year-old boy whose family had tied him to a pole to keep him from wandering away or hurting himself. The boy had spent 48 hours hiding in the bush after his village was bombed.

 I talked to him for like half an hour and just kind of looked at him for a long time before he touched me, Jolie told the magazine, and there was a little boy in there who was open to a kind sound.

 Jolie has visited camps in Africa, Pakistan and Cambodia as part of her work as a goodwill ambassador for the UNHCR. She said she travels unaccompanied on commercial flights and does not care about people who describe what she does as celebrity tourism.

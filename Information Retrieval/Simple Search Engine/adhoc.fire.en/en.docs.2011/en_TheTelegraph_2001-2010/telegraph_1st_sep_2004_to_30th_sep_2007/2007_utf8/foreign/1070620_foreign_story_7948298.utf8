 Protest over Nepal missing

 Kathmandu, June 19 (AP): About 200 people barricaded Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koiralas house today, demanding the government reveal the whereabouts of hundreds of people who allegedly disappeared during a decade-long civil conflict.

 We are demanding the government provide information on our family members who disappeared during the conflict, said protest leader Sharmila Tripathi, as fellow demonstrators chanted slogans and blocked entrances to the Prime Ministers official residence in Kathmandu.

 Tripathi said her husband disappeared about four years ago and she has no idea what has happened to him.

 Maoist rebels gave up their armed revolt last year and joined a peace process to end the decade-old insurgency.

 But at the height of the fighting from 2001 to early 2006, hundreds of people were detained by the army and many disappeared while they were being held. Emergency laws had allowed soldiers to pick up suspects and hold them without charge.

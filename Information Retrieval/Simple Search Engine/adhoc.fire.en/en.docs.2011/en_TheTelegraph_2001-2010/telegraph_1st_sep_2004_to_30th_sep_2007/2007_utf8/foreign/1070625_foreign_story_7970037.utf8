 Kate and William kiss and make up

 A Item again?

 London, June 24 (PTI): Prince William and Kate Middleton seem to be on a reconciliation path after their surprise split in April.

 They have started seeing each other again and shared a passionate kiss at a decadent army party where the 25-year-old prince second in line to the British throne could not take his eyes off the gorgeous Kate, before the two disappeared to his private quarters, media reported today.

 The party and other secret dates are tentative steps towards reconciliation, with sources close to both William and Kate saying he wants to give their relationship a second chance, the Mail on Sunday reported.

 The two had met at the university and their split surprised many as it was widely believed that they would announce their engagement any time.

 The pair have not been seen publicly together since their split. But, according to the tabloid, Kate visited William at his army barracks in Bovington on June 9. She joined him at a troop leaders party to celebrate the end of one of his army courses.

 Quoting witnesses, the report said they were happy and relaxed in each others company, and were spotted kissing on the dance floor at midnight. They then left the party early to go back to Williams barracks. William invited Kate down for the party, a source said.

 There were about 150 people and it was a Moulin Rouge-themed bash called Freakin Naughty. Although there was plenty of flesh on show, William and Kate were more modestly dressed, the source said.

 Kate will attend the Princess Diana memorial concert at Wembley stadium on July 1, the paper said.

 While Kate is enjoying his company, she has made it clear she will not become involved with William again unless he makes a firm commitment to a future together.

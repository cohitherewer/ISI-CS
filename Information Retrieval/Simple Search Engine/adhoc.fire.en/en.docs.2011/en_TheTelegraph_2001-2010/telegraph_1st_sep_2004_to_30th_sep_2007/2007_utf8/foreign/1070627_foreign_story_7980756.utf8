 Sheffield, June 26 (Reuters): Hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes in northern England today as officials warned a dam could collapse following severe flooding that has killed three people.

 A 68-year-old man and a teenager died in Sheffield and another man, in his 20s, was killed in Hull as torrential rain brought chaos to much of England and Wales.

 Police and local authority officials said they had moved about 250 people from their homes near Rotherham in South Yorkshire after cracks appeared in the Ulley Dam.

 For the people in the area concerned, those who need to be moved have been, Chief Superintendent Matthew Jukes, the police commander for Rotherham, told BBC radio. He said it was difficult to tell whether the wall would collapse.

 It does have some cracks in it and there is just a steady flow of water at the moment which were quite able to deal with in terms of the emergency response, he said.

 Structural engineers were working to shore up the dam and pump out water from a reservoir covering more than 30 acres four miles south of the town.

 The water, if it escapes, will run into a valley area but would fairly rapidly spread out, chief executive of Rotherham council Mike Cuff told BBC Radio.

 It would reach the M1 motorway and it would then spread out. If the dam should burst we would be talking in terms of maybe 15 minutes or so before water would reach residential areas. 

 The M1 highway was closed in South Yorkshire because of the flooding.

 People in the Sheffield area were advised not to travel unless they had to. Police said the situation was exceptional and council leaders said the unprecedented rainfall had caused millions of pounds of damage.

 They also said there were around 1,400 people were being looked after in care centres after being evacuated from their flooded homes. 

 Yesterday a man died after in Hull after becoming trapped clearing a flooded drain. He had gone to help his grandfather but slipped and became pinned back by a torrent of water. Police in South Yorkshire said Ryan Parry, 14, had died after being swept away by the Sheaf river in Sheffield.

 A 68-year-old man also died when he was swept away in a torrent trying to cross a flooded Sheffield street.

 The environment agency has issued severe flood warnings of imminent danger to life and property for more than 20 areas, mainly in the Humberside, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire and Derbyshire districts. Numerous lesser flood warnings were also in place across the country.

 Prime Minister Tony Blair said he sympathised with those affected and that it was important to prevent any more deaths. This has been an extraordinary and very serious event for us, he said. 

 Our flood defences are holding but this is a difficult situation and its not the first time over the past few years we have been subject to quite unusual and extraordinary weather variations.

 Rowling writing kids novel amp; one not for kids

 Washington, July 27 (AFP): Author J.K. Rowling, who a week ago published the final Harry Potter book, said in an interview that she is already back at work.

 The British author says she is sad the Harry Potter series has ended, but will not stop writing. Im sort of writing two things at the moment, she told the USA Today newspaper. One is for children and the other is not for children.

 The weird thing is that this is exactly the way I started writing Harry. I was writing two things simultaneously for a year before Harry took over. So one will oust the other in due course, and Ill know thats my next thing, she told the daily. Rowling admitted to being angered that the last of the seven-novel series had been posted on a website prior to the official release.

 I was angry, she told USA Today, for her young fans, the 10-11-year-olds who really wanted not to know how the book ended, until they had a chance to read it.

 However, she was heartened that rumoured endings included the death of the boy-wizard. I was very proud that people thought Harrys death was a genuine possibility. I wanted the reader to feel that anyone might die, as in life, she said. The books themselves will live on, the 41-year-old billionaire said. Do I think theyll last? Honestly, yes.

 In 50 years time, if people are still reading them, they deserve to be read, and if theyre not, then thats OK.

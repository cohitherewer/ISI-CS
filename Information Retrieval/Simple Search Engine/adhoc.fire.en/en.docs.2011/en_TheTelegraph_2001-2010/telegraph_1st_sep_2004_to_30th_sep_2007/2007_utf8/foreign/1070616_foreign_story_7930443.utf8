 Barot terror cell

 London, June 15 (Reuters): Seven Britons linked to a plot to blow up US financial institutions, including the New York Stock Exchange, and stage a series of attacks in Britain were jailed for a total of 136 years by a London court today.

 Prosecutors said the men were part of a group headed by senior al Qaida operative Dhiren Barot and described as one of the most dangerous and ambitious terrorist cells ever to operate in this country. Barot is currently serving a life term after admitting last year that he had planned bomb attacks in Britain and the US.

 Six of the men, Mohammed Naveed Bhatti, Junade Feroze, Zia Ul Haq, Abdul Aziz Jalil, Nadeem Tarmohamed and Omar Abdur Rehman pleaded guilty to conspiring with Barot to cause explosions between 2001 and 2004. 

 The seventh, Qaisar Shaffi, was found guilty on Wednesday. Peter Clarke, head of Londons Counter Terrorism Command, said the men were vital to the plots.

 They were the planning team and were needed by Barot to contribute expertise in areas that he was lacking, he said. They were the trusted few who researched, carried out reconnaissance and supported Barot. Last month, the high court cut Barots jail term from 40 to 30 years.

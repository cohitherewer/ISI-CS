 Dhaka, May 30 (Reuters): A Bangladesh court has ruled that several political and industry leaders can be held in custody for interrogation, officials said today, as part of the army-led governments crackdown on corruption.

 Awami League party general secretary Abdul Jalil, former junior home affairs minister Lutfuzzaman Babar and top businessman M.A. Hashem were ordered held for four days, a court registrar of the court said.

 Former health minister Sheikh (Fazlul Karim) Selim and Abdul Awal Mintoo, former president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry, were ordered held for three and four days respectively.

 Selim, a cousin of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, was in her cabinet between 1996 to 2001. Mintoo, an ardent supporter of Hasinas rival Begum Khaleda Zia, was president of the national chamber in 2003-05.

 The court also sent to jail on 30-day detention orders retired air vice-marshal Altaf Hossain Chowdhury, who was a former home minister in the government of ex-Prime Minister Khaleda, and two other junior ministers, including one from Hasinas government.

 The interim government says it will hold an election, originally slated for January this year, only after reforming the countrys political system and purging corruption. It has vowed to hold a new vote before the end of 2008.

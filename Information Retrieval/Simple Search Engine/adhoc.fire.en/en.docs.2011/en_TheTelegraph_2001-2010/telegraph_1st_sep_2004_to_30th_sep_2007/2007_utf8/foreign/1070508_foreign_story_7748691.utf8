 Back, Hasina cries: No one can stop me

 Dhaka, May 7 (Reuters): Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina landed in Dhaka airport today and declared: No one can stop me.

 Senior leaders of her Awami League greeted her after she arrived on an Etihad Airways flight, but there was no mass reception at the capitals airport because of restrictions imposed under a state of emergency.

 Hasina landed in Dhaka today after the military-backed interim government lifted a brief ban on her returning home.

 Witnesses said hundreds of her followers stood outside the airport gate, chanting and waving banners to welcome her. Hasina was originally due to return home on April 19 after a holiday in the US, where her son and daughter live, but she was stranded in London after the interim government ordered airlines and immigration to block her return.

 I am happy to be able to come back, after a period of uncertainties, Hasina told reporters.This is my country, they cannot keep me from coming back, no one can stop me.

 Bangladesh has been under a state of emergency since January 11 and parliamentary elections planned for Jan. 22 were cancelled by the interim government headed by former central bank governor Fakhruddin Ahmed.

 Political activities were banned and security forces have detained more than 160 senior political figures in an anti-graft hunt since then, including Tarique Rahman, elder son of the most recent prime minister, Begum Khaleda Zia. Fakhruddin yesterday reaffirmed plans to hold elections before the end of next year and pledged freedom for the media to ensure a free flow of information.

 Hasina could be a major player in that vote, but she gave no hint of her plans today. I have just returned ... will talk to my party leaders and then take decisions about politics and other things, Hasina said.Let me rest a bit.

 Hasina said before leaving London she did not expect the interim government to do anything to her that could provoke protests or political consequences. 

 She faces charges of extortion and abetting deaths during street fighting between activists of the Awami League and its rivals, Khaleda Zias Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Hasina denied the charges.

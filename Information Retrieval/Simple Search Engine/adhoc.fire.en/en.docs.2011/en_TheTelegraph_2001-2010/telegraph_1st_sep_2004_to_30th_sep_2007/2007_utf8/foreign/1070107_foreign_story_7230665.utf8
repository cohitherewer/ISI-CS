 Instant noodles founder dead

 Ando: Innovative

 Tokyo, Jan. 6 (AP): Momofuku Ando, the Japanese inventor of instant noodles, has died, according to Nissin Food Products Co, the company he founded. He was 96.

 Ando died of a heart attack yesterday, Nissin said in a statement posted today on its website (www.nissinfoods.co.jp).

 He was born in Taiwan in 1910, when the island was under Japanese colonial rule. He moved to Japan in 1933, according to Japans daily Mainichi newspaper.

 Faced with food shortages in post World War II Japan, Ando developed the idea that a quality, convenient noodle product would help feed the masses. He founded Nissin in 1948.

 In 1958, Chicken Ramen, the first instant noodle product, was introduced after many trials. Following its success, the company continued to add innovative products, including Cup Noodle in 1971.

 The Momofuku Ando Instant Ramen Museum opened in 1999 in Ikeda City in western Japan commemorating his inventions. The companys products even went into space when Japanese astronaut Soichi Noguchi took instant noodles in a pouch called Space Ram on his 2005 mission on board the US space shuttle Discovery.

 Ando was a keen promoter of developing food for space travel, Nissin said.

 Ando gave a 30-minute speech at the companys New Year ceremony and enjoyed Chicken Ramen for lunch with Nissin employees on Thursday before falling ill, Japans largest daily Yomiuri said.

 Ando is survived by his wife Masako, two sons and a daughter.

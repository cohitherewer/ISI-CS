 Beyonce back-up

 Houston, Jan. 8 (AP): A nationwide talent search for dancers fleet-footed enough to back up Beyonce Knowles came to the pop divas hometown as hundreds turned out to audition for 40 open slots.

 The would-be performers took turns on Saturday moving through choreographed routines to such Beyonce hits as Deja Vu, while cameras recorded their footwork and choreographer Frank Gaston studied their style.

 Houston was the third location in the cross-country search, following auditions in Atlanta and Los Angeles. After two more stops, in New York and Chicago, Gaston and Beyonce will review the tapes.. The finalists get a trip to either New York or Los Angeles, where the numbers will be pared to the final 40.

 Hitler wine

 London, Feb. 18: A rare bottle of Nazi wine with a portrait of Adolf Hitler on the label has been sold at auction for 3,995, reports The Sunday Telegraph. The bottle was from a collection understood to have been given to Hitlers officers during World War II.

 The Fhrerwein dates back to 1943 and has a picture of the dictator on the label dressed in a suit. Because it is so old it is undrinkable. The lot was expected to fetch only 500-800 when it went under the hammer in Plymouth. The auction ended with the final bid at 3,400 but the total is higher after the buyers premium is added. The bid came from an unnamed collector.

 Sex stop

Police said the female driver and her male passenger gave in to their passions without pulling over to the side of the road. A patrolman gave the woman a ticket for holding up traffic. 

 Bust dose

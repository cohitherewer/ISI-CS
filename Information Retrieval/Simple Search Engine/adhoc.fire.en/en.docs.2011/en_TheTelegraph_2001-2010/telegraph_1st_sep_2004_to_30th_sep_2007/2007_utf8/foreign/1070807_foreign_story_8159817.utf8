 Mia Farrow offers freedom to save rebel

 RICHARD HOLT

 Bold move

 London,

 Aug. 6: Mia Farrow has offered to give up her own freedom in exchange for that of a respected Darfur rebel figure who has been held under virtual arrest for more than a year.

 The US actress made the offer in a letter to Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the Sudanese President. 

 Suleiman Jamous, a humanitarian worker for the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA), has been confined to a UN hospital in Kordofan, the region neighbouring Darfur, for more than 13 months. He is in need of medical assistance which cannot be performed at that hospital. 

 Khartoum said if he left the hospital he would be arrested, but has said it is open to talks on his release. 

 Before his seizure, Jamous played a crucial role in bringing the SLA to the negotiating table and in seeking reconciliation between its divided rival factions, Farrow said in her letter. 

 I am, therefore, offering to take Jamouss place, to exchange my freedom for his in the knowledge of his importance to the civilians of Darfur and in the conviction that he will apply his energies toward creating the just and lasting peace that the Sudanese people deserve and hope for. Farrow, who was once married to Frank Sinatra and later had children with Woody Allen, is a goodwill ambassador to Unicef.

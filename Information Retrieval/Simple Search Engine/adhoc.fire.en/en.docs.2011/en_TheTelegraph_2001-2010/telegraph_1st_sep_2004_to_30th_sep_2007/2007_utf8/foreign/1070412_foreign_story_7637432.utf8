 Anna babys father proven

 Anna Nicole Smith, Larry Birkhead 

 Nassau (Bahamas), April 11 (AP): DNA tests proved it: Larry Birkhead is the father of Anna Nicole Smiths million-dollar baby.

 I told you so! the Playboy playmates former boyfriend said yesterday after emerging from a closed court hearing. He added: My babys going to be coming home pretty soon. 

 Birkhead then hugged his rival, Howard K. Stern, Smiths lawyer-turned-companion who has been caring for baby Dannielynn since Smiths sudden death in February.

 Stern said he wouldnt fight for custody, but a lawyer for Smiths mother, Virgie Arthur, indicated she might. The judge scheduled another hearing for Friday in the pink colonial courthouse to discuss who will raise the girl, who could inherit hundreds of millions of dollars.

 Stern said he loved the baby despite the DNA results and would support Birkhead.

 Im obviously very disappointed, but my feelings for Dannielynn have not changed, he said, adding of Birkhead: Im going to do whatever I can to make sure he gets sole custody. Birkhead, a California photographer, had been fighting for custody of Dannielynn even before Smiths death. 

 Nothings been determined except parentage and Im the father, Birkhead said. 

 A crowd of about 250 people, many of them tourists, cheered from behind police barricades when Birkhead announced the DNA test results. The courts DNA expert, Dr Michael Baird, confirmed it. Essentially, hes the biological father, Baird said. Smith gave birth to Dannielynn in September. 

 The baby, whose full name is Dannielynn Hope Marshall Stern, could inherit millions from the estate of Smiths late husband, J. Howard Marshall II.

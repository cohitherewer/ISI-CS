 Pope backs celibacy for priests

 Vatican City, March 13 (AP): Pope Benedict today reiterated the churchs ban on Communion for divorced Catholics who remarry and left it up to bishops whether Catholic politicians should receive Communion if they support abortion rights or gay marriage.

 In a 131-page document, the Pope also upheld the Vaticans requirement for celibacy for priests in the Latin rite Church. Priestly celibacy lived with maturity, joy and dedication is an immense blessing for the church and for society itself, the Pope wrote.

 The document embraced recommendations made by bishops from around the world at a 2005 meeting at the Vatican that rejected any change in the celibacy requirement.

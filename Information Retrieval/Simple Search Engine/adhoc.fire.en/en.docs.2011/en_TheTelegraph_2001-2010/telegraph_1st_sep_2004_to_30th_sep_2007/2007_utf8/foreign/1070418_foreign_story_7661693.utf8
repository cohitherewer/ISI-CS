The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Suspect tag off gun-lover student

 April 17: Once again the Internet became the front line for information, with news of the horrific killings at Virginia Tech University filtering through via Facebook the major social networking tool that is used by millions of American students.

 The first major incident on the Internet was the false accusation of a Virginia Tech student, Wayne Chiang, being the shooter. 

 Chiang, a renowned gun enthusiast who had extensively posted photos of himself posing with a wide array of guns, was initially thought by other students to be the shooter guilty of yesterdays massacre. 

 This rumour was quickly quashed by investigating authorities when they revealed that the sole shooter a South Korean had committed suicide at the scene of the shootings. 

 But the damage had been done. Chiang received over 18,000 hits on his Facebook profile including a number of death threats. 

 Chiang is known to be alive and well, although nobody is aware of his location, which is not being disclosed on the grounds of safety.

 With confusion reigning in the media, the first tentative lists of those who had died were compiled by friends on Facebook message boards. 

 The compilation, however, was not without controversies several people have been mistakenly identified as having died in the massacre.

 Indeed, Facebook has become the focal point for grief on the Internet, with freshman Emily Hilscher, the first victim of the gunman, having a large memorial dedicated to her by friends. 

 Witness testimonies and anecdotes flooded online communities, telling sad tales such as that of Kyle Dunn, a high school student at a nearby school.

 My dad is Officer Carl A. Dunn, a member of the Blacksburg police department in Virginia. He was one of the responding swat officers that was first on the scene and when he got there he said he could still hear shots being fired off at about 8.04 am. His team was ordered to breach and clear Norris Hall and when he got inside all hell broke out... but only four shots were fired and three out of four hit the suspect and was pronounced dead on the scene.

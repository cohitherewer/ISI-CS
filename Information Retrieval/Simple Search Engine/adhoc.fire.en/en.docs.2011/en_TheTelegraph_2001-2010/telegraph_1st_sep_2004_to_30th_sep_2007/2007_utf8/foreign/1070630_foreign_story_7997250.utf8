The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Bomb baptism for Brown

 AMIT ROY AND AGENCIES

 London, June 30: The Mercedes bomb has thrown up the most serious and sustained threat to Britains security, the two-day-old administration of Prime Minister Gordon Brown said today.

 The assessment was made public after Brown, dealing with his first emergency two days after succeeding Tony Blair, convened the top security committee, Cobra.

 We are currently facing the most serious and sustained threat to our security from international terrorism, Jacqui Smith, Browns new interior minister, said after the meeting.

 A large area of central London around the scene remained sealed off, hours after the bomb was found.

 Television pictures showed a gas canister after it had been removed from the car. It was green and labelled PATIO GAS, which is readily available at hardware stores in Britain. The bomb was rigged to detonate with a mobile-phone-triggered device.

 Deputy assistant commissioner Peter Clarke, head of Scotland Yards counter-terrorism command, said: It is obvious that if the device had detonated, there could have been significant injury or loss of life. The threat from terrorism is real and is here.

 The threat of the explosion, the search for forensic clues and fears there might be other car bombs meant central London was an area to avoid today, which was bad news for Indians who now constitute the second biggest group of tourists after the Americans.

 Part of Park Lane was closed to traffic after reports of a suspicious vehicle. The Haymarket was closed between Pall Mall and Piccadilly Circus as were Coventry Street, Whitcomb Street, Shaftesbury Avenue and Cambridge Circus; and 16 bus lines were diverted in the area with delays of more than 45 minutes.

 Gridlocks set in around Trafalgar Square and Charing Cross Road. The position where the Mercedes was abandoned bang opposite the Tiger Tiger nightclub and not far from such celebrity haunts as Chinawhite brought to mind the notorious Gas Limos Project hatched by Dhiren Barot, the Hindu boy who became an Islamic militant, now serving 40 years in prison.

 After the emergency meeting, Brown said: The first duty of the government is the security of the people and as the police and security services have said on so many occasions, we face a serious and continuous threat to our country. 

 But this incident does recall the need for us to be vigilant at all times and the public to be alert to any potential incidents. I will stress to the cabinet that the vigilance must be maintained over the next few days.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who has invited Brown to India, may find the new British leader more than attentive when the former brings up the question of terrorism.

 Militants ousted with army help, says Pervez

 Islamabad, April 12 (AP): Tribesmen have killed about 300 foreign militants during a week-long offensive in South Waziristan, President Pervez Musharraf said today, acknowledging for the first time that they received military support.

 The fighting, that began last month in the lawless tribal region near the Afghan border, has targeted mainly Uzbek militants with links to al Qaida who have sheltered there since escaping the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in late 2001. The people of South Waziristan now have risen against the foreigners. They have killed about 300 of them, and they got support from the Pakistan army. They asked for support, Musharraf said in a speech at a military conference in Islamabad.

 We are demanding the same in North Waziristan, and there are indications the same may happen there also, he said. The toll given by Musharraf is far higher than figures given by Pakistani army officials to journalists on a trip to South Waziristan yesterday. 

 They said that between 150 and 230 militants had died in the fighting and about 40 tribesmen.

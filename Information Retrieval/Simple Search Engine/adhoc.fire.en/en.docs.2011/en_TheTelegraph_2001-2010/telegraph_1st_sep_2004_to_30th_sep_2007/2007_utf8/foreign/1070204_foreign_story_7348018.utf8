 Putin consults dog for advice

 Moscow, Feb. 3: The Russian President, asked how he dealt with the times when he felt sad and low, disclosed that he sought the counsel of his labrador, Koni.

 I try to consult my dog Koni and she gives me good advice, Vladimir Putin said.

 Koni has figured large in the Presidents life in recent years, not just as a source of solace but also as a political weapon. During strained talks with Angela Merkel last month, Koni padded into the room and made unerringly for the German chancellor, who recoiled in apparent terror. Meeting with President George W Bush, Putin pointed to Koni saying: Bigger, tougher, stronger, faster, meaner than Barney the US Presidents dog.

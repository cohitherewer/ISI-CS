 Pervez admits sacking error

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 New Delhi, March 19: Pakistans President Pervez Musharraf has now admitted that the sacking of Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary may have been a mistake. 

 Even as six subordinate court judges in Sindh and one in Punjab have reportedly sent in their resignations in favour of Justice Chaudhary, the government has decided to shun the path of confrontation with the agitating lawyers. 

 This still begs the question: Why was Justice Chaudhary sacked? In the run up to his removal as chief justice of Pakistan, a letter was published in a magazine from a Lahore advocate and TV personality Naeem Bokhari. 

 He accused the chief justice of appropriating Mercedes Benz cars for his personal use as well as misusing government aircraft for personal visits, splurging public funds on refurbishing his chamber and residence, pushing the appointment of his son in the government despite his securing only 16 marks out of 100 in the Civil Services Examination, giving one verbal order in open court and then changing the verdict in the written order and rude behaviour. 

 In short, he suffered from all the foibles of South Asias ruling elite. Bokhari ended his chargesheet saying: My Lord, we all live in the womb of time and are judged, both by the present and by history. The judgment about you, being rendered in the present, is adverse in the extreme. 

 Bokharis letter was seen by many as inspired by the powers that be and, therefore, a portent of the imminent removal of Justice Chaudhary. This is what happened. 

 President Musharraf has now been forced to tell a delegation of the kings party, Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid-e-Azam) that Naeem Bokharis charge-sheet had nothing to do with the presidential reference to the Supreme Judicial Council that, in fact, it was based on complaints by a Peshawar high court judge.

 According to Naeem Bokharis letter the only misdemeanour of the chief justice in Peshawar was to demand that he be presented a guard of honour. But clearly this did not warrant his removal. Musharraf told the PML (Q) delegation that he had presented documentary evidence to the chief justice of the Peshawar judges complaint but got no satisfactory explanation. 

 Since the charges levied against him in the presidential reference are not known, there is speculation about the real reasons why the Pakistan establishment decided to punish him.

 There are two events which could be at the core of the action against the chief justice. Both emanate from his judicial activism. One relates to the case of disappearing persons. 

 By now it is well-known that the intelligence agencies of Pakistan have been picking up people and then feigning ignorance about their disappearance. 

 Many of these individuals are perhaps wanted by the US. Some others are perhaps suspected of fomenting trouble in Baluchistan.

 The other reason for Justice Chaudharys removal could be the suo moto action the supreme court initiated against what seemed like dubious attempts at privatisation of the Pakistan Steel Mills and Pakistan telecommunications.

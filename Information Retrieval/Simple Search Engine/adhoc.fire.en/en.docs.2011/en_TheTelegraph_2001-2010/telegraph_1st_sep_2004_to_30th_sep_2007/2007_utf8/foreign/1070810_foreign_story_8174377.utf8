 Big Ben to lose bongs

 London, Aug. 9 (Reuters): The familiar bongs of Londons renowned Big Ben will be silenced over the next month for maintenance work, although the clock that stands above Britains Houses of Parliament will continue to tell the time.

 It will be the first time that both the bells hourly and quarter-hourly strikes will be suspended since 1956, the House of Commons said.

 The bongs, which ring out every quarter of an hour from the bell at the Palace of Westminster, will stop at 0700 GMT on Saturday and will not resume for four to six weeks. Bearings that form part of the bells operating mechanism will be replaced, probably for the first time since the bell first rang out in 1859, the statement said.

 Foxx role

 Los Angeles, Aug. 18 (AP): Jamie Foxx will play a brilliant but mentally troubled musician in a movie based on the true-life friendship between Skid Row prodigy Nathaniel Anthony Ayers and Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez.

 The DreamWorks SKG movie, directed by Joe Wright, is scheduled to begin filming in January. Erin Brockovich writer Susannah Grant has completed the screenplay, said Gary Foster, who is producing the movie with Russ Krasnoff. Foxx won the best actor Oscar in 2005 for his portrayal of musician Ray Charles in Ray.

 Bank trap

 Laguna Woods, California (AP): A 73-year-old woman became trapped in a bank when employees accidentally locked her in the building while she was looking over the contents of a safe deposit box. Marian Prescher, who has diabetes, apparently passed out during the ordeal because she had not taken her medication with her. A cleaning person discovered her six hours later. Prescher visited the Bank of America branch on Wednesday and was given use of a privacy room to examine her valuables. 

 Top credit

 Providence, Rhode Island (AP): A malfunctioning video lottery terminal gave gamblers credit for twice as much money as they had inserted, erroneously paying out $450,115 (euro334,558) during two months at a Rhode Island casino. The machine was removed on July 15 from the Twin River casino after the problem was discovered.

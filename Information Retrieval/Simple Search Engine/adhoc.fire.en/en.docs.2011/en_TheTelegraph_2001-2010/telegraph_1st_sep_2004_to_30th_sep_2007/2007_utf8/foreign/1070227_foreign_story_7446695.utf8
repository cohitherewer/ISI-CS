 No brake on N-plans: Iran

 London, Feb. 26 (Reuters): Iran dug in its heels over its nuclear programme today ahead of a meeting of western powers to discuss tightening UN sanctions on Tehran amid western fears it aims to produce nuclear weapons.

 President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad declared Iran had no brake and no reverse gear, prompting US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice to say Tehran needed a stop button for its programme.

 US vice-president Dick Cheney said all options were on the table following Irans refusal to heed a UN deadline for halting uranium enrichment. An Iranian deputy foreign minister responded by saying Iran was prepared even for war.

 Russias foreign minister Sergei Lavrov weighed in, saying he was worried by talk of possible military strikes against Iran and noted it had become more frequent. In Tehran, an Iranian government spokesman told a news conference that the Wests demand that Iran suspend enrichment was illegal and illogical.

 Suspending uranium enrichment as a precondition for talks is an illegal and illogical demand and it is in contradiction with the Iranian nations dignity, government spokesman Gholamhossein Elham told a weekly news conference.

 We are ready to preserve our legal rights through talks.

 Iran insists it is entitled to nuclear power to generate electricity and wants to negotiate with the Europeans and Washington without giving up its right to enrich uranium.

 The West suspects Tehran is trying to build an atomic arsenal and says the fact that it kept its nuclear programme secret for 18 years until 2002 and its lack of cooperation with UN inspectors show ill intent.

 Rising tensions over Iran, the worlds fourth largest oil exporter, affected market sentiment.

 The dollar hit a two-month low against the euro of $1.3198 and a seven-week trough versus a basket of currencies , partly weighed by oil prices which neared a fresh 2007 high above $61 a barrel on mounting tension on Iran.

 Iran has ignored deadline: UN

 Vienna, Feb. 22 (Reuters): The UNs nuclear watchdog said today that Iran had failed to meet a February 21 deadline to suspend enrichment of uranium, exposing Tehran to possible new sanctions over concerns it hopes to produce an atomic bomb.

 The International Atomic Energy Agency said in a report that Iran had installed two cascades, or networks, of 164 centrifuges in its underground Natanz enrichment plant with another two cascades close to completion.

 This amounted to an effort to escalate research-level enrichment of nuclear fuel into industrial scale production.

 Iran has not suspended its enrichment-related activities, said the confidential IAEA report.

 By ignoring the deadline, Tehran reaffirmed its rejection of a mid-2006 offer by six world powers of talks on trade benefits provided it halted enrichment, a process that can yield nuclear power plant fuel or bombs.

 The UN Security Council imposed sanctions on Iran in a December 23 resolution that banned transfers of atomic technology and know-how to Iran. The resolution authorises the council to take further measures if Iran flouted the deadline.

 The Islamic republic, which says its nuclear fuel programme is designed only to produce electricity, remained defiant.

 Regarding the suspension mentioned in the report, because such a demand has no legal basis and is against international treaties, naturally, it could not be accepted by Iran, Mohammad Saeedi, deputy head of Irans Atomic Energy Organisation, said in Tehran. 

 UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon said he was deeply concerned. I urge again that the Iranian government should fully comply with the demands as soon as possible.

 The report said Iranian workers lowered into the Natanz plant an 8.7-tonne container of uranium hexafluoride gas (UF-6) to prepare to feed centrifuges, which purify the material into power plant fuel or, if refined to high levels, for bombs. 

 Iran had told the IAEA it intended to have 3,000 centrifuges, divided into 18 cascades, installed and brought gradually into operation by May.

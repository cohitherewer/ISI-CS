 Maoists for special debate on monarchy

 REUTERS AND OUR BUREAU

 Kathmandu, Sept. 20: The Maoists plan to call a special session of parliament before November elections to debate the abolition of the monarchy, a spokesman said yesterday as the former rebels try to restore their political credentials.

 The Maoists quit the coalition government on Tuesday saying a free and fair vote was impossible until the monarchy was abolished. 

 The former rebels said they would disrupt the poll campaign with street protests, raising fears for a fragile peace process. 

 We will call a meeting of the parliament to discuss our demand (for a debate), Maoist spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara said.

 The decision to quit the government was in part dictated by fear among the Maoist leaders that their support was eroding while in power and hope that delaying the poll could help them rebuild popularity among voters, analysts said.

 The Maoists are likely to lose any parliamentary vote on the monarchy, as other mainstream parties said they would wait until the November 22 Constituent Assembly polls before abolishing it.

 But by calling the vote, Maoist leaders are showing they have not totally rejected mainstream politics. 

 Kapilvastu riot toll

 The death toll in the sectarian violence in Kapilvastu district of southern Nepal reached 31 after fresh clashes today claimed five more lives. 

 The violence was sparked off on Sunday after the murder of anti-Maoist vigilante group chief Mohit Khan in Bishanpur. His death triggered violent riots in Kapilvastu. As a result, Muslim leaders today urged Prime Minister Koirala to provide security for their community.

 Obama: Hillary India memo dumb mistake

 Unnecessary

 Newton (Iowa), June 19 (AP): Democratic presidential contender Barack Obama said his campaign made a dumb mistake when it circulated a memo criticising rival Hillary Rodham Clintons financial ties to India.

 In an interview, Obama yesterday disavowed the memo which carried the headline Hillary Clinton (D-Punjab), a play on the standard reference to a candidates party and constituency.

 It also referred to former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clintons investments in India; her fundraising among Indian-Americans; and the former Presidents $300,000 (euro223,800) inspeech fees from Cisco, a company that has moved US jobs to India.

 It was a dumb mistake on our campaigns part and I made it clear to my staff in no uncertain terms that it was a mistake, Obama said in a brief interview in which he referred to the memo as unnecessarily caustic.

 Last Thursday, Obamas campaign sent the memo to reporters, demanding that it not be attributed to their campaign. The Clinton campaign obtained the document and sent it to journalists. Since then, it has created a furore in the Indian-American community and raised questions about Obamas claims that he is above attack politics.

 It is not reflective of the long-standing relationship I have had with the Indian-American community, Obama said. The issue of outsourcing is a genuine and important issue but to refer to one particular country was, I think, an error and I let all of us know that weve got to be more careful about how we communicate, he said.

 In a statement on his website (www.barackobama.com), Obama said he was not aware of the contents of the memo before it was distributed. The Illinois senator said he was responsible for the mistake and the campaign had taken appropriate action to prevent errors like this from happening in the future.

 Obama was campaigning in Iowa yesterday. Stopping in an Iowa town rocked by the closure of a Maytag plant, he called for new efforts to create jobs and end tax subsidies for companies that shift jobs overseas.

 Obama focused on economic issues during his visit to Newton, a town of about 15,000 dealing with the loss of nearly 2,000 jobs due to the closure of a Maytag plant and offices. The appliance manufacturer based in Newton was bought last year by rival Whirlpool.

 While its not possible to stop globalisation in its tracks, what we can do is make sure we have a government thats looking out for our workers.

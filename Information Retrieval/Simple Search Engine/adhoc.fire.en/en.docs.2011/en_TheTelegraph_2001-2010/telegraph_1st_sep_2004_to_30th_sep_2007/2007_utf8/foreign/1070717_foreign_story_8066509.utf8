The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Maoists registered as party

 Kathmandu, July 16 (Reuters): Nepals former Maoist rebels have been formally registered as a political party to contest November elections in the Himalayan country, the election commission said today.

 The Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) has been allocated the hammer and sickle symbol to fight the November 22 elections that will elect a Constituent Assembly to decide the fate of the monarchy in Nepal and the countrys political future.

 They (the Maoists) have now become just like any other political party for the purpose of the election, election commission spokesman Laxman Bhattarai said.

 The rebelshave confined thousands of their former fighters to camps as part of a peace deal. But the Maoists were criticised by the UN today for blocking international monitors from verifying if their ranks in the camps included children.

 Lohan held again

 Lohan

 Los Angeles, July 24 (Reuters): Actress Lindsay Lohan was arrested for the second time in a month today, suspected of drunken driving and cocaine possession after a bizarre, pre-dawn car chase just days after finishing a six-week stint in rehabilitation, police said.

 The 21-year-old performer, who stars as a stripper abducted by a sadistic killer in her latest film, I Know Who Killed Me, which opens on Friday, already faces a drunken-driving charge following a car crash in Beverly Hills two months ago.

 She was taken into custody in the coastal city of Santa Monica at about 0830 GMT and was released from jail after posting $25,000 bond, according to police.

 Lohans lawyer issued a statement hours later saying the actress had suffered a relapse and that she was presently receiving medical care.

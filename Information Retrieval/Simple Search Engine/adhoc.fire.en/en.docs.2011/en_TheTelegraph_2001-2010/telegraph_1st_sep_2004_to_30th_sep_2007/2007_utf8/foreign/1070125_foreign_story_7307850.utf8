 Mullah Omar not in Pak, says Musharraf

 Abu Dhabi, Jan. 24 (Reuters): President Pervez Musharraf today dismissed allegations that Pakistani officials were sheltering the head of the Taliban, and said the US-led war in Afghanistan could not be won without Pakistans help.

 US ally Pakistan has come under increasing pressure from American and Afghan officials to do more in the fight against Islamist insurgents who have stepped up attacks on US and Nato forces in Afghanistan.

 The fight against terrorism and extremism, whether it is al Qaida or Taliban, can never succeed without Pakistans cooperation and Pakistan is the only country that has delivered the maximum on both, Musharraf told a news conference in the United Arab Emirates capital Abu Dhabi. 

 US intelligence chief John Negroponte, in a testimony to a Senate committee earlier this month, wrote that al Qaida leaders were holed up in a secure hideout in Pakistan, without naming Osama bin Laden or his deputy Ayman al-Zawahri. Asked about Mullah Omars presence in Quetta, Musharraf mocked the report, saying it was simply preposterous. Whoever is saying that...let me take him in my aircraft. Lets go and catch him. I will try to catch him myself.

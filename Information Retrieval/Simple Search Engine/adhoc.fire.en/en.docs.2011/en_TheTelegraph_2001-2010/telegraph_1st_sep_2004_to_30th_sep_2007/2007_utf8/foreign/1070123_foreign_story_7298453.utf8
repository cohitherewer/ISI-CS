 Paris, Jan. 22 (Reuters): Paris will not take extra measures to ban ultra-skinny models from catwalks because its rules on their health are already strict, the head of the French fashion federation said today.

 Spain barred models below a certain weight from Madrid fashion shows in September, and organisers of New Yorks fashion shows this month issued guidelines to tackle the problem.

 We must be attentive and inform young women but not regulate even more, said Didier Grumbach, head of the French fashion federation, adding that young models already had to pass strict health checks in France.

 Regulation is something that will only weigh on the atmosphere, he said ahead of a fashion show by Lebanese designer Elie Saab. Grumbach said there had been both round and very skinny models in the histoy of fashion.

 We must respect the history of fashion. We must pay attention not to link slimness and ill health. We must be very attentive, he said. Italys government have signed a pact aimed at keeping models who are sickly thin off the catwalk.

 London, July 1 (AP): Princes William and Harry took to the stage at Londons Wembley Stadium today at a star-studded pop concert in honour of their mother, Princess Diana, on what would have been her 46th birthday.

 The brothers greeted an estimated 70,000 fans at the venue and millions more watching the event on television worldwide to thank them for watching.

 This evening is about all that my mother loved in life: her music, her dance, her charities and her family and friends, said William, 25.

 Harry, 22, added a special message for his army unit, currently serving in Iraq.

 I would also like to take this opportunity to say Hi to all the guys in A Squadron of the Household Cavalry, who are serving out in Iraq at the moment, he said.

 I wish I was there with you. Im sorry I cant be. But to all of those on operations at the moment, wed both like to say stay safe.

 Harry, a second lieutenant in the regiment, was banned from going to Iraq for security reasons.

 The crowd cheered as Elton John took to the piano to sing Your Song and took to its feet as the princes introduced their mothers favourite band, Duran Duran.

 Weeks of soggy weather lifted today as the sun peeked out from behind the gray clouds rolling over Wembley Stadium, Britains biggest.

 Pray for sun! Duran Duran lead singer Simon LeBon told the crowd as the band broke into Sunrise, followed by Rio, which they dedicated to Diana.

 William rocked his hips and threw up his arms as Nelly Furtado belted out Man Eater to the apparent embarrassment of Harry, who shook his head and laughed.

 Williams former girlfriend Kate Middleton also attended the concert, further fuelling rumours that the couple, who announced their split in April, have reconciled.

 The princes have said that the memorial concert was intended to be a celebration of their mothers life, a sentiment echoed by one of the evenings many celebrity presenters.

 This will be no history, this is not an exercise in nostalgia, this is a party! Hollywood actor-director Dennis Hopper said, introducing one of the younger stars, Lily Allen, who gave a cheery rendition of her chart-topper Smile.

 Security for the event was tight, with at least 450 officers on duty to police the concert.

 Tickets for the concert cost 45 ($90) with proceeds going to causes Diana supported.

 Sailor trauma on telly

 Turney: Life-changing sum

 London, April 8: Faye Turney, the woman sailor at the centre of the Iran hostage crisis, is to reveal the trauma of her 13-day ordeal in a solo interview.

 Leading Seaman Turney, who was paraded on Iranian television during her captivity, is understood to have agreed to a lucrative deal with ITVs Tonight with Trevor McDonald for a special programme being broadcast this evening.

 It is thought the deal will also involve an interview with a tabloid newspaper. A source at the UK ministry of defence said it involved a life-changing sum.

 But the involvement of a large amount of money and her decision to be interviewed on her own could backfire.

 Turney, 26, was warned on Friday that the interview and payment could attract controversy, given the deaths of four British soldiers, including two women, in Basra on the day she was released.

 There was also surprise that the ministry of defence had allowed the deal, given that Turney remains a serving sailor on full salary. It is understood that she was offered more than 100,000 to describe exclusively her experiences of the hostage crisis and the deal with ITV and the newspaper, believed to be The Sun, is thought to be worth a substantial amount.

 Nick Harvey, the Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, said: I think this deal will cause raised eyebrows because she is still a serving sailor. She is not in the same position as those people who have sold their story after they left the service.

 I just hope her decision to sell her story does not backfire on her.

 Admiral Sir Alan West said: I am surprised that someone would even consider selling their story while they were still serving.

 A former military chief, who asked not to be named, added: If you are still serving with the military you do not go round flogging your story to anyone.

 Despite being the focus of media attention, Turney did not appear alongside seven of her colleagues at a news conference on Friday.

 That day she was spotted briefly at her home in the village of Tamerton Foliot, near Plymouth. She was driven away without making a comment. 

 The ministry of defence has given official permission to the 15, held captive in Iran, to cash in on their ordeal owing to exceptional circumstances.

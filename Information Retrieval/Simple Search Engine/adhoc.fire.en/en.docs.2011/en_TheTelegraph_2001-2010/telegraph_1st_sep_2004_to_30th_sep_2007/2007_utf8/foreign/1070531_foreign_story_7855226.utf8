 Dubai, May 30 (Reuters): The US will face worse attacks than those on September 11, 2001, if it does not heed al Qaida demands effectively allowing the group control over Muslim countries, a US Islamist militant said yesterday.

 Adam Gadahn, a California-born convert to Islam and the first American to be charged with treason since the World War II era, appeared in a video posted on the Internet. Gadahn, wearing robes and a turban, is believed to be in Pakistan.

 Your failure to meet our demands ... means that you and your people will, Allah willing, experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq, and Virginia Tech, said the bearded Gadahn, addressing his comments to President George W. Bush.

 Gadahn was referring to the Virginia Tech campus shooting rampage last month in which student gunman Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people and himself.

 This is not a call for negotiations. We do not negotiate with baby killers and war criminals like you, said Gadahn.

 You will go down in history not only as the President who embroiled his nation in a series of unwinnable and bloody conflicts in the Islamic world but as the President who set the US up on its death march.

 Listing al Qaidas demands, Gadahn said: Pull every last one of your soldiers... out of every Muslim land. If so much as one single US soldier or spy remain on Islamic soil it shall be considered sufficient justification for us to continue our defensive jihad against your nation and people.

 Gadahn demanded the US end all support moral, military, economic or otherwise to the bastard state of Israel and ban your citizens ... from travelling to occupied Palestine or settling there. The demands also included releasing all Muslim prisoners and stopping support to the apostate governments of Muslim states.

 He said a US pullout from Iraq alone would not do.

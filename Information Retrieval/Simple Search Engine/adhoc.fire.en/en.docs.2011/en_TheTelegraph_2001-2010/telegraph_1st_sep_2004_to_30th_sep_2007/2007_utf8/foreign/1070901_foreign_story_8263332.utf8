The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Fine Print

 Tight briefs

 Tokyo, Aug 31 (Reuters): Japanese men worried about bulging bellies now have another option to cutting back on beer slip into a boxer brief girdle or T-shirt with tummy-control panels.

 We made our mens brand aimed at those in their 30s and 40s, but it has been selling well among younger guys too, said Asako Iwahashi, a spokeswoman for underwear maker Triumph International Japan, which introduced its line of girdles for men last year.

 Young men are wearing tighter trousers now and like women, they want a cleaner line.

 Spears pay

 Los Angeles (AP): Kevin Federlines 

 lawyer wants Britney Spears to pay some of her ex-husbands 

 legal expenses in their divorce case, court documents show. 

 Attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan said in an August 26 declaration 

 that Federline has no net income after various 

 expenses, and that his spousal support of $20,000 a month 

 ends in November. Spears, meanwhile, brings in an average 

 monthly income of $737,868 . Spears is clearly the 

 monied party in the dispute and should 

 pay $50,000 for Federlines litigation expenses.

 Car tomb

 Berlin (Reuters): A German man said 

 on Thursday he feared he may have built his own tomb after 

 a vehicle ploughed into his house for the 10th time. If 

 we stay, someones eventually going to kill us. Were 

 living in a time bomb, Manfred Sedlazek, 59, said. 

 Sedlazeks house is built on a bend of a busy road.

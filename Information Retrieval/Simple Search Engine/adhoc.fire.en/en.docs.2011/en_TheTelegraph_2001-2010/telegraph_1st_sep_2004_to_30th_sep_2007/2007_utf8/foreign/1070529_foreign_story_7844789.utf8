 Lahore, May 28 (AP): A court today jailed Pakistans first publicly acknowledged same-sex couple for three years for perjury prompting them to ask the President for help.

 The case of Shumail Raj, who was born a woman but had two operations to remove her breasts and uterus 16 years ago, and Shahzina Tariq has made waves by raising issues of homosexuality that are taboo in Pakistan society.

 The couple, who married last year, had approached the Lahore high court for protection against harassment by Tariqs relatives. However, the judge accused them of lying about Rajs gender.

 Court-appointed doctors examined Raj and decided she was still a woman something the couple acknowledged later in court. 

 Presiding Judge Kahawaja Mohammed Sharif, announcing their conviction for perjury, said he was issuing a lenient sentence below the seven-year maximum because they had apologised.

 The judge also fined them 10,000 Pakistani rupees ($165) two months salary for an average Pakistani and dropped a charge of committing an act of unnatural lust.

 Raj and Shahzina Tariq, 26, appeared shocked by the verdict. Their eyes widened as Sharif announced their punishment and they briefly clasped each others arms before police led them away.

 Defence attorney Zahid Husain Bokhari said the couple would appeal and hoped for an acquittal. They were not alerted at any stage of the proceedings that they could be penalised, Bilal said.

 Raj, wearing a white shirt and jeans, urged President Pervez Musharraf to step in.

 We appeal to President Musharraf to intervene, Raj told reporters outside the court. Asked about the prospect of three years in different jails for women, she said: No matter, no matter. We love each other.

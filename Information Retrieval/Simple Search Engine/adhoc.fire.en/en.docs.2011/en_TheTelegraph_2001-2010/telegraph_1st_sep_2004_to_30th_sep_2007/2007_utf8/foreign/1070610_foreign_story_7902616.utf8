 Putin 2012 plans

 Moscow, June 9 (Reuters): Vladimir Putin, whose term as Russian President ends next year, does not rule out running again in 2012, a leading Russian daily reported today.

 The future plans of the 54-year-old Putin, by far Russias most powerful and popular politician, are the hottest topic of the Russian presidential succession.

 The constitution limits him to two successive four-year terms in power, though further terms are possible after a break.

 Putin has said he will not change the constitution to get a third consecutive term and has already made clear he will not retire altogether after the March 2008 election.

 But he has not yet given any details about what he will do.

 Asked by reporters in the German town of Heiligendamm, where leaders of the Group of Eight industrial nations met yesterday, whether he could run again in 2012, Putin replied: In theory its possible and the constitution doesnt forbid it.

 However, theres still a long way to go and I havent even started thinking about that, he added.

 G-8 protests in Germany turn violent

 Rostock (Germany), June 2 (Reuters): German police clashed with hundreds of protesters in the port of Rostock today following a much larger peaceful demonstration against next weeks Group of Eight summit in a nearby Baltic resort.

 About 2,000 protesters, identified by police as violent activists, threw bottles, sticks and stones at riot police, who tried to disperse the crowd in the harbour area with water cannons and tear gas. Reuters witnesses saw dozens of arrests but police declined to comment on numbers.

 The violence, which left 146 police officers injured, followed a series of marches through the city in which police said about 25,000 people took part, far fewer than the 100,000 predicted by organisers, who said 80,000 people were present.

 There was a massive outbreak against police officers. Stones were thrown and they used sticks too, said a police spokeswoman. She could not confirm how many were detained. 

 Earlier, a diverse group of protesters marched through an overcast Rostock with slogans ranging from Stop Privatisation!, to World Peace Now! and Water Is A Human Right!. 

 Many wore face masks of President George W. Bush and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Both will join German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other G-8 leaders in Heiligendamm, around 25 km west of Rostock, next week for talks that will touch on climate change and African poverty.

 Individuals in one group were dressed as medieval kings. We are trying to show the similarities between the kings of the dark ages and how the Group of Eight behave today, said Sigurd Jakobsen, a Danish student who sailed to Rostock on a boat from Copenhagen.

 Church groups, environmental activists, cultural societies and feminists all took part in the demonstrations, joining traditional anti-G-8 protesters who say globalisation and capitalism perpetuate poverty in the developing world.

 Most of the peaceful protesters dispersed quickly as a hard core group of troublemakers, dressed in black from head to toe, started throwing sticks and stones at the police late in the afternoon. Shopkeepers in the main commercial district of Rostock have taken precautions against vandalism by boarding up storefronts.

 Activists blamed the police for using heavy-handed tactics which provoked the protesters. Demonstration organiser, Werner Raetz, had warned earlier that stringent checks could anger protesters.

 What we do fear is the polices actions in the next few days could anger people to the extent that they do things which are not planned, he said before the demonstration.

 Brad tours green home

 New Orleans, Aug. 22 (AP): Brad Pitt yesterday toured the site of an environmentally friendly home being built in an impoverished New Orleans neighbourhood based on the winning design from a competition launched by the actor to help the hard-hit area recover from Hurricane Katrina.

 Wearing khaki pants, a T-shirt and hard hat, Pitt walked through the partially constructed home in the Lower 9th Ward, pointing out its many green features, including blue walls treated with a non-toxic repellant for mould and termites.

 Theres light coming in from all sides and a lot of ventilation, said Pitt, standing in what will be the homes living room. A lot of thought has gone into this house.

 The three-bedroom, single-family home is the first of five slated for the Holy Cross section of the neighbourhood based on the winning design in a competition launched in 2006 by Pitt and the environmental organisation Global Green USA.

 The winning design, submitted by Matthew Berman and Andrew Kotchen of Workshop APD in New York, includes energy saving appliances, a cistern, toilets designed for water conservation, soy-based insulation, paperless dry wall, solar panels and a roof on the second-story deck designed to help insulate the house and channel water to the cistern.

 The house is also designed to cut utility costs for the low-income families who comprised most of the residents of the neighbourhood before Katrina. Pitt said electric bills will be cut by 75 per cent; water use, by half.

 Developers broke ground on the home in May and should be finished in the next month or two. 

 It will serve as a model home and visitor centre while construction of other houses is under way. Besides the single-family homes, plans call for an 18-unit apartment complex and community centre.

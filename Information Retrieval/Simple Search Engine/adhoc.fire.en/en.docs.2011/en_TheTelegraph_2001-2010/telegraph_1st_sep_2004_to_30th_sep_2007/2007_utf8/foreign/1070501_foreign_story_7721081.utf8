 Kansas City (Missouri), April 30 (AP): A man driving a dead womans car shot a police officer, then opened fire in a parking lot and a mall, authorities said. By the end of the day, four people, including the gunman, were dead.

 The chaos ended on Sunday when police shot the gunman to death outside a Target discount store inside Ward Parkway Center in south Kansas City, police spokesman Tony Sanders said.

 The gunfire sent shoppers and employees scurrying for cover.

 Target employee Cassie Bradshaw, 19, of Kansas City was in a break room with two other people when they first heard shots. Then, her co-workers saw a man in his 50s with a rifle shooting everywhere, she said.

 It sounded like maybe firecrackers at first but then they got louder and louder and louder, and it sounded like someone shooting a gun, she said.

 The string of violence began early on Sunday afternoon, when police went to a home to check on an elderly woman relatives hadnt seen for days. The woman was found dead and her car missing, Sanders said.

 The car was spotted later in the day at a gas station by an officer, who pulled the driver over and was shot in the arm, police said. The officer, whose wound was not life-threatening, returned fire and shattered the window of the gunmans car.

 The car took off and reports began arriving about 10 to 15 minutes later of shots fired at the shopping centre. 

 The man pulled into a parking space and fired at the cars on either side of him, killing two people, authorities said. He fired more shots, wounding at least two people, then went inside the mall, Sanders said.

 Everybody was leaving the mall when the officers ran inside, he said. They confronted the man and after confronting him, shot and killed him.

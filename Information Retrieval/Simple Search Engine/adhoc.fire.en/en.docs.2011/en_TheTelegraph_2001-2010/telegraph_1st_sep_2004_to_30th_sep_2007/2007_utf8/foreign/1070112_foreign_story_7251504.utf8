 Russia oil

 Moscow/Minsk, Jan. 11 (Reuters): Russia restarted the flow of oil through its main oil export pipeline today after Belarus dropped an oil transit duty imposed last week and agreed to return oil Moscow said it had taken illegally.

 Belarus has fully returned 79,000 tonnes of oil, Sergei Grigoryev, vice-president of Russian pipeline monopoly Transneft, said. The Druzhba pipeline is working normally.

 Russia, the worlds second biggest oil exporter, had closed the Druzhba pipeline for over 60 hours, cutting European Union oil supplies by around 1.5 million barrels per day.

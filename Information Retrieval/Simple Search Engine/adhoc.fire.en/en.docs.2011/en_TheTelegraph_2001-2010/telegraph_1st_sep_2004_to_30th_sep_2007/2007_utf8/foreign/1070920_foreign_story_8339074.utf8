 Bid to woo back Maoists

 Kathmandu, Sept. 19 (Reuters): Nepals ruling alliance said it had positive talks with the Maoists today as it tried to persuade the former rebels to rejoin the government and back a historic poll to decide the countrys political future.

 The negotiations came a day after the Maoists quit the interim government following refusal by other parties to establish a republic immediately, ahead of a November 22 vote to decide the future of the monarchy. Their decision is seen as a setback to last years peace deal which ended a decade-long civil war and brought the Maoists into the mainstream.

 We had positive talks and the meetings will continue, said Madhav Kumar Nepal, general-secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal (UML).

 The ruling alliance was represented by leaders of seven political parties in the interim government, formed after King Gyanendra gave up absolute power last year, officials said. All top leaders of the eight political parties agreed that there is a need for unity among themselves to carry forward the peace process and democracy, said peace and reconstruction Minister Ram Chandra Poudel.

 Maoist leader Dev Gurung echoed those sentiments. We will try to resolve issues of national importance in the spirit of unity through a consensus, he said.

 Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala had urged the Maoist ministers to withdraw their resignation letters but there was no agreement on this, Gurung added.

 The former guerrillas have vowed to launch nationwide street protests to disrupt the Constituent Assembly elections meant to draft a new constitution and decide the future of the monarchy. 

 Ironically, that assembly had been one of the Maoists key demands during their insurgency.

 House hunt for Posh amp; Becks

 David and Victoria Beckham 

 Los Angeles, Feb. 19: British soccer star David Beckham and his wife, Victoria, the former Spice Girl known as Posh, are taking a break back in the UK after a whirlwind home-hunting spree in Los Angeles. 

 But gone or not, the famous couples efforts to find a place to live are the talk of the realty world. By some accounts, the Beckhams looked at more than 20 homes before returning to London. 

 What did they see? Just about every Westside estate listed in the $18-million-to-$30-million range. Beckham, who signed a five-year deal with the Los Angels Galaxy thats potentially worth $250 million, is hoping to spend under $20 million. 

 The Beckhams agent, Barry Peele of Sothebys International Realty, seemed doubtful when told that his clients had looked at more than 20 houses, but he declined to comment, saying he had signed a lengthy confidentiality agreement. Peele also demurred when asked about the rumour that Beckham had approached Madonna, a longtime client of his, about selling them her Beverly Hills compound. 

 More forthcoming were several top Westside real estate agents, who were eager to offer the newcomers advice. 

 Theyll be away three weeks, said Kurt Rappaport of Westside Estate Agency. Maybe there will be more homes for them to see when they get back. There have been several new Multiple Listing Service entries since the pair left a couple of weeks ago. 

 One local real estate agent is stocking up on pocket listings in the $20-million vicinity, hoping to entice the couple into buying a house that is not yet on the market. 

 Forget homes that will require a lot of upkeep. Another agent reported that the soccer icon doesnt want a home where hed be expected to fix things. What does he want for $20 million anyway? 

 If the Brits were willing to go as high as the $30-million range, they could have a Beverly Hills home with enough parking for their sizable entourage. For example, there is a 2-acre-plus estate with a six-car garage and a huge motor court offered at $31 million, said Cecelia Waeschle of Sothebys International Realty.

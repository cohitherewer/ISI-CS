 London, July 3 (Reuters): Australian pop diva Kylie Minogue will join the cast of cult science-fiction TV drama Doctor Who for a special Christmas episode, the BBC said today.

 Britains public-funded broadcaster said Minogue, 39, would play a major lead role alongside Dr Who actor David Tennant. 

 The hour-long episode, Voyage of the Damned, will start filming in Cardiff, Wales, in July.

 It is an incredible thrill to be joining David and the entire Dr Who production for this years Christmas special, said Minogue. Dr Who enjoys a unique history and it is going to be very exciting to be a part of that.

 Iran sanctions

 United Nations, March 15 (Reuters): Six major powers announced an agreement today to impose new UN sanctions on Iran for its nuclear programme, but Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad vowed the initiative would not sway his country.

 The sanctions measure was sent to the 15-nation UN Security Council for an anticipated vote next week. It would penalise Tehran for refusing to suspend uranium enrichment, which can be used in nuclear bombs or for peaceful ends.

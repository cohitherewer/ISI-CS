 Exile-for-son buzz rises around Khaleda

 Dhaka, April 17 (Reuters): Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Khaleda Zia may head into exile in the latest political twist since an army-backed government began a drive against corruption and the countrys entrenched power elite.

 One of Khaledas detained sons was released early today as part of a deal with the government for her family to go abroad, Bangladeshi newspapers reported today.

 A close Khaleda associate confirmed to Reuters that her departure is imminent and said she made the deal with the government out of frustration over lack of support from top officials of her political party.

 But another former Prime Minister, Khaleda rival Sheikh Hasina, who has been charged with murder and extortion, has separately vowed to return home from the US to contest the false and fake cases against her. Authorities arrested Khaledas sons as part of a crackdown on corruption by the interim government which followed the imposition of emergency law on January 11.

 Elder son and political heir-apparent Tarique Rahman was detained last month, and the younger son, businessman Arafat Rahman Koko, was taken by army-led joint forces early yesterday. Today, a Dhaka high court ordered the suspension of Tariques corruption trial for six months, court officials said.

 Leading newspapers said Arafats release was part of a deal with the government for Khaledas family to go into exile in Saudi Arabia. 

 However, communication minister in the caretaker government M.A. Matin said no agreement was worked out with Khaleda for her going abroad. Law and information adviser Moinul Hussain said the government had no plans to send Khaleda and Hasina abroad. However, Matin said that if the two leaders want to go abroad, they were free to do so. 

 On Arafats release, Hussain said: Law enforcers can release anyone if charges are not strong enough against him. Just taking him away for interrogation does not necessarily mean he will be jailed.

 One of Khaledas close associates, who declined to be identified, quoted her as saying: I am frustrated as I have not received desired support and sympathy from my party while I myself and my family are going through a disastrous time. Khaleda added: So I have decided to go, as the government wants.

 Khaleda had talked to several followers who were not among the luminaries of her Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) by telephone, and she even wept, another associate said.

 Hussain, however, criticised the persistence of traditional family politics in a democratic system. We must get rid of family politics, this is the root of bad politics which leads to corruption, he said.

 Khaleda who has been under virtual confinement at her home for more than a week ended a five-year term as Prime Minister last October, handing power to a pre-election interim authority.

More than 160 senior politicians have been arrested on charges of graft and abuse of power since the government imposed a state of emergency .

 Hasina, who began a private visit to the US in early April, said she would leave Washington for London tomorrow and intended to travel on to Dhaka at the weekend.

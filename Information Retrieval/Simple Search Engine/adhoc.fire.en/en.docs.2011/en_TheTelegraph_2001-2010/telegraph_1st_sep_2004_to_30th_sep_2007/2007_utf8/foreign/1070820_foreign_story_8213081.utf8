 Camel kills woman for sex

 Brisbane, Aug. 19 (AP): An Australian woman was killed by her pet camel after the animal apparently tried to have sex with her, police said.

 The woman, whose name was not released, was killed yesterday at her familys sheep and cattle ranch near Mitchell, 600km west of this city, state police detective senior constable Craig Gregory said.

 The 10-month-old male camel weighing about 150kg knocked the woman to the ground, lay on top of her, then exhibited what police suspect was mating behaviour, the detective said. Id say its probably been playing, or it may be even a sexual sort of thing, Gregory said, adding the camel almost suffocated the familys pet goat by straddling it on several occasions.

 The camel was gifted by the victims husband and daughter in March on her 60th birthday.

 Panel on Pak judge

 Islamabad, May 8 (Reuters): Pakistans Supreme Court drew up a broad panel of judges today to consider a challenge by the countrys suspended top judge to a judicial watchdogs proceedings against him, a court official said.

 The announcement was the latest twist in a judicial crisis that began on March 9, when President Pervez Musharraf suspended Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry and ordered a judicial inquiry into accusations of misconduct and misuse of authority.

 The move outraged the legal community, which sees it as an attack on judicial independence, and galvanised opposition to Musharraf in the run-up to elections.

 The row has blown up into the most serious challenge to Musharrafs authority since the army chief seized power in 1999.

 The Supreme Court yesterday suspended the five-judge Supreme Judicial Councils hearing into the accusations against Chaudhry, pending a decision on his challenge to the panel.

 Acting Chief Justice Rana Bhagwandas drew up a bench of almost all of the Supreme Courts 19 judges to consider Chaudhrys challenge, a court official said.

 The Supreme Court panel would convene from May 14 on a daily basis, said the official, who declined to be identified.

 Chaudhrys legal team is expected to raise objections to at least two of the judges on the panel.

 Chaudhry is due to travel to the southern city of Karachi on Saturday to speak to lawyers.

 The city is controlled by a pro-Musharraf party which this week said it would hold a rally on Saturday to protest against political tricks in the name of the independence of judiciary.

 America was hottest in 2006

 Washington, Jan. 10: Last year was the warmest in the continental US in the past 112 years capping a nine-year warming streak unprecedented in the historical record that was driven in part by the burning of fossil fuels, the government reported yesterday. 

 According to the governments National Climatic Data Center, the record-breaking warmth which caused daffodils and cherry trees to bloom throughout the East on New Years Day was the result of both unusual regional weather patterns and the long-term effects of the build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 

 People should be concerned about what we are doing to the climate, said Jay Lawrimore, chief of the climate monitoring branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Burning of fossil fuels is causing an increase in greenhouse gases, and theres a broad scientific consensus that is producing climate change. 

 The centre said there are indications that the rate at which global temperatures are rising is speeding up. 

 Average temperatures nationwide in 2006 were 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the mean temperatures nationwide for the 20th century, the agency said. 

 It reported that seven months in 2006 were much warmer than average, and that last month was the fourth-warmest December on record. Average temperatures for all 48 contiguous states were above or well above average, and New Jersey logged its hottest temperatures ever. 

 Many researchers are concerned that rising temperatures could lead to widespread melting of the polar ice caps, resulting in higher sea levels and more extreme droughts and storms. 

 But NOAA also pointed to one silver lining: The unusually warm temperatures from October to December helped keep residential energy use for heating 13.5 percent below the average for that period. 

 NOAA said an El Nino weather pattern in the equatorial Pacific also contributed to the warm temperatures by blocking cold Arctic air from moving south and east. 

 Climate experts generally do not make much of temperature fluctuations over one or two years, but Lawrimore said the record 2006 temperatures were part of a long and worrisome trend. For instance, NOAA said, the past nine years have all been among the 25 warmest years on record for the continental US. 

 Advocates for more action to control carbon dioxide emissions also voiced concern. No one should be surprised that 2006 is the hottest year on record for the US, said climate scientist Brenda Ekwurzel.

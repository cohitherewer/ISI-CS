 A tale of Wolfowitzs tenuous bank tenure

 NICOLE GAOUETTE AND JOEL HAVEMANN

 Pressure mounts

 Washington, May 8: A special committee of the World Banks governing board increased pressure on president Paul D. Wolfowitz to resign, concluding that he went too far in arranging a job and pay raises for his companion.

 The seven-member committee did not make its report public, but a bank official with ties to the panel said that Wolfowitz was given only a day or two to respond. The manoeuvre seemed designed to force him to step down quickly, thus avoiding further public action in the bruising controversy.

 The report was characterised as an exhaustive, 300-page indictment of Wolfowitzs management of the international communitys premier anti-poverty institution, according to sources familiar with the document. The sources declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak for the committee or the bank.

 In a further sign of Wolfowitzs deteriorating position, one of his top aides, Kevin Kellems, resigned yesterday. He had served as a senior advisor and director of external relations strategy during Wolfowitzs time at the bank. 

 Given the current environment surrounding the leadership of the World Bank Group, it is very difficult to be effective in helping to advance the mission of the institution, Kellems said, adding that he was leaving to pursue other opportunities.

 I have tremendous respect and admiration for the bank staff and management and treasure the many friendships, he said.

 Kellems had worked at the Pentagon when Wolfowitz was deputy defence secretary.

 He and another top Wolfowitz aide, Robin Cleveland, had become a focus of criticism inside the bank, where staffers considered them more loyal to Bush administration policy than dedicated to the international mission of the World Bank. 

 Wolfowitz, who is two years into a five-year term as president, has vowed not to quit saying he acted in accordance with bank ethics rules and did nothing wrong in making the job arrangements for his companion, Shaha Ali Riza, who was already an official at the World Bank when he became president.

 When he took office, Wolfowitz brought the possible conflict of interest to the boards attention, and it was agreed Riza should leave the bank. Exactly how the arrangements were made for her transfer to the US state department and her salary increases is in dispute.

 But the conflict issue is only the most concrete manifestation of a larger controversy over what Wolfowitzs critics see as his high-handed management style and a nave, sometimes partisan campaign to stamp out corruption in countries receiving World Bank assistance.

 Many of the banks worldwide staff of 13,000 have been openly critical of Wolfowitz, complaining bitterly that he cut himself off from the banks career experts and made decisions unilaterally. Among the decisions they objected to was the opening of an office in Iraq where many bank officials regard security as too chancy for the institution to operate effectively.

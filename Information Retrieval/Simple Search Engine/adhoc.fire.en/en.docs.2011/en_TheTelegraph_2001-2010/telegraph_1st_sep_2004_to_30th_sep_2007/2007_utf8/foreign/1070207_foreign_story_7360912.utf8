 Hi-tech pram

 Tel Aviv, Feb. 6 (Reuters): Most parents worried about their baby getting too hot in a pram will adjust blankets or head for shade, but one dad wanted a more high tech solution for his young daughter -- a portable air conditioner.

 At first I was trying to cool her off with a hand-held fan. Then I thought of a much simpler idea a little air conditioner, Israeli Ofir Ben Aharon said.

 The device, which weighs less than 2 kg looks like a motorised fan attached to the end of about a half-metre long pipe that can be fitted under a typical pram. An air vent connected to the other side of the pipe is fitted with a puppet so it can be propped inside, looking like just another of babys stuffed toys.

 Cheese cam

 London (Reuters): As pastimes go it is in the same league as watching paint dry, with perhaps a frisson of extra excitement. English firm West Country Farmhouse Cheesemakers has turned a web camera on a rack of its maturing cheddar cheeses to give aficionados a chance to watch in real time the slow process of mould growth for a whole year and without having to leave home. It puts watching paint dry in the shade. If you happen to tune in at the right time you will even get to see them being turned, a company spokeswoman said.

 US plays down role in climate change 

 US energy secretary Sam Bodman

 Washington, Feb. 3 (Reuters): The Bush administration played down the US contribution to world climate change today and called for a global discussion after a UN report blamed humans for much of the warming over the past 50 years.

 We are a small contributor when you look at the rest of the world, US energy secretary Sam Bodman said of greenhouse gas emissions. Its really got to be a global discussion.

 The US is responsible for one-quarter of the worlds emissions of carbon dioxide and uses one-quarter of the worlds crude oil. A unilateral US programme to cut emissions might hurt the economy and send business overseas, Bodman said.

 But Senator Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who chairs the US Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said: This report must serve as a wake-up call to those policymakers who have ignored this issue. We must take action now.

 Speaking later to reporters at the UN, Boxer called on President George W. Bush to convene a summit of 12 nations most responsible for polluting the atmosphere and said she was also inviting to Washington soon some of the worlds top scientists who contributed to the UN report. 

 Bodman, speaking in measured tones that accepted the reality of global climate change, but stopped short of urging specific limits on the emission of greenhouse gases that contribute to it, hailed the report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released in Paris.

 Were very pleased with it. Were embracing it. We agree with it, Bodman told a news conference. Human activity is contributing to changes in our Earths climate and that issue is no longer up for debate.

 He reiterated the administrations opposition to mandatory caps on the emission of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas produced naturally and by coal-fired power plants and petroleum-fuelled vehicles, among other sources.

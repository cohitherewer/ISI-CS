 Berlusconi says sorry 

 Rome, Jan. 31 (Reuters): The wife of Italys former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi forced him to make a public apology today for sexist quips that outraged her so much she published an open letter scorning him in a leading newspaper.

 Berlusconi told some women at a TV awards dinner last week that if I wasnt already married I would marry you right away, and with you Id go anywhere, she wrote.

 Veronica, Berlusconis second wife and mother of three, said she decided to make her marital spat public after being refused an apology in private.

 Late in the day, Italys richest man went public, saying: Here I am, saying Im sorry. I was recalcitrant in private.... Challenged in public, the temptation to give in to you is strong. I cant resist.

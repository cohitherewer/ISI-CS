The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Radio on offer in new iPod

 The beat goes on

 London, Sept. 5: Apple will today reveal details of the long-awaited sixth generation iPod, with speculation rife about how the firm plans to improve its top-selling gadget.

 The new MP3 player is expected to boast a wider, touch-sensitive screen similar to the iPhone, the companys successful mobile phone which was launched three months ago. 

 It may also allow users to listen to digital radio and buy songs as they hear them, according to reports. 

 A reliable industry insider told the technology website vnunet.com that the announcement will include plans to bring digital radio to the iPod along with an option to buy music using the device. 

 Steve Jobs, the Apple chief executive, has previously hinted that the new iPods will be able to run a simple version of OS X, the operating system used by Apple computers.

 Other rumours suggest the upgraded MP3 player may also have wireless Internet capability, although some analysts have said this is unlikely, as this would encroach on the iPhones market.

 The anticipation surrounding the iPod revamp - the first since video technology was added in 2005 - has been cleverly nurtured by Apple.

 Journalists were sent invitations to attend an event at San Franciscos Moscone Center, but given no details of what would be announced.

 The invitation was illustrated with a picture of a silhouetted iPod-wearing figure dancing above the words: The beat goes on.

 The phrase reportedly appeared in the last press release issued by the Beatles before they broke up, leading to speculation that Apple may be set to announce that the bands back catalogue will finally be available on iTunes, the companys online music store.

 Earlier this year, The Beatles settled a 30 million row over royalty payments with record company EMI, clearing the final obstacle to the release of all the bands songs over the internet.

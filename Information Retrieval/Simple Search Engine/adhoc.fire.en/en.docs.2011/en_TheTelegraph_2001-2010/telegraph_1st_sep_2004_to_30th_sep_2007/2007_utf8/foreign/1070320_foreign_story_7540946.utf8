 Superpower gets a taste of superjumbo

 New York, March 19 (Reuters): The worlds largest passenger plane made its debut in the US today, as two of its Airbuss A380 superjumbos touched down in New York and Los Angeles.

 The first US flights for the 555-seat, double-decker plane kick off a series of exercises to ensure that the giant aircraft is compatible with major US airports, which have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in upgrades to accommodate it.

 Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and New Yorks John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) are spending about $300 million to widen runways and provide special docking equipment for the plane, which has a wingspan of almost the length of an American football field.

 The A380 which landed at New York is set for further flights to Chicagos Hare Airport tomorrow, and will land at Washingtons Dulles Airport on March 25.

 Todays flight to New York from Frankfurt was operated in conjunction with Germanys Lufthansa , and carrying about 500 Airbus and Lufthansa employees along with Airbus suppliers and VIPs.

 The flight to Los Angeles, from Toulouse, France, was operated with Australias Qantas , carrying only its crew and a squad of engineers. Both airlines are customers for the A380.

 Airbus has spent more than $10 billion developing the A380, which has a list price of about $319 million. So far it has racked up 156 orders from 14 customers, but has yet to score an order from a US airline. We look forward to talking to United and Northwest, said Airbus marketing chief John Leahy on the tarmac at JFK after seeing the plane land.

 UAL Corps United Airlines and Northwest Airlines Corp. are the most likely US carriers to buy the plane, given their extensive long-haul Asian routes.

 Signing up a US airline would be a huge financial and morale boost for Airbus, owned by European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company, which has been dragged into billion of dollars in losses and corporate turmoil by delays on the huge plane.

 The aircraft was designed to challenge Boeing Cos dominance in the market for very large planes, which it has virtually had to itself with its long-running 747. The latest, stretched version of the 747 is actually longer than the A380, but the European plane towers over its rival and can accommodate 90 more passengers.

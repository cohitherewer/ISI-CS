 Britney boost

 New York, March 8 (AP): Rapper-producer Timbaland, who has crafted hits for Justin Timberlake and Nelly Furtado, wants to help Britney Spears reclaim her once-stellar career.

 I feel her pain, it really bothers me, the 34-year-old says in an interview in Entertainment Weekly magazines March 16 issue.

 Im the type of person who tries to save the world. I just want to take her away, go overseas, and work (it) out.

 Timbaland says he invited Timberlake, his best friend and Spearss ex-boyfriend, to be part of that plan.

 I asked Justin: How would you feel about me working with Britney? I had to ask him that, Timbaland is quoted as saying. I said: Would you do it with me? The 26-year-old SexyBack singer said he would, according to Timbaland.

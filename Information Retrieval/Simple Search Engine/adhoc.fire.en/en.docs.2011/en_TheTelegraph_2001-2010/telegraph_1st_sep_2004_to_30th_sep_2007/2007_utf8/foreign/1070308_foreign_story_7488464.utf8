 Abu Dhabis sand Louvre

 Abu, March 7 (Reuters): Abu Dhabi signed a deal with France yesterday to build a spinoff of its most famous museum, the Louvre, in the Gulf emirate better known for oil than art.

 Abu Dhabi will pay 400 million euros ($525 million) to use the prestigious Louvre name for 30 years as part of a cultural accord that will see paintings from the home of the Mona Lisa exhibited in the museum to be built on a luxury resort island.

 We have decided to create together a museum destined to foster cultural dialogue between East and West by exhibiting works of major importance ... spanning all historic periods, said French culture minister Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres, who signed the deal in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates capital.

 French governments have traditionally seen Frances rich cultural heritage as a tool for furthering political interests. The plan to export a version of the Louvre has sparked accusations in France that the government was sacrificing cultural standards for profit.

 Dubbed the Louvre in the sands by French media, the project has triggered opposition from experts in France who fear it will distort the museums true function as a centre of scholarship and home to western art treasures.

 Donnedieu de Vabres defended the deal, which includes temporary loans of art works, technical support and training, as one that would spread French culture, but reassured critics that the Louvres greatest treasures would never leave France.

 The UAE, an energy-producing federation of seven emirates that includes Dubai, is developing its tourism industry as part of a drive to wean the economy off oil money.

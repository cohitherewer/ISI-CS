 London, May 8: Archaeologists in Israel claim to have unearthed the tomb of the biblical King Herod.

 Pieces of an elaborate sarcophagus believed to contain Herods remained were found at Herodium, a mesa rising more than 750 metres above sea level around 7.5 miles south of Jerusalem in the occupied West Bank.

 Herod built a palace on the flattened hilltop and it was long thought that he was buried on the site, but years of excavations failed to find his burial spot.

 Three weeks ago we found the sarcophagus and we knew that it was it, said Ehud Netzer, a professor of archaeology at Hebrew University, who led the digs and has been working at the site for three decades.

 The location and unique nature of the findings, as well as the historical record, leave no doubt that this was Herods burial site.

 Herod, sometimes called Herod the Great, was appointed king of Judea by the Romans in around 40 BC.

 Famed for expanding the Jewish second temple during his reign in the first century BC, Herod is best known for his alleged role in the events known as the Massacre of the Innocents, an account of which appears in the Bible. According to scripture, King Herod ordered the execution of all young male children in the village of Bethlehem, to avoid the loss of his throne to a newborn King of the Jews.

 Netzer said the tomb was discovered when a team of researchers found pieces of a limestone sarcophagus believed to belong to the ancient king. Although there were no bones in the container, he said the sarcophagus location and ornate appearance indicated it belonged to Herod.

 Nepal to cut palace staff

 J. HEMANTH 

 Kathmandu, March 15: Nepals multi-party government today decided to cut down the number of staff members at the Narayanhitti Palace by 50 per cent while offering the option of voluntary retirement to another 25 per cent. 

 A cabinet meeting at Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koiralas office here today decided to re-assign the staff members who will be removed from their duties at the palace. For instance, bureaucrats posted at the palace would be absorbed in the civil services. 

 In a briefing to reporters, the minister of state for information and communication, Dilendra Prasad Badu, said that 25 per cent of the palace staff would be offered a voluntary retirement scheme. There are currently 774 employees on the palace rolls . Most of them had been recruited directly. 

 Badu also said that the cabinet had decided to scale down the security at the palace. The number of security officials deployed in the palace would be reduced to realistic levels,he said. 

 The cabinets decision comes as a major blow for King Gyanendra and the royal family who are used to having a huge retinue of servants at their beck and call. Most of these employees, considered a privileged lot during the panchayat regime, were employed by the palace secretariat.

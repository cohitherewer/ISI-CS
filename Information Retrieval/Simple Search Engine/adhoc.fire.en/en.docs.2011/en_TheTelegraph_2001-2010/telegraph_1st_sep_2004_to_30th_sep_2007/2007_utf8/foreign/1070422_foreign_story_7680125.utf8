 Fun to be bad

 Los Angeles, April 21 (Reuters): He enjoys a reputation as an all-around good guy in Hollywood, but Spider-Man Tobey Maguire says its more fun being bad in the latest sequel of the smash hit film series.

 Spider-Man 3, based on the spider-like superhero of comic book fame, Maguire and movie director Sam Raimi show the dark side of the crime-fighters alter ego, Peter Parker.

 Raimi, who has long been a fan of the Spider-Man comics, said it was difficult to show his heros dark side, but Maguire had an opposite reaction.

 I probably had the most fun doing those (bad Spidey) scenes, the star said yesterday. Its something I think is kind of unexpected since Peter Parker behaves in some of the ways he behaves.

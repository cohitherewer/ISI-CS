 Potter to bare all on stage

 NIGEL REYNOLDS

 Daniel Radcliffe

 London, Jan. 30: This is Daniel Radcliffe, the Harry Potter star, as no fan of Hogwarts wizardry has ever seen him before. 

 The picture was released before 17-year-old Radcliffes stage debut in which he must appear naked in the West End, playing Alan Strang, the disturbed stable lad who blinds horses, in the first London revival of Peter Schaffers Equus. 

 Thea Sharrock, director of the new show, said: Oh My God when she saw Radcliffe undress for the photoshoot in a hangar near Heathrow, according to the producer David Pugh. 

 There was no hesitancy about taking off his clothes, he said. When that boy takes his shirt off, Harry Potter has flown out of Hogwarts for good. 

 The play opens at the Gielgud Theatre on February 27.

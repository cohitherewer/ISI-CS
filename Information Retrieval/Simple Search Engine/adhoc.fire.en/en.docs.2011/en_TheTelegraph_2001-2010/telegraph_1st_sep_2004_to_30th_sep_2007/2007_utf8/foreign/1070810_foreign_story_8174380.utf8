 Maoists flex muscle

 J. HEMANTH 

 Kathmandu , Aug. 9: A group of Maoist activists raided a police station in southeastern Nepal and looted two rifles, a pistol and some ammunition this afternoon. 

 This is the first time that the Maoists have attacked a police station after joining the coalition government.

 According to the Nuwakot district superintendent of police, Dhiraj Pratap Singh, Maoist activists attacked the Fikuri station and assaulted the policemen who were posted there. Singh said the attack took place after a minor dispute between the Maoists and the police. The district superintendent said the activists fled from the police station with the weapons and 100 bullets. Additional forces have been dispatched to Fikuri, he said. Details on the incident are still awaited. 

 Inspector Dilip Giri of the district police office said the activists, led by their area in-charge Rajkumar Regmi alias Sandesh, raided the station as the policemen were helping the Madhesi Peoples Rights Forum to expand their base in the village against the Maoists.

 Pearl honour

 Miami Beach (Florida), April 16 (AP): Daniel Pearl was added to the 30,000 names etched on the Holocaust Memorial Wall here to honour the American journalist who was abducted and killed by terrorists in 2002.

 Although Pearls death and the Jews of the Holocaust were executed by people of different faith, language and agendas, there is a common thread of hatred, his father Judea Pearl told a crowd of hundreds as his sons name was unveiled yesterday as the first non-Holocaust victim to be remembered at the wall in Miami Beach.

 The forces of barbarity and evil are still active in our world. The Holocaust didnt finish in 1945, Judea Pearl said. Daniel Pearl, the Wall Street Journals South Asia bureau chief, was abducted on January 23, 2002, while working on a story about Islamic militants in Karachi. Four days later, the Journal and other media outlets received pictures of Pearl with a pistol to his head. A group calling itself the National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty claimed responsibility for the kidnapping and demanded that suspected Taliban and al Qaida fighters be released from US custody.

 The journalists body was found months later in a shallow ditch in a compound on the outskirts of Karachi. His throat had been slit. Three Islamic militants are serving life sentences in Pakistan for the killing; a fourth was sentenced to death. A Pentagon transcript released last month revealed that suspected 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed confessed to personally beheading Pearl.

 Diet gores Green Al

 PHILIP SHERWELL

 The Gore Cartoon 

New York, Sept. 9: He may 

 be the hero of the environmental movement for his crusade 

 against global warming but Al Gore is about to be targeted 

 by animal rights activists over his carnivorous contribution 

 to greenhouse gases.

 Citing UN research that the meat industry is worse for the environment than driving and flying, animal rights groups are directing a campaign at the former American Vice-Presidents diet.

 When he delivers a lecture on global warming in Denver next month, protesters will display billboards bearing a cartoon image of Gore eating a drumstick and the message: Too chicken to go vegetarian? Meat is the No. 1 cause of global warming.

 The campaign is being organised by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) and is backed by other animal rights groups.

 For Al Gore, the fact that his diet is a leading contributor to global warming is a highly inconvenient truth pun intended, said Matt Prescott, a spokesperson for Peta.

 Gore won an Oscar this year for An Inconvenient Truth, the documentary based on his lecture-circuit presentation detailing how man is allegedly destroying the environment.

 But he is now under fire for failing to highlight the impact of meat-eating.

 According to recent UN Food and Agriculture Organisation research, animal agriculture generates 18 per cent of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions more than the 13.5 per cent produced by all forms of transport combined.

 Gores eating habits have previously drawn attention only because of his dramatic weight fluctuations.

 He cut a far slimmer figure in the run-up to the 2000 election than since and observers would regard a reduction in his waistline as a likely sign that he intends join the Democrats race for the White House next year.

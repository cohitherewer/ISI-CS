 Khaleda son confesses to graft

 Rahman

 Dhaka, May 20 (PTI): Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zias elder son Tarique Rahman has admitted to his involvement in corruption and sought peoples forgiveness, a media report here said today.

 The Manovjamin newspaper printed a signed statement of Rahman, also the senior joint secretary general of Khaledas Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), given by him to intelligence agencies on March 12 after his arrest from his mothers Dhaka residence.

 Rahman blamed his childhood friend and business partner Giasuddin-al Mamun for dragging him into corrupt practices.

 I seek apology from the people of the country. I consciously or unknowingly gave indulgence to the corruptions of Mamun and his associates, the statement read.

 In the brief statement, Rahman also sought forgiveness from God, his family and his partymen, describing how he shared the illegal income of Mamun deposited in foreign banks, the paper reported.

 He said Mamun had kept him as a partner verbally in different businesses under his business house and siphoned off parts of his illegal income to a foreign bank, giving him a supplementary debit card to be used whenever required. He said Mamun regularly gave him money to bear his political expenses.

 Rahman was initially charged with minor corruption and extortion cases but is believed to have siphoned off a large sum of money outside Bangladesh. The interim government has sought UN assistance in recovering millions of dollars siphoned off during the BNP regime.

 The Manovjamin report came amid speculation that Rahmans younger brother Arafat Rahman Koko, also a businessman, could be arrested on graft charges.

 The interim government last week declined to allow Koko to go abroad with his mother leading to a last minute cancellation of Khaledas scheduled Singapore visit. Media reports said she had refused to leave the country without her younger son.

 EC proposal

 Bangladeshs election commission has proposed introducing a system under which voters can cast no votes in polls allowing them to express lack of confidence in candidates of their constituency, as the interim government promised a total reform to clean politics, the Daily Star newspaper reported.

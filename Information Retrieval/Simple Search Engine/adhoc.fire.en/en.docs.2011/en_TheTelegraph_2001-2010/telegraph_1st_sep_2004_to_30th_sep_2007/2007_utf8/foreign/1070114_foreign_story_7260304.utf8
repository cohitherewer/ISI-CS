 Doomsday Clock to move ahead

 Washington, Jan. 13 (Reuters): The keepers of the Doomsday Clock plan to move its hands forward next Wednesday to reflect what they call worsening nuclear and climate threats to the world.

 The symbolic clock, maintained by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, currently is set at seven minutes to midnight, with midnight marking global catastrophe. The group did not say in which direction the hands would move. But in a news release previewing an event next Wednesday, they said the change was based on worsening nuclear, climate threats to the world.

 The clock was last pushed forward by two minutes to seven minutes to midnight in 2002 amid concerns about the proliferation of nuclear, biological and other weapons and the threat of terrorism. When it was created by the magazines staff in 1947, it was initially set at seven minutes to midnight and has moved 17 times since then.

 Beastly love

 Memphis, Feb. 11 (AP): As first dates go, this one did not end well. A male polar bear who was trying to court a female apparently pushed her over the edge of a 14-foot drop while playing.

 Cranbeary, the 5-year-old female, had surgery yesterday to insert two steel plates and 26 screws to repair a broken leg. Payton, the 3-year-old male, is on loan from an Illinois zoo as part of a breeding programme. This may be both the bears first romance, a zoo official said.

 Kiss record

 Manila (AP): More than 6,000 couples kissed simultaneously in Manila with organisers of the event claiming to have set a new world record.

 Organisers of the annual pre-Valentines Day celebration said they broke the record held by Hungary, where 5,875 couples kissed simultaneously in 2005. With fireworks, confetti, a giant TV screen, and red balloons as the backdrop, couples locked lips and hugged for 10 seconds following the midnight countdown outside a Manila mall on Saturday. 

 unofficial tally showed 6,124 couples kissed simultaneously.

 Egg spill 

 Washington (AP): Drivers on their way to breakfast in northern Virginia on Saturday found it all over the road after nearly 165,000 eggs spilled out of an overturned tractor-trailer on the Capital Beltway. 

 It looked like a large omelette, said driver Michael Karbonski. 

 The tractor-trailer crashed into a guard rail just after midnight, spilling its runny load. The truck driver fled before police arrived.

 Anti-piracy Labradors strike in Malaysia

 Kuala Lumpur, March 31 (AP): It was a lucky day for Lucky and Flo.

 The two Labradors who have been deployed to sniff out counterfeit DVDs in Malaysias anti-movie piracy crackdown, spent hours in a fruitless search of three premises in Kuala Lumpur today.

 But as the dogs were being taken back home, their handlers noticed two video shops and decided to go in on a whim, said Nor Hayati Yahaya of the Motion Picture Association of America, an industry watchdog.

 Soon, the dogs had unearthed 150,000 pirated DVDs worth 1.5 million ringgit (US$430,000; euro330,000) in the second such success in one month, she said.

 It was quite a lucky break for Lucky and Flo, said Nor Hayati, the country manager for MPAA, the US-based organisation that sponsored the dogs and loaned them to the Malaysian government.

 The dogs, which began sniffing out disc shipments at Malaysias main airport on March 13, won acclaim when they travelled south to Johor state, helping officials uncover 1 million pirated DVDs, CDs and computer game discs worth US$2.8 million (euro2.1 million) in an office complex on March 19.

 Since then they have been kept under high security following threats and a reported bounty on their heads placed by piracy syndicates. 

 But the threats are not going to prevent the dogs from doing their job, said Nor Hayati.

 We move them around (to keep them safe). They are in a very secure place and we plan to do these raids every day with Lucky and Flo, she said.

 She said the day started with a raid on a factory that turned out to be counterfeit beer warehouse. Malaysian government officials and MPAA officials then moved to two other locations, one of which turned out to be an abandoned DVD duplicating centre in the Damansara neighbourhood.

 On their way back, the officers noticed two video shops in uptown Damansara, but couldnt find any contraband there. But persistence by the dogs paid off and they located hidden rooms at the back of the two shops where a total of 50,000 discs were found, Nor Hayati said.

 It was not clear if any arrests were made.

 Malaysia is among the worlds main producers and exporters of pirated discs, the US government and the MPAA have said. 

 According to the Malaysian government, 5 million discs were seized in more than 2,000 raids nationwide last year, and 780 people were arrested.

 The MPAA says Lucky and Flos work in this Southeast Asian country is the first time authorities anywhere in the world have used dogs to detect contraband discs. 

 Malaysian officials have said they will consider training their own canines to perform similar tasks.

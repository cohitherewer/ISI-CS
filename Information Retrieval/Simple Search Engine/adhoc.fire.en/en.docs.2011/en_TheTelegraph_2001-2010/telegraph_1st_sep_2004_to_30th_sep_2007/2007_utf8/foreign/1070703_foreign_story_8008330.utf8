 Woman with scarf barred from court

 Valdosta (Georgia), July 2 (AP): A Muslim woman who wanted to contest a speeding ticket says she was denied access to a courtroom in georgia last week for wearing a head scarf. 

 Aniisa Karim, 20, said she was stopped after entering Valdostas municipal court building on Tuesday and told she would not be permitted to enter the courtroom wearing her scarf. 

 I said: No, Im Muslim ... I wear this for religious reasons and if you dont allow me in the courtroom with my scarf on, basically you are violating my civil rights and my right to a free religion, Karim told the Valdosta Daily Times. Karim said they would not let her in for homeland security reasons, and that allowing her would show disrespect to Judge Vernita Lee Bender. 

 Karim said she offered to walk through a metal detector and allow officers to use a handheld metal detector to scan the scarf. 

 In a letter to a Georgia attorney general Thurbert Baker, the Council on American-Islamic relations asks Baker to take appropriate action to ensure that the legal, religious and civil rights of Georgians of all faiths be maintained.

 Baker and the Valdosta municipal court could not be reached. 

 Barring Karim from the courtroom violated Georgias code of conduct for judges and the 1964 Civil Rights Act which guarantees access to public facilities. 

 Karim said she decided not tochallenge the speeding ticket and pay the $168 fine.

 Brown, Bush unite to quell cooling ties

 Camp David (Maryland), July 30 (Reuters): President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown showed a united front on Iraq and promoting West Asia peace today, trying to quell suggestions of a cooling in trans-Atlantic ties.

 After a spate of reports that the new British leader would seek to distance himself from Bush and withdraw from Iraq, both men were keen to show at their first meeting they could strike up a strong bond. Brown gave no promises on how long Britain would maintain its forces in Iraq, saying only that a decision to hand over control for security in Basra province to Iraqi forces would be based on military advice.

 There is no doubt in my mind that Gordon Brown understands that failure in Iraq would be a disaster for the security of our own countries, Bush said at a joint news conference after their meeting at the secluded presidential retreat. He said his relationship with Brown would bea constructive and strategic.

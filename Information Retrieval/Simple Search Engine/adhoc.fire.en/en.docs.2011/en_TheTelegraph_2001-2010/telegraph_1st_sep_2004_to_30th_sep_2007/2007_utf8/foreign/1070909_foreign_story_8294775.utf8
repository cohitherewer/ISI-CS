 Embrace Islam, says Osama

 Washington, Sept. 8: Osama bin Laden has urged Americans to convert to Islam in the first video message from the al Qaida leader for three years, but issued no clear threat of attack as the September 11 anniversary approaches.

 Bin Laden addresses the American people directly, saying: I invite you to embrace Islam in order to achieve their desire to stop the war in Iraq and show warmongering major corporations that you have lost confidence in your democratic system.

 Then, he said: They will run after you to please you and achieve what you want to steer you away from Islam.

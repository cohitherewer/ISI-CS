The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 EU pat for Bangla govt

 Dhaka, May 6 (Reuters): A group of European Union lawmakers has praised the efforts of Bangladeshs army-backed interim government to fight widespread corruption, but said it must lift the emergency imposed in January and hold national elections.

 We appreciate the initiatives taken by the caretaker government of Bangladesh to fight corruption, restore the order and reform the institutions, including political parties, the lawmakers said in a statement.

 But the government must withdraw the emergency imposed in the wake of widespread political violence as soon as possible and arrange to hold parliamentary elections, the lawmakers said.

 For the sake of democracy, we urge the caretaker government of Bangladesh to urgently lift the state of emergency, which... according to the Constitution, can run for a maximum of three months, the statement signed by 14 lawmakers said.

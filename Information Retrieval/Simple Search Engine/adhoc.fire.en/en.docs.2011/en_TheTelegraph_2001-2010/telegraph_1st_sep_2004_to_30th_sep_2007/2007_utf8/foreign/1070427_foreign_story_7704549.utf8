 Congress backs Iraq pullout plan

 Washington, April 26 (Reuters): In an unprecedented slap at President George W. Bushs war policy, the US Congress today approved legislation that links withdrawal of combat troops to paying for the war, ensuring a certain veto.

 Nonetheless, by a vote of 51-46, the Senate joined the House of Representatives in backing the hotly contested bill that would provide about $100 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan this year while setting a deadline to withdraw US forces over the next 11 months.

 It was the first time the Congress, controlled by Democrats since January, defied the President in more than four years since the conflict began. 

 Bush has repeatedly warned he will not accept surrender dates for the war and there is little doubt he will reject the bill when it is sent to him next week.

 The troops had the courage and the strength to win the war, but the President has not had the wisdom to win the peace, said Democratic Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, who called for a new direction in Iraq.

 Democrats, however, are unlikely to see the effort to defy Bush succeed because they do not think they have two-thirds support in Congress to overturn a presidential veto.

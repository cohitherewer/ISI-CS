 Los Angeles, June 26: Paris Hilton was released from jail this morning after serving a three-week sentence in a case that roiled political waters with charges of hypocrisy and favouritism.

 A throng of paparazzi and reporters enveloped Hilton as she departed from the Century Regional Detention Center in Lynwood about 15 minutes after midnight, marking the official end to her 23-day jail stay for violating probation on an alcohol-related reckless driving conviction.

 Hilton was wearing jeans and a white top and green jacket. Her mother and father had pulled up to the front of the facility in a black Escalade to pick up their daughter. 

 Paris Hilton sauntered down the brick walkway, smiling and waving a few times and saying Hi. She got into the waiting vehicle as it was swarmed by photographers.

 A police spokesman Steve Whitmore said Hilton thanked the guards, nurses and other staff on her way out. Whitmore said Hilton stayed in the medical ward at the facility. He described her as demure and friendly and relieved to be through with the sentence.

 She has fulfilled her obligation. Its now completed, Whitmore said.

 The case of the multi-millionairess generated public outrage when, just days into her sentence, LA county sheriff Lee Baca released her to home detention, saying she was inexplicably deteriorating from an undisclosed medical condition.

 Judge Michael T. Sauer, who imposed Hiltons 45-day county jail sentence, held a hearing and ordered the heiress back to jail

 The dramatic and tearful June 7 court session concluded with the star of The Simple Life crying Mom! Mom! its not right before being ushered out of the courtroom.

 Baca said he would abide by Sauers ruling. But he questioned the judges decision, saying that the sheriff was in charge of the jail system and that Hilton had received a hasher sentence than most inmates receiving time for comparable violations.

 Since 2002, most LA County jail inmates serve only a small percentage of their terms behind bars because of jail overcrowding.

 An examination by The Times of seven years worth of sentencing data showed that Hiltons 23-day jail stay was more than five times the average than served since 2002 by those serving time for similar charges.

 But that fact did little to quiet critics, including the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, who noted that the sheriff had cited Hiltons medical condition not overcrowding as the justification for her release.

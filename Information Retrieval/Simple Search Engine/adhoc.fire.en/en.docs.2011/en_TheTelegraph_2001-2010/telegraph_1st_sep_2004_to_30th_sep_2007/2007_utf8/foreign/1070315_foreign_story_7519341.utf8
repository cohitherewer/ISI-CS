 US puts off key talks

 Islamabad, March 14 (PTI): 

 The US has once again put off the second round of its broad-based 

 strategic dialogue with Pakistan to be held in Islamabad 

 this month.

 The talks between under secretary for political affairs Nicholas Burns and Pakistan foreign secretary Riaz Mohammad Khan was postponed as Burns was busy, the Dawn newspaper said.

 The talks were started during President Bushs visit to Pakistan last year.

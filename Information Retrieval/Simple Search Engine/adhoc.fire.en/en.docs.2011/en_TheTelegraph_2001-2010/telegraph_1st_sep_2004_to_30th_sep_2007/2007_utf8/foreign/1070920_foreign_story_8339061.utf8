 Judge grants OJ bail in robbery case

 Las Vegas, Sept. 19 (Reuters): O.J. Simpson was expected to be freed from a Las Vegas jail after a judge granted the former American football star $125,000 bail on charges he took part in an armed robbery of his own sports memorabilia. 

 Simpson, who was acquitted of killing his ex-wife and her friend in 1995 in a sensational double-murder trial that left his reputation in tatters, did not enter a plea to charges of armed robbery, assault and kidnapping during a brief hearing before a Las Vegas judge.

 A subdued and clearly weary Simpson, 60, came to court handcuffed and shackled at the waist in blue jail garb and said Yes sir, in a raspy voice when asked by district judge Joe Bonaventure if he understood the charges.

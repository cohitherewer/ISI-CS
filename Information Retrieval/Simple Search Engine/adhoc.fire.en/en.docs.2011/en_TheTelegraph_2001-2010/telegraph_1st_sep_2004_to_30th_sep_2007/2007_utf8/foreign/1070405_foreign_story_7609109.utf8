 BA Europes top luggage loser

 DAVID MILLWARD

 London, April 4: British Airways was named and shamed yesterday as the carrier which lost more bags than any of its European rivals.

 As millions of passengers prepare to leave Britain for one of the busiest holiday weekends of the year, BAs record was highlighted in a survey by the Association of European Airlines.

 It showed that BA mislaid 23 bags per 1,000 passengers last year, two more than the carrier in second place, TAP Air Portugal and nearly five more than Lufthansa.

 A BA spokesman admitted that its performance had not been acceptable, but said the problems had been triggered by a 25 per cent rise in the number of bags being checked into the hold after curbs were imposed on the amount of luggage passengers could take on board in August. 

 Its difficulties were exacerbated by the fog which engulfed Heathrow in the days leading up to Christmas.

 According to the Air Transport Users Council, the consumer watchdog, 5.6 million bags were mishandled last year by 24 European carriers. The list does not include a number of no-frills airlines such as easyJet and Ryanair.

 While 85 per cent of mishandled bags are normally reunited with their owners within 48 hours, more than a million take more than two days to be returned and some are never found.

 When we hand our suitcases over to the airline at check-in we should be able to expect that they will arrive with us at our destination airport, a spokesman for the council said. 

 If they do not, airlines are usually able to track them down and get them back to us eventually.

 Bank chief race

 Washington, May 25 (Reuters): Four key US congressional leaders urged the Bush administration to consider non-Americans to head the World Bank, saying the best nominee to heal rifts at the institution could come from anywhere.

 The Democratic chairmen of four House of Representatives committees said in a letter to US President George W. Bush that he should scour a global pool of candidates to replace Paul Wolfowitz, who resigned last week amid an uproar over a pay raise he authorised for his companion.

 There has been much discussion of whether or not the nominee should or must be an American. We think that misses the point, read the letter signed by House Financial Services Committee chairman Barney Frank, House Appropriations Committee chairman David Obey, House Ways and Means chairman Charles Rangel and House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Tom Lantos said in a letter dated May 24 and released today.

 Bush, who has delegated the task of choosing a replacement for Wolfowitz to US treasury secretary Henry Paulson, has said he wants an American to fill the post. The US has traditionally appointed the World Bank president.

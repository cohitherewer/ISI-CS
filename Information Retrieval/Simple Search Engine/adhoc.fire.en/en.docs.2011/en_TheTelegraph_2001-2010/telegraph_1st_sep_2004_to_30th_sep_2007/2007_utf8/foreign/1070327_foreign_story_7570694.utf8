 Anna died of accidental overdose

 No foul play

 Dania Beach (Florida), March 26 (AP): Former Playboy Playmate Anna Nicole Smith died of an accidental overdose of a sleeping medication and other drugs after she was found unresponsive at a hotel, Florida authorities said today.

 Broward county medical examiner Joshua Perper said Smith died of combined drug intoxication with the sleeping medication chloral hydrate as the major factor. Smith was taking a lengthy list of other medications, including methadone for pain, he said. Chloral hydrate is a sedative used to treat insomnia and alcohol withdrawal, relieve anxiety and ease post-surgery pain. 

 Perper said Smith had been on several antidepressant and anti-anxiety drugs prior to her death.

 We found nothing to indicate any foul play, said Chief Charlie Tiger of the Seminole, Florida, police department. Perper said the detailed autopsy also showed no evidence of disease. Smith, 39, was found unresponsive on February 8 in her room at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood.

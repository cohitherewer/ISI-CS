 Ethics breach rap on expensive Wolfowitz

 Wolfowitz and Riza: Promotion problems 

 Washington, April 29: World Bank officials investigating Paul Wolfowitz have concluded that he did breach ethics rules when he helped engineer a promotion and a pay rise for his girlfriend.

 The preliminary conclusions of the special panel of the banks board will intensify the campaign by Wolfowitzs critics to force him to resign as president.

 Their draft report has found that the former US deputy secretary of defence and architect of the Iraq war flouted World Bank regulations on employment contracts and ethics and had undermined the reputation of the bank when he secured Shaha Riza a $60,000 (30,000) pay rise, according to a leak to The Washington Post. Bank insiders say that the committee is still deciding whether to call explicitly for his resignation.

 Wolfowitz and Riza are to appear before the committee today, after which the banks full board could vote on his fate.

 But his critics appeared to be choreographing moves to force him out even before an European Union-US summit in Washington today, at which US President George W. Bush will appear alongside Germanys chancellor, Angela Merkel, one of Wolfowitzs leading critics.

 Opponents have stepped up pressure by revealing that Wolfowitz is costing the World Bank $5 million a year in personal security because he is such a prominent target for terrorists.

 A senior bank source told The Sunday Telegraph: Its a huge sum. We shouldnt have to be paying to protect him. A former senior employee added: When his predecessor, Jim Wolfensohn, went on foreign trips, even to the Middle East, he was invariably met by the local country office driver, who would pick him up in a battered Volvo. Now, everywhere Wolfowitz goes he has to be accompanied by personal protection people.

 Internal critics say that Wolfowitzs appointment has endangered the security of other bank staff. The former employee said. His mere presence puts other people at risk.

 Wolfowitzs decision to open an office in Iraq is also blamed for inflating the security bill. An anti-corruption specialist whose organisation works closely with the bank said: It costs a fortune. The staff sit in the green zone in Baghdad. They have to go everywhere by helicopter and they have a private security company to protect them.

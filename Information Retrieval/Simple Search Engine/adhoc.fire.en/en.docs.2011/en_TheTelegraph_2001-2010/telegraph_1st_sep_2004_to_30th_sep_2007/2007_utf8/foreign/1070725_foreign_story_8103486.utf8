 Scientists close to cure for Alzheimers 

 REBECCA SMITH

 London, July 24: Doctors have moved a step nearer to finding a cure for Alzheimers and reversing damage already caused by the disease, it was announced yesterday.

 A team in Scotland have developed a chemical that can prevent the disease from killing brain cells, which causes memory loss and other symptoms.

 Although it is likely to be several years before the compound can be developed into a drug for use in humans, campaigners described the breakthrough as exciting. Researchers at the University of St Andrews, working with scientists in America, developed man-made compounds capable of blocking a nerve cell interaction known to lead to symptoms of the disease.

 In the very early stages of Alzheimers, a toxic protein called amyloid builds up in nerve cells and kills them. It then moves out of the cells and collects in clumps known as senile plaques. The amyloid latches on to an enzyme called Amyloid Beta Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ABAD) and switches it off.

 The researchers at St Andrews developed a three-dimensional shape of ABAD to understand how amyloid attaches itself. They were then able to develop a chemical decoy called a peptide which attracted the amyloid to stick to it instead of the ABAD.

 It also caused some amyloid to decouple from ABAD where it was already attached and link up with the peptide instead. Some symptoms of learning problems and memory loss improved in mice.

 Dr Frank Gunn-Moore, a senior lecturer at the universitys school of biology said: We have shown that it is possible to reverse some of the signs associated with Alzheimers disease. Our research holds a possible key for the treatment of Alzheimers disease.

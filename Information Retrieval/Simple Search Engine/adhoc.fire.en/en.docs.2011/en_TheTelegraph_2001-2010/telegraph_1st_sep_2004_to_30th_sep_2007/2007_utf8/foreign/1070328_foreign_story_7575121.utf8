 Healthy pizza

 New York, March 27 (Reuters): Cooking whole wheat pizza crust at slightly higher temperatures, for just a bit longer, can substantially pump up its antioxidant content, according to new study results presented at the 233rd annual meeting of the American Chemical Society.

 This is something people can really do at home, Dr Liangli Lucy Yu of the University of Maryland said.

 Higher temperatures and longer cooking and fermentation times increase wheats antioxidant content because more nutrients are released from the wheats bran coating.

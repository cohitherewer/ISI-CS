 Kylie flu hits Britain show

 London, Jan. 14 (AP): Australian singer Kylie Minogue was forced to cut short a performance on her comeback following treatment for breast cancer because she was suffering from flu, her publicist said.

 The London-based diva managed to perform only half of a scheduled two-and-a-half-hour concert yesterday evening in Manchester, northern England, spokesman John Bills said.

 Several members of the crew, the tour manager and Kylie (in picture) have been suffering from flu but she didnt want to let anyone down. She wanted to try to get through the show, but had to cut it short, Bills said.

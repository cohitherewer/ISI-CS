 In trouble again

 Los Angeles, May 27: Hard-partying actress Lindsay Lohan was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving yesterday after the rehab veteran crashed her Mercedes convertible in Beverly Hills shortly before dawn.

 Lohan, 20, who could face more charges, was slightly injured after she lost control of her car travelling west on Sunset Boulevard about 5.30 am, Beverly Hills police said. The car ended up striking a curb and shrubbery. Two other people in the 2005 Mercedes SL65 were not hurt.

 The Georgia Rule and Mean Girls star left the scene of the crash and was taken by an unidentified associate to Century City Doctors Hospital, Lt Mitch McCann said. 

 McCann initially said police found a substance believed to be cocaine in Lohans car, but later clarified the substance was found during the investigation. 

 Officers responding to a 911 call tracked down and arrested Lohan at the hospital on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol and released her for treatment of a chest injury, McCann said.

 Jolie plays a mighty role

 Angelina Jolie: Tough task

 New York, April 30 (AP): Angelina Jolie, who portrays the widow of slain Wall Street Journal newspaper reporter Daniel Pearl in A Mighty Heart, found it tough to film a scene in which Mariane Pearl is told of her husbands death.

 I had to express the worst time in her life and the moment when she received the worst information of her life, Jolie, 31, tells Glamour magazine in its June issue, on news stands on May 8. 

 It became the worst acting day of my life and really, the hardest thing Ive ever done.

 A Mighty Heart, directed by Michael Winterbottom, is based on Pearls account of her husbands abduction and murder in Pakistan in 2002 while researching a story on Islamic militancy.

 Dan Futterman plays Daniel Pearl. The movie will be shown at the Cannes Film Festival in May.

 You know, Mariane, youre somebody who has every right to have a lot of anger, Jolie tells Pearl, who was also interviewed for the Glamour article. And the fact that you take a deep breath and stand up with a very clear voice of tolerance and dialogue thats why I wanted to do the film.

 Well, that kind of self-control hasnt been easy for me, replies Pearl, who was five months pregnant with her son, Adam, when she learned of her husbands fate.

 Her first reaction was to grab an AK-47 from one of the guards. If they had brought a person who was guilty (of Pearls murder) to the house, I would have shot him, she says.

 But then I would have destroyed everything Danny believed in, and everything we did as a couple and I couldnt do that. Putting that gun down was my biggest act of courage.

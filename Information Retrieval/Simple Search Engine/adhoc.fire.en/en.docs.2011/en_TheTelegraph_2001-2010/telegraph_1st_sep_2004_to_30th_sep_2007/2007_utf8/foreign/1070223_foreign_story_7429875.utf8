 Orlando Bloom goes green

 Los Angeles, Feb. 22 (AP): Orlando Bloom says hes building his house in London with the environment in mind.

 Its as green as I can make it, Bloom said yesterday at a pre-Oscar party benefiting the environmental organisation Global Green USA and its efforts to combat global climate change.

 Its got solar panels on the roof, energy efficient light bulbs newer technology basically that is environmentally friendly, he said after arriving at the event in a plug-in hybrid vehicle.

 Not everyone can live a totally green lifestyle, Bloom said, but they can start by unplugging their cellphone chargers or turning off their TV when not in use.

 It doesnt have to be overwhelming, there are simple things we can do, he said.

 The event also drew celebrities such as Penelope Cruz, Chevy Chase, James Blunt and members of Maroon 5. 

 It kicked off a campaign to shuttle celebrities to Oscar-related events in environmentally friendly cars.

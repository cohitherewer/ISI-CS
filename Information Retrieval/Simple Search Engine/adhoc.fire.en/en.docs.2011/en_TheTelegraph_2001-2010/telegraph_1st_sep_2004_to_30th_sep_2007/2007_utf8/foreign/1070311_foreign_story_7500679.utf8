The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Lanka exodus

 Colombo, March 10 (AP): Heavy fighting in rebel-held parts of Sri Lanka has forced thousands more civilians to flee their homes in the past two days, leaving more than 100,000 displaced in one eastern district, the Red Cross said today.

 Battles have escalated in recent days between government troops and separatist Tamil Tiger rebels in parts of the countrys east, longtime rebel strongholds, after a lull of few weeks. 

 International Committee of the Red Cross official Davide Vignati said there are about 105,000 displaced people now in refugee camps in the eastern district of Batticaloa the largest number of displaced people in one district.

 The latest wave has added to tens of thousands of displaced people who have arrived in government-controlled areas since November, and are living in flimsy tents. The Tigers have been fighting since 1983 to create a separate state in the north and east for the countrys ethnic Tamil minority, following decades of discrimination by the Sinhalese majority. Renewed fighting has left about 4,000 more people dead and at least 200,000 displaced in Sri Lanka since late 2005, when the ceasefire faltered.

 Sharon top of the flops

 Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct 2

 Los Angeles, Feb. 25 (AP): Sharon Stone should have trusted her first Basic Instinct and left it alone, according to voters of the Razzies, which mocks the worst of Hollywood.

 Basic Instinct 2 won four Razzies yesterday, including worst picture and worst actress for Stone. 

 The Razzies short for Golden Raspberry Award mock what are thought to be Hollywoods worst, and are held on the eve of the Academy Awards.

 The Wayans brothers comedy Little Man placed second with three Razzies, including shared prizes by Shawn and Marlon Wayans for worst actor and worst screen couple. A follow-up to Stones career-making 1992 hit, Basic Instinct 2 revived her femme-fatale predator for a murder thriller set in London, with relatively unknown British actor David Morrissey inheriting the victims mantle from Michael Douglas, who did not return for the sequel.

 Razzies founder John Wilson said that while Stone still looked good in her late 40s, the movie had no other reason to exist.

 Yes, she still has some excuse to drop her robe, but the dialogue, the story, the overall attitude of the character is cartoon-like, he said. You have to sort of wonder, is she vamping the movie or does she think shes giving a serious performance?

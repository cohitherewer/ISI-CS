 Curbs on AQ Khan eased

 Sensitive case 

 Islamabad, July 2 (AP): Authorities have eased the virtual house arrest imposed on Abdul Qadeer Khan, the disgraced scientist who sold Pakistans nuclear secrets to Iran, North Korea and Libya, officials said today.

 In his first public comment in years, Khan said he was recovering from treatment for cancer, but declined to discuss other topics.

 Khan, the architect of Pakistans nuclear programme, confessed in 2004 to heading an international ring of smugglers that supplied sensitive technology to Iran and others. President Pervez Musharraf pardoned him while confining him to his villa in Islamabad. The house is kept under close guard and he has been permitted few visitors. However, two senior government officials said the restrictions were eased several months ago and he can now meet friends and relatives either at his home or elsewhere in Pakistan.

 There were several restrictions on Dr Abdul Qadir Khan, many of which have been eased. He is virtually a free citizen, said one of the officials, who is attached to the nuclear programme.

 However, the second official said Khan was only allowed to meet associates and relatives on a list approved by officials. His freedom of movement was still curbed because of security concerns, according to the officials.

 Foreign ministry spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam said there has been no change in Khans status. Asked whether the government had relaxed restrictions on Khan, Aslam said: There is no change in his status. He continues to lead a quiet life with his family. He meets his friends. He talks to people. This was happening even before the news reports, she said.

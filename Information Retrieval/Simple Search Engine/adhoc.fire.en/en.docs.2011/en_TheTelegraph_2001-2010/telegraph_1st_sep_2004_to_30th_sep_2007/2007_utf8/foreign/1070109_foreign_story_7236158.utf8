The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Elvis fans all shook up

 Yorba Linda (California), Jan. 8 (AP): The meeting between two of the most improbable cultural icons of the 1970s lasted all of 30 minutes, but it has fascinated the nation for years.

 A photo of a cloaked and bejewelled Elvis Presley solemnly shaking hands with a grim-faced President Richard Nixon remains the number one requested document from the National Archives, nearly four decades after the secret meeting took place on December 21, 1970.

 Now, on what would be the Kings 72nd birthday, the Richard Nixon Presidential Library amp; Birthplace is giving the curious public a good, long look at the relics of the coming together of The King and The President and its got Elvis fans all shook up.

 The free exhibit includes the outfit Elvis wore (a black velvet overcoat, a gold-plated belt and black leather boots); Nixons outfit (a grey woollen suit, tie and black shoes); letters; and a .45-calibre Colt revolver that Elvis gave to Nixon. Bud Krogh, Nixons former deputy counsel who set up the meeting that day 36 years ago, says: The king of rock and the President of the US shaking hands in the Oval Office doesnt compute for a lot of people.

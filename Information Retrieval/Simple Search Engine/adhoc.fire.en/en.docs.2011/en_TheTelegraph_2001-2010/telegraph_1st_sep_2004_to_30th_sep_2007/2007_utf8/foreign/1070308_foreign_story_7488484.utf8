 Libby verdict to haunt Bush

 Washington, March 7 (Reuters): A top White House aides guilty verdict in an investigation tied to the Iraq war is likely to haunt President George W. Bush for the rest of his term, experts say.

 Speculation over a possible pardon of Vice-President Dick Cheneys former chief of staff, Lewis Scooter Libby, began almost immediately after the verdict was announced yesterday. Plans for an appeal as well as a separate civil suit promise to keep the case in the news for most if not all of the 22 months Bush has left in office.

 Libby remains free as his lawyers seek a new trial or appeal his conviction.

 The outcome also raised more questions about Cheney, prompting White House spokesman Tony Snow today to deny the case would affect his influence. 

 The Vice-President still remains a trusted aide. The Vice-President is somebody upon whose counsel the President depends, he said. Colby College government professor Anthony Corrado said the case would affect Bushs ability to get things done.

 Its an outcome thats going to further diminish the Presidents standing on Capitol Hill and make it more difficult for the administration to press its cause in its final two years here, Corrado said.

 University of Virginia politics professor Larry Sabato added: The biggest problem Bush has is Iraq, and this reinforces his problems.

 The high-profile trial revealed the inner workings of the White House and became the latest setback for the Bush administrations war policy.

 No one is likely to face criminal charges for actually leaking CIA secrets; Libby was found guilty of lying and obstructing a probe into the affair. 

 Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald said he didnt plan to charge anyone else in the case of Valerie Plame, the CIA operative identified after her husband accused the Bush administration of manipulating intelligence on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction to build its case for war.

 I lost Cruise baby, says Nicole

 SOPHIE BORLAND 

 Desperate

 London, Sept. 5: Nicole Kidman has revealed that she lost a baby shortly after marrying Tom Cruise. 

 The Hollywood actress, now 40, suffered a miscarriage in the early years of her marriage to the Hollywood star. 

 At the time she was so desperate to have children that she and Cruise adopted a baby girl called Bella, now 14, less than two years later. They then went on to adopt Conor, 12, and both children have been living with Cruise since the couple divorced in 2001. 

 The star, who is now married to Keith Urban, 39, a country and western singer, also said she had been longing for children since she was 17 years old. In an interview with Vanity Fair magazine, she said: From the minute Tom and I were married, I wanted to have babies. 

 And we lost a baby early on, so that was really very traumatic. And thats when it came that we would adopt Bella. Theres a complicated background to that, given that I never speak much about many things. One day maybe that story will be told.

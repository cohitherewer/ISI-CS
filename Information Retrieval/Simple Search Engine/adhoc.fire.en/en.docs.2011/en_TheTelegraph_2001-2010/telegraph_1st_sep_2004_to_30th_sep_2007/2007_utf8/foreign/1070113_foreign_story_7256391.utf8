 Embassy blast

 Athens, Jan. 12 (Reuters): Suspected Left guerrillas fired a rocket-propelled grenade at the US embassy in Athens today in the boldest attack staged by Left-wing militants in years.

 The blast shattered windows and woke up nearby residents at 5:58 am (0358 GMT) but no one was hurt.

 The grenade was launched just across the street from the embassy building, which is surrounded by a 9-feet-high steel fence, and authorities were dealing with it as a serious act of violence.

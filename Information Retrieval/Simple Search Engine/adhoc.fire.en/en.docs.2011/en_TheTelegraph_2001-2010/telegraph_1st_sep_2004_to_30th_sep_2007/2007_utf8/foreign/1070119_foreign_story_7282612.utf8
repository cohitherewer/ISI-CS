 Buchwald dead

 Washington, Jan. 18 (Reuters): Pulitzer Prize-winning satirist Art Buchwald, who entered a hospital last year to die but survived to write a humourous, yet sobering, book about facing death, has died at age 81, his son said today.

 Buchwalds six-decade career began with chronicling Parisian night life before he moved to the US to lampoon American politics and culture from Washington. He died last night at 11:20 pm. He was at my house, Joel Buchwald said. He said his father, who died of kidney failure, had lived with him for eight years.

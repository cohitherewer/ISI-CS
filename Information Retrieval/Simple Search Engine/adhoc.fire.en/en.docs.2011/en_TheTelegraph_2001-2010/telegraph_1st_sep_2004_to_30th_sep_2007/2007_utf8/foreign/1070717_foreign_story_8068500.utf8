 Judge saves Shambo

 AMIT ROY 

 Shambo the bull

 London,

 July 16: So, Shambo, the bull protected by Hindu monks in Wales, lives to munch another day, given a last-minute stay of execution today by a high court judge in Cardiff. 

 So comprehensive was the judges ruling against the authorities who were determined to slaughter Shambo on health grounds that Justice Hickinbottom now stands in grave danger of being declared an honorary Hindu. 

 The problem with the six-year-old Friesian was that he tested positive for exposure to bovine tuberculosis earlier this year. The context is that over the last few years, millions of cattle, sheep and poultry have had to be killed to tackle diseases that have seriously damaged European farming. 

 Normally, British farmers would not protest if health officials ruled that an animal, which could infect other animals or even humans, needed to be put down as swiftly as possibly to minimise the risk of the contagion being spread. 

 However, Shambo, surrounded by pictures of Krishna and other gods, has been living happily with a group of monks at the Skanda Vale Hindu community in Llanpumsaint, in west Wales. They promised to keep Shambo in isolation for the rest of his life and mounted an effective campaign to stop the slaughter. One or two self-appointed Hindu fundamentalist groups, sensing an ideal opportunity to promote their own agendas, waded in and will now, no doubt, claim a famous victory on behalf of all Hindus. 

 Rather than adopt an aggressive approach, the monks sought a judicial review to overturn the decision to slaughter Shambo that had been made by the Welsh Assembly governments rural affairs minister Jane Davidson.

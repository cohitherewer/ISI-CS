 Ashley Judd now a graduate

 Lexington (Kentucky), May 10 (AP): Ashley Judd is now a graduate of the University of Kentucky.

 The 39-year-old actress received a bachelors degree in French, but it was not clear whether she attended any of Sundays graduation ceremonies, UK spokesman Jay Blanton told the Lexington Herald-Leader newspaper for a story on its website. Judd attended the university from 1986 to 1990, but left one course shy of graduation.

 Blanton said student confidentiality laws prevented him from saying how she finally received her degree.

 In an interview last year, Judd told the newspaper that she would probably take a correspondence course to finish the one class necessary to get a degree. When she left in 1990,correspondence courses were not allowed to count toward graduation.

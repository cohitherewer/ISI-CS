 Hillary donors shift to Obama

 DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK AND ARON PILHOFER

 Disturbing trend 

 Washington, April 16: As Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton seeks to reassemble the Democratic money machine her husband built, some of its major fundraisers have already signed on with Senator Barack Obama. 

 Among the biggest fund-raisers for Obamas campaign are as many as a half-dozen former guests of the Clinton White House. At least two are close enough to the Clintons to have slept in the Lincoln bedroom. 

 At minimum, a dozen were major fundraisers for President Bill Clinton. At least four worked in the administration and one, James Rubin, is a son of a former Clinton treasury secretary, Robert E. Rubin. About two dozen of the top Obama fundraisers have contributed to Hillarys Senate campaigns or political action committee, some as recently as a few months ago.

 A list of Obamas top fund-raisers released yesterday showed the extent to which the Democratic Party establishment, once presumed to back Hillary, has become more fragmented and drifted into her rivals camp, lending the early stages of the Democratic primary campaign the feeling of a family feud. Some of the movement would have been inevitable given Bill Clintons former dominance of the party. 

 The donors helped Obama, a first-term Senator little known outside Illinois four years ago, best Hillary in the first quarter of fund-raising for the Democratic primary by $5.7 million, according to reports filed yesterday with the Federal Election Commission. 

 But her campaign proved it still had the support of some deep pockets. 

 About 5,100 big contributors accounted for about three quarters of the $26 million combined that she raised for the primary and general election, pulling her very slightly ahead of Obama by just $200,000 in total fund-raising for the quarter. And, with $10 million rolling over to her primary campaign from her last Senate race in New York, Hillary was well ahead in cash in the bank.

 Phil Singer, a Clinton campaign spokesman, said the drift of former supporters of Bill and Hillary Clinton to Obama reflected the former Presidents dominance of the party during the 1990s.

 Most Democrats who were politically active in the 1990s had ties to the Clinton administration, and we are pleased to have much of their support today, Singer said.

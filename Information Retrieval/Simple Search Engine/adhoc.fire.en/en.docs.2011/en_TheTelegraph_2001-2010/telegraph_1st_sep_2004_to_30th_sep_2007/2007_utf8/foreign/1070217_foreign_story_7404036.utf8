 Pak police nab 3 bombers

 Karachi, Feb. 16 (Reuters): Pakistani police arrested three al Qaida-linked would-be suicide bombers following a shootout in the southern city of Karachi today, a senior police official said.

 We have recovered a jacket used in suicide bomb attacks, hand grenades and pistols from them, Fayyaz Khan, a senior official in the Crime Investigation Department (CID), said. 

 He said the jacket was fitted with explosives.

 Now we are carrying out raids to arrest 10 more members of this group, he said.

 Khan said the three militants who had been trained in Wana in South Waziristan, a restive tribal region on the border with Afghanistan, and a hotbed of support for the Taliban.

 They have admitted getting training in Wana, and we have also recovered a list of potential targets from them, Khan said, adding that the trainers were fellow Pakistanis, Uzbeks and east Africans.

 Police also recovered a video disc in which an Arabic speaking man explains how to prepare a suicide bomber and how to inflict the maximum number of casualties.

 Khan said the captured men belonged to a faction known as the Qari Zafar group, which had links with the al Qaida and the Taliban had been involved in previous suicide attacks in Pakistan.

 Gisele blames families

 Rio de Janeiro, Jan. 20 (Reuters): Supermodel Gisele Bundchen says weak families are to blame for anorexia not the fashion industry that has been widely criticised for promoting waifish silhouettes.

 I never suffered from this problem (anorexia) because I had a very strong family base. Parents are responsible, not the fashion industry, Bundchen said in yesterdays edition of Globo newspaper. Bundchen, 26, was visiting her native Brazil this week for the Fashion Rio show, which has banned models who are under the age of 16 and has required proof of their good health after the death of a Brazilian model from complications due to starvation last year.

 Bundchen said being a model is a matter of genetics. Everybody knows that the norm in fashion is thin, she said. But excuse me, there are people born with the right genes for this profession. Bundchen said as a child her peers teased her for being skinny with names like Olive Oyl, the gangly character from the Popeye cartoon.

 In fashion I felt accepted ... I never felt lonely because I always relied on my family.

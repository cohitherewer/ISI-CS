 Problem pants

 Washington, June 12 (Reuters): A judge in the US capital pressed a $54 million lawsuit yesterday against a dry cleaning shop which he said violated consumer-protection laws when it lost his pants.

 Roy L. Pearson, an administrative judge for the district of Columbia, told a local court that Custom Cleaners should pay the sum because a satisfaction guaranteed sign deceived consumers who, like him, were dissatisfied with their experience.

 You will search the records of the district of Columbia courts in vain for a case of more egregious or willful misconduct, Pearson told Judge Judith Bartnoff.

 The lawyer for the Korean immigrants who run the dry cleaner said Pearson was looking for a way to resolve his financial difficulties after a divorce. Pearson filed the suit after the cleaners lost his pants in 2005. Jin Chung, Soo Chung and Ki Chung said they located the pants a few days later, but Pearson said they were not his.

 Sick seats

 told nervous passengers travelling with a

 low-cost Spanish airline that nearly half

 the seats on their plane were out of use due

 to a safety problem but it was nothing to

 worry about, a Spanish newspaper reported.

 Pak judge files pleas

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 Islamabad, April 18: Pakistans suspended Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry today filed two petitions in the supreme court challenging the presidential reference against him and the composition of a five-judge panel hearing charges against him.

 Chaudhry, who was suspended on March 9 by President Pervez Musharraf, has also urged the supreme court to stay proceedings of the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) which is probing allegations that the former chief jurist misused his powers by getting his son a lucrative job in the police service. 

 This is for the first time in Pakistans judicial history that a chief justice has filed a petition in the supreme court. 

 Chaudhry, who also appeared before the SJC for the fifth time today, also mentioned Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz in the petition. 

 Chaudhry said he was raising as many as 132 legal questions in his petition. The queries are of great public importance and needed to be settled by the supreme court, he added. These questions relate to competence and constitution of the SJC and as to whether a reference could, at all, be filed, mala fide and collateral purpose of the referring authority and the Prime Minister, unholy haste, illegal suspension, illegal assumption of office by the acting chief justice and independence of judiciary as a whole, the petition said. 

 Even during todays meeting of the council, we argued that the SJC could not hear a reference against the chief justice, Chaudhrys senior counsel Munir A. Malik said.

 Fine Print

 Barbra blend

 London, July 19 (Reuters): Barbra Streisand left fans in Europe crying for more as she neared the end of a tour marked by controversy over high ticket prices, reports of diva behaviour and mixed reviews.

 The 65-year-old star blended old classics and lesser known songs with her trademark banter late yesterday at a concert in London, the final stop of her tour. The crowd hummed along, stood to cheer and shed tears during a night of nostalgia.

 She plays two more nights at the O2 arena on Sunday and next Wednesday, winding up her first tour of the region which many also believe will be her last.

 Toy or thief

 Berlin (Reuters): Armed police went into action in the German city of Wuppertal after a woman reported seeing a masked criminal but having rushed to the scene, they were surprised to find not a crook, but a large stuffed toy. The woman was returning late at night to her car in an indoor car park when she saw the suspected brigand through the window of a parked van, police said on Thursday.

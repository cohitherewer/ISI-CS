 Hubble camera off

 Hubble Space Telescope

Los Angeles, Jan. 30: The newest and most heavily used camera on the Hubble Space Telescope shut down over the weekend and appears to be permanently damaged, Nasa said. 

 Though other cameras on Hubble remain operative, the Advanced Camera for Surveys, which is used to peer back to the earliest and most remote galaxies in the universe, appears to be irreparable and will have to be replaced on the next Hubble servicing mission in September 2008. 

 The camera, installed in 2002, had a five-year designed lifetime, but it is disappointing that it didnt last longer, said Matt Mountain, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute, which operates the telescope. I guess our warranty ran out on us. 

 The camera suffered a breakdown in June and engineers activated its backup electronic circuitry. Apparently, a fuse in the backup short-circuited on Saturday, disabling the device. 

 The camera was by far the most popular instrument on Hubble, which was launched in 1990. An estimated two-thirds of all proposals for Hubble studies involved its use. Its wide field of view made it useful in the search for very distant supernovas, known as Type 1a, which help to explain how the expansion of the universe has been proceeding, said astronomer Mark R. Morris.

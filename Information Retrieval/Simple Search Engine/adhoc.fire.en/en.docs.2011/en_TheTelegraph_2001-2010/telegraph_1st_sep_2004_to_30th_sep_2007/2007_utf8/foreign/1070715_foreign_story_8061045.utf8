 Teens held for plotting school raid

 New York, July 14 (AP): Two teenagers were charged with conspiring to attack a suburban New York high school on the anniversary of the Columbine attacks after a chilling journal and videotape surfaced in which one teen identifies several potential victims by name, authorities said.

 I will start a chain of terrorism in the world, a 15-year-old suspected of planning the assault allegedly wrote in the journal, which led to his arrest. This will go down in history. Take out everyone there. Perfecto.

 Both teens were charged with misdemeanour conspiracy, punishable by up to a year in jail.

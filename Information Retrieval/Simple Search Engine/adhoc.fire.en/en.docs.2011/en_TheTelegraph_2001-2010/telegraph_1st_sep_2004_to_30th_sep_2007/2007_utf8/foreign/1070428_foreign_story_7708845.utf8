 Khaleda plans Mecca trip

 Short pilgrimage

 Dhaka, April 27 (Reuters): Bangladeshs former Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia, once thought to be heading into exile in Saudi Arabia, will go next week to Mecca for religious rites but will return after that, her close associates said today.

 Probably she will perform Umrah (short pilgrimage) haj with most of her family early next month, one associate said. The Saudi embassy has issued them visas for the pilgrimage, he said. Khaleda, the most recent Prime Minister, ventured out of her Dhaka home last night to attend a dinner at her brothers residence, after being in virtual confinement since April 1.

 The countrys army-backed interim government said on Wednesday there were no restrictions on Khaledas movements nor was she being pressed into exile. Local media had earlier reported, quoting Khaleda associates, that she had a cut a deal with the government to go into exile in Saudi Arabia.

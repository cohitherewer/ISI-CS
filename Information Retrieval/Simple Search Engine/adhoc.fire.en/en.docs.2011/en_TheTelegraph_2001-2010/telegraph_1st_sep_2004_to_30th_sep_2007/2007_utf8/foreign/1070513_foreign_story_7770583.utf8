 Bloomberg in presidency bid

 Bloomberg: Confident 

Washington, May 12: Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire businessman and mayor of New York, is building the foundations for an audacious third-party presidential candidacy that would transform the 2008 race for the White House.

 The Daily Telegraph has established that a senior aide to Bloomberg has held three lunch meetings with officials from the Independence Party, during which detailed discussions took place as to how a third-party bid could be launched. 

 Kevin Sheekey, Bloombergs special adviser and chief political strategist, first met Frank MacKay, the New York chairman of the Independence Party, for talks in November at Manhattans Four Seasons hotel. Two lunch meetings took place in quick succession early last month over steak and seafood at the citys well-known Bobby Vans restaurant.

 MacKay declined to confirm or deny whether the meetings had happened but said that he thought Bloomberg would make an excellent candidate.

 Bloomberg, 65, would be likely to run as a social liberal and fiscal conservative with signature issues such as environmentalism and gun control. A centrist Bloomberg candidacy would certainly stir up next years presidential race. Ross Perot, the wealthy businessman who secured 19 per cent of the vote as an independent candidate in 1992, is widely credited with enabling Bill Clinton to defeat George Bush Sr.

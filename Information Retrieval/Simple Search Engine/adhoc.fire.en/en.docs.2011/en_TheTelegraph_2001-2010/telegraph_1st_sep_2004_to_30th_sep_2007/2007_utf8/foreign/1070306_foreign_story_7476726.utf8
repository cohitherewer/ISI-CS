 Overweight boy future

 Connor McCreaddie

 London, March 5 (Reuters): A local authority is due to go to court seeking a care order over an obese eight-year-old boy whom officials had threatened to take away from his family because of concerns about his weight.

 Social workers decided last week to allow Connor McCreaddie, who weighs almost 90 kg, to remain at home with his mother blamed for overfeeding him with junk food. McCreaddies mother says her son will not eat healthy food like fruits and vegetables and had rejected a suggestion that she put a lock on the fridge.

 A judge will consider a care application order brought by North Tyneside Metropolitan Council which said it could not reveal details of what conditions it was seeking because of legal reasons.

 Egyptian charged with spying for Israel

 Cairo, April 17 (Reuters): Egyptian authorities have charged a nuclear engineer at the states Atomic Energy Agency with spying for Israel, along with two fugitive foreigners an Irishman and a Japanese, a government statement said today.

 Mohamed Sayed Saber Ali, 35, took documents from his workplace at Inshas, the site of one of Egypts small research nuclear reactors, and handed them over to his foreign contacts, earning thousands of dollars, the statement said.

 Egyptian security officials arrested Ali on February 18 when he arrived at Cairo airport from one of several trips to Hong Kong, where he had meetings with his contacts, it added. The statement named the Irishman as Brian Peter and the Japanese man as Shiro Izo. They told Ali at one meeting in Hong Kong that they wanted him to work for their company from inside the Atomic Energy Agency, it said.

 The first accused (Ali) said that he understood from the course of this meeting that the company referred to was no more than a front for the activity of Israeli intelligence, it said.

 At a later meeting in Hong Kong in December 2006, Ali gave Peter documents containing secret information about the Atomic Energy Agency and the nuclear reactor at Inshas, it said.

 During his final trip to Hong Kong, in February 2007, Israeli intelligence gave Ali lie detection tests for two days as a condition for him receiving computer software for hacking into the Atomic Energy Agencys computer systems, it added.

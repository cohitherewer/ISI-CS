 Branson brushed off by BA

 London, April 21: In Soviet Russia anyone who fell out of favour with the ruling elite was airbrushed out of history.

 Now it appears British Airways has adopted the same approach towards its corporate nemesis, Sir Richard Branson.

 The Virgin Atlantic chairman, who makes a brief cameo appearance in Casino Royale, the latest James Bond film, is somehow missing from the version shown on British Airways flights.

 In the cinema version, Sir Richard is seen passing through a security arch at Miami airport. However, on BA flights, while he can be seen from the back, the scene when he turns round and faces the camera has gone.

 Even the slightest glimpse of a Virgin plane was enough for the scissors to come out and when it could not be avoided, the distinctive Virgin tail fin has been painted over.

 This is not the first occasion that BA has been sensitive about the appearance of its rival on screen. Scenes filmed in Virgins premium cabin were cut out of The Wedding Date before it was deemed suitable for BA passengers.

 While companies can pay large amounts to place their products on blockbuster films, this did not apply to Sir Richard or his planes in Casino Royale. We were phoned with a request from the films producers to get a plane into Prague, which masqueraded as Miami airport, at very short notice. We were delighted to do so.

 It is understood that the producers had been in prolonged negotiations with BA and only turned to Virgin at a late stage. The decision to cut Sir Richard from the film was taken by BAs in-flight entertainment team, which vets films on grounds of taste before allowing them to be shown.

 The fractious relationship between the airlines dates back to their legal battles on both sides of the Atlantic in the 1990s. After an apparent thaw, hostilities appeared to resume last summer when Virgin was identified as the whistle blower that triggered a price-fixing investigation in Britain.

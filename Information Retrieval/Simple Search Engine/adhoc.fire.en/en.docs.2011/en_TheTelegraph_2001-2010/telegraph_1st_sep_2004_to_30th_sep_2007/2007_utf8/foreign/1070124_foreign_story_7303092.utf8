The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Hopkins feels like a rebel

 Breaking rules

 Park City (Utah), Jan. 23 (Reuters): Hes an Oscar-winning actor with roles such as serial killer Hannibal the cannibal Lecter, but at age 69, Anthony Hopkins said he has arrived at a new, rebellious stage of life directing low-budget art films.

 Hopkins Slipstream, which premiered this weekend at the Sundance Film Festival, marks the veteran actors debut as a first-time filmmaker and is part of a new edition to Sundance called New Frontier where art and cinema collide.

 Yeah, Im a rebel. I want to poke people, not to cause pain, but just make people wake up, Hopkins said late on Sunday. I feel Ive arrived. I feel Im starting anew ... I got a feeling I can be a guerrilla movie director.

 Hopkins said that he has long admired directors who took chances with their films such as John Cassavetes, Roman Polanski, Oliver Stone and Quentin Tarantino. They are directors, he said, who like to mix things up and upset the apple cart of mainstream moviemaking.

 Slipstream puts a new spin on storytelling technique. The film tells of a Hollywood screenwriter, Felix Bonhoffer (played by Hopkins), who begins to confuse his own life with the characters he is creating on the page.

 Audiences are taken on a journey through Bonhoffers mind to see historical events such as the Vietnam War that have shaped his thinking and, as a result, the thinking of his screenplays characters.

 Current events in Bonhoffers life, such as getting pulled over by a police officer, begin to bleed over into his writing, and audiences are never quite sure until the end what is reality and what are simply Bonhoffers thoughts and emotions.

 Hopkins said he wrote Slipstream to challenge audiences to consider the nature of time and space, and how human ideas can manifest themselves in reality. 

 At the Slipstream premiere in front of a packed audience at Sundance, festival director Geoff Gilmore told audiences: It is rare that you get to see a real work of art on film.

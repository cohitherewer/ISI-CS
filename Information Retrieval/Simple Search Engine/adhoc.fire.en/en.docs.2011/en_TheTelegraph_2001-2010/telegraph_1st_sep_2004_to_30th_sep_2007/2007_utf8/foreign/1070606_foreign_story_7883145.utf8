 Ex-geek slams Internet jungle

 Berkeley (California), June 5 (Reuters): Internet culture, often portrayed as the vanguard of progress, is actually a jungle peopled by intellectual yahoos and digital thieves, according to a Silicon Valley entrepreneur-turned-dissenter.

 Andrew Keen, a 47-year-old Briton who founded dot-com era music startup Audiocafe, argues that basic notions of expertise are under assault amid a cultural shift in favour of the amateurism of blogs, MySpace and other popularity-driven sites. Millions and millions of exuberant monkeys... are creating an endless digital forest of mediocrity, Keen writes in a book published today.

 His views have infuriated bloggers and others, especially in Silicon Valley, who argue he is an elitist intellectual, a conservative pining for a return to old ways, and a writer who cannot keep his facts straight.

 The villains in Keens narrative are a pajama army of mostly anonymous writers who spread gossip and scandal, intellectual kleptomaniacs, who search Google to copy others work and the digital thieves of media content in the post-Napster era.

 For a technology industry used to basking in the glow of self-promotion, Keens work is shocking for its unforgiving view of Silicon Valleys utopian aspirations. The book is designed as a grenade, Keen, a native of north London who now lives in California, said at a recent debate with bloggers and journalists in Berkeley. It is not designed to be particularly fair or balanced.

 The title of his polemic, The Cult of the Amateur: How Todays Internet is Killing our Culture, attacks what he calls the cut and paste ethic of Web users, who he says are robbing professionals of their livelihoods.

 The Web allows anyone to post their most intimate thoughts, views or even outright lies, without any editing, under the assumption that the crowd will correct any mistakes. Keen calls for efforts to balance out the Webs powers of instant publishing against societys need for accountability.

 Some of the biggest names in Internet publishing are hitting back against Keen, including video blogger Robert Scoble, media critic Jeff Jarvis, citizen journalism advocate Dan Gillmor and blog pioneer Dave Winer. Jarvis, on his blog BuzzMachine, refers to Keens thinking as Snobs.com.

 But some would-be detractors find themselves sticking up for Keen.

 Clay Shirky, a lecturer on new media technology at New York University, came spoiling for a fight with Keen at a recent online politics conference in New York. Instead, Shirky says he found himself defending Keen.

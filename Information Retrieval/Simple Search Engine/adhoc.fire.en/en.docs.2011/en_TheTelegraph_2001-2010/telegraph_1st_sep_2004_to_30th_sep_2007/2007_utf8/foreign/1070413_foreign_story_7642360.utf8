 Polls before 2008, says leader

 Dhaka, April 12 (AP): Bangladeshs 

 interim leader said today that he hoped new elections in 

 the South Asian nation could take place before the end of 

 2008.

 In a televised address to the nation, Fakhruddin Ahmed said he has no intention of staying in power for a day longer than necessary.

 It was the first clear statement from the government on an election timeframe after President Iajuddin Ahmed declared a state of emergency on January 11 to quell months of violent street protests.

 President Ahmed also cancelled the elections, originally slated for January 22 this year.

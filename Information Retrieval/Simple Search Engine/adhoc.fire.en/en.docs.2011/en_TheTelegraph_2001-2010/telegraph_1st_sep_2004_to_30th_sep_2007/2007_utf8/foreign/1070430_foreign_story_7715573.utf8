 Pak suicide attack follows February alert

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 Peshawar, April 29: As Pakistani investigators moved to identify the suicide bomber who killed 28 and wounded 52 among them interior minister Aftab Khan Sherpao senior intelligence officials said warning of an attack had been issued in February.

 The suicide attack came at the end of a rally Sherpao was addressing in his hometown Charsadda yesterday. 

 Quoting police and intelligence officials in Dera Ismail Khan, the private Online news agency had cautioned on February 25 that 20 would-be suicide bombers, including eight women, had entered the city and could target the district courts and towns in the next 15-20 days. 

 We really have no answer to the people who strap explosives around their body and walk in to imminent death just because somebody has convinced them it is Gods order, a senior intelligence official in Peshawar said after the blast. 

 Home secretary Kamal Shah told a TV channel early today that however tight the security, it could not hold back someone ready to die and kill. 

 D.I. Khan is one of the most populous cities of the North-Western Frontier Province (NWFP) that borders Afghanistan and is the hometown of Maulana Fazlurrehman, the spiritual mentor of Taliban. 

 D.I. Khan is also close to South Waziristan and is a conduit for militants movements as they can easily melt into the local population and fan out to other cities. 

 The province has been in turmoil since early this year; besides regular attacks on army and government officials and installations in the embattled Waziristan region, towns like D.I. Khan, Tank, and Parachinar have witnessed bloody ethnic and political feuds in recent weeks. 

 There has been no claim of responsibility for the bombing. But obvious suspects are Islamic militants who have repeatedly targeted top Pakistani officials, including President Pervez Musharraf, for supporting the US-led war on terror. 

 The attack came a month after the authorities mounted an operation with the help of a tribal army in South Waziristan, where Sherpao and other security officials claimed up to 300 Uzbek militants had been put down. 

 The operation, officials had said, had become inevitable after the Uzbek militants, hiding in some hamlets of South Waziristan, began targeting Pakistan army, intelligence and government officials. 

 During Muharram in January, the Peshawar police chief, deputy inspector-general Abid Ali, and several other police officials fell to suicide attacks, prompting a special meeting in the NWFP capital. 

 The meeting, attended by ISI representatives, had concluded that the militant threat is growing and fast overtaking cities like Peshawar, Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu and Koha. 

 At least nine suicide blasts have rocked Pakistan this year leaving scores of people dead. Two were in Islamabad, where the attackers had chosen the Marriott hotel as their target.

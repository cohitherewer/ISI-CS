 Office politics in Nasa attack 

 Houston, April 22 (Reuters): A mediocre job review led a space engineer to buy a gun, then kill a co-worker he blamed for the appraisal and himself at Nasas Johnson Space Center (JSC), police said yesterday.

 The engineer, Bill Phillips, 60, left rambling notes saying his victim, David Beverly, called him stupid. He exacted his revenge by gunning him down in their Nasa offices on Friday.

 Youre the one thats going to get me fired, police quoted Phillips as saying before he shot Beverly, 62, in the leg and chest.

 As police closed in, they said Phillips shot himself in the head.

 The incident, coming on the heels of last Mondays shooting rampage at Virginia Tech university that left 32 people dead, again raised the issue of US gun violence and prompted Nasa to review its security measures.

 We will be looking at yesterdays events to see if we can improve the security for our employees out here, space centre director Michael Coats said in a news conference on Saturday.

 His boss, Nasa administrator Michael Griffin, said little could be done if someone is bent on revenge at any cost. It is essentially impossible to stop such a person, he said.

 Phillips, a contract employee at Nasa for Pasadena, California-based Jacobs Engineering Group Inc , was provoked by a mid-March job review that criticised him for being late to meetings and other minor offences, said Jacobs senior vice-president Lon Miller.

 But his overall score was average and Phillips was considered a solid performer until recently, Miller said.

 Phillips, who worked at the space center since 1992, bought a .38 calibre Smith amp; Wesson revolver on March 18 at a local gun shop and brought it into work in a duffel bag, officials said.

 He and Beverly, a quality control engineer with offices nearby in JSC Building 44, went to lunch with another employee, who said Phillips had acted strangely.

 At about 1.40 pm, Phillips walked into Beverlys office, which he shared with employee Fran Crenshaw, with a gun in hand. Police said Beverly attempted to calm Phillips down, but after a few minutes Phillips shot him, then left the room.

 Phillips returned, shot Beverly again as he tried to block the door, and took Crenshaw hostage.

 He barricaded the office, bound Crenshaw with duct tape, then watched news coverage of the event on television before killing himself, police said.

 In his lunch bag, investigators found a copy of his emailed performance review. It had been printed out March 18, the day he bought the gun.

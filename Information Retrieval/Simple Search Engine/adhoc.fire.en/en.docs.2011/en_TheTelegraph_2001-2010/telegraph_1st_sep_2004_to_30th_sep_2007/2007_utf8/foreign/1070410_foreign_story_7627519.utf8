 Woman to sell all on eBay

 Mid-life excitement

 St Paul (Minnesota), April 9 (AP): Lisa Perry wants a fresh start. So she has decided to sell nearly all of her belongings in one massive auction on eBay.

 Perry, 45, said the top bidder in the auction, ending on Thursday, will get more than 300 items including snowshoes, a futon, a bed, a Village People album, seashells and more.

 Perry is keeping just a few things: her dog, her cat, photo albums and some clothing. This might be mid-life, but its not a crisis. Its mid-life excitement, she said. I dont need it all. I dont use it all. I just have it all. Actually, it has me.

 Perry, has worked as a lawyer in Montana, a communications professor in Minnesota and a bookseller in North Carolina. She currently delivers subpoenas and legal documents. In June, she plans to move west, possibly to take up creative writing or holistic healing. 

 Ive been schlepping this stuff across the country for more than 20 years, she said. Im tired of thinking: Oh my God, what if it breaks in the next move? Who cares?. As of last night, the top bid was $100 (euro75). Perry has a reserve number of $2,000 (euro1,500), which means she can back out if the top bid falls short of that. But she said she might lower the reserve. Im at the point I just dont want it all anymore, she said.

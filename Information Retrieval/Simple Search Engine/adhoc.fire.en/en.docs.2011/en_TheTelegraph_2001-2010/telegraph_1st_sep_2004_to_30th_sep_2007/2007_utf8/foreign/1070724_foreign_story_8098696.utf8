 End of road for Shambo

 AMIT ROY

 No reprieve

 London, July 23: It looks like the end of the road for Shambo the bull after an appeal court today cleared the way for his slaughter.

 Last week, a high court judge issued a stay order on his proposed slaughter but today that ruling was overturned by three appeal court judges. This will be extremely distressing for the Hindu monks at the Skanda Vale Community in Llanpumsaint, Wales, who have looked after the six-year-old Friesian that health officials want to put down ever since he tested positive for exposure to bovine tuberculosis earlier this year. 

 Today, the judges were not persuaded by Mark Hoskins, the lawyer representing the Hindu monks, that killing Shambo would be comparable to killing a human being.

 The decision to slaughter Shambo, taken by the Welsh Assembly government in May, was justified, said the court of appeal.

 Lord Justice Pill, sitting with two other judges, who heard the case in Cardiff, said former rural affairs minister Jane Davidson acted lawfully when she refused to make an exception for Shambo as a sacred bull.

 The judge said: I have come to the conclusion that the minister was entitled to make the decision she did in regard to the very considerable problem presented by BTB. The decision to eliminate the risk by slaughter and not to permit an exception to the slaughter policy was, in my judgment, justified.

 The decision was justified, the judge said, even though Shambos slaughter would be considered by the community as a sacrilegious act and a very grave and serious interference with their religious rights. Earlier, Jonathan Crow representing the Assembly government, argued that the slaughter had been ordered to protect health, and that the policy was the way to achieve it.

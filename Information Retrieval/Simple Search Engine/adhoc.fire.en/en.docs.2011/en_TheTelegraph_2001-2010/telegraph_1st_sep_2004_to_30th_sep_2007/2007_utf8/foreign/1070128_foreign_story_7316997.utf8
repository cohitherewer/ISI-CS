 Shilpa gets bookie boost

 AMIT ROY

 critical time

 London, Jan. 27: Shilpa Shetty made an emotional appeal for the support of Asian viewers as bookmakers today made her the runaway favourite to win the final of Celebrity BigBrother tomorrow night.

 Asked by the unseen Big Brother if she was proud of herself when she was in the Diary Room, where contestants make confessions, she replied without hesitation: Very. I just hope my parents are proud at the end of it all. And I hope all those Indians and Pakistanis (and) Bangladeshis are proud of me because I truly came here to represent them more than myself.

 Although bookmakers have made Shilpa the runaway favourite to win, she could be pipped to the post either by former member of The Jackson Five, Jermaine Jackson, 52, elder brother of the much more famous Michael Jackson, or Dirk Benedict, 61, once the action man in the 1970s US soap, The A-Team.

 Realising the threat posed by Dirk, Shilpa had nominated the American for last nights eviction. Instead in the surprise double eviction, Jo Meara, 27, once a member of the pop band S Club, and the comedienne Cleo Rocos, 44, went, the former evicted by 48.4 per cent of viewers votes and Cleo by 27.9 per cent.

 Apart from Shilpa, Jermaine and Dirk, the others remaining include the 23-year-old model, Danielle Lloyd; Ian H Watkins, 30, a gay singer from the band Steps (the joke is that after interaction with the Bollywood babe, he is in danger of becoming straight); and Jack Tweedy, 19, boyfriend of the notorious Jade Goody.

 Ladbrokes were offering these odds this morning: Shilpa 1/4; Jermaine 4/1; Dirk 8/1; H 50/1; Danielle 100/1; any other 100/1.

 William Hill, meanwhile, had the following: 2/9 Shilpa; 5/1 Jermaine; 6/1 Dirk; 33/1 H 100/1 Danielle. William Hill had opened the betting on January 3 by offering 14/1 on Shilpa. This means anyone who bet 1 stands to make 14 if she wins, explained Rupert Adams, spokesman for William Hill. 

 He revealed that one person who had bet 50 on Shilpa at the start now stood to make 700 if she won.

 Now, you have to bet 9 to win two. To win 700 now, you have to bet 3,150 on Shilpa. The British love an underdog so that if the final had been last Tuesday after the racism row, Shilpa would have won 100 per cent. But that effect quickly wears off so that Shilpa is only 90 per cent sure to win, if we follow the money.

 There is the general feeling that Britains collective sins will be washed away if Shilpa were to win. But others have voiced their support for Jermaine, who has supported Shilpa in good times and in bad and proved a calm and steadying influence when tempers got frayed in the House.

 According to Adams, bookmakers expect to take 5 million in bets by tomorrow night. He also predicted about three million votes will be cast to decide the winner. But some will be multiple votes cast by the same person (which is legal). Its the last half hour of voting (by phone and text) which is critical.

 Shilpas mother, Sunanda Shetty, 57, is now in London and has taken on the countrys best known publicist, Max Clifford, to represent her daughter. 

 But in their hour of possible triumph, they should spare a thought for the agent, Jazz Barton, a soft-spoken Indian woman who has been cut out of any further involvement with Shilpa. This seems somewhat unfair and unkind since it was Barton who got Shilpa into Celebrity Big Brother along with an entry fee of 225,000 (not the 357,000 claimed earlier).

 Clifford is a legend in Fleet Street and takes a 20-25 per cent cut for his services but does manage to get very big money for his clients he could get Shilpa a fortune providing she was willing to give newspaper and TV interviews on the most personal aspects of her life (which, unlike Faria Alam, a former Clifford client, she wont, of course).

 After all, during 25 days on Celebrity Big Brother, Shilpa has projected herself as almost a modern day Sita.

 Clifford told the Daily Mirror today about the riches awaiting Shilpa: We have been inundated with offers, including film parts, endorsements, book deals and TB work. The skys the limit. I cannot reveal the details yet. However, I can say that there is absolutely no way she would be reunited with Jade Goody.

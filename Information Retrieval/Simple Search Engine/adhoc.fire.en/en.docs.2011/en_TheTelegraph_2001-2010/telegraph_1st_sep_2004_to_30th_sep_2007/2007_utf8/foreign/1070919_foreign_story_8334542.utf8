 Wanted baby, got twins

 Melbourne, Sept. 18 (PTI): An Australian woman, who underwent in-vitro fertilisation, has sued her doctor after she gave birth to twins instead of a single baby. 

 She is claiming more than $332,000 for the cost of raising the second child till the age of 21. Testifying before an Australian court today, the teary 40-year-old mother said she told Dr Robert Armellin that she wanted only one child in November 2003.

 But an embryologist under the doctors supervision implanted two embryos, resulting in the birth of non-identical twins. 

 The woman said she and her partner were devastated by the double birth and even considered putting one baby up for adoption.

 Spears settlement

 Los Angeles, March 30 (Reuters): Pop star Britney Spears has reached a settlement in her divorce from her husband, former backup dancer Kevin Federline, People magazine said yesterday on its website.

 Terms were not disclosed.

 The parties signed a global settlement on all issues of their marriage and the custody of the children, a spokesman for Federlines attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan told People. Spears, who left a rehab centre last week after a month of treatment for undisclosed issues, filed for divorce from second husband Federline in November after two years of marriage and two children. A judge would have to approve the settlement for the divorce to become final.

 Slowhand jam session

 Los Angeles (AP): Eric Clapton is having a jam session with more than a dozen of his favourite guitar-playing pals, and everyone is invited. Claptons Crossroads Guitar Festival, scheduled for July 28 in the Chicago suburb of Bridgeview, will benefit Crossroads Centre, the drug-rehab facility he founded in Antigua a decade ago. Tickets go on sale on Saturday. Scheduled performers include B.B. King, Willie Nelson, Vince Gill, Sheryl Crow, Jeff Beck and John Mayer, among others and Clapton, who is also known as Slowhand, is already excited about spontaneous collaborations. 

 Not so sweet Jesus

 New York (Reuters): A life-size sculpture of a naked Jesus made out of chocolate has angered a Roman Catholic organisation and forced a Manhattan art gallery to reconsider exhibiting it during Easter week. The sculpture My Sweet Lord by Cosimo Cavallaro was to be exhibited for two hours each day next week in a street-level window of the Roger Smith Lab Gallery in mid-town Manhattan. It was set to open on Monday, days before Good Friday. The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights called for a boycott. This is an assault on Christians during Holy Week, said Kiera McCaffrey, director of communications for the league.

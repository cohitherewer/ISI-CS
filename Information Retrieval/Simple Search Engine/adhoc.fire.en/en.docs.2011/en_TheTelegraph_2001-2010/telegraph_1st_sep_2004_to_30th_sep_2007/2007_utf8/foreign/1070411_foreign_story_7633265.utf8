 Singapore, April 10 (AP): Singapores Changi Airport will impose a 100-millilitre limit on each container of liquid, aerosol and gel in the carry-on luggage of departing passengers, the Civil Aviation Authority announced today.

 The regulations are in line with the International Civil Aviation Organisations guidelines, which follow a foiled attempt to conceal liquid explosives in carry-on luggage on flights from London to the US last August.

 Beginning on May 8, items such as lipstick, toothpaste, shaving cream, drinks and all other liquids, aerosols and gels must be carried in containers of less than 100 millilitres each in re-sealable, transparent plastic bags no larger than 1 litre, the authority said. Only one bag is allowed per passenger. Exemptions will be made for medications, baby food and special dietary items.

 The transparent bags will be screened separately from other hand luggage at security checkpoints. Travellers can still purchase duty-free items, such as perfume or alcohol, from Changi Airport. These will be placed in sealed bags with the receipt showing.

 The restrictions also apply at Singapores smaller Seletar Airport, which is mainly used for chartered flights. The International Civil Aviation Organisation has urged its 190 members to comply with the guidelines. Territories such as the US, the EU, Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong have already implemented such restrictions. Last August, police foiled a plan by extremists to use liquid explosives to blow up as many as 10 flights between the US and Britain.

 Anna axe on Bahamas minister 

 Anna Nicole Smith

 Nassau, Bahamas, Feb. 19 (ap): Immigration minister Shane Gibson resigned in a flap over his relationship with Anna Nicole Smith.

 Photos appeared in a Bahamas newspaper recently showing Gibson in bed with the former Playboy playmate before her death, embracing her. Both were fully clothed, but the appearance of the pictures stoked a controversy because Gibson had fast-tracked her application for permanent residency on the island chain.

 I want to apologise to all persons who may in any way have been offended by anything that I have said, done, or perceived to have said or done, Gibson said on TV, declaring that he was resigning.

 Smith, who died on February 8 in Hollywood, Florida, lived in the Bahamas in a house that a South Carolina developer claims to own.

 Smith said the gated, waterfront mansion was hers when she applied for residency in the Bahamas last year.

 Prime Minister Perry Christie said he accepted Gibbons resignation. However sad Shanes decision to resign may be, I also believe, as does he, that it is the correct course of action for him to take in all of the circumstances, the Prime Minister said on TV.

 Gibson stated emphatically during a special broadcast on TV that although he was stepping down, he was not admitting any accusations against him, calling them vicious and wicked lies.

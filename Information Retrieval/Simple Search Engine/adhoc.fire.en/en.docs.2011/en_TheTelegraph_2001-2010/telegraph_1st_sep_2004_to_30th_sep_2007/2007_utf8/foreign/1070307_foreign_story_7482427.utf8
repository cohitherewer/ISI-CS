 Moving Mariah

 Nashville (Tennessee), March 6 (AP): Mariah Carey turned some heads in Nashville while filming scenes for the upcoming movie Tennessee.

 The R amp;B diva is playing an aspiring country signer who flees her controlling husband in New Mexico by moving to Nashville with two brothers. Last week, she sang at the downtown honky-tonk Second Fiddle. She co-wrote Right To Dream with Willie Nelson and performed it with Nelsons harmonica player, Mickey Raphael.

 People were weeping on the crew when she sang it, director Aaron Woodley said. Its very moving, especially in the context of the film.

 Gibson, fresh off his Mexico-based epic Apocalypto,

 Panama.

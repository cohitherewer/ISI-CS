 Intellectual could be Chinas future leader

 Li Keqiang: Liberal

 Beijing, Sept 12 (Reuters): The next Communist Party leader in China, the land of Mao Zedong, could be a man who as a student mixed with democracy advocates and learned the ideas of bewigged English judges at a university that was a hotspot of dissent.

 Li Keqiang, 52-year-old Party secretary of the northeastern province of Liaoning, is widely tipped as a potential successor to President Hu Jintao.

 Lis rise through the Communist Youth League that also nurtured Hu and then postings in big, tough provinces have marked him for higher things. Many observers expect him to enter the Politburo Standing Committee at a Party Congress in October, putting him in contention to take Hus place five years hence.

 But Lis past as an intellectually voracious law student during an era of liberal ferment would mark a break with the staid engineers who have run China since the 1990s.

 He was at the elite Peking University from the late 1970s, when calls for free speech and democracy sprouted in the ideological disillusion left by Maos Cultural Revolution.

 He plunged into campus politics as reformist ideas galvanised students, befriended freethinkers who went on to notoriety as exiled dissidents, and co-translated The Due Process of Law by Lord Denning, the famed English jurist.

 Lis past need not make him a harbinger of radical liberalisation. Accounts also depict a political chameleon who stayed within the system and paid his dues as a submissive functionary.

 But his background seems sure to fuel questions about whether the Communist Party can ensure its future leaders avoid the radical impulses of their youth as they negotiate dramatic economic change and calls for democratic reform.

 Being a university student is an age when a persons value framework is set, said Zhang Zuhua, a former Youth League official who closely observes politics.

 That period certainly had a huge impact on his outlook. The question is whether he is able to use it or has to struggle against it.

 Sharif, brother file pleas for return home

 Big gamble

 Islamabad, Aug. 2 (PTI): Former Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his brother Shabaz filed two identical petitions in the supreme court here today seeking a judicial directive to the government not to obstruct their return home and permit them to take part in the coming elections.

 The two petitions were filed by Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) leaders on behalf of Sharif and Shabaz who was the chief minister of Punjab province. The brothers also sought a court order asking the government not to bar them from taking part in the elections which will most likely be held next year.

 Sharif and former Premier Benazir Bhutto have been barred from contesting elections in Pakistan. 

 Asserting that they lead one of the largest parties in the country, the brothers said in their petitions that they had the right to take part in the elections as Article 17 of the constitution guarantees them the right to participate in the affairs of the government, including right to participate and contest elections, right to form a government, if their party secures majority in the National Assembly.

 The petitions were filed a week after President Musharraf and Bhutto met in Abu Dhabi and apparently struck an informal deal.

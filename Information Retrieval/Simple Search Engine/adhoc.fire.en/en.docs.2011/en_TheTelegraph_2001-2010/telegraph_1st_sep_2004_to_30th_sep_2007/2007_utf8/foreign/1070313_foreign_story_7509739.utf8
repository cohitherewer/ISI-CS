 UK language emergency

 London, March 12 (Reuters): The government said today it would make studying foreign languages compulsory for primary school pupils in a bid to reverse a serious decline in the popularity of subjects like French and German.

 The move comes after a review headed by Lord Dearing, the former chairman of the exam body: Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, which concluded that children should study a foreign language from the age of seven.

 The evidence is that is probably the best time to start when you are young, Dearing told BBC radio, adding that already about 70 per cent of primary schools taught languages. Lets plan now to make it part of the standard curriculum from the age of seven, possibly in 2010 as part of a next review of the curriculum for primary schools.

 The proposal comes amid a slump in the number of pupils taking modern languages at GSCE after the government decided they should no longer be compulsory for secondary school pupils up the age of 16.

 Last year, the number taking German dropped by 14.2 per cent and there was a 13.2 per cent fall in the entries for French. However, Dearing said he would not recommend reversing the decision to make languages optional for children over 14. 

 We thought a quick fix like that wasnt the answer because there are some fundamental problems and we wanted to tackle those, he said. We need a range of learning opportunities for different kids with different aspirations. We want to help teachers to make full use of all that can be offered from modern technology.

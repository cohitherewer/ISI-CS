 Market threat to Chinese casinos

 Macau, Feb. 11 (AP): The opening of Stanley Hos new Grand Lisboa casino with a gold tower and a top shaped like a lotus flower today will help the billionaire compete with cocky American gaming tycoons who have stormed into Macau.

 But analysts say that Hos company Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, or SJM will continue to lose market share in the booming Chinese territory that in 2006 edged out the Las Vegas Strip as the worlds biggest gambling centre.

 SJMs market share has nowhere to go but down, JPMorgan said in a report.

 The problem for the 85-year-old Ho is that hes facing a wave of new competition something he didnt have to worry about during the 40 years that he enjoyed the monopoly on gaming in Macau. But those golden days ended in 2002 when the Chinese government opened up the market to foreign competition.

 Ho has 17 casinos that control about half the market share in Macau a peninsula and two islands off Chinas southeastern coast. But several other casino resort projects are in the works and theyre expected to lure away more of his business.

 Later this year, American billionaire Sheldon Adelson plans to open his 3,000-suite Venetian Macao, billed as the largest hotel-casino in the world. The complex and many others are being built on reclaimed land between two islands called the Cotai Strip.

 Adelson has said that when the Cotai Strip opens, most of the casinos on the peninsula where Hos Grand Lisboa is located will be toast.

 When the entire Cotai Strip is open, the competitive battle will be finished, Adelson said last year.

 But others argue that Macaus casino business will not be a zero-sum game. One of the most popular sayings in the city is that when the water rises, all the boats go up with it. Although Hos casinos wont be as dominant as they once were, theyll still make money, some say.

 Stanleys casinos will still fulfill a certain sector of the gambling community. I think hell obviously come up with newer and better casinos, like the Grand Lisboa, said Rob Hart of Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong. Hart noted that Ho is still the largest owner of land in Macau.

 So while he might lose some gaming revenue, he said, the rest of his land bank portfolio is worth a huge amount. The land costs are going up in Macau, so hes worth more and more.

 Losing the gaming monopoly might have been one of the best things to happen to Ho. China announced that the monopoly would end just a day after the former Portuguese enclave returned to Chinese rule in 1999.

 The last years of Portuguese rule were violent as criminal gangs or triads waged turf wars. Bombings and drive-by shootings were common and many tourists did not dare to visit Macau. The place was a sleazy attraction for daytripping gamblers who also indulged in prostitution in the citys many saunas and massage parlours.

 Chinas leadership also wanted Macau to expand its portfolio to include upscale shopping malls, resorts and convention centres. So the government opened the market to American gaming titans like Adelson, Stephen Wynn and MGM Mirage Inc. who helped transform Las Vegas into one of the worlds most successful tourist hotspots.

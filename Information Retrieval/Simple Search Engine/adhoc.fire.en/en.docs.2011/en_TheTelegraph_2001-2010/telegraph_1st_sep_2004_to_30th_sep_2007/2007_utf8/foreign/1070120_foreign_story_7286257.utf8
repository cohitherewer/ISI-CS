 Pak tries to calm Pervez furore

 In line of fire

 Islamabad, Jan. 19 (PTI): In a bid to calm Opposition protests over plans to get President Musharraf re-elected for another five-year term, the Pakistan government said yesterday that it had not decided on the timing of the polls as this is doe by the election commission.

 Opposition members in the upper house of Parliament, the Senate, had questioned the right of the cabinet to decide on when the elections would be held. They had also objected to Musharraf seeking a second term as President of Pakistan.

 However, information minister Muhammad Ali Durani said the cabinet only heard briefings by legal experts over Musharrafs re-election. 

 It is not the job of the cabinet to take such a decision. It is for the election commission to decide when to hold an election, Durani said while trying to pacify agitated Opposition members yesterday.

 The leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Mian Raza Rabbani, said the Opposition will resist any such move inside and outside parliament. Our option of tendering en-bloc resignations is still open.

 Rabbani, a senior Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader, said the governments decision was unconstitutional and based on political bankruptcy. 

 After the House was adjourned, Durani was quoted by the official APP news agency as saying that Musharraf would be the joint candidate of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid-a-Azam) alliance for a five-year presidential term. 

 After a cabinet meeting yesterday, Durani had said that Musharraf would be re-elected by the national and provincial Assemblies between September and October ahead of the general elections.

 Durani said Musharrafs present term would end almost a week before the completion of the five-year term of the sitting Assemblies on November 16, 2007. 

 The cabinet was told that as per the constitution, the Assemblies would complete their term on November 16. The President should be elected between September and October 2007 and the interim set-up will be put in place in line with the constitutional provisions, he said. 

 PPP leader Amin Fahim said that if Musharraf went ahead with the re-election plans, the party would call for the resignation of all Opposition members from all Assemblies in the country.

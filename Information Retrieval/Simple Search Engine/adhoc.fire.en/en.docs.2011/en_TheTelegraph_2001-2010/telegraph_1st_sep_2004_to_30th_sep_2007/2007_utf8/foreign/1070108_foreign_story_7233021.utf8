 Costly joke

 Vienna, Jan. 7 (AFP): An Austrian couple have had their marriage postponed for 10 weeks because the bride said no as a joke when the registrar asked during the civil ceremony whether she would take this man to be her husband. 

 Despite the entreaties of the bride, who said immediately she had just meant it in jest, the registrar at once broke off the ceremony in the town of Steyr. 

 According to Austrian regulations, there must be a postponement of at least 10 weeks should one of the parties respond in the negative when asked during the ceremony if he or she consents to the union.

 Boa theft 

 Cleveland Heights, Ohio (AP): A mother and son accused of stealing a snake from a pet store were arrested the next day when they returned to the store and asked for books on how to care for the animal.

 Store clerks recognised the suspects from surveillance video taken during the theft. It showed the boy taking the 30-inch baby boa from its cage, wrapping it around his neck and hiding it with his jacket, while his mother acted as a lookout. 

 Kenny loss

 Sandy Springs, Georgia (AP): Kenny Rogers has lost some fans in one neighbourhood.

 Rogers bought a $2.3-million home in Sandy Springs in October 2005, but his demolition of the two-storey house and plans to build another house on the 7.5-acre land have angered some neighbours. Now, instead of rebuilding, the country music superstar is selling the land for $3.95 million.

 Cathy and Alan Gottlieb, whose house is behind Rogerss, said it has transformed the view from their back deck from dense woods to a dirt mound.

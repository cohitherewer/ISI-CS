 No biased report on J amp;K: Pak

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 Islamabad , Jan 5: The Pakistan government today told the two-member fact-finding team from the European Parliament (EP) that it will not accept a biased and lopsided report on the Kashmir dispute. 

 The two legislators, Elmar Brok, chairman of the committee on foreign relations, and James Elles, chairman all- party group on Kashmir, assured the Pakistan leaders that they would reveal all the facts of the dispute to their parliament. 

 Top Pakistani and Kashmiri leaders had strongly criticised EP legislator Baroness Emma Nicholsons recent draft report on Kashmir which brushed aside calls for a plebiscite. 

 President Pervez Musharraf also urged the parliament to adopt a balanced and forward looking report.

 Moscow, Idaho, May 20 (AP): Police stormed an Idaho church where a shooter hid after killing a police officer in a courthouse ambush, finding the body of the gunman and another man today.

 The shooter had an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, with a semi-automatic rifle, ammunition and spent shells nearby, police said.

 The shooting began late on Saturday and also wounded a second officer and a civilian, said David Duke, Moscows assistant police chief. Duke said the shooter fired into the Latah County courthouse from a parking lot across the street to lure people into the line of fire.

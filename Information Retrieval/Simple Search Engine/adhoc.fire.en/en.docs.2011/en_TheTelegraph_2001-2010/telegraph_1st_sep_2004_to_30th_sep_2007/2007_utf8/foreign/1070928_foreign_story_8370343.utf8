 Scorsese plans film on Harrison

 Los Angeles, Sept. 27 (Reuters): Filmmaker Martin Scorsese plans to direct an authorised documentary about George Harrison, the former Beatle who died of lung cancer in 2001, Daily Variety reported today.

 Interviews and early production will begin this year, and the film will take several years to complete, the trade paper said. 

 It would have given George great joy to know that Martin Scorsese has agreed to tell his story, the paper quoted Harrisons widow, Olivia, as saying.

 She will serve as a producer of the untitled project, and will supply archival materials. Daily Variety added that surviving Beatle members Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr would participate, as would the Beatless Apple Records label.

 Scorsese, who won an Oscar this year for directing the crime saga The Departed, is preparing for the April 2008 release of a concert documentary about the Rolling Stones, called Shine A Light. 

 He turned his attention to Bob Dylan in the 2005 documentary No Direction Home, and depicted the Bands farewell concert in 1976s The Last Waltz.

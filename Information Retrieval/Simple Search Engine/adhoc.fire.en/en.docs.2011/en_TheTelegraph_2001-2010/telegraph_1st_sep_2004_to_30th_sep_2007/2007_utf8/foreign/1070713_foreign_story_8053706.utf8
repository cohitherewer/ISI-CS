 Islamabad, July 12 (Reuters): 

 Grieving relatives and villagers buried rebel Pakistani 

 cleric Abdul Rashid Ghazi today at Basti Abdullah village 

 in Punjab province. 

 The burials took place a day after commandos killed the last few gunmen hiding in the ruins of the Lal Masjid, including Ghazi.

 His elder brother Abdul Aziz led the prayers before the clerics body was buried. 

 Mourners smashed the coffins glass lid and tore a white cloth from the corpses face to see if it was really that of the cleric. There were chants of al Jihad as prayers were read for Ghazi. Aziz said the deaths would push Pakistan towards an Islamic revolution.

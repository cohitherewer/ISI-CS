 Heathrow passengers wait 9 hours for luggage

 PATRICK PHELVIN

 London, Aug. 7: Holidaymakers faced more airport misery yesterday as they were forced to endure nine-hour waits to reclaim their luggage at Heathrow.

 Baggage handlers are struggling with a rise in the number of items that have to be put in the hold for security reasons. It means passengers are often left facing long delays. The problems have led to criticism of British Airways and BAA, which owns Heathrow, as the airport lurches into a second week of chaos.

 BA lost 22,000 items last month. The situation has been made worse because rules only allow one piece of hand luggage. The airline admitted last night that it had resorted to flying jets containing nothing but luggage in an effort to reunite customers with their bags. There were also reports of a shortage of handlers because up to 100 a day had been taken to train in the new Terminal Five building, although BA denied this.

 At Terminal Four yesterday, travellers from Lagos, Nigeria, complained that they had to wait from 6am until 3pm to pick up their luggage.

 BA has denied reports its luggage handling systems are in meltdown.

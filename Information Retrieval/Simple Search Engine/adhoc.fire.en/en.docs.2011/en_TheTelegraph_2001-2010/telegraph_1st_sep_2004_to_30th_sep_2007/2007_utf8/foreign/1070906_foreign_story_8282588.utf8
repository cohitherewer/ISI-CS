 Myanmar soldiers fire at monks

 Yangon, Sept. 5 (Reuters): Soldiers in military-ruled Myanmar fired warning shots today to halt a march of 500 Buddhist monks protesting against fuel price hikes in a provincial town, a resident said.

 The monks were holding banners and placards condemning the price hikes in Pakokku, around 600 km northwest of Yangon, and reciting Buddhist holy scriptures when the army broke them up by firing shots over their heads, the woman said.

 The Norway-based Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB), a news service run by exile dissidents, also reported the armys intervention, the first time soldiers have been called up during two weeks of rare protests over soaring fuel costs.

 DVB said onlookers who had been cheering the march from both sides of the road were beaten. There was no word on numbers of injured.

 The female resident said the supporters numbered in the thousands, again the first time that the so far small outbreaks of dissent have induced major support from a public normally too cowed to criticise the ruling junta.

 Analysts said the military intervention against monks was particularly risky for the junta as the town is only 80 miles from the former Burmas second city of Mandalay, the religious heart of a devoutly Buddhist nation and home to 300,000 monks. Historically, monks have played a major role in political uprisings.

 US sends third carrier to Gulf

 Manama, July 10 (Reuters): The US navy said today it had sent a third aircraft carrier to its Fifth Fleet area of operations, which includes waters close to Iran, whose row with the West over its nuclear plans has stoked regional tensions.

 The carrier will join two aircraft carriers already in the area, which recently gave the US navy its biggest presence in the Gulf since the Iraq war in 2003, a Navy spokeswoman said.

 Enterprise provides navy power to counter the assertive, disruptive and coercive behaviour of some countries, as well as support our soldiers and marines in Iraq, the US navy said. In May, a flotilla of US warships sailed through the the Gulf to hold exercises off Irans coast.

 Nepal seeks Indias help in calming Terai rage

 J HEMANTH 

 Kathmandu, 

 July 18: Unable to stop the situation in Nepals 

 Terai region from spinning out of control, Nepals 

 multi-party government sought New Delhis help in resolving 

 the strife in the plains bordering India. 

 Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala 

 formally conveyed his governments request to Indian 

 ambassador Shiv Shankar Mukherjee at a meeting here this 

 morning. 

 Even as Mukherjee was invited 

 to Koiralas residence, a government official was 

 murdered in the Terai by activists of the Jantantrik Terai 

 Mukti Morcha (Jwala Singh). The outfit has ordered all officials 

 from the hills to leave the plains within seven days. 

 According to Indian mission sources 

 here, Koirala told Mukherjee that the escalating violence 

 in the plains could derail the Constituent Assembly, due 

 to be held on November 22.

 He also sought the Indian governments 

 help in resolving the crisis as New Delhi wields considerable 

 clout among the Madhesis.

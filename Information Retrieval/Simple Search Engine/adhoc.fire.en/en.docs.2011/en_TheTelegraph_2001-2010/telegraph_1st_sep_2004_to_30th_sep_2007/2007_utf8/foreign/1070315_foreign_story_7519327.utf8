 Potter book to break records

 New York, March 14 (Reuters): Publisher Scholastic Corp. said today it would release a record-breaking 12 million copies for the first US printing of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, which hits stores on July 21.

 The release of the seventh and final book in the popular series by British author J.K. Rowling will be backed by a multimillion-dollar marketing campaign and is expected to be one of the biggest publishing events in recent years.

 The first printing of Deathly Hallows breaks a record of 10.8 million copies of the sixth book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, in 2005. That book sold 6.9 million.

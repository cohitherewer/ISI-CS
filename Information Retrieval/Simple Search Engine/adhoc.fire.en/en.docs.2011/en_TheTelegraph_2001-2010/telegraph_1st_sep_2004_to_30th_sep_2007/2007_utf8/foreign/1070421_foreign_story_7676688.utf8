 Hasina plans Monday return

 Dhaka, April 20 (PTI): Former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina plans to defy a ban by the interim government and return to Bangladesh on Monday, a close aide of the Awami League chief said.

 She remained firm on her decision to return home on April 23, Abdus Sobhan Golap told Channel I television after arriving in London from the US where she had been on a private visit.

 Hasinas resolve to return to Bangladesh comes a day after a senior government adviser said steps would be taken against Hasina if she returned home.

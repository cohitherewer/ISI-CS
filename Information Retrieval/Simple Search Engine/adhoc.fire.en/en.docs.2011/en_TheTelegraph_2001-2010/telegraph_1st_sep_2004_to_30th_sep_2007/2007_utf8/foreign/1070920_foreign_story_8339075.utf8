 London, Sept. 19: While it may cost more than 10,000 and perhaps a few hours in the gym, women were yesterday given the opportunity to dress like the actress Liz Hurley, wife of Indian entrepreneur Arun Nayar.

 The plunging black and gold, safety-pin Versace dress with which Hurley stole the show at the 1994 premiere of Four Weddings and a Funeral went on sale for the first time yesterday at Harrods. 

 That dress, as it became known by the worlds media, is part of an exhibition dedicated to the little black dress at the London store.

 And it is not the only famous garment on show the simple black shift worn by Audrey Hepburn in the 1963 movie Charades is also on display, amid modern versions of the style staple.

 Martin Buckley, the marketing manager at Harrods, said: The little black dress is an institution were proud to pay homage to.

 As the Hepburn dress proved, however old the design, a little black dress will always be a stunning classic.

 The exhibition is part of Harrods Timeless Luxury promotion. Hurleys safety-pin dress costs 10,690 and will be delivered two months from the date of order. The dress is credited with launching the high-profile career of Liz Hurley. She had a thirteen-year relationship with Hugh Grant, the star of Four Weddings and a Funeral.

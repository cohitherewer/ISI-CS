 Dogged betting

 Kuala Lumpur, Aug. 29 (Reuters): Six years of betting on the same lottery numbers has finally paid off for a Malaysian businessman who won 2 million ringgit ($572,700).

 About a week ago, one of my eyelids kept twitching and I knew something good would happen, said the unidentified man, who is in his 40s with one child. True enough, one of my numbers was drawn as the first prize last Saturday. He said he would put aside some of the money to fund his childs education.

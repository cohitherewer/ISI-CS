 Britain begins turkey culling

 Holton, England, Feb. 4 (Reuters): Britain gassed tens of thousands of turkeys and extended restrictions on the movement of poultry today to try to prevent the spread of deadly bird flu from a farm in eastern England.

 The discovery of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian flu on a farm run by Europes largest turkey producer surprised experts and raised questions about how the virus had been introduced into a sealed shed.

 However, the department for the environment, food and rural affairs (Defra) expressed optimism today that the virus had been confined to the Bernard Matthews farm near Lowestoft in the county of Suffolk. Obviously, though, we need to be very vigilant in the coming days, a spokeswoman said.

 The slaughter of 159,000 birds at the farm, which started late yesterday, was expected to take another two days. The dead birds were being transported from the farm in sealed trucks to be incinerated.

 About 2,500 turkeys died in the initial outbreak of the virus, which appears to have been confined to one of 22 sheds at the farm.

 Restrictions on the movement of poultry were extended overnight to a 2,000-sq-km area around the farm.

 Africa flu death

 The WHO has confirmed that bird flu killed a 22-year-old Nigerian woman, making her the first known human fatality of the H5N1 virus in sub-Saharan Africa.

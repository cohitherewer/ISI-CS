 No Fidel on top Cuba day

 Camaguey (Cuba), July 26 (AP): Interim President Raul Castro told tens of thousands of loyalists today that the country suffered a serious blow when his brother Fidel fell ill a year ago, but that the chaos that the US had long predicted never materialised.

 We could hardly have suspected what a hard blow was awaiting us, the younger Castro said of Fidels illness as he took his brothers place at ceremonies marking the launch of the Cuban revolution.

 These have truly been difficult moments, although with a diametrically different impact than that expected by our enemies, who wished for chaos to take hold and for Cuban socialism to collapse, he said.

 The one-hour speech by Cubas 76-year-old defence minister came exactly a year after Fidels last public appearances, when he celebrated the Revolution Day anniversary with speeches in the eastern cities of Bayamo and Holguin. Now 12 months at the helm, Rauls provisional leadership gained further airs of permanence as he delivered the keynote message on the islands top holiday.

 Fidel, who turns 81 next month, has for decades given hours-long speeches to mark Cubas top holiday. But he apparently has been too sick to appear in person.

 Tokyo, Aug. 5 (Reuters): Embattled Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe today apologised to survivors of the US 1945 atomic bombing of Hiroshima for remarks by his former defence minister that had appeared to condone the attack.

 In a meeting with atomic bomb survivors one day ahead of the anniversary of the attack on Hiroshima, Abe also promised to respect Japans own ban on nuclear arms.

 The comments about the atomic bombings by Fumio Kyuma were part of a series of gaffes and scandals involving cabinet ministers that outraged Japanese voters and contributed to a defeat for Abes ruling camp in a July 29 upper house election.

 I apologise for Mr Kyumas remarks that resulted in hurting the feelings of atomic bomb victims very much, Kyodo news agency quoted Abe as telling representatives of survivors of the bombing in Hiroshima.

 Kyuma, who had said the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki couldnt be helped because they brought World War II to an end, stepped down over the remarks, becoming the third minister to exit Abes cabinet by resignation or suicide after he took office in September. A fourth minister resigned last week.

 The 52-year-old Abe, Japans first Premier born after World War II, also pledged to keep Tokyos ban on nuclear arms and work to abolish atomic weapons worldwide.

 I will maintain the three non-nuclear principles and will try to take leadership toward nuclear abolition, Kyodo quoted him as saying, referring to Tokyos decades-old prohibition on having, making or allowing the introduction of nuclear weapons.

 Abe promised to review the governments tough standards for determining whether atomic bomb victims suffer from radiation disease, the subject of a series of law suits by victims.

 It has been 62 years since the atomic bombs were dropped and we must perfect an appropriate policy from the overall perspective of insurance, medical care and welfare, Abe told the victims groups as cameras rolled at the start of the meeting.

 Abe has vowed to stay on in his post despite the drubbing at the polls. The ruling camp has a huge majority in the lower house, which picks the Prime Minister.

 But his support rate has slipped to just over 20 per cent according to one media survey after the election, which gave control of the less powerful of parliaments two chambers to the Opposition Democratic Party of Japan and its allies.

 Abe is tomorrow scheduled to attend an annual ceremony commemorating the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima by the Enola Gay B-29 warplane.

 Pak govt lawyer quits as protests loom

 Islamabad, March 20 (Reuters): A Pakistani deputy attorney-general resigned today citing a crisis over government efforts to sack the countrys top judge, as lawyers and the Opposition vowed more protests against the government.

 The suspension of Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry on March 9 after the government lodged unspecified accusations against him has infuriated lawyers and many ordinary Pakistanis, and has blown up into President Pervez Musharrafs biggest political crisis as a general election looms.

 I have resigned because in the current judicial crisis, it was very difficult for me to perform my duties, Nasir Saeed Sheikh, one of three deputy attorneys-general, said. He did not elaborate.

 Seven judges have resigned this week to protest against the move to sack Chaudhry, which fuelled suspicion that Musharraf feared the independent-minded judge would not allow any attempt by the President to retain his post of army chief, which he is due to give up this year. Many judges and lawyers see the move against Chaudhry as an attack on the independence of the judiciary. The government has not given details of the accusations but a state news agency cited misconduct and misuse of authority. Lawyers and Opposition activists clashed with police in Islamabad and Lahore last week. Protests have continued this week but there has been no violence.

 Lawyers and an alliance of religious parties had called for protests outside the supreme court tomorrow, where Chaudhry was due to appear for a third time before the judicial watchdog hearing the accusations against him, raising fears of more disturbances.

 But the panel of judges, known as the Supreme Judicial Council, postponed the hearing to April 3, the supreme court said. No reason was given.

 The president of the Bar Council said the postponement was a ploy to sabotage their protest, which he said would go ahead outside the supreme court tomorrow. Lawyers across the country would also strike.

 In a related hearing, the supreme court gave a high court judge a week to get to the bottom of reports that police manhandled Chaudhry on March 13, when he was being taken to the first hearing. Chaudhry was kept under virtual house arrest with his family for the week after his suspension. 

 His lawyers say he is now free to meet who he wants although he is not giving media interviews. Judge Javed Iqbal, who was made acting chief justice after Chaudhrys suspension, said he also wanted the judge to look into police action against protesters and reporters during last weeks demonstrations in Islamabad and Lahore.

 Waziristan clashes

 Nearly 50 people, including 35 foreign militants, have been killed in two days of fighting between the al Qaida-linked militants and Pakistani tribesmen, Pakistani government officials said today.

 A battle between foreign militants, most of them Uzbeks, and ethnic Pashtun tribesmen erupted in the remote area near the Afghan border on March 6. It followed government efforts to convince the tribesmen to help keep order.

 The latest fighting broke out on Monday in Shin Warsak village, 7 km west of Wana, the main town in the South Waziristan region.

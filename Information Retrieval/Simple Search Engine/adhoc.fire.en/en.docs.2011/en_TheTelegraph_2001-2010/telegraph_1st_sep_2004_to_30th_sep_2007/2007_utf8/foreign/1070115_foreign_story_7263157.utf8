 Hollywood celebs return to Japan ads

 Diaz, Pitt: Japan lure 

 Tokyo, Jan. 14: Forget the rising stock market or fifth straight year of economic growth. The latest sign of Japan Inc.s comeback is Cameron Diaz in a slinky black dress gabbing on a phone and strutting to the tune of Aerosmiths Walk This Way on Japanese television. But this is no film trailer or wacky guest appearance its a 30-second commercial for a cellular telephone company. 

 And Diaz is hardly alone. As the decade-long recession drifts into memory here, the Only in Japan celebrity commercial is enjoying a sudden comeback with Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and Scarlett Johansson among the US stars coming back to Japan to peddle everything from dairy products to power bars. 

 Long a guilty financial pleasure of the Hollywood A-list and one that is increasingly difficult to keep under wraps in the Internet age the so-called OIJ ad emerged and bloomed during the 70s and 80s. 

 Named because of strict deals forbidding distribution or publicity outside Japan, such ads offered a chance for megastars to blatantly cash in on their fame while maintaining loftier images at home. 

 That changed after Japans economic bubble burst in the early 1990s, leaving Japanese companies unable or unwilling to shell out for Tinseltowns highest earners. Best illustrated by Bill Murray in 2003s Oscar-winning film Lost in Translation he played an aging actor whose top offer came from a Japanese whiskey maker the Only in Japan ads of the 90s were mere shadows of their predecessors. 

 A big name would appear every now and then Madonna did a shochu liquor commercial in 1995. But the Japanese ad scene became mostly dominated by cheaper Hollywood B-listers. 

 But as this nation revels in its longest period of economic growth since World War II ended, Japanese companies are dusting the cobwebs off their advertising budgets and hiring the big guns again. Last year, Japanese companies spent $52 billion on domestic ad campaigns, the second-highest in the postwar era.

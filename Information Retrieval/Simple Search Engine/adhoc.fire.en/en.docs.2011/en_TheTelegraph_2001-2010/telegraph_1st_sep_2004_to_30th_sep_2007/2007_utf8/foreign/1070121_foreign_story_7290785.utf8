 Turk editor shot dead

 Istanbul, Jan. 20 (Reuters): A high-profile Turkish-Armenian editor, who had been convicted of insulting Turkeys identity, was shot dead in Istanbul yesterday in an attack bound to raise political tensions in an election year.

 Hrant Dink, a frequent target of nationalist anger for his comments on the mass killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks during World War I, was shot in the head as he left his weekly newspaper Agos around 1300 GMT in the centre of the city.

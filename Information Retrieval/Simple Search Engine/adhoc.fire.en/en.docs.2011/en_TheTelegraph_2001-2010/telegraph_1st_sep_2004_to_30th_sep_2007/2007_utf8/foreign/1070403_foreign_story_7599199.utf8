 Fine Print

 Hairy Trump

 Detroit, April 2 (AP): Billionaire Donald Trump prevailed in the hair match at the entertainment wrestling event Wrestlemania.

 Trump trumped World Wrestling Entertainment owner Vince McMahon yesterday in the Battle of the Billionaires at the WWEs largest annual TV event. After the real estate mogul and reality TV star triumphed, he gleefully took the shears to McMahons head.

 Trump and McMahon didnt actually battle it out in the ring, but instead had WWE wrestlers representing them grapple to see who would go bald. The winner, Trumps guy Bobby Lashley, bested McMahons chosen wrestler, Umaga.

 Trump wasnt just a cheerleader during the match he leaped off his feet at one point and drove McMahon into the ground, then pummelled him with some close-fisted punches.

 Lashleys victory over the 135 kg Samoan Bulldozer meant that McMahon had to yield to Trumps razor.

 Cool cup

 Panama City (Reuters): Panamas top coffee producer said it believes it has set a new record for the worlds biggest cup of coffee, after brewing 2,840 litres in a giant mug on Sunday. Producer Cafe Duran used 136 kg of Arabica coffee to brew a cup measuring 2.75 metres by 1.5 metres over four hours.

 We are really thrilled with this, Panama has done it! Ricardo Duran, director-owner of the company, said to loud applause, fireworks and live tropical music.

 Clean feat

 Adrian, Michigan (AP): A 12-year-old boy who has collected more than 150 vacuum cleaners says he is learning to identify them by sound. Im getting pretty good at it, Kyle Krichbaum told the Detroit Free Press. Kyle has been in Hollywood taping a game-show pilot where he had to compete against other contestants blindfolded and correctly identify vacuum models, the newspaper said on Saturday. He said he got his first working model at age 3 and keeps part of his collection in his room.

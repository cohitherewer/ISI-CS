 Naomis deep sense of shame

 Destructive

 New York, March 1 (AP): Naomi Campbell says she very much regrets losing her temper and hitting her maid with her cellphone over a pair of missing jeans last year.

 I felt very remorseful for having thrown the phone at someone that didnt deserve it, the 35-year-old supermodel tells the TV show Extra in an interview. I have a deep sense of shame for the things Ive done.

 What made her do it? It was tiredness, lack of sleep (and) just so many things, she says. I was being really destructive to myself... I didnt know how to reach out, she says. It was a really scary time. Campbell pleaded guilty to misdemeanour assault last month for hitting Ana Scolavino in the back of the head with the phone last March. Scolavino was treated for a head injury.

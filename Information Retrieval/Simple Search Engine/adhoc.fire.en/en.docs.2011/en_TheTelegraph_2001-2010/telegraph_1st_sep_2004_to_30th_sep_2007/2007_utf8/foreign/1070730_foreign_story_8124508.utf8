 Martin weds

 Los Angeles, July 29 (AP): US actor Steve Martin married girlfriend Anne Stringfield during a ceremony at his Los Angeles home yesterday, his publicist has said.

 Former Nebraska senator Bob Kerrey presided over the ceremony, while Lorne Michaels, creator of the US comedy show Saturday Night Live, was Martins best man.

 It was the first marriage for Stringfield, 35, a writer and former staff for The New Yorker magazine. Martin, 61, was previously married to actress Victoria Tennant,whom he divorced in 1994 after about eight years together.

 Most of the roughly 75 guests including actors Tom Hanks, Diane Keaton, Eugene Levy and Carl Reiner were not told that Martin and Stringfield would wed when they were invited to his home for a party, the spokesperson said. The ensuing nuptials were a surprise to them.

 to rob an Australian fish and chip shop found himself on 

 the losing side when the angry shop owner threw fish batter 

 and hot oil at him. The hot oil missed but the batter 

 hit the offender and he fled empty handed, South Australian 

 police said in a statement about the armed robbery attempt 

 at the seaside town of Victor Harbour, near Adelaide.

 Old scout 

 Fort Myers, Florida (AP): More than half a century after he finished the requirements to earn the rank, an 88-year-old man was honoured as an Eagle Scout on Saturday, making him possibly the oldest person ever to collect the honour. Walter Hart couldnt become an Eagle Scout at the time he earned the rank, because his service in World War II got in the way.

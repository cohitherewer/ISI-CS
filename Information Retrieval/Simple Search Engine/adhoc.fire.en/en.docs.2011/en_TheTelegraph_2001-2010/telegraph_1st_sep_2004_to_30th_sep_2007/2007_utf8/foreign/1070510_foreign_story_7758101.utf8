 Scientists compile site of life

 Bonn, May 9 (Reuters): From apples to zebras, all 1.8 million known plant and animal species will be listed in an Internet-based Encyclopedia of Life under a $100 million project, scientists said yesterday.

 The 10-year scheme, launched with initial grants of $12.5 million from two US-based foundations, could aid everyone from children with biology homework to governments planning how to protect endangered species. 

 The Encyclopedia of Life plans to create an entry for every named species, James Edwards, executive director of the project which is backed by many leading research institutions, told Reuters. At the moment thats 1.8 million.

 The free Encyclopedia would focus mainly on animals, plants and fungi with microbes to follow, blending text, photographs, maps and videos in a common format for each. Expansion of the Internet in recent years made the multi-media project possible.

 Demonstration pages at http://www.eol.org include entries about polar bears, rice, death cap mushrooms and a yeti crab with hairy claws found in the South Pacific.

 Chaudhry show hits Faisalabad

 Chakwal (Pakistan), June 16 (Reuters): Pakistans suspended chief justice travelled into the Pakistani heartland today to a tumultuous welcome from Opposition supporters.

 Chaudhry was scheduled to deliver an address to lawyers, but his convoy of dozens of vehicles had all the hallmarks of an Opposition roadshow.

 Accompanied by lawyers and Opposition supporters waving flags from their cars, Chaudhry made several stops in sun-baked Punjab farming towns as they headed for the textile city of Faisalabad. Thousands of supporters lined roads and threw rose petals as Chaudhrys caravan inched its way through towns.

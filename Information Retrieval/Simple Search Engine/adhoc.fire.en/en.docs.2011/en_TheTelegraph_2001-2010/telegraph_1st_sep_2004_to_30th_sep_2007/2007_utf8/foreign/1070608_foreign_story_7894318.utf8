 Colombo Tamils evicted

 Colombo, June 7 (Reuters): Sri Lanka evicted hundreds of ethnic Tamils from the capital today citing security concerns.

 Police packed 376 minority Tamils deemed without valid reasons to be in the capital into buses, most of them headed towards the northern district of Vavuniya.

 Rohan Abeywardene, inspector general of police for Colombo, said the ethnic Tamils were being sent back to their own villages for their own safety amid a rash of abductions blamed on state security services and Tamil Tiger rebels. Some people who had no valid reasons to be in Colombo, they have been requested to leave and told they had better get back to their own villages, he said.

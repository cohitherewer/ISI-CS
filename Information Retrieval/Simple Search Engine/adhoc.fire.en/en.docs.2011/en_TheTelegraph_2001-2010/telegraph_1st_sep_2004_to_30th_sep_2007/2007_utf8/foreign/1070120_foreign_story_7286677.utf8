 Lanka army seizes key Tiger town

 Colombo, Jan. 19 (Reuters): Sri Lankas military captured a strategic rebel-held town in the islands restive east today as more than 10,000 refugees fled the area and Tamil Tiger rebels cut a retreat after weeks under siege.

 The capture of Vakarai a town around 240 km northeast of Colombo that belongs to the rebels under the terms of a tattered 2002 ceasefire comes after weeks of fierce fighting between the Tigers and the military, who have vowed to evict them from the east altogether. Vakarai has fallen, said military spokesman Brigadier Prasad Samarasinghe. They are withdrawing to the north.

 We are checking the civilians who are fleeing in case the Tigers have infiltrated them and try to come and attack government areas, he added. We want to help the civilians get back to resettle there immediately.

 There was little in the way of resistance, aside from some small arms and mortar fire. The military had recovered one rebel body so far, while nine other Tiger fighters were killed in a separate clash further south in Batticaloa.

 The LTTE said in a statement on their website (www.ltteps.org) that they had decided to readjust their positions in the east and pull back. The Tigers accused the military of preventing aid from reaching the trapped civilians.

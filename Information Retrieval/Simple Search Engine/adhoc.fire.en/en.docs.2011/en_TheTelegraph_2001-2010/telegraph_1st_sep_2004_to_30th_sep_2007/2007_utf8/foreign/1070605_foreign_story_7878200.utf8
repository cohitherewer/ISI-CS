 Defiant Putin raises spectre of nuclear war

 BRONWEN MADDOX

 Tough talk 

 Moscow, June 4: President Putin has warned the US that its deployment of a new anti-missile network across eastern Europe would prompt Russia to point its own missiles at European targets and could trigger a nuclear war.

 In an exclusive interview with The Times. the Russian leader says: It is obvious that if part of the strategic nuclear potential of the US is located in Europe and will be threatening us, we will have to respond. This system of missile defence on one side and the absence of this system on the other... increases the possibility of unleashing a nuclear conflict.

 Russia has been alarmed at Americas plans to install a network of defences in eastern Europe to shoot down incoming missiles it fears that Iran might launch.

 Putin expressed scepticism of this motive, arguing that there are no such missiles Iran does not have missiles with the range. The US was insisting, he said, that the defence system was to be installed for the protection from something that does not exist. Is it not sort of funny? It would be funny if it were not so sad.

 He speculated that the USs real motive was to provoke Russias retaliation and so to avoid further closeness of Russia and Europe.

 Putins tough warning comes days before the start of the G8 meeting of the worlds most powerful industrialised economies.

 His uncompromising stand on Americas missile defence, Kosovo, Iran and climate change was partly blamed for the failure of last months summit between Russia and the EU.

 Putin had warm words for the cordial reception that Tony Blair had given him, and for Gordon Brown, a high-class specialist. But he offered little room for compromise on Britains request for the extradition of Andrei Lugovoy, the former intelligence officer, wanted on charges of the murder of dissident former agent Alexander Litvinenko by radioactive poisoning in London.

 No matter from what angle we look at this problem, its all stupid, stupid nonsense, he said of Britains extradition request. I will not see any single positive component. Its complete nonsense.

 Putin insisted that he wants co-operation not confrontation, repeatedly blaming the US for its intransigence. But of all the potential clashes at the G8 meeting, which begins on Wednesday in Germany, it is his warnings on Russian retaliation to the US missile defence plans that are likely to cause the greatest friction.

 He called on our American friends to rethink their decision and warned that we cannot be responsible for our reciprocal steps because it is not us who are initiating an arms race in Europe.

 Putin threatened that in retaliation, 

 Russia might stop complying with agreements to reduce conventional 

 forces.

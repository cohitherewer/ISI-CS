 US host calls guest petty

 New York, Sept. 24: Greeted by large protests and jabs from local politicians and US presidential candidates, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad faced a public skewering yesterday at the first stop of his three-day trip.

 As he prepared to deliver a speech at Columbia University, the universitys president, Lee Bollinger, introduced the Iranian leader as a man who appeared to lack intellectual courage, had a fanatical mind-set and may be astonishingly undereducated.

 Mr President, you exhibit all the signs of a petty and cruel dictator, Bollinger told Ahmadinejad from a lectern across the stage. He said that Ahmadinejads past denials of the Holocaust might fool the illiterate and ignorant but that when you come to a place like this, it makes you quite simply ridiculous.

 A leader known to live largely protected from criticism at home, Ahmadinejad appeared shocked and insulted. He chastised Bollinger for judging his speech before it had even begun and suggested that such a move was unforgivable in a university setting.

 Ahmadinejad, who in the past has argued that Israel should be wiped off the map, repeated his assertions that the Holocaust should be researched from different perspectives and said Palestinians should not be paying the price for an event they had nothing to do with. 

 The Iranian leader also blasted US sanctions against his country, insisted on Irans right to nuclear development and declared his willingness to dialogue with US leaders.

 The war of words at Columbia was, in many ways, a herald of Ahmadinejads unwelcome reception in New York, a city both scarred by terrorism and at the heart of American Judaism. 

 The controversy began even before the Iranian leader landed on Sunday night for a three-day trip on the occasion of the UN General Assembly.

 As it does for many a dignitary, New York, home to the UN, provided extra security for Ahmadinejad along with the US Secret Service and Iranian security. But luminaries, leaders and the local media made it abundantly clear that much of New York is holding its nose while Ahmadinejad is in town.

 The Evil Has Landed, declared the New York Daily News alongside a mug-shot-like photo of Ahmadinejad. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg minced no words. I happen to find his views disgusting, disgraceful, abhorrent, he said.

 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined a host of presidential candidates in blasting Ahmadinejad, and Columbia for even asking him to speak. If I were the president of a university, I would not have invited him, Clinton told CNN. Hes a Holocaust denier.

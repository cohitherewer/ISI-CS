 Lanka clash

 Colombo, March 29 (Reuters): Sri Lankas navy said today it sank three Tamil Tiger boats off the islands northeast coast, killing over 20 insurgents, but the rebels denied they lost any vessels and said just one fighter died.

 The attack came late on Wednesday off the coast of the rebel-held northeastern district of Mullaithivu.

 A naval patrol had come across about 10 Tiger boats and our boats launched an attack, a navy spokesman said. We were able to destroy three rebel craft, he added.

 Our people say none of our boats were damaged, but they say two navy Dvora were badly damaged, a Tiger official said.

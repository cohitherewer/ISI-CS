 EMI, Apple deal

 London, April 2: Troubled music giant EMI has struck a landmark agreement with Apple that will allow users to download its songs without copyright protection software.

 The accord comes two months after Steve Jobs, chief executive of Apple, asked record companies to remove software that prevents songs downloaded at Apples iTunes website to be then played on devices other than Apples own iPod.

 Eric Nicoli, the chief executive of EMI, said: By providing DRM-free downloads, we aim to address the lack of interoperability which is frustrating for many music fans. It has also been frustrating for EMIs shareholders. Nicoli has been under enormous pressure to refashion EMIs digital strategy as sales of CDs continue to slide. Apple said today it will charge 99pence for songs from EMIs repetoire that have had the digital-rights management software, or DRM, removed. The tracks will also come with better sound quality, according to Apple.

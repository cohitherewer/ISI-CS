 Brockovich

Sydney, Aug. 6 (AFP): US environmental campaigner Erin Brockovich said today she would consider launching a lawsuit against a mine in Western Australia which has been linked to a range of health problems.

 It would be the first time that Brockovich, who became famous as an anti-pollution campaigner after a film was made about her life starring Julia Roberts, has taken a case in Australia.

 Brockovich said she had been contacted by a resident from the southwestern town of Yarloop, where emissions from Alcoas Wagerup refinery have been linked to a range of health problems over the past 11 years.

 About 160 residents have complained of symptoms including respiratory difficulties, skin irritation, sore throats and eyes, extreme fatigue, mental dysfunction, upset stomachs, nose bleeds, cancers and organ failure.

 They believe emissions from the plant caused these health problems.

 Alcoa denies that the refinery is responsible, saying the facility has been deemed safe for employees and neighbouring communities.

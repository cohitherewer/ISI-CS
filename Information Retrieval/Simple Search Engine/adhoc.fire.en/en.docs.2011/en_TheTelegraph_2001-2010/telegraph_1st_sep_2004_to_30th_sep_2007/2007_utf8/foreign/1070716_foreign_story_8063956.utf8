 Taliban supporters abandon peace deal

 Miran Shah, Pakistan, July 15 (Reuters): Pro-Taliban militants in Pakistans restive North Waziristan tribal region today announced they were pulling out of a peace deal with the government, accusing authorities of violating the pact.

 North Waziristan is a hotbed of support for al Qaida and Taliban militants and authorities signed a peace deal with the local fighters in September in a bid to marginalise their foreign allies.

 The Taliban are forced to announce the end of the agreement, the leadership council or shura of the militants said in a statement issued in Miranshah, the main town of North Waziristan.

 Under the pact, authorities agreed to stop military operations against the militants in return for their pledge that they would not send fighters across the border into Afghanistan and would not launch attacks on security forces and government officials in North Waziristan.

 The shura said the security forces had launched several attacks on militants since then. The militants also said the government had violated the agreement by deploying more troops in the region.

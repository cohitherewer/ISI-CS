 Asian stoned to death

 Kampala, April 12 (Reuters): A mob stoned to death an Asian man in Uganda today and two other people were killed during a protest over a plan to cut down nearly a third of a rainforest reserve to grow sugarcane, police and witnesses said.

 Troops in armoured cars were deployed in central Kampala after police fired tear gas and bullets to stop rioters attacking Asian businesses and a temple, angered by moves to expand an Indian-owned companys sugar plantations. The capitals police commander, Edward Ochom, said three people were dead.

 One is an Asian man who was stoned to death by the rioters. The other two are Ugandans and we are still investigating their deaths, he said.

 As scores of demonstrators hurled rocks at police in pouring rain, officers rescued more than 100 Asian men besieged in a temple and elsewhere, and rushed them to a police station. Dozens were arrested.

 We were inside the temple and the protesters started attacking us from outside, 50-year-old Dipaul Patel said. It was very frightening.

 Ugandas police chief, Major-General Kale Kayihura, told the sheltering group anyone targeting them would in turn be targeted by his force. The scenes outside were a sharp reminder of 1972, when the late former dictator Idi Amin expelled Ugandas Asians.

 Thousands have returned, but are viewed with suspicion by some Ugandans who resent their domination of many businesses. One Indian supermarket owner who gave his name as Kumar said rioters pulled him from his motorbike then beat him.

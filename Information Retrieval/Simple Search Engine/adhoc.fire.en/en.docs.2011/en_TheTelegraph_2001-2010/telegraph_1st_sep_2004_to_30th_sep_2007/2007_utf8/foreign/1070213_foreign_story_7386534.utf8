The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Madrid bar on 5 thin models

 - Skinny out , counterfeit sneaks in 

 Madrid, Feb. 12 (Reuters): Five models were declared too thin for the catwalk at this weeks international designer show in Madrid, a doctor in charge of vetting them said yesterday.

 Last year, Madrids Cibeles became the first high profile parade to bar models whose ratio of body weight to height was so low it was deemed an unhealthy example to the public. The idea of weighing models who are on show here and making sure they look healthy is so that they do not have a negative influence by prompting young people to become obsessed by being thin, doctor Susana Monereo said.

 The other 64 models who were checked had enough fat on them to take part, including one who was banned in September for being too boney.

 I didnt want to be obsessed with my weight, but I did what I could and Ive achieved it, Maria Campoy, a model who was rejected last time for having a body mass index of below 18, said.

 Bangla fugitive held in US

 Ahmed: Caught

 Washington, March 15 (PTI): Former Bangladesh army officer Mohiuddin A.K.M. Ahmed, wanted for his role in the 1975 military coup which led to the assassination of former President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, has been arrested in the US.

 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials arrested 60-year-old Ahmed from his residence in Los Angeles on Tuesday. 

 In 1998, the Bangladesh high court convicted Ahmed in absentia for his role in the coup and assassination of Rahman and sentenced him to death. President Rahman was slain on August 15, 1975, along with his wife and several family members.

 Doomsday Clock closer to apocalypse

 London, Jan. 17 (AP): The world has nudged closer to a nuclear apocalypse and environmental disaster, a trans-Atlantic group of prominent scientists warned today, as it pushed the giant hand of its Doomsday Clock two minutes closer to midnight.

 It was the fourth time since the end of the Cold War that the clock has ticked forward, this time from 11:53 to 11:55, amid fears over what the scientists are describing as a second nuclear age prompted largely by the nuclear standoffs with Iran and North Korea.

 The dangers posed by climate change are nearly as dire as those posed by nuclear weapons, the organisation said. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, founded in 1945 as a newsletter distributed among nuclear physicists concerned by the possibility of nuclear war, has since grown into an organisation focused more generally on man-made threats to the survival of human civilisation.

 As scientists, we understand the dangers of nuclear weapons and their devastating effects, and we are learning how human activities and technologies are affecting climate systems in ways that may forever change life on Earth, said Prof. Stephen Hawking, the renowned cosmologist and mathematician.

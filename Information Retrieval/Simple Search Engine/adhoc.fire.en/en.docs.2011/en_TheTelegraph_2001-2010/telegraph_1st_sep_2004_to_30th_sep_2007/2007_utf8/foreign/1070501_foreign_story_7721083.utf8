 Speed cubers 

 New York, April 30 (Reuters): Theres an old game in town that is creating a new class of celebrities: speed cubers who can solve the Rubiks Cube puzzle blindfolded, one-handed or even with their feet.

 Mao, perhaps the biggest name in speed cubing, taught actor Will Smith how to solve the brightly coloured cube for the film The Pursuit of Happyness.

 Shotaro Makisumi is a math prodigy so dexterous he can juggle seven balls at once. And Leyan Lo, a senior at California Institute of Technology, was featured on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.

 Snake mail

 Brasilia (Reuters): Postal workers in a Brazilian border town knew there was something suspicious about shipments from Argentina and were stunned to find scorpions and poisonous snakes in the express mail.

 Television stations broadcast images of brightly coloured tropical snakes, iguanas, tortoises and lizards, coiled and stuffed into plastic containers, the kind typically used for takeaway orders at the deli counter.

 Bangkok, July 2 (Reuters): One billion people will die of tobacco-related diseases this century unless governments in rich and poor countries alike get serious about preventing smoking, top World Health Organisation (WHO) experts said today.

 Tobacco is a defective product. It kills half of its customers, Douglas Bettcher, head of the WHOs Tobacco Free Initiative, said at the start of an international conference in Bangkok to draw up a masterplan for the world to kick the habit.

 It kills 5.4 million people per year and half of those deaths are in developing countries. Thats like one jumbo jet going down every hour, he said. With smoking rates in many developing countries on the rise, particularly among teenagers, that annual death toll would rise to 8.3 million within the next 20 years, he added.

 However, if governments introduced measures such as aggressive taxation, banning cigarette advertising and making offices and public places totally tobacco-free, smoking rates could halve by 2050, he said. Its a completely preventable epidemic, Bettcher said, citing countries such as Singapore, Australia and Thailand where tough anti-smoking laws have helped people to quit.

 Officials from 147 countries are attending the week-long conference, which is likely to agree on binding laws against cross-border tobacco advertising a move against events such as Formula One car racing as well as tougher legislation against cigarette smuggling. 

 Around 600 billion cigarettes were smuggled in 2006 11 per cent of the worlds consumption according to the Framework Convention Alliance (FAC), an umbrella group of hundreds of anti-tobacco organisations.

 As well as keeping the prices artificially low and thereby stimulating demand, the counterfeit cigarette industry also deprives governments of more than $40 billion in missed taxes, the FCA estimates. In Thailand, smoking rates have fallen from 30 per cent in 1992 to around 18 per cent, a decline health officials attribute to a ban on all domestic tobacco advertising 15 years ago. The most important medicines in tobacco control are: number one, increasing taxation; number two, bans on advertising; and number three, smoke-free public places, said Hatai Chitanondh of the Thailand Health Promotion Institute.

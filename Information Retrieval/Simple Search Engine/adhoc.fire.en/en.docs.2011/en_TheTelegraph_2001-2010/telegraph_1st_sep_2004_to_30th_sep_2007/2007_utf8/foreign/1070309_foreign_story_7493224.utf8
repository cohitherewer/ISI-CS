 Maoists to return assets

 J. HEMANTH 

 Strict order

 Kathmandu, March 8: Maoist chief Prachanda today formally urged his party cadre to return all seized private properties to their legitimate owners and desist from displaying weapons in public. 

 In a statement issued here this afternoon, Prachanda also asked his party colleagues to strictly follow all agreements with the government. 

 The November 21 agreement should be implemented in letter and spirit to achieve our ultimate goal of holding Constituent Assembly election by mid-June, he said.

 The Maoist chiefs statement in effect sets the stage for the rebel group to join the interim government which is to be installed by March 15. 

 The government will supervise the elections to the Constituent Assembly, which in turn will decide the form of the government and the future of the monarchy. 

 The statement comes a day after Prachanda promised Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala that he would issue a directive to his partys cadre in order to create a favourable environment for the formation of the government. 

 In his statement, the Maoist leader also asked his party colleagues to help in the rehabilitation of people who have been displaced by the decade-old conflict. 

 He also asked the government to immediately release the remaining Maoist activists from jail, publicise the status of the people who disappeared during the conflict and ensure the proper management of facilities at the Peoples Liberation Army cantonments.

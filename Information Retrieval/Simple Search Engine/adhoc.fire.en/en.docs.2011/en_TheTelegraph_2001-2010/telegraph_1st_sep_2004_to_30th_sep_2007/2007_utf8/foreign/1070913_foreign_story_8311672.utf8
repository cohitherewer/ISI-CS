 Electronic warfare with Qaida on Web

 JOBY WARRICK

 Washington, Sept. 12: Early yesterday morning, a South Carolina Web designer who works at home managed to scoop al Qaida by publicly unveiling its new video, a feat she has accomplished numerous times since 2002. 

 Within hours, cable news stations were broadcasting images of Osama bin Laden commemorating the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and crediting the 50-year-old woman, who uses the pseudonym Laura Mansfield.

 A similar event occurred on Friday, when another group beat al Qaida by nearly a full day with the release of the first video images of bin Laden to appear publicly since 2004. That group, the Site Institute, provided the tape to government agencies and news organisations at a time when many well-known jihadist websites had been shut down in a powerful cyberattack by unknown hackers.

 It was the latest round of electronic warfare between al Qaida and a small community of individuals and companies that troll the Internet for messages from terrorists as a livelihood, a personal obsession or both. 

 Often, the groups compete to be the first to find and post a new video or message. Frequently, they accomplish their goal several steps ahead of government agencies who turn to them for the material.

 Since Friday, at least three high-profile video messages have been snatched from al Qaida-affiliated websites by groups using a combination of computer tricks, personal connections and ingenuity to find and download password-protected content. 

 For some, it is a mission rife with contradictions: They maintain that they are seeking to serve their country while ensuring wide distribution of the words and images of terrorists intent on the destruction of the US. They said their aim is to undermine support for the cause by disseminating what they consider to be outrageous statements.

 Its not about bragging rights, its about the mission, said Ben Venzke, IntelCenters founder. Venzke, who claims several intelligence and military clients in the US and abroad, said there is value in giving Americans advance word of al Qaidas plans.

 Though government intelligence agencies may independently obtain the same material through their own sources, Venzke said each release of a new video triggers requests from his government subscribers. Were one of the primary sources for a lot of this stuff, he said.

 The bin Laden video that surfaced on Friday was promoted on several Islamic websites in messages posted by al Sahab, a group that produces some of al Qaidas propaganda videos. US officials now believe the video was intended for release on Saturday. But Site, which operates a website and subscription service offering access to an archive of terrorist-group materials, obtained the video nearly 24 hours ahead of the scheduled release.

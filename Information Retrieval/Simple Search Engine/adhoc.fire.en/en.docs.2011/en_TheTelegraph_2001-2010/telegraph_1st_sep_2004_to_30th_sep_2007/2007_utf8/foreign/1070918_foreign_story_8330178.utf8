 Bond ditches Aston for Bentley

 London, Sept. 17: James Bonds Aston Martin has seen him through countless scrapes and become as closely identified with him as his shaken, not stirred dry Martinis.

 But in his latest incarnation, the agent licensed to kill will trade it in for something less racy.

 In the new Bond novel, Devil May Care, 007 will conduct his missions in a Bentley. While Bond has been associated with Aston Martin since driving the DB5 model complete with retractable tyre slashers in the film of Ian Flemings novel Goldfinger, Sebastian Faulks, the author of the new book, said he would take the agent back to his motoring roots. Despite many of the films portraying him with an Aston Martin, Bonds first choice of car was a Bentley, so that is what he will be driving in my book, he said. He also spends quite a lot of time abroad on his adventure, so in want of a hire car, which wouldnt really befit James, he will also have a driver at his disposal.

 Faulks, the author of Birdsong and Charlotte Gray, said Bonds car in the novel, which is set in 1967, would be battleship grey the same colour as his Bentley convertible in Casino Royale, Flemings first Bond novel. Bonds return to Bentley will be a blow to Aston Martin, which last week topped a poll of Britains coolest brands. Inspired by the success of the recent film adaptation of Casino Royale, in which 007, played by Daniel Craig, drives an Aston Martin DB9, the cars have soared in popularity. 

 James Rosenstein, Bentleys global director of external affairs, saidBonds car could be the 1967 T-series Bentley.

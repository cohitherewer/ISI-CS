 US fully backs Wolfowitz 

 Aboard Air Force One, May 9 (Reuters): The White House today expressed continued full support for World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz, under fire over a pay and promotion deal for his companion.

 We still support him fully, White House spokesman Tony Snow told reporters as he flew with President George W. Bush to visit parts of Kansas devastated by tornadoes last week.

 Controversy over Wolfowitzs continued leadership of the World Bank has raged for weeks, pitting European critics against Bush administration officials who insist they consider the former Pentagon officials ability to guide the global lender still is effective.

 The debate has grown more heated since findings were leaked from a bank investigating panel that said he broke rules when he personally directed a promotion for his companion, World Bank West Asia expert Shaha Riza, and her transfer to the state department in 2005.

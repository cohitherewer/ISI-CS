 Viagra hope against jet lag

 Washington, May 22 (Reuters): The male impotence drug Viagra may be useful for treating jet lag as well, according to Argentine researchers who gave it to hamsters made to feel like rodent globe-trotters.

 The researchers manipulated the schedule of turning lights on and off to induce jet lag in the laboratory animals, they reported yesterday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

 Adult male hamsters given Viagra, also called sildenafil, recovered from jet lag up to 50 per cent faster than hamsters that were not given it, the researchers said.

 The scientists stopped giving the hamsters the highest dose they had been using in the experiment due to a certain side effect. 

 However, we used the intermediate dose for the rest of the experiments because at that dose animals did not manifest the effects of sildenafil-induced penile erections, they wrote.

 Flying across multiple time zones can confuse ones sleep-wake cycle, resulting in the condition called jet lag, marked by insomnia, sleepiness and difficulty concentrating.

 Researchers at the Universidad Nacional de Quilmes, Buenos Aires, gave doses of Viagra to the hamsters at night, then switched on bright lights six hours early to simulate eastbound flight.

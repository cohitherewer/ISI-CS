 Koirala plans polls in Nov

 J. HEMANTH 

 Kathmandu, May 11: Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala today announced that he was planning to hold elections to the Constituent Assembly in the third week of November. 

 Koirala told members of the Professional Alliance for Peace and Democracy at his official residence here this morning that he would finalise the schedule for the November election after consultations with leaders of the ruling eight-party coalition. 

 Though a final decision will be taken by the eight-party alliance, I am in favour of holding the poll in the third week of November, he said. 

 The Prime Minister, who has been maintaining a stoic silence over the deteriorating law and order situation in Nepal, said he would give top priority to ending violence in the country. I will focus on restoring law and order at any cost. I do not mind replacing the home minister to achieve that objective, he said. 

 After the meeting, president of the Nepal Bar Association Bishwokanta Mainali said: Let no one be under any illusion that the government is spineless. He added that the members urged the government to punish those involved in criminal activities.

 Villagers steal Maoist booty

 J. HEMANTH 

 Kathmandu, Feb. 11: The Maoists who ran amok in rural Nepal for over a decade, robbing banks and extorting money, got a taste of their own medicine when villagers stole their cache of looted valuables and money worth over Rs 3 crore in mid-western Nepal.

 According to newspaper reports, the case of the missing treasure trove came to light recently when the Maoists kidnapped three residents of Mahadevpuri village and took them deep inside a forest for interrogation.

 When outraged villagers protested, the former rebels were forced to release the three, according to the daily Kantipur.

 The villagers are believed to have stolen the cache containing 23 kilograms of gold, bundles of cash and other valuables in Dang district. The trove had been buried in the Bageshal community forest three years ago.

 According to the newspaper, the villagers dug out the treasure just a day after it was hidden underground.

 The Maoists became suspicious after some among their cadre reported that three villagers had suddenly turned wealthy and had gone on a splurge.

 The newspaper quoted the Maoist commander in the Banke area, Athak, as saying that the three villagers had owned up to the theft and named certain Maoist supporters who had apparently tipped them off about the buried loot.

 We are still investigating and hope to identify all those involved in the theft, the local Maoist chief said.

 The hidden treasure was part of the booty the Maoists had collected during a raid on a bank in Jumla three years ago, Athak said.

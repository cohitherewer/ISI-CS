 Algiers, April 11 (Reuters): Bombs killed 30 people in Algerias capital today and the al Qaida claimed that it had carried out the attacks. 

 The bombings raised fears that the north African oil exporter was slipping back into the intense political violence of the 1990s. 

 One of the blasts, believed to be a suicide bombing, ripped part of the facade off the Prime Ministers headquarters in the centre of Algiers. A second bomb hit Bab Ezzouar on its eastern outskirts, the official APS news agency said.

 The al Qaida Organisation in the Islamic Maghreb claimed responsibility for the bombings in an Internet statement, in which it also claimed responsibility for attacks in neighbouring Morocco and posted pictures of three martyrs.

 The claim could not immediately be verified but the group, formerly known as the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), has taken responsibility for a number of deadly attacks on security forces and foreigners in Algeria since January.

 Newspaper editor Mounir Boudjema said the Prime Ministers office was hit because it was Algerias World Trade Center a prestige target like the New York buildings hit in 2001. 

 Hospital sources put the toll from the two bombings at 30. Earlier, APS put the toll at 23 dead with 162 wounded. Leila Aissaoui, 25, stood crying near the government palace. I thought explosions in Algiers were over, she said.I made a big mistake and I cant accept this.

 Algeria descended into violence in 1992 after the then military-backed authorities scrapped a parliamentary election which an Islamist political party was set to win. Up to 200,000 people were killed in the ensuing bloodshed.

 Residents said today was the first time since the 1990s that a powerful bomb had hit the centre of the Mediterranean city. 

 The blast at the Prime Ministers headquarters gouged a gaping hole in the six-storey building, shattering windows and showering rubble on to cars for blocks around. Police sources said the attack was a suicide bombing.

 Prime Minister Abdelaziz Belkhadem, who has been campaigning for May 17 parliamentary elections, was quoted by APS as calling the attack a criminal and cowardly act.

 Dozens of ambulances converged on the upscale residential neighbourhood as thousands of people poured on to the streets and survivors were led from the building.

 Medics carried the bloodied and burned victims in their arms and on stretchers from the government palace.

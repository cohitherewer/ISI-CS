 Hillary charm

 Davenport (Iowa), Jan. 29 (Reuters): Hillary Rodham Clinton won new converts and thrilled old fans with a polished performance on her first campaign foray to Iowa, but left plenty of questions for Democrats evaluating the crowded field of White House contenders.

 On a two-day weekend swing across the states frozen farmlands, the New York Senator charmed big crowds of curious Democrats, laughed at herself, patiently signed autographs, posed for photos and talked at length about issues from health care to education. I was a little surprised, she seemed more down to earth than I expected. She seemed to be talking to Iowans she didnt seem aloof or reserved at all, said Ted Childers, a retired Sears sales manager in Davenport.

 But one year before Iowa kicks off the 2008 presidential race with the first nominating contest, many Democrats said they needed to see and hear more of the former First Lady before they made up their minds.

 Questions about the viability of her historic attempt to become the first woman President, about her 2002 vote to authorise the Iraq war and about her sometimes polarising effect on voters were never far from the surface. 

 Joe Wathan of Durant, Iowa, said after her appearance in Davenport he wondered if Clinton would be able to negotiate on a level playing field with male world leaders. I have my concerns about if shell be able to handle it being a woman, and not because she doesnt have the knowledge or ability but whether shell get the respect from a man, he said.

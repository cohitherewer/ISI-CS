 Dowdy Sharon

 Berlin, Feb. 12 (AP): Sharon Stone plays a depressed, taciturn and somewhat dowdy wife in her latest film, which premiered today at the Berlin film festival a role that the star says she found cathartic.

 When A Man Falls In The Forest, from young American director Ryan Eslinger, is one of 22 movies competing for the top Golden Bear award at the festival. Stone, 48, was an executive producer on the film.

 Stones Karen is one of four main characters in the episodic drama an unhappy wife who turns to shoplifting sprees to bring some excitement into her life. It helped me to understand a lot of emotion that I had previously not been able to understand in myself, Stone said.

 Deo alarm

 Berlin (Reuters): A group of 

 young German women used so much spray deodorant in the bathroom 

 of a North Sea youth hostel that it set off a fire alarm 

 and brought the local fire brigade rushing to the rescue, 

 police said on Monday. The fumes of the pleasant-smelling 

 deodorant were so intense that they drifted up to the ceiling 

 and set off a fire detector, said Volker Buttgereit 

 of the Buesum police force. Local authorities said they 

 were also surprised the heavy use of deodorant could set 

 off the alarm.

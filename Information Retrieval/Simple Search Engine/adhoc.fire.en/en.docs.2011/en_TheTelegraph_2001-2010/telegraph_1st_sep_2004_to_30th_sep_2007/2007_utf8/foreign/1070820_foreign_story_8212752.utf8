 Harry asks, Chelsy says yes

 Harry and Chelsy: When is the official engagement? 

 London, Aug. 19 (PTI): Prince Harry has asked his girlfriend Chelsy Davy to marry him and she has agreed, a newspaper has said. 

 The couple declared their love for each other when they were on a recent safari break in Botswana, the Sunday Mirror reported today. However, they do not intend to become officially engaged until Chelsy finishes her studies and Harry has seen active army service overseas. 

 Harry and Chelsy are serious about each other and are both keen to make more of a commitment. Neither of them can imagine living without the other, (but) it will be 18 months down the line before they go public about their engagement, a friend of the prince was quoted as saying. 

 By then, Harry, 22, is likely to have a desk job in Britain and Chelsy recovering from an emergency appendix operation on Thursday will have finished her course in politics at Leeds University.

 The 21-year-old Zimbawean-born Chelsy has recently applied for a postgraduate degree at the university in west Yorkshire, famous for its nightlife, so she can be closer to Harry, the third in line to the English throne.

 The couple have lived on separate continents since they met in 2004, meeting only for holidays.

 There is also speculation that Harrys brother William could propose to his girlfriend Kate Middleton.

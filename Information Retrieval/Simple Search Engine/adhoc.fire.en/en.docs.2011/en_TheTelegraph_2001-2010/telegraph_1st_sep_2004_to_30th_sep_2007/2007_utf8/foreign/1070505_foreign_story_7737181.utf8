 Iran-US meet

 Sharm el-Sheikh (Egypt), May 4 (Reuters): Senior US and Iranian officials met at a crucial international conference on Iraq today but mediators failed to arrange a meeting at a higher level between the two old foes.

 The meeting in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh was another step away from the Bush administrations longstanding policy of avoiding contact with governments which actively oppose its policies in West Asia.

 US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice met Syrian foreign minister Walid al-Moualem in Sharm el-Sheikh yesterday the first contact at this level in more than two years.

 Rice said that if she had had the chance she would also have met Iranian foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki.

 The opportunity simply didnt arise for the foreign minister of Iran and me to meet... I would have taken that opportunity, she said.

 Iraqi foreign minister Hoshiyar Zebari welcomed the lower level US-Iran meeting as a a positive sign.

 There is a lot of suspicion. There is a lot of mistrust. But it is in my countrys interest really to see a reduction of this tension, he told a news conference.

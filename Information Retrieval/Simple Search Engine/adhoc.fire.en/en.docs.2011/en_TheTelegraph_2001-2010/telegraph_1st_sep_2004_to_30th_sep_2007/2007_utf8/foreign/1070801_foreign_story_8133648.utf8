 Antonioni, symbol of art-house cinema, dies 

 Hero of the highbrows

 Rome,

 July 31 (AP): Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni, whose depiction of alienation made him a symbol of art-house cinema with movies such as Blow-Up and LAvventura, has died, officials and news reports said today. He was 94.

 His death comes one day after Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman died at his home on the Faro island in the Baltic Sea. He was 89.

 The ANSA news agency said that Antonioni died at his home this evening. With Antonioni dies not only one of the greatest directors but also a master of modernity, Rome mayor Walter Veltroni said in a statement.

 Antonioni depicted alienation in the modern world through sparse dialogue and long takes. Along with Federico Fellini, he helped turn post-war Italian film away from the Neorealism movement and toward a personal cinema of imagination.

 In 1995, Hollywood honoured his career work about 25 films and several screenplays with a special Oscar for lifetime achievement. By then Antonioni was a physically frail but mentally sharp 82, unable to speak but a few words because of a stroke but still translating his vision into film. The Oscar was stolen from Antonionis home in 1996.

 His slow-moving camera never became synonymous with box-office success, but some of his movies such Blow-Up, Red Desert and The Passenger reached enduring fame. His exploration of such intellectual themes as alienation and existential malaise led Halliwells Film Guide to say that LAvventura, Antonionis first critical success, made him a hero of the highbrows.

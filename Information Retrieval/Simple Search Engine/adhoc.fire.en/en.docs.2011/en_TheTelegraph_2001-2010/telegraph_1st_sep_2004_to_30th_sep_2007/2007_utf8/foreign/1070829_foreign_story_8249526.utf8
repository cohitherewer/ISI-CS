 Lonely pranks

 Tokyo, Aug. 28 (Reuters): A Japanese man arrested for making 388 prank phone calls to the local fire station between May 2006 and July this year said he did it because he was lonely.

 I live by myself and I was sad. I like the fire services and the police so I called them. I wanted them to come and look after me, the 58-year-old man was quoted as saying by the daily Yomiuri newspaper.

 The Yomiuri said the man would phone the fire station shouting: Fire! Fire! Ive set petrol and kerosene alight! 

 After one such call in early July, local emergency services dispatched 10 fire engines, one ambulance and 35 firemen to the mans house, the Yomiuri reported.

 Tax cheat

 Paris (Reuters): A French tax official cheated the government out of 600,000 euros by creating a phantom identity as a university professor and claiming a salary for some 15 years, the government said on Monday. Education ministry officials uncovered the scam in June and began legal and disciplinary action immediately, budget minister Eric Woerth said, adding that he wanted action to be taken urgently.

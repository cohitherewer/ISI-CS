 Koirala attacks Maoist youth wing

 J HEMANTH 

 Kathmandu, June 4: Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala today issued a stern warning to the Maoist youth wing saying that his government would prosecute all those who take the law into their own hands. 

 Speaking at a reception hosted for prominent industrialists at his official residence here this evening, Koirala described the Maoist-affiliated Young Communist League (YCL) as Young Criminal League and said his government would not tolerate the organisations unlawful activities. Let it be understood that I will not tolerate any unruly behaviour by the YCL. I have already instructed the authorities to punish all those who are terrorising the people, he said. 

 Referring to the kidnapping of a businessman by the YCL in Kathmandu yesterday, Koirala said that such acts will not go unpunished. The YCL has no business to take the law into its own hands, he said adding that the incident was deplorable. 

 YCL activists abducted former chairman of Nepal Cottage and Small Industries Development Bank Sita Ram Prasain last evening and handed him over to Kathmandu police during a press conference this afternoon. 

 The youths said they had abducted Prasain after the police failed to arrest him for his alleged involvement in financial irregularities. The outfits Kathmandu chief Sagar said Prasain had owned up to defrauding the bank after being grilled by the Maoist youth outfit members.

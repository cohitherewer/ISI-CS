 Men stare more at faces in nude snaps 

 Atlanta, June 20 (AP): Men are more likely to look at a womans face before other areas when shown naked pictures, according to a study by Emory University researchers.

 Women will look at pictures of heterosexual sex longer than men, the study found. Both findings, published in the journal Hormones and Behavior, make sense psychologically, Emory psychologist Kim Wallen told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

 Wallen and his former graduate student, Heather Rupp, showed still photos of couples having sex to 30 women and 15 men between the ages of 23 and 28. Each was rigged up with a high-tech eye-tracking device to measure where his or her gaze went first, and how long it stayed there. Men went straight to the face and lingered awhile, but most of the women were more interested in the sexual activity. How much depended on whether they were taking hormone-filled birth control pills.

 Those who were, Wallen said, were interested in the overall view of the photos.

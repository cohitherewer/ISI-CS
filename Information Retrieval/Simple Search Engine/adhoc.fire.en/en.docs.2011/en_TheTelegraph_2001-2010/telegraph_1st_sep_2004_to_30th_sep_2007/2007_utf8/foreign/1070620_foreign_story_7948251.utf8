 Vatican rules to curb road rage

 Vatican City, June 19 (Reuters): Thou shall not drive under the influence of alcohol. Thou shall respect speed limits. Thou shall not consider a car an object of personal glorification or use it as a place of sin.

 The Vatican took a break from strictly theological matters today to issue its own rules of the road, a compendium of dos and donts on the moral aspects of driving and motoring.

 A 36-page document called Guidelines for the Pastoral Care of the Road contains 10 Commandments covering everything from road rage, respecting pedestrians, keeping a car in good shape and avoiding rude gestures while behind the wheel.

 Cars tend to bring out the primitive side of human beings, thereby producing rather unpleasant results, the document said.

 It appealed to what it called the noble tendencies of the human spirit, urging responsibility and self-control to prevent the psychological regression often associated with driving.

 The documents Fifth Commandment reads: Cars shall not be for you an expression of power and domination, and an occasion of sin.

 US-Cuba food meet

 Havana, May 27 (Reuters): Cuba expects to sign deals worth $150 million with American food producers at talks starting tomorrow that point to sustained US interest in the Cuban market despite political hurdles.

 One US farm state delegation after another has gone to Havana this year to pitch sales of wheat, corn, beans, peas, lentils, chicken and other products needed by communist Cuba to feed its people.

 US sales to Cuba are allowed on a cash-only basis under an exception to the embargo enforced against Castros government since 1962.

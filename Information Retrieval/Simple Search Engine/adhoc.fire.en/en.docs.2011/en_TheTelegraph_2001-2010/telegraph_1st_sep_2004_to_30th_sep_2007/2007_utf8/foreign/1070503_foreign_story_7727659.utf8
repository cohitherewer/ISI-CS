 Dhaka defies blasts

 Dhaka, May 2 (Reuters): Commuters flooded back to Bangladesh railway stations today, a day after simultaneous bomb blasts rocked three terminals and raised a security alarm across the country.

 Police said they believed the blasts in Dhaka, the port city of Chittagong and northeastern Sylhet, which slightly injured a rickshaw puller, were not intended to kill anybody but to announce the presence of an Islamist group in the country.

 Two metal sheets found at the bomb sites in Dhaka and Sylhet city were scribbled with militant slogans. One sheet was signed al Qaida network while the other was signed Zadid (new) al Qaida, police said.

 In the slogans, written in Bangla, the militants threatened to blow up non-governmental organisations unless they pronounced Prophet Hazrat Mohammed as the worlds superman and also warned the small Ahmadiyya Muslim sect of similar consequences.

 The Ahmadiyyas refuse to accept Prophet Mohammed as Islams final prophet, contrary to the beliefs of the Sunnis, and claim their founder to be a prophet.

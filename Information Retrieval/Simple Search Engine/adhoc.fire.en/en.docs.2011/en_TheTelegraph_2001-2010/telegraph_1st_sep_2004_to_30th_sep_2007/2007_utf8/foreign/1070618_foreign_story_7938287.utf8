 Hasina hints at party revamp

 Dhaka, June 17 (Reuters): Bangladeshs former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina today hinted that she would reform her party, responding to calls that it should be run more democratically and less like an autocracy.

 Hasina now takes all decisions for the Awami League, without holding general meetings to form policy. She has been criticised for promoting family members above party leaders to secure her control over the party. 

 She has told party leaders that under a reform programme, being worked out now, no top party officials would be able to take up ministerial posts if the party won a poll.

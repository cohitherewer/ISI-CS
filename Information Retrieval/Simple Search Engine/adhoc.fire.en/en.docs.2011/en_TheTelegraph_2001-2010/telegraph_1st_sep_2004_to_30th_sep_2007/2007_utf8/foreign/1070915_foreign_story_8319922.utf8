 Germany to lift Cruise ban 

 Patriotic line

 Berlin, Sept. 14 (Reuters): The makers of a movie starring US actor Tom Cruise about a failed plot to kill Adolf Hitler will most likely be allowed to use a German memorial site after all, a spokesman for the finance ministry said today.

 The ministry had said it would not allow the filmmakers to use the site because its dignity had to be protected.

 But a letter from the co-producer describing a sequence from the beginning of the movie may have prompted a change of heart.

 It draws a line from todays, democratic Germany to the memorial site where the (conspirators) were shot, the spokesman said. 

 The site in question is the Bendlerblock memorial inside the defence ministry complex in Berlin. This is where Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, played by Cruise, and his co-conspirators hatched the plot and where he and his closest comrades were executed when it failed.

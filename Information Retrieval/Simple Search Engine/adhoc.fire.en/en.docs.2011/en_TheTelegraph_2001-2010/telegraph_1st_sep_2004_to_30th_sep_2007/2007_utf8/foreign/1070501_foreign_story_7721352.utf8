 Olmert probe heat

 Jerusalem, April 30 (Reuters): Israels Lebanon war commission levelled scathing criticism against Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in an interim report today that cast doubt on his political future but did not call on him to resign.

 Olmert made up his mind hastily to launch the air, sea and land campaign last July against Hizbollah guerrillas, the government-appointed panel said, accusing him of a serious failure in exercising judgment, responsibility and prudence.

 His declared aims in going to war, to free two soldiers and crush the Hizbollah, were overly ambitious and impossible to achieve, it said.

 I have no intention of resigning, Olmert was quoted by Israeli television as telling members of his Kadima party after the report was released.

 Freedom for anti-Pervez leader

 Lahore, Aug. 4 (AP): Pakistani Opposition leader Javed Hashmi was released from prison after four years to a rapturous welcome from hundreds of supporters today and immediately vowed to resume his political campaign against President Pervez Musharraf.

 Hashmi, the acting president of exiled former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs party, was freed a day after the supreme court granted him bail. Hashmi had been sentenced to 23 years in prison for treason and for trying to incite a mutiny against Musharraf.

 Rights and Opposition groups criticised the charges as politically motivated. The supreme court agreed to release him on a bail 50,000 rupees ($800) while it considers his application for the case to be reviewed. Hashmi was one of the most outspoken critics of Musharraf since the army general ousted Sharif and seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999. 

 Hashmi was greeted by supporters from Sharifs party, the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), who cheered and waved green-coloured banners when he emerged late this afternoon from the Kotlakhpat prison in Lahore, Pakistans second-largest city. 

 He was flanked by party officials and former President Rafique Tarar. The crowd rushed towards Hashmi, draped a flower garland around his neck and helped him climb on top of a four-wheel drive vehicle for a slow procession through Lahore to a Muslim shrine in the city.

 My fight was for the restoration of democracy, and the true freedom for me will come the day when we will get rid of those generals who toppled the elected government, Hashmi yelled from top of the the vehicle. There will be no compromise with the dictators, he said. I will only consider myself a free man when the entire nation will get freedom from these generals.

 David pub beats Goliath KFC

 Humiliated

 London, May 12: The highest pub in England has come out on top in a David-and-Goliath battle with Kentucky Fried Chicken over the right to call one of their meals a family feast. 

 Every Christmas, the remote Tan Hill Inn in the Yorkshire Dales serves a traditional meal of turkey with all the trimmings for 40 a head.

 However, American fast food giant KFC threatened legal action against the quirky local for trademark infringement of the chains own Family Feast a mass-produced carton of 10 chicken pieces, chips, coleslaw, potato with gravy, and 1.25 litre soft drink.

 When pub landlady Tracy Daly, 42, received a letter from Freshfields law firm on London, on behalf of KFC, she initially thought it was a late April Fools joke. Even the solicitors name, Giles Pratt, sounded suspicious, she said.

 But she called him, and heard it was serious. The solicitor told me I shouldnt take it personally, but I dont feel anything its just hilarious, she told The Times newspaper. 

 They are a multi-million-pound international organisation and I am just a little lady up a mountain.

 KFC at first confirmed the lawsuit but a spokesman for the fast food firm said later the company had decided to drop its legal fight.

 A spokesperson for KFC GB Ltd said this afternoon: KFC has to protect its trademarks against those who seek to trade off its brand. KFC has spoken to Daly at the Tan Hill Inn and confirmed that it will not take this case any further. 

 This means that Daly can continue to use the phrase family feast on the pubs Christmas menu. Its an unusual situation that has been blown out of all proportion. 

 At 1,732 feet the Tan Hill Inn, on the Pennine Way long distance footpath in North Yorkshire, is Englands highest pub. It is four miles from the nearest village and 42 miles from a Marks amp; Spencer, Daly said.

 For more than a year, the pub has advertised its Christmas Day Family Feast on its website. The hearty meal starts with soup or Guinness and Stilton pate, followed by roast turkey with Yorkshire puddings, cranberry sauce and vegetables. Punters can choose between Christmas pudding and Strawberry Gateaux for dessert, with coffee or cheese and biscuits to finish.

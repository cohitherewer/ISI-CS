 Lawyer: Spy chiefs lying

 - All based on fairy tales

 Islamabad, June 8 (AP): The lead attorney for Pakistans suspended chief justice accused top government officials today of lying in affidavits that denied the judges account of his ouster.

 All these are based on fabrications and fairy tales which we can establish to the court, Aitzaz Ahsan said outside the supreme court. There are total lies in the affidavits... This is a criminal act.

 Ahsan was referring to sworn statements submitted yesterday which denied Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhrys claim that he was held against his will for several hours on March 9, the day he was suspended by President Pervez Musharraf, setting off an ongoing political crisis.

 Ahsan also claimed the statements by the heads of the military and civilian intelligence agencies and Musharrafs chief of staff contained forgeries and that he would provide details when the court resumes hearing Chaudhrys challenge of his suspension on Monday.

 However, the only specific anomaly he cited was that an affidavit from Chaudhrys former spokesman had been date-stamped March 8 by a court official the day before the judges ouster.

 The affidavits denied that Chaudhry was threatened, coerced or held against his will at Musharrafs army residence near Islamabad and claimed Chaudhry regularly sought information from the spy agency about fellow judges for his own database.

 Chaudhrys suspension has sparked months of demonstrations against Musharraf, who critics say has become increasingly authoritarian as he seeks to extend his nearly eight years in power with a new five-year presidential term this autumn.

 Critics claim Musharraf has tried to sideline the independent-minded judge.

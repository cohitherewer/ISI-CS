 Los Angeles, June 13: The 26-year-old told Rick and Kathy Hilton that she has suffered cold and sleeplessness in jail but is starting to get her appetite back, her mother told showbiz website www.people.com.

 But Hiltons troubles continued as the Endeavor talent agency dropped the reality show star. 

 After yesterdays 30-minute visit, Kathy Hilton said: Its tough in there. Its cold. She added: Its just good to see her.

 It was the first time Hiltons parents have seen her in jail. Kathy Hilton told People.com: She was very happy. She wants to just do her time and get on with it. She really hasnt had much sleep. 

 Michael Donkis, a spokesman for Endeavor said: She (Hilton) is no longer a client. He refused to comment further. The Beverly Hills-based agency has represented Hilton since 2005.

 Hilton, the star of The Simple Life, launched a pop-music career in August and also has a namesake perfume and handbag collection. 

 She is behind bars at the Twin Towers Correctional Facility in LA, where she is serving time for violating her probation in an alcohol-related reckless driving case. 

 The hotel heiress was briefly released with an electronic ankle tag last Thursday for an undisclosed medical condition, but a judge sent her back to jail one day later. 

 The man responsible for Paris Hiltons early release, Los Angeles sheriff Lee Baca, will be asked to prepare a report on why Hilton was released from a jail in Lynwood, California, just three days into a 23-day sentence, as part of a review of the incident.

 Baca has denied his decision was influenced by a $1,000 donation to his re-election campaign from Hiltons billionaire grandfather, William Barron Hilton, co-chairman of the Hilton Hotel chain. The sheriff cited an unspecified medical condition as the reason Hilton was allowed to leave jail and serve the remainder of her sentence for violating probation at home.

 Since the release, other prison inmates wanting to serve their sentences at home have been asking judges for the Paris Hilton treatment, according to a spokesman for a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, which will conduct the review.

 Baca said he released Hilton to home detention with electronic monitoring after she began inexplicably deteriorating while in jail. He has one week to report back to the supervisors.

 On Monday, Baca met Al Sharpton, the civil rights campaigner, who voiced concerns over the fairness issue of Hiltons release. He claimed she was given star treatment because she was white and rich.

 High-profile lawyer Gloria Allred has meanwhile filed a claim against the Sheriffs Department alleging that one of her clients detained at the Lynwood jail had serious medical issues and was treated far worse than Paris Hilton.

 3 charged over UK bombings

 London, April 5 (Reuters): Three men were charged today in connection with the suicide bomb attacks on July 7, 2005, that killed 52 commuters on Londons transport system, police said.

 They are due to appear in court in London on Saturday charged with conspiring with the bombers to cause explosions on the transport network or at tourist attractions in the capital.

 The allegation is that they were involved in reconnaissance and planning for a plot with those ultimately responsible for the bombings on July 7, said Sue Hemming, head of the Crown Prosecution Services counter-terrorism division.

 The men are the first to be charged over the attacks on three underground trains and a bus in London. The four bombers all died and more than 900 commuters were injured in the co-ordinated morning rush-hour attacks.

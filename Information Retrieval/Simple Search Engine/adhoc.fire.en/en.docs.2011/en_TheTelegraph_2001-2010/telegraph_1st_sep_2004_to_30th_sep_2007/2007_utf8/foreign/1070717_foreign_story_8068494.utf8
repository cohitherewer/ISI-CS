 Blow to Pak govt

 IMTIAZ GUL AND AGENCIES

 Islamabad, July 16 (Reuters): Pakistans government today withdrew an accusation of judicial misconduct against the countrys chief justice although he still faces other accusations that the supreme court is due to rule on this week.

 President Pervez Musharraf suspended Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry on March 9 after drawing up a set of accusations against him.

 The judges suspension touched off a protest campaign by lawyers defending the independence of the judiciary. They were joined by Opposition parties seeking an end to army chief Musharrafs eight-year rule.

 A lawyer representing Musharraf in the case, Sharifuddin Pirzada, told the supreme court that the President had asked that an accusation against Chaudhry that there were times when the judge gave differing written and verbal orders be withdrawn. We are withdrawing this portion of the reference on the instruction of the President, Pirzada told the court.

 The supreme court is expected to give a ruling on the Presidents reference against Chaudhry this week.

 The government has not officially disclosed the accusations against Chaudhry, but newspapers have reported the main one appeared to be that he used his influence to help his son get a government job.

 The government filed a separate statement last month accusing Chaudhry of fiddling expenses.

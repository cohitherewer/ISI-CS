 Dallas, Feb. 20 (Reuters): 

 Previously unreleased footage of John F. Kennedys 

 fateful motorcade in Dallas moments before he was gunned 

 down was released yesterday, a surprising new detail in 

 a saga that has gripped the US for four decades.

 The silent 8mm film shows a beaming Jacqueline Kennedy close up in vivid colour waving to the crowd. A group of excited bystanders waves to the cameraman shortly before the motorcade sweeps past. The presidents coat is clearly if briefly seen bunched up on his back a detail that will be scrutinised by conspiracy theorists who see evidence of a plot in the fact the bullet wounds on his jacket and body did not appear to match.

 The film was donated to a Dallas museum by amateur photographer George Jefferies.

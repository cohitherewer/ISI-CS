 Iowa Republicans gun for reckless Obama

 Obama: In trouble

 Des Moines, (Iowa), Aug. 6: Republican candidates vying for the White House formed an unlikely alliance with Hillary Clinton today when they branded Barack Obama reckless for suggesting he might bomb Pakistan.

 Hes gone from Jane Fonda to Dr Strangelove in one week, said Mitt Romney, to laughter and applause, during a Republican debate in Des Moines, Iowa.

 He went from saying hes going to sit down for tea with our enemies but then hes going to bomb our allies. 

 Over at the nearby Drake diner, where those enjoying English muffins, eggs over iced tea found themselves part of a focus group, the sound bite scored big. 

 The eaterys neon sign has been a magnet for White House aspirants most of whom have dropped in, several yesterday.

 Obama scares me, said Jean Bean, 60, a nurse and one of the much-courted guests at the Iowa caucuses in January, when presidential mettle will be first tested among voters. 

 Its such a hotbed over there. When Pakistans our friend kind of you just cant be saying things like that. 

 Nearly eight years ago, a Republican presidential candidate called George W Bush couldnt identify the President of Pakistan lamely hazarding general. 

 It didnt seem to matter much to the people of Iowa, who backed him in the caucuses, and he was duly elected. Now, Pakistan, a key ally in the war on terror, is centre stage in the 2008 election. 

 Candidates and voters discuss often nuanced positions on how to deal with the tribal areas of Waziristan and the domestic pressures on President Pervez Musharraf the general whose name Bush had been groping for. 

 Candidates rounded on Obama, who trails Hillary Clinton in national polls but is on the rise in the key early states, for saying he would not use nuclear weapons in any circumstance in Pakistan or Afghanistan before pausing and adding involving civilians and then asking the reporter to let me scratch that. 

 John McCain, whose tough stances on Iraq and the war on terror remain his only hope of reviving his flagging candidacy, said: Its naive to say that we will never use nuclear weapons. 

 Its naive to say were going to attack Pakistan without thinking it through. 

 What if Musharraf were removed from power? What if a radical Islamic government were to take [his] place because we triggered it with an attack? 

 Hillary Clinton called Obama nave and irresponsible last week for telegraphing his intentions to Americas enemies and potentially undermining the Wests alliance with Pakistan, which lodged a protest about his remarks. 

 The broadsides against Obama perhaps reflect a sense that he might be gaining on Hillary, the favourite to become Democratic nominee.

 But it was chiefly because the Illinois senator had made what Republicans view as a big mistake. 

 He was just the easier target this week, said Dennis Goldford of Iowas Drake University, on hand to provide instant analysis in the post-debate spin room. Everybodys auditioning for commander-in-chief and Obama didnt do too well in his audition, said Senator Lindsay Graham, a McCain loyalist.

 But the Republican attacks could boost Obamas prestige among Democratic voters. 

 Ironically, by sharing Hillarys analysis on Pakistan and the nuclear issue, the Republicans might help her show that she has the right experience and judgment to deal with foreign crises.

 In the debate, Tom Tancredo defended his suggestion that America should threaten to bomb the Islamic holy sites of Medina and Mecca in Saudi Arabia if a terrorist attack was launched against the US.

 The US state department had condemned the comment as absolutely outrageous and reprehensible. 

 Tancredo, an outsider struggling to make an impression, was unrepentant and took a pop at American diplomats regarded on the Right with almost as much suspicion as UN officials. 

 Yes, the state department boy, when they start complaining about things I say, I feel a lot better about the things I say, Ill tell you right now. 

 But the moment that drew the best response from the focus group at the Drake diner was when Mike Huckabee, who has moved up into joint third place in the Iowa polls alongside McCain, slammed the House of Saud. 

 Look, weve made them rich, he said. Every time somebody in this room goes to the petrol pump, youve helped make the Saudi royal family a little wealthier. And the money that has been used against us in terrorism has largely come from West Asia. 

 What happens in Pakistan is now crucial for ordinary Americans and candidates needed to weigh their words carefully, said Senator Jim Talent.

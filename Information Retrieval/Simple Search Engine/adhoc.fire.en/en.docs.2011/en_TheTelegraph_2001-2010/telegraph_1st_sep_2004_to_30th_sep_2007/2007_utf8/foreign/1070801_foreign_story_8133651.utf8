 Bombing similarities

 Islamabad, July 31 (AP): Investigators have found striking similarities between two suicide bombings in Islamabad since an army siege of the radical Lal Masjid, including electronic detonators and the use of ball-bearings as shrapnel, an official said today.

 Officials have not laid direct blame for the two attacks, which killed a total of 29 people this month. Interior ministry spokesman Javed Iqbal Cheema today stopped short of saying one group may be responsible for both blasts but said useful clues had been unearthed.

 The investigators have concluded that there are striking similarities between the suicide bombings, including the use of an electronic triggering mechanism, Cheema said. 

 Both bombs also used ball bearings embedded in the explosive, he said.

 One bomber struck on Friday at a restaurant crowded by policemen, leaving 14 people dead and more than 60 others wounded. Another suicide attack in Islamabad 11 days earlier, hit a planned rally in support of the countrys top judge, killing 15 people. 

 An attempt on Friday to reopen the mosque turned violent after supporters of its former pro-Taliban clerics occupied it and evicted a government-appointed prayer leader. Authorities have now closed the mosque.

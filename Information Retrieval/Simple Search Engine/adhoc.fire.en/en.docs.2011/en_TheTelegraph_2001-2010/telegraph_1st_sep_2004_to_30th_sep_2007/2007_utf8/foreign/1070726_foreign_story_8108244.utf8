 UK schoolboy guilty of terror

 DUNCAN GARDHAM

 Mohammed Irfan Raja

 London,

 July 25: A schoolboy who ran away from home to become a Muslim martyr and three students who recruited him are facing jail after a jury found them guilty of terrorism offences.

 Mohammed Irfan Raja was supposed to be on his way to school in Essex when he ran away to join a group of radicalised students in Bradford.

 Raja, from Ilford, who was then 17, caught a bus to West Yorkshire as part of a plan to travel to Pakistan for terrorist training. 

 He left his parents a note which said: If not in this (world) we will meet in the Garden of Paradise, Inshallah [God willing]. 

 The situation is such that you will live another 30 years, maybe 40 years. When death will befall you, maybe then you will appreciate what I have done now. A PS added that he was going abroad. Rajas distraught parents called the police in February last year.

 Yesterday Raja and three others were found guilty of possessing articles useful for terrorism after a three-month trial at the Old Bailey.

 Officers found a profusion of Islamic propaganda on the schoolboys computer which showed he had been talking to Bradford University students in a chatroom.

 Rajas family managed to contact him on his mobile phone and persuaded him to telephone them from a phone box in Manchester.

 His distraught mother went on a hunger strike until Raja agreed to return home.

 Irfan Raja was not as firm in his purpose as he hoped he would be, and as the people in Bradford hoped he would be, said Andrew Edis prosecuting. He had become involved with a group of radical first-year students who would allegedly meet at a student house in Bradford.

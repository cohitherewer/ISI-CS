 Dhaka curfew

 Dhaka, Aug. 24 (AP): Streets in Bangladeshs biggest cities emptied again late today as the military-backed government re-imposed a curfew to quell violent student protests demanding an end to emergency rule.

 Markets and streets had bustled earlier in the day as residents took advantage of a 14-hour curfew suspension to stock up on food and other necessities. The curfew would be lifted again during the day tomorrow.

 There have been no signs of protests since the curfew was imposed on Wednesday evening in six cities including Dhaka, but security forces appeared to be taking no chances, arresting five teachers and one student leader. Since yesterday, security forces have picked up two Dhaka University teachers and three teachers at Rajshahi University in the countrys northwest, family members and the United News of Bangladesh news agency said. Security forces also arrested student leader Azizul Bari Helal, said his wife, Bushra Hossain. The authorities gave no reason for his detention, she told reporters.

 Security forces also reportedly raided the homes of other teachers who managed to slip into hiding before they arrived. Officials offered no immediate comment on the arrests, and relatives complained that they had no idea where their family members had been taken. Were in the dark about my fathers whereabouts, said Dipannita Hossain, whose father, Anwar Hossain, a leader of the Dhaka University Teachers Association, was among those picked up late yesterday.

 Salt Lake City, Feb. 13 (AP): A man with a shotgun fired randomly in a historical shopping mall last night, killing five people and injuring several more before he was killed, police said.

 Hours later, police still were searching stores for shocked shoppers and employees who were hiding and awaiting a safe escort from the Trolley Square mall.

 We have six fatalities and multiple victims at hospitals, police detective Robin Snyder said. They were found throughout the mall. I dont know male or female or ages.

 At least four people were hospitalised, three in critical condition and one in serious condition, hospital spokesmen said. Two of the critically injured were a 16-year-old man and a 50-year-old man, a spokesman said.

 Authorities offered few details about the shootings but said the gunman entered the mall about 6:45 pm.

 The two-storey mall, southeast of downtown, is a refurbished trolley barn built in 1908, with a series of winding hallways, brick floors, wrought-iron balconies and about 80 stores, including high-end retailers such as Williams-Sonoma and restaurants such as the Hard Rock Cafe.

 Matt Lund, whose wife manages a clothing store, said he saw a womans body face-down at the entrance to Pottery Barn Kids. He locked himself and four others inside a storage room for about 40 minutes, isolated but still able to hear the violence.

 We heard them say: Police! Drop your weapon! Then we heard shotgun fire. Then there was a barrage of gunfire, Lund, 44, said. 

 Marie Smith, 23, had the day off from Bath amp; Body Works but stopped there during an errand and saw the gunman shoot a woman in front of the store. 

 He was ahead of her, standing still. I dont think she saw that he had a gun, said Smith.

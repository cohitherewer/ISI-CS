 Paris $1m deal

 Los Angeles, June 22: Paris Hilton could be paid as much as $1 million for her first television interview following her release from jail next week, according to reports today. 

 US television network NBC has reportedly won a bidding war to secure an exclusive chat with the heiress, who is serving a 45-day sentence for driving on a suspended licence following a drink driving offence. The New York Post quoted sources that said NBC News had promised to pay up to $1 million (500,000) for the interview with Hilton, who is due to be released from the Century regional detention centre in Lynwood, California, on Monday. 

 Rival network ABC is said to be angry at the arrangement, the Post reports, as it considered the socialite would grant her first interview to Barbara Walters, who is friendly with the 26-year-olds mother, Kathy Hilton.

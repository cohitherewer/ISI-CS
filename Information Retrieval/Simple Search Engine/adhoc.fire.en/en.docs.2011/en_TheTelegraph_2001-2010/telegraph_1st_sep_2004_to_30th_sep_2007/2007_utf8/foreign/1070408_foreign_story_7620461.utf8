 China organs

 Beijing, April 7 (Reuters): China will formalise a ban on the trade in human organs, state media said today, further tightening regulation over a market critics say has been beset by illegal practices, often involving organs of executed prisoners.

 The regulation, issued by Chinas State Council, or cabinet, is effective from May 1, and does not apply to transplants of human tissue, including cells, cornea and marrow.

 The regulation stipulates that human organ transplants should respect the principle of being voluntary and free donation, the official Xinhua news agency said. China last year cracked down on the trade and commercial use of corpses and the health ministry issued rules that banned the sale of human organs. The State Council regulation formalises the ban.

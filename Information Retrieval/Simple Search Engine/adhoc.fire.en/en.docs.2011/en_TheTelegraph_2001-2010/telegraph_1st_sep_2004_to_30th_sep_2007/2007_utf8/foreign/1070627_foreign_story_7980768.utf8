The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Blair must pay for haul

 London, June 26 (AP): A foal with a bloodline tied to expeditions by Napoleon, a glinting arsenal of daggers and richly woven carpets from West Asia. 

 These are among a decades worth of gifts to Tony Blair, but he must now pay for them if he wants to keep them as mementos of office.

 The outgoing British leader, who formally resigns tomorrow, has been laden with presents since 1997, some cherished, others like a pony from a French village accepted with reservation.

 Blairs haul is valued at a minimum of 25,200 according to government records. But aside from a leaving gift of a painting from his cabinet and a steel-stringed guitar from his party, few items will be packed into removal vans, unless he chooses to quickly snap them up. Government ministers must declare any gift valued at over 140, and either buy them or hand them over to their department for display or storage before leaving office.

 Records list 180 presents to Blair above that threshold handed between 2001, when the government started keeping track, and 2006.

 The actual value of many of those offerings is likely to be far higher. An iron statue of a horse once owned by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, and presented to the leader by Russian President Vladimir Putin, is estimated to be worth at least 25,000.

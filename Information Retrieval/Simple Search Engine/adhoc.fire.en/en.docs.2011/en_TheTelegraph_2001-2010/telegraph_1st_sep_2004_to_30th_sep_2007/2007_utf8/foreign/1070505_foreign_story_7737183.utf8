 Labour losses

 Aberdeen (Scotland), May 4 (Reuters): Prime Minister Tony Blair bequeathed his successor a tough task in reviving support for the ruling Labour Party today after it suffered losses in regional elections across Britain.

 Blair is set to announce next week he will leave his job by July and his presumed heir, finance minister Gordon Brown, risks taking office with the parliament in his native Scotland controlled by a party that wants independence from London.

 Yesterdays polls for local councils, the Scottish parliament and Welsh Assembly were the last chance for 39 million voters to give a verdict on Blairs decade in power. Blair said the results were far from a rout and gave a perfectly good springboard for the next general election.

 You always take a hit in the mid term, he told BBC television. We came from worse results a few years ago and won an election. And were going to do it again.

 The Prime Ministers popularity has slumped over the Iraq war and a series of political scandals. Brown, 56, is clear favourite to take over as Labour leader and Prime Minister, and was endorsed by Blair last week. Brown could rule until May 2010 without holding an election.

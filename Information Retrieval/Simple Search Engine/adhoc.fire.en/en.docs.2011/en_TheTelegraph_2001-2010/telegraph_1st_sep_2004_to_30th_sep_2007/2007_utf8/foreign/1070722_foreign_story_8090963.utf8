 London, July 21 (Reuters): The UKs Royal Air Force has been called in to help police and emergency services rescue hundreds of people stranded by flash flooding after torrential rain, a Royal Air Force spokesperson said today.

 Two RAF helicopters and a Marine Coastguard helicopter helped evacuate people in Gloucester, Stratford-upon Avon and Evesham in the middle of the country.

 Weve rescued in excess of 100 people by air, the RAF spokesperson said. Weve picked people out of rivers or who were stranded on bits of land cut off by water as well as rescuing people from caravan rooftops. Weve also assisted in getting medication to people who werent able to get to hospital. One helicopter has taken a cardiac arrest patient to hospital because the roads were impassable, she said

 The Met office said 126.2mm of rain had fallen at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire in 24 hours over 50mm more than the previous record while Pershore in Worcestershire had been deluged by 142.6mm of rain.

 Weve seen a months rainfall for July fall in day, said a Met office spokesperson.

 As many as 2,000 people had to be taken to emergency centres while the Hereford and Worcester Fire Service had received more than 2,000 emergency calls.

 The M5 motorway in the Midlands had to be closed due to flooding near Worcester, though it reopened today morning.

 Weve been working through the night to tackle problems caused by the severe flooding on the M5, said a highways agency spokesperson. Hundreds of drivers were stranded because of the unprecedented rainfall.

 The highways agency said traffic had been heavier than usual due to the start of the summer school holidays.We urge people to plan their journeys carefully and to allow extra time for travelling, the spokesperson added.

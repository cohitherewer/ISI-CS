 Scribes face bullet threats

 Islamabad, May 30 (Reuters): Three Pakistani journalists working for foreign news organisations in Karachi found bullets placed in their cars in what a local media body described today as an attempt to intimidate the press into silence.

 It is very threatening. This is a serious issue. It is an attempt to gag the press, but we will not compromise on our objectivity, Mazhar Abbas, secretary-general of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, said. Karachi has been tense since May 12, when nearly 40 people were killed in clashes between rival political groups, that disrupted a visit to the city by suspended chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry.

 Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), the party controlling Pakistans biggest city and an ally of Musharrafs and member of the coalition, has denied accusations that its workers played a big part in the Karachi bloodshed. Last week, a shadowy group associated with the MQM issued a list of a dozen journalists, terming them enemies.

 Two of the journalists who received bullets were on the list. An envelope containing a bullet was taped to the windscreens of vehicles belonging to the two journalists, while a similar envelope was thrown inside the car of a third late yesterday. Karachi police chief Azhar Farooqi said investigations were underway. Pakistani media has flourished and many new television channels have opened up since Musharraf seized power in a bloodless military coup .

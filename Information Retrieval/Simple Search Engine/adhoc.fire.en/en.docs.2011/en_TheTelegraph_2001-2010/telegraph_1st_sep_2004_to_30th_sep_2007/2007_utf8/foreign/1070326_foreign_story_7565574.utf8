 Progress on Nepal deal to share power

 BHARAT BHUSHAN 

 Kathmandu, March 25: A rough compromise on power sharing leading to the formation of an interim government in Nepal seems likely now.

 The Maoists and the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) have adopted a flexible attitude on the sharing of portfolios, making the power sharing possible. 

 There is also likelihood that there would be no Deputy Prime Minister in the interim government.

 This was seen as the only way out of a sticky situation as, otherwise, there would have been four Deputy Prime Ministers. The Maoists till late tonight were still pushing for the sole Deputy Prime Minister to be from their party. However, no firm agreement has been reached.

 Although there is much demand for portfolios which deal with the people in a much more direct form like education, local development, agriculture and land reforms the differences on sharing of portfolios have been narrowed down. 

 Prime Minister G.P. Koiralas Nepali Congress is likely to keep the key portfolios of defence, home and finance. Koirala has been arguing that unless the key ministries dealing with security and finance were firmly under his control, governance would be difficult in the transition period.

 In addition, the Nepali Congress is likely to get the portfolio of forests and soil conservation and either the proposed new ministry of peace, rehabilitation and reconstruction or the science and technology portfolio.

 The former would ensure that the party would effectively control the peace process. 

 The portfolios that the Maoists have informally consented to accept are: information and communication, physical planning, either education or local development and agriculture.

 The Maoists wanted the land reforms portfolio, which is separate from agriculture, but there is another claimant the Left Front or Vam Morcha. 

 The CPN (UML) is being offered foreign affairs, tourism and civil aviation, general administration, and either education or local development and either science and technology or social welfare.

 The Nepali Congress (Democratic) is believed to have agreed to accept three portfolios: water resources, labour and transport, and law and justice. The party already holds these portfolios.

 The smaller constituent parties will get one cabinet berth each. The Jan Morcha is likely to get health, the Sadbhavna Party (Anandi Devi) the ministry of supply, industry and commerce, and the Left Front either land reforms or agriculture. The Nepal Mazdoor Kisan Party is not accepting any portfolio while supporting the government.

 The proposal that there be no Deputy Prime Minister means that the present incumbents may not be in the new interim government. The Maoists have assuaged the fears of the Nepali Congress that an ailing 83-year-old Prime Minister needed to firmly have a succession plan. 

 They have said that in case of any untoward development in G.P. Koiralas health, the next Prime Minister will also be from the Nepali Congress till the Constituent Assembly is elected.

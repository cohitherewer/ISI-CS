 Qaida bounty on cartoonist

 Dubai, Sept. 15 (Reuters): The head of an al Qaida-led group in Iraq has offered a $100,000 reward for the killing of a Swedish cartoonist for his drawing of Islams Prophet Mohammad and threatened to attack major Swedish companies.

 Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, leader of the self-styled Islamic State in Iraq, also offered $50,000 in an audiotape posted on an Islamist website today to anyone who killed the editor of the newspaper that published the drawing by Lars Vilks.

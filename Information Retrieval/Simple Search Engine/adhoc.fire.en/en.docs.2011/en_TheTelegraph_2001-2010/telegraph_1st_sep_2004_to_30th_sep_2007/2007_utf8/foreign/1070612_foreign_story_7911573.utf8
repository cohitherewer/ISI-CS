 Cash-hit French Left hawks treasures

 Paris, June 11: It was once Frances biggest political party, feared by the bourgeoisie and the CIA alike as a red menace with the power to spark another revolution. 

 Nicolas Sarkozys sweeping victory in last months presidential election, however, and the prospect of another landslide for his party in the parliamentary elections have spelled disaster for the French Communist Party. 

 So bad were the presidential election results that the peoples party is reportedly on the brink of bankruptcy. 

 Famously supported by poets and intellectuals including Pablo Picasso, the surrealists Andr Breton and Ren Magritte and poet Louis Aragon, the Communists were historically never short of a few francs. But they were always secretive about their funding, partly because some of it came from the KGB. 

 Now the party has been forced to admit things are seriously tight, after claims that it plans to sell the family silver, including its emblematic Paris headquarters a listed building designed by the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer and valuable art including Mona Lisa with Moustache by Marcel Duchamp. 

 In the catastrophic election campaign, party leader Marie-George Buffet ran up a 3.7 million bill that yielded less than two per cent of the votes. Under Frances complex system of political funding, the collapse of support meant only 550,000 was reimbursed by the state, rather than the 5.4 million the party would have received had it won at least five per cent of the national vote. 

 It could get worse. French President Nicolas Sarkozys Centre-Right party crushed the Socialists in the first round of parliamentary elections. Pollsters predict that the party will take more than 400 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly after the June 17 second round. That would leave the communists on the brink of disaster, with predictions that they will hold as few as four of their current 21 seats in the parliamentary elections. 

 According to Le Monde newspaper, the director of a large modern art museum said he had been visited by a Communist Party delegation, asking him to value the large Fernand Lger fresco, Liberty I Write Your Name, which hangs in the party headquarters. I was led to believe they were in the process of selling their last assets, he said.

 Soft drink link

 New York, March 13 (Reuters): A review of published studies shows a clear and consistent relationship between drinking sugary (non-diet) soft drinks and poor nutrition, increased risk for obesity and increased risk for diabetes.

 There is no denying that sugar-loaded soft drinks are having a negative impact on health, Dr Kelly Brownell, director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, said.

 Brownell and his colleagues conclude that recommendations to curb soft drink consumption on a population level are strongly supported by the available scientific evidence. Results of a study of more than 91,000 women followed for 8 years provides one of themost striking links between soft drinks and health outcomes.

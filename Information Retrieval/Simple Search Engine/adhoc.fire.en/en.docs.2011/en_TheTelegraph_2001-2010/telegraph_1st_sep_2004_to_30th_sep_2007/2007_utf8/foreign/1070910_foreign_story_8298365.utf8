The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 To live and work in UK, learn English

London, Sept. 9: Tens of thousands more immigrant workers will be forced to learn English before they are allowed into the country, The Sunday Telegraph can reveal.

 The controversial crackdown, which is expected to reduce the number of people entering Britain by at least 35,000-a-year, will be unveiled by UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown in a speech to the Trades Union Congress in Brighton.

 The rules will affect those seeking to work and settle permanently in Britain from countries outside the European Union.

 Browns aides said the initiative, which will be seen as another shift to the Right following the Prime Ministers moves to block supercasinos and to review the decision to reclassify cannabis as a less dangerous drug, will form a key plank of the governments new policy on immigration.

 The move will present a dilemma to David Cameron, who is trying to reposition the Conservatives as a modern, compassionate party and has shied away from referring to immigration. If he attacks Browns move, he risks once again angering his core support among right-of-centre voters.

 Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, said: Those who we welcome into the UK to work and settle here need to understand our traditions and feel that they are part of our shared national culture.

 They need to integrate into our country, learn English and use our language. Under the governments new points system, there are three main categories of immigrants coming to Britain from outside the EU to work: highly skilled, skilled and low-skilled workers.

 The first two groups can eventually settle permanently in Britain; the third cannot.

 Highly skilled migrants have been forced to learn English as a condition of entry since last December.

 However, Brown and Smith will announce this week that the condition will be extended to all skilled migrants, who numbered 96,000 last year.

 According to a government source, about 35,000 of them would not have passed an English-speaking test.

 They will be now be expected to speak, write and understand English to a standard equivalent to GCSE grade A to C, by passing an internationally recognised English test or showing they have a university degree from a course taught in English.

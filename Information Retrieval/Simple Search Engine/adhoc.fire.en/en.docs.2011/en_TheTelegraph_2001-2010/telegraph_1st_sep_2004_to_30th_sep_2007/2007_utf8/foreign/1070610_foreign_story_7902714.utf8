The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 PMs Pak visit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 On Board Air India One, June 9: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has admitted for the first time that while he would like to go to Pakistan, perhaps now may not be the best time.

 I have an invitation from President Musharraf. I would certainly like to visit Pakistan. But the President has some problems at home these days and I dont want to add to those problems, he told journalists on board Air India One.

 Singh also ruminated about the changed character of Berlin, how it seemed fantastic that it had been divided by a wall only a few years ago and was now integrating so nicely.

 quot;I have the same hope that this will also apply to our neighbourhood. Our ambition, our prayers are to find paths to do so with Pakistan, he said.

 Asked about Nawaz Sharifs comment that India should only talk to a democratically elected government in Pakistan, the Prime Minister said India would talk to whoever was in power in that country.

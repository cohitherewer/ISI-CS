 New diabetes gene find

 Washington, April 27 (Reuters): The most thorough probe to date of the genetic underpinnings of the most common form of diabetes has identified a new batch of genes that increases risk for a disease affecting 200 million people globally.

 The findings by four international teams of researchers, published yesterday in the journals Science and Nature Genetics, provided great insight into the role played by genes in a disease also tremendously influenced by behaviour eating too much and exercising too little.

 The scientists hope the findings can help guide development of new drugs to treat type 2 diabetes, previously known as adult-onset diabetes, and genetic tests to determine a persons predisposition for developing it.

 Despite its growing global prevalence, the diseases underlying causes have been only minimally understood, restricting treatment and prevention efforts. The scientists scoured the entire human genome more than 22,000 known genes of about 50,000 people in several countries with and without the disease.

 They identified at least eight genes that are clear diabetes risk factors including three previously unknown ones and several other likely risk factors that merit further attention. 

 I think weve made a quantum leap here in terms of our understanding of the genetic variants that contribute as risk factors to type 2 diabetes, Michael Boehnke of the University of Michigan, who led one of the teams, said.

 In diabetics, ones body fails to produce or properly use insulin, a hormone necessary to convert sugar, starches and other food into energy. It is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney failure and amputations. The role of the three new genes is unclear. Two may be linked to the development, function and regeneration of certain insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. The genes that have been found here are, without exception, totally surprising, David Altshuler of the Broad Institute of Harvard University said.

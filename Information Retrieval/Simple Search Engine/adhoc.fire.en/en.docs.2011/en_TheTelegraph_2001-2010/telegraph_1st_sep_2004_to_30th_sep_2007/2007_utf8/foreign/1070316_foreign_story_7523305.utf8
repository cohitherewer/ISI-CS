 UK varsity rules to affect Indians

 AMIT ROY

 London, March 15: Children of middle class Indian parents with degrees may now fear they will be discriminated against when they apply to university in favour of working class Pakistani and Bangladeshi candidates who come from homes where neither the mother nor the father has been through higher education. 

 Under new rules announced today by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas), candidates will from next year be asked whether their parents went to university. 

 This is being done under pressure from the government which wants to widen access to higher education, especially to Oxbridge and other top universities, and reduce what is viewed by the Labour Partys Left wing as the unfair advantages that the middle classes have long enjoyed. 

 But the new rules will also be seen as yet another attack on the middle classes. The universities have so far not gathered any data on the parents of their candidates. But anecdotal evidence suggests that, among immigrants, Indian parents are among the best educated group. 

 If the Indians are further broken down, it is likely that Bengali and Tamil professionals are most likely to have degrees, and this is perhaps also true of a proportion of the arrivals from East Africa. 

 Among British-born Indians, only a few will not have received some form of higher education. It is remarkable how the children of Punjabi factory workers and Gujarati small business folk have made full use of Britains till now free educational system. 

 But having pulled themselves up, they may now find their children have to suffer from the rules changes announced today. However well intentioned the government, Indians may have to pay the price for having made the effort to educate themselves. 

 Although the question will be optional, candidates will be asked: Do any of your parents have any higher education qualifications such as a degree, diploma or certificate of higher education? 

 For some years now, students have been asked about their ethnic origin in another optional question. The untold word is class, commented Lord (Meghnad) Desai, a Labour peer who has been a professor of economics at the London School of Economics. 

 Desai, who is not entirely opposed to the proposed changes why not? confirmed that the Indians in the UK have become increasingly middle class. 

 He said that Indian children, many of whom now went to fee-paying schools, were much more likely than their Pakistani or Bangladeshi counterparts to be the off-spring of graduate parents. 

 Desai said his personal preference was to adopt an individualistic approach to admissions. However, the government wants admission tutors to take family background and other social factors, such as whether a school is in a deprived area, into account before making offers. 

 Bill Rammell, the higher education minister, backed the change: The government is committed to ensuring that people from all backgrounds should have the opportunity to access and benefit from higher education. We also believe that admissions officers should have as much information as possible available, to help enable them to assess who has the potential to succeed. 

 Ucas said in a statement: At our board meeting, the issue of whether data on parental education should be made available to admissions officers during the decision-making process was one of the points considered. The Ucas board felt that in order to support the continuing efforts of universities and colleges to widen participation, this information should be made available to admissions officers during decision-making and that, in principle, data on parental occupation and ethnicity should also be released at the same point. 

 From next year, the number of places to which a candidate can apply goes down from six to five. Students who apply to do medicine, dentistry and veterinary courses currently make four choices this will stay the same. Many Indians fall into this category. The number of people applying for full-time undergraduate courses at UK universities and colleges has increased by 6.4 per cent from 395,307 in 2007 applicants to 371,683 in 2006. 

 Students who apply from India will not be asked about their parents. This year, 1162 candidates have applied directly from India to do an undergraduate course in the UK, compared with 1,021 in 2006, representing a healthy jump of 13.8 per cent. 

 Asked whether middle class Indians would now face discrimination, a spokesman for Ucas told The Telegraph that 90 per cent of candidates who got three A grades in their A levels got into the top universities. He said that in seeking more information about a candidates background, universities were taking a holistic approach on the question of admissions.

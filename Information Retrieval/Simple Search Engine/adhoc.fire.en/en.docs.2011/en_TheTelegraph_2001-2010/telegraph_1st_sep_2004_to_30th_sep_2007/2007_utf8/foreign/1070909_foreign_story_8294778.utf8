 Brown plans sent to student

 CHARLIE DEVEREUX

 London, Sept. 8: Gordon Browns travel schedule was accidentally sent to a students mobile phone by one of his bodyguards, it was revealed today.

 The Metropolitan Police was forced to launch an inquiry after one of its officers left four voicemail messages and sent a text giving details of a planned trip to Bristol to a mobile phone belonging to a 19-year-old law student, apparently thinking it belonged to one of Browns staff.

 Tom Dyer, from Pembrokeshire, told The Sun newspaper that the messages included precise details of a train Brown was planning to catch from Londons Paddington Station to Bristol last Thursday. I couldnt believe he had left so much information, he said. 

 He must have misdialled and kept hitting the redial button instead of checking the number.

 The Sun noted that the details supplied were sufficient to cause a major security problem if they had fallen into the wrong hands. This matter has been reviewed and we have concluded the officer made an honest mistake, a Scotland Yard spokesman said. The security of our operations is of paramount importance to us and we are grateful that this has been brought to our attention.

 The officer who made the blunder has been spoken to and advised of his error, the spokesman added. Downing Street refused to discuss the incident last night, saying only that it never discussed security matters.

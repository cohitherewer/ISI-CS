 Life term for Bangla murderer

 Dhaka, March 29 (Agencies): Nearly eight years after the son of a former director-general of police of Bengal was killed in Chittagong, Bangladesh High Court has awarded the life sentence to the main suspect in the murder.

 Jibran Tayyabi, the 27-year-old son of Tayyab Ahmed Khan, was killed on June 9, 1999, in Chittagong where he was an executive of an Indian shipping company.

 The high court yesterday handed down the life imprisonment to Yasin Rahman Tito.

 The court order is another positive for Indo-Bangla ties since the caretaker government of Fakhruddin Ahmed took over in January. Earlier this month, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zias son Tarique Rahman, allegedly involved in anti-India activities, was arrested. 

 Tito, the main suspect among six accused, had been earlier acquitted by a lower court after his trial in absentia. He fled the country after the murder and is believed to be in London.

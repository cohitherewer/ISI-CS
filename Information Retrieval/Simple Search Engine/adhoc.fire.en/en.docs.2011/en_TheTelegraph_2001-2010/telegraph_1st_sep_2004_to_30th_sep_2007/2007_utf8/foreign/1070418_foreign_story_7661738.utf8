 Gunman shoots Japan mayor

 Tokyo, April 17 (Reuters): The mayor of Nagasaki, Japan was shot today, a city official said, and media reports said he was unconscious and his heart had stopped.

 Itcho Ito, 61, seeking re-election for a fourth term in Sundays election, was shot by a man in front of a train station just before 1100 GMT, the official said. Japanese media said that Ito, 61, was taken to hospital by ambulance after being shot twice in the back after he had come back from campaigning.

 Police had arrested and confiscated a revolver from Tetsuya Shiroo, 59, the acting head of gang affiliated with Japans largest organised crime syndicate, the Yamaguchi Gumi, the reports said.

 The motive for the shooting was unclear but Kyodo news agency quoted police as saying the suspect had told them he had had trouble with the city over bidding for public works contracts.

 Public broadcaster NHK reported that Itos lungs and heart had stopped functioning. The mayor had appeared pale and was not responding to paramedics.

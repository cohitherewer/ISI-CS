 Sharp students of politics

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 Kathmandu, Jan. 17: The 

 Maoists in Nepal are proving to be sharp students of democratic 

 politics. Their political arithmetic is already being acknowledged 

 as superior to that of others. 

 The choice of the MPs sent to the Interim Parliament by them is more representative and they are the only ones to send 10 civil society representatives in the quota meant for them in Parliament. Others have sent defeated politicians and family members in the guise of civil society representatives. 

 Political commentator C.K. Lal felt that the Maoists had shamed the other parties by the representative composition of their 73 MPs. They are proving to be consummate politicians. There is nothing insurgent-like in their political arithmetic. I have not seen such maturity in any other political party, he said. Lal felt that because of the Maoists, people are able to see a representative Nepal in the Interim Parliament. It is an evidence of their maturity that they have Dalits, Janjatis (indigenous people), Madhesis (inhabitants of Terai), women and even a disabled person as their MPs. 

 Not only is the representative character of the new Maoist MPs drawing attention in Kathmandu, but also their different looks. Their representation is different and better. They stand out visually. Sometimes the visual aspect is important in politics. People look at them and know immediately that they are different, felt Chakra Prasad Bastola, senior Nepali Congress leader and former foreign minister. 

 The Nepali Congress leader felt the Maoists have tried to give a definite meaning to their representation in the Interim parliament and also communicate it to the people. I think to a large extent they have succeeded. The Maoists have also surprised everyone by nominating a retired major general of the erstwhile Royal Nepal Army who supported the democracy movement and a Buddhist peacenik monk to parliament under their civil society quota. Why an army general in Parliament and that too from the erstwhile royalist army? Some claim that this is because the nominated MP, Major General (Retired) Kumar Phudung, is from the Kirat minority from the east and wrote in favour of democracy during the kings absolute rule.

 Others say that through his nomination the Maoists want to send two messages that they are a responsible political party which support anyone who is for democracy and that the army has nothing to fear from them any more. 

 Maoist leader Baburam Bhattarai has a different explanation: We want to discuss national security issues in Parliament. The Peoples Liberation Army also has to be integrated into the Nepal Army. So we needed someone who understands these issues. He fits the bill. He claimed that the Maoists had no past connection with Gen. Phudung before nominating him. 

 But that is not all that the Maoists have done. Their civil society list and their declaring that these ten MPs will not be covered by party whip is a public relations coup. It not only shows them as democratic but these MPs outside the party discipline, can criticize even their alliance partners without the Maoists having to take the blame, Lal pointed out. 

 By contrast, the Nepali Congress is being criticized for nominating Prime Minister G P Koiralas daughter Sujata Koirala, and another relative, K B Gurung, under the nominated civil society quota. Similarly, the Nepali Congress (Democratic) has nominated party members who have either not contested elections or lost them. The Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) has fared no better it has also nominated very senior leaders defeated in the hustings under the civil society quota. 

 This sends a negative message to the people. It shows that these parties have learnt nothing, said Lal.

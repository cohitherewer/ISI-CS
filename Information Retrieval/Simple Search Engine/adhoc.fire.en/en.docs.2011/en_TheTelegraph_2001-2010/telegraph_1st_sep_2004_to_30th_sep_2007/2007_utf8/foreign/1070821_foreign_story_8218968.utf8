 Chicago, Aug. 20 (AP): 

 If you are a superstar Hollywood actress, one of the nice 

 things about visiting Chicago is the absence of paparazzi.

 Or so Gwyneth Paltrow thought.

 Paltrow arrived at the same time as her former fiance, Brad Pitt, his companion, Angelina Jolie, and their children did. Their presence has meant more star-hunting photographers than usual, said Paltrow, in town on Friday to promote perfume at a Macys store.

 Paltrow also stayed at The Peninsula Chicago where the Pitt-Jolie family is living while Jolie films the movie Wanted.

 When Brad and Angelina leave, wont they (paparazzi) go, too? the 34-year-old said. Dont you think they sort of blow in and out with the celebs?

 In 2003 the Oscar-winning actress said she loved coming to Chicago because theres no paparazzi.

 Paltrow won the best actress Oscar for her role as the love interest of William Shakespeare in the movie Shakespeare in Love. The film also won the best picture Oscar. She has also starred in Se7en opposite Brad Pitt and The Talented Mr Ripley with Matt Damon. She is married to Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin.

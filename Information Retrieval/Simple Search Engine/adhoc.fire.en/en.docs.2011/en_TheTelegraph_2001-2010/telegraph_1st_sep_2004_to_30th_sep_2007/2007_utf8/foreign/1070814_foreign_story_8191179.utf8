 One in three workers suffers from email stress

 London, Aug. 13: More than a third of workers are suffering from email stress as they are swamped with messages, a study shows.

 Struggling to cope with a deluge of emails is leaving staff tired, frustrated and unproductive, researchers from Glasgow and Paisley universities found. More than a third 34 per cent said they checked their inbox every 15 minutes and 64 per cent said they looked more than once an hour. But monitoring software revealed that they looked more often, with some workers viewing their emails up to 40 times an hour.

 More than a third 34 per cent said they felt stressed by the volume of emails and the need to reply quickly.

 A further 28 per cent said they felt driven when they checked their messages because of the pressure to respond. Just 38 per cent of workers were relaxed enough to wait a day or longer before replying. Women workers feel under greater pressure to respond than men, they found.

 Lead researchers Karen Renaud, a computer scientist from Glasgow University, and psychologist Judith Ramsay, of Paisley University, surveyed almost 200 workers.

 Our survey indicates the astonishing extent to which email is embedded in our day-to-day lives, they found. Females, in particular, tended to feel more pressure to respond than males. Renaud said: Email is the thing that now causes us the most problems in our working lives. She advised workers to set aside a few dedicated times a day for reading emails to cut stress.

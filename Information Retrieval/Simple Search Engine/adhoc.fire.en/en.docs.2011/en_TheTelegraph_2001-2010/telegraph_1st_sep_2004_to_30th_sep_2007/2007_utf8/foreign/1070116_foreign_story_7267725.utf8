 Trembling at gallows

 Baghdad, Jan. 15 (Reuters): Iraqi government officials showed journalists film of todays execution of two aides to Saddam Hussein in which they appeared to tremble with fear and his half-brother Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti was beheaded by the noose.

 The pair stand side-by-side on what appears to be the same gallows where Saddam was hanged two weeks ago. Unlike Saddam, they wore orange jumpsuits and were given hoods. When the trapdoor opened, Barzans head was wrenched from his body and came to rest in a pool of blood below the gallows while former judge Iwad al-Bander swung on a rope beside him.

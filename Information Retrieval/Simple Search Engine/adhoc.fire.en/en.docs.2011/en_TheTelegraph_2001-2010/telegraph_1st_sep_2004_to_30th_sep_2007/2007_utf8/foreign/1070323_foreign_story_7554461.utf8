 No police for monk

 Colombo, March 22 (Reuters): A Buddhist monk who applied to join Sri Lankas police force and carry a gun has been turned down because he wouldnt give up his saffron robes.

 The monk applied for a job as assistant superintendent of police, a rank to which sidearms are issued. It was not immediately clear why the monk wanted the police job in the first place, but many monks take on jobs as teachers, lecturers and ayurvedic doctors. 

 Someone in robes cant do the work of police, said Neville Piyadigama, chairman of the National Police Commission. Its up to him whether he wants to join the police or remain as a Buddhist monk.

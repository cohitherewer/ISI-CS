 Bush was warned about Iraq threats

 WALTER PINCUS AND KAREN DEYOUNG

 Washington, May 26: Months before the invasion of Iraq, US intelligence agencies predicted that it would be likely to spark violent sectarian divides and provide al Qaida with new opportunities in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to a report released yesterday by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. 

 Analysts warned that war in Iraq also could provoke Iran to assert its regional influence and probably would result in a surge of political Islam and increased funding for terrorist groups in the Muslim world.

 The intelligence assessments, made in January 2003 and widely circulated within the Bush administration before the war, said that establishing democracy in Iraq would be a long, difficult and probably turbulent challenge. The assessments noted that Iraqi political culture was largely bereft of the social underpinnings to support democratic development.

 More than four years after the March 2003 invasion, with Iraq still mired in violence and 150,000 US troops there under continued attack from al Qaida and Iraqi insurgents, the intelligence warnings seem prophetic. 

 Other predictions, however, were less than accurate. Intelligence analysts assessed that any post-war increase in terrorism would slowly subside in three to five years, and that Iraqs vast oil reserves would quickly facilitate economic reconstruction. The report is the latest release in the Senate committees on-going study of pre-war intelligence. A July 2004 report identified intelligence-gathering and analysis failures related to weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Still pending is a study of how the administration used intelligence on Iraq in the run-up to the war.

 The report was released the same day President Bush signed a $120 billion war funding bill from Congress that includes benchmarks for the Iraqi government.

 In a statement attached to yesterdays 229-page report, the Senate intelligence committees chairman, John D. Rockefeller IV, said: The most chilling and prescient warning from the intelligence community prior to the war was that the American invasion would bring about instability in Iraq that would be exploited by Iran and al Qaida terrorists.

 Paris card ire

 Los Angeles, Sept. 8 (Reuters): Socialite Paris Hilton has filed a lawsuit against Hallmark Cards, claiming it used her likeness without permission on a greeting card entitled Pariss First Day as a Waitress.

 Hilton, 26, is suing for an injunction against the US greeting card company and for damages in excess of $100,000, according to the suit filed late on Thursday in a US court in Los Angeles. Kansas City-based Hallmark Cards said the card was part of a satirical series that parodied celebrities and politicians. According to the lawsuit, Hiltons face is superimposed over a cartoon of a waitress serving food to a patron with the dialogue: Dont touch that, its hot. Whats hot? Thats hot. It says the card was selling in the US for $2.49. The suit says that Hallmark failed to obtain approval from the hotel heiress for using her image and had damaged her rights to privacy and publicity.

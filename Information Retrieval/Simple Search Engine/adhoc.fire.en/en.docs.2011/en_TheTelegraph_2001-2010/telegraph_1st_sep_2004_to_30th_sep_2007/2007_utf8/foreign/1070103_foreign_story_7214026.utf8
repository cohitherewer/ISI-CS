 Sleepy Spears

 Las Vegas, Jan. 2 (AP): Britney Spears finally appears to be acting like a new mom.

 The pop princess fell asleep in a Las Vegas nightclub early yesterday shortly after leading the New Years Eve countdown, her manager said. By about one clock, she was just done, so we took her out, Spearss manager, Larry Rudolph, said yesterday. She was not drunk. She was just tired and falling asleep.

 Rudolph denied reports circulating on gossip websites that Spears, 25, collapsed shortly after midnight and was carried out by bodyguards.

 Hong Kong (AP): Actress Eva Mendes says she first resisted a part in an upcoming movie also featuring Mark Wahlberg, Joaquin Phoenix and Robert Duvall because she was afraid of being typecast, but finally relented when the director agreed to adjust her role.

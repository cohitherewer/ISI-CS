 Istanbul, Aug. 18 (AP): Two men wielding a fake bomb and claiming al Qaida ties hijacked a Turkish plane today, holding passengers and crew hostage before surrendering peacefully in Antalya more than four hours later, authorities said.

 It was the fifth hijacking or hijacking attempt of a Turkish plane in four years by people falsely claiming to be carrying explosives or arms. The hijackers motive remained unclear this evening. One of the men was Turkish and the other was believed to be a Palestinian carrying a Syrian passport, transport minister Osman Gunes said.

 Earlier, Turkish Cypriot authorities said the men were Iranians protesting US policies.

 The alleged bomb turned out to be made of play dough, CNN-Turk television reported, citing police sources. The men were among 136 passengers on board an Atlasjet flight that departed from Ercan in Turkish-controlled northern Cyprus this morning, officials said. Six crew members were on the flight. The suspects told police during initial questioning that they tried to storm the cockpit shortly after takeoff, said Alaaddin Yuksel, governor of Antalya. Passengers said they failed to break the door down. 

 The hijackers then ordered the pilots to divert the flight to Iran, telling passengers they were linked to the al Qaida terror network and armed with explosives, officials said. The pilots persuaded the hijackers to let them land at the Mediterranean resort of Antalya in southwest Turkey instead to refuel, officials said. After landing, the pilots left the plane through the cockpit window to prevent the hijackers from forcing them to fly the plane and shut off the power, said Aydin Kiziltan, chief executive of Worldfocus, the company that leased the plane to Atlasjet.

 Putin plans return

 Moscow, Sept. 14 (Reuters): Vladimir Putin did not rule out today that he might return to the presidency after the next Russian leader steps down in 2012, a foreign analyst quoted him as saying.

 He did not rule out he would try and return to the presidency, Ariel Cohen, senior researcher at the Washington-based Heritage Foundation, said by telephone from the southern Russian city of Sochi.

 (He) did not indicate that he wants to weaken the next President in order to ensure his comeback, Cohen said. He also said he would continue to influence Russias political life. Putin is not planning to disappear into the fog. 

 Putin said today newly-appointed Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov might be a contender for next head of state if he performs well in his new job.

 Putin confounded expectations by naming the virtually-unknown Zubkov, a 65-year-old financial regulator, to be head of government. Parliament confirmed Zubkovs appointment today. Observers had expected the job to go to one of the heavyweights jockeying for months to succeed Putin.

 But Zubkovs appointment sparked speculation that it could lead to him becoming a low-key caretaker President, under whom Putin would retain political influence.

 Zubkov ideally fits the profile of the successor that would best accommodate Putins stated and implied ambitions, said Chris Weafer, chief strategist at Russian brokerage Uralsib.

 Lawmakers in the 450-seat State Duma voted by 381 to 47 to confirm Zubkov, an old Putin acquaintance who has barely shown any political ambitions in the past.

 Putin, speaking in the southern city of Sochi, was careful not to give any indication he was endorsing Zubkov for the presidency, saying he was a possible out of five realistic candidates. He called him a true professional and a marvellous administrator. Referring to a comment Zubkov made after his nomination, Putin said in televised remarks: He said he does not rule out running (for the presidency).

 Kiev faceoff

 Kiev, April 3 (Reuters): President Viktor Yushchenko told Ukraines Prime Minister today his decision to dissolve parliament was final and warned his long-time rival against resorting to force.

 The pro-western Yushchenko has been at odds with Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich since reluctantly appointing his Moscow-friendly rival last August, nearly two years after being swept to power by the Orange Revolution protests.

 The Premier had dismissed the decree calling an election for May 27 as a fatal error and challenged it in court.

 The decree is not just a mistake. It is aimed against the country, the Ukrainian people, Yanukovich told supporters in the camp. The solution can be found only at the negotiating table.

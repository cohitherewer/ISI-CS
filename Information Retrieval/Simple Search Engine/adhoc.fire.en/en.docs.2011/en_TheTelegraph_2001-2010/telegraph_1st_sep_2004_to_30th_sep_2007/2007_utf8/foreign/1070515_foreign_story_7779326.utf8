 Dhaka, May 14 (Reuters): Rain and wind swept Bangladeshs coastal areas including Coxs Bazar sea resort tonight and weather officials warned a cyclonic storm was moving in from the Bay of Bengal and could make landfall early tomorrow.

 Peripheral wind up to 70 kmph has begun, said a weather official at Coxs Bazar, 400 km southeast of Dhaka. He also reported moderate to medium intensity rainfall in the area. The official said several fishing boats with an unspecified number of crew were presumed missing.

 Bangladesh went on cyclone alert today as officials warned the storm in the Bay of Bengal could trigger a tidal surge two metres high. The storm was some 310 km from Chittagong port and expected to make landfall early tomorrow, meteorologists said.

 People living in coastal areas have been told to move to safer places. Merchant and fishing vessels have been advised to return to port or take shelter at nearby islands. Twenty merchant ships have been stranded at Chittagong, the countrys main port, after it suspended operations following the storm warning.

 Flights between Dhaka and Chittagong, and ferry services with coastal districts have also been suspended.

 Bangladesh air force said it had moved its planes from the Chittagong air base to Dhaka to avoid damage. Tropical storms and cyclones kill hundreds of Bangladeshis every year. 

 The third and final one-day cricket match between India and Bangladesh is scheduled to be played in Chittagong tomorrow.

 Khaleda plans

 Former Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia, focus of speculation she might soon go into exile, abandoned a plan to travel to Singapore with her younger son today, her aides said.

 Over the last couple of months, Bangladeshi media repeatedly reported that Khaleda was being pressed by the countrys army-backed interim government to go into exile with most of her family, although the government denies this.

 Tight security was imposed at Dhaka airport for Khaledas possible departure, with security forces keeping reporters and photographers at a distance.

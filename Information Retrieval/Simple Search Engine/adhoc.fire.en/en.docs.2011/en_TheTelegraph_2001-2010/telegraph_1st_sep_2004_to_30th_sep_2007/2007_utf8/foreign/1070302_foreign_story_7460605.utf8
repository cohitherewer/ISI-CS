 UK constable murder

 London, March 1 (Reuters): The husband of special constable Nisha Patel-Nasri, who was stabbed to death outside her London home last May, is due to appear in court charged with her murder, police said.

 Fadi Nasri, 33, and Roger Lesley, 37, a second man also charged with her killing, are due to appear before magistrates in west London, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement.

 They were both arrested on Tuesday. A total of four men have now been charged with murdering the 29-year-old.

 Patel-Nasri was a hairdresser who performed unpaid police duties in her spare time. She had been a special constable for more than three years when she was killed.

 She and her husband had been celebrating their third wedding anniversary on the night of the attack.

 The other two men charged with the murder are Tony Emmanuel, 41, and Jason Jones, 35, both of east London. They are due to appear at the Old Bailey later in March.

 Nasri, self-employed, is of Wembley, north west London. Lesley, unemployed, is of Barnet, north of the capital.

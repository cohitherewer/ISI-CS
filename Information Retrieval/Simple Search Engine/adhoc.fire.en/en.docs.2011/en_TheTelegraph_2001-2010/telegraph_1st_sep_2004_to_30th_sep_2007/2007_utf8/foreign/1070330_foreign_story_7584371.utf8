 Canine meat

 Dhaka, March 29 (Reuters): The caterer at a Dhaka University dormitory has been fired after students complained they were served dog meat, officials said.

 Students at the Hajji Mohammad Mohsin Hall protested after a student suspected the meat on his plate was of a dog or fox, instead of beef or mutton. The offending meat has been sent for tests at a laboratory, an official said.

 Gun swap

 Mexico City (Reuters): In a push against the citys drug violence, police hope to take guns off the streets by offering to swap them for computers and video-game consoles. City police chief Joel Ortega said anyone who turns in a high-calibre weapon like a machine gun will get a computer. Smaller guns can be swapped for cash or Microsofts Xbox video-game console.

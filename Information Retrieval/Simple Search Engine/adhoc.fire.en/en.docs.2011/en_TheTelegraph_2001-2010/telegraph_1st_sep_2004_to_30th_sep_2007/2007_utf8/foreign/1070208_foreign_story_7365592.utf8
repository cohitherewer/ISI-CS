 Blair: Penalty for US links

 London, Feb. 7: Tony Blair yesterday conceded that he had paid a political penalty for his close links with America, including taking part in the invasion of Iraq nearly four years ago. 

 But Blair warned his successor not to give up the transatlantic relationship, saying that Britain would carry less influence in the world if it was no longer seen as close to the US. 

 He acknowledged that as he left No 10 there would be a debate on whether Britain should maintain two strong alliances its partnerships with the US and Europe which had been the hallmark of his premiership. 

 Blair was highly critical of a recent speech given by William Hague, the Conservative foreign affairs spokesman, suggesting that the UK should adopt a more distant relationship with Washington in favour of developing links with countries such as China and India. 

 He said it was a false choice, as Britains influence with the emerging Asian giants and in other parts of the world depended crucially on its close relations with Washington, he said.

 His remarks were also aimed at Gordon Brown, the front-runner to succeed him, who is under pressure from Labour MPs to adopt a more arms-length relationship with President Bush. I am the person, above all, who can give evidence of the difficulties and sometimes the political penalty you pay for a close relationship with the US, but we shouldnt give that up in any set of circumstances, in my view, said Blair.

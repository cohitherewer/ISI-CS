 Tribals in Pak peace deal

 Khar (Pakistan), March 27 (AP): With the blessing of pro-Taliban militants, tribal elders from a volatile region near the Afghan border signed a peace deal with Pakistani authorities aimed at stopping the activities of foreign militants in the region, residents and officials said today.

 The agreement in the Bajur region is the third of its kind in Pakistans mountainous border zone. Osama bin Ladens deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, escaped a US missile strike in Bajur last year. President Pervez Musharraf has sought accords across the semi-autonomous region after a series of bloody military operations failed to catch al Qaidas top leadership or prevent Taliban militants fighting in Afghanistan from finding sanctuary there.

 Malik Abdul Aziz, head of Bajurs tribal council, said the latest agreement was signed during a ceremony yesterday attended by about 700 tribal elders and government officials near the main town of Khar. After hectic efforts and talks with the local Taliban, we have signed a peace deal with the government to help it fight terrorism, Aziz said. Local Taliban have assured us that they will not shelter foreign militants in their areas, and they are also part of a written agreement.

 Pakistanis routinely refer to tribal militants, who are suspected of aiding their ethnic Pashtun brethren fighting in Afghanistan, as local Taliban. In return, the government will expedite development projects in the region, Aziz said.

 Shakil Qadir Khan, the top government administrator in Bajur, confirmed the agreement, but provided no details. Musharraf, a key US ally in its war on international terrorism, says the deals will empower tribal elders to counter militancy in their territory and open the way for a massive development programme designed to counter the poverty that leaves the regions young men vulnerable to extremism.

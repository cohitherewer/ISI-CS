 London, Jan. 17: President George W. Bush yesterday said that the execution of Saddam Hussein bore the hallmarks of a sectarian revenge killing, in his most critical assessment of the hanging of the former dictator.

 The US President criticised the circumstances surrounding Saddams death and the recent execution of two top aides, including Saddams half brother, Barzan al-Tikriti, for their roles in the massacre of 148 Shia men in Dujail in 1982.

 I was disappointed and felt like they fumbled the particularly the Saddam Hussein execution, Bush said in an interview by public broadcast televisions Jim Lehrer.

 The message is confusing. It basically says to people: Look, you conducted a trial and gave Saddam justice that he didnt give to others. But then, when it came to execute him, it looked like it was kind of a revenge killing.

 Bush at first welcomed the hanging of Saddam on December 30 for crimes against humanity as an important milestone on Iraqs course to becoming a democracy, and declared good riddance. He later said, however, that the execution should have been carried out in a more dignified way.

 An early official video appeared to show that Saddams execution had been conducted with dignity. However, a leaked video taken by a cellphone later showed the deposed Iraqi leader, a Sunni, being taunted by Shias as he stood on the gallows with a noose around his neck. The trapdoor was opened before he had finished his prayers.

 Bush said yesterday the hangings showed the Shia-dominated government of Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, charged by many with compounding the sectarian violence in Baghdad, has still got some maturation to do.

 He also admitted that he was frustrated by progress in Iraq. A year ago, I felt pretty good about the situation. I felt like we were achieving our objective, which is a country that can govern, sustain, and defend itself. No question, 2006 was a lousy year for Iraq.

 The comments came as it was revealed that Barzan had written to the UN pleading for his life before he was hung. Barzan told Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, that he had nothing to do with the killings in Dujail.

 Gharial romance

 Kuala Lumpur, April 25 (Reuters): A rare male Malaysian crocodile has changed zoos as wildlife officials hope to spark reptilian romance by finding him a suitable partner.

 Authorities this week moved Jantan, a gharial crocodile 4.7 m (15 ft) long and weighing 470 kg (1,036 lb), from a southern zoo to a breeding centre in Malaysias central state of Selangor to prepare for the session, the Star newspaper said. 

 Giant fossil

 Chicago (Reuters): Scientists

 have identified the Godzilla of fungi, a giant,

 prehistoric fossil that has evaded classification

 for more than a century, US researchers said

 on Monday.

 A chemical analysis has shown that the 20-foot-tall (6-metre) organism with a tree-like trunk was a fungus that became extinct more than 350 million years ago, according to a study appearing in the May issue of the journal Geology. Known as Prototaxites, the giant fungus originally was thought to be a conifer. 

 Cow run

 Berlin (Reuters): A pregnant cow being chased by police and fire fighters caused 25,000 euros ($33,900) of damage on a three-hour rampage through the German city of Hanover. Uschi escaped from a farm on Monday and became increasingly violent as she encountered shocked drivers and pedestrians in the city. She was brought down by tranquilliser darts, without harming her unborn calf, the fire services said.

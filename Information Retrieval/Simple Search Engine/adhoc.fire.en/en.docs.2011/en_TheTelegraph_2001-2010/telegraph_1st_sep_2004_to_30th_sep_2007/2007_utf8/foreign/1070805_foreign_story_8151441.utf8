 Strikes unsavoury: US

 Islamabad, Aug. 4 (Reuters): President George W. Bush today described the prospect of US strikes against al Qaida in Pakistan as unsavoury, saying Washington respected its allys sovereignty, the Pakistani government said.

 It said Bush made the comments to Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf in a telephone call to congratulate Pakistanis ahead of the 60th anniversary of their independence on August 14. Bushs comments followed a statement by Democratic presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama this week that the US must be willing to strike al Qaida targets inside Pakistan, a view Bush himself had earlier publicly espoused.

 Early guest

 London, July 11 (Reuters): Teacher Dave Barclay flew thousands of miles across the Atlantic to Wales to attend his friends wedding, only to discover he was a year early.

 Barclay, 34, was told about the wedding earlier in the year and assumed it was to take place in 2007.

 It was only when he had flown into Cardiff from Toronto, Canada, and rang the bridegroom seeking details of the venue that he discovered the wedding was in 2008.

 I am a year early yeah, my mates are loving it, arent they, he told BBC Radio Wales.

 The groom, Dave Best, had emailed his friend at the start of the year. He just said July the 6th and I assumed it was this year because if you tell the guy July 6th, theyre going to think its this year, Barclay said.

 Cash toilet

 Tokyo (Reuters): Packages

 containing 10,000 yen ($82) bills have been

 found this week in mens toilets at government offices throughout Japan, baffling officials as to why and who would do them such service. Most of the bills were accompanied by a message saying: Please use them for disciplining. The

 governments have handed the money to the police,

 but unless someone claims the cash it will

 be given to those who found it.

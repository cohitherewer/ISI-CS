 Nasa to take closer look at gouge on shuttle shield

 - ICE ON FUEL TANK MAY HAVE HIT CRAFT AT LAUNCH

 Houston, Aug. 11 (Reuters): Nasa said it would take a close look at a small but worrisome gouge in the heat shield of space shuttle Endeavour, discovered in photographs taken as the orbiter arrived yesterday at the International Space Station.

 The US space agency said ice may have developed on the shuttles fuel tank that may have struck the ships underside during Wednesdays launch from Florida, so a damage inspection using sensors on a robot arm will be performed tomorrow.

 Spacewalking astronauts will patch it up if Nasa decides the three-inch gash threatens Endeavours safety during its fiery return to Earth, said mission management team chairman John Shannon in a briefing at Johnson Space Center.

 He said other shuttles have returned safely with worse damage than this appears to be.In the past, we didnt even know we had damage and we flew back home, he said.

 But that was before shuttle Columbia broke up while returning to Earth in 2003 due to heat shield damage that occurred during launch but went undetected. 

 Its wing was struck by insulation foam that flew off the fuel tank.

 The seven astronauts on board died in the accident. Since then Nasa has incorporated three damage inspections into each flight, including one from photographs taken of the shuttles belly as it approaches the space station. After a two-day chase through space, the shuttle linked up with the station 344 km above Earth, bringing with it the next-to-last support beam to be installed on the unfinished space complex.

 Welcome on board, said station commander Fyodor Yurchikhin as a ships bell on the station was rung to signal the shuttles arrival, copying a naval tradition.

 After checking for leaks, hatches between the shuttle and station were pushed aside and one by one the Endeavour astronauts floated aboard.

 Teacher-turned-astronaut Barbara Morgan was given a rock-star welcome, with camera-wielding crew mates jockeying for position like paparazzi. 

 Morgan, 55, gave up teaching to become an astronaut and fulfill a commitment she made after the 1986 Challenger accident, which claimed the life of teacher-in-space Christa McAuliffe. Morgan served as McAuliffes backup.

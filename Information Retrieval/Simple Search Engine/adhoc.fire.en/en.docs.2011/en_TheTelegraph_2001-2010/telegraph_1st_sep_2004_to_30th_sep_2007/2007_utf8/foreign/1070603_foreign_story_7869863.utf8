 After 19 yrs in coma, Pole shocked

 Warsaw, June 2 (Reuters): A 65-year-old railwayman who fell into a coma following an accident in communist Poland regained consciousness 19 years later to find democracy and a market economy, Polish media reported today.

 Wheelchair-bound Jan Grzebski, whom doctors had given only two or three years to live following his 1988 accident, credited his caring wife Gertruda with his revival. It was Gertruda that saved me, and Ill never forget it, Grzebski told news channel TVN24.

 For 19 years Mrs Grzebska did the job of an experienced intensive care team, changing her comatose husbands position every hour to prevent bed-sore infections, Dr Boguslaw Poniatowski was reported as saying .

 When I went into a coma there was only tea and vinegar in the shops, meat was rationed and huge petrol queues were everywhere, Grzebski said. Now I see people on the streets with cellphones and there are so many goods in the shops it makes my head spin. Grzebskis four children had all married and produced 11 grandchildren.

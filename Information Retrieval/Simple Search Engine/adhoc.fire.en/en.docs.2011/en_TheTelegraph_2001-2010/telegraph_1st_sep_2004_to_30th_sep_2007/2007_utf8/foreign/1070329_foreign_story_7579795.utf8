 Versace heiress has anorexia

 Donatella Versace with her daughter Allegra

 Rome, March 28 (Reuters): Allegra Beck Versace, the 20-year-old heiress to the fashion house that bears her name, is suffering from anorexia, her mother said today in a statement aimed at stemming rumours about her daughters health.

 Our daughter, Allegra has been battling anorexia, a very serious disease for many years, Donatella Versace said in a joint statement with Allegras father Paul Beck. She is receiving the best medical care possible to help overcome this illness and is responding well. 

 A spokeswoman for the Italian fashion firm said Allegra was living at home in the US where she is a student, and not in hospital, as some Internet gossip has suggested. 

 As parents, we are doing our best to protect our daughter. However, due to numerous media reports, we want to let everyone know that we appreciate their concern for Allegra, and we ask that her privacy be respected at this time. Allegra owns 50 per cent of Versace.

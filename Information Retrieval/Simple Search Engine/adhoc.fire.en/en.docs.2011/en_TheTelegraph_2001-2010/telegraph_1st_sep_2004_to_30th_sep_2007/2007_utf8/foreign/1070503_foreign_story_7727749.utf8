 Dossier links AQ with Iran

 London, May 2 (PTI): Disgraced Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan helped Tehran make significant advances in its secret nuclear programme, a leading London-based think-tank revealed today.

 It said Khan clandestinely provided Iran with centrifuges, technical designs, components and an address book of suppliers. 

 Khan probably had some signal, if not explicit permission, from his superiors for nuclear cooperation with Iran, the International Institute for Strategic Studies said in its strategic dossier Nuclear Black Markets: Pakistan, A.Q. Khan and the Rise of Proliferation Networks released today.

 However, no evidence has yet emerged that a clear directive was ever given to Khan to provide nuclear technology to Iran, the 176-page dossier stated.

 Mark Fitzpatrick, editor of the publication, said Khan would have earned $100 million through his clandestine sale of nuclear technology, but could not say where the money had gone after his house arrest.

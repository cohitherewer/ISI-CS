 Panda diet

 Bangkok, Jan. 14 (AFP): A male panda in Thailand has been put on a low-carb diet because he is too heavy to mate with his partner. 

 Chuang Chuang weighs 150 kg, while his partner Lin Hui is a lithe 115 kg, said Kannika Nimtragol, a veterinarian at the Chiang Mai zoo in northern Thailand. We think Chuang Chuang should not weigh over 140 kg. Otherwise Lin Hui will carry too much weight while mating, she said. 

 To help Chuang Chuang slim down, zookeepers are feeding him fewer bread loaves and more bamboo branches.

 The court said the production house should have made sure the number was not in use before having a villain say it aloud on-screen. 

 The company was ordered to pay $256 to Chen Bing.

 Los Angeles, April 24 (Reuters): Former Washington Post reporter Carl Bernstein, who with Bob Woodward helped expose the Watergate scandal, has spent eight years researching the life of Hillary Rodham Clinton and will publish a 640-page biography of her in June, the publisher said yesterday.

 The book, to be published by Alfred A. Knopf, is called A Woman in Charge: the Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton and will have a first printing of 350,000 copies in the US, a Knopf spokesman said.

 He added that the size of the first printing was very high indicating that Knopf expected the book to be a best-seller at a time when Hillary, a Democratic US senator from New York and wife of former President Bill Clinton, is one of the front-runners in the battle to win the Democratic presidential nomination.

 Bernstein, known for his investigative reporting, interviewed more than 200 people, including friends, colleagues and adversaries of Clintons for the book, which covers her life up through the decision to run for the presidency.

 The Knopf spokesman said Bernstein did not interview Clinton or her husband for the book although he has had contact with them over the years.

 Sonny Mehta, chairman and editor-in-chief of the Knopf Publishing Group, said in a statement: Hillary Clinton is one of the most compelling figures in the world today... and Carl Bernsteins stunning portrait shows us, for the first time, the true trajectory of her life and career.

 I believe his book will stand as the most detailed, comprehensive, and revealing account we have of a woman who helped define one presidency and may well step into another.

 In the book, to hit stores on June 19, Bernstein explores Clintons complex relationship with her disciplinarian father, examines the early development of her deep religious feelings and looks at her courtship with Bill Clinton and the dynamic of their marriage, Knopf said in a statement.

 Alfred A. Knopf is the flagship imprint of the Knopf Publishing Group, a division of Random House Inc, whose parent company is Bertelsmann AG, the German media giant.

 Annette funds plea to Arnie

 Sacramento (California), Feb. 1 (AP): Actress Annette Bening hopes governor Arnold Schwarzeneggers new bipartisan approach will result in more state funding for the arts.

 Bening, a long-time Democrat and member of the California Arts Council, told delegates at the councils annual meeting on Tuesday that she is encouraged by the Republican governors willingness to cooperate on issues such as health care and the environment.

 We are the folks in the corner who are quietly raising our hand, suggesting that we also need some attention and we also need some funding, Bening said. And the thing about us is, we dont need a lot. We can do so much with so little.

 The two-time Oscar nominee said state funding for the arts council has been slashed from a high of $30 million in the 2000-01 budget to about $1.2 million (euro930,000) in Schwarzeneggers proposed 2007-08 budget.

 The councils overall budget is about $5 million (euro3.85 million) this year, money that includes funding from federal sources and the sale of special arts licence plates.

 Bening and her actor-director husband, Warren Beatty, battled with Schwarzenegger over the special election he called in 2005. Voters rejected all the governors ballot initiatives, which targeted public employee unions, teachers and state spending.

 At the Golden Globe awards earlier this month, Beatty joked about Schwarzeneggers transformation since then. I asked Arnold to become a Democrat, and he did what I said, Beatty said to laughter.

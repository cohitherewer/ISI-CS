 Moores goal: to save sick US society

 Cannes, May 19: The American documentary filmmaker Michael Moore, who has emerged as George Bushs would-be nemesis, was given an exceptionally friendly reception today in Cannes after the world premiere of his latest work. 

 Sicko, a documentary which paints one horror story after another of how American health insurance companies strive to maximise their profits by refusing to pay out to those most in need, is also by implication an attack on what Moore clearly sees as a sick society. 

 Less gripping than Fahrenheit 9/11, the documentary is certainly more important. Whatever happens in America, it does appear American patients will join Europeans in swelling the number of medical tourists heading for India. 

 Back in America, Moore, loved and loathed with equal vehemence, is now the countrys most controversial and successful documentary filmmaker his backers include Harvey Weinstein, who was present today and whose company has funded Sicko.

 It would be fair to say that Moore today projected himself as an M.F. Husain-type prophet hounded by the most barbaric of his own people. But the more the Bush administration and its lobby groups hound Moore, the more he is been able to ride the anti-American wave sweeping the world in the aftermath of Iraq. 

 The issue of health care is politically a critical one in the US and if the Republicans lose the next presidential election, Moore will have played a part in awakening the conscience of his people. So he would like it to be. 

 One man who accidentally severed two of his fingers while using an electrical saw was given a choice of which finger to save being a romantic the man chose a $12,000-operation on his ring finger rather than spend $60,000 to save the other finger.

 In several cases, patients, including in one case a baby, died while insurance companies Humana, Cigna, Blue Cross and other respected names found reason, usually allegedly contrived, to withhold payment. 

 Pointing out that 50 million Americans were without any health insurance at all, Moore made a powerful pitch for a government-funded health service, such as the one in France (the best in the world) and Britain. 

 As part of the documentary, Moore transported a boatload of Americans, including two very sick firemen from New York, to the Guantanamo Bay camp in Cuba so they could receive the same care that was being given to al Qaida prisoners. When this was not forthcoming, the patients were seen by doctors in Fidel Castros Cuba who were only too happy to make a political point by extending generous care to their visitors. 

 For contravening US government rules on travelling to Cuba, Moore now faces possible prosecution, even jail in theory. But, as he pointed out today, the American people might be more exercised about their 9/11 firemen who had been failed by the state. 

 It still seems unlikely that the Bush administration will want to make Moore even more of a martyr. But Moore acknowledged: I know the storm awaits me back in the US. He made a duplicate of his film, which he smuggled out of the US, in case authorities confiscated the original. 

 The documentary reveals that one man, who runs an anti-Moore hate website in the US, was about to close down his operation because he needed the money for his wifes urgent medical treatment. The man did not have to make the choice today, he learnt that the $12,000-cheque he received in the post from a well-wisher was from none other than Moore using a pseudonym. 

 Moore has also become an expert in using humour to make his point. There are 11 or 12 anti-Michael Moore documentaries, he joked. There is Michael and Me, Me and Michael, Michael Moore hates America, America hates Michael Moore. There is now a cottage industry of these films. I want to sponsor a film festival of anti-Michael Moore films. 

 To those who accused him of twisting the truth, he said: The record speaks for itself. Eighteen years ago I made a film that said General Motors was a giant about to fall. At the time I was criticised and ridiculed for uttering such blasphemy about the worlds largest corporation that could do no wrong. General Motors is (now) on the verge of bankruptcy. 

 He continued: I made Bowling for Columbine partially in the hope that school shootings would stop and that we would address this situation of how easy it is to get a gun in the US. Tragically, the school shootings continue. 

 He also argued: I made Fahrenheit 9/11 and I said that we were led to war under false pretences. I said it on the Oscar stage that this is a fictitious White House and I was booed off the stage for that. 

 He added: It is my profound hope that people will listen this time with this film because I dont want to wait 10 or 20 years before we have universal health coverage in America. And I dont want to wait 10 or 20 years before we, as Americans, take a look into our souls so that we can become better citizens in this world.

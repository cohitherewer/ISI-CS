 MIT first to offer 1800 courses online

 Boston, March 10 (Reuters): The Massachusetts Institute of Technology will become by the end of the year the first US university to offer roughly 1,800 courses free on the Internet, a school official said yesterday.

 We started this project because MIT believes that one of the best ways to advance education around the world is through the Internet, said Anne Margulies, head of online curriculum.

 Online students will not be able to earn an MIT degree or have contact with faculty at the university, located across the river from Boston in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

 MIT launched its OpenCourseWare programme in 2003 and already offers hundreds of courses online. A small number of other US schools are following suit. 

 Last month, 1.5 million users went to the MIT course site, sampling offerings like Cognitive Robotics, Inventions and Patents, and Superconducting Magnets. Most users gravitate toward the subjects MIT is best-known for: computer science, physics and mathematics, Margulies said. Their website is: http://web.mit.edu/

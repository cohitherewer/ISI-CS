 Congress starts with Democrats in control

 Washington, Jan. 4 (AP): Congress convened today with Democrats in control of both the House of Representatives and Senate for the first time in a dozen years. 

 Today we make history. Today we change the direction of our country, exulted Representative Nancy Pelosi, poised to become the first woman House leader in US history. Both Democrats and Republicans alike pledged cooperation despite years of bitter partisanship and gridlock, to try to get the 110th Congress off on a productive note.

 House Democrats also were ready to impose a ban on gifts from lobbyists and a clampdown on travel funded by private interests measures crafted in response to the ethics scandals that weakened Republicans in last autumns elections. Pelosi will lead a fractious House divided 233-202, with Democrats claiming control for the first time since 1994.

 Democrats maintain a tenuous hold on a Senate divided 51-49, with ailing Democrat Tim Johnson slowly recovering in a Washington hospital weeks after suffering a brain haemorrhage. The fragile Senate margin ensures little Democratic-sponsored legislation can pass without support Republican support.

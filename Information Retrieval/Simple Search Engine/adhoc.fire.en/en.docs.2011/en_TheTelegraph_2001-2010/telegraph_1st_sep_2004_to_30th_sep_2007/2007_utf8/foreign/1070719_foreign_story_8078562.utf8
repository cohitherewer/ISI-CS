 Double trouble

 Kuala Lumpur, July 18 (Reuters): Malaysian police were left red-faced after a man who abandoned the theft of a $280,000 Porsche for lack of fuel attempted the crime a second time and drove the sportscar out of a police station.

 The suspect had first attempted the theft on Monday at a luxury car showroom in northern Penang state. He asked for the car keys and promptly sped off.

 The car was later found abandoned a short distance away, its fuel tank empty.

 The New Straits Times said the man kept the keys and returned with a canister of petrol to a local police station where the car had been towed. He drove off with the Porsche, ditching it later after he discovered roadblocks had been set up to stop him.

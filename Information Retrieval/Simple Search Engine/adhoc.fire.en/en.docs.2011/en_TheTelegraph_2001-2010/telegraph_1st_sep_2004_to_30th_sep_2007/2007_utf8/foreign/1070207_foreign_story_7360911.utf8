The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Video leaked

 London,

 Feb. 6 (AP): A leaked video in which an American pilot is heard saying Were in jail, dude, after US troops killed a British soldier during a friendly fire incident in Iraq was released by The Sun newspaper today.

 Corporal Matty Hull died when troops fired on his convoy in the southern Iraqi city of Basra on March 28, 2003. 

 The pilot can be heard in the cockpit trying to establish whether targets on the ground are coalition forces or insurgents. One man asserts that orange panels on the vehicles could mean they are coalition forces most are equipped with bright markers to prevent such incidents.

 Another man is heard saying the orange markers look like rockets. I think killing these damn rocket launchers, it would be great, a man on the recording is heard. Two US A-10 jets allegedly opened fire on the Hulls tank, which was part of a five-vehicle convoy engaged in combat outside Basra.

 Four other soldiers were injured, including the convoys leader, Captain Alexander MacEwen.

 The convoy three British Scorpion tanks and two engineering vehicles had come to a halt at the edge of a shantytown near the southern Iraqi city of Basra. 

 The soldiers were being approached by a crowd of civilians carrying a white flag when they were attacked.

 The transcript printed in The Sun records the alleged exchange between the pilots after they realise what has happened.

 Pilot 1: Im going to be sick.

 Pilot 2: Ah f---.

 Pilot 1: Did you hear?

 Pilot 2: Yeah, this sucks.

 Pilot 1: Were in jail, dude.

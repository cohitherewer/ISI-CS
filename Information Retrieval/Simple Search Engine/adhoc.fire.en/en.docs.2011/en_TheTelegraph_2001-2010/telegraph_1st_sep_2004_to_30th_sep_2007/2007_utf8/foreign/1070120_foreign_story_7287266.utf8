 Blair aide held

 London, Jan. 19 (Reuters): A British political funding scandal edged closer to Prime Minister Tony Blair today when one of his key advisers was arrested on suspicion of obstructing justice. Ruth Turner, director of government relations in Blairs office, was arrested by police earlier today and has now been released without charge, a spokeswoman for Blair said.

 The widening probe has cast a shadow over Blair who is preparing to step down this year after a decade in power, his reputation tarnished by his backing for the Iraq war and by a series of government scandals. Turners arrest raised the possibility of somebody close to the Prime Minister being charged while he is still in office, political commentators said.

 Three other people, including the Labour Partys top fundraiser, Lord Michael Levy, have been arrested as part of the probe but it is the first time a top adviser in Blairs Downing Street office has been arrested. Ruth is a person of the highest integrity for whom I have great regard and I continue to have complete confidence in her, Blair said.

 Police questioned Blair as a witness in December, one of 90 people they have interviewed as part of the investigation, which has led to calls for reform of political party financing.

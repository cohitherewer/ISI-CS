 Hashmi demands Pervez resignation

 Hashmi, Musharraf 

 Lahore, Aug. 5 (AP): An outspoken Pakistani Opposition leader today demanded that military President Pervez Musharraf step down so upcoming elections could be held free of government interference.

 Javed Hashmi, the acting leader of exiled former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs party, spoke at a news conference today, a day after being released from prison on bail almost four years into a 23-year sentence for trying to incite a mutiny against Musharraf.

 He said Musharraf should allow Sharif and another exiled former Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto, to return to Pakistan to contest legislative elections due by early 2008. Presidential elections are also expected soon, with Musharraf seeking another five-year term.

 Hashmi said Musharraf should step down to prove that he was committed to free and fair elections.

 A man who held presidential elections according to his own wish, how can he be expected to hold transparent elections, Hashmi told a news conference in the eastern city of Lahore.

 In remarks aired today, Benazir reiterated her demand that Musharraf quit the army if he wants another term as President.

 We are opposed to everything to do with a uniformed presidency whether it is elections now or tomorrow or the day after, Benazir said in comments broadcast by Geo TV.

 She also warned that Musharraf would face legal challenges if he sought re-election from the current crop of lawmakers instead of those chosen at the upcoming legislative elections. Musharraf was elected by the current group, but getting enough from the next assembly is more uncertain.

 We think election from these assemblies will be disputed and this matter will definitely be challenged in the court, Geo quoted Benazir saying at a news conference during a visit to New York.

 Musharraf is facing the toughest period of his rule since he ousted Sharif in a bloodless coup eight years ago, with a combination of rising militant violence and growing political demands for the restoration of full democracy.

 Attacks and clashes yesterday killed 23 people in the northern tribal regions, where pro-Taliban militants have been waging a campaign against Musharrafs administration, a key US ally in the fight against terrorism. It was the latest in almost daily violence that has killed more than 350 people in the past month.

 The supreme court granted Hashmi bail on Friday on charges of treason and inciting an army mutiny against Musharraf. Hashmi will be free while the court considers whether it should review his case, which rights and Opposition groups have criticised as politically motivated.

 Hashmi told hundreds of members of Sharifs Pakistan Muslim League-N who had gathered to greet him outside the prison that true freedom for me will come the day when we will get rid of those generals who toppled the elected government.

 He left Lahore in a motorcade today for the capital, Islamabad, to attend the current session of the National Assembly tomorrow.

 He urged Pakistans main Opposition groups to unite against Musharraf.

 We should get rid of dictatorship, this should be the agenda of all parties, he said.

 Cleavage story irks Hillary team

 Washington, July 28 (AP): Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is insulted by news coverage about her cleavage, but her presidential campaign is not above using the publicity to raise money.

 Clintons campaign yesterday complained about a story that sparked conversation across the Internet. Would you believe that The Washington Post wrote a 746-word article on Hillarys cleavage? a campaign adviser asked in a fundraising pitch.

 Apparently, it was showing when she gave a speech in the Senate about the skyrocketing cost of higher education. Now, Ive seen some off-topic press coverage but talking about body parts? That is grossly inappropriate, the adviser wrote in the appeal.

 The Post story was written by Robin Givhan, who won a Pulitzer Prize last year for criticism of fashion as well as what politicians clothing says about their position and power.

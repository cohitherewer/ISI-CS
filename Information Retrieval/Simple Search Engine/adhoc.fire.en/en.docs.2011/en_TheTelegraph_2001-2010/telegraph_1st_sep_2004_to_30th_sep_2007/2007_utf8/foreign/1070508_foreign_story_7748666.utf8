 Shrek unites couple

 Los Angeles, May 7 (AP): Forget the stars of the movie, the princess and the ogre, Fiona and Shrek. Most cameras were focused on another couple at the world premiere of Shrek the Third: the movie actress and the pop star, Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake.

 The longtime pair split late last year, and though there has been a report of at least one brief Hollywood encounter, the Sunday-morning Shrek screening marked the first major media event at which theyve been photographed together since the breakup.

 Diaz, who voices Fiona, arrived first, making her way down the green carpet in a bright salmon Chanel dress, staying close to co-star Mike Myers. Timberlake, who plays would-be king Arthur, walked the press gauntlet just steps behind Diaz, though the two didnt appear to make eye contact during interviews. 

 But, later, at the cast photo, they were more than cordial, greeting each other with big smiles and sharing a hug and kiss.

 Though the film is one of the summers most anticipated, the Shrek players were thrown a lot of questions yesterday about a couple of other hot entertainment topics. Many reporters attempted, and failed, to get reactions to Fridays sentencing of celebrity Paris Hilton to 45 days in jail for violating her probation on an alcohol-related reckless-driving charge.

 Saturday Night Live actress Cheri Oteri, the voice of Sleeping Beauty in Shrek, managed to tie some of the films fairy tale themes to Hilton. You can be a princess in the positive sense of the word, she said. Just dont keep going out to clubs all night. Stay home once in a while. Learn to cook. Read some books. Take a class.

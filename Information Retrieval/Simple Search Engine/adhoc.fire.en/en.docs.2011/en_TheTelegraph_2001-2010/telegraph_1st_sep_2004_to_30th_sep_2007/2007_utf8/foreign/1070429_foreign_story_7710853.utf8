 Wolfowitz faces panel grilling

 Washington, April 28 (Reuters): World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz and his bank-employed girlfriend will appear before a special panel on Monday to discuss a promotion and raise he arranged for her that has sparked calls for his resignation.

 He will be appearing on Monday morning and making a full presentation to the committee, showing them that there is absolutely no merit at all in the allegation that there was a conflict of interest, Wolfowitzs lawyer, Robert Bennett, said. 

 Bennett will be present but will not be allowed to address the committee.

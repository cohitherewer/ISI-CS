 Another Bush aide plans to quit

 Snow: Financial reason

 Washington, Aug. 17 (Reuters): White House spokesman Tony Snow plans to leave his job before President George W. Bushs term ends in January 2009, citing financial reasons rather than his recurrence of colon cancer.

 In a radio interview this week, Snow, 52, did not reveal when he would leave. Snow earlier this year suffered a return of colon cancer and has been receiving chemotherapy. But he said his reasons for leaving would be financial. 

 Ive already made it clear Im not going to be able to go the distance, but thats primarily for financial reasons, Snow said on a conservative radio programme The Hugh Hewitt Show. 

 Ive told people when my money runs out, then ve got to go. Snow joined the the White House last year to become the voice of the administration.

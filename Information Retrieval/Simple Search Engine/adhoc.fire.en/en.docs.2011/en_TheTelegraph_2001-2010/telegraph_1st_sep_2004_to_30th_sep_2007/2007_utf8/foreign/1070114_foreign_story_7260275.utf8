 Jet attacks Tiger base

 Colombo, Jan. 13 (AP): A Sri Lankan air force bomber severely damaged a Tamil rebel base in the countrys east today, a defence ministry spokesman said.

 The rebels had used the artillery position at Verugal in Batticaloa district to fire at military camps in the area, said military spokesman Brigadier Prasad Samarasinghe.

 In one of the bases, there was a huge explosion suggesting that an ammunition deport was hit, Samarasinghe said. 

 One commando was wounded in the operation. Samarasinghe said there were no rebel casualties, as they fled the bases when attacked.

 China defence spend on a high, US frowns

 Beijing, March 4 (Reuters): China will boost defence spending by 17.8 per cent in 2007, accelerating the emerging powers string of annual double-digit rises in money for a modern military that reflects its economic strength.

 Jiang Enzhu, spokesman for the National Peoples Congress, said today that the planned budget for the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) this year was 350.92 billion yuan, or about $44.94 billion, an increase of 52.99 billion yuan on 2006.

 Chinas rising military spending since the 1990s followed many years of slimmed budgets and would not threaten other countries, Jiang said.

 In recent years, China has steadily increased defence spending based on its economic development, Jiang told a news briefing. China has neither the wherewithal nor the intention to enter into an arms race with any country, and China wont constitute a threat to any country.

 But his assurances did not comfort Washington, which has repeatedly criticised Chinas military spending as opaque, and were unlikely to sway neighbouring powers India and Japan, which have been lifting their own defence spending.

 Today, US deputy secretary of state John Negroponte said it was not the budget increase itself that concerned the US, but the lack of transparency in China over the intentions of its military rise.

 I think the point we would make with respect to military spending and military acquisition of various types would be the point about transparency, he told a news conference in Beijing, adding that Washington was dissatisfied with the level of detail China provides about its military.

 US vice-president Dick Cheney on a recent visit to Asia said that Chinas anti-satellite test and military build-up were not consistent with Beijings stated goal of a peaceful rise.

 The PLAs 17.8 per cent rise is the biggest recorded in the past decade, and was announced two months after China test-fired an anti-satellite missile, drawing criticisms of military brashness from Washington and regional capitals.

 Jiang said Chinas defence outlay was dwarfed by the Pentagons budget.

 The Bush administration has requested $484.1 billion for the defence department in the next fiscal year starting from October 2007. That figure does not cover military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

 Compared to other countries, especially major powers, Chinas defence spending is relatively low, Jiang said.

 Chinas 2007 increase comes after a 14.7 per cent increase in its defence spending in 2006.

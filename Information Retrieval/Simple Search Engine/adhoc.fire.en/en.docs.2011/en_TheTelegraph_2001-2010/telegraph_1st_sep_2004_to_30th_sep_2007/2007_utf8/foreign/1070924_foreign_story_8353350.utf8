 Flying to US? Mind three Rs

 TIM SHIPMAN

 Monitored 

 Washington, Sept. 23: The titles of books read by passengers flying to America are being recorded for use in compiling terrorist watch lists, according to documents released under freedom of information legislation in the US.

 Personal items carried on to aircraft, the details of passengers travelled with, information on relatives living in other countries, as well as race, are all recorded by American security officials, who have the right to keep the data for 40 years.

 The information, culled from airlines records, online ticket-booking agencies and customs and border guards, includes more personal detail than the information already demanded from passengers.

 The full extent of criminal and anti-terrorist monitoring has been laid bare after the Identity Project, a civil liberties group, demanded access to files on five of its members.

 One passenger who obtained his personal record found that customs and border-control officers at an American airport had recorded that he was carrying a book on drugs.

 The file of John Gilmore, a computer entrepreneur who funds the Identity Project, reads: PAX [passenger] has many small flashlights with pot leaves on them. He had a book entitled Drugs and Your Rights.

 The US department of homeland securitys automated targeting system also recorded the name of a second passengers planned travelling companion, even though they did not in fact travel together, creating a record of association that could be referred to years later.

 Security officers also routinely record the race of anyone pulled aside for extra screening at an American airport, a regular occurrence for tourists and business travellers.

 Human rights groups in the UK are already unhappy that all passengers have to supply passport details, credit card numbers and the address of where they will stay 48 hours before they fly to the US. They are then fingerprinted and photographed on arrival.

 Jen Corlew, the communications director of UK rights group Liberty, said: It is worrying indeed if US officials are keeping far more personal details than allowed by law.

 Our government has a duty to protect the personal details of British travellers, despite the demands of our closest allies.

 Bill Scannell, a spokesperson for the Identity Project, told the online magazine Wired, which broke the story: They are noting peoples race and writing down what people read. This is just plain wrong.

 Nigel Evans, a Tory member of the House of Commons all-party group on human rights, said: The American athorities are turning the fight against terrorism into a fight against liberty and freedom and against innocent people.

 Thats not the sort of society that they are fighting to defend in the US, where liberty of the individual and freedom of expression are one of the wonderful facets of America.

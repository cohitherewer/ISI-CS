 Hasina aide quits politics

 Jalil: Family first?

 Dhaka, July 5 (Reuters): The detained general secretary of Bangladeshs biggest party has decided to quit politics for health reasons, his wife announced today.

 She said Abdul Jalil, currently awaiting trial on charges of corruption and abuse of power, was sick and unable to perform his duties as number two in the Awami League, led by beleaguered former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

 He (Jalil) has conveyed his decision to quit politics considering his poor health and the future of his family and children, Rehana Jalil told reporters.

 She read out a statement from her husband, addressed to President Iajuddin Ahmed, in which he pleaded to be released from jail and accused the autocratic Hasina of destroying the party.

 Neither Hasina nor her aides were immediately available for comments.

 Analysts said Jalils decision dealt a further blow to Hasina, already reeling from news several former loyalists including some Awami presidium members were demanding drastic party reforms apparently aimed at ousting her from the top job.

 Jalil was arrested by army-led joint forces in late May as part of an anti-corruption drive, in which more than 170 key political figures have been netted.

 They include the elder son of Hasina rival Begum Khaleda Zia, another former Prime Minister, and more than a dozen former ministers from both the Awami League and Khaledas Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). Some have already been sentenced to various prison terms for graft and extortion while in power.

 A court on today jailed Ali Asgar, a former BNP lawmaker and former president of the Bangladesh Cricket Board, for eight years for dodging income tax worth 40 million taka ($580,000).

 Asgar, president of the Asia Cricket Council from 2004 to 2006, was ordered to pay a fine of 2.5 million taka ($360,000). The court confiscated his untaxed money.

 Like their Awami League rivals opposed to Hasinas continuing party rule, BNP reformists want Khaleda out but they need to wait until the army-backed interim government lifts a ban on indoor political activity.

 That would allow the various parties to convene national congresses to debate the reform plans. Both Khaleda and Hasina have vowed to challenge the reformists.

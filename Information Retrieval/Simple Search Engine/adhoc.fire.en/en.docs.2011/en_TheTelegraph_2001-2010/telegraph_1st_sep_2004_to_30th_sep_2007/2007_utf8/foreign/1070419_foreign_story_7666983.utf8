 Car bombs kill 170 in Baghdad

 Baghdad, April 18 (Reuters): Car bombs killed more than 170 people in Baghdad today in the deadliest attacks in the city since US and Iraqi forces launched a security crackdown aimed at halting the countrys slide into civil war.

 One car bomb alone in the mainly Shia Sadriya neighbourhood killed 122 people and wounded 155, police said.

 The street was transformed into a swimming pool of blood, Ahmed Hameed, a shopkeeper near the scene, told Reuters.

 US defence secretary Robert Gates, speaking in Tel Aviv on a visit to the region, called the bombings horrifying and indicated Sunni Islamist al Qaida was to blame.

 The apparently coordinated attacks there were four within a short space of time occurred hours after Shia Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said Iraq would take security control of the whole country from foreign forces by the end of the year.

 Maliki is under growing pressure to say when foreign soldiers will leave, but the attacks in mainly Shia areas of Baghdad underscored the huge challenges for Iraqs security forces in taking charge of overall security from more than 150,000 US and British troops.

 The bombings wounded more than 200 people.

 I saw dozens of dead bodies. Some people were burned alive inside minibuses. Nobody could reach them after the explosion, said a witness at Sadriya, describing scenes of mayhem at an intersection where the bomb exploded near a market.

 Women were screaming and shouting for their loved ones who died, said the witness who did not wish to be identified, adding many of the dead were women and children.

 One man waving his arms in the air screamed hysterically: Wheres Maliki? Let him come and see what is happening here.

 US and Iraqi forces began deploying thousands more troops onto Baghdads streets in February.

 Sectarian death squad killings have declined, but car bombs are much harder to stop, US military officials say.

 The bombings could inflame sectarian passions in Baghdad, especially among the Mehdi Army militia of anti-American Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, which has kept a low profile so far during the two-month-old Baghdad security offensive.

 Al Qaida is blamed for most of the major bombings targeting Shias in Iraq and there are fears the Mehdi Army may take to the streets to retaliate.

 The attacks came several hours after Maliki again appealed for reconciliation between majority Shias and once-dominant minority Sunni Arabs who form the backbone of the insurgency.

 There is no magic solution to put out the fire of sectarian sedition that some are trying to set up, especially al Qaida, Maliki said in a speech made on his behalf before the attacks.

 Flush figures

 Brussels, Feb. 5:

 Every Briton flushes 17.6 kg of toilet paper down the lavatory every year, almost two and half times the European average, according to tissue industry figures, reports The Daily Telegraph.

 British toilet paper consumption of 110 rolls per capita is 25 times that of Ukraines, Europes lowest. Americans pull 15.7 kg off the roll, ahead of western Europes average flush of 12.4, but still well behind the British. Out of the EU states, new Europes Baltic countries trail with 3.9 kg annual consumption, three times less than the Germans.

 Paris photo

 Los Angeles (AP): A US judge

 has told a website to stop selling photos,

 videos, diaries and other items belonging

 to heiress Paris Hilton that were once kept

 at a storage facility. Hilton sued www.ParisExposed.com last month, saying it exploited her personal belongings, including a reputed bubble bath video, for commercial gain. The injunction issued on Friday temporarily bars the website from releasing Hiltons health data and other personal information. Hiltons spokesman, Elliott Mintz, said he was pleased.

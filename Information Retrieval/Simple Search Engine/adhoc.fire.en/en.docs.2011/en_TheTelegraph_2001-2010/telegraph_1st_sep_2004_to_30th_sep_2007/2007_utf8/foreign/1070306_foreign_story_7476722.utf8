 Blair office denies leak

 London, March 5 (AP): Prime Minister Tony Blairs office denied today that it had leaked information relating to an investigation into alleged corruption in the political honours system.

 Blairs official spokesman issued the denial after Britains attorney general won an injunction yesterday prohibiting the BBC from publishing details of an email exchange between two of Blairs closest aides. The police are investigating allegations that honours including seats in the House of Lords and knighthoods were given in exchange for loans to the Labour or Conservative parties.

 Lord Levy, the Prime Ministers West Asia envoy and fundraiser, and Ruth Turner, a senior adviser, are among four people arrested in connection with inquiry. Any suggestions of the email being leaked from Blairs Downing Street were just plain wrong, said the Prime Ministers official spokesman. 

 The statements came in response to speculation that someone in Blairs office leaked the document in an effort to create publicity that could undermine any potential effort to prosecute. 

 The police said there were concerns that disclosure of information would impede the investigation, and that Lord Goldsmith, the attorney-general, was acting completely independently of government and in his independent public interest capacity. 

 The BBC said its report was a legitimate matter of public interest. Suggestions that we leaked or were trying to leak this information are just plain wrong and thats not based on my personal hunch, its because there are inaccuracies in reports which mean it cant have come from No. 10 (Downing Street), Blairs spokesman said.

 Angus MacNeil, a Scottish legislator who triggered the police inquiry, said that if anyone linked to the Prime Ministers office or the inquiry was found to be behind the leak to wreck the police investigation, it would be one of the most audacious attempts to pervert the course of justice.

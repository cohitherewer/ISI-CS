 Blairs quit threat to cops

 London, March 25: Police officers investigating the cash-for-honours scandal wanted to interview Tony Blair under caution but backed off after being warned that it could lead to his resignation, The Sunday Telegraph can reveal.

 Tony Blair was interviewed twice in six weeks 

 Allies of Blair indicated to Scotland Yard that his position as Prime Minister would become untenable if he were treated as a suspect, rather than simply as a witness.

 Detectives had hoped to question the Prime Minister under caution during the second of two interviews at No. 10. 

 It is understood that they wanted Blair to clarify comments he had made during his first interview about an alleged cover-up by his senior aides. Sources said there were difficult discussions before a political intermediary made senior detectives aware of the serious implications of treating Blair as a suspect.

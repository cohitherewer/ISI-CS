 Paris vows to shed party image

 New York, June 28 (Reuters): Hotel heiress Paris Hilton has launched a media make-over days after her release from a three-week jail stint, vowing to shed her party-girl image and prove she is a changed person.

 Im a good person. Im a compassionate person. I have a big heart. Im sincere, and theyll see, Hilton told People magazine in excerpts published yesterday from her first interview since getting out of jail on Tuesday in Los Angeles.

 Appearing later on CNNs Larry King Live show, the 26-year-old socialite said she felt bad that many of her former fellow inmates would end up back on the streets, and back in trouble, because they lack family or support systems. I want to help set up a place where these women can get themselves back on their feet ... kind of a transitional home, she said.

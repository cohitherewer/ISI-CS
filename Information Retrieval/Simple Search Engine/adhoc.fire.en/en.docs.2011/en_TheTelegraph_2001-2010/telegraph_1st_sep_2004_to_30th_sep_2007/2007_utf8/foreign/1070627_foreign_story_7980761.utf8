 Gyanendra first Shah king to reach 60

 Kathmandu, June 26 (PTI): King Gyanendra, who turns 60 on July 7, will be the only Shah dynasty king to have occupied the throne for such a long period in two-and-a-half centuries.

 According to the Narayanhity royal palace, all Shah kings passed away after they reached their 50s.

 However, Gyanendra, who relinquished power after a popular uprising last year, will celebrate the occasion in the palace. 

 It will be a low-key affair, the official said. There will be no official function or big party this time, he said, adding that the palace would remain open on that day to allow the people to wish Gyanendra.

 Even though the Nepal government scrapped a public holiday on the kings birthday last year, this time there is a holiday on Saturday, July 7, according to the Hindu calendar.

 The Kantipur daily reported that a party would be held at Hotel Soaltee Crown Plaza with some 1,700 guests. However, the palace official refused to confirm this. 

 Nepal has set November 22 as the date for Constituent Assembly polls to decide whether to retain the monarchy or declare Nepal a republic.

 harmful image

 New York, Jan. 22 (AP): Leonardo DiCaprio wanted to give up acting for a time after the hit movie Titanic.

 DiCaprio was back to being considered another piece of cute meat after the 1997 films spectacular box office success, an image he had wanted to get away after his days on the cover of teen magazines, he told Newsweek.

 It was pretty disheartening to be objectified like that. I wanted to stop acting for a little bit, he said at the magazines Oscar panel discussion with other actors. It changed my life in a lot of ways, but at the same time, I cant say that it didnt give me opportunities. It made me, for the first time, in control of my career.

 After many successful movies and critical acclaim, DiCaprio said he loves acting.

 Theres no other art form in the world that affects me more.Theres nothing that I walk away from feeling transformed by the way I do with cinema, he said.

 DiCaprio starred in The Departed, which earned Martin Scorsese a Golden Globe for best director.

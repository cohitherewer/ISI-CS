 Shanghai foul fine

 Shanghai, Jan. 29 (Reuters): Tired of tetchy residents engaging in obscenity-littered tiffs on the street, Shanghai authorities may fine the foul-mouthed as part of a new regulation governing behaviour at public venues, state media reported.

 While Shanghai residentsreluctance to settle arguments through fisticuffs was commendable, their propensity to let fly with a barrage of swear-words was less endearing, the Shanghai Daily today quoted the citys civilisation affairs office as saying.

 Dirty words often lead to fights, some of which may turn lethal, said Luo Huarong, a member of Shanghais legislative body. The city needs to draft a law that metes out fines to the offenders, she added.

 The size of the fine could vary depending on the income of the offenders, the paper quoted Jiang Dehuai, an academic researching the draft regulation, as saying.

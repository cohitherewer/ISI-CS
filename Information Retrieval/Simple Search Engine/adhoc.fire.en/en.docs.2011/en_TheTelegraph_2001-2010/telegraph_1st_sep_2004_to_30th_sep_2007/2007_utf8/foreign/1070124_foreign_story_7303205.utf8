 Lebanon strike

 Beirut, Jan. 23 (Reuters): Thousands of Shias and Christian protesters blocked roads in Lebanon with blazing tyres today in a campaign to oust the government, and at least a dozen people were wounded in gunfire between rival factions.

 At least 48 people were hurt in scuffles, especially in Beirut and Christian areas, security sources said.

 Black smoke billowed over Beirut as demonstrators shut main roads, including those to the port and international airport. Black-masked Hezbollah organisers prowled the streets on motorcycles, walkie-talkies clamped to their mouths.

 Lebanese soldiers fired into the air to keep stone-throwing crowds apart in Beirut and on a highway to the north. Daily life was paralysed in the capital and many other areas of Lebanon. This government only understands force and today is only a small lesson, protester Jamil Wahb said in the Shia southern suburbs. We will stay here until they give in.

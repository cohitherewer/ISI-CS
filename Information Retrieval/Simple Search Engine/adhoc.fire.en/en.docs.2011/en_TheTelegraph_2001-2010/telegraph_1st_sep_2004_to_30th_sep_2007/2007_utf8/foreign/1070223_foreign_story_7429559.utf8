 After 25 years, a royal leads charge

 Into combat

 London, Feb. 22 (Reuters): Prince Harry, who is third in line to the British throne, is being deployed to Iraq, the ministry of defence (MOD) said today.

 Harry could become the first member of the royal family to face combat since his uncle, Prince Andrew, flew helicopters in the 1982 Falklands War. Harrys great-grandfather, King George VI, saw action in World War I. A ministry spokesman said the prince would be sent to Iraq with his A Squadron of the Blues and Royals regiment over the next few months.

 The announcement comes a day after Britain said it would be withdrawing almost a quarter of its 7,100 troops from Iraq in coming months. But British soldiers would remain in the country into 2008 if Iraq wanted them to provide support and training. The flame-haired younger son of the late Princess Diana had always stressed that if his unit were to go into battle, he would want to be leading them.

 Harrys regiment will leave for Iraq in May or June and could serve up to seven months there, defence secretary Des Browne said.

 The 22-year-old prince, who as a Second Lieutenant has the rank of Cornet in his regiment, had reportedly threatened to quit the army if not allowed to serve on the frontline. 

 He has trained to become troop commander and will be leading 12 men in four Scimitar armoured reconnaissance vehicles.

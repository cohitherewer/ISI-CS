 From blonde to bald

 Britney: Dainty lips

 Los Angeles, Feb. 17 (AP): Britney Spears appeared in a tattoo parlour in California with her head shaved completely bald.

 Video on KABC-TV showed the newly shorn Spears with tiny tattoos on the back of her neck as she sat yesterday night for a new tattoo a pair of red and pink lips.

 She just wanted something real small on her wrist, something dainty, Max Gott, the tattoo artist at Body and Soul in Sherman Oaks, told the TV station. She got some cute little lips on her wrist.

 Derrik Snell, who works at the tattoo parlour, said Spears showed up without notice and stayed for about 90 minutes as about 60 fans, photographers and gawkers gathered outside. She seemed fine, Snell said. I didnt really notice (the hairdo) at first, she had a hood on when she showed up.

 The appearance came the same day as reports on TV and websites that Spears, who has drawn criticism for her recent partying and sloppy behaviour, had briefly checked into rehab.

 Larry Rudolph, Spearss manager, could not be reached for comment.

 Syndicated entertainment TV show Extra first reported that Spears had entered a treatment facility. Celebrity website www.tmz.com then said the singer had entered a treatment centre but had checked out one day later. Neither revealed their sources.

 People magazines website, citing a source, said Spears had gone in and out of rehab, and identified the facility as Eric Claptons Crossroads centre on the Caribbean island of Antigua.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 UK seeks handover of ex-KGB agent

 - Diplomatic collision looms after British prosecutors level murder charge

 Litvinenko and Lugovoy: Comrade

 turns murderer? 

 London, May 22 (Reuters): British prosecutors today accused a former KGB agent of poisoning Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko with radioactive polonium and demanded his extradition, setting London and Moscow on a diplomatic collision course.

 The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it wanted to bring suspect Andrei Lugovoy before a British court and charge him with the extraordinarily grave crime of murdering exiled Russian Litvinenko in London last November.

 Britains foreign office summoned the Russian ambassador and told him in strong terms it expected full cooperation over Lugovoys case, but Russias Prosecutor-General office said the constitution prevented it from extraditing Russian citizens.

 No one should be under any doubt about the seriousness with which we regard this case. Murder is murder, British Prime Minister Tony Blairs spokesman said.

 Lugovoy denied the accusation and told Itar-Tass news agency: I consider this decision politically motivated.

 He added: I did not kill Litvinenko, have nothing to do with his death and can prove with facts my distrust of the so-called evidence collected by Britains justice system.

 The murkiest case of murder and espionage since the Cold War had already strained diplomatic relations and the extradition move looked certain to aggravate tensions further.

 Blairs spokesman stressed Britain had important political and economic ties with Russia. This doesnt in any way obviate the need for the international rule of law to be respected, and we will not in any way shy away from trying to ensure that happens in a case such as this, he said.

 Russian prosecutors said they would give their full attention to any charges against Lugovoy once they received official documents from Britain, and opened the possibility he could be tried in his homeland.

 Russias foreign ministry said it expected more detailed information on the case, but ruled out Lugovoys extradition. We have repeatedly declared our readiness to cooperate with British colleagues in a thorough investigation of this case, and we are interested in an objective and unbiased clarification of all the consequences, the foreign ministry said in a statement.

 Litvinenko, a former KGB agent who had become a fierce critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin in exile, met Lugovoy and another Russian businessman, Dmitry Kovtun, at the Pine Bar of Londons Millennium Hotel on November 1 last year.

 Within hours, he had fallen severely ill. He suffered an agonising death over the next three weeks as his organs gradually failed. Images of his emaciated body, hooked up to medical tubes, were published around the world.

 Doctors eventually diagnosed poisoning by polonium 210, a highly toxic radioactive isotope.

 In a letter dictated on his deathbed, Litvinenko, who had acquired British citizenship weeks before he was poisoned, accused Putin of his murder.

 Moscow dismissed the accusation as ridiculous. It has launched its own investigation into Litvinenkos death and denies its security services played any part.

 A CPS spokeswoman said it would ask the police to send an arrest warrant to the Russian authorities.

 Litvinenkos widow Marina said she had told the Russian ambassador at a meeting today that the best way to restore Russias reputation was to extradite Lugovoy.

 It is important to me that my husband didnt die in vain and that the perpetrators of his murder are brought to justice in the UK, she said in a statement. I will not rest until I know that justice has been done.

 Andrei who?

 Russian

 businessman 

 Andrei Lugovoy was a KGB officer from the late 1980s

 when he worked in the department 

 that protected senior Soviet officials. He left the

 FSB, the KGB rsquo;s 

 successor, at the end of 1996 and later worked as

 head of security for tycoon Boris Berezovsky.

 Lugovoy met former spy Alexander Litvinenko at the

 Millennium

 Hotel in Grosvenor Square on November 1 along with

 another Russian, Dmitry Kovtun. Later that day, Litvinenko

 complained of feeling ill and was admitted to hospital.

 He died three weeks later from polonium 210 poisoning.

 Lugovoy was treated last year in an isolated unit

 at a Moscow hospital that took care of victims of the

 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster. He refused to say

 what he was being treated for but some media reported

 he had radiation poisoning.

 Lugovoy has denied any involvement

 in Litvinenko rsquo;s death.

 Lugovoy

 says he had known Litvinenko casually for 

 about 10 years and that in 2005 Litvinenko called

 him offering contacts. He said Litvinenko was helping

 him in talks with British businesses and named Erinys,

 a British-based firm that offers companies security

 services and terrorist risk analysis.

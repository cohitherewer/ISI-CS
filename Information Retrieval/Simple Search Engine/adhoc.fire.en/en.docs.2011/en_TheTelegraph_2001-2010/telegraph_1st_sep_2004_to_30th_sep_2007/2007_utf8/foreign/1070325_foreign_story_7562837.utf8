 Hermione set for return

 Cant let go

 Los Angeles, March 24 (Reuters): Countering widespread speculation, Harry Potter actress Emma Watson has decided to reprise her role as girl wizard Hermione Granger in the final films of the hit series, Warner Bros. said yesterday.

 Along with Watson, Rupert Grint will return as Harrys friend, Ron Weasley, and as previously announced, Daniel Radcliffe signed up to return as boy wizard Harry in the sixth and seventh installments of the seven-part series.

 I could never let Hermione go she is my hero!, Watson said in a statement from the Warner Bros. film studio.

 I love her too much and love what playing her has meant to me.

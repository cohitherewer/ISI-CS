 $370 for green card without expiry date

 Houston, Aug. 23 (PTI): One million legal US residents whose green cards do not have expiry dates may soon have to pay $370 to replace them or face possible imprisonment.

 Green cards are proof of authorisation to live and work in the US.

 The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) yesterday announced a proposal to require nearly 750,000 legal permanent residents, who were issued green cards between 1977 and 1989 that lack expiry dates, to replace their cards. 

 The plan does not require congressional approval and will most likely become reality later this year.

 The proposed change, once finalised, gives applicants 120 days to update their cards. Those who willfully neglect to comply could face up to 30 days in jail or pay a fine of up to $100, or both.

 The change would allow US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to issue more secure permanent resident cards, update cardholder information, conduct background checks and electronically store applicants fingerprint and photographic information, the agencys statement said.

 Although the change would not invalidate the legal status of cardholders, the proposal notes that failure to obtain replacement cards could cause problems when traveling or looking for work. The proposal states that affected permanent residents must apply between October 22 and February 19. 

 Earlier, immigration authorities had encouraged permanent residents with old-style green cards issued before 1989 to renew them but replacement was not mandatory. All green cards issued after 1989 expire every 10 years.

 The new proposal requires applicants to provide current biographic and biometric (photographs and fingerprint) information. 

 The rule also proposes a mechanism for terminating green cards without an expiration date. Under the rule, USCIS would be able to terminate permanent resident cards without an expiration date.

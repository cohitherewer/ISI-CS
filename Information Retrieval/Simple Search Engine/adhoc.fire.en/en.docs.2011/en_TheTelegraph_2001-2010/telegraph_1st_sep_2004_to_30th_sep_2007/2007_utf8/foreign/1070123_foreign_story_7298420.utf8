 Bush shirt ban

 Canberra, Jan. 22 (Reuters): An airline passenger barred from a flight for wearing a T-shirt labelling President George W. Bush a terrorist has threatened legal action against Australias flag carrier Qantas.

 Allen Jasson, 55, an Australian IT expert who lives in Britain, was stopped from boarding a London-bound Qantas flight at Melbourne Airport last Friday for wearing what the airline said was an offensive T-shirt.

 Airline staff said the T-shirt of Bush with the tagline: Worlds number 1 terrorist could have upset other passengers and demanded it be changed for another.

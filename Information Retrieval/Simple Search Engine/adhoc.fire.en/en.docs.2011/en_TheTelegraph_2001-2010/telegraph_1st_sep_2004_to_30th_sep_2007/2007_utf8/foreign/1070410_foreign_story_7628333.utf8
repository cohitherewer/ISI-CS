 Iran snub

 Natanz (Iran), April 9 (Reuters): Iran announced today it had begun industrial-scale nuclear fuel production in a fresh snub to the UN Security Council, which has imposed two rounds of sanctions on it for refusing to halt such work.

 The announcement marks a shift from experimental atomic fuel work involving a few hundred centrifuges used for enriching uranium to a process that will involve thousands of machines.

 Western nations fear this will bring Tehran closer to what they say is its aim of building atomic bombs. Iran insists it only wants the fuel for generating electricity so it can export more of its oil and gas.

 I proudly announce that as of today Iran is among the countries which produce nuclear fuel on an industrial scale, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said at the Natanz uranium enrichment facility in central Iran.

 Washington swiftly denounced the declaration, saying it was a further sign Iran was defying the international community. Iran had said it would install 3,000 centrifuges as a first stage towards industrial-scale output.

 Kathmandu, Aug. 30: The Nepal government and the Madhesi Janaadhikar Forum (MJF) today signed a landmark agreement that ended the ethnic groups eight-month-long agitation for equal rights for Nepalis of Indian-origin living in the southern plains.

 The deal, signed by the governments chief negotiator and minister for peace and reconstruction Ram Chandra Poudel and MJF chairman Upendra Yadav, finally brings the curtain down on a period of violence in the plains. As a result of the pact, the MJF called off its agitation which had brought life to a standstill in the Terai and affected the flow of essential supplies to the Kathmandu valley. 

 Among other things, the two sides agreed to form a commission for the restructuring of the state in order to make it more federal in nature. However, the boundaries and rights of all new states will be decided by the Constituent Assembly. 

 The government agreed to provide compensation to the families of all Madhesi activists killed during the movement and promised free treatment for all those who were injured. It will also withdraw cases against the Madhesi leaders and activists. 

 The government also agreed to provide adequate representation to all minority communities in all departments and organisations of the state. An assurance was given to recognise the culture of the Madhesis.

 Masjid crisis deepens

 Islamabad, May 21 (Reuters): Hardline religious students confronting authorities in the Pakistani capital for months abducted three more policemen today, taking to five the number of police they are holding.

 Taliban-supporting clerics and students associated with Islamabads Lal Masjid, or Red Mosque, have undertaken a series of provocative actions since January to press for various demands, and have even threatened suicide bomb attacks.

 The radical students kidnapped four policemen last week to press for the release of some of their people whom authorities detained earlier. The students released two of the policemen on Saturday but grabbed more today, police said.

 They abducted three of our policemen who were on patrol. They were forced into the madarsa, said city police officer Zafar Iqbal, referring to a religious school in the north of the city, whose students are associated with the Lal Masjid.

 The behaviour of the students, reminiscent of the Taliban in Afghanistan, coupled with the authorities failure to rein them in, has dismayed many residents of the countrys cosmopolitan capital. The government, struggling with a judicial crisis, has tried to mollify the radical Islamists, and said last month all issues with them had been settled amicably.

 But yesterday, following the kidnapping of four police, security forces picked up about 40 of the radicals in so-called preventative detentions in preparation for a crack down, a senior city administrator said.

 The Daily Times newspaper called the situation an absurdity in an editorial today and questioned whether authorities were putting the radicals up to their shenanigans to divert public attention from the governments mounting woes.

 In January, female religious students occupied a childrens library next to their religious school, to protest against a city campaign to remove mosques built illegally on state land. The government stopped the campaign but the students still occupy the library. Later, students went around video shops, urging shopkeepers to stop selling films deemed obscene.

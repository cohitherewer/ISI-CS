 Zeta-Jones puts family before films

 New York, June 21 (AP): Catherine Zeta-Joness main priority is not her acting career, its her husband, Michael Douglas, and their two young children.

 Years ago if someone said they were doing a movie in Romania, I was, like: What time is my flight? I couldnt see beyond the script, the 37-year-old actress tells InStyle magazine in its July issue. Now Im like: Script? Ill figure that out after dealing with the people I love more than anything in the world.

 Zeta-Jones, who won a 2003 supporting actress Oscar for her role in Chicago, married Douglas in 2000. They have two children son, Dylan, 6, and daughter, Carys, 4 and live much of the year on the island of Bermuda. The couple also have homes in Manhattan and Mallorca, Spain, and a farm in Quebec, Canada. Some people collect art, she says. We collect houses. 

 Zeta-Jones is not about to quit acting just yet. In No Reservations, she portrays a chef whose life takes a new turn.

 Tintin unites Spielberg, Jackson

 Los Angeles, May 15 (AFP): Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson are to join forces to direct and produce a series of three films based on the beloved Belgian comic-strip hero Tintin, a report said. 

 Hollywood journal Daily Variety reports in todays edition that the legendary filmmakers would direct at least one film each and produce all three. The report said Tintin had been a long-time pet project for Spielberg, who finally secured the film rights to the comic series in the past 12 months.

 Jackson had already developed a test film which had brought the characters created by George Remi, better known as Herge, to life, the report said.

 Spielberg said the computer animation technology used for the films would be unlike anything ever seen. Herges characters have been reborn as living beings, expressing emotion and a soul which goes far beyond anything weve seen to date, Spielberg said.

 Crow sings a warming message

 Green tune

 New York, April 11 (AP): Sheryl Crow, riding aboard a bus that uses biodiesel fuel, is on an 11-stop college tour to raise awareness about global warming.

 Accompanying the Grammy-winning singer is Laurie David, who produced the film on climate change, An Inconvenient Truth, which won the Oscar for best documentary earlier this year. Each stop on the tour will include remarks by David, a short performance by Crow, clips from An Inconvenient Truth and a dialogue with students, according to Crows website: www.sherylcrow.com.

 The more I learn about global warming, the more I know that we all have to do something to be a part of the solution, Crow, 45, said. I am thrilled Laurie and I have the opportunity to go on the road and combine our efforts to educate the next generation on how they can make a difference.

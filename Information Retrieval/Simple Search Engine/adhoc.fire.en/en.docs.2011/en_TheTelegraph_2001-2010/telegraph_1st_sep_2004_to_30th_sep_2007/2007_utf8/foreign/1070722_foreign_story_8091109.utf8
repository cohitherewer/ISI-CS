 Qaida rise worries Bush

 Operation Polyp

 Washington, July 21 (Reuters): President George W. Bush said today he was troubled by a US intelligence reports finding that al Qaida had become entrenched in a safe haven in Pakistans tribal region near Afghanistan.

 But Bush offered support for Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf, saying he believes Musharraf was committed to fighting al Qaida.

 A portion of the National Intelligence Estimate made public this week found a persistent and evolving threat to the US from Islamic militant groups.

 In his taped weekly radio address, Bush said the reports assessment that al Qaida was gaining strength in the tribal region of Pakistan was one of the most troubling.

 Doctors removed five small polyps from Bushs colon today. They all measured less than a centimetre and none appeared worrisome, a spokesman said.

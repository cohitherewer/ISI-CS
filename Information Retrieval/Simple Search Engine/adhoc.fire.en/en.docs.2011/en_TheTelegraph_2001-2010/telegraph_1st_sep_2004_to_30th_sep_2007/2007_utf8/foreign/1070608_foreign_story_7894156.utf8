 Powers to muzzle TV stations lifted

 Islamabad, June 7 (Reuters): Pakistan has suspended powers that critics said muzzled television coverage of a political crisis that threatens stability in a country on the front line of a global anti-terrorism campaign.

 President Pervez Musharraf, facing the biggest challenge to his authority since he took power in a coup eight years ago, was reported bemoaning government parties failure to support him after he suspended the countrys top judge on March 9.

 Opposition parties calling for democracy and the reinstatement of Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry held peaceful protests in several cities despite the detention of hundreds of activists by authorities trying to thwart rallies.

 About 40 people were killed in clashes in Karachi last month. While General Musharrafs political support base has been weakened in an election year, his backing from the army and the US has been firm. The US would view with alarm instability in a nuclear-armed ally where al Qaida leaders are believed to be hiding. Pakistans help is also seen as crucial in the fight against the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan.

 Authorities, struggling to contain the anti-government campaign, have curbed the media, particularly television.

 But information minister Mohammad Ali Durrani said today the government had suspended an ordinance introduced this week giving broad powers to shut broadcasters, pending a review. 

 Reporters Without Borders hailed the governments rethink on a decree that US-based Human Rights Watch said muzzled broadcasters.

 The determined opposition of Pakistani journalists and the support of the international community forced the government to back down on its draconian plan, the reporters group said.

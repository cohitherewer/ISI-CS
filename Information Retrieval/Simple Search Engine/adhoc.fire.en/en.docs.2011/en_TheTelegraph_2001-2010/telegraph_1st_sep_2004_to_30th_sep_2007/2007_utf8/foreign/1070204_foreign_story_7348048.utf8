 Churchs Jesus Loves Osama sign criticised

 MATTHEW MOORE

 Stormy slogan

 London, Feb. 3: The Australian Prime Minister has criticised a Sydney Baptist church for erecting a sign declaring Jesus Loves Osama.

 The sign has been placed outside several churches in Sydney 

 The slogan, a reference to Osama bin Laden, the al Qaida leader, has provoked a storm of controversy across the country despite its apparently Christian message of forgiveness.

 Small print at the bottom of the sign urges churchgoers to Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, a quotation from Matthew 5:44.

 But John Howard, the Prime Minister, said the church should have chosen a less offensive way of spreading its message. 

 I understand the Christian motivation of the Baptist church, he said.

 But I hope they will understand that a lot of Australians, including many Australian Christians, will think that the prayer priority of the church on this occasion could have been elsewhere.

 Peter Jensen, the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney, said that the sign which has been put up outside several churches in the city was confusing and potentially offensive.

 There is a truth in it, he said. But, what weve got to say is Jesus doesnt approve of Osama. It makes it sounds like Oh, Osamas doing the right thing.

 A spokesman for the Central Baptist Church told the Australian Daily Telegraph that it was merely sharing the Gospel.

 He said: Osama is the head of terrorism. We are saying that Jesus Christ loves everyone in the world, even this man.... All we are doing is sharing the Gospel.

 Freezing US gets warming reminder

 Washington, Feb. 15 (Reuters): Corporate moguls, policy experts and US Senators spoke with one voice about global warming yesterday, telling a world forum that the US must take a lead role in cutting greenhouse gases if it wants to encourage China and India to do the same.

 As Washington DC remained snowbound and chilly, representatives from the Group of Eight industrialised nations plus China, India, South Africa, Brazil and the EU met at Capitol Hill.

 Senator John McCain put the case for action on climate change bluntly. The debate is over, my friends, the Arizona Republican said. 

 Now the question is what do we do? Do we act, do we care enough about the young people of the next generation to act seriously and meaningfully, or are we going to just continue this debate and this discussion?

 McCain said the push to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that spur global climate change was a national security issue

 McCain and Senator Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut independent, have pushed legislation that would set limits on the emission of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide, and allow those that exceed them to trade with others that are under the limit, a plan known as cap-and-trade.

 Jim Rogers, the chief of Duke Energy, applauded the mandatory cap-and-trade approach, and stressed that if the US did not act soon to cut greenhouse emissions, fast-developing China and India probably would not participate in any global emissions-cutting programme.

 Maoists ask for republic

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Kathmandu, April 15: The Maoists have formally asked parliament to declare Nepal a republic, pending elections to the constituent Assembly that will take a final decision. 

 The central committee of the Maoists met today and adopted a resolution. The meeting was convened in the aftermath of the Election Commission expressing inability to conduct the elections within the June 20 deadline.

 Maoist leader Prachanda told reporters after the meeting that a republic should be established before the new schedule for the election is announced.

 He said the ruling eight-party alliance had earlier agreed that parliament could formally declare a republic through a resolution adopted with two-thirds majority.

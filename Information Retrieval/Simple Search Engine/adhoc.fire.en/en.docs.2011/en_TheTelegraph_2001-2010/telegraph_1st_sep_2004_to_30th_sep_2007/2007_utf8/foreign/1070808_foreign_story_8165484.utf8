 Georgia says Russia fired missile at village

 Tsitelubani (Georgia), Aug. 7 (Reuters): Georgia accused Russia today of violating its airspace and firing a missile at a village deep in its territory, but Moscow denied carrying out an attack that renewed long-running tensions with Tbilisi.

 Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili said the missile, which did not explode, was part of a pattern of Russian aggression against its neighbours across Europe and urged European states to condemn Moscow.

 This is not Georgias problem. This is a problem for European security and safety, Saakashvili said in English after travelling to the village of where the missile landed.

 In Tbilisi, Russias ambassador was summoned to the foreign ministry and handed a note of protest over the missile, which officials said was fired by a Russian Sukhoi jet that entered Georgian airspace from Russia.

 The missile, fired at about 1530 GMT yesterday, burrowed into a field of corn and potatoes near the village of Tsitelubani. An interior ministry official said it would have caused a disaster if it had detonated.

 Russian officials said their aircraft was nowhere in the region. They suggested Georgian jets may have fired the missile on their own territory as a way of provoking tensions in the region.

 At the scene, about 65 km west of Tbilisi, Saakashvili said Georgias reaction would be one of remarkable calm ... which is what they are not expecting. He drew a parallel with cyber-attacks on Russias neighbour Estonia this year, which some there blamed on the Kremlin and said European states should not appease Moscow.

 I dont really see how often it can happen and how further these intrusions might go before the international community has a really strong reaction, he said.

 We all should stop them before its too late. I think this time well get much more outcry and much more reaction.

 The incident reignited tensions between Tbilisi and Moscow that have lurched from one crisis to another since Georgia elected the pro-western Saakashvili in 2004. He has assertively pulled his small former Soviet country out of Russias orbit.

 Some analysts speculate a row with Georgia could play into the hands of cliques inside the Kremlin jostling for position ahead of the 2008 presidential election.

 Moscow denied a Russian jet fired the missile and called for an investigation to find out who was responsible. Russias foreign ministry pointed the finger back at Tbilisi, making a link with a missile attack in March on Georgias Kodori gorge. Tbilisi blamed that attack on Moscow.

 Confirmed: Shambo dead

 AMIT ROY

 London, July 27: The Welsh government Assembly and the farming lobby were today celebrating a famous victory after slaughtering Shambo almost immediately after taking him away late last night past weeping Hindus from the Skanda Vale community centre in Llanpumsaint, west Wales.

 Yesterday, it had taken a small army of policemen and vets, armed with bolt cutters, to secure Shambo from the care of the monks. After patting him on the back and saying he was a good boy, the trusting bull was persuaded onto a trailer and driven away. He was quickly injected with a lethal injection before the monks could mount a further legal challenge to keep him alive.

 The reason why the authorities wanted to put him down was because Three months ago, Shambo tested positive to exposure from bovine TB. The monks said they would keep him isolated or explore the possibility of sending him to a sanctuary in India but both suggestions were rejected. And today, the Welsh authorities sought to justify the slaughter by claiming a post mortem had revealed that Shambo had lesions typical of TB. But since the authorities had refused a request from the monks to carry out a second test to make sure the first was sound, this new claim will be treated with a certain amount of scepticism by the monks and the Hindu population at large. 

 The Welsh authorities, backed by the farming lobby, became involved in a battle of wills with the monks and were determined to prove theirs would prevail. They were not impressed with the argument that a bull could have religious significance and without the intervention of India House, the battle was lost before it began. However, by ignoring the wishes of a significant proportion of the one million Hindus in the UK, the authorities may have laid the seeds of future Hindu militancy.

 We must now behave like militant Muslims, a small but vocal section of hot-headed Hindus will now say.

 The monks line that all life is precious had no takers among their enemies.

 Nor content with putting Shambo down, the Welsh authorities are now threatening to put down more cattle at Skanda Vale. The monks have about 50 though the late Shambo became the most famous and loved of them all. 

 The Welsh government after devolution Wales now has a quot;government quot; said today that it was it was now considering what other action was necessary to protect human and animal health in relation to the test results from other animals in the herd. 

 Further samples have been taken for further laboratory investigations, including bacteriological culture - these results will not be available for several weeks, continued the statement.

 This will be taken as a threat to the monks that if they did not accept defeat quietly, they risked having more of their cattle slaughtered.

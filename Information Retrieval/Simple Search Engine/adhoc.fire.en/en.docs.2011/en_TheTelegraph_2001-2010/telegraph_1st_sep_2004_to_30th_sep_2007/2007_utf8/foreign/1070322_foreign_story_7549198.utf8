 Kathmandu , March 21: The Terai plains on the border with India were rocked by fresh violence between Maoists and activists of the Madhesi Janadhikar Forum (MJF) killing 25 people, including two women. 

 The two groups, which have been at loggerheads since January 19 when a Maoist killed an MJF activist in Lahan, clashed at Gaur in Rautahat district, south central Nepal, after Maoist cadre obstructed a gathering that was being organised by the MJF. 

 Senior superintendent of police Ganga Pandey told The Telegraph over the phone that 35 people were injured in the clash during which both groups opened fire. He said the injured were being treated at Gaur Hospital and the condition of six of them was critical. Cross-firing occurred immediately after the clash. Ten persons died of bullet injuries, Pandey said.

 He added that the Rautahat district administration office imposed a curfew in Gaur and its vicinity from 2.45 pm to 4 am tomorrow. 

 Local witnesses said that the Maoist-affiliated Madhesi Rashtriya Mukti Morcha erected a podium near a dais constructed by the MJF. The MJF had announced their programme a week ago, while the Morcha finalised its own programme last night, a local journalist said. The situation in Gaur was extremely tense after the incident, the journalist added. 

 The violence in the Terai came as businessmen paralysed life for the second consecutive day in the Kathmandu valley and other towns in protest against Maoist extortions. 

 The Nepal chambers of commerce called for the business shutdown after Maoists kidnapped and tortured a hotelier on Sunday. 

 After the strike was over, top leaders of the eight political parties met at Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koiralas residence and decided to address the demands of the business community. 

 Nepali Congress leader Arjun Narsing KC said after the meeting that the top leaders had agreed to help create a free and conducive environment for business. They also agreed to provide adequate security to the industries. 

 Earlier, Maoist chief Prachanda, who cut short his visit to Dhangadhi and returned to Kathmandu today, said his party is committed to resolving the problems of the business community. 

 The chief of the UN mission in Nepal, Ian Martin, called on Koirala and urged him to intervene and stop the rising Maoist violence. He asked the Prime Minister to conduct a thorough investigation into all such incidents and prosecute the guilty. He also discussed the issue of unregistered Maoist arms.

 Panda crush

 Bangkok, Jan. 17 (Reuters): A male panda at a Thai zoo has been placed on a month-long diet to avoid squashing his partner during sex, and will be shown panda porn to get him in the mood, the project chief said today.

 Chuang Chuang, a six-year-old male who weighs in at 150 kg, was too big for his 115-kg, five-year-old spouse, Lin Hui, Prasertsak Buntrakoonpoontawee said.

 Chuang Chuang is not fat but he will be too heavy for Lin Hui when they mate, he said. The weight difference will be a hurdle to the success of their mating. Prasertsak said male pandas should weigh 30 kg less than their partners. 

 The pair have been at the zoo in the northern city of Chiang Mai since 2003 and were officially married two years ago. However, they have show little inclination to consummate their union.

 Bangla violence escalates

 Dhaka, Jan. 9 (Reuters): Police battled political activists throwing bombs and stones in the capital today, leaving at least 100 injured on the third day of a transport blockade called to scuttle elections.

 The clashes erupted in the Fakirapool area of Dhaka when the activists, defying a blanket ban on marches and rallies, tried to storm police barricades and march to the presidential palace.

 Its a fierce battle going on for couple of hours now, with activists exploding bombs and throwing stones at police firing rubber bullets and teargas, Reuters cameraman Rafiqur Rahman said.

 The fighting then spread to nearby Bangabandhu Avenue where the police tried to storm the headquarters of mainstream political party Awami League but were repelled by bomb-throwing party activists, Rahman and witnesses said.

 Smoke from the home-made bombs and teargas shells covered the area, with people running for cover, one witness said.

 The injured included 20 leaders of different parties, while police said they detained dozens of activists. About 230 people have been injured in clashes during the past three days.

 A multi-party alliance led by the Awami League of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is boycotting the January 22 general elections. 

 The alliance has vowed to block roads leading to the palace of President Iajuddin Ahmed, who heads the caretaker administration.

 Abdul Jalil, general secretary of Awami League, called on alliance leaders and workers to resist the elections and urged voters to boycott polling centres.

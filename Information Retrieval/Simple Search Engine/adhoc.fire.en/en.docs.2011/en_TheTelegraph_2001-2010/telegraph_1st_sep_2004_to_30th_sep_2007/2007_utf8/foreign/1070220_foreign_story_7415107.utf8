 Climate change alarm 

 San Francisco, Feb. 19 (AP): The worlds largest general scientific society yesterday joined the concern over global climate change, calling it a growing threat to society.

 It is the first consensus statement of the board of the American Association for the Advancement of Science on climate change. It comes just weeks after the International Panel on Climate Change issued its most recent report on human-induced warming.

 The evidence is clear: global climate change caused by human activities is occurring now and is a growing threat to society, the AAAS said at its annual meeting.

 Scientists are observing the rapid melting of glaciers, destabilisation of major ice sheets, rising sea levels, shifts in species ranges and increased frequency of weather extremes, said John P. Holdren, director of the Woods Hole Research Center and AAAS president.

 Concern focuses on carbon dioxide and other gases produced by burning fossil fuels and other processes. As these gases accumulate in the atmosphere they trap heat from the sun, much like a greenhouse, warming the climate.

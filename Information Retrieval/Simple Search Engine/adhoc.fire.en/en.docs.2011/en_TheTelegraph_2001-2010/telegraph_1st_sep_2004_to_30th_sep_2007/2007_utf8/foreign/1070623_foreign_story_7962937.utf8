 Ferrari says buying cars not a sin

 Maranello (Italy), June 22 (Reuters): When it comes to luxury sports cars, Ferrari begs to differ with the Pope.

 The Vatican issued a document listing its rules of the road, including one warning against using cars as a means for outshining other people and arousing a feeling of envy.

 Ferraris general manager acknowledged the Vaticans concern that some drivers could use the cars as status symbols, but he said most people bought Ferraris for the love of driving.

 Unless having fun has become a sin, I dont believe it (to be wrong), Amedeo Felisa said this week at an event celebrating Ferraris 60th anniversary in its hometown southeast of Milan. A unit of Italys Fiat, Ferrari makes some of the worlds most exclusive cars, each worth more than 100,000 euros. Felisa was convinced that buying a Ferrari was not a sin.

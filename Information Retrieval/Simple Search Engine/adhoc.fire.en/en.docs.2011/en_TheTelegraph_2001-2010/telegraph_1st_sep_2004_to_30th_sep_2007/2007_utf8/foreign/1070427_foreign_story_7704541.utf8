 London, April 26 (Reuters): Hugh Grant has been arrested and questioned by police after a photographer accused the British actor of attacking him with a tub of baked beans.

 Photographer Ian Whittaker told the Daily Star tabloid that he and Grant, 46, clashed near the home of the Four Weddings and a Funeral star. Whittaker said Grant abused and kicked him on Tuesday before lobbing the beans. The paper printed photos of Grant with a plastic tub of food raised over his head. Grants lawyers Schillings said an incident had taken place and was now under investigation. A police spokeswoman, when asked about the incident, said a 46-year-old man had been arrested yesterday evening.

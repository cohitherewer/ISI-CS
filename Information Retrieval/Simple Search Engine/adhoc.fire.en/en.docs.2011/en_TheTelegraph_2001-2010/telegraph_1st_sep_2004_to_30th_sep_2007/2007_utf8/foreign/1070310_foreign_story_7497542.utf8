The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Palace plot

 J HEMANTH 

 Kathmandu , March 9: The US mission here today expressed deep concern over Maoist chief Prachandas claim of an alleged royalist plot to assassinate American officials in Nepal . 

 In a statement, the US embassy said the security of American citizens in Nepal is the missions highest priority. Therefore, if the Maoist leader has evidence to support his statement, he should immediately share that information with the embassy and with the appropriate police authorities, it said.

 However, the statement added, that if the Maoist chief had no such information, then his remarks were both irresponsible and dangerous. In Pokhara yesterday, Prachanda said pro-palace forces were conspiring to assassinate US officials posted in Nepal and pin the blame on the Maoists.

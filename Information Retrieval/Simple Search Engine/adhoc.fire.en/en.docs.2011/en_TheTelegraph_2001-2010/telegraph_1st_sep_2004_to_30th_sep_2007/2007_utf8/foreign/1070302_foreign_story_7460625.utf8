 Paris in soup over licence

 Reckless

 Los Angeles, March 1 (Reuters): Police seized Paris Hiltons $190,000 Bentley after the heiress was caught driving on a suspended licence, and prosecutors vowed yesterday to ask a judge to revoke her probation for reckless driving.

 Hiltons spokesman, Elliot Mintz, said his client was not aware her driving privileges had been curtailed.

 A court determination that Hilton violated the terms of her probation could result in the 26-year-old reality TV star being fined or even jailed for up to 90 days, a spokesman for the Los Angeles city attorneys office said.

 Hilton was pulled over on Sunset Boulevard in the city of West Hollywood at 11 pm on Tuesday for driving without headlights, and her luxury car was impounded when police discovered her licence had been suspended, a Los Angeles county sheriffs department spokesman said.

 The incident comes about five weeks after Hilton was sentenced to three years probation for pleading no contest the equivalent of a guilty plea to alcohol-related reckless driving stemming from a September arrest in Hollywood.

 Miss Paris Hilton was driving the vehicle. After investigating her licence status it was determined that she was driving on a suspended licence, sheriffs spokesman Oscar Butao said. Miss Hilton was cited for a suspended licence violation and released in the field, he added.

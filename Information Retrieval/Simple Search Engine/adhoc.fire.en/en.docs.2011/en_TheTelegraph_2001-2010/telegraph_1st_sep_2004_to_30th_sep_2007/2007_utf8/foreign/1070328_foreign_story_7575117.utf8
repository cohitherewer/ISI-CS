 Smithsonian head falls to greed

 K.P. NAYAR

 Small: Disgraceful

 Washington, March 27: Another great American icon has fallen to the culture of corruption and impropriety in Washington.

 This time it is the Smithsonian Institution, the worlds largest complex of 18 museums, research facilities and the US capitals prestigious zoo. 

 Smithsonians secretary Lawrence Small has resigned, days after a US Senator criticised his Dom Perignon lifestyle at public expense and the Senate voted to freeze a $17-million increase in the next years budget of the 161 year-old institution. Controversy has been raging at the Smithsonian ever since January, when an internal audit at the institution found large expenses by Small, its top most official, questionable.

 These included $1.15 million for making his house available for official functions since he became Smithsonians head in 2000 and nearly $90,000 in unauthorised expenses from 2000 to 2005. Smithsonian, which is home to such treasures as the Hope Diamond and the first plane used by the Wright brothers in 1903 to launch aviation, is a non-profit organisation and a creation of the US Congress.

 It receives 70 per cent of its funding from the government budget. That figure was $715 million last year. Smithsonian was created with 105 bags of gold sovereigns willed to the US by a wealthy Englishman, James Smithson, the illegitimate son of the Duke of Northumberland.

 Ironically, Smithson, who died in 1829, never visited America and never explained why he willed his vast wealth to a country with which he had no links. But speculation has centred around Smithsons belief that newly-emerging America lacked cultural institutions.

 Smithsonian museums in Washington and New York are free to the public and appeal to children, adults, researchers and scientists. A visit to at least one Smithsonian museum is a must for every tourist to the US capital. In addition to government funding and contributions from the private sector, hundreds of thousands of individuals, impressed by the legacy of the Smithsonian, contribute to the institution regularly.

 That has made its chiefs excesses unacceptable by public standards of decency. 

 Smalls questionable expenses uncovered during the audit included money spent on his wifes trip to Cambodia, a $14,509 round-trip charter flight for Small to San Antonio, Texas, expensive floral gifts, rented tables, chinaware and high-end meals for employees who reported directly to him as well as money for lunches and his wifes membership fee at Washingtons prestigious Cosmos Club.

 Questionable expenses on his 6,500-square foot private home included $273,000 for housekeeping, $2,535 to clean a single chandelier and $12,000 for the upkeep of his swimming pool.

 Smalls annual income from Smithsonian would have been $915,698 this year. It has been criticised for being larger than that of the president of Harvard University, whose endowment is 30 times that of Smithsonians. 

 The Senate wants to cap salaries at the institution at $400,000 a year. Smalls recruitment by Smithsonian represented a fashionable trend in the West in recent years of hiring private sector executives to run non-profit or taxpayer-funded institutions. Small submitted his resignation to John Roberts, US chief justice, who is chancellor of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian.

 Fine Print

 Goofy girl guilty

 New York, Jan.20 (AP): Dethroned Miss Nevada USA Katie Rees says she was devastated when provocative photos of her partying and posing in various stages of undress emerged on the Internet.

 Miss USA officials, including billionaire developer Donald Trump, last month stripped Rees of her tiara and the chance to compete in the national pageant after the photos appeared. When I saw them I was just devastated, the 22-year-old aspiring actress tells the TV show Inside Edition in an interview. I was shocked. Im not proud at all, but what is done is done, and all I can do is move forward.

 We were just out being goofy girls and celebrating, she says. We had a few drinks, which I dont condone, but we were just having a good time. While Miss USA Tara Conner was given a second chance by Trump, Rees says she was treated unfairly. These are things that I didnt do during my reign as Miss Nevada, she claims. These are things that were done three years prior to knowing that I would be a public figure.

 Flurry of bids for old Ford

 Phoenix, Arizona (Reuters): A 1903 Model A, considered to be the oldest surviving Ford, sold for $630,000 on Friday at a collector car auction in Phoenix. Following a flurry of bidding at a Phoenix resort, well-known Houston lawyer John Quinn took home the brick-red, black-upholstered car that was one of the first three sold by newly incorporated Ford Motor Co. Pre-auction estimates had pegged the sale price at between $400,000 and $800,000.

 What Bollywood learnt from Bafta

 London, Feb. 12: Aamir Khan did go up on stage last night at the Bafta awards but, alas, it was to give out a prize, not to receive one for Rang De Basanti as best foreign film. 

 Aamir, who has long given up attending Indian film ceremonies, turned up for the prestigious awards given by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, which are generally recognised as pointing the way to the Oscars. 

 Britains premier night of glamour and glitz was held at the Royal Opera House in Covent Gardens and broadcast by the BBC to 135 territories. 

 This year, Bafta is marking the 60th year of the awards, so it would have been appropriate if India, also marking its 60th year of independence, had won. 

 Rang De Basanti was nominated for Best Film not in the English Language, which was a recognition by Bafta that Bollywood has a big following in Britain. Last year, Bafta even held a Bollywood weekend. 

 The nominations and winners are picked in secret by Baftas 5,000 members in the UK and another 1,500 in the US. Since the vast majority of members and the membership list is now effectively closed are more familiar with the American and European styles of film making, it may be a long while before an Indian film actually goes on to win. 

 Attending with Aamir were Rang De Basantis director, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, and producer, Ronnie Screwvala. 

 All three brought their respective wives, who wore just about the only saris to be seen on a night of British/European/American glamour, represented by the likes of Dame Helen Mirren (named Best Actress for her lead role in The Queen), Kylie Minogue, Kate Winslet, Penelope Cruz, Joely Richardson, Sienna Miller, Eva Green (the French Bond girl who got the Rising Star award from members of the public for playing Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale) and many others. 

 Also present was the Chancellor of Oxford University, Lord (Chris) Patten, whose daughter Alice has a leading role as the film maker Sue in Rang De Basanti. 

 Unfortunately, she is in Los Angeles, casting for a film, said her proud father, who had seen the Bollywood film which he pronounced great. 

 Although Rang De Basanti has done much better business in the UK than almost any other foreign film, the award went to the Spanish Pans Labyrinth, a fanciful and chilling story set against the backdrop of a fascist regime in 1944 rural Spain. 

 The also rans included another highly regarded Spanish film, Volver, directed by Pedro Almodvar. 

 Also shortlisted were Mel Gibsons Apocalypto, a heart stopping mythic action-adventure set against the turbulent end times of the once great Mayan civilisation, and Black Book (Dutch: Zwartboek), a thriller war film. 

 Screwvala was graceful enough to acknowledge that Pans Labyrinth which triumphed in two other categories last night Make-up and Hair and Costume Design was a worthy winner. 

 The Bafta organisers acknowledged Aamirs presence by calling upon him to present The Michael Balcon Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema to Nick Daubeny, a veteran location manager who once succeeded in having the streets of London cleared for one night shot in a Harry Potter film. 

 As he strode up to the stage in his black aachkan and white churidar, the presenter, Jonathan Ross, explained Aamir gets audiences most of us would give our eye teeth for. 

 Last night there was one other tribute to Indian cinema: in the Bafta brochure, the names of cinema greats who had passed away in 2006 included those of the composer Naushad Ali, the actor Raj Kumar, the director Hrishikesh Mukherjee and the actress Nadira. 

 But their names and photographs were not selected for special mention during the actual ceremony. 

 The Bafta awards were sponsored by Orange, the mobile telephone company. No one should be surprised if Vodafone, following its purchase of a stake in Hutchison Essar, seeks similarly to sponsor one of the big Bollywood ceremonies in future. 

 Chopard, the Swiss fine jewellery company, dressed Mirren, who is now a serious contender for an Oscar, in 200,000 worth of shimmering pearls. 

 Chopard, which has similarly lent its finest pieces to Preity Zinta and Aishwarya Rai, is keen to penetrate the Indian market. 

 Quite a few people were disappointed when Daniel Craig, widely admired for his portrayal of the new James Bond in Casino Royale, was overlooked for the best actor prize in favour of the American Forest Whitaker, who plays Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in The Last King of Scotland (his diamond cufflinks, worth 120,000, also came from Chopard). 

 The latter won the Alexander Korda Award for the Outstanding British Film of the Year as well as Best Adapted Screenplay. 

 If there is one thing Bollywood can learn from the Baftas is attention to scriptwriting, generally recognised as a serious weakness in Indian films, especially Hindi ones. 

 When accepting her award, Mirren, who plays the Queen coping with a rebellious British public in the week following Princess Dianas death, said: Write more roles for us like that please. Thank you Peter (Morgan). Keep writing. Mirren, it should be emphasised, is 61.

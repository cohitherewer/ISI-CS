 Harry in lethal drinking game

 London, Sept. 22 (PTI): Booze-loving Prince Harry has been slammed by doctors and anti-alcohol campaigners in Britain for snorting vodka in a lethal drinking game. 

 The prince was captured on video inhaling a bottle cap full of the neat spirit through his nose while on holiday with girlfriend Chelsy Davy, The Sun reported today. Prof. Ian Gilmore, the president of Royal College of Physicians, said snorting alcohol meant it was absorbed directly through the lungs bypassing the liver. 

 This could kill.

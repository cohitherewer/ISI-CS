 Spicier sausage

 Berlin, June 12 (Reuters): Hoping to spice up their summer business, German butchers have introduced a new line of exotic-tasting sausages with flavours ranging from kiwi, maraschino cherry, lemon and even aloe vera.

 The wide variety of new ingredients may seem like heresy to what is for many ordinary Germans the national dish. But for others the new flavours may help negate stagnant demand for the greasy Bratwurst you can find on almost any street corner. Berlin butcher Uwe Buenger has developed a chili-honey Bratwurst while rival Dankert has come up with a kiwi wurst that also includes pineapples and maraschino cherries, Bild newspaper reported today. 

 Die Harder 

 Tokyo (AP): Actor Bruce

 Willis says he is glad to be back doing action

 films but at age 52, he admitted that surviving Die Hard 4.0 was

 no easy task. It was a really hard film to make, he said today at a Tokyo news conference. Willis said he was concerned at the start that taking the story of New York detective John McClane into its fourth film might be difficult. A year ago when we started making this film, the risk factor was very high, he

 said.

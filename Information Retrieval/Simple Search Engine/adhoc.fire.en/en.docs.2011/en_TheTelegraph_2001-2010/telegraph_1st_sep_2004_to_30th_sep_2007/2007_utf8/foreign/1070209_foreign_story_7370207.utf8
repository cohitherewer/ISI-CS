 Muslim fury at Sarkozy

 HENRY SAMUEL 

 Satirical mess

 Paris, Feb. 8: Nicolas Sarkozy, the Centre-Right frontrunner for the French presidency, yesterday earned the ire of Muslim groups when it emerged he backed a satirical magazines publication of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed.

 Lawyers acting for the magazine Charlie Hbdo, which is being sued for defamation by two Muslim groups for reprinting controversial Danish cartoons, read out a letter from Sarkozy, the interior minister, in which he said he preferred too many caricatures to an absence of caricature.

 I am eager to lend my support to your newspaper, which belongs to an old French tradition, that of satire, wrote Sarkozy. Having very often been the main target of Charlie Hbdo, Sarkozy added that he backed it in the name of the freedom to laugh at anything. 

 His statement provoked the wrath of the official French Council for the Muslim Religion, CFCM, an Islamic umbrella group that Sarkozy helped create four years ago.

 Furious at what it saw as government interference, a CFCM spokesman said the comments were unacceptable and that its heads were considering resigning en masse in protest.

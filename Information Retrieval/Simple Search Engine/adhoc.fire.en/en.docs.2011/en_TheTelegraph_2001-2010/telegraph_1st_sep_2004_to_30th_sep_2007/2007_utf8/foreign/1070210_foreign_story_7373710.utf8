 Jinnah row

 Jinnah: Not Islamic enough

 Islamabad, Feb. 9 (PTI): Sparking a controversy, a major Islamist party has refused to recognise Muhammad Ali Jinnahs contribution to the creation of Pakistan and dropped his name from a list of leaders it will honour at special conventions for freedom fighters.

 The Jamaati Ulema Islami (JUI) of Maulana Fazlur Rehman, the Opposition leader in the National Assembly, has said Jinnah officially recognised as Quaid-e-Azam or Father of the Nation had done nothing worth remembering.

 Jinnah and his companions had not done anything for Islam and will not be honoured by the part at conventions to honour real freedom fighters, the partys information secretary Maulana Amjad Khan was quoted as saying in Lahore by the Daily Times today.

 MQM plea against Imran

 Islamabad, July 26 (PTI) The Pakistan election commission is looking into a plea filed by the Mohajir Quami Movement (MQM) party seeking the disqualification of Imran Khan from parliament on charges that he indulged in immoral activities.

 A three-member bench, headed by chief election commissioner Justice Qazi Muhammad, today formally took up the petition. It accuses Imran of having an immoral relationship with an American woman and cited a US court judgment which said that he fathered a child born to her out of wedlock.

 Chinese workers killed

 Peshawar, July 8 (Reuters): Unidentified gunmen today killed three Chinese workers and wounded another in what Pakistani officials said was a terrorist attack apparently linked to the bloody siege at the mosque in Islamabad.

 The four Chinese, who worked for a motorcycle company making three-wheeled auto-rickshaws, were ambushed as they were leaving their factory on the outskirts of the northwestern city of Peshawar, a provincial government official said.

 Its being investigated from different angles, but apparently it looks as if its linked to Lal Masjid, Peshawar police chief Abdul Majeed Marwat said.

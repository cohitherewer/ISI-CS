 Newman retires from acting

 Cool Hand Luke 

 Los Angeles, May 26 (Reuters): Paul Newmans career has included winning an Oscar, establishing a food company to fund charities, and operating a restaurant, but he said this week he is retiring from acting.

 Im not able to work anymore as an actor at the level that I would want to, the 82-year-old Hollywood star told ABC News in an interview released on its website yesterday. You start to lose you memory, you start to lose your confidence, you start to lose your invention. So I think thats pretty much a closed book for me, he said.

 Newman brought a memorable series of rough, charming and roguish characters to the screen like the alcoholic Brick in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, the quirky Cool Hand Luke, the suave con man in The Sting and the dissolute title character of Hud. He earned nine Oscar acting nominations but his only win was for best actor in The Color of Money.

 Paris countdown

 Los Angeles, June 1 (AP): Paris Hiltons mandatory makeover _ from designer duds to jail-issued jumpsuits is fast approaching. 

 The 26-year-old heiress has until 11.59 pm on June 5 to report to the Century Regional Detention Facility to start serving time for violating her probation in an alcohol-related reckless driving case.

 A judge sentenced Hilton to 45 days behind bars, but Los Angeles police spokesman Steve Whitmore said: She will do about 23 days, regardless of when she reports. She may choose to report early, or at an odd hour, to try to avoid media attention. Its the state law, he said, explaining the good time/work time requirement in which you get days off for every day that you serve.

 He said there is no chance Hilton will be released early due to overcrowding, as actress Michelle Rodriguez was in May 2006, when she served less than one day of a 60-day sentence at the same county jail. The situation in the jail will not determine (Hiltons) release, Whitmore said.

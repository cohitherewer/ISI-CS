 Algiers beefs up security

 Algiers, April 14 (Reuters): Police increased security in Algiers after the US embassy issued a warning saying attackers may be planning to strike the Algerian capital today, three days after twin blasts killed 33 people there.

 The US warning was issued just hours before two suicide bomb attacks on US diplomatic offices today in Casablanca. 

 In a warden notice issued to US expatriates in the early hours today, the embassy in Algeria said: According to unconfirmed information, there may be attacks planned for April 14, 2007 in areas that may include the Algiers Central Post Office located in Rue Emir El Khettabi, and Algerian State Television Headquarters, located on Boulevard des Martyrs, among others.

 Fireworks as Castro turns 81

 Havana, Aug. 13 (AP): Fireworks exploded over Havana Bay and five Cuban agents imprisoned in the US sent greetings as ailing leader Fidel Castro turned 81 today, spending his second consecutive birthday convalescing at an unknown location.

 Today we celebrate one more anniversary of the birthday of our Comandante en Jefe Fidel Castro, who turned 81 and who will continue celebrating many more birthdays with Cuba and the world, Havana resident Rosa Maria Suarez said in the early hours of today as she and hundreds of others stood on the Malecon sea front just after midnight to watch the fireworks marking Castros birthday.

 Hes celebrating with his family at home, but its as if he were with us here, said student Irane Neskaye, also watching the colourful pyrotechnics show popping over the bay with the skyline of Havanas Cabana Fortress.

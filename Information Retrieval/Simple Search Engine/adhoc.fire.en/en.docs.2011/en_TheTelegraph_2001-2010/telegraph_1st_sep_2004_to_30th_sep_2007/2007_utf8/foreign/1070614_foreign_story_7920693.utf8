 Spielberg to back Hillary

 Taking sides

 Los Angeles, June 13 (Reuters): Oscar-winning director Steven Spielberg, an influential member of the Hollywood elite, today endorsed New York Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Democratic nomination for President in 2008.

 Ive taken the time to familiarise myself with the impressive field of Democratic candidates and am convinced that Hillary Clinton is the most qualified candidate to lead us from her first day in the White House, Spielberg said.

 Spielberg, a founding partner of DreamWorks Studio and the director of such films as Jurassic Park and Schindlers List, had waited several months to decide which candidate to endorse as Democratic hopefuls jousted for Hollywoods backing.

 His decision reflects Clintons growing support among show business heavyweights following a period in which many donors hedged their bets by giving money to several candidates. My sense is that there continues to be three very strong talented Democratic front-runners, said Andy Spahn, Spielbergs political adviser.

 He said the current presidential election run-up was unique in that many of the wealthier, high-profile makers and shakers in Hollywood have been unwilling to back any one candidate. Billionaire mogul David Geffen, a DreamWorks co-founder, proved an early exception when he came out strongly in support of Obama.

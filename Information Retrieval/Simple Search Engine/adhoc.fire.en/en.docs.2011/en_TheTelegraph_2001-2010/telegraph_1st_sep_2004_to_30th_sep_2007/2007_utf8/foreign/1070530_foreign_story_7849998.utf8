 Bangla arrests

 Dhaka, May 29 (Reuters): Army-led forces in Bangladesh detained more political and business leaders early today as part of a crackdown on corruption ahead of long-delayed elections, officials said.

 They included retired air vice-marshal Altaf Hossain Chowdhury, a former home minister in the government of former Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia, and Sheikh Selim, a relative of Khaledas rival, former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, and once a minister in her government.

 Also detained in the latest hunt was Abdul Awal Mintoo, a leading businessman and former president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Altaf Hossain and two other former ministers were sent to jail today.

 Yesterday, security forces detained three key politicians, including Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil and Khaledas former home minister, Lutfuzzaman Babar.

 Officials of the Awami League and Khaledas Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said about half a dozen other politicians, including two city mayors, were picked up today.

 The charges against them were not immediately known.

 An imprisoned businessman told a Bangladesh court today that he was secretly detained for two months by security forces.

 Giasuddin Al Mamun, owner of private Channel 1 television, said forces had threatened to kill him if he did not confess to extortion charges brought against him.

 UK court blow to Indian doctors

 London, Feb. 9 (PTI): An estimated 15,000 Indian doctors and medical students in Britain will be forced to leave the country with their careers in tatters after a high court here today refused to quash an immigration law that makes a work permit mandatory for non-EU doctors.

 The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO) tried in vain to overturn the immigration law with the help of a judicial review petition, but they lost the seven-month-old case. The association had sought the quashing of the law as it discriminated against non-European doctors.

 However, the court also ruled that the secretary of state for home had failed to carry out a race equality impact assessment before making changes to the immigration rules. A race impact assessment is considered mandatory by Britains stringent race laws.

 The court also observed that there was no obligation on the government departments to consult the BAPIO before making changes to the immigration rules.

 BAPIO president Ramesh Mehta said: We believe we have a strong case and we are positively thinking of appealing against the high court verdict. 

 The verdict has provided no relief to thousands of international medical graduates whose careers are being destroyed by the new immigration regulations which came into force on April 3, 2006, Mehta said.

 Playstation shooting in US college claims one

 Fresno, California, May 8 (AP): Police searched neighbourhoods near a university campus in California today for a student suspected of opening fire in an apartment during a dispute over a video game console, killing one person and wounding two.

 Police initially believed the suspect was still in the apartment complex, but they expanded the search after determining he had slipped away. The complex is across a street from the California State University stadium in Fresno, but the university remained open.

 This is not another Virginia Tech, police spokesman Jeff Cardinale said . This is simply a dispute between one person and a group of individuals.

 The suspect began shooting during a confrontation with four men over a Playstation game console late on Monday, Cardinale said.

 Cardinale identified the suspect as Jonquel Brooks, 19, who was majoring in criminology.

 Brooks parents were helping authorities, who were communicating with Brooks by cellphone to negotiating a surrender, said police chief Jerry Dyer.

 The suspect originally made arrangements to surrender at police headquarters at 9 am but failed to appear. Brooks had told police he was trying to get an attorney and would turn himself in after he secured one, Dyer said.

 The Fresno county coroners office identified the deceased victim as a Brant Daniels, 19, who had moved from the Los Angeles area to attend Fresno State but was not a current student. The three men who were shot were all acquaintances of Brooks who lived in the same apartment complex, the police said. 

 A man with a bloody bandage on his left shoulder who described himself as one of the victims told AP the dispute started when he and the other victims accused the gunman of stealing a Playstation video game console and game.

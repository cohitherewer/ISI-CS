The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 At the altar after accident 

 Montreal, Aug. 27 (AFP): A Canadian-Indian couple were married yesterday in British Columbia in a ceremony marred by the death of six guests who were killed when a truck plowed through a pre-wedding procession two days ago. 

 The couples relatives, from Canada, the US and Britain, had gathered in Abbotsford to take part in several days of traditional celebrations for the Sikh wedding. 

 During festivities on Friday evening, a truck charged through a group of about 30 people, who were mostly relatives of the bride. Six persons were killed and 17 injured.

 We were just a little bit far away from the house and the man just gets the car and just zooms in top speed and crashes everybody, nine-year-old Yuvraj Boparai told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. His 12-year-old cousin was killed in the accident.

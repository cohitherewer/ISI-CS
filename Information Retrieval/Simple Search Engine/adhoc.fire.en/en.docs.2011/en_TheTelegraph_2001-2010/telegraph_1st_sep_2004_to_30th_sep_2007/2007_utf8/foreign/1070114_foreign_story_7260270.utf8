 Meat with body fat

 Santiago, Jan. 13 (AFP): Bon Appetit, said Chilean artist Marco Evaristti as he presented his friends with his newest creation: meatballs cooked with fat from his own body, extracted by liposuction.

 Ladies and gentleman, bon appetit and may god bless, said Evaristti, a glass in his hand, to his dining companions seated on Thursday night around a table in Santiagos animal gallery. On the plates in front of them was a serving of Agnolotti pasta and in the middle a meatball made with oil Evaristti removed from his body in a liposuction procedure last year. The question of whether or not to eat human flesh is more important than the result, he said, explaining the point of his creation. 

 Evaristti produced 48 meatballs with his own fat, some of which would be canned and sold for $4,000 for 10.

 Paula video

 New York (Reuters): American Idol judge Paula Abdul cancelled interviews on Friday as an online video emerged of the television star slurring and gesticulating her way through an interview a day earlier. Some viewers of the footage posted on the popular online video site www.youtube.com said it appeared she had been drinking. But Abduls spokesman, Jeff Ballard, denied that was under the influence of alcohol or on some kind of medication. 

 Gibson for cool Mayan

 Los Angeles (AP): Mel Gibson will travel to Mexico next week for the Mexican premiere of his new movie Apocalypto, about ancient Mayans, and will attend the Mexican premiere of the film, his publicist said. Apocalypto tells the story of the Mayan people who built a civilisation in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras and is in a Mayan language. Gibson employed Mayans for the film and has said he wants to make the Mayan language cool again and encourage young people to speak it with pride.

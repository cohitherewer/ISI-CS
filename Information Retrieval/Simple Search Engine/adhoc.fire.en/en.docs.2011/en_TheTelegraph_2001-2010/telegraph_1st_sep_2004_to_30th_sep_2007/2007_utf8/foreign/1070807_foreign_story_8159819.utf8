 Boozy Britain in health scare

 Dangerous pints

 London, Aug. 6 (AP): Last call at any British pub can be like a contact sport, with a crush of drunken customers suddenly heaving toward the bar in quest of one last round.

 Its a hallowed tradition, and doctors say an increasingly dangerous one.

 Britains propensity toward binge drinking, driven by a pub culture in which a good night out means packing in as many pints as possible before the traditional 11 pm closing time, could lead to a liver disease epidemic within two decades unless Britons learn to drink more responsibly, experts warn.

 Theres been a frightening increase in alcoholic liver disease in recent years, said Dr Ian Gilmore, president of the Royal College of Physicians.

 According to government statistics, deaths from cirrhosis in Britain have risen dramatically in the past two decades, while they have fallen steadily elsewhere in Europe.

 In England and Wales, 17.5 deaths of every 100,000 men were due to cirrhosis in 2002, up from 8.3 in 1987. And in Scotland, the increase was even more dramatic: cirrhosis deaths among men went from 16.9 per every 100,000 in 1987 to 45.2 per 100,000 in 2002.

 Deaths from cirrhosis (in Britain) are increasing out of proportion with anywhere else in the world, said Dr Rajiv Jalan, a consultant hepatologist at Londons University College Hospital.

 We need to understand what drives our particular drinking culture, said Gilmore. 

 Here, it tends to be more binge drinking, which can be very dangerous.

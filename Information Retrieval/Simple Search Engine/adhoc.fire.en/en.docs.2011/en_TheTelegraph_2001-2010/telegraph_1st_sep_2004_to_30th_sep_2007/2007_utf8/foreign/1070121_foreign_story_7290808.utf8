 Refugees run into Lanka screen

 Mankerni (Sri Lanka), Jan. 20 (AP): Soldiers are screening the thousands of Tamil refugees fleeing heavy fighting in the volatile east and have detained at least 11 suspected separatist Tamil Tigers, an official said.

 Army troops, meanwhile, captured a major rebel base and several other small camps in Kathiraveli, a rebel stronghold in eastern Batticaloa district, said military spokesman Brigadier Prasad Samarasinghe. They (rebels) have fled the area as our troops are advancing, said Samarasinghe, adding that the military is continuing to capture rebel-held areas from where insurgents are firing artillery at army troops.

 There was no immediate comment from the rebels, as phone calls went unanswered.

 Tamil parents claimed their innocent children were unfairly detained by soldiers and a pro-government militia yesterday as they fled to a government-held village after government troops routed rebels from Vaharai, about 11 km away from Kathiraveli, an impoverished coastal stretch in Batticaloa.

 Vaharai has been the scene of heavy fighting between government troops and Tamil Tiger separatist rebels over the last few weeks.

 T. Tharmarasa said his son was abducted and forced to undergo arms training by the rebels some time ago but escaped after a week. Since then we have hid him and protected him from them (Tigers), but now he has been taken away by the other side, he said in a refugee camp in Mankerni.

 Is it for this we took this trouble and came on such a long journey? It would have been better for everybody if we had died in the fighting, said a sobbing Tharmarasa.

 A military official in Mankerni said 11 suspected rebels were detained, and 10 of them admitted their involvement with the Tigers. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity citing military policy, said the arrests were made according to proper procedure.

 Hundreds of Tamils have disappeared, apparently abducted by pro-government forces, since last year. The government has denied involvement in any abductions. Samarasinghe said the army would continue to flush out rebels in the rest of the east, where both sides hold pockets of territory.

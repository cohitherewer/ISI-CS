 Smart girlfriend angered by vicious public attacks

 Shaha Riza: Bristling

 Washington, May 18 (AP): Mystery surrounds Shaha Rizas personal life, by her design, yet two things are beyond doubt. She is smart, exceptionally so. And angry.

 Very angry, Paul Wolfowitz said of her recently. Wolfowitz lost his job as World Bank president yesterday over an ethical entanglement arising from his yearslong relationship with the former bank employee.

 Riza, an Oxford-educated Arab Muslim feminist in her early 50s, has worked for years for democratic change in West Asia and for sexual equality both in repressive societies and within the bank. She has done so most of the time without drawing enormous attention to herself.

 I simply do not know how to blow my own trumpet, she says.

 Yet, in statements to World Bank officials, she came out fighting against the vicious public attacks on me that flowed from her relationship with hardline conservative Wolfowitz, a bond that has been as notable for its quiet unfolding in gossipy Washington as for its longevity.

 Riza began working for the bank eight years before Wolfowitz took over as president in June 2005. She was moved to the state department that autumn to avoid a conflict of interest but stayed on the banks payroll. The banks ethics panel concluded that she subsequently received salary increases at Wolfowitzs direction that were higher than allowed under bank rules.

 Riza bristled at being forced to leave the bank in 2005, arguing that as senior communications officer for West Asia and North Africa office, she did not report to Wolfowitz in any capacity and no bank regulations prohibited her continued employment. 

 I felt under attack by a powerful group that had no right to make assumptions, she said to a special panel investigating Wolfowitz.

 And she noted the irony of my working to ensure womens participation and rights through the work of the World Bank and to be then stripped of my own rights by this same institution. Wolfowitz went so far as to suggest that the banks ethics committee members put the onus on him to arrange her outside employment because they were afraid to cross her.

 They did not want to deal with a very angry Riza, he wrote in a biting assessment of the panels actions. It would only be human nature for them to want to steer clear of her.

 Wolfowitz hinted, too, that she was none too happy with him. 

 He quoted her as telling the panel that he should have stood up for her rather than accepted an arrangement that moved her out of her job.

 He became them you the bank, she told the panel, and I had to fend for myself in the same way Im now fending for myself.

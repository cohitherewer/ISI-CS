 Cars will be safer, minus the driver

 NIC FLEMING

 London, Feb. 19: Driverless cars that can predict the actions of other vehicles and negotiate busy city centre traffic will be commonplace by 2030. 

 US researchers believe cars equipped with the latest positioning technology and advanced artificial intelligence will be safer than those driven by humans within 25 years. 

 At the annual American Association for the Advancement of Science conference designers unveiled Junior, a modified blue VW Passat that will enter a 1-million contest later this year to navigate its way autonomously through a simulated urban environment including other robot vehicles and traffic laws. 

 The prototype was created by the same team from Stanford University, California, that in 2005 won a prize of the same size for Stanley, a vehicle that used sensors, lasers, cameras and on-board computers to navigate a 132-mile course through the Nevada desert. 

 Professor Sebastian Thrun, one of the cars designers, said: Today we can drive about 100 miles before human assistance is necessary. 

 By 2010 I expect this to go up to 1,000 miles, and by 2020 a million miles. By 2030 we should be able to deploy this technology on the open highway, and reliability will exceed that of humans by orders of magnitude.

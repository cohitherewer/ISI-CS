 Britney as works of art

 Los Angeles, Sept. 29 (Reuters): Fallen pop princess Britney Spears has been called many things this year as she has bounced in and out of rehab, attacked paparazzi with an umbrella and shaken her stuff on MTVs Video Music Awards.

 No doubt, Spears has been a real piece of work. Now, she is more than 50 pieces of art at a Hollywood gallery.

 Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbatos makers of the documentary The Eyes of Tammy Faye about former televangelist Tammy Faye Bakker Messner as well as other films exploring fame gathered paintings, sculpture and other work for Just Britney, which opened at their gallery yesterday.

 We reached out to a number of artists and found Britney is such a polarising character these days, said Steven Corfe, a co-curator of the show with Thairin Smothers.

 People absolutely adored her and wanted to celebrate her bubblegum, pop princess years. Or, they thought she was an irresponsible mother or wanted to play up the drug side of things, Corfe added. The show reflects that whole spectrum.

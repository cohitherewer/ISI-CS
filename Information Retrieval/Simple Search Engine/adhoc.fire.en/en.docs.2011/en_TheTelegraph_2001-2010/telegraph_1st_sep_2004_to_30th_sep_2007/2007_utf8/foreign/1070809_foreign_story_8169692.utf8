 Charlie not amused by Denise offer

 New York, Aug. 8 (AP): Charlie Sheen claims former wife Denise Richards wants him to father a third child.

 There was a request for a donation, Sheen tells syndicated TV show Entertainment Tonight in an interview. Without getting into it here ... there is a specific document relating to this that I am going to reserve for a court.

 When asked if he would ever consider such a possibility, the 41-year-old actor says: I would sooner, in exactly what Im wearing, walk on the surface of the moon. Does that answer it?

 A spokeswoman for Richards, 36, was not immediately available for comment.

 Sheen and Richards divorced last year. They have two daughters, 3-year-old Sam and 2-year-old Lola.

 Sheen, who is nominated for an Emmy Award for his role in the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men, is engaged to real estate investor Brooke Mueller, 29.

 Coined million

 Ottawa, May 6 (AP): Got change for a million? Canada does: the worlds biggest pure gold coin at 100 kg.

 Already, three buyers have shelled out for one of the 1 million Canadian dollar coins introduced last week.

 The Royal Canadian mint made the coins 50 cm in diameter and 3 cm thick mostly to seize the bragging rights from Austria, which had the record with a 31.75-kg, 38-cm wide 100,000-euro coin.

 Listed as 99.999 per cent pure gold bullion, the coin features Queen Elizabeth II on one side and Canadas national symbol the maple leaf on the other. It has a face value of 1 million Canadian dollars ($903,628), but sells for approximately $2.7 million depending on the market value of gold.

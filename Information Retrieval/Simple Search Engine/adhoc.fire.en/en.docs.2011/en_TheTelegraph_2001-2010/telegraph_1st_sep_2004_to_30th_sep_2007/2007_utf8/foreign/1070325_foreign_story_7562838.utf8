 Fashion to take stock of crisis

 AMY IGGULDEN

 London, March 24: Catwalk models will be scrutinised by an independent inquiry investigating the size zero crisis facing the British fashion industry, it was announced yesterday.

 The inquiry by the British Fashion Council will examine whether working pressures are damaging models health.

 It comes amid increasing concerns that models and other young women are risking their health by trying to attain an American size-zero figure, which is a British size four. Or a 31.5-inch bust, a 23-inch waist and 34-inch hips.

 The story started to make headlines because of a fashion for extreme dieting among some American actresses. 

 It turned into a global outcry when three models died from complications arising from eating disorders.

 However, as size-zero models were banned at Madrid fashion shows, and a new code of conduct was introduced in Milan, the British Fashion Council, which owns and runs London Fashion Week, refused to ban ultra-thin models at the week-long event in February.

 This new initiative, the Model Health Inquiry, is the councils official response, and is backed by the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, who has long been a critic of the tyranny of thinness. She said: The fashion industry has a responsibility to look after its models.

 Hilary Riva, the councils chief executive, said the panel would ensure that the industry behaved responsibly.

 We need to take a clear and sensible look at this, she said. One thing we have learned from experts is that you cannot always tell from looking. We want effective and enforceable recommendations. Asked about her decision not to ban ultra-thin models in February, Riva said: I still dont think we should have banned size zero models based on calls from a very limited proportion of people.

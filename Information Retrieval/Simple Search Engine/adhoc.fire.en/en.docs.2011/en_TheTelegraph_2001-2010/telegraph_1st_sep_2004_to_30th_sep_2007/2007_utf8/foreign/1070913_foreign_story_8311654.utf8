 Putin dismisses PM, springs surprise

 Moscow, Sept. 12 (Reuters): President Vladimir Putin today named the little-known head of a financial market watchdog as his Prime Minister in a surprise move that kept Russians guessing over who would succeed him in the Kremlin.

 Earlier, Putin accepted Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkovs resignation and then left Moscow for a planned trip to the Volga region without publicly disclosing a replacement.

 It was left to the speaker of the State Duma (parliament), Boris Gryzlov, to announce that Putin had nominated Viktor Zubkov, the 65-year-old head of the Federal Financial Monitoring Service as new Prime Minister.

 The agencys main duty is to fight money laundering and Zubkov worked with Putin in the St Petersburg mayors office during the 1990s.

 The move confounded analysts predictions that Putin would elevate one of the most widely fancied candidates to succeed him to the Prime Ministers post as a stepping stone to the top Kremlin job.

 That was the sequence of events under former President Boris Yeltsin, who made Putin Prime Minister in 1999 before naming him acting President months later.

 Vyacheslav Nikonov, who heads the Politika Foundation think-tank, said Putins decisions on appointments had seldom been guessed correctly and predicted that the Yeltsin scenario was unlikely to repeat itself this time.

 I do not exclude that another politician can become the successor, including all those named (as possibles) in the last few months, he said. I do not believe Zubkovs nomination means it is he who will succeed Putin.

 Conventional wisdom in Moscow had been that Sergei Ivanov, a close Putin ally and one of two first deputy Prime Ministers, would be named Premier as a step towards becoming the Kremlins favoured presidential candidate next year.

 Putin, however, has sprung surprises before and Zubkov has never been mentioned as a possible presidential candidate.

 Some analysts said Putin simply named him to keep voters guessing about his successor and avoid the risk of becoming a lame duck before he leaves power in May 2008.

 Sarkozy has Royal edge

 Paris, May 3 (Reuters): French conservative Nicolas Sarkozy is clear favourite to win Sundays presidential election after he outshone his Socialist rival Segolene Royal in a televised debate, an opinion poll showed today.

 An Opinionway poll for the daily Le Figaro indicated 53 per cent of viewers judged Sarkozy more convincing in yesterdays debate against 31 per cent for Royal.

 In a sometimes fiery exchange, Royal was surprisingly pugnacious in taking on a generally restrained Sarkozy but neither candidate delivered any of the kind of lethal oneliners or decisive gaffes likely to go down in political history.

 Each camp will celebrate its champion and deride the adversary, said the daily Le Parisien. The influential daily Le Monde said the quality of the debate was disappointing and gave little sense of the way forward for France.

 But it gave a cautious endorsement of Royal, saying victory would give her the authority to renew the Left in France. Its a gamble. For the country, its worth trying, Le Mondes editor Jean-Marie Colombani wrote.

 Sarkozy, who has led in more than 100 opinion polls since the start of the year, said he did not believe the debate would change the pattern of the campaign.I dont think everything is decided by a debate.

 An opinion poll published late yesterday put Sarkozys support at 53.5 per cent against 46.5 for Royal, with 86 per cent saying they will not change their minds before the May 6 vote.

 But Royal denied the race was as good as over. Opinion polls dont decide elections, she told France Inter radio.

 Mourners chase away minister

 Karachi, Sept. 16 (PTI): Thousands of mourners today chased away Pakistans interior minister and senior government officials from the funeral of a leading pro-Taliban cleric in Peshawar, capital of the troubled North West Frontier Province.

 Asif Iqbal, the provincial information minister, said some 100,000 people attended the funeral prayers for the 69-year-old Maulana Hassan Jan, who was shot dead in Peshawar by unidentified gunmen last evening.

 Eyewitnesses said the mourners, mostly made up of students at religious seminaries, chanted get out when interior minister Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao tried to enter a stadium where the prayers were being held.

 Provincial chief minister Akram Durrani was also told to go away when he arrived at the venue. 

 The students also chanted slogans against President Pervez Musharraf and US President George W. Bush. 

 Iqbal said there were reports of students damaging some property at the stadium.

 The cleric, known for his opposition to suicide attacks, was among the group of clerics who had gone to Afghanistan in 2001 to convince the Taliban leadership to hand over Osama bin Laden.

 Security officials have termed the clerics killing an act of terrorism.

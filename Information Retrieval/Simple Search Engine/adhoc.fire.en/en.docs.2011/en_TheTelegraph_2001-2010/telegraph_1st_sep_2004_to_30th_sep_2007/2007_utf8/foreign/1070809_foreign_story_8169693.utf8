 Dutch leader for Quran ban

 Fascist view

 Amsterdam, Aug. 8 (Reuters): Dutch anti-immigration politician Geert Wilders has called for a ban on the Quran in the Netherlands.

 The leader called it a fascist book in the vein of Adolf Hitlers Mein Kampf which legitimises violence.

 Writing in the Dutch daily De Volkskrant yesterday Wilders said: Ban this wretched book just like Mein Kampf is banned. Send a signal ... to Islamists that the Quran can never, ever be used in our country as an excuse or inspiration for violence.

 Hitlers Mein Kampf, published in 1925, outlines the future Nazi dictators racist ideology. It has been banned from sale in the Netherlands since the end of World War II.

 Ayhan Tonca, chairman of the CMO umbrella group of Dutch Muslim organisations said Wilderss comments were best ignored.

 This is typical Wilders. This is a ridiculous idea, he said. There is not much news at the moment so he is trying to create some.

 Wilders, whose new party won nine seats out of the 150 in parliament in last Novembers elections, is well known for his firebrand remarks on Islam.

 He has warned of a tsunami of Islamisation in a country home to 1 million Muslims, and has lived under heavy protection since receiving death threats from Islamist militants in 2004.

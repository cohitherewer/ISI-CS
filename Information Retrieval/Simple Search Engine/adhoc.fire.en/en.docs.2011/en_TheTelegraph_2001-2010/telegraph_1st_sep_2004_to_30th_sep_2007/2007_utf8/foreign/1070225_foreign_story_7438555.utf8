 Baby hatch

 Tokyo, Feb. 24 (Reuters): A Japanese hospitals plan to open a baby hatch where people can anonymously drop off infants they feel unable to care for has been criticised by the Prime Minister.

 Jikei Hospital in the southwestern city of Kumamoto plans to place an incubator-like hatch with access from the outside of the building to allow babies to be dropped off safely. An alarm will alert hospital staff when a baby is placed there.

 The plan has been cleared by the health ministry after it found there were no legal obstacles. I feel very resistant to the idea of creating a system where people can abandon a child anonymously, the Sankei Shimbun daily quoted Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as telling reporters yesterday.

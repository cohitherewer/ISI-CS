 Iraq PM snubbed in Iran skies

 Baghdad, April 8 (Reuters): Iran refused to allow a plane carrying Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on a trip to Asia to cross its air space overnight, a senior adviser to the Iraqi leader said today.

 Sadiq al-Rikabi, who is accompanying Maliki on the trip to Japan and South Korea, said the Prime Ministers plane entered Iranian air space at about 8.30 pm on Saturday.

 Suddenly the Iranian aviation authorities ordered the pilot to go back, Rikabi said.

 We were obliged to fly to Dubai where we stayed for more than three hours to file a new (flight) plan, he said. Rikabi said it was unclear why Iran had barred Malikis plane from crossing its territory.

 Asked about the reports, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini implied Malikis plane may have faced an issue over permission to fly across Iran but said it was not an unusual problem.

 Permission for Malikis flight is a normal issue. All flights need permission, he told a weekly news conference in Tehran, without giving further details.

 Iraqs US-backed government has often had to tread a delicate path in trying to maintain good relations with both Iran, its neighbour to the east, and the US.

 Maliki, a Shia, visited Tehran last September to urge Iran not to interfere in Iraq. President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, made an official trip to Tehran in November.

 Washington accuses Shia Iran of stoking violence in Iraq and in January detained five men it says were linked to Irans Revolutionary Guards and backing militants. Iran insists they are diplomats, wants them freed and has requested access.

 17 die in car blast

 In Mahmudiya, a car bomb killed up to 17 people and wounded two dozen in this town south of Baghdad today, the latest in a spate of attacks outside the Iraqi capital since a new security plan there took effect.

 Mahmudiya mayor Muaid al-Amiri said the car bomb targeted industrial workshops and had killed 17 people and completely demolished a three-storey building.

 Pak plea to apex court on judge hearing

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 Islamabad, May 3: The Pakistan government has urged the supreme court to constitute a full bench during Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhrys petition challenging his March 9 suspension by President Pervez Musharraf. 

 The request comes before the May 7 hearing of the petition. 

 The government in its application said Justice M. Javed Buttar, who is to head the larger bench, is junior in rank to five senior judges.

 Therefore, exclusion of the five senior judges Khalilur Rehman Ramday, Mohammad Nawaz Abbasi, Faqir Mohammad Khokhar, Falak Sher and Mian Shakirullah Jan from the bench is inexplicable, the application said.

 Jurists say this is in sharp contrast to the governments position on April 27 when it opposed constituting a full bench to hear Chaudhrys petition. 

 However, acting chief justice Rana Bhagwandas, who received the application last evening, has not yet announced his ruling on the request. 

 Chaudhry raised 132 legal points of great public importance in his petition challenging the competence and constitution of the Supreme Judicial Council and whether a reference can, at all, be filed against a chief justice.

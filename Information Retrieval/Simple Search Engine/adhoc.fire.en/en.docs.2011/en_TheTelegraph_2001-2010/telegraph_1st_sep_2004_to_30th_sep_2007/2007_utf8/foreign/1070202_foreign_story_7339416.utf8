 US opposes anti-Pak bill

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 Islamabad, Feb. 1: The US administration is opposed to several provisions of a bill, recently approved by the House of Representatives, that would stop military aid to Pakistan if it failed to halt Talibans resurgence in its country. 

 The US administration opposes provisions in the bill that will restrict assistance to Pakistan , said a statement issued by the American embassy in Islamabad . 

 Under the new legislation, President George W. Bush will be required to certify to Congress that Pakistan is making all possible efforts to combat the Taliban in areas including Quetta and Chaman in southwestern Baluchistan.

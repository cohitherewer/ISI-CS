 Rod weds Penny

 Santa Margherita Ligure (Italy), June 16 (Reuters): British rock star Rod Stewart married Penny Lancaster today in a low-key ceremony on Italys Ligurian coast.

 Stewart, 62, and Lancaster, 36, have been together since the break-up of Stewarts second marriage in 1998 and tied the knot in a civil ceremony in a villa with only Lancasters parents as witnesses.

 It was just a family thing, one of Stewarts bodyguards said.

 Model Lancaster was dressed in a short, white satin dress and white high-heeled shoes. She arrived at the ceremony some 20 minutes before the groom, who donned blue pin-striped trousers and a white jacket.

 After the wedding the couple walked from the villa to a nearby restaurant to see their 19-month-old son, Alastair.

 From there they strolled on to the harbour where they posed for photographs in a small boat before sailing to Stewarts luxury yachtThe Lady Ann Magee.

 The 50-metre (164-foot) yacht is listed on the internet for rent at 170,000 euros ($226,000) a week.

 The couple let their hair down at a pre-wedding family party on Friday evening, emerging from an exclusive hotel singing pub songs.

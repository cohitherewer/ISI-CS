 US strays from Israel line on Palestine

 Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas

 Jerusalem, March 18 (Reuters): The US said today its ban on direct aid to the Palestinian government would remain in place but it broke ranks with Israel by authorising contacts with some members of the new unity administration.

 The US consulate in Jerusalem said Washington would continue to shun Hamas ministers in the power-sharing cabinet but permit contacts with non-Hamas members on a case-by-case basis depending on developments.

 The decision to allow some contacts marked a shift in US policy and a break with Israel, which has vowed to boycott the new government in its entirety, including non-Hamas ministers.

 Earlier today, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ruled out resuming talks on Palestinian statehood with President Mahmoud Abbas and urged the international community to shun the government established on Saturday.

 Olmerts cabinet approved his policy, officials said.

 Palestinians hope the partnership between Abbass secular Fatah faction and Islamist Hamas will stop factional fighting and ease a crippling aid embargo that has increased poverty.

 But Micaela Schweitzer-Bluhm, spokeswoman for the US consulate in Jerusalem, said the year-old US ban on direct aid to the Palestinian government would remain in place until it recognised Israel and renounced violence as demanded by the Quartet of Middle East mediators.

 This must continue to be the measure for any support, she said. Theres no change in our assistance policy. But we remain committed to providing assistance to the Palestinian people and well continue to do that through the UN and other organisations.

 Israel has also vowed not to hand over to the unity government tax revenues it has been withholding. 

 Olmert said his contacts with Abbas would be limited to matters related to the quality of life of the Palestinian population in areas under Israels control.

 We think that the new government, as it has been declared and presented, limits our ability to conduct a dialogue with... (Abbas) and narrows the range of issues which we might have been able to discuss in the coming period, Olmert told his cabinet.

 He said the new governments platform contained very problematic elements, an apparent reference to its call for resistance against Israel in all its forms.

 While the unity government gives Abbas authority to negotiate with Israel, Hamas would have an effective veto over any deal that emerges, Israeli officials said.

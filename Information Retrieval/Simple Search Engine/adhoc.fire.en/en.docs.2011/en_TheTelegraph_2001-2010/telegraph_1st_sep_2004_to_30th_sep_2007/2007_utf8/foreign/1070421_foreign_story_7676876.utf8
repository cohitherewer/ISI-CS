 Gunman was bullied: Mates

 Blacksburg, April 20 (AP): Long before he massacred 32 people in the worst mass shooting in US history, Virginia Tech gunman Cho Seung-Hui was bullied by fellow students at school who mocked his shyness and the strange way he talked, former classmates said.

 He almost never opened his mouth in high school. When he finally did, his classmates laughed, pointed at him and said: Go back to China.

 As such details of the Virginia Tech shooters life come out, and experts pore over his sick and twisted writings and his videotaped rant, it is becoming increasingly clear that Cho was almost a textbook case of a school shooter: a painfully awkward, picked-on young man who lashed out with methodical fury at a world he believed was out to get him.

 In virtually every regard, Cho is prototypical of mass killers that Ive studied in the past 25 years, said Northeastern University criminal justice professor James Alan Fox, co-author of 16 books on crime. That doesnt mean, however, that one could have predicted his rampage.

 When criminologists and psychologists look at mass murders, Cho fits the themes they see repeatedly: a friendless figure, someone who has been bullied, someone who blames others and is bent on revenge, a careful planner, a male. And someone who sent up warning signs with his strange behaviour long in advance. Classmates in Virginia, where Cho grew up, said he was teased and picked on, apparently because of shyness and his strange, mumbly way of speaking. 

 Once, in English class at Westfield High School in Chantilly, Virginia, when the teacher had the students read aloud, Cho looked down when it was his turn, said Chris Davids, a Virginia Tech senior and high school classmate. After the teacher threatened him with a failing grade, Cho began reading in a strange, deep voice that sounded like he had something in his mouth, Davids said.

 The whole class started laughing and pointing and saying: Go back to China, Davids said.

 Stephanie Roberts, 22, a classmate of Chos at Westfield High, said she never witnessed anyone picking on Cho in high school. But she said friends of hers who went to middle school with him told her they recalled him getting bullied there. There were just some people who were really mean to him, Roberts said.

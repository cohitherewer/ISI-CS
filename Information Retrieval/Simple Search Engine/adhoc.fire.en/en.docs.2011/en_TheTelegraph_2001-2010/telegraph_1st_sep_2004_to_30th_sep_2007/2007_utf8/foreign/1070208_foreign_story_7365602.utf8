 Christinas cooking 

 New York, Feb. 7 (AP): Christina Aguilera has no problem showing skin especially on weekends with her husband, music executive Jordan Bratman.

 We claim ourselves to be the coziest couple ever. We have something called naked Sundays, the 26-year-old pop star tells talk show host Ellen DeGeneres in an interview. You have to keep marriage alive, spice it up, says Aguilera. So the couple stays in on Sundays, she says. We do everything naked. We cook naked. 

 You cook naked? asks DeGeneres. Aguilera replies: Yeah, we cook naked. Nothing with grease that could splatter, says DeGeneres. Well, unless you want the grease, Aguilera replies.

 NY fine for iPod violation

 New York (Reuters): New Yorkers who blithely cross the street listening to an iPod or talking on a cellphone could soon face a $100 fine. New York state Senator Carl Kruger says three pedestrians in his Brooklyn district have been killed since September upon stepping into traffic while distracted by an electronic device. Kruger says he will introduce legislation on Wednesday to ban the use of gadgets such as Blackberry devices and video games while crossing the street.

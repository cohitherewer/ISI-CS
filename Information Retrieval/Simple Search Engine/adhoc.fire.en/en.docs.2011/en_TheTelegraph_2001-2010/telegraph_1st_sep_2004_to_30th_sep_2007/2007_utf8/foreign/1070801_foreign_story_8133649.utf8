 Maoist exodus in search of jobs in India

 Disgruntled lot

 Kathmandu , July 31: More than 1,000 Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) fighters, including two platoon commanders, have deserted a UN-administered camp in southwestern Nepal to look for jobs in India and West Asia. 

 The desertions from the Maoist Fourth Division in Nawalparasi reportedly took place over the last couple of months after Maoist leaders failed to find a solution to the problems of their unhappy comrades. 

 The fighters accused their leaders of using the funds allocated by the coalition government for their maintenance for other purposes.

 During a news conference in the southern town of Narayangarh today, the self-styled PLA commander in the Jhyaltung Danda cantonment, Kul Prasad Bhattarai alias Kusum, said out of the 1500 registered fighters only 500 remained in the Nawalparasi camp. 

 Kusum claimed that 500 fighters lodged in three other camps have fled during the last few months because of ill-treatment by Maoist leaders. 

 He also alleged that the PLA cadres were being denied their monthly allowances and perks. The amount released by the government for the PLA fighters is being misused, he said adding that several of his comrades who were injured during the insurgency were denied medical treatment. 

 When we expressed our concern, we were threatened physically, he claimed.

 Kusum said the amount released by the government for the PLA fighters was being used only for party purposes. The fighters have no option, but to flee the camps and earn their livelihood, he said, adding that most of the PLA fighters have already left for India and West Asia in search of jobs. 

 However, the chief commander of the Maoist fourth division, Pratikshya, rejected Kusums claims and said the PLA fighters had merely left for their respective homes on leave. More than 12 per cent of the combatants seek home leave each month. They cannot be described as deserters, she added. 

 Passports revoked

 Nepals coalition government has revoked the passports of 34 businessmen, including King Gyanendras brother-in-law, for willfully defaulting on bank loans. The defaulters also include about a dozen Indian-origin Marwari businessmen, according to finance ministry sources.

 The kings brother-in-law, Mohan Bahadur Shahi, and the son of former Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chanda, Arun Chanda, are among the bank defaulters, reports the Kathmandu Post.

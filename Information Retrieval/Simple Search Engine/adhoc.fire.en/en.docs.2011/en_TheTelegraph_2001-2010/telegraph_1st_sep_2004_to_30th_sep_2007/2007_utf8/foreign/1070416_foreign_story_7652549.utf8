 Theft at titan of luxury fairs

 Bern, Switzerland, April 15 (AP): Thieves have stolen jewellery worth 1 million Swiss francs (about $825,000) from the worlds biggest and most luxurious watch and jewellery fair in Basel, authorities said yesterday.

 The theft occurred on Tuesday before the fair started, Basel prosecutors office spokesman Peter Gill said.

 The jewellery was grabbed when it was being brought to a stall in the exhibition hall for the Baselworld fair, he told The Associated Press. Nobody was injured, Gill added.

 He declined to comment further to avoid compromising the ongoing inquiry.

 The theft is likely to be the largest in the fairs recent history, Baselworld spokesman Bernhard Keller told AP. But he said that security at the fair was adequate.

 We have very good security measures. There is no need to change anything, he said, adding that the show was continuing normally.

 More than 2,000 exhibitors from 45 countries present the latest products from diamond encrusted masterpieces to modest plastic models at the fair, which runs from April 12 to 19.

 Indian robbed

 In another incident, thieves stole jewellery worth around 140,000 Swiss francs (around $115,000) on Saturday from an Indian businessman who was on his way home from Baselworld, police said.

 Thieves grabbed the mans suitcase containing the jewellery and clothing while he was at Zurich airport checking in for a flight, police said. No arrests had been made.

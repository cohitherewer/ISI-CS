 Sacked judge turns tables on Pervez

 Bombshell

 Islamabad, May 29 (PTI): Suspended chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry today accused President Pervez Musharraf, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz and chiefs of the intelligence agencies of physically preventing him from leaving the Army House in Rawalpindi on March 9 after he refused to resign.

 The Army House is Musharrafs temporary office.

 As arguments on a petition filed by Chaudhry challenging the presidential reference against him drew to a close after two weeks of hearing, the chief justice sprang a surprise by filing an affidavit alleging that he was confined for over five hours at Army House against his will. Chaudhry alleged that during his confinement, he was pressured to quit as chief justice.

 The petition against the presidential reference is being heard by a 13-member full bench of the Pakistan supreme court. 

 Chaudhry said he was grilled for over five hours by Musharraf, Aziz and director-generals of the ISI, the Military Intelligence and the Intelligence Bureau. The chief justice said he was physically restrained from leaving the Army House.

 The affidavit was filed by Chaudhrys lead counsel Aitzaz Ahsan after he concluded his arguments on the judges main petition. 

 The accusations against Musharraf and Aziz are bound to spark renewed protests from lawyers and Opposition parties.

 Chaudhry claims in the affidavit that Musharraf insisted he should resign and , if the chief justice decided to do so, the President would accommodate him.

 Musharraf also said that in case Chaudhry refused to quit, he will then have to face the reference which could be a bigger embarrassment for the suspended judge, according to the affidavit.

 In response, Chaudhry said: I wouldnt resign and would face any reference since I am innocent. I have not violated any code of conduct or any law, rule or regulation. I believe that I am myself the guardian of law. I strongly believe God will help me.

 This angered Musharraf who stood up and left the room along with his MS (military secretary), COS (chief of staff) and the Prime Minister, saying that others would show evidence against him, Chaudhrys affidavit said.

 Chaudhry alleged that he was illegally and unlawfully restrained from performing his constitutional functions as a judge of this honourable court and as chief justice of Pakistan. He said he was sent on compulsory leave by Musharraf for his refusal to resign.

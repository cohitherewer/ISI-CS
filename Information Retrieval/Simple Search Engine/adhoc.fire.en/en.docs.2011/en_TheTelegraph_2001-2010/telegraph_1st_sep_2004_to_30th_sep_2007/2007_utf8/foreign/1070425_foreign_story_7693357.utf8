 3D images to predict sun storms

 Washington, April 24 (Reuters): The first three-dimensional images of the Sun from a pair of spacecraft orbiting the planet were released yesterday and can begin helping scientists predict when and how hard dangerous solar storms will hit, the US space agency Nasa said.

 Such storms can disrupt satellites, communications and sometimes the electricity supply, and may endanger astronauts in Earth orbit as well as commercial airline flights.

 The twin Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, or STEREO, satellites can create more accurate, real-time views of these storms, called coronal mass ejections, project scientists said.

 The improvement with STEREOs 3D view is like going from a regular X-ray to a 3D CAT scan in the medical field, said Michael Kaiser, STEREO Project Scientist at Nasas Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.

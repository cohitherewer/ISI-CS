 Britney, Paris worst-dressed

 Los Angeles, Jan. 10 (Reuters): Pop star Britney Spears and hotel heiress Paris Hilton, dubbed the Screamgirls by Blackwell, landed at the top of the former designers annual worst dressed list yesterday.

 The celebrities, who forged a friendship at Hollywood and Las Vegas nightclubs last year, were also described by Blackwell as style-free and fashion deprived. The wife of Britains Prince Charles, teen star Lindsay Lohan and singer Christina Aguilera were also subjected to his sartorial skewering.

 Spears, whose fashion choices made headlines in late 2006 when photographs of her stepping out of cars showed she wasnt wearing panties, has been a favourite target of Blackwell for the past six years.

 The self-appointed style guru made no direct reference to the singers underwear choices, but described Spears and Hilton as two peas in an overexposed pod.

 In Blackwells 47th annual report, Camilla Parker-Bowles, wife of Britains future king, Prince Charles, placed an ignominious second as the duchess of dowdy and a royal wreck because of her penchant for feathered hats.

 Blackwell put Freaky Friday actress Lindsay Lohan in third place, calling her tragically trapped in fashions fast lane.

 Singers Christina Aguilera (all crass, no class) and Mariah Carey (queen of catastrophic kitsch) came in fourth and fifth.

 American Idol judge Paula Abdul, and actresses Sharon Stone, Tori Spelling and Sandra Oh, were also deemed fashion fiascoes, while Blackwell said Meryl Streeps wardrobe made him want to weep.

 Blackwells list has become a Hollywood tradition over the decades, poking fun at icons ranging from Queen Elizabeth to Elizabeth Taylor. Blackwell was one of the top Los Angeles designers of the 1960s, creating fashions for the likes of Jayne Mansfield, Peggy Lee and Nancy Reagan.

 He urged the women on his 2006 list to emulate fabulous fashion independents like Kate Winslet, Angelina Jolie, Helen Mirren, Barbra Streisand and Beyonce Knowles.

 Blackwells worst-dressed women of 2006 are:

 Britney Spears/Paris Hilton

 Camilla Parker-Bowles

 Lindsay Lohan

 Christina Aguilera

 Mariah Carey

 Paula Abdul

 Sharon Stone

 Tori Spelling

 Sandra Oh

 Meryl Streep

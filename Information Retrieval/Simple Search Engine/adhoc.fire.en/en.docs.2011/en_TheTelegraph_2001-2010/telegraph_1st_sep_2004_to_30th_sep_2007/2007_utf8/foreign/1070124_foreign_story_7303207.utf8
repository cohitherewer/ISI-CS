 Kathmandu, Jan. 23: The Girija Prasad Koirala government today formally invited the agitating Madhesi Peoples Rights Forum (MPRF) for talks as hundreds of riot police patrolled two towns in Siraha district of Nepal after violent anti-government protests.

 The Madhesis were invited for talks at a cabinet meeting held at Prime Minister Koiralas residence in Kathmandu. They decided that the unrest in Siraha can only be tackled through talks and election to the Constituent Assembly. 

 Briefing reporters after the meeting, deputy Prime Minister Amik Sherchan said the cabinet also decided to sanction (Nepal) Rs 1 million each to families of those killed in the unrest in Lahan town of Siraha district and provide free medical treatment to the injured.

 The cabinet also decided to strengthen the administration in Siraha district and take concrete steps to make the people feel more secure. The cabinet decision to invite the Madhesis for talks is in consonance with the suggestion made by the eight-party alliance yesterday, he said.

 The MPRF chairman Upendra Yadav welcomed the governments decision to hold talks saying that discussions alone would resolve all Terai issues. 

 However, he said that the invitation must come through official channels. We are ready for talks provided the government is willing to address all problems of the people of Terai, he added. 

 Five persons have died in the violence involving Maoists, Madhesi activists and police in Lahan in the last four days. 

 The Terai is a narrow strip of fertile flat land. Its Madhesi inhabitants share closer cultural links with India than with Nepalis in the Himalayan mountains of the north.

 We want a federal structure of government and regional autonomy for Terai ... We want elimination of discriminations against the people of Terai including racial, lingual, cultural and economic, Yadav said.

 Lawyers vow protest as Pervez files papers

 Islamabad, Sept. 26 (AP): Lawyers vowed to defy a ban on public gatherings and stage a historic protest when President Pervez Musharraf files nomination papers tomorrow to formalise his disputed bid for a new five-year term.

 The government said security forces would prevent any disruption as part of a crackdown on Opposition protests ahead of next months presidential election.

 Musharraf has seen his popularity and power erode since his botched effort to fire the supreme courts chief justice earlier this year. Lawyers were at the forefront of mass protests then, claiming the general was illegally interfering in the judiciary.

 Many have aligned themselves with an Opposition movement that claims Musharraf cant run in the October 6 ballot of national and provincial legislators because he has retained his powerful dual role as army chief. The supreme court is considering several legal challenges to his candidacy. The court is preparing to issue a ruling on the petitions.

 Some of the 17 government lawmakers who have nominated Musharraf will file election papers on his behalf at the Election Commission in the capital, Islamabad, said information minister Mohammed Ali Durrani. Elaborate security precautions are being implemented, he said, after attorneys earlier promised to disrupt the filing. Only official government media will be allowed to cover the proceedings.

 The lawyers were more circumspect today in the wake of a government crackdown that has seen at least 100 Opposition party leaders and members perhaps many more taken into preventive custody to stymie street protests. The arrests have sparked sharp criticism, including from the US.

 The capitals government also has imposed a ban on gatherings of more than five people. God willing, it will be a historic protest, said Munir Malik, president of the Supreme Court Bar Association. Asked whether lawyers will try to physically stop Musharrafs nomination from being filed, Malik said: We are peaceful people. We have neither a gun nor any weapon. We only have pens and minds. Tariq Mahmood, another senior bar member, said the attorneys will protest by shouting slogans and waving their fists assuming they are not rounded up beforehand or prevented from leaving their homes.

 People have been asked to come, Mahmood said. They should come so that there is an expression that we do not approve of what is happening.

 The possible confrontation is the latest twist in a cat-and-mouse game between the general and the Opposition. 

 Musharraf has pledged to step down as military chief and restore civilian rule if he gets a fresh mandate on October 6. But a government lawyer said yesterday the general would remain army chief if he is not re-elected. 

 That has fuelled Opposition claims that Musharraf will declare a state of emergency if the court blocks his candidacy in a ruling expected within days.

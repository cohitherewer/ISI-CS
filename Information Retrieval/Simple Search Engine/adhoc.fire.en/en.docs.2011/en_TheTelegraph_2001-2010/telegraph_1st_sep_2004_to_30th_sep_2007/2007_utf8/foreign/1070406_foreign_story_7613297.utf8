 Vice squads end raids

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 Islamabad, April 5: The vice and virtue squads of a local Islamic school, which are modelled on the Talibans moral police, have stopped raiding DVD and video shops in Islamabad after the government warned that it would not tolerate such actions.

 Our students will not carry out raids on video shops in future, said Abdul Rashid Ghazi, vice-principal of the Jamia Hafza seminary.

 In January this year, female students from the seminary occupied a public library in Islamabad to protest against the demolition of mosques by the local administration.

 Ghazi told The Telegraph that he would rather hold meetings with traders of video shops in the Melody and Aabpara markets and convince them not to keep or conduct business in vulgar English and Indian films. 

 We will also ask them not to indulge in un-Islamic practices by playing and selling vulgar Pakistani stage shows and Indian films, Ghazi said .

 According to directives issued by Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, any bearded, baton-wielding students who try to harass traders in local markets will be arrested. 

 Male Jamia Hafza students had started patrolling the two markets early last week and warned the traders to close their un-Islamic businesses. 

 The majority of the traders, especially those doing business in videos, were unnerved by the student harassment and said it was simply impossible to switch over to other businesses as it would require huge funding. 

 He said all video stores in the two markets were selling Indian and English movies and Pakistani stage shows. 

 How can we indulge in selling pornographic films in these markets where raids by the local administration is a routine matter, he said, adding that it is also unethical and un-Islamic to sell such films.

 Foggy art

 London, May 16 (AP): London may be famous for its fog but is it art?

 Artist Antony Gormleys new Blind Light installation challenges visitors to see for themselves, luring them into a reinforced glass box that then surrounds them in a cloud of bright, white fog so thick even their own feet vanish in the mist.

 Gormley described the work at the Hayward Gallery as a climatological and sociological experiment that forces visitors to face a disorienting experience. He said the idea of blending people into the fog is also to make visitors part of the art.

 Music night

 Las Vegas (AP): Kenny

 Chesney collected his third consecutive entertainer

 of the year trophy on Tuesday as the Academy

 of Country Music honoured veteran George Strait,

 newcomer Carrie Underwood and gave an unprecedented

 14th vocal duo award to Brooks amp; Dunn. Brooks amp; Dunn were up against some stiff competition from Sugarland, Montgomery Gentry, Big amp; Rich and The Wreckers, and Ronnie Dunn fretted before the show that the pair had to lose sooner or later.

 Script spat

 Los Angeles (AP): A jury determined that adventure author Clive Cussler breached his contract and ordered him to pay $5 million (euro3.69 million) to the production company that turned his novel Sahara into a box-office flop. Superior court Judge John P. Shook will decide at a later time whether the production company, Crusader Entertainment, has the screen rights to a second book by Cussler and, if so, whether it must pay about $8 million (euro5.91 million) the author claims he is owed for that book.

 Record art

 New York (AP): The record

 price for postwar art was broken twice at

 a Sothebys auction, first with a Francis

 Bacon work a and later with a Mark Rothko

 painting, which went for almost $73 million,

 the auction house said. The 1950 Rothko painting, White Center (Yellow, Pink and Lavender on Rose),

 of blocks of colour, sold for $72.8 million.

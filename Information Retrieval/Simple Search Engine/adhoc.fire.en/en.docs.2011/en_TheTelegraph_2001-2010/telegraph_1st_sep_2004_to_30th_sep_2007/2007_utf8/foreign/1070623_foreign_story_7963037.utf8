 Lara gets a remake boost

 Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft

 Dallas, June 22 (AP): Scantily clad dungeon-crawler Lara Croft has been reborn many times over the years as a line of video-game sequels and mediocre (OK, terrible) film remakes starring Angelina Jolie.

 Now this digital heroine is reprising her role from the original game with a remake of sorts called Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Anniversary.

 A lot has changed in the decade since the groundbreaking original. Gone are the barely distinguishable blocky graphics and the unforgiving controls that would often spell instant death.

 Developer Crystal Dynamics has instead created a $29.99 (euro22) remake that feels new and not some quick way to cash in on the franchise once again.

 Everything in Anniversary the precise, dynamic controls, the impressive, though not quite next-gen visuals, and the expansive, puzzling levels speaks of a game thats received a proper, careful overhaul for the PC and PlayStation 2. The games devoted fan following will love it.

 The games story remains essentially unchanged, and youll spend most of your time bounding from one obstacle to another with pistols in hand.

 Its cool reliving all those exciting moments from the original, culminating with a showdown with a towering T-rex. (And this updated beast has some pals that make it a much greater, more engaging challenge.)

 The puzzles, and there are many, are far more interactive and complex than they were in the first game. 

 And Laras far easier to move around than ever before thanks to a revamped control scheme that is far more precise.

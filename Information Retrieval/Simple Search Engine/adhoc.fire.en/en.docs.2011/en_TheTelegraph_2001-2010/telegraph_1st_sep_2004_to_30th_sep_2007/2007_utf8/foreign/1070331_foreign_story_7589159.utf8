 Shopper details stolen by hackers

 STEPHANIE CONDRON

 London, March 30: Shoppers were warned yesterday that hackers have stolen the details of 45.7 million credit and debit cards used at TK Maxx stores in this country and other shops owned by its parent company abroad.

 Warnings were issued to customers of the designer discount chain that their personal details and card information may have been stolen to commit fraud.

 US retailer TJX, which owns the TK Maxx chain, said it had told the authorities in the US, Canada, Britain and Ireland of the breach which includes the theft of personal information, including driver licence and social security details, belonging to 455,000 customers.

 It is suspected to be the biggest financial data breach in history and shoppers are being warned that the firm does not yet know who is behind it. 

 Britons love of fashion at bargain prices last year made TK Maxx the third favourite chain in the country, after John Lewis and Waitrose, according to market research.

 The shop sells designer labels including Betty Jackson and Jean Paul Gaultier at massive discounts. The company, which operates TJ Maxx in the US and TK Maxx in Britain and Ireland, has said the hackers could have begun stealing customers card data as far back as July 2005.

 Hackers have broken into the stores US systems but it remains unclear whether they accessed information from the firms database in Watford which services the companys 210 British outlets. Last night, the company said it could not put a figure on how many of its thousands of British customers may have been caught in the security breakdown.

 Managers only found out about the breach in December 2006 after noting suspicious software on computer systems. They later discovered that there was strong reason to believe that our computer systems had been intruded upon, it said yesterday.

 No customer data was stolen after December 18, 2006, and the hackers had not accessed customer PIN numbers or customers names and addresses, it said. 

 And three quarters of the cards affected had expired by the time of the data theft or the stolen information did not include the security code from the back.

 We do not know who the intruder was, or if there were one or more intruders, the firm told customers on its website yesterday. Our investigation is ongoing, and we are dedicating substantial resources to the effort.

 We currently have a very large team working on the investigation. Given the nature of the technology used in the intrusion as well as the scale and geographic scope of our business and computer systems and the time frames involved in the intrusion, the investigation is, by necessity, taking time.

 It said payment card transaction information from all its stores including TK Maxx in Britain and Ireland may have been stolen but it has yet to discover exactly what data was obtained.

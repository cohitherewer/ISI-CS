 Poland cleric quits in spy row

 Warsaw, Jan. 7 (Reuters): The newly-appointed archbishop of Warsaw resigned today after admitting he spied for Polands former communist regime, in a major embarrassment for the Vatican and the powerful Polish Catholic Church.

 Archbishop Stanislaw Wielgus read out his resignation, which came at the request of Pope Benedict who appointed him just a month ago, at a special mass in Warsaw Cathedral replacing a formal ceremony that was to have sworn him in. In accordance with (Canon law) I submit to your Holiness my resignation as the Metropolitan Archbishop of Warsaw, said Wielgus, who on Friday backed down from repeated denials that he collaborated with the secret services during the communist era.

 Hundreds of faithful gathered in the rain in front of the cathedral cheered in support of Wielgus, yelling Stay with us, a chant used during visits to his homeland by the late Polish-born Pope John Paul.

 A finding last week by a special Polish Church commission that Wielgus had collaborated with communist-era secret police increased pressure on him ahead of his ceremonial installation, which was scheduled for this morning.

 Harry quit threat if no Iraq trip

 TIM HALL

 Natural target

 London, April 26: Prince Harry is likely to leave the army if he is not sent to fight in Iraq, a source at the Household Cavalry Regiment said.

 The warning came after the ministry of defence stated that the 22 year-olds deployment is under constant consideration, raising doubts over whether he will see front-line service in the war zone. 

 Prince Harry took time out with his girlfriend, Chelsy Davy, to watch the football last night This comes as a huge surprise, the source said. As of today, as far as the regiments concerned, he is definitely, definitely going (to Iraq). This is what he signed up for and if he doesnt go, he will sign off and leave. He joined the army for a bit of excitement and for him to be told hes not going would be awful. quot; 

 He said the third in line to the throne would be safe in Iraq and added that there would be a bad feeling if Prince Harry was prevented from going. 

 The ministry of defence insisted that it hasnt yet changed its plan to send Prince Harry to Iraq in an active role with his squadron, the Blues and Royals, which is part of the Household Cavalry. 

 As an officer, Prince Harry is responsible for leading a reconnaissance team of four armoured fighting vehicles and 11 men. However, senior military figures are said to be increasingly concerned that insurgents will target him on the battlefield, increasing the danger to other soldiers. 

 Militants have stepped up attacks on British forces considerably in recent months using increasingly sophisticated roadside bombs. In response to todays news, Clarence House maintained that Prince Harry remains on track to head out to Iraq, but declined to comment further. Its an army decision and always has been and always will be, quot; a spokesman said. 

 As a career soldier, Prince Harry has always been determined to see action on the front line. In an interview to mark his 21st birthday, he said: Theres no way Im going to put myself through Sandhurst and then sit on my arse back home while my boys are out fighting for their country.

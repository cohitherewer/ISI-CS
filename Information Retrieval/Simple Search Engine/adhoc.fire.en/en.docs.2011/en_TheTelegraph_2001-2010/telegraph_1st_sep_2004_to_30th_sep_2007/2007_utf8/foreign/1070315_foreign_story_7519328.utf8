 Korea committed to disarming: UN

 Beijing, March 14 (Reuters): North Korea is committed to a disarmament agreement reached in February but wants sanctions against it lifted first, the head of the UN nuclear watchdog said today on return from the reclusive communist state.

 It was the International Atomic Energy Agencys first negotiations with North Korea in more than four years, even though IAEA head Mohamed ElBaradei was told the Norths top nuclear negotiator was too busy to meet him.

 ElBaradei said the visit had been quite useful and had opened the way to a normal relationship. He said North Korea was positive about returning to IAEA membership, but wanted sanctions against it lifted.

 I think they were very clear that they are willing to implement the February 13 agreement once the other parties implement their part, he said, referring to an agreement reached at six-party talks grouping the two Koreas, Russia, Japan, the US and host China. The DPRK (North Korea) mentioned that they are waiting for the lifting of sanctions with regard to the Macau bank.

 Referring to the closure of the Yongbyon nuclear plant, he said: They said they are ready, willing and capable of doing that as soon as the financial sanctions are lifted.

 ElBaradeis visit was the first by the agency since late 2002, when North Korea expelled its inspectors as an earlier disarmament deal fell apart. It withdrew from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty days later.

 Under the terms of the February agreement, the Yongbyon reactor, which makes plutonium that can be used in nuclear weapons, must be shut by mid-April in return for an initial shipment of heavy fuel oil.

 South Korean foreign minister Song Min-soon said earlier that North Korea had shown no signs of closing the reactor. North Korea tested its first nuclear device last October, drawing widespread condemnation and UN sanctions.

 There is no indication of a change in the operational condition of Yongbyon, Song said in Seoul.

 Earlier this week, a US official said North Korea was preparing to shut down the Yongbyon complex, but other US officials have been more guarded.

 The IAEA, which is trying to iron out the details of a return of its inspectors to North Korea, will be key to verifying whether the reclusive state makes good on its pledge.

 - GADGET TO HAVE MORE TALK TIME

 It has been dubbed the most hotly-anticipated gadget ever launched. But days before the iPhones release, Apple fuelled the expectancy by announcing last-minute upgrades to the device including longer battery life than first promised and an improved screen.

 The companys stock which has risen by 30 per cent since the iPhones unveiling in January rose by nearly three per cent on the announcement, adding $2 billion to Apples market value, in response to news that allayed one of several concerns about the device.

 The multi-faceted gadget will now have eight hours of talk time up from five, six hours of Internet use, seven hours of video playback or 24 hours of audio playback and 250 hours on stand-by. 

 The 3.5 inch screen has also been upgraded from plastic to optical-quality glass to achieve a superior level of scratch resistance and optical clarity, the company said.

 With eight hours of talk time, and 24 hours of audio playback, iPhones battery life is longer than any other smart phone and even longer than most mp3 players, said Steve Jobs, Apples CEO.

 There has never been a phone like iPhone, and we cant wait to get this truly magical product into the hands of customers starting just 11 days from today, he added.

 The last-minute tweaks will fuel speculation that Apple staff are having to work round the clock to meet the June 29 launch deadline.

 The company has already delayed its next generation computer operating system so its staff could prioritise work on the device, Apples first phone, which has been built off the success of its iPod music and video player.

 Given the fervour surrounding the product, the upgrades are no doubt also an indication of the enormous pressure the company is feeling to live up to such high expectations.

 Despite its cost prices start at $499 an estimated 19 million of Americas 100 million mobile phone users are interested in buying the handset, according to a survey by M:Metrics.

 An estimated seven million Britons are also keen to buy an iPhone when it comes on to the UK market later this year, the same report said, although no date has been set.

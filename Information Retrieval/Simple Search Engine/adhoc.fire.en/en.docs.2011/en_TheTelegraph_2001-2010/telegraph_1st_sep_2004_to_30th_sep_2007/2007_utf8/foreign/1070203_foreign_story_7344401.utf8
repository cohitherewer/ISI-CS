 Severe storms turn Bangla island smaller

 St Martins Island in Bangladesh

 Dhaka, Feb. 2 (Reuters): Every year, St. Martins island in Bangladesh gets a little smaller. The storms that batter its fragile shores are becoming increasingly severe and more and more coral is lost to the waves.

 Local council chairman Moulvi Feroze Ahmed doesnt know much about global warming or scientists dire predictions for the fate of low-lying Bangladesh. But he fears for the future and the livelihoods of thousands of people on Bangladeshs only coral island.

 No one has ever told my people what awaits them in 50 years or a century, Feroze said today, hours before a UN climate panel released a report issuing the strongest warning yet that human activities are heating the planet.

 But I have seen the island gradually reduced to a size of 8 sq-km now from 12 sq-km 20 years ago, he said from Saint Martins in the Bay of Bengal off the countrys southernmost tip of Teknaf.

 The corals are being eroded, land being squeezed. This is what we see ... and wonder why the Bay that gives us fish and a secure living is becoming cruel, Feroze, 55, said.

 Recently, various sea species including turtles and dolphins are dying along our shores. But we dont know why.

 Bangladesh, with more than 140 million people, is one of the worlds most densely populated nations. 

 It is also one of the most ill-prepared to face global warming and also likely to be among the nations worst affected, officials and experts said today.

 Millions of people live along the largely flat delta bound by the Bay of Bengal to the south.

 As sea levels rise and storms increase in number and severity, vast areas of land will be swallowed by the sea, experts say. Millions of Bangladeshis will lose their land and homes, adding to the South Asian countrys plight of poverty and overcrowding, said Ainun Nishat, Bangladesh country representative of the World Conservation Union.

 More than 11 per cent of Bangladeshs land area would be lost if sea levels rose by 1 metre over the next 50 or 100 years, he said.

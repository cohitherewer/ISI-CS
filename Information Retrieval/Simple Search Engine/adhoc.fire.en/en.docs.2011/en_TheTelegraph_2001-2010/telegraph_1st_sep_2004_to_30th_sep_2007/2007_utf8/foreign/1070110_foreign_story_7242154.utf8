 Men in cage

 Adelaide, Jan. 9 (Reuters): An Australian zoo has put a group of humans on display to raise awareness about primate conservation - with the proviso that they dont get up to any monkey business. 

 Over a month, the humans will be locked in an unused orang-utan cage at Adelaide zoo, braving the searing heat and snacking on bananas. They will be monitored by a psychologist who hopes to use the findings to improve conditions for real apes in captivity. 

 Audiences can vote for their favourite ape via SMSes, in the style of reality television shows, and at the end of the month, a super human will be selected. 

 Dirty dance 

 Sydney: It was intended as a cheeky charity stunt but a topless Haka performed by a British womens rugby team has been criticised as offensive by Maori in New Zealand. 

 The team, from Canterbury, Kent, were smeared with mud and wearing only shorts when they were photographed leaping into the air in a parody of the Maori war dance, made famous by New Zealands rugby team, the All Blacks, The Daily Telegraph said. 

 The women preserved their modesty with one arm covering their breasts. 

 Lottery kid 

 Berlin (Reuters): A German student who won 1 million euros ($1.3 million) in a television quiz show wants to use part of his jackpot to pay for his parents wedding. 

 Timur Hahn, 26, who studies English, media studies and computing in Marburg, said after the show that he wanted to pay back his mother for all her support.

 She plans to marry my father this summer, even though theyve been together for almost 30 years. She could really use the money for the wedding, Hahn said.

 Hahn, who lives on 200 euros a week and has his rent paid by mother, said he wanted to use some of the rest of the cash to finance his studies and buy a rail pass.

 Bangla mayor gets 13 years

 Dhaka, Aug. 26 (AP): A court today sentenced the mayor of a northern Bangladeshi city to 13 years in prison for extortion, news report said, the latest conviction in an ongoing government campaign to crack down on corruption.

 Mizanur Rahman was arrested in June on suspicion of demanding kickbacks to allow a college to build a new facility in Rajshahi city, 230km northwest of the capital, Dhaka, the United News of Bangladesh said, citing court papers.

 Additional district and sessions judge Zahirul Haq handed down similar sentences to 10 of Rahmans associates who were accused in the same case, the report said.

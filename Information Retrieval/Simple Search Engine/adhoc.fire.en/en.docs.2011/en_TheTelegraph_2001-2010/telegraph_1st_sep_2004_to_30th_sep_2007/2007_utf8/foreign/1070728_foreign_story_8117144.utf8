 Islamabad, July 27 (AP): A suspected suicide bombing killed at least 13 people and wounded 71 others today at a hotel near Islamabads Lal Masjid, after religious students occupied the mosque and demanded the return of its pro-Taliban cleric.

 The explosion occurred soon after police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of protesters who for several hours took control of the mosque which the government reopened to the public today two weeks after a bloody army siege dislodged militants.

 There was no claim of responsibility for the bombing, but Islamic militants will be suspected as behind what is the latest in a string of attacks to hit Pakistan since the army operation at the Lal Masjid left at least 102 people dead.

 Amir Mehmood, a witness, said the blast went off inside the Muzaffar Hotel, located in a crowded market area about a half-kilometre from the mosque. He said he saw blood, body parts, and shreds of Punjab police uniform inside the hotel. Neighboring shops and food stalls were also hit by the blast.

 Another witness, Nisar Ahmed, said: It was a very big blast. I myself saw two bodies flying into the air and falling on the road. 

 Khalid Pervez, Islamabads top administrator, said 13 people were killed, including seven police, and 71 were wounded.

 Interior secretary Kamal Shah said initial reports suggested it was a suicide attack targeting police. Police were the target of attack, he said, adding that it was probably retaliation for the Lal Masjid assault. 

 Earlier today, protesters had occupied the mosque after forcing the retreat of a government-appointed cleric who was assigned to lead Friday prayers there.

 Police largely stood by as the demonstrators clambered onto ladders and the roof, and began splashing red paint onto the walls to restore the mosques namesake colour after a government restoration left it pale yellow. They also installed a black flag with two crossed swords meant to symbolise jihad.

 But street battles erupted when religious students and other supporters of the mosques pro-Taliban former clerics threw stones at dozens of police in riot gear on a road outside the mosque. After protesters disregarded police calls to disperse peacefully, police fired the tear gas, and scattered the crowd.

 Pak tests nuclear missile

 Islamabad, March 22 (Reuters): Pakistan successfully tested today a nuclear-capable cruise missile with a range of 700 km, the military said.

 The Hatf V11 Babur missile is a terrain-hugging, radar avoiding cruise missile capable of carrying a variety of warheads including nuclear, it said. The flight data collected validated the design parameters set for the flight test, the military said. It is a highly manoeuvrable missile with pin-point accuracy.

 The missile was first tested in 2005. Since then, its range has been enhanced to 700 km, from 500 km previously, the military said, although it did not say how.

 President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz had congratulated scientists and engineers involved and assured them of complete support in development plans of all strategic projects, the military said.

 India has cruise missiles that can be launched from a submarine.

 The neighbours, who have fought three wars since 1947, both tested nuclear devices in 1998. Their relations have improved since they launched a peace process in 2004.

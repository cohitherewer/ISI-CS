 Saddam splits Brown, Blair

 London, Jan. 7 (Reuters): British finance minister Gordon Brown has condemned the way Saddam Hussein was hanged as deplorable in contrast to Prime Minister Tony Blair who has yet to comment in person on the execution.

 Hours after the comments, a spokeswoman for Blair said the Prime Minister supports an Iraqi probe into the way the hanging was conducted.

 He believes the manner of the execution was completely wrong but that this should not lead us to forget the crimes he (Saddam) committed included the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis as a deliberate act of policy.

 A cellphone video showed observers taunting Saddam with shouts of Go to hell and chanting the name of a Shia cleric before he fell through a gallows trapdoor. 

 The images provoked international criticism and further inflamed sectarian passions in Iraq. 

 Brown, expected to take over as premier when Blair steps down this year, said: Now that we know the full picture of what happened, we can sum this up as a deplorable set of events.

 In an interview with BBC, Brown said: Even those people, unlike me, who are in favour of capital punishment found this completely unacceptable. It has done nothing to lessen tensions between Shia and Sunni communities.

 Asked about the hanging when visiting a London hospital on Friday, Blair said: Ive decided to talk about health today. I will talk about all those other issues next week.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Blair voice

 London, Jan. 10: Tony Blair 

 broke his 10-day silence on the execution of Saddam Hussein 

 last night, saying the manner in which the hanging was conducted 

 was completely wrong. 

 But the taunts he endured before execution, should not blind us to the crimes he committed against his own people, he said. 

 Blair supported an Iraqi government inquiry into the conduct of the execution.

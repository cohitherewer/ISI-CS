 Nepal alliance to hold polls in November

 Koirala: New hope

 Kathmandu, May 31: Nepals ruling parties today finally decided to hold the Constituent Assembly elections by the third week of November this year. 

 The elections, which was supposed to be held in June this year, was postponed after the Election Commission said it did not have the resources to hold the polls that soon.

 Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala met Maoist chief Prachanda and other eight-party alliance leaders today at his official residence and agreed to reschedule the polls for the Nepali month beginning on November 17.

 Nepali Congress leader Prakash Sharan Mahat, who attended the meeting, said the alliance authorised Koirala to fix the poll date in consultation with the Election Commission. The cabinet will formally decide the exact date for the elections soon, Mahat said, adding: The timing was suggested by the Prime Minister and other leaders agreed.

 He said the Maoists raised an objection by saying that the elections may not take place as long as the monarchy continued to remain a force. However, the Maoists did not formally object to the election date. They merely said their support to the poll process is conditional, Mahat said. 

 The alliance also decided to review the delineation of the electoral constituencies to accommodate the demands of the Madhesi groups.

 However, the CPN (UML) submitted a note of dissent at the meeting on the decision to review the delineation of the constituencies. They believe that only a proportional representationbased electoral system can resolve the problems in the plains. 

 At least 60 people were killed this year in protests by ethnic Madhesis living in the the countrys southern plains. They demanded more seats in parliament and more government jobs.

 The violence overshadowed the peace deal with the Maoists. Several ethnic groups as well as two splinter rebel groups which split from the main Maoists in 2004 are also fighting for the autonomy of the region.

 Maoist lawmaker Dinanath Sharma said the former rebels want the monarchy to be abolished before the election in November to reduce the chances of King Gyanendras supporters disrupting the polls and derailing the peace process.

 The king was forced to give up his authoritarian rule last year after week of pro-democracy protests organised by the main political parties.

 Ethnic protest

 An umbrella body of ethnic communities in Nepal has called for a nationwide shutdown tomorrow to protest against a supreme court verdict which, they alleged, discriminated against their culture.

 On June 1, 1999, the supreme court ruled that work of all municipalities be carried out in the official Nepali language.

 Fiennes in sky sex scandal

 Fiennes

 Sydney, Feb. 11 (afp): British movie star Ralph Fiennes is at the centre of a mile-high sex scandal after he allegedly became amorous with an Australian flight attendant during a long-haul flight, a report said today.

 A 38-year-old Qantas stewardess has been suspended and could lose her job after fellow crew members allegedly spotted her and Fiennes leaving the same aircraft toilet cubicle moments apart.

 In a statement lodged with her employer, Lisa Robertson said the actor had become amorous with her after the pair chatted together during a flight from Australia to India late last month.

 But she denied having sex with the 44-year-old star of The English Patient and Schindlers List.

 While conversing with Mr Fiennes during my break, I expressed a need to go to the toilet, Robertson said in her statement. I went to the nearby toilet and entered it, he followed me and entered the same toilet.

 I explained to him that this was inappropriate and asked him to leave. Mr fiennes became amorous towards me and, after a short period of time, I convinced him to leave the toilet, which he did.

 I left the toilet a short time later.

 A spokesman for Qantas confirmed that a flight attendant had been stood down following an on-board incident.

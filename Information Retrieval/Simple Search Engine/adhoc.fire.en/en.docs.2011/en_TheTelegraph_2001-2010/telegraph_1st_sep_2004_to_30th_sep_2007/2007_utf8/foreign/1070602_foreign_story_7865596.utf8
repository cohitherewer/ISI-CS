 Babur ready for induction

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, June 1: Pakistans Army Strategic Force Command is all set to induct the ground-launched cruise missile Babur which is being upgraded to a range of 1,000 km. 

 The Babar cruise missile, which has been tested twice since August 2005, is a terrain hugging, radar-avoiding cruise missile. 

 According to military officials, it is a highly manoeuvrable missile with pinpoint accuracy. 

 Pakistani scientists are working to improve the missiles range from 500 km to 1,000 km so that it can be inducted into the armed forces as soon as possible. The missile was last tested on March 22. The army had announced that the flight data collected after the successful test-firing backed the design parameters of the missile. 

 Pakistan formally kicked off its medium-range missile programme in April 1998.

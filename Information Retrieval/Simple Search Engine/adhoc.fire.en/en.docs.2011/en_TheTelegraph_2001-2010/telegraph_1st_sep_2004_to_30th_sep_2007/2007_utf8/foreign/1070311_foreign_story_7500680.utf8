 Fine Print

 Following Fab Four

 New York, March 10 (Reuters): A group of New York musicians is planning to do what the Beatles never did perform the songs the Fab Four might have recorded as their final album had they stayed together just a little longer.

 The Beatles tribute band The Fab Faux made up of some of the New Yorks leading professional musicians will perform the songs they think would have been on that album on Tuesday and Wednesday. The performance at New Yorks Webster Hall consists of material from the original Fab Fours early solo careers.

 All tracks will be performed with distinctive Beatles-type arrangements, rather than the spartan feel of Lennons early recordings and McCartneys first solo effort, recorded at his home almost as a demo tape.

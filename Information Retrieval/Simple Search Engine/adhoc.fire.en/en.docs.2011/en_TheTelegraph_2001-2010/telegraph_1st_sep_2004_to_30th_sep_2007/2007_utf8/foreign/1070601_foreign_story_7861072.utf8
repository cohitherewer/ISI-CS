 Mirren to star in film set in Gaza

 Human interest

 London, May 31 (Reuters): Oscar-winner Helen Mirren is being lined up to star in a film set in the Gaza Strip, as a woman whose journalist daughter falls in love with a Palestinian and is killed, the company making the film said today.

 The film, described by Left Bank Picture head Andy Harries as more human interest than political, is expected to be shot in Jordan because the fighting between rival factions in Gaza.

 It is a very early development and Helens name is attached to it, a spokesman for the film company said. But there is no contract and only a very early script. But it is safe to say that if it does go ahead then Helen will be involved.

 The film is to be directed by Philip Martin.

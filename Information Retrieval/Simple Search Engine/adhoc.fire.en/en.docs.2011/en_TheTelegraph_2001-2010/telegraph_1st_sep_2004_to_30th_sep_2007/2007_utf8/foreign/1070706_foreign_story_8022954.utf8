 Cruise film funds

 Berlin, July 5 (Reuters): A German film fund today said it would grant subsidies worth 4.8 million euros ($6.5 million) for a controversial new film in which Tom Cruise plays a German hero executed for trying to kill Hitler.

 Despite a row about the films thwarted efforts to use a memorial site where the Nazis shot Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, the German federal film fund (DFFF), administered by the federal film board (FFA), has endorsed the subsidy.

 Yes, its been approved, said Christine Berg, DFFF project head at the FFA. The application was submitted, the criteria for the grant were fulfilled and the project was approved.

 The subsidies are available to any film as long as a Germany-based producer is involved and certain percentages of the costs fall in Germany.

 The grant, from a new 60-million-euro annual subsidy budget set up this year, exceeds the total cost of most German films.

 An official said the grant should allay fears that Germany is fundamentally opposed to Cruise playing Stauffenberg because of the actors membership of Scientology.

 The government regards Scientology as a cult masquerading as a religion to make money.

 Valkyrie named after the plots code name is due to begin filming at locations in Berlin on July 18. The film, to be directed by Bryan Singer, is due for release in 2008.

 China: Go easy on death term

 RICHARD HOLT

 Beijing, Sept. 14: China has issued an order urging judges to avoid executing criminals in all but the most extreme circumstances.

 The order follows reports of widespread wrongful convictions and criticism that lower courts arbitrarily impose the death penalty. It is the latest effort by Beijing to reform capital punishment in China, which is believed to legally kill more people than the rest of the world combined. 

 Judges have been ordered to use the death penalty more sparingly by showing leniency for murderers who co-operate with authorities and to non-violent, white-collar criminals. Capital punishment should only be given to an extremely small number of serious offenders, the supreme court said.

 Journalists under pressure

 New Delhi, March 17: The attack on Geo TV was not the first on journalists in Musharrafs Pakistan. Journalists are under pressure from both an increasingly nervous military regime and intolerant non-state actors. 

 The military regime is nervous because elections are around the corner and it is under pressure from the Americans who think enough is not being done to counter the Taliban. The former makes the Musharraf regime very sensitive to internal dissent. 

 Thus the troubled province of Baluchistan has become a no-go area for journalists. Reporting of opposition to the regimes attempt to control the judiciary infuriates it. 

 The pressure from Washington pushes the military regime to tightly control reporting from areas bordering Afghanistan, especially about the presence there of Afghan Taliban or Arab militants of al Qaida. 

 This is why the journalists under greatest threat are those in Baluchistan and in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). 

 The non-state actors are trying to push their own agenda. They come in various guises Afghan Taliban and Arab militants sheltering along the western borders of Pakistan, indigenous Taliban controlling North and South Waziristan and emerging fundamentalist Islamic groups elsewhere intent on changing the essentially moderate character of Pakistani society. They are all intolerant of critical reporting. 

 Together they have made it very difficult to be a journalist in Pakistan. In the last six months alone, four journalists were murdered, four were detained and tortured by state agencies and the teenage brothers of two journalists murdered. 

 The situation was no better in the preceding year. According to the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), between May 2005 and May 2006, three journalists were killed; four were detained and tortured by intelligence agencies; 65 arrested; five threatened; 19 publications, 32 TV channels and 16 websites banned; 13 newspaper presses raided; one FM radio station sealed; 12 journalists and media organisations slapped with court cases; 21 prevented from covering official events and seven newspapers denied government advertising. 

 Our rulers are not novices when it comes to the media. They have the experience of martial law since 1958. They no longer initiate legal cases against journalists. Instead, they just send a few people to threaten them in the street, to beat them up and even kidnap them for a few days. 

 Everyone knows what happened to Hayatullah, says I.A. Rehman, former journalist and now director of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. 

 Hayatullah Khan of AFP was found murdered on June 16, 2006, six months after his abduction. He was abducted near the tribal area of North Waziristan after reporting on an explosion that killed a senior al Qaida member. His reports contradicted the official version of the incident. 

 His younger brother Bashir Khan, a mere child, was murdered three months later, in an apparent message to the family not to expose the killers of Hayatullah. This pressure tactic was allegedly also used in the case of BBC Urdu Service correspondent Dilawar Khan Wazir. His 16-year-old brother Taimur Khan was murdered in South Waziristan. According to the PFUJ, the murder may have been a message to Dilawar who had been under threat for his reporting for the past two years. 

 Last November, unknown assailants in Islamabad killed Mohammad Ismail Malik of Pakistan Press International. Maqbool Hussain Siyal, a correspondent of the news agency On-line, was shot by unidentified attackers on September 15, 2006. Siyal was on his way to visit a local leader of the Opposition Pakistan Peoples Party. 

 Journalists are being kidnapped even for the kind of language they use in their reports. Suhail Qalandar, resident editor of Daily Express in Peshawar, was kidnapped and kept in shackles for 55-days. 

 I was told by government officials that when soldiers die fighting militants, we should describe them as martyrs. The militants told me to use the term martyr only for them. I used a neutral term halaq (killed) instead for both, Qalandar says while pondering over why he may have been kidnapped. 

 Kawish journalist Mehruddin Marri was abducted, tortured and released after four months. He was interrogated in a bid to make him confess ties with the Baluch national movement. 

 Saeed Sarbazi, joint secretary of Karachi Press Club was kidnapped on September 20, 2006, but released after two days. 

 Mukesh Rupeta, a Geo TV correspondent and Sanjay Kumar, a freelance cameraman, were kidnapped on March 6, 2006, but their official arrest shown only on June 26. They were apparently detained for filming the Jacobabad airbase in Sindh and later released on bail. 

 Senior journalist C.R. Shamsi was attacked by the security guards of a federal labour minister inside parliament for asking him when the wage board award for journalists would be implemented. The examples of manhandling and threatening journalists are many. 

 There is a perception, however, that things are not going to improve in the short run. The crunch on journalists is going to be harder because the government is nervous. 

 The military spokesman is on record saying media is our first line of defence, says Asma Jehangir, noted human rights activist and lawyer.

 Hillary using Bill as campaign weapon

 Washington, March 22: Hillary Clintons formidable campaign machine is cranking into a higher gear, grinding down opponents over Iraq and vacuuming up unprecedented amounts of money.

 The frontrunner for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination is working to turn one of her perceived weaknesses her support for the Iraq war to her advantage.

 She has confronted Barack Obama, her chief rival, over his claim to have opposed the Iraq war from the outset. When heckled about her stance, as she was at a fundraiser this week, she has succeeded in turning the tables on her critics.

 Hillary has avoided attacking Obama directly but her aides have distributed quotes suggesting uncertainty as to how he would have voted in 2002 had he been in the Senate with access to intelligence briefings. In one such statement, he said: quot;What would I have done? I dont know. What I know is that from my vantage point the case was not made.

 Hillary has been assailed at every step of the campaign over her failure to apologise for backing the war. Her new strategy is designed to blur the differences between her and Obama while emphasising her experience and temperament for the highest office in her refusal to be bounced into a new position by anti-war activists.

 At a Washington fundraiser on Tuesday night her speech was interrupted by a protester posing as reporter who shouted: What about Iraq? You dont care if our soldiers die.

 Hillart appeared prepared for the heckling, saying to rising applause from her audience: I understand the frustration about this administrations handling of Iraq. This President owes this country a plan to end our involvement in Iraq. And if he does not extricate us from Iraq before he leaves office, I will, as President.

 Hillarys event on Tuesday raised no less than $2.7million from guests who paid a minimum of $1,000 each for the privilege of eating buffet food.

 Significantly, for the second time this week she wheeled out the campaigns asset among Democrats her husband, Bill, who she said she would make ambassador of the world if she won in November next year. Some estimates suggest that by the end of the week, when the Clintons will have staged their third such dinner, they will have raised $10 million.

 The former President has also been quoted this week suggesting that Obamas record on Iraq had received insufficient scrutiny. On Tuesday, he hammered home the message that his wife was uniquely qualified to enter the White House in her own right.

 Long before she was in public office she was a public servant, he said. 

 Tonight (Thursday) I feel more strongly than I did 35 years ago, when I told her that out of all the people in our generation, shes still the best.

 Hillary responded in kind to her husband, saying: People ask me all the time: If you are elected will you make him secretary of state? Since President Kennedy and Robert Kennedy I think that is illegal but I sure will make him ambassador of the world because we have a lot of work to do.

 Pak student convicted 

 Houston, Jan. 31 (pti): A Pakistani student, one of four men accused of attempting to aid Taliban militants, has been convicted in a firearms case in the US.

 Shiraz Syed Qazi was yesterday found guilty of unlawful possession of a firearm in a 15-minute trial. Qazi had waived his right to a jury trial.

 A recently-established federal law makes it illegal for non-immigrant student visa holders like Qazi to possess firearms.

 Qazis three associates, Adnan Mirza, Kobie Williams and Syed Maaz Shah are accused of material support to terrorism by taking training to fight with the Taliban against US-led forces.

 The three were photographed holding and firing guns.

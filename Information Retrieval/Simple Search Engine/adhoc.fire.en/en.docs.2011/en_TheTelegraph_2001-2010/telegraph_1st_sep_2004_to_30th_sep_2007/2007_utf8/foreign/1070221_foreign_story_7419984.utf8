 Dead Lankans on display

 Riyadh, Feb. 20 (Reuters): Saudi Arabia has put the bodies of four Sri Lankans beheaded in Riyadh on display in public in an effort to deter a rising crime wave by foreigners, Saudi media reported today.

 The Sri Lankan gang were executed yesterday at a public square in a busy market district of Riyadh. Saudi media said that although no one was killed in the series of robberies they were convicted of, the four men were given the death sentence due to the organised nature of the violent hold-ups. Al-Riyadh newspaper said today the men were crucified as part of moves to deter other expatriates from crime.

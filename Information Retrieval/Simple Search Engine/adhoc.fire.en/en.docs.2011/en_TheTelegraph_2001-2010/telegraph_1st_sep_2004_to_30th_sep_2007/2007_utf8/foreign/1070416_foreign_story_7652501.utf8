 Bamiyan restoration to resume

 Bamiyan, Afghanistan, April 15 (Reuters): Snows are melting in central Afghanistan and roads to the town of Bamiyan have reopened after unseasonal rain and work on restoring the giant Buddha statues destroyed by the Taliban can resume.

 Piles of stone and rubble lie below two gaping niches in the red-brown cliff facing the town where the 6th-century statues had stood until the Taliban used dozens of explosive charges to bring them down in 2001, branding them un-Islamic.

 The larger, identified chunks of stone from the standing Buddhas have been stored or tied down under white tarpaulin, but thousands of fragments and rubble lie in the open.

 Its impossible to work here for at least six months of the year, says Bamiyan governor Habiba Sarabi. We hope work will resume by June.

 She says reconstruction of at least one of the statues, the larger one which stood 174 feet (52 metres) tall, will begin after a formal request from the federal government to Unesco.

 Reconstructed bits of the statue will be mixed with clay in a process called anastylosis and slowly pieced together and bonded back onto the cliff face.

 Its an immense task some of the chunks of stone weigh tonnes, a lot of the statue has been reduced to unidentifiable rubble, and experts are divided on whether reconstruction is feasible or even necessary.

 There are mines in the area, and a demining team has been clearing the site, but its work is still not complete, local officials say. Hundreds of poor people live in a honeycomb of caves on the cliffside, and preventing encroachment into the world heritage site is a key issue.

 In the past two years, work has focused on recovering pieces of the statue and shoring up the face of the cliff to prevent more collapses.

 Now, preliminary estimates of the cost to rebuild the larger statue are around $50 million, and its debatable whether that sum can be better used elsewhere in the war-ravaged and impoverished nation.

 And no plans have yet been made on what to do with the smaller of the demolished statues, which stood at 115 feet (35 metres).

 Nude soldier

 Manhart: Tough love

 San Antonio (Texas), Jan. 13 (AP): An air force sergeant who posed nude for Playboy magazine has been relieved of her duties while the military investigates, officials said.

 In the February issue, Michelle Manhart is photographed in uniform yelling and holding weapons under the headline Tough Love. The following pages show her partially clothed, wearing her dog tags while working out, as well as completely nude.

 This sergeants alleged action does not meet the high standards we expect of our airmen, Oscar Balladares, spokesman for Lackland Air Force Base, said.

 Dogs 6-yr trip

 St Louis, Jan. 28 (AP): Cujo was a frisky 7-year-old when he sneaked out of his owners St Louis yard in 2000. Now, thinner and grayer and with a tale that would be fascinating if only he could tell it, the golden retriever is back with the Barczewski family. 

 Six years and a trip to Columbia can do a lot to a dog, but it was unmistakably Cujo. There was the heart-shaped patch of white on his forehead, the white fur on his toes, his manner of greeting people. 

 After slipping away from home, Cujo ended up 120 miles in Columbia in the home of an elderly woman. He was later sent to a welfare group. A golden retriever rescue team brought him to St. Louis. 

 A week ago, Barczewskis relative visited the site looking for a dog to adopt and saw the picture of the old dog with the white heart mark and white feet. He recognised him soon and the reunion followed. 

 Lingerie law 

 Kuwait City (AFP): Kuwait has banned men from working in shops selling lingerie.

 The decision gave businesses until April 7 to implement the ban or face a fine of up to $700 for each violating worker. It said that special inspectors from the government would enforce the ban.

 The government also asked its labour departments to stop recruiting male migrant labourers for jobs in womens lingerie shops. 

 Church porn 

 Ontario (AP): Its not your typical church breakfast. An event billed as Porn and Pancakes is being hosted by a church in rural New York. 

 The breakfast discussion on the pornography industry in America is planned next month at the Living Word Assembly of God Church in Ontario. A billboard near the church shows the words written in syrup on a stack of flapjacks.

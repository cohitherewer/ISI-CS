 Cherie supports judge

 London, March 16 (AFP): A group of English lawyers, including Prime Minister Tony Blairs wife Cherie Booth, criticised the suspension of Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary by President Pervez Musharraf.

 The reports of the humiliating treatment of the chief justice of Pakistan is causing great international unease, and is not in the interest of the government of Pakistan, and lowers the international esteem of Pakistan, the lawyers said yesterday.

 We wish to show our solidarity for our professional colleagues in Pakistan, who are at the forefront of upholding the constitution and the rights of the people of Pakistan, whose welfare and security are under threat, they added.

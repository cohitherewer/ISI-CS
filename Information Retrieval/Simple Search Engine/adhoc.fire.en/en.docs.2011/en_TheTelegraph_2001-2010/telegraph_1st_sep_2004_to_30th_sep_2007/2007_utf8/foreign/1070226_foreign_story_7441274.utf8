 Barking ban

 Clifton, New Jersey, Feb. 25 (AP): The city of Clifton is not going to the dogs. At least not if the city council has anything to do about it. Later this month, the council is expected to introduce an ordinance setting a limit on how long dogs can bark. 

 Noisy canines will be defined as those that bark for more than 30 minutes on two consecutive days. 

 The city already has nuisance and noise laws that can be used to address annoying and disturbing noises such as constant barking. 

 The health department sent 11 letters last year warning that a summons could be issued if the barking continued. Clifton has issued 3,756 dog licenses this year. 

 No-sex life

 Hong Kong (Reuters): A 107-year-old Hong Kong villager, who still enjoys an occasional smoke, has attributed his longevity in part to decades of sexual abstinence. 

 I dont know why I have lived this long, said Chan Chi one of Hong Kongs oldest people. Maybe, it has to do with the fact that I have lived a sex-less life for many years since I was 30. 

 But the centenarian, whos had no difficulty living a monastic existence for nearly 80 years, admits the pleasures of tobacco have been harder to resist.

 Bush says he is flexible but with a thick hide

 Washington, Jan. 15 (Reuters): President George W. Bush says he is flexible and open-minded, rather than stubborn, but with a thick hide to absorb criticism.

 In an interview with CBSs 60 Minutes conducted last week, Bush also denied his spirits had suffered because the Iraq war had not gone as well as hoped. Quite the contrary, he said, according to a transcript of the interview airing yesterday. My spirits are strong.

 I really am not the kind of guy that sits here and says: Oh, gosh, Im worried about my legacy. Im more worried about making the right decisions to protect the United States of America, he said. I understand criticism. But Ive got a pretty thick hide.

 Bush was asked if he agreed with a perception that he was stubborn. I think Im a flexible, open-minded person. I really do. I really do, he said.

 Bush said he spent a lot of time listening to people about Iraq policy. His new strategy to send 21,500 additional troops to Iraq has met a wall of opposition from Democrats who now control Congress, as well as disagreement from some Republicans. I fully understand the decisions I make could affect the life of some kid who wears the uniform, Bush said. 

 Or could affect the life of some child growing up in America 20 years from now.

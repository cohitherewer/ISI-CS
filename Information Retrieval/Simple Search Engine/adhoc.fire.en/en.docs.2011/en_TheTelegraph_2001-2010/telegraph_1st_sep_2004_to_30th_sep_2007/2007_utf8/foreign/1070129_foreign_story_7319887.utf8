 Honours case finger at Blair

 London, Jan. 28: Detectives have discovered a hand-written note from Tony Blair among new evidence that has widened significantly the cash-for-honours investigation. 

 It is the first time that the paper trail uncovered by Scotland Yard has led directly to the Prime Minister. The note is understood to acknowledge the efforts of Labours 12 secret lenders who provided 14 million to help the party fight the 2005 election. 

 The Prime Ministerss comments were among a batch of Downing Street papers obtained by detectives. He had written in ink on typed, internal government papers and initialled his views. 

 Officers now believe that Downing Street intended to give working peerages to most of the lenders. Those in line included Sir Christopher Evans, the multi-millionaire entrepreneur, who is the only lender arrested as part of the 10-month inquiry. 

 The disclosures are deeply embarrassing for Blair, whose problems escalated when Ruth Turner, one of his closest aides, was arrested nine days ago. Labour officials and the lenders deny acting illegally, although the loans were so secret that not even Jack Dromey, the party treasurer, knew about them. 

 Until now, it was believed that only four of the 12 lenders had been in line for peerages. But detectives are convinced that at one point the Prime Minister intended to put forward Sir Christopher, along with among others Sir Gulam Noon, Sir David Garrard, Dr Chai Patel and Barry Townsley. 

 Senior sources said, however, that Blair was advised against this. Detectives believe this may have been linked to Merlin Biosciences, one of Sir Christophers companies, being the subject of a Serious Fraud Office inquiry. 

 Scotland Yard also suspects that Blair was reined back from recommending more than four peerages at the same time because party officials believed it was prudent to stagger them in case as happened the loans became public knowledge. 

 Elfyn Llwyd, the Plaid Cymru leader and one of two MPs whose complaints sparked the police investigation, said: This shows that the Prime Minister has many questions still to answer. I remain absolutely convinced that police will need to interview Tony Blair again. 

 Blairs recommendations of peerages for the four lenders went to the House of Lords Appointment Commission in 2005 and were blocked. 

 Some of the 12 secret lenders were not eligible for a peerage: Lord Sainsbury, who lent 2 million, had been created a life peer in 1997. Blair also personally opposed giving a peerage to one of the lenders, sources said. 

 Detectives are preparing a dossier that seeks to prove criminal intent: that at least some of the loans were linked directly to the promise of a peerage. Senior ministers privately acknowledge that the affair is one of the main reasons for the erosion of Blairs political power.

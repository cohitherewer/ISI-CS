 How Jackal preyed on cow 

 TONY PATTERSON

 The Jackal in the 1970s

 Berlin, Sept. 2: The first wife of Carlos the Jackal has lifted the lid on their tempestuous relationship, claiming she was unable to resist him despite his notoriety and the danger that came with it.

 Magdalena Kopp spent 13 years as the lover and wife of one of the worlds then most wanted terrorists. Although he landed her in jail and nicknamed her the cow, she returned to him after her release from prison and even bore him a child.

 Now the 59-year-old German photographer has published her account of her life with Illich Ramirez Sanchez, the real name of the Venezuelan-born Leftist.

 A Marxist-Leninist revolutionary turned professional killer, Sanchez claimed responsibility for the deaths of more than 1,500 people in the cause of Palestinian liberation before he was jailed for life in Paris in 1997, for killing two police officers and an informant.

 Kopps book, The Terror Years, is a detailed account of Kopps times with the beguiling, seductive and fanatically violent Sanchez.

 The daughter of a postman and a waitress from the southern town of Ulm, Kopp, like many of her generation, fled the provinces for cities abroad in the early Seventies in an attempt to escape a Germany held to be still tarnished by the Nazi era. 

 As a young and militant Left-wing photographer, she met Sanchez while helping to install a darkroom in the London offices of the Peoples Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). 

 She recalled how she had thought that Sanchez, with his round, baby face, parted short hair and suit and tie, looked like a creepy conformist, and claimed she found his initial sexual advances repellent.

 Yet a year later, in 1976, she joined a group of German pro-Palestinian Left-wing activists on a trip to a PFLP camp in southern Yemen, where Sanchez was their host.

 Their relationship developed in earnest two years later when she flew to Baghdad to join Sanchez, who was living as a guest of the Iraqi secret service.

 I fell under Carloss spell and became totally dependent on him, Kopp told The Sunday Telegraph from her home in Ulm last week. When you are alone with someone like that, you get seduced and simply obey. He had a way of making women feel they were the other half of the coming revolution.

 By that stage Sanchez was already being called the Jackal by the international media for his cold-blooded assassination of four French secret policemen in a Paris flat. Yet Kopp said she was unable to resist his advances.

 Carlos simply took me. He laid his pistol next to me on the bedside table and slept with me. It was a sexual act without any emotion, practically a rape. It was always like that. They moved between places of sanctuary throughout West Asia and communist eastern Europe. His pet name for her was the cow.

 She said: Once he bought me a birthday cake with For my cow written in icing on the top. Now I would throw something like that in his face, but then I said nothing.

 In 1982 Kopp was arrested in France and jailed for four years after taking part in an attempted bomb attack. Sanchez launched his own terror campaign to secure her release. Twenty people were killed in eight attacks in Europe and West Asia, but the French government would not give in.

 Almost as soon as her sentence had been served, Kopp rejoined her lover, partially out of fear, she claimed. 

 He rang me up one night and that was it. I went to him in Damascus. He would have come and taken me if I hadnt, she said.

 In Syria, Kopp renounced terrorism and the couple married. She gave birth to their daughter, Rosa, in 1986.

 By that time, Sanchez was making a living by dealing in stolen limousines. The couple were expelled from Syria at the end of the Eighties and with the collapse of communism, their backing in eastern Europe withered.

 Kopp fled with her daughter to Venezuela where she lived briefly with Sanchezs family. He was arrested in Sudan in 1994 and extradited to France. Kopp has not seen him since.

 The terrorist, jailed for life in 1997, divorced her and married his French lawyer.

 Kopp returned to Ulm in 1995, where she now helps immigrant children with learning difficulties. Her daughter has just turned 21.

 Sanchez, now 57, sent her a birthday card from prison.

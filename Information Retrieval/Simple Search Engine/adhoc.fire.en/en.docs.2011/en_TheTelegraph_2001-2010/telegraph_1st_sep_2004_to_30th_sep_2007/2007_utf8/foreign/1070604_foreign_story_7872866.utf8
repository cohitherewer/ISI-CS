 Tentacles of terror, in US backyard

 Washington, June 3: Even if terrorism suspect Russell Defreitas were no more than an angry man with vague notions of a spectacular attack, he was able to tap into a network of Islamic extremists in the Caribbean potentially dangerous and right in the backyard of the US, authorities said yesterday.

 It was Defreitass alleged ties to that network, based primarily in Trinidad and Guyana, that had the FBI and other federal authorities so concerned as they clandestinely monitored his activities over the last 18 months, law enforcement officials familiar with the ongoing investigation said.

 The FBI also believes that at least several militants from this loosely configured extremist network were involved in the alleged plot to blow up buildings, fuel tanks and pipelines at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. They remain at large and are extremely dangerous, said a federal law enforcement official.

 That is what is most significant about this case. It demonstrates the evolving nature of the threat and how we need to be looking at areas of the world that have not been viewed by the general public as a terror threat, the official said. It shows that the threat can come from anywhere. It is not just limited to the Middle East or South Asia.

 At a news conference to announce the arrest of Defreitas and two other suspects, New York City police commissioner Raymond W. Kelly agreed. This is an area in which we have growing concern, and that I think requires a lot more focus, he said.

 Guyana is in South America, and Trinidad is nearby in the Caribbean.

 Authorities said yesterday that Defreitas and several suspected associates from Guyana and Trinidad were never close to obtaining explosives or taking any concrete steps to make their plot a reality.

 But they said some of the men whom Defreitas linked up with were militants or associates of militants. At least two were alleged to be longtime associates of Trinidad-based radical group Jamaat al Muslimeen.

 The FBI and CIA have closely monitored the group since at least 1990, when it tried to overthrow the government of Trinidad and Tobago and replace it with one based on Islamic law.

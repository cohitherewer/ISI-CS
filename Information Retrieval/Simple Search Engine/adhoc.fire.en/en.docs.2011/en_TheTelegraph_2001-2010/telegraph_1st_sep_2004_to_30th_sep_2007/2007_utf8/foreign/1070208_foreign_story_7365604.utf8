 New emphasis at Harvard

 Boston, Feb. 7 (Reuters): Harvard University announced today its biggest curriculum overhaul in three decades, putting new emphasis on sensitive religious and cultural issues, the sciences and overcoming US parochialism.

 The curriculum at the oldest US university has been criticised as focusing too narrowly on academic topics instead of real-life issues, or for being antagonistic to organised religion. Efforts to revise it have been in the works for three years.

 One of the eight new required subject areas societies of the world aims to help students overcome US parochialism by acquainting them with the values, customs and institutions that differ from their own, said a 34-page Harvard report on the changes.

 An earlier proposal would have made Harvard unique among its elite Ivy League peers by requiring undergraduates to study religion as a distinct subject, but that was dropped in December.

 The changes to the general-education requirements, imposed on students outside their major, still address religious beliefs and practices. Study of those issues, however, would be folded into a broader subject of culture and belief.

 The culture and belief requirement will introduce students to ideas, art and religion in the context of the social, political, religious, economic and cross-cultural conditions that shape them, Harvard said. Harvard has been criticised by some conservatives in recent decades as a liberal bastion unfriendly toward religion.

 A task force of six professors and two students which drafted the new curriculum said religion should be addressed, but only as one of several cultural influences.

 Harvard is a secular institution but religion is an important part of our students lives, it said. 

 It noted that 94 per cent of Harvards incoming students report that they discuss religion frequently or occasionally.

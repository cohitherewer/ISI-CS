 Indian on Booker shortlist

 Indra Sinha

 London, Sept. 6 (PTI): Mumbai-born Indian novelist Indra Sinha is among six authors who have been shortlisted for this years 50,000 Man Booker Prize for his fictionalised story of a victim of the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster.

 Last year, Kiran Desai won the Booker prize for her novel The Inheritance of Loss.

 Howard Daves, chairman of the jury, said Pakistan writer Mohsin Hamids novel The Reluctant Fundamentalist has also been shortlisted for the prize. The other four writers in the race are Ian McEwan (On Chesil Beach), Lloyd Jones (Mister Pip), Nicola Barker (Darkmans) and Anne Enright (The Gathering). The winner will be named on October 16. 

 Animals People is Indra Sinhas second novel. The first was, The Death of Mr Love, which was published in September 2002.

 Sinha said Animals People is dedicated to his friend and Bhopal gas victim Sunil Kumar who died in July 2006, aged 34. Some of the stories Sunil told Sinha about his life found their way into the novel. However, the characters of Animal are entirely fictional, as are their antics, the author said.

 Sunils whole life was shaped and blighted by what Bhopalis still refer to simply as that night when methyl isocyanate gas leaked from the Union Carbide factory, killing nearly 3,000 people and ultimately causing at least 15,000 to 22,000 total deaths.

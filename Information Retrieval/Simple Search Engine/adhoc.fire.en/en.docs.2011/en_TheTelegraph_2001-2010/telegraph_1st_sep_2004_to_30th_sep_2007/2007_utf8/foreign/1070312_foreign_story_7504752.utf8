 Double bedroom bug bites couples

 TRACIE ROZHON

 No more cosy twosomes 

 New York, March 11: Not since the Victorian age of starched sheets and starchy manners, builders and architects say, have there been so many orders for separate bedrooms. Or separate sleeping nooks. Or his-and-her wings.

 In interviews, couples and sociologists say that often it has nothing to do with sex. More likely, it has to do with snoring. Or with children crying. Or with getting up and heading for the gym at 5.30 in the morning. Or with sending email messages until well after midnight.

 In a survey in February by the National Association of Home Builders, builders and architects predicted that more than 60 per cent of custom houses would have dual master bedrooms by 2015, according to Gopal Ahluwalia, staff vice-president of research at the builders association. Some builders say more than a quarter of their new projects already do.

 What could be called the home-sleeping-alone syndrome is not limited to the wealthy. For middle-income homeowners, it may be a matter of moving into a spare bedroom, the recreation room or the den. In St Louis, Lana Pepper, a light sleeper who battled for years with her husbands nocturnal restlessness, reconfigured the condominium they bought recently, adding walls to create separate bedrooms. Lana said the advantage to separate rooms was obvious: My husband is still alive. I would have killed him.

 It was more than snoring, she said, recounting the bad old days of a shared bed. He cannot have his feet tucked into any of the covers; I have to have them tucked in. So I took all the linens and split them with scissors. Then I finished the edge so that half of the sheet would tuck under and the other half he could kick out.

 That did not help his snoring, so she bought a white noise machine; she even went to a shooting range to buy a pair of those big ear guards they wear. 

 According to the National Sleep Foundation in Washington, 75 per cent of adults frequently either wake in the night or snore and many have taken to separate beds just for those reasons. In a report issued Tuesday, the foundation found that more than half the women surveyed, ages 18 to 64, said they slept well only a few nights a week; 43 per cent believed their lack of sleep interfered with the next days activities.

 Stephanie Coontz, director of public education for the Council of Contemporary Families in Chicago, said many couples she interviewed were confident enough that they have a nice marriage, but they dont particularly like sleeping in the same room.

 I dont think it says anything about their sex lives, Coontz said.

 Lana, 60, who co-founded St Louiss annual Shakespeare festival, takes her sleeping seriously. On her nightstand is an arsenal of remote controls: for the adjustable bed, the television, the lights, the humidifier and the DVD player. Her mattress is made from a foam developed by Nasa that rests in a four-poster frame under a skylight.

 At Escala, a condominium project in Seattle, a quarter of the 270 units have double master bedrooms, said John Midby, a partner in the development. In St Louis County, Dennis Hayden, president of Hayden Homes, said that each of the 30 detached homes in his latest planned community would have two separate-but-equal bedroom suites.

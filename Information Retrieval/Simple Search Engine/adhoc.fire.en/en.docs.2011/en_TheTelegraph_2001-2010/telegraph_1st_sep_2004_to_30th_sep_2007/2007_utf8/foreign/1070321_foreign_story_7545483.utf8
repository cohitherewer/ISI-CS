 Marquez mobbed

 Cartagena (Colombia), March 20 (AP): He had disappointed the previous day by failing to show up for a panel discussion on narrative journalism, of which he is an unquestionable master.

 But publicity-shy Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who turned 80 this month, did finally appear yesterday at the semi-annual meeting of the Inter American Press Association as it ended with a luncheon. He seemed to wish he had not. He was mobbed.

 The Nobel literature laureate, whose Hundred Years of Solitude is being lauded these days as the best novel in the Spanish language since Cervantes wrote Don Quijote 400 years ago, is a national icon in his native Colombia. 

 Dozens jostled with two police officers standing guard to have their pictures taken with the literary celebrity, known endearingly as Gabo, and to have books autographed. One woman tried to get him to autograph a notepad. He refused. Garcia Marquez has in recent years shunned interviews assiduously even with journalists he knows well.

 One young radio reporter tried anyway. How about a few words for Cararcol radio, he said. If I give an interview to you I have to give an interview to everyone, said Marquez.

 Noting how crushed the reporter looked, the ageing writer softened. I love you, young man, he said. 

 Garcia Marquez is being feted in Cartagena, his second home after Mexico City, at the Fourth International Congress of the Spanish Language that begins this week. He was also celebrated effusively across Latin America for his birthday. This year also marks the 40th anniversary of the publication of One Hundred Years of Solitude and 25 years since he won the Nobel.

 Garcia Marquez arrived just as the richest man in the world, Bill Gates, was departing the IAPA meeting. He clearly wished he had the security detail afforded the Microsoft chairman to fend off the overzealous admirers. The mustachioed writer shuffled slowly to a friends waiting car after lunch, looking exhausted. He threw up his hands before he got into the auto and left. I cant take any more of this. Im going to Mexico. Im going to Mexico, he said.

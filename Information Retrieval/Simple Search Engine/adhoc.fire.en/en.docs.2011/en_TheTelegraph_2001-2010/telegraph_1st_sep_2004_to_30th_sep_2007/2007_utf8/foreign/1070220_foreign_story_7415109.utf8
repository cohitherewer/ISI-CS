 Fiennes sack for Aussie air hostess 

 Ralph Fiennes

 Sydney, Feb. 19 (AFP): Australias national airline today said it had sacked an air hostess for having mile-high sex with Hollywood heartthrob Ralph Fiennes in a business-class toilet.

 The move came a day after the flight attendants lurid confession of a 10 out of 10 romp with the star on a flight between Australia and India appeared in British media.

 Qantas airways announced today that flight attendant Lisa Robertsons employment contract to operate on Qantas aircraft had been terminated, the airline said in a one-line statement.

 Robertson, 38, told Britains Sunday Mirror there was instant chemistry between her and Fiennes, and that after having sex in the toilet they made love several times in Fienness Mumbai hotel room.

 Ralph Fiennes is gorgeous and the chemistry between us was amazing. What woman wouldnt want to have sex with him? He was the best lover Ive ever had a 10 out of 10, she said.

 Robertson said Fiennes began kissing her in the curtained area of the plane where she was taking her break, and as the pair became more passionate, she led him to the toilet cubicle.

 I thought if I was going to get the sack, it would be worth it, she said. I knew everything was against the rules and wrong but I didnt care. I was going for it.

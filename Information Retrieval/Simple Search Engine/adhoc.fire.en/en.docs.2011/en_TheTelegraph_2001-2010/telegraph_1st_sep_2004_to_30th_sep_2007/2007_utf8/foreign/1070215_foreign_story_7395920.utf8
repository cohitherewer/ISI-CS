 US: Sadr in Iran

 Washington, Feb. 14 (Reuters): The US military believes radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, one of Iraqs most powerful figures, has left the country and is now in Iran, two senior American officials said yesterday.

 Sadrs departure was first reported by the ABC News network which said he had fled to Iran because of fears that he might be targeted by US bombs and worries over his safety because of a fracturing within his organisation.

 The US officials spoke to Reuters about the report on condition of anonymity.

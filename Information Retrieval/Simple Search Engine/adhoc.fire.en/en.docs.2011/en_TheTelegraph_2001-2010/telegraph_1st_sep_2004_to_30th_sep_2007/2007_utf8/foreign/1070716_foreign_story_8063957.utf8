 Korea nuclear offer

 Seoul, July 15 (AP): North Korea is ready to start disabling its nuclear programmes following the shutdown of its sole operating reactor, a North Korean diplomat said today, as long as Washington lifts all sanctions against the communist nation.

 Kim Myong Gil, minister at North Koreas mission to the UN in New York, confirmed the reactor was shut down yesterday after receipt of a South Korean oil shipment, and said UN inspectors would today verify the closure.

 Immediately after the arrival of the first heavy fuel oil, the facilities were shut down and the (International Atomic Energy Agency) personnel will verify that, Kim said.

 IAEA inspectors were expelled from North Korea in late 2002. A 10-member team arrived yesterday in North Korea to make sure the reactor at Yongbyon, about 100km north of the capital, was switched off the first step by the North to scale back its weapons programme since the standoff began.

 Kim also raised hope for further progress on disarmament and noted the next steps included Korea making a declaration of its nuclear programme and disabling the facilities.

 But he said those moves would only come if Washington takes actions in parallel, including removing wider economic sanctions against Pyongyang and striking the country from a list of states that sponsor terrorism.

 In Washington, White House national security adviser Stephen Hadley said it appeared Yongbyon, which produces weapons-grade plutonium, had been shut down.

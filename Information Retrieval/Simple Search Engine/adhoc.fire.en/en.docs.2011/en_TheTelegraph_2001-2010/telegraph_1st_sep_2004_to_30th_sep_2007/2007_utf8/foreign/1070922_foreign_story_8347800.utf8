 Mandela alive, despite Bush gaffe

 Insensitive

 Johannesburg, Sept. 21 (Reuters): Nelson Mandela is still very much alive despite an embarrassing gaffe by President George W. Bush, who alluded to the former South African leaders death in an attempt to explain sectarian violence in Iraq.

 Its out there. All we can do is reassure people, especially South Africans, that President Mandela is alive, Achmat Dangor, chief executive officer of the Nelson Mandela Foundation, said as Bushs comments received worldwide coverage.

 In a speech defending his administrations Iraq policy, Bush said former Iraqi President Saddam Husseins brutality had made it impossible for a unifying leader to emerge and stop the sectarian violence that has engulfed the West Asian nation.

 I heard somebody say: Wheres Mandela? Well, Mandelas dead because Saddam Hussein killed all the Mandelas, Bush said in a news conference in Washington yesterday.

 Jailed for 27 years for fighting white minority rule, Mandela became South Africas first black president in 1994. He won a Nobel Peace Prize for preaching racial harmony. References to his death Mandela is now 89 and increasingly frail are seen as insensitive in South Africa.

 Wedding signoff

 Budapest, March 25 (Reuters): Hungarys Catholic military bishop has resigned because he wants to marry a woman he met in the churchs renewal movement, it was reported on Friday.

 Brigadier General Tamas Szabo, 50, has been preaching to Catholic soldiers, border guards and their families since 2001.

 The Roman Catholic Church insists priests remain celibate and has ruled out letting them marry.

 The Hungarian Catholic Church said on its website that Pope Benedict had accepted Szabos resignation. 

 Los Angeles (AP): Two freelance photographers are suing Denise Richards and Pamela Anderson, alleging that Richards physically and verbally assaulted them when they tried to take her picture and that she and Anderson lied to authorities, media and others about the confrontation.

 Iraq panic after worst bombings

 Kahtaniya, Iraq, Aug. 16 (Reuters): Angry members of a minority sect today said they feared annihilation and pleaded for help, after suicide attackers killed scores in possibly the worst such bomb attack of the Iraq conflict.

 Frail clay houses in the centre of Kahtaniya, one of two villages struck on Tuesday by garbage trucks packed with explosives, were flattened for several blocks.

 Chunks of concrete and twisted aluminium lay in the street beside the destroyed homes of hundreds of Yazidis, a minority sect regarded by Sunni militants as infidels. Estimates of the death toll varied from 175 to 500.

 Their aim is to annihilate us, to create trouble and kill all the Yazidis because we are not Muslims, said an elderly man in Kahtaniya. He told deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih that 51 members of his extended family had been killed.

 Papers marry off Moss

 London, Jan. 2 (AP): A spokesman for Kate Moss denied that the model had wed rocker boyfriend Pete Doherty, following reports that the couple had tied the knot during a candle-lit Buddhist ceremony in Thailand.

 Spokesman Stuart Higgins said today that Moss was in Thailand on holiday but had not married Doherty. British newspapers reported that Moss and the Babyshambles frontman held the ceremony on New Years day in the Thai resort of Phuket. 

 Neither the Sun nor the Daily Mirror provided sources for the information. The Mirror quoted an unnamed friend of Moss as saying the ceremony was an expression of the couples mutual devotion.

 Higgins called the reports entirely false. There has not been any kind of marriage ceremony in Thailand. She is on holiday Higgins said.

 The couple were reported by British media to be staying at one of the islands luxury resorts but hoteliers were discreet about the matter.

 A spokeswoman for the Amanpuri hotel, contacted by phone from Bangkok, denied the couple were staying there and said she had no knowledge of their whereabouts.

 At the Trisara, a high-end resort and spa that opened in 2004, the general manager, Anthony Lark, said: We dont talk about any of our guests. Thats just something we dont do. We have a very simple policy of protecting our guests. He said prices at the resort started at $1,000 a day and went as high as $6,000 for a five-bedroom villa.

 Pak frees Qaida expert

 Islamabad, Aug. 20 (AP): A Pakistani accused of using his computer skills to help al Qaida has been released after three years in custody, a government official and the mans lawyer said today.

 Pakistani officials have said that information from freed suspect Mohammed Naeem Noor Khan quickly led them to a Tanzanian wanted for his alleged role in the 1998 bombings of US embassies in East Africa, which killed more than 200 people.

 Khan, who was captured in Lahore in July 2004, has also been linked with terror plots in the US and Britain.

 Deputy attorney general Naheeda Mehboob Ilahi said in the supreme court today that Khan, believed to be in his late 20s, had been released and had returned to his home in Karachi. Ilahi provided no details.

 The court has been pressing the government for information on dozens of people whose relatives say they were picked up and held incognito by Pakistani intelligence agents for alleged links to militants.

 Khans lawyer, Babar Awan, confirmed that his client had returned to his family but said he had not been able to speak to his client to ask where he had been held, and by whom. Awan said Khan had never been charged with any crime or brought before any court.

 Khan, an engineering graduate, was suspected of being a point man who sent coded emails to al Qaida operatives possibly planning attacks in the US, Britain and South Africa.

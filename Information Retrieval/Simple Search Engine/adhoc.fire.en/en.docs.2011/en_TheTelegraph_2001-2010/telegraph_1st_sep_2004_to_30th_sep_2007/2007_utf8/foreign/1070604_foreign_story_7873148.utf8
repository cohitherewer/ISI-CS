 Nutty Viagra

 Kuala Lumpur, June 3 (AFP): Malaysian researchers claim to have created a nutty alternative to Viagra based on walnuts, a newspaper report said today.

 I read articles about the Romans and French having eaten walnuts for this purpose.... If it had been documented that long ago, then there surely has to be something there, Kim Kah Hwi, who headed the team of researchers, told The Star newspaper.

 Hot dogs

 Phoenix, Arizona (AP): An American broke 

 the world record for hot dog eating at a contest here, smashing 

 the record held by a Japanese. Joe Chestnut of San Jose, 

 California, broke Takeru Kobayashis record by downing 

 59 1/2 hot dogs at Arizona Mills Mall. Kobayashis 

 record stood at 53 3/4 hot dogs. 

 Lavish fair

 Shanghai (Reuters): Fancy a diamond-encrusted 

 cellphone for $3.5 million, or a gold-plated, musical Swiss 

 watch costing more than $2 million? Those luxuries, and 

 thousands like them, were on display at a weekend Millionaire 

 Fair in Shanghai.

 Stars on sex toys

 Berlin, May 14 (Reuters): German sex shop chain Beate Uhse must pay German soccer stars Michael Ballack and Oliver Kahn 50,000 euros ($67,380) each for using their names for vibrators without permission, the company said today.

 The company had marketed the sex toys, dubbed Michael B. andOlli K., before Germany hosted the World Cup in 2006. Although the surnames of the two German soccer stars were not used, it was clear they referred to Chelsea midfielder Michael Ballack and Bayern Munich goalkeeper Oliver Kahn.

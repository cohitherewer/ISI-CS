 17 hurt in Pak blast

 Peshawar, Sept. 8 (AP): A car bomb exploded in the parking lot of a military-owned bank in northwestern Pakistan today, wounding 17 people, police said.

 The attack took place outside the Askari Bank in Peshawar, the capital of North West Frontier Province bordering Afghanistan. 

 Ijaz Khan, an area police chief, said all 17 wounded were hospitalised and in a stable condition. The explosion damaged several vehicles and smashed office windows.

 TV footage showed soldiers guarding the scene of the blast and officers inspecting several scorched cars. The latest attack came days after two suicide bombers struck targets near the capital, Islamabad.

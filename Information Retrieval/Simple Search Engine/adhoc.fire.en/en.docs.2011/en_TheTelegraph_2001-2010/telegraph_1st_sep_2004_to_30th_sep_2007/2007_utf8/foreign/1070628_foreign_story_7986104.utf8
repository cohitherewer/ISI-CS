 Bigger than a poodle: Bush

 Background noise

 London,

 June 27 (AP): Tony Blair was no poodle, President George W. Bush said in a newspaper interview published today.

 Bush said that he and the outgoing British Prime Minister had worked together to achieve world peace and told The Sun that the accusations levelled against Blair were nothing more than background noise.

 Ive heard hes been called Bushs poodle, The Sun quoted Bush as saying. Hes bigger than that. This is just background noise, a distraction from big things.

 Bush said history would be kind to Blair, and that whatever the public perception, the two dealt with each other on an equal footing. Somehow our relationship has been seen as Bush saying to Blair jump and Blair saying how high? but thats just not the way it works, Bush said. Its a relationship where we say were both going to jump together.

 The often tongue-tied President also expressed admiration for Blairs rhetorical skills, saying he envied the former Prime Ministers eloquence.

 Tonys great skill, and I wish I had it, is that hes very articulate, Bush said. I wish I was a better speaker. This guy can really ... he can talk. Bush said he so admired the Prime Minister he had asked Blair to stay on through 2008 the end Bushs term but added that he got along well with Blairs successor, Gordon Brown.

 Gordon came (to Washington) and he wasnt the image of the dour Scotsman at all, Bush said. He was relaxed. It was a good meeting.

 The Sun said the interview took place on May 16. It was part of a collection of interviews about Blair published to mark the Prime Ministers departure from office after 10 years in power.

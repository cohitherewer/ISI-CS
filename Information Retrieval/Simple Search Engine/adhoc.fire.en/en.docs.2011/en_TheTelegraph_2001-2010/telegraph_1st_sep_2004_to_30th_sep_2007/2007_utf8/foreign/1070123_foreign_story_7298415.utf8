 Bobby Jindal in governor race again

 Jindal: History beckons

 Baton Rouge (Louisiana), Jan. 22 (AP): US Representative Bobby Jindal, who lost his bid for governor in 2003, told supporters today that he would seek the job again in this years election in a bid to make history by becoming the first US governor with roots in India.

 The 35-year-old Republican congressman will try to unseat Democratic Governor Kathleen Blanco, who has said she is running for re-election. Blanco defeated Jindal in 2003, but she has faced criticism about her leadership abilities.

 Our state, our communities, and our families have been through some very tough times. There is clearly a hunger for a new approach to governing, Jindal said in an email to his supporters announcing his intentions.

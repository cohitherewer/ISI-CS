 China citizens in rare victory

 Beijing, May 30 (Reuters): Chinese citizens alarmed about pollution won a rare victory today when a city froze a chemical project after angry residents joined in opposition through a flood of mobile phone text messages.

 Xiamen, a port city of about 1.5 million people centred on an island in eastern Chinas Fujian province, announced it was halting construction of a plant to make paraxylene (PX), a petrochemical that goes into polyester and fabrics, the official Xinhua news agency reported.

 Angry locals had denounced the project as an atomic bomb threatening the seaside environment, the report said, adding they claimed to have circulated nearly a million mobile phone text messages urging friends to protest the plant.

 When this massive toxic chemical product goes into production, that will mean an atomic bomb has been released over all Xiamen island, said one version of the text message quoted by the Southern Metropolitan Daily.

 We want to live, we want our health! The message urged residents to join a street protest, Chinese media reported. For the sake of future generations, pass this message on to all your Xiamen friends!

 As recently as yesterday, Chinese media quoted Xiamen officials as vowing the project would go forward despite the outcry. The abrupt reversal reflected a potent cocktail of public worry about pollution, modern communications, and increasingly assertive citizens, said Zhong Xiaoyong, a freelance writer in Xiamen who opposed the plant.

 Its a step forward that shows they have to listen to peoples worries about the environment, not just in Xiamen but across the country, Zhong said by phone. Now nobody feels that they can avoid the effects on water, air, soil; and public awareness is growing that this is everybodys concern, not someone elses.

 Chinas leaders have promised to clean up skies and water degraded by decades of unchecked growth, and environmental agencies are increasingly vocal about officials who push industrial projects without assessing the impact.

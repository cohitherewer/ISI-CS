 Till the end, Saddam had hoped for freedom

 DAMIEN MCELROY

 London, Jan. 8: Saddam Hussein finally accepted his fate only two hours before his death, it emerged yesterday. 

 Locks on his jail door at Camp Cropper detention facility near Baghdad airport slid open and guards entered to take the former dictator to a waiting helicopter. It was 3:55 am. 

 Saddam looked up to accept for the first time that he was a condemned man facing death at the hands of his enemies. Members of Task Force 134, the US military unit guarding Saddam, revealed he had heard rumours of his impending execution on the radio. 

 A statement from the group said, however, he remained confident of a reprieve until his cell door opened: He immediately indicated that he knew the execution would soon follow. 

 Despite receiving a death sentence for the murder of 148 Shia villagers, Saddam believed Washington would spare him to help negotiate with insurgents to end the war. 

 According to an American account published yesterday, the ex-tyrant remained courteous while in US custody: As he left the detention area, he thanked the guards and medics for the treatment he had received. But after a brief helicopter flight over Baghdads roof tops to the execution site in the north of the city, the 69-year-olds demeanour changed to hostile condescension towards waiting Iraqis. 

 An American official observed: He was still dignified but he was scornful. Traces of bravado were evident, said Iraqs national security advisor, Mowaffak al-Rubaie: He said to me: Dont be afraid, as if I was going to be hanged. 

 Saddam was not wholly deluded in his belief that America would try to stop his hanging. Iraqi and American officials fought angrily after an Iraqi court rejected his appeal against the death penalty on Boxing Day. After four days of wrangling, Washington threw in the towel.

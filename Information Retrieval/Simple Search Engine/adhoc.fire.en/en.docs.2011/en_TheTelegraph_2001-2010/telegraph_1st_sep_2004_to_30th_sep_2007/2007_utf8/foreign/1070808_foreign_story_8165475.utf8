 Miran shah (Pakistan), Aug. 7 (Reuters): Pakistani security forces, backed by helicopter gunships, attacked two militant hideouts near the border with Afghanistan today, killing at least 10 militants, the military said.

 The pre-dawn offensive in Degan area, some 25 km west of North Waziristans main town of Miranshah, destroyed the fortress-like compounds used by pro-Taliban militants, Major General Waheed Arshad said. Local sources have told us that at least 10 local militants have been killed and seven have been wounded, Arshad said.

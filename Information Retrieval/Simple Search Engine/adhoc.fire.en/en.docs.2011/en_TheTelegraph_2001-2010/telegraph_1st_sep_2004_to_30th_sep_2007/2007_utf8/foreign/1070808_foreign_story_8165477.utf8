 Cupertino (California), Aug. 7 (Reuters): Apple Inc unveiled a line of slimmer desktop computers today in a long-expected update of its iMac brand.

 The new iMacs, which will sport thinner aluminum casings, have displays measuring 20 inches and 24 inches and will cost $1,199 to $1,799, depending on their configurations, said Apple chief executive Steve Jobs at a media event at Apples headquarters in Cupertino, California.

 The cost of the 24-inch iMac has dropped by $200 and Apple has eliminated the 17-inch iMac computer, Jobs said.

 The last update to the iMac line was in September 2006, when Apple introduced a model with a 24-inch screen its largest and said the entire model line would be powered by Intel chips instead of ones from IBM.

 Apple has grown by two to three times for the past several quarters, said analyst Shannon Cross of Cross Research. This product launch should position them well before school reopens across America and for the holiday season.

 Apple recently launched the iPhone mobile device in a bid to build a third major product line alongside its Macintosh computers and iPod media players. 

 However, desktop and laptop sales still account for the bulk of its revenue. In its third quarter, Apple sold 634,000 desktops for revenue of $956 million, accounting for about 18 per cent of total revenue.

 The iMac has been really successful for us and wed like to make it even better, Jobs said. Weve managed to make it even thinner than before. 

 Apple laptop sales totalled $1.58 billion in its most recently reported quarter. Sales of Macintosh computers have grown faster than the overall PC market, but Apples share of the market by unit sales is estimated to be less than 5 per cent. Apple has also used the iPod and, now, the iPhone as halo products to draw customers into stores and get them interested in its computers.

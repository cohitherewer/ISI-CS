 Osama defies US

 Dubai, Sept. 11 (Reuters): Osama bin Laden defied the US with a new tape praising the 19 champions who carried out the September 11 suicide hijackings, on the day America remembered the nearly 3,000 people who died.

 In a tape released today to mark the sixth anniversary of the attacks, bin Ladens voice can be heard introducing the video testament of Waleed al-Shehri, one of two Saudi brothers who helped Mohamed Atta slam the first hijacked plane into New Yorks World Trade Center.

 Al-Shehri was a magnificent young man who personally penetrated the most extreme degrees of danger and is a rarity among men: one of the 19 champions, the al Qaida leader said, referring to the number of hijackers.

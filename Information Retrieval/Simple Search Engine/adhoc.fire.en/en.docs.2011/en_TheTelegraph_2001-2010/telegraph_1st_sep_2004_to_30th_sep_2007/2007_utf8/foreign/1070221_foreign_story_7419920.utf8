 Sean in Scot push

 Edinburgh (Scotland), Feb. 20 (AP): Film star Sean Connery will make a series of television advertisements for the pro-independence Scottish National Party before May elections for the Scottish Parliament, the party said today.

 The James Bond actor is a longtime supporter of the separatist SNP. Connery, 76, who was born in Edinburgh, has provided voice-overs in previous election campaigns, but this would be the first time he speaks on screen in a political broadcast. The first 45-second ad focuses on the arts, and will be premiered at a March election rally for activists. In it, Connery says: All my life experience tells me that an independent Scotland will be successful. The party is currently doing well in opinion polls and is closing the gap on the Labour Party, which shares power with Liberal Democrats in the Scottish Parliament.

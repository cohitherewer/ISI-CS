 Nukes a question of time

 Moscow, April 2 (Reuters): Russias leading nuclear scientist said today that it was just a question of time before Iran developed a nuclear weapon and it should be stopped.

 The Islamic republic, facing a showdown with the US over its nuclear ambitions, clearly has the knowhow to make atomic weapons, said Yevgeny Velikhov, a close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin. From a scientific point of view of course they could create nuclear weapons, Velikhov, president of Russias Kurchatov Institute, said. When they could do it is a more difficult question.

 If you remember, US scientists expected the Soviet Union would only be able to create a nuclear bomb by around 1954 at the earliest, he said. They were rather surprised when we created one in 1949, he said.

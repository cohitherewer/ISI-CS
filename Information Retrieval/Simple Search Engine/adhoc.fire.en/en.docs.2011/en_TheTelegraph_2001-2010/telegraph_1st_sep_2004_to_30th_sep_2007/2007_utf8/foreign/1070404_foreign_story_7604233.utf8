 Rich beggars

 Beijing, April 3 (PTI): Research conducted by a 17-year-old high school student in Shanghai has found that over 40 per cent of beggars in Chinas largest city earn Rs 6,000 per month.

 Huang Yan, a student at the No 2 High School of East China University, spent eight months interviewing and photographing 265 beggars in Shanghai for her 48-page report into the citys begging phenomenon.

 I was a little shocked to discover that more than 40 per cent of the beggars I spoke to were earning more than 1,000 yuan (about Rs 6,000) per month, Huang said. They were also very different from the traditional image of someone begging for food to stay alive. In fact, 221 of the 265 beggars I interviewed said they bought their own food with the money they collected. They beg for money as well as food, she said.

 According to Huangs figures, about 38 per cent of beggars earn 41 to 60 yuan (Rs 246 to Rs 462) a day, while nine per cent make more than 80 yuan (Rs 480) a day. Of course, they wouldnt tell me exactly what they were making, but I would follow them for several hours and then estimate their daily income, she said. Huang said that 63 of the people she interviewed were occupational beggars, who had made a conscious choice to live that way. They were not forced to do so because they were poor or homeless, she added.

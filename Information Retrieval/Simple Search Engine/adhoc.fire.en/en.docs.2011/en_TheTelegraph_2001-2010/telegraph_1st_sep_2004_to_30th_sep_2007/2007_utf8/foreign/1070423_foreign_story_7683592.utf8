 Healthy cocktail

 Washington, April 22 (Reuters): A fruity cocktail may not only be fun to drink but may count as health food, US and Thai researchers have said.

 Adding ethanol the type of alcohol found in rum, vodka, tequila and other spirits boosted the antioxidant nutrients in strawberries and blackberries, the researchers found. Any coloured fruit might be made even more healthful with the addition of a splash of alcohol, the report in the Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture said.

 Dutch dope

 Amsterdam (Reuters): Could a smoking ban spell the end of Amsterdams world famous coffee shops, where smoking cannabis is one of the main attractions? No chance, says local conservative politician and coffee shop owner Michael Veling. The Dutch may well follow other European countries in banning tobacco smoking, but Veling says it should still be possible to smoke dope. You can bring parsley or old socks if you want, cut them here and smoke them, nobody will say anything, Veling said.

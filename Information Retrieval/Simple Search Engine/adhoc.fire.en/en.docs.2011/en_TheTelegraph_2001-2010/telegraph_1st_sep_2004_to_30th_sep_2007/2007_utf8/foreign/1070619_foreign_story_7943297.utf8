 Global paedophile ring busted

 London, June 18 (Reuters): Police have smashed a global Internet paedophile ring with 700 members and rescued more than 30 children from abuse, a police spokesman said today.

 Detectives targeted an Internet chatroom where members from 35 countries swapped thousands of indecent pictures and films of children. Undercover officers gathered evidence at the site, called Kids the Light of Our Lives, before arresting its host, Timothy Cox, 28, from Suffolk.

 Police found nearly 76,000 explicit images and 1,100 videos on his computer. He supplied thousands of pictures to others, using the online name Son of God. 

 Cox pleaded guilty to charges of possession and distribution of indecent images of children.

 The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, which led the investigation, said the case was a powerful warning to paedophiles. Any individual who thinks they carry out such horrific activities undetected is in for a very rude awakening, said the centres chief executive.

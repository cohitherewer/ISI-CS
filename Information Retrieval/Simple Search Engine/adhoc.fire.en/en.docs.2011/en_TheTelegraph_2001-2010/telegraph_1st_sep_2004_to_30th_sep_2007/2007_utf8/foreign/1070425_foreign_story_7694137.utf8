 Islamabad, April 24: Pakistans acting top judge Rana Bhagwan Das is likely to constitute a larger bench of the Supreme Court or a full court soon to hear a petition filed by former Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry.

 Chaudhry has challenged his suspension and the constitution of the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC). 

 A full bench of the Supreme Court referred the petition to Justice Bhagwan Das after its head, Justice Sardar Raza Muhammad Khan, declined to hear the case on the ground that he was one of the signatories to an order that restrained the former chief justice. 

 The hearing coincided with the sixth meeting of the SJC, inquiring into allegations levelled against Chaudhry in a presidential reference that he misused his powers and got a police job for his son Arsalan Iftikhar Chaudhry. 

 The SJC heard arguments of Chaudhrys lawyers on their objections regarding the composition of the council and the manner in which the former chief justice was sent on forced leave. The Council will now meet on May 2. 

 We also brought to notice of the council most of the points raised by Justice Chaudhry in his petition, his lawyer Ahmad Ali Kurd told reporters. 

 Chaudhry has raised 132 legal points of great public importance in his petition and sought interim relief to halt proceedings of the SJC, which his lawyers say is not a proper forum to try the chief justice. 

 Today, more than 3,000 flag-waving opposition activists rallied in front of the Supreme Court building and chanted slogans like Go Musharraf Go and Musharraf is a traitor and must step down. They broke through the security cordon to reach the venue.

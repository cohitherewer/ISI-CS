The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 BA strike off, but disruptions remain

 Airline in turmoil

London, Jan. 29 (Reuters): British Airways said today a 48-hour strike by cabin crew members of its largest union had been cancelled, although it still expected disruptions for thousands of passengers this week.

 Negotiations with the T amp;G (union) have resulted in an agreement that removes the threat of strikes, Chief Executive Willie Walsh said in a statement, adding that BA would reinstate as many cancelled flights as possible.

 Last week, the Transport and General Workers Union (T amp;G) called a 48-hour strike by cabin crew from tomorrow unless there was agreement on issues which include sick-leave policy and pay. 

 The T amp;G threatened two further 72-hour strikes in February.

 The T amp;G said today it had won a 4.6 per cent pay deal for its members at BA, and a pay rise equal to Britains RPI measure of inflation for next year.

 Walsh said: Unfortunately, the decision (to call off the strike) has come too late to prevent disruption to the travel plans of tens of thousands of our customers tomorrow (Tuesday) and Wednesday.

 BA, which last Thursday cancelled 1,300 flights scheduled for this week, said it had reinstated all long-haul flights that had been cancelled.

 The dispute with the union centres around BAs sick-leave policy and its two pay scales for cabin staff.

 BA says cabin crew were taking an average of 22 sick days per year before Walsh took charge in October 2005 and that under a new absence policy the figure had fallen to 12 days. Some 10,500 of BAs approximately 15,000 cabin crew are members of the T amp;G.

 India flights

 A British Airways official in Delhi said there was no information on the schedule of flights to and from India. Right now (Monday evening), we have no information. But if any new decision is taken, the passengers will be informed, the official said.

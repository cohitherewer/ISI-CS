 Bush loses Latin sense

 Sao Paulo (Brazil), March 10 (AP): President George W. Bush was on Latin time yesterday. And it may have disoriented him a bit.

 First, his news conference with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was 42 minutes late in starting. Then, Silva unleashed an opening statement that wandered along for more than 13 minutes.

 Bush, known to prefer brevity in all public speaking especially when he is not holding the microphone was becoming visibly uncomfortable as Silvas comments went on. Bush clipped through his opening remarks in six minutes.

 But his mind may have wandered while he was speaking. In closing, he told Silva: Mr President, Im so glad youre here as if it was the American who was the host rather than the Brazilian. He quickly corrected himself. I mean, so glad I am here, he said, to much laughter.

 It was not long before Bushs impatience with the proceedings flared. 

 After the leaders had answered one question each from the American and Brazilian media, there seemed a hesitation before Silva called on another reporter from his press corps.

 Get another question moving, said Bush.

 After the stodgy news conference, Bush was ready to cut loose. At a community centre in Sao Paulo, the President was treated to a performance of a Brazilian samba by children.

 Tired of standing along a wall, Bush chucked his coat, grabbed a Brazilian rattle known as a ganza, and shook it along to the music.

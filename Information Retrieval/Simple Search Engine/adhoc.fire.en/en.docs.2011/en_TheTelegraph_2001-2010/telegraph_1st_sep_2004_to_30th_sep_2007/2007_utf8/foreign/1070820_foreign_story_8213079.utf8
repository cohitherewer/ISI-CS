 Male, Aug. 19 (Reuters): Maldives President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom today won a landmark referendum to adopt a US-style presidential system in the remote Indian Ocean island chain, in a vote seen as an acid test for Asias longest serving ruler.

 Gayoom had advocated a presidential system, while the main Opposition Maldivian Democratic Party pushed for a British-style parliamentary system in a vote it billed as referendum on his 29-year rule they describe as a dictatorship.

 Officials said Gayoom and his Dhivehi Rayyithunge Partys presidential model choice won 62 per cent of the votes, with 38 per cent against. Just over 150,000 of a total electorate of 193,000 turned out to vote in a land best known for luxury honeymoons and Hollywood star visitors such as Tom Cruise.

 This referendum was not about my leadership, it was about what form of government the people wanted to have in the future, Gayoom told a news conference.

 But (with) this result, I am very much in position to say I am very happy with the endorsement, the massive endorsement that the people has given to our party position in the referendum, he added, rejecting Opposition charges of vote-rigging. and calling for cross-party unity.

 Vatican plea to women

 Pope Benedict

 Vatican City, April 6 (Reuters): A top Vatican clergyman today urged women not to try to behave like men to assert themselves in society, and expressed the hope that the world would enter an era of the woman, of heart, of compassion.

 Father Raniero Cantalamessa was preaching in St Peters Basilica in the presence of Pope Benedict on Good Friday at one of the main services of Easter, climax of the Christian year.

 In his sermon, Cantalamessa, officially Preacher of the Papal Household, made several references to womens role in society, and urged them to avoid trying to erase the differences between genders.

 To affirm their dignity, they have felt it necessary at times to assume masculine behaviour, or minimise the difference between sexes, he said. 

 He noted that no women were responsible for Christs death, only men, and said Christs female disciples had followed him not because they sought power, but because they believed in him with their hearts. There is reason to hope that humanity will finally enter an era of the woman: an era of heart, of compassion, he said.

 Cantalamessa also lamented the fact that people sought to improve their intellectual capacity much more readily than their capacity to love, because knowledge translates automatically into power; love into service.

 We must give more room to reasoning of the heart if we want to prevent our planet plunging into a spiritual ice age, he said.

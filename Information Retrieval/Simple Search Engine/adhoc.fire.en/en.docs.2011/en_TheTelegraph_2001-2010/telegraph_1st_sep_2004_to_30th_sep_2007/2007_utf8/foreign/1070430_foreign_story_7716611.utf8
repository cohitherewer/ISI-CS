 Hasina petition 

 Dhaka, April 29 (Reuters): Bangladeshs high court today refused to accept a petition seeking legal immunity for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. 

 The petition intended to seek an order asking police not to arrest Hasina, who faces charges for murder and extortion, when she returns from London next week. A high court bench comprising judges S.A.N.M Mominur Rahman and M. Zubaidur Rahman Chowdhury, refused to accept the writ petition as it lacked an affidavit signed by Sheikh Hasina, a court registrar said. 

 Turkey crisis 

 Istanbul (Reuters): Turkish foreign minister Abdullah Gul refused on Sunday to withdraw from its presidential vote, defying pressure from the army and calls from thousands of demonstrators worried about his Islamist past. 

 Royal move 

 Paris (Reuters): French presidential contender Segolene Royal has hinted she could nominate centrist former candidate Francois Bayrou as prime minister if she became president, in an effort to win over voters a week ahead of the second round vote. Socialist Royal is trailing right-winger Nicolas Sarkozy in opinion polls ahead of the May 6 run-off.

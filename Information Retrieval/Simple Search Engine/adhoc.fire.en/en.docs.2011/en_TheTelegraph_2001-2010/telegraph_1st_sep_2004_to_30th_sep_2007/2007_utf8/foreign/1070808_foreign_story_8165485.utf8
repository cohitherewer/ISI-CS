 Legal action to declare Tintin racist

 Brussels, Aug. 7 (Reuters): A Congolese student has launched legal action in Belgium to have the comic book Tintin in the Congo declared racist and removed from bookstores.

 The book portrays Africans as stereotypical black characters and shows whites as their colonial masters. I want to put an end to sales of this cartoon book in shops, both for children and for adults. Its racist and it is filled with colonial-era propaganda, said Mbutu Mondondo Bienvenu, who lives in Brussels.

 A call by Britains Commission for Racial Equality earlier this year for bookstores to remove the Tintin edition from their shelves prompted one chain to move the book from its childrens section to the shelves for adult graphic stories.

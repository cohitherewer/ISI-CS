 Israel holds Hamas minister

 Nablus, West Bank, May 24 (Reuters): Israeli forces seized a Palestinian cabinet minister and more than 30 other officials today in a new phase of a crackdown on Hamas Islamists that a UN envoy described as troubling.

 The group vowed to use any means to free those detained.

 It also defied more Israeli air strikes in Gaza and a truce call from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas by again firing rockets into Israel. Hamas derided Abbas, who leads the rival secular Fatah faction, as out of touch with the mood of his people.

 Overnight, Israeli troops entered Nablus, in the occupied West Bank, and took into custody Palestinian education minister Naser al-Shaer of Hamas. They also seized at least three Hamas members of parliament, the mayor and deputy mayor of Nablus and other Hamas officials in neighbouring towns and villages.

 The Israeli army said 33 people were held across the West Bank. Last year, after Hamas won a parliamentary election, Israel seized more than 30 Hamas lawmakers, who are still held.

 Hamas said in a statement: The continued detention of lawmakers and ministers gives Hamas the right to use any means to free them.... Harming them will open the gates of hell.

 Palestinian government spokesman Ghazi Hamad said the arrests displayed a scale of escalation and Israeli arrogance.

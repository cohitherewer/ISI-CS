 Intel teraflop

 San Francisco, Feb. 13 (AFP): Intel has touted a diminutive new microprocessor that it said could deliver supercomputer-like performance to home computers and handheld devices.

 Intel said yesterday that its unprecedented programmable processor was not much larger than a fingernail, used less power than a typical home appliance and could perform more than a trillion calculations per second a teraflop.

 Such tera-scale computing could make possible artificial intelligence, real-time speech recognition, realistic video games, instant online film viewing and other stuff from the realm of science fiction, according to Intel. Our researchers have achieved a wonderful and key milestone in terms of being able to drive multi-core and parallel computing performance forward, said Intel chief technology officer Justin Rattner.

 Fidel blasts Bush plans

 Havana, March 29 (Reuters): Cubas Fidel Castro today published his first editorial since his July surgery, signing his name to a scathing article on US biofuel plans in the Communist Party newspaper Granma.

 The article e-mailed to the media and later posted on Granmas website said nothing about Castros state of health, but signaled that he is following world affairs closely.

 In the article, Castro said more than 3 billion people in the world were condemned to die prematurely of hunger or thirst from plans by the US to convert foodstuffs like corn into fuel for cars. He was commenting on a Bush administration proposal to cut gasoline use by 20 per cent by 2017, mostly by increasing the use of fuels like ethanol, made from home-grown corn.

 Cuban officials have recently said Castro is recovering well enough to take an active role in government soon.

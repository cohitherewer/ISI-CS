 Hawks issue fatwa against Pak minister

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 UNPERTURBED

 Islamabad, April 9: A shariat court in an Islamabad mosque issued a fatwa against tourism minister Nilofar Bakhtiar for embracing French paragliders and later posing with them in an obscene manner. 

 The court, which was set up last week by radical cleric Maulana Abdul Aziz in Lal Masjid or Red Mosque in Islamabad, asked the government to sack and punish Bakhtiar for indulging in an un-Islamic practice. 

 Her act was un-Islamic and against our social norms. She earned a bad name for Islam. She should be punished, Aziz said.

 The clerics deputy, Abdul Rashid Ghazi, today said the edict was issued last night after the court examined the pictures which were published in a local Urdu newspaper. The pictures showed Bakhtiar hugging a man, apparently her para-jumping instructor, after completing a jump in France.

 However, Bakhtiar condemned the court for levelling baseless accusations against her, saying it is criminal to falsely accuse a woman without verifying the facts. 

 The minister said in Islamabad that she went to Paris to raise funds for Pakistani children affected by the earthquake last year. 

 Pakistani state minister for information Tariq Azeem also rejected the decree, saying that no individual or a group was allowed to interfere in the governments authority.

 It is a reaction to what Musharraf is doing, trying to enforce western norms in our Muslim society, said Abdul Rashid Ghazi.

 In the first high-level contact between the government and the clerics, the leader of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League, Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, held talks with them at the mosque at the weekend.

 Ghazi said Hussain had come to seek the clerics views.

 We are struggling for a cause... Well not wind it up, he said, referring to the vigilante court.

 In January, women from the mosques school occupied a library next to the mosque to protest against efforts by city authorities to demolish illegally built mosques.

 The mosque compound has taken on the air of a rebel camp, with young men with sticks posted at gates and at look-out points along banner-strewn walls. Two or three men have been seen with guns which the clerics say are properly licensed. 

 The burqa-clad female students also abducted an alleged female brothel owner with her daughter and daughter-in-law last month, which sparked off a standoff between students and local police. 

 Identified as Shamim, the lady manager confessed during a press conference at Jamia Hafza moments before she was freed.

 Baluchistan clashes

 Suspected separatist militants attacked a military vehicle in Pakistans gas-rich Baluchistan province on Monday killing three soldiers and wounding two, a military spokesman said.

 Militants seeking a greater share of profits from resources in Baluchistan, Pakistans biggest but poorest province and its main source of natural gas, have been waging an insurgency for decades.

 They fired on a moving vehicle and three soldiers were killed, said military spokesman Major-General Waheed Arshad. Soldiers were hunting for the attackers, he said.

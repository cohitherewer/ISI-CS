 46 killed as Greece battles fires

 Zacharo (Greece), Aug. 25 (Reuters): Terrified Greek villagers used garden hoses and buckets in a futile effort to stop raging flames from reaching their homes today, as the countrys worst fires in decades killed 46 people.

 Its a catastrophe of biblical proportions. Its ridiculous that there is no protection for the people here, said Stathis Kokaliaris, a resident of the hardest hit region of Zacharo.

 The fires started yesterday near Zacharo, a town of about 7,000 people, surrounded by picturesque villages on the west coast of the southern Peloponnese peninsula.

 But soon several fronts appeared in other areas, some more than 160 km away and by today, the fire brigade said it was battling nearly 90 separate fires across the country.

 Under skies darkened by thick smoke, some locals stood and watched helplessly as towering flames scorched thousands of acres of forest and olive groves, passing unhindered through their farms and villages.

 Some made desperate pleas to television stations for the thinly-stretched fire brigade to come and help.

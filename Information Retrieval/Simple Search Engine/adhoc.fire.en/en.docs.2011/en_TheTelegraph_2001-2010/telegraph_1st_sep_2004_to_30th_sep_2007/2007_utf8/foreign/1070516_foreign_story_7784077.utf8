 New foetus test raises ethics fears

 London, May 15 (AP): A new test dubbed Pink or Blue promises to tell parents the sex of their foetus just six weeks into pregnancy, but critics question its reliability and say it could open a Pandoras box of ethical issues.

 British company DNA Worldwide launched the test last month for sale over the Internet targeting a broad world audience. The company bought the rights to market the technique from a US company that has been selling the test online.

 The company does not ship to countries including China and India.

 The test works by analysing foetal DNA that leaks into the mothers bloodstream. However, Dr Patrick Brien, a consultant obstetrician in the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: The earlier in pregnancy that you do these tests, the less foetal DNA there will be around, and possibly, the less accurate the test will be.

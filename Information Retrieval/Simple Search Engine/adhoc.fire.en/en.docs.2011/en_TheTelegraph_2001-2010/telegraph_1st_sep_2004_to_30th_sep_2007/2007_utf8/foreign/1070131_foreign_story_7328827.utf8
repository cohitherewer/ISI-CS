 Battle over Les Miserables

 HENRY SAMUEL 

 Victor Hugo

 Paris, Jan. 30: The highest appeals court in France will decide whether to ban a contemporary sequel to Victor Hugos Les Miserables for betraying the spirit of the 19th century classic. 

 The verdict could end years of wrangling between the authors great-great-grandson, Pierre Hugo, and Francois Ceresa, whose two-tome sequel was derided as an insipid Les Mis II by his family. 

 I hope to set a legal precedent for all descendants of celebrities, be they writers, artists or musicians, to protect the spirit of their forebears, Hugo, 59, a writer and goldsmith, said. 

 Intellectual property rights lawyers said the ruling could set a precedent in cases pitting literary works considered to be in the public domain 70 years after their authors death against an authors moral rights which are by law timeless and guarded by his descendants. 

 The court battle began in 2001, after the release of Ceresas book, Cosette ou le Temps des Illusions (Cosette or the Time of Illusions), which Hugo claimed was a mere moneymaking operation that violated the respect of the integrity of Hugos 1862 masterpiece. 

 Lawyers for Ceresa argued that to ban his novel would violate freedom of expression and deter artists from turning to great works for inspiration. 

 Les Miserables has been adapted in books and plays and inspired the West End musical of the same name, which, Hugo claimed, his great-great-grandfather would have enjoyed thoroughly. 

 I am not against adaptations. I have seen 10 of the 47 film versions and they all respect the novel. The latest hit musical in Paris based on The Hunchback of Notre Dame is fine. But I cannot accept a novel being sold as if it were a true sequel purely for commercial gain. 

 Hugo initially sought 4.5 million in damages from the publishers, saying he would donate the money to charity. The judges threw out the case because he had not proved that he was a relation of the French literary great.

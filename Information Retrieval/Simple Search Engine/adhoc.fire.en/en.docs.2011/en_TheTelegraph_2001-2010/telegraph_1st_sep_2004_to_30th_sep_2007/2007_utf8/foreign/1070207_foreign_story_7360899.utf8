 MIT professor on hunger strike

 Sherley: Stem cell anger

 Boston, Feb. 6 (Reuters): A black professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology began a hunger strike yesterday, refusing to eat unless the university reverses its decision to deny him tenure.

 James Sherley, a biological engineer whose opposition to embryonic stem cell research has been controversial among his peers, charges he has been denied the same freedom to challenge scientific orthodoxy afforded his white colleagues.

 MIT expressed concern for Sherleys safety but said his case was rigorously reviewed and the decision to deny him tenure was fair. Twenty biological engineering department faculty signed a statement saying they believed race did not play a role in the decision.

 Sherley, who has vowed to stand in protest outside the president and provost office for three hours each morning, says he believes the research is immoral because it requires the destruction of days-old embryos. He works only with adult stem cells.

 Stem cell research has raised hope among many scientists including many of Sherleys peers for cures for ailments such as Alzheimers disease, diabetes, Parkinsons disease and spinal cord injuries.

 In a 2005 letter to The Boston Globe newspaper, he called the motivations of scientists who promote human embryonic stem cell research morally vacuous and selfish.

 He was not available to comment after speaking to a group of about 20 professors and supporters outside the offices of MITs president and provost in the morning.

 When his request for tenure was first reviewed in 2005, Sherley was one of 28 African-American professors at MIT and the only black faculty member ever appointed in his department.

 Linguist and political dissident Noam Chomsky and 10 other MIT professors want Sherleys case re-examined.

 But MIT has said their decision stands and the process was thorough and extensive and followed with integrity. 

 While we have encouraged him to seek other means to express his views, the Institute will respect his right, as a member of our community, to publicly express his disagreement in a manner that does not disrupt the work of the Institute or put others in the community at risk, Chancellor Phillip Clay said.

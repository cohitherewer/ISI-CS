 Castro battle

 BONNIE MALKIN

 Havana, Jan. 20: Ailing Cuban leader Fidel Castro is locked in a battle for his life, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has said.

 There are those who want Fidel to die, Chavez said, alluding to a recent Spanish press report that Castro, 80, was gravely ill following three failed operations. But I spoke to him a few days ago ... We trust he will recover completely. 

 Chavez, a good friend of Castros, has visited him and often speaks to him by telephone. 

 There has been mounting speculation over the condition of Castro, who has not been seen in public since being taken ill in late July. Last week, a US intelligence chief said Castro was terminally ill and might have only days to live. 

 I dont know when hes going to die, said Chavez. I hope he lives another 80 years, I hope he lives another 100 years, but Fidel Castro is one of those men who will never die. Hes like Che Guevara, the immortal Che, the Leftist President said to the applause of some 500 people. He was referring to legendary guerrilla leader Ernesto Che Guevara, an Argentine doctor and Castros right-hand man who was killed in Bolivia in 1967.

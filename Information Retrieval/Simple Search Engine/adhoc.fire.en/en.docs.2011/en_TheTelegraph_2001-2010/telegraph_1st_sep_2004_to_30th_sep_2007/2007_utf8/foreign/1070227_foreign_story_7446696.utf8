 Mom in obese defence

 London, Feb. 26 (Reuters): The mother of a 14-stone (98kg) eight-year-old boy, who could be taken into care because of his weight, has defended her refusal to stop feeding him junk food.

 Single mum Nicola McKeown says her son Connor McCreaddie refuses to eat healthy foods, such as fruit and vegetables. He likes processed foods and if I try him with any salad, vegetables, fruit, he just refuses to eat it or spits it out, she told BBC Radio today.

 When a child wont eat anything else, youve got to feed them what they like.

 The 35-year-old mum who has sought help to try to reduce Connors weight rejected a suggestion that she put a lock on the fridge. I wouldnt go that far, she said. Thats not the way to do it, starving your child. However, Connor has lost one-and-a-half stone (10.5kg) following advice from health workers and a dietician at the start of the year.

 The family, from Wallsend, Newcastle, face a child protection conference with North Tyneside Council tomorrow.

 The last resort would be for social workers to put him into care, but McKeown is confident she can help her son lose weight.

 The schoolboy will feature in the Tonight with Trevor McDonald show, exploring childhood obesity. Former Olympic runner Roger Black said Connors case was very extreme but that it highlighted the need for exercise to be pushed higher up the school agenda. Whats interesting for me, and everything Ive read over the weekend about this issue, its always been about diet; its about what he (Connor) eats. Theres no mention of exercise, he told the BBC.

 Many, many children in this country are growing up doing very, very little exercise and if you create a culture of young children not used to doing exercise on a daily basis then these problems do happen. Black has recently spent a term in an inner London comprehensive school to try to encourage 12-year-olds to become more active as part of the run-up to the 2012 Olympics.

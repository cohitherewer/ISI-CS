 Pak soldiers killed in blast

 Peshawar, Jan. 22 (Reuters): A rare suicide car bomb attack in North Waziristan killed four Pakistani soldiers and a woman passerby today, raising fears that government peace deals in the pro-Taliban region were disintegrating.

 In addition to the deaths, a military spokesman said nine soldiers had been wounded, some critically, when the car rammed an army convoy at Khajori checkpost, near the town of Mir Ali, where Taliban and al Qaida fighters have been active in the past.

 A white-coloured car hit the convoy and it appears to be a suicide attack, spokesman Major-General Shaukat Sultan said. He added that three soldiers had been killed outright and a fourth died in hospital. A local security official said a woman bystander had also died.

 It was uncertain how many people were in the suicide car. No one immediately claimed responsibility. The suicide attack came less than a week after a Pakistani air strike on a suspected Taliban and al Qaida base in neighbouring South Waziristan, raising the possibility that it was an act of revenge.

 That strike killed up to 20 militants, intelligence officials said. Villagers said only the bodies of eight wood-cutters had been found.

 Tensions have been running high since then in Waziristan, which borders Afghanistan, and tribesmen in the area expected a breakdown in peace accords worked out by the government with militants and tribal elders.

 Hundreds of people have been killed since late 2003 in Waziristan in clashes between security forces and militants.

 Suicide attacks on the army, however, are extremely rare, although the Taliban regularly uses the tactic across the border against Afghan, US, and Nato-led forces.

 US fights for Wolfowitz

 - Not a firing offence

 Washington, May 15 (Reuters): The US fought for World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz to keep his job today, saying he had made mistakes but should not be fired despite a bank finding that he broke rules in promoting his companion.

 In what appeared to be a coordinated move to stave off European pressure for his dismissal, the administration said the former US defence secretary and architect of the Iraq war had not committed a firing offence.

 Weve made clear that we support Paul Wolfowitz, White House spokesman Tony Snow said. Furthermore, he has said and we agree that certainly a lot of mistakes were made in the personnel process. But its not a firing offence, he added.

 US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice echoed the White Houses comments, which came a day after a World Bank committee said he had violated ethics rules in the promotion and pay rise for his companion Shaha Riza, a West Asia expert.

 It seems to me that what happened there, as he said, he made some mistakes but it doesnt seem to be the kind of thing that you would want to see the dismissal of a World Bank president over, Rice said in Moscow.

 Wolfowitz, whose neo-conservative background and high-profile role in planning the Iraq war made him unpopular with many bank member countries, will make a last-ditch effort to hold on to his job when he appears before the banks 24-nation board.

 The panel found that Wolfowitz had broken bank rules on conflict of interest by seeking a different resolution to Rizas job status than would have applied to other staff and had cast himself in opposition to the established rules of the institution.

 Fine Print

 Coldplay album

 Mexico City, March 5 (AP): Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin said his band is working on a new album featuring what he called a quintessential song that everybody should hear before we die.

 Martin and his band spoke yesterday hours before the final concert of a Latin American tour that took them to Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.

 The band said it plans to return to the studio after a two-year hiatus to record an album that will have a different sound from X amp;Y, which has sold more than 2 million copies since it was released in 2005.

 I think for a long time people felt like we were a band in black-and-white, and now we feel like because we have this incredible job, now we can do whatever we like and try all kinds of new things, Martin said.

 Rap curry

 London (AP): If Kanye West were to walk into the British Rajs dining room and order dinner, it would cost the rapper less than 10. But since the restaurant is delivering from Wales to New York its going to cost a bit more. For a feast of onion bhajees, chappati breads, biryanis, pappadums, a specially prepared fish dish and vegetables on the side, the bill will top 2,000, plus travel and accommodation for the restaurants head chef.

 George gig

 London (Reuters): British singer George Michael will be the first pop artist to play a concert at the new Wembley Stadium, the venues managing director said on Sunday. Michaels gig at the much-delayed rebuilt stadium, which has cost more than 750 million, is scheduled for June 9, three weeks after the venue is due to host the FA Cup final English soccers showcase event. Hes no stranger to this great stage having performed at the old stadium both with Wham! at Live Aid and also as a solo artist, so this is a fitting first gig in the new stadium, Wembley managing director Alex Horne said.

 Jazz tune

 Washington (AP): Wynton Marsalis is sending a political message: apathy is the enemy, so jump in and participate. Find out where the tax money is going. Find out why something happened. Write to people. Just be a participant, Marsalis told George Stephanopoulos on ABCs This Week broadcast on Sunday. Marsalis is about to release his new album From the Plantation to the Penitentiary. He said the song Where Yall At is aimed at the direction that adults from the 1960s era are giving todays youth.

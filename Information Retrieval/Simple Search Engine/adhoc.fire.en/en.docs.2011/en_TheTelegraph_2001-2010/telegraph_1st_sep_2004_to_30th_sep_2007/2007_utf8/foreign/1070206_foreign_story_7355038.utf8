The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Apple, Beatles settle suit

 London, Feb. 5 (Reuters) Apple Inc. has settled its long-running trademark dispute with The Beatless company, Apple Corps Ltd, in a deal that could finally pave the way for the Fab Fours songs to be sold on the iTunes music store.

 The two companies said Apple Inc would now own all the trademarks related to Apple and would license certain trademarks back to Apple Corps for continued use. We love the Beatles, and it has been painful being at odds with them over these trademarks, Apple chief Executive Steve Jobs said. 

 Neil Aspinall, manager of Apple Corps, said it was great to put the dispute behind them and move on. 

 The dispute centres around a 1991 trademark agreement between the two sides regarding the use of their respective apple-shaped logos. The music firm said that the computer company had violated the agreement by moving into the music business.

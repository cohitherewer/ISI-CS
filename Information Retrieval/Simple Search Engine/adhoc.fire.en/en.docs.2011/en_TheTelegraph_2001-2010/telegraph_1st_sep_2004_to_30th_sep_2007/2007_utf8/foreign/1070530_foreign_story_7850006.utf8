 Leopard wrestle

 Jerusalem, May 29 (Reuters): An Israeli man wrestled a leopard to the ground after it entered his bedroom in a desert college and tried to make a meal of his pet cat.

 He jumped on the leopard and pinned him to the floor, then his wife called us so we could take it away, Amram Zabari, a local park ranger who rushed to the scene, said today.

 Arthur De Mosh was awakened in the middle of the night by the sound of the leopard trying to eat his cat.

 NY security tightened

 New York, Aug. 11 (Reuters): New York police stepped up security throughout Manhattan and at bridges and tunnels yesterday in response to an Internet report which authorities said they could not verify that al Qaida might be plotting to detonate a dirty bomb in the city.

 New York city police said in a statement the threat against the city was a unverified radiological threat, stressed the increased security was precautionary and said the citys alert status for an attack was unchanged at orange. New York mayor Michael Bloomberg stressed there was no reason to believe this threat was any different from countless others since the September 11 attacks.

 One law enforcement source said that authorities were responding to Internet chatter reported on Israeli website www.debka.com, but that the information reported there could not be verified.

 That site reported that there has been a rush of electronic chatter on al Qaida sites, one saying there would be an attack by means of trucks loaded with radio-active material against Americas biggest city and financial nerve centre.

 Another al Qaida message mentioned New York, Los Angeles and Miami as targets, the Jerusalem-based Internet news site reported. The New York Police Department said it had increased the deployment of radiological sensors on vehicles, boats and helicopters, and had set up vehicle checkpoints in lower Manhattans financial district.

 Police confirmed the increased security was in response to receiving information that a dirty bomb may go off last evening around 34th street in Manhattan a neighbourhood with the Empire State Building, New Yorks tallest building, Madison Square Garden and Macys department store.

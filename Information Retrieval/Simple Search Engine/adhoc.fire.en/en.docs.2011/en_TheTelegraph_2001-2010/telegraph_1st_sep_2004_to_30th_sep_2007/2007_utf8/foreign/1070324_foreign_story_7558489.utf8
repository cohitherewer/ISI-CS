 Nepal probe

 Kathmandu, March 23 (Reuters): Nepals multi-party government ordered a judicial probe today into clashes between Maoists and ethnic Madhesis that killed at least 27 people, a minister said.

 Wednesdays violence was the worst unrest involving Madhesis and the former rebels since the Madhesi Peoples Rights Forum started protests in January to demand more government jobs and parliament seats for their ethnic community.

 Today, the government gave a panel headed by an appeal court judge 15 days to submit its report on the killings in the border town of Gaur, 80 km southeast of Kathmandu.

 The government is very serious about the incident, Prabhu Narayan Choudhury, minister for land reforms and management, said after an emergency cabinet meeting.

 Maoists and supporters of the Madhesi forum attacked each other with guns, bamboo sticks, knives and stones following a row over the selection of the same venue for public meetings.

 Reports said most of those killed were Maoist supporters.

 The violence in Gaur is the most deadly in Nepal since the government and the Maoists signed a peace deal in November.

 The Maoists, who began fighting against the monarchy in 1996, signed the peace deal in November, ending a revolt that killed more than 13,000 people. But in recent months, Maoists and Madhesis have clashed in the fertile and narrow plain in Nepals south, which borders India.

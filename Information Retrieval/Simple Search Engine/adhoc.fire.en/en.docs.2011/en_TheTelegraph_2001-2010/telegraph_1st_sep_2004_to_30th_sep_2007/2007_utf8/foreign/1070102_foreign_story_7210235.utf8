 Gael effect

 Los Angeles, Jan. 1 (AP): Babel actor Gael Garcia Bernal embraces his Mexican identity, saying it has a liberating effect on his expanding career.

 I feel completely free to be whatever, he told the Los Angeles Times. Actually, if I was an actor from the US, it would be incredibly hard, because I would be pigeonholed immediately.

 Garcia Bernal, 28, said in Mexico any perceived faux pas by a celebrity can draw criticism. Thats something that in Mexico they pick up a lot on Oh, he didnt give me an autograph, hes lost it. And its funny because its so ephemeral and so trivial, he said. His legions of fans can look forward to seeing him next year in Hector Babencos El Pasado (The Past).

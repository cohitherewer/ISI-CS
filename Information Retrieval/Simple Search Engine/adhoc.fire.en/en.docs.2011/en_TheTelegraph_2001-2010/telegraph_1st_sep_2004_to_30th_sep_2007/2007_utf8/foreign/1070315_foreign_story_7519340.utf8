 007 creators powerful Colt gun to be auctioned

 Magnum gift

 London, March 14 (AFP): A powerful, snub-nosed revolver owned by Ian Fleming, the author of the James Bond novels, will be sold at an auction in London later this month, the Bonhams Auction House said.

 Experts estimate the Colt Python .357 Magnum revolver, which the Colt company presented to Fleming as a gift in 1964, will fetch between 10,000 and 15,000 at an auction on March 28.

 The revolver, accompanied with a letter of authentication, will be the centrepiece at the auction of fine modern sporting guns and vintage firearms, Bonhams said. The .357 Magnum is one of the hardest hitting handgun calibres around, Patrick Hawes, head of sporting guns at Bonhams, was quoted as saying.

 In presenting Fleming with the gift, Bonhams said Colt may well have been thanking him for referring to a Colt .45 Peacemaker in The Man with the Golden Gun, used by Scaramanga, the KGB villain.

 Halle happy to be home

 FAN FLOOD

 Valley Vie (Ohio), March 24 (AP): Even in the rain, Halle Berry draws a crowd when she returns home to Ohio.

 About 800 people waited in drizzle on Thursday night in the Cleveland suburb of Valley View to catch a glimpse of the Oscar-winning actress before a screening of her new film, Perfect Stranger.

 Onlookers snapped photos with cameras and cellphones as Berry made her way from a sport utility vehicle to the movie theatre. She signed autographs, talked to fans and conducted interviews with local media. Im so happy to be home, she told the packed theatre before the film started.

 I swear this is true. No matter how many countries Ive been to, no matter how many warm receptions Ive got, my heart was beating when I pulled up. Nothing feels better. The voices all sound familiar in some weird way. Im of here. Im from here. And Im one of you.

 Berry, 40, grew up in the Cleveland area and graduated from high school in suburban Bedford in 1984. She won the best-actress Oscar in 2002 for Monsters Ball.

 Guests at the screening included Cleveland mayor Frank Jackson who called Berry homegrown and beautiful when he introduced her and Browns football player Braylon Edwards. Im a big fan of Halle Berrys, Edwards said. I think every man in America is.

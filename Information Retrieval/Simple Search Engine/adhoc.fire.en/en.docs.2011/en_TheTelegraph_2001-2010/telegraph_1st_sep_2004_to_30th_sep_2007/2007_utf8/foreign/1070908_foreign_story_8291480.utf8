 Monarchy days over, says Nepali Congress

 Kathmandu, Sept. 7 (AFP): The Nepali Congress today landed a potentially knockout blow to the monarchy by declaring that it wanted the kingdom to become a republic.

 The party, which has traditionally supported the monarchy, said today that the days of the two century-old dynasty were nearly over. The Central Working Committee of the Nepali Congress has decided, in principle, to vouch for a federal republic, party chief whip Ananda Prasad Dhungana said.

 He added that the decision would be voted on later this month by a bigger party meeting and, if approved, would mean that the Nepali Congress will officially stand for a federal republic to be declared after elections set for November. Narhari Acharya, a Congress Central Committee member, said Nepals oldest and largest party had taken a most important and relevant decision to ditch the king. 

 Yesterday, King Gyanendras son Crown Prince Paras survived a massive heart attack. He is out of danger and is recovering well in hospital.

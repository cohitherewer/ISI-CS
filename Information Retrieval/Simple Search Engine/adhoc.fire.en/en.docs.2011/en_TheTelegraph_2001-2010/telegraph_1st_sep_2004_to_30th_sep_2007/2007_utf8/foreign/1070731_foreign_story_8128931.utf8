 Worst poet

 Edinburgh (Scotland), July 30 (AP): The land that gave the world Robert Burns also has the dubious honour of producing the worlds worst poet. 

 Now fans of the hapless William McGonagall are campaigning to put him in the pantheon of Scottish literary greats. The late 19th century poets work is so bad he carried an umbrella with him at all times as protection from the barrage of rotten tomatoes he faced wherever he recited.

 His most famous work, a poem initially titled The Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay, drew derision from crowds when it required a hasty rewrite after the structure collapsed in 1879.

 It became The Tay Bridge Disaster with the immortal opening stanza: Beautiful Railway Bridge of the Silvry Tay!/Alas! I am very sorry to say/That ninety lives have been taken away/On the last Sabbath day of 1879/Which will be rememberd for a very long time.

 Zippo zap

 Bradford, Pennsylvania (AP): The director of marketing for Zippo in France has spent $37,000 on a 1933 Zippo lighter, the highest amount ever paid for one of the iconic products. Didier Karoubi had the winning bid on Saturday at the first public auction offered by Zippo, The Bradford Era reported in its Monday editions. The auction was held at the 75th anniversary festivities for Bradford-based Zippo.

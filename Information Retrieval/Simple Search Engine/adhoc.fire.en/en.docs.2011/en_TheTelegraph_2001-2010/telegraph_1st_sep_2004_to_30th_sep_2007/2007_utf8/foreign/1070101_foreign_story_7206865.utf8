 Hope TomKat will go missing 

 Chicago, Dec. 31 (Reuters): It would be awesome if TomKat and other combined nicknames for celebrity couples went missing in the New Year, a Michigan university said today in its annual list of cliches deserving banishment.

 Lake Superior State Universitys 32nd annual List of Words Banished from the Queens English for Mis-Use, Over-Use and General Uselessness featured such linguistic gems as Gitmo for the US base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; euphemisms such as undocumented alien and such Internet-inflected synonyms as pwn, as in the phrase I pwn (own) you.

 The Sault St. Marie, Michigan, universitys public relations staff culled its list of 16 cliches from 4,500 submissions, many of which demanded that something be done to stop the onslaught of the word awesome.

 Overused and meaningless, complained contributor Robert Bron, writing to the list-makers from Pattaya, Thailand. My mother was hit by a car. Awesome. I just got my college degree. Awesome.

 The list gave short shrift to media shorthand for star duos like TomKat, for the union of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, and Brangelina, for Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.

 How would Lardy have sounded as a nickname for long-ago comedians Laurel and Hardy, or BogCall for Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, the compilers asked.

 Media bashers also welcomed banishment of the phrases gone missing or went missing.

 It makes missing sound like a place you can visit, such as the Poconos, wrote contributor Robin Dennis of Flower Mound, Texas.

 The same goes for a robbery gone bad, which raises the question of whether a theft could go well and good, the list-makers said. Similarly, reporters covering the immigration issue should try again after coming up with undocumented alien, which was compared to euphemistically calling a drug dealer an undocumented pharmacist.

 The list also decried the use in everyday speech of the Internet typographical error pwn, as used when a game-player tells his defeated opponent I pwn you, instead of own you.

 Truthiness, popularised by comedian Stephen Colbert as truth unencumbered by the facts may have been one of the top US television buzzwords of the year. But on this list, it has overstayed its welcome.

 Students killed in Iraq carnage

 Baghdad, Jan. 16 (Reuters): Bombers killed 65 people, many of them young women students, at a Baghdad university today on one of the citys bloodiest days in weeks.

 It was not clear if the bloodshed was related to yesterdays execution of two aides to Saddam Hussein. 

 A car bomb tore through students gathered outside the Mustansiriya University in central Baghdad, most of them women waiting for vehicles to take them home. 

 A suicide bomber then walked into the panicked crowd at a rear entrance, killing more. The education ministry issued a public appeal for blood for the 110 wounded. Rescue workers picked through wreckage and human remains .

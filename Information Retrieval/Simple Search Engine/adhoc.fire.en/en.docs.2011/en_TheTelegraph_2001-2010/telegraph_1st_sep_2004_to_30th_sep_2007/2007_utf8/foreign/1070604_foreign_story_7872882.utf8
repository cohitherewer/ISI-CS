 UK 1-year plan to quit Iraq

 London, June 3: UK military chiefs are drawing up plans to withdraw all British troops from Iraq within 12 months.

 A fresh timetable, which would see a unilateral withdrawal from Iraq by next May, will be presented to Gordon Brown within weeks.

 It is understood that when Brown becomes British Prime Minister later this month, he will be told by defence chiefs that Britain should withdraw from Iraq in quick order and concentrate on fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan.

 Until now, the UK government and the military have both insisted the withdrawal of troops from Iraq would be dictated by events and not time. 

 But the lack of progress in Iraq and the need to send more troops to Afghanistan, where success is regarded by some in the military as easier to measure, has forced the government to accelerate its withdrawal plan. 

 The plan, however, has not met with the approval of all officers, many of whom believe Iraq is strategically more important than Afghanistan.

 Missile attack

 Miranshah (Pakistan), June 19 (Reuters): A missile attack, probably launched by US forces in Afghanistan, killed at least 32 pro-Taliban militants in a Pakistani tribal region near the border today, Pakistani officials said.

 The missiles targeted a suspected training base in a village near the mountainous Datta Khel district, 60 km west of Miranshah, the main town in North Waziristan, officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.

 Intelligence officials said some foreigners were among those killed in Mamy Rogha, raising the possibility that al Qaida fighters might have also been present. North Waziristan is a known refuge for remnants of Osama bin Ladens network.

 There was a cluster of three houses and a tent which were hit. There were about 45 people in that area, a senior government official said. A US pilotless drone aircraft carried out the attack at around 0530 GMT, according to intelligence officials and residents. It was not known whether any leading Taliban or al Qaida figures were targeted in the attack. 

 The Pakistani army had not carried out any operations in the area, army spokesman Major-General Waheed Arshad said.

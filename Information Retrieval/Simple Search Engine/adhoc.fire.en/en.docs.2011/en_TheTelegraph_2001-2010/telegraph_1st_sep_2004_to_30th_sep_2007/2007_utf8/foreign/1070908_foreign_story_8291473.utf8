 Apple eats humble pie after iPhone price rage 

 Bumpy road 

 San Francisco, Sept. 6 (Reuters): 

 Apple Inc, faced with an outcry from iPhone customers who 

 bought the device before a sharp price cut, will offer them 

 a $100 store credit, chief executive Steve Jobs said today.

 The offer applies to people who bought iPhones at either Apple or AT amp;T Inc stores and not receiving rebates or other considerations, Jobs said in a letter posted on Apples website.

 While Apple has not disclosed how many units it has sold to date, it has reported selling 270,000 iPhones on the first two days and expects to sell 1 million units by the end of September, potentially costing the company tens of millions of dollars. 

 Even though we are making the right decision to lower the price of iPhone, and even though the technology road is bumpy, we need to do a better job taking care of our early iPhone customers as we aggressively go after new ones with a lower price, Jobs said.

 Apple also has a policy to refund the difference to customers who bought a product within 14 days of a price drop.

 On Wednesday, Apple slashed the price of its $600 iPhone model to $400, saying it wanted to make the device a combination cellphone, music player and Web browser more affordable. AT amp;T is the exclusive service provider for the device.

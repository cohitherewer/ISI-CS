 Back to Malawi

 New York, April 12 (Reuters): Madonna is heading back to Malawi to continue her charity work there but has no plans to adopt another child, a spokeswoman for the US pop sensation said today.

 Madonna, 48, caused a storm of controversy last year when she went to Malawi to adopt a one-year-old boy, David Banda. News this week that Madonna was heading back to Malawi sparked some media speculation that she was planning to adopt another child but this was quickly denied.

 Gas blow to Bush

 Warming fears

 Washington, April 2 (Agencies): In a defeat for the Bush administration, the supreme court ruled today that a US government agency has the power under the clean air law to regulate greenhouse gas emissions that spur global warming.

 The nations highest court by a 5-4 vote said the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has offered no reasoned explanation for its refusal to regulate carbon dioxide and other emissions from new cars and trucks that contribute to climate change.

 Greenhouse gases are air pollutants under the landmark environmental law, Justice John Paul Stevens said in his majority opinion. The courts four conservative justices Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissented.

 The ruling came in one of the most important environmental cases to reach the supreme court in decades. It marked the first high court decision in a case involving global warming.

 Greenhouse gases occur naturally and are also emitted by cars, trucks and factories into the atmosphere. They can trap heat close to the earths surface like the glass walls of a greenhouse.

 Such emissions have risen steeply over the past century and many scientists see a connection between this rise and an increase in global average temperatures and a related increase in extreme weather, wildfires, melting glaciers and other damage to the environment.

 Justice Stevens, writing for the court majority, rejected the administrations argument that it lacked the power to regulate such emissions. He said the EPAs decision was arbitrary, capricious or otherwise not in accordance with law.

 In sending the case back for further proceedings, Stevens said the high court did not decide which policy the EPA must follow. We hold only that EPA must ground its reasons for action or inaction in the statute, he wrote.

 The Bush administration has consistently rejected capping greenhouse gas emissions as bad for business and US workers.

 The politics of global warming have changed dramatically since the court agreed last year to hear its first global warming case. In many ways, the debate has moved beyond this, said Chris Miller, director of the global warming campaign for Greenpeace, one of the environmental groups that sued the EPA. 

 All the front-runners in the 2008 presidential campaign are much further along on this than the Bush administration is.

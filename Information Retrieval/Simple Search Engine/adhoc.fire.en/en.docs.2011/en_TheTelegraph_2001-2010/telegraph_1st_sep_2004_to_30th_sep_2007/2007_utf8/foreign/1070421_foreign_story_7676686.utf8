 Khaleda wants exile with elder son

 Dhaka, April 20 (PTI): Former Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia has asked the military-backed interim government to allow her eldest son Tarique Rehman to accompany her into exile.

 She also sought one last meeting with her party colleagues, a media report said. Tarique, who is awaiting trial in jail, has been charged with extortion. 

 Khaleda has been trying to delay the departure as the government is yet to settle some issues including her demand that her son Tarique be allowed to go with her, a family source told the New Age daily (www.newagebd.com). 

 The former Premier, who has been confined to her Dhaka Cantonment residence since April 2, has told mediators that she wants to meet senior Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) leaders before leaving the country, the source said. 

 The government is yet to fulfil her demands to allow her to meet some senior BNP leaders to settle how the party would be run in her absence, the source was quoted as saying in the newspaper.

 Khaleda is also trying to delay her departure till Sunday so that she can find out the result of the habeas-corpus petition filed against her confinement. 

 Asked if there was any possibility that Tarique would accompany his mother or would join her abroad later, the source said: Neither the government wants Tarique to leave, nor does he want to.

 A Zia aide said the former Prime Minister had obtained permission to visit Tarique at the Dhaka Central Jail yesterday afternoon but she refused to do so.

 According to the Daily Star newspaper (www.thedailystar.net), a deal for Khaleda to leave quietly for Saudi Arabia reportedly involves authorities showing leniency to her two sons.

 Khaleda along with her younger son, two daughters-in-law and three grandchildren might fly for saudi arabia on Friday, a source told the newspaper. 

 Khaledas government stepped down last October at the end of a five-year term. A caretaker government then took over with the task of holding elections.

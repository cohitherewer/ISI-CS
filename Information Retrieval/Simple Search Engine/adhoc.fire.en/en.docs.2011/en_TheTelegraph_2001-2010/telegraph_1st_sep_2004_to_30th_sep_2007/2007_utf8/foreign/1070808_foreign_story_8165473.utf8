 Los Angeles, Aug. 7 (AP): She may be playing a villain in two summer movies, but Michelle Pfeiffer was all smiles and grace when she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame today.

 The Oscar-nominated star of The Fabulous Baker Boys and Dangerous Liaisons thanked her mother and father for supporting her decision to become an actress.

 She taught me that I could do anything and that I should have a career before I get married, she said. My father who taught me that you can make something of yourself if you work hard.

 Pfeiffer is currently on the screen playing the nasty Velma Von Tussle in Hairspray and will soon be seen as the evil witch Laima in the fairy tale Stardust, set for release on August 10.

 Actors Paul Rudd, her co-star in the upcoming romantic comedy I Could Never Be Your Woman, and Baker Boy Jeff Bridges both attended yesterdays ceremony. You are two of the nicest men on the planet, she told them.

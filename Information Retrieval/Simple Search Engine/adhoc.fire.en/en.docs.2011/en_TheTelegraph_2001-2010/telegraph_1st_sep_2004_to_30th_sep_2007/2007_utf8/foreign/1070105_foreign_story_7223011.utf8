 Ban softens stand

 United Nations, Jan. 4 (PTI): In a damage control exercise, UN secretary-general Ban ki-moon strongly supported the demand by top human rights officials that Iraqi President Jalal Talabani stop the execution of two senior colleagues of former President Saddam Hussein.

 Ban, who was sharply criticised by rights organisations for not being as critical as his predecessor Kofi Annan of the death penalty, today sought to explain his remarks and soften his stand on the issue. UN chief spokesperson Michele Montas said Ban believes that the UN should move towards the abolition of the death penalty. 

 Bans gaffe on his first day in office led some observers to believe that he was trying to dilute the world bodys strong stand against the death penalty. 

 The concerns that I expressed just days ago with respect to the fairness and impartiality of Saddam Husseins trial apply also to these two defendants, the statement said. I have, therefore, today directly appealed to the President of the republic of Iraq to refrain from carrying out these sentences.

 Pak lifts ban on kite-flying

 Islamabad, Jan. 6 (AFP): Pakistani authorities have lifted a ban on the annual kite-flying contest during the Basant Festival, which often ends in tragedy because of the razor-sharp cords used, officials said yesterday.

 Basant, which marks the onset of spring, is a popular festival in Punjab and the provincial capital Lahore, where revellers hold day-and-night kite battles.

 The Punjab government has allowed the celebration of the Basant Festival in Lahore and other parts of the province on February 24 and 25, an official statement said. 

 The provincial government banned the festival in March last year after a series of deaths caused by the glass-coated or metal strings.

 Later, it set up a committee of senior police and government officials that recommended the lifting of the ban, its chairman, Suleman Ghani, said late yesterday.

 This festival generates an economic activity of 1.75 billion rupees ($30 million) for the people of (the) walled city in Lahore every year, he said.

 He agreed that the festival had its hazardous aspects.

 The government has, therefore, formulated a code of conduct for manufacturers of kites and cords, dealers, and revellers, to ensure the safety of (the) general public on the occasion, Ghani said.

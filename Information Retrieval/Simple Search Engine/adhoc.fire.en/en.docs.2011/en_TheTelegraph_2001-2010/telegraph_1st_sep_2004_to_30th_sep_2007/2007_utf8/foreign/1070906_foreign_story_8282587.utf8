 Germany foils terror plan

 Berlin, Sept. 5 (Reuters): Germany said today it had foiled a plan by Islamist militants to carry out massive bomb attacks against US installations and arrested the three men behind it.

 Federal prosecutor Monika Harms said the men, two German nationals and one Turk, had been on the verge of launching their attacks after acquiring enough material to make a bomb with explosive power equal to 550-kg of TNT.

 Thanks to the cooperation of federal and local police over several months, we were able to ... prevent massive bomb attacks, Harms told a news conference in Karlsruhe.

 There was an imminent security threat, defence minister Franz Josef Jung told German television, confirming the men had been poised to launch their attacks soon.

 Harms could not confirm reports the accused had been targeting Frankfurt international airport and a major US military base in Ramstein. 

 But she said they had been seen scouting out US installations such as discos, pubs and airports. The apparent motive is hatred of Americans, said federal police chief Joerg Ziercke.

 Officials said the three belonged to a little known al Qaida-affiliated group with roots in Uzbekistan and were believed to have been trained in Pakistan militant camps.

 News of the arrests comes a day after Danish police seized eight young Muslims whom they suspect of plotting a bomb attack and having links to al Qaida. They occurred less than a week before the sixth anniversary of the September 11, 2001 hijacked plane attacks on targets in the US. 

 Officials said it was unclear whether there was any link between the alleged German and Danish plots.

 Germany, which has forces stationed in Afghanistan, has been on high alert for attacks. The country has feared a re-emergence of militant Islamic groups since 2001, when the northern city of Hamburg was used as a base for planning the September 11 attacks.

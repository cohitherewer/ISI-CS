 Gods silence hurt Mother, says Pope

 Loreto (Italy), Sept. 1 (Reuters): Pope Benedict said today that even the late Mother Teresa suffered from the silence of God despite her immense charity and faith.

 The Pope, addressing a youth rally in central Italy, referred to a new book that reveals that the Roman Catholic nun was deeply tormented about her faith and suffered periods of doubt about God.

 It is significant that the Pope mentioned Mother Teresas torment about Gods silence as not being unusual because there was some speculation that the letters could hurt the procedure to make her a saint. All believers know about the silence of God, he said in unprepared remarks. Even Mother Teresa, with all her charity and force of faith, suffered from the silence of God, he said.

 HK poll brush with openness

 Hong Kong, March 25 (Reuters): Hong Kong leader Donald Tsang today won five more years as chief executive in an election the loser called rigged, but which followed an unprecedented campaign that tested the limits of political openness in China.

 Tsangs win was expected due to his robust support from the Chinese leadership the determining factor when the 795-member electoral committee, stacked in Beijings favour, voted. Of 772 valid votes cast in the first contested election since the former British colony was handed back to China in 1997, Tsang took 649 and his opponent, Alan Leong, trailed with 123.

 Hong Kongs seven million people had no direct say.

 Upon winning, a visibly moved Tsang took several deep bows while supporters clapped. Electors from the democratic camp, meanwhile, chanted for universal suffrage in the next chief executive elections in 2012, highlighting a hot-button issue that is sure to dog Tsang in coming years.

 The process laid out a solid foundation for moving toward universal suffrage, said Tsang, who has vowed to produce a plan by 2012 for the introduction of democracy but has stopped short of saying it would be implemented by then. In a modest way, we have made history.

 Chinas central liaison office in Hong Kong, its foreign ministry and the Peoples Liberation Army garrison, congratulated Tsang and pledged support.

 Leong was the first opposition candidate on a pro-democracy ticket to qualify for a leadership election since the handover in 1997.

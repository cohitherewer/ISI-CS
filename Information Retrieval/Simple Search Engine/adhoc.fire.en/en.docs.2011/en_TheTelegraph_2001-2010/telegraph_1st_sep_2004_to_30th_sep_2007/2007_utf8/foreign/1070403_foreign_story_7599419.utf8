 Kuwait City, April 2 (AP): Kuwaits education minister took the oath of office in parliament today despite interruptions from Muslim fundamentalist lawmakers who believe she should cover her hair in the house.

 Nouria al-Sbeih, the countrys second female member of cabinet, continued to read the oath without heeding loud objections by several lawmakers who accused her of breaking the election law, which was amended in May 2005 to allow women to vote and run for office.

 When the house approved the law, fundamentalists who opposed womens political rights introduced a restrictive but vague article that required female politicians and voters to abide by Islamic rules.

 Scores of her female supporters in the gallery applauded as al-Sbeih in a black skirt-suit with large flower prints finished the oath.

 Many women in this conservative oil-rich state wear head scarves and long dresses, but the Islamic dress code is not mandatory.

 It was a law that parliament passed, how could you allow it to be broken? shouted fundamentalist lawmaker Deiffallah Bou Ramia. 

 Kuwait appointed its first-ever female member of cabinet, Massouma al-Mubarak, a month after the 50-seat house gave women the right to vote and participate in politics in 2005.

 Pervez aides in Dubai to seal pact

 Benazir, Musharraf 

 Islamabad, Sept. 4 (Reuters): Representatives of Pakistans embattled President Pervez Musharraf met former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in Dubai today in an effort to end a deadlock on a power-sharing pact, officials said.

 The talks focused on holding a parliamentary election later this year and on presidential powers to dismiss a government and dissolve parliament, a spokesman for Bhutto said.

 There has been some progress on the issue of holding of free and fair elections. There has been no progress on the issue about maintaining a balance in powers between the President and the parliament, said Bhutto spokesman Farhatullah Babar. With Musharrafs term as President and army chief coming to an end, and his opponents vowing to end his rule, Pakistan faces months of uncertainty.

 Two suicide bomb attacks in the city of Rawalpindi, where the army has its headquarters and Musharraf lives, killed 25 people today, underlining the prevailing insecurity. Musharraf and two-time Prime Minister Bhutto have been discussing a deal that would shore up his position before he seeks a second term in office and enable Bhutto to return home. 

 Bhutto, however, said at the weekend that the talks had stalled after fierce Opposition from Musharrafs ruling-party allies. She vowed to return to Pakistan even if there was no agreement. Musharraf is due to seek re-election as President in votes by national and provincial Assemblies between September 15 and October 15.

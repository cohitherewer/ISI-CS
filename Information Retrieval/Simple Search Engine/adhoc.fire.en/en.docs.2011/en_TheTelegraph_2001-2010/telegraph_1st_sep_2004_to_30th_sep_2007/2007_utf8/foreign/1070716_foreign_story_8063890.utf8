 Prince free album irks retailers

 Prince

 London, July 15 (Reuters): US rock star Prince today gave away his latest album free with a British tabloid to the fury of music retailers.

 The Minneapolis maverick, renowned for his run-ins with the music establishment, will also give away copies of Planet Earth at a series of London concerts starting next month.

 Paul Quirk, co-chairman of the Entertainment Retailers Association, said Princes decision to give away the album, which is not scheduled to go on sale until July 24, with copies of the The Mail on Sunday beggared belief.

 The Artist Formerly Known as Prince should know that with behaviour like this he will soon be the Artist Formerly Available in Record Stores, said Quirk in reference to the 1990s when the star stopped using his name.

 Its an insult to all those record stores who have supported Prince throughout his career, he said.

 The innovative funk artist, who has sold 80 million albums worldwide with ground-breaking works like Purple Rain, is unrepentant.

 Its direct marketing and I dont have to be in the speculation business of the record industry, which is going through a lot of tumultuous times right now, he said when asked why he was giving his music away. 

 A spokesperson for the singer told The Mail on Sunday: Princes only aim is to get music direct to those who want to hear it.

 Prince feels that charts are just music industry constructions and have little or no relevance to fans or even artists today.

 In an interview with last month, The Mail on Sunday managing director Stephen Miron said: No one has ever done this before. We have given away CDs and DVDs but this is just setting a new level.

 British retailer HMV clearly felt it was case of If you cant beat them, join them it is offering The Mail on Sunday for sale at its stores.

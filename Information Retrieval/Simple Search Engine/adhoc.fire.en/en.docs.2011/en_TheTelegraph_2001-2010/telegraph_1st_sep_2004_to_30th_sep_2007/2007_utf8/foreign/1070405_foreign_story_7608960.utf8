 Iran frees captives as gift to Britain

 Tehran, April 4 (Reuters): Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad freed 15 British sailors and Marines today, offering Britain a gift in a surprise announcement that ended a 13-day crisis which rattled world financial markets.

 Ahmadinejad told a news conference broadcast round the world he was willing to forgive the sailors, seized off the Shatt al-Arab waterway on March 23, even though Britain was not brave enough to admit it had made a mistake and they had strayed into Iranian territory.

 Under the influence of the Muslim Prophet, (Iran) forgives these 15 people and gives their freedom to the British people as a gift, Ahmadinejad said towards the end of the 90-minute news conference.

 Speaking later in Downing Street, British Prime Minister Tony Blair welcomed the sailors release and said Britain bore the Iranian people no ill will. Throughout we have taken a measured approach, firm but calm, not negotiating but not confronting either, he said.

 To the Iranian people I would simply say this: we bear you no ill will... The disagreements we have with your government we wish to resolve peacefully through dialogue.

 Ahmadinejads announcement, made with a dramatic flourish, pulled oil prices down from recent highs. 

 The dispute centred on where the Britons were when they were seized. Britain says they were in Iraqi waters on a routine UN mission. Tehran says they strayed into its territorial waters. 

 After his announcement, a smiling Ahmadinejad met several of the sailors, dressed in smart suits, shaking hands with them and exchanging a few words through an interpreter. We are very grateful for your forgiveness, one of the British sailors told a joking Ahmadinejad, who appeared to relish the moment of political theatre. I would like to thank yourself and the Iranian people. 

 The captives were expected to be taken to the British embassy in Tehran and an Iranian official source said they would leave the capital by plane tomorrow They were expected to arrive in Britain around 1100 GMT.

 The White House said President George W. Bush welcomed the release. Nick Summers, the brother of Nathan Summers, one of the captives, was jubilant. It is brilliant news. I am very happy with it, he told Sky News.

 Before making his announcement, Ahmadinejad awarded a medal to the naval commander who captured the sailors and strongly criticised Britain, making it look as if he might not free the Britons.

 Ahmadinejad also said he was willing to consider re-establishing ties with the US if that country changed its behaviour, but did not expand on his remark.

 The US said that if Iran wanted to change its relationship with Washington it would have to suspend uranium enrichment, part of its nuclear programme.

 Irans official news agency said Blairs adviser Nigel Sheinwald had spoken to Ali Larijani, secretary of Irans Supreme National Security Council, last night, breaking high-level diplomatic ice.

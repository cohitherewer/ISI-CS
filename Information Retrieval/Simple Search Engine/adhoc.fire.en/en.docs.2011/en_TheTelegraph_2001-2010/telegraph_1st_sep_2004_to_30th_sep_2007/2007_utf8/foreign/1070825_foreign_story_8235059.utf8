 Pak: Sharif can be arrested

 Sharif and Musharraf

 Islamabad, Aug. 24 (PTI): Pakistans attorney-general Malik Abdul Qayyum said former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is disqualified from contesting elections and he may even be arrested after he returns home from seven years in exile.

 Qayyum said Sharif cannot contest elections as the conviction in a plane hijack conspiracy case remained and the sentence awarded to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader was not pardoned but only remitted by President Pervez Musharraf. 

 The apex court had yesterday paved the way for Sharif to return to Pakistan politics.

 The top government lawyer said there was a difference between pardon and remission. If the President grants pardon, the conviction is abolished. However, in case of a remission, only the imprisonment is taken away. The confiscation of property remains intact with the stigma of conviction.

 Qayyum was quoted as saying by the Daily Times that Sharif is disqualified from contesting elections under Article 62 of the Constitution.

 Speaking to Geo TV channel, Qayyum said: Nawaz Sharif could be arrested on his arrival in the country.

 He did not elaborate on what grounds will Sharif be detained. But he said the supreme court has not restrained the government from arresting Sharif.

 The attorney-general said the court had only asked the government not to block his return.

 The Daily Times reported today that Sharif may return by the end of November after spending Ramzan in Saudi Arabia, where he stayed during exile.

 There were also reports attributed to PML-N officials that their leader will return to Pakistan in weeks, not months.

 However, a final decision on Sharifs return would be taken at the PML-N central executive committee meeting in the first week of November.

 A report in The Post said the family planned to send Sharifs younger brother Shahbaz first in order to build support.

 In his response to Musharrafs offer of a political reconciliation in Pakistan, Sharif said he is willing to consider any official initiative for a grand national reconciliation if the President makes it clear that he is not a candidate for any post. He should allow a level-playing field and invite everybody to come back home to sit across the table and resolve all matters among themselves, Sharif said.

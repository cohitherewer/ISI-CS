 Britain water ration

 Eversham, England, July 22 

 (Reuters): British water utility Severn Trent today 

 pleaded with customers living in central England to use 

 water carefully after one of its treatment works had to 

 be shut down because of flooding after torrential rain. 

 The companys Mythe Water Treatment Works in Tewkesbury, which also serves the towns of Gloucester and Cheltenham, was submerged by rising flood water and was evacuated in the early hours of today.

 Were urgently appealing to customers to use water sparingly and, in that way, help one another to make the remaining supplies last longer, Severn Trents director of water services Andy Smith said. He predicted the water shortage problem was unlikely to be resolved before Wednesday. 

 We must wait for the flood water to subside before we can begin to assess the damage done to equipment and machinery. Even when we are able to restart the works, it will take some time for the network and water supplies to return to normal.

 Were arranging for mini water tankers to be delivered to various sites across the towns affected to ensure that customers have access to water whilst we deal with the incident.

 Young guns in new House

 Kathmandu, Jan. 15: Mostly dressed in regulation gray suits popularised by their leaders Prachanda and Baburam Bhattarai, they came in ones and twos, walking side-by-side, overwhelmed by the TV cameras and the journalists who mobbed them. Their average age could not be more than 30. 

 These were the new Maoists MPs entering the Interim Nepalese Parliament which held its first historic meeting at well past 9 pm tonight. The session was dissolved after pro-tem Speaker, the oldest member of the House 86-year old Balbahadur Rai swore them in as MPs. 

 One could for the first time see the faces of real Nepal represented in Parliament. There were people from janjatis (tribals), people with mongoloid features, Madhesis from Terai in their dhoti-kurtas and gamchas, a large number of young women, representatives of those whose sons and husbands died in the decade long insurgency and Dalits. 

 There was even a disabled woman walking with a crutch since no one seemed to know the extent of her disability a special ramp had been built for her to enter Parliament in case she came on a wheel chair. 

 The Maoists in Parliament are led by Krishna Bahadur Mahara. Their MPs include central committee members like Dinanath Sharma, Dev Gurung, Matrika Yadav, Hisila Yami (married to Baburam Bhattarai), Khadga BK, Bamdev Chhetri, Janardan Sharma aka Prabhakar who was the Deputy Commander of the Peoples Liberation Army, and Jayapuri Gharti. 

 Among their 73 MPs, the Maoists have included 22 from the Janajatis (indigenous community), 21 Madhesis (Terai community), 28 women, 17 representing families of those killed in the insurgency and 11 from the Dalit community. 

 What was remarkable was the number of women and how young and confident they seemed. Most of them wore western suits jackets and trousers with no religious marks, which Nepalese are so fond of. Some wore gray salwar suits and others from Terai wore sarees. 

 Some had short hair like men and others had the hair neatly tied into buns. What was remarkable was that they were all camera shy. With self-conscious smiles, they accepted the handshakes and congratulations of the people gathered to welcome them. 

 Young Indrajit Tharu was one of the Maoist MPs trooping in. How did it feel to get into Parliament? I realise the seriousness of being in Parliament. But I also know that things will not happen automatically. We will have to struggle, he relied confidently. 

 I am very happy to enter Parliament, said Rai Padum, another Maoist MP from Bhojpur. He looked far too young to be an MP. Did he ever handle a gun or was he part of the political wing of the Maoists? I was the Brigade Commissar of the Peoples Liberation Army, he said with his eyes narrowing. 

 Once inside, it was all hugs and 

 handshakes not only among themselves but also with former 

 members of Parliament.

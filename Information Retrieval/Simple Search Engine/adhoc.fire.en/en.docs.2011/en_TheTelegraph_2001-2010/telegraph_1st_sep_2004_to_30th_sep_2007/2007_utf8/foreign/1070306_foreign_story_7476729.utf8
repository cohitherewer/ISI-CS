 Elvisghost voters in Papua polls

 Port Moresby (Papua New Guinea), March 5 (Reuters): The late Elvis Presley plans to be a ghost voter at the 2007 national elections in the jungle-clad South Pacific nation of Papua New Guinea if you believe the nations electoral rolls.

 In 2006 almost half of Papua New Guineas 4.9 million registered voters were regarded by the electoral commission as ghost voters. The commission has been trying for a year to update voter registration ahead of June 30 elections, but admits voter rolls in remote, rugged highland electorates remain vastly inaccurate.

 Electoral commissioner Andrew Trawen said ghost voters remained a problem with several Elvis Presleys, the US rocker who died in 1977, registering to vote, alongside a handful of Tom Jones. As of March, the countrys five highland provinces have voter registrations ranging from 116 per cent to 132 per cent, said the commission.

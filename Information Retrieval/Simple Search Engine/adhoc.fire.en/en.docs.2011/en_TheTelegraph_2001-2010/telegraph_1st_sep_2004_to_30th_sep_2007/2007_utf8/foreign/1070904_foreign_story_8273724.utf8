 Sharif vow

 London, Sept. 3 (Reuters): Exiled former Pakistani leader Nawaz Sharif vowed to fight terrorism with conviction if re-elected Prime Minister and accused military ruler President Pervez Musharraf of deceiving the West over his commitment.

 Sharif, who was overthrown by Musharraf in a bloodless coup in 1999, plans to return to Islamabad next week to challenge the President, who is under pressure from the West to stand down as head of the army before seeking re-election in the coming weeks.

 When I was Prime Minister we extended full cooperation to everybody ... We condemn all kinds of terrorism ... and well continue to fight terrorism, Sharif said in an interview.

 If you fight this menace, you fight out of conviction. Musharraf needs the threat of terror for his own survival. He is doing something in Pakistan and he is telling something else to the outside world. I think he is hoodwinking the West, he said.

 Analysts say the US is believed to have doubts about Sharifs commitment to fighting militancy largely because of his sympathies for Islamist parties. 

 Sharif, 57, was Prime Minister for two terms in the 1990s.

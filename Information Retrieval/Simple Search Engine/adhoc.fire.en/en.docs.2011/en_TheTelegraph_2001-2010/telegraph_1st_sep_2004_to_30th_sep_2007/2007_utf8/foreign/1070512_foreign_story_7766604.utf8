The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Pasadena news from India

 Pasadena (California), May 11 (AP): The job posting was puzzling: We seek a newspaper journalist based in India to report on the city government and political scene of Pasadena, California, USA.

 A reporter half a world away covering local street-light contracts and sewer repairs? A reporter who has never got closer to Pasadena than the telecast of the Rose Bowl parade? Outsourcing first claimed manufacturing jobs, then hit services such as technical support, airline reservations and tax preparation. Now comes the next frontier: local journalism. 

 James Macpherson, editor and publisher of the two-year-old website pasadenanow.com, acknowledged it sounds strange to have journalists in India cover news in this wealthy city just outside Los Angeles. But he said it can be done from afar now that weekly Pasadena City Council meetings can be watched over the Internet. And he said the idea makes business sense because of Indias lower labour costs.

 I think it could be a significant way to increase the quality of journalism on the local level without the expense that is a major problem for local publications, said the 51-year-old Pasadena native. Whether youre at a desk in Pasadena or a desk in Mumbai, youre still just a phone call or email away from the interview

 The first articles, some of which will carry bylines, are slated to appear today. The plan has its doubters.

 Nobody in their right mind would trust the reporting of people who not only dont know the institutions but arent even there to witness the events and nuances, said Bryce Nelson, a University of Southern California journalism professor and Pasadena resident. This is a truly sad picture of what American journalism could become.

 Hi-tech students stay out of reach

 Digital disconnect

 Washington, March 4: College students now are wired, wireless, Sidekicked, Facebooked, YouTubed and bleeping with instant messages and text messages. But try getting an important announcement out to everyone on campus.

 Its the flip side of all the technology: Students are more connected than ever but surprisingly tricky for administrators to reach. Land lines are all but obsolete. Cellphone numbers are slippery. And email gets lost, overlooked, erased or ignored.

 Everyone is hoping theres not some emergency where they cant get in touch with students, said Gwendolyn Dungy of the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators.

 At Virginia Tech, a police search for a gunman on the first day of the fall semester left administrators scrambling to warn tens of thousands of people to stay inside. That was a very clear indicator that the ways that we reach students are changing, that we have to stay ahead of the curve, spokesman Mark Owczarski said

 School officials are more worried about this now because in the past we didnt have so many options, Dungy said. They had telephones land lines and they used them. Now, with so many options, people are trying to find the ultimate, the sure-fire. And there is no sure-fire today.

 Every school has a crisis plan, especially since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Parents assume that their children can be reached immediately. But although parents usually have their childrens cell numbers programmed on their phones, most school officials dont.

 And technology changes so quickly that by the time the bureaucracy at the institution is up to speed, Dungy said, something new has come out and the students have moved on to it.

 Schools across the country are experimenting with a bewildering array of tactics to contact students. And everyones watching for the next big thing something simple that would work.

 Its not that students dont have the tools; nearly every single one has a cellphone, and most have laptops. But they dont use them the way administrators do.

 Take email. Its a cheap, easy and instantaneous way to blast a message across the quad. Most faculty and staff rely on email for both business and personal messages. But for many students, its an afterthought.

 Some rarely use email; with friends, its quicker to instant-message or Facebook or call. Others check email often but dont get to the official messages in their overstuffed inboxes.

 Students at Trinity University in this district often ignore their campus e-mail accounts, president Patricia McGuire said. Mailboxes fill up they dont answer anything. At the end of the semester, IT has to go in and empty everything. Its a mess, its really a mess.

 It is a worry, said Betsy Muhlenfeld, president of Sweet Briar College. Its just ironic that here we are with more gadgets than any of us need and we find it more difficult rather than less so, she said.

 Ryan Briers email inbox is bulging with announcements from George Washington University. I try my best to sort through the subject lines, but definitely some emails have fallen through the cracks, he said.

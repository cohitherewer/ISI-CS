 Delay return: Govt tells Hasina

 Dhaka, April 12 (AP): The Bangladesh government has asked former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to delay her return from a visit to the US, a spokesman for her party said today.

 Abdul Jalil, general secretary of Hasinas Awami League party, said the former Prime Minister might not come back to Bangladesh on April 23 as scheduled because a senior government official called to ask her to delay her return. Jalil did not say who phoned Hasina

 The government said it needs time to look into the charge, Jalil said. Hasina and 45 members of the Awami League-led political alliance were charged yesterday for their alleged involvement in the killings of four Jamaat-e-Islami activists during riots in Dhaka in October last year.

 The Jamaat-e-Islami is allied with Hasinas bitter rival, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia.

 The riots erupted after Zia ended her five-year term and handed over power to an interim government to prepare for parliamentary elections.

 Hasina, who was Prime Minister from 1996 to 2001, has called the charge against Hasina as an attempt to intimidate her. The Awami League chief said she will not be deterred from returning to Bangladesh from the US, where she was visiting her children.

 The former Prime Minister was originally scheduled to return on April 23, but after the charges were made public, Hasina told the BBC she was looking to come back home early and am already looking for a ticket.

 Jalil would not set a new date for Hasinas return to Bangladesh. She talked to the BBC from Virginia.

 The government will not arrest Hasina unless the charge is proved, a government spokesman said.

 She went abroad on her own and she can return whenever she wants, said M. A. Matin, who heads an official committee to deal with serious crimes.

 Hasina said yesterday that nothing could deter her return. Months of street fighting between supporters of Hasina and Zia left more than 30 people dead until a military-backed interim government imposed a state of emergency in January, cancelled parliamentary elections and banned all political activity.

 Police also charged the head of Jamaat-e-Islami, Matiur Rahman Nizami, and nine of his colleagues with the death of an activist from Hasinas alliance in the same riot, local television station Bangla Vision reported.

 On Monday, Hasina was accused of demanding a bribe from a businessman to allow his company to build a power plant in 1998.

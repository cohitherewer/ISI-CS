 Obama presidential bid begins

 Springfield (Illinois), Feb. 10 (Reuters): Democrat Barack Obama launched his 2008 White House run today with a pledge to end the war in Iraq and bridge the partisan divide that has blocked political progress on issues from energy to health care.

 I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States of America, Obama, the only black US senator, said outside the old state capitol building where Abraham Lincoln began his fight against slavery with a famous 1858 speech that declared a house divided against itself cannot stand.

 Obama, 45, a rising party star who would be the first black US President if elected, told a cheering crowd of supporters that the US had overcome many difficult challenges, from gaining independence to the civil war.

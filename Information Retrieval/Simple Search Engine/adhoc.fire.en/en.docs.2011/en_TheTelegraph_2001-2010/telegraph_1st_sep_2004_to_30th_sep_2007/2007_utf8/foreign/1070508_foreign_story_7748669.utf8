 Fine Print

 Super strip

 Mexico City, May 7 (AP): More than 18,000 people stripped down and bared it all in Mexico Citys vast main square for US photographer Spencer Tunicks biggest nude shoot yet.

 Standing up to salute, crouching in foetal positions and lying prone on the tiles of the Zocalo plaza, the volunteers formed a sea of flesh yesterday that Tunick snapped from balconies and a small crane in the morning light. What a moment for the Mexican art scene! Tunick said in a news conference. 

 Wild Briton

 London (Reuters): A British man who went on a wild spending spree after doctors said he only had a short time to live wants compensation because the diagnosis was wrong and he is now healthy but broke. John Brandrick, 62, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer two years ago and told that he would probably die within a year. He quit his job, sold or gave away nearly all his possessions, stopped paying his mortgage and spent his savings dining out and going on holiday. Brandrick was left with little more than the black suit, white shirt and red tie that he had planned to be buried in when it emerged a year later that his suspected tumour was no more than a non-life threatening inflammation of the pancreas. 

 Kevin baby

 Los Angeles (AP): Its a boy for Kevin Costner and wife Christine. Cayden Wyatt Costner weighed about 3.5 kg when he was born at 10.30 pm on Sunday at an undisclosed Los Angeles area hospital, Costner publicist Paul Bloch said on Monday. Both mother and son are doing well, Bloch said, adding the baby has dark hair. There were no other details. Costner, 52, and his 33-year-old wife married in September 2004. Cayden Wyatt is the actors fifth child and the first for Christine Costner, Bloch said. Costner, who most recently starred with Ashton Kutcher in The Guardian, won an Oscar for directing in 1980 for Dances With Wolves. 

 Angry lift

 Oslo (AP): Two young Norwegian vandals overlooked a small but crucial detail when they started smashing up a train station elevator: They were inside it. And the elevator at the Lillestroem Train Station, north of Oslo, almost seemed to be of the vengeful sort, sealing its doors and holding the two for the police, making news in Norway on Monday after a local newspaper learned of the incident.

 Lightning iPod scare

 Boston, July 12 (Reuters): Heres a handy tip for joggers: If you think you might get caught in a thunderstorm, leave your music player at home.

 Doctors at a Vancouver, Canada, hospital said a jogger wearing an iPod was burned on his chest, neck and face after the man was struck by lightning in 2005. The burns traced the path of the earphones, they said.

 The patients eardrums were ruptured and the tiny bones in his middle ears were dislocated, the doctors said. His jawbone broke in four places and both jaw joints were dislocated, probably because the electric current made his jaw muscles contract violently.

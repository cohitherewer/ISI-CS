 Dhaka, Jan. 27 (PTI): Bangladeshs stringent new emergency laws with curbs on the media and political activities came into effect yesterday even as the countrys electoral future remained in limbo.

 The 18-party alliance led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajeds Awami League hailed the emergency laws while her arch-rival Khaleda Zias four-party combine was guarded in its reaction.

 A state of emergency was imposed two weeks ago by President Iajuddin Ahmed. However, Fakhruddin Ahmeds caretaker government made some changes to allow maximum freedom under emergency situations. According to the home ministry, President Ahmed approved the rules.

 Provocative activities, including meeting, gathering, procession... Blockade, strike, lockout and other functions of political parties, trade unions... have been suspended until further orders or until the state of emergency, proclaimed on January 11 across the country, is withdrawn, the laws said.

 According to the laws, anyone who breaks the new restrictions or the ban on political rallies faces five years in jail.

 Any person who breaks these rules can face a maximum five years and a minimum two years of rigorous imprisonment along with fines, the home ministry said.

 The government, widely seen as being backed by the military, can restrict publication or broadcast of any anti-government articles, cartoons or discussion in print or electronic media under the rules, the notice said.

 The Awami League and its ally the Jatiya Party welcomed the the emergency, saying they supported whatever measures the government took to hold the elections in a free and fair manner.

 We do not have any reservation against such rules, if imposed with a good motive. We do not need to enforce blockade or stage demonstration at the moment, he said.

 However, Khaledas rival BNP and ally Jamaat-e-Islami said they would make stance public after studying the laws in detail.

 Jamaat secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojahid said: It seems to me that there is no restriction on indoor political activities. We, however, will express our reaction after thoroughly examining the rules.

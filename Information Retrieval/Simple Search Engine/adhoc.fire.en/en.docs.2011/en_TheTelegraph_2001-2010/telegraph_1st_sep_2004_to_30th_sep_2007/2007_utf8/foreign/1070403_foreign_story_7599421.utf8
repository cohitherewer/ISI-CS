 Pressure to be thin: Duff

 Hurtful

 New York, April 2 (AP): Teen starlet Hilary Duff claims she has never had a problem with her weight, but feels pressure to be thin.

 The 19-year-old actress and singer told People magazine that she is either perceived as too fat or too thin in the media, which she says can be judgmental and mean.

 And if you dont like the way you look or feel insecure, when people say things about you in magazines or just in everyday life they can be hurtful... But youll never make them happy, she told the magazine.

 Duff, who has sold more than 13 million albums worldwide, has a new album out April 3 called Dignity.

 Brazil to break Merck AIDS patent, favour India

 Lula da Silva: Bold move

 Brasilia, May 4 (Reuters): President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva signed a decree today authorising Brazil to break the patent on an AIDS drug made by Merck amp; Co Inc and import a generic version from India instead.

 It is the first time Brazil has bypassed a patent to acquire cheaper drugs for its AIDS prevention programme, although it has threatened to do so before to force drug makers to lower prices.

 Talks over the price of Mercks drug, Efavirenz, broke off yesterday when the health ministry rejected the New Jersey-based companys offer to cut its price, $1.59 per pill, by 30 per cent. Brazil wanted to pay what Merck charges Thailand, or $0.65 per pill.

 Brazils health ministry has said it plans to import a generic version of Efavirenz from India, paying about 45 cents per pill, and also start making its own copy of the drug.

 The compulsory licensing of Efavirenz is a legitimate and necessary measure to guarantee that all patients have access to the drug, Lulas office said.

 At a ceremony in the presidential palace, Lula was applauded by representatives of some 200,000 AIDS patients who receive state-sponsored antiretroviral therapy in Brazil.

 Merck said it was profoundly disappointed by the decision of the government of Brazil and called it an expropriation of intellectual property.

 Developing countries such as Brazil, India and Thailand are allowed to bypass patents on drugs deemed critical to public health under WTO patent rules.

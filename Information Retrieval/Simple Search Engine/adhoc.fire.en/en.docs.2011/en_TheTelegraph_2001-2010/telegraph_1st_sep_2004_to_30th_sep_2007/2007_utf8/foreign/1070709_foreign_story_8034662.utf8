 DellOlio: Peace initiative 

Blair

 London, July 8: In an entrance every bit as arresting as her famous arrival at Downing Street, Nancy DellOlio has teamed up with Tony Blair in an effort to bring peace to West Asia.

 DellOlio, who raised eyebrows by wearing a daring red catsuit to Number 10 in 2002, has spent much of her time in Britain worrying about the whereabouts of her errant boyfriend, Sven-Goran Eriksson.

 Now, however, she has struck up a working relationship with one of the most eligible figures in international politics. The unlikely pair have held several meetings, with DellOlio lobbying Blair in her capacity as founder of Truce International, a charity that promotes peace through football in war-torn areas of the world. 

 The warm relationship that has developed was apparent last week when DellOlio surprised guests at a party thrown by The Spectator magazine by gushing about the former UK Prime Minister and describing how she was looking forward to working with him now that he was an envoy working on behalf of the US, Russia, the UN and the European Union.

 As UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown met revellers in one corner, DellOlio was busy telling people that she thought it wonderful that Blair was moving on now and can do what he really wants to do.

 Last night DellOlio told The Sunday Telegraph: I have always been a great admirer of Tony Blair as a statesman, and if there was an opportunity for us to work together with my organisation towards peace in the Middle East I would welcome it.

 A friend of the lawyer, who moved to Britain from Italy with Eriksson following his appointment as England coach in 2001, went further.

 Blair is very fond of her, he said. From his point of view, hes going to need a popular project to try to make his mark and Nancy is hoping he will be able to use his influence to persuade member states to honour their obligations.

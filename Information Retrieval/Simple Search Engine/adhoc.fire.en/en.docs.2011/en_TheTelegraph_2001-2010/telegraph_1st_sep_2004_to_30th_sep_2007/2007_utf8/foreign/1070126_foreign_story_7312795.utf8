 No London ban on thin models

 Brazilian model Ana Carolina Reston, who died of causes linked to the eating disorder anorexia nervosa

 London, Jan. 25 (AP): Organisers of London Fashion Week said today that they would not ban ultra-thin models from the catwalk, but stressed they had asked designers to use only healthy people in their shows.

 The British Fashion Council said barring stick-thin models as Madrid and Milan fashion weeks have done is neither desirable nor enforceable.

 The council, a consortium of major fashion retailers and publishers that oversees Londons twice-yearly fashion weeks, said it recognised its responsibility to help promote a healthy body image.

 We have asked designers, model agencies and image makers to respect this responsibility and to use only healthy models for their collections. Additionally, we recommend that only models aged 16 or over are used, the council said.

 We believe that regulation is neither desirable nor enforceable. What will make a difference is the commitment of the fashion industry to change attitudes through behaviour and education.

 The council said it was setting up a task force to create new guidelines for the fashion industry.

 The debate over waif-like models has intensified in the past year as many models and celebrities appear increasingly thin.

 In September, Madrids Fashion Week, the Pasarela Cibeles, announced it was banning models with a Body Mass Index, or height-to-weight ratio, below 18. A 175-cm model weighing 57 kg would have a BMI of 18. Milans fashion week also tightened its restrictions on underweight models.

 The issue made headlines again in November, when 21-year-old Brazilian model Ana Carolina Reston died of causes linked to the eating disorder anorexia nervosa.

 A British cabinet minister who previously called for ultra-thin models to be banned backed the fashion councils call for self-regulation.

 I urge strongly the designers taking part to support this, said culture secretary Tessa Jowell.

 Too many teenage girls try to starve themselves into unhealthy thinness, at great risk to their health. 

 The fashion industry is hugely powerful in shaping the attitudes of young women and their feelings about themselves.

 Teenage girls aspire to look like their role models. If their role models are healthy it will help inspire girls to be the same.

 Designers including Betty Jackson, Nicole Farhi and Julien Macdonald are due to showcase their autumn/winter collections at London Fashion Week beginning on February 12.

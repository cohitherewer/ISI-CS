 Malay monitor

 Kuala Lumpur, June 11 (AP): Government employees in a Malaysian state are being monitored by security cameras to keep them from slacking off at work or vanishing for long tea breaks, a news report said today.

 Sixteen closed-circuit television cameras were installed recently to improve security in northeastern Terengganu states main government administrative complex, but they serve an additional purpose of keeping tabs on some 1,000 workers there, Terengganu state secretary Mokhtar Nong told The Star newspaper.

 We would know if they are adhering to office etiquette or playing truant, and we can also gauge if they are disciplined at work, Mokhtar said, adding that another 26 cameras will be set up soon.

 Ricky blaze

 New York (AP): New Yorks Fifth Avenue pulsed with music and blazed with colour on Sunday as tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans gathered for the 50th anniversary of the parade that celebrates their island. Pop star Ricky Martin, named king of the parade, joined Mayor Michael Bloomberg for a ceremonial ribbon cutting before ascending a float that promoted the Ricky Martin Foundation, which advocates child welfare around the world. Fans screamed as the float made its way up the avenue. 

 Wander art

 Berlin (Reuters): A Chinese artist will bring 1,001 of his compatriots to Germany to spend months wandering around the city of Kassel as live-exhibits for his entry to a leading modern art show. Ai WeiWeis Fairytale artwork will cost 3.1 million euros ($4.14 million), the most expensive project of this years documenta exhibition, a spokesman for the event said. The live-exhibits will have no set programme or commitments during their stay although they will be encouraged to visit the citys sights.

 Cool Ocean

 Los Angeles (Reuters): The all-star caper film Oceans Thirteen made off with $37.1 million in ticket sales during its opening weekend to steal the number one spot at the North American box office, according to studio estimates on Sunday. The Friday to Sunday tally for the latest Oceans sequel, returning George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Bernie Mac to the scene of their first heist, Las Vegas, was roughly on par with the debut gross of the first two films in the series. Oceans Thirteen is the third film to team Clooney and company with director Steven Soderbergh.

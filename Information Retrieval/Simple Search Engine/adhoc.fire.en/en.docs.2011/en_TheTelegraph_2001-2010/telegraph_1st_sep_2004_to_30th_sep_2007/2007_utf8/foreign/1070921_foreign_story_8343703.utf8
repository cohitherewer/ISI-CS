 Osama vows to retaliate against Musharraf

Dubai, Sept. 20 (Reuters): 

 Al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden has vowed to retaliate against 

 infidel Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf 

 for the killing of a rebel cleric and a raid on his mosque 

 in July, in a Web audiotape issued today.

 We in al Qaida organisation call on God to witness that we will retaliate for the blood of ... Abdul Rashid Ghazi and those with him against Musharraf and those who help him, and for all the pure and innocent blood, said the speaker on the recording who sounded like bin Laden.

 So Pervez, his ministers, his soldiers and those who help him are all accomplices in spilling the blood of ... Muslims. He who helps him knowingly and willingly is an infidel like him, bin Laden said.

 It is obligatory (under Islam) for Muslims in Pakistan to carry out jihad and fighting to remove Pervez, his government, his army and those who help him, he said. More than 100 of Ghazis followers were killed in an assault on the Lal Masjid, a mosque and school complex. 

 The group is sympathetic to the Taliban, who were removed from power in Afghanistan by US-led forces.

 Bin Ladens audiotape, issued by al Qaidas media arm As-Sahab, was part of a 23-minute video which carried an English translation of his remarks and showed old footage of him and other figures of his movement. The tape could not be authenticated, but it was posted on the main Islamist websites.

 Earlier today, al Qaidas second-in-command Ayman al-Zawahri called on Muslims to fight the US and its allies around the world, in a new video.

 Marking the sixth anniversary of the September 11 attacks, Zawahri said: Stand, nation of Islam, under the victorious banner of the Prophet ... and campaign against the crusader banner of ( President George W.) Bush.

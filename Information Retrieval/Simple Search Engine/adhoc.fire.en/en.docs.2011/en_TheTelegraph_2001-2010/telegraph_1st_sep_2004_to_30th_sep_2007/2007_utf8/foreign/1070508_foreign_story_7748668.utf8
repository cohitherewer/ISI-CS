 Jail term may make Paris more popular

 - It will increase her star appeal

 Paris Hilton is so pampered she doesnt read her mail. I have people who do that for me, she told a judge. Legal documents and traffic citations elude her.

 I just sign what people tell me to sign, she testified.

 And based on statements from Hilton and publicist Elliot Mintz who announced yesterday that he will no longer be working for her she apparently took legal advice from Mintz but not her lawyers.

 Facing a 45-day jail sentence and perhaps her first brush with accountability could be a reality check for Hilton. But regardless of how she handles it, it may make her more popular than ever.

 It will actually increase her star appeal in a very sick and demented way, said longtime publicist Michael Levine. 

 Theres a segment of our society thats somehow engaged in the soap opera that is Paris Hilton, and this a very compelling plot line in the soap opera.

 A judge ordered the socialite to report to a county jail in suburban Los Angeles by June 5 to serve 45 days for violating the terms of her probation in an alcohol-related reckless driving case. Her attorney has said he will appeal.

 Mintz said yesterday that he and Hilton had parted ways over an apparent misunderstanding she received from me regarding the terms of her probation. He said Hilton was being truthful when she told a judge she believed incorrectly, it turned out that it was OK for her to drive under certain circumstances under the terms.

 The 26-year-old hotel heiress, who parlayed her party lifestyle into worldwide fame, told the judge on Friday that she didnt have time to talk with her attorneys about her probation. That dismissive attitude is part of her appeal, said veteran publicist David Brokaw.

 The premise of her fame is being naughty, he said. This is a career move for her. It simply fuels the fascination. She can only win with this.

 Hilton made her first public comments on the sentence to photographers assembled outside her home on Saturday night. I feel that I was treated unfairly and that the sentence is both cruel and unwarranted and I dont deserve this, she said as she left for a shopping trip with her mother.

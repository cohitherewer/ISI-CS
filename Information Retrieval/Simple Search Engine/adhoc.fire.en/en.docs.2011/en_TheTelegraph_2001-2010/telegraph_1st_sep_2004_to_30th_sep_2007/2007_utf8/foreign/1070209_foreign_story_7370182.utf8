 Kathmandu, Feb. 8: Hours after Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala agreed to increase electoral seats for the Madhesis in the coming Constituent Assembly elections, the Madhesi Peoples Rights Forum (MPRF) today suspended its agitation across the Terai region for 10 days. 

 Speaking at a news conference today, MPRF chairman Upendra Yadav said their decision to suspend the agitation was aimed at creating a conducive atmosphere for talks with the government. The Prime Ministers announcement is a victory for the people of Terai. However, he failed to address our other demands, including regional autonomy, he said.

 Yadav said that his party would organise peaceful demonstrations to push for regional autonomy. 

 The Madhesi leader also urged Koirala to launch an investigation into the deaths of 21 persons who died during the fortnight-long protests in the Terai region. 

 The violence was started by the killing of a MPRF activist by Maoist cadres in Lahan on January 19.

 The violence spread to other Terai districts after Maoists forced family members of the dead activist to cremate the body. 

 Last night, the eight political parties, including the Maoists, pledged to provide an equal number of seats for the region on the basis of proportional representation in the Assembly. 

 Koirala addressed the nation around midnight and said that the interim constitution would be amended to include the demands of the Madhesis. 

 He said according to the agreement, 20 districts in the southern strip bordering India with 48.4 per cent of the countrys population would now get 49 per cent seats in the Constituent Assembly.

 Fifty one per cent of the seats would be divided among the 55 Himalayan districts.

 Chocoholics like drug addicts

 NIC FLEMING

 Deadly desire

 London, Aug. 29: Brain changes in chocoholics that occur when they see or eat chocolate are similar to those in addicts when they take drugs, scientists say.

 British researchers found certain regions of the brain were more active when people who confessed to cravings were fed or shown pictures of chocolate than in non-cravers. 

 They also discovered the sight of chocolate contributed significantly to the activation of brain areas associated with reward suggesting that dieters could cut their intake by avoiding the sight of foods they particularly desire. 

 Edmund Rolls and Ciara McCabe at the University of Oxfords experimental psychology department carried out functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) imaging on the brains of eight chocoholics and eight non-cravers. 

 The volunteers were shown appetising pictures of chocolate and then fed liquid chocolate while having fMRI scans. Among chocolate cravers, greater activity was seen in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, pregenual cingulated cortex and ventral striatum regions of the brain known to be involved in pleasure sensation, habit-forming behaviours and drug addiction. Damage to the orbitofrontal cortex acquired through brain injury has previously been associated with compulsive gambling.

 Electing Sarkozy risky: Royal

 Paris, May 4 (Reuters): Socialist opponent Segolene Royal said today that France risks violence and brutality if her opponent Right-winger Nicolas Sarkozy wins Sundays presidential election.

 On the last day of official campaigning, opinion polls showed Sarkozy enjoyed a commanding lead over Royal, who accused the former interior minister of lying.

 Choosing Nicolas Sarkozy would be a dangerous choice, Royal told RTL radio.

 It is my responsibility today to alert people to the risk of (his) candidature with regards to the violence and brutality that would be unleashed in the country (if he won), she said.

 Pressed on whether there would be actual violence, Royal said: I think so, I think so, referring specifically to Frances volatile suburbs hit by widespread rioting in 2005.

 Royal went on the offensive during a fiery television debate between the two last night when Sarkozy questioned whether she was cool enough to become Frances first woman president.

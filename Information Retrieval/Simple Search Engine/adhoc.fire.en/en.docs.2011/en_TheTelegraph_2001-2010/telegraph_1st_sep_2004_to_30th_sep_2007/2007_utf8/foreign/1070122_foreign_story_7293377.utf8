 Fresh clashes in Nepal

 J. HEMANTH

 Kathmandu, Jan. 21: Life came to a standstill all over Nepal today with transporters who were affected by sectarian violence in the eastern part of the country calling an indefinite strike. 

 The National Federation of Nepal Transport Entrepreneurs called for the nationwide strike after agitators torched public transport vehicles in Lahan town of Siraha district along the Nepal-India border on Friday. 

 The attackers were members of the Madhesi Janadhikar Forum, who were protesting against the death of a 17-year-old boy in Maoist firing a day earlier. 

 The situation in Siraha district has been tense ever since the activists went on the rampage. They attacked vehicles belonging to the UN and National Human Rights Commission yesterday and burnt offices of the government and Maoists in Lahan today. 

 Chirajivi Adhikari, a local official, said the Siraha district authorities were forced to impose a daylong curfew after todays clash. 

 Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala has called an all-party meeting tomorrow morning to discuss the situation in Lahan. 

 Top leaders of the eight parties, including the CPN-Maoists, will attend the meeting at the Prime Ministers official residence, CPN-UML leader Bharat Mohan Dhikari said. 

 The government suspects that royalists could be fanning the violence to scuttle the June election that will decide on the status of the monarchy.

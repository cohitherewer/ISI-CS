 B-52? Pack me one

 A B-52 bomber: Astounding offer

Moscow, Aug. 24 (Reuters): A wealthy Russian tried to buy a US B-52 bomber from a group of shocked American pilots at an airshow near Moscow, a Russian newspaper reported today.

 The unidentified Russian, wearing sunglasses and surrounded by bodyguards, approached the US delegation and asked to buy the bomber, the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper said.

 An astounded member of the US delegation said the bomber was not for sale but that it would cost at least $500 million if it were to be sold on the spot.

 That is no problem. It is such a cool machine, the Russian was quoted as saying by the newspaper, which said its reporter overheard the conversation. The bomber was not sold.

 Russias new rich, who built fantastic fortunes trading commodities and contacts after the fall of the Soviet Union, have made a name for themselves as ostentatious purchasers of everything from British football clubs to Faberge eggs.

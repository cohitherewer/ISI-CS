 Kylie style

 Stockholm, March 2 (Reuters): Swedish clothing giant Hennes amp; Mauritz said today Australian pop queen Kylie Minogue will be the face of a new beachwear campaign, adding to a list of fashion and music stars who have worked with the firm.

 Kylie, known for songs such as I Should Be So Lucky, follows in the footsteps of Material Girl Madonna, who has designed an H amp;M clothing line, and fashion icons such as Karl Lagerfeld and Stella McCartney.

 When we think of Australia and glamour, we think Kylie, who is such a stylish person, H amp;M design head Margareta van den Bosch said. 

 Potter role

 London (Reuters): British actor Daniel Radcliffe has signed up for the final two films in the seven-part Harry Potter series, his spokeswoman said on Friday. The 17-year-old, who has just won rave reviews for his performance in Peter Shaffers controversial play Equus, will start filming the sixth movie based on the bestselling books by J.K. Rowling in September, she added. Radcliffe shot to fame in 2001 when he appeared as the boy wizard in the first Harry Potter film.

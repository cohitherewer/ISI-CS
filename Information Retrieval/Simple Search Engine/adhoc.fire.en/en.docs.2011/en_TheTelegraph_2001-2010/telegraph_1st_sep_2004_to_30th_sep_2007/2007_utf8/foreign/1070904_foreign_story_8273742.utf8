 Files show MI5 had benign view of Orwell

 London, Sept. 3 (AP): George Orwells Left-wing views and bohemian clothes led British police to label him a communist but the MI5 spy agency stepped in to correct that view, the writers newly released security file reveals.

 The secret file the intelligence agency kept on the author from 1929 until his death in 1950 was declassified on Tuesday by the National Archives.

 It reveals that Britains real-life Big Brother had a surprisingly benign view of the writer, a socialist who railed against inequality in Down and Out in Paris and London and The Road to Wigan Pier but also savaged the totalitarianism of Stalins Russia in Animal Farm and 1984.

 In 1942, Orwell drew police interest again while he was working for the Indian section of the BBC. A report by the British police intelligence wing, Special Branch, said Orwell had advanced communist views, and several of his Indian friends say they have often seen him at communist meetings. 

 The file shows that MI5 took no action against Orwell. In a note, an MI5 officer named W. Ogilvie reveals that he phoned Special Branch to ask why Ewing had described Orwell as having advanced Communist views.

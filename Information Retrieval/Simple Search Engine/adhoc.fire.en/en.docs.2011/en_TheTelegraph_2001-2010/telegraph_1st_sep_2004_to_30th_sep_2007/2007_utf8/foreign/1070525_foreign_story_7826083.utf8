 Keira wins thin slur damages

 Deeply offended

 London, May 24 (Reuters): British actress Keira Knightley, star of the Pirates of the Caribbean film trilogy, today won 3,000 ($5,965) in libel damages over a newspaper slur that she was excessively thin.

 The Daily Mail had run a story with a picture of her in a bikini, headlined: If Pictures Like This One of Keira Carried a Health Warning, My Darling Daughter Might Have Lived.

 The article could be interpreted to have asserted that the claimant bore personal responsibility for causing the tragic death of Sophie Mazurek, a 19-year-old, who battled with anorexia, Knightleys lawyer Simon Smith told the high court.

 The 22-year-old actress had been embarrassed by the entirely false and deeply offensive suggestions.

 He added the story could be taken to mean that the actress had set out to lose an excessive amount of weight by failing to eat properly and by over-exercising inappropriately because she wanted to become unnaturally thin.

 Three days earlier the paper had published an article under the headline Its Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Keira Knightley in which it referred to her denial that she suffered from anorexia.

 Smith told the judge, Justice David Eady, that Knightley accepted that she had undergone weight training for roles in action films and that this had involved muscle toning which did alter physical appearance.

 However, he said her weight had never fluctuated more than a few pounds through her adult life, and remained at an acceptable level which took into account age, gender and height.

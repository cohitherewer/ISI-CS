 Poll chief frowns on Pervez

 Musharraf

 Islamabad, July 1 (PTI): Pakistans chief election commissioner has said it was not appropriate for President Pervez Musharraf to address public meetings as it would tantamount to dabbling in politics.

 Justice (retd) Qazi Mohammad Farooqs reservations were apparently based on his belief that Musharraf, who continues to be army chief, should not be associated with political parties.

 It was not appropriate for the man holding the countrys top office to address public meetings, Farooq was quoted as saying by the Daily Times.

 The remarks by the CEC, who till now has been accused by Opposition parties of not asserting himself enough to hold free and fair elections, were directed at a spate of public meetings of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Q (PML-Q) addressed by Musharraf in the recent past.

 Farooq, after a meeting with the Islamist alliance Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal (MMA) yesterday, also expressed hope that a code of conduct would soon be formulated in consultation with political parties to ensure free and fair polls.

 Any proactive stand by the CEC on Musharraf taking part in poll campaigning ahead of elections could dent the prospects of the PML-Q as the President is regarded as the ruling alliances main leader capable of countering the opposition campaign.

 Deputy secretary and senior leader of Jamaat-e-Islami, Liaqat Baloch told the media after his meeting with Farooq that the CEC has objected to Musharrafs public meetings.

 Baloch said it was not enough for Farooq to raise objections and he should take action against Musharraf for violating rules.

 He said Musharraf addressing public meetings of the ruling PML-Q was akin to pre-poll rigging.

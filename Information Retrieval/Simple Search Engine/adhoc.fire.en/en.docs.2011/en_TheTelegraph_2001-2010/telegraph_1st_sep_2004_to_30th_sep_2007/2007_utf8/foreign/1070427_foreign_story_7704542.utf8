 Putin slams US foreign policy

 Moscow, April 26 (Reuters): Russian President Vladimir Putin attacked US foreign policy and urged a revival of traditional values today in a hawkish speech that laid out a route for Russia to follow long after he steps down next year.

 Making his last annual address to lawmakers, Putin said he was suspending Russias commitments under the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty and linked the move in part to US plans for a missile shield in eastern Europe.

 He gave no clear answer to the question preoccupying Kremlin-watchers and investors who Putin would endorse as his replacement when his second and final term ends next March.

 But he set the tone for Russias next presidency, announcing a spending splurge on housing, pensions, defence and mammoth infra-structure projects including a canal to link the Caspian and Black Seas.

 In a swipe at Opposition groups who have taken to the streets alleging he is backtracking on democracy, the President railed at extremists and said foreign cash was being used to upset Russias political stability.

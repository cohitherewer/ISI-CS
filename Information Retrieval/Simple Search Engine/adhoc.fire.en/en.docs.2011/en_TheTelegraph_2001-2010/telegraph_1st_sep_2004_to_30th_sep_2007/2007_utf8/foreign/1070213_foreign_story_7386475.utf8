 Barbers under threat

 Khar (Pakistan), Feb. 12 (Reuters): 

 Barbers in a Pakistani tribal region have received Taliban-style 

 warnings from religious zealots warning them against cutting 

 or shaving beards, residents said today.

 Notices were plastered on barber shops in Khar, the main town in the Bajaur tribal region bordering Afghanistan, and in nearby villages.

 Barbers involved in anti-Islamic activities like shaving beards are warned that they would themselves be responsible for any damage to their shops and houses, read the Pashto-language notice on a barber shop at the village of Inayat Kalay.

 Many Islamic scholars say Muslims must, if able, grow a beard to at least the length of a clenched fist, although the moustache can be trimmed or shaved.

 Threats have been made to barbers in Waziristan, another region regarded as a hotbed of support for the Taliban, Afghanistans former rulers who insisted on a very strict, conservative interpretation of the Quran.

 The barbers feel scared. Ninety per cent of their business was based on shaving beards. We virtually have no business now, said a barber in Inayat Kalay.

 The warning echoed a decree issued under Afghanistans ousted Taliban regime ordering all men to grow beards and could reinforce concern that Pakistans border areas are undergoing a Talibanisation.

 Intel unveils faster, smaller processors

 New York, Jan. 27 (PTI): Intel Corp, the worlds largest semiconductor maker, said it made a breakthrough in transistor technology that allows it to make faster, smaller, more efficient processors.

 The company demonstrated working models of new chips, which are made up of transistors that use metal gates rather than silicon dioxide, at an event at the companys headquarters in Santa Clara, California.

 Intel is altering the fundamentals of its chips in response to changing requirements in the personal computer industry. Older designs such as the Pentium resulted in chips that, while they counted quickly, required too much cooling to allow them to be used in laptops.

 Transistors are microscopic electronic switches which, by being switched on and off, represent the 0s or 1s that are the building block of all digital information. The silicon dioxide or now metal gate is used to turn them on and off. Intel and other chipmakers have been using silicon dioxide as gates since the late 1960s. The material is reaching its physical limits.

 Current silicon dioxide gates are as thin as five atoms, a thickness that causes leakage the flow of electricity even when the transistor is turned off.

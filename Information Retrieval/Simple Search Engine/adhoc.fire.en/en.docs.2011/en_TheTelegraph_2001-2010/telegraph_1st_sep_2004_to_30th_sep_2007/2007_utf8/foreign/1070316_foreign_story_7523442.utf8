 Pervez meddle

 Islamabad, March 15 (Reuters): President Pervez Musharraf, accused by lawyers, journalists and political opponents of acting unconstitutionally in trying to sack the countrys most senior judge, said today that he wouldnt interfere in the case. 

 The hearing against supreme court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary will reconvene tomorrow behind closed doors, but there is no clear idea how long the case might last.

 I promise you that judiciary will decide, we dont have to interfere in the matter, even I dont have the right, Musharraf told a rally in eastern town of Gujranwala. Whatever decision they take, I will accept it.

 Chaudhary has already told the panel of five judges sitting on the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) that he does not expect a fair hearing from them. Lawyers are expected to continue their week-long agitation against the governments action, Islamist parties are planning protests after Friday prayers, while the media is smarting over attempts to muzzle its reporting and commenting on the case. 

 The chief justice was suspended last Friday after a meeting with Musharraf, and his subsequent confinement at his Islamabad home has outraged many Pakistanis. He is like a class-A prisoner, said Syed Iftikhar Gillani, former law minister, who was one of the few people to have gained access to the suspended chief justice.

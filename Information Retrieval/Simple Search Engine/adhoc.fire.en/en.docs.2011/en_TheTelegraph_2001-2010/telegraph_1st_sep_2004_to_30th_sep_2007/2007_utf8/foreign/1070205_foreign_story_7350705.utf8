 A blog for Posh

 Los Angeles, Feb. 4: If serious artistes such as rock band Radioheads Thom Yorke and electronicas most high-profile vegan musician Moby can maintain Web logs, whos to say Posh Spice cant? 

 A tabloid mainstay across Europe, former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham wife of soccer star David Beckham, who is Southland-bound after taking a $250-million deal to play for the Los Angeles Galaxy has been using a blog (www.dvbstyle.com) to chronicle the spectacle of Posh and Becks going Hollywood, Los Angeles Times said. 

 Weve been lucky enough to be invited to a couple of Golden Globes parties, she wrote in one posting last month. As for the clothes wow there are some gorgeous dresses being worn by Hollywoods finest. 

 Champion chilli eater

 Mexico City (AP): For most people, even the smallest bite of a raw chilli pepper means a flushed face and a rush for a gulp of water. But Manuel Quiroz can guzzle down dozens of Mexicos spiciest chillies, rub them on his skin and even squeeze their juice into his eyes without so much as blinking. 

 Chillies dont sting me. They dont affect me. Its just like eating fruit, Quiroz said at a market. Shoppers stared in amazement as he crunched on a habanero, the hottest chilli pepper in the country.

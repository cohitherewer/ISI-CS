 Court upholds abortion ban

 Washington, April 18 (AP): The supreme court upheld the US ban on a controversial abortion procedure today, handing abortion opponents the long-awaited victory they expected from a more conservative bench.

 The 5-4 ruling said the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act that Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed into law in 2003 does not violate a womans US constitutional right to an abortion. The opponents of the act have not demonstrated that the act would be unconstitutional in a large fraction of relevant cases, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion.

 The decision pitted the courts conservatives against its liberals, with Bushs two appointees, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, siding with the majority. Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia also were in the majority. 

 It was the first time the court banned a specific procedure in a case over how not whether to perform an abortion.

 Abortion rights groups have said the procedure sometimes is the safest for a woman. They also said that such a ruling could threaten most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy, although government lawyers and others who favour the ban said there are alternate, more widely used procedures that remain legal.

 The outcome is likely to spur efforts at the state level to place more restrictions on abortions. More than 1 million abortions are performed in the US each year, according to recent statistics. Nearly 90 per cent of those occur in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, and are not affected by todays ruling.

 Six federal courts have said the law that was in focus today is an impermissible restriction on a womans constitutional right to an abortion.

 The law bans a method of ending a pregnancy, rather than limiting when an abortion can be performed. Todays decision is alarming, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in dissent. She said the ruling refuses to take... seriously previous Supreme Court decisions on abortion.

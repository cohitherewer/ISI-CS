 Washington, April 12 (AP): World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz acknowledged today that he erred in helping a close female friend get transferred to a high-paying job. 

 At issue are the generous compensation and pay raises of a bank employee, Shaha Riza, who has dated Wolfowitz. 

 She was given an assignment at the state department in September 2005, shortly after he became bank president.

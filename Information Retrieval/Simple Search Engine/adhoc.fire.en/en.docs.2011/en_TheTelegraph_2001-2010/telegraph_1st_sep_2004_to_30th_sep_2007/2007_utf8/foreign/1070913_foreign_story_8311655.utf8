 Peshawar, Sept. 12 (AP): Islamic militants tried to blow up a statue of the Buddha carved into a mountainside in northwestern Pakistan, but did not damage the structure, officials and a witness said today.

 The incident occurred in the small village of Jehanabad in North West Frontier Province, a stronghold of pro-Taliban Islamic militants that lies on the border with Afghanistan.

 A group of armed men arrived in the village late on Monday saying they were mujahideen, or Islamic fighters, and told residents they wanted to blow up the 7-metre-high statue, said villager Amir Khan. I told them that there are houses near the rock and any blast could put our lives in danger, but they pointed their weapons at us, said Khan. We heard the sound of drilling twice and then early yesterday morning we heard two blasts.

 The statue was undamaged, but some of the rock surrounding it was blown away, officials said. Luckily, the actual statue of the Buddha is safe, said Abdul Nasir, assistant curator of the museum in nearby Swat town. Islam teaches us to respect other religions and faiths, but unfortunately some elements are disturbing the peace in the Swat valley.

 The statue was built around the 1st century, during the Gandhara era, which flourished in that part of Pakistan from the 6th century BC to the 11th century AD, according to Fida Ullah Sehrai, an expert on Buddhist archaeology and former director of the Peshawar Museum.

 Milan, June 18 (Reuters): Italian fashion designer Gianfranco Ferre died at Milans San Raffaele hospital yesterday after suffering a brain haemorrhage, the hospital said in a statement.

 Ferre, 62, had been admitted to hospital on Friday. The hospital said doctors confirmed his death at 1900 GMT.

 The portly, bearded designer was suffering from diabetes and had already had two strokes. Ferre was known for his sharp, tailored womens suits and furs. He was artistic director at French fashion house Christian Dior. I particularly admired him for his artistry upon which he based his fashion philosophy, Giorgio Armani said.

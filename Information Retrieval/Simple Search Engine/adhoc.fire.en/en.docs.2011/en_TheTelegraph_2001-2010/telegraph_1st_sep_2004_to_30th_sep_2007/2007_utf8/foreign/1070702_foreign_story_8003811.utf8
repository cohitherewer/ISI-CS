 Britain stubs out smoking

 London, July 1 (Reuters): England snuffed out smoking in bars, workplaces and public buildings today in what campaigners said was the biggest boost to public health since the creation of the National Health Service in 1948.

 The legislation is designed to protect people from the effects of second-hand smoke at work, which doctors estimate kills more than 600 people a year. The government hopes it will help smokers quit and discourage children from lighting up.

 England follows Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales and means smoking in enclosed public places such as pubs is now banned throughout the UK.

 The move follows similar bans in Ireland and other European countries. Some parts of Canada and a number of US states have had strict controls on smoking for years.

 Individuals lighting up against the law in England face fines of up to 200 ($400) while businesses can be charged up to 1,000 for failing to display no smoking signs.

 Smoking is the single most preventable cause of death, said Deborah Arnott, at charity Action on Smoking and Health. Workers have a right to a safe environment and the harm done by tobacco smoke is now known to be significantly dangerous.

 A quarter of adults smoke, with the level higher among those doing manual and routine jobs.

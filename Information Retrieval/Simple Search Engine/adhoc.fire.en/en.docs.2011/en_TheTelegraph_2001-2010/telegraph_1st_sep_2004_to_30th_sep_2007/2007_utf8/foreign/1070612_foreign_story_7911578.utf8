 Quest into whether Mallory climbed Everest first

 George Mallory 

Mount Everest

 Kathmandu, June 11: A team of mountaineers carrying replica 1920s kit yesterday began an attempt to reconstruct the mysterious final climb on Mount Everest of George Mallory and Sandy Irvine.

 The expedition on the upper slopes is being led by Himalayan veteran Conrad Anker, 44, the man who found Mallorys body eight years ago just 2,000 feet from the summit. Anker, an American, will retrace the British pioneers steps on the Tibet side of the mountain in an attempt to find out if they reached the summit in 1924, 29 years before Everest was officially conquered by another route.

 Anker will take the role of Mallory on the trip, while Leo Houlding, 26, a British rock climber, is playing Irvine, the Oxford student who joined him in a frozen death on the mountain.

 Wearing 30,000 of replica equipment from the original manufacturers including hobnail boots and cotton jackets the team will remove all the modern ropes and ladders added by later climbers. There are hand-knitted woollen sweaters and fine cotton jackets. You could wear it and go to a restaurant and have dinner and you wouldnt look out of place, Anker told The Daily Telegraph yesterday by satellite phone from Advance Base Camp.

 The weakest link they had was their footwear, he said. As soon as they stopped walking it started to freeze.

 The nails also had a tendency to fall out of the boots, leading to loss of grip, while the flapping tents gave little opportunity to warm up after exposure to the biting cold.

 According to Kevin Thaw, another climber on the expedition, whenever Anker and Houlding have worn the replica gear their lips seem to turn blue and they get very cold very quickly.

 Whether Mallory and Irvine reached the 29,035 feet summit in 1924 is one of mountaineerings greatest unsolved mysteries. Anker found Mallorys body, with a broken rope attached to his harness and hands crushed trying to arrest his fall. Irvines body has never been found.

 The team hopes that by re-examining the site and evaluating the evidence collected in 1999 they can shed more light on where Mallory fell from, and whether he was climbing or descending at the time.

 It was not until 1953 that Sir Edmund Hillary, a New Zealander, and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay officially conquered the mountain.

 A crucial element of the climb will be overcoming the Second Step, a 100 feet cliff which is the last major obstacle before the summit. As Mallory and Irvine would have done if they had succeeded, the team will tackle it by fair means, first removing a modern ladder used by almost all the later mountaineers who have passed that way.

 Its very dangerous, said Anthony Geffen, who is making a documentary of the Altitude Everest Expedition. 

 If you slip there you go right off the edge of the North Face.

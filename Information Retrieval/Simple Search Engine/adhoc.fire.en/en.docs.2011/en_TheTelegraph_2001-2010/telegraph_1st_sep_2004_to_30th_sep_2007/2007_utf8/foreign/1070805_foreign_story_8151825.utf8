 Minneapolis, Aug. 4 (Reuters): Divers searched for bodies in debris in the murky Mississippi today as President George W. Bush toured the site of this weeks deadly rush-hour bridge collapse and promised quick federal help in rebuilding.

 Bush got a birds eye view of the ruined bridge in a 10-minute helicopter tour, then donned an orange hard hat and wind-breaker to walk a section of the 40-year-old bridge on foot as rain fell.

 Local officials have confirmed five deaths and seven people missing after the Wednesday evening bridge collapse, but searches were ongoing. Its too early for us to know how many people are missing or dead because we are unsure how many people are under the debris, said Minneapolis mayor R.T. Ryback.

 Divers battled swift currents to search amid twisted steel and chunks of concrete for submerged cars that had tumbled 20 meters from the eight-lane span.

 Bush met rescuers and victims families, and spoke to Gary Babineau, 24, of Blaine, Minnesota, who helped screaming children out of the wrecked school bus after the bridge collapsed under his pick-up truck.

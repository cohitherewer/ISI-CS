 Taliban kill Korean captive

 Ghazni (Afghanistan), July 25 (Reuters): Taliban kidnappers shot dead a South Korean hostage and threatened to kill 22 others unless their demands were met, a Taliban spokesman said.

 A local government official confirmed the death. Yes, they have killed one of the hostages and efforts are under way to have the others released, district chief of Qarabagh in Ghazni province, Khowja Seddiqi, said.

 The Taliban accused the Afghan government and South Korean negotiators of failing to act in good faith after they rejected a list demanding eight named rebel prisoners be freed.

 Since Kabuls administration did not listen to our demand and did not free our prisoners, the Taliban shot dead a male Korean hostage, Qari Mohammad Yousuf said by telephone from an unknown location. 

 If the administration of Kabul is not ready to release our hostages, then the rest of the hostages will be killed, he said. 

 He said the Korean hostage had been killed in a desert area in the Qarabagh district of Ghazni close to where the 23 Korean church volunteers 18 women and five men were abducted on the main road south from Kabul last week.

 He rejected Korean media reports that said the Taliban planned to free eight of the captives.

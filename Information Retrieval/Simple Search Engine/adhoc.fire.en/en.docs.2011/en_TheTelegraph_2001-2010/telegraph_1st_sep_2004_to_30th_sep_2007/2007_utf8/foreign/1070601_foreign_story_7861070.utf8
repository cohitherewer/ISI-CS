 Putin warns US over arms race

 Moscow, May 31 (Reuters): Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a scathing attack on the West today, accusing Washington of imperialism and of starting a new arms race.

 Speaking a week before he meets leaders of the Group of Eight (G-8) industrial nations in Germany, Putin said Russias tests on Tuesday of a two new missiles were a direct response to US moves to create a missile defence system.

 We are not the initiators of this new round of the arms race, Putin told a joint Kremlin news conference with visiting Greek President Karolos Papoulias.

 There is no need to fear Russias actions: they are not aggressive, he said.They are a mere response to harsh and groundless unilateral actions by our partners and are aimed at maintaining the balance of forces in the world.

 Putins comments, which will be popular among ordinary Russians in a year when there is a parliamentary election, are the latest in a line of harsh outbursts against the West. Russia on Tuesday test-fired a new intercontinental ballistic missile with multiple warheads and a new cruise missiles, which Russian generals say are sufficient to ensure the countrys security for the next 40 years.

 Our partners are stuffing eastern Europe with new weapons, Putin said.What are we supposed to do? We cannot just observe all this.

 Moscow has been alarmed by US plans to deploy elements of its global missile defence system in Poland and the Czech Republic. Washington says it wants to avert attacks from rogue states such as Iran but Russia sees a threat to its own security.

 There is a clear desire by some international players to dictate their will to everyone without adhering to international law, Putin said. International law has been replaced by political reasons.

 In our opinion it is nothing different from diktat, nothing different from imperialism, he added.

 Litvinenko murder

 The man charged by Britain with murdering former Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko denied involvement today, saying British intelligence and a self-exiled Russian multi-millionaire were far more likely suspects.

 In comments likely to deepen a Russian-British feud reminiscent of Cold War spy scandals, Britains chief suspect Andrei Lugovoy rejected Litvinenkos death-bed charge that the Kremlin had ordered his poisoning with highly radioactive Polonium 210.

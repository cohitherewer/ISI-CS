 Women like ankle tattoos

 Washington, Feb. 6 (AFP): Three out of four Americans who get pierced are women, twice as many Democrats get pierced than Republicans, and about one out of three young adults sport tattoos, according to a USs dermatology study.

 Thirty-six per cent of people aged 21-32 and another 24 per cent of people aged 18-50 have tattoos, which among women is favoured on the ankle (27 per cent), upper back (25 per cent), small of the back (18 per cent), hips and buttocks (15 per cent).

 Men prefer being tattooed on the arm (75 per cent), shoulder (34 per cent), legs (25 per cent) and chest (17 per cent), said the study by Northwestern University of Chicago Prof. Ann Laumann presented at the Annual Dermatology Congress in Washington.

 Shambo battle of wills ends

 AMIT ROY

 London, July 25: It is like the England of old when people would gather outside a prison waiting for a condemned man to be hanged. 

 It was much the same with poor Shambo today as the Hindu monks who have looked after the bull announced he will be taken away tomorrow for slaughter.

 The authorities are acting technically within their rights for Shambo tested positive three months ago for exposure to bovine tuberculosis. But they have shown little understanding of the Hindu religion. There is just an undercurrent of feeling among sections of the 1m strong Hindu 

 population in Britain that had aggressive Muslim sentiment been involved the 

 government would probably have bent over backwards to appease them. However, the 

 Hindus do have a track record of being the most law abiding and peaceful in the 

 country and hence are ignored at times like this. Although the monks at the Skanda Vale temple in Llanpumsaint, west Wales, gave a pledge that Shambo would be kept isolated from other animals and even requested a second test the government in Wales, driven by the farming lobby, is unmoved. 

 A peculiar blood lust appears to be manifesting itself among those determined by all means possible to have the six-year-old Fresian killed.

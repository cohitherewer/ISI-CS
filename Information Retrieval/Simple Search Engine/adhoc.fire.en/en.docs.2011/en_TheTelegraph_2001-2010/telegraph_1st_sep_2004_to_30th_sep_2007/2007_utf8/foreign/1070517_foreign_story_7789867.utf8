 London, May 16 (AP): The widow of the alleged ringleader of the 2005 London bombings and two men were freed without charge after being questioned by police investigating the attacks, officials said.

 Hasina Patel, 29, wife of Mohammed Sidique Khan the head of the group which struck three subway cars and a double-decker bus was arrested on May 9 along with three men.

 Police said three suspects had been released after questioning, but said officers continue to interview a 34-year-old man on suspicion of aiding the bombers, who killed 52 commuters and injured hundreds in attacks on July 7, 2005.

 The suspects were released from a central london police station this evening, another man is still being questioned by officers, a London police spokeswoman said yesterday on customary condition of anonymity.

 In April, police charged three people, all from west Yorkshire in northern England, with conspiring with the attackers.

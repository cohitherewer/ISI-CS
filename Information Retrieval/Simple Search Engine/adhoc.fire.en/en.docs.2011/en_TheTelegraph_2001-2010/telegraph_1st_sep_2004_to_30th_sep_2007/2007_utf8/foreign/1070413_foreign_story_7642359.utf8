 Drew follows in idols footsteps

 New York, April 12 (AP): 

 Drew Barrymore grew up with tear sheets of models such as 

 Cheryl Tiegs, Rachel Hunter and Christie Brinkley plastered 

 on her bedroom wall. Come January, another young girl can 

 do the same with Barrymores photo.

 Barrymore is CoverGirls newest model and spokeswoman, joining a stable of famous faces that includes her former idols and, more recently, Queen Latifah. Her selection by the Procter amp; Gamble company beauty brand was announced at a news conference in Los Angeles.

 The 32-year-old Charlies Angels actress is also a co-creator of the ads, and before any wardrobe or beauty decisions were made at Mondays print shoot, Barrymore said she was consulting on the concept, graphics, lighting and how the photo would be cropped.

 I leave the makeup and product up to them, thats their expertise, she said. What I want to do is honour the tradition of CoverGirl but hopefully bring myself and my personality into it, as well as some edgy fashion-forward thinking and positivity to it.

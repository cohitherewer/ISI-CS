The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Sharif plans court plea for Pak return

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 Comeback hopes

 Islamabad, Aug. 1: Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif will file a petition in the supreme court tomorrow seeking a verdict that will allow him to return to Pakistan. 

 Sharif, who was overthrown in a bloodless coup in October 1999, went into exile along with his family to Saudi Arabia in December 2000 for 10 years as part of deal between the Saudi and Pakistani governments. 

 The petition has been drafted and will be filed in the supreme court tomorrow, a senior Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) leader told The Telegraph on condition of anonymity. 

 Senior lawyer Fakharuddin G. Ibrahim, who met Sharif and his younger brother Shahbaz during a recent visit to London, will file the petition on behalf of the family. Local media today quoted Ibrahim as saying that Sharif had directed him to prepare the petition. 

 It is high time that we challenge the governments decision barring Sharif and his family members to return to Pakistan, party spokesman Siddique-ul-Farooque told The Telegraph. 

 President Pervez Musharraf has said several times that Sharif and former Premier Benazir Bhutto would not be allowed to return to Pakistan and lead their respective parties in parliamentary elections scheduled for 2008. 

 However, Bhuttos chances of returning to Pakistan have brightened after her secret meeting with Musharraf last week in Abu Dhabi. 

 What transpired during the meeting has not been disclosed so far, but the local media claimed that a deal had been sealed between the two leaders. 

 According to the deal, Musharraf will leave the post of chief of army staff by the end of the year to give his countrymen a New Year gift. 

 Musharraf will be re-elected by the sitting Assemblies for a second five-year term and Bhuttos Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) legislators, both in parliament and the provincial Assemblies, will abstain from the presidential election process without raising the dual role issue at any forum, including the supreme court. 

 In his first comments after the supreme court overturned the suspension of Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry on July 20, Musharraf said yesterday that he hopes for harmonious ties with the judge whom he had tried to fire four months ago.

 Musharraf said he accepted the judgment and would honour it. He had personal relations with Chaudhry and hoped to maintain them, he said.

 We had family ties and hope to maintain (the) same harmonious ties in future, the official Associated Press of Pakistan quoted him as saying at a ceremony yesterday.

 Musharraf, who is also the army chief, said he held judges in the highest esteem and had never tried to politicise the judiciary.

 Aziz bid to mend Kabul fences

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 Islamabad , Jan. 3: Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz will visit Kabul tomorrow as part of a government strategy to remove misunderstandings and build trust after Islamabad decided to fence and mine its border with Afghanistan. 

 Despite ups and downs in their relations, the two countries have bonds, which are unshakeable and unbreakable, foreign ministry spokeswoman Tasneem Aslam said in Islamabad today. 

 Relations have soured between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which are key US allies in its fight against terrorism. 

 Pakistans plan to fence and mine parts of the rugged 2,430-km frontier with Afghanistan was seen as an attempt to fend off criticism it does too little to stop Taliban and al Qaida guerrillas from crossing the border.

 Karzai has rejected the proposed Pakistani measure, saying it will only separate people without eliminating militant sanctuaries in Pakistan. 

 Observers say one of Azizs objectives in Kabul is to address Afghan reservations over fencing of the border.

 Taliban to free hostages

 Ghazni, Aug. 28 (Reuters): Taliban insurgents said today they would release 19 South Korean Christian volunteers they have held for nearly six weeks, provided Seoul pulls out its troops and stop Korean missionary work in Afghanistan by year-end.

 South Koreas presidential Blue House issued a statement earlier setting out the terms of the agreement.

 Taliban representative Qari Mohammad Bashir confirmed a deal had been struck. But the Taliban demands did not include their main previous condition the release of a group of militants held prisoner by the Afghan government.

 By the end of 2007, they will withdraw their forces from Afghanistan, Bashir told reporters, standing side by side with Korean negotiators in Ghazni province.

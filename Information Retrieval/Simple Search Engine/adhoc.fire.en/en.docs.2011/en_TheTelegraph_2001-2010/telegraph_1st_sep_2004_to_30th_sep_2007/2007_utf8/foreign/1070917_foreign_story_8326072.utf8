 Elastic trouble

 London, Sept. 16: Tight sock elastic can leave babies and young children with deep scars, experts say.

 Research published in the British Journal of Dermatology reveals sock scars often indicate inflammation in the subcutaneous fat or dermis, reports The Sunday Telegraph. Doctors are unable to say how long the condition lasts, but one child in America, where the research was carried out, still has scars after two years.

 Donkey run

 Underwood, Minnesota (AP) : A donkey 

 who fell down a dry, abandoned well was freed in an intensive 

 rescue effort. Firefighters realised the animal could not 

 be pulled out from the well. So they started pulling away 

 earth with a tractor and dismantling the well block by block. 

 Once one wall had been taken apart, firefighters put a harness 

 around the donkey and guided it out with a rope.

 Skin list

 New York (Reuters): Jim McBride has made it his lifes work to know how much naked female flesh appears in movies an obsession apparently shared by millions of people. So far McBride, also called Mr Skin, and a staff that includes his mother, who works as a skintern, have chronicled nude women in more than 25,000 movies and TV shows. It is all recorded on his website, www.mrskin.com, which has been running for eight years. We have eight to 10 people who just go through movies and television shows... for nudity, female nudity only, he said. The most prolific US mainstream actress is Angelina Jolie, he said. For an A-list actress, its pretty incredible to be naked in 10 movies and still be in your early 30s.

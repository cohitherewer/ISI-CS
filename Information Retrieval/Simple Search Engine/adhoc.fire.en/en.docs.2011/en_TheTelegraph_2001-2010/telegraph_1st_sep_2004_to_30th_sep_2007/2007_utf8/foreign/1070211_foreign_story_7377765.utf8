 Many missing pieces in Anna puzzle

 Washington, Feb. 10: Anna Nicole Smith, R.I.P.

 Well, hardly. The day after the busty celebrity was found unconscious in an Indian casino hotel suite in Florida, a preliminary autopsy resolved little about how she suddenly died. 

 Meanwhile, a third man stepped forward to claim paternity of her infant daughter. And a judge ordered that she cant be buried until February 20. Also, a bidding war ensued for footage of her being rushed to the hospital; it sold for $500,000 and went right onto the Internet. 

 Even impresario Don King, whose boxing match Smith attended last month on the Indian reservation, felt compelled to hold a news conference to say that he didnt really know Smith but felt really sorry about her death.

 Then there was Smiths estranged mother, Virgie Arthur, telling Good Morning America that she blamed her death on drugs, a sentiment echoed by others who had been close to Smith. 

 But authorities said they found no immediate evidence of illegal drugs in her room, or in her body. The Broward County medical examiner, Joshua Perper, called the autopsy results a medical puzzle that would take three to five weeks to resolve.

 At a news conference, Perper said that after a six-hour autopsy he could not make a ruling on the cause of death. Smith had been suffering from a stomach flu earlier in the week, he said, and there was no sign of physical injury, such as blunt force trauma, gunshot wound, stab wounds or asphyxia. No illegal drugs were found in her room, only Valium and antibiotics. Nor were pills visible to the naked eye found in her body, Perper said.

 An equally complex postmortem involves the future of Smiths estate, and custody of the reality TV stars five-month-old child. Two men already swear that they fathered Dannielynn, who was born in the Bahamas. Complicating matters even further was a surprising new claim by Zsa Zsa Gabors eighth husband, Prince Frederick von Anhalt, that he may be the father of Smiths baby. 

 He said yesterday that they had had a decade-long affair and that he had wanted to adopt Anna Nicole Smith to fulfill her dream of becoming a princess. (Never mind that von Anhalts claim to royalty is a bit shaky: He reportedly bought his title.)

 Also unresolved are matters involving the estate of her late oil baron husband, J. Howard Marshall II; claims by irate TrimSpa diet-pill users who say they were bilked; and next months inquest in the Bahamas over her 20-year-old sons mysterious death.

 This is a big mess, said Alban Salaman, an estate lawyer with Holland amp; Knight in Washington who has no connection to the cases. I think the first thing is the child custody battle.

 Smiths long-time companion, Howard K. Stern, is named as the father on the childs birth certificate, but her former boyfriend, Larry Birkhead, went to court in Los Angeles to seek an emergency DNA test yesterday to determine the childs paternity. 

 Smiths last days will provide tabloid fodder for weeks if not years to come. Why was she travelling with a private nurse? Why did a doctor fly in from Los Angeles to treat her? Why didnt she have her baby with her?

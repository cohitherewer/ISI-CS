 Tennis risk

 Paris, July 19 (AFP): Youngsters who train intensively in the dream of becoming the next Roger Federer or Venus Williams should beware they may risk permanently damaging their spine.

 Doctors used Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to get a cross-section image of the spines of 33 young players enrolled in an elite training programme run by Britains National Tennis Centre. The players comprised 18 males and 15 females, aged from 16 to 23, none of whom had any back pain.

 The MRI pictures, interpreted by two musculoskeletal radiologists, revealed back abnormalities, some of which were irreparable, in 28 out of the 33 volunteers. Only five had normal spines. The study was published online yesterday by the British Journal of Sports Medicine.

 The problems included spinal disc degeneration, herniated discs, complete fractures and nasty stress fractures known as pars lesions. Three of the 10 pars lesions in nine players were complete fractures. Twenty-three players had early signs of diseased facet joint, which helps the spine to flex. Twenty-four players had bone overgrowth while cysts in the synovial fluid, which lubricates the joints, were found in 10 players.

 Tests show Bushs spokesman has cancer

 Snow: Unfazed

 Washington, March 27 (Reuters): White House spokesman Tony Snow, who survived colon cancer two years ago, reported today that a growth surgically removed from his abdomen was cancerous and that the disease has spread to his liver.

 Snow, 51, had surgery yesterday at an undisclosed hospital to remove a growth about the size of the tip of his small finger from his lower pelvic area. Tests confirmed it was cancerous.

 Im gonna beat it again, Snow said, according to deputy White House press secretary Dana Perino. She said the cancer had spread to his liver and that Snow was in consultation with his doctors about starting chemotherapy.

 He said hes going to go after this as aggressively as he can ... Its hard news for us at the White House, said Perino, breaking down in tears as she briefed reporters.

 The news came as a shock to a White House that has struggled all year to gain its footing, faced with a Democratic rebellion against President George W. Bushs Iraq war plan, and a controversy over the firing of eight US prosecutors. A sombre Bush told reporters that Snow called him from the hospital and told him the news.

 His attitude is one that he is not going to let this whip him, Bush said. And hes upbeat. My attitude is we need to pray for him and for his family. Im looking forward to the day when he comes back to the White House, Bush said.

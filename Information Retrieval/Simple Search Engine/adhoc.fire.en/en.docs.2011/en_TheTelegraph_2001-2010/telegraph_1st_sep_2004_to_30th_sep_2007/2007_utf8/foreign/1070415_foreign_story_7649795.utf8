 Mosque invite to Pervez

 Radical move

 Islamabad, April 14 (Reuters): Radical students and teachers at a religious school in Islamabad have invited Pakistans President to their establishment in a bid to defuse a confrontation over their self-appointed anti-vice campaign.

 The authorities have been at odds with the clerics and followers at the Jamia Hafsa madarsa over its attempts to halt government moves to demolish mosques built illegally on public land.

 We invite him; he is welcome, most welcome, said Maryam, a teacher, referring to President Pervez Musharraf. We will provide him security once he is inside the walls of Lal Masjid and Hafsa, she said today.

 It is highly unlikely that Musharraf, who has survived two al Qaida inspired assassination attempts and goes nowhere without heavy security, would take such a risk.

 The leader of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League, former Prime Minister Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, has visited the mosque twice, but students said Musharraf should come himself. 

 Why is he sending emissaries? What is he scared of? asked student Mahira Jamil.

 The compound which houses the madarsas has taken on the appearance of a rebel camp in recent weeks.

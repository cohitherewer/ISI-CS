 Backroom girls behind Hillary show

 Washington, June 24: Hillary Clinton has assembled the largest team of top-level female advisers ever seen in a presidential campaign in an attempt to maximise her support among women voters, who could hold the key to the White House.

 The women are known simply as the Board a group of strategists and spin doctors, many of whom worked for Hillary in her husband President Bill Clintons White House, 15 years ago. 

 They do yoga together, give each other birthday cakes, dodge baby toys in strategy meetings and, of most importance to Hillary, they never leak information. They share one goal: to ensure the former First Lady wins a place in history as Americas first female President.

 The women, with a handful of token males pollster Mark Penn, communications director Howard Wolfson, and adviser Harold Ickes are in charge of events in what aides call Hillaryland.

 Tamera Luzzatto, Hillarys top senate aide, said when she joined the campaign she found the equivalent of a board of trustees who knew what made her tick, how she thought, how to present advice to her, with everyone united in a determination to see her do well.

 The team is led by Hillarys national campaign director, Patti Solis Doyle, 41, whom she hired in 1991, before Bill Clinton set foot in the White House. She is the chairman of the daily strategy meetings. 

 A poll last week found women were twice as likely to vote for her as for her Democrat rival Barack Obama.

 Since half of voters have a negative view of her, and she trails Obama in support among independent voters, Hillarys strategists believe they must entice the many single women who did not vote in 2004 to the ballot box.

 Only 59 per cent of what pollsters call single, anxious females of the Sex and the City generation aged 18 to 44, and concerned equally by Iraq and health care voted three years ago, compared with 71 per cent of married women. Filling that gap with Hillary backers is the primary objective of the Board.

 Hillary has successfully talked tough on Iraq. Now, according to Peggy Noonan, a Republican columnist who wrote some of Ronald Reagans greatest speeches, she can begin to soften her style.

 Hillary Clinton doesnt have to prove shes a man, she said. She has to prove shes a woman.... She has to prove she has normal human warmth, a normal amount of give, of good nature, that she is not, at bottom, grimly combative and rather dark.

 The Board appears to agree. Its members are credited with encouraging Hillary, 59, to film softly-lit campaign videos for use on the Net. 

 Also, through a jukebox selection made at a diner, she announced that she had chosen her campaign song, Celine Dions You and I, music judged likely to appeal to middle-American mothers.

 Hillary is accompanied everywhere by Huma Abedin, 32, who started as a White House intern a decade ago. Another adviser, Evelyn Lieberman, 62, was the White House deputy chief of staff who fired Monica Lewinsky, before her affair with Bill became known in 1998.

 Maggie Williams, 53, Hillarys former chief of staff and believed to be the one person in whom she confided at the time of the Lewinsky affair, is now coordinating her Black voter programme.

 When Capricia Marshall became pregnant while employed at the White House, Hillary threw a baby shower and dug out her daughter Chelseas old cot, so that she could work with her newborn in the office. Yet one woman in three holds a negative view of Hillary.

 Yangon monk protests rise

 Yangon, Sept. 19 (Reuters): Nearly 1,000 Buddhist monks marched through the Myanmar city of Sittwe today, a day after soldiers fired tear gas and warning shots to scatter a similar protest against the ruling generals, a witness said.

 Urging thousands of bystanders not to join in, they staged a sit-in outside the local government offices to demand the release of two men sentenced to two years in jail for giving water to monks protesting against soaring fuel prices last month. After several hours of talks, officials agreed to release the pair.

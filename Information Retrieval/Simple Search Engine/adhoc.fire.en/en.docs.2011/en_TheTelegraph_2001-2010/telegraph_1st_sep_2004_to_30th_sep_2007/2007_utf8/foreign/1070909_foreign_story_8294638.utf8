 No Benazir deal: Minister

 Islamabad, Sept. 8 (PTI): The power-sharing deal between President Pervez Musharraf and former Premier Benazir Bhutto has collapsed over her demand that Prime Ministers must be allowed a third term, railways minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmad was quoted by The Dawn newspaper.

 It is finished. The President said no. If you insist, there are very thin chances of salvaging it just 1 or 2 per cent, Ahmad said.

 May be some last-minute attempt is made ... to salvage the deal. But personally, I am not at all hopeful, the reason being Bhuttos insistence that Prime Ministers must be allowed a third term, he said. 

 The most crucial part of the deal was the removal of a bar on leaders holding the post of Premier for a third term.

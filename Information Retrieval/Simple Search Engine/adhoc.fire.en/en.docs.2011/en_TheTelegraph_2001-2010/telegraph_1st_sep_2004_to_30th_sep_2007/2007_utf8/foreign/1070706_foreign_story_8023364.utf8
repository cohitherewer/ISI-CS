 Resort doubles pay after strike by Indians

 The Valley, Anguilla, July 5 (AP): Employers have doubled the salaries of more than 250 workers from India who went on strike late last month, halting construction of a posh Anguilla resort.

 Workers, who have returned to their jobs, had complained of 11-hour days and low pay in the Caribbean state. They said they were promised $600 a month but were paid between $180 and $400.

 The Indian labourers were hired to work on the $236 million Viceroy Resorts amp; Residences project through Pomposh, an Indian recruitment agency, and Carillion, a British construction company. 

 They were recruited this year to the Caribbean island of fewer than 14,000 people due to a labour shortage. 

 Viceroy is owned by the Kor Hotel Group in Los Angeles.

 The workers are satisfied with the agreement, said Joyce Egan, an attorney for the workers.

 Earlier this week, hundreds of workers joined by Anguilla residents again protested what they said were long hours, poor medical care and abusive language. Two police officers were slightly injured during the protest, and charges might be forthcoming, authorities said.

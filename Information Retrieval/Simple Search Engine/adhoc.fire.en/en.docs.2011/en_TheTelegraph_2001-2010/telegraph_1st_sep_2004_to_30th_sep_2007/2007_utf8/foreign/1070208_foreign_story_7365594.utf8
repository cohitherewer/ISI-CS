 Janitor rejects model excuse for being thin

 Sasha: Dont be like me

 New York, Feb. 7 (Reuters): The man who cleans backstage at New Yorks fashion week says there is a problem with the claims of stick-thin models that they are naturally skinny.

 We can smell it. Theyre doing a lot of vomiting, janitor Dennis White, 28, said by the toilets backstage where models prepared for one early morning show. They look too skinny, like theyve got to eat.

 The global fashion industry is under siege from critics who want skinny models off catwalks a hot issue given the death in 2006 of two anorexic Latin American models.

 With New Yorks annual fashion week showcase in full swing, the focus on models health has shifted to the US fashion-industry capital.

 The Council of Fashion Designers of America, the US industrys trade group, in January issued guidelines for a healthier industry, but stopped short of enacting regulations about models weight. The councils guidelines recommend teaching models about nutrition and eating disorders, banning models under 16 from runways and offering healthy food backstage, with no smoking and no alcohol. But at fashion shows this week, there was a steady supply of free booze and cigarette smoke was in the air.

 I can be naturally thin, said Russian beauty Sasha Pivovarova, 22, lighting a cigarette as she prepared for a show. Her advice for young girls is simple:Dont try to look like me.

 Backstage at 9 am one day, the breakfast buffet included champagne, miniature pastries, coffee and caffeinated energy drinks.

 Champagne has always been served. We take one sip. None of the girls get drunk, said Polish model Magdalena Frackowiak, who at 19 is below New Yorks 21-year-old legal drinking age.

 A spokesman for the Fashion Week organisation denied models were making themselves vomit backstage.It is not something we have had a historical issue with or something we that our staff have seen on site this season, he said on condition of anonymity.

 The designers council did not return calls seeking comment.

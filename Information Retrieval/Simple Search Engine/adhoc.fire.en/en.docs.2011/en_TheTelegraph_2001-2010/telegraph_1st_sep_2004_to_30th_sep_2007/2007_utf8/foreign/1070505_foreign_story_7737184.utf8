 Pak judge sparks fear

 Islamabad, May 4 (Reuters): Pakistans suspended top judge will travel to Lahore by road tomorrow, undeterred by government warnings of bomb threats in the country, to rally support for his legal battle with President Pervez Musharraf.

 The authorities today showed their fear of the support suspended Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry is drawing, by detaining Opposition activists across Punjab province ahead of his visit to the provincial capital. Lahore police said they had taken nearly 400 people into custody as a preventive measure.

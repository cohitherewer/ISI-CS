 Oldest mother

 Madrid, Dec. 31 (AP): A 67-year-old Spanish woman has become the worlds oldest mother after giving birth to twins in Barcelona.

 The woman gave birth by caesarean section yesterday having previously undergone in-vitro fertilisation in the US. The mother and twins are doing well, a hospital spokeswoman said. 

 The previous holder of the oldest mother record was a 66-year-old Romanian citizen who gave birth in 2005.

 Mice peril

 Los Angeles (Reuters): Central Florida, the home of Walt Disney World, is typically invaded by visitors wearing mouse ears this time of year. 

 But while Mickey Mouses fans may be welcome, residents of Apopka, a tiny town near the theme park, are disgusted by the hundreds of thousands of real mice that have overrun their community. 

 Drug rap 

 London (Reuters): Singer George Michael will appear before a British court in January charged with being unfit to drive. 

 Michael was arrested and cautioned in October after he was found slumped over the wheel of his car in London and in possession of cannabis. In February, he was arrested on suspicion of possessing drugs. In April, the singer collided with parked cars near his home.

 Snow bid 

 Colorado (AP): A Colorado resident is offering snow for a price on eBay. Starting bids were holding steady on Friday at 99 cents for snow from Blizzard I and Blizzard II being offered by Mary Walker. She got the idea after shoveling mounds from two storms that together dumped more than 4 feet.

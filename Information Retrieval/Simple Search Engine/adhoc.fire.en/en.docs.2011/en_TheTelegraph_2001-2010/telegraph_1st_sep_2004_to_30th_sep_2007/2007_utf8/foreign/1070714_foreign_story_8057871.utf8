 House votes for pullout

 - Measure for return of troops by 2008

 Washington, July 13 (AP): After the Bush administration conceded that Iraq had made little progress towards a democratic society, the House of Representatives voted to withdraw US troops by spring 2008. 

 The measure passed 223-201 in the Democratic-controlled House despite a veto threat from President George W. Bush, who has ruled out any change in war policy before September.

 The security situation in Iraq remains complex and extremely challenging, the administration report concluded. The economic picture is uneven, it added, and the government has not yet enacted vital political reconciliation legislation.

 A few hours after Bushs remarks, Democratic leaders engineered passage of legislation requiring the withdrawal of US combat troops to begin within 120 days, and to be completed by April 1, 2008. 

 The measure envisions a limited residual force to train Iraqis, protect US assets and fight al Qaida and other terrorists.

 The vote generally followed party lines: 219 Democrats and four Republicans in favour, and 191 Republicans and 10 Democrats opposed.

 The report makes clear that not even the White House can conclude there has been significant progress, said Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat.

 To Bush and others who seek more time for the administrations policy to work, she said: We have already waited too long.

 Republicans sided with Bush at least for now. The bill undermines General Petraeus, undermines the mission he has to make America and Iraq safe, said the House Republican leader, John Boehner of Ohio. What we have here is not leadership, its negligence.

 Wild class

 Tirana (Albania), March 24 (Reuters): Four Albanian teachers have been censured for drunken and lewd behaviour in a remote village school after they had sexual intercourse behind a classroom blackboard, local reports said yesterday.

 The education ministry sacked two male teachers, replaced the headmaster and put a female teacher on probation after incensed parents in Xhyre, near the Macedonia border, locked the schoolhouse to stop the drinking.

 Would you call someone a teacher who drinks raki at ten in the morning and gets drunk and chases the schoolgirls? Xhevahir Hohxa, father of a pupil, said.

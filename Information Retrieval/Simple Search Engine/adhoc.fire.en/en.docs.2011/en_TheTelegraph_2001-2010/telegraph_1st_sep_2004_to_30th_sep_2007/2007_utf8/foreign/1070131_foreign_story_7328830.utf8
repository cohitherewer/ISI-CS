 Angry Hilton

 Los Angeles, Jan. 30 (AP): Paris Hilton has filed a federal lawsuit, seeking to shut down a website that displays personal photos, videos, diaries, and other belongings once kept at a storage facility.

 The website was launched last week claiming the items were auctioned off after Hilton neglected to pay the Los Angeles storage facility. It also promises visitors who pay a fee of $39.97 access to her passport, medical records and other legal papers.

 The 25-year-old heiress said a moving company was supposed to pay the storage fees and was shocked and surprised to learn her belongings were sold at a public auction.

 Lenin bell 

 Riga (AFP): Tourists visiting the Latvian city of Liepaja were offered the chance to ring the changes with some unusual souvenirs: bells made from a melted-down statue of former Soviet leader Lenin. 

 A local tourist board representative said just 500 bells had been produced from the Lenin statue, which stood in Liepajas central square until it was pulled down after Latvia regained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. 

 Proceeds from the sale of the limited edition souvenirs would go to charity. The bells, which cost $344, were cast in Germany.

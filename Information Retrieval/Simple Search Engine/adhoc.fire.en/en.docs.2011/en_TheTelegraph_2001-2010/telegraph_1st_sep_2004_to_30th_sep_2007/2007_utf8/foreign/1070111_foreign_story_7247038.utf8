 Dhaka, Jan. 10 (AP): A key political alliance today announced a series of fresh street protests to demand national elections be postponed, as tens of thousands of troops fanned out across the country ahead of the January 22 polls.

 Sheikh Hasina, leader of a 19-party alliance, told a huge rally in the heart of the capital that it would start non-stop demonstrations around the presidential palace on January 14 and, enforce a nationwide blockade on January 14-15 and another on January 17-18 to force its demands.

 If the government fails to meet our demands by then (January 18), well enforce a non-stop general strike from January 21, Hasina, a former Prime Minister, told thousands of supporters amid cheers in downtown Dhaka, walking distance from the presidential palace. We want to take part in the elections, but it must be held in a free and fair manner.

 Thousands of protesters joined the today at a soccer field amid tight security.

 Hasina accused the countrys interim President Iajuddin Ahmed of bias toward former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, Hasinas archrival.

 She asked Ahmed not to be the part of a conspiracy to rig the polls.

 The latest protest plans came after a three-day nationwide transport blockade that ended yesterday and saw violent clashes between police and demonstrators who want the polls postponed, citing alleged flaws in the voters list and other problems.

 Last month, the US-based National Democratic Institutes Dhaka office in a report said 10 million names on the current voting list had errors or duplications representing 13 per cent of the countrys 93 million voters.

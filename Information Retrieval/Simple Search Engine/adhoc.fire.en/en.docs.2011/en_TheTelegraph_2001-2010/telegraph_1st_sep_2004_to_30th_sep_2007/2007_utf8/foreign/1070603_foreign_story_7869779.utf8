 Jolie kid gets family name

 Proud mother

 Los Angeles, June 2 (AP): Angelina Jolies son Pax Thien now has the Jolie-Pitt family name.

 Jolie travelled to Vietnam in March to adopt Pax from a Ho Chi Minh City orphanage. The 31-year-old actress filed adoption papers as a single parent because she and partner Brad Pitt are not married. 

 The three-year-old boy is now Pax Thien Jolie-Pitt, according to a decree signed on Thursday by superior court judge Gerald Rosenberg. Pitt, 43, and Jolie have three other children: 5-year-old Maddox, who was adopted from Cambodia; 2-year-old Zahara, who was adopted from Ethiopia; and daughter, Shiloh, who was born to the couple last May 27.

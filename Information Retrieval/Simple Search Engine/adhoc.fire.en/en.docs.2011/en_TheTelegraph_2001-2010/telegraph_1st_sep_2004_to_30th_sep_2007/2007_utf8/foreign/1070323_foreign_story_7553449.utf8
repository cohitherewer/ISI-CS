 Kathmandu , March 22: As yesterdays violence in the Terai region threatened to derail the fragile peace process, top ruling coalition leaders rushed to Rautahat district of southern Nepal to find a solution to the ethnic crisis.

 Led by home minister Krishna Prasad Sitaula, CPN-UML general secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal and Maoist spokesperson Krishna Bahadur Mahara, the leaders visited Gaur and the surrounding areas of Rautahat district to collect first-hand information about yesterdays clash between Maoists and activists of the Madhesi Janadhikar Forum (MJF).

 Twenty eight people, mostly Maoists, were killed and 40 were injured. 

 According to the district administration office, the leaders inspected the clash site and met the security officials and the local people. 

 Sitaula issued directives to security officials to bring the situation under control and take precautionary measures to prevent any further clashes. 

 Following the home ministers directives, the security chiefs of the eastern region, regional administrators and chief district officers met in the afternoon to discuss security measures in the region. 

 Authorities in the neighbouring Bara district clamped an indefinite curfew in Kalaiya town since 12 noon today to prevent any clashes. 

 Reacting to the killing of his party workers, Maoist chief Prachanda warned that the peace process could be affected by the violence if the government did not immediately ban the MJF. 

 Talking to the journalists at Nepalgunj airport in western Nepal today, Prachanda said the Madhesi outfit should be banned as it was indulging in criminal activities in Rautahat district.

 iPhone code unlocked

 New York, Aug. 24 (AP): A teenager in New Jersey has broken the lock that ties Apples iPhone to AT amp;Ts wireless network, freeing the most hyped cellphone ever for use on the networks of other carriers, including overseas ones.

 George Hotz, 17, confirmed today that he had unlocked an iPhone and was using it on T-Mobiles network, the only major US carrier apart from AT amp;T that is compatible with the iPhones cellular technology.

 While the possibility of switching from AT amp;T to T-Mobile may not be a major development for US consumers, it opens up the iPhone for use on the networks of overseas carriers. Thats the big thing, said Hotz, in a phone interview from his home in Glen Rock. 

 The hack, which Hotz posted to his blog, is complicated and requires skill with both soldering and software. It takes about two hours to perform. Since the details are public, it seems likely that a small industry may spring up to buy US iPhones, unlock them and send them overseas.

 Movie mix-up

 Holtsville (New York), April 8 (AP): A family-film audience was stunned to get an unintended glimpse of a horror movie, which left some parents shaken and the theatre chain apologising for the mix-up.

 The audience was expecting to see The Last Mimzy, a PG-rated tale of a brother and sister who discover a mysterious box of toys and become endowed with superhuman powers to help preserve humanitys future. Instead, they saw the opening scene of The Hills Have Eyes 2, which starts with a chained woman giving birth to a mutant.

 No shrieks

 Sacramento, California (AP): No screaming on the Screamer!

 A suburban amusement park has gotten so many complaints from neighbours about bloodcurdling screams that it has instituted a no-shrieking rule for its scary new thrill ride, the Scandia Screamer, a gigantic, windmill-like contraption that sends people plunging 16 stories to Earth at nearly 60 mph (97 kmph). Riders who let out a screech or just about any other noise are pulled off and sent to the back of the line.

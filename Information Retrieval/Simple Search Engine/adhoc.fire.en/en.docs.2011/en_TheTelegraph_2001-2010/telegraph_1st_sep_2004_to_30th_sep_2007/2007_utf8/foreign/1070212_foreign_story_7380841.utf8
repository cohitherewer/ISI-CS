 Noose sparks dress code probe

 St Paul, Minnesota, Feb. 11 (AP): A party that asked students to come dressed politically incorrect has prompted an investigation by Macalester College officials who learned one student was costumed as a Ku Klux Klan member and another wore blackface with a noose around his neck.

 Students at the private school told administrators about the January 16 party on campus.

 My initial reaction was shock, said Paul Maitland-McKinley, a member of the Black Liberation Affairs Committee, a student group. I thought, this cant really happen on my campus.

 A campus-wide discussion is planned for Tuesday.

 We hope we can start a deeper dialogue on... why these types of activities hurt people and why they get the kind of response they do, said Jim Hoppe, the schools associate dean of students.

 The student newspaper, The Mac Weekly, quoted senior David Nifoussi, who attended the party, as saying it was meant to be a satiric comment on things that would be considered taboo in most situations at the liberal school. Macalester is the latest in a series of colleges to investigate student parties and incidents that have involved racial overtones.

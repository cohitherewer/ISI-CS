 Mad eye will be missed

 Cartoonist Peter Brookess caricature of Blair

 London, May 10 (Reuters): They will miss sketching the huge ears, the mad eye, the sinister toothy grin.

 Among Tony Blairs most vitriolic critics, Britains political cartoonists took parting shots today at the man whose easily caricatured face earned them a living for a decade. I detest the man and what hes done, wrote cartoonist Dave Brown in the Independent.But hes great to draw. You put all that bile, hatred and angst into drawing.

 The anger towards Blair has not been subtle. Browns commentary appeared on the day Blair announced he would resign on June 27, next to Browns drawing of the Prime Minister desperately trying to scrub blood from his hands.

 Britains famously savage cartoonists rapiered Margaret Thatcher and made John Major a laughing stock, shirt tucked in his underpants. But Blair, likened to Bambi when he first took power, seems to have attracted special venom.

 Since the invasion of Iraq in 2003, cartoonists have depicted him being dragged by the dogs of war, perched on coffins, surrounded by hellfire and covered in blood.

 As a voter I wont miss him in the slightest. As a cartoonist, I will miss him hugely, said Peter Brookes, who draws for the Times.

 Unlike Major and Thatcher, whose caricatures remained more or less the same throughout their spells in power, Blairs has undergone radical change, becoming increasingly sinister.

 Blair, more than anybody else, has been something of a chameleon, said Anita Brien, who has curated an exhibit of Blair cartoons at the Cartoon Museum in London.

 He was drawn as Bambi in the early days. Quite cute, with lots of teeth. Sometimes quite effeminate. Slightly film-starish. His cartoon persona has become decidedly less benign since the war in Iraq which nearly all cartoonists unlike many of the newspapers that employ them said they opposed.

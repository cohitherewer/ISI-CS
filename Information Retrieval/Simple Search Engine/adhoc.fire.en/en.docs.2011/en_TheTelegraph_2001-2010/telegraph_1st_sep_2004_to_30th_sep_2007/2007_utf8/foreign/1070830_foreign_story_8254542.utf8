The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Indian boy in UK goes missing

 AMIT ROY 

 Parvinder Singh

 London, Aug. 29: News of missing children always sends a shiver down the spine in Britain because there have been so many horrific crimes before and it happened again today. 

 Perhaps this will prove to be a false alarm but the police said that they are very, very concerned about a 12-year-old Indian boy who came to the UK under mysterious circumstances and has now gone missing without any obvious explanation. Parvinder Singh came to the UK from India three months ago, speaks Punjabi and does not know his way around or many people. 

 He was last seen in south London on Sunday afternoon near the Glades Shopping Centre, in Bromley High Street. Detective Inspector Bryan Davidson, from Bromley CID, said: It is extremely worrying that Parvinder has not made contact with anyone for two days. He has never been to the UK before so will not know his way around anywhere. We are very, very concerned as to his welfare and ask everyone in the area please to look out for him. 

 He added: Parvinder is a 

 bright young boy but he has not been out on his own since 

 being in Bromley, only with two other children living 

 at his foster home. He has shown no signs of wanting to 

 run away and was not unhappy when last seen. He had been 

 enjoying a swim with his two friends.

 Nicotine levels rising: Study

 Puffs of trouble

 Boston, Jan. 18 (Reuters): The amount of nicotine that smokers typically inhale per cigarette rose by 11 per cent from 1998 to 2005, perpetuating a tobacco pandemic that makes it harder for smokers to quit, a Harvard study said today.

 Harvard School of Public Health researchers analysed data submitted by major cigarette brands to the Massachusetts department of public health, which in August released its own study showing nicotine levels steadily rising.

 The amount of nicotine that smokers typically consume per cigarette regardless of brand per year rose by an average of 1.6 per cent between 1998 and 2005, according to the Harvard analysis of the states health records.

 Massachusetts has required tobacco companies to submit annual reports on cigarette nicotine yields since 1997, longer than any US state.

 Cigarettes are finely tuned drug delivery devices designed to perpetuate a tobacco pandemic, said Howard Koh, the schools associate dean for public health practice and former Massachusetts commissioner of public health.

 To boost amounts of nicotine inhaled by smokers, cigarette makers intensified the concentration of nicotine in their tobacco and modified cigarette designs to increase the number of puffs per cigarette, the Harvard researchers said.

 The end result is a product that is potentially more addictive, the study said.

 Nicotine yields rose in cigarettes of each of the four major manufacturers and across all major cigarette market categories from mentholated and non-mentholated to full-flavoured, light and ultralight, the study said.

 Tobacco industry officials were not available to comment.

 Phillip Morris has said nicotine levels fluctuate from year to year but there has been no steady increase.

 The most recent federal tobacco tax figures showed that the number of cigarettes sold in the US fell in 2005 to the lowest level in 55 years, dropping 4.2 per cent from 2004, the largest one-year percentage decrease since 1999.

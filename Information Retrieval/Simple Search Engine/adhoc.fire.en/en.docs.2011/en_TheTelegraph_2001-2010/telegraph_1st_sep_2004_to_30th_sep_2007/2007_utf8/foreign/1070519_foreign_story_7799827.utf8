 Gaza on verge of civil war

 Gaza, May 18 (Reuters): Israel struck Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip today and threatened more strong action to stop rocket attacks while Palestinian rival factions fought each other in turmoil verging on civil war.

 Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose Fatah faction has been accused by Hamas of siding with Israel, called US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and asked her to halt an Israeli military escalation, a Palestinian news agency said.

 A Palestinian hospital official said at least one man was killed and others were wounded when Israeli helicopter gunships fired on them after they launched a rocket into Israel.

 Fatah and Hamas forces, locked in fighting for the past week, battled again in Gaza City. Three rocket-propelled grenades were fired at the pro-Hamas Islamic University campus.

 Survey: Old people prefer Net to gardening

 London, Feb. 2 (Reuters): Retired people are starting to prefer browsing the Internet to more traditional pastimes such as gardening, travel and do-it-yourself, according to a survey today. 

 Those questioned by insurance company AXA said they spend an average of six hours a week online, shopping, doing research and emailing friends or relatives.

 Forty-one per cent listed surfing the Internet among their favourite pastimes, slightly ahead of the second choices, gardening and home improvements (both 39 per cent), and travel and walking (28 per cent). Their top Internet activity was emailing (84 per cent) and looking for information (83 per cent). Nearly half have booked travel tickets online, a third have tried Internet banking and 28 per cent catch up with the news online.

 Two thirds regularly contact their children via the Internet, while four in 10 keep in touch with their grandchildren. AXA said older people were attracted by the Internets convenience. It is encouraging to see British pensioners embracing technology, said AXA spokesman Alison Green.

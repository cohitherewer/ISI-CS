 Steamy emails led to astronaut rage

 Nowak

 Orlando (Florida), March 6 (AP): Nasa astronaut Lisa Nowaks bizarre 1,450 km road trip to confront a romantic rival may have been sparked when she uncovered steamy emails sent to her boyfriend by the other woman, documents released yesterday showed. 

 Nowak had collected more than a dozen emails sent to her one-time boyfriend, space shuttle pilot Bill Oefelein, including one he received during his shuttle mission, according to the documents, released late yesterday by the Orange-Osceola state attorneys office. 

 First urge will be to rip your clothes off, air force Captain Colleen Shipman wrote to Oefelein while he was aboard shuttle Discovery in December. 

 But honestly, love, I want you to totally and thoroughly enjoy your heros homecoming.

 Police have said Nowak, 43, raced 1,450 km in her car from Houston to Orlando on February 5, wearing an adult diaper so she would not have to stop, to confront Shipman, 30. 

 Nowak donned a wig and trench coat, then sprayed a chemical into the womans car when Shipman wouldnt let Nowak in, police said. 

 Nowak was charged with attempted kidnapping and burglary with assault. She pleaded not guilty on all counts.

 Since her arrest, Nowak, has told police that her relationship with Oefelein was more than a working relationship but less than a romantic one. But Oefelein, 41, told investigators they had been romantically involved since 2004.

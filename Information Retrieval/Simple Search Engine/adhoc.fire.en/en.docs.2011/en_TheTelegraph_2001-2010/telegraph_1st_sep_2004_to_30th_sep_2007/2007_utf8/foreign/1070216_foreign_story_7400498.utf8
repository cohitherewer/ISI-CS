 US shut doors on Anne Frank

 New York, Feb. 15: The growing desperation of Anne Franks family to flee Nazi-occupied Holland was revealed yesterday in a series of letters written by her father to officials and friends in America.

 Otto Frank, whose daughters diaries provided one of the most moving testaments to the plight of the Jews under the Nazis, tried to arrange US visas for his family. However, he was blocked by Americas restrictive immigration rules. Although the immigration restrictions were supposedly to protect national security, critics now claim that they were essentially anti-Semitic.

 US officials were allegedly instructed to prevaricate so that even official annual immigration quotas such as the 27,370 from Germany and Austria remained unfilled year after year.

 I would not ask if conditions here would not force me to do all I can in time to be able to avoid worse, Otto Frank wrote in April 1941 to his college friend Nathan Straus, who was living in the US. It is for the sake of the children mainly that we have to care for. Our own fate is of less importance.

 Unable to escape occupied Amsterdam, from July 1942, the Franks hid for more than two years in an annex of a warehouse before being arrested. Anne died of typhus, aged 15, in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945. Her father returned to the Netherlands to collect his daughters notes and published them in the Netherlands in 1947. Annes diary of their life in hiding went on to sell an estimated 75 million copies. Her fathers letters were released by the New York-based YIVO Institute for Jewish Research which found them in its archives a year and a half ago. They document how Frank tried to arrange for his family his wife Edith, daughters Margot and Anne and mother-in-law Rosa Hollander to go to the US or Cuba.

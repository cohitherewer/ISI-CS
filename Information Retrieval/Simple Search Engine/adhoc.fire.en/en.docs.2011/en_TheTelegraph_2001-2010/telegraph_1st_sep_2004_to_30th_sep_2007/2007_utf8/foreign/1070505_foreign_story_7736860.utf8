The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 8-year ultimatum to save the planet

 - Anti-warming measures must be in place to avert disastrous rise in temperatures

 Bangkok, May 4 (AP): Delegates approved the worlds first roadmap for stemming mounting greenhouse gas emissions today, laying out an arsenal of anti-warming measures that must be rushed into place to avert a disastrous spike in global temperatures.

 The report, a summary of a more than 1,000-page study by a UN network of 2,000 scientists, showed the world has to make significant cuts in gas emissions through increasing the energy efficiency of buildings and vehicles, shifting from fossil fuels to renewable and reforming both the forestry and farming sectors.

 The document made clear that the world has the technology and money to decisively act in time to avoid a sharp rise in temperatures that scientists say would wipe out species, raise ocean levels, wreak economic havoc and trigger droughts in some places and flooding in others.

 Under the most stringent scenario, the report said the world must stabilise the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at 445 parts per million by 2015 eight years from now to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial levels.

 Delegates said the approval of the report should conclusively debunk arguments by sceptics that combatting global warming was too costly, that it would stifle development in the worlds poorer countries or that the temperature rise had gone too far for humankind to do anything about.

 If we continue doing what we are doing now, we are in deep trouble, cautioned Ogunlade Davidson, the co-chair of group responsible for finalising the report this week in Bangkok.

 Delegates hailed the policy statement as a key advance toward battling global warming and setting the stage for an even stronger international agreement to replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse emissions when it expires in 2012.

 Its stunning in its brilliance and relevance, Rajendra Pachauri, chair of the group responsible for the report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said of the study. Its a remarkable step forward. 

 Clearly, the signs that the IPCC assess will have a direct and profound influence on the discussion that take place and the direction toward (a post-Kyoto) agreement, he said.

 The US was pleased the report highlights the importance of a portfolio of clean energy technologies consistent with our approach, said the head of the US delegation, Harlan Watson.

 But James Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, raised concerns about reaching the lowest emission targets proposed in the report.

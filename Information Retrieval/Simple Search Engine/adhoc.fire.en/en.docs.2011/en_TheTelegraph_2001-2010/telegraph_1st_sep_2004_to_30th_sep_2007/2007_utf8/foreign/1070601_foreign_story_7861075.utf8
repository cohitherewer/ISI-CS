 Subway drive

 Berlin, May 31 (Reuters): A German mistook a subway entrance for an underground car park and her vehicle got stuck on the stairs, police said yesterday.

 The 52-year-old drove her Volkswagen Beetle across the pavement in central Duesseldorf and into the entrance where it ground to a halt about five steps down, police said. Police estimated the damage at around 1,500 euros ($2,000).

 Pink dress

 New York (AP): A pink cocktail dress worn by Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffanys was auctioned for $192,000 (euro143,000) more than six times its estimated value. The sleeveless dress, worn for the scene in which Holly Golightly discovers her brother has died, sold on Wednesday to a private European buyer at Christies sale of film and entertainment memorabilia. The auction house said it had expected the dress to sell for up to $30,000 (euro22,000). The sale was filled with iconic pieces, said Helen Hall, Christies head of entertainment memorabilia. It captured the peoples imagination.

 Elvis turn

 Madrid (Reuters): Council meetings in Reus could take a turn for the bizarre after the northern Spanish town voted in a councillor who promised to turn up dressed as Elvis Presley and wants to turn the square into a nudist pool. Ariel Santamaria, a former postman, stood for a small independent party dressed in full Elvis regalia complete with sideburns and won enough votes last weekend to take a council seat.

 Pop glitter

 Los Angeles (AFP): Some of Michael Jacksons memorable and glittery clothes sold for thousands of dollars at a huge auction of goods belonging to the king of pop and his famous musical family. A black silk jacket that Jackson wore on stage in the 1980s fetched $17,000, while the evenings biggest sale was another glittery jacket that went under the hammer for $19,000 at the auction held at a Las Vegas hotel-casino.

 Idol Paula

I knew since I was a little girl that I had this profound way of touching people. My purpose is bringing out everybodys best and being that cheerleader to other peoples success, the 44-year-old singer-dancer tells OK! magazine.

 Hasina barred from Bangla return

 No homecoming

 Dhaka, April 18 (Reuters): Bangladeshs army-backed interim government has effectively barred former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from returning to the country, officials said today.

 Hasina, head of the Awami League party, had been due to fly home on Monday after a private visit to the US, vowing to defend herself against charges of murder and extortion. Hasinas arch-rival, Begum Khaleda Zia, was battling government efforts to drive her into exile too.

 A home ministry statement said the government had put its security forces on alert, a move officials said would effectively bar Hasina from coming home in the immediate future.

 Her irresponsible leadership caused serious lawlessness that destabilised public order and discipline, disrupted national security and economic activities in the country. In this context, if she returns to the country it is feared that she will again jeopardise discipline and economic activities in the country through provocative statements.

 Immigration authorities at air and land ports, all flight operating authorities in Bangladesh and others concerned have been asked to take necessary actions in this respect, the statement said.

 The ministry of foreign affairs, the Civil Aviation Authority and the inspector general of police have also been requested to take necessary measures in this regard.

 The statement said the step was temporary, but did not specify how long it would remain in force.

 I hope the government will reconsider the matter in the light of constitutional rights, said Suranjit Sengupta, a senior leader of Hasinas Awami League.

 We have yet no details... but the news which we got from media has really made us concerned, said Bimal Biswas, general-secretary of the Workers Party of Bangladesh, a partner in a 14-party alliance led by Hasina.

 Press note itself delivers the message, said the interim governments communication ministry chief, M.A. Matin, when asked if the home ministry statement was meant to thwart Hasinas homecoming.

 The country is in a crisis... politicians must understand this, Mainul Husein, in charge of the law and information ministries, said. He blamed the crisis largely on corrupt politics.

 National politics in Bangladesh had been polarised for a decade between Hasinas Awami League and Khaledas Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).

 Hasina and Khaleda, whose term as Prime Minister ended last October, have both been widely blamed for years of political confrontation that frequently spilled into the streets.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 100 million amp; counting, the iPod powers on

 - iPHONE BIGGEST THREAT TO PLAYER

 White wonder

 Apple has sold its 100 millionth iPod in just over five years one for every 65 people on the planet, and pronounced the sleek digital device the fastest selling music player in history.

 Since its launch in November 2001, the stylish player has become the must-have accessory for music fans across the globe.

 Although by no means the first digital music player on the market, the iPod blew the competition away with its impressive technical capabilities, clean look and the iTunes library that enabled users to download music legally. Early-adopters raved about its easy-to-use menu system and click-wheel control, and soon the unmistakable white headphones were sported by commuters, teenagers and joggers everywhere. 

 The iPod was designed by Briton Jonathan Ive and the original model has been swiftly followed by more than 10 revamped versions boasting refinements and improved technology such as the ability to play videos and hold photos. 

 Each new generation has also tweaked the iPods signature sleek design, so much so that the original basic iPod now looks chunky and dated compared to the latest multi-coloured, razor-thin models. 

 Apple also announced that its iTunes online music store has to date sold more than 2.5 billion songs, 50 million television shows and more than 1.3 million movies. Constant predictions that the iPod was about to hit its peak or suffer a sales crash because of the latest iPod killer have yet to come true. 

 So far, iPod sales have not been knocked by Microsofts Zune, and apparently emerged unscathed from what many predicted would hit it hard the development of music playing mobile phones. Its next challenge could be self-generated. 

 In June, Apple will launch the iPhone in America, a device combining all the capabilities of the iPod with a Blackberry-equivalent mobile phone. The phone is generating enormous hype with many iPod fans saying they are prepared to end their current mobile contract, however costly, to sign up with AT amp;Ts Cingular Wireless, which will start selling the iPhone exclusively for $500 or $600.

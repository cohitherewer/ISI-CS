 Benazir details Pervez deal

 Bhutto: Compromise

 Islamabad, Aug. 22 (AP): Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto detailed for the first time a plan to keep President Musharraf in office under a power-sharing deal she said would strengthen the fight against terrorism.

 Musharraf is seeking a new five-year presidential term but faces mounting pressure to step down as army chief and restore democracy, eight years after he seized power in a coup.

 In remarks to a US network broadcast yesterday, Bhutto outlined a possible agreement that would reduce Musharrafs power while allowing her to return from exile and perhaps to government.

 So were not trying to bail out a military dictator by saying we will come there on your terms. What we are seeking is a compromise that could help bring about a stable, democratic, civilian order, Bhutto said on PBS NewsHour With Jim Lehrer.

 What were negotiating for are certain changes that will empower the parliament to take on the militants, she said. A deal with Bhutto offers Musharraf a chance to fend off legal challenges to his continued rule and make good on pledges to combat the Taliban and al Qaida, viewed with growing scepticism in Washington and other Nato capitals.

 However, he has given no clear indication that he will make concessions demanded by Bhutto, including quitting the powerful post of army chief.

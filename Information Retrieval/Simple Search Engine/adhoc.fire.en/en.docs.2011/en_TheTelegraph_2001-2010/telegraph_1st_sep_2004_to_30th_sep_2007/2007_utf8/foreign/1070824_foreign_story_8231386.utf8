 Man held for sending finger to Abe

 Tokyo, Aug. 23 (Reuters): A member of a Japanese Right-wing group was arrested today after he sent his severed little finger to the ruling partys headquarters in protest at Prime Minister Shinzo Abes failure to visit a Tokyo war shrine.

 Abe stayed away from Yasukuni Shrine on the August 15 anniversary of the nations World War II surrender, avoiding a slight to those in China and Korea who see the shrine as a symbol of Japans past militarism.

 The 54-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of making threats after he sent his finger to the Liberal Democratic Party headquarters in Tokyo. 

 The envelope also contained a letter of protest and a disk showing images of the man cutting off his finger.

 I thought they would ignore me if I just sent the letter, so I put my little finger in as well, Kyodo news agency quoted the man as telling police. Removing part of a finger is a traditional form of punishment among gangsters in Japan.

 Murderers hanged

 Japan hanged three murderers today, bringing to 10 the number of executions carried out since Abe became Prime Minister last September.

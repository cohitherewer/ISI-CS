 Europe boils

 Athens, June 27 (Reuters): A heat wave has killed at least 35 people in parts of southeast Europe and hit wildlife and crops, from the humble toad in Greek lagoons to grain across the region, while fruit is ripening weeks early in Italy.

 Greece is experiencing its worst heatwave in 110 years that has already killed eight people, with temperatures reaching 46 degrees Celsius during five days of sweltering weather that showed no signs today of letting up.

 Tourists and locals fled fires sweeping the island of Poros, about two hours from Piraeus port near Athens, as firefighters, planes and a helicopter battled to control the flames.

 In southern Italy, after the hottest spring in nearly two centuries, this years harvest of grapes and other fruit and vegetables is expected to be as much as a month earlier than usual, at the beginning of August.

 The heat is literally cooking Sicilian lemons on the trees, said farmers group Coldiretti, while watermelons, peppers, courgettes, peaches and tomatoes are also at risk.

 Greeces flora and fauna are suffering and environmentalists warned the scorching temperatures could have a long-term effect on animal populations and plants.

 Birds, now in their nesting period, laying eggs in exposed nests are at a very high risk, Martin Gaethlich of the Hellenic Society for the Protection of Nature said.

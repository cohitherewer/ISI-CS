 Iran hangs 9 in public execution

 Tehran, Aug. 1 (Reuters): Iran today hanged nine men sentenced to death for rape, armed robbery and other crimes, most of them executed in public in front of a crowd of onlookers, state media reported.

 It followed last months hanging of at least 16 convicted criminals in the Islamic state, which according to Amnesty International has one of the highest rates of executions in the world, and rising.

 Implementation of justice equals improving security, read a banner on the gallows above five hanging bodies in the northeastern city of Mashhad, state television footage showed. It also showed the handcuffed convicts just before being hanged. Two convicted criminals were executed in another location in Mashhad while two were put to death in a southeastern city.

 Police have arrested dozens of drug addicts, smugglers, rapists and murderers during a summer crackdown on crime and immoral behaviour. Tehran public prosecutor Saeed Mortazavi said last week 17 more criminals would be hanged soon.

 Castro video

 Havana, Jan. 31 (AP): A stronger-looking Fidel Castro said his recovery from an intestinal ailment was far from a lost battle as state television showed a video of him meeting Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez almost six months to the day after he temporarily gave up power.

 Castro stood, appeared alert and was shown drinking juice in the 10-minute video clip that was aired yesterday, but which state TV said was shot during Chavezs previously unannounced visit to Havana on Monday.

 The newest images the first in three months appeared aimed at deflating the latest rumours about Castros health. Cuba has kept Castros condition and exact ailment secret, sparking speculation among average Cubans and his foes in exile.

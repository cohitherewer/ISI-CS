 Doubts over Madonnas guitar solo at concert

 MATTHEW MOORE

 London, July 11: Debate is raging on Internet message boards over whether Madonnas rocking Live Earth performance owed more to technical wizadry than musical talent.

 Millions of people around the world saw the American singer, not known for her strumming skills, wrap a guitar strap around her neck and play along to her hit Ray of Light on Saturday night. 

 The packed Wembley Stadium crowd loved the unexpected flourish, but cynics have suggested that Madonna may not have actually been playing the instrument. 

 The Queen of Pop has, apparently, been taking lessons, but gossips have questioned whether she is yet sufficiently proficient to perform live.

 It has also been claimed that the length of Madonnas fingernails would make it impossible to play the guitar properly, although a close inspection of photographs from the show reveal she had them closely clipped for the occasion. Other music fans have suggested that the slightly amateurish sound was proof enough that it was a genuine live show. Jungle jungle wrote on the Yahoo message board: She did a few mistakes also.. her timing was out... perhaps she should stick to singing.

 Ive never seen Madonna play an electric guitar before she thinks shes Jimi Hendrix you have to see the feedback trick she did at the end of the first song, said DudeAsInCool on the BeatKing music website.

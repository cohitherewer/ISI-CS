 Dhaka slams Ramesh

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ramesh: Scolded

 New Delhi, July 25: The first tell-tale signs of tension are beginning to appear between India and Bangladesh, with Dhaka criticising junior commerce minister Jairam Rameshs remarks on its polity as being out of place.

 Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee summoned Ramesh for talks in Delhi but it was not clear whether he was being scolded for his comments.

 During his weekend visit to Dhaka, Ramesh had remarked that a secular Bangladesh that respects diversity is important for us and that a government was chosen by its people in a free, fair and credible election.

 Ramesh was clearly referring to the army-led caretaker governments growing opaque take on domestic politics, which included the arrest of Awami League leader Sheikh Hasina. The foreign ministry had unusually criticised the arrest.

 There is concern in India that Dhaka is not taking action against the Jamait parties, leaving the field free as the government cracks down on the other two mainstream political groupings.

 Our attention has been drawn to a news item in certain sections of the media attributing remarks to the visiting Indian state minister for commerce to the effect that India of course is committed to seeing Bangladesh as a secular, democratic and peaceful country, the Bangladesh foreign office said.

 We wish to point out that such remarks would be out of place, as these are values that are already deeply ingrained in our social and political ethos.

 Only Bangladeshis will determine how their political and social system is organised, it said.

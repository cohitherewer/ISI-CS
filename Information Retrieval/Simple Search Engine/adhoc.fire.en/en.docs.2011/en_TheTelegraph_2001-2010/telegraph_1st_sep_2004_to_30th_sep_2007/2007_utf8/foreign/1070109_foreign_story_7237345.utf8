 Dhaka, Jan. 8 (Reuters): Bangladeshs army chief was summoned to the presidential palace today following a day of renewed clashes between police and political activists two weeks before parliamentary elections.

 At least 50 people were injured and 30 detained on the second day of a transport blockade, called by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas multi-party alliance, which is boycotting the January 22 vote.

 Police used batons and tear gas to disperse Hasinas stone-throwing supporters after they set ablaze several vehicles across Dhaka and its outskirts, witnesses said. As the violence spread, caretaker President Iajuddin Ahmed summoned army chief Lieutenant-General Moiuddin U. Khan to the presidential palace. 

 Officials said they might discuss the latest developments and possible ways to restore order ahead of the polls.

 Army troops, who are patrolling the streets of Dhaka, have so far avoided direct confrontation with the activists. About 70 people were injured yesterday, the first day of the three-day blockade.

 Hasinas alliance called for the blockade in protest at what it sees as the interim governments inability to hold a free and fair vote. 

 Today, buses and lorries did not operate, deliveries from ports were suspended and most businesses and educational institutions were closed. Rail and ferry services were also disrupted.

 Some taxis and rickshaws were operating within Dhaka but alliance activists manned strategic points to prevent vehicles entering and leaving the city.

 Bill reveals Michelangelo room in St Peters

 Vatican City, Feb. 17 (AP): A 450-year-old receipt has provided proof that Michelangelo kept a private room in St Peters Basilica while working as the popes chief architect, Vatican experts said.

 Going through their archives for an exhibit on the 500th anniversary of the basilica, researchers from the Fabbrica di San Pietro, the office where all documents concerning the running of the basilica are kept, came across an entry for a key to a chest in the room in St Peters where Master Michelangelo retires.

 The Renaissance painter and sculptor whose frescoes adorn the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican was put in charge of the restoration of St Peters Basilica by Pope Paul III in 1546, a job he held until his death in 1564. His greatest contribution to the basilica is its central dome or cupola, a universally acknowledged architectural triumph.

 We now know that Michelangelo definitely had a private space in the basilica, Maria Cristina Carlo-Stella, who runs the Fabbrica, said in an interview this week. The next step is to identify it.

 The ink-scripted entry contained in a parchment-covered volume listing the expenditures of the Fabbrica for the years 1556-1558, refers to the payment of 10 scudos to the blacksmith who forged the key, but offers no details about the chest or the location of the room.

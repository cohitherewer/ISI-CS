 Embassy blasts

 Tehran, April 1 (Reuters): Several small blasts rocked the British embassy in Iran and smoke rose from inside the compound in central Tehran today during a protest over 15 detained sailors and marines, but no one was hurt.

 Britain said no damage had been done and no one was hurt in the protest by about 100 people. Reuters witnesses also said the blasts did not appear to do any damage, although each sent a small plume of smoke into the air.

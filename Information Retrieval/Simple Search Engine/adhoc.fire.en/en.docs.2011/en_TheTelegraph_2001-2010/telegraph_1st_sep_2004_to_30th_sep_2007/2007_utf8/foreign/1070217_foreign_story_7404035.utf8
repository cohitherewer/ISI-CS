 Robot snow plough

 Middleburg (Pennsylvania), Feb. 16 (AP): The wintry blast was a perfect opportunity for Bill Lauver to put his robot plough through its paces.

 For three years, Lauver has often done snow clearing from the comfort of his living room, watching from the window as the converted golf cart with plough attachment plies the drive while he operates the remote control. Lauver said the plow is a converted 4 horsepower electric golf cart, geared down for a slower speed and more power to shove snow.

 Urinals that warn drunks

 Santa Fe, New Mexico (Reuters): In a novel move to curb drunk driving, New Mexico is using talking urinals to remind drinkers to not get behind the wheel when drunk. The state transportation department said on Thursday it has put some 500 talking deodorisers in bar and restaurant restrooms in the state to remind drivers not to drink and drive. Hey big guy, having a few drinks? Then listen up! a voice chirps in. Think you had one too many? Then its time to call a cab. 

 or call a sober friend for a ride home.

 Transportation department spokesman SU Mahesh said the motion-activated devices were part of an attempt tothink outside the box to tackle drunk driving in the state.

 We have a big problem here in New Mexico. ... Hopefully this will be a humorous and also serious way to catch men before they go to their cars and say to them its not worth it to drink and drive, Mahesh told Reuters.

 Mahesh said the devices, which are manufactured by New York-based Healthquest Technologies Inc., have been used elsewhere in the United States, but never as part of a statewide campaign.

 If the project is successful he hopes bars and restaurants will continue to purchase the battery-operated gadgets, which cost $21 each and last three months.

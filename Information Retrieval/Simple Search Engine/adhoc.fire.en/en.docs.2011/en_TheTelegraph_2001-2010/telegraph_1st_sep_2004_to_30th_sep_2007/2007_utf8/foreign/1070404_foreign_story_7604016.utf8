 On Board Train V150 (France), April 3 (Reuters): A French TGV train broke a world speed record today when it hurtled down a newly built track at 574.8 kmph in the Champagne region.

 Both the President and the Prime Minister saluted the achievement, a morale-booster for a nation that prides itself on its technological knowhow.

 The special train called V150, an enhanced version of trains that will run on the Paris-Strasbourg line from June 10, has been preparing for the record run for weeks and carried journalists and other guests for the official attempt.

 From about 380 kmph, vibrations in the train became more and more noticeable. At 490 kmph passengers became slightly dizzy. At 540 kmph it became difficult to remain standing despite the stability of the train.

 At 570 kmph, the driver filmed on camera wore a very big smile. We had no worries no birds, good weather, none of the troubles we had during the tests, said driver Eric Pieczak. Live television images showed bystanders on overhead bridges cheering as the chromium and black coloured train roared past, followed by an aircraft filming the run.

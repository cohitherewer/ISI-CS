 Zawahri mocks Bush Iraq plan

 Dubai, Jan. 23 (Reuters): Al Qaida deputy leader Ayman al-Zawahri mocked President George W. Bushs plan to send more troops to Iraq, saying militants could wipe out the entire US army, according to an Internet video posted on Monday.

 Zawahris comments were published on the website of the US-based SITE institute, www.siteinstitute.org, which searches and analyses militant networks. It said the video was broadcast on al Qaidas multimedia arm as-Sahab, which it monitors.

 Why send 20,000 only? Why not send 50 or 100,000? Arent you aware that the dogs of Iraq are pining for your troops dead bodies? he said. Bush plans to send a further 21,500 US soldiers to Iraq to help the government improve security, particularly in Baghdad.

 Zawahri taunted Bush further by inviting him to send the whole US army to Iraq, and said the mujahideen were capable of destroying the equivalent of 10 armies.

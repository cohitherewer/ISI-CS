 JLo in tears at NY school

 New York, Sept. 26 (AP): Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony paid an emotional visit yesterday to an elementary school in the Bronx, just blocks from where the actress and singer who starred in Selena grew up.

 That was so ... Oh my God, what did you do to me? Look at my makeup! said a teary Lopez after hundreds of schoolchildren greeted the couple with cheers, broad smiles, flowers and artwork made just for them. Three days before they launch a musical tour to support a childrens health campaign.

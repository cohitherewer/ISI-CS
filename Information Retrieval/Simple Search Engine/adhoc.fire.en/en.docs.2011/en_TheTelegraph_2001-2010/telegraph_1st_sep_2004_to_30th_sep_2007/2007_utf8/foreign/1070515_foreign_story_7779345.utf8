 Blooker for Iraq war diary

 Colby Buzzell: Bold blog

 London, May 14 (Reuters): An American soldiers violent and darkly comic account of fighting in Iraq has won the Blooker prize for best book that began as a blog on the Internet.

 Colby Buzzell, whose Internet diary became the book My War, started posting online from a Sunni triangle frontline Internet tent as a way to kill time. The book won the second annual $10,000 prize sponsored by publishing website www.lulu.com. His blog allowed him to explain the war to readers back home with an immediacy he couldnt have matched in a regular book written after he returned, he said by phone from Los Angeles.

 I would come back after missions, my ears still ringing from the firefight, and sit down and write about it, he said. Ive been back two years. If someone told me to write a book about Iraq now, I wouldnt know where to start. 

 While he was still in Iraq, the military, citing security, ordered Buzzell to stop posting his notes on the Web. A soldier writing on a blog for the whole world to read made them extremely nervous. This was the first war where the Internet was such a part of it, and they were nervous about that, he said of his commanders who ordered him off line.

 But he said other soldiers are still posting on the Web.

 The more blogs and the more books and the more writing that comes out of the war, the more understanding there will be. People here are oblivious to what our soldiers are going through every day. Buzzell was inspired in part by Kurt Vonnegut, the author who survived the fire-bombing of Dresden during World War II.

 Vonnegut, who died last month, called Buzzells book nothing less than the soul of an extremely interesting human being at war on our behalf in Iraq. He sent Buzzell a postcard from one veteran and writer to another, which Buzzell keeps.

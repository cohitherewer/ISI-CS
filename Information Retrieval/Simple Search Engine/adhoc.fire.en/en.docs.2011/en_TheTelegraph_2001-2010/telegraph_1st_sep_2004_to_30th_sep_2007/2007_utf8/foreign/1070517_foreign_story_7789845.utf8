Boston, May 16 (Reuters): Harvard University yesterday approved its biggest curriculum overhaul in three decades, putting new emphasis on sensitive religious and cultural issues, the sciences and overcoming US parochialism.

 The curriculum change, proposed on February 8 after three years of faculty debate, is intended to counter criticism that the oldest US institute of higher learning was focused too narrowly on academic topics instead of real-life issues.

 One of the eight new required subject areas societies of the world aims to help students overcome US parochialism by acquainting them with the values, customs and institutions that differ from their own, Harvard said. This new programme is the result of hundreds of hours of lively engagement by the faculty, David Pilbeam, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, said.

 Pilbeam will appoint a committee that will report back next year on how the new curriculum will be introduced. An earlier proposal would have made Harvard unique among the elite Ivy League group of long-established Northeastern US universities by requiring undergraduates to study religion as a distinct subject.

 The changes to the general-education requirements, imposed on students outside their major areas of study, still address religious beliefs and practices. 

 Study of those issues would be folded into a broader subject of culture and belief. The culture and belief requirement willintroduce students to ideas, art and religion in the context of the social, political, religious, economic and cross-cultural conditions that shape them, Harvard said. 

 Under the changes, science wins greater prominence, including the study of the ethical issues surrounding embryonic stem cell research, which has raised hope for cures for ailments such as Alzheimers disease, while being opposed by others as an immoral destruction of human life.

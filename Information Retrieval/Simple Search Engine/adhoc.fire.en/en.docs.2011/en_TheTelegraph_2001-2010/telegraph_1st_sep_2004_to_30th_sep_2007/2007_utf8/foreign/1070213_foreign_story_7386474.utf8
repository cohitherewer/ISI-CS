 Afghan governor fears Taliban raid on dam

 Spin Boldak (Afghanistan), Feb. 12 (Reuters): At least 700 Taliban fighters have crossed from Pakistan into Afghanistan to reinforce guerrillas attacking a key dam, a major source of electricity and irrigation, a provincial governor said today.

 We have got confirmed reports that they are Pakistani, Uzbek and Chechen nationals and have sneaked in, Helmand governor Asadullah Wafa said by telephone. The Kajaki dam has seen major fighting in recent weeks between the Taliban and Nato forces, mainly British and Dutch.

 Nato-led troops have been conducting operations in the area for several months to allow reconstruction on the dam and the power transmission lines to boost output, after fighting halted refurbishment last year.

 A spokesman for the Nato-led force confirmed rebel movements in the dam area, including across the border, but could not confirm the governors numbers or any other details.

 Built by the Soviets in 1953, the dam irrigates about 142,000 hectares of farmland and two hydroelectic plants built by the US in 1975 have a capacity of 33 megawatts. A third plant is planned, which would almost double that capacity by 2009.

 Nato, US and Taliban commanders warn a major offensive will come in spring when the snows melt in a few months, after the bloodiest year since the hardline Islamists were ousted by a US-led coalition in 2001.

 More than 4,000 people died in fighting last year.

 Wafa said the Taliban fighters were brought in by local commanders for a joint operation with al Qaida.

 They are planning to destroy the Kajaki dam, he said, accusing Pakistans military intelligence agency, ISI, of providing training and logistical support for the guerrillas.

 Pakistan is supporting the Taliban in order for them to keep fighting on in Afghanistan. They dont want Afghanistans development and reconstruction, he said.

 Pakistan denies continuing to support the Taliban, its former protege, but Afghan officials say it still does. The US says the guerrillas benefit from safe havens in Pakistan and support from fellow Pashtun tribes, but also rejects charges Islamabad officially supports the resurgent rebels.

 Several Taliban fighters were also killed today in an attack targeting a senior guerrilla leader closely linked to the Islamist movements fugitive leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, the US-led coalition said in a statement.

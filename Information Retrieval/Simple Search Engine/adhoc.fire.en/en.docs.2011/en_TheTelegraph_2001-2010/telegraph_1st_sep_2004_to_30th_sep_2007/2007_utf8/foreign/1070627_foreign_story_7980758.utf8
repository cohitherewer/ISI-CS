 Ershad faces rebellion

 Dhaka, June 26 (Reuters): Former Bangladesh military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad today faced a rebellion in his own party from challengers led by his wife Rowshan Ershad.

 The rebels announced that Ershad, who ruled the country for 10 years until he was ousted in 1990, had been replaced as Jatiya Party leader by Rowshan.

 Ershads wife, the ex-strongmans political number two, told a hurriedly called news conference that from now on I am the acting head of the Jatiya Party.

 Ershad is no longer its chief, she said. One man cannot run the party for ever and the time has come to end his absolute authority over the party. Jatiya is the countrys third biggest party after the Awami League and Bangladesh Nationalist Party.

 Ershad told a separate news briefing he remained at the party helm and vowed:I will expel her from the party for gross indiscipline and disobedience. Rowshan, twice estranged from Ershad but reunited in 1990, said today she had the support of a majority of Jatiya party seniors and policy makers.

 Bush message to Russia

 Tirana, Albania, June 10 (AP): President George W. Bush, receiving a heros welcome as the first American President to visit Albania, said today that there cannot be endless dialogue about achieving independence for neighbouring Kosovo.

 At some point in time sooner rather than later youve got to say Enough is enough. Kosovo is independent and thats the position weve taken, Bush said during a news conference with the Prime Minister of this impoverished Balkan country.

 Bushs press for statehood was aimed at Russia and others that object to Kosovos independence. Standing alongside Prime Minister Sali Berisha, Bush said any extension of talks on Kosovo must have certain independence as the goal.

 In response to Albanias push for Nato membership, Bush said additional political and military reforms were needed before that could be considered something the countrys leaders said they understood.

 We are determined to take any decision, adopt any law, undertake any reform that would make Albania suitable to receive the invitation to join the western military alliance, Berisha said.

 The issue of independence for the Serbian province of Kosovo is one of the issues on which the US and Russia disagree.

 Russia, an ally of Serbia, contends independence for Kosovo would set a dangerous precedent for the worlds other breakaway regions.

 Serbia also opposes statehood for Kosovo, which it sees as the heart of its historic homeland.

 Kosovo has been administered by the UN since a 1999 war between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian rebels.

 Lanka clashes

 Colombo, April 11 (Reuters): Sri Lankas military killed at least 20 Tamil Tiger rebels after a mortar attack in the north that killed one soldier, and later seized a road in the east that was rebel-held for 13 years, the military said today.

 The Tigers denied any losses in the battle which took place in Vavuniya district yesterday, and instead said they had killed 10 government soldiers in a separate clash overnight in the same region.

 The fighting extended a rash of near daily battles between the government and the rebels, who are trying to establish an independent state.

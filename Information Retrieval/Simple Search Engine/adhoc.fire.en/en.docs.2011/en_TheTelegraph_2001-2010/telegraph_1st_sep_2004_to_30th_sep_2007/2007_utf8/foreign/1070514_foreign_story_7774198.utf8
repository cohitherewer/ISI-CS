 Last word? Not yet, JKs plotting a guide

 JAMES LANGTON

 Rowling

 London, May 13: Whatever the fate of Harry Potter in his final book, one thing seemed sure: there would be a parting of the ways from J.K. Rowling.

 Now, however, it appears that the seventh volume in the series may not spell the end of their relationship after all.

 The writer is understood to be preparing for one last look at the world of Harry, Hermione, Dumbledore and Voldemort after the publication of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in July.

 Using background notes from the past decade, Rowling, 41, is set to compile an encyclopedia of magic to create the ultimate guide to the world of wizardry.

 It would cover historical figures, such as the founders of Hogwarts school, along with elaborate genealogies of the main characters.

 It would also provide a chance to flesh out other figures who merit only a passing mention in the books.

 In March, Rowling described her sadness at reaching the end of the series.

 I always knew that Harrys story would end with the seventh book, but saying goodbye has been just as hard as I always knew it would be, she wrote on her website.

 Ive never felt such a mixture of extreme emotions in my life, never dreamed I could feel simultaneously heartbroken and euphoric.

 But suggestions of the plan have now appeared on her website, JKRowling.com.

 Despite telling fans that it was highly unlikely that she would write any more Harry Potter novels, she wrote: I might do an eighth book for charity, a kind of encyclopedia of the world so that I could use all the extra material thats not in the books.

 The tantalising possibility has been confirmed by her agent, Christopher Little, who said Rowling had retained all the rights in the Harry Potter series and pointed out that this included any companion books which she may indeed write herself.

 The prospect of an authorised Harry Potter encyclopedia will have fans and booksellers salivating. Rowlings notes are believed to be almost as detailed as those made by JRR Tolkien for his fantasy Middle-earth, the setting of The Hobbit and his The Lord of the Rings trilogy.

 Sales of the encyclopedia would almost certainly rival those of Deathly Hallows, which has advance sales of 1.5 million on the internet store Amazon alone. It is tipped to break publishing records when it goes on worldwide sale on July 21.

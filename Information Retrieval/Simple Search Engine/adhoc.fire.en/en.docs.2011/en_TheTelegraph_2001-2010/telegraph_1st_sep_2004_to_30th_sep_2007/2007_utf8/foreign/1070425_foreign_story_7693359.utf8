 New Delhi, April 24: The Palaly military airbase in Northern Sri Lanka that was attacked by a Tamil Tiger air craft last night the second aerial attack by the LTTE in a month was being upgraded by the Indian Air Force and an IAF team was overseeing the work till recently.

 In a quiet agreement reached in December 2005, India agreed to supply Indra 2D radars made by defence public sector Bharat Electronics Limited and upgrade the Palaly airbase. The Palaly airbase is strategic for the Sri Lankan military because it is crucial for military supplies and operations in and around Jaffna. 

 But it is also important from the Indian strategic perspective because keeping it functional enough for the Sri Lankan forces is a responsibility shared by India. It is also a responsibility that India is loathe to advertise because of domestic political compulsions.

 The tarmac of the airbase was damaged in 2000 by LTTE artillery shelling. After much persuasion from Colombo to sign a Defence Cooperation Agreement that is still in limbo India agreed to extend military training and upgradation for Sri Lankan Air Force facilities and personnel in December 2005.

 This time the LTTE is suspected to have used one of its two Czech-made Zlin 143 aircraft to attack Palaly, though the damage is of a lesser magnitude than that in Katunayake.

 The then defence minister, Pranab Mukherjee, pushed through a Rs 50 crore aid to upgrade Palaly and its defences along with a package to install Indian-made radars at Katunayake military air base, Trincomalee and Vavuniya. Tamil Nadu politician and MDMK leader Vaiko had also questioned the deal. 

 The agreement was clinched during a visit of then Sri Lanka army commander, Lt General, Lionel Balagalles visit to New Delhi.

 The Palaly runway was being re-built by the Sri Lankan Road Building Authority with the Indian Air Force acting as consultant. Sri Lanka was also asking India for air defence systems.

 After the Katunayake attack on March 26, it was suggested in Colombo the India-supplied Indra radar had failed. But Indian authorities said that was not the case. The IAFs southern command also quickly moved mobile radar units to the coast facing Sri Lanka. 

 Despite the assistance, the LTTE has been able to attack Palaly. An IAF source said the Sri Lankan air force had not sent their personnel in adequate number for training with the IAF.

 Treasure trash

 Philadelphia, Aug. 5 (AP): An antiques collector stumbled upon a 19th century Civil War-era rarity that was about to be trashed.

 Antiques collector Stephen Burns discovered that a pile of periodicals intended for the garbage heap turned out to be dozens of issues of Little Pilgrim, a childrens reader published in Philadelphia in the 1850s and 60s. The periodical featured fiction, poetry, riddles and other items for young readers. 

 Sex amp; work

 Berlin (Reuters): German 

 workaholics may be suffering from a lack of sex, according 

 to a university study. A survey of 32,000 men and women 

 by researchers at the University of Goettingen found over 

 35 per cent of those reporting unsatisfying sex lives tended 

 to use hard work as a diversion.

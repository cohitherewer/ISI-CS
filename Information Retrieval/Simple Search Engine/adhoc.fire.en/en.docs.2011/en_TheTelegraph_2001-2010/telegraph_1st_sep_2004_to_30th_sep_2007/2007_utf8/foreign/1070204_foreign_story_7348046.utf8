 Faith insult

 Islamabad, Feb. 3 (Reuters): A Christian woman in Pakistan was being held by police for insulting the Prophet Mohammad, a crime that carries death penalty, police said today.

 Martha Bibi, 40, says she was unaware the words she uttered were blasphemous and has pleaded for forgiveness, Investigating officer, Mohammad Rafiq Khan said by telephone from Chhanga Manga, a town 70 km south of Lahore, Punjabs provincial capital. Bibi was arrested in Kot Nanak Singh village, near Chhanga Manga, on January 22, based on the word of a fellow villager, but reports of her plight only surfaced in the media today.

 We shifted her to Kasur jail the very next day for safety reasons, as people in the area were very furious, Khan said. Blasphemy cases are fairly common, but death sentences have never been carried out because convictions have always been overturned by high courts for lack of evidence, though there have been incidents where accused have been killed by mobs.

 Rights groups say people often make accusations of blasphemy against people they hold a grudge against or belong to a different faith. The government plans to change the law, probably after parliamentary elections due either late this year, or early 2008. The Pakistan Muslim League, leading the ruling coalition, does not want to hand Islamist Opposition parties an issue before the elections, as it could cost them votes among a conservative electorate.

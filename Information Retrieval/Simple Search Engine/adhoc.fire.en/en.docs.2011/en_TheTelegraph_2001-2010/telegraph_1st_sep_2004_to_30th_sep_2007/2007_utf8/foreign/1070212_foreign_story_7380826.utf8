 Dhaka, Feb. 11 (Reuters): Bangladeshs 2006 Nobel Prize Peace winner Muhammad Yunus said today he might launch a political party and stand for elections for the welfare of the country.

 Yunus, known as the banker to the poor, said he had written an open letter to countrymen asking for their views on his plans to enter politics.

 I am ready to float a party if you think my association with politics is necessary, Yunus said in the letter which he read out to reporters. I think it is the right time to take decision (for joining politics) with the support of the people. 

 His comments come at a time when the army-backed interim administration has launched a major drive to clean up politics ahead of elections, detaining more than 60 political leaders from the mainstream parties over allegations of graft and abuse of power.

 Yunus said, depending on the peoples response to his letter, he would launch his party to participate in the next general election. The date for the poll has not yet been announced.

 Anti-graft official

 Bangladeshs third and last anti-corruption commissioner stepped down today after being accused of graft. The three-member commission, which was formed in late 2004, reportedly came under pressure from the interim government for allegedly failing to pursue graft during Prime Minister Khaleda Zias tenure, which expired in October 2006.

 Maniruddin Ahmed quit days after two other colleagues resigned.

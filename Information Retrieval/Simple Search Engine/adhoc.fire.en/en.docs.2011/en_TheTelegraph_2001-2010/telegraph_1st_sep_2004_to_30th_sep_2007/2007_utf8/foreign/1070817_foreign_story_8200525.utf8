 Sex-on-duty officer acquitted

 London, Aug. 16 (PTI): A senior British police officer who had sex with a woman while on duty was cleared of any offence as he had kept his radio earpiece switched on throughout.

 A jury at Southwark Crown Court acquitted British Transport Police inspector Masood Khan after he claimed that he was always poised and ready to respond to an emergency as he had his earpiece in, the Daily Mail said today. 

 It was an absolutely wrong thing to do, morally and professionally, and i shouldnt have done that. (however) if there was a call for me I would have answered it and dealt with it, he told jurors.

 The 41-year-old officer was charged with misconduct in a public office after a 20-minute tryst in a police office with a woman he had met on an Internet dating site.

 Khan met the woman on July 23 last year on an internet dating site which arranged their meeting at Gatwick airports rail station. He arrived at the station in full uniform and CCTV footage showed the couple going into a sparsely-furnished police office and emerging 20 minutes later.

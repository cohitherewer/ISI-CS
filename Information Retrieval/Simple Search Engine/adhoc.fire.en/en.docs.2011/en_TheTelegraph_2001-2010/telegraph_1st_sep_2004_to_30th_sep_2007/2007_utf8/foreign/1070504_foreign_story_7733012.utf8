 Wolfowitz denies breaking rules

 Defiant

 Washington, May 3 (Reuters): World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz denied today he went beyond the banks ethics guidelines in arranging a transfer and pay rise for his companion.

 He rebutted comments by some former bank officials that he broke staff rules.

 In a letter sent to a bank committee examining his role in arranging the raise for West Asia expert Shaha Riza, Wolfowitz said he had acted in good faith in the matter. He added that he was deeply troubled and dismayed by remarks made by former officials Ad Melkert and Roberto Danino in recent days.

 While I am prepared to acknowledge that we all acted in good faith at the time and there was perhaps some confusion and miscommunication among us, it is grossly unfair and wrong to suggest that I intended to mislead anyone, and I urge the committee to reject the allegation that I lack credibility, Wolfowitz wrote.

 Wolfowitz for several weeks has defied calls for his resignation over the matter as the ad hoc committee of bank executive directors investigates whether he broke ethics rules in arranging the promotion and transfer for Riza after he was appointed head of the development bank in 2005.

 The New York Times reported today that the panel was expected to present its findings tomorrow to Wolfowitz and give him time to respond. The newspaper quoted bank officials as saying they are leaning toward finding that he violated the institutions rules on conflicts of interest.

 Melkert, who headed the banks ethics committee at the time of Rizas transfer to the state department, told the panel on Tuesday that Wolfowitzs insistence on maintaining professional contacts with Riza violated staff rules.

 Travellers face greater data use

 PAUL LEWIS AND SPENCER S. HSU

 Washington, July 27: The US and the EU have agreed to expand a security programme that shares personal data about millions of US-bound airline passengers a year, potentially including information about a persons race, ethnicity, religion and health.

 Under the agreement, airlines flying from Europe to the US are required to provide data related to these matters to US authorities if it exists in their reservation systems. The deal allows Washington to retain and use it only where the life of a data subject or of others could be imperiled or seriously impaired.

 According to the deal, the information that can be used in such exceptional circumstances includes racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership and data about an individuals health and travelling partners.

 Airlines do not usually gather such data, but officials say it could wind up in passenger files as a result of requests for special services such as wheelchairs, or through routine questioning by airline personnel and travel agents about contacts, lodging, next of kin and travelling companions. The data now stored includes names, addresses and credit card information as well as telephone and email contacts, itineraries, and hotel and rental car reservations.

 The deal, signed yesterday by the US and approved on Monday in Europe, provoked alarm from privacy and civil-liberties groups on both sides of the Atlantic. What Americans should be concerned about is now here in black and white: The government will maintain a database of all travellers, said Jim Dempsey, policy director for the Center for Democracy and Technology, a advocacy group.

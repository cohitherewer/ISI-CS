 Atlantis undocks, heads home

 Cape Canaveral (Florida), June 19 (Reuters): Shuttle Atlantis started for home today, leaving the International Space Station with new solar power wings, a fresh crew member and a mystery over what knocked out the space stations computers.

 Commander Frederick Sturckow and pilot Lee Archambault gently eased Atlantis from its berthing port at 1442 GMT, then circled the shuttle around the station while the crew took pictures of their work on the complex.

 Cameras aboard both spacecraft televised the orbital ballet live, with Atlantiss empty cargo bay and thruster rocket firings visible against a black sky and the stations lanky symmetry restored with the new pair of sparkling wings.

 Its very exciting to see the station in this configuration, space station flight director Holly Ridings said. Atlantis was scheduled to land at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Thursday.

 The best guess as to what caused the computer crash appeared to be some subtle shift in the electrically charged plasma that the station flew through as it orbited 350 km above Earth. The theory is that the shift occurred as the stations shape and mass expanded with the addition of the 17-ton truss segments that hold the solar wings. The crash temporarily raised concerns the outpost would have to be abandoned.

 The US space agency Nasa had a rough start to the flight. A hail storm battered Atlantiss fuel tank, delaying the launch by three months. A June 8 liftoff was flawless, but troubles began shortly after Atlantis reached orbit.

 During an initial sweep of the shuttles heat shield to check for damage from the launch, engineers spotted a piece of thermal insulation that had torn loose from an engine pod at the back of the shuttle. The agency began an around-the-clock effort to determine if the shuttles condition was safe for atmospheric re-entry.

 The question has been in the forefront since the shuttle Columbia was destroyed, killing seven astronauts, in 2003e. Nasa added two days and a fourth spacewalk to the planned 11-day mission so the astronauts would have time to tuck the protruding thermal blanket back down.

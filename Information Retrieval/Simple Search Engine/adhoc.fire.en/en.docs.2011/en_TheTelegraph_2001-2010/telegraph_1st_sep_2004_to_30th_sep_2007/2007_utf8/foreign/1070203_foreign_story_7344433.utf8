 Kathmandu, Feb. 2: The multi-party Nepal government today formed a three-member ministerial team to hold talks with Madhesi groups who have brought life to a standstill in the Terai region of southern Nepal. 

 The committee, which is headed by agriculture and cooperatives minister Mahantha Thakur, will start talks with the agitating groups in order to restore peace and normalcy in the southern plains. 

 The other two members of the team are: Minister for local development Rajendra Pandey and minister of state for water resources Gyanendra Karki. 

 The naming of a three-member team came two days after Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala vowed to turn Nepal into a federal state and increase representation of ethnic groups in a constituent assembly due to be elected later this year.

 The decision to begin talks with the Madhesi groups was taken at a cabinet meeting today after a request for talks from the Madhesi Janadhikar Forum (MJF).

 The MJF is spearheading an agitation which began a fortnight ago. They are demanding equal status for the Indian-origin plains people in the Terai region. So far, 14 people have been killed in the violent agitation. Koirala also invited protest leaders for talks with the government in a bid to end the unrest in the southern plains.

 The team will listen to the grievances of the people in the Terai and discuss various alternatives (with protest leaders) to redress the problems, tourism minister Pradip Gyanwali said after a cabinet meeting.

 In a separate development, lawmakers representing the Terai region submitted a memorandum to Koirala urging him to resolve the crisis immediately by accepting the Madhesi demands. 

 Earlier, MJF chief Upendra Yadav demanded an end to police action against protests. He also said officials responsible for killing people he called peaceful protesters in the Terai should be punished before talks begin. The Prime Ministers offer (of a federal state) is unsatisfactory and does not address our demands completely. We will continue our protests until the genuine demands of the Madhesi people are met, he said.

 Yadavs party has led the protests, saying ruling elites dominated mainly by people from the hills had undermined them over jobs in the government, police, army and seats in parliament. Separately, public transport and shops in many districts of Nepals eastern hills were closed.

 Queen pokes fun at Bush

 Washington, May 9 (Reuters): Queen Elizabeth flashed a bit of royal wit at President George W. Bush yesterday, getting back at him for a faux pas a day earlier that nearly placed her in the 18th century.

 With a playful grin, the queen opened a dinner toast to the President saying: I wondered whether I should start this toast by saying: When I was here in 1776...

 The 104 guests invited to the black-tie gathering at the home of British ambassador David Manning erupted in laughter. Bush laughed along and the queen smiled broadly before continuing with her text. 

 Your Majesty, I cant top that one, Bush reciprocated, at the beginning of his toast.

 The President, no stranger to the occasional verbal gaffe, just barely stopped himself on Monday before dating the queen to 1776.

 Youve helped our nation celebrate its bicentennial in 17 in 1976, Bush said at a White House ceremony as he noted the Queens long history of dealing with successive US governments.

 Yesterdays dinner was the last formal event on the final day of a six-day state visit for the queen and Prince Phillip.

 For the event, the Queen wore a gold lace cocktail dress and a Brazilian aquamarine and diamond necklace with matching earrings. She said she enjoyed the chance to dwell on the history and friendship between the United States and Britain and thanked Americans for a warm welcome.

 Google in court over misleading practices

 LAURA CLOUT

 London, July 13: Google, the worlds biggest search engine, is to face a court case over allegations it is promoting deceptive business practices. 

 Brought by Australias competition watchdog, it is thought to be the first trading standards lawsuit against the firm, which is facing a string of other legal actions around the world. 

 The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) accuses Google of failing to do enough to distinguish between sponsored advertising links and so called organic search results. 

 Although advertisers are clearly identified at the top of each page and in the right-hand column, those same advertisers are likely to feature prominently in the main search results, where they are not identified as sponsors. 

 This, the ACCC asserts, is misleading and deceptive. 

 The commission also alleges that sponsored links on Google allow advertisers to represent themselves as having a link to other businesses, where one does not exist. 

 The complaint stems from advertising that appears on Googles website in 2005, for Trading Post, a newspaper advertising used cars. 

 The business paid Google to use the names of two rival car dealerships in links to its website. 

 The dealerships complained that potential customers who looked them up on Google were directed to the newspapers website, which competed with them for business. 

 Google said in a statement it would fight the allegations: Google Australia believe that these claims are without merit and we will defend against them vigorously.

 The legal dispute has prompted fears of a ripple effect on rival search engines around the world, such as Yahoo and MSN.

 Gender bender

 Sydney, Aug. 19 (AFP): An Australian transsexual is taking on the government over the gender on her passport before she travels for sex-change surgery in Thailand.

 Stefanie Imbruglia, a first cousin of pop star Natalie Imbruglia, told The Sun-Herald that legislation enacted three months ago prevented her listing an intended sex on her passport. As a result, when she travels to Thailand in October, she will be required either to travel on a passport naming her as a man, Stephen, or on a document of identity that would leave her genderless.

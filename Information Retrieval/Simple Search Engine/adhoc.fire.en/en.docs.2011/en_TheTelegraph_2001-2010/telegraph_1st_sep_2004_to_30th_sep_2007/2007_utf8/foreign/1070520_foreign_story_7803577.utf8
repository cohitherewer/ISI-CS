 George UK adieu

 London, May 19 (Reuters): Singer George Michael said he may quit Britain to escape the relentless media attention on his troubled private life.

 He admitted to a dependency on prescription drugs, called marijuana much less harmful than alcohol and said he had developed a very-self destructive streak since the death of his mother a decade ago.

 I have started thinking for the first time in my life that actually I shouldnt be living here, Michael told ITV talk show host Michael Parkinson in a show.

 Reflecting on the intense media coverage he has received, he said: I have got to think seriously about whether or not my love for my country is keeping me somewhere which is not good for me you know.

 Bad mom

 Los Angeles (AP): Anne Heches divorcing husband wants at least $33,000 (euro24,486) a month in support and joint custody of the couples 5-year-old son, saying the actress is a bad mother. In court filings this month, Coleman Laffoon says Heche has refused to allow their son, Homer, to be enrolled in a private kindergarten in southern California and has said she wants the boy to move to Vancouver, where she spends part of the year filming her TV show, Men in Trees.

 Star ashes

 Los Angeles (Reuters): They beamed him up and on Friday, after a three-week search, they found the rocket that had carried the ashes of Star Trek actor James Doohan briefly into space. The remains of Doohan, whose Star Trek character Scotty inspired the television catch phrase: Beam me up, Scotty, were blasted off to the edge of space from New Mexico on April 29, two years after his death at the age of 85. But the UP Aerospace Spaceloft XL rocket carrying the capsules with the ashes back to Earth got lost in rugged terrain and the search for it was hampered by bad weather.

 Reese kids

 Los Angeles (AP): Ryan Phillippe wants joint custody of his children with Walk the Line Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon. Witherspoon filed for divorce on November 8, citing irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split, and she asked for physical custody of the couples two children 7-year-old Ava and 3-year-old Deacon. In the court divorce petition, Witherspoon, 31, asked for visitation for Phillippe, 32, and exclusive use of the family residence. In a response filed on Tuesday, Phillippe also cited irreconcilable differences but asked for joint legal custody of the children.

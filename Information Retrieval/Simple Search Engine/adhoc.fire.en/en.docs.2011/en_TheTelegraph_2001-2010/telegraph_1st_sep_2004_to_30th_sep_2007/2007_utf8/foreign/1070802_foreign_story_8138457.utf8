The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Obama tough talk

 Washington,

 Aug. 1 (Reuters): Democratic presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama said today that the US must be willing to strike al Qaida targets inside Pakistan, adopting a tougher tone after a chief rival accused him of naivety in foreign policy.

 Obamas stance comes amid a debate in Washington over what to do about a resurgent al Qaida and Taliban in areas of Pakistan that President Musharraf has been unable to control. There are also concerns that new recruits are being trained there for a September 11-style attack against the US.

 If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf wont act, we will, Obama said.

 The Democrat is trying to convince Americans he has the foreign policy heft to be president as a rival candidate, New York Democratic Senator Hillary Clinton, questioned his readiness to be commander in chief.

 Clinton last week labelled Obama naive for saying he would be willing to meet the leaders of Iran, Cuba, Syria, North Korea and Venezuela without preconditions in his first year in office.

 A new poll conducted by The Wall Street Journal and NBC News said Clinton has widened her lead over Obama in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.

 It said 43 per cent of Democratic respondents said they preferred Clinton over other Democratic candidates in 2008, up from 39 percent in June. Obama tallied 22 per cent, down from 25 per cent in June.

 Those polled cited Clintons experience and competence highest among her positive attributes. Obama, a senator from Illinois, said in remarks prepared for a late-morning speech in Washington that if elected in November 2008, he would make hundreds of millions of dollars in US military aid to Pakistan conditional.

 I would make our conditions clear: Pakistan must make substantial progress in closing down the training camps, evicting foreign fighters, and preventing the Taliban from using Pakistan as a staging area for attacks in Afghanistan, Obama said. Obama also criticised President George W. Bushs emphasis on al Qaida in Iraq and said as President he would end the war in Iraq.

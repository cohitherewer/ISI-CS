 brighton (England), March 14 (Reuters): Heather Mills McCartney, the estranged wife of former Beatle Paul, wants to talk about dancing, not divorce.

 The 39-year-old, in the middle of a bitter divorce battle with the pop legend, sets off shortly for the US to compete in ABC TV channels Dancing with the Stars, a decision that raised eyebrows given that she has an artificial leg.

 In an interview to promote the show, Mills rebuffed accusations that she was in the televised dance competition only for the publicity, and joked about the prospect of flying limbs. If I was worried about critics, then I wouldnt do anything in my life, because this is the first thing Ive done for 10 months and Ive been chased and hounded for 10 months and told that Im a publicity seeker, she said. Yes, Ive got an artificial leg, yes, Im going to dance, yes, Im going to do the best I can, and hopefully it will inspire people, she said in Brighton. 

 It wont come off. As much as everyone would love it to go flying, Im sure its not going to come off.

 She said Jonathan Roberts, her professional dance partner on the show, had initially had misgivings. I think when Jonathan first met me it was: Oh my god, its her and shes got one leg. But by the fifth or sixth day of practising together, he quickly forgot about her artificial limb, Mills added. The main focus for me is the message I want to send out: you can overcome any disability and just do whatever you want to do if you set your mind to it. Millss left leg was amputated after being hit by a motorcycle in 1993.

 Reptiles in bags

 Cairo, Aug. 12 (Reuters): A Saudi passenger tried to smuggle a large number of reptiles, including cobras and infant Nile crocodiles, out of Egypt in his luggage, Egypts official Middle East News Agency reported today.

 The discovery of the reptiles in the passengers bags triggered a brief panic among security personnel at Cairo International Airport, witnesses said. The 22-year-old passenger, identified only as Anas, said he needed the reptiles for scientific research at his university in Saudi Arabia. His collection will be handed over to Egypts main zoo in Cairo.

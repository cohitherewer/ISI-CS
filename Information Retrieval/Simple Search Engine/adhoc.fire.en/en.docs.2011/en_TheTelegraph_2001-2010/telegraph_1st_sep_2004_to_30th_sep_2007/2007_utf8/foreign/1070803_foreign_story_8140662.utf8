 Bullying bosses drive workers to illness: Study

 NIC FLEMING

 London, Aug. 2: People with excessive workloads, tight deadlines and overbearing bosses are twice as likely to develop certain mental illnesses as those in less high pressured jobs. 

 Researchers found that every year around one in 20 workers become clinically depressed or anxious as a result of work stress. 

 The longer hours and commutes that are commonplace in modern working life, and the increased difficulty of juggling work with family life for many, are partly to blame for the growing medical and financial costs of mental ill health, they concluded. 

 Previous research suggests approximately one in six people suffer clinical depression or anxiety at some stage in their lives in the UK. 

 The annual cost in lost productivity to the economy has been estimated at 12 billion. 

 Dr Maria Melchior, of the Institute of Psychiatry, Kings College, London, lead author of the study published in the journal Psychological Medicine, said: Our study shows work stress appears to bring on diagnosable forms of depression and anxiety in previously healthy young workers. We found that high work pressure, high workload, working very quickly to tight inflexible deadlines doubled the risk of depression and anxiety. 

 Clearly we can also deduce work stress is associated with mental health problems of clinical significance that have health-care and financial implications for wider society. There is evidence from the WHO that work-related stress has increased in recent decades.

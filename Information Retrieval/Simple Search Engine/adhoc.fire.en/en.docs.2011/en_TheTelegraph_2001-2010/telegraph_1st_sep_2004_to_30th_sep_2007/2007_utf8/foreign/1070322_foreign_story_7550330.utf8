 Britney leaves Malibu rehab

 Los Angeles, March 21 (AP): Britney Spears has left rehab.

 The pop star checked out of Promises Malibu Alcohol and Drug Rehab Treatment Facility after successfully completing their programme, the pop stars manager, Larry Rudolph, said in a statement released by Jive Records late yesterday. We ask that the media respects her privacy as well as those of her family. 

 Spears, 25, entered the facility on February 22 after a bout of bizarre behaviour that included shaving her head and getting lips tattooed on her wrist.

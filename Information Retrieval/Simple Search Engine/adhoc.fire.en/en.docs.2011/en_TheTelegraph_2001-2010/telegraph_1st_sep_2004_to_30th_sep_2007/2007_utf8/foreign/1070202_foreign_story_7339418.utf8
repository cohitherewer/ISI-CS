 Mai irked by rising violence

 Lone crusader

 Karachi, Feb. 1 (Reuters): A Pakistani rape victim who became a prominent womens rights campaigner said today violence against women was increasing in Pakistan because authorities were not serious about punishing the perpetrators.

 Mukhtaran Mai, who was gangraped in 2002 on the orders of a traditional village council, said she was appalled by a similar attack on a 16-year-old girl at the weekend.

 Such inhuman acts are increasing in Pakistan as the government is not sincere about punishing offenders, Mai said today. 

 When I read about this girls ordeal, I felt the work we have done for women in the last four years was for nothing, she said.

 A group of Pakistani men has been accused of raping the 16-year old girl in the southern Sindh province at the weekend and forcing her to parade naked through her village because one of her relatives eloped with a young woman from the mens family. When I read about it I realised what this girl must have gone through, and all this in the name of honour, Mai said.

 Mai urged the government to provide swift justice for the girl.

 Mai was gangraped in Punjab province in 2002 as a punishment because her brother had had a relationship with a young woman without the approval of the womans family.

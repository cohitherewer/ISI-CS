 Brown smile

 Brown

 London, May 10 (Reuters): Sure of becoming Prime Minister after long years of waiting, Gordon Brown smiles much more now.

 Hes got tailored suits and whiter teeth, and is making a huge effort to appear more personable. But Britains finance minister still faces a battle to guide the increasingly unpopular Labour Party to a fourth successive election victory.

 The son of a clergyman, Browns serious style is very different from that of Prime Minister Tony Blair, the perenially upbeat lawyer.

 Perhaps I will soon be able to talk about things other than financial figures, the 56-year-old Scot said. I give news about the economy, and so the scope for great humour isnt really there. I cant just start cracking jokes about taxation.

 Brown says he always wanted to be footballer. But at 16, a sporting injury cost him an eye and put him in hospital for months. He was in danger of going completely blind. Every event that you face shapes you, he says. 

 Brown threw himself into Left-wing politics at Edinburgh University, his beliefs shaped by the poverty he saw growing up in Kirkcaldy, a town with a failing linoleum industry.

 The Brown Sugars miniskirted female fans cheered him to his first election victory as university rector. Colleagues remember the student Brown as being intensely driven and he remains a single-minded workaholic.

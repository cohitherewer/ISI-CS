 Iran slams hostile 300

 Tehran, March 13 (Reuters): Iran denounced Hollywoods latest blockbuster film, depicting the 480 BC battle between the Persian army and a band of Greeks, as hostile behaviour which is the result of cultural and psychological warfare.

 Last weeks North American opening of 300, while Tehran is embroiled in a standoff with western nations over its nuclear programme, led Iran and its film fans to see the movie as a western effort to vilify their nation through history. 

 But Iranians were clearly offended at the way their ancestors were portrayed in the film, inspired by the tale of 300 Spartans under King Leonidas who held out at Thermopylae against a Persian invasion led by Xerxes in 480 B.C.

 The government, lawmakers and Iranian Web logs (blogs) denounced the movie, which depicts the huge Persian army as ruthless but repeatedly outsmarted by the Greeks who are only defeated in the end by treachery.

 Even though the film by US director Zack Snyder has only just hit theatres in the US, poor quality pirated copies are already available in the Iranian capital.

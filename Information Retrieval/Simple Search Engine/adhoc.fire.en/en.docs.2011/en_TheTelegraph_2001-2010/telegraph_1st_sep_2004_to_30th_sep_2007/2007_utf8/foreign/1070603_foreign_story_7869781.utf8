 Kathmandu, June 2 (AP): The US is concerned that former rebels in Nepal continue to use violence despite joining the government and signing a peace agreement, a senior US official said today.

 The message of the US is clear; one cannot have ... bullets in a democratic process, said Barry Lowenkron, US assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, who is visiting Nepal.

 Lowenkron met Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala and other top officials to discuss Nepals peace process and coming Constituent Assembly elections that is to draft a new constitution, decide the fate of the monarchy and the countrys future political system.

 He said the US was concerned that the communists are still using violence even though the former rebels announced they had abandoned their armed revolt and joined the government.

 Nothing justifies the use of violence as a political tool, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Fake flak for BBC director

 Yentob: Under fire

 London, Sept. 23: A senior BBC executive was under pressure to quit last night after being criticised by some of the corporations biggest names.

 Demands for Alan Yentob, the creative director, to resign came after it emerged that footage of him had been inserted into programmes to give the false impression that he had conducted interviews actually carried out by junior staff members.

 The BBC has bowed to pressure and admitted that Yentobs behaviour was unacceptable. It said the practice would not be allowed to continue.

 But other BBC employees are furious that the corporation has spared Yentob from disciplinary action after it forced a wave of resignations last week from junior members of staff who committed similar breaches.

 Staff contacted by The Sunday Telegraph, including some of the BBCs best known names, said Yentobs extraordinary behaviour should be the subject of disciplinary action.

 The Alan Yentob business is the most serious allegation, said one senior broadcaster who asked not to be named. Another said: He is guilty of deception and should be for the high jump like all the others.

 A third broadcaster said: If he has done this than he should retire.

 Last night, Luke Crawley, the assistant general secretary of the broadcasting union Bectu, called on the corporation to take action against Yentob. He added: Alan Yentob should be subject to the disciplinary process, just like anyone else.

 The controversy surrounds the arts programme Imagine which Yentob, 60, presents. Recent guests have included David Bowie and Gilbert and George. Yentob, who is a former controller of both BBC1 and BBC2, has been shown responding to interviewees he never met.

 These shots were then slotted into the final programme to give the impression he had personally conducted the interviews. Such noddy shots are often used by TV producers, but they are meant to be of presenters who have carried out earlier interviews.

 A BBC spokesperson insisted that Yentob had conducted the vast majority of his interviews and that he had been absent on only a handful of occasions, but he could not say how many.

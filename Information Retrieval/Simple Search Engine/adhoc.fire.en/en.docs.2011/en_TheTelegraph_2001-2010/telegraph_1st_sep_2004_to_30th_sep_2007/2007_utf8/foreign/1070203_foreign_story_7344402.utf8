 Pak guards helping militants, says Pervez 

 Rawalpindi, Feb. 2 (AP): President Pervez Musharraf acknowledged today that outgunned Pakistani frontier guards have allowed insurgents to cross into Afghanistan but strongly denied the army or intelligence service was actively helping the Taliban.

 Musharraf claimed Pakistan was being made a scapegoat for the bloodiest surge in violence in Afghanistan since the fundamentalist Taliban regime was ousted five years ago for hosting al Qaida. He asserted that most militants originated in Afghanistan and were led from there.

 A misperception is being created that the resurgence of Taliban is from Pakistan. This is absolutely wrong. The resurgence of the Taliban is in Afghanistan, but some support goes from Pakistan, Musharraf told a news conference at his army office in Rawalpindi. 

 He announced the army he leads would soon fence parts of the porous border to stop militant infiltration.

 Musharrafs robust defence of Pakistans efforts in the US-led war on terrorism follow criticism from US military officials who say cross-border attacks into Afghanistan have risen since Pakistan signed a September peace deal with pro-Taliban militants in North Waziristan.

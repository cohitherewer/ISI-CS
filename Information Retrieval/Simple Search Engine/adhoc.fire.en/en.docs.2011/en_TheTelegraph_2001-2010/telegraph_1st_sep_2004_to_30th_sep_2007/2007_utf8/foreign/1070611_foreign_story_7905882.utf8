 Lanka apology

 Colombo, June 10 (PTI): The Sri Lankan government today apologised to the ethnic minority Tamils for evicting them from the capital and promised that there would be no repeat of the big mistake in future. 

 It was a big mistake, Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickremanayake said, referring to Thursdays expulsion of hundreds of Tamils at gunpoint. We accept responsibility. I express regret and apologise to the Tamil community on behalf of the government, he added.

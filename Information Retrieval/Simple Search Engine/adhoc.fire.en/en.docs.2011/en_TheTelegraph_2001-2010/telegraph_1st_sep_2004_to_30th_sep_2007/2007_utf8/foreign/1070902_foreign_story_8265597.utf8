 Venice, Sept. 1 (AP): US Senator Barack Obama has the aura of a rock star, according to George Clooney, who also had nice words for the other Democratic Party presidential candidates.

 Youve been in a room once in a while with a rock star. He walks into the world and he takes your breath away. Id love him to be President, quite honestly, Clooney told a group of international reporters at the Venice Film Festival, where the legal thriller Michael Clayton in which he stars premiered last night.

 Clooney, who banked a check for Obama at a private $1.3 million fundraiser in Beverly Hills, California, in February, praised the US senator from Illinois for displaying courage in 2003 by writing a piece saying how stupid going into that war was going to be.

 But with more than a year until the US presidential election, Clooney also said he liked New York Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and former Senator John Edwards and pondered whether former Vice-President Al Gore might jump in. It could be interesting, he said. If you look at the polls now, I think 70 per cent of our country is disenchanted with our country. We were better than what weve been doing in the last few years, Clooney said.

 New York, March 11: Not getting any online dates? Maybe its time for an online makeover.

 Businesses like Dating-Profile.com, ProfileHelper.com and E-Cyrano.com say they will help turn a stale personal profile for dating websites into eloquent and catchy advertisements, writing the words for you.

 They will even help clients sift through prospective dates and start an initial email conversation. Depending on the company and the services used, prices may range from $39 to $2,000.

 Other companies, like LookBetterOnline.com and SingleShots.com, sell professional photo shoots and retouching of existing pictures for people to post online.

 As online dating has gotten more popular, the more people have to do to get attention, said Mindy Stricke, owner of SingleShots.com, a New York business that has produced 1,000 profile portraits, at prices from $130 to $300. Theres a lot of anxiety around this purchase because theres no guarantees. But a lot of people, especially in New York, are willing to go the extra mile.

 Dating makeovers are hardly new. High-end offline dating services have long provided hairstyle and clothing renovations, as well as other help. But the latest twist underscores the frustration felt by some of the 40 million people using Internet matchmaking sites, said Mark Brooks, who follows the industry and author of the blog OnlinePersonalsWatch.com.

 The promise of Internet dating is you plug in your profile and you send a few emails and you have got a date, Brooks said. Its not as easy as that.

 Jim West, 43, a divorced engineer from Tatamy, Pennsylvania, struggled to get beyond the first Hello email when he started online dating. Sure, he got some dates, but with the wrong people, he said. So after six months, West paid $49 for a critique from Eric Resnick, owner of ProfileHelper.com, based in Orlando, Florida.

 I felt like he was my sixth-grade English teacher, West said. He taught me how to write a good essay. 

 Some of Resnicks advice: when sending email messages to women, he should ask them questions about their profiles so they are more inclined to reply. Resnick also told West his profile did not stand out because it used very general terms, with West describing himself as very laid back and happy. 

 Resnick said: Why say you are laid back when you can talk about the family barbecue that gives that air of laid back? Why say youre adventurous when you can talk about your trip to the Great Wall of China?

 Three months later, West met a woman whom he has now been dating for more than six months.

 China drug czar gets death

 Beijing, May 29 (Reuters): China sentenced the former head of its food and drugs agency to death for corruption today in a surprise judgment as the government sought to contain a wave of scandals over health safety.

 Zheng Xiaoyu, former head of the state food and drug administration, was convicted on charges of taking bribes and dereliction of duty, Xinhua news agency reported, citing the Beijing municipal no. 1 intermediate peoples court.

 The sentence, which was unusually harsh, could still be reduced on appeal. But it reflects the weight Chinas top leaders are giving to the issues of corruption and food safety as they grapple with the fallout overseas after a series of safety breaches involving toxins in food.

 Fossett, aircraft missing

 - Millionaire aviator vanishes in Nevada during scouting mission

 Tough old boot

 Minden (Nevada), Sept. 5 (AP): Rescuers aided by calm winds and clear skies were scanning a vast swathe of rugged terrain in California and Nevada today in their search for adventurer Steve Fossett, whose small plane has been missing for two days.

 The millionaire aviator did not file a flight plan for what was expected to be a short scouting mission to find a dry lake bed suitable for a future attempt to break the land speed record.

 His single-engine plane vanished on Monday over a section of Nevada east of Lake Tahoe and the California border that is marked by rugged mountains jutting to 3,048 meters, steep canyons and sagebrush-filled desert.

 Friends and relatives, meanwhile, were counting on his grit and experience to pull him through.

 Steve is a tough old boot. I suspect he is waiting by his plane right now for someone to pick him up, said Sir Richard Branson, the UK billionaire who has helped finance many of Fossetts adventures. Based on his track record, I feel confident well get some good news soon.

 Yesterdays search efforts were hampered by heavy gusts of up to 64 kmph and turbulence that prevented pilots from flying low or close to mountain peaks.

 But rescuers had high hopes early today because there was little wind to interfere with their aerial search efforts. Thats going to definitely help us put more aircraft in the air and hopefully make the search more successful, Gary Derks, operations officer for the Nevada Division of Emergency Management, said today.

 Three planes went up shortly after sunrise, including two that were searching an area near Bishop on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada in California. A helicopter also left from the airport in Minden that was serving as the base of the rescue effort.

 Other crews from the Nevada Air National Guard, Civil Air Patrol and Fallon Naval Air Station were scheduled to resume flights later , Derks said.

 Fossetts plane, a Bellanca Super Decathlon, carried a locator that sends a satellite signal after a rough landing, but no such signal had been received.

 An aerial search yesterday that included 14 aircraft conducted grid searches over 19,425 square km an area larger than that US state of Connecticut but intended to concentrate on 1,554 square km during todays search.

 Fossett, the first person to circle the world solo in a balloon, took off from an airstrip at hotel magnate William Barron Hiltons Flying M Ranch, about 113 km southeast of Reno. A friend reported him missing when he did not return. Derks said the airplane carried food, water and other survival gear.

 Civil Air Patrol Major Cynthia Ryan would not speculate about how many days someone might survive in the terrain, but she and longtime associates of the 63-year-old adventurer said he had proven survival skills. Hes a very savvy and methodical and determined pilot. Id give him the highest odds, she said.

 Fossett has an application pending before the US Bureau of Land Management for a permit in Eureka County to attempt to break the land-speed record of 1,234 km.

 In 2002, Fossett became the first person to fly around the world alone in a balloon. In two weeks, his balloon flew 31,265.85 km around the Southern Hemisphere. The record came after five previous attempts some of them spectacular and frightening failures.

 It is among dozens of firsts claimed by Fossett in his life as an adventurer, which he embarked on after earning a fortune as a financial trader.

 He set marks for speed or distance in balloons, airplanes, gliders, sailboats even cross-country skis and an airship, according to his web site. In March 2005, he became the first person to fly a plane solo around the world without refuelling. Fossett also has experience as an outdoorsman, climbing some of the worlds best-known peaks, including the Matterhorn in Switzerland and Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. 

 He also swam the English Channel in 1985, placed 47th in the Iditarod dog sled race in 1992, participated in the 24 Hours of Le Mans car race in 1996 and broke the round-the-world sailing record by six days in 2004.

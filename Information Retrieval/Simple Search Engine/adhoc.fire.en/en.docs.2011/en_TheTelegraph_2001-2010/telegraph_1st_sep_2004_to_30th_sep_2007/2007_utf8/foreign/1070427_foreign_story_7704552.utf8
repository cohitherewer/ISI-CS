 Horse in bank

 London, April 26: After having a few beers and finding himself a bit the worse for the wear, a German man spent the night sleeping in his local bank next to his horse, Sammy, reports The Daily telegraph. 

 The man, identified by German newspapers as a 40-year-old machinist called Wolfgang H., was discovered early the following morning by a bank customer, who called the police.

 Wolfgang reportedly said he felt cold while returning from a night of drinking with a friend and so, confronted with the absence of a hitching-post, decided to bring his 6-year-old horse in with him to sleep next to the cash machines in the local branch of the Mittelbrandenburgische Sparkasse in Wiesenburg, southwest of Berlin. 

 A spokesman for the bank said that, aside from an undesirable deposit made by the horse inside the building, Wolfgang had not breached any bank rules.

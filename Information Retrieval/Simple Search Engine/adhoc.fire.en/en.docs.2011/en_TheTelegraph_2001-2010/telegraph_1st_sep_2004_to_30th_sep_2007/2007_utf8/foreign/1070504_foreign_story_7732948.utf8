 Bikini banter

 Philadelphia, May 3 (AP): A TV newswoman emailed vacation pictures of herself in a bikini to the anchor of the National Football Leagues network, resulting in a flap that spilled over into the gossip columns.

 The pictures were meant to be good fun between old friends, not an attempt to break up sports anchor Rich Eisens four-year-old marriage, KYW-TV newswoman Alycia Lane told The Philadelphia Inquirer.

 The New York Post, which reported on the flap in a gossip column on Tuesday, said Eisens wife, ABC sports reporter Suzy Shuster got the emails in an account she shares with Eisen, and responded with a snarky letter to Lane.

 Boy, do you look amazing in a bikini ... congrats! Whatever youre doing, (Yoga?) keep doing it its working for you, Shuster wrote, according to The Post. Lane said she was mortified by the whole story, saying the photos were part of harmless banter between two old friends.

 (Reuters): By the time Spider-Man 3 opens in North America and Britain on Friday, the superhero will have already ensnared moviegoers around the world.

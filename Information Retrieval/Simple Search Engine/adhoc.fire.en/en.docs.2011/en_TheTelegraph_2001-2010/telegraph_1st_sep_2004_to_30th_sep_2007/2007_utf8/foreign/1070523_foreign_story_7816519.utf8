 Indian UN officials trial begins

 New York, May 22 (PTI): Opening the case against former UN official Sanjaya Bahel in a US court, a prosecutor painted him as a greedy and deceitful person who allegedly helped an Indian company get contracts worth $100 million in exchange for bribes. 

 Nishan Kohli, from whom Bahel is alleged to have received kickbacks, admitted to bribing him and agreed to testify against him. Bahel, a former India government official, used to work in the procurement division of the UN.

 Kohli is expected to admit renting a Manhattan apartment below market rent to Bahel and then selling it to him at much lesser price, besides giving him cash.

 Deputy US district attorney Cathy Seibel said in return for the kickbacks, Bahel provided Kohli advance information and suggestions to improve his bid to win contracts. The contracts were for the supply of materials and personnel to peacekeeping operations.

 If convicted, Bahel could get up to 10 years in prison.

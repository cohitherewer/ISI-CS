 UK police misled on shooting

 London, Aug. 2 (Reuters): Britains top counter-terrorism officer misled colleagues and the public about the fatal shooting of an innocent Brazilian who was mistaken for a suicide bomber, an independent police watchdog said today.

 Its report cleared the head of Londons police, Ian Blair, of lying and said senior officers had failed to tell him on the day of the shooting that an innocent man had been shot. I did not lie to the public, Blair said.

 Jean Charles De Menezes, 27, was shot in the head seven times by officers as he boarded an underground train in south London on July 22, 2005.

 Detectives had mistaken him for Hussein Osman, one of four men convicted last month of trying to set off bombs in the British capital the day before de Menezes was shot.

 Birthday EU hits hurdle

 Berlin, March 25 (Reuters): German Chancellor Angela Merkel pressed European Union leaders at a 50th anniversary summit today to reform the blocs creaking institutions by 2009, but met resistance from sceptical Polish and Czech presidents.

 At a solemn ceremony in Berlin, long a symbol of Europes Cold War division, Merkel told fellow leaders the EU needed to be put on a firmer basis to cope with enlargement. Failure would be a historic error, she said.

 Behind closed doors, Merkel urged them to begin negotiating a new treaty in June salvaging the substance of a stalled EU constitution, rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, with the aim of concluding in December.

 We know that we must always renew the political shape of Europe in keeping with the times, Merkel declared to applause. The internal structures must be adapted to an enlarged Union with 27 member states. 

 The six founder nations had signed the Treaty of Rome on March 25, 1957, creating the European Economic Community.

 Merkel called for a road map with political guidelines for a new treaty to be agreed in June.

 But Polish President Lech Kaczynski and Czech President Vaclav Klaus, central Europes most Euro-sceptical leaders, made clear they were in no such hurry. Kaczynski wants to reopen the reformed voting system at the heart of the constitution and he said ratifying a new treaty in 2009 was unachievable. Klaus called it just a dream.

 Merkel said she saw little prospect of reopening discussions on the voting system, which represented a hard-fought compromise between big and small states.

 She told a news conference she was convinced the sun-bathed celebration of the EUs achievements, which drew big crowds to central Berlin, had created the right mood to find a solution in June to Europes constitutional uncertainty. 

 The constitution would give the EU a long-term president and foreign minister, a simpler, more democratic decision-making system and more say for the European and national parliaments.

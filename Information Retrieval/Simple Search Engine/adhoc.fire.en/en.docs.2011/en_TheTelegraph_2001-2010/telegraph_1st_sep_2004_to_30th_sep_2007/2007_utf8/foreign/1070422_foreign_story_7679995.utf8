 Kili Faqiran (Pakistan), April 21 (AP): The boy with the knife looks barely 12. 

 In a high-pitched voice, he denounces the bound, blindfolded man before him as an American spy. Then he hacks off the captives head to cries of God is great! and hoists it in triumph by the hair.

 A video circulating in Pakistan records the grisly death of Ghulam Nabi, a Pakistani militant accused of betraying a top Taliban official who was killed in a December airstrike in Afghanistan.

 An AP reporter confirmed Nabis identity by visiting his family in Kili Faqiran, their remote village in southwestern Pakistan. The video, obtained by AP Television News in Peshawar, appears authentic and is unprecedented in jihadist propaganda because of the youth of the executioner.

 The footage shows Nabi making what is described as a confession, being blindfolded with a checkered scarf. He is an American spy. Those who do this kind of thing will get this kind of fate, says his baby-faced executioner, who is not identified.

 A continuous two-and-a-half-minute shot then shows the victim lying on his side on a patch of rubble-strewn ground. A man holds Nabi by his beard while the boy, wearing a camouflage military jacket and oversized white sneakers, cuts into the throat. Other men and boys call out Allah-u-Akbar! as blood spurts from the wound.

 The film, overlain with jihadi songs, then shows the boy hacking and slashing at the mans neck until the head is severed.

 J. HEMANTH 

 Kathmandu, Jan. 10: Nepals ruling Seven-Party alliance and the Maoist rebels today resolved their differences over the allocation of 48 seats in the interim legislature, paving the way for promulgation of the interim statute on January 15. 

 A meeting of the top leaders of the eight outfits met at Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koiralas official residence and decided to distribute the seats among all the parties. 

 Ten seats each will be allocated to the Nepali Congress, CPN (UML) and the Maoists. Six seats will go to the Nepali Congress (Democratic) and three seats each to the Janamorcha Nepal, Nepal Majdoor Kisan Party, United Left Front and the Nepal Sadbhawana Party (Anandidevi). 

 The meeting, which was attended by Koirala, Maoist chairman Prachanda, CPN (UML) general secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal and Nepali Congress (Democratic) president Sher Bahadur Deuba among others, also decided that all the parties would have to nominate members of the civil society to the seats allocated to them. 

 Madhav Kumar Nepal told reporters that the parties would have to submit the list of nominees for these seats to the Prime Minister by January 14. 

 He said the meeting also discussed the procedure for the promulgation of the interim constitution and formation of an interim legislature as well as measures needed to speed up the process of arms monitoring. 

 The Maoists, who will have 73 seats in the 330-member interim parliament, are yet to announce the names of their representatives. The Maoists and the ruling alliance had earlier agreed to announce the interim constitution and legislature on January 15.

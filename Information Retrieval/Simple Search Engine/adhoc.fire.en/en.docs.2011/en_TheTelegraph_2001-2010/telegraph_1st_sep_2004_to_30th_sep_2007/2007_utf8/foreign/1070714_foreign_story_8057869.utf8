 Blairs woes

 London, July 13: Tony Blair joked about his difficulty in coming to terms with life after Downing Street as he raised funds for the Labour Party last night.

 Speaking to an audience at Wembley Stadium, Blair revealed that following a decade in office he needed to be taught how to use a mobile phone.

 When the former Prime Minister finally managed to fire off a text message, he was somewhat bemused to receive one back that said: Who are you?

 Losing the trappings of power have also affected Blairs travelling habits. He confessed to becoming confused every time his driver stopped at a red light.

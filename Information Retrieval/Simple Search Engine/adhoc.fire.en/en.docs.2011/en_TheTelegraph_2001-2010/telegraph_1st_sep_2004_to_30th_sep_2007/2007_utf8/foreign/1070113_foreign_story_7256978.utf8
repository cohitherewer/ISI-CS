 US term for withdrawal

 Washington, Jan. 12 (Reuters): The US could start withdrawing forces from Iraq this year if the additional troops being sent to Baghdad reduce violence significantly, US defence secretary Robert Gates said today.

 If these operations actually work you could begin to see a lightening of the US footprint both in Baghdad and Iraq itself, Gates told the Senate Armed Services Committee.

 Defending President George W. Bushs plan for the war, Gates cautioned that adding more US forces would not end sectarian violence in Iraq.

 But if it lowers the violence significantly and the Iraqi government fulfils its promises, then you could have a situation later this year where you could actually begin withdrawing.

 Still, lawmakers challenged the plan to send an extra 21,000 soldiers into the most violent areas of Iraq. They said it depended far too heavily on the Iraqi government keeping promises it had failed to keep.

 Look at the track record of the Iraqi government in meeting some of its past benchmarks and promises, said Senator Carl Levin.

 He listed commitments that were not kept, such as a pledge from Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki that the government would disband the sectarian militias plaguing Baghdad and that Iraq would take over security for all its provinces by the end of 2006.

 Gates admitted Iraqs poor performance in meeting its goals. But he said he thought they were serious now.

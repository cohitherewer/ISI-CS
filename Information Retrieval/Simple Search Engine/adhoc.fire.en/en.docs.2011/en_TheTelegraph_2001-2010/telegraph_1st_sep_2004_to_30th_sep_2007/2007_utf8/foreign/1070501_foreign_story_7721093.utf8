 Colombo, April 30 (Agencies): Aerial attacks by Tamil Tigers have begun to tell on Sri Lankas flight schedules.

 Two international airlines have announced indefinite suspension of flights to Sri Lanka while another is reviewing its operations to the island nation.

 Hong Kongs Cathay Pacific and Dubais Emirates said they were indefinitely suspending their flights to Sri Lanka because of threats of more Tiger air raids.

 The Tigers threatened today to carry out more air strikes on military installations following weekend attacks on two fuel facilities near the capital.

 The government has not given up its military agenda, rebel spokesman Rasiah Ilanthirayan said by telephone from the rebels northern stronghold of Kilinochchi, adding that they had no choice but to strike back with their new air wing. 

 Singapore Airlines said it was also reviewing operations to Sri Lanka and, for the time being, had decided to suspend all night flights to Bandaranaike International Airport here.

 As a security precaution, with regard to the circumstances in Colombo, we have rescheduled our flight departure and arrival times, a Singapore Airlines official said. It will be a daytime flight instead of a night flight.

 Following a review of the situation in the Sri Lankan capital, Emirates flights to the city remain suspended until further notice, the airline said in a statement here.

 International airlines were seeking more clarifications from local authorities with several other airlines, too, reviewing their operations.

 Safety is a top priority at Cathay Pacific and a careful assessment of the situation will be made before services are resumed, Cathay Pacific said in statement issued in Hong Kong.

 Flights to the airport, located just outside the capital, were diverted after rebel aircraft were spotted in its airspace early yesterday.

 Flights were disrupted by air defence systems, officials said, adding that an Indian jet was turned back and several departing flights were delayed. 

 Royal Dutch Shells local arm said it had temporarily closed its main storage facility 20 km north of Colombo after yesterdays raid damaged its fire fighting system. 

 The Anglo-Dutch oil major said its storage tanks were intact and that supplies had not been disrupted. One of the bombed sites is run jointly by the Sri Lankan government and the Indian Oil Corporation. 

 Tiger media coordinator Daya Master said their fire had hit an air force jet during a government air raid in the north today, and that residents had seen the craft spewing smoke. The air force dismissed the report as propaganda.

 Sri Lankan shares fell while the local rupee hit a new intra-day low against the dollar as yesterdays raid, the rebels third in a month, sent jitters through the markets.

 Islamabad, June 5: The police in the Pakistan capital have filed preliminary complaints against journalists for holding a protest rally in front of the Prime Ministers secretariat against the governments new curbs on the electronic media. 

 More than 300 people, mainly journalists, lawyers and Opposition activists, took to the streets last night to protest against President Pervez Musharrafs draconian measures against the electronic media. 

 They broke through the security cordon and reached the Prime Ministers Secretariat where senior journalists, including Shamim-ur-Rehman, Mazhar Abbas, Mushtaq Minhas and Afzal Butt, warned the government of serious consequences for trying to clamp down on journalists. 

 Facing one of the worst crisis of his eight-year military rule, Musharraf yesterday tightened the regulation on the electronic media in an apparent bid to stop the fallout from the suspension of Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry on March 9. 

 Under an emergency ordinance that became effective immediately, Musharraf made a raft of amendments to regulations governing the electronic media, including private television channels.

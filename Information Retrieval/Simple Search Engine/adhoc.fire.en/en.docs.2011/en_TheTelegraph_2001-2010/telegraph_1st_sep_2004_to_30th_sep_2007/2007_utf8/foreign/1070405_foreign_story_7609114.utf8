 Dhaka, April 4 (PTI): The caretaker Bangladesh government has decided to correct the distortion of history in relation to the 1971 Liberation War and the role of the independence leaders in school textbooks. 

 We have identified the distortions of history in textbooks from Class I to Class 12 as directed by the government, education ministry joint secretary Nazrul Islam said. 

 His comments come a day after education adviser Ayub Kadri said that the government planned massive reforms to streamline the education sector.

 Islam, however, said the government would have to wait until January next year to correct the history, social science and Bangla textbooks when the new academic year starts. 

 Education ministry officials said the changes in textbooks were made after former Prime Minister Khaleda Zias Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-led government assumed power in 2001 with an attempt to highlight the role of slain President and BNP founder Zia-ur Rahman above everybody else. 

 They said under the amendments, the role of Bangla-speaking collaborators of the Pakistani occupation forces in 1971 was discarded while Bangladeshs founding father Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was largely ignored.

 The civil society groups and several Left-leaning and moderate political parties including former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas Awami League have been protesting the distortion of history in school textbooks .

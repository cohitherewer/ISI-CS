 Fairbanks, Alaska (AP): The debut of Into the Wild, a movie directed by Sean Penn about a 24-year-old young man who starved to death in the Alaskan wilderness, drew a packed house at a venue outside Fairbanks. More than 100 people attended the premiere on Monday night at the Blue Loon, a bar, theatre and dance hall. Many wanted to see if their contributions made the credits for the movie that includes a handful of Alaska locations. Actor Emile Hirsch plays Christopher McCandless, a man from a well-off family in the Washington, DC, area.

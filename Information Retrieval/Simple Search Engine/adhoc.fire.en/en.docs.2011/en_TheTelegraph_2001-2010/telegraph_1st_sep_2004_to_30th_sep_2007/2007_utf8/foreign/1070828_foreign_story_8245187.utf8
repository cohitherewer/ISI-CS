 Brangelina on rushed tour of New York

 Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie with their children, Maddox and Zahara

 New York, Aug. 27 (AP): Hot dogs from a Times Square street vendor?

 Helicopter to a Hurricane Katrina benefit in the Hamptons? All part of Brangelinas whirlwind New York weekend.

 Megastars Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were spotted on Friday with kids Maddox, Zahara and Pax shopping at Lees Art Shop in midtown Manhattan. Baby Shiloh was not there.

 According to the New York Post, the family then headed towards Times Square, where Pitt ordered five hot dogs from a street vendor, three with ketchup and mustard, two with just ketchup. I didnt know who he was, said vendor Mahmoud Omer, who added that Pitt wanted relish but he did not have any.

 The Mr. and Mrs. Smith stars enjoyed a culinary upgrade on Saturday when they attended a fundraiser at the home of Tribeca Film Festival co-founders Jane Rosenthal and Craig Hatkoff in Watermill, New York. The Daily News reported that Pitt and Jolie left the kids with nannies and flew by helicopter to the Hamptons for the event. 

 They were joined by model Christie Brinkley, actress Ellen Barkin and beach balladeer Jimmy Buffett. 

 The dinner was a benefit for Pitts Make it Right project, which is focused on rebuilding New Orleans Ninth Ward with environmentally- friendly homes.

 Suni return delayed by a day

 Cape Canaveral (Florida), June 21 (Reuters): Bad weather forced Nasa today to delay bringing flight engineer Sunita Suni Williams back to Earth at least until tomorrow, US space agency Nasa said.

 Touchdown at the Kennedy Space Center in central Florida had been targeted for two opportunities this afternoon, but thick cloud cover and rain showers prompted Nasa managers to call off both possible landing attempts.

 Flight directors decided not to staff the shuttles backup landing site at Edwards Air Force Base in California today, but both sites will be available for tomorrows landing opportunities. Tomorrows first opportunity will be at Kennedy Space Center at 1818 GMT, Nasa managers said.

 Weather could still hamper the shuttles return home after its nearly two-week-long mission at the International Space Station. Were going to be fighting the same challenges at KSC (Kennedy Space Center), and at Edwards the winds are going to pick up, astronaut Tony Antonelli at mission control in Houston told his colleagues aboard the shuttle.

 The shuttle has enough fuel and supplies to stay in space until Sunday, but it cannot land in rain because it could damage the thousands of ceramic tiles that protect the spaceships belly from the fiery heat of re-entry.

 During their visit to the space station, Atlantis crew members installed a 17-tonne metal truss that included solar power panels to generate additional electricity for the half-finished $100 billion complex.

 Nasa managers cleared Atlantis for todays landing opportunities after two inspections during flight and high-resolution photos taken by the space station crew found no damage to the orbiters heat shield. Heat shield problems are a major concern at Nasa since the shuttle Columbia broke up while returning to Earth in 2003, killing the seven astronauts on board. 

 Haircut plans

 Williams said a haircut was one of many things she was looking forward to when she returns to Earth on the shuttle after more than six months at the station.

 Im looking forward to going to the beach and hopefully taking a walk with my husband and my dog on the beach, she said. I cant wait for a good piece of pizza.

 Gores son in drug net

 Problems at home

 Los

 Angeles, July 4 (Reuters): The 24-year-old son of former US Vice-President Al Gore was arrested for drug possession today after he was stopped for allegedly speeding in his hybrid Toyota Prius, a sheriffs official said.

 Al Gore III whose father is a leading advocate of policies to fight global warming was driving his environmentally friendly car at about 100 miles (160 km) per hour on a freeway south of Los Angeles when he was pulled over by an Orange County sheriffs deputy at about 2.15 am.

 A subsequent search yielded a small amount of marijuana, along with prescription drugs including Valium, Xanax, Vicodin and Adderall, said sheriffs spokesman Jim Amormino. There were no prescriptions found, he said.

 Gore was arrested on suspicion of drug possession and booked into the Inmate Reception Center in Santa Ana, about 55 km south of Los Angeles, on $20,000 bail, he said.

 It was not Gores first brush with the law. He was arrested in 2003 for marijuana possession and in 2002 for suspected drunken-driving.

 Gore was still in custody as of mid-morning and was sharing a holding cell with an unknown number of people, said Orange County sheriffs spokesperson Jim Amormino.

 There are no special privileges, he said.

 Gore cooperated with law enforcement as soon he was pulled over and quickly identified himself as the son of the former Vice-President, Amormino said.

 A spokesperson for the elder Gore said he was travelling and could not immediately be reached for comment.

 Washington, July 11 (AP): President George W. Bush reaffirmed his confidence yesterday in Pakistans President as a strong ally in the war against extremists.

 I like him and I appreciate him, Bush said in Cleveland. The President also called President Pervez Musharraf a partner in promoting democracy.

 Bushs remarks followed an expression of approval by the state department of Pakistans decision to storm a mosque in Islamabad where militants were holding hostages. Deputy spokesman Tom Casey said the militants had been given many warnings before the commandos moved on the sprawling Red Mosque compound before dawn.

 The government of Pakistan has proceeded in a responsible way, Casey said. All governments have a responsibility to preserve order.

 The White House reaction was subdued. Deputy press secretary Scott Stanzel said it was an internal matter for the Pakistani government to address. 

 What remains clear is, in places throughout the world the threat of extremists is real, but that operation is a matter for the Pakistani government, Stanzel said.

 A few hours later, Bush gave his unqualified support to Musharraf as a strong ally in the war against these extremists.

 I am, of course, constantly working with him to make sure that democracy continues to advance in Pakistan, Bush said.

 Strong

 ally 

 The incident coincided with a report issued by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace that called for the end of the armys quasi monopoly on every lever of power in the country.

 The author, Frederic Grare, a visiting scholar at the private think tank, proposed eliminating the armys interference not only in the politics and economics of Pakistan, but also in the countrys judiciary and administration.

 In the report, he said that of about $10 billion in US assistance to Pakistan since the September 11 terror attacks on the US only $900 million had gone to development with the bulk of the assistance channelled through the military.

 Kim gravely ill

 SERGEI SOUKHORUKOV

 Surgery needed

 Beijing, June 11: Kim Jong Il, North Koreas reclusive leader, has been so unwell that he could not walk more than 30 yards without a rest, western governments have been told.

 Diplomats in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, are increasingly convinced that the 65-year-old dictator needs heart surgery to restore his apparently flagging health. He has had to be accompanied by an assistant carrying a chair so that, wherever he goes, he can sit and catch his breath.

 Speculation about the state of Kims health was heightened when a team of six doctors from the German Heart Institute in Berlin flew to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, for eight days last month. 

 Kim, who also suffers from diabetes, was believed by diplomats to have been among those on the list for treatment by the combined medical and surgical team. But a spokesman for the German team said they had only treated three labourers, a nurse and a scientist.

 Kims public appearances have been curtailed this year and he has appeared in public only 23 times, compared with 42 times at the same point last year - an indication, observers say, of his declining health. The suggestion that he underwent an operation offered an apparent explanation for his recent month-long disappearance from public view.

 Kim Jong Il has ruled the North one of the most isolated and tightly controlled regimes in the world since his father, the countrys founder, Kim Il Sung, died in 1994. He became the heir apparent to his father in 1974.

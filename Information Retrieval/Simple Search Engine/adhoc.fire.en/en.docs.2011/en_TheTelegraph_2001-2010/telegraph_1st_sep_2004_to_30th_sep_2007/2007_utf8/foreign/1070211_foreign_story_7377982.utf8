 Cate eager for baddie roles

 Berlin, Feb. 10 (Reuters): Playing a Nazi collaborator in Steven Soderberghs post-war noir thriller The Good German has whetted Oscar-winner Cate Blanchetts appetite for more villainous roles.

 I got my taste of playing a bit of a baddie in The Good German, the Australian actress said. Now Id like to play an out and out villain.

 Blanchett, 37, plays the tragic character Lena Brandt opposite George Clooney and Tobey Maguire in Soderberghs black-and-white film of betrayal in bombed-out 1945 Berlin.

 Her character helps the Nazis during the war to avoid deportation, then is forced into prostitution to survive once the fighting ends and the victorious Russians and Americans take control of the German capital.

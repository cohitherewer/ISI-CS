 Sharif return

 Washington, Aug. 28 (Reuters): Exiled former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said he hopes to be back in Pakistan by mid-September, despite the risk of arrest upon returning to his homeland.

 Sharif, who was ousted in a 1999 coup in which then army chief General Pervez Musharraf seized power, said in a PBS interview taped in London over the weekend that leaders of his party recommended he return as early as possible.

 They say that I should return before the beginning of month of Ramazan.... I think its about maybe two or three weeks away, he said in the interview aired yesterday. Pakistans supreme court ruled last week that Sharif, a two-time Prime Minister, should be allowed to return.

 Sharif, who has vowed to oppose a bid by Musharraf for another term in office as President, said he does not fear the possibility that he could be arrested when he goes back to Pakistan. I am simply going back to my country, my homeland, after seven years absence. I think I have every right to go back.

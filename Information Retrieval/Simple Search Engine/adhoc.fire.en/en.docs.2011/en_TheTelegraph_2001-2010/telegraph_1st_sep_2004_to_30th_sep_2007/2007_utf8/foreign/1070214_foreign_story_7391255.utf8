The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Target: model bodies

 London, Feb. 13 (Reuters): London Fashion Week opened for the first full day of shows today but attention remained more on the body shape of the models than the clothes they were wearing.

 As fashionistas and celebrities poured into the city for one of the most hyped London fashion weeks in years, organisers found themselves defending their decision not to ban super skinny women from the catwalks.

 We feel strongly that banning is not the right course to take. Its very discriminatory. You cant tell by looking at a model and you cant tell by weighing a model whether she is suffering from an eating disorder, Hilary Riva, chief executive of the British Fashion Council, said.

 Responding to calls for regulation, the council, which organises London Fashion Week, has issued guidelines to designers for the autumn/winter shows urging them to use only healthy models to show their collections.

 Eating disorder campaigners for the first time were also patrolling backstage at some shows, distributing leaflets and a helpline number to models. One restaurant popular with the fashion crowd said it was offering free food to models to encourage them to eat more.

 But unlike their counterparts in Milan and Madrid, the London organisers stopped short of an outright ban on skinny models, who critics say encourage eating disorders.

 Peter Ingwersen, the Danish founder of fashion label Noir who showed a masculine collection yesterday, full of neat, tailored pieces, said a ban was not the way forward.

 Its not enough just to say ban, ban, ban, because any law will never change that. Its always been there and itll always be there. The only way forward is education, he said.

 Noirs fitted shirts, belted trenchcoats and flowing evening gowns went down the catwalk on the backs of two of Britains best known models, Lily Cole and Erin Connor both the subject of British media speculation about their body size. Voluminous gowns were also the theme at yesterdays show by Dane Peter Jensen and Duro Olowu.

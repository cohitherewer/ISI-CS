 Lohan bust last call for young stars

 Los Angeles, May 30: Authorities are trying to crack down on one of the worst-kept secrets in Hollywood: underage stars partying hard at trendy clubs on the Sunset Strip and Hollywood Boulevard.

 Doormen at Hollywood hot spots have been lifting the velvet rope for teen stars for years. Two decades ago, Drew Barrymore became tabloid fodder after being spotted drinking at Hollywood clubs when she was 13 and 14. 

 These days, theres no hiding the illicit behaviour, thanks to the aggressive tactics of Hollywoods ever-expanding paparazzi corps, who document celebrities through every nightclub-hopping step.

 Thats what happened over the weekend to actress Lindsay Lohan. The 20-year-old was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence after crashing her Mercedes convertible in Beverly Hills early Saturday, culminating a night of partying on the Sunset Strip. On Monday, Lohans publicist Leslie Sloane Zelnick said the wildchild actress had checked into a rehab centre.

 A wave of publicity about underage drinking among celebrities has prompted the California Alcohol Beverage Control Board to step up undercover activities at several top nightspots. The ABC is seeking a 15-day closure order for Mood, a trendy Hollywood Boulevard club that was the subject of an undercover investigation. 

 Paparazzi photos made last year show Lohan, actors Mary-Kate Olsen and Frankie Muniz and Jesse McCartney, all underage at the time, partying there. (Lohan did not go to Mood on the night of her accident.) One photo posted on various celebrity websites showed McCartney, then 18, drinking at Mood. 

 But ABC officials said it takes more than a copy of Us Weekly to prove wrongdoing. 

 We cant prove whats in the glass or where they were, said John Carr, a spokesman for the agency. We need a witness on the ground.

 The case against Mood is considered an important test. Some clubs seem willing to risk being caught serving underage stars if it will bring A-list talent and A-list publicity to their establishments, said LA city councilman Eric Garcetti, whose district includes part of Hollywood Boulevard.

 To make a club profitable, they have to be celebrity-driven, Garcetti said. People are willing to bend over backward to please celebrities. But you cant bend so backward that you break the law. Even some paparazzi wonder why authorities arent doing more.

 Im not being sanctimonious here, but the crazy thing about whats happening now is nobody is stopping them, said Gary Morgan, chief executive of Splash News, saying his photographers have been chronicling underage drinking for years. The clubs love the attention, but if this was any other underage kid, the police would have swooped in on the club arrested the owner or the barman.

 The celebrity website http://www.TMZ.com last year posted photos of McCartney and other underage stars at Mood, and Harvey Levin, the sites managing editor, said he questions why authorities arent more closely monitoring what goes on at such night spots.

 Theres no way they didnt know what was going on at those clubs, he said. Everybody saw it. It was all over TV. There was a lot of conduct that crossed the legal line in this town. The difference today is everybodys watching.

 Carr said state officials are aware of the images of baby-faced celebrities carousing. But he defends the ABC agencys efforts, saying it has four agents to monitor 2,870 liquor licences in the Los Angeles area.

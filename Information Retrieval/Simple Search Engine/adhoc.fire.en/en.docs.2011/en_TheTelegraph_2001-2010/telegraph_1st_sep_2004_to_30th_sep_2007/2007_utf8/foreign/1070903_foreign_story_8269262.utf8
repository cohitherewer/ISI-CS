 Wing champ

 Buffalo, New York, Sept. 2 (AP): A 48kg competitive eater who goes by the title The Black Widow bested a dozen beefy rivals last night, scarfing 173 wings in 12 minutes to win the wing-eating contest at the National Buffalo Wing Festival.

 Sonya Thomas, originally from South Korea, had 2.35kg of wings at the annual event in the city where Buffalo wings were born. It was 12 huge guys and her, a spokesperson for the event said.

 Castle bid

 Casco, Maine (AP): The 

 creator of a sand castle built nearly 32 feet tall to raise 

 funds for terminally ill children hopes the structure will 

 be named the worlds tallest. The elaborate sand castle 

 measured a height of 31 feet, 7 inches (about 9.6m). The 

 Guinness World Records will determine whether it 

 makes the record book.

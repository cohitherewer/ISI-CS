 Shuttle return

 Houston, Aug. 18 (Reuters): Nasa kept a close eye on Hurricane Dean as it churned through the Caribbean Sea today and said it may cut short space shuttle Endeavours flight if the storm threatens Mission Control in Houston.

 The US space agency said it would shorten a planned six-hour spacewalk and look for other ways to get ready for a Tuesday landing instead of the currently scheduled on Wednesday. Wed really like to protect an option to be able to end the mission on Tuesday, mission management team chairman Leroy Cain said.

 Bringing Endeavour back early could enable Nasa to complete the flight before Mission Control, located at Johnson Space Center in Houston, would have to be evacuated.

 The shuttle is scheduled to land at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, which is not forecast to be affected by the storm. If necessary, Nasa officials said, Mission Controls functions could be moved to Kennedy. Cain did not say when Nasa would make a final decision on Endeavours schedule, but flight communicator Shane Kimbrough a plan for an early landing was in the works.

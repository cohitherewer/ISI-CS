 Monkey in the hat

 New York, Aug. 8 (AP): A man smuggled a monkey onto an airplane, stashing the fist-size primate under his hat until passengers spotted it perched on his ponytail, an airline official in New York said.

 On a flight from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to New Yorks LaGuardia airport, passengers around the man noticed that a marmoset which normally lives in a forest and eats fruit and insects had emerged from underneath his hat, Spirit Airlines spokeswoman Alison Russell said. The mans journey had begun in Lima, Peru.

 Other passengers asked the man if he knew he had a monkey on him, Russell said. The monkey spent the remainder of the flight on the mans seat and behaved well, said Russell. She did not know how the monkey escaped detection in Lima and during the mans several-hour stopover in Fort Lauderdale.

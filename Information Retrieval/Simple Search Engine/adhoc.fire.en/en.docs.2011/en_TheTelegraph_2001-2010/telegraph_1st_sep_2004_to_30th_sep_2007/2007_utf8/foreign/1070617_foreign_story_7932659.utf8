 Hasina denies extortions

 Dhaka, June 16 (Reuters): Bangladeshs former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, barred from going abroad because she faces charges of extortion, was quoted as saying today that she never took money from anyone for herself, although her party accepted donations.

 I have never extorted any money from anybody, but of course some people give donations to the Awami League, an Awami leader who asked not to be identified quoted Hasina as telling senior party leaders.

 In Bangladesh parties are funded through donations, Hasina reportedly said, replying to critics who want corrupt politicians including herself purged as part of reforming political parties. Hasina had planned to leave Dhaka last night for the US to see her son and daughter.

 But a court on Thursday ordered immigration officials and police not to allow her to go, saying her presence in the country was needed for investigation of extortion charges against her. Hasina cancelled the trip only hours before the scheduled departure time.

 Miami, Jan. 14: It was a simple message, posted on the Internet by what seemed to be just another well-wisher who had followed the agonising hunt for the missing schoolboy Shawn Hornbeck. 

 How long are you planing (sic) to look for your son? it inquired of the boys parents, signing off as Shawn Devlin of Kirkwood, Missouri. 

 Only yesterday, as Shawn, 15, was reunited with his family after an extraordinary kidnap ordeal that lasted for four years, did it emerge that the message, left on the familys website in December 2005, may have been a cryptic cry for help from the boy himself. He was using the surname of his captor, Michael Devlin, who forced the boy to call him Dad. 

 The pizza parlour manager was in custody yesterday, charged with kidnap, after Shawn and a second boy who was snatched off the streets last week were found at his home, in Kirkwood. 

 Its just mind-boggling that it was that easy to hide someone in plain sight, said Shawns stepfather, Craig Akers. 

 Both boys appeared well, but psychologists speculated that Shawn who disappeared while riding his bicycle to a friends house in 2002, when he was 11 may have developed Stockholm Syndrome, a condition in which hostages fall under the spell of their captors. 

 He had passed up numerous opportunities to make his getaway, it emerged, including being allowed out to ride his bicycle in the street outside Devlins apartment, and trips to the shops. 

 He told neighbours that Devlin was his father and, when they asked about his mothers whereabouts, became emotional and told them that she had died in a car crash. 

 Shawn was found after police went to the address on Friday night looking for a second local boy, Ben Ownby, 13, who was snatched on his way home from school on Monday. 

 An FBI spokesman said: When our agents entered the apartment, young Ben looked up and said, Are you going to take me home? The other boy said Im Shawn Hornbeck. After that, it was quite euphoric.

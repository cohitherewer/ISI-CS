 Finally, Ethiopia enters 2000

 Addis Ababa, Sept. 12 (Reuters): Seven years after the rest of the world, Ethiopia entered the 21st century today with parties, prayers and gestures of political reconciliation.

 Tens of thousands of revellers packed the capital Addis Ababas main square for festivities overnight that Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said should mark the vast Horn of Africa nations renaissance.

 Ethiopia follows a calendar long abandoned by the West, that squeezes 13 months into every year. Meles said the occasion heralded a glorious new page in the history of a country that, from the 1980s, became for many in the outside world a byword for hunger and conflict.

 A thousand years from now, when Ethiopians gather to welcome the fourth millennium, they shall say the eve of the third millennium was the beginning of the end of the dark ages in Ethiopia, he said. They shall say that the eve of the third millennium was the beginning of the Ethiopian renaissance. 

 Whistles, car horns and sirens shook the air at midnight. Then, as dawn melted the mist shrouding the highland city, worshippers wrapped in traditional white robes flocked to church, crossing paths with partygoers returning from a once-in-a-lifetime celebration.

 Ive come for Gods blessing, said Michele Fantaye, smearing ash on his forehead.

 I hope the next 1,000 years will deliver peace and unity.

 Banging drums, Orthodox Christian priests sang of the importance of the occasion in Ethiopias ancient Geez language in churches choked with incense.

 After the discovery of the 3-million-year-old Lucy skeleton, Ethiopias 81 million people proudly claim their nation was the cradle of humanity, as well as the birthplace of coffee, and the only African nation not to be colonised.

 But the darkness of poverty and backwardness had dimmed Ethiopias proud reputation, Meles said. We cannot but feel deeply insulted that at the dawn of the new Millennium ours is one of the poorest countries in the world, he said.

 He was speaking at a new exhibition hall where US hip hop act Black Eyed Peas performed for dignitaries, including regional leaders, and the capitals elite. Many stayed away from the official event, regarded by critics as a government project. They preferred to party for free in a sports ground rather than pay $170 two months wage for many.

 Some in Addis Ababa, an Opposition stronghold, were angry at the governments campaign to clear the streets of thousands of beggars, and at the spiralling cost of food for the Millennium. I dont think much will change, said one local, Belai Kassa. 

 Most Ethiopians spent a rainy New Years day with their families. Sweeping away ashes of bonfires lit the night before, many held a days fasting to be broken on Thursday by a meal of njera, spongy Ethiopian bread, and roasted goat.

 Wilde out of Vatican closet

 RICHARD OWEN

 Oscar Wilde: Icon

 London, Jan. 5: Oscar Wilde, poet, playwright, gay icon and deathbed convert to Catholicism, has been paid a rare tribute by the Vatican. His aphorisms are quoted in a collection of maxims and witticisms for Christians that has been published by one of the Popes closest aides.

 Wilde (1854-1900) had long been regarded with distaste by the Vatican a dissolute and disgraced homosexual who was sentenced for acts of gross indecency over his relationship with Lord Alfred Douglas. 

 The book, compiled by Father Leonardo Sapienza, head of protocol at the Vatican, includes such Wildean gems as I can resist everything except temptation and The only way to get rid of a temptation is yield to it hardly orthodox Catholic teaching.

 Father Sapienza said that he had devoted the lions share of Provocations: Aphorisms for an Anti-conformist Christianity to Wilde because he was a writer who lived perilously and somewhat scandalously but who has left us some razor-sharp maxims with a moral. The book also includes contributions from the Colombian philosopher Nicolas Gomez Davila.

 Father Sapienza said Wilde had been a great writer of powerful force and dazzling intelligence who was now chiefly remembered not for his promiscuity but for plays such as The Importance of Being Earnest and An Ideal Husband as well as moral tales such as The Picture of Dorian Gray. 

 He said his aim was to stimulate a reawakening in certain Catholic circles. Christianity was intended to be a radical cure, not a humdrum remedy for curing the common cold. Our role is to be a thorn in the flesh, to move peoples consciences and to tackle what today is the No. 1 enemy of religion indifference. 

 What a surprise! La Repubblica said. A homosexual icon has been accepted by the Vatican. Orazio La Rocca, a veteran Vatican watcher, said the book was a bombshell. 

 Pope Benedict XVI is a stern opponent of gay marriage and has reinforced Catholic teaching that homosexuality is a disorder. On the other hand, he has belied his reputation as a hardliner since his election, reserving most of his fire for apathy and relativism in a bid to revive Christian faith in Europe.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Heathrow protest barred

 London, Aug. 6 (Reuters): Airports operator BAA won a court injunction today barring environmental activists from disrupting Heathrow airport next week.

 BAA, owned by Spanish construction and services group Ferrovial, went to the high court in London to restrict the actions of campaigners attending a Climate Action camp near the airport between August 14 and 21.

 The judge, Justice Caroline Swift, said her decision would allow peaceful and lawful protests but barred a named group of individuals from taking disruptive action. She said it was nothing like as wide-ranging as originally sought by BAA.

 Maoists plan protests

 J HEMANTH 

 Kathmandu, Aug. 20: The Maoists plan to put pressure on the ruling coalition government over declaring Nepal a republic through a parliamentary resolution before Novembers Constituent Assembly elections. 

 Maoist number two and ideologue Baburam Bhattarai said the situation in Nepal was not conducive to holding elections on November 22. 

 Elections under the prevailing circumstances will be a hypocrisy, he said. Bhattarai added party workers have been instructed to launch protests all over the country in a phased manner from next month. 

 He said the agitation would continue till the government accepts their demands put forth by the party during the last coalition meeting. 

 Our agitation in effect will be a peoples movement within the government, in the parliament and on the streets, he said. Bhattarai, who also happens to be the coordinator of the Maoist Joint Revolutionary Peoples Council, appealed to all parties, professional organisations, civil society, media and the general public to support the maoist campaign. 

 Bhattarai said that his party would prepare for the mass campaign by mobilising its workers during the first phase which will last till September 17. 

 It would be followed by mass assemblies, peoples action and political strikes beginning from September 18. 

 The Maoist leader said the immediate declaration of a republic through the interim parliament is one of the pre-conditions for the elections as royalist forces are conspiring to thwart the elections by instigating violence in the Terai. 

 Bhattarai also demanded the removal of all army personnel stationed inside the Narayanhitti palace. He said ordinary security was good enough for King Gyanendra and his family members.

 The property of late King Birendra and his family and the property King Gyanendra inherited by virtue of being the monarch should be nationalised immediately. 

 The other Maoist demands include democratisation of the Nepali Army and merger of the Maoist Peoples Liberation Army into the army.

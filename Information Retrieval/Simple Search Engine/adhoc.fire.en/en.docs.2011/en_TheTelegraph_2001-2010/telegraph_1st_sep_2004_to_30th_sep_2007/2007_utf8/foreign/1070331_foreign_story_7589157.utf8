 Sunita to run Boston marathon in space

 Boston, March 30 (AP): Zooming through low-Earth orbit at 17,500 mph, Sunita Williams completes the standard marathon distance every 5.4 seconds.

 But for next months Boston Marathon, the US navy commander will run the equivalent distance on a treadmill 338 km above Earth in the international space station, and tethered to her track by bungee cords so she does not float away.

 She thought it would be cool if she gave it a try, said Williamss sister, Dina Pandya, who will run the race the traditional way with almost 24,000 other runners. She said: Ill call you on Heartbreak Hill.

 Although the worlds oldest annual marathon starts at 1400 GMT on Earth, Williams might not be able to run at that time because her sleep schedule a fairly arbitrary matter in space is set for the arrival of a Soyuz mission.

 Im not sure the timing will be that shell be awake, Pandya said. Theyre going to be on Russian time, so theyre kind of sleep-shifting.

 Williams, 41, qualified for the Boston race by finishing last Januarys Houston Marathon in 3 hours, 29 minutes, 57 seconds. On December 9, Williams took off on the space shuttle Discovery and it became clear she was not going to make it to the starting line.

 I considered it a huge honour to qualify, and I didnt want my qualification to expire without giving it a shot, Williams told the Boston Athletic Association, which organises the race.

 The BAA offered to send an official entrants bib and a special finishers medal made without lead, as per Nasa orders to the space station. But when this months launch of the shuttle Atlantis was postponed, Williams had to be emailed a bib that she can print out; the other souvenirs will have to wait.

 Race organisers have cooperated with far-flung endeavours like the Boston Marathon in Iraq, sending extensive packages of trophies, water bottles and even a finish line tape to West Asia for three years running. A similar shipment is headed for Kosovo this year.

 But this is the first race they have ever had on a satellite.

 The Boston Marathon is the pinnacle achievement for most runners, BAA spokesman Jack Fleming said. For Sunita to choose to run the 42.2 km in space on Patriots Day is really a tribute to the thousands of marathoners who are running here on Earth. She is pioneering a new frontier in running and in sports with her run, which will truly be out of this world.

 Williams has run a handful of marathons, and she went through rigorous testing before being blasted into orbit. But three months with little gravity takes a toll on a human, and Nasa requires all members of a station crew to exercise on the treadmill.

 The Boston marathon takes place on April 16.

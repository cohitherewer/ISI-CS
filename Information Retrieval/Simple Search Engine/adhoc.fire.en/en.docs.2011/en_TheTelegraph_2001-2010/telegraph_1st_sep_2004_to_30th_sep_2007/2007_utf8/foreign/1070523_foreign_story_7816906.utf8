 Musharraf balm for former PM

 Jamali

 Islamabad, May 22 (PTI): Former Pakistan Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Jamali, who quit the ruling party after accusing the government of mishandling the chief justice issue, today met President Pervez Musharraf apparently to work out a patch-up. 

 Jamali, who was eased out of the post by Musharraf in 2005, stunned Pakistan Muslim League-Q (PML-Q) leaders yesterday by submitting his resignation from the party at a meeting of the central executive committee attended among others by Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz.

 In his talks with Musharraf, Jamali told him the party leadership, especially PML-Q president Shujaat Hussain who succeeded him as interim Prime Minister in 2005 before Shaukat Aziz took over, ignores him and does not inform him about meetings or take him into confidence over important matters.

 Musharraf assured the former Prime Minister he would raise the issue with Hussain. Jamali, who hails from Balochistan, was expected to withdraw his resignation later. He also called for unity among the ruling politicians as this is the year of elections. Hussain had claimed after Jamalis resignation that the committee had rejected it.

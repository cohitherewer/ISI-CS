 Friends reunite

 Los Angeles, Jan. 16 (AP): Jennifer Aniston is rejoining Courteney Cox on prime time TV, but this time they are anything but friends.

 Aniston guest stars in the season finale of Coxs new FX Networks show Dirt, the network said. She plays Tina Harrod, a rival magazine editor of Coxs ruthless tabloid queen, Lucy Spiller.

 The episode, which airs on March 27, marks the first time the two Friends stars have worked together since the popular, long-running sitcom went off the air in 2004. Dirt takes a dark look at the relationship between the entertainment industry and the tabloids as it follows Cox as the hard-charging editor.

 Carrying champs

 Sonkajarvi, Finland July 8 (Reuters): Estonians took gold and silver at the world wife-carrying championships in this town in Finland yesterday, defying rain and exhaustion to stumble along a path with women clinging upside-down to their backs. 

 The race, held for the 12th time, has couples race along a 250-metre track, tackling a pool and several hurdles, with the men carrying the women on their backs.

 Berlin (Reuters): German police broke into a darkened flat fearing they would find a dead body after neighbours complained of a nasty smell seeping out onto the staircase. But instead of a corpse they found a tenant with badly smelling feet asleep in bed next to a pile of foul-smelling laundry, the police in the southwestern town of Kaiserslautern said.

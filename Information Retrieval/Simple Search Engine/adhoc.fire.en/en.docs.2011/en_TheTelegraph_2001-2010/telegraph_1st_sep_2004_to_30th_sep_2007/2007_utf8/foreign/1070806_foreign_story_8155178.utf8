 - Trio on sunset boulevard shortlist

 Meryl Streep: Frontrunner?

 Meryl Streep, 58, the double Oscar-winning star, is competing with Glenn Close, 60, one of her oldest friends, and Barbra Streisand, 65, who is riding high after the success of her 500-a-head worldwide concert tour.

 The women are on a shortlist being considered by Andrew Lloyd Webber, who composed the music for his version of the 1950 film classic, and Don Black and Christopher Hampton, who share equal credits for the shows book and lyrics. All three stars have been in discussions about taking on the role.

 Hampton, who also wrote the Oscar-winning Dangerous Liaisons, said: Meryl Streep is on our list. It was during the last round of discussions when her name came up. Glenn Close is also on the list, as is Streisand.

 Streep, who is regarded as one of the finest actresses of her generation, has rarely sung on screen, though famously performed Know Me in her 1990 hit comedy Postcards From The Edge. She is, however, currently filming the starring role of Donna in the screen adaptation of Mamma Mia!, the Abba musical.

 Paramount Studios, which owns the rights to the original Sunset Boulevard film, has a key role in deciding to whom the part will go, and most of Streeps recent string of successes, including The Devil Wears Prada, have been bankrolled by that studio.

 Lloyd Webbers musical is based on Paramounts film, starring Gloria Swanson and William Holden. It tells the story of the doomed relationship between Norma Desmond, a forgotten silent film star, and Joe Gillis, an ambitious but penniless young screenwriter with whom she falls in love.

 Desmond is desperate to reclaim her stardom and gain an audience with Cecil B. DeMille, the Hollywood director. Her ambition costs her her sanity and Gillis his life. The film ends shortly after Desmond shoots Gillis dead and utters the immortal line, All right, Mr DeMille, Im ready for my close-up.

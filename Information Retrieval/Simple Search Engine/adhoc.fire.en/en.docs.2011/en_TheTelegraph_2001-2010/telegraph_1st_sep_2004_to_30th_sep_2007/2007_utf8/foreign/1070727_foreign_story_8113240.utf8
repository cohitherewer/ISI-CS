 Aziz: Time to go

 Islamabad, July 26: Rumours about a big change at the top were rife in Islamabad today amid political uncertainty that has gripped Pakistan ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled to be held at the end of this year or early next year. 

 While deputy information minister Tariq Azeem denied there is a possibility that Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz will be replaced by Pakistan Muslim League chief Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, the local media insisted that the government and the presidential camp are pondering a change in the political set up. 

 The strategy is aimed at repairing the damage sustained by the government after the Lal Masjid operation and the supreme courts decision to reinstate Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry as the chief justice, the Dawn and The Nation newspapers quoted well-placed sources as saying. 

 The proposals being considered include replacing Shaukat Aziz with Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain in the Prime Ministers House. 

 Hussain cut short his visit to London on Sunday after receiving a telephone call from President Pervez Musharraf and returned home. 

 He is likely to be given the task of gathering public support for an extension in the tenure of the present assemblies by one year.

 This will lead to a reshuffle in the cabinet and replacement of the suave banker who became Prime Minister in 2004 after his predecessor Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamalis sudden and mysterious resignation. 

 It is known that Aziz has already been taken into confidence on the new strategy and he has raised no objections to the plan which may unfold in a few days. 

 Rumours of changes at the top have been boosted by unusually detailed talks held between Musharraf, Aziz, Hussain, Punjab chief minister Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi, National Assembly speaker Chaudhry Amir Hussain and PML secretary-general Mushahid Hussain Sayed in the last 72 hours, Dawn claimed. 

 The winds of a possible change began appearing on the horizon in April when the presidential reference against Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry backfired and took a violent and political turn due to its mishandling by the administration. 

 Quoting a source who has access to high-level consultations, the Dawn claims that the whole situation demands a national approach involving all other parties and groups. 

 It is being considered that after taking the oath of office Hussain should convene an all-party conference (APC) with the agenda of discussing the US threat of attacking al Qaida and Taliban targets in Pakistani territory . 

 In the proposed conference, the issue of extension of the tenure of the Assemblies will be mooted for a consensus. 

 The APC, in which almost all the parties, including the Pakistan Peoples Party, will take part, would discuss and formalise a national consensus on electoral code of conduct.

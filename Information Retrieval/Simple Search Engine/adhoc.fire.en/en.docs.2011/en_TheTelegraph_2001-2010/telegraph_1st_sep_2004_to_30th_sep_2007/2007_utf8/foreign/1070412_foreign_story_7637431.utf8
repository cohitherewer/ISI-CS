 Singapore PM to donate pay 

 Singapore, April 11 (Reuters): Singapores Prime Minister said today he would donate his S$600,000 ($395,800) pay rise for each of the next five years as he defended a 60 per cent increase in ministers million-dollar salaries.

 Lee Hsien Loong, who is set to earn S$3.1 million ($2.1 million) this year following this weeks pay rise or five times President George Bushs salary told parliament he did not expect other ministers to donate their pay increases.

 The governments decision to jack up salaries for ministers and top civil servants already among the highest-paid in the world has brought criticism from ordinary Singaporeans, many of whom consider the move tactless given the widening rich-poor gap in the city-state.

 For five years, whatever the increase in salary above the present level, I will donate, said Lee, who earned S$2.5 million ($1.65 million) previously, in parliament today.

 Lee said this would give him the moral standing to defend the move to raise ministers salaries.

 The salaries of Singapore ministers were raised by about 60 per cent to an average of S$1.9 million ($1.26 million) on Monday, just short of the S$2.2 million that the government had initially proposed.

 Sunita lands safely at back-up site

 Edwards Air Force Base (California), June 22 (AP): The space shuttle Atlantis, carrying Sunita Williams and six other astronauts, returned to Earth safely at 1.20 am IST on Saturday.

 The shuttle landed at its back-up location in California after rain and clouds over Florida ruled out Kennedy Space Center. We couldnt quite get comfortable with (Kennedy), Mission Control told the Atlantis crew before the landing. We are going to target Edwards.

 Nasa managers decided to skip an earlier chance to land in Florida because of showers that were within 54 km of the landing strip and clouds below 2,438 metres, both violations of flight rules.

 Earlier, aboard Atlantis, flight engineer Sunita Williams and her six colleagues put on their orange spacesuits and closed the shuttles payload bay doors, which are kept opened during flights to keep heat from building up.

Had the landing not taken place at Edwards, Atlantis would have had to wait until tomorrow and White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico, where a space shuttle has landed only once, would have become a third landing option.

 On Saturday, if we still have not landed, well bring up all three sites. This is what we call pick em day, flight director Norm Knight had said.

 Nasa prefers to use Kennedy, where it is easier and far cheaper to get Atlantis to its hangar to be prepared for its next mission in December. 

 The landing in California will cost $1.7 million and take up to 10 days to get the shuttle home to Florida aboard a jumbo jet. Atlantis had enough power for its systems to orbit until Sunday, but managers did not want to wait that long.

 Nasa had said the flight would be extended to Sunday only if technical problems needed to be fixed.

 The shuttle was barred from landing in rain because of potential damage to the thousands of black ceramic tiles that protect its underside from the searing heat of re-entry through the atmosphere.

 During the crews 14-day mission to the international space station, a $100-billion project of 16 nations that is a little more than half finished, the astronauts installed a new truss segment, unfurled a new pair of power-generating solar arrays and activated a rotating joint that allows the new solar arrays to track the sun.

 Originally scheduled for 11 days, the mission was extended by two days to give astronauts time to repair a thermal blanket that had peeled away during the June 8 launch. Astronaut Danny Olivas stapled it back into place during a spacewalk.

 An extra day in orbit was added after the weather in Florida prevented a landing yesterday. Nasa has been meticulous about scouring the shuttles for damage once they reach orbit since a heat shield failure triggered the destruction of the shuttle Columbia in 2003 and the deaths of seven astronauts, including Kalpana Chawla.

 The Atlantis crew also delivered a new astronaut to the station. Clayton Anderson replaced Sunita, who is returning home aboard Atlantis after a record-breaking six months in space.

 Sunita surpassed Shannon Lucids 188-day mission for the longest space flight by a woman. Although it was her first space flight, Sunita became the worlds most experienced woman space walker with four excursions clocking over 29 hours and 17 minutes to top Kathy Thorntons 21-hour space-walking record. 

 Nasa needs to fly 12 more construction missions to finish building the station before the end of 2010.

 The US space agency also would like to squeeze in two resupply missions and a final servicing call to the Hubble Space Telescope. The shuttles visit to the space station was complicated by the crash of Russian computers that control oxygen production.

 Atlantis helped the station maintain its orientation for several days until the computers were revived. Cosmonauts Fyodor Yurchikhin and Oleg Kotov used a cable to bypass a circuit board. Astronauts conserved the shuttles power in case they needed to spend an extra day at the station.

 The cosmonauts at the space station attempted to power the Russian computers yesterday without using the cable bypass, but it was unsuccessful.

 Pak rejects US strike plan

 Islamabad, July 20 (Reuters): Pakistan insisted today that only its own troops can carry out counter-terrorism actions on its soil, rejecting a Washington statement that US forces kept all options open in striking at al Qaida or the Taliban.

 We remain determined not to allow al Qaida or any other terrorist entity to establish a safe haven on our territory, Pakistani foreign ministry spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam said.Whatever counter-terrorism action is to be taken inside Pakistan, it will be taken by our own security forces.

 Endeavour finally docks with space post

 Houston, Aug. 10 (Reuters): The US space shuttle Endeavour today completed a two-day trek to intercept the International Space Station and docked with the orbital outpost to deliver its next-to-last support beam and more than two tonnes of gear.

 Shuttle commander Scott Kelly gently pulsed his spaceships steering jets to align a docking ring in Endeavours open cargo bay with a matching latch mounted on the front of the stations Destiny laboratory module.

 The rings clasped shut at 1802 GMT as the two spacecraft sailed 344 km above the Pacific. Welcome on board, said station commander Fyodor Yurchikhin as a ships bell on the station was rung to signal the shuttles arrival, copying a naval tradition.

 Only two of Endeavours seven Nasa astronauts have ever been to the outpost. Flight engineer Rick Mastracchios mission took place before resident crews, made up principally of US astronauts and Russian cosmonauts, began living there in November 2000. Shuttle pilot Charles Hobaugh visited in 2001.

 Were waiting for you, station flight engineer Clay Anderson radioed Kelly as the shuttle made its final approach.

 An hour before docking, Kelly stopped 122 metres shy of the outpost and slowly back-flipped Endeavour so that station cosmonauts Yurchikhin and Oleg Kotov could snap pictures of the shuttles wings and belly.

 Engineers on the ground planned to scrutinise the images to determine if Endeavours heat shield is in good shape for landing.

 The survey, one of at least three scheduled during Endeavours 11-to-14-day mission, was implemented after the 2003 Columbia accident, the cause of which was traced to a heat shield breach caused when a piece of insulating foam fell off the shuttles fuel tank and hit the ships wing during launch. The shuttle broke apart 16 days later as it flew through the atmosphere for landing.

 Initial analysis showed Endeavours tank shed several small pieces of foam during its climb to orbit but none were expected to be a concern for Endeavours mission, managers said. The station crews pictures will be added to a growing pool of ground- and shuttle-based data so engineers can make a final assessment on the shuttles condition.

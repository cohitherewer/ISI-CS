 Naomi service

 New York, March 19 (AP): For five days beginning this morning, British supermodel Naomi Campbell can expect to be pushing a broom or mopping floors at a New York Sanitation Department depot in Manhattan to fulfil her sentence of community service for throwing a cellphone at her maid.

 Unlike the singer Boy George, who had to serve a similar community service sentence in full view of TV cameras, the sentencing judge allowed Campbell to be assigned to work indoors and she has been ordered to begin work at Manhattan District 3 Garage, Pier 36. The judge also granted her request to delay her service until after several fashion shows. 

 While community service has been employed in US courts for decades, the punishment has gained a higher profile after the celebrity sentences. Television cameras were on the scene when Boy George found himself using a broom to sweep a driveway at a New York Sanitation Department depot. The singer had pleaded guilty to falsely reporting a burglary at his lower Manhattan apartment. The responding officers found cocaine there. While he did not respond to requests for comment at the time through his lawyer, the singer did tell the makers of a British documentary: Ive enjoyed it in a bizarre Boy George kind of way.

 Besides community service, Campbell was ordered to pay the maids medical expenses and attend a two-day anger management programme.

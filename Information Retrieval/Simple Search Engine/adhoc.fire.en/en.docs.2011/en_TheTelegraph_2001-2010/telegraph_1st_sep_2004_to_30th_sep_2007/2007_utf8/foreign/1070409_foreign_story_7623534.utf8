 Wheel turns for Brown

 Out of favour

 London, April 8 (Reuters): British finance minister Gordon Brown, overwhelming favourite to succeed Tony Blair as Prime Minister, suffered a blow today when an opinion poll showed more than half of Britons thought he was unfit to lead the country.

 In another setback for Brown, a newspaper said there was growing pressure for another member of the cabinet to challenge the chancellor of the exchequer for the leadership of the ruling Labour Party when Blair steps down.

 Blair is widely expected to quit in June or July after a decade in office. With no serious challenger yet emerging, Brown has been seen as a virtually automatic choice to succeed Blair as party leader and Prime Minister.

 But some Labour politicians doubt Browns leadership credentials and opinion polls show he would fare badly against David Cameron, leader of the main Opposition Conservatives.

 The Sunday Times said only 27 per cent of 2,218 people questioned in a YouGov poll thought Brown was fit to be Prime Minister after a row last week over his handling of pensions. Fifty-seven per cent thought him unfit.

 The poll showed Britons were losing faith in Browns stewardship of the economy his strong point until now.

 Forty-one per cent thought Brown was doing a good job as finance minister, down from 51 per cent in March.

 Since then, Brown has delivered a budget that cut income tax but clawed back revenues elsewhere.

 The poll showed the Conservatives stretching their lead to eight percentage points, up from six a month ago.

 The Sunday Telegraph said home secretary John Reid was pressing environment secretary David Miliband to challenge for the leadership to stop Brown taking over.

 If Miliband refused, Reid himself was prepared to challenge Brown, it said.

 Miliband has repeatedly said he has no plans to challenge for the leadership, while Reid has not ruled out standing.

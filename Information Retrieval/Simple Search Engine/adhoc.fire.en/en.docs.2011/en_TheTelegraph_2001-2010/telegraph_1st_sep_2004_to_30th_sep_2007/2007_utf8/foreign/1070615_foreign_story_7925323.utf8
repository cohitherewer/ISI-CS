 Trouble for Pluto, again

 Washington, June 14 (AP): Pity poor Pluto, the puny former planet is facing yet another indignity.

 This is sort of Plutos last stand, joked Emily L. Schaller of California Institute of Technology, co-author of a report in todays issue of the journal Science.

 Planetary astronomy professor Michael E. Brown and student Schaller found Eris, another dwarf planet, to be the biggest while studying its moon Dysnomia. Eris is the Greek goddess of rivalry.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Court confrontation looms

 Islamabad, Sept. 11 (AP): Lawyers for former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif filed a petition in the supreme court today challenging his deportation to Saudi Arabia, setting up another confrontation between the judiciary and Pakistans military ruler as he battles to hold onto power.

 President Pervez Musharraf sent Sharif, the Premier he ousted in a 1999 coup, back into exile yesterday after the Opposition leader landed on a flight from London. Sharif, who had vowed to return home to campaign against Musharraf, was also charged with corruption during his four-hour stay in the country.

 Sharifs lawyers yesterday petitioned the supreme court to start proceedings against the government for contempt in relation to the deportation. Last month, the court ruled that Sharif had an inalienable right to return home and that authorities should not obstruct him.

 We will fight this battle in the court of law, Sharifs nephew, Hamza, said on the steps of the supreme court after the petition was filed. We are fully confident that we will win, God willing.

 Interior ministry spokesman Javed Iqbal Cheema denied any wrongdoing, but said the government would reply to the petition if the court accepts it. In two towns in eastern Pakistan, several hundred people protested the deportation and the government of Musharraf, who has allied himself closely with the US since the September 11, 2001, attacks.

 About 200 members of Sharifs party and other Opposition groups blocked traffic on a road in Lahore, chanting slogans.

 The supreme court has emerged as a check on Musharrafs dominance since his failed attempt to fire the countrys top judge earlier this year that sparked a nationwide protest movement.

 It is already hearing petitions challenging Musharrafs holding of the post of army chief and President simultaneously and his eligibility to contest upcoming presidential elections. 

 Analysts say yesterdays decision to expel Sharif will deepen Musharrafs unpopularity in Pakistan and reinforce impressions that he is an authoritarian leader. It could also undermine the legitimacy of legislative elections due by January 2008. Ali Ahmed Kurd, a senior member of the Pakistan Bar Council, said lawyers across the country were boycotting court proceedings.

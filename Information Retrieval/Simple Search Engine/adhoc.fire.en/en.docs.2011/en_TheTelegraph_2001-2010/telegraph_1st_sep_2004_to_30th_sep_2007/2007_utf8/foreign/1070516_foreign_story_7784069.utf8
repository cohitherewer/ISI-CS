 Cyclone sweeps into Bangladesh

 Dhaka, May 15 (Reuters): A tidal surge triggered by a storm in the Bay of Bengal swept through coastal districts of Bangladesh and Myanmar today, killing at least one fisherman and damaging hundreds of homes, officials said.

 Weather officials said the storm, with winds of up to 80 kmph, crossed the Bangladesh coast at dawn, heading east towards Myanmar.

 Crops and shrimp farms were washed away in the 1.2 metre high surge in the wake of the storm, but it did not cause as much damage as initially feared, the officials said.

 Meteorologists in Myanmar said some areas of Sittwe, a coastal city in the northwest, were under water.

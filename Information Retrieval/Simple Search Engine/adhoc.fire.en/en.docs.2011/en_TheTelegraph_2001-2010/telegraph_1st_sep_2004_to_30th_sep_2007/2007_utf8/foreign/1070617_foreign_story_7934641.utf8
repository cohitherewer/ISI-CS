 Eddie takes paternity test

 Los Angeles, June 16 (AP): Eddie Murphy has taken a DNA test to determine if he is the father of Melanie Browns 2-month-old daughter, the former Spice Girls spokeswoman said.

 The 46-year-old actor did indeed take a paternity test Natalie Whorms said yesterday. Murphys spokesman, Arnold Robinson, has declined to comment about Browns claims. Yesterday, he said he would not confirm the paternity test. We do not comment on Murphys personal life.

 Brown, who was known as Scary Spice when she performed with the Nineties pop group Spice Girls, dated Murphy last year and has maintained that the child is his.

 The 32-year-old singer gave birth to Angel Iris Murphy Brown on April 3. She listed Murphy as the father on the birth certificate. When asked about impending fatherhood in December, Murphy told a television reporter: And I dont know whose child that is until it comes out and has a blood test.

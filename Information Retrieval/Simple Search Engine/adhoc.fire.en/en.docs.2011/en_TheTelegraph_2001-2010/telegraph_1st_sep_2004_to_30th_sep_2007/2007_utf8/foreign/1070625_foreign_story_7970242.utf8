 Ottawa (Reuters): Sorry Fluffy. Tough luck, Fido. Air Canada will be banning all pets from its passenger planes from July 15 this year.

 Mayor plan

 Rome (Reuters): An Italian towns mayor hopes to shame men into not using prostitutes by photographing cars that pick them up and publishing the details in local newspapers. Cesare De Martin, mayor of the northern town of San Fior near Venice, has said he planned to give local police digital cameras and instruct them to photograph any cars seen stopping to liaise with prostitutes. Ads in local newspapers with the number plates will then be published.

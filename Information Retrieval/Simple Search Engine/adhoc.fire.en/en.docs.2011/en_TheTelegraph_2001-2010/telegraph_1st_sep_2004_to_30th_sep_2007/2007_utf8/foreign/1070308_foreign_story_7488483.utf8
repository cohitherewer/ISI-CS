 Putin fights for soccer fan rights

 Moscow, March 7 (Reuters): President Vladimir Putin today defended the right of Russian soccer fans to watch matches free on television.

 The President, whose hands-on I feel for you style appeals to many Russians, lashed out at a deal on exclusive broadcasts of national championship matches struck by the Russian Football Union and satellite television station NTV-Plus.

 NTV-Plus, together with the Russian soccer union and its chairman Vitaly Mutko have done one of those strange things. They want to rob us, soccer fans, of a free broadcast of matches, Putin told first deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev at a meeting.

 Have a chat with them on this issue, Putin said in remarks shown on national television. 

 Alright, Ill call everyone, Medvedev responded.

 State-controlled national TV channels routinely show Putin giving instructions to top officials, but the soccer issue was an unusual instance of addressing a matter outside the governments usual purview.

 Pak judge calls for rule of law

 Islamabad, March 28 (PTI): Pakistans suspended Chief Justice Iftikar Muhammad Chaudhry today called for an independent judiciary and rule of law during a meeting at the Bar Council in Rawalpindi.

 He made no reference to the charges levelled against him by President Musharraf. It is the duty of the government and the constitution to respect and observe the independence of judiciary, Justice Chaudhry said.

 The suspended top judge of Pakistan said it was the responsibility of the government to give a free hand to the judiciary so that it can take the right decisions at the right time. 

 Unlike his two earlier trips on March 12 and March 16 that sparked widespread clashes, Chaudhry was driven to Rawalpindi by his lawyer, Atezaj Ahsan without any obstruction from the police.

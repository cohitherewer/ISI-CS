 Kathmandu , Feb. 12: After waging an armed struggle for more than a decade, Maoist rebels are finally ready to lock away their weapons in special containers under UN supervision by Friday. 

 Special UN teams have been making an inventory of the weapons in specially erected cantonments for the last few years. They are now poised to complete the process by end of this week, UN special representative Ian Martin said here today. 

 Addressing a news conference, Martin said that his teams were also registering members of the Maoist Peoples Liberation Army. 

 The registration of weapons and combatants has been already completed in five of the seven cantonment sites. In the remaining two sites, the UN team has begun the process today,he said. 

 Martin added that he would give the full details of the arms and combatants to the government and the Maoist leaders and discuss how to make them public. 

 Consequent to the completion of the first stage, the second stage will be started whereby the monitors will verify the registered combatants regarding their age and so on. As per the earlier understanding, only those combatants who have been recruited by the Maoists before May 2006 and who are over 18 years of age can be registered, he said. 

 Giving details of the registration process, Martin said that he personally reviewed the arrangements at Kailali and Surkhet. Our interim task force and arms monitors are living on the site and monitoring the process around the clock, he said, adding that once the weapons are locked in the containers, the UN teams would test the installation of closed-circuit television system which will keep a watch on the containers.

 Sarkozy amp; a love letter

 Paris, Sept. 29 (Reuters): Was it a love letter, and if so, who was it addressed to?

 That was the question being asked in France yesterday after French President Nicolas Sarkozy was photographed leaving a cabinet meeting clutching a hand-written note to his side.

 A blow-up of the letter showed what appeared to be a womans handwriting and a note in which she expressed regret over their prolonged separation. I have the feeling that I havent seen you for an eternity and I miss you... a million kisses, said the letter.

 The picture was snapped on September 12 as Sarkozy left his office, but only came to the public eye on Thursday when it appeared on a magazines website.

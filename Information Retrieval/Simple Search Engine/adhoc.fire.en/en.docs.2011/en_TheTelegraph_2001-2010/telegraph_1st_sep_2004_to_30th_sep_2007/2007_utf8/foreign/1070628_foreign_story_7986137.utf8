 Global unease with US rising

 Not trustworthy

 Washington, June 27 (AP): Unease with American foreign policy and with President George W. Bush has intensified in countries that are some of the closest US allies, while Russia and China also face growing international wariness, a survey released today said.

 Support for the US-led war in Iraq, the Nato military action in Afghanistan and worldwide American efforts against terrorism have dropped since 2002, according to an international survey by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. 

 Views of the US in much of the Muslim world remain particularly negative.

 In one measure of Bushs unpopularity, the poll showed he is less trusted on foreign policy than Russian President Vladimir Putin by allies Britain, Germany and Canada, even as faith in Putin has plummeted. About half in the US say they have little or no trust in either leaders conduct of foreign affairs.

 Bushs sagging numbers partly reflect widespread opposition to the US war in Iraq. Of the countries surveyed which included the US more people favoured the removal of American forces from Iraq in all but Israel, Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya.

 Even though there is a mixed view of the US around the world, there is increasing disapproval of the principal cornerstones of our foreign policy, said Pew president Andrew Kohut. The state department declined to comment on the report. The US is still seen favourably in most countries surveyed, including India, Japan, Italy, Israel and many countries in Africa.

 American culture and technology are widely admired, and many believe a better life can be had by moving to the US. Yet wide-ranging majorities think the US does not consider their interests when formulating foreign policy; worry that US customs are hurting their countries; and think the US contributes to the gap between rich and poor nations.

 As the US has waged its battle against terrorism over the past five years, its overall image has worsened. It has dropped from 75 per cent favourable in Britain in 2002 to 51 per cent now; from 60 per cent to 30 per cent in Germany; and from 64 per cent to 56 per cent in Mexico.

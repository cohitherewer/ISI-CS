 Call to rebuild Berlin Wall

 Berlin, Aug. 13 (Reuters): Politicians and artists urged Berlins authorities today to let them rebuild the longest surviving section of the Berlin Wall before it decays beyond recognition as a reminder of the citys grim history.

 In the spring of 1990, when most of the city was itching to tear down its most hated symbol, 118 artists from 24 countries flocked to Berlin to paint murals on a 1,300 metre section of the wall, turning it into the East Side Gallery.

 The steel reinforcing the inside of the wall is rusting, and wind, rain and pollution alongside years of vandalism have left many of the works all but unrecognisable.

 Putin in harshest US attack

 Munich, Feb. 10 (Reuters): Russian President Vladimir Putin, in one of his harshest attacks on the US in seven years in power, accused Washington today of attempting to force its will on the world.

 In a speech in Germany, that one US senator said smacked of Cold War rhetoric, Putin accused the US of making the world a more dangerous place by pursuing policies aimed at making it one single master.

 Attacking the concept of a unipolar world in which the US was the sole superpower, he said: What is a unipolar world? No matter how we beautify this term it means one single centre of power, one single centre of force and one single master.

 It has nothing in common with democracy because that is the opinion of the majority taking into account the minority opinion, he told the gathering of top security and defence officials.

 People are always teaching us democracy but the people who teach us democracy dont want to learn it themselves, he said.

 Clean-up call for Everest

 Hillary

 Kathmandu, April 15 (Reuters): Sir Edmund Hillary, the first man to climb Mount Everest, today urged people to keep the mountain clean.

 Nearly 1,800 people have conquered the worlds highest peak at 8,850 metres (29,035 feet) since Hillary and his Nepali climbing mate Tenzing Norgay Sherpa made their historic ascent in 1953.

 Over the years, the slopes have become a dumping ground with mountaineers leaving behind tonnes of supplies, climbing gear, oxygen bottles, gas cans, batteries and ropes.

 Nepali and foreign climbers have removed some of the garbage in recent years, but Hillary said it was not enough.

 It is very important for the people on the mountain to treat the mountains with considerable respect... do all you can to protect them, keep them clean, Hillary said in an interview with Reuters.

 ...People have tried to clean up the mountain and some good work has been done. But it is not enough. There is still a lot to be done to keep mountains like Everest clean.

 I would have to say if you attempt Mount Everest with considerable care and dont get carried away... the satisfaction from climbing the mountain is very considerable, Hillary added.

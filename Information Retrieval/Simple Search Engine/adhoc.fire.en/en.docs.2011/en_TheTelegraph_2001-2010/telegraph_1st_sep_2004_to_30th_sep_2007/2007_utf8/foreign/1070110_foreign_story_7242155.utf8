 Kylie beats Kate in dress 

 Kylie: Changed look

 London, Jan. 9 (Reuters): Australian pop star Kylie Minogue has topped fashion magazine Glamours annual list of best-dressed female celebrities after her battle with cancer, replacing last years winner, British supermodel Kate Moss. 

 The 38-year-old singer, on the comeback trail since undergoing breast cancer surgery in May 2005, was praised for her understated look, in contrast to the flamboyant costumes she has sported during her Showgirl Homecoming Tour. 

 Weve seen a newer, softer-looking Kylie emerge this year shes still sexy, but shes not flaunting that side of herself in gold hotpants any more, said Jo Elvin, editor of Glamour. Shes letting it shine through subtly, with a class personal style that women really identify with. 

 Minogue jumped from No. 26 on the list in 2006, while Moss slipped to fourth this year from first place in 2006 and her British rocker boyfriend, Pete Doherty, frontman of the band Babyshambles, was named one of the worst-dressed males. 

 In second place was Victoria Beckham, former member of girl band the Spice Girls and wife of soccer player David Beckham, who was named the best-dressed male. 

 US socialite Nicole Richie, the rail-thin reality TV star, came in third place and British actress Sienna Miller rounded off the top five in fifth.

 Sarkozy in fray 

 Paris, Jan. 14 (Reuters): Frances ruling UMP party officially named interior minister Nicolas Sarkozy as its candidate for the 2007 presidential election to challenge Socialist Segolene Royal. 

 Sarkozy, the only candidate standing, won with 98.1 per cent of the votes cast, or 69.06 per cent of the total vote of party members. 

 Repeated attacks by President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin have highlighted his strident image and fuelled suspicions they would be happy to see the interior minister lose in May.

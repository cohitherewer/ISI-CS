 School made with India aid faces Maoist threat

 Kathmandu, April 4 (PTI): A day after the Maoists joined the interim government, some activists allegedly sent an extortion note to the management of a higher secondary school in southern Nepal which was constructed with Indian assistance.

 The rebels warned the management of the Khajuri Higher Secondary School in Dhanusha district that if they didnt get Rs 4 lakhs , the Maoists would explode a bomb at the schools newly-built building, sources said.

 A memorandum of understanding was signed between the schools management and the Indian embassy in November 2004 for the project and the Indian government had provided Rs 15 lakhs for its construction.

 The school management has informed the Indian embassy about the incident. The embassy has asked the Nepal government to provide security to the school.

 Last year, the Maoists had extorted Rs 2.5 lakh from the contractor who built the school whose inauguration will be held in May.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Brown overruled on post

 London, July 29 (PTI): British Prime Minister Gordon Brown wanted to appoint his former confidante at the Treasury, Shriti Vadera, as a senior adviser at Number 10, but was overruled by cabinet secretary Sir Gus Donnell, media reports today said. 

 Donnell was previously permanent secretary to the Treasury, from where Vadera took a long trip to India to enable personal clashes in the department to be resolved.

 After Donnells apparent intervention, Brown gave Shriti the shriek a peerage and made her a junior minister at the department for international development.

 Baroness Vadera of Holland Park, who was born in Uganda but grew up in India, is known for her determined manner.

 A cabinet office spokesperson, however, insisted that Donnell had no objections of that kind to Vaderas appointment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Wallet full of cash returned

 Lynnwood (Washington), Feb. 8 (AP): A taxi driver says he never thought twice about returning a wallet containing $5,950.

 If money doesnt belong to me, I dont keep it, said Vinod Mago, 55, an Indian immigrant. I know God is watching everybody, every second. Mago had just started his shift on February 1 when his taxi coordinator called to say a distraught man was missing his wallet.

 Mago found the wallet in the backseat and raced to the airport in time to return it to the owner, who gave him and the taxi coordinator $100 each in gratitude. 

 The wallets owner said he was planning to buy a car with the cash. My mother always said: If youre an honest person, you will always have money in your pocket, Mago said. 

 However, in San Rafael, California, a black man says a white taxi driver locked him in his cab and drove him to jail because he thought the passenger fit the profile of a man who had skipped two fares.

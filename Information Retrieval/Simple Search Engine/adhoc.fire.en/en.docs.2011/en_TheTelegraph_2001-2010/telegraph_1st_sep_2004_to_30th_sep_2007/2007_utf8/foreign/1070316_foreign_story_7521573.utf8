 Victory in court spurs spam war

 London, March 15 (Reuters): An Internet consultant who won damages in a Scottish court after he received a single unwanted email has launched a campaign to help people tackle spammers.

 Gordon Dick, 30, has set up a website with the motto: Make the Spammers Pay! that tells people how to take legal action against those who send unsolicited email.

 He faces an uphill battle as spam makes up about 80 per cent of the billions of emails sent each day, according to US Internet security company Postini.

 Dick, who won 750 pounds ($1,443) plus costs in an Edinburgh court after suing over the unwanted email last month, hopes others around the world will follow his lead.

 However, the company which sent the email denies sending spam.

 It was a major decision to take, said Dick, from Edinburgh, whose website is http://scotchspam.org.uk. I had never been in a court before, Id never dealt with the legal process and I was doing this unrepresented.

 Jittery Pak fears more attacks

 Islamabad, July 28 (AFP): Pakistan today boosted security fearing further attacks a day after a suicide bombing during protests at Islamabads pro-Taliban Lal Masjid killed 14 people.

 Authorities were also investigating how the attacker was able to strike at a crowded market in the heart of the capital, the 13th suicide blast to hit the country since a bloody army raid on the mosque on July 10.

 The bomber targeted officers policing Islamic students who had occupied the controversial Lal Masjid to demand that their jailed former cleric should lead prayers after its chaotic reopening yesterday.

 Security has been tightened and a joint investigation team has been assembled, interior ministry spokesman Brigadier Javed Cheema said.

 Cheema added that the remains of the suicide bomber had been found and were being DNA-tested to establish his identity. He said the mosque had been closed indefinitely, adding that the suicide attack was in all probability linked to the Lal Masjid issue. 

 Islamabad police chief Iftikhar Chaudhry said 56 people had been arrested over the mosque disturbance and were being interrogated but no one had yet claimed responsibility for the attack.

 Senior Islamabad police officer Shahid Nadeem Baluch said police had set up extra pickets at all entry and exit points of the capital.

 Found: Formula for the perfect bra fit

 London, July 23: Curvy women could soon find a bra revolution making life slightly more comfortable.

 For 70 years bra designers have stuck to a formula which decides sizes through measuring under and across the bust.

 But now researchers in Hong Kong have come up with a different mathematical equation which they say will produce shapelier outlines and greater comfort for Chinese women. If successful, their bra-sizing system could be adopted across the globe.

 They say there are more than 100 key measurements necessary to produce the perfect fit, and bra sizes should be based on a new depth/width ratio or DWR.

 Writing in the International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University team says that a womans breast is a very complex 3D geometry and the existing sizing system may be inappropriate in the categorisation of breast sizes for bras.

 As a result, the report points out, as many as 70 per cent of women in Britain are wearing the wrong-sized bra.

 Until now, bra sizes have followed a formula devised in America in 1935. Alphabet bras were born advertised then as A cup (youthful); B cup (average); C cup (large); and D cup (heavy). The Hong Kong teams system follows 3D scanning of 456 Chinese women.

 The researchers 100 measurements have been honed down to just eight factors to describe the breast shape overall build, breast volume, inner, outer and lower breast shape, height, and gradient and orientation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Poll pressure mounts on Musharraf

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 Problems at home

 Islamabad, June 14: Pervez Musharraf, facing the worst political crisis of his eight-year rule, is under intense domestic and international pressure on the twin issues of his uniform and holding free and fair polls.

 The signs of pressure on the President and increasing dissent within the ruling Pakistan Muslim League over his policies became apparent after party secretary-general and senator Mushahid Hussain asked him to convene an all-party conference. The agenda: the setting up of an independent election commission.

 Hussain, who raised the demand in the Upper House yesterday, did so almost a week after Musharraf took a swipe at his political allies for leaving him in the lurch.

 Hussain did not respond to Musharrafs allegations then, but hardly minced words in the Senate when he called for free polls. This is the time when the President should call an all-party conference, which should include representatives of the Opposition, to deliberate upon the solutions of problems faced by the country.

 The meeting, Hussain said, will strengthen national reconciliation, uphold the democratic process and safeguard Pakistans status as the worlds freest Muslim country. 

 Hussains call coincided with US assistant secretary of state Richard Bouchers remarks last night that Washington was pressing Musharraf on free and fair elections. Musharraf had made some commitments on the issues of free and fair elections, he said.

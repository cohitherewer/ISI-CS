 Sailors admit illegal entry: Iran

 Tehran, March 24 (Reuters): Irans military said today British naval personnel seized in the Gulf confessed to entering its waters illegally, but Britain insisted they were detained inside Iraqi territory.

 Iranian forces seized 15 British sailors and marines yesterday at the mouth of the Shatt al-Arab waterway, which marks the southern stretch of Iraqs border with Iran, triggering a diplomatic crisis at a time of heightened tension over Tehrans nuclear ambitions.

 The semi-official Fars news agency said they had been transferred to the capital Tehran to explain their aggressive action, but this could not be immediately confirmed. Fars also said the captured Britons included some women.

 These people are under investigation and have confessed that they have violated the waters of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the ISNA news agency quoted a senior military official as saying. The official, Deputy Commander Alireza Afshar, told state radio the Britons were in good health. The investigation is going on and they are healthy and there is no problem.

 Britain has not released the identities of the personnel. We still maintain they were in Iraqi waters when they were picked up, a British diplomat in Tehran said, adding he had no information they had been moved to Tehran.

 Britain said two boatloads of royal navy sailors and marines had searched a merchant vessel on a UN approved mission in Iraqi waters when Iranian gunboats encircled and captured them.

 Irans foreign ministry condemned what it called the illegal entry into Iranian waters as asuspicious act, the official Irna news agency said.

 The incident sent oil prices up more than one per cent to a three-month high yesterday. It took place a day after Iran launched a week of naval war games along its coast, including the Gulfs northern reaches which give access to the oil output of Iraq, Iran and Kuwait.

 It also came ahead of an expected UN Security Council vote on new arms and financial sanctions on Iran over its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment, which the West suspects is designed to make atom bombs.

 Tehran denies the charge, saying it is only aimed at generating electricity. In London, Britain summoned Irans ambassador for a meeting to demand the groups immediate release, a foreign office spokeswoman said. 

 Iranian state television said yesterday Iran had summoned the British charge daffaires to protest over the incident. It was similar to one in 2004 in which eight British servicemen spent three nights in the hands of Iranian Revolutionary Guards before being released unharmed.

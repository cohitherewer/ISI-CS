The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Poll protesters held in Pak 

 Islamabad, Sept. 23 (Reuters): Pakistani police have arrested more than a dozen Opposition activists in a bid to scupper protests against President Pervez Musharrafs plans for re-election on October 6, officials said.

 The supreme court was set to resume hearings tomorrow challenging Musharrafs right to retain the posts of President and army chief, the legality of being elected in uniform, and whether he should be allowed to get a mandate from outgoing assemblies. It is expected to issue a ruling next week.

 Most of those arrested in Islamabad late yesterday belonged to the party led by exiled former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, whose return to Pakistan was blocked earlier this month, and from parties in a conservative religious alliance.

 We have detained 14 persons as a preventive measure. They have given calls for protests and we have fears that they may create disturbances in the coming days, Islamabads top administrator, Chaudhry Mohammad Ali, said. He said he expected more arrests to be made.

 The chairman of Sharifs faction of the Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N), Raja Zafar-ul-Haq, and firebrand leader Javed Hashmi were among those arrested, along with Hussain Ahmed, a central leader of the religious alliance, Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal.

 PML-N spokesperson Ehsan Iqbal described the action as cowardly, and said the government was in a panic over the Opposition plan to resign en masse from the parliament once Musharrafs nomination papers were accepted on September 29.

 They only strengthen our resolve and prove that this is a sham democracy, said Iqbal.

 Once the presidential poll is over, a national election is to be held by mid-January, and pollsters predict the ruling coalition supporting Musharraf will be a heavy loser, forcing him to seek new allies.

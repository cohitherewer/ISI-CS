 More Thai king videos on YouTube

 Bangkok, April 6 (Reuters): Two more clips mocking Thailands revered monarch appeared on YouTube today, a day after the withdrawal of another that had prompted the army-backed government to block the entire video-sharing website.

 One clip, 42 seconds long and titled King of the Apes, was posted by thaifreespeech, showing pictures of King Bhumibol Adulyadej with a monkeys face.

 This VDO would give up to 15 years prison in Thailand because their leaders are evil and hate free speech, said a caption on one of the slides as the Thai national anthem played. The clip had been viewed 7,800 times already and attracted more than 200 comments. Like those on the withdrawn clip, most of the comments on the new pictures urged YouTube to withdraw it from www.youtube.com.

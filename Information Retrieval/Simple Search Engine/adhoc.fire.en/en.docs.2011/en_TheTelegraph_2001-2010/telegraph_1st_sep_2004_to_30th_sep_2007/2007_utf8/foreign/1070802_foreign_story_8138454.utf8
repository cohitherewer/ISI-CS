 Cuba marching ahead without me: Castro

 Havana, Aug. 1 (Reuters): Convalescing Cuban leader Fidel Castro said today that Cuba is marching ahead without him at the helm and gave no indication that he intends to resume office after handing over power a year ago.

 Castro, who will be 81 this month, handed over power to his brother Raul Castro on July 31 last year after emergency bowel surgery and has not appeared in public since.

 I am being bombarded with questions about when I will return to what some call power, he wrote in a column published by the communist party newspaper Granma.

 Raul, the Party, the Government and the mass and social organisations, led by the workers, are marching ahead guided by the unbreakable principle of unity, he said.

 What will I do? Fight on without rest like I did all my life, he wrote.

 Castro, who has been sidelined from power for the first time since his 1959 revolution by an undisclosed illness, said he was being consulted on every important government decision.

 But he said Cubans should be under no illusions about his ideological enemy, the US, negotiating peace with Cuba, qualifying a recent overture made by his brother.

 The struggle must be implacable, against our own deficiencies and against the insolent enemy that tries to take hold of Cuba, he wrote.

 Castro said the Empire was obsessed with turning Cuba into a multi-party democracy.

 Acting President Raul Castro last week extended an olive branch to the US, saying he was open to negotiations when the Bush administration is gone, to end a feud that began after Castros Leftist revolution.

 Castro, the last major Cold War player still around, is said to be recovering from a series of life-threatening intestinal operations.

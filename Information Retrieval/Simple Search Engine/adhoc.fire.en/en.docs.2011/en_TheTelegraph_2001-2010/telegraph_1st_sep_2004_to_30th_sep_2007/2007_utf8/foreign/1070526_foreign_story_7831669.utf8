 US envoys car stoned

 Kathmandu, May 25: US ambassador James Moriarty, a vocal critic of excesses committed by the Maoists, today faced the ire of the groups youth wing.

 Activists of the Young Communist League stoned his car in eastern Nepal while the envoy was returning on a UN vehicle from a Bhutanese refugee camp.

 The league has been gaining notoriety for violence, especially in rural Nepal.

 Moriarty and his co-passengers were unhurt in the stoning, but the UN car was considerably damaged, reports from Damak said. 

 The league cadres held a black flag demonstration and raised slogans condemning the US diplomats recent statements about Maoist excesses. 

 Moriarty had gone to unveil the US resettlement offer to the Bhutanese refugees. The UN high commissioner for refugees, Antonio Guterres, had visited the refugee camp without any problems two days ago. 

 US embassy officials here confirmed the incident, but said they were not sure of the identity of the assailants. However, journalists at the site identified the attackers as members of the league. 

 The attack came hours after the European Union ambassadors to Nepal met Maoist leader Prachanda to express concern over the activities of the league.

 Dictionary hugs a hoodie 

 London, June 4 (Reuters): Hoodies and leaf peepers are among hundreds of new words and phrases included in an updated version of an English dictionary that can be downloaded and accessed by mobile phone for the first time from today.

 Ever since the Conservative Party leader David Cameron told us to hug a hoodie a young person who wears a hooded sweatshirt, regarded by some as a potential hooligan the phrase has become commonplace. 

 Now its usage has been formally recognised in the latest edition of the Collins English Dictionary. 

 Leaf peeper has gained acceptance as describing a tourist who visits New England in autumn to see the changing colours of foliage.

 The new words are intended to provide a reflection of our changing world and its requirements, Collins said. Other new words and phrases include: Barbecue stopper a controversial current-affairs issue or a social gaffe.

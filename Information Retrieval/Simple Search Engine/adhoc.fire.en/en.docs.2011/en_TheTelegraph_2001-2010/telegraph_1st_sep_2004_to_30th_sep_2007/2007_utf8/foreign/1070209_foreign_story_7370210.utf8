 Sunita again goes for walk

 Sunita Williams at the International Space Station

 Cape Canaveral (Florida), Feb. 8 (Reuters): Two astronauts aboard the International Space Station left the outpost today for a spacewalk to pack up blankets and covers no longer needed to keep gear warm.

 It was the third spacewalk in nine days, the most intense work Nasa has ever attempted on the station without a shuttle crew present.

 Nasa astronauts Sunita Williams and Michael Lopez-Alegria opened the stations hatch at 1326 GMT, about half an hour earlier than planned.

 If time allows, the spacewalkers, who were scheduled to stay outside for about six hours, hoped to finish tasks left over from their two previous outings.

 Its a beautiful day, Williams said as she gazed out the open airlock.

 The astronauts plan to pack up shrouds that were needed to keep equipment warm in the deep chill of space. The stations orientation has changed and the covers now may cause the gear to overheat when the sun shines on them.

 Williams and Lopez-Alegria planned to fold up the covers, two of which are bigger than king-sized bedsheets, and toss them away to burn up as they re-enter the Earths atmosphere.

 During the two previous spacewalks, the astronauts hooked up a new cooling system for the $100 billion space station, a multi-nation effort.

 Williams, who was making her fourth spacewalk, now holds a record for the most time spent spacewalking by a woman. Lopez-Alegria is on his ninth spacewalk, which will tie him for the most by a US astronaut.

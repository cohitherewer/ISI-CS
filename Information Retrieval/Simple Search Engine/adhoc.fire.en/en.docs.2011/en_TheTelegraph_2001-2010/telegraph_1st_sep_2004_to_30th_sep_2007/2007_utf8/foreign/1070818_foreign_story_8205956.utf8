 Russia patrols

 Chebarkul (Russia), Aug. 17 (Reuters): President Vladimir Putin said today security threats had forced Russia to revive the Soviet-era practice of sending bomber aircraft on regular patrols beyond its borders.

 Putin said 14 bombers had taken off simultaneously from airfields across Russia early today on long-range missions. We have decided to restore flights by Russian strategic aviation on a permanent basis, Putin said after inspecting joint military exercises with China and four Central Asian states in Russias Ural mountains.

 Today, August 17 at 00:00 hours, 14 strategic bombers took to the air from seven airfields across the country, along with support and refuelling aircraft... From today such patrols will be carried out on a regular basis.

 We hope our partners will treat this with understanding. Many observers said the sorties were a sign of Russias growing assertiveness and ambitions to restore its global reach.

 Western militaries have said Russian long-range flights near their airspace were becoming more frequent after a long quiet period in the 1990s when Russias military was struggling with under-funding.

 One western defence official called the flights a little bit of chest-pounding, trying to let people know Russia is back in the game.

 Space still risky: Sunita

 Houston, June 17 (PTI): With space shuttle Atlantis being cleared for its return to Earth, Indian-American astronaut Sunita Williams today said the problems faced by the shuttle showed that spaceflight is still dangerous.

 We take spaceflight for granted and its still pretty darned dangerous, Williams, set to return to Earth on Thursday after setting a record for the longest uninterrupted space flight by a woman, said at a news conference from space.

 Atlantis was yesterday given clearance to return to Earth next week after its heat shield, which suffered a tear during lift-off last Friday, was repaired by mission specialist Danny Olivas.

 Adding to Nasas concerns was the failure of computers that control the space stations ability to orient itself and produce oxygen. But Nasa officials said the crew was never in danger of running out of oxygen, power or essentials.

 We are living in an environment that is not really friendly for humans.... (the space station is) not just a tourist vacation place. Its a serious place and we are doing serious business and serious science up here, said Williams, 41, who began her space journey on December 10.

 On being congratulated on her record by mission control, Williams said: Its just that Im in the right place at the right time.

 Its just an honour to be up here. Even when the station has little problems, its just a beautiful, wonderful place to live, she said. Asked how she celebrated, Williams said she was too busy. I think I had a couple of wrenches in my hand and thats pretty much how I celebrated.

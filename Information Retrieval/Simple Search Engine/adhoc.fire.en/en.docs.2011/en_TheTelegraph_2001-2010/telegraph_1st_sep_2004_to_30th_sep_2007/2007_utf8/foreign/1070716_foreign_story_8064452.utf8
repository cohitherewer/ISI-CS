 Revealed: Spy Olivier

 Olivier:Building

London, July 15: On screen, he portrayed British military heroes such as Henry V, Lord Nelson and the Duke of Wellington.

 In real life, Laurence Olivier performed some bravery of his own, risking imprisonment and even assassination as an agent for Britain.

 It has been revealed that the celebrated actor, mistakenly accused by some of his contemporaries of lacking patriotism for deciding to remain in Hollywood when war broke out rather than return home and sign up, worked secretly to help secure the hearts and minds of a sceptical America during the early stages of World War II.

 In 1940, having already won fame across the Atlantic by starring in a string of hits that included Wuthering Heights and Rebecca, Olivier was according to a new book secretly enlisted into the Special Operations Executive (SOE) by Lord Lothian, the then British ambassador to Washington, and Sir Alexander Korda, the acclaimed film producer who worked for MI5, the security service. He was recruited on the instructions of Winston Churchill.

 As a well-connected figure, Olivier was given the task of building support in a neutral US for Britains war with Nazi Germany. America did not take kindly to foreign agents, even agents of influence, and could have jailed him, while had the Germans known what he was doing they would have taken any steps to put a stop to it, friends believe.

 Michael Munn, the author of Lord Larry, a new biography that reveals perhaps Oliviers greatest if previously unknown role, said: Winston Churchill recruited Alexander Korda to set up offices in America, which were a front for the SOE and MI5. Korda then recruited Olivier to work on behalf of the SOE.

 Munn, who has written showbusiness biographies of James Stewart, Gregory Peck, John Wayne, Frank Sinatra and others, explained that details of Oliviers work for Electra House (EH), the SOEs propaganda unit named after its London headquarters, were revealed to him by the actors peers.

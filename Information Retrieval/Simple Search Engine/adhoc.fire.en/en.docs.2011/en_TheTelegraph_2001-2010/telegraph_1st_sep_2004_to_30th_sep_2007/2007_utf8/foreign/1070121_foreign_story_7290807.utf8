 Bangla polls

 Dhaka, Jan. 20 (PTI): Uncertainty over Bangladeshs political future deepened as President Iajuddin Ahmed today officially cancelled the January 22 polls as security forces arrested more people, including senior leaders of the two major alliances, in a nationwide crackdown on criminals since the imposition of emergency.

 The President has signed the papers cancelling the January 22 polls, a presidential palace official said here.

 Ahmed said it was not possible to hold elections as per schedule as he had proclaimed a state of emergency after he quit the post of chief adviser last week. The independent election commission also suspended preparations for the polls.

 Security forces arrested a number of senior leaders of both Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party in the southeastern port city of Chittagong. Over a dozen leaders of the student wings of the Awami League and BNP have also been arrested in the past two days. Paramilitary Bangladesh Rifles and the coastguard have been put on high-alert. 

 Experts said the scrapping was essential as difficulties would arise if 19 people, mostly belonging to Zias BNP-led four-party alliance, were elected unopposed in the polls which was boycotted by Sheikh Hasinas Awami-led combine.

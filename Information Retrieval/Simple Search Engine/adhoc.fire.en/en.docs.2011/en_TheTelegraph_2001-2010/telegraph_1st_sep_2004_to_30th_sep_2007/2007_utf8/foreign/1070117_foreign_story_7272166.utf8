 Naomi says she hit maid with phone

 New York, Jan. 16 (AP): Supermodel Naomi Campbell pleaded guilty to misdemeanour assault today for hitting her maid with a cellphone over a pair of missing jeans.

 I threw a cellphone in the apartment. The cellphone hit Anna, Campbell said during her appearance in a Manhattan court. This was an accident because I did not intend to hit her.

 Campbell, 35, was accused of hitting 

 Ana Scolavino in the back of the head with the phone in 

 the models Manhattan apartment last March. Scolavino 

 was treated for a head injury.

 Beverly Hills, Feb. 6 (AP): Talk about a power lunch.

 Clint Eastwood, Leonardo DiCaprio, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Will Smith and Penelope Cruz were just some of the 140 nominees dining yesterday at the 26th annual Oscar Nominees Luncheon.

 There were luminaries all around the International ballroom at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. There are no power tables in this room, academy president Sid Ganis told the crowd, noting the luncheons relentlessly democratic seating process. This is a power room.

 The contenders for the 79th Academy Awards celebrated their elite status together cinematographers and costume designers, screenwriters and song writers, art directors and actors. They drank wine, broke bread, collected their nominee certificates and posed for the annual class photo, all the nominees, side by side.

 Here in this room, all the nominees are equal, Ganis said.

 Everyone congratulated each other as they stood on risers for the class picture and cheered loudly as each ones name was called. 

 Double-nominee Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu, the Mexican director and producer of best-picture nominee Babel, snapped photos of his colleagues with a pocket-sized digital camera. 

 DiCaprio smiled with Scorsese as Melissa Etheridge talked with Spielberg. Peter Toole looked pleased, sitting happily in the front row with his arms around Cruz and former Paramount chief Sherry Lansing, who will receive the academys Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award.

 Helen Mirren chatted with Abigail Breslin, the 10-year-old star of Little Miss Sunshine, who was so small in her chair that her cowboy boots didnt touch the floor. Eddie Murphy, who left the luncheon before the main course was served, offered a modest bow when applause erupted after his name was called. 

 Smith would have won a competition for class cheerleader. He whooped and hollered for each nominee. When his own name was called, he high-fived everyone within a 3-metre radius, then hopped onto the stage and enveloped Ganis in a huge hug. 

 Earlier, Smith told reporters that he was so proud of The Pursuit of Happyness and so thrilled to work with his son Jayden, that he did not need to actually win the Oscar. I swear I dont need an award, he said, a grin lighting up his face. I might pop if I win something.

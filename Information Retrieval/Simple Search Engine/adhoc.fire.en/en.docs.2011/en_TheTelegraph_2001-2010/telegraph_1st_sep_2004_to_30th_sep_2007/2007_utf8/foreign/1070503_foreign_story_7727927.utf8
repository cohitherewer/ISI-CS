 Diamond drink

 Tokyo, May 2 (Reuters): A new era may be stirring in Japan or is that shaking?

 The diamond-tini, a cocktail with a hint of lime and chilled Belvedere vodka over a 1.06-carat stone, is topping the Ritz-Carlton beverage menu at a cool 1.8 million yen ($15,000).

 That price includes drink preparations tableside, a serenade of Diamonds are Forever as a cut stone slides to the martini glass bottom, and later a ring mounting by a local jeweller.

 But for those on a budget, a more modest proposal may be the Ritzs 13,000 yen ($108) wagyu beef hamburger, more than twice as expensive as the hotels main burger and over 40 times as pricey as a McDonalds staple set.

 Soft beer

 Canberra (Reuters): Australians,

 long regarded as a nation of beer drinkers

 rivalled only by the Germans, seem to be turning

 soft, or sober.

 After 113 years, the countrys biggest selling beer, Victoria Bitter, or VB, is to be produced in a mid-strength version to keep pace with the countrys fast-changing beer tastes. 

 Brewer Fosters has decided for the first time to produce the beer in a weaker yellow-label version with 3.5 per cent strength, down from 5 per cent, as Australians abandon it for scores of more upscale boutique or craft beers.

 Eye in sky

 London (Reuters): Spies in the sky may track motorists in Britain within a decade if the UK government goes ahead with plans to introduce road user charging schemes, scientists said on Tuesday. Monitoring would be via a combination of static cameras that would be read by roadside monitoring stations and GPS satellites to read on-board transponders.

 Britney

 San Diego (AP): Britney Spears took the stage at the House of Blues on Tuesday, making what is believed to be her first concert appearance in nearly three years. She appeared onstage in boots, a sparkly pink bra top and a short white skirt with her belly ring out.

 Cambridge (Massachusetts), Feb. 16 (Reuters): Braving freezing weather, actress Scarlett Johansson led a parade of students, including young men dressed in drag, to receive Harvard Universitys irreverent Hasty Pudding Theatricals award yesterday.

 Everything I ever dreamed of when I was a little girl is happening to me right now, Johansson joked as two flamboyantly dressed male members of the theatrical troupe kissed her while she rode down Massachusetts Avenue in a Bentley.

 The troupe named Johansson, who appeared in films like Lost in Translation, its Woman of the Year for her lasting and impressive achievement to the world of entertainment. Actor Ben Stiller, the troupes pick for Man of the Year, will be honoured next week. Both awardees receive a golden pudding pot, a tradition that dates to 1795 when 21 Harvard students pledged that each member of their new club would, in alphabetical order, provide a pot of hasty pudding for every meeting. The annual rite by the amateur acting group, Americas oldest, has for 56 years honoured such stars as Richard Gere, Julia Roberts, Katharine Hepburn and Robert De Niro.

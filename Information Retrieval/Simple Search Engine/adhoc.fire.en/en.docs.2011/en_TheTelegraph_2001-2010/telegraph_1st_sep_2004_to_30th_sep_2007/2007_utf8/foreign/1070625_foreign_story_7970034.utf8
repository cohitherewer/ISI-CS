 Houston, June 24 (AP): Atlantiss seven astronauts reunited with their families a day after the space shuttle capped a two-week mission with a perfect landing in the Mohave Desert in California.

 Sunita Suni Williams was especially happy to return to Earth after spending more than six months at the International Space Station.

 Im not sure what I should say. There are so many to thank, said Williams, her voice breaking with emotion, moments after landing in Texas with the rest of the crew on a Nasa Gulfstream jet yesterday afternoon.

 Im a girl, so Im allowed to do this, she said with a grin as tears welled up in her eyes, and the crowd broke out into frequent applause.

 Williams was joined at the 20-minute ceremony by her husband Michael, her mother Bonnie, sister Dina and Gorby, her Jack Russell Terrier.

 This gravity thing takes a bit getting used to, said the astronaut who has set an endurance record for the longest single space flight by a woman at 195 days, as well as the record for most time spacewalking by a woman.

 Its just the time and the place, said Williams, noting she hopes her mission paves the way for more women to travel to space.

 The crew was assembled on a stage with a giant American flag as the backdrop. Along with Williams were shuttle commander Rick Sturckow, pilot Lee Archambault and mission specialists Patrick Forrester, James Reilly, Steven Swanson and Danny Olivas. Each offered his thanks to family, ground crew and others in brief remarks.

 Williams said she would spend the rest of the weekend getting reacquainted with her husband and dog.

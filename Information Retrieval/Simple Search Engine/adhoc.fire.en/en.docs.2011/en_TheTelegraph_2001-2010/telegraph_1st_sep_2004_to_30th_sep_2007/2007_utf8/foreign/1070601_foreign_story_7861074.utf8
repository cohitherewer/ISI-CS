 Disney hags drawn into ageism debate

 - OLDER PEOPLE SHOWN AS EVIL: STUDY

 The wicked queen from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs

 Even the Seven Dwarfs are guilty, well two of them anyway. Grumpy and Dopey are no longer just the loyal friends of Snow White but must now line up with the likes of the Wicked Queen and Cruella de Vil to be accused of fostering negative images of elderly people.

 According to academics, Walt Disneys seemingly ageist cartoon depiction of older people as evil or incompetent risks adversely influencing children. Grumpy and Dopey join the assorted hags, crones and villains in the dock because they might lead some youngsters to think older people are bad-tempered or dim-witted in real life.

 A study by American researchers at Brigham Young University, Utah, looked at 93 characters who appeared to be aged 55 or older from 34 Disney films going back 70 years.

 A majority of older characters, such as Maurice in Beauty and the Beast or Rafiki in The Lion King, were portrayed as wise or kind, like Pinnochios father Geppetto. But a significant minority were portrayed as unintelligent, nasty, bad-tempered or useless, giving children a bad impression.

 Apart from films set in other cultures, such as Hawaii-based Lilo and Stich, the elderly characters are also stereotyped in terms of race and gender. Two thirds of older characters excluding animals from films ranging from Dumbo to The Aristocats were male; 83 per cent were white.

 A quarter were shown as grumpy, 12 per cent evil or sinister, eight per cent helpless, three per cent senile or crazy and two per cent the object of ridicule. Evil or nasty characters include Madame Mim in The Sword In The Stone, the Wicked Queen as an old hag in Snow White, Smee in Peter Pan and Cruella de Vil in 101 Dalmatians.

 Typical portrayals of elderly people included showing them as toothless, hunched, and with cracking voices. Many were depicted with saggy breasts, the researchers said in an article for the medical publication Journal of Ageing Studies. The academics, who recognised that many Disney creations were based on Brothers Grimm fairytales, added: Some of the films (15 per cent) contained only negative portrayals of older characters, and 71 per cent of the films contained at least one negative portrayal of an older character.

 Britons want Blair exit now

 London, Feb. 4 (Reuters): Most Britons think Prime Minister Tony Blair should step down now, according to an opinion poll published today after a week of damaging headlines for the British premier over an investigation into political funding.

 Blair, who plans to resign later this year after more than a decade in power, was questioned by police for a second time last month about the case which has also seen some of his closest aides arrested.

 Blair said in a speech to activists from his Labour Party yesterday that he did not underestimate the scale of the problems facing his government. 

 The ICM poll published in the Sunday Express newspaper found 56 per cent of those polled believed Blair should resign now. Even among those who termed themselves as Labour voters, 43 per cent said he should leave immediately.

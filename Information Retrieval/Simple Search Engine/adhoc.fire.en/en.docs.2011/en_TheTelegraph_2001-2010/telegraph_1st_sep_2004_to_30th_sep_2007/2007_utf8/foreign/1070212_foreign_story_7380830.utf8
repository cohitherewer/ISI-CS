 Tehran pipes down

 Tehran, Feb. 11 (Reuters): Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad marked the 28th anniversary of Irans revolution today pledging to pursue the countrys nuclear programme but announcing no new atomic work that would have riled the West.

 Ahmadinejad, under pressure at home to tone down speeches his critics say have helped push Iran towards international isolation, said he would keep within international regulations but still ruled out a UN demand to suspend uranium enrichment.

 Iran has until February 21 to halt uranium enrichment, a process that can make fuel for power stations or, if greatly enriched, material for warheads. 

 We are ready for talks but will not suspend our activities, Ahmadinejad told hundreds of thousands of Iranians in Tehrans Azadi square to mark the 1979 Islamic revolution, saying suspension would be humiliation.

 Beckhams get sultry in photo shoot

 New York, July 12 (AP): 

 Victoria and David Beckham, aka Posh and Becks, strip down 

 in steamy photos for the August issue of W magazine.

 They strike a sultry pose for the cover of the issue but things get more seductive in a photo spread inside. Steven Kleins photos show the pair in various states of undress kissing passionately, sunning themselves atop a car and having an intimate moment in the bedroom.

 The 32-year-old soccer star and his wife, Posh Spice of the Spice Girls, will be seen in an NBC special, Victoria Beckham: Coming to America. It follows Beckham, 33, as she prepares to move from Europe to Los Angeles, where her husband will play for the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer. 

 I think people are really going to see me for the first time, Victoria Beckham tells the magazine. 

 I think they have this impression that Im this miserable cow who doesnt smile. But Im actually quite the opposite.

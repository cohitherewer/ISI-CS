 11 killed as plane bursts into flames in Somalia

 Mogadishu, March 23 (Reuters): A plane carrying 11 people burst into flames and crashed in north Mogadishu today during the third day of clashes between rebels and government troops backed by Ethiopian soldiers, officials said.

 Local private radio Shabelle said the plane, a Russian-made Ilyushin used in the area to transport both cargo and troops, was hit by a missile as it took off from Mogadishu. Witnesses could not confirm that.

 I saw the plane on fire ... One of the wings exploded in the air ... When it hit the ground, another explosion occurred, Hassan Mahamud Jama, a resident of the area, said. Columns of smoke billowed up from the wooded area in the outskirts of north Mogadishu where the plane came down, said a Reuters reporter who was near the scene.

 A government source, who asked not to be named, said the plane was an Ilyushin carrying technicians who had been working on another damaged plane at Mogadishu airport belonging to an African Union (AU) peacekeeping force in Somalia.

 AU spokesman Captain Paddy Ankunda said 11 people were on board, but could not say what had caused the crash. Its too early to say if it was hit by a missile or not, he said.

 Insurgents believed to be a mixture of militant Islamists and disgruntled clan militia are striking daily against the government, their Ethiopian allies, and a contingent of 1,200 Ugandan soldiers in the vanguard of the AU force. Analysts and Somali residents fear the growing insurgency could plunge the Horn of Africa nation back into civil war.

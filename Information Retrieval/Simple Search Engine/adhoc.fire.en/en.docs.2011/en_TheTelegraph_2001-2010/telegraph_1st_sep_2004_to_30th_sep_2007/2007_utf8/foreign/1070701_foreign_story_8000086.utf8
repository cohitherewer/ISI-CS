 Hu marks 10 years of HK handover

 Hong Kong, June 30 (Reuters): After a tumultuous decade, Chinese President Hu Jintao marked Hong Kongs 10th anniversary under Beijings rule at the stroke of midnight, amid protests by pro-democracy legislators.

 On a wet day redolent of July 1, 1997, Chinese officials attended a Buddhist bell-chiming ceremony accompanied by chanting monks, to mark the countdown to the moment Britain returned the territory to China after 156 years as a colony, and to bestow peace and prosperity on the territory.

 Earlier in the evening, Hu attended a grand variety show with a distinct Chinese theme. 

 Away from the celebrations though on the other side of Victoria harbour, Hong Kongs 23-strong band of pro-democracy lawmakers staged a stinging rebuke of Chinas rule at midnight on the balcony of the citys historic legislature in Central, re-enacting events of a decade ago.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Less gossip, more questions

 Sir Contrary to what many feel, Kaun Banega Crorepati without Amitabh Bachchan is a flop. Much has been written about Shah Rukh Khans unflattering comments on his predecessor. But the fact remains that the new edition of KBC is nothing more than a chat show by Khan, who prefers to waste time gossiping with the participants. The producers might think that this will help the show get a higher rating. But while 18-20 questions would be asked per episode in the earlier editions, Khan manages to ask 15 or less. On January 30, only 12 questions were asked. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Arpan Bagri, Calcutta

 Watery mess

 Sir I was at the Eden Gardens on February 8, and I have witnessed the sheer incompetence of the richest cricket board in the world. It is amazing that the Board of Control for Cricket in India, which makes millions from sponsors and by selling television rights, cannot spend some of it to buy equipment that will help dry the ground after a spell of rain. It speaks volumes that on the day of an international match one of the two super soppers owned by the Cricket Association of Bengal was lying idle at some ground other than the Eden Gardens. There were about 12 workers mopping the ground with sponges along with one sorry super sopper. We were there at the ground and we could see the casual manner in which the crisis was being handled. I am certain that in Australia or England, the match would have started again in two hours or less. The men at the helm spend hours giving long interviews to the media about their plans, but when it comes to basic administration, they are pathetic. The new chief of the CAB has certainly failed in his first test. 

 Even the administration at the ground was ridiculous. Spectators were not allowed to enter with cigarettes and matchsticks. But there was a stall inside selling only cigarettes and matchsticks. Surprised? But just surprise will not do. People must stand up and ask the board to explain what it is doing with the millions in its coffers. Clearly, it is not spending much of it on improving the infrastructure at the grounds. If it had, then 90,000 people would not have to go back home disappointed, and that too from the best ground in Asia. The media must bring up these questions and make the authorities answer the public. The way the BCCI is managing Indian cricket, the clouds are looking darker than they did at the Eden Gardens on Thursday. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sumit Rungta, Calcutta

 As easy as it gets

 Sir Sanjay Dutt clearly does not have any ground to justify why he should get preferential treatment from the judiciary (Another day to surrender, Feb 8). His counsel, V.R. Manohar, makes a laughing stock of himself and his client when he tries to explain how Dutt was forced to possess a 9 mm pistol and an AK 56 rifle because of the threat to his life. The court will look at the acts committed by Dutt while in possession of the weapons. And if he thinks he is fighting in the name of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, then he must be reminded that Gandhi never possessed, nor felt a need to possess, any weapon but non-violence.

 Yours faithfully,

Purushottam Shrivastava, Calcutta

 Sir It must be said that The Telegraph has not done a fair coverage of events around Sanjay Dutt after he was convicted under the Arms Act. He has just received bail for the fourth time, amidst protests by the relatives of the other accused in the Mumbai blasts case against the courts alleged preferential treatment towards the star. The issue needed more incisive reporting than it has got.

 Yours faithfully,

Avinash Gupta, Bandel

 WAYS TO CATCH THEM YOUNG 

 - Children miss the benefits of Montessori education as 

 they are sent straight to high schools 

 EARLY START

 R.K. Narayan is surely turning 

 in his grave. In his stint as a Rajya Sabha member, Narayan 

 had apparently raised his voice only once. That was to criticize 

 a school system that bends childrens backs with heavy schoolbags 

 rather than exciting their imaginations. And now high schools, 

 especially in West Bengal, would not rest content merely 

 with ensuring that children carry heavy burdens on their 

 back.

 They want to start the process 

 early by catching the children young and young, in this 

 instance, means two-year-olds. Reputed schools like La Martiniere, 

 Modern High, among others in Calcutta, are open to admitting 

 toddlers. And parents, too, seem happy with the present 

 state of affairs. Not without reason. If they can admit 

 their wards to a high school, they can rest in peace for 

 a decade, if not more.

 The arbitrary age of admission 

 to high school has sounded the death knell for Montessori 

 schools. In 2007, Montessori education will complete hundred 

 years. But Montessori schools are not celebrating. Rather, 

 a pall of gloom seems to have descended on these schools, 

 which have, for years, nurtured children by paying them 

 individual attention and honing their creative skills.

 All our efforts seem to be going 

 to waste. Earlier, tiny tots would at least attend Montessori 

 schools for three years. But now they are barely here for 

 eight or nine months, laments Rita Bose, principal of Dishari, 

 a Montessori school in south Calcutta. So we can no longer 

 groom them properly or give them a solid foundation, which 

 is mandatory for any child, she adds.

 West Bengal has always placed 

 a high premium on education. This is evident in the way 

 the infant is taught to speak and recite rhymes almost simultaneously. 

 Parents today start deciding on their offsprings career 

 even before the babies are born. High schools cash on the 

 eagerness of parents to have their wards admitted as soon 

 as the children graduate from crawling to walking.

 Most high schools agree that they 

 would welcome a policy that would specify the age of admission. 

 In the absence of such a rule, and with some schools lowering 

 the admission- age, others are forced to follow suit.

 Things are a trifle better in 

 Delhi. That is because in April 2007, the Delhi Directorate 

 of Education issued a circular stating that a child who 

 has not attained the age of four years shall not be admitted 

 to pre-primary classes.

 But in West Bengal there is no 

 such circular. This is lucrative business for high schools. 

 They can hire a few teachers who barely need to spend a 

 few hours with these toddlers... So it makes good business 

 sense, says a principal of a reputed high school, on condition 

 of anonymity.

 Maria Montessori had once proclaimed, 

 I did not invent a method of education. I simply gave some 

 little children a chance to live. Few in West Bengal seem 

 to realize that children are being denied their right to 

 happiness as they are put under a rigid system of education 

 early in life.

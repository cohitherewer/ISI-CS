 Politics of choice

 Sir At a time when there are justified doubts about the huge public expenditure on the presidential establishment, the media are overdoing the gender perspective following the nomination of Pratibha Patil by the United Progressive Alliance (Sonia second choice gets chance to be first woman President, June 15). While some will consider Patils selection a milestone, one fails to understand how a woman president would in any way change the condition of women in India. It is doubtful whether child marriages, dowry deaths and other means of oppressing women will magically disappear with the election of a woman president. The president is appointed, not really elected. The prime minister and his council of ministers wield real power in our system of parliamentary democracy. Thus, who becomes the next ceremonial head is usually decided by the candidates pliability rather than his or her eminence. 

 Yours faithfully,

Amit Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir It is entertaining, and distressing as well, to find another politician about to take over as the president. No elected representative has bothered to ask the members of his constituency about their choice for the countrys first citizen. It is undemocratic to ignore public opinion, especially when gathering it has become so easy with the internet. In any case, it is unfortunate that the Constitution does not allow a popular vote in this matter.

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan K. Ghose, Calcutta

 Sir The Congress and the Left were bent on a politician as the next president. But a president with a political past invariably tarnishes the image of the position. This choice of politically-inclined presidents is analogous to the practice of giving election tickets to criminals. A president with connections to the party in power gives the Union government of the day a licence to do as it chooses. Therefore, whether it is Pratibha Patil or Bhairon Singh Shekhawat will only decide whether the UPA or the National Democratic Alliance will profit more from the election. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir By nominating Pratibha Patil, Sonia Gandhi has demonstrated her concern for womens representation in the highest offices of the country though she has not managed to get the womens reservation bill passed yet. Patil is certainly a non-controversial choice. However, it is still a pity that a politician is set to occupy Rashtrapati Bhavan once again while various opinion polls and surveys have shown that the people would have liked the apolitical intellectual, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, to stay on. 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir Coalition politics has begun to choose the president of the nation on the basis of the lowest common denominator. A candidate acceptable to all members of an alliance ensures that the best do not get even close to the post. The party or coalition in power does not want a capable and assertive president but rather a rubber stamp. If it is not the minority card, it has to be the gender card. Either way, the UPA has managed to get its rubber stamp well on course to occupying the highest constitutional post in the country. 

 Yours faithfully,

Raghubir Singh, Pune

 Sir It is a pity that unscrupulous politicians and an Italian lady are deciding who will become Indias next president. And we, the people of India, can only helplessly watch the drama. The UPA, as well as the NDA, have altogether disregarded the popular preference for A.P.J. Abdul Kalam to carry on. Perhaps the time has come for the people to demand their right to elect their president. 

 Yours faithfully,

Barun Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir Sonia Gandhi has indeed played a masterstroke by making Pratibha Patil, the Rajasthan governor, the UPAs presidential candidate. The move has stunned the NDA, whose choice, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, now has little hope. Although not a political heavyweight, Patil had a distinguished stint in Maharashtra as an upright and efficient administrator. Her credentials are secular, as she had refused to sign the Rajasthan governments controversial anti-conversion bill. Besides, it is time India had a woman as president. If elected, Patil should convince legislators about the need to pass the womens reservation bill. It remains to be seen though whether Patil can, like A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, earn for herself the distinction of being the peoples president. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

 Sir After nearly two months of tamasha, the UPA has at last chosen its candidate for president. Since coalition politics is here to stay, the Constitution should be amended to allow a member of the ruling outfit to occupy the Rashtrapati Bhavan during that coalitions tenure. This will not only spare us the political machinations associated with the presidential election, but also the chaos and corruption that comes with it.

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Sir In the report Sonia second choice gets chance to be first woman President, Rasheed Kidwai claims that the Congress and the Left came close to a break-up over the presidential nominations. But surely Kidwai did not believe that our so-called leftists would have broken up with the UPA over this? The Left has never had it so good it is enjoying the benefits of being in power without sharing any of its responsibility. Why would they give up this dream job for a petty disagreement over a rubber-stamp candidate? 

 Yours faithfully,

S.B. Gupta, Calcutta

 Unequal halves

 Sir Indian men won the Asia Cup hockey championship, but the girls of Chak De! India were all over the television and newspapers, led proudly by their coach, Shah Rukh Kabir Khan. Of course, we understand the girls provided the glamour that the mens game deserves but never had. But when Jhulan Goswami won the ICC woman player of the year award, journalists did not seek quotes from Rahul Dravids boys none of whom, by the way, had been nominated in any category. Who cares about women cricketers, really unless they have Shah Rukh Khan as coach?

 Yours faithfully,

 Preeti Rawat, Calcutta

 Spirit of the text

 Sir How can the court prescribe that the Shrimad Bhagvad Gita be mandated as the scripture for the entire nation that too in a country constitutionally committed to secularism (Pitch for Gita as national religious text, Sept 12)? S.N. Srivastava, the Allahabad high court judge who is of such an opinion, seems to have mis-read history as well as the Gita. He has also obviously failed to keep pace with the times. 

 Since the comment about the Gita was not part of the ruling but just an observation on Srivastavas part, one may be allowed to air ones observations, which are not accusations at all. 

 Yours faithfully,

M.H. Jowher, Ahmedabad 

 Sir Justice S.N. Srivastava has been reported to have observed that the Gita should be made the national dharma shastra. The Union law minister, as a member of the secular government of the country, has criticized the comment in the light of the existence of texts such as the Quran and Bible, and their importance for different religious communities. But the politician always has minority votes on his mind. It is impossible for a politician like the Union law minister to see the spirit behind the comment of the judge. 

 I am reminded of the elucidation of dharma by Justice Srikrishna while delivering the second V.M. Tarkunde Memorial Lecture recently. He said that the word dharma within the Indian context does not exclusively pertain to religion. It also encompasses within itself the notions of truth, justice, morality, ethics and conscience. Most of the politicians, and also the people of India are ignorant of the full contents of the Gita. A thorough reading of the text might throw new light on the suggestion made by Srivastava. In any case, the Gita is a far better text to follow than the 123 agreement or the Hyde Act. 

 Yours faithfully,

T.S. Gopalakrishnan, Chennai 

 Parting shot

 Sir It was Mohun Bagan that defeated Mohun Bagan (against East Bengal) in the semi-finals of the Federation Cup in Ludhiana. The East Bengal coach, Subrata Bhattacharya, goalkeeper Subrata Pal, forward Dipendu Biswas the stars of the day all left Mohun Bagan some time back after being treated shabbily. Football is a sport that is characterized by players changing camp every now and then. But the circumstances in which these three switched over to East Bengal speak volumes of the maladies in Mohun Bagan clubs administration. The self-serving individuals entrusted with the running of the Mohun Bagan club deserve no more than such defeats no matter how hard they try to design a revenge by recruiting East Bengals discarded coach, Carlos Pereira, to coach their team. A few disgruntled members and supporters of Mohun Bagan had founded the East Bengal club in 1920. The tradition seems to have continued through the decades. Let us hope that the Mohun Bagan rejects help East Bengal lift the Federation Cup. 

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Letters to Editor

 Too much, too soon

 Sir It is sickening to hear that a doctor supposedly allowed his 15-year-old son to perform a Caesarean operation in a hospital he owns (Probe into boy surgery, CD missing, June 22). This parental action was in utter disregard for the safety of the mother and the still-unborn child. The Union health ministry has rightly observed that the surgery, if it really happened, not only violated medical ethics but also endangered two human lives. If Dileepans parents made him perform the operation just to get his name in the Guinness Book of World Records, then their action was all the more criminal. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Sayan Bhattacharya, 

 Calcutta

 Sir The licences of doctor parents, K. Murugesan and Gandhimathi, should be cancelled forthwith and the couple prosecuted (Boy surgery shocker, June 21). The passion for entering the Guinness Book is an unfortunate development in Indias social pathology. It was only the other day that the nation was shocked by the Budhia Singh episode. Although the 15-year-old Dileepan Rajs operation was successful, Murugesans ambition for his son does not augur well for a country where maternal and infant mortality continues to be a persistent problem. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 A.S. Mehta, 

 Calcutta

 Sir In order to gain cheap and fast publicity, Indian parents are violating every code of responsible social conduct. Those like K. Murugesan and Gandhimathi do not realize that what they do is often not only illegal but also damaging to their children. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 A.K. Ghosh, 

 Calcutta

 Sir The Indian Medical Association is right in clarifying that the Medical Council of India cannot punish the errant doctor couple without evidence of their misconduct. K. Murugesan, however, seems to have destroyed the compact disc he had shown at an IMA meeting to impress the medical fraternity with his sons feat. On the other hand, without a complaint from the patients family, it is not possible to file a first information report. Therefore, the IMA must probe the family and the local doctors who had supposedly seen Murugesans CD. After all, the patients family was probably not informed that a 15-year old would perform the Caesarean surgery. Evidence and testimonies gathered from all the people involved in some way or the other should then be used to build the case, if there is one, against Murugesan and his wife. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 K.G. Menon, 

 Madurai

 One more hurdle

 Sir IISCO acquired land in Purushottampur in 1989, but did not embark on expansion for 18 long years owing to a fund crunch (Clash for land and jobs, June 18). If the company was not in a position to invest money in expansion at the time of acquisition, why did it acquire the land in the first place? This proves that IISCO has no idea about fiscal management. Has anyone ever heard of someone buying long-distance train or air tickets for a vacation without arranging for the holiday expenses? 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Asoke C. Banerjee, 

 Calcutta

 Sir It is inhuman to detain parents in jail while their children are allowed to face the horrors of political violence (Night of terror for kids, June 19). The violence over land acquisition in Singur, Nandigram, and now, in Purushottampur is a complicated affair. There are allegations that while the IISCO steel plant paid Rs 13 lakh per acre to the government, the villagers have been offered only Rs 5.6 lakh per acre. 

 In a number of states, land has been sold to industrialists at rates much higher than what farmers received for the same measure of land. This naturally prompted agitations for more money. Continued hindrance to land acquisition and related troubles hint at a major lopsidedness in the industrial policy being followed by the West Bengal government.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Shiv Shanker Almal, 

 Calcutta

 Sir Whether West Bengal can survive as a viable economic unit, in a highly competitive national environment without industrialization is too big a question to be decided by the government alone. Educated citizens in general, and the intelligentsia in particular, are expected to put their weight behind industrialization and persuade the government and the opposition to sort out the problems related to acquisition of land. However, while none of our intellectuals deny that industrialization is a must for the state, they all invariably argue at cross-purposes. This weakens Bengals resolve to overcome obstacles and achieve what is an imperative for the state. In the present context, the fact that land was acquired in Purushottampur 18 years ago seems to have been overlooked by the critics of industrialization. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 H.P. Gangopadhyay, 

 Calcutta

 Erratum

 In Pathik Guhas book review, The agony of accepting the limits to knowledge (June 22), Einsteins unsuccessful battles with...Niels Bohr have been mistakenly referred to as his successful battles. The error is regretted.

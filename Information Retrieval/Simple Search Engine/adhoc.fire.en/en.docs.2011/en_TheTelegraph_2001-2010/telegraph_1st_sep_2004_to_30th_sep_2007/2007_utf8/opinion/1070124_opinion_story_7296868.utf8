 Back with a bang

 Sir Sourav Ganguly has made a spectacular return to one-day international cricket (Sourav pulls off cracker of a comeback; TV trips, Jan 22). In Nagpur, against the West Indies, Ganguly shone with his bat, scoring his runs at a breathtaking pace. Cricket-lovers in general and Gangulys fans in particular would be happy to see a prolific batsman get back into the groove successfully, after being kept out of the team. After months in the cricketing wilderness, Ganguly would not have found it easy to play such a majestic innings. But the former captain proved to be more than equal to the challenge. His successful return to test cricket in South Africa and, now, an even more dramatic return to the one-day team, should silence his detractors once and for all. Moreover, Gangulys showing in the first match against the West Indies proves that Kiran More and Greg Chappell had not done the right thing by dropping him from the team. Nevertheless, Ganguly will be better off if he puts the unpleasant past behind him and focuses on the World Cup, which is round the corner. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir One could not have asked for a better comeback for Sourav Ganguly. A long absence from the national team, months of neglect and anxiety and then a blistering 98 runs off 109 balls are the stuff of cricketing legends. But what should not be overlooked is the fact that Ganguly contributed significantly to Indias victory against the West Indies. It was the start given to the Indian innings by Ganguly and Gautam Gambhir that helped the later batsmen put up a huge total. 

 After Gangulys fantastic performance in Nagpur, one feels tempted to ask the Indian coach, Greg Chappell, whether he still has any doubt about Gangulys class and if he intends to keep the former skipper on the waiting list for the World Cup.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir With Sourav Ganguly emerging as the top-scorer in the test series in South Africa and then scoring a brilliant 98 against the West Indies, there is no doubt that Ganguly will make it to the squad for the World Cup in the West Indies. Gangulys flamboyant return proves that he is a determined soul. It also shows that he is still a useful player, who can pull his team out of a mess. It is surprising that months of criticism from all and sundry did not break this player. His performance, both in South Africa and against the West Indies at home, confirms that the chief selector, Dilip Vengsarkar, was right in picking Ganguly for the team, despite the apprehensions on the part of Greg Chappell. Vengsarkar must be thanked for undoing the harm that Kiran More and company had done. Hopefully, Ganguly will improve with time and also take care of his characteristically poor running-between-the-wickets. 

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir Sourav Gangulys knock of 98 must have come as a slap on the face of Kiran More. His innings should go down in cricketing history as one of the most remarkable comebacks to the game. Ganguly has shown that nothing is impossible if one is determined and patient. Aspiring cricketers in India should look up to this player as they have a lot to learn from him. But Gangulys fans should acknowledge that his 16-month exile was a blessing in disguise. Gangulys stint outside international cricket has undoubtedly helped him rediscover himself as a cricketer. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Hope reborn

 Sir It is heartening to note that Hillary Rodham Clinton is running for the post of the US president (Hillary joins race for presidency Jan 21). One hopes that she will get elected so that the policy of unilateral dominance adopted by George W. Bush and his men finally comes to an end. Whether or not Bush has been personally responsible for the death and distruction in Iraq, he is answerable for some of the decisions that were taken during his term in office. Bush must also take the blame for the lawlessness and the ceaseless violence in Iraq. 

 Hillary Clinton seems to possess all the skills that are required to become the president of the most powerful country on earth. Besides, her approach to numerous issues of international and domestic concern appears to more democratic than that of Bush. Hillary is likely to face a tough challenge from other contenders among Democrats while filing her nomination for the presidency. However, she must know that a lot of people around the world would like to see her in the White House. 

 Yours faithfully,

Nandini Saraf, Calcutta

 Sir While announcing her de- cision to contest for the presidency, former first lady, Hillary Clinton had expressed her desire to discuss means of bringing the Iraq war to an end. Although Hillary herself had voted for the war and did not criticize the invasion per se, her criticism of the Bush administrations subsequent bungling in Iraq and her willingness to wrap up the chapter show that the war is becoming unpopular with the people of America. However, if Hillary does manage to become the countrys first woman president, it remains to be seen whether she continues to adopt a hard stance in Asia and in Latin America like her predecessor. 

 Yours faithfully,

M.K. Anwar, Calcutta

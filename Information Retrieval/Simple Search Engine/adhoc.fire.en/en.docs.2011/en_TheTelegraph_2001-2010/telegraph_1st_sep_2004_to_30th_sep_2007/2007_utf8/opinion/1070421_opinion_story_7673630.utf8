 DIFFERENT STROKES

 Visual Arts

 Ripe Green at Nakshatra gallery (ended on April 15) was an exhibition of paintings by seven artists trained at Kala Bhavan, Santiniketan. The young artists are trying to express themselves freely. But their works seem to have remained in the experimental stage. Jayanta Roys paintings were full of gimcrack. The landscapes of Biman Das reminded one of hill stations. The emotive impact of the scene remained in unspoilt. Gautam Khamru was the star performer. His works depicted, by the superb use of colourful mixed media, fierce animals and cattle. The affinity with the murals in the Himalayan monasteries was obvious. 

 Rajesh Deb and Jayanta Kumar Paul quoted images from Benodebehari and Rabindranath respectively. These went well with the subconscious organization of their visuals. Paramita Chakravorty used a cluster of opposite images in each painting. There were owls, a planet and characters in limbo, which created an exuberant fantasy. Pappu Bardhan did not seem to have got rid of his memory of the classroom. His black and white drawing of a constable controlling traffic with a light indicator seemed rather illustrative. 

 In Void, his acrylic on canvas, the skyline of a nocturnal city was accentuated by dangling traffic lights above the horizon. The three-quarter profile of a young man below the line did not integrate with the total composition.

 GROWTH OF A HYBRID CULTURE

 Malvika Singh

 MALA FIDE

 When a language is brutalized, its usage and spoken words distorted and mutilated, the culture of that language undergoes a trauma. This is what is happening with the English language in India. A strange breed of imitative Western culture, rootless and anarchic in our social context, is growing like a weed across this land. For some odd reason, success in contemporary India is symbolized by the traditional being abandoned and replaced by the worst, most pedestrian end of Western culture. When Indians in the towns and cities of this land ape everything phoren because that makes them believe they have arrived, they do it carelessly, much like the manner in which they use and speak the language, English.

 Some obvious, everyday examples would elicit this rapidly growing phenomenon. Thaalis, far more practical than china for our kind of cuisine, are being discarded for plastic plates, merely because they are plates patterned with pink roses and other such motifs that resemble, in some far fetched way, the fine bone china of the raj! Metal glasses that were healthy to drink from and often rather beautifully engraved, have been put away into trunks and inferior glass tumblers have invaded urban and rural homes. I often find people at dinner parties eating their chapatis with a knife and fork. Divans and daybeds, indigenous to our culture, have given way to plastic chairs that are lined up along the four walls of the room, making communication stilted and uncomfortable.

 With these and similar other elements intruding into homes, whose inmates feel inherently awkward about using those new bits of furniture, the gracious quality of living and the aesthetic sensibility that made India special have nearly disappeared. Our strengths are getting diluted. The tried and tested materials and methods of construction, of design, are vanishing and a strange and sterile phase of living has overwhelmed us. The erosion of our culture is manifest in this unattractive and ugly effort to be modern.

 Odd and graceless

 The strong sense of pride and innate confidence Indians once felt have diminished and insecurity has set in. Yet, Greece, Italy and Spain not only nurtured their traditional skills and sensibilities but also absorbed them into their modernizing efforts. Their use of building materials, motifs, colour, style are indigenous to their cultural traditions and, therefore, most appealing to the rest of the world. India was once the most celebrated and confident amongst these old cultures. Why have we cast aside and rejected our in-built strengths? Why have we forgotten how to lead and influence?

 Another example. Young Indian women in male attire look odd and graceless. To see them strut about in business suits when the temperature is anywhere between 35 and 40 degrees Centigrade, is a trifle absurd. Cold countries demand that kind of dressing. Short skirts and dresses, that we in our time referred to as frocks, look equally absurd. Indian women just do not look good in Western attire.

 This may well have to do with the way their body is structured as well as their rather unique facial features and pigmentation that do not fit the style. That is probably why none of those young women get married in frocks or trouser suits! Deep down they know they are caricatures of something alien. It is akin to a Western women wearing a sari they are awkward with the length, embarrassed with the choli, they tend to hold the sari above the ankle as though preparing for the floods and, when they move, gliding grace gives way to the gait of a camel.

 Mother tongues have been swept under the carpet and a curious new dialect of English is the language of a new India that is neither Indian nor Western. It is a hybrid, quick-growing variety!

 BEAUTY THAT VANISHES 

 Neha Sahay

 China Diary

 Beijings skyline is dotted with 

 cranes and many of its streets are littered with rubble 

 as demolitions and new constructions go on endlessly for 

 the Olympics, scheduled for August 2008. Hutongs, the tree-lined 

 lanes in which lie the traditional grey courtyard-style 

 dwellings of the old city, have been the worst hit, despite 

 heritage activists including members of Chinas top political 

 advisory body crying hoarse about their architectural 

 and historical value. Just a fortnight ago, demolition of 

 a 700-year-old hutong began amid protests, with one woman 

 shouting to the demolition squad: You are demolishing Beijings 

 face. We Beijing residents have no face. In the last four 

 years, two hutong residents have killed themselves to protest 

 the demolitions.

 The demolition halted after a 

 day because the Beijing cultural heritage administration 

 asked the city authorities to stop it. This hutong was declared 

 a protected site in 1999. However, it is the citys district 

 administration that has allowed the demolition to make way 

 for a residential complex, and it seem inclined to go ahead 

 with it.

 Beijings authorities obviously 

 prefer profit over heritage, but it is strange they dont 

 realize that it makes economic sense to let the hutongs 

 be. They are among Beijings prime tourist attractions. 

 Many expats have chosen to live in hutongs rather than in 

 the citys high rises. Its not just that the ancient designs 

 on the doors, the courtyards and the peaceful avenues attract 

 tourists. Hutong-owners have cleverly converted many of 

 their street-facing rooms into restaurants, bars and curio 

 shops, catering to foreign tastes and wallets. One such 

 bar sold Indian perfumed oil, the creamiest chocolate mousse, 

 Earl Grey tea and samosas, at rates only those spending 

 euros and dollars could afford.

 Flavour of the day

 However, not all hutong residents 

 are happy with the ogling tourists going from courtyard 

 to courtyard on cycles and cycle-rickshaws. Nor are they 

 happy with the obvious state of disrepair of their houses. 

 But they want the authorities to repair, not demolish them, 

 so that they can live there comfortably and also lease them 

 out to offices and restaurants. New Beijing, Olympic Beijing, 

 the slogan visible all across the city, does not enjoy their 

 support. What of Beijings history, they ask. Monuments 

 cannot be the only reminder of the city that has existed 

 as a capital city since 473 BC. How will our children know 

 what life was like here, they ask.

 But demolition is the flavour 

 of the day. The latest to go down is the historic Qianmen 

 Street, said to be the commercial and cultural heart of 

 Old Beijing. It will be made into a walking street, where 

 only trams will ply. While some of its landmarks will also 

 be rebuilt, there will be many casualties. Among them will 

 be Beijings oldest Opera Theatre, over 300 years old, but 

 now considered unsafe. Many of the small snack-shops here, 

 some of them 200-300 years old, may also not find a place 

 in the new street. In fact, this year, knowing that the 

 street will be closed from May onwards, Beijingers were 

 queuing up in front of these old shops in such large numbers 

 that the latter just couldnt cope with the rush. This street 

 also has the oldest outlet of the Quanjude roast duck restaurants, 

 famous throughout China. Its walls are lined with black 

 and white pictures of Mao and Zhou En Lai dining with foreign 

 dignitaries. In the Qianmen outlet, the fire under its oven 

 has reportedly not been extinguished since 1864.

 It is said that no visit to Beijing 

 is complete without a stop at any of the Quanjude restaurants. 

 However, Indians craving to try out its delectable fare 

 should know that many of its outlets close early at 10 

 pm, just the hour at which an Indian would set out to enjoy 

 a meal in the capital of the worlds fastest growing economy.

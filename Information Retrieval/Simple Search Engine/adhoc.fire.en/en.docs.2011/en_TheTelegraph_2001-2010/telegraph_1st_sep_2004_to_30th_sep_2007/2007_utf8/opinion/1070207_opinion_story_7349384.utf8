 Atheists faith

 Sir A sense of humiliation (Feb 2), was occasioned by Ashok Mitras sorrow and despondency over the bhoomi puja at the site of the Tata small car project in Singur. In fact, Mitras response was long overdue, coming as it does from someone with a long history of involvement with the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Most old faithfuls of the party, as Mitra says ...look up to the Left Front government in West Bengal as the repository of secular ideals; they pin their faith on it to act as vanguard in the relentless fight against the fundamentalists and religious obscurantists. These men have watched with anguish the changes that have taken place in the party. The local cadre of the CPI(M) are now actively involved in committees organizing Durga Pujas across the state. Instead of upholding secular ideals, the left, it seems, has gradually moved closer to a soft Hindutva position over the years. It is surprising that Mitra could register this downslide only after the bhoomi puja in Singur. If the truth be told, the left parties in India are an opportunistic lot. They justify the accommodation of religion within party ideals in the name of protecting minority rights. Today, it seems that the left is more interested in securing its votebanks than in upholding the ideology of the party. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir It is astonishing that Mitra would brush aside pressing concerns like those involving the compensation and proper rehabilitation of displaced farmers in Singur to focus on the bhoomi puja as a sign of the lefts defection from secular ideals. The CPI(M), in West Bengal, has shown that it is a poor practitioner of the populist ideals it preaches. This is borne out by the fact that the party gave Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the chief minister, the permission to acquire agricultural land from poor farmers to help capitalists set up a factory in Singur. 

 Mitra has also been surprised by the fact that the Tatas, who are parsis by faith, opted for a Hindu ritual to mark the beginning of their unpopular project. It matters little whether the bhoomi puja is a Hindu or a Muslim ceremony. What is more important is the fact that poor farmers in Bengal are losing their land in the name of development. Besides, the bhoomi puja is no more a specifically Hindu ritual as it is observed by adherents of almost all faiths at the start of a project.

 Sir While it is true that religion needs to be kept out of politics, Ashok Mitra s secularist zeal seems to be triggered off by perceived favours to Hindu beliefs only. He remains strangely silent on the favours granted to other religious groups by the Congress party, which now heads a coalition gove- rnment. The haj subsidy awarded to the minority community can be cited as a perfect example in this context.

 Women, interrupted

 Sir The report Village elders chop lovers (Feb 2), was a chilling reminder of the dark practices that continue to thrive even in post-globalized, modern India. It is shocking to see village elders hacking a girl and her lover to death just because the couple were from the same clan. The incident shows that educational programmes organized by the government have failed to make their mark in the rural areas. The situation is all the more depressing as most of these murders are carried out on the panchayats orders. In states like Uttar Pradesh, the village panchayats enjoy absolute power and the state agencies like the police hardly interfere with their decisions. The people who pass such sentences continue to believe that it is honourable for the community to eliminate a woman who had the temerity to choose her lover. If the government does not take steps to stop such medieval practices, then India cannot lay claim to the epithet of a progressive nation. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir After reading about the fate that befell Gudiya and her lover, one realized that prejudices still dog rural India even in the twenty-first century. It seems that women are always victims of such honour killings. The disadvantaged position of women in society makes them easy targets of men. As a result, panchayat members, most of whom are men, get away with murdering women in the name of honour. Earlier, a woman from Meerut was denied a chance to voice her own opinion. The panchayat decided on her behalf which of her husbands she should live with, a ruling that might have played an important role in her untimely death. In Gudiyas case, the panchayat was responsible for her death more directly. Mahesh, Gudiyas lover, was also killed along with her. This shows that even men can become victims of our hallowed traditions.

 Yours faithfully,

Soma Datta, Siliguri

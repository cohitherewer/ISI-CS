 FALLING IN LINE

 For a coalition government, staying on depends on its partners staying together. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) is relieved that its partners have decided not to leave the government in Bengal. On their part, the partners too must be feeling vindicated that they have been able to restrain the Big Brother. The self-gratification in both camps should, however, end there. For, the truce between the CPI(M) and its allies is little more than a matter of political expediency. To expect it to help improve governance in Bengal will be unrealistic. Small things may change though. The CPI(M) may avoid riding roughshod over the partners as it had been used to doing. The chief minister, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, will probably consult his cabinet colleagues from other parties more frequently than he has done so far. The Left Front committee will meet more often than before. The sum of all this, however, may not necessarily be a better political style or, more important, a better government. No matter what the theory of the united front prescribes, the big difference in strength between the CPI(M) and its partners condemns the front to, practically, one-party domination. That is why the smaller partners complaint of being ignored by the CPI(M) is as old as the front. 

 The irony is that governance may actually suffer if the front tries to act in a truly collective fashion. The current crisis in the front is a reflection of the gap between Mr Bhattacharjees ideas of rapid-fire development and the partners inability and unwillingness to keep pace with it. The Forward Bloc, the Communist Party of India or the Revolutionary Socialist Party does not share the CPI(M)s enthusiasm for Bengals industrialization. These parties seem to be much slower than the Marxists in readjusting their strategies in a fast-changing economic scenario. And, they have lost nothing of their old love for populist policies. Add to this their tendency to work as a ginger group within the front. There is thus a very real danger of the partners using the front in order to rein in Mr Bhattacharjee. The tragedy at Nandigram and the governments abysmal failures there will henceforth make him far more susceptible to pressures from the partners. If the CPI(M) now faces a new challenge of practising the coalition dharma, the chief minister has a bigger one of saving his government from the front.

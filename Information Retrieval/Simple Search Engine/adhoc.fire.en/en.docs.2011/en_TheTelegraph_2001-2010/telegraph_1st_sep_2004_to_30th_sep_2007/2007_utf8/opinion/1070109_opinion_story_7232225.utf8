 Going down without a fight

 Sir Indias meek capitulation to South Africa in the third test has disappointed cricket fans in the country. The spineless batting display in the second innings raises doubts about the ability of some of our players who have been touted as world class batsmen. If Indian cricketers continue to play like this, the country may end up at the bottom of the ranking table in both forms of the game. 

 However, the batting was not the only area of concern as far as India was concerned. Shoddy fielding has been the bane of many Indian sides and Rahul Dravids team was no exception. When the Springboks were in trouble, the visitors left them off the hook by conceding extra runs on the field. And the less said about some of the senior players, the better. Take Virender Sehwag, for instance. If Sourav Ganguly could be dropped and Irfan Pathan sent back home due to poor form, how is it that Sehwag managed to find a place in the Indian team in this particular match? Moreover, the manner in which Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid batted in the second innings showed that the Indians had no intentions of going for a win. Otherwise, the two senior batsmen would have shown a little more interest in scoring quickly. Even if they were batting to save the match, Dravid and Tendulkar should have ensured that they hung around till the close of play on the fourth day so that the Indians take a sizeable lead. 

 Perhaps, it would be a good idea if the selectors allow Indian players to play domestic cricket in Australia. This would help them imbibe the qualities that have made Australia the dominant force in world cricket. Instead of allowing the players to play county cricket in England, the selectors would do well to to send Indian cricketers to Australia to play with the best in the business. In fact, the cricket board should think of appointing John Buchanan as Indias cricket coach. Such a move would brighten Indias chances in the World Cup in the West Indies.The Indian selectors also need to look at a players performance in domestic cricket more carefully. Selection to the national team can only be considered if a player scores a certain number of runs or takes a minimum number of wickets. Runs saved on the field or the number of catches taken should also be considered as important benchmarks for selection. 

 The board should think of linking a players performance to his payment as well. It should discourage players from taking part in advertisements. Indeed, some tough decisions need to be taken if India is to become a force to reckon with in international cricket. Otherwise,it will be time to write the obituary of Indian cricket pretty soon. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Some of the decisions taken by the Indian team management came as a shock during the final test match against South Africa. Why was Virender Sehwag sent out to open the innings despite his indifferent form? After all, Dinesh Karthick and Wasim Jaffer had put up a decent opening stand in the first innings. If Mohinder Amarnath, and not Greg Chappell, was coaching the side, he would have certainly not changed the opening combination in the second innings. Matches are won with the help of cricketing logic, which seems to be in short supply in the Indian dressing room at the moment.

 Sir South Africas victory in Capetown did not come as a surprise. In fact, some of the decisions taken by the Indians contributed to the defeat. It was strange that the captain and the coach decided to change a successful opening pair and send an out-of-form Sehwag to open the batting in the second innings. This was a blunder that cost India the match and the series. Hopefully, after the disastrous tour in South Africa, the board will be willing to take some hard decisions. Sehwag should be dropped and youngsters like Suresh Raina and Venugopal Rao given another opportunity to prove their mettle. If India is to build a team for the future, even superstars like Tendulkar and Ganguly should be asked to hang up their boots at the earliest. But is anyone willing to bell these old cats?

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir So near yet so far. This seems to be the only expression that can be used to explain Indias outing in South Africa. India started the test series with a dramatic victory in Johannesburg. But the team could not repeat its performance, surrendering the lead, and, ultimately, losing the three-match series. It is doubtful whether India will get a better opportunity to beat South Africa in its own backyard again. The only positive aspect from Indias point of view is the performance of some its young fast bowlers who troubled the South African batsmen with their pace and guile.

 Yours faithfully,

Partha S. Chatterjee, Andul

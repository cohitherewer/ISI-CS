 Letters to Editor

 Guided by the stars

 Sir Khushwant Singhs article, Unbelievable, but true (Mar 3), shows that a believers faith in astrology remains unshaken, even though it has been proved that such a belief system borders on the illogic. School, college and university education has failed to raise doubts in the minds of believers, who have blinkers strapped on their eyes by astrologers and conmen. One suspects that upbringing has a lot to do with the development of such an unquestioning attitude. A child generally follows its parents in the way it thinks and acquires ideas. Only a very strong personality, developed later in life, can free ones mind from the shackles of inherited beliefs. 

 This, unfortunately, is a rare occurrence. Most Indians continue to believe in astrology and find nothing wrong in visiting temples to rid their would-be daughters-in-law of the manglik curse or to cure themselves of physical ailments. Their faith in the stars remains firmly in place, even though Pluto has been booted out of the planet family.

 Sir In Unbelievable, but true, Khushwant Singh criticizes the superstitious Indian in his inimitable style. Astrologers take advantage of such irrationality and the peoples unflinching faith in astrology to become affluent and socially influential. This shameful trend continues to rise, despite the progress in science and technology. It is not as if higher education removes this evil. Professors as well as managing directors of large firms sporting stones to ward off evil are a dime a dozen in India.

 Yours faithfully,

 Second class citizens

 Sir While the Union ministry for women and child development is busy celebrating yet another International Womens Day, the parliament, dominated by male politicians, continues to sit on the womens reservation bill. Even some Islamic countries such as Pakistan have opted for womens reservation in the legislature. Perhaps, womens reservation in the Indian parliament should be based on the model that has been successfully adopted in many municipal and local-bodies. The Congress chief, Sonia Gandhi, has reportedly admitted that the bill has not been passed due to the opposition of some politicians such as Lalu Prasad, Dayanidhi Maran and Anbumani Ramadoss. Significantly, those opposing the womens reservation bill happen to be some of the biggest supporters of reservations for marginalized communities such as dalits and other backward classes. Indian politicians do not have the right to deny women this privilege. The left parties should feel duty-bound to convince their friends in the government to extend their support towards the passage of this bill at the earliest.

 Sir While it is true that the position of women has improved all across the world , there is still a lot more that needs to be done for women living in poor countries. The persistence of hunger and poverty in India, as also in other parts of the world, is largely due to the subjugation, marginalization and disempowerment of women. India has a long history of activism for womens welfare. Some of these movements have also focused on securing economic rights for women. The government too has launched several programmes to increase economic opportunities for women. 

 Yet, in our country, women continue to be discriminated against, both socially and culturally. They suffer from hunger and poverty in greater numbers and to a greater degree than men. Traditionally, women bear the primary responsibility for the well-being of their families. In most households, they run the kitchen, take care of their children and their education, and, on some occasions, go out to work in order to contribute to the family income. Yet, they are often denied the access to critical resources such as education, healthcare services and job training. 

 The Indian constitution may have granted women equal rights with men, but strong patriarchal traditions persist in many parts of the country. Womens lives in this land are shaped by customs that are centuries old. In most Indian families, a daughter is viewed as a liability while sons are idolized and celebrated. As a result, most Indian women are conditioned to believe that they are inferior and subordinate to the menfolk. Hence, the need of the hour is to recognize the fact that women are no less capable than men and that they must be treated on an equal footing. This will go a long way in alleviating the misery of countless women in this country. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Parting shot

 Sir An article appeared on the front page of The Telegraph entitled Adopted son killed by dad (Feb 27). A detailed report of the same story also appears in the Metro section. What we found disturbing in this article is that the word adopted has been used several times. We would like to point out that such repeated use of the word adopted is irrelevant and perhaps draws the readers attention away from the real problem the fact of murder. 

 This article can give rise to wrong notions of intention of a foster parent and cause immense mental agony to those children who are coming to terms with their adopted status. We are sure that had this unfortunate incident taken place in a family with biological parents, the adjective biological would not have appeared even once, just as the word, biological child, did not appear in the series of articles which reported how a young 13-year-old boy was fatally beaten up by his father for poor performance in a sports event. We also feel that this particular story reinforces conventional stereotypes about the practice of adoption. In reality, adopted children are often completely and happily integrated into families.

 Yours faithfully,

 Geeta Roy,

 Letters to Editor

 Wanted, a fair deal

Unfair world

 Sir Some of the letters that appeared on August 1 talk about the torment that women continue to suffer to this day. However, the problem of gender-specific harassment has to be tackled at the roots. To begin with, one could challenge the perceptions about the girl child being a liability. Such perceptions are upheld by advertising campaigns such as those of life insurance companies, which offer schemes to parents for bearing the expenses of their daughters marriage and sons education. Why is it that the daughters marriage worries parents so much, whereas spending on the sons education is seen as an investment? Why is there never an equal emphasis on the daughters education? The tradition of girls changing their surnames after marriage is also an illogical practice. The tendency to take women as dispensable and ever willing to make sacrifices must change for the discrimination against women to stop.

 Yours faithfully,

Anita Bhuin, Calcutta

 Sir Although the case of Sunita Rajput being tortured and made to undergo six abortions by her husband is not a singular incident, this does not take away from the heinous nature of the crime (Son-struck Mother India, July 29). Such crimes against women happen all over India but often go unreported. The judiciary must give exemplary punishment to Sunitas husband, Rajesh, to put the fear of law into men who abuse their wives.

 Yours faithfully,

 nSir The relentless practice of female foeticide and infanticide is a matter of great concern and dismay. Despite the steps taken towards womens empowerment, Indian families still prefer sons to daughters. What is shocking is that the malpractice of killing or abandoning baby girls is no longer restricted to the rural illiterate. Pooja Salot is a case in point (Another Pooja in justice cry, July 26). She was married into an affluent and presumably educated Gujarati family in Ahmedabad, but was forced by her in-laws to undergo abortion twice, after illegal sex determination tests showed that she had conceived girls. Thankfully, the government has woken up to the problem and has floated the idea of registering all pregnancies. But stricter laws must be implemented to prevent sex determination and thereby foeticide. 

 Yours faithfully,

Farzaan Z. Khan, Pune

 Sir Sons moving out of their homes after marriage and daughters being killed before birth are fallouts of the gender-biased approach of the society towards our children. It is important that we learn to treat our sons and daughters as individuals and give them equal opportunities of growth.

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

 Bring on the industries

 Sir Amartya Sens views on land acquisition in Singur reflect the realities of the market economy and the dynamics of industrialization (Prohibiting the use of agricultural land for industries is ultimately self-defeating, July 23). There are valid reasons behind the choice of Singur as the site for the Tata Motors small-car project. Industry has always developed near urban areas, as it needs supporting infrastructure. Those self-proclaimed samaritans of the poor who had cried themselves hoarse at the West Bengal governments de-industrialization policies and inability to attract investments into the state are now opposing the governments attempt at creating an industrial hub. Such a turnaround appears to be politically motivated.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir It is unlikely that the present campaigners of capitalism in West Bengal have initiated industrialization in the state with an informed sense of West Bengals industrial past. The important thing to decide at this juncture is whether Bengal should tread the path to economic progress by embracing industrialization or whether it should remain content with being a less developed state. Amartya Sen has emphasized that economic progress is difficult without industrialization and that agrarian economies across the world have welcomed industry for development. Moreover, agricultural produce will not be affected if 1 lakh acres of arable land is acquired for industry. The case for industry is strong also in terms of employment-generation there is far more scope for it in the industrial sector than in the agrarian. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bisakha Sen, Calcutta

 Sir It is important to make a success out of Singur in order to send positive signals to international investors and ensure that the perception of West Bengal being hostile to development is rectified. Amartya Sen is correct in pointing out that the proximity of an industrial zone to an urban area is essential for greater connectivity and convenience.

 Yours faithfully,

Rajib Poddar, Calcutta

 Sir It is shocking that some readers have criticized Amartya Sens views on industrialization while overlooking the problem of disguised unemployment, which is a major flaw of our agrarian economy. This is a problem that can only be solved through greater employment-generation, which is possible through industrialization. Another point in favour of industry in West Bengal is that it will stop the migration of workers to other states. However, industry should be encouraged together with steps to modernize agriculture.

 Yours faithfully,

Swati Guha, Calcutta

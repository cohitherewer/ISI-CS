The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Birth of a nation 

 In INDIA REMEMBERED (Pavilion, Rs 1,495), Pamela Mountbatten recollects the tumultuous 18 months she spent in India with her parents prior to, and immediately after, the transfer of power in August 1947. Her intermittent and brief diary entries during the time are elaborated with detailed notes which, despite being written almost six decades later, do not take away much from the blitheness of the seventeen-year-old diary-writer. Borrowing liberally from her parents writings and collection of photographs, Pamela pieces together a thoroughly enjoyable personal history of the period. On the top left is Gandhi taking goat curd, his first ever meal at the Viceroys house, followed below (anti-clockwise) by pictures of the Mountbattens at riot-torn Lahore and on the expedition to Narkenda. On the top right is the farewell party for the staff before the Mountbattens departure.

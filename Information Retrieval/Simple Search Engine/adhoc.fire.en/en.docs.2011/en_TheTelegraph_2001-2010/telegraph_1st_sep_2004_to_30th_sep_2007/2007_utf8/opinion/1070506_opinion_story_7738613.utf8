 DAMAGE CONTROL

 Mankind has sinned against nature. This was irrefutably proved earlier this year by the first part of the latest assessment report of the United Nations intergovernmental panel on climate change. Having established how human activity has been singularly responsible for environmental degradation and what its consequences could be, the penultimate part of the study delineates the possible ways of averting the apocalypse. It sets before the world a grand target of eight years to reduce greenhouse emission, the key to climate change mitigation. A few months ago, a report put together by Nicholas Stern, a distinguished development economist, had similarly concluded that what is done within the next decade may have little effect on the climate in the next 50 years, but could substantially improve the environment and climate in the second half of this century.

 The expert advice on the environment has, evidently, shifted from the previous premise of too little, too late to never too late to begin. Both the Stern report and the IPCCs fourth assessment report lay emphasis on starting the process of recovery immediately, before it is too late. While the Stern review laid out in clear economic terms the cost of procrastination, the IPCC reports trace, in immense detail, the social costs nations have to bear if they fail to initiate changes. And they place the onus of responsibility for setting the ball rolling as much on the developed world as the developing nations.

 The thrust, therefore, is clearly on taking the debate out of the groove that the Kyoto Protocol has fallen into. The developed world versus the developing world debate has allowed the United States of America, the worlds most significant polluter, to stay away from committing itself to any international regulation, and the highly-polluting industrializing nations like China and India to perpetually avert responsibility. This has not only made the worlds first legally-binding treaty a non-starter, but also thwarted all serious attempts at conservation of the environment. It is only natural that the report, which is supposed to steer discussions towards a replacement of the Kyoto agreement, should be pragmatic in its assessment.

 The IPCC report puts together a number of medium- and long-term measures to keep global temperatures under control. They involve conversion to renewable energy sources, efficient fuel use, improved technology in building and industry, and better water and crop management. None of this will happen without individual governments waking up to their responsibilities. Nor will the long-term plan work without actual changes in consumption patterns and life-style, which again would depend on education and public awareness. But most important of all, the efforts have to be coordinated and collective, both at the levels of indi- viduals and governments, and shorn of hypocrisy.

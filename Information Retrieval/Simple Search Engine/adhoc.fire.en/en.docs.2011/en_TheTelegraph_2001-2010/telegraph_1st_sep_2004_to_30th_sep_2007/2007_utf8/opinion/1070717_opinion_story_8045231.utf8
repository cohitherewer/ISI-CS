The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Gandhi and the skull of the Little 

 Picked Whale 

 To whom do the Gandhi manuscript and 

 other such objects belong, and why? asks Aveek Sen

 The Greek culture minister during the 

 repatriation of an Apollo from Switzerland, June 2007

For a few days in its journey 

 from a private mansion in Lausanne to the India House in 

 London, the draft of an article handwritten and signed by 

 the Mahatma suddenly became of paramount importance to Indian 

 nationhood. It had been picked up by Albin Schram, an Austrian 

 banker living in Switzerland, a compulsive collector of 

 famous peoples letters and manuscripts. Schram had stashed 

 it away in a filing cabinet in the laundry room of his Swiss 

 residence, together with some thousand letters by the likes 

 of Elizabeth I, Napoleon, Beethoven, Tolstoy and Wittgenstein. 

 After Schrams death, his executors put part of the collection 

 up for auction at Christies. And that is when the Indian 

 government suddenly sat up to the Gandhi MS, which could 

 have fetched anything between 9,000 and 12,000. This was 

 going to be its third sale, all of them public and legal, 

 but the first one to attract Indias attention. 

 The ministry of culture and of 

 external affairs buzzed into action, spurred on by select 

 Gandhians. The Indian high commission was asked to negotiate 

 with Christies, who first resisted the move and tried to 

 put India in its place, and then, quite suddenly, communicated 

 Schrams executors decision to withdraw the MS from the 

 sale. It now awaits the passage back to India, to become 

 part of that monument to brittleness and oblivion the 

 nations archives. Meanwhile, another lot of documents in 

 Gandhis hand was auctioned at Sothebys and went to a private 

 buyer without the Indian political establishment batting 

 an eyelid. So the sudden desire to possess, and have back 

 in the country, the Schram MS is quite arbitrary and entirely 

 symbolic a fit of archive fever.

 The repatriation of artefacts 

 and cultural objects raises crucial questions regarding 

 their nature, value, location and proprietorship. Whom do 

 they belong to, and why? And these questions lead to the 

 fundamental relationships that determine the meanings and 

 identities of these objects. How are things paper and 

 ink, marble, canvas and paint identified with persons 

 and places? What role do nations their governments, museums, 

 archives, universities, libraries and ordinary citizens 

 play in the making of these identities, meanings and values, 

 these journeys across borders and between continents?

 Artworks and cultural objects 

 (everything from manuscripts to shrunken heads) are things 

 whose existence is defined by a kind of dual citizenship. 

 They belong, at once, to all of mankind and to nations or 

 similar collectivities, which, in turn, are linked to specific 

 places. One can speak, therefore, of both national heritage 

 and world heritage. Whom does the Taj belong to, for instance? 

 In order to answer that question fully, we also have to 

 ask, What is the Taj: just a building in a city 

 in a country or an object of universal wonder? or What 

 do you mean by belong? Does the building belong to India, 

 and its beauty to everybody who looks at it? And this leads 

 to the question, Why do foreigners have to pay so much 

 more than Indians to have a look at it? And what about foreigners 

 who look like Indians?

 This nation-vs-world dichotomy 

 is complicated by another kind of doubleness in the value 

 of artefacts. For these are objects whose worth is both 

 tangible and intangible; they come with a price as well 

 as a value. The price is determined in an open market, a 

 potentially lawless and increasingly borderless place, whereas 

 the value is determined by other, more exalted, criteria 

 that seek to wish away the presence of the market, to turn 

 the object from expensive to inestimable. And this value 

 could be because of either the aesthetic or the historic 

 quality, Beauty or Truth. 

 For a brief while, the Gandhi 

 document had also got caught in these dualisms. In Schrams 

 filing cabinet, Gandhis draft article inhabited a different 

 kind of universe, a republic of letters that seemed to 

 transcend national boundaries and historical periods, rubbing 

 shoulders with French conquerors, Russian poets, Argentine 

 authors, German philosophers and Italian sculptors. Access 

 to these is determined solely by buying power, irrespective 

 of nationality. But the moment the document got picked up 

 by the Indian government, it came to inhabit a different 

 kind of space, and took on another kind of value. It became 

 identified with the Father of the Nation, and therefore 

 the nation had to have it back. In the process, the document 

 turned into a token.

 This kind of transvaluation brings 

 three things in its wake. First, buying and selling, questions 

 of money and price, suddenly begin to sound ugly. The original 

 collector, and by association Christies, begin to look 

 like entities in a dubiously acquisitive nexus, from which 

 a righteous nation must rescue its treasure, thereby also 

 undoing years of colonial looting. Second, the question 

 of place where the document should be kept becomes vitally 

 political. If the Gandhi draft must go back to India, mustnt 

 the Keats holographs go back from Harvard to Hampstead, 

 the Maori heads from Oxford to New Zealand, the Elgin Marbles 

 from London to Athens? And go back, not because these countries 

 can keep them and look after them better, but because of 

 the simple fact of national proprietorship. (Does an Indian 

 miniature painting remain Indian at the Victoria and Albert 

 Museum in London?)

 Third, the moment a document turns 

 into a token and its value becomes intangible, its keepers 

 can get away with neglecting its material existence. The 

 inestimable is imperishable: it neednt be looked after 

 any more.

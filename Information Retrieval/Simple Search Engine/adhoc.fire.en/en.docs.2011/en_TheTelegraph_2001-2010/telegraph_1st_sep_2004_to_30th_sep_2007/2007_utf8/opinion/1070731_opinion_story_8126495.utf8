 FRIENDS IN DEED

 Consistency has never been a virtue for Indian communists. Saying one thing and doing another come as easily to them as changing faces and strategies with every change of scene. What is politically correct at Nandigram in Bengal, therefore, becomes something very different at Khammam in Andhra Pradesh. It is impossible to miss the irony in the demand made by the leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Sitaram Yechuri, for the resignation of the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, Y.S.R. Reddy, over the death of eight farmers in last weekends police firing at Khammam. The irony is not merely in the fact that more farmers had died in the police firing at Nandigram in March. Worse still, five months after the tragedy, the government of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has not ordered an inquiry, let alone punish the guilty. Mr Reddy has not only ordered a probe but also suspended some senior police officials responsible for the bloodshed at Khammam. The CPI(M)s doublespeak would make it look as if the deaths of the Left-supporting farmers are more tragic than those of others even if they took place under similar circumstances. The deaths at Nandigram and the Bengal governments failure there leave the CPI(M) with no moral right to demand Mr Reddys resignation. The party has done at Khammam what Mamata Banerjee has been doing with the Nandigram tragedy using the deaths for cynical politics. 

 The irony apart, the CPI(M)s doublespeak makes for slippery policy prescriptions. Both Khammam and Nandigram raise questions about the use of land for development. Ostensibly, the partys agitation in Andhra Pradesh is aimed at forcing the government to distribute land to the landless. But Nandigram erupted into violence because Mr Bhattacharjee wanted to take away land from the farmers there in order to set up new industrial projects. Between them, Khammam and Nandigram hold the mirror up to the partys duplicity and its dilemma over approaches to economic development. Unfortunately, the CPI(M)s contradictions are no longer the partys internal matter. The United Progressive Alliance governments dependence on Left support makes the latters strategies a matter of national consequence. The Left may have its Marxian illusions about the value of dialectics. But confused friends can be worse than enemies for the UPA government.

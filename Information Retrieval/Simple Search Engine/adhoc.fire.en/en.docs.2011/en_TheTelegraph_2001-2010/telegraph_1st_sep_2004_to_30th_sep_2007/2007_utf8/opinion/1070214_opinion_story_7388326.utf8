The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 STARTING POINT

 Indias parliamentarians like to hear what they already know and to keep their ears shut to anything they do not want to know. The observations of the second administrative reforms commission on how the abuse of power is proving to be a bane of Indian democracy will not be news to them. However, its recommendations, which are not too pleasant, may fall on deaf ears. If the trajectory of the lok pal bill in the house is kept in mind, this suspicion may not appear to be unfounded. Despite its noble intention of curbing corruption in the highest places, the bill is still languishing in parliament. And the reason why the recommended rashtriya lokayukta may never get appointed is not different from the reason behind the lok pals problematic birth. The administrative reforms commission trips on the same problem-spot by keeping the prime minister out of the scope of the lokayuktas inquiry. It talks of risking political instability if the position of the head of government is made vulnerable by a review. The fear speaks of an illogic unexpected of a commission that has otherwise so clearly delineated the cause for the dismal functioning of the system. The prime minister, being primus inter pares with respect to his cabinet colleagues, cannot be made to stand outside a rule that applies equally to the rest. In fact, as the head of the executive, he is accountable for the breach of trust by any member of his government. A functioning democracy cannot encourage blind faith in an individual, more so in a political person. 

 The commission touches on many sore points while providing the antidote to corruption. Its attempts to censure defectors from a ruling coalition and stop the misuse of local area development funds will raise a storm. So will its emphasis on the need for a national judicial council, which has, so far been successfully staved off by a touchy judiciary. The axe, if any, may fall on the bureaucracy, especially since political leaders are unlikely to be the sitting ducks for reformists. Civil servants have lately found themselves compromised by the receding immunity from judicial review. The commissions directive to hit out at those who collude against state interests may make them further vulnerable. But given the spread of the nexus of the corrupt, the job of assuring good governance may turn out to be more difficult than it appears on paper.

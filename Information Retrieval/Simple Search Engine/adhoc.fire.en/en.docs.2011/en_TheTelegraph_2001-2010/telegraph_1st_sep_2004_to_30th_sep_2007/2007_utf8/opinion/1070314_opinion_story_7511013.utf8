 Letters to Editor

 Murder most foul

 Sir It initially appeared that the Jharkhand legislator, Sunil Mahto, had been killed by Maoists for openly opposing their ideology (Maoists in Holi mask murder MP, Mar 5). Investigations have proved that this is only partially true. The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha shared a close relationship with the Maoists, often seeking their help in elections. It is possible that Mahto resented his partys silent pact with the rebels. However, he too must have benefitted from such an arrangement. Unfortunately, for reasons not fully known, Mahto had fallen foul of the Maoists. His case is perhaps an exception. The nexus must be working fine in the case of several of his colleagues in his own state, and for other political parties and leaders in other states. It is this unholy alliance that is responsible for the spread of the Maoist threat throughout the country. 

 The editorial, Blunder kills (March 6), prescribes two ways to deal with the threat by improving the military strategy and by alleviating poverty within the Maoist strongholds. But the immediate precautionary measure to take is to enhance and assure the security of all members of parliament. The pre-emptive action should go beyond this since the threat is not restricted to VIPs. The United Progressive Alliance government, however, is yet to bolster internal security. Unless it acts fast, the government will lose its credibility.

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir The recent killing of Sunil Mahto raises doubts about the fate of the six-year-old state of Jharkhand. The state, with its enormous mineral wealth, poses a threat to the neighbouring states in the matter of attracting investment. The latter could be trying to foment trouble. However, those witnessed the states genesis first hand believe that the people of the state have been unable to deal with its newfound status. Which is why, the state has failed to optimize its mineral resources and to prevent a set of greedy politicians from coming to power. The result is unlimited pilferage of minerals and illegal mining, which has made millionaires out of paupers. 

 After every episode of political killing or unrest, the state government pledges to tighten security. But these are empty promises. Anarchy reigns supreme once the hullabaloo dies down. Hopefully, a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation will make a difference this time.

 Yours faithfully,

Papia Chatterjee, Noamundi

 Sir The assassination clearly indicates that the Naxalite insurgency is out of control. There is an urgent need to get to the core of the problem. This could begin by bringing the Naxalites to the discussion table. Counter-violence will only strengthen their resolve to wreak havoc on civilized society, with total disregard for democratic norms. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad 

 Sir Why was Sunil Mahto not provided adequate security, given that he was actively voicing his protest against the Maoist menace in Jharkhand? His death is a defeat for the law and order agencies. This assassination will deter other political leaders from coming forward to combat terror. The very fact that the Maoists have no concrete proposal to present to the government shows that they are a misdirected lot. They are happy with the mindless violence they are unleashing on the common people. Far from bettering the socio-economic conditions of the poor, which is supposed to be the prime motive of their movement, they are busy making money through extortion. This is an extraordinary law and order problem that requires extraordinary laws. Witnesses will never come forward if ordinary laws are applied against the Maoists. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir The recent incident in Jharkhand is a cause for grave concern, particularly for other ministers and MPs. Sunil Mahto was clearly being foolhardy when he decided not to inform the local police station about his visit to the football tournament. He trusted his bodyguards, who lacked the basic training to deal with such situations. Mahto, by his very act of attending the football tournament, held in the memory of Santosh Mahto, the Nagrik Suraksha Samity leader killed by Maoists, must have enraged the rebels. There must have been other reasons why he invited their wrath. This however does not take away the fact that those in need of security today lack adequate protection.

 Yours faithfully,

Jayantabishnu Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir Jyoti Malhotras article, Renkoji pot simmers (March 11), talks about the UPA governments indecision about the ashes of Subhas Chandra Bose, kept at the Renkoji Temple in Tokyo. Though the external affairs minister, Pranab Mukherjee, has ordered for a DNA test of the ashes, one suspects that the government will try to fabricate the test results. Its aim would be to affirm that the ashes belonged to Bose, irrespective of the fact that reports of several commissions contradict the claim. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Bharatiya Janata Party must ensure that no such thing happens. There should be at least two more medical investigations, independent of the one conducted by the government. If these ashes really belong to the freedom fighter, why have these not been brought back to India? Obviously, there is much more than that which meets the eye. Half a century has passed after Boses death. It is time India knew the truth. 

 Yours faithfully,

J.K. Dutt, Calcutta

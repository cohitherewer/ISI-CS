 BUDS IN A DEAD CITY

 A day after Hiroshima Day, Uddalak Mukherjee remembers his visit to the Peace Memorial Museum with one of the survivors

 Keiko Aguna watched her father build a bomb shelter. The old man had dug a deep pit behind the house and was now covering the opening with soft earth and bushes. It was the sixth of August, 1945, and Hiroshima was shimmering in the humid summer. Although it was early morning, the little girl knew that it would be another long, hot day. She felt listless, irritated, even a little angry. Her father had told her not to go to school that day. The war had changed her father, she felt; and he looked older and tired these days.

 Keiko listened to the scraping sounds made by her fathers spade. Then she heard something else a low humming noise in the air. She looked up at the sky, but there was no plane in sight. Moments later, Keiko saw a blue-white light tear across the horizon. The sky darkened, the ground shook, and a strong wind rose. She watched the sky change colour from blue-white to yellow, and then to a deep red. There was a putrid smell in the air, and it had become unbearably hot. She knew that something terrible had happened and began to run up the hill next to her house. Beyond the hill lay Hiroshima, a city she had known for years. When she reached the top, she stopped and looked towards the city. Before her lay a flat, burning landscape, with its buildings and bridges reduced to rubble. A thick column of smoke rose towards the sky, and the wind brought peoples screams to her ears. She could see the ocean too; it appeared to have crept closer. Keiko stood still and watched the burning city by the sea. Even as she watched, a black rain began to fall.

 She did not know then what had happened in Hiroshima that August morning. A few days later, she learnt the truth from her father. An American B-29 aircraft had dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, killing approximately 140,000 people. The B-29 was called Enola Gay. Keiko came to know that even the atomic bomb had a name. It was called Little Boy.

 Keiko Aguna is one of the hibakusha, as survivors of the atomic explosion are known in Japan. A small woman, she now works as a peace activist and a tour guide at the Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshimas Nakajima district. Keiko was telling me her story as we sat in a caf near the museum. We had agreed to meet after lunch, so that she could take me around the museum. Inside, tourists sat smoking cigarettes and chatting over coffee. Some children were playing pool in a corner. The atmosphere was relaxed, even cheerful. But then, there were Keikos stories of the day a city died. 

 Afterwards, we walked towards the museum and stood in the queue to buy tickets. On entering, Keiko pointed to the famous Peace Clock, which recorded the number of days that have passed since the last nuclear test anywhere in the world. I noticed that the figure on the electronic clock read 222 days. In another room, there was a white marble plaque, with a peace slogan etched on the stone. A group of solemn-faced American tourists stood in front of it, while their Japanese guide clicked pictures at a furious pace. We made our way past them and headed for the first floor. There were many exhibits there, including some rare pictures. One photograph, taken hours after the explosion, shows a group of people queuing up to buy medicine in front of a burnt-out clinic. On another wall hung two other photographs of Hiroshima, before and after the bombing. The first image was that of a bustling, beautiful city. In the second, one could only see an empty, scorched land the ghost of a city.

 Some of the other items on display included a lunchbox containing blackened rice, torn slippers, fraying, grey military uniforms, even locks of burnt, matted hair. Military documents, war reports and newspaper clippings have also been carefully preserved in the museums archives. There were simulated sequences of the bombing and its aftermath, which could be viewed on giant, flat screens. The silent, flickering images were a testimony to an unspeakable horror. 

 On the second floor, Keiko showed me a panel containing letters of protest that the mayor of Hiroshima had dispatched to the premiers of countries possessing nuclear weapons. I looked at the letters closely and after a quick, careful search, discovered the note that had been written to the Indian prime minister after the nuclear tests in Pokhran. 

 As we moved from one room to another, Keiko spoke about her life as a survivor. The hibakusha, she told me, had put up with immense suffering. In the years after the War, there were no known methods to treat their medical conditions, which had been brought about by exposure to radiation. Worse, a large section of Japanese society shunned the survivors, fearing contagion. Research into the after-effects of the bombing was suppressed during the years of military occupation by America and its allies. A silence slowly descended on the hibakusha. Unable to talk about their rights or demand an equal life, the survivors became a forgotten people.

 Hiroshimas story is not only about war and human suffering. The city is also a symbol of courage and survival. Sitting on a bench near the A-Bomb Dome a looming, skeletal structure, which is now on the Unescos heritage list Keiko recounted a curiously moving incident. Immediately after the bombing, it was rumoured that no vegetation would grow in Hiroshima for the next seventy-five years. Yet, in the spring of 46, Keiko remembers seeing the first flower-buds sprouting in the citys gardens. 

 By that time, people had started to rebuild their lives, and the city was recovering slowly. Then, after years of silence, men and women who had survived the bomb began to speak, and to speak up. For some, like Keiko, it was difficult to revisit the horror that lay in a corner of their mind. But they knew that this was the only way to tell the world what nuclear weapons can do to human lives, and how important it is to eliminate them. These voices gathered strength, forcing the national government to enact laws that enabled survivors to seek welfare and medical aid. 

 Today, Keiko is in the forefront of a movement that is fighting to rid the world of its nuclear arsenal. As an activist, she has met victims of nuclear tests in different countries. Her journeys have taught Keiko that these survivors have no nationality. They are a people simply united in suffering. 

 A few years back, American peace activists had invited Keiko on a lecture tour. In America, she visited a museum in Washington where she saw the Enola Gay. The aircraft, the prized possession of a victorious nation, stood in an enclosure, its dark body gleaming in the light. Seeing the plane, Keiko had stopped in her steps. Then, she had sat down and cried.

 After the visit, I thanked Keiko for her time and asked her whether she felt that she had done enough. She answered that she still had a lot to do, and there was so little time. Then she turned, bowed and began to walk towards the exit in the failing light.

 Killing by any other name

 Toe the line, or else

Sir The Nandigram genocide could have been avoided if the senior police officers who ordered indiscriminate firing were from West Bengal. The trigger-happy policemen from other parts of the country failed to read the pulse of the unhappy but innocent villagers of Nandigram. The ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) government is good at training its cadre, but nowhere near as good in sensitizing its senior policemen. It is also unimaginable that the two members sent to the Rajya Sabha from the state recently have never had much to do with Bengal. The Left Front partners, too, are little more than meek followers of the CPI(M) who consider their job done after making a few perfunctory statements. After the bloodbath, it is strange that a person from outside Bengal has been entrusted with the CID enquiry. Keshpur, Chhoto Angaria, Nanur, Singur and now Nandigram who knows what is coming next?

 Yours faithfully,

Tusar Kanti Kar, Howrah

 Sir Nandigram has taught us how difficult it is to convince the poor villagers that what is good for the urban affluent class is somehow good for them too. It has also exposed, yet again, the propensity of Bengalis to attempt complex tasks without proper groundwork. The events of the last few months have also shown that a peoples party, after enjoying a prolonged, unchallenged stint in power, loses contact with its base and starts depending on state machinery. We have also seen how a callous, marginalized opposition tries to get back into the limelight. But are we also watching: how the feed-hungry 24-hour visual media fan conflicts to flashpoints?

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Sen Sarma, Calcutta

 Sir The West Bengal government has suddenly woken up to the fact that a parallel probe is required into the Nandigram genocide. Accordingly, the Criminal Investigation Department of the state police has been entrusted with the job. This is like asking a rapist to investigate his own crime and submit an impartial report. The move to rope in the CID is a clear ploy of the state government to distract the Central Bureau of Investigation officials and tamper with the evidence. The CBI should in no way share its findings with the CID if it is serious about getting to the bottom of things. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his party, yesterdays preachers of socialism, must understand that rampant industrialization and forcible land-grabbing are only going to help an American-style corporatization, destroying economies, cultures and civilizations. In order to regain the peoples confidence, the chief minister must condemn the violence and give justice to the villagers. 

 This is not to condone the politics of convenience being played by the opposition parties, or the vacillating roles of Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh. I express my solidarity with those who are still fighting for human rights, dignity and democracy in the old-fashioned upright Bengali way.

 Yours faithfully,

Partha Banerjee, New York

 Sir Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has proved that a man can kill people with a gun in one hand and a flower and Brecht in the other. Rudrangshu Mukherjee has rightly pointed out that the people, by electing the chief minister and his party, did not give them the license to kill innocent people. Bhattacharjee wanted to take a short-cut to put Bengal in the forefront of the countrys economic map (Red terror, March 18). His means lack humility and dedication. The intellectuals of Bengal misread him and extended their blind support something many of them now regret. After Nandigram, Bhattacharjee must be cursing the democratic system of the country, which keeps putting obstacles in his way. He has the potential to become a Narendra Modi.

 Yours faithfully,

Amitava Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir I watched Sitaram Yechury react to the Nandigram killings on an English news channel, and I was shocked to see how shamelessly he tried to cover up for the action of the police administration of a state ruled by his party. He was trying to convince viewers that the Maoists, and not the CPI(M)s cadre and police, have killed people in Nandigram. While Yechury talked, a waiter stood beside him with a plate full of samosas, to be served to him. The scene made me feel sick. While it is well-known that politicians try to score political points even over the death innocent people, Yechurys behaviour was unacceptable. Nandigram also brings out the double standards of the Indian communists who do not hesitate to take to the streets over the smallest hike in the prices of fuel or foodgrains, but turn their faces away when innocent villagers are killed. 

 Yours faithfully,

Dharam Agarwal, Barbil, Orissa

 Sir I was sad to see that Sonia Gandhi, the Congress president, could not make time for Nandigram even after the bloodbath there. In the past, she has visited Kalinganagar in Orissa, where tribal people were killed in police firing while resisting the acquisition of their land. Where is her famed inner voice, which had once prompted her to spurn the prime ministers chair? Perhaps political compulsions speak louder.

 Yours faithfully,

G.K. Bhagat, Calcutta

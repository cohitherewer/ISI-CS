The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 AGAINST NATURE

 Nobody expects the mayor of Calcutta to be more powerful than the combined forces of geography and the weather. But civilization demands that figures of civic authority like him, in their public statements, express at least a ritual compassion for the continuing travails of their fellow citizens. The cavalier briskness with which the mayor has denied all responsibility for the paralysis (and even loss) of life resulting from the rains in Greater Calcutta is in questionable taste. People are still coping with the waterlogging, lack of electricity and drinking water, together with the unpredictable and often fatal dangers that come with the waterlogging, days after it has stopped raining. To ask such people to compare Calcuttas fate with that of other Indian and foreign cities in order to accept the naturalness of it all, is to refuse to confront the uncomfortable details of the particular situation in this city. It is to deny, with a high-handed disdain for accountability, the extent to which the municipal authorities could still be held responsible for this repeated annual distress.

 The maintenance and extension of the citys late-19th-century sewerage system is not something that could happen, as it were, in the natural course of things. The entire process has to be planned, implemented and monitored in a concerted manner by the human agencies who have been entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring Calcuttas development as a city. Drains, sewers, pumping houses and pumps have to be looked after, built, and technologically updated. All that is perfectly within the realms of the possible, and has been known to yield perceptible results. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has, at regular intervals, announced ambitious and expensive projects of this nature, all of which, since as long as one can remember, always set long-term targets, and most of which seldom show any signs of being carried through or monitored. Also, most deaths during the rains are caused by electrocution from loose overhead wiring or open manholes that are not properly signposted. Both are avoidable and involve rudimentary maintenance that is up to the mayors men to ensure. Building expensive roads in such a way that they cannot be drained properly without causing a huge upheaval is another avoidable practice. What is questionable about the mayors latest statement is not just its humanity, but also its claim to truth.

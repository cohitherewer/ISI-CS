 ROADS TO PEACE AND FREEDOM

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the report of the UN secretary-general, August, 2006

 The United Nations is also a network of capacities. Some of these, such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations Development Programme, play central roles in economic and institutional reconstruction; while others, such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Food Programme and the Unicef, play vital roles in humanitarian and social recovery.

 The UN is also a source of operational capacities. The deployment of such capacities particularly in the form of peacekeeping operations, which are now routinely structured to integrate within them all of the various aspects of UN operational engagement has proved vital to helping parties overcome their divisions, provide a secure space within which they can resolve tensions and serves as a channel for resources for the rehabilitation of State and social infrastructure.

 Bringing all of these roles together has been a major challenge in the past decade. But it is precisely this role that the Peacebuilding Commission was established to play. By creating a forum that links the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and the Security Council; by bringing a wider range of states, especially regional actors and the major financial and troop contributors, into the deliberations of the Security Council; by creating a body with an interest in long-term, sustained engagement beyond the normal period of a peacekeeping operation; by creating a forum in which the UN system as a whole, including the international financial institutions, can meet with a core set of the most engaged member states; and, most importantly, by creating a platform for national authorities to set out their own vision and their own priorities for reconstruction in all of these ways, the establishment of the PBC holds the promise of more effective, more reliable peace-building results.

 The PBC has been slow to start and has yet to show its full promise. But good things take time, and we should not be discouraged by the fact that this new body is still trying to find effective ways of working. The creation of a Peacebuilding Support Office and the establishment of a Peacebuilding Fund will add critical tools to its repertoire. Over the next decade, I anticipate that the PBC will be at the core of the work of the UN and the international community in peacebuilding rightly recognized by the 2005 World Summit as a vital role for the organization.

 The threat of terrorism to international peace, security and development has taken on new importance during the past 10 years. Consequently, the international community has taken a number of important steps to provide a solid legal basis for common actions against terrorism, including the adoption of 13 universal instruments and their protocols and amendments, the latest of which the Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism was opened for signature during the World Summit in September 2005. In the Millennium Declaration, world leaders resolved to take concerted action against international terrorism. At the World Summit, they strongly condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, committed by whomever, wherever and for whatever purposes. I trust that the conclusion of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism will be forthcoming.

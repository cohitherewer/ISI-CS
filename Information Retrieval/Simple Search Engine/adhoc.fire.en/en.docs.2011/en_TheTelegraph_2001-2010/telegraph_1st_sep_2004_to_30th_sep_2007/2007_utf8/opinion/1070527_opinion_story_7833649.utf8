The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 Hair today, gone tomorrow? 

 If APJ Abdul Kalam goes, and if a very enterprising man from Hyderabad has his way, Rashtrapati Bhavan will not miss a spectacular hairstyle. Anand Khare sports abundant soot-black shoulder-length hair that spreads out stiffly from his head looking suspiciously like a wig, and a matching black beard. He has a wild array of degrees, which include BE Hons. India, Msc Wales, PhD Engineering England, Dlit California and LLD California. As he stares from his website in a flamboyant polka-dotted jacket and tie, we are also told he is a huge combo: a novelist, poet, engineer, scientist, industrialist, economist and specialist in socio-political jurisprudence. And he has a wife, with whom he is offering himself as a package. Dr Anand Khare and Ranu Khare have flooded the post-boxes of everyone who matters in Lutyens Delhi with their nomination papers for president and vice-president. The hubby will be president, the wife will serve in the office below. She has apparently been nominated for the Nobel in literature. What if the Khares win over 50 MPs and MLAs to propose their names? What if a madman comes to wield power? But thats not unheard of, is it? 

 There are also some very sane calculations going on about the presidential polls. The Congress president is trying to weigh the relative winnability of the candidates referred to her. If the UPA allies and the Left can settle on a single candidate, it could well be Pranab Mukherjee. But Shivraj Patil could emerge as a dark horse too (the grapevine says many want him out of the home ministry). Now that will create some vacancies in the cabinet, and guess who is most likely to have his portfolio shuffled? Mani Shankar Aiyar, of course. He has already done petroleum, North-east, panchayati raj and sports. So whats next?

 What has Amar Singh been up to after pleading with good friend Mayavati to put him in jail? He has been ill, of course ever since his party lost UP and Mayavati threatened him with some chakki pissing. But such is the mans conscience that he ignored his sickness to attend Rajya Sabha. He had a special question to ask the government: if it can proceed against Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar to make them pay their tax arrears, then why does it shy away from taking action against the Tatas and the Reliance concerns under Mukesh Ambani which have been pulled up by the CAG for evading taxes and dues? Okay, so that is what it was all about, was it? It goes without saying that his parliamentary duty (or should we say duty to a friend?) done, Amar Singh was back in his sick-bed, where, reportedly, his primary occupation is letter-writing. So now, besides the Collected Quotes of Amar Singh, you can also look forward to the Collected Letters of Amar Singh!

 Rahul Gandhi, being younger than Amar Singh (how old is Amar Singh? Twenty-seven? Twenty-eight?), has not fallen ill following the UP poll debacle for the Congress. Thank god for that! So many leaders in hospital would make life very difficult for journos on the health beat. Rahul will soon be touring UP again to thank those who voted for the hand in Amethi and Rae Bareli. As always, the hunt is on for the AICC man who fed him the wrong inputs that upset all his calculations. And once again, there is talk of how granny Indira G would ask him to take charge even when he was a young boy. 

 Who says Atal Bihari Vajpayee is getting old? So what if his walking has become wobblier and the pauses in his speech longer? There is no blunting his wit. On the recent tussle between cardiologist Naresh Trehan and the Escorts group of hospitals, he said, The well-known doctor who operated on so many heart patients is now himself being operated on by the new management [of Escorts]... This is not right...Hospital managements should not undertake such operations... Leave it to the doctors.

 Sitaram Kesri, approving of a Congressman who sold party flags for char anna each, once said: When they buy it, they put it up on their bicycles; but if they get it free, they will use it as a shopping bag.

 This is getting better than the K-serials. Two co-wives, who hadnt been on speaking terms for years, have now joined hands, urged on by the daughter of one. (Close your eyes and think of the camera zooming in on the faces, once, twice, thrice.) And why not? Theres the evil branch of the family to fight, which has been plotting to drive a wedge between their sons. (Think of a large drawing room, three ladies in Kanjivaram and a couple of men in off-white suits but with narrow eyes and crooked smiles.) The patriarch is happy with the daughter, and may soon send her to parliament and from there to the Union cabinet. A happy end to the Karunanidhi-Maran family drama is in sight too. The evil ones are getting their business interests scuttled by the patriarch. They look repentant, and may soon ask for the forgiveness of patriarch and family. The country will be in tears, TRPs will soar, and the curtain will come down.

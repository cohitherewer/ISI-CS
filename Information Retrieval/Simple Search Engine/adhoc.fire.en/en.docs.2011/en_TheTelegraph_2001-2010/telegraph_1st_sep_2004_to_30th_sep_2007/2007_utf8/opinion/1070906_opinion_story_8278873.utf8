 NOTHING BUT THE GENUINE STUFF

 CHINA DIARY - Neha Sahay

 A Sunday evening in a small city in south China. News has appeared on the expat website about the opening of a new pizza place. The pizzas are not only superlative, say the reviews, but cheap too. A family decides to check out the place, since ordering pizza at home is next to impossible. Its a small restaurant, able to seat just around 25 customers, but it has two television screens always showing STAR channels. No ones seated at any table, but theres a group of Westerners around the counter. The only Chinese person here is a three-year-old and her attendant. The pizzas are delicious, though slow in coming. Apparently, theres place for just one pizza at a time in the oven. 

 A few visits later, you realize that youre not supposed to go there just to eat pizza, the way you do at the plush Pizza Hut. This restaurant, owned by a South African married to a Chinese, is a place to meet expat men, bond over beer, and exchange stories. If a pizza comes along every 20 minutes, consider yourself blessed. The prices, 23 yuan for a 14-inch pizza dripping with cheese, are a blessing. 

 Pizza Hut charges almost thrice that. The feel of the place is an added bonus. You rarely leave without making an acquaintance. With a few beers down the belt, people end up talking freely about their experiences in this country full of surprises. At the same time, the place isnt noisy like a bar; you can actually have a long conversation without getting exhausted from yelling. And, unlike a bar, the Western food is actually authentic.

 Pizza hunting

 Pizza is a big issue for Western expats in China. Hours are spent bemoaning the unavailability of the genuine stuff; miles are travelled and borders crossed (to Hong Kong and Macau), with all the hassle of waiting in immigration queues, in search of the perfect pizza. 

 Since 1990, Pizza Hut, which operates in almost 40 cities now, has had almost a monopoly in China; but the last five years have seen others breaking in. Some of these are not international chains, but small pizzerias run by individual Westerners trying their luck in China. Running a business in China is not without hassles, but the large number of Chinese girls marrying Western men makes it easy. The business is in the wifes name sometimes, or even in their maids name. 

 Unlike teaching English, where any unqualified native speaker can bamboozle his/her way into becoming an English teacher, running a successful pizzeria is not so easy. There are still very few Chinese pizza lovers; most of them come only for the ambience. Thats why Pizza Hut can charge as much for one pizza as a good Chinese meal for three. With foreigners as your main clientele, you cant go around substituting mayonnaise for cheese, or passing off potato as a good pizza topping, as do many Chinese-owned West cafes. Thats precisely why these small pizzerias are doing just great they know what it takes to make a good pizza. 

 A former armyman-turned-bank advisor in England, who gave up his well-paying job to search for happiness in India, owns one of them. After six months of living with a family in India, he went back to England, did a teaching course, and came to China to teach. When his teaching assignment was over, he decided he would rather do what he loved, that is, cook. His pizza recipes are from the internet, and while his customers dig into them, he plays the clarinet or saxophone for them if hes in the mood. 

 Pizza is an indicator of how different India is from China. An entire expat sub-culture is built around it, even in some of the smallest cities of China. The only Chinese you meet in this ambience are those employed by expats in lowly jobs, or those married to them.

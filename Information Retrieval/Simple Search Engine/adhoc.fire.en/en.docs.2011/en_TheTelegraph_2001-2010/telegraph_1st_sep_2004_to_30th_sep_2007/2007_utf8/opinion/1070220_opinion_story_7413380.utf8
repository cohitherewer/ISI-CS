 ON THE CONTRARY

 For all its capacity for doublespeak, these must be trying times for the Communist Party of India (Marxist). It not only says one thing about economy, politics or governance and does another, but also changes colours to suit changing scenes of action. Thus, the party joins Ms Medha Patkar in the fight against special economic zones in Gujarat but pleads for them in Bengal. And, Ms Patkar becomes an enemy when she agitates in Bengal on the issue of acquisition of farm land for industry. The partys role is curiouser in Orissa where Mr Naveen Patnaik wants to do exactly what Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is doing in Bengal acquire agricultural land, not for SEZs, but for new industries. Thus, the CPI(M) politburos prevarications on SEZs betray the double standards. It is much the same for the partys supposedly moral objection to the Congresss plan for the imposition of presidents rule in Uttar Pradesh. The CPI(M) is not the only party that argues that a governments majority should be tested on the floor of the assembly of the state. But the same party supported the dismissal of the Kalyan Singh government in UP, following the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya. For all its defence of democracy, the party has no qualms about proposing a law that will empower its government in Bengal to dismiss elected panchayats. 

 The contradictions in the CPI(M)s stands reflect a larger dilemma that the party now faces. It is not simply that it has one identity in Bengal, where it rules, and another in other places, where it is in the opposition. At the heart of it is the partys struggle to adapt itself to a fast-changing economic scenario that is also shaping Indias politics. It has become increasingly difficult for the party to keep up old pretences in the face of the dramatic changes. Bengals reformist chief minister may have signalled the end of the left, but the partys leaders in New Delhi must carry on the show. The result is an unedifying image of a party battling against itself. Despite 30 years in power in Bengal, the CPI(M) cannot decide whether agit-prop is better than governance. The same confusion marks its dual role in New Delhi, where it alternately supports and opposes the government. Of course, Marxist theories have much to say on managing contradictions. But these outdated lessons do not seem to convince anyone, least of all the Marxists themselves.

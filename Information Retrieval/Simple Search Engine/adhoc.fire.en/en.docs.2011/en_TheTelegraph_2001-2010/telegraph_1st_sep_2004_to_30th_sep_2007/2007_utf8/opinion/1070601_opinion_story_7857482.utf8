 RAGS AND RICHES

 When people who are not poor decide to fix a poverty line, they need a minimum of commonsense. But the moment it became necessary to identify persons living below the poverty line in order to ensure certain benefits for them, thinking among Indias bureaucrats became not only devoid of commonsense, but also plain silly. The line was decided on the basis of calorie intake. The price of the lowest calorie intake adequate for survival was marked as the cut-off income for BPL persons. Poor people were not expected to live in shelters, educate their children, cook their food or treat their sick. Then as now, a sort of beastlike existence is taken for granted when the human beings in question are poor. The assumption argues something like a caste instinct directed against the poor. There can be no other explanation for the peculiar blind spot at the core of the BPL policy, a spot that has lightened perhaps, or shifted about, but never completely vanished in the years since BPL theories were first brought into practice.

 So it comes as no surprise that suddenly, in 2007, hill people in Darjeeling find themselves prosperous compared to people with the same income on the plains. The reason is simple: they have more clothes. The even simpler fact that it is cold in the hills and the inhabitants need not just more clothes, but also solid houses, however tiny, and fuel, however crude, just to survive is of no consequence to the West Bengal government, which relied on a recent social and economic study to conduct the survey. Either the study provided the most astonishing principles for the survey or the experts in the government just did not get it. As a result, around 41,000 people in the BPL category have turned above poverty line overnight and find no reason to celebrate, while 11,693 people on the plains have been now awarded BPL status. It may be quite possible that they needed it. But given the shameless power games played with BPL status from West Bengal to Gujarat, none of these moves can be seen as innocent. At best, they are stupid. Even within West Bengal, conditions of life vary too greatly to fix on one or two indicators as indices of poverty. Thousands of men, women and school-going children live on rice, boiled potatoes and a bi-monthly portion of fish. They do not do so out of choice. But the children do have more than six pieces of clothing. Which side of the line are they on?

 Letters to Editor

 Dada for every do

 Sir Now that Sourav Ganguly is back in the Indian team, the media circus around him has revived as well. But this is along expected lines, unlike the state governments attempts to use the cricketer for all its functions. Ganguly looked positively superfluous and silly at the governments signing of a deal with a steel magnate (Business, batsman and Buddha, Jan 12). If the chief minister is, as he claims, a well-wisher of the former captain, then he ought to put a stop to things which might take Dadas mind away from the game.

 Yours faithfully,

Sipra Talukdar, Calcutta

 Urn of discontent

 Sir Given the repeated hammering that England has received at the hands of the Aussies in Ashes not just this year but over the years it makes perfect sense that the heritage urn be handed over to Australia (Ashes that Aussies cant win Jan 5). The naysayers might argue that historically, the urn is more in the nature of English property it was presented as a gift to the English captain, Ivo Bligh, in 1882 by some Aussie women rather than a trophy to be contested and won. The flaw in the argument is evident: then the urn should not have been in the domain of cricketing war in the first place.The Aussie demand for the terracotta urn has been bolstered by Ian Bothams support. Of course, the English cricket board will never give in to the demand. For it is through tokenisms such as keeping the urn that English cricket tries to restore the prestige that it has lost on the field.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Sarkar, Calcutta

 Sir Ricky Ponting and Co. has scaled lofty heights with the 5-0 whitewash of England in the recently-concluded Ashes series. This has been one of Australias most successful series ever, but also one of the saddest. For, never again will the three greats, Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Justin Langer turn out in their baggy green caps. But the Aussies did not get emotional over this, because cricket for them is a game played by a team, not by individuals. 

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Sir Since the Australians have defeated England so convincingly in the Ashes series, they should be allowed to take the Ashes urn and keep it in their country at least for a brief period, if not till the next Ashes series. But the English are not willing to comply. Perhaps the International Cricket Council should be asked to resolve the dispute. 

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Theres hope yet

 Sir Young love cash and keen (Jan 1), is a perfect socio-cultural representation of todays Indian youth. They want to be financially independent while holding strongly on to their roots in the 21st-century global village. It is time the planners recognized the potential and aspirations of the youth. The young men and women of today must take the responsibility of building a super India which can proudly celebrate the centenary of its independence in 2047.

 Yours faithfully,

Tuli Das, Calcutta

 Sir The findings of The Telegraphs opinion poll would surely bring relief to the elders who had begun to lose faith in our youth. It also proves wrong those who had branded the young men and women of today as individualistic and selfish.

 Yours faithfully,

J. Mukherjee, Calcutta

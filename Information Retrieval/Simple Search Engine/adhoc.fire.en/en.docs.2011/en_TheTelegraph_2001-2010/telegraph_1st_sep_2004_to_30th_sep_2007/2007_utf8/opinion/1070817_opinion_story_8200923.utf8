 FROM THE DREAM FACTORY

 Filming: A love story By Tabish Khair, Picador, Rs 495

 Tabish Khair is a dream merchant. He understands the texture of dreams and, like a master weaver, brings together the particular dreams of each of the characters in his novel, Filming: A Love Story a technicolour rendition of the evolution of the Hindi film industry in Forties India. But Filming is that and more. History and fiction meld in this novel of grandiose structure, where overlapping narratives, drifting between the realistic and the dreamlike, and a multi-layered plot, tell an unassuming love story: a story of two people who escape or seem to the barbed wire of post-Partition religious separatism, for a reality perhaps more elusive, more insubstantial, than dreams.

 Filming is cinematic in style and structure. The introduction reads like a credit roll, and each section in the book is presented in terms of reels. The omniscient narrator, like a camera lens, pans over the different narratives, hovering between the reality of a Bombay torn by communal violence, and the fantastic world of the cinema it produces. A scholar of Indian films in Berlin travels to Copenhagen to meet the former scriptwriter, Rizwan Hussain Batin. What transpires at the meeting is a complex tale of celluloid dreams and borderless reality, where speakers and subjects merge and mingle as the author challenges the readers expectations of a discernible narrative. 

 A Muslim prostitute, renaming herself Durga, elopes with the much older Hindu postal clerk, Harihar, and they tour the villages of India, chasing Harihars dream of bringing cinema into the lives of people through the lens of a bioscope purchased with his lifes savings. But Durga has a different dream of the time they would have enough to stop, put down roots. Their dreams come close to fulfilment when they arrive at Anjangarh with their son Ashok. At the sprawling haweli of the Thakurs, zamindars of Anjangarh, they meet Chotte Thakur, a man chasing his own dream of performance while trying to come to terms with a traditional society that punishes alternative sexuality and alternative career choices with equal revulsion. They also meet the matriarch, Badi Maalkini, who sees in little Ashok a reincarnation of her own dead son. In a remarkable barter of desire and personal sacrifice, the couple give up their only child to her in the hope of a better future for him and in return for a film studio they set up with the Chotte Thakur just outside Bombay. 

 Saleem Lahori, former star of the silent film, struggles to cope with the changes in the industry, brought about as much by the advent of talkies as by a political atmosphere permeating even that one safe haven the studio hitherto unpolluted by religious difference, where gods of all faiths could once exist side by side. As friendship gives way to communality, Saleem has to choose to leave for a Pakistan he cannot imagine because it is not home, or to stay back in a hostile Bombay for a love that must not be. While a doctor recounts her family history, the scholar collates the different accounts, reading between the lines to draw astonishing conclusions.

 Khair dedicates Filming to Saadat Hasan Manto. The spirit of Mantos lunatic from Toba Tek Singh haunts the story, evoking the most disturbing questions about exile and faith.

 Occasionally, Khair loses his way in the mesh of stories, but in the end, Filming comes through beautifully like a film slipping from its reel a story of people reclaiming their lives at the historical moment of the birth of a nation.

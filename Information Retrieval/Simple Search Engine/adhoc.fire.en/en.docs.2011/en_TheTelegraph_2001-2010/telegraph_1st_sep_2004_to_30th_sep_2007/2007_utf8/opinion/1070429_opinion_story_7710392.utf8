The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 WHISTLE BLOWERS

 Indian football is a joke. Everyone knows it but no one quite says it aloud. It needed the head of the Asian Football Confederation, Mr Mohamed bin Hammam to set the cat among the pigeons. He said that it will take India another 100 years to play in the World Cup. Maybe he is an optimist. The president of Fifa, Mr Joseph Sepp Blatter, noted the irony inherent in the situation when he pointed out that there are football clubs in Calcutta Mohun Bagan being the obvious example which are older than Fifa. He was right when he said that these clubs have no infrastructure for coaching and nurturing talent. The attitude and the infrastructure are both antiquated. In typical fashion, Mr Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, who has made the All India Football Federation his own bailiwick for two decades, tried to pass the buck. He remarked that since the football clubs in Calcutta are all located in the Maidan, which is on army land, the clubs have no scope for expansion. This begs too many questions. Why have not the clubs sought land elsewhere to build new facilities for coaching and training? Are the existing premises used adequately for training purposes? How much do these clubs spend on coaching? How much does the AIFF spend on training and coaching? The fact of the matter is that these clubs and the AIFF have become sites for petty faction-mongering and power play. The victim has been football, which has been kicked out of play.

 Another myth needs to be shattered. It is often claimed Mr Blatter echoed this that Indian football has a memorable past. The claim needs to be examined. In the past, an Indian team has won in the Asian Games and another qualified for the semi-finals in the Olympics. Other than these, Indian football has no international achievements. Except in 1950, no team from India has ever come within sniffing distance of playing in the World Cup while countries smaller than India, and with no history comparable to Indian footballs great tradition, have consistently qualified to play in the World Cup. In fact, there has been no international measurement of the talents of the so-called greats of Indian soccer since none of them ever played at the highest level of world football. It is worth remembering that most Indian teams, even in the Fifties and Sixties, did not have the stamina to last out ninety minutes. Indian football has always been and continues to remain in the they also played category. Unfortunately, there are no consolation prizes for stragglers in world football.

 Mr Blatter and his colleague, Mr Hammam, have blurted out the unpleasant truth. But their criticism is unlikely to have an impact. Those who run Indian football are smug. This is, sadly, in sharp contrast to the enthusiasm that the game of football generates in India. Indian football fans have grown used to being shortchanged. They never cry foul.

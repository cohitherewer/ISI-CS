The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 PICTURE IMPERFECT

 The National Family Health Survey presents a familiar picture of West Bengal. The lack of improvement in female education, health or empowerment that the report brings to light through its cold statistics is a reflection of a mindset that is in no hurry to change. The apathy regarding such crucial issues has been so alarming that government fiats have had to be issued to make legislators attendance compulsory at sensitizing sessions. The same attitude makes itself apparent in government-run hospitals or rural healthcare centres. Neither feel any qualms in turning away dying women or making childbirth under a tree seem the most natural thing to happen to women. Little wonder child and maternal mortality figures have been rising. The reasons behind Bengals declining position with respect to female literacy and welfare cannot be explained merely by the lack of political interest in these matters. Deeply-entrenched beliefs and social resistance to change have often negated whatever progress has been achieved by and for women. But one cannot dismiss the need for a greater understanding of the interconnected problems, which can hold back Bengals over-all development. For example, nothing can be gained by way of womens education nor the mortality rates be curbed if early marriages are not prevented. And this would be impossible to achieve without taking another look at how poverty, lack of education and awareness continue to push women into early child-bearing and a life of limited choices. 

 It is perhaps a heightened awareness of the importance of improving womens condition that has allowed other states to better their standing. They have not only increased their allocations for family welfare and education, but have allowed non-governmental organizations to step in where the state has been unable to reach out. For the ruling Left, given its political organization at the grassroots, this is even less of a problem. What it needs is greater commitment and understanding.

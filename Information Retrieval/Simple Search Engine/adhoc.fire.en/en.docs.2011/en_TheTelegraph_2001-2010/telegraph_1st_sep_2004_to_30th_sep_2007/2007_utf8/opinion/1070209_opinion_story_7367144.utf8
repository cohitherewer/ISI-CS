The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 HOW VERY SWEET

 It is more nursery rhyme than fairytale: the pussycat that went up to London to see the Queen, and felt very special indeed, for the rest of its life, for having frightened a little mouse under the royal chair. The nasty is now giving way to the sweet in the Shilpa Shetty story. Shetty and her mother (only the Big Brother had managed to keep them apart) had been to the House of Commons to sit through prime ministers questions, most of which were about Lords reform. The Shettys then went on to the prime ministers office where the daughter was praised by Mr Tony Blair for conducting herself with the utmost dignity during her tribulations in the Big Brother house. Mr Blair was very sad to see what she had to go through there, and gave her a portrait of the House of Commons signed by himself and his wife. The Shettys then wafted on to lunch at the members dining room smoked salmon and English desserts (in the plural) in the course of which the culture secretary, Ms Tessa Jowell, provided another bout of enchantment and a gift. Then there was a rather breathless press conference outside Portcullis House. With the sad Mr Blair and the kind Ms Jowell, the praise, the first-names bonhomie, the gifts and the desserts, the whole affair has suddenly become, in Shilpa Shettys own words, very, very sweet. 

 Shetty is now a great deal richer, has a publicist who has worked for the Beatles, Mohamed al-Fayed and O.J. Simpson, and rumoured offers from British sitcoms and a Hollywood film, although Bollywood might not have been significantly amused. Britain has also managed to be seen again as a country of fairness and tolerance, as its chancellor had put it during his recent trip to India. New Labours Asian vote-bank should thus have been retained too. The Shettys host at the House of Commons was Mr Keith Vaz, MP from the Leicester East constituency. Mr Vaz had been the person to raise the issue of racism against Shetty in parliament. He was also the hand behind Amitabh Bachchans honorary degree from a university in Leicester, which may be the first British city to have an ethnic majority within the next decade. If racism is at bottom the most terrible form of ignorance, then has the Shilpa Shetty episode taught Britain anything more than the usual, facile identification of India with Bollywood kitsch? From snake-charmers to starlets is not a radical change of stereotype.

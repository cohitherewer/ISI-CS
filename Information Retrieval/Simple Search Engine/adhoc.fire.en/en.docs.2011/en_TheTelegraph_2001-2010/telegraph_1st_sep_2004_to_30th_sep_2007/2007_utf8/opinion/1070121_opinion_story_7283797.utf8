The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 A past that hangs heavy

 Sir Germany has called for a EU ban on the swastika, an ancient Hindu symbol of peace and prosperity(Hindus in Europe fight for swastika, Jan 17). Swastika is a popular name for Indian women. One assumes that these women will now be denied visas to Europe, unless they change their names. Europe is not free of racism. The EU, for instance, has not accepted Turkey as a member, while happily incorporating white Christian nations guilty of genocide. Germany will not be able to erase its Nazi past with such superficial gestures.

 Yours faithfully,

 Amit Banerjee, Calcutta

 Over the top

 Sir The fact that the news of Aishwarya Rais engagement to Abhishek Bachchan was splashed on the front page of The Telegraph, one of Indias most reputed newspapers, was astonishing, to say the least (Preview over, ticket to tie knot, Jan 15). The prospect of the wedding of two of Bollywoods biggest stars is unlikely to excite the fraternity of serious readers. Perhaps it was felt that this news, along with the picture of the worlds most beautiful woman, would brighten up the readers day. Nothing, however, could be farther from the truth. On the contrary, this kind of journalism only makes it difficult for readers to distinguish a reputed national daily from a cine-magazine. Surely, the story on Aishwarya Rais engagement deserved to be placed on the back pages, considering the importance of such news in the national context.

 Yours faithfully,

Rimli Datta, Calcutta

 Sir The medias response to the Aishwarya Rai-Abhishek Bachchan engagement makes one wonder whether the fate of the country now depends on the success of this match. Abhishek and Aishwarya are both famous in the entertainment world. They are also considered to be youth icons in India. Yet, when it came to marriage, the two of them had no problems in seeking the advice of astrologers to remove the divine obstacles that supposedly lay in their path. It is a shame that such superstitious souls have come to represent a young, vibrant India. The media should refrain from publicizing this marriage which, in effect, is a non-event.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Das Gupta, Burdwan

 Sir The fact that two of Indias hottest stars have decided to tie the knot in real life will gladden the hearts of Hindi film-lovers. There is no doubt about the fact that Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai are a perfect match. Both of them are talented actors, who have tasted success early in life. Here is wishing the two of them a happy married life, hopefully with a few controversies less. 

 Yours faithfully,

J. Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir Aishwarya Rai has finally agreed to marry Abhishek Bachchan. One hopes that this would stop the rumour mills from churning out misinformation about the couple. Not surprisingly, the media is agog with the news of the engagement. But the question that needs to be asked is whether the media have the right to interfere into the personal affairs of celebrities. Remember how Princess Diana met her tragic end? The paparazzi were responsible for the death of the princess and her lover in a road accident. One must also remember that India is a poor country. It is still grappling with numerous social and economic problems, despite a promising growth rate. Abhishek Bachchans marriage to Aishwarya Rai is unlikely to end the common mans miseries. The media seem to have forgotten this fact. Neither do the journalists remember that they have a right to live in peace, just like any other Indian citizen.

 Yours faithfully,

Ganesh Sovani, Naupada, Thane

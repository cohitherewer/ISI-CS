 WAYS TO CURE THE BODY POLITIC 

 MALAFIDE

 Malvika Singh

 The municipal elections in Delhi, where the Congress got pretty much wiped out after nine years of being in power, once again reiterates the chronic disease that has set into the body politic of this party. Infighting, backbiting, intrigue, lies and misinformation by opposing groups come together to produce a poisonous, deadly cocktail that is effectively destroying the party. It has become a bit of a joke as the men and women in charge of various states, most of them losers from previous elections, who have not been able to win their seats, parade about, pretending and fooling their bosses about the realities on the ground. They are all united in purpose only when it comes to jockeying for power or filling the ears of the decision-makers with selective information and never the whole truth. The party would have disintegrated for all these reasons, a long time ago, if it had not been held together by Sonia Gandhis presence. The time seems right for her to cleanse the party of all these parasites even if that rocks the boat temporarily. 

 Much like the attempt to tidy up the cricket scene by calling a spade a spade, those responsible for steering the political process must be hauled over the coals when things go as wrong as they have been in the municipal elections in Delhi. Ashok Gehlot lost Rajasthan for all the wrong reasons. He misjudged the mood of the people, gave sitting and corrupt candidates tickets, and 99 per cent of his cabinet ministers lost, which says a lot about his administration. He became increasingly isolated as the years in power rolled on, was unwilling to hear anyone other than his cronies, and now, he has failed to deliver in Delhi. 

 Inner strife

 Every citizen in the state has witnessed the political games that Ram Babu Sharma and Ajay Maken have indulged in. Attacks on the chief minister, who belongs to the same party as they do, have shown these unsophisticated political players to be partisan and not being able to look at the larger picture. They often sound and act as the opposition would towards the ruling party. The Congress has suffered hugely because of this and the results are evident across India. In Punjab, the Bhattal and Amarinder Singh duel; in Delhi, the Rambabu-Ajay Maken and Sheila Dixit stand-off; in Himachal, the CM is not inclusive in his political inner party strategy, thereby causing dissension, and so the story goes on. The time has come for some of the architects of this mess to be dropped and sent to pasture. At the Centre, senior leaders talk openly against the prime minister and some work silently like eager beavers, to make sure he remains weak within the party. All party leaders pull in different directions and speak against each other, making the Congress a hotbed of intrigue where contest for internal power is the primary goal. 

 Beyond self-interest

 Why dont those same leaders put their personal energy and undying passion for power to real use and win elections with large mandates? Why dont they work for their party rather than only for themselves? Why this desperate greed at all levels? Such human behaviour comes from deep insecurity and the inability to comprehend the need of the day. It comes from people who lack intellectual confidence, who want to make a quick and superficial impression which impacts negatively on the future, who believe solely in self-aggrandizement. Unfortunately, all political parties are afflicted with this illness, some more than the others, but the Congress is truly sick with the virus and needs to be put on strong medication to save it from permanent damage. An overhaul is imperative whatever the consequences because without purging the infected germs, the restoration of good health would be impossible.

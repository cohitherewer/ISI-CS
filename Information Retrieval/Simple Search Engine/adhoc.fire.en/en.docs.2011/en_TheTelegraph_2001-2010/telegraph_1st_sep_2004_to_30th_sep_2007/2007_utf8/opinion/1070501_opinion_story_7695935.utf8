 LIVING ON THE EDGE

 Surveys on the liveability of the Indian cities concern themselves with the needs of the prosperous few, writes Chirosree Basu 

 Danger zone

 India is a country of conflicting realities. Nothing illustrates this better than the confusing results of various surveys undertaken recently on the liveability of Indian cities. In its Worldwide Quality of Living survey, Mercer Human Resource Consulting, a firm advising companies on the placement of their personnel, anointed New Delhi as the best city to live in, so far as India is concerned. It surveyed 215 countries on the basis of 39 criteria that included social, economic and environmental factors. Dominant among these were considerations of pollution, public health, access to hospitals and spread of infectious diseases. Days later, AC-Nielsen came up with its own findings. According to it, New Delhi and Mumbai are the worst cities in India. Chandigarh, with its strict adherence to the original city-plan, is the best city, followed by Chennai. Calcutta trails close behind. Among its 11 parameters are air pollution, drainage, greenery, garbage disposal, clean drinking water and so on.

 It goes without saying that unlike any of the other metropolitan cities, New Delhi has worked steadfastly on refurbishing its image as the political and diplomatic capital of the country. Its Masterplan for 2021 is ready, with proposals for land use and expansion clearly laid out (although not much thought has been spared for guaranteeing the plans enforcement or assessing the impact of the liberal commercialization it provides for). The Supreme Court-promoted sealing drive on illegal commercial establishments has tidied up the city. There are plans for strengthening the infrastructure, and making durable roads from disposable plastic waste. Above all, there is the citys resounding success in cutting down on air pollution by shifting to compressed natural gas as fuel for its vehicles.

 Not many cities have been able to leapfrog towards cleaner air as New Delhi has. Its protracted struggle from the early Nineties, punctuated by the state governments own pussy-footing on the issue, has now enabled it to close or relocate most of the hazardous industries outside the city, to drastically reduce the sulphur content in industrial and vehicular fuel, to phase out old and polluting vehicles, and thereby reduce noxious emissions, and to push for the conversion to CNG by putting the requisite infrastructure in place. Mumbai too has effected the closure or relocation of textile mills and ancillary units. By 2002, it had even replaced or forced the conversion of its polluting taxis and three-wheelers to CNG or LPG. But it has not been able to report as much success as New Delhi. The construction of fly-overs, the traffic congestion and the population increase have negated much of the positive impact of its measures.

 Both Chennai and Calcutta have done little to control vehicular pollution, apart from passing strictures on the reduction of the sulphur content of the fuel. Calcutta is yet to relocate all of its polluting industries outside the city, and its drive against vehicular emission has been singularly ineffective. It seems to be following New Delhi in its initial stages of pollution control, when the state government systematically thwarted the judiciarys attempt to make it see reason. Unlike New Delhi, however, it has not shown much initiative in passing pollution control regulations. Yet, Calcuttas hope lies entirely in its effective limitation of vehicular emissions, since leapfrogging to CNG or to alternative fuels still remains a distant dream in its case. The possibility of a physical expansion could have reduced either the population or traffic-density. But unlike New Delhi, again, Calcutta does not have that option, bounded off by the river Hooghly and the wetlands on either side. A severe crisis thus seems to be looming ahead of Calcutta, now hell-bent on promoting itself as an investment destination for foreign funds.

 But, as the surveys indicate, air pollution alone does not determine the liveability of cities. Access to healthcare, the availability of electricity, potable water, proper sanitation, drainage and transport are the other major concerns. Many point out that despite its alarming pollution levels, Calcutta is still eminently liveable for the lower middle classes and the poor who enjoy its low cost of living, abundant water and the corrupt and much-abused, but still functioning healthcare system.

 The liveability of a city depends on the perception of the needs of its residents. To a set of people, education and entertainment (in the form of shopping malls, cinemas and so on) are equally legitimate needs as water, electricity and good roads. These, in fact, are now part of the basic requirements of the upper and middle classes that form the bulk of the surveys samples. Mercer, quite obviously, is not engaging itself with the concerns of the lower middle classes and the poor when it talks of liveability. Nor, evidently, are the modern-day city-planners. 

 In New Delhi, for example, the drive to promote it as a model city and the consequent demolition drive have brought down numerous shanty-towns and slums that dotted the Yamuna. The residents (only those who can prove that they have lived in the city since a time preceding 1998) have been relocated kilometres away from the city where they fight over the meagre resources of water and food. In their shacks standing on bamboo poles, there is no scope for proper sanitation or drainage. Yet, in a large number of these slums, the residents earlier enjoyed running water and electricity, and shared in the general wellbeing of the community. New Delhi has been made unliveable for them so that other sections of the population may live in it.

 The government is under no compulsion to make the lives of these people or their places of residence liveable. They are, in official parlance, the non-paying polluters, who are either shunted out of the city or allowed to remain invisible under sprawling flyovers as the city carries on its march towards progress. But can the city move forward or be able to preserve its environment if it chooses to forget them entirely? For, many of those who have been displaced even if they are exiled out of the city will continue to tap it for a source of livelihood in the absence of a viable option of employment outside, and, thereby, continue to contribute to that vicious cycle of environmental degradation.

 These sections are undoubtedly culpable for the deteriorating environment in cities, but they are no greater sinners than car-owners or bus-owners, who clog the streets and choke the air (in fact, the poor pay more dearly, by way of sickness and chronic ailments, for the polluted environment than those who can pay for their healthcare). Equally to blame is the government, which makes only half-hearted attempts to reduce pollution or to better public utility services. In any case, such services should cater to the entire population, irrespective of its class divides. Is it not criminal on the part of the government to provide more tax cuts to the car industry, so that it can sell more cars, when pollution control is so abysmal? Why must government hoardings preach afforestation but never encourage the use of public transport in place of personal cars as a more viable way of improving the quality of air? 

 However, it is far more preferable for the public to wake up to the disconcerting reality than blame the government alone for the deteriorating environment. The aggressive development in India is not only endangering lives in the metros repeatedly surveyed, but also in scores of other cities and small towns, where pollution and the degradation of civic life has reached alarming proportions. To assure that life is still liveable for every citizen, it is necessary not only for the government to give up its double standards, but also for the citizens themselves to be more aware of what is being put at stake by their aggrandizing ways of life.

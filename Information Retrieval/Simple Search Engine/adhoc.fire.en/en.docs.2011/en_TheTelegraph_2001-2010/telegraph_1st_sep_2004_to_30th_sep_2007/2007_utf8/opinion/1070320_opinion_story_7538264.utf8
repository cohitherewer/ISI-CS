 MAKE IT QUICK

 The India-Pakistan peace process is steadily but cautiously moving forward. The latest round of talks in Islamabad between the two foreign secretaries is good evidence of the growing stability of bilateral relations. The danger, however, is that the internal situation in Pakistan in the future may not be as conducive for the peace process. It is vital, therefore, to inject greater momentum as early as possible to ensure that bilateral ties cannot easily be derailed. In the recent talks, which are part of the composite dialogue, the Indian foreign secretary, Mr Shiv Shankar Menon, and his Pakistani counterpart, Mr Riaz Mohammed Khan, agreed to a number of confidence-building measures, and also put in place an agenda for the future. Particularly significant are those measures related to Jammu and Kashmir in the areas of communication and trade. They include, among other things, a helicopter service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad, the holding of sports events, a postal service across the line of control, and a bus service between Kargil in Kashmir and Skardu (in the Northern Areas). It was also agreed that the defence secretaries, along with the respective directors-general of military operations, would meet as early as possible for talks on Siachen. 

 The Pakistan foreign secretary hoped that 2007 would be a watershed year for bilateral relations. There are, however, several factors that could potentially undermine the peace process. Most important is the fear that there could be an escalation of violence in the summer months in Jammu and Kashmir because of the regrouping of militant organizations. Terrorist incidents would most certainly make it more difficult for the prime minister to launch fresh initiatives with regard to Pakistan. Related to this is the growing opposition to Mr Musharraf from both extremist organizations as well as the more liberal sections of public opinion. It must be recognized, however, that there have been few leaders in Pakistan who have shown the same degree of flexibility on Kashmir and keenness to make peace with India than Mr Musharraf. It is critical, therefore, to conclude agreements on Siachen, Sir Creek and even Kashmir before the president is too weak to risk friendship with India. It is equally important for Mr Manmohan Singh to visit Pakistan and strengthen stakeholders who will continue to have an interest in peace between India and Pakistan beyond Mr Musharraf.

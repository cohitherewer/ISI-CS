 ASK THE RIGHT QUESTION

 BONA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH

 A recent pre-poll analysis, sponsored by a news channel, categorically stated that the Congress would gain nothing substantial in the forthcoming elections in Uttar Pradesh and that the party is likely to perform badly along with other smaller contenders. A rather unbelievable picture emerged in the course of the analysis development, it seems, was what put Mulayam Singh at the forefront, neck to neck with Mayavati. The programme left me bewildered and confused. Either I am a rather foolish, uninformed woman who has been oblivious to the marked progress made by UP as far as the fulfilment of basic needs are concerned or the growth and development story has not been reported in the national media.

 One of the presenters suggested that the response, however strange it might appear to Indians, was probably due to high expectations in the state. This left me even more confused. Why do ordinary people react differently from those in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan? What do the respondents see as good development? How do they rate governance per se? Have their basic needs, such as water, electricity, employment opportunities and an improved law and order situation, been met ? We would have liked to find an answer to these questions. We would also want to have the presenters place comparisons on the table and not merely deliver a generalized statement. Indians are hungry to know more. It is time we in the media begin to respect their queries. It is time to change the kind of questions that presenters ask on television. What is being dished out today is dull and predictable.

 Just a myth

 There is though the other-side-of-the-coin view people get what they deserve. Maybe, the advertising campaign featuring Amitabh Bachchan (which was ordered off the air by the Election Commission a day after it announced the poll dates) has embedded itself in the minds of fans in urban and semi-urban UP who follow the superstar mindlessly. All the fantasies that Bachchan weaved on television perhaps relieved the trauma of those living in abject conditions. Whoever devised the advertisements should be saluted. Bachchan was, in fact, a star political campaigner for the Samajwadi Party and he used television as a tool to meet political ends.

 I am no accurate pollster. But having seen some of the horrors of rural and semi- urban UP (although my experience cannot be compared to what others have seen in the course of their travels in large parts of the state), there is hardly any development taking place compared to Madhya Pradesh. It is not visible even in the outskirts of Lucknow, let alone in the hinterlands. Friends who nurture constituencies, and belong to parties other than the SP, some in central UP and some in the eastern part of the state, have a different story to tell. Poverty is abject and economic opportunity nearly non-existent. Crime and the fear of the danda have silenced the people.

 Where does the truth lie? Are the people secure in the new myth that has been created? Can this myth act as a balm to the interminable pain and rampant exploitation? This reality should come as manna from heaven for all those young men and women occupying the political space in the state. On their part, they need to expose this myth as a lie. To do so, they will have to work hard and carefully orchestrate a peoples movement in the grassroot level. Development initiatives using the old and seldom-used principles and methods such as kar seva and shram daan should be practiced as well. 

 Most importantly, the stage must be set for national icons from all professions and disciplines to debate and hold discourses on the evil consequences of the caste system that place obstacles on the road to development and rapid growth. It is a truly exciting challenge.

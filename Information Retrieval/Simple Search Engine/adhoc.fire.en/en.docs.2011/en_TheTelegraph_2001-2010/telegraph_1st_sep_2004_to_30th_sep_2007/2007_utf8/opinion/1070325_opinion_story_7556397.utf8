 Letters to Editor

 Red light on

 Sir Manmohan Singh had described the Maoists as the biggest security threat facing India. The latest massacre of policemen in Chhattisgarh shows that Singhs words are to be taken seriously. The government should realize that deprivation in underdeveloped areas is forcing people to take up arms. Token gestures will simply not do. A mechanism needs to be put in place that can ensure growth in these areas. After all, only a shining urban India is not enough. The government needs to solve the problems affecting the countryside as well. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Lives unchanged

 Sir The report, Women not well in Bengal (March 5), deserved a place in the front page. In the past thirty years, the Left Front government has made numerous claims about the progress made by women in Bengal. The National Family Health Survey, however, punches holes into such a claim by exposing the dismal performance of the government in spheres of womens health, education and empowerment. 

 The survey has brought to light a few interesting facts. It states that while backward states like Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have taken giant strides in womens education, Bengal ranks far below, and is on a par with Orissa. A meagre 16 per cent of women complete 10 years of education or more as compared to 49 per cent in Kerala. This only points to the fact that the governments failure to improve literacy levels, especially among women, has led to a slide in their general well-being. This is evident from the rise in the number of teenage pregnancies according to the survey, 25 per cent of women between the age of 15 and 19 become pregnant in this state, as against 14 per cent in Orissa and 6 per cent in Kerala. Some of the other figures published in the survey are equally disturbing. Only 38 per cent of married women in Bengal have a say in household decisions. Fewer women are going to hospitals for delivery and there has been an increase in dowry deaths and domestic violence. 

 If the pitiable state of women here is anything to go by, then one has to admit that West Bengal has not been able to make much progress under the Left rule. The chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, is being praised for his efforts to attract investment for the state. There is no doubt that economic growth is important for a state. But real development is only possible when it is accompanied by an improvement in the quality of life for both men and women.

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 Sir The findings by the National Family Health Survey should open the eyes of politicians and social activists all over the country, and not just in Bengal. It has been found that a large percentage of married women are abused by their husbands in the country. One of the major reasons for this is the low literacy level among men and women in this country. Six decades of independence has done nothing to alleviate the problems faced by the people. The politicians, who are supposedly the peoples representatives, have done nothing to reform the society and help those who get them elected. Little wonder then that the common people have no other choice but to turn to the courts for solving even the most mundane problems. 

 Yours faithfully,

B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

 Sir The National Family Health Survey has shown that the plight of women is the same all over the country, including Left-ruled liberal Bengal. Perhaps, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee should stop chasing investors and devote more time to the task of empowering women in his state.

 Yours faithfully,

Bina Ghosh, Calcutta

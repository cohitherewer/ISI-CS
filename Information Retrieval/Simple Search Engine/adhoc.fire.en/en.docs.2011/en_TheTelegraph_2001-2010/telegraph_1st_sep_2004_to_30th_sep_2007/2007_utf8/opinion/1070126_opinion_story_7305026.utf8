 FOLKLORE, HISTORY AND THE KINGDOM OF HAPPINESS

 King Jigme Singye Wangchuck on tour in rural Bhutan

 Treasures of the Thunder Dragon: A Portrait of Bhutan By Ashi Dorji Wangmo Wangchuk, Viking, Rs495

 Druk Yul, or the land of the thunder dragon, was a magic kingdom nestled in the high Himalaya, where the people, though poor, loved their pristine forests, gurgling rivers, red-robed monks and above all, their good and wise king. 

 Serfdom existed there until 1956. Its first paved road was built only in 1961 and its first bank set up in 1968. There was no television or access to the internet there until 1999. Bhutan lived in its splendid isolation from the rest of the world. The king then decided that the time had come for his kingdom to embrace modernity. 

 He wanted the country to have a written constitution which would give the people their right to choose their representatives through democratic elections. Having initiated such dramatic changes, he decided that it was time for him to abdicate and hand over powers to his eldest son. 

 The author of the book was the queen of Bhutan, the eldest of the four sisters whom King Jigme Singye Wangchuk had married. She is now the Queen Mother, as her eldest son, Khesar, succeeded to the throne late last year. Her portrait of Bhutan, especially in these times of change for the country, may go a long way in satisfying the worlds new-found curiosity about the country. 

 Because of the changes that King Jigme Singye Wangchuk set in motion, the world has suddenly begun to look up the far-away land. Sometime in the Seventies, he had said that he cared more about Gross National Happiness than the usual economic yardsticks such as the gross national product. In 2003, when the idea of a democratic government was first mooted, an international seminar in Thimphu saw sixty papers tabled on GNH. 

 The book, however, steers clear of the serious social, political and cultural issues that Bhutans journey to modernity has raised. Instead, it tries to capture the legends of the land, its unspoilt natural beauty and the social, cultural and religious traditions that rule the peoples lives. And, the author has chosen a format that seems to be eminently suitable for her purpose. The result is an interesting blend of personal memoir, travelogue, folklore and history. In three clearly divided parts, the book captures her personal journey through life, the people and places in Bhutan and her travels through the land as the queen. 

 The picture is still of a very unique land and of a people steeped in traditions that date back to their Tibetan origins. The changes are also mentioned, though not in the manner in which an outsider might look at them. Perhaps the authors position on the changes will find its echo in most Bhutanese peoples responses to them. She is convinced that the changes are necessary because the country cannot afford to lock itself in its mountainous isolation any longer. But she would not like Bhutan to lose its natural and cultural treasures for the sake of a better economy or democratic politics. 

 She knows that not even Bhutan could remain totally immune to the ways of the world. She recounts, rather dolefully, how her husband and eldest son were forced to lead a battle a few years ago against the militants from Indias North-east who had set up their training camps and shelter in southern Bhutan. That was the first time that Bhutan had to fight any battles since its war with the British in 1864-65. 

 An important event in Bhutans recent history is, however, not mentioned at all. The pro-democracy movement by ethnic Nepalis in southern Bhutan in the late 1980s, that saw large-scale displacements of people from the area, is understandably too uncomfortable a story for a queen of Bhutan to recount.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 HIT AND RUN

 Very few would disagree that Greg Chappell has had a rather unfair share of troubles since he took over as coach of the Indian team in 2005. Much of this is owing to the fact that the game that is played around the eleven in Team India has come to assume a greater significance than the action on the field itself. In this game of backroom cricket, Chappells professionalism has appeared as misadventure, often to cricketers themselves and to their huge following, which includes both effigy-burning mobsters and erudite columnists. The groundswell against Chappell took on an ominous tinge during his unceremonious clash with the former captain of the team. That episode may be over, but the residue it has left in the public mind is evident from the assault on Chappell in Bhubaneswar. The coachs apparently uncontested power to make and unmake cricketers was what prompted the unprovoked attack on him by a Kalinga Sena-activist. Chappells assaulter was protesting against the exclusion of Oriya cricketers from the team without knowing that his target has little say in the selection of the team or its captain. Nevertheless, what happened in Bhubaneswar was one of the ugliest forms of regional jingoism ever witnessed, and it was made worse by the administrations attempt to hush up the matter. The Orissa authorities description of the incident as a bumbling-up by a protestor-in-flight takes nothing away from its unsavouriness. 

 This is the second time Chappell finds himself a victim of the parochial sentiments Indian cricket has come to represent. This unfortunate association of provincial interests with the game, promoted by cricketers and selectors, has been encouraged by canny politicians who find the stupendous reach of the game a convenient tool for themselves. Little wonder the gentlemans spirit is ever-lacking, be it in selections or elections concerning the game.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 IN DISARRAY

 As usual, the media are to blame. It seems now that Najma Heptullah is proud to be the Bharatiya Janata Partys candidate for vice-president, and she never did refuse to take part in a token contest. It was only the distortion of a television channel. But however hunky-dory things appear at the moment, they can barely disguise the BJPs growing desperation. In spite of Ms Heptullahs wide-eyed denials, it is quite clear that the BJP was frantically looking for an acceptable candidate after her refusal. The names the party had come up with in the interim were freshly scraped from the bottom of the barrel. There are obviously no leaders that the BJP can flaunt before the whole nation. For a centralized party, there can be no greater crisis and no greater indication of eroding strength. Yet its very centralization could have caused the failure to produce effective young leaders. In this context, the scale and nature of the defeat of Bhairon Singh Shekhawat tell a story that goes beyond the mere prefiguring of numbers supporting the candidate of the United Progressive Alliance. It was a symptom, a blatant one, of the partys gradual loss of control over its own. 

 The BJP can blame the Trinamool Congress and the Shiv Sena for ditching their National Democratic Alliance partner in the polls, and sulk because the Telugu Desam Party and the Samajwadi Party, apparent friends, refused to support it. But there is cause for real alarm elsewhere. In Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Bihar, BJP members of parliament and the legislative assemblies voted against Mr Shekhawat. The BJP was not prepared for this shock. Hindutva having become a sporadic, and often local, strategy not even an ideology, there is no longer a dominant doctrine, and there is no leader of the stature of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani. Even the moral ground the BJP laid claim to has been washed away through a series of exposures of corruption and hypocrisy. Ms Heptullah might be the fig-leaf for now. But unless the BJP finds a leader and a binding principle fast, its days as a national party might be numbered.

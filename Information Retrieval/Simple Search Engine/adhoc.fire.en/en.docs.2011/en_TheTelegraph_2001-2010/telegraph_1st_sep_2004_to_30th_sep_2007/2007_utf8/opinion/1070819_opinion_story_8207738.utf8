The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 ALL IN THE JEANS

 The female body is a dangerous thing. It acts like a virus in the computer of the male brain, scattering fragments of logic and sane understanding in its wake. Witness the total confusion with which the Darul Uloom has managed to cover itself in its feeble attempts to explain why women students should not wear jeans in Uttar Pradesh colleges. To defend this the Darul Ulooms latest fatwa one spokesman has said that some sayings in Islam disapprove of women who adopt the resemblance of men. It can be inferred, then, that jeans make a woman look like a man. Another spokesman has said, in the same context, that women should not behave in a way that attracts undesirable male attention. It is not clear from this whether all male attention is undesirable, but that is a separate issue. The point is that women in jeans would attract undesirable male attention, and that is bad. Now the question is: would the woman in jeans attract male attention because she looks like a woman in jeans, or because she looks like a man although she is a woman in jeans? It is an intriguing conundrum, raising the further question whether the wise men dictating dress codes actually know what they are talking about. They must be innocent of the impolite implications of the conflicting explanations.

 The Darul Uloom has said that this fatwa is not binding, but merely the response to a specific question. But that hardly matters, feels a section of angry students. With the fatwa in the air, religious heads would be free to victimize girls for their apparel. The absurdity of such diktats is best brought out by the other responses. Well-meaning objections fall into the same trap of evoking unspoken rules for female dress. One says it does not matter what a woman wears as long as she is decently attired. Another goes into great length to explain how the thick material of the jeans is an especially decent covering. Whoever was worried about decent covering for men? They are free to urinate at any public place they want. Round and round go diktat and response, without anyone mentioning that it is the exposure of the shape of the legs and back that is rendering the wise men nerveless. And ordinary men too: they are silent. It is only the women who are speaking up as best they can.

 Such folly is not religion-specific: The hullabaloo in West Bengal over women not being allowed to wear the salwar-kameez to college, whether they come to teach or learn, would demonstrate this. But India is a strange country, where against ten repressive control freaks there is always at least one visionary. In Murshidabad in West Bengal, Anwarul Haque Ansari has donated six acres of his land for the building of a school for girls, because he thinks Muslim girls need greater opportunities for education. It is hardly likely that moronic debates as the one over jeans will endure for too long.

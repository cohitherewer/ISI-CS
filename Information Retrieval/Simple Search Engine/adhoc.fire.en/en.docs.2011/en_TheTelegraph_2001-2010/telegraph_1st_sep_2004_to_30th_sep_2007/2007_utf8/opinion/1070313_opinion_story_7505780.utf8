 INNOCENCE AND EXPERIENCE AT PLAY

 India has one of the youngest teams in the West Indies right now. But youth has seldom been a virtue in the World Cup, writes Sreyashi Dastidar

 Clive Lloyd with the Prudential Cup, 1975

 The year was 1975. The event: the final of the first World Cup (Prudential Cup if you like), between Australia and West Indies at Lords. West Indies, put in to bat first, were struggling at 50 for 3, when Clive Lloyd limbered in to join Rohan Kanhai. The next 36 overs and the outcome of the match as well were scripted by the 31-year-old Lloyd and 40-year-old Kanhai with a 149-run partnership.

 Eight years later. India faced the West Indies which had four players from the 1975 squad in the 1983 World Cup final. The details of the match are too well known to be summoned here again, but for two trivial facts. Mohinder Amarnath, man of the final, with figures of 3 for 12 and a breezy 26, was 33 years old. Also, Kapil Dev, all of 24 years, led into the post-lunch field ten men, only two of whom were younger than him. 

 Fast forward to 2003. Another World Cup final, this time between India and Australia. The Indians let the Aussies pile up a huge 359, only to surrender meekly for 234. Did Sourav Gangulys boys choke under pressure? After all, they were up against a team which had eight players over 30 and none below 27, while India had five who were 25 or less and only four past 30.

 There is no reason in particular behind the choice of these three finals. In other words, these are not the only examples which can be used to argue in favour of older and more experienced players in World Cup cricket. But few people today in India at least are willing to adopt this line of thought. Greg Chappell certainly isnt. From the day he took over as the Indian coach, he has made no secret of his wish to dispense with older players unless they produce superlative scores or fiery spells at every outing. It is better to lose with young players, wholl learn as they go on, he believes. There have indeed been such losses, most notably against the shadows-of-the-past West Indies and South Africa in 2006 and 2006-07 respectively, and in the ICC Champions Trophy last year. Notwithstanding these irritants, Chappell goes into this World Cup with exactly what he wanted: one of the youngest teams in the tournament, with 27.72 years as the mean age of its members. Only Zimbabwe and Bangladesh have more players under 25 years, and had it not been for the recall of Ganguly, India would have had the least number of players who have crossed 30.

 But the question is: Is it prudent to put youth above all else in a stage such as the World Cup? 

 World Cup cricket in this respect is very different from the football World Cup, where teams with an average age of over 28 usually find themselves at a disadvantage. France and Italy upset many a calculation in 2006, reaching the finals with teams exceeding this magic mean. Cricket World Cups do not give birth to future stars in the way soccer World Cups do. A look at the list of Golden Ball winners since 1982 shows that Oliver Kahn, who was 33 in 2002, and Zinedine Zidane, 34 in 2006, were the only two players over 26 to have won the title. On the other hand, four man-of-the-match awards in the eight cricket World Cup finals played so far have gone to thirty-plus cricketers Lloyd in 1975, Amarnath in 1979, Aravinda De Silva in 1996 and Shane Warne in 1999. No cricketer under 27 has won the man-of-the-match award in a World Cup final or the man of the tournament award.

 The reality is something like this. World Cup cricket, or for that matter limited-overs cricket, is not ideally suited for the exuberance of youth, although popular belief has always equated it with speed and energy and test cricket with laid-backness and maturity. But one-day cricket has always been and surprisingly, still is tilted in favour of experienced, calculating players, whether Greg Chappell likes it or not. In that memorable final of 1975, when Lloyd joined Kanhai at the crease, the latter played 11 overs without scoring a single run, taking on the completely uncharacteristic role of a sheet anchor, letting Lloyd do all the talking. Is it possible to visualize Mahendra Singh Dhoni or Kevin Pietersen in a similar role? 

 Faculty members of the Chappell School of Cricket would perhaps have us believe that there is no place for the sheet anchor in modern cricket. Or that any batsman can play that role, irrespective of his experience. But during his time with the Men in Blue, Chappell must have noticed the many batting debacles caused by young and restless cricketers inability to remain glued to the crease. Restlessness does not work in one-day cricket any better than it does in tests. And it always pays to have hardened warhorses on board just in case Duckworth-Lewis comes into play this rain-law could easily drive a very young eleven to dementia.

 One of the most stunning facts about the 2007 World Cup is that as many as seven of Englands final fifteen are 26 years old or less. A young English team is almost unthinkable. Sunil Gavaskar had once famously joked that it would have taken him at least five years more to make his debut in international cricket, had he been born in England. But as in so many other things, Englands erstwhile colonies the subcontinent, which prefers throwing its cricketers into the deep end while they are still wet behind the ears are changing the ways of English cricket too. More eyes will be trained this time on Ravinder Bopara, Monty Panesar or Sajid Mahmood than on their Brit teammates.

 The charge of the English boy-brigade is in some ways more shocking than the fact that 11 in the Australian fifteen are 30 or more. Australia has always been comfortable with ageing players, partly because they have all been supremely fit. The only year when they seemed to regret having too many of the previous World Cups veterans was 1992. The wise cricket-follower never takes pundits seriously, but an overwhelming majority of former cricketers would not have wagered for Australia if its greying was a serious handicap. There are teams which are greyer still Canada, Bermuda, the Netherlands, for instance - but they are in the tournament only because Pierre de Coubertin said participation is more important than winning. But these are also teams where the oldest and the youngest cricketers are separated by almost a generation. Then theres the case of Zimbabwe. The number of one-dayers played by its entire team would perhaps fall short of the number of ODIs Sourav Ganguly has played as captain. Here, the predominance of young players seems less of a choice than a result of limited options. 

 The changing conditions for playing cricket down the decades have restricted options gradually. In fact, the game as it is played today demands calculating, mathematical brains more than ever before. A team full of youngsters may excel on the ground, taking impossible catches, and stopping boundaries (although there is no way to prove that older players make for sluggish fielders), but it will falter and fumble to modulate its game to fox an experienced side. But again, age and experience are not synonymous in this context. The Australian team goes through a shuffle every now and then, and thus, even with older players, has a lesser aggregate of match experience than India, whose selection policy encourages a player to defend his place in the side for longer. 

 And look at how many have defended their place from the last World Cup. Nine. Other than Robin Uthappa, S. Sreesanth, Irfan Pathan, Munaf Patel, Dhoni and Dinesh Karthik, everybody else in the current squad featured in the team that went to South Africa in 2003. In fact, the four seniors were there in 1999 as well. So what are we talking about when we say that India in 2007 is full of young blood, and proceed to thank Chappell for his services? Is young really young after all?

 It is not possible to establish a direct correlation between age and cricketing success. More importantly, it is not necessary to try to make a connection between the two. A fiery Adam Gilchrist is just as delightful as a blazing Kevin Pietersen, and a hattrick by Mutthiah Muralitharan as exhilarating as a five-wicket haul by Monty Panesar. 

 Is there a prescription for the right age-mix? If there is, the snickometers havent spotted it yet. Which is why it will never be known before the World Cup whether a team has struck the winning combination. The only thing that can be said with some certainty is that a bunch of fit but thirty-plus players is more likely to enhance rather than damage a teams prospects. (It may be argued that, with cricket being played all the year round, holding on to ones fitness is not an easy task. But that is a different debate, meant for another time.) What remains is this. Experience can never be a drawback, but youth can sometimes become its own enemy. Besides, it is always a greater pleasure to watch an ageing heros final blast than a young turks boastful entry.

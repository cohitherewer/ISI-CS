 LIQUIDITY MOP

 The Reserve Bank of India sprang a surprise in its quarterly monetary policy review today, without making it a painful one. By focusing the policy measures on managing the excessive liquidity in the financial system, the RBI governor, Y.V. Reddy, left the possibility of maintaining the growth momentum intact. Industry and the banking sector should be happy with the central banks approach that ensured that there would be enough liquidity in the financial system to keep economic growth going at a robust pace. The monetary tightening, limited though it is, is in line with the actions taken by central banks in Japan, China and other developed and emerging market countries. Global liquidity management is a concern for central banks around the world, and the policy measures announced today reflect similar views in the Indian context. There were just two measures: a half percentage point increase in cash reserve requirements, and a removal of the cap on the liquidity adjustment facility, used by banks to manage their surplus liquidity. Both measures are likely to have the desired effect of tightening liquidity without impacting capital inflows.

 The CRR increase will absorb about Rs 16,000 crores of the anecdotally estimated Rs 75,000 crores of surplus liquidity in the banking system. By removing the cap on the amount of money that the central bank could absorb through the LAF, interest rates in the inter-bank money market will return to more realistic rates in the corridor between the reverse repo (6 per cent) and repo (7.75 per cent) rates. Public sector banks will be the immediate beneficiaries of this measure, being able to generate better returns on their cash holdings than the 0.5 per cent that has prevailed for the last few months. The rest of the interest rate structure both on deposits and loans is likely to be unaffected. On the flip side, the RBIs nervousness about global liquidity movements and the behaviour of equity markets was also reflected in the policy statement: Mr Reddy was at pains to underscore the risks to financial stability from sudden and large capital flows (inward or outward) in the next few months that could stem from volatility in the equity markets. Despite record increases in investment and savings growth rates, it is odd that an economy that is growing at 10 per cent cannot absorb the liquidity in the system. The RBI has done its part in managing the liquidity problem. Hopefully, industry and the banking system will do theirs.

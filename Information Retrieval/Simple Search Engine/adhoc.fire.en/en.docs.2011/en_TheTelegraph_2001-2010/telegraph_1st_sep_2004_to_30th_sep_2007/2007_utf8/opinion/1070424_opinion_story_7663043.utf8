The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Public drama 

Kiss and sell

 Sir The huge fuss made over Richard Geres kiss to Shilpa Shetty was unwarranted (Burning, but with jealousy, April 16). This excessive response reveals, once again, the terrible narrow-mindedness of most Indians. Yet, it is not as if Indians are a prudish people. As The Telegraph survey revealed, Indians have more sex than the global average; many girls have also admitted their desire to kiss their favourite actors. Then what is so inherently wrong about a playful peck of the cheek in a public forum? What seemed even more ridiculous was Rakhi Sawants disapproval of the kiss. She must be singularly devoid of any sense of irony to have said this, given her reputation as one of the raunchiest item girls in Bollywood. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jayantabishnu Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir Filmstars and models are perhaps not the best people to lead AIDS awareness campaigns. After all, they are the ones who are found, most often in Hollywood and Bollywood movies, dressed up provocatively or enacting sexually intimate scenes. If these celebrities do not hesitate in selling themselves as sex symbols to the public, how can they possibly be considered as the exemplars of virtue by the fans who are titilated by them?

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Shilpa Shetty may have been right in defending Richard Geres kiss by pointing out the latters unfamiliarity with Indian customs. However, there was no reason for Shetty to forget that she is an Indian and that public displays of affection in our country could have strong repercussions. Undeniably, Shetty belongs to the elite society where a kiss is just a kiss. But her recent success in the Celebrity Big Brother has also revealed her as someone using sensationalism as a way of self-promotion. Therefore, the outcry raised by the religious and political parties over Gere and her is somewhat misdirected. Shetty should not be treated as a traditional Indian woman who is aware of what is permissible and what is censured in her land.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir It is absurd for Rakhi Sawant, whose only claim to fame is as a Bollywood sex goddess, to complain about Richard Gere kissing Shilpa Shetty. Shettys recent triumph in the house of Big Brother seems to have gone into her head. She seems to think, and rightly so, that she will get away with everything, everywhere. The custodians of law and order, who routinely harrass couples for public displays of affection, are probably not going to take any action against her. India seems to have two sets of law one for erring celebrities (Sanjay Dutt Salman Khan are glaring examples) and the other for the common man.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Shilpa Shetty is a shrewd operator. She made her millions by selling her victimhood to the world at the Celebrity Big Brother, now she is again in the news for all the wrong reasons.

 Sir There is nothing wrong in the diplay of affection, but doing so in public, particularly before an audience of Indian truck-drivers, during an AIDS awareness campaign is not quite acceptable. Shetty has said that as actor, her job is to entertain. But that does not give her the license to do whatever she fancies. Apparently, she allowed Gere to kiss her because she didnt want a foreigner to go back with bad memories. Does it mean that foreigners are to be made happy at the expense of our tradition, ethics and culture? 

 Yours faithfully,

Sitima Singha, Serampur

 Sir It is shameful the way Indians have shot back at Shilpa Shetty and Richard Gere. What Gere is doing for the country by participating in our social service programmes should be the concern of the people and media, who are busy making sweeping judgments about his character.

 Yours faithfully,

Nandini Saraf, Calcutta

 Sir Indians seem to have forgotten that Richard Gere was present on the stage with Shilpa Shetty to raise awareness on AIDS, not because he wanted to kiss her before a group of truckdrivers. Geres original intention has now become irrelevant.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir The Bollywood actor, Shilpa Shetty, had won the Big Brother competition by flaunting certain qualities that were supposed to represent Indianness. Now that she has made enough money and name, she has become indifferent towards Indian customs. Geres kiss to Shetty would have gone unnoticed had the venue been a fashion show or a Page 3 party. Gere, who has been a frequent visitor to India, should have been aware of what is allowed in Indian culture. Shetty later defended the kiss by saying that it was meant to entertain the audience. I wonder how much time was actually spent in discussing AIDS awareness, and how much on song and dance. I dont think the audience comprising truck-drivers mainly will remember much about AIDS prevention, but they will not forget the kiss in a hurry 

 Yours faithfully,

Anushyuta Basu, Calcutta

 Sir After Richard Gere kissed Shilpa Shetty at an AIDS awareness programme for truck-drivers, the country broke out in protest. The way the media reported the kiss was certain to provoke such an outburst. Gere kissed Shilpa because he was not aware of Indian traditions. He even apologized for having offended some sections of Indians. It is amazing that despite all attempts at reparations, the media decided to turn this incident into a major scandal.

 Yours faithfully,

Shailesh Kumar, Bangalore 

 Sir It is not surprising that the saffronites have lost all sense of proportion as the custodians of Indian tradition and values. Not only did they troop out on the streets because Richard Gere had kissed Shilpa Shetty, but they also vandalize the office of STAR News for airing a story about an inter-communal marriage. That a kiss could assume such momentous significance in India the land of Kamasutra, Khajuraho and Konark is shocking, to say the least. The hate speeches and effigy-burnings go on to show how abysmally uneducated and uncivilized these protectors of our culture are.

 Yours faithfully,

Partha Sarathi Sen, Calcutta

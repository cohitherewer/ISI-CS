The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 THERE AT LAST

 Signatures are yet to be put on the nuclear deal between India and the United States of America, but for all practical purposes the deal is done. The mandarins on both sides have talked for innumerable hours to iron out the differences, and the stage is set for the deal to be signed and sealed. It was made possible with the passage of the Henry J. Hyde United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Act of 2006 through both Houses of the American Congress. The Indo-US nuclear deal actually marks a new and unprecedented high in the relationship between the two countries. This relationship has not always been smooth. The ideological orientation of Indias foreign policy under Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi was pronouncedly anti-US. The US, for its own geopolitical reasons, supported military regimes in Pakistan. Indias policy towards the US changed dramatically under P.V. Narasimha Rao, and the attitude of the US towards India underwent a radical transformation in the aftermath of 9/11. This is the overarching context of the special treatment that New Delhi is now receiving from the US. That the treatment is special is undeniable. This is the first time that Washington has made such an exception in its non-proliferation policy for any country. Also, special care has been taken not to jeopardize Indias strategic autonomy or to compromise the countrys nuclear deterrent capability.

 As it stands now, the special relationship expresses, in some fundamental ways, exactly what India had been negotiating for. India retains the right to reprocess spent fuel from civilian nuclear reactors. There are also fuel assurances from the US side, even though those assurances are very carefully, if not delicately, worded. The support of the US will be critical for Indias access to nuclear fuel and for influencing the Nuclear Suppliers Group. The new understanding therefore has a two-fold significance. One is the obvious advantage that it brings to Indias nuclear programme. The other is the broader advantage that India gets because of its clear closeness to the US. India can now claim with some justification that it can sit at the international high table. These are the reasons why the cabinet committee on security, when it meets, needs to endorse and welcome the deal in no uncertain terms. India has come in from beyond the pale.

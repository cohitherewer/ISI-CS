 OLD AND NEW LOYALTIES

 GWYNNE DYER 

 It has not been Turkeys week. Nicolas Sarkozy, who won the French presidency on Sunday, has promised to block the Turkish attempt to join the European Union, and he will be in office until 2013. On Monday, the domestic crisis in Turkey ended in a defeat for the ruling AK Party, even though it holds almost two-thirds of the seats in parliament. Its candidate for the presidency has withdrawn in the face of warnings from the army that nobody whose wife wears a head-scarf should occupy the office, and there will be early general elections in July. 

 It was already clear that Turkey wasnt joining the EU soon, because the German and Austrian governments are against it. With Turkeys economy turning in sustained growth three times higher than the average western European economy, this doesnt make the Turks lose much sleep any more. They are angry at what they see as anti-Muslim discrimination, but most are willing to let the talks on entry continue: they were not due to be completed before 2013 anyway.

 As for the domestic crisis, thats about Islam too, except that in this case it is the secular establishment in Turkey itself which doesnt trust the Muslims. The ruling AK Party is a moderate Islamic party that accepts pluralism and the secular state its members often call themselves Muslim Democrats, making a conscious link with the Christian Democratic parties of Europe but the army and other the self-appointed guardians of secularism refuse to take them at their word.

 Its often about symbols, like the head-scarves worn by the wife and daughter of Abdullah Gul, the current foreign minister and the AK Partys candidate for the presidency, until last Monday. As a legacy of the time when Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the Turkish republic, was forcing his country to drop its old Ottoman ways and dragging it into Europe, the Turkish legal system is littered with laws that ban displays of Islamic identity, like the one that bars women wearing head-scarves from entering government buildings.

 Lost in transition 

 Fewer than 10 per cent of the Turks say that they want an Islamic state with sharia law. Its really about getting the State to be neutral on religious issues, and not being actively anti-religious. Its about modernization. Its the Muslim Democrats who are trying to modernize the Turkish state, and the old republican establishment in the army, the bureaucracy and the judiciary are trying to stop them. Hence the crisis of the past few weeks, with the opposition parties boycotting parliament in order to deprive it of the quorum that is needed for the election of a president, and the army muttering about its solid determination to uphold the law meaning, we are left to assume, the law banning head-scarves in government buildings, including the presidential mansion.

 The AK Party is certain to win the July election, not just because of its economic record but also because of the democratic reforms it has forced through, as part of its effort to make Turkey a suitable candidate for the EU membership. It has also introduced a constitutional amendment that would allow the president to be chosen by direct popular vote, thus getting around the possibility of another boycott of an AK Party candidate in the next parliament.

 There is nothing particularly Islamic about the struggle that is going on in Turkey now. It has ample precedents in Europe, where a number of countries went through a lengthy period, in the late 19th- and early 20th centuries, when the governments were strongly anti-clerical. After the enemies of modernization were defeated, they could allow religious parties to re-enter politics.

 That is the point that Turkey has now reached. Democracy has taken firm root and the economy has been modernized. Its time to stop fighting the old battles and let religious people participate openly in politics.

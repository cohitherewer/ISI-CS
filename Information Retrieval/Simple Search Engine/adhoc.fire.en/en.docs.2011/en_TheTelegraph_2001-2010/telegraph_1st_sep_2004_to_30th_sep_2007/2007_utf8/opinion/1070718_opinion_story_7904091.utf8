The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 PERIL ON THE STREETS 

 FIFTH COLUMN

 Tumpa Mukherjee

 A few days ago, a hotel management 

 student who had stood up to youths harassing a young girl 

 on a bus was beaten up and thrown out of the vehicle by 

 the miscreants. The incident proved once again that Calcutta, 

 like most other Indian cities, is no longer safe for women, 

 or for men who protest against such forms of harassment.

 Women in Calcutta are particularly 

 vulnerable to such crimes in certain parts of the city. 

 For instance, it is not uncommon to see groups of young 

 men hooting, whistling or passing lewd remarks at women 

 in and around Southern Avenue, Esplanade, the Maidan, Ballygunge 

 Place, Salt Lake and so on.

 Often, nobody protests against 

 such incidents. On many occasions, these crimes also go 

 unreported as very few women turn up at police stations 

 to lodge a complaint. Worse, harassment of women is often 

 glorified in cinema. For instance, in Hindi films, it is 

 not uncommon to find the hero resorting to teasing to win 

 the heart of his lady love. Such gestures are nothing but 

 a crude expression of masculinity in a patriarchal set-up 

 where a man is supposed to be superior to a woman.

 Harassment in a public space often 

 creates a sense of fear in the victim, thereby damaging 

 her self-esteem. Unfortunately, it is difficult to rid society 

 of this malaise. Mobilizing women to raise their voice against 

 atrocities is a difficult task, considering the fact that 

 women in India are made to think that such problems are 

 normal and a part of life. 

 Social scientists have prescribed 

 gender sensitization as a possible solution. Gender segregation, 

 they say, is not a policy that should be encouraged or practised. 

 Instead, they have been advocating Life Skill education 

 classes in schools that will help boys and girls break myths 

 surrounding human sexuality.

 Safety first

 Not just schools but families 

 too have an important role to play in this context. Parents 

 should educate their children about sex from an early stage. 

 It would also be a good idea for them to send girl children 

 to take self-defence lessons. The media should also be careful 

 while depicting human pain and misery and stop glamorizing 

 violence against women.

 Interestingly, in Defensible 

 Space, Oscar Newsman points out the impact that architecture 

 and planning have had on social problems. Some buildings 

 are constructed like impersonal spaces, the inadequate lighting 

 and lack of surveillance encouraging anti-social activities. 

 There is need for new research to establish the correlation 

 between architecture and crime in order to guide intervention 

 efforts. 

 Increasing surveillance can be 

 another way of checking harassment. For this purpose, police 

 patrols, comprising both men and women personnel, should 

 be constituted and deployed in different parts of the city. 

 There is also the case for the police cooperating with private 

 security guards to keep an eye on criminal activities. This 

 is especially important in a city like Calcutta where rapid 

 urbanization has drastically changed the architectural and 

 social landscape. 

 Moreover, in Calcutta, community 

 living manifest in the form of para culture is gradually 

 on the decline. Therefore, it is imperative to set up neighbourhood 

 watch groups to maintain strict vigilance and operate as 

 pressure groups within the locality. 

 As far as the law is concerned, 

 harassment of women in public should be made a non-bailable 

 offence. The law should also ensure that exemplary punishment 

 is meted out to the culprits. There is a bill that has been 

 drafted to combat harassment of women. However, merely enacting 

 laws will not help in reversing the present situation. The 

 attitude and mindset of the people have to change as well. 

 Otherwise, Indias cities will continue to remain unsafe 

 for women.

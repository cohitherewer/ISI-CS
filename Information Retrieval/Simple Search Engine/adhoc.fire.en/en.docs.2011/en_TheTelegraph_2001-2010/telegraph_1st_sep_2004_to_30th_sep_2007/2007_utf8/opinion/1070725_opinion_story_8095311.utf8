 WORDCAGE

 Your wordcager left Los Angeles 

 airport for Britain last week in a state of spitting rage. 

 Was it possible, he asked himself, and those waiting wearily 

 in the line with him, that the worlds most advanced, 

 get-up-and-go nation could run its security screening with 

 a bureaucratic sluggishness that would have won medals at 

 Moscow airport in the days of Brezhnev?

 It was. The local chapter of the Transportation Security 

 Administration had evidently decided that peak hour on a 

 Monday morning was just the time to train some optically-challenged 

 neophyte in the art of spotting explosive toothpaste tubes 

 and lethal half-inch nail-clippers on an X-ray machine, 

 possibly built to Congolese quality standards and maintained 

 by Albanians.

 And then, as the clock ticked 

 inexorably forward, but the weary queue did not, the American 

 behind me proposed a simple way out: duck under a barrier, 

 join the parallel but swiftly advancing line of passengers 

 alongside, and Id be away. I did, and I was. The parallel 

 queue accepted me with the courtesy that comes so naturally 

 to Americans. The new screeners looked no different, nor 

 did the X-ray machine, but forward swiftly we went.

 A change of planes at Boston went 

 more swiftly still. For me, at least. A Sikh gentleman and 

 his wife had some difficulty in persuading the screeners 

 that her kilo or two of gold bangles were neither a self-assembly 

 kirpan nor a crafty Asian device for money-laundering; 

 and in being persuaded that she could put them under the 

 X-ray machine and expect to find as many bangles come out 

 of the tunnel as went in. But that culture-clash aside, 

 get-up-and-go the process was.

 Melting pot

 In the departure lounge, I had 

 ample time to theorize how closely American behaviour is 

 mirrored by American language. No English-speakers Ill 

 correct that: none west of south Asia have so enthusiastically 

 stifled our language with jargon, bureaucratic obscurity 

 and a determination never to use one word where six will 

 do. Yet none have so enriched it, with shoot-from-the-hip 

 slang, neologisms and novel turns of phrase. The worst American 

 prose has the encrusted deadness of a catacomb; the best 

 has a springing, articulate vigour at worst, the unexpectedness 

 of the same catacomb brought back to life in a horror movie. 

 The very phrases that we love to mock in American officialese 

 are small gems of invention: who else could have dreamed 

 up extraordinary rendition to mask the reality of 

 people being flown around to be tortured?

 I dont think this is an accident. 

 Americans are not hidebound, as Britons are, by centuries 

 of convention, in behaviour as in language. Britain (like 

 India), for much of its history, has been a society where 

 each man knew his place. In the American melting-pot, no 

 man was very sure of that; and, if he saw it and disliked 

 what he saw, he felt free, and often was free, to alter 

 it. In such a society, the extremes of conduct are more 

 likely. And, I suggest, the extremes of language too: verbosity 

 and jargon on one side, invention, slang and gangsta-rap 

 on the other. And Americans variegated linguistic background 

 must have played its part.

 What, if anything, does this suggest 

 for the future of English in India? English was, and largely 

 still is, a foreign tongue. Indians came, and come, to it 

 from a varied linguistic context, but also in a society 

 whose ancient hierarchies have only very recently begun 

 to break down, and where the superstructure of those hierarchies, 

 albeit insecurely bolted on, was formed until 1947 by foreigners 

 speaking that tongue. It was natural that early Indian English 

 should be modelled on that of the British. I would expect 

 the novelties of behaviour now open to Indians to be vigorously 

 reflected in Indian English. But I speak from outside.

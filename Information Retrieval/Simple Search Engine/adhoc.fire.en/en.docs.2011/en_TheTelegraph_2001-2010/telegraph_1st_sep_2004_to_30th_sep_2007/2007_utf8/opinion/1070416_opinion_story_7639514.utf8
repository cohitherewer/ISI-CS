 Territorial anxiety

 Anxious protector

 Sir The executive and the legislative organs of the State have often misused the powers vested in them. The Centre has forcibly gone ahead with its policy of reservation in educational institutions in spite of overwhelming protests from all corners of the country; tried to reduce the scope of the Right to Information Act, while its ministry of information and broadcasting has repeatedly tried to stifle citizens freedom of expression with its moral policing. Legislators have manipulated laws to their own advantage, as in the case involving offices of profit. Unfortunately, the judiciary, instead of contesting such questionable policies, has, in most cases, simply toed the line of the legislature and the executive, accelerating the countrys decline into chaos. But certain recent judgments of the Supreme Court, especially the recent one overruling reservation, have challenged the hitherto uncontested power of the Centre. The prime ministers advice to the judiciary to stay within its limits reflects the growing anxiety of the executive about these perceived threats to its authority (Singh sermon to court on limits, April 9). Manmohan Singhs ire and what it implies should, however, make the ordinary man happy. With corruption tainting the highest governing bodies, Indians can at least look up to an impartial judiciary to protect their rights. 

 Yours faithfully,

Amit Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir The prime minister has reacted to the judiciarys growing powers in the way in which weak and inefficient people react when faced with their own incompetence. They would rather blame others than acknowledge their own faults. The party which wields power at the Centre has been currying favour with a few communities to further its own electoral prospects instead of ensuring equal opportunities for all. If the executive had its way, then deserving students would have had their hopes of getting into reputed institutions of higher studies dimmed considerably by the 27 per cent reservation rule. The Supreme Court, by overturning the decision, has provided relief to them. 

 Although Manmohan Singh had once pledged development with a human face, his actions have failed to match the promise. As the Central government does not think of the people, people have no option but to take the help of the judiciary. And the judiciary has been doing a commendable job in its twin roles as the protector of the Constitution and a regulator of the executive. Since Singh himself has failed in his duties, he has no right to criticize the judiciary. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Kamat, Alto Benim, Goa

 Sir Manmohan Singh is justified in asking the judiciary not to overstep its limits. The executive will be unable to take any policy decisions if the judiciary is waiting to foil its attempts at every step. In fact, both the judiciary and the legislature need to be made accountable to each other. The media and the citizens should also have the right to assess the functioning of the judiciary. Since judges are only human, it would be better if their rulings are considered less than infallible. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir I wonder how a learned man like Manmohan Singh can ask the judiciary not to over-reach its mandate, when by common consensus it is the ministers of the executive who have repeatedly overreached the limits of their office, while the judiciary has tried to bring back some semblance of order in a chaotic system. 

 Yours faithfully,

Gauranga Bhattacharya, West Midnapur

 Sir Manmohan Singh has found the judiciary venturing beyond its limits only when it has trod on the concerns of the executive over the reservation issue. Singhs comments give away his insecurities, and those of his party, all too clearly. 

 Yours faithfully,

J.N. Mahanty, Puri

 Sir It is true, as mentioned in the editorial, Fine balance (April 10), that Indian parliamentary practices are derived from Britain, where controversies over the rights of the legislature, executive and judiciary never arise. But it needs to be remembered that the Indian political scene is quite different from that of Britain. Politicians there are less selfish and more committed than their Indian counterparts. Indian politicians, after gaining control over the executive and the legislature, now want to extend their influence over the judiciary as well. It is good to see the judiciary holding its own.

 Yours faithfully,

B.B. Kar, Calcutta

 Sir It would have been easy to say that judicial activism is good neither for society nor for the judiciary, if the legislature and the executive had set up a model of good governance in India. Hopefully, the judiciary will realize that the prime ministers remarks were made under much duress.

 Yours faithfully,

Jayanta Kumar Dutt, Calcutta

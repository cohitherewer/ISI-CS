 Spare none

 Sir The Supreme Court directive, making it incumbent upon educational institutions to file a first information report if an incident of ragging is brought to their notice, would be welcomed enthusiastically by students (Spare ragging rod, spoil flow of cash, May 17). By imposing a personal liability on institute heads, the Supreme Court has ensured that they can no longer fiddle with students lives by disclaiming responsibility. In all cases of ragging, what is perhaps more disturbing than the recklessness of the culprits is the apathy of the authorities concerned. Victims and their parents despair of ever getting justice from educational institutions. The latter have, as it were, institutionalized this crime by repeatedly choosing to ignore it. By holding the authorities as culpable as the perpetrators, the Supreme Court has taken an important step in making educational institutions safer. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir The politicization of education has made the problem of ragging worse (Rag and bone, May 18). Since principals, teachers and students, including those guilty of harassing their juniors, often owe allegiance to the same political party, information about ragging end up being suppressed. It is a relief that the Supreme Court has chosen to intervene to put an end to the menace. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govinda Bakshi, Budge Budge

 Sir Educational institutions choose to sweep complaints against ragging under the carpet because they are wary of students unions as well as of the possibility of their reputation being tarnished. The apex court has now made sure that they will act by asking state governments to stop the flow of funds to institutes that fail to take appropriate action against the offenders. State governments should implement the Raghavan committees recommendation and make ragging a separate offence in itself. The institutions should also follow the court order and expel the offenders, even if they have connections in the high places. The punishment would be complete if other colleges deny the wrongdoers admission. Ragging will end only if educational authorities do their best to comply with the court order. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mithun Kanungo, Calcutta

 Sir No society that claims to be civilized should tolerate ragging in schools and colleges. The Supreme Court ruling is rightly timed since one has long felt the need of ridding new students of the fear that grips them in the early weeks of every academic year. It is equally necessary for students, many of whom might be leaders of the future, to honour individual rights and treat a fellow-student in an amicable way. 

 Yours faithfully,

K.S. Jayatheertha, Bangalore

 Sir The tension caused by ragging has caused many on-campus clashes and has, at times, resulted in the death of juniors. The apex court order, will hopefully put an end to all this.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir It is an honour for West Bengal to have become the first state in which the Supreme Court order against ragging is being implemented. Ramakrishna Shilpa Vidyapith, the college in which Sarojit Biswas studied and which he quit after being tortured by his seniors, has been made to suspend the students named in the FIR filed by Sarojits brother (College axe falls on ragging 6, May 20). The seniors had allegedly forced Sarojit to inhale smoke, scalded him with cigarette butts and banged his head against a wall. It is unfortunate that students choose to harass their juniors when they should be welcoming them. Since the students who abused Sarojit seem to lack the simplest decency, they deserve to be expelled from college. 

 Yours faithfully,

Lubna Salim, Calcutta

 Sir The practice of ragging has caused many a fresher to discontinue with studies. This is only to be expected, what with the new-comer being subjected to mental and physical torture from the first day in college. While the Supreme Court order will no doubt act as a deterrent to those who engage in this inhuman routine, what is more important is that the abusive students be taught humane values. There should be classes in the first six months of every academic year to inculcate the values of cooperation and tolerance in students. I think this will be more effective in the long run than a harsh system of punishment. 

 Yours faithfully,

Salil Gewali, Shillong

 Sir Although ragging has had some fatal consequences, making it an offence punishable by the law is perhaps too severe a decision. In its original, unspoilt form, ragging remains one of the best methods of making freshers get acquainted with their seniors and vice versa. In order to remove the sinister tinge from the practice of ragging, colleges and universities can open a week before the session starts so that new entrants can spend some time knowing one another and their seniors. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir We had never heard of ragging when we were students about six decades ago. This vice is peculiar to modern culture and is symptomatic of the overall erosion of social values. 

 Yours faithfully,

B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore 

 Sir Ragging has exposed the flaws in the education system, which may be producing academically brilliant students, but has failed to inculcate the right values in them. More emphasis should be laid on value-based education.

 Yours faithfully,

Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

 ACCURSED POWER 

 - How kings come and go when its convenient for others 

 SUNANDA K. DATTA-RAY

 Zahir Shah (centre) 

 with Hamid Karzai and Manmohan Singh, 2005 

 Kings are not in fashion. Certainly 

 not while alive and reigning. When dead, its another matter 

 as the obsequies of Afghanistans Mohammed Zahir Shah demonstrated. 

 The rapture with which he was greeted after 29 years of 

 exile and the mourning at his passing recalled Charles IIs 

 remark at the Restoration, I doubt it has been my fault, 

 that I have been absent so long for I see nobody that does 

 not protest he has ever wished for my return. 

 However fervently Afghans may 

 have welcomed Zahir Shah back in 2002, it was not theirs 

 to restore him to his throne. The Great Game removed him, 

 through the agency of his army commander who was also his 

 cousin and brother-in-law. For all that George W. Bush now 

 calls him a monumental figure in Afghan history, the monument 

 was no more popular with the Americans than Saddam Husseins 

 statue in Baghdad. The king was too neutral, too friendly 

 with the Soviet Union and too cordial to India during his 

 40-year reign. As the Pakistanis shrewdly noted, an Indian 

 proposal that he be reinstated when Afghanistan was a land 

 in search of a government was enough to seal his fate. The 

 Great Game demanded a mujahedin to be deployed against 

 the Soviets, never mind if it bred Osama bin Laden, al Qaida 

 and taliban. 

 If kings suggest tyranny and righteous 

 popular uprisings, that is only because we are emotional 

 and intellectual prisoners of the French Revolution. Embedded 

 in the popular unconscious is the conviction that the Jacobins 

 were the peoples liberators and the guillotine the cure 

 for despotism. The Romanov familys fate confirmed that 

 impression of royalty coming by its just deserts at the 

 hands of a desperately exploited and at last awakened peasantry. 

 Regicide was confirmed as the first rite of democracy, subsequent 

 massacres of royalty in Iraq and Yemen reinforcing that 

 lesson even though we would much rather seek our historical 

 allegories in Europe than in the Middle East we exalt as 

 west Asia. 

 Zahir Shahs fall in 1973 moved 

 All India Radios Debdulal Bandopadhyay to emotional chanting 

 in Bengali about autocrats destined for disaster. That was 

 because a mini Great Game was under way nearer home. Its 

 official authors wrote the script Bandopadhyay recited. 

 Sikkims chogyal had to be got rid of then, and even 

 if Kabul didnt provide a blueprint for Gangtok, it supplied 

 New Delhi with an immediate precedent. So the singing and 

 shuddering about thrones toppling in the dust, ending with 

 a dramatic, Oh chogyal! Have you not learnt your lesson 

 yet?

 The propagandist theme of wicked 

 kings overlooked kindly old Zahir Shahs popularity with 

 his subjects. His sacrifice at the behest of superior forces 

 led to the train of fanaticism and violence that Hamid Karzai, 

 a puppet king in cap and cloak, is in no position to end. 

 The peoples revolution against the chogyal was equally 

 phoney, masking not realpolitik but petty politicking. Theres 

 another common factor. Deprived of his rightful title, Zahir 

 Shah was anointed Father of the Nation. Palden Thondup 

 Namgyal in adversity was declared the First Gentleman of 

 Sikkim.

 Of course, no such thing as divinity 

 doth hedge a king. No more than democracy doth infuse a 

 prime minister. When Indira Gandhi tried to soothe Zia-ul 

 Haqs ruffled feathers with the advice not to worry about 

 the papers because they were calling him a democrat and 

 her a dictator, the joke, alas, was on her. People dont 

 have to be born in the purple to be royal: Napoleon Bonaparte, 

 Reza Shah Pahlavi and Bokassa were all men who would be 

 king. Ayub Khan was reportedly another, persuaded by Zulfiqar 

 Ali Bhutto not to invent a crown. Thats one disclosure 

 that hasnt flowed from his sons pen.

 Yet, Gohar Ayub Khan need not 

 feel embarrassed about his fathers yearning, for kingship 

 is the story of man. Tribes need territory. Territory must 

 cohere to survive. The combination of people and land calls 

 for an identity. Imagined communities become tangible entities 

 when the nation state is synonymous with a person. Nepal 

 became a yam between two boulders only when Prithvinarayan 

 united all the principalities.

 Yugoslavia, now no more, was born 

 in 1918 as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. 

 The hereditary monarchy gave way after the World War II 

 to a Communist monarch whose white bemedalled uniforms, 

 sword of state and heavy make-up made him far more regal 

 than any Karageorgevich sovereign. Yugoslavia may not have 

 splintered if Josip Broz Tito had lived or been succeeded 

 by another resplendent Communist king. 

 Nor would Ethiopia have gained 

 independence after the war if it had not been for a total 

 identification with Haile Selassie whose stirring speech 

 to the League of Nations (The Ethiopian people are climbing 

 alone their road to Calvary) will be remembered when Mussolini 

 and his aggression are forgotten. The Lion of Judah, like 

 Zahir Shah, could not resist a global power: the Dergue 

 that overthrew him provided the Soviet Union with an African 

 foothold.

 In contrast, the hard-pressed 

 Communists who rule Laos have rediscovered Fa Ngum, 14th-century 

 creator of the Kingdom of the Million Elephants and White 

 Parasol. Five years ago they erected a huge bronze statue 

 of him in knee-length dhoti too! in Vientiane. 

 As for Laoss own last king, Savang Vatthana, he was sent 

 to a re-education camp in 1975 and never heard of again.

 If kings go when they become inconvenient 

 for more powerful others, they come when it is convenient 

 for others too. When Britain wanted to guard the route to 

 India and enjoy access to oil it created countries and foisted 

 on them as kings strangers who had fled the Arabian peninsula. 

 Syria quickly got rid of the Hashemite imposition; Iraq 

 did so half a century later; half-English Abdullah of Jordan 

 is the only surviving ruler of the land between the lines 

 Winston Churchill drew in the sand with a ruler and called 

 national boundaries. 

 By substituting election by the 

 powerless many for anointing by the powerful few, democracy 

 only provides a semblance of change. Everyone knows who 

 appointed Pratibha Patil. Malaysias head of state also 

 reigns for five years but rotates among the nine sultans 

 and carries the title, Yang di-Pertuan Agong (paramount 

 ruler). The United Arab Emirates has the best of all worlds. 

 Its president is elected but is always the Sheikh of Abu 

 Dhabi. Like the best of democracies, the UAE also elects 

 a vice-president and prime minister, but both jobs go to 

 the same person and he is always the Sheikh of Dubai. 

 Simeon, ex-tsar of Bulgaria, legitimately 

 bridged the gulf between hereditary right and democratic 

 politics by serving as elected prime minister for four years. 

 His feat did not pave the way for the thrones restoration 

 but was regarded as a historical first. Nearer home, Amarinder 

 Singh of Patiala repeated the performance in Punjab. 

 As for the future, with so many 

 Britons uneasy about Elizabeth IIs heirs, even Farouk of 

 Egypts royal quintet may look a trifle optimistic. The 

 immediate question is: Which ninepin will fall next? India 

 looks north. Where the Himalayas once held five kingdoms, 

 there are now only two, although Bhutans two kings make 

 for a total of three mountain monarchs. 

 The focus is on Nepal which offers 

 three royals to be toppled or retained Gyanendra, his 

 son Paras and five-year-old Hridayendra. If all three are 

 packed off, King Prachanda, whatever handle he might choose, 

 will complete the cycle from King Prithviraj, proving The 

 accursed power which stands on Privilege/ And goes with 

 women and champagne and bridge/ Broke and Democracy resumed 

 her reign/ Which goes with bridge and women and champagne.

 GUNS AND STARS 

 - The Bombay experience is a unique mishmash of film and reality 

 THE THIN EDGE

 Ruchir Joshi

 The Sanjay Dutt verdict scattered 

 like a shrapnel bomb among the people of India. Or, at least, 

 thats what it felt like when I came down to breakfast one 

 morning at a house where I was recently a guest. A fellow 

 guest, a Delhi lady, was lacing her toast with bitter tears 

 of rage as she read the details of Justice Kodes judgment. 

 How, she asked, can they do this to that poor chap?

 The lady, a distraught fan and 

 a lover of fair play, constructed her argument through her 

 toast, her papaya and her coffee: Sanju had committed his 

 little foolishness many, many years ago. Justice delayed 

 is justice denied! she cried (I think she meant: the delay 

 in administering justice should surely preclude any justice 

 from being administered). All he had done was get some 

 guns to pretend-play with, he hadnt killed anyone nor had 

 he intended to. If he was being given six years, then why 

 werent Manu Sharma (Jessica Lals killer) and the Nanda 

 boy (of the Delhi BMW road-massacre fame) being hanged? 

 I felt she had a point about Sharma 

 and Nanda, though I dont believe our justice system should 

 be hanging anyone, so I would have changed their sentences 

 to serious quadruple life-imprisonments. As to the rest, 

 I held my absent opinion in abeyance. 

 I picked up the sodden newspaper 

 from where the tearful Sanj-bhakt had dropped it 

 as she left the table to go launch an email campaign. It 

 seemed Justice Kode had been very kind, almost contrite, 

 in delivering his sentence on Dutt. According to the reports, 

 the burden of the judicial song seemed to have been: Im 

 really, really sorry dear boy, but I do have to send you 

 to jail. Im only taking six years of your life (actually 

 four), which is nothing. Your father was a great actor. 

 So was Gregory Peck, who acted till he was a hundred years 

 old. You, too, will be able to emulate your father and Gregory 

 Peck. You will only be 52 or so when you come out, so that 

 leaves a lot of time, like possibly 48 more years of acting, 

 so please dont be too upset. 

 Dutt apparently said, Sir, you 

 know me better than my family. 

 All of which made one think this 

 could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship between 

 sentencee and sentencer; that, really, it would surprise 

 no one were the Honble Justice to quickly finish sending 

 other Blast Accused to the long-drop chop-chop and rush 

 off to spend the four years of RI with Sanju in Yeravada 

 Jail. 

 But then one reminded oneself 

 that one cant trust what one reads in the papers. Therefore, 

 the sentencing must obviously have been a stern, dignified, 

 sombre and strictly fair business as behooves an Indian 

 court. 

 One believed this till TV struck 

 back on behalf of the media a couple of days later. On We 

 the People, the erstwhile police chief of Bombay showed 

 himself to be ballistically unhappy at the TADA element 

 having been removed from Dutts chargesheet. At the opposite 

 end, Anupam Kher said, Sanjay is a friend of mine. I know 

 him. So I can only react emotionally to this. 

 Teesta Setalvad raised the excellent 

 point that no one had been brought to justice for the 92-93 

 Shiv Sena-led riots and murders preceding the Bombay blasts. 

 The police commissioner was silent on this, but coming back 

 to Sanjay, he thought it strange that a man who had a police 

 van stationed outside his bungalow (father Sunil Dutt then 

 being an MP), should need a brace of AK-56s and sundry hand-grenades 

 as back-up for protection. In reply it was pointed out that 

 the police were hardly to be trusted, given their recent 

 record of standing by or aiding and abetting rampaging Hindu 

 fascist mobs. 

 In the brilliant play of the French 

 writer, Jean Genet, The Balcony, there is an exchange 

 between two very frightened sex-workers during a revolution. 

 It goes something like this: 

 Who will protect us? 

 Why, the police, of course! They 

 are standing right outside the brothel! 

 Oh? And who will protect us from 

 the Police?

 Its doubtful whether Sanjubaba 

 has ever read Genet, but based on this argument hed got 

 the point without any knowledge of modern French theatre. 

 We had the newspapers at it again. Sanjay to learn sewing 

 or cooking in Yeravada Jail, they informed us, explaining 

 that those would be the two choices of rigorous imprisonment 

 facing Mr D. The mind boggled at the ironies and the possibilities. 

 The ironies were beautiful Yeravada is the historical 

 incarceration joint for many great leaders of our nationalist 

 movement, including, if Im not wrong, MKG himself, so what 

 better place for Munnabhai 56-walla? As to the possibilities, 

 I can imagine Tarun Tahiliani or someone selling his new 

 line of unique creations big-time a line of couture 

 perhaps called In Stir or Spell Bound, with a sub-tag: 

 Hand-Stitched by Sanjay D, the dresses being scooped up 

 by Western celebs, including a very supportive Paris Hilton. 

 A lot of the flippancy, however, 

 went out of the window when someone brought a DVD of a recent 

 Bombay film called Shootout at Lokhandwala. The film 

 purports to tell us the story of the decimation of a notorious 

 Bhai-bunch by a squad of elite Bombay policemen. The flick 

 is tightly made and nicely mounted. There is charismatic 

 Inspector Khan, who forms something called ATS (Anti-terrorist 

 Squad), a ruthless unit whose sole aim is to rid Bombay 

 of its pau-mafia. There is the (equally charismatic) 

 gang of gangsters who are Human but Cruel; they love, they 

 laugh, but they also torture and kill. Inspector Khan has 

 seen too many of his brave and honest cop-colleagues being 

 gunned down by these goondas and he figures the only 

 way to get the vermin is to Get Them, i.e., to shoot them 

 wherever they are found, without the effete fripperies of 

 arrest, trial, judgment and jail. In the end, the dirty-Harrys 

 of the ATS tapkao the anti-heroes. The heroic cops 

 are then put on trial. Amitabh Bachchan as defence lawyer 

 gets them off but the ATS is summarily disbanded. The Bombay 

 blasts take place immediately after this, the end-titles 

 tell us, implying that had the ATS not been disbanded the 

 terrorists may have been stopped by men such as Khan. 

 The methods of Inspector Khan 

 are portrayed without any pulling of narrative or visual 

 punches. When one Bhai-let is captured he laughs at the 

 cop, boasting he will be out in three days. The cop summarily 

 throws him over the side of the roof. When another gang-member 

 is captured and brought to Khan, the inspector calls the 

 policemen to surround him, shielding him from the gaze of 

 bystanders and a TV crew. Then Khan pulls out his gun and 

 puts a bullet into the gangsters brain. I said, shoot 

 to kill! he says as he walks away. Sanjay Dutt may have 

 yanked back his muscular punching-arm several times in the 

 Munnabhai films but in this movie he plays the role of Inspector 

 Khan with great relish. 

 Given the current situation, this 

 thows up an ber-ironical image that only Bombay could have 

 produced: imagine Dutt as Khan catching Dutt, the rich-brat 

 film star with Bhai connections. Abey, bol! Yeh sab 

 kya hai? asks Khan, and, without waiting for an answer, 

 snarls Saala, ghar pey AK 56 rakhta hai? Udaa do isko! 

 and studs the hapless stud with a whole magazine from his 

 automatic. If Dutts enthusiastic participation in this 

 dangerous film is to be taken seriously then what he seems 

 to be saying is that this, perhaps, is exactly what should 

 have happened. 

 But, as we know, life is stranger 

 than fiction, even stranger than Bollywood. Apparently, 

 among Sanjay Dutts car-fleet is a new Ferrari; apparently, 

 what Sanju likes to do is go for night drives on the smooth 

 Bombay-Poona highway. What happens is, Dutt zips ahead while 

 a Jeep carrying extra cans of petrol follows behind. When 

 Dutts tank runs out of petrol, he pulls over and waits 

 for the Jeep to catch up. Then they re-fill the tank and 

 off he goes again, till they reach Poona. Then they turn 

 around and come back, following the same procedure of innocent 

 fun. Therefore, a far more realistic scene than Dutt Encountering 

 Dutt might be of our man as he comes out in a couple of 

 years, his sentence mitigated by a multi-band antibiotic 

 of good behaviour political considerations and juridical 

 puppetry. The favourite sports-car would be waiting for 

 him at the gate, as would the Jeep. He would get into the 

 Ferrari and drive back to Bombay, grinning all the way, 

 thanking his stars hes neither the lower-middle-class Munnabhai 

 of the chawls nor the overly upright Inspector Khan, 

 bunker-keeper of the bourgeoisie, but a truly bindaas 

 son of Mother India.

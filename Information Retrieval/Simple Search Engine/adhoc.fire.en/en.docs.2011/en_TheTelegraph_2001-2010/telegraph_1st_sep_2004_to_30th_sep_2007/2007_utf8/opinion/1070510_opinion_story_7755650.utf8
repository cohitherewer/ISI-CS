 NORMAL TIMES

 For Bihar, as much as for India, the normal functioning of the State machinery is never boring. In fact, it has never been a more exciting spectacle. Months after a strident judiciary sent Jharkhands iconic figure and Union minister, Shibu Soren, to jail (the first incumbent minister to be so packed off), it has re-emphasized the governing principle of the Indian democracy that everyone is equal before the law. The Rashtriya Janata Dal member of the Rajya Sabha, Mohammad Shahabuddin, has been awarded a life sentence in a case of abduction, and is the second VIP to be felled in this manner. On the face of it, there is nothing exceptional about the court trying and convicting a person who, with more than 40 cases against him, has consistently been on the wrong side of law and has substantial evidence of wrongdoing piled up against him. In the badlands of Bihar, however, the nailing of bahubali Shahabu has its own connotation. Shahabuddins conviction proves that no one is invincible, and, more importantly, political support or position does not guarantee immunity from the law for life. 

 The second lesson may prove to be more worthwhile, both for the people and their representatives. In the case of Shahabuddin, it was his proximity to the powers-that-be and his cooption into the political hierarchy that made him unassailable. The RJD courted this established criminal, and even turned his protector, because both his muscle power and his identity as a member of the minority community were of immense use to it. Shahabuddin now finds the tide against him because the RJD is no longer in power. His example should set off warning bells for history-sheeters like him who bank on political opportunism to keep them out of jails. But perhaps it should also turn more serious attention to the failings of Indian democracy which allow political parties to shamelessly employ and field criminals to garner votes. Shahabuddin would not have prospered in the first place had the State functioned normally.

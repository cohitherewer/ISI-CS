The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 RIGHT IS CENTRE

 The French seem to have their heads and their hearts in the same place. Which is why their choice of the winner in the presidential race has not varied too significantly between the first and the final rounds of polling. They seem to have wavered even less in the last round, giving right-wing Nicolas Sarkozy a princely share of 53 per cent of the vote. The suave, smooth-talking socialist, Sgolne Royal, has been unable to deter French voters in their mission, despite her warnings of widespread unrest if they opted to go the conservative way. The choice has undoubtedly been difficult for the French electorate. On the one hand was the promise of a tame all-round betterment without the risk of social upheaval under the affectionate gaze of Ms Royal. On the other was the lure of an economic breakthrough and a fierce reinstatement of national pride under the high-strung leadership of Mr Sarkozy. The French chose the latter because they keenly feel the need for a turnaround and believe that Mr Sarkozy, given his abrasiveness, is better placed to accomplish the task than the coy Ms Royal, who has been unable to position herself decisively within her own party. In doing so, the French have had no inhibitions in undermining both the extreme left and the extreme right. They have yielded centre place to a repositioned right, and are unlikely to change their mind in the parliamentary elections next month. 

 Having got his presidency, Mr Sarkozy, undoubtedly, will be under immense pressure to deliver. The job of undoing Frances image as Europes sick man is unenviable, given the economic depression and the poor labour-market performance. It may get more difficult if civil violence intensifies as he tries to push through his hardcore reforms of breaking the power of the labour unions, coaxing France out of its 35-hour-week habit and cutting down illegal immigration. The emphasis on national identity is also likely to further isolate the immigrant communities and add to the social unrest. The key to success, however, lies in the economy. If Mr Sarkozy is giving people the offer to work more and earn more, he should also make sure that the opportunity percolates down the social strata. While Mr Sarkozy is busy at work, it would do the socialists no harm to get their own house in order. The mantle, one never knows, may veer back to them.

 INDIA ISNT DELHI

 A lot of murky water has flown under the bridge since India lost its bid for the 2014 Asian Games. And the shadow-boxing between heads of ministries and departments continues unabated. But the recent statements of the Union minister for sports, Mani Shankar Aiyar, on why he thinks the tide went against India in the bidding process throws light on one aspect of Indian sports, and thereby on the official Indian mindset, that is always overlooked the lopsided emphasis on Delhi. At the Asian Games bid in Kuwait, South Korea, apart from its shrewd strategy to play up the differences within the Indian establishment, seems to have highlighted this tendency. While each delegation tried its best to sell its country as host for the games, India sold one particular city, its capital. It has always done so. It has bid for and held international sporting events in Delhi in 1951 and in 1982; it will do so in 2010 and hoped to do it again in 2014, 2016 and 2020. The Indian government has no misgivings about the established monopoly of Delhi in these matters, nor does it seek to read any message in Koreas even distribution of sporting glory to its different cities of Busan and Incheon. At Kuwait, South Korean rhetoric even dared to go beyond nationalism to showcase nothing less than Asia. India, meanwhile, refused to look beyond Delhi in the confused belief that no other city could rival the capital in what it has to offer. Or, to be more precise, no other city could lay claim to the legacy of development which an international sports meet brings in its wake.

 Yet, Delhi has had several chances. Despite that, it seems to have failed in preserving much of this legacy. Its infrastructure upon which it hopes to clinch international bids, and which these events are supposed to project is no better than that of most other cities in India. In fact, its pollution and traffic congestion appear to have caused much worry to the Asian Games bids evaluation committee. The comptroller and auditor generals report on railway cleanliness places New Delhi station way below Secunderabad and Chennai Central. And repeated surveys of the city continue to show its dearth of proper roads, drinking water and a garbage disposal system. If the enthusiasm for hosting sports events is all about promoting urban development, there is no reason why other Indian cities should be denied that privilege.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Its only a game

 Sir The editorial, Grow Up (March 26), rightly condemns the incredible upsurge of anger across the country that followed the exit of the Indian cricket team from the World Cup. Was this a civilized way of protesting against players who were worshipped by the fans before the tournament began? The excessive response not only reveals the utterly undignified behaviour of the fans, but also shows how the media has been responsible for generating these bitter passions. It must be remembered that other top teams have also lost major tournaments despite enjoying huge public support. Brazils loss in the football World Cup in 1998 is a case in point. 

 Indian cricket fans should put an end to their irrational behaviour as a loss or a win in cricket is entirely a matter of chance. It is also sad that apart from cricket, most other sporting events in India are neglected by the sponsors, government, media, as well as the public. It has often been the case that the national team or an individual has won a major tournament in another sport. On their return, the players have discovered very little enthusiasm over their achievements. It is time the obsession with cricket is reduced to the benefit of other games. That way, the young will be encouraged to excel in other sports as well. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir It is unfair to hold the Indian players responsible for their dismal performance in the World Cup. The expectations of their fans had put them under intense pressure. These days, people seem to forget that cricket is a game of luck, and expect players to deliver the goods in every match. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir The setback suffered by the Indian team in the World Cup has upset the fans considerably. A few days ago, those who were singing paeans to their heroes are now busy burning their effigies, vandalizing properties owned by players, and threatening their families. Even if the anger and frustration of these people could be justified by the disappointing performance of the team, this is, by no means, rational behaviour. If this is the way Indians give vent to their anguish for the teams shocking performance in a tournament, why is it that they remain unmoved by the political injustices, corruption, racial and gender discriminations and the rise in criminal activities? 

 Yours faithfully,

Akasmika Rath, Bhubaneswar

 Sir The photographs of Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid in The Telegraph (March 27) show no signs of regret or sorrow on their faces for their poor performance in the World Cup. True, there is little point in brooding on past mistakes, and the team should be looking forward to the fixtures that are lined up in the next twelve months. However, is it judicious for the country to send such a poor team to tour England, Australia and South Africa? Should not the Board of Control for Cricket in India cancel all scheduled commitments and declare a years moratorium on international cricket as far as India is concerned? I think no self-respecting cricket fan in India would like to see the faces of Indian cricketers for a while. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arunodoy Bhattacharyya, Calcutta

 Sir While the Pakistan captain resigned in shame taking full responsibility for his teams debacle in the World Cup, it is heartening to note the strength of character shown by his Indian counterpart who smoothly passed on the buck to his teammates. Such an attitude deserves to be emulated if the cricketers are expected to bring the Cup home in the future. Congratulations to him and may he prosper. It is high time the powers that be also take a decision on leaving the running of national sporting bodies to professionals in preference to know-all politicians.

 Yours faithfully,

A.B. Dutt, Calcutta

 Sir It is important to keep in mind that life does not end for the Indian cricket team with their defeat in the World Cup. In order to keep the team fit, the BCCI should organize a series of one-day matches between the national team and India-A. The former might be led by Rahul Dravid, while Sourav Ganguly should be asked to take charge of the latter. These matches could throw up some new talents, as well as help prepare the team mentally and technically for the forthcoming series. 

 Yours faithfully,

K.B. Goswami, Calcutta

 Sir Now that India has been knocked out of the World Cup, the media has started hunting for scapegoats. Unfortunately, the collective strength of the team is never taken into consideration before people come out with their prejudiced views. There are already murmurs that the coach, Greg Chappell, will be shown the door, Dravid may be asked to step down, and Tendulkar will be made the captain once again. Cricket is a team game and all the players should take responsibility for the defeat. Putting all the blame on Chappell will not do. If Tendulkar could not score or Ganguly failed to force the pace during the do-or die game against the Lankans, is Chappell to blame? Finally, a probe by the BCCI into Indias poor showing in the World Cup might be a good idea. The investigation can throw light on some crucial aspects and show that there is more than what meets the eye. 

 Yours faithfully,

Nitin G. Gokarn, Mumbai

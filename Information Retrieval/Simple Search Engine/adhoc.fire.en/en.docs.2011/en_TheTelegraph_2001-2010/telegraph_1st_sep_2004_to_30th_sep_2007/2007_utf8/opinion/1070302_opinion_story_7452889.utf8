 WHAT THEY HAD MADE WAS LOVE

 Editor's Choice 

 W.H. Auden 

 THE NEW FABER BOOK OF LOVE POEMS

 Edited by James Fenton, Faber, pound;12.75

 It is not often that a poet presents his own selection of love poems. James Fenton poet, journalist and professor of poetry in Oxford (1994-99) has brought together some of his favourites in this volume. The selected poems stretch back to Thomas Wyatt (1503-42), in whose period, Fenton says, the roughly comprehensible modern English language begins. It includes some of Fentons own poems as well as some written by his contemporaries.

 Fenton believes and he is in distinguished company that love poetry is at the core of all poetry. All other forms of poetry radiate from this core. The most popular three-word sentence in the English language becomes, in the consciousness and creativity of a handful of talented people, the basis of some of the most poignant and unforgettable lines in literature.

 Fenton adds another dimension. He argues that lyrical poetry has a close historical affinity with music. This is not necessarily true for all love poems but certainly applicable to many of them. Fenton also says that since it is possible to actually set many of these poems to music and to sing them, the poems, or a large number of them, are simple.

 Having made this claim, he proceeds to include T.S. Eliots The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock. Most readers of this gem will agree that it is not exactly simple. Many readers will also not agree to placing it in the category of a love poem, despite its title.

 But this is a minor point about what is really a wonderful collection. No compilation of love poetry can be complete, of course, without Shakespeares sonnets. Fenton includes twenty. But surprisingly, this is not the highest number from a single poet. That title goes to William Blake (22), with Yeats coming third with 17.

 Numbers are terrible things to bring into a discussion on poetry, especially about as unquantifiable a thing as love. Simon Armitage (1963- ) has one nomination. But it is unforgettable: You met me to apologise, you were saying/ as we waited in the drizzle for the slow train./ When it focused in we said goodbye and we kissed/ and from the window you were caught; teary and fixed./ You ran across the wooden bridge, I knew you would,/ to get down on the other platform and to wave,/ but as you did the eastbound Leeds train flickered past/ and ran you like a movie through its window-frames./ I keep those animated moments of you as/ our catalogue of chances rushed and chances missed.

 Every reader will find favourites here. But no collection of this kind can be complete without Audens cry to Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone because of the death of his lover who was my North, my South, my East and West,/ My working week and my Sunday rest/ My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song.

 One should not end a review of a volume of love poems with such a profound and all-encompassing call for mourning. So here is Fleur Adcock (1934- ) with his Happy Ending: After they had not made love/ she pulled the sheet up over her eyes/ until he was buttoning his shirt:/ not shyness for their bodies those/ they had willingly displayed but a frail/ endeavour to apologise./ Later, though, drawn together by/ a distaste for such untidy ends/ they agreed to meet again; whereupon/ they giggled, reminisced, held hands/ as though what they had made was love / and not that happier outcome, friends.

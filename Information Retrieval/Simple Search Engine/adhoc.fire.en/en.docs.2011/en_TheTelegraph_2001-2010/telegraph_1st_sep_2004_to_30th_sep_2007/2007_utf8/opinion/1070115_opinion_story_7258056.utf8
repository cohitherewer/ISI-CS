 SET THE STAGE

 It is one thing for a government to use the army to quell violence and quite another to expect it to tackle a political crisis. Neither the state of emergency nor the armys takeover of the administration can meet the real challenge to democracy in Bangladesh. The new nation has had too many spells of army rule to be comfortable with another such possibility. Even so, if Bangladeshis have generally welcomed the declaration of emergency this time, that is because the actions of the president, Mr Iajuddin Ahmed, were pushing the country deeper into chaos. He refused to see the obvious that there could be no free and fair elections in the current situation. It was not simply a matter between opposing political groups, but a reality that most Bangladeshis and the international community had accepted. The declaration of emergency may have helped stall the elections, which the opposition parties had boycotted. But it also takes away the peoples basic rights and suspends the functioning of all democratic institutions. A long emergency can thus be a problem, rather than the solution to Bangladeshs current crisis. 

 The only way to restore democracy in the country is to set the stage for a free election. And the sooner this is done, the better for peace and democracy in Bangladesh. But the first task is to clean up the electoral rolls and the polling machinery. Mr Ahmed had complicated the problem by insisting on holding the elections on the basis of the flawed rolls. The interim government should waste no more time to prepare correct voters lists and to make the administration free from partisan biases. If Bangladeshs politics has long been ruled by street fights, it is because of the decline of its democratic institutions. A free vote and a democratic government could pave the way for rebuilding these institutions. Now that Mr Ahmed has stepped down as the chief of the interim government, the parties should withdraw from street battles. Unless they help in creating the right ambience for a free election, they will expose the country to the twin dangers of army rule and organized terror. The recent rise of Islamist terror in Bangladesh is largely because of the weakening of democracy there. The world can no longer afford to see Bangladesh only as a poor country that needs to be helped with donations. Its democracy too must be the worlds concern.

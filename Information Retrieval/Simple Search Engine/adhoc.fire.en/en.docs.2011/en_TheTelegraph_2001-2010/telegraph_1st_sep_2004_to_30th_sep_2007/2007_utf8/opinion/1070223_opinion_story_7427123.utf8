 RULED BY FAILURE

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Uttar Pradesh will go to the polls in April. If the people of the state want to extricate themselves from the mire of corruption and criminality in everyday life, they have an opportunity now, once again, to break away from conventional wisdom, deviate from what is expected as a result based on caste and other such compulsions, and risk casting their precious votes differently. Staunch and hardened ideological positions have petrified in time much like fossils that remain historical evidence of a past age.

 Change is inevitable, as politics, governance and administration get insular and exclusive, and isolated from the rapidly shifting realities and demands of a new generation that is not willing to accept the exploitation nor the personal agendas of its failed rulers. 

 Apart from the bustling metropolis of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh is in a sorry and neglected state. There are no words that describe the unfortunate levels to which the basics of civil society have been reduced and diluted. It is a region with a fine past of an extraordinary range of cultures and traditions. Despite the political and societal degeneration and complete corrosion of civilized governance, the people continue to protect and conserve, albeit under the first layer of skin, the diverse strengths and unusual attributes of the larger culture. They are the repository of the great absorption of alien cultures as well as the fundamentals of their own. If any political party would have the courage to set aside the predictable baggage of public activity and posturing, the people of UP could well walk together en masse and create a peoples movement for a systemic overhaul.

 Time for renewal

 Old and tired faces, hobbling men and women, destructive administrators, high-handed authorities who are mandated to keep the order, are an unacceptable proposition. Other states in India have moved on without the privilege of a great and dynamic past, dramatically altering their profile, reaching out and beginning a determined process of renewal and regeneration. UP has allowed its political players to exploit caste and poverty like no other, permitted them to play havoc with truth, pitting groups against one another. They have been successful in destroying growth and development, killing the possibility of liberation from poverty, ripping apart great historical cities, centres of power and culture, making them cesspools of violence and anarchy. When societies reach this helpless point-of-no-return, the time is always right for renewal.

 Maybe the Congress, because it represents all the factions, groupings and communities, has the chance to rejig its hitherto-lacklustre approach to the realities of the state. It could, with fresh, young people, begin the rejuvenation by a campaign that is simple and addresses the truths about the dignity of man and civil society, without bothering about caste and other considerations. Since it is the party with hardly any seats in the UP assembly, they can risk using a new methodology, and structure an inclusive, simple, humane campaign, one that affects all castes, faiths, creeds and classes, sans the lofty slogans and promises of the past. They can only gain and if the stars are right, they could touch a raw, sensitive nerve and a hava could develop that could leave our psephologists wide-eyed and surprised. 

 I say this because there is a feeling that the kind of questions asked merit a certain type of reply. One often wonders why some of the questions are so simplistic and pedestrian. Why this disregard for the average voter? Why this preconceived view that the voter has low intellectual abilities? With a set of new candidates chosen from the constituency and not from one caste or the other who are committed to growth for all classes of people, no political party can go wrong.

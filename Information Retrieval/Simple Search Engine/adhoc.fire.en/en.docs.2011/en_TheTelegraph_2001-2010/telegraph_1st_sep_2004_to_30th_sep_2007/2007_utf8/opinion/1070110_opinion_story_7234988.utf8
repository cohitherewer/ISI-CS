 WHATS IN AND WHATS OUT

 Stephen Hugh-Jones

 Think twice before you challenge the Scrabblocracy, as I did two weeks ago. Though its my favourite word-game, I made mock of its absurd official vocabulary of English, full of archaisms, foreignisms, obscurities and plain fabrications plurals such as farawaynesses, for example.

 I was unwise. Though we Christians talk of Christmas as a season of peace upon Earth, goodwill towards men, we are quick to make it the reverse. And many of Indias top-level Scrabblers are Goans: at last years national championship in Mumbai, 11 of the top 20 competitors had originally Portuguese names. Into my inbox (a word which, remarkably, is not in my Collins 2005 list of officially permitted Scrabble words) streamed e-mails of reproof. Caustic, courteous or both, all were firm on one point: if its OK by the list, its OK by us. As Catholics say, Rome speaks, the case is decided. 

 Facing such an array of (shall we say?) credulousnesses, I could but tsktsk yes, a verb, another titbit of Scrabble English; I presume it means tut-tut and reply, like Martin Luther, that here I stand, I can do no other: Scrabberwocky it may be, English it aint.

 Mix n match

 Yet on one point I do have real uncertainties. They go beyond Scrabble. Just as most other languages have adopted countless English words, English-speakers permissibly can and do use many non-English ones, however rarely; usually, ones with no English version names of plants or animals, for instance. How far can we go before saying this isnt English at all?

 History raises that question, especially in India. The Scrabbleheads, pardonably eager to draw up a list for their use worldwide, authorize a host of words familiar to many Britons though to few other non-Indians from imperial days: anna, dak, dhobi, gharry (and gari), ghat , khansama, mali, munshi, punkah, purdah, shroff, suttee (and sati), syce (and sais), zamindar. And, of course, the sahib or saheb and his mem, and various army ranks down to sepoy (but not sipahi; jawan takes his place). 

 The raja and nizam are there, with their kin; gopurams, saddhus, even yoginis, though no gopis. Plus other more recent words: hartal and morcha, for instance, satyagraha and swaraj (but not swadeshi). And many more, notably names of foods. 

 New horizons

 My trouble is with those words known to few but Indians. I imagine even Mumbais experts hesitate, as I would, at the Scots spellings that Scrabble permits, such as wha, gae, hae, or words like girn (complain), lum (chimney) or the old makar (poet). I, likewise, waver at bhajan, bhavan (or bhawan), bund, chowkidar, naik, sarpanch, shamiana or taluk. Theyre all in the Collins list bund is even in my household dictionary and I met most of them in my Bombay days. But Id feel more than a mite pretentious using them, and most non-Indians should feel downright ridiculous.

 Where do we stop? Even the ecumenical Scrabble vocabularians (their word, not mine) have to, pretty arbitrarily; at least, they did in 2005. I cant speak for the new list that is about to appear. My 2005 version includes talukdar but not patel, acharya but not ustad; dal but not dahi, mofussil yes, tehsil no. There are no netas nor (Im ethnically glad to see, but why should Indias Scrabble-players be?) any goras. Kabaddi is there, but Muralitharans doosra is still no-balled. Autorickshaw, English-sounding yet as Indian a word as many, is there, but not, to widen our Asian horizons a bit, tuktuk. Tsktsk, yar (but not yaar).

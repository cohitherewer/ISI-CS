 Bhajan Lal (right): Time to strike

 If there was a public opinion poll conducted to find out which are the most despised professions in the world, I have little doubt that politics and law would emerge as the top two. Although some politicians become heroes of the people, by and large, the common people distrust them. About lawyers, the less said the better. Akbar Alahabadi (1846-1921) lampooned them in a memorable couplet:

 Paida hua vakeel to iblees nay kahaa

 Lo aaj ham bhee saheb-i-aulaad ho

 gaye

 The day lawyer was born, Satan

 said with joy

 Allah has made me today, the father 

 of a boy.

 Confirmation of these deep-set prejudices comes from a recently published memoir by Justice S.S. Sodhi: The Other Side of Justice. Sodhi started off as a lawyer in Chandigarh. He became a judge of the Allahabad high court. He should have become the judge of the Supreme Court but just before the announcement was to be made, he was side-tracked by the chief justice, and a couple of judges opposed to his elevation. He writes about it in detail without a trace of malice in his narrative.

 His brush with politics came with being unwittingly on the wrong side of Bhajan Lal, the then chief minister of Haryana. Lal was involved in a case where dozens of crores could be gained or lost. He wanted a judge of his own choice, not Sodhi, who was not amenable to political pressure. Sodhi refused to budge. So Lal had him transferred to another high court. Lal, notorious for nursing grudges, tried his best to block Sodhis career as best as he could. He is showing himself in his true colours now. Having been denied the chief ministership of Haryana, he and his son are undermining the political base of the chief minister of Haryana, Bhupinder Singh Hooda. He will, without doubt, turn against the Congress and Sonia Gandhi when he thinks it is the right time to strike. Lal did his best to prevent Sodhi from being made the chief justice of the Allahabad high court.

 Sodhi took over as the chief justice of the Allahabad high court in February 1994, when the judicial system of Indias largest state was in an unholy mess. The high court had 70 judges some based in Allahabad, some in Lucknow. And literally thousands of lawyers organized as trade unionists were at loggerheads with the judges. Abusing, brow-beating judges and, at times, even roughing them up were not unknown. Sodhi himself was once threatened with having his turban knocked off and called a saalaa. The chaotic state of affairs is well illustrated by the case of V.C. Misra, chairman of the Bar Council of India and the many times elected president of the High Court Bar Association. More than once, he has called for lawyers strikes, picketed high court gates to prevent judges from entering the court. He told one that he would have him transferred, impeached by the parliament and turned out, as he had done with many other judges. Ultimately, he was hauled up by the Supreme Court for contempt of court. His cunningly worded apology was rejected and he was sentenced to six weeks in jail and forbidden from practising for three years. That brought the arrogant Misra to his knees and he crumbled. Sodhi does not tell us what the fellow is doing now.

 Calling strikes at the slightest pretext (once to mourn the death of a pariah dog) was common. The already mountainous backlog of pending cases continued to mount. And does so to this day.

 How much did Sodhi succeed in clearing the Augean stables of the Allahabad high court? He did his best and was happy with the results. So apparently were members of the Bar and the bench who gave him a tearful farewell when he left Allahabad to return to Chandigarh. His narrative, though it makes informative reading, deals only with Sodhis years as a judge and with judicial matters. Sodhi has nothing to say about his family life or friends or incidents in his life which is a pity, because he can write well.

 Between life and death

 My young Pakistani friend, Preetam Giani, regularly sends me his latest translations of Mirza Ghalibs couplets along with reflections on reality, which comprise his thoughts on diverse subjects. In his last letter, he pleads for extra time to finish his worldly tasks before the angel of death comes to him. However, here is what he has to say in verse and prose:

 I charge you, death, to stay away a

 while yet,

 Ive certain weighty responsibili-

 ties to fulfil; 

 When those demands on my spir-

 it, in the flesh I have met,

 Ill all too gladly follow you 

 wheresoever you will.

 He continues in prose: On the one hand, I feel attracted by the peacefulness and restfulness of death, by the possibility, however incomprehensible, of meeting again my deceased father, mother and brother (not to mention meeting historical personages like Muhammad and Shakespeare), and by the prospect of discovering ultimate truths beyond the reach of my living person. On the other hand, I still have some stomach for the excitement and restlessness of life, for fulfilling my responsibilities towards those who depend on me in any way, and for approaching truth and reality to the best of my existing abilities. Being 57, I suppose I can expect this see-saw between attraction to death and attachment to life to continue for the foreseeable future.

 Through Russian eyes

 Afanasy Nikitin, the Russian horse dealer, came to India for horse trading in 1968. He was the first Russian ever to record his travels in India. He wrote: In the land of India it is the custom for foreign traders to stop at inns; there Indian food is cooked for the guests by the landlady, who also makes the bed and sleeps with the stranger. Women that knew you willingly concede the favours, for they like White men.

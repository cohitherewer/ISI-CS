 Dizzy heights 

In ancient India, people used kites to send messages to the gods. From the late 19th century, they became interested in the other end of this peculiar line of communication: a gods-eye-view of the world. In 1888, Arthur Batut used kites for the purpose of ariel photography. An experiment that began in Labruguire, a small village in Southern France, soon became widely popular, particularly in America. In Kites Eye View: India Between Earth and Sky (Roli, Rs 2,975), Nicolas Chorier captures some stunning images primarily of historical monuments of India. Chorier achieves these dizzying perspectives by using a remote-controlled camera tied to kites that are made after the Japanese Rokkaku style. His ingenious artistry turns familiar places into something rich and strange. This is the Tower of Victory in Chittorgarh Fort built by Rana Kumbha in the 15th century.

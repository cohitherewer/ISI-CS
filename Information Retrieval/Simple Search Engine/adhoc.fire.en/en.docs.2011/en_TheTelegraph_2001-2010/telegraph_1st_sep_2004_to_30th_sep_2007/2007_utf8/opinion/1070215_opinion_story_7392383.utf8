 INFLATION WAR

 The Reserve Bank of India has declared an all-out war on inflation. Almost immediately after hiking the rate at which it lends overnight money (the repo rate) a couple of weeks ago, it has now decided to hike the cash reserve ratio, which is the amount of cash that commercial banks have to keep with it. The result of increasing the CRR is to suck out liquidity from the banking system, which increases the cost of funds for banks. To preserve their margins, banks will then be forced to raise interest rates. That is exactly what the RBI wants, because it wishes to slow down excessive demand.

 There is little doubt that demand pressures are strong, a fact reflected in the 6.2 per cent annual rise in the wholesale price index for manufactured products. That is a clear indication that manufacturing companies have regained pricing power, mainly because they are operating at the limits of their capacity. In other words, the gap between actual and potential output has narrowed considerably, and any increase in demand will spill over into higher prices. There are also signs that rapid growth is approaching the limits that the countrys creaking infrastructure can handle. The Maharashtra state electricity board, for example, recently said that it would be forced to cut off power to industries for two days a week if a solution to the power crisis was not found. As Mr Rakesh Mohan, the deputy governor of the RBI, pointed out in a recent speech, the RBIs assessment is that while expansion of capacity is underway, the realization of that capacity expansion could be constrained over the next two years. The Central banks job is, therefore, to manage inflationary expectations till the new capacity comes onstream. 

 That job has been made more difficult by the rising capital inflows into the country, in the form of portfolio and direct investment, private equity and external commercial borrowings. These inflows push up the rupee. And since the rupee is already overvalued on a trade-weighted basis, the Central bank has been trying to prevent the currency from appreciating, as otherwise exports would be hurt. But when it intervenes, the RBI buys dollars and releases rupees into the system, which results in a rise in liquidity in the money market. That is the reason why, in spite of a series of rate hikes, money supply growth is still above 21 per cent year-on-year. Nevertheless, there are a few signs that the RBIs rate hikes are having some impact. The Purchasing Managers Index has been falling for several months and bankers are talking of slowing credit offtake. The stock market, which had so far remained blithely unconcerned about the Central banks actions, is also learning that it does not pay to fight the RBI.

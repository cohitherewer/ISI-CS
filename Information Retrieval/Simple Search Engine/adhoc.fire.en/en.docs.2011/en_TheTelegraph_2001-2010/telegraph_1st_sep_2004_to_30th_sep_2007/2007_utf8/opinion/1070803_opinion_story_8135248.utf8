 TRUTH ABOUT CATS AND DOGS

 The Emotional Lives of Animals By Marc Bekoff, 

 New World Library, $23.95

 It is commonplace for pet-owners to ascribe emotions to their animals. Dogs seem happy when they wag their tails and cats look sad when they crouch. However, in the cold-blooded empirical world of scientists, attributing human emotions to non-human creatures is still considered to be a cardinal sin. Such a proclamation may appear strange one-and-a-half centuries after the pioneering works of Charles Darwin, but many ethologists (scientists who study animal behaviour) still see red when human feelings are applied to animals. But Marc Bekoff has thrown the gauntlet to his peers by writing this book, where he speaks favourably of anthropomorphism while studying the lives of creatures great and small.

 Bekoff has ruffled many feathers throughout his working life. As a colleague of the Nobel laureate, Konrad Lorenz, and legendary chimpanzee researcher, Jane Goodall, Bekoff has been a renegade in the overwhelmingly stolid scientific community that in many ways still sticks to the view that cognitive thought processes are uniquely human, and animals are incapable of manifesting the qualities of what we see in each other as pleasure and pain.

 He turns the question of non-existence of emotions in animals on its head by placing a counter question: If it is acceptable for humans to believe that fellow humans share the varied sensations that betray their state of mind, what prevents us from applying the same logic to animals? According to him, it is just as important for students of ethology to apply common sense to conclude how and why sentient creatures behave the way they do.

 The book reminds readers that men are animals too, an apparently obvious argument, but widely ignored in the cultural and scientific context of our daily lives. The debate of nature versus nurture in human behavioural studies is still unresolved after decades of thorough research in laboratories across North America and Europe. Yet, Bekoff points out that there is a strange reservation in recognizing the very existence of emotions in animals because that would radically alter the way we treat them: Recognizing animals have emotions is important because animal feelings matter, states Bekoff. It matters not only in case of pets but also for those creatures that are routinely slaughtered for food.

 Fifty years ago, such claims may have been rubbished, but a steady stream of research has added credence to Bekoffs position. His writing is a reflection of the accumulated wisdom of these researchers, including Nikolaas Tinbergen and Karl Ritter von Frisch. Jane Goodall praises Bekoff for withstanding the vicious criticism of his peers that has been levelled at him throughout most of his professional life and appreciates his meticulous combination of scientific methodology with intuition.

 Bekoff provides some moving examples of animals displaying human traits. He describes how a couple of his pet llamas mourned the death of their mates. The animals behaviour led him to acknowledge that animals experience emotional states akin to what we go through ourselves.

 Bekoffs exploration of moral choices in animals also leads one to think of the widely-held notion of Homo sapiens having exclusive rights on morality. He also challenges the conventional notions of morality. Urging the reader to look at the front page of the newspaper, Bekoff pricks human vanity that finds murder unacceptable, but war justifiable.

 The topics explored by Bekoff may seem trivial in the Indian context, where even fundamental human rights cannot be ensured. But then, one only has to remember that Ashoka carved his edicts on animal protection centuries ago.

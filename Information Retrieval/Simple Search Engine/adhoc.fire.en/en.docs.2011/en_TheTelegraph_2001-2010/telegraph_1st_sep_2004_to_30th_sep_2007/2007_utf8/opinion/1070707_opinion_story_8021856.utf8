 Still a class apart

 Sir What was significant about Sachin Tendulkars knock of 93 in the second one-day match against South Africa was not the record he set, but the manner in which he batted. The innings reminded us of how a young Tendulkar would decimate opposition attacks almost single-handedly. It would not be right to suggest that Tendulkar put the South African bowling to the sword to silence his critics only: he has done that too many times with equal effect. On this occasion, he only wanted to remind us that class, not form, is permanent.

 Yours faithfully,

 Susobhan Sarkar, Sonarpur

 Harsh measures

 Sir Some time ago, the media reported the death of K. Yadaiah, who was allegedly kidnapped by agents of a loan recovery firm hired by ICICI bank (Kidnap shadow in defaulter death, June 25).

 I had a similar experience a few days back but, thankfully, I am alive to tell the tale. Some time ago, I had defaulted on two instalments for a loan that I had taken from ICICI bank. When I approached the bank to offer an explanation, I was not allowed to leave the premises. Instead, I was forcibly confined inside the banks office. I was let off only when I threatened to phone a police friend of mine who works in Lalbazar. Later, when I approached the police, they also advised me to file a complaint against the bank by approaching the respective police station. 

 I have, of course, started paying my instalments once again. But I strongly feel that the judiciary and the police need to look into the treatment meted out by banks to customers who fail to pay their dues on time. I am sure that the banks are aware that there are more civilized ways to recover dues legally. 

 Had such an incident taken place in the United States of America, where I have worked for a considerable time period, I could have sued the bank for the harassment I faced. Unfortunately, in India, banks are rarely punished for flouting the rules. The authorities need to identify banks that are guilty of such misconduct and punish them severely to put an end to this menace. 

 Yours faithfully,

Rashid Azizi, Calcutta

 Sir First, we read about the unfortunate death of a man in the hands of loan recovery agents. Then, there was another report stating how banks nowadays are seeking the services of musclemen to recover money (Thugs recipe for loan recovery, June 26). These reports clearly point to the fact that there has been a sudden rise in such incidents across the country, and that there is an urgent need to change the methods the banks employ to recover loans. If banks are applying force to punish errant customers who fail to pay up on time, then the former must be exposed and then penalized for their unscrupulous conduct.

 In fact, the banks themselves are responsible for their plight. They indiscriminately sell financial products such as personal loans without bothering to check whether an individual would be able to repay the amount on time. For instance, the banking practice of sending pre-approved loan drafts to customers even without their asking reflects the laxity of the system.We sincerely hope that the Reserve Bank of India as well as other banking associations are paying attention to these media reports and would respond to the situation accordingly. 

 Yours faithfully,

Dipak Thakker, Mumbai

 Erratum

 Sir --- The book reviewed by Chirosree Basu on July 6 (Reflections on the nature of love, grief and immortality) was titled A Teardrop on the Cheek of Time: The Story of the Taj Mahal, and not The Story of the Taj Mahal, as printed.

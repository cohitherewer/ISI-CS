The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 WIN THE WEST

 President Pervez Musharraf does not suffer from self-delusions. Operation Silence in the Lal Masjid, he knew, could not shut up his increasingly belligerent dissenters. The voices of protest and the show of defiance against the agent of the West were bound to get louder. Hence, military movement into the remote north-west and the wild borders with Afghanistan took place almost simultaneously with the stepping up of operations in the Islamabad mosque. Mr Musharrafs suspicion has been belied. Western Pakistan now sees a steady stream of suicide-bombings against both paramilitary and civilian targets, threatening to bring on a state of emergency in the country. The violence, which had started even before the Red Mosque siege began, has already claimed a few hundred lives, and shows the promise of intensifying further with the breakdown of the governments peace pact with the militants in the border areas. The chances of peace may dim even further with the hardening of stance on the part of both the aid-providers (primarily the United States of America) and the militants. The US is said to have resolved to withdraw financial help for a while so as not to kindle more anti-West feelings, and to prevent the money from falling into rebel hands. The Generals ally in the war on terror had not taken kindly to the concluding of the peace pact, which he still thinks is the best way to ensure peace in the region. The US would like it even less if there were attempts to reinstate it in the face of so much bloodshed.

 The situation, it goes without saying, is unenviable for Mr Musharraf. The image of his government and his own political viability now depend on his ability to fulfil his promise of rooting out extremists. Unfortunately, the majority of these troublemakers seem to be concentrated in a geographical area that has proved to be the least amenable to political and military control. Successive regimes in Pakistan have been unable to penetrate these tribal pockets, which live by their own rules of life and war. They have not only resisted Mr Musharrafs enlightened moderation but also managed to export their brand of militancy and religious fervour into mainland Pakistan. Yet, unless the General quietens Pakistans wild west, and puts an end to the suicide missions, he will be risking not only more lawlessness and opposition within the country but also derision from his Western ally, whose support is indispensable for his political survival.

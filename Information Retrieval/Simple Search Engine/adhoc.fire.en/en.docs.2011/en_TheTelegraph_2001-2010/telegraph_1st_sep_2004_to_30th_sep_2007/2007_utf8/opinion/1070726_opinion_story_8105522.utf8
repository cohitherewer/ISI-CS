 LIMITED GAINS

 This is a curious legacy of the long reign of the Left in Bengal. The longer the people vote in a particular way, the more unlikely they are to change their electoral behaviour. The Leftists, who claim to be agents of change, have fostered and benefited from a strange sort of political conservatism. The results of the civic polls at Haldia once again testify to this pattern. It is remarkable how similarly the voters behave in different parts of Bengal in different kinds of elections. Yet, the elections at Haldia were made out to be much more than a local affair. They were projected as a referendum on Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees industrialization policy and a verdict on the governments role in dealing with the violence at neighbouring Nandigram. The polls turned out to be no such thing. They were neither a vote for industrialization, as the Left claims; nor are the small gains made by the Opposition a result of its battle against land acquisition. That this is indeed so is made amply clear if one compares the results of these polls with those of the 1997 elections to the Haldia municipality or the ones for the parliamentary and assembly seats in the area. The gap between the Left and the Opposition in the Haldia polls then was almost the same as this time. The last polls in 2002, when the Left took all the seats, were not the right indicator of the peoples political choices because the Opposition boycotted the polls in nearly half the constituencies. 

 All this is reason enough for the governments industrialization programmes not to be linked to electoral politics. It is a directionless government that changes its economic agenda in order to suit a temporary political strategy. The case for the proposed chemical hub at Haldia has thus little to do with the Lefts victory in these polls. The Left would be wrong to take these results for a licence to silence all critics of its industrialization policy. Mamata Banerjee too can take a lesson from the verdict at Haldia. She may have the power to temporarily stall the acquisition of land at Haldia or elsewhere for some other project. But the results at Haldia should tell her that such agitations are not going to take her anywhere near her goal of capturing power in Bengal. This could be so even if she manages to strike an alliance with the Congress and other anti-Left parties, as she did in Haldia. There are obvious limits to the gains from populist politics.

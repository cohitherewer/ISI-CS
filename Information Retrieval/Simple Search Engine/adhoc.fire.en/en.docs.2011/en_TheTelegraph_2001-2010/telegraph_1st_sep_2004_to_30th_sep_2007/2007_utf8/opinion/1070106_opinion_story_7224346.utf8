 Letters to Editor

 No extensions, please

 Sir Bureaucrat and retired? Youre hired (Jan 2) makes a mockery of the administrative system of the country. Hiring retired bureaucrats is a classic case of wasteful expenditure of taxpayers money, without corresponding returns. A couple of years ago, the government had taken a decision not to give extension to, or appoint as consultants, bureaucrats after their retirement, as it reduces promotional prospects of junior officers. The government must issue a blanket ban on all such extensions before someone invokes the Right to Information Act on the issue.

 Yours faithfully,

 A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Big disappointment

 Sir There is no doubt that Shilpa Shetty looked gorgeous when she stepped on the podium of Big Brother (Bollywood sis breaks Brother barrier, Jan 5). But did you fail to spot the jeering and booing when she was introduced as a Bollywood actress? It might be reasonable to presume, given the Indian preoccupation with all things British, that it is an honour for Indians to be represented in the Big Brother house. However, the last episode has clearly shown the racism and the apparent dislike of Asians among the Brits. I have lived in London for 24 years now, and I am convinced that there never was a society more preoccupied with itself and racist than the British. Shetty is here because they expect her to drop off her top sooner than later. Asian viewers are tuning in to Big Brother not to see themselves being represented, rather, to see how Shetty handles the sexual innuendoes and the advances from the male inmates in the pool. To be honest, there never was a more derogatory programme in the history of tube. I felt thoroughly sick when I saw a Bollywood actress in the programme. Jermaine Jackson has already commented in the press (to The Sun) that he wants to see Shilpa topless in a weeks time. I feel most compelled to write because I think that the appearance of a Bollywood figure in this ridiculous human zoo did not deserve front-page coverage when there are other pressing issues vying for space.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Shilpa Shetty appeared chuffed to be asked to do Channel 4s popular reality show, Big Brother. She blushed and appeared coy, before asking all Indians to feel proud because of her presence in the house. Big Brother is the show whose clone is now being aired in India. What exactly do we have to feel proud about? Perhaps Shetty is suggesting that watching an Indian woman sleep in the same room as an alcoholic and rockstar is something to feel proud about. Or perhaps the fact that she will probably be asked to play the role of a dog or a cat (as MP George Galloway found out last year to his cost) and be ridiculed on British television. Or is it because she now has the opportunity to add ill-informed quips about Indian history and culture, both of which she is now supposed to represent? British television-shows like Big Brother, Strictly Come Dancing, Weakest Link and Who Wants to be a Millionaire already have their copies in India, speaking a lot about our originality. People in England have no idea who Shetty is. Indeed, all that the British make of Bollywood is that it is an industry that dishes out copies of Western movies with generous doses of dance and songs. Shetty will have plenty of opportunity to enlighten them perhaps, and be the object of laughter here in England. It is futile to attempt to explain to the curious public that she by no means represents India, but she is all we have got now. Instead of feeling proud, I am aghast and shocked at her presence in the show. If she pulls some impressive trick on Big Brother for the British public to mock, it would be us Indians on the streets facing the banter.

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Leamington Spa, UK

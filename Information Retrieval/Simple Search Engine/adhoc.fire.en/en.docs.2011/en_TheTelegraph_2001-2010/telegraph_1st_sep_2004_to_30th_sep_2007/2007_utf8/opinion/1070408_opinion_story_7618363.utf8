The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 THE DOG HAS ITS DAY

 Exit Nipper, pursued by Gromit. Both are British dogs. Nipper is the white fox terrier in the logo of His Masters Voice, familiar to most people since the early years of the 20th century. Gromit is a plasticine dog who has been featuring in animation films, video games and comics with his master, Wallace, since the late Eighties. The HMV group has announced, on All Fools Day this month, that it is going to switch from Nipper to Gromit in its new logo. All the shop-windows in the HMV music stores, together with advertisements in the press and in the Underground, are going to use Gromit now. This will be for three months to start with, but an indefinite extension is quite possible. HMV needed to refresh its image, so it struck a deal with the makers of Wallace amp; Gromit. It believes that such a merger of two much-loved logos would attract many more younger customers. 

 If this is just a change in marketing strategy, then why does such a piece of free-market trivia feel as if it were something more? Would it be sentimental to see this as some sort of a moment in the cultural history of human attachments? There is, after all, a deep link between what people buy and what they get attached to. The jargon of brands is close to the language of love. Besides, when one icon has to make way for another, anybody interested in the quirks of historical change would find something to think about. What penguins mean to booklovers, or lions to filmgoers, belongs to that curious realm of human familiarities that resides somewhere between the eye and the heart (and perhaps the purse too).

 Besides, dogs have their own, slightly sentimental, appeal. Does Pluto belong only to Mickey, or Snowy only to Tintin? The real Nipper was a fin de sicle dog, given to nipping at peoples legs, who was inherited by his masters brother, Francis Barraud, after his master died. Three years after Nippers death in 1895, Barraud painted him listening intently to his original masters recorded voice in an Edison-Bell cylinder phonograph. (In a fit of lugubriousness, Barraud painted both dog and phonograph on a coffin.) He was then persuaded by the Gramophone Company HMVs original name to replace the phonograph with a gramophone. The painting, now valued at 500,000, was bought by the company in 1899, and quickly became its highly successful trademark over the next couple of decades into the next century, spreading across the world as HMV got together with Victor and RCA. Nipper robustly survived the change from phonograph through gramophone to compact disc, but just when he seemed to have made it through globalization, Gromit, a wholly different breed of dog, comes into the scene. Compared to Gromits DVD-watching younger customers, Nippers people are now dodos or dead. Nipper would merrily chew up an iPod. Gromit will know exactly what to do with it.

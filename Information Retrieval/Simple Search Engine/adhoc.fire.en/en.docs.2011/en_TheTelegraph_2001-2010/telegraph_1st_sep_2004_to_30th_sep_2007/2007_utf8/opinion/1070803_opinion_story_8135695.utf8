 Letters to Editor

 Sleepless Down Under

 Under a cloud

Sir Although it is fortunate that Mohammed Haneef, the Gold Coast-based doctor of Indian origin, has been cleared of terrorism charges and allowed to return home, the manner in which his case is being handled demands probe (Home but with visa blot, July 29). It is unclear why Haneef was not issued a regular visa, neither has the Australian government explained why his cancelled work permit will not be reissued. The Australian Federal Police offered not even an apology for having detained Haneef without sufficient evidence to charge him with recklessly supporting the attempted bombing in Glasgow. Certain foreign media have raised a valid point that Haneefs life will never be the same, with the international spotlight on the case ensuring his name will be forever linked to the bungled investigation. Haneef deserves fairness and justice, not merely because of his personal harassment but also because of the trauma his family has been put through.

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Sir Given that the rate of illiteracy is quite high among Muslims in India, Mohammed Haneefs qualifications in medicine ought to make him a role model within his community. It is unfortunate, though, that Haneef chose to leave his country and pursue his professional career in Australia. Parents of bright Muslim boys like Haneef should instil in their wards a sense of patriotism and community service: what is there in a life abroad except a few dollars more and the illusion of a better lifestyle? One hopes that Haneefs bitter experience in Australia will teach young Indian professionals that staying in their own country has its own rewards.

 Yours faithfully,

Shabana Q, Chennai

 Sir All Indians must have heaved a collective sigh of relief at the news of Mohammed Haneefs release. The Australian police cannot be faulted for their strict handling of Haneefs case, since it is of the essence to proceed with caution, post-9/11, in cases of terrorism. Our sympathies are obviously with Haneef, who should have his visa and passport restored to him soon.

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta

 Sir It is disgraceful on the part of the Australian government to have falsely accused and detained Mohammed Haneef on the charge of abetment of terrorism. This should alert all countries to proceed with caution in dealing with foreign nationals. The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has already spoken to his Australian counterpart on Haneefs detention, but there is more to be done by the Indian government. 

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir The dropping of the charges against Mohammed Haneef owes much to the activism by the media and various human rights organizations. The Canberra police, under pressure, admitted to the lack of any clinching evidence to convict Haneef. The Indian government too has taken a firm stand against the arbitrary manner in which Australia handled the case. The Indian medias constant focus on the ordeals of Haneefs family in Bangalore has helped citizens understand the realities of the situation better.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir Mohammed Haneef should be thankful that he was booked under Australian law and not Indian. Indian prisons are full of undertrials, and people arrested on mere suspicion, who have been imprisoned for decades without their cases being heard. Everyone must learn to live by the laws of the country of his residence, and it is good for Haneef that the worst is over.

 Yours faithfully,

M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh

 Sir The Western media are prone to jumping to conclusions. In keeping with this tradition, they have paid scant regard to the lack of evidence and portrayed Mohammed Haneef as a convict in the British terror plots. Haneefs lawyer, Peter Russo, and certain Australian officials and rights groups have given him a new lease of life. Now the same media which had turned him into a criminal are falling over one another to get an exclusive interview with him. There is no doubt that the Indian governments support for Haneefs cause will earn it much favour from the minority communities.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir Mohammed Haneef was detained by the Australian authorities on reasonable suspicion based on reports provided by their counterparts in the United Kingdom. A thorough inquiry uncovered no evidence to charge him with complicity in terrorist activities, and he had to be released. During detention, he received fair treatment. So why are the Indian media lionizing Haneef and making such a big deal about his return? A protest would have been called for only if Haneef had been treated unfairly during interrogation. As for the withholding of his visa, it is the prerogative of the host country to grant or deny visas. If the Australian government cancels or denies a visa to Haneef, it is entirely within its right and privilege. Let us not get too sensitive about a routine case.

 Yours faithfully,

K. Venkataraman, Mumbai

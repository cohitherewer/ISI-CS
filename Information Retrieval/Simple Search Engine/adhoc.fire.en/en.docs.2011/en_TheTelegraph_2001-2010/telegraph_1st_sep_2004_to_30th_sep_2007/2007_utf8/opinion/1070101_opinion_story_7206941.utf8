 TO WORK IN PEACE 

 ARDHENDU CHATTERJEE

 The complaint of Raj Kaur, a war widow, that she is being hounded for sex over the past three years by an official as highly placed as the director of the Sainik Welfare Board, is one of the several instances of a problem that plagues many private and government organizations today. A number of women employees continue to suffer from sexual harassment in the workplace. The reality remains unchanged even after the implementation of a number of pro-women legislations like the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act and the meting out of justice in the murder cases of Priyadarshini Mattoo and Jessica Lal. The existing laws on sexual, verbal and emotional violence against women employees have been singularly ineffective in putting an end to this practice.

 Although there are exceptions, yet most organizations fail to maintain transparency in their recruitment and employment procedure. In offices with more male then female employees, the women are expected to conform to the gender stereotypes. And excepting women who are able to win the favour of their bosses, they are usually less frequently promoted than their male colleagues. 

 Male chauvinism explains why receptionists, personal assistants, typists and call centre executives must not only be women but young and good-looking as well. Women in such positions run the risk of losing their jobs once they begin to age. The desirable qualification for employment in these posts includes willingness to work longer than the stipulated time even on off days or to travel with the boss at odd hours at no extra remuneration. Married women seldom get to enjoy maternity leave with full pay. Those who dare to protest against the injustice run the risk of being dismissed peremptorily.

 Grim picture 

 Paradoxically, the percentage of working women has gone up since 2000. The employment of more women is believed to be the key to Indias probable emergence as the third-largest economy by 2040. But that probability might never become the reality if gender prejudices remain the constant obstacle to granting women equal rights in the workplace. A report by the International Labour Organization has also presented a grim picture of gender abuse affecting creativity and productivity.

 The problem has prompted the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, to open a gender resource centre under the leadership of Asha Kaul. It plans to address issues related to gender discrimination, and take up research projects to combat it in a holistic and integrated manner. The centre will also try to make people aware of the need for a proper work environment in which men and women are given equal importance. 

 But doubt remains as to whether the centre will be able to achieve its objectives, since even the national commission for women and the National Human Rights Commission often fail to come to the rescue of women who get a raw deal from their employers. Complaints of the victims are often dismissed as a malicious attempt to damage the reputation of an honest official or as an exaggerated display of mawkish sentimentality.

 Officials in the top bracket of every organization tend to suffer from the delusion of grandeur. They imagine themselves as possessing every right to exploit the women working under them. It is necessary to recognize these men first. Officials who have a record of abusing their position should never be allowed to prepare annual confidential reports or to assess the performance of employees. And anyone found guilty of abusing a woman employee should be dismissed without much ado. 

 Women must be ensured of a proper working environment if they are expected to perform at par with their male counterparts.

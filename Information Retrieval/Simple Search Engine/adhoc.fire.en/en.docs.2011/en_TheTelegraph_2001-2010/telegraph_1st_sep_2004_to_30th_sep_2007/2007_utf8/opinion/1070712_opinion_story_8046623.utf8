 IN THE LINE OF MISFIRE

 - It is no longer a question of whether Musharraf is going, 

 but when and how

 THREAT PERCEPTION

 Pervez Musharraf has been in the 

 line of fire for quite some time. Hence, one is neither 

 surprised nor shocked at the various versions of media reports 

 of July 7, on Musharrafs lucky escape from an anti-aircraft 

 gun attack. However, what appeared fascinatingly intriguing 

 was the subsequent denial by the director-general of the 

 ISIs public relations, Major General Waheed Arshad, that 

 rockets had been fired at the presidents aircraft.

 But ever since Musharraf staged 

 a coup and became president in October 1999, there has existed 

 a threat to his life from all possible and impossible corners 

 of Pakistan.

 The last serious attempts on Musharrafs 

 life took place on December 14 and December 25, 2003 respectively, 

 adjacent to the Army House, the official residence of the 

 Pakistan army chief in Rawalpindi.

 Interestingly, however, the so-called 

 assassination bid of last Friday took place near the Chaklala 

 Air Force Base, which is about 4 kms from the Army House 

 in Rawalpindi, and 10 kms from Islamabad. Chaklala is also 

 the base of 35 Composite Air Transport Wing from which 6, 

 12 and 41 squadrons operate the transport fleet of the Pakistan 

 air force. In brief, Chaklala is not only the headquarters 

 of the Pakistan air force, but also the hub of the VVIP 

 movement of the nation.

 Close to Chaklala is also stationed 

 one of the most prestigious and powerful garrisons of the 

 Pakistan army, the X Corps, at Rawalpindi. With three infantry 

 divisions, one armoured brigade and two infantry brigades 

 under the corps, the area between Islamabad and Rawalpindi 

 could easily be termed as an impregnable fortress of the 

 Orient. Yet the area was used for taking pot shots at the 

 chief of the Pakistan army who is the head of the State. 

 How could it be possible? Was the attempt on Musharrafs 

 life real or imaginary?

 It was reported by the Pakistani 

 media that the anti-aircraft guns, which were to be used 

 for shooting down Musharrafs plane, were of Russian origin, 

 thereby indicating that they could have been smuggled. However, 

 a careful scrutiny of the documents of world armament trade 

 and industry clearly shows that Pakistan till recently had 

 in possession at least four types of towed anti-aircraft 

 guns. Initially manufactured by the former Soviet Union, 

 these were later supplied from the inventory of the Chinese 

 garrison. 

 Irrespective of the nature and 

 quality of the abortive attempt on Musharrafs life on Friday, 

 from the neighbourhood of the Chaklala air force base, the 

 signs of challenge to the reign and rule of the chief of 

 Pakistan army are too obvious to be ignored. Though Musharraf 

 is not the first Pakistani army chief to resort to coup, 

 he perhaps could be the first amongst his three coup predecessors 

 (Ayub Khan, Yahya Khan and Zia-ul-Haq) to be shot by his 

 own countrymen, primarily because he appears to have tinkered 

 with the religious sentiments of his fraternity. To be fair 

 to Musharraf, that certainly would be bad for both the military, 

 mullahs and the merchants of the nation.

 If Musharraf falls in the midst 

 of bloodshed and assassination today, it would be because 

 of the long string of violence by the ruling class of Islamabad 

 for its own survival and continuation at the helm of the 

 Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the desire to prove themselves 

 as the true torch-bearers of the tenets of political Islam 

 East of Suez.

 Thus, Pakistan may not be the 

 custodian of the Qaba, but it would love to be seen championing 

 the cause of Khalistan; support, aid and abet the terrorists 

 in Kashmir; constantly challenge the Dar-ul-Harb of the 

 kafirs of Hindustan; encourage- cross-border gun-running 

 through Khyber; cause panic in the corridors of power in 

 New Delhi through misadventures like Kargil; maintain a 

 Kalashnikov culture through the ghazis and jihadis 

 across the world; and yet be branded as the frontline state 

 to fight the global war on terrorism. 

 The problem with Pakistan is that 

 Musharraf inherited a legacy of violence, and he himself, 

 as the Pakistani army chief and the president, is a product 

 of it. The writing on the wall for Musharraf is clear. It 

 is no longer a question of his staying or going. It is now 

 a question of when and how he is going. Bad days are looming 

 for the General. The flip side of the story is that Musharrafs 

 fall would be bad for the morale of the Pakistan army, since 

 it would mean that it had failed to save the life of its 

 serving commander-in-chief.

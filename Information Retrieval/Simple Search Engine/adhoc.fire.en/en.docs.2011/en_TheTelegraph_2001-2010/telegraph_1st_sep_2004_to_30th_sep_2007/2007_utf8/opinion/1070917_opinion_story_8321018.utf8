 CANUTE AT SEA

 Even a couple of months ago it would have been sacrilege to suggest that the Indian growth story could not last forever. Fifteen years ago, the prime minister had repaired the economy; now he had revved it up to permanent performance. We were destined to catch up with Japan in five years, the United States of America in ten and China in a hundred; such vaulting ambition could not bear silly interruptions. But the dauntless optimists are finding it increasingly difficult to ignore the message that is inexorably emerging from the numbers. Manufacturing growth peaked in March at 16 per cent. In the next two months it halted at 12 per cent. Then it came down to 10 per cent in the following two months. In July it was a measly 7 per cent. The decline can be slowed down by taking averages of the index for periods longer than a month; but it cannot be disguised as an advance.

 The seasonal influence should not be ignored. As the financial year nears its end in March, managers suddenly get worried about how the annual figures would look, and start whipping workers to get more output out by the last date. So March growth figures are generally exaggerated. But by April the end of the financial year is eleven months away, and managers can replace their feet on the tables. Then comes summer, when it is too hot to work. So growth figures generally decline in the first months of the financial year. Last year too, growth had fallen from the high 14 per cent reached in March, to about 12 per cent in the following two months and then to 10 per cent. But the decline this year has been more precipitate. The finance minister believes that this fall is temporary and will be reversed as the festive season approaches. He has expressed an eternal truth, for growth does normally pick up in September as workers start frantically rolling out rosogollas in preparation for the gorging that goes on in the Pujas. But he has been economical with the truth, which is that growth slumps as surely after the festive season as it rises before it.

 So the finance ministers optimism is becoming increasingly difficult to share, and the suspicion that he is being a professional optimist increasingly difficult to brush off. Particularly instructive in this respect are the figures for vehicles. The output of two-wheelers began to decline in April, just as the financial year began. This was attributed to the rising cost of loans, but it was inexplicable why costlier loans would deter buyers of motorcycles and not those of cars. But then by June, growth in car sales had also slowed down drastically. So hard times are here, and are spreading. Soon there will be only one question in peoples minds: how hard will they get?

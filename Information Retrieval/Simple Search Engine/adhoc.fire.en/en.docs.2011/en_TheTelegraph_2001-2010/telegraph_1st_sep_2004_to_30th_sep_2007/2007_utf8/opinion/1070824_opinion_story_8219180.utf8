 Letters to Editor

 Left without reason

 Sir I share Rudrangshu Mukherjees anguish over the threat posed by the leftists to the United Progressive Alliance government in relation to the Indo-US nuclear deal (The Red blunders, Aug 21). As an economist, I am most worried by the fact that if the deal is dumped, our hopes for nuclear power plants will vanish for the next 50 years. Evidently, with industries poised to take off in West Bengal, power will be one of the scarcest of resources. In particular, the Haripur power plant project will be shelved. The same fate will await the plants planned for other states. 

 The real issue in this unwarranted controversy now seems to be a clash between the Lefts ego and Indias development plans. If the country truly develops, poverty will decrease and with fewer poor people, the communists will become redundant. I do not see any difference now between the principle on which the Trinamool Congress opposed land acquisition in Nandigram and the reason why the communists have turned against the nuclear deal. Also, it is in Chinas interest to make negative remarks about Indias nuclear deal. After all, India is Chinas biggest economic rival in Asia.

 Yours faithfully,

Dipankar Dasgupta, Calcutta 

 Sir Rudrangshu Mukherjees excellent analysis of the fading communist dream makes clear that the real issue at stake in the present Indo-US nuclear treaty is not a clash of ideologies but petty political rivalries. Forty-five years have passed since the Indo-Chinese war, but the allegiances of armchair Marxists like Sitaram Yechury and Prakash Karat and their colleagues seem to have not changed one bit. For the sake of the countrys progress, the leftists in Bengal should stand apart from the politburo committee and extend support to the 123 agreement. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who is so keen on bringing capital into the state for the sake of development, surely realizes how important the signing of this deal with the United States of America is for the country to develop globally.

 Yours faithfully,

Subha Prasad Mookerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir The self-serving and archaic character of the communists needed to be exposed. The four instances when the Left betrayed national interest, chosen by Rudrangshu Mukherjee, should make leaders like Karat and Yechury question their credentials. It is a mystery why the electorate in some parts of the country continue to elect such a shamelessly unpatriotic party. Now that it is trying to stall the countrys progress once again, one hopes that the people would finally vote judiciously in the next general elections and rout them from their bastions.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir Rudrangshu Mukherjee has justly called the Lefts potential withdrawal of support to the UPA a blunder. In fact, it might prove to be suicidal for the party. After three decades of misrule, the communists in West Bengal have finally woken up to the prospect of the inflow of capital into the state. Thankfully, the Marxist leaders here have adopted a pragmatic approach to development. On the contrary, the politburo wants to remain adamantly out-of-date. How can the same party follow two different ideologies at the Centre and in the state and still not split?

 Yours faithfully,

G.C. Biswas, Barasat, Calcutta

 Sir Reading Rudrangshu Mukherjee taking on the duplicitous Left was most satisfying. The people of India needed to be reminded of the lessons of history, of how the leftists have, time and again, embraced blatantly anti-national political positions. One hopes that the politburo members, too, would be suitably chastened by their less-than-glorious past.

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Sir The communists seem to be desperately clutching on to their opposition to the Indo-US nuclear deal as their final means of challenging the UPA government. As Rudrangshu Mukherjee has pointed out, the Left is on its way to committing another blunder, if its moves succeed in toppling the UPA government. Among all the major political parties in India, it is probably the Left which has corroborated the axiom that history repeats itself. It is fortunate for India that only two of its states have had to bear the worst brunt of the Red blunders. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir The Indian Lefts echoing of Chinas negative reaction to the Indo-American nuclear treaty leaves little doubt that the Left is more faithful to Chinas interests than Indias. The sooner they reform themselves by aligning with the national interests, the better.

 Yours faithfully, 

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir The Left Front has always followed a pseudo-nationalist ideology, preferring to remain loyal to ideologies that are dictated by foreign leaders in other countries. But its allegiance to ideologies is suspect too. Our communist leaders love to spend their vacation in London and New York and rarely travel to Vietnam, China or Cuba. The failure of socialism and the surrender of China to capitalism left the Indian leftists a confused and disoriented lot. The fear of losing their political identity made them desperate to prevent the Americas influence on India. Luckily, they do not appear to have a hope of succeeding.

 Yours faithfully,

S.K. Moitra, Calcutta

 Sir The problem with the communists is that they have refused to find meaning in anything that does not subscribe to their ideology. It is ironic that waves of globalization have finally demolished their cherished principles. Not that it matters with them. After all, hypocrisy has been their chosen modus operandi for a long time now. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K.Pandey, Allahabad

 Troubled future

Fresh trouble

 Sir Big business houses seem to have rushed into retail trade (First taste of fury for Reliance Fresh, May 13). After the attack on Reliance Fresh outlets in Ranchi, Indian policy-makers must ponder the fate of millions of small traders. India does not have a welfare system for underprivileged people such as the unemployed, poor and sick. If the State cared for those without jobs, there would be a dip in the crime rate. But the Indian government cannot afford to provide for the poor in the country. Neither can it raise taxes to support the kind of welfare system that is in place in some Scandinavian nations. Therefore, the government must ensure that small shops and vendors in the neighbourhood are not displaced by big players who have entered the retail sector in recent times. As an alternative, the vendors and shop employees concerned may be provided with jobs in the public or private sector. 

 Yours faithfully,

Pradip Das, Calcutta

 Sir Small traders fear that the entry of big retail companies will wipe them out is unfounded. In fact, in China, the number of small, family-owned stores increased by about half a million even after the entry of Walmart. History teaches us that people with inadequate knowledge have always oppose the advent of something new. After the Industrial Revolution, the English Luddites broke the new textile machines while railway engines were stoned because the owners of hackney-carriages feared that they would lose their jobs. But, it did not take long for mankind to realize the worth of the new machines and the railways. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Retail chains are necessary when one considers the long-term interests of consumers. These outlets are less likely to cheat customers on quantity while they are more likely to ensure regulation of the quality of their stocks. However, the question of an alternative means of livelihood for the displaced hawkers and roadside vendors cannot be ignored. Therefore, the Union and the state governments need to reassess the ground realities before allowing an increase in the number of big retail outlets, especially in the fruit and vegetable sector. If poor vendors and daily wage-earners continue to protest against the move and take the law into their own hands, the consequences will be disastrous for industrialization. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir It is not surprising that Reliance Fresh is becoming unpopular with local wholesalers. The corporate giant should have anticipated the resistance it is facing even before it planned to set foot in retail. Although its policy of charging less than the market price is customer-friendly, such a practice is likely to jeopardize the economic survival of vendors. If the Union government does not intervene, Ranchi will go down in history, after Singur and Nandigram, as the beginning of a major resistance movement against big business across the country. 

 Yours faithfully,

Lubna Salim, Calcutta

 Sir The Central and state governments in India look for solutions only after a problem gets well out of control. Nandigram is a classic case in point. Posco and Reliance Fresh continue to meet stiff resistance because of administrative incompetence. The genesis of the problem is not in the implementation of the projects but in the planning itself. Proper homework would have convinced policy-makers that opening farm retail chains is a premature step in India. The West and the ASEAN countries had made the same mistake earlier and, at present, they are now engaged in imposing restrictions on mega retail stores. In Western cities, hawking is allowed only in certain areas. Nevertheless, the hawkers have been allowed to stay on in recognition of the fact that the State and the economy have failed to provide these people with jobs. We Indians, however, want vendors off the pavements so that we can walk in comfort. We do not care as to how these poor people will be able to make ends meet. For instance, nobody has any reasons to complain about the emergence of mobile telephony. But very few of us are willing to spare a thought for the PCO-owners, many of who have had to shut shop after the stupendous growth in mobile telephony.

 Yours faithfully,

G.D. Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir The attack on Reliance Fresh will not go down well with foreign investors. But it is not easy to distinguish between the right and the wrong in this affair. The shopkeepers certainly had no right to attack the outlets in Ranchi. But how else are poor people faced with unemployment expected to react ? The government should instruct big retail players to provide employment to the displaced vendors at the earliest. 

 Yours faithfully,

T.K. Basak, Kolaghat

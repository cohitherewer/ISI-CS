 DEVICES AND DEFENCES

 GWYNNE DYER

 Angela Merkel has a very different attitude to Russia from the last few German chancellors, perhaps because she grew up in former East Germany, under Russian control. Shes not anti-Russian, but she doesnt think that they deserve special treatment. So, when Russia suddenly cut off the flow of oil into Germany and several other countries of the European Union on January 8 because of a dispute with Belarus, she did not waste time on tact. 

 It is not acceptable, she said, when there are no consultations about such actions. That always destroys trust. It was the harshest thing that any German chancellor has said to any Russian leader since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Moreover, she said it in her capacity as the president of the EU, a post she had assumed just days before. Something is going on here.

 This is the second January in a row that Russia has pulled the plug on a neighbour for resisting massive increases in the price it paid for Russian gas and oil. Last year it was Ukraine; this year its Belarus. Moscow brought each of them to heel by turning off the taps. But that also cut off its EU customers further west, since the pipelines pass through those countries first. The EU was not amused.

 We are paying for these energy resources and are never late in our payments, said EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs, last week. We have a right to insist that you never disrupt supply. But behind Piebalgss insistence that the disruption to oil supplies we have seen in the last few days must never, never happen again was the knowledge that it might happen again. The Russian negotiating style is too muscular for the EUs taste, and what happens to Ukraine or Belarus today might happen to other Russian customers tomorrow.

 Lessons to learn

 When Moscow told Minsk that the price of gas was going up from $47 to $105 per thousand cubic metres on January 1, and that it was imposing a customs duty of $180 per tonne on the oil Belarus buys from Russia, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenkos first response was defiance: We will live in dug-outs but we will not surrender to blackmail.

 Just after New Year, Lukashenko accepted the Russian demands on oil and gas prices; but then he tried to claw the money back by imposing a $45 a tonne transit fee on all the oil passing through Belarusian pipelines to the EU. Knowing that he could never force Moscow to pay up, Lukashenko started collecting the fee in kind by diverting oil from the pipeline that crosses Belarusian territory on its way to the EU. So Moscow shut the pipeline down.

 Fair enough, in the bandit world of post-Soviet capitalism. Lukashenko gave in completely, and since he has now been forced to sell 50 per cent control of Belaruss pipelines to Russia, he will never pose this problem again. But further west, the EU is quietly re-doing its energy calculations as the lesson sinks in that it is unwise to be too dependent on energy supplies from post-Soviet Russia. (The EU imports a quarter of its oil and 42 per cent of its gas from Russia.)

 Chancellor Merkel is already saying that Germany should reconsider its plan to phase out nuclear power by 2020, although she cannot do so under the terms of the current coalition agreement with the Social Democrats. More importantly, she is urging private industry to build a network of pipelines across the EU that is connected to liquefied-natural-gas ports in Germany and elsewhere. That would give the EU, especially the former Communist countries of eastern Europe, an alternative to heavy dependence on Russian energy.

 Russia doesnt care. In the long run, it can probably sell most of its exportable oil and gas to China and other east Asian customers (though the pipelines are yet to be built). But a major strategic shift is getting underway: the EU no longer assumes that Russia is a reliable partner, or even a friend.

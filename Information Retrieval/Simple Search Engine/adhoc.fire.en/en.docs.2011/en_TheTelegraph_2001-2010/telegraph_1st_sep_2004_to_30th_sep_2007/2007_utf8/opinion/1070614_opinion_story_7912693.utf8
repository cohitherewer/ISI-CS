 Letters to Editor

 Italian affair

 Sir It is unfortunate that Argentina has rejected Indias request for the extradition of Ottavio Quattrocchi for his trial in the Bofors scam (Blow to CBI in Bofors case, June 10). Now the Central Bureau of Investigation is preparing to appeal against the local court order by June 18. The Bharatiya Janata Party has wasted no time in accusing the United Progressive Alliance government for saving Quattrocchi. While the others accused in the Bofors case have either died or fallen by the wayside, Quattrocchi remains a painful thorn for the UPA chairperson, Sonia Gandhi. For the BJP, Bofors is just another issue it can use to humiliate her to gain some political mileage. 

 However, the BJP seems to have no explanation of the fact why a Malaysian court, too, had dismissed Indias plea for Quattrocchis extradition in the absence of compelling evidence in 2002? One fails to understand why the thrust of the Bofors case should lie in finding an opportunity to humiliate the Nehru-Gandhis. The right course of action would be to focus on bringing Quattrocchi to India through diplomatic negotiations and punish him if he is found guilty after judicial proceedings. Sonia Gandhi herself should take the initiative to bring an end to this controversy by requesting the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, to see that the CBI enquiry gets underway. If Rajiv Gandhi was truly innocent of the charges that have been brought against him in the Bofors case, then Sonia Gandhi need not fear the consequences of letting the CBI investigate the case fully.

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir The CBI has, once again, failed to ensure the deportation of Ottavio Quattrocchi and initiate judicial action against him. This is not the first time that the CBI has failed to press charges against those who have committed a crime in this country and are roaming around scot-free. Previously, the proceedings of the Quattrocchi case were delayed unaccountably, raising doubts about the CBIs competence in dealing with the high-profile case. Even the Taj corridor case was allowed to drag on, and now the principle accused, Mayavati, has been given immunity by the governor of Uttar Pradesh. If such expensive investigations come to nothing, they would encourage further criminal activities. The CBI should also try to shake off the image of being a vehicle for serving the interests of the government in power. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K.Pandey, Allahabad

 Sir If one Italian lady has the power to influence the election of the next president of the country, it should be a simple job for the same lady to stop another Italian businessman, reputedly involved in shady deals, from coming to India. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Ever since Prashant Tamang has made it to Sonys Indian Idol, people from different parts of the hills have come together, irrespective of political affiliation, to support him. The editorial, For a song (June 11), has suggested, misleadingly, that certain parties have politicized this issue. The protests were spontaneous and unorganized, not just in Darjeeling, but also around Kalimpong and Kurseong, where the people protested against poor network coverage by Reliance and BSNL. The plea that all text messages were eventually delivered came after Tamang had qualified for the next round. The hill people still believe that Tamang received lesser votes than expected. And Reliance had admitted that there were some technical errors in the beginning. As far as the contest is concerned, there are no pre-existing hostilities and perception, but such a comment largely blames the hill people for being sensitive to signs of isolation and neglect. There have been enough instances in the past like the BPL classification and posting of administrative officers who cannot even speak Nepali, the official language of the hills to suggest that Bengal does not care much for the sentiments of the hill people. Before commenting on national sentiments and regional stakes, I suggest one should reflect on the kind of attention given by The Telegraph, as also by the rest of Calcutta, to Sourav Ganguly being rested during the one-day matches in Bangladesh.

 Yours faithfully,

Aditya Tamang, Darjeeling

 Sir The recent episode of Indian Idol has given rise to a huge fracas in Darjeeling. It seems that Prashant Tamang has become a local hero as well as some sort of a regional icon. Tamangs talent has shattered some national stereotypes about the people of this region. However, people have been sensitive about Tamangs success not just because he comes from this region, but also because of his vocal talents. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidhan Golay, Darjeeling

 Sir These days , Indians seem to be taking stock of real life solely through reality shows and talent hunts. Such competitions are getting trendier, but at a cost. It is not enough that the participants satisfy the judges, but they have to garner votes from their fans. There is nothing inherently wrong in this process. But the irony lies in the fact that a person whom the judges might consider mediocre could go on to win the competition because of public support. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Srikanta Bhattacharjee,Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir In Never a moment to breathe easy (June 12), Sanjib Baruah brings out an important aspect of the strategies deployed by Ulfa all in the name of ideology. In order to understand why an insurgent group sometimes targets civilians, thereby risking the chance of losing support among the ethnic constituency it claims to represent, Baruah borrows from Lisa Hultmans study to suggest that by targeting civilians, rebel groups signal to the State their high resolve to continue fighting. However, such an explanation does not help understand the low intensity-long duration conflicts such as the ones in Nagaland and Assam. Sometimes, these conflicts continue because the rebels are ideologically inflexible and do not want to negotiate with the State. And sometimes, economic institutions and opportunities are created at the local level, which imply that the benefits from a peaceful economy are fewer than the benefits of continuing the conflict for the rebels, as Baruah has himself suggested in his book Durable Disorder. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shivaji, New Haven, US

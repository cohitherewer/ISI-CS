 CHILDS PLAY

 A war of wills between father and son that ends in the death of the latter is rather unusual. But this is what seems to have happened to the teenage table-tennis champion, Biswadeep Bhattacharya. The tussle that struck him down is staged, usually with zero casualty, in most Indian families burdened with the responsibility of raising children, especially when they are going through the difficult adolescent years. Since parents are supposed to know intuitively and infallibly what is best for their children, they are given a free hand by society to decide, determine and live their offsprings lives for them. Biswadeeps father can scarcely be faulted on that score. Having identified his sons talent as a table-tennis player, and aware of its market-value like any discerning father today, he had goaded his son towards success. His efforts, with the tacit acquiescence of the other parent, paid off quite evidently. The discipline enforced on Biswadeep brought home two laurels. And there was little reason to suspect that the occasional rebellion shown by the teenager running away from home once or refusal to practice, as on his last day could not be quelled by an even firmer hand. It is unfortunate that the events which followed went out of hand.

 The violence of Biswadeeps father will, without doubt, invite all-round censure. But its extreme nature here is only different in degree from the norm of parent-child behaviour, particularly in closed, Eastern societies, where there is little recognition of the child as an individual with his or her own wishes and rights. Children become the bearers of their parents aspirations, and often their working hands. This composite emotional blackmail is often the reason why the Indian state has found it so difficult to undo the stranglehold of the family and keep children away from the labour market or guarantee their education and health. It is also the reason why, increasingly, children in the new consumerist world of urban India find themselves choosing to end their lives for the fear of failing. As parents ambitions reach the sky, children are forced to stretch their resources to the utmost in order to perform, be it in academics, sports or the numerous talent-hunt contests on television. Parents may not be resorting to the stick as often as Biswadeeps father did, and the end may not always be fatal. But the damage to the childrens self-respect is as serious.

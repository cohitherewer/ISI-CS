 BURY THE TRUTH 

 Neha Sahay

 The collapse of the huge bridge last week in Fenghuang county made frontpage news for a few days, till reporting on the disaster was banned by the Central Propaganda Department. The ban was put into force physically: reporters, even those from the ruling Communist Party publication, Peoples Daily, were beaten up when they were talking to the families of those who had been crushed underneath the debris. When the scribes asked the seven men who suddenly landed up while the interviews were on for identification, they were punched and kicked for conducting unauthorised interviews. By then, they had received calls from their editors, asking them to leave as fast as they could. 

 Newspapers have been asked not to send reporters to the disaster site, but to rely on the official news agency, Xinhua, for news. Accordingly, a report in the official mouthpiece, China Daily, without referring to the disaster, quoted experts as saying that more than 6,000 bridges across China were in a dangerous condition. The report did, however, refer to the recent bridge collapse in the United States of America!

 The ban on reporting is part of the second draft of a law on responding to sudden incidents. The first draft, circulated last year, had banned any independent dissemination of information on such incidents. Following vocal opposition from the media, the draft was changed to ban the dissemination of false information. Obviously, for the Chinese government, the words independent reporting and false reporting mean the same. Interestingly, the new draft also includes punishments to local authorities who try to cover up such incidents. So will those who sent the goons be punished?

 Hidden stories

 Given the scale of the disaster, the prime minister himself has ordered an inquiry in which no one will be spared. The contractors were a state-owned company. One report mentioned that the bridge, almost complete after three years of construction, was based on the traditional stone-and-concrete style, instead of the modern steel model, to ensure it remained in harmony with the natural environment. 

 But what has remained of the natural environment? Fenghuang town, ringed by mountains, is one of Chinas ancient river towns preserved through the ages, its beauty celebrated in literature and in painting. Its stilt houses on the river banks are a major tourist attraction. Interestingly, a group of local businessmen has actually secured the tourism rights to the valley for 1,20,000 yuan. They spend a small part of the profits on the education of village kids. 

 One columnist noted that Fenghuangs ancient charm had remained intact precisely because it had remained inaccessible, the mountains and river surrounding it acting as natural barriers. Already, he said, tourism had given rise to a new town alongside the old one, which was nothing more than an amusement park with dazzling neon lights, noisy vehicles and karaoke bars. (Gaudy neon lights and karaoke bars are the hallmark of every Chinese city, including Beijing and Shanghai.) The 1000-feet long, 42-metre high bridge, connecting the town to the nearest airport, was an eyesore said the columnist, amid the paddy fields and old style homes. It also brought in many more outsiders, he added. 

 At the same time, he wrote, how could one object to the towns desire to live the good life? But was it really the townsfolks idea? Expats who have visited the place recall feeling like intruders as they walked through the picturesque villages, as villagers went through their routine chores. The only ones who welcomed them were youngsters dying to meet outsiders. 

 Most of the 41 who died were local farmers employed to remove the scaffolding. But their stories may never be told.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 BRINGING MATTERS 

 TO A HEAD 

 Ananda Lal

 Theatre

 Shohans new offering, Helmet, 

 directed by Anish Ghosh, finds the Bengali group attaining 

 a peak in fluid acting and production values. These are 

 boosted by Sanchayan Ghoshs detailed mise en scne 

 for a police station followed by a Calcutta crossroads. 

 The play itself, written by Rajat 

 Ghosh, starts off on an entertaining note inside a typically 

 dysfunctional thana with its clueless staff (picture). 

 It would get lots of laughs if not for the fact that in 

 this city, the state of law and order is no laughing matter.

 The policemen have a problem: 

 one of them has lost his headgear, which is eventually tracked 

 down to the top of his traffic kiosk where he had placed 

 it. Unfortunately, a pair of crows has laid eggs in it, 

 and not only is nobody able to retrieve it, but PeTA activists 

 insist that the nest should not be disturbed until the chicks 

 fly away. Under pressure to protect the feathered fiends, 

 the cops block traffic at this intersection. 

 All this makes great satire until 

 the going gets serious as the enthusiastic police evict 

 nearby pavement- dwellers too. The Ghoshes underline the 

 contrast between preservation of avians and of humans. Helmet 

 concludes on this grave social turn, at odds with the tone 

 in the beginning.

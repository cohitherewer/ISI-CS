 Letters to Editor

 The prime minister and the CII president

Unjust reprimand

 Sir Manmohan Singh has stressed the need to cut down the salaries of industrial big bosses to avoid social unrest (Industry told to rein in prices, May 25). However, the prime minister should also have mentioned the innumerable government employees who exploit the State through trade unions for higher salaries and bigger perquisites. Unfortunately, even after their demands are met, there is no visible increase in efficiency and output. Therefore, mere caps on the salaries of chief executive officers will not help in battling poverty and bridging the income-consumption divide. However, Singh was absolutely right about the need for CEOs to check the rapid price rise and plough back company surpluses into business. This is the best that business leaders can do to help the country. 

 Yours faithfully, 

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir Instead of preaching sermons, Manmohan Singh should bring back a bit of socialism in his governments economic policies, which, after liberalization, have been increasingly favouring the rich. Singh, however, is justified in saying that disparities in pay-structures and perks, between top executives and the rest, can lead to social unrest. Why doesnt the Union government impose a ceiling on the pay-packets and privileges of high-ranking executives in the private sector? 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir The prime ministers advice and admonition are contrary to what he preached as a reformist finance minister in 1991. The concept of corporate social responsibility, especially with regard to the remuneration of CEOs, the profit motive, unemployment and underemployment, is not novel. 

 Besides, CSR often works against the needs of an economy in the long run. Given the difference in the output and efficiency levels between public and private sector employees, the prime minister should first figure out how the government treasury needs to deal with errant employees on its payroll. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir Manmohan Singhs advice to corporate India to shun greed, graft and glitzy lifestyles, and to share the gains of economic growth with the man on the street, is welcome. He wants companies to offer more jobs to the scheduled castes and tribes, the other backward classes, minorities and women. But his advice would have been even more welcome if he had desired more jobs for women and the poor, without discrimination on the basis of caste and creed. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.P. Ghosal, Calcutta

 Sir It is difficult to believe that the Manmohan Singh advising industry leaders to reduce the salaries of their top executives, in order to reduce the income gap, is the same man who, more than a decade ago, had given the assurance that his economic liberalization would benefit even the lowest stratum in society by the trickle down effect. But, the corporate sector has continued to create national wealth. Asking it now to curb salaries is more a mark of governmental failure than corporate. Hence, Singhs colleagues in government should answer as to why poverty persists in India. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Bangalore

 Sir The prime ministers concern for the national interest is laudable but, as an economist, he has failed to analyse, correctly and honestly, the present socio-economic problems. Political and bureaucratic corruption is responsible for the failure of economic reforms to generate prosperity for one and all, not some CEOs high salary. Unlike private sector executives, government employees are not punished for their inefficiency and corruption. Singh should, first of all, subject his tainted colleagues to investigation and punishment. The State should then recover the money illegally pocketed by politicians and bureaucrats for decades and use it to help the poor. 

 Yours faithfully,

B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore 

 Sir The prime ministers call to trim salaries of top corporate executives is shocking. After all, the poor work environment and the nepotism in the public sector compel professionals to seek employment in private companies. Consequently, if they get rewarded for their hard work, the government has no right to interfere. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kapasi, New Delhi

 Sir Although Manmohan Singhs advice about trimming the pay packets of CEOs is well-meant, it is not economically sound. Before economic liberalization, CEOs received salaries low enough to push the best corporate brains out of the country. Despite their high salaries today, CEOs are less responsible for poverty than flawed governmental policies. Singh should accurately locate a problem before suggesting solutions.

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 Left high and dry

 Now that the Bahujan Samaj Party has won a majority in Uttar Pradesh, opposition leaders are bending over backwards to mend ties with Behenji. But Maya memsaab is in no mood for charity. Consequently, her rivals are having to eat humble pie. During the counting, as the BSP took the lead, Salman Khurshid, the UP Congress chief, declared that his party had offered to support the BSP. By evening, the BSP had a majority, prompting Mayavati to scupper Khurshids pledge of support. Khurshid wasnt the only one getting the cold shoulder from Mayavati. Raj Babbar, with one seat in his partys kitty, was quick to back the BSP. When Mayavati heard this, she pretended as if Babbar did not even exist. Meanwhile, Ajit Singh, along with many other independents, also found that there were no takers for them this time around. But none dared to criticize Mayavatis show of disdain. Instead, they chose to blame the electorate and the EC for their fate.

 More on UP. Congressmen had pinned their hopes on the prince to bring about a change in electoral fortunes. But Rahul Gandhi let them down badly, with the Congress getting only 22 seats, three less than last time. Rahuls critics, however, say that they are not surprised with the outcome. Apparently, the young Gandhi only mouthed what his poll managers taught him, without bothering to check the facts. Sometimes, the consequences were disastrous For instance, when Rahul went to campaign for Anugraha Narain Singh, the Congress candidate in Allahabad north, he implored the voters to elect the youngest vote-seeker (Aap log yuva candidate ko vote dekar jitaiye). Now, the only candidate truly young happened to be the BSPs Harsh Bajpai, who is in his thirties. Singh is in his late fifties, while the BJPs Narendra Gaur is elder to him. Such gaffes on the part of the young Gandhi have not gone down well with Congressmen. But Rahuls comments did bring a smile on one mans face. Ashok Bajpai, Harshs father and a former Congressman, was heard telling one and all that Rahulji Harsh ke liye canvassing kar gaye.

 Television channels in India work in mysterious ways. Many of them keep churning dull stories throughout the day, while killing genuinely interesting reports by giving them a brief airtime. Look at what happened to the Shotgun affair. Shatrughan Sinha was caught berating Amar Singh and his friend, Amitabh Bachchan, after the BJP MP had refused a box of sweets that Big B had sent across to him after the Abhishek-Aishwarya wedding. Two television channels aired images of Sinha taking on the Amar-Amitabh duo, and the viewers loved every minute of this high profile exchange. But the audience was in for a nasty surprise the next day. The story had vanished altogether from the bulletins. Another Hindi channel had recently claimed that the Italian businessman, Ottavio Quattrocchi, had met an LTTE operative in a Paris hotel. That story died an instant death as well. Perhaps, it is time the news networks did some serious soul-searching before they go to town with such sensational claims.

 Mayavatis thumping victory has brought cheers even to a corner in Bollywood. Kailash Masoom, a small-time film-maker, is now rushing to Lucknow to get his pet project, Behenji The Great Sister, officially approved by the original Behenji. This is not the first time that Masoom would be calling on the BSP chief. He had approached her earlier, only to be told to wait till the results came out. It has been worth the wait for Masoom. With the UP crown sitting pretty on Mayavatis head, Masoom can hope for a decent opening for his film.

 Half-a-dozen babus residing in a plush government colony were in for a nasty surprise recently. To their horror, the officials discovered that someone had stolen the copper stop-valves from the overhead storage tanks, flooding the roofs. The men promptly punched in a couple of numbers and asked the near-by CPWD office to look into the matter so that the valves could be replaced. Each of them got the standard response. They were asked to file a police report first and then send the authorities a copy of their complaint. That, according to the CPWD, would help its office decide whether the claim was real or not, and whether a replacement was needed at all. The delay reportedly led to a colossal wastage of potable water over several days. Hopefully, the incident would help babus realize that sometimes even top-ranking bureaucrats can get tangled in their own web.

 Footnote

 What is Sachin Tendulkar doing these days, now that he has been rested from the one-day matches against Bangladesh? If comic book illustrator, Jeevan Kang, is to be believed, Tendulkar would soon be seen fighting aliens, instead of scoring sixes of bowlers on the cricket pitch. Kang is working on creating a super-hero out of Tendulkar, who, in his new avatar, would not only don an armoured suit but also perform magnificent feats la Superman and Batman. Of course, India has had its share of comic heroes before. Virgin Comics, which created characters such as the Indian spiderman, Devi and the Snake Woman, is now waiting to unleash the master blaster who is going to wield his willow against the baddies. But going by Tendulkars current form on the pitch, one wonders whether Kang would have been better off selecting Mahendra Singh Dhoni instead of Tendulkar as the man who would save the world.

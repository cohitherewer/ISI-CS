 TO BE LESS THAN EQUAL

 Malvika Singh

 We have a new chief justice of India, an officer who wields great power. And instead of hailing him as one who has reached the top as a good and honest professional, we keep screaming out his caste credentials, calling him the first-ever Dalit to occupy that exalted chair. Surely, a person who is deemed to be the protector of the Constitution should have a track record of substance and not be celebrated for having been born into a particular caste.

 So much for equality. Differentiation of this kind singling out individuals on lines of caste, class and faith is what causes discrimination. As a young student in school, I was never conscious of who was a Muslim, or a Hindu or a Jain till one morning at the assembly, when the principal asked all Muslims to raise their hands. He had set them apart. 

 As one grew older, this rather despicable truth became more and more real, polarizing multicultural communities instead of uniting them under one flag. Then, the other backward classes were identified and compelled to stand apart, forcing another kind of separation. So, in the 60th year of Indias independence we have a Dalit as chief justice. Big deal. Are these men and women mere tokens of our sense of equality? When will India start judging the leadership in politics, administration and institutions on the basis of merit?

 Left behind

 Reservation based on caste and gender is, in fact, insulting to the groups included in the list. Governments have failed, over the decades, to establish equal opportunities for all in primary schools from where the problem of discrimination emanates. Some have access, others do not. Upper castes get to be literate, go to school, and are able to compete at some level or another. Administrators in the districts have not been able to enforce the law of the land and have allowed upper castes to discriminate against lower castes. Opportunities have been consciously denied to the lower castes and the backward classes. It is a scandal for which no administrator has been punished. To reserve a group or tribe or community today is one way of absolving the guilt of failed governance and administration.

 We are being left behind in a rapidly-moving world, where ideas and experiments have energized diverse peoples. We have isolated ourselves from debate and discourse, wallowing in the mire. Our young are being denied their place under the sun only because our old cling on to power, unable to let go. Greed and insecurity have become character traits of those in the public domain, and this has put India back in thinking as well as in action. 

 Cry freedom

 Rusted minds rule policy that will determine the course for future generations. That is the reason for our continuing backwardness. Education and human resource development desperately need, at their helm, modern contemporary leadership, untainted by parochial positions and devoid of archaic beliefs and ideologies.

 Will 2007, the60th anniversary of independence, bring in its wake freedom from illiteracy, from hunger, and, most of all, from corruption and political exploitation for all across the board? Or will the ruling class continue to indulge in endless talk, peppered with promises, high-handedness but resulting in zero action? Will the same class that failed to deliver dignity and pride, work only for its own reserved clansmen? Will India and Bharat ever emerge from the stranglehold of those men and women who have lassoed the majority? Will the GenNext assert itself and break through this horror we have been subjected to for sixty years under home rule and for centuries under invaders and colonizers? Or will we remain helpless victims?

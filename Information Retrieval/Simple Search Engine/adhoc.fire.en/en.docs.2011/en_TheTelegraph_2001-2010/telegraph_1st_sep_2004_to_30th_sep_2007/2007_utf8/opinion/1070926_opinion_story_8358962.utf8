 COOL MAN WITH BIG GLOVES 

 Raju Mukherji

 A few days ago, Mahendra Singh Dhoni was selected to lead India in the forthcoming one-day internationals against Australia. At the same time, a buzz went 

 round that Sachin Tendulkar would be the captain of the Test team. Some experts said that this would be the first time the Indian cricket team would have different captains for Tests and ODIs. This, however, is not true. The precedent of split captaincy in India was set earlier, when Dhoni was named the captain for the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa. At the time of the announcement, Rahul Dravid was leading the Indians in both versions of the game in England. 

 The national selection committee deserves to be commended for nominating Dhoni as the skipper, first for the Twenty20 World Cup and then for the one-day series against Australia after Rahul Dravid stepped down from the captaincy. Dhoni is the ideal choice. Cool and composed, he is a fast learner and a selfless character. He does not believe in sledging and is hugely popular, both as a player and as a person. Surprisingly, despite his huge fan following, Dhoni remains the soft-spoken, ever-smiling gentleman that he was when he first came under the spotlight. 

 Dhoni is certainly not the first wicket-keeper to lead India though. Syed Kirmani had captained India on one occasion. Later, Dravid skippered India as well, while donning the big gloves. Even Farokh Engineer, though not the official captain, had deputized for Ajit Wadekar at Eden Gardens in 1972-73. 

 Significantly, Dhonis emergence as captain has interesting parallels with Mansur Ali Khan Pataudis story. Pataudi, like Dhoni, had no prior experience of leading a team even in domestic matches when he was appointed vice-captain to Nariman Contractor on the tour of the West Indies in 1962. When Contractor was laid low by the fearsome Charlie Griffith at Bridgetown, the captains crown passed to Pataudi. Similarly, after Dravids abrupt resignation, the selectors had little option but to thrust Dhoni on the throne. 

 Keep the faith

 For Pataudi, Polly Umrigar was a reassuring presence during his captaincy. Dhoni too would benefit from the guidance of Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Dravid. Their presence, far from inconveniencing Dhoni,would actually prove to be a blessing for the young leader. Being very much his own man, Dhoni would definitely take his own decisions, executing them in the manner he likes. At the same time, he is respectful towards his seniors and tries hard to learn from them. 

 One only hopes that Dhoni would not follow the examples set by former Indian captains who put more emphasis on provincial rather than national interests. Dhoni, therefore, should guard himself against this tendency to prioritize parochial considerations over the national concerns. 

 Captaincy, in India, has never been free of controversy. In 1936, the Maharajkumar of Vizianagram, popularly known as Vizzy, conspired to have himself elected as captain. The team fared disastrously under him. The assessment of Indian cricket captains has also often defied logic. C.K. Nayudu, considered to be one of Indias best captains, led the side in four official and in three unofficial Test matches but could not win any of them. Wazir Ali, on the other hand, won two unofficial Tests with depleted teams, but is a forgotten man today. 

 There is more proof of the whimsical nature of Indian captaincy. On one occasion, in 1958-59, India created a record of sorts by having 6 Test captains in 6 months. The situation now is certainly better than what it was 50 years ago. The selectors have done the right thing by nominating Dhoni as captain. Now, they should give him time to settle down so that the man from Ranchi proves to be a winner as the skipper as well.

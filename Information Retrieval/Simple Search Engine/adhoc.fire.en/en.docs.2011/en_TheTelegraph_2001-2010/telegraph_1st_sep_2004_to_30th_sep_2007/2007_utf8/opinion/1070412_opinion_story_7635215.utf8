The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 PETTY CONCERNS

 Diehard patriots should have zeroed in on Sachin Tendulkar and Mr N.R. Narayana Murthy for their suspect allegiances earlier. After all, Tendulkar failed to win the World Cup for India before he ran his knife through the tri-coloured cake in Jamaica, and Mr Murthy has been catering to foreigners demands for close to two decades now. And why only them, the jingoists should be hauling up all the sports authorities in the country, especially those staging international meets, which invariably play the instrumental version of the national anthem when winners receive their medals. The organizers, in fact, are doubly culpable. They not only show disrespect to the national anthem by not airing the song itself, but are also discourteous to the anthems of the innumerable other nations that participate in the games. Mr Murthy seems to have made an error of the same magnitude. But, unlike the men in charge of sports tournaments, he has been severely criticized and forced to issue an apology for his unpardonable crime committed on the Infosys campus when the president of India came visiting. 

 The charges against the two national icons follow a pattern which has become an established routine in the country. Without realizing how ridiculously juvenile the obsessive protectionism towards national symbols appears to be, individuals, governments and even the judiciary, at times, have pointed fingers, passed strictures and amended laws to castigate anyone who is perceived as lacking in patriotism. People have been forced to stand up to the singing of the national anthem at the end of a film show by a government order or admonished for their apparent frivolity while wearing a dress made out of the national flag. It is this token respect for the tricolour, anthem and the Constitution, which is supposed to attest a citizens loyalty to the country. The other, more onerous, responsibility of living up to the ideals of truth, honesty and tolerance symbolized by these is conveniently swept under the carpet. Both Tendulkar and Mr Murthy have brought unadulterated glory to the country. The nitpicking over their alleged failings only highlights the countrys failure to rise above the banal. Instead of being mired in trivialities, symbols of national honour should be freed of the histrionics that has come to be associated with patriotism.

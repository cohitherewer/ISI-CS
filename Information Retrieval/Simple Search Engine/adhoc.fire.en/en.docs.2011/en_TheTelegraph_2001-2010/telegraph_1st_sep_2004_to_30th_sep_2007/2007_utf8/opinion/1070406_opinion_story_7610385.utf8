 DEBATE AND DISCUSS 

 Bonafide - Malvika Singh

 My last column brought one reaction that suggested I had been unfair in my criticism of the prime minister, Manmohan Singh. I had said that his mentor, the former prime minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, had been politically incorrect, and happened to be at the right place at the right time vis--vis the initiation of economic reforms. Views differ, and criticism of government policy initiatives and of those who shepherd them is healthy because we expect from our national leadership judgments that are broad- based and dynamic and do not permit parochial interests or petty politics from entering the decision-making process.

 Rao played politics. Many Congress supporters hail him for having completed his full term as a non-Gandhi Congress prime minister. But this is superficial, to say the least. In this context, it is equally unfair to dismiss Sonia Gandhi, to cite one example. She is constantly damned by the opposition and also by some in the Congress. 

 Here are some questions why has the Congress leadership not been able to stand up and defy what they refer to as court politics? Why has it not been able to put forward an alternative leadership? Is it because most of the contenders cannot win an election and do not have a constituency? Why do they always blame the present Congress president for being dictatorial? Are all these political men and women weak and mindless, unable to debate and move on? Why do they constantly complain and then fall in line? Why this hypocrisy? Why this inability to argue for interventions that contradict decisions? Why cant the party survive without Sonia Gandhi and now, Rahul Gandhi? Why is there no serious analysis of the political role and position of the Gandhis?

 Role model

 At the risk of being deemed a chamcha because that is always the easy way to damn another view I am willing to point out that Sonia Gandhi and her son are out there, in the field, nurturing their constituencies, fighting elections. They cannot be faulted on those grounds. Sonia Gandhi could have been prime minister but chose not to for many reasons some of which were personal and the others apparent and obvious. She is much too astute to allow an assault on herself and on her party for the many irrelevant reasons the issue of her foreign origin for instance raised by all those opposed to her within and outside the Congress. She assumed, by the single act of giving up the gaddi, the mantle of conscience-keeper of the present government.

 Sonia Gandhi has played her role actively. She has intervened ever so often to ensure further discussion and debate on issues that affect the masses. It is easy to condemn all such interventions that call for a rethink, and describe them as populist because they interfere with the simplistic model of restructuring. It is far more difficult, intellectually, to devise methods that are all-inclusive and growth-oriented. India needs the latter. We need to look at where all those Western models failed, learn from that experience and create a flexible, supple and energetic model that is democratic, that fits the cultural context, that absorbs the realities and creates the space for growth and change.

 The Right to Information Act has had bureaucrats running for cover. The intervention that allowed for notings on files to remain within the purview of RTI gave the act its teeth. The questioning of the wholesale handover of retail has triggered debate. Special economic zones, and whether we need them at all, also merit discussion. Land-grabbing by governments on behalf of rich industrialists is unacceptable to many. Why dont those who want vast tracts of land negotiate with the owners directly? Surely, that is the democratic way of executing land deals. Surely we cannot shun debates.

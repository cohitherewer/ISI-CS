 JUST SO

 The principle of equality under the law leaves the dispensers of law in a slightly anomalous position. They might be anxious to be accountable, but to whom would they go with their accountability? In a democracy such as Indias, another principle so crucial as to be non-negotiable is the independence of the judiciary. History has shown what happens to democracy if that is breached. The objections from 10 high courts across the country to the judges (inquiry) bill, 2006 for establishing a national judicial commission to investigate allegations of misbehaviour and incapacity of judges spring mainly from this argument. The fear is that such a law would compromise the independence of judges and prevent them from deciding freely. This is especially so because the proposed act has introduced a complaint procedure, while the earlier 1968 act it seeks to replace had just a reference procedure. The latter is routed through the Houses of Parliament and has constitutional backing. By the complaint procedure, anyone can bring a charge of misbehaviour or incapacity against a judge, although neither of these terms is specifically defined. This would open up the possibility of charges impelled by vested interests, and also make a judge feel less free when passing judgment.

 The bill has been formulated to bring about greater transparency in judiciary and to make judges more accountable. The application of law alone ensures transparency. One of the main problems in the Indian justice system is the excess of cases, inevitable in so litigious a nation. Crime too has increased, together with easier access to courts. One of the first needs is to introduce a screening system that would, for example, prevent useless or motivated public interest litigations from coming into court. Timely appointments of judges, decent infrastructure in courthouses enough chairs and bathrooms and fans so that judges can work comfortably for a full day would all help improve accountability. Cluttering up the system with councils and commissions while giving so many judges a feeling of constriction is hardly desirable. With less clutter, the checks and balances within the justice system would be effective enough. Ultimately, a judge is accountable to the people he judges, to his own discipline and to his conscience.

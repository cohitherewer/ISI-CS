 MYSTERY CHILDREN

 Children can sometimes be strange creatures impressionable, full of adventure, like most other children, but together with all this, brutally violent, like adult criminals. Such extreme, muddled behaviour can radically upset the way most societies and legal systems want to perceive and deal with children. Also, in the Indian juvenile justice system, anybody below the age of 18, no matter what his mental and physical capacities, is a child. Three teenage boys in Ahmedabad, all studying in Class IX, were inspired recently, by the television crime serials they are addicted to, to murder their six-year-old neighbour. Their victim was a bankers son, so they thought his father would be rich enough to pay a hefty ransom, with which one of them the 15-year-old master plotter had planned to run away and live happily ever after. They kidnapped the boy, but realized that they had got his phone number wrong, which made it difficult to call up his parents and ask for the ransom. They had already bound and gagged the boy, so now they strangled him with two handkerchiefs.

 The automatic reaction to such an incident would be to condemn crime serials and blame parents for allowing children to watch everything indiscriminately on TV. Schools, parents, censor boards, and the information and broadcasting minister are all going to find this the easiest way to react to such a perplexing incident. But surely, the situation, particularly for the courts, is far more complicated than this. TV crime serials are not the only place where children might be exposed to the combination of greed and violence. Everyday habits and situations that look far more innocuous can inculcate similar values in children. And there is no reason to assume that childhood is a uniform, undifferentiated phenomenon that would beautifully correspond to all the adult myths about it. Unthinking prohibition born out of facile equations between stimulus (violent films) and response (violent action) will not crack the puzzle of juvenile brutality.

 Beyond the Three Seas: Travellers Tales of Mughal India 

 Edited by Michael H. Fisher, 

 Random House, Rs 350

 What could be common to a 15th-century Russian horse-dealer, a 16th-century Venetian merchant and a Portuguese Catholic priest, and a 17th century cabin-boy from Cornwall? Wanderlust. And the fact that it drove all of them across seas, oceans, mighty rivers and unassailable roads to discover the East for themselves, and for posterity. Some of those who reached the Indian shores during these early years of global contact turned out to be compulsive writers. They picked up the pen even under the most trying circumstances, after a back-breaking journey or amid gunfire, or in the comforting lap of their motherland, recounting their travails for a readership that was growing more and more hungry for stories from distant lands.

 Writing travelogues, however, was never the primary concern or the only occupation of these early travellers. They had more mundane matters at hand. Most of those who arrived in Mughal India in the 15th and 16th centuries (the period under consideration) were here for self-aggrandizement. Some tried to make wealth through trade; others, as employees of companies, pleaded with rulers and noblemen for grant of trading rights. Still others, as missionaries, spread the word of god among the heathens. The writings they subjected themselves to were sometimes a personal record of their experiences that was never meant for publication. At other times, these were self-conscious travel narratives meant for the entertainment of an immediate circle of friends or for a larger audience, who needed to be briefed and warned about the ways of a different world.

 This world was yet to acquire its distinctive Otherness. There was still no conscious effort at systematizing the acquired knowledge to build up or affirm the idea of the Orient. As William Dalrymple reminds in his preface, the early traveller, given his vulnerabilities as a weak and defenceless wanderer in a powerful Islamic empire, was very different from the high colonial. He may express his reservations for native customs, habits and religion, but this is devoid of the typical hauteur of the later Victorians. In fact, through his adaptation to his surroundings, native habits and food, the early traveller shows a degree of assimilation that becomes unimaginable later on. The editor of this book, Michael H. Fisher, however, sounds a slightly different chord. Perhaps because it is difficult to completely overlook the culturally superior posturings of the travellers even during this period all of which fed into later notions of the Other he calls these men unwitting contributors to later colonialism. Fisher acknowledges that besides reflecting the values of their time and that of each individual traveller, these accounts had profound effects on Europes perception of India.

 Fisher selects ten travel-writers over a period of two centuries (1471-1671) to cover the entire sweep of the Mughal era. There is Nikitin, who predated Baburs conquest; Federici and Monserrate arrived during the reign of Akbar, Hawkins during Jahangirs, Mundy, Manrique and Manucci in the time of Shah Jahan; and Bernier, Tavernier and Navarrete travelled around during the reign of Aurangzeb. But more than the quirks of individual rulers or the splendour of their court, what this disparate selection in Beyond the Three Seas lays bare is the life on the streets with all its dangers, ugliness and beauty. 

 The early travellers appear to be terribly vulnerable creatures. They are victims of highway robbers, crafty chieftains, whose protection they needed, political disquiet, competition from rival foreigners, and, of course, the inclement Indian weather and road conditions. Cesare Fedirici, who travelled from Vijaynagar to Goa, talks of great trouble during the journey for that every day we were taken Prisoners, by reason of the great dissension in that Kingdome. Peter Mundy, who was in charge of transporting his companys goods from Agra to Surat, was moved to desperation by his ever-straying carts, the constant loss of his bullocks or camels, the quarrels of his camel-drivers and bullock-carters, and the blackmail of imperious noblemen.

 The slice of ordinary life provided by these travellers is varied and colourful. Nikitin talks of the wonderfully hospitable inns throughout his route where food was cooked for the guests by the landlady, who also makes the bed and sleeps with the stranger. Travellers throughout the period continue to praise the services provided by the caravanserais. There are vivid descriptions of the practice of sati, gods, goddesses and savage festivals, socio-economic disparities among the rulers and the ruled, flora and fauna, gigantic crocodiles and birds like gookook, which brought death to the house they chose to sit on. Some travellers taste their first paan and observe the production of opium. They also understood the caste system, but only in its rudiments. Despite intermarriages, inter-dining, the prescriptions of caste continued to isolate the white-skinned as pariah jati.

 Isolated from their faith and people, the travellers remained solitary journeymen, in mind and sometimes in body, depending solely on their own instincts and cunning to save themselves from disaster and death. It was Manuccis ability to carry out to perfection the art of paying obeisance to the Mughal royalty that saved him from destitution. And Friar Sebastien Manrique depended on his own assumption of the beguiling influence of a lovely face, strengthened by the seal of matrimony when he bribed the wife of the magistrate with a embroidered taffeta in order to free his servant, who was guilty of throttling two peacocks to death. 

 The two writers who stand out in this collection are Peter Mundy and Franois Bernier, the first for the ugliness of his prose and the latter for its beauty. One wonders why Fisher had to inflict page after page of Mundys insufferable description of his journey when a few pages would have been enough to bring out his angst. The selection from Berniers description of his journey to Kashmir in 1664-65 with the Mughal royalty, the laying of tents, his guile in forcing Kashmiri women to show their faces, and his visit to the mosque in Baramula where he discovers the treachery of the mullahs but decides to play on with a straight face would remain an all-time great in travel-writing.

 TANTRIC-INSPIRED DISASTER

 Ananda Lal

 Theatre

 Anglophone theatre circles dare not speak the name of this play, for superstition has it that when they do, all hell breaks loose from fire in the auditorium to booms crashing down on actors. Fortunately, I have never witnessed any such physical catastrophe in any production of this Shakespearean tragedy so far, but it is equally true that all of them have fallen short of acceptable standards. Does the curse of M (shh) continue?

 Yes, on the basis of Alyque Padamsees much-ballyhooed Tantric inspired disaster. Consider his facile programme note: Quite a few of Shakespeares plays have metaphysical elements. This must be a major conceptual discovery of which we were unaware. Most of them are light and airy like A Midsummer Nights Dream. However, Macbeth (oops) is one of his dark metaphysical ones.

 Even if we concede that directors are not required to be great writers, a preface like that takes the cake as far as waffle is concerned. Then, after he raises the intriguing possibility that the power that Lady Macbeth wields over her husband brings to mind the power of Shakti, all we see on stage are treacly bits of tantric icing on a cake that remains solidly textual rather than theatrical. So the play opens with the Lady doing an apology for an item number round an oversized cauldron, from which six arms slowly rise, hinting deliciously at a cannibalistic broth but turning out to be attached to three bedraggled witches.

 The rest of the tantra comprises M n M topping off their first meeting with a mating, standing joined at the hips and torsos bent backwards, and Louiz Banks theme music erupting like a pop-up ad every ten minutes and sounding something like Bring Sting, rock king. By tantra, Banks evidently understood the night spot on Park Street.

 What about Shakespeare? Padamsee announced his enterprise as one in which he stuck to the original words. Utter balderdash. Not only did he murder the script, deleting important speeches and soliloquies with no reason from the Bards shortest tragedy (the Porters omission recalls Bowdler), he also changed vocabulary liberally. For The multitudinous seas incarnadine,/ Making the green one red, he replaced green with blue. Possibly, he thinks that Mumbai viewers visualize a blue sea easier than a green one.

 The acting is flat and uninspiring. Everyone elocutes; it might actually work as a radio drama. In the lead, Vijay Crishna struggles manfully with a Scot brogue, his slurs giving the impression that he always stores some Scotch under his belt. I feel sad for the very talented Lushin Dubey, trapped in a characterization imposed on her. Farrid Currim looks so ludicrous each time he grimaces balefully as Banquo at the banquet that he reminds me of his career as a comedian. As for costumes, my student designers can do a more stunning job than Tarun Tahiliani, and at a fraction of the cost.

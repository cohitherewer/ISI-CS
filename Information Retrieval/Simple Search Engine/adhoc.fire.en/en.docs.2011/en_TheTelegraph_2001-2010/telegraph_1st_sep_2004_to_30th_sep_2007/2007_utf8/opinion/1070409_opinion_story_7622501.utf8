 NO CLASSES

 What is the proper role of the political in unversity campuses? From the late Sixties and well into the Seventies, student politics in some of the best European, American and Indian universities and colleges created a degree of social ferment that could almost have been revolutionary. History remembers these episodes as poised between wrongheaded idealism and tragic waste. Campus politics in India is often a complex and violent affair, as the recent episode in Jadavpur University demonstrates, involving repeated vandalism and assault, apart from the disruption of classes. The conflict was between an independent student body, without any obvious party affiliations, which had won the elections, and a union with a well-established party-political affiliation, which had lost. The matter, therefore, is unavoidably political (in the least exalted sense of the word) as well as one of law and order, asking for disciplinary action by the authorities.

 In a modern democracy, it is only desirable that quality higher education should produce intelligent and proactive political subjects. University students are also adult citizens. But politicization, as it actually happens in most Indian campuses, becomes quite another game, divorced from principles or even ideology, and yoked to ambitions that have much more to do with power than with any ideals of social justice. From admissions to appointments to elections, partisanship determines the role of the student unions. Last year, the Centre received a directive from the Supreme Court, together with recommendations from the Lyngdoh committee, asking it to devise ways of freeing student elections from disruptive party politics. Universities will have to consider regulations along those lines, without turning into repressive institutions. This is a difficult balance, and the nature of the Indian polity does not help.

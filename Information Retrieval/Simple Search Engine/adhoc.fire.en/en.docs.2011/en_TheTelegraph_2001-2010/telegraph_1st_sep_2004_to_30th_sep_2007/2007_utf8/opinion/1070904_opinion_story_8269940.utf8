 SWEEP AWAY THE MUCK

 MALA 

 FIDE - Malvika Singh

 When two people from the same gotra marry and have a child, and the village sarpanch, along with the panchayat, ensure the kidnapping of that child from its legitimate parents, how come the sarpanch and his council members are not booked for breaking the law? Why is it that the Haryana government official is not booked under the Wildlife Act for digging a canal in a prohibited area? Are national laws meant to affect only those who do not work for government or for quasi-government institutions and agencies? And why do those in power leaders and their administrators blatantly and openly break the very laws they have enacted, and then, get away with murder themselves? 

 Circa 2007 and India, a strong culture and modern nation, is looking confused, intellectually backward and ideologically stuck in a time warp. It seems unwilling to open its mind and soul to the creative energy of a changing world. The Congress appears to have broken out of the historical barrier that had, over many decades, repressed the vitality and entrepreneurship of Indians. The future again looks positive. The young seem enthused. But suddenly it all goes awry and the happy dance turns into a slow march. A limited leadership, with a few exceptions, unable to think ahead of its people, compels this nation to wallow in the mire of failed politics and irrelevant administrative norms and procedures of the past, which are a living reality that has been overtaken by enormous change. The change has not been addressed, which is why there is social turmoil. 

 Empty rhetoric

 In this age of information, the rhetoric of the Prakash Karats is inconsequential except for the fact that it shows up the worst part of the Indian political space. To assume that India has no self-confidence, that it has no intellectual wherewithal, that the minds of our negotiators are sub-standard, is unacceptable to Indians. Heaven knows which constituency supports the backward march that some of those in the Opposition are demanding. To control the minds and souls, lives and thoughts, entrepreneurship and innovation of the people in this subcontinent is nothing short of criminal. It verges on being inhuman. This is the attitude that paved the way for India to be ruled by a colonial power the size of a small state of India, till Gandhiji extricated the vast numbers of citizens out of their insecurity and gave them dignity and purpose.

 Over the decades after independence, and particularly after the Emergency, a watershed period for India, our leadership ceased to operate within the parameters of legitimacy and, in some ways, endorsed corruption, making the abuse of law and bribery legitimate. That is when the horror of indecent and lawless practice became the accepted norm of operation. Men and women in the political space, aided and abetted by bureaucrats, allowed the degradation of the ethics and morality of India. They are responsible for the dilution of what would have emerged as a regional power to contend with. However, despite the corrosion, India has emerged out of the horror. It has pulled its head out of the noose and broken loose from the stranglehold of the petty self-serving representatives of the larger authority, a band that has a consistent track record of holding India back.

 If a nations administrative machinery cannot execute the law of the land and readily succumbs to the arbitrary diktats of extra-constitutional power centres and much else, allowing for kidnappings and illegalities of the black market, social anarchy is bound to replace civil society. The blame can be put nowhere else and the parochial positions that we take on issues of international importance stem from wanting to keep the lid on this Pandoras Box, lest a grand exposure sweep the muck away.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 NEVER SCORN A WOMAN 

 Malvika Singh

 MALAFIDE

 And she won with a margin larger 

 than was expected. The analysts went into a scramble and 

 found all kinds of reasons to explain why this had happened. 

 Some came up with the strange claim that the smaller parties 

 did not want to alienate the Left since the next general 

 election are looming large and the Left may well be required 

 as a crutch to form a coalition. The great electronic media, 

 which had tirelessly lobbied for hours against Pratibha 

 Patil, had to resort to sarcasm and snide references to 

 the president of India being a rubber stamp, a Gandhi 

 family loyalist. Soon the same lot will do a turn-around 

 and will be fawning over Patil. 

 In India, this kind of abrasive 

 personal assault does not seem to work at all, particularly 

 when aimed at women. When the Sushma Swaraj brigade abused 

 and demeaned Sonia Gandhi and her family, anonymous India 

 was appalled. After all, Sonia was the legitimate bahu 

 of Indira Gandhi and belonged to a family of repute. 

 It was therefore unacceptable that she be treated in this 

 base manner. On the other side of the coin, the social butterflies, 

 defined today as the Page 3 wallahs, were charmed 

 by the viciousness of the attack. It gave them something 

 to gossip about as they flitted from party to party. They 

 were contented to remain the vacuous victims of the political 

 propaganda that the television channels were spreading merrily. 

 However, in the end, it is anonymous India that calls the 

 shots. Bharat tends to reject the rabble that is roused 

 by desperate politicians. 

 The venomous attack on Jayalalithaa, 

 launched by those who opposed her and intended to cut her 

 to size, achieved exactly the opposite effect. Straightforward 

 citizens, who lead normal lives, are disgusted with the 

 impropriety of language used by politicians when they are 

 out to discredit their colleagues. It is rhetoric of this 

 kind that has reduced public discourse to an all-time low 

 and has polluted the environment. Every woman who has been 

 demeaned in public has won the battle. There is a lesson 

 to be learned from this.

 Golden age

 The real tragedy is that all those 

 who scream with vehemence about the corruption of others, 

 have misdemeanours clinging to their persons as well. That 

 is one reason for not taking personal assaults seriously. 

 Intellectual disagreements, debates on ideas, issues and 

 ideological differences allow for growth, which this political 

 blackmail cannot result in. Sadly, coalition politics has 

 become a number game. In the constant struggle to remain 

 in power, governments succumb to all kinds of political 

 and economic blackmail at the cost of the nation and its 

 development. India is in transition and, hopefully, the 

 worst of this kind of politics will soon begin to fade and 

 give way to a renewal of faith and justice. 

 The Bharatiya Janata Party needs 

 to spend all its time regrouping and restructuring itself 

 to face the next general election. A party that professed 

 to be disciplined in contrast to the amorphous and loosely 

 organized Congress, is today all over the place. Earlier 

 hairline fractures on its body are growing in size to disable 

 it. Urgent plasters are required if the party is to play 

 an active role in the forthcoming general election. Instead 

 of going for the jugular of all and sundry, the party leadership 

 should do some serious closed-door thinking and revamp itself. 

 As a leading editor said to me the other day the Manmohan 

 Singh/Sonia Gandhi tenure will be seen as the golden age 

 of India,what with no communal upheavals, an all-time high 

 rate of growth, a vibrant market, a nuclear pact with the 

 United States of America on acceptable terms, a peace process 

 in motion with Pakistan, a Right to Information Act in place 

 and much else. And, Mayavati too has become a force to reckon 

 with.

 Landed in trouble

Exceptions to the rule

 Sir The immunity given to Mayavati from the investigations of the Central Bureau of Investigation by the governor of Uttar Pradesh, T.V. Rajeswar, in the Taj corridor scandal seems to have been influenced by political pressure from the Centre (Governor grants Mayavati immunity, June 6). However, what is shocking to note is that the governor had the audacity to override the Supreme Courts directive to the CBI to begin fresh probes into the case. This incident proves yet again that in India, corruption can be easily swept under the carpet if the corrupt knows the right people in power. 

 Yours faithfully,

J.N. Mahanty, Puri

 Sir The chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Mayavati, has been exonerated of the Taj corridor case by T.V. Rajeswar, the governor who recently denied sanction to the CBI to proceed with the enquiries. The governor has exercised the power vested in his office without proper reasoning or analysis of the facts. In the process, he has also ignored not only the prima facie evidence produced by the CBI but also the apex courts order that directed the agency to conduct further investigations into the alleged improprieties. The law of the land does not discriminate against citizens. For the greater good of the society, a governor should be prevented from using his offices to protect erring politicians . 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir T.V. Rajeswars decision to bail out Mayavati from the CBI net can only be described as preposterous. The governor granted immunity to Mayavati from a CBI enquiry, thereby defying a Supreme Court directive. This is a glaring misuse of the constitutional privileges enjoyed by a governor. Significantly, the accused, Mayavati, declared her intention to go to Delhi to announce her partys preference for the Congresss presidential candidate only after hearing the governors decision. It seems as if she was waiting for the Centre to pull her out of the murky waters so that she could return the favour.

 Yours faithfully,

B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore 

 Landlocked

 Sir The uproar over the purchase of farmland by Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan raises an important question: why should farmers be entitled to exclusive possession of arable land while non-farmers are prevented from being legal occupants of such stretches (Now we know, Amitabh is not a farmer, June 2)? Is there anything inherently wrong if non- farmers get interested in farming and wish to buy land for agriculture? Further, such a ban might turn out to be detrimental to the farmers themselves. For instance, if a farmer wants to sell off his land to meet a financial crisis, he would have fewer buyers, which in effect, would reduce the market price of his territory. Who are we helping in the name of protecting farmers? Restricting the right to buy and sell land and advocating exclusive possession of it go against modern democratic notions of ownership and rights. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir To grab the agricultural land at Barabanki and in Pune, Amitabh Bachchan claimed to be a farmer by producing a certificate. But the Faizabad court declared that the certificate which identified Bachchan as a farmer was forged. It seems that Bachchan has only done what corrupt political leaders have been doing for many years. And it is not as if Bachchan is the first celebrity to have succumbed to the allure of wealth. Sachin Tendulkar and Sunil Gavaskar, two of our most revered national icons, have been pulled up for tax evasion as well. This only goes to show that corruption and favouritism exist everywhere, even among celebrities. It would be heartening if the justice system in India were to punish celebrities for improper conduct more frequently. But, in India, there are two sets of laws one for the ordinary citizen and another for the superstars.

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Sir Amitabh Bachchan has been unnecessarily dragged into the farmer and land controversy. It has not yet been proved that the superstar benefited from the patronage of the erstwhile government in Uttar Pradesh, which was led by his friends, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh. Hence, it would not be correct to accuse Bachchan of irregularities at the drop of a hat. 

 It has been revealed recently that Bachchan has been regularly filing his tax returns, and his family has contributed the highest amount for the financial year that ended in March, 2007. The allegations against Bachchan need to be investigated by both the UP and the Maharashtra governments to find out whether this screen idol is guilty or not. If he is innocent, one has to conclude that Bachchan is merely a victim of negative publicity.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Nalco Nagar, Orissa

 EC TO RESCUE

 In a democracy, there is no better antidote to rumours and speculation than elections. The announcement by the Election Commission that polls to the Uttar Pradesh Bidhan Sabha would begin on April 7 ended all controversy about the incumbent government. It also ended all speculation about whether the United Progressive Alliance government would use Article 356 of the Constitution to dismiss the present government in UP. The electorate of UP can now cast their verdict on Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav and his government. At the same time, the leadership of the Congress has been saved from taking a decision that was fraught with risk and imponderables. But the relief in the Congress camp cannot be complete, since the state-level leadership of the party has maintained for some time that free and fair elections in UP are not possible under Mr Yadavs government. The Bharatiya Janata Party, by announcing that it would support the imposition of presidents rule in UP, also expressed the same fear. The Congress made the further claim that Mr Yadav had lost all moral right to rule after 13 defectors from the Bahujan Samaj Party had been disqualified from the assembly by the Supreme Court.

 In India, political developments in UP invariably cast their long shadow on national politics. This time, too, events in Lucknow had immediate reverberations in New Delhi. The Samajwadi Party withdrew its support from the UPA government. The Communist Party of India (Marxist), always a trifle cosy with Mr Yadav, warned the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, of the consequences that would follow from an imposition of presidents rule in UP. The exact nature of the consequences was never quite spelt out, but the underlying threat was withdrawal of support. There is no denying that the Samajwadi Partys decision to withdraw support had made the survival of the UPA government utterly dependent on the CPI(M) and the left. Thus those among the Congress leaders who were in favour of the use of Article 356 were pushed into a corner. The survival of the UPA government was too high a price to pay for presidents rule in UP, and free and fair elections there. There was also the view, backed by political arithmetic, that even under presidents rule, the Congress would not be making substantial gains to its current tally of seats. The ECs announcement has ended political adventurism.

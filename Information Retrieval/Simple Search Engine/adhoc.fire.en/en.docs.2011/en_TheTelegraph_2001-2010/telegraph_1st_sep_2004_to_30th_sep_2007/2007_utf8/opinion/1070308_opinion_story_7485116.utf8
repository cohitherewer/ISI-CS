 BEYOND THE NET

 What does it mean for India to have the worlds highest growth in internet use? Does this mean that the country is getting richer, more literate or more globalized? Such statistics work best when put roundly in place. There has been a 33 per cent rise in Indian internet-users over the past year. But still only 2 per cent of the countrys population of more than a billion use the internet, and they account for only 3 per cent of the worlds users. The United States of America still has the largest number of users, although its rate of growth is the lowest. Hence the net-user base is still very small in India, and concepts like e-governance or blogging, and even something as old-hat as email all more-or-less household words in urban Middle India are still relatively unfamiliar and unreachable in, say, rural Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, or a village a few hundred miles away from Cyberabad. Competing with India in this rate of growth are China and Russia, and what kind of ferment does this indicate politically for these nations? 

 If, for India, taking increasingly to the internet is evidence of how naturally democratic ordinary Indians tend to be, then the internet, for a nation like China, becomes a threatening tool for democratization against all sorts of odds embodied by its political establishment. Chinas confrontation with Google, and the resulting compromise that the latter had to make, are the best example of this. Yet, for India too, the indomitable and largely uncontrollable openness of the internet has often proved discomfiting for the State. Everything from paedophilia to terrorism has been seen as being dangerously facilitated by the internet, justifying knee-jerk interventions by the State. This has, in turn, mobilized ordinary Indians to assert themselves as netizens and affirm their rights to certain essential freedoms and transparencies. The challenge is to understand and go along with the revolutionary political and cultural potentials of the net, without getting too dazzled into forgetting the basic problems of education, nutrition and health, of poverty and corruption, that the net cannot solve miraculously. The cyberworld, together with its entire technical and economic infrastructure, is ultimately made and used by people, the questions of whose survival are still anything but virtual.

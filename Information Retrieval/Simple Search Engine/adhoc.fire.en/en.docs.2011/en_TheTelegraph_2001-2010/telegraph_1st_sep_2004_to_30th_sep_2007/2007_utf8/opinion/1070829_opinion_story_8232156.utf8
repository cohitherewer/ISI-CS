 Letters to Editor

 For your eyes only

 Eyes spy

 Sir Passing fatwas or diktats on womens dressing is yet another attempt to restrict womens freedom of choice (Jeans for boys, seminary tells women students, Aug 18 and All in the jeans, Aug 19). The recent fatwa prohibiting women from wearing jeans has naturally caused much resentment. It is clear proof that religion is being used to intimidate and harass them. But why should others decide for women what they are to wear? The imposition of a dress code for women seems all the more outrageous since there is no corresponding set of rules for men. The outrage against the fatwa issued by the Darul Uloom is, in fact, a welcome relief. It indicates that Muslim women are refusing to have their lives controlled by either religious bodies or society, both of which are patriarchal. 

 Yours faithfully,

Amit Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir After the furore over Sania Mirzas skirt, the Darul Uloom has turned its attention to jeans-clad women. The editorial, All in the jeans, points out the amusing illogic in the seminarys argument. If jeans-clad women resemble men, how can they invite undesirable male attention? If women are attracting men by looking like them, then the seminary has to contend with a problem akin to the one that troubled Sodom and Gomorrah rather than one of female decency.

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

 Sir If women cannot wear mens clothing then why should men be allowed to copy womens dress style? Men today pierce their ears, sport long hair and sometimes wear make-up. And if the Darul Uloom believes that dressing modestly is going to protect women from undue advances from men, the seminary should be told that even women in burqa get molested. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sonia Ghosh, Guwahati

 Sir It is the character and morals of a man that decide how he perceives a woman. Her dress has hardly much to do in this perception. Instead of issuing fatwas, religious leaders should encourage men to have a healthy mindset. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jay, Dallas, US

 Women of substance

 Sir Ashok Mitra should be thanked for reminding us of the political era that was graced by the charms of Tarakeshwari Sinha (All spirit and grace, Aug 20). The combination of brain and beauty rare among human beings and rarer among politicians gave Sinha an exceptional stature. Mitra recollects an incident involving Sinha and E.M.S. Namboodiripad that showed her kindness towards an elderly politician. I remember an anecdote from the Fifties about Sinha and M.O. Mathai, then special assistant to the prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Although Mathai was an influential person, Sinha reportedly did not think twice before threatening to slap him when she was offended by some remark he had made. 

 One is reminded of another remarkable political figure, the former Union minister and chief minister of Orissa, Nandini Satpathy. Like Sinha, Satpathy had the rare distinction of being a politician-poet. The daughter of the Padmabhushan-winner Oriya author, Kalindi Charan Panigrahi, Satpathy was well-versed in Oriya and Bengali literature. Both Sinha and Satpathy were charismatic public figures. It is unfortunate that the media devoted so little space to announce the death of these two ladies who once dominated the political scene in their own different ways.

 Yours faithfully,

Buddha Deb Chattopadhyay, Kulti 

 Sir While talking about Tarakeshwari Sinha, Ashok Mitra rightly points out that an emancipated woman need not discard either feminine grace or domesticity. Many of the so-called liberated women of today, who believe that they can display their class and education only by being brazen, will find it hard to accept this fact. Most of these women perhaps have never heard of women like Tarakeshwari Sinha. They might begin by reading Mitras delightful article.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta 

 Sir The problem with Marxists is that they have very few things to discuss. But since it is impossible to remain silent altogether, they must talk, even if it is on irrelevant themes. Ashok Mitras article on Tarakeshwari Sinha belongs to this category. Sinha died a few days ago and deserves an obituary. But the way Mitra goes overboard in praising her makes one suspect that he is trying to fill up space. However extraordinary a person Sinha might have been, the phrase, ethereally lovely human being sounds ridiculous.

 Yours faithfully,

Ravindra Kumar, Calcutta

 BULGING PURSES

 The government of India cannot be faulted on its sense of timing. It has authorized public sector undertakings to park 30 per cent of their cash in mutual funds, just as the sensitive index breaks all past records and breaches 15,000. PSUs can now invest their enormous reserves at the peak of the market and hope the market will not crash soon after. If it does, the PSUs will be able to blame mutual funds direct investment is taboo. But there will be questions in parliaments, ministerial heads will be shaken, and if the crash is big enough, the 30 per cent freedom will be withdrawn. 

 But how did the government get to the magic figure of 30 per cent in the first place? No doubt there were doubting Thomases in the ministries, good old socialists who thought that it was immoral for government companies to invest in capitalist enterprises. And there were perhaps some lone voices arguing for greater freedom for PSUs, and for fair play between them and their private competitors. The former would have been for zero, while the latter would have argued for 50 per cent. An average of 25 per cent would have been too much of a compromise; to signal a victory for the liberals and reformers, it was raised to 30 per cent. It is as devoid of reason as 21 or 73 or any other figure. The question to decide was whether treasury management should be left to the companies themselves or not. And the rational answer would have been that if PSUs were grown-up enough to manage themselves, they could manage their treasuries as well. What the government needs to decide is whether to give PSUs autonomy; a decision about freedom of investment would follow directly from it. 

 It is very unlikely that the present government would decide in favour of PSU autonomy, for in its economic policies it is indistinguishable from an old-style, pre-reform Congress government. But if the prime minister were to remember his distinguished liberal past and decide to grant freedom to PSUs, he would have to contend with the ministries. For parent ministries and PSU autonomy are a contradiction in terms. What would all those ministers, secretaries and deputy subordinate division clerks in parent ministries do if PSUs were allowed to manage themselves? The basic decision the prime minister needs to take is to abolish parent ministries, and to transfer the governments shares in PSUs to a professional investment institution. The decision required is not whether to let PSUs invest in mutual funds, but whether the government should be their jealous mother or a rational fund manager of its investment in them. There can be no doubt about what is in the nations interest: its assets should be managed by professionals committed to maximizing overall returns, not by ministers worrying about why BSNL did not give an order to Motorola.

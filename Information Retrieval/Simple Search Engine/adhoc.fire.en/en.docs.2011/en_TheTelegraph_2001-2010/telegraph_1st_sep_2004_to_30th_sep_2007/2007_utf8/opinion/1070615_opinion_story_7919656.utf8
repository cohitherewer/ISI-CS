 Wombats and poor women

 Banker to the Poor (Penguin, Rs 395) by Muhammad Yunus is the autobiography of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize winner, written in collaboration with Alan Jolis. It is a book that combines stories of the Grameen Bank founders life with his socio-economic philosophies. In the chapter titled, Why lend to Women rather than to Men?, Yunus recalls his disappointment when he found that traditional banks in Bangladesh would always ask prospective female borrowers if they had discussed the loan with their husbands, but would never ask men if they had consulted their wives over a loan. This sensitivity sets the tone for the book. Yunuss warning about the development model is to be heeded: In the world of development, if one mixes the poor with the non-poor within a programme, the non-poor will drive out the poor, and the less poor will drive out the more poor, and this may continue ad infinitum unless one takes protective measures right at the beginning.

 Natures Spokesman: M. Krishnan And Indian Wildlife (Penguin, Rs 395) edited by Ramachandra Guha collects most of the essays written by this natural historian par excellence also one of the two Tamil Brahmins known to Guha who did not have security as his watch word. The essays are thematically organized under categories such as Natures miniatures and Natures marvels though Guha finds that the polymathic Krishnan resists being sorted anyhow. Krishnans scholarship obviously straddles the worlds of flora and fauna, but also extends to history (Asokas lions), language and literature (On Shikar English), Hindu mythology (Ancient depictions of Hanuman) and so much else. The most delightful bits in the book are from the animal alphabet Krishnan made for his granddaughter.

 Chitrangada And Other Dramatic Poems (Rupa, Rs 195) by Rabindranath Tagore has been translated, rather limply, by Shailesh Parekh, and one says this with the knowledge that Tagore himself was not the greatest translator of his poems. Chitrangada ends with Dear, I am fulfilled which will send shudders through the lovers and haters of Tagorean verse-plays alike. Parekh admits, however, that some lines, with exceptional rhythm such as abalaar bal, nirastrer astra jata are impossible to translate. Viday Abhishap, Gandharir Avedan and Karna-Kunti Samvad are the other poems translated here.

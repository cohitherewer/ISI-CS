 ENDLESS GAME

 Violence as political strategy is seldom sustainable. That may be one of the reasons the Gujjars abruptly withdrew their agitation in Rajasthan, after a promise by the chief minister, Vasundhara Raje, that would fail to persuade even a child. Ms Raje has promised to set up a committee that would look into the Gujjars demand for a transfer of status from other backward classes to scheduled tribes. It would submit its findings to the Centre after three months. Given the intensity of the Gujjar demand, this is but the shadow of a carrot. The committee might find no grounds for a transfer. The irony is that the deadly violence on the first day of the Gujjar protest was exacerbated by police action, a fact that gives Gujjar paranoia some substance, since the Meenas, their rivals in the reservations race, are well-established in the police force. And once the Meenas entered the battlefield, it was mayhem. It was not just that the roads became impassable or that the railways and postal services were disrupted almost throughout the country. This was a part of the protest. But the Gujjars too began to feel the heat of their own passion. As if deaths and destruction of property were not enough, food supplies to Gujjar areas encircled by Meena habitations were beginning to thin out.

 It is good that the Gujjar leadership has responded positively to the governments peace-offering. Bloodshed and disruption are not desirable things. But the entire episode has laid bare the eagerness with which politicians keep taking the country back in time, reviving casteism as the only net with which to gather votes. They are bankrupt of all ideas but this. The Meenas certainly appear to have the government in their grip. The pressure that 31 Meena members of the legislative assembly can exert when they threaten to resign if the state even thinks of giving the Gujjars ST category demonstrates exactly how much political power rides on belonging exclusively to the ST club. The promised committee, should it be well-intentioned, is in for a difficult time. The Bharatiya Janata Party would baulk at fiddling about with equations before the next elections, and the Congress at the Centre would rather that the BJP handled this particular hot potato. But whatever happens, there is no winner in this game, for it can never be well played.

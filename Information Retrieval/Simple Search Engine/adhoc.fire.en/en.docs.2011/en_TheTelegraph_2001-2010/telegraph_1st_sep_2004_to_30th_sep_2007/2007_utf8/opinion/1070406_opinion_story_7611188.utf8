 COACH STOP

 Greg Chappell has not only resigned from his job as the coach of the Indian cricket team, he is also resigned to his fate. It took him nearly two years to realize that Indian cricket is not really about cricket and cricketers. It is more about politics and politicians; it is about money coming from sponsorships and endorsements; it is about players who are seen and see themselves as icons. Chappell perhaps came to the Indian cricket scene under the illusion that he would be allowed to teach players to play cricket. He leaves a disappointed and frustrated man. During his tenure as coach, he came in for more criticism than he deserved. He was seen as someone who was engaging in too many experiments that often involved the neglect of old players. What Chappell attempted to do was very simple. He wanted to increase the pool of available talent. In other words, he wanted a situation where the Indian team would be selected not from 20 or 25 players but from 40 or 50 players. For this to happen, young players had to be given more opportunities at the international level. To do this, Chappell often appeared to act against the older players who did not take kindly to this. Neither did their patrons within the Board of Control for Cricket in India, and their fans. The criticism mounted, and the reversals in the World Cup sealed Chappells fate. If he had not resigned, chances are that he would not have been given a new contract. He chose resignation over ignominy.

 The controversy over Chappells role as a coach has deflected attention from certain important facts. Chappell was only trying to set the pace for a tendency that was already visible. In the past, Indian cricketers came from Bombay, Hyderabad, Madras, Bangalore and Delhi. Now the catchment area has broadened: there are players from Jharkhand, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh and so on. Players from different states were jostling for place in the national side. Chappell wanted to give them a chance since this was the only way to build a team for the future. Hand in hand with his preference for youth came the emphasis on fitness and fielding. The latter two were not the strong points of the older players, with the exception of Rahul Dravid. Chappell was looking ahead. Unfortunately, that is not the direction in which the BCCI wants to look. It prefers to remain in the whirlpool of politics and factionalism. Chappells exit is Indian crickets loss.

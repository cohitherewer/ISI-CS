 Dirty politicking

Personal is political

 Sir But for the 24-hour notice issued by the Delhi high court on September 3, the Union health minister, Anbumani Ramadoss, would not have signed the certificates of the students whose degrees from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences have been due for two years now (Minister told to sign on AIIMS line, Sept 4). He is surely the first Union minister who has had to be directed by the court to fall in line over such a trivial issue. The history of his personal grouse against the director of the institute, P. Venugopal, is well known. He has been opposing each and every move of Venugopal ever since he assumed office in the health ministry. The worst sufferers of Ramadosss bloated ego are the young doctors who cannot start practice because they still have not got the documentary proof of their qualification. Ramadoss should be divested of the health portfolio immediately. He has vitiated the environment of one of the premier medical institutes of the country with his petty, personal agenda. It is common knowledge how he sacked Venugopal as director last year, The Delhi high court promptly reinstated Venugopal, frustrating the ministers game plan. Centres of excellence like the AIIMS can work smoothly only if they are insulated from political and bureaucratic interference. The AIIMS could certainly do without Ramadosss help.

 Yours faithfully,

K.S. Jayatheertha, Bangalore

 Sir It is a matter of shame that a reputed institution such as the AIIMS is going to the dogs because of an ego-war between the director of the institute and the Union health minister. The recent high court order directing Anbumani Ramadoss to sign all certificates within 24 hours proves that the health minister had not signed them to make things difficult for the AIIMS director, P. Venugopal. Why must the patients some of them have come to the AIIMS with critical illnesses from remote places suffer because Ramadoss and Venugopal cannot see eye to eye? If a similar impasse had taken place in a private organization, marching orders would immediately have been issued and the matter would have ended there. It is unfortunate that the health minister should be responsible for the sickness of an institution.

 Yours faithfully,

B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore 

 Sir Ministers and politicians are elected to formulate policies and not to interfere in the day-to-day administration of establishments. But Anbumani Ramadoss has strayed from this path from day one of his starting work in the health ministry. After much bad blood, he has finally been asked to sign the pending AIIMS degrees within 24 hours. Thankfully, he has largely complied with the court order. 

 Yours faithfully,

M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh

 Sir For the last two years as a minister and the president of the leading medical institute of the country, namely AIIMS, Anbumani Ramadoss has let his indifferent and irrational attitude tarnish the image of the institution. His sacking of P. Venugopal led to strikes by the doctors. Several critically ill patients died for want of treatment. He tried to create further problems by not issuing degrees to those doctors who passed their final exams two years ago. But one has to give credit to the Delhi high court for intervening earlier to reinstate Venugopal and now to instruct Ramadoss to sign the degrees of the doctors within 24 hours. But even after the order, Ramadoss has tried to make things difficult by signing the certificates of only 49 doctors. It shows that Ramadoss has no respect for the court of law. Ministers like him are a liability to the government and also to the nation. The prime minister should not tolerate such insolence and expel Ramadoss from the cabinet, to allow AIIMS to function smoothly and without political meddling. 

 Yours faithfully.

 Race against time

 Sir As so lucidly presented by Rohini Chaki, the state of horse racing in Calcutta requires a thorough overhaul (The favourite didnt win Sept. 4). It is a dying sport, and needs an infusion of young blood, both in administration and among the spectators.

 It was disturbing to read that a senior steward declined to provide information on the Royal Calcutta Turf Clubs future plans. For unlike the other society clubs, the RCTC is not an exclusive domain of club members. It is a public place, where thousands of non-members gather, and enormous sums of money are wagered each race day. The government earns substantial revenue by way of taxes from betting on race days. The public has a right to information and those at the helm of the RCTC will have to be transparent, accountable and willing to protect their integrity and credibility. The larger public interest warrants the disclosure of all relevant information concerning the club. The RCTC is nobodys private fiefdom.

 Yours faithfully,

Gautam Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir Horse racing in Calcutta is down in the pits, almost in a state of somnolence. It would require a herculean effort to bring the RCTC on a par with the countrys top racing centres. Going to the races must be made a family occasion, and not an opportunity for men to gamble. The club must provide better eateries, cleaner toilets, and a place for children to play. No attention has been paid for long to the state of the galleries. The bookmakers ring turns into a dirty waterlogged pool after the mildest of showers. Even clean drinking water is not available. How long will racegoers suffer in silence ? It is high time that the RCTC got its act together.

 Yours faithfully,

Probir Ghosh, Calcutta

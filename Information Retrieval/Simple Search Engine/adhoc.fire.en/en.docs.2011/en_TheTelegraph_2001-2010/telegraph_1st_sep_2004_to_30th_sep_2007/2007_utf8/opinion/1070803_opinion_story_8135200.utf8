 DEATH OF A DREAM

 Malvika Singh

 On August 15, modern India will be sixty years old, but, alas, without the basic infrastructure required for dignified living in rural, urban or metropolitan India. It is a shame to see how a dream got entangled in greed, corruption, mismanagement and faulty governance. The ineptitude and mediocrity of the ruling class forced the ruination of what could have been an extraordinary and successful experiment in bridging the gap between the less privileged and the affluent sections. 

 Our nation could have been a world leader at many levels; in generating ideas, in devising new methodologies, in skills that could be used to stop environmental degradation, in devising a politics of consensus, drawing together the multicultural strands that are indigenous to this land and so on. All this could have been possible if only our rulers were impassioned and committed to honest nation-building and were excited by the challenge that the tryst brought in its wake.

 At a time when the colonial rules could have been rewritten to facilitate the creation of a truly democratic and free nation, our leaders chose to rule us in the manner and form of the colonists. Over the decades that followed, this is what degraded the polity as a whole. It forced people to look for a way out of the web of draconian laws, rules and regulations. At the time of Independence, men and women entrepreneurs, who had been repressed and defeated all this, while wanted to break free from the knots of the colonial laws that had held them down, only to find that the brown sahib wielded the same baton.

 New tryst

 As Asia shed its archaic past and the pieces that had held it back from competing with the West, it tried to develop a fresh and energetic attitude towards change and inclusive growth. We in India, on the other hand, found ourselves being ruled by closed minds that were unwilling to break new ground. 

 Development took place despite the execution of redundant government policies. Because progress was achieved within outdated and obsolete parameters that were out of step with the demands for change and growth, people were tempted to break the rules. They devised ingenious ways to protect themselves from the machinations of a government that thrived on bribery. 

 Life moved on and the nation advanced, but in a perverse manner. We rapidly lost our place and position on the international stage. India found itself relegated to the third, if not the fourth, world. Intellectual lethargy laced with corruption in the institutions demoralized the countrymen. Therefore, the slide downward was fast and easy.

 In the last couple of years, India has managed to come up on the world-stage once again. The West sees a great market potential for its goods and services in this country. As a result, the markets in India have begun to boom. Our rate of growth, whatever that is supposed to mean, has shot up. Social anarchy is fast becoming the order of the day. The parallel lines do not seem to converge at any point. And there appears to be no attempt at coming to grips with this problem using a series of creative solutions and alternatives. We seem pleased with superficial success and are slothful when it comes to dealing with real and difficult issues that confront the country today. 

 The tryst has become an intangible dream, and there is no solid bridge in place to assist the happy transit between Bharat and India. There is now an unnatural economic and social divide between the privileged and those who have been been forgotten, a segregation as absurd as the line the British drew to divide the subcontinent, thereby destroying a fine and tolerant ancient culture. It is time for renewal and for restoration. It is time for a new tryst with Bharat.

 There are two sets of discourses about rural India. One that speaks of mechanization, industrialization, special economic zones and development, and the other that speaks of displacement, exclusion, inequity and impoverishment. Both the discourses and the processes they address are linked. The questions are: what is the social impact of such changes, especially in the rural sector? Who is being affected and how? And what is to be done? Neither the issues nor the questions are new. But the misery of people, especially the most affected, are worth a rethink. 

 Political and social groups have conducted several social audits to examine these issues in recent weeks, and a picture has emerged. First of all, the nature of poverty itself is undergoing change. While people in the rural areas were always poor, they still remained linked to the rural economy. They had some livelihood, whether linked to the land or the community. There was continuity in their tradition. But now, their very mode of survival is being destroyed. 

 The second issue is that women, especially, feel that they are being denied dignity with these changes. As Durga Devi of Rajasthan and Sarojini of Sitapur said at a jan adalat (peoples court) of women organized by one womens organization, We have no choice, we are being driven out of our lands, no one listens to us; if we protest we face violence. Other women from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab said, We are told that we can become servants in the houses of the new managers of Tata and Reliance when they come here. But this is not what we want.

 Thirdly, those who were already unequal are the first to be hurt. This means certain depressed communities, minority groups and women. Munni Begum, a bidi-maker from UP, said that the women get only Rs 40 for 1,000 bidis, which take about four days to make; all along, they have their domestic chores to do as well. The middlemen, of course, take all the cuts. Thus, what they get is a pittance of even minimum wages. But who will ensure that these women, who have become home-based workers in the flexible private-sector economy, get their due?

 The fourth issue is that of the structural violence linked with development and displacement. Women in all these areas are speaking of the multiple layers of violence they face. In addition to domestic and caste violence, or the violence faced when they make their own choices such as on marriage or childbirth, another silent violence is being inflicted in addition to those that already exist. This is the violence when communities break up violence from the police who enforce displacement, from employers who want more, from builders when the victims shacks are destroyed, and, most of all, the violence when they resist. 

 As one woman from Gujarat, who had been raped by her employer, stated, Should we bare our bodies like the women in Manipur did to bring notice to our plight and get justice? Violence against women, as feminists have repeatedly shown, is played out on their bodies; it is intended to shame the community, leave a permanent mark, and destroy dignity and honour. 

 Even semi-skilled and skilled labourers are getting little respite, despite arguments about their needs or the short supply of labour. Rajvanti, a nurse and a leader of her local nursing union, argued that with privatization they had longer hours of work and lower wages. Similarly, women who work in the coal mines in Durgapur and elsewhere spoke of the severe exploitation lack of sanitation, public toilets and child care as private contractors take more and give less. 

 Surely, these stories appear repetitive. But should generation after generation of our people live in sub-human conditions, because we know this is how industrialization and development happen and a nation becomes powerful? Or because the GDP makes us proud? Or because globalization is inevitable? 

 It is true that the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act attempts to address rural unemployment. But, as Tejgi, Hatiram and others said, We are getting employment from this for only 10-15 days a month. It is erratic. How do we feed our families the rest of the time? 

 A survey by a team of the Central Employment Guarantee Council and NREGA Watch found some positive aspects in states like Tamil Nadu and others where work was being given under the act. But the flaws were equally large in that there was poor awareness, employment was rationed to the workers, while the largest numbers who sought work were women whose workplaces did not have basic facilities for them, such as childcare. Besides, there was low productivity at these sites. In other words, there was little or no transparency or safeguards being used, as envisaged in the act.

 Clearly, acts like the NREGA and the other schemes that the government dishes out occasionally need to be improved a lot. There has to be a process of continuous audit of the schemes by the people who are to be beneficiaries (and are thus the main stakeholders). They alone can ensure that corruption does not occur, rather than those who implement the schemes and benefit from corruption. Besides, these schemes are not enough in themselves. They ensure less than the basic survival needs. There has to be more. The rural economies and the people attached to them cannot be destroyed for the sake of either industrialization and development. A cost-benefit analysis of these forms of development has been done by social groups and this should be seriously considered. 

 This cost-benefit cannot be just in terms of cost and profits, but must also include social costs and impacts. The Indian government has conceded that 20 million people have been displaced because of development; but others say that this is an underestimated figure. Yet, there is no national rehabilitation policy in place. The SEZs are displacing more and more people and it is estimated that another 10 lakh people will be removed from their lands with the 500 SEZs that are being planned. 

 The Land Acquisition Act, under which this is being done, was made in 1864 during colonial times, when the population was far less and land far more easily available. 

 Now, what happens to those displaced who come to towns for jobs they cannot get? It is well known that, besides the terrible personal costs they bear, these dispossessed are prone to become the base of either revolutionary or counter-revolutionary groups; they can also be lured into crime. Why else is one-third of the total districts of India under Naxalite influence by official account? Why else are there regular harassment and massacres of Bihari labourers in Assam or Maharashtra? Why do women have less value than their male counterparts, despite all the legislation and affirmative action? The profit gained from development of this kind is lost in social distress, internal insecurity and militancy. 

 Further, will such hunger for land not be followed by food insecurity? There is also the question of the impact on the environment of concrete and mines that replace fields and trees, of artificial dams in place of rivers and riverbeds. These issues may be merely a part of the reality, but they do form an important part of that reality. 

 Thus, in looking at development, it may be worthwhile to see the other side too that of people who are silent but not without ideas, who remain uneducated but are politically literate. It may be worth looking at the social audits that are not part of the official discourse. Or at the lot that is poor but increasingly aware of its citizenship rights. In the 21st century, state sovereignty should be linked to the responsibility to protect. And who needs more protection than those who were once termed the wretched of the earth?

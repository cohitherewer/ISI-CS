 To help men fight Shaitan

 LOOKING FOR THE BIG B: BOLLYWOOD, BACHCHAN AND ME (Bloomsbury, Rs 395) by Jessica Hines is an account of the authors adventures (English, almost thirty, and not in the least bit famous) while researching a book that would explode the myths surrounding Indias most famous man. But things arent simple at all. Hines is overwhelmed by the mayhem in Bombay, finds Bollywood maddening and the Big B reticent. You have known me for seven years, he tells her with deadpan humour, My life has changed seven times. You will never finish this book. And she doesnt quite finish the book she had planned. The final product is a bizarre assortment of autobiography, travelogue, social commentary and interviews, informed by the curiosity of a writer-on-the-prowl, as also by the seriousness of a researcher familiar with the vast literature on the Big B. The result is a near-parody of academic works on the Bachchan phenomenon: dazzling humour and footnotes are held together beautifully by her bristling wit, charm and intelligence. 

DISAPPEARING DAUGHTERS: THE TRAGEDY OF FEMALE FOETICIDE (Penguin, Rs 250) by Gita Aravamudan comes with a glowing recommendation by APJ Abdul Kalam, nuclear-scientist-turned-President of India, whose contribution is his version of the Genesis. God creates Woman to elevate Man to higher levels that are angelic and help him fight Shaitan. After this mumbo-jumbo comes Aravamudans solidly researched work, combining investigative journalism with extensive case studies. She has a flair for story-telling, while being aware of facts, statistics, and oral history. Apart from the social and legal debates on abortion, the individual narratives give her work an edge over those produced by idealist activism and social theorists. The outcome is a superior work of ethnography and cultural history.

 ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IN INDIA: A READER (Pearson, Rs 199) edited by Mahesh Rangarajan collects essays by leading academics, journalists and activists. The scope of this book is more than social awareness. The first three sections look at environmental challenges in pre-colonial, colonial and independent India. Though largely historical, this bit is fascinating in the way it chronicles Indias transformation from an agrarian to a globalized society. The final two sections focus on Movements and Alternatives and Global Issues, both of which situate India within a context of international environmental activism.

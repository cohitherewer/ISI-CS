 WRITTEN IN BLOOD

 Identity and survival: Sikh militancy 

 in India (1978-1993) By Kirpal Dhillon, 

 Penguin, 

 Rs 395

 Kirpal Dhillon, the author of this book, has held many 

 important posts. He was the director of the police (training) 

 in the home ministry, as well as the joint director of the 

 Central Bureau of Investigation. He also served as the director 

 general of police in Punjab and in Madhya Pradesh. In this 

 book, Dhillon takes a look at one of the most violent epochs 

 in Indian history the Sikh militancy in Punjab, from 1978 

 to 1993.

 Dhillon examines this troubled period from three different perspectives. First, he locates the root of terror within the process of identity-formation among Sikhs, and provides a detailed account of the beginning of the bloodshed. Second, he focusses on the dubious role played by the Indian State in dealing with the rights and demands of the Punjabi-speaking population. Finally, Dhillon also unravels the horrific nature of hard policing, a policy that was adopted by the Punjab police to counter militancy.

 The first two chapters discuss what Harjot Oberoi calls the nation-state phase of Sikh identity-formation. Sikh history is full of upheavals and the process of identity formation was in turn dissipative and intense in the face of real or perceived threats. Guru Govind Singhs founding of the Khalsa in 1699, the Gurdwara reform movement in 1920-25, the Khalistan movement of the Eighties all of these represent critical junctures in the configuration of Sikh identity. Dhillon seems to agree with W.H. McLeod and J.S. Grewal, who state that the Sikhs, who were originally a pacifist community, developed a militant outlook during the Khalsa movement. 

 Dhillon also points out that Sikh militancy was brought about by many factors: the Hindutva ideology, followed by the Arya Samaj and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the denial of a separate Sikh identity, the creation of the state of Haryana on pseudo-linguistic lines and the governments support to Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale helped in the formation of separatist sentiments.

 Dhillon is critical of Operation Blue Star and provides a chilling description of the Sikh carnage in the wake of Indira Gandhis assassination. Dhillon believes that the construction of the self on the part of the community was brought about by a sense of paranoia. Not only did the government create an image of Sikhs that alienated the community from the rest of the nation, it also failed to assuage the communitys fears regarding the lack of security and self-dignity.

 NOT ON ITS OWN FEET YET

 Gwynne Dyer

 A forthcoming television documentary to mark the 300th anniversary of Scotlands union with England is called A chip on each shoulder, which pretty much sums up the attitude of the Scots towards England. Britain will get a Scotsman as prime minister when Gordon Brown takes over from Tony Blair, but when Scotland votes in May for its own devolved parliament, there is a good chance that the separatists of the Scottish National Party will win the most seats.

 It was on 16 January, 1707 that the Scottish parliament passed the Act of Union and put an end to itself, but the union with England was not popular then either. The two countries had shared a king ever since James VI of Scotland succeeded the childless Queen Elizabeth as James I of England. In the following year, he started calling himself king of Great Britain, resurrecting the old Latin name for the island, but the two countries stayed separate for another century.

 Scotlands reluctance was understandable, since it has always had about a tenth of Englands population. It had its own history, its own laws, its own version of the protestant faith (Presbyterianism), and no desire to be swamped by the richer and more numerous English. It could only be bribed into voting for the union after financial disaster befell a large part of the Scottish bourgeoisie and gentry at the start of the 18th century.

 Scotland kept its own legal and educational systems, but what emerged from the negotiations was not a federal state; it was a unitary state with strong Scottish representation in the new British parliament. Most Scots rejected the union as a sell-out, but they literally did not have a vote on the matter. And, in the long run, the resentment died down, because the Act of Union gave the Scots equal access to the rapidly expanding British empire.

 Still together

 For over two hundred years, most Scots saw the empire as their own and prospered greatly from it, though they always had a chip on their shoulder about the English. Then the empire came to an end, Britains power went into relative decline, and Scottish dissatisfaction with the union with England started to grow. The rise of the SNP has been driven not by oppression or exploitation Scotland gets almost 20 per cent more public spending per capita than England but just by a vague, pervasive sense of grievance.

 From P.G.Wodehouse down to the present, this has given rise to a litany of patronising English jokes about the petulant Scots. But now, apart from the budget subsidy, there is no particular reason for Scotland to stay in the United Kingdom.

 Most English people do not care much about that one way or the other, but the Labour Party certainly does, because a parliament elected solely in England would have an almost perpetual Conservative majority. That is why Tony Blairs government resurrected Scotlands own parliament in 1999, after almost 300 years. He devolved power over health, education and most other domestic matters in Scotland to the newly-created Scottish executive but Scotland kept all of its MPs in the parliament down in London too.

 The idea of devolution was to kill separatism, but it also gave the Scottish Nats a chance to govern Scotland. The SNP has promised a referendum on independence if it wins power this May. It reassures nervous voters that an independent Scotland would still be safely contained within the European Union. It argues that revenues from North Sea oil would make up for the subsidies from English taxpayers. It could win and then things would get quite exciting for a time.

 But the North Sea oil is rapidly running out, and the Scots are a cautious, prudent people, so the excitement is unlikely to end in actual separation. Much ado about nothing, you might say.

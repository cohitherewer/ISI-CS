 How to outlive the fruits 

of success

 Men of Steel, 

 By Vir Sanghvi, Roli, Rs 295 

 This book provides interesting personal insights into the lives of some of the great businessmen in contemporary India. The Men of Steel profiled by Vir Sanghvi include Ratan Tata, Vijay Mallya, Nandan Nilekani, Sunil Bharti Mittal, Bikki Oberoi and Azim Premji. For those who dont know much about the make up of Indias business environment and the men who rule it, this book makes for an informative read. It not only provides detailed statistics to illustrate the achievements of some of these men, but also an understanding of their behavioral nuances, little things that possibly led them on to greatness. For those who might be looking for pointers (How did these men do it? What are the rules that business entrepreneurs need to play by in India?), this book offers a few good ones. For instance, Nandan Nilekani, MD and CEO of Infosys, proves that it is possible to be highly successful in your business endeavours in India without greasing palms. 

 Sanjeev Chandrashekar, former CEO and Chairman of BPL Mobile, shows us that much of his tragedies as well as successes were largely determined by the politics of the day. This demonstrates that so many factors crucial to the running of a business enterprise can indeed be a matter of luck. Uday Kotaks (of the Kotak Group) formula for success has more to do with outliving what youve created rather than making the big bucks (though he has made plenty of the latter as well).

 By the authors own admission, two names that are noticeably missing from this powerhouse are the Ambani brothers. Apparently, neither of them was willing to discuss the fall-out between them, and at the time that Sanghvi was writing these profiles for the Hindustan Times, Mumbai, their split dominated the news. However, I personally feel that the book remains incomplete without their profiles. They are two of the top industrialists in our country and to publish a book called Men of Steel without them in it (although there are several references to them in other profiles) does both the book and the Ambani brothers disservice. 

 Also, given that were in 2007, and the fall-out is generally referenced as a matter of historical fact at this point, I wonder why Sanghvi did not go back to each brother and get their personal stories. Even if they had refused to divulge any details of their fall-out, they would still have made very interesting profiles, worthy of being a part of this collection.

 While Vir Sanghvi tells us in his introduction that some of the material may be dated, as his interviews with these business leaders were taken well before this collection was published, I feel that some areas were worth updating. For instance, he leaves out an important fact about Vijay Mallya. Sanghvi feels that Mallya was quite mistaken in not offering a premium club class when he first launched Kingfisher Airlines. What he fails to mention is that Mallya did eventually realize the potential benefits of doing so and in the first half of 2006, he did, in fact, launch Kingfisher First. I understand that this information may have been omitted due to timing (perhaps the book went to press before Kingfisher First was launched), but I think this is an important point that should have been included in the book. It further demonstrates the heights to which Mallya has reached, and the shrewd business sense that he has developed over the years.

 Finally, I would have liked to learn a little more about Ratan Tatas earlier years. Throughout the book, Sanghvi has very generously (vis--vis his interviewees, of course) offered us snippets of information anecdotes, lessons learnt, and so on from these mens earlier years. This is distinctly missing in Ratan Tatas case. There is a reference or two to his earlier days, but no real meat.

 On the whole though, I found the book very enjoyable, and got the distinct notion that this is a book for a wide readership not just for the business minds and this, I believe, was the authors intention. In fact, he tells us in his introduction that it is precisely because he is not a business journalist that his format works. I especially enjoyed the more anecdotal excerpts. For instance, how Ratan Tata gave away his annual bonus to his staff, who have been driven into unemployment overnight because of a decision that was neither his nor one that he favoured. Or how Bikki Oberoi the 77-year-old vice chairman of the Great Eastern Hotels was in the middle of writing an apology letter to a guest who had complained, when Sanghvi came to interview him. Or how... well, lets leave it at that. The author would not be too thrilled if I gave it all away.

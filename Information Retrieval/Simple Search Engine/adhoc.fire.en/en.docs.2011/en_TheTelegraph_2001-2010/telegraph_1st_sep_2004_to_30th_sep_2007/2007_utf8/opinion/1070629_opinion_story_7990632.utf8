 Down with the fun

 No fun please, were Indian 

 Sir At a time when India is among the world leaders in HIV/AIDS cases, look how the Madhya Pradesh government is helping the cause (Sex toys drive bedroom cops wild, June 20). Instead of spreading awareness among children and adults, the Bharatiya Janata Party government of the state first banned sex education in state-run schools. Now comes the shocking proposal of banning the Crezendo brand of vibrating condoms. A sensible government would not only encourage the sale of vibrating condoms and their like, but also think of setting up sex-toy shops for both men and women. If means of self-gratification were readily available, people would no longer feel the urge to get into risky physical relationships. This in turn would certainly bring down cases of HIV/AIDS, besides helping sexually incompatible married couples. With sex-toys around, visits to brothels by teenagers would also come down drastically. One hopes that the Madhya Pradesh minister, Kailash Vijayvargiya, wakes up to the ground reality and refrains from taking the retrograde step. 

 Yours faithfully,

 A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Sir It is amazing that ministers in Madhya Pradesh have nothing better to do than worry about the sale of sex toys in the state. But then, what more can one expect of a government which let its moral prejudices stop sex-education in state-run schools? The chief minister, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, has said that he would not allow anything which goes against Indian culture. Going by his governments recent actions, it would seem that Chauhan considers sexual activity to be against Indian culture. If only his countrymen thought so, the country would not be straddled with such a mammoth population problem. Next, the Madhya Pradesh government will probably ban the ancient Indian work, Kamasutra (some evidence will be found which will prove that it is not an Indian text at all), or declare that the erotic sculptures at Khajuraho are the work of Muslim invaders. Why doesnt the chief minister concentrate on development of the state, which has some of the lowest development indicators in the country?

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir It makes no sense to criticize the government company, Hindustan Latex Limited, for introducing Crezendo as a tool for heightened sexual pleasure. Admittedly, sex is a basic physical need for men and women, and the State has no business poking its nose in the private lives of its individuals, merely because some politicians disapprove of any device which might help increase sexual pleasure. Who knows, the new condom may restore sexual attraction in marriages where earlier, the man may have been seeking sex outside marriage. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Costly mistake

 Sir Error kills would-be doctor (June 22) reveals how restlessness and impatience have become typical of the behaviour of the present generation. Overarching parental expectation is often responsible for such extreme reaction. Of course, Dilip Gautams death has been largely caused by the callousness of the authorities, who made the error in the published results of the Uttar Pradesh Combined Pre-Medical Test. But a bureaucratic lapse does not justify the suicide. Academic brilliance does not equip a person to face the world. One must learn to cope with the worst and not submit so easily to the vagaries of fortune.

 Yours faithfully,

Ashis Kr Bhowmick, Calcutta

 Sir The suicide of Dilip Gautam exposes a few disturbing truths. While it was highly irresponsible of Poorvanchal University to release an erroneous result, surely it cannot be entirely blamed for Gautams untimely death. In this savagely competitive world, youngsters have forgotten to accept failure for what it is worth. The pressure to perform well, outshine others, and satisfy ones ever-demanding parents forces many to take these drastic steps. Parents should take heed of these incidents and be more caring towards their children. Else, the consequences might be too dear.

 Yours faithfully, 

Sayan Bhattacharya, Calcutta

 Sir The indifference of authorities in publishing results of examinations is not new. It has, for decades, jeopardized the lives and careers of Indian students. In Dilip Gautams case, it took his life. According to news items, the West Bengal joint entrance examination board has allegedly broken its declared rule, and doubled the marks of mathematics and biology which were already double that of physics and chemistry. This change, having been announced after the exam was over, has ruined the careers of many students. But the West Bengal government has not taken any steps so far.

 Yours faithfully,

Purushottam Sah, Uttarpara

 DIARY

 What is common to Pratibha Patil, Ujjwala Raut and Lalita Pawar, apart from the fact that they are all members of the fairer sex? For the right answer, look at the just-released tome on the first woman president of India which is selling at Rs 595 for its hard-bound edition. The book offers little that is not already in the public domain. But take heart, it tries to provide the moneys worth with the names of all previous occupants of the Rashtrapati Bhavan, information about the powers of the Indian president, history of the Marathas from Shivaji to Yashwant Rao Balwantrao Chavan, and names and countries of other famous and not-so-famous women leaders all over the world. If you are wondering where the Marathas came in from, then you should turn to the chapter titled, Pratibhas background: Marathas, a prominent race. That is from where you gather that Patil is a Kunbi Maratha, a sub-caste residing mainly in Maharashtra and Karnataka, and learn about the other famous Kunbi women. That is, about Raut and Pawar. There are exhaustive details about the early life, education, marriage et al of the two. You also learn that each of the 96 Maratha clans use several different surnames. A total of 3,847 surnames have been provided, and the next 55 pages are solely devoted to listing them. Truly, a collectors item.

 The sentencing of Sanjay Dutt has unsettled everyone, particularly Salman Khan. He is supposed to have called off a big bash that he and his brothers, Arbaaz and Sohail, had planned in order to celebrate the 19th birthday of their sister, Arpita. Sanjus fate, quite obviously, disturbs the Khans deeply. But there is a contrary opinion. The cases involving the black buck hunt, the road accident and pub brawls still hang over Salmans head. If the arm of the law has been long enough to reach Munnabhai, there is no reason why it cant find Sallu.

 The Babalog Club has been there for a while in the capital, its members chiefly the scions of political families the younger Pilot, Deora and, quite obviously, Gandhi. Now the girls wanna have fun as well. So they have formed their own friendship band. The three prime movers are Supriya Sule (daughter of Sharad Pawar), Kanimozhi (d/o Karunanidhi) and Poonam Rao Mahajan (d/o Pramod Mahajan). They are reportedly meeting over lunch or dinner regularly to exchange political views, among other tidbits, despite professing very different ideologies. Thats what friends are for!

 Sonia Gandhi is on top of the world, and it shows. At a recent function during the unveiling of a statue in Parliament House, Sonia found herself standing alongside Sushma Swaraj, who was heard speaking in Kannada to some Andhra MPs. Sonias eyes lit up. She is supposed to have gently nudged Sushma to say, You learnt to speak Kannada because of me. Did you not? Sushma smiled, but said nothing. Perhaps the not-too-pleasant memories of her defeat in Bellary came flooding back.

 The book release of the former revenue secretary, NK Singh, was an occasion for some verbal powwow between Mani Shankar Aiyar and P Chidambaram. Mani seemingly seized his chance to speak his mind on the much-advertised ten per cent growth. Chidambaram was reminded of Indias standing in the human development index and asked, Is panchayati raj the priority of any government since 1989-91? Later Jyotiraditya Scindia also asked why funds should not be given straight to the panchayats for spending. At this point, Chidambaram lost his cool and reminded the two that state leaders, including those in Madhya Pradesh, wanted the money to be routed through them. Any more questions, Mani?

 Narendra Modi is a disturbed man. Miffed over senior leaders supporting the rebels, he is supposed to have called Rajnath Singh. Sometime in the conversation, Modi reportedly dropped hints that he would resign in an election year, if the rebellion was not quelled. Independent observers say that Modis ploy is a clever one. After UP, the BJP would never dare to replace the Chhote Sardar. But the task before the beleaguered Rajnath is not easy. He may have denied supplying or supporting offensive anti-Modi contents in the news magazine, but rebel MLAs in Gandhinagar are getting restless. What if they start resigning one by one?

 A scientist is a man of precision. For as long as he was president, APJ Abdul Kalam took personal care to update his website, that is the official website of the president of India, www.presidentofindianic.in. The moment he left Rashtrapati Bhawan, the website was denuded of all material put up by Kalam, including his vision of making India a great economic power by 2020. At present, the site is under renovation probably as his successor struggles to locate worthwhile material to post on the website. On finding out the facts, Kalam is said to have wasted no time in starting a website of his own. It is www.abdulkalam.com. All the matter that was there on the official website has been relocated to the new one. A pioneering Bangalore-based IT entrepreneur is supposed to have helped the former president create his new website. So now you know where to look if you are looking for those Kalamesque homilies on schools, sanitation or science.

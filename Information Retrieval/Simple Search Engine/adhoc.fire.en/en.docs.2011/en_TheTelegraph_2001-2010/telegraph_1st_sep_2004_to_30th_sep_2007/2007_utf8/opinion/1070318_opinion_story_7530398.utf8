 HORRID WEATHER

 More than heat-waves, droughts, floods and the resulting mass deaths, what governments seem to understand best is money. What else would explain Britains brave new bill on climate change following last Octobers doomful review of the economics of climate change by Mr Nicholas Stern? The first report of the United Nations intergovernmental panel on climate change, earlier this year, established beyond doubt that human activity has contributed significantly to climate change, and that even if humans were to change their behaviour now, the earth would still become a more dangerous place, plagued by extreme weather events and their disastrous consequences. The Stern review, prepared by a distinguished development economist, presented this catastrophic vision of the future as the most comprehensive market-failure that human beings would ever see. So he seems to have convinced his own country, at least, that investing large sums of money now on measures to reduce carbon emissions will bring dividends on a comparably catastrophic scale; it would be entirely mad, therefore, not to make this investment. Ultimately, what is at stake here is not just money, of course, but human lives. Hence, Britains draft climate change bill, which makes Britain the first country to create legally binding targets for reducing carbon emission. Britain seems to have found a way of saving the world that takes a reassuringly different stand from that taken by the United States of America. To the relief of many, the Kyoto Protocol seems to have brought out a different Tony Blair than the War on Terror.

 A 60 per cent reduction on 1990 carbon levels by 2050, to be monitored by an independent public body perhaps this is too little, too late. Besides, the bill does not quite specify exactly how this target will be met. There are no annual targets, but five-year carbon budgets that might end up burdening one government with the previous ones lapses. The other greenhouse gases are not mentioned, and shipping and international aviation are spared. Yet green campaigners are seeing this bill as a step, even a revolutionary one, in the right direction. To see the predictions made by the IPCC and Stern reports as real, and thus be galvanized into collective, coordinated political and legislative action is the bills lesson to the world especially the poorer countries, which would be the worst victims of climate change. Nations like India, China and Brazil can no longer look away from how they are all implicated in the process and results of climate change. The victimhood mentality which sees the richer nations as causing most of the climate change, and regards other issues, like poverty and health, as more immediately important will have to be shed for a more conscious and proactive role.

 Climate change must be fully integrated into development policy, forcing governments to confront, sooner rather than later, legally binding frameworks of accountability.

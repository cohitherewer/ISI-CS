 Violence, from the inside

 The colours of violence (Penguin, Rs 275) by Sudhir Kakar offers interesting psychological insights into the phenomenon of communal violence in India. A vast body of literature has dealt with communalism as a phenomenon, its forms and causes. But what sets Kakars work apart is his attempt to understand the violence and the process of identity formation among Hindus and Muslims on the basis of deep-rooted anxieties and uncertainties produced by the process of modernization. Kakar incorporates the voices of both survivors and the perpetrators, and also shows how linkages between history, culture and individual development create fault lines among communities.Kakars book is truly engaging in its depiction of the shades of violence from the inside.

 Chowringhee (Penguin, Rs 295) by Sankar is the English rendition of a cult Bengali novel. Set in the Fifties, the plot revolves around the lives of a group of men and women who work and reside in the Shahjahan, a hotel in Calcutta. Shankar, the protagonist, is a young hotel employee who studies the people around him in the shared spaces of the hotel the bars, the backrooms and the suites. What does not escape the young mans notice are the secret lives of the inhabitants full of shattered dreams, wicked desires and machinations that remain hidden behind the good cheer and happiness. In a way, Shankars account binds the private and the public in a seamless tapestry, and turns the stories of the hotels inhabitants into a tale of the city itself. Witty and sympathetic, the original had become immensely popular in the Sixties. Arunava Sinhas translation now gives the readers an opportunity to revisit this classic in English.

 17 tomatoes: Tales from Kashmir (IndiaInk, Rs 225) by Jaspreet Singh attempts to paint the horror and the beauty of Kashmir in a gentle light. These fourteen stories are linked to one another by the experiences of two Sikh boys growing up in an army camp. Singh throws in a fair share of missiles, religion, the gardens of Shalimar and Nishat, and even cricket to create the image of an enchanting land that has now been reduced to a state of despair and melancholy. 

 Hushed Voices (IndiaLog, Rs 195) by Munmun Ghosh has been dedicated to ...commuters everywhere. Ghoshs book, however, focuses on migrants in Mumbai who travel the length and breath of a giant metropolis in order to make a living. There is an elegiac quality to the prose, which captures the frenetic pace as well as moments of stillness that are a part of a migrants life in this city of dreams.

On his way, he survives leering lamas and some cruel bandits led by Nangbo, a man gifted with magical powers, and even manages a short stay in the goldfields of Thok Jalong. This is a tale of wondrous adventures which will definitely find takers among children tired of the exploits of Harry Potter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 NO MERCY

 The question of rights and entitlements in healthcare is still an alien concept in India. It is taken for granted that the ill, the dying and their party are going to be at the mercy of those who are kind enough to attend to their medical needs. And this is a relationship in which the only absolute is that the patient must pay up. Any notion of the consumers rights, generally in its early stages of awareness and enforcement in India, is seldom applied to medical services. But things are changing. In Calcutta, there has always been a noble tradition of stoic resignation to medical ignorance, callousness, corruption and greed. But people here, particularly from the middle classes and above, are waking up to the fact that they could demand certain minimum standards of care from those who are being paid to provide it. Patrick Cranstons cruel demise, recently, at the Mission of Mercy Hospital in Calcutta, together with disputes over billing at other city hospitals, has brought to the fore the question of patients basic rights.

 Cranstons treatment was stopped by the hospitals ICCU because his dues around Rs 24,000 had not been cleared. According to norms stipulated by the Medical Council of India, reasonable continuity of care and considerate and respectful treatment are part of a patients basic rights. Given the huge number of people availing themselves of private healthcare facilities in the city, it would be easy for private healthcare providers to give the excuse of unfeasibility when it comes to respecting these rights. Accessible, affordable and user-friendly legal channels for redress and, equally important, the proper running of the governments healthcare system for providing alternative support are essential for ensuring these standards. The question of rights is just as relevant to, and urgently necessary for, government institutions as it is in the sphere of private healthcare. Legal empowerment goes a long way towards making people in need of medical care feel less helpless.

 PLAYING GAMES

 It is not uncommon for national and international sporting events to carry political and cultural messages. The most obvious message from the just-concluded National Games in Guwahati is that the Assamese want peace as much as any other people do. True, the Central and the state authorities made elaborate security arrangements for the event. The decision of the United Liberation Front of Asom not to disrupt the games also helped to create the right atmosphere. Still, a series of bomb-blasts in Guwahati and elsewhere in Assam on the eve of the event could have kept the majority of the people away from it. The popular enthusiasm over the games is thus a clear indication of the peoples preference for peace and stability in the state. It also signals a rejection of the Ulfas thesis of Assamese sovereignty. The people of Assam would not have celebrated the event so spontaneously if they did not share the national identity of the games. The prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, clearly had this in mind when he praised the patriotic people of Assam for ensuring peace during the games. The games may not have been a test of patriotism, but the message of peace is unmistakeable.

 Yet, terror and violence can return to Assam to break the short spell of peace. New Delhi and Dispur have a moral obligation to work on the message from the games. The last round of the peace process may have foundered on the Ulfas betrayals. The militants failed to reciprocate the armys gesture of declaring a unilateral ceasefire. Worse, they used the reprieve to re-arm and re-group themselves. The Ulfa should have realized by now that violence cannot be a pre-condition for peace initiatives. Nor can the Ulfa keep pretending that it has the peoples support for its secessionist movement. Instead of getting anywhere near its goal of a sovereign Assam, the militancy has led to an endless bloodbath. And innocent people have been its worst victims. The only sensible thing that the Ulfa can do is return to the table forpeace-talks. Once these resume, all issues can be discussed, as the prime minister had indicated. Even the demand for the release of five senior leaders of the Ulfa can be placed on the table. But violence by the Ulfa will only result in counter-violence by the state. Both sides can take the spirit of the games forward by resuming the dialogue.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 RED ALERT

 Multiple messages are conveyed by the red light in India, particularly in conjunction with spotless white. And not necessarily of urgency, as the light fitted to an ambulance, a police car or a fire engine is supposed to give out. A red light flashing atop a vehicle is expected to imply distance and privilege the markers indispensable to the image of the quintessential Indian VIP. Access to a car and its beacon makes up a part of the inviolable property right of a distinguished Indian or anyone who believes he can lay claim to such a distinction. The light is flaunted, and indiscriminately, not only by those ordained by the state to use it but also by those who know how to make full use of their brush with power. Thus, apart from ministers, senior bureaucrats and judges, the beacon is freely used by their subordinates and cronies. The overwhelming affection for the red light that is evident on the streets, at public events and private parties is, in fact, symptomatic of the hankering after power and authority. This is what makes something as normal as ministers congregating without the use of their beacon in Britain seem an extraordinary event. To an Indian minister, who expends so much and slaves so hard to reach his position, it would appear most foolish not to show off his exalted status before a public gullible enough to have taken him seriously.

 Not all are as credulous though. VIPs have had rather unpleasant exchanges with recalcitrant members of the public who have at times gored the red lights or severely damaged the cars bearing them. Political leaders visiting Behrampore town in West Bengal could attest to the bullish nature of one such dissenter. But such incidents are rare. Public activism against the abuse of the privilege is even more rare, although public interest litigations are now being filed. The judiciary has found it difficult to force the state authorities to curb the misuse, given the latters complete disinterest in the matter. The police have felt the urge to intercept cars using the beacon illegally only at the prodding of the court. Despite judicial censure, the state has, in fact, had no qualms in approaching the court for a further extension of the list of those who can have the privilege. And yet, if the issue is all about commanding public respect, the distinguished and the distinguishable would have done much better had they depended on their own capabilities instead of the red lights to bear their import.

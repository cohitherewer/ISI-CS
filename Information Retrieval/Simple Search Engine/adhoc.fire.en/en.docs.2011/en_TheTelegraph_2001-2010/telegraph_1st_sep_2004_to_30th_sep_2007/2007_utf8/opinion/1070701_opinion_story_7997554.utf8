The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 In the no-holds-barred contest for the post of the president, the media have never been too far away. But the Congress, for its own reasons, wanted them closer. And since Pratibha Patil was the first woman contestant for the post, it made enormous sense (to a few Congresswallahs at least) to call in the ladies to have a pep talk with the PM, who has recently taken on the responsibility to dodge all salvos fired at the party candidate. The Indian Women Press Corp was invited. But trouble began when IWPC chose to restrict the ladies circle to the executive panel members of the organization. The more aggressive of the kind, working for some of the national dailies and other major publications, were left out. Last heard, the PMO had been flooded with protest letters and complaints. Is this democracy? the PM was being asked. There were also plans to organize a tte--tte between the PM and journalists accredited with the Press Information Bureau. The executive body of the PIB has been wiser, however. It made it clear that either each and every accredited member of the body was to be called or none of them. The move has been shelved as the PMO pleaded its inability to accommodate 1,000-odd scribes. But perhaps now there is less and less need of hardselling Pratibha.

 A young Gandhi is getting restless. No, not Rahul, who is out of the country, but cousin Feroze Varun, who seems desperate to quit the BJP and get a hold back on the family legacy. Varun avoided attending the recently-concluded BJP national executive meet held in Delhi, although he is supposed to have been very much there in the capital. Mother Maneka has made her disgust at the saffronites quite obvious, especially in the executive meet, where she targeted RSS men. She is supposed to have been asked to spend from her pocket during the UP polls and get compensated later on. Her outburst is rare since she is hardly ever heard in the party fora. Time to call it quits then?

 Times have never been unhappier for the former CM of Punjab. Amarinder Singh is now being administered the same medicine by the Akali-BJP government that he once gave the Badals. That, however, is the least of his problems. He seems to have been dumped by his own party, which made no attempt to save him from being grilled by the state vigilance bureau. The indifference, some say, is explained by the captains close family ties with K Natwar Singh. Perhaps Amarinder should now do what his relative has done change colour.

 They never say die. Kaka Joginder Singh, Mohan Lal Dhartipakar, Nagarma Bajoria, and some more like them, are the bravehearts who never shy away from a contest. Dhartipakar has had a go at various polls from elections to civic bodies to the Lok Sabha to the presidential post some 280 times, although he has been a consistent loser. He would have made an exception this time if APJ Abdul Kalam had been a candidate. That seems like Dhartipakars ultimate compliment to the scientist, who, he thinks, is the best. As for why someone so committed like Dhartipakar has never wanted to join a political party, he says, Agar mai aisa karta to Dhartipakar se kursipakar ban jata (it would have turned the earth-capturer to seat-capturer). To win, Dhartipakar would have needed the signatures of at least 50 MPs and MLAs who would vote for him. The man may have failed to manage that this time, again, but this is not the last time he will have a go at it.

 Has the government service become a passport to lucrative assignments with private companies? At least two dozen senior babus seem to be waiting to be relieved from the duties to take up employment with the private sector. The latter is keen to get the babus work for them as they can best liaise with the babus at the other end of the table. One such babu, HJ Dora, recently joined the group implementing the modernization project of the Delhi airport. Dora, who retired as the Central vigilance commissioner a couple of months ago, seemingly, did not even wait for the obligatory permission from the government before taking up the new job. 

 In 1969, VV Giri fought a petition filed in the Supreme Court for indulging in corrupt practices to influence voters. Giri was contesting against Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy to enter Rashtrapati Bhavan. Pratibha Patils experience is thus not unique.

 A stint at the Rashtrapati Bhavan leaves no one unaffected. The outgoing president seems destined to defy his own principle while moving out of the office. APJ Abdul Kalam, a former bureaucrat, had built a reputation of sorts by declining government bungalows during his tenure as DRDO chief, then adviser to the defence minister. He continued to stay in guest houses of the DRDO till he moved to the palatial Rashtrapati Bhavan. The buzz now is that Kalam may be moving to 31, Aurangzeb Road or a similarly cosy accommodation in Lutyenss Delhi. The reason is security consideration, but who can say that Kalam is not a changed man? As for his likely successor, the choice is less spartan. As per drill, the establishment officer of the Rashtrapati Bhavan, on inquiring about the requirements of the future occupant, is supposed to have learnt that 10-15 rooms is required to be readied, together with special arrangements in the bathroom.

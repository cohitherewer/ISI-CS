The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 LONG TALE CUT SHORT

 Soumitra Das

 Visual Arts

 Gallery Nakshatras current exhibition (till July 10) is ambitiously titled, A Tale of Four Cities. The artists are from Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Calcutta, so the title is justified, but it does not guarantee any mark of distinction. The nine participants present very run-of-the-mill works. 

 Diptish Ghosh Dostidar paints a flying elephant and an undraped idol of Durga and her family. While there is some novelty in the foreshortened trompe loeil images, they have nothing more to recommend them. Kiran Chopras takes on Picasso and Gauguin are insipid, and Laxman Aelays drawings are almost carbon copies of the works of a senior artist from Hyderabad. Only his trademark eroticism is missing. 

 One of Sunil Lohars works of a huge bath with men wading in it held some hope, till one saw his second work. It is not even once removed from the original by one of our senior bestsellers. Prasenjit Senguptas male figures, with a hint of androgyny, are seen quite frequently nowadays. But like most human beings who have taken a conscious decision to undereat, they lack substance. 

 However, Chippa Sudhakars mixed media work on wood (picture), with its man and woman with classical features and paper boat, seems to tell an untold story. Turned out that he is from MS University, Baroda.

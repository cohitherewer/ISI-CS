 WHERE ARE THE TRUE LEADERS?

 BONA 

 FIDE - Malvika Singh

 Will it ever be possible for the Congress to function like a well-oiled, competent organization that respects individuals and collectives, where all the levels of leadership support each other and move in a synchronized manner to achieve the bare minimum expected of a modern, honest political party?

 Here is a group that could represent the plurality of India as it once did when Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and Motilal Nehru gave up their lucrative professions and comfortable lives to lead by example and free millions of the subjugated in the subcontinent from the rapacious domination of an external power. A gradual dilution of that extraordinary morality and wholehearted endeavour to bring dignity into the lives of Indians across castes and economic strata began to happen to the body politic post-1947. Once again India is desperate for a renewal of dignity.

 In the 60th year of freedom, the Congress the party that once hoisted the national tricolour after bringing down the Union Jack, a party whose leader made a tryst with destiny on August 15, 1947 needs to reassess its mandate, its promises and its manifesto. It has a set of leaders today, both young and middle-aged, who stand out and deserve to be celebrated. But the party consistently manages to insult and tarnish the image of its most competent members and their strengths. It is always the mediocre who try and jam the best and brightest. Personal and intellectual insecurities lead to acts that are detrimental to party ethics and operations. 

 Falling numbers

 The time has come to restore the original ethos of the Congress. Today it is neither a regional party nor a majority national ruling party. It has lost almost all its earlier supremacy and substantial numbers and seats in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, it has not been able to make significant inroads in Tamil Nadu, Orissa and West Bengal, and it is not identified with or entrenched in any state like some of the other parties. The Congresss ability to make an impact, to enable it to win and strengthen its position in individual states and put down healthy roots, leaves much to be desired. Over the decades, the Congress has lost ground. And, most importantly, it has not been able to throw up any pan-national leaders except for Sonia Gandhi and now, Manmohan Singh. The direct descendants of the Nehru family continue to be an intrinsic part of the contemporary political narrative of India. They have always presented themselves as pan-Indian leaders. Other political players are dominant in areas they come from, active as regional satraps.

 New faces wanted

 The Congress, having lost its once dominant position across India is wholly dependent on those who represent the face of this grand old party, the Gandhis. But its diminished status and the growing insecurity of its older and tired members compel the party to work in factions. This leads to in-fighting, which creates a negative base and scares away competent Congressmen from reforming and restructuring the party. 

 The lack of any fresh agenda also keeps away any possible new professionally-qualified recruits. Dialogue, debate and intellectual dissension seem not to have an internal forum in the party. And if there is such a forum no member has yet demonstrated the skill to make it work constructively and positively towards the cosolidation of good parliamentary democratic ethics. 

 Today, a proactive, modern-minded, top-brass leadership could, with ease, renew and rejuvenate the systems of operation and function within the framework of this democratic, secular, all-India party that once represented the plurality of India.

 HILLS BECOME A GARBAGE DUMP

 MALVIKA SINGH

 India is a country where the definition of wanton destruction and that of anarchic progress is the same. In Himachal Pradesh, for example, a state where the literacy figures are amongst the highest in the country, thoughtless degradation of the environment is starkly evident. Rampant felling of trees, a frightening scarcity of water, construction of hideous apartment blocks along mountain slopes (constructed with cement with no aesthetic sensibility), garbage flung down hillsides are what greet the visitor and plague the residents. The government has one excuse when asked about the pathetic condition of this extraordinary state it cannot risk saying No to anything or enforce the law for the fear of affecting the votebank. So, live for the moment and leave behind a land laden with garbage and diseases.

 The Shimla hills are in an unspeakable condition. There is no water, yet there is no effort at water harvesting. There are no garbage bins that segregate bio-degradable waste from man-made poisons. There are, seemingly, no laws for the creation of zones or rules governing construction. The pollution has turned into almost invisible ribbons of water what were once waterfalls, streams, and rivers. There is only one thing happening destruction, endorsed by populist politics. 

 Cost of populism

 Why is the populism used to finish building roads on time, be it roads in the capital city or the national highways? Why dont the leaders, so used to political protest, not compel the National Highways Authority of India to deliver on time? If China can deliver a first-rate highway within the scheduled time, why is India incapacitated? The answer is simple India is overwhelmed by corrupt money-making rackets. Citizens have reams of stories about them, all of which is true. But no one is accountable for the deep rot.

 The highway that connects Delhi and Haryana has been in the making for years. Bits and pieces are completed, others are not, and as one gets done the other needs redoing! Money rotates. People are traumatized. Frustrated, lunatic drivers go on mad killing sprees. Family life is disrupted in a country that professes its respect for the family! 

 Promises to keep

 Just think, sixty years as a free nation, and we still cannot have a road completed on time in the capital city. It is an unacceptable reality, one that is not addressed because the leaders, if you can call them that, are more interested in having the roads cleared for them and their families to drive upon, with sirens blaring, and reach their destination on time than keep the promises made to their urban vote banks. In common parlance, this kind of inhuman and errant behaviour is called hypocrisy. 

 Another scandal is the national highway that links Delhi and Chandigarh. It is a mess from Chandigarh , through Ambala, up to Kurukshetra and has been that way for three years, if not longer. As one approaches the Delhi border, NHAI boards block the dirt tracks that the citizens have to use, at huge cost to their vehicles, which they buy with their hard-earned money. Where is the care for the vote banks? Or, are you not part of the votebank if you are literate, if you work hard and generate wealth, or if you are honest?

 One thing is for sure, the Congress government will be out when Himachal Pradesh goes to the polls. Its incompetence, its inability to regulate the anarchic growth and set sensible rules and standards, its high-handededness when questioned about its failure, its political arrogance and infighting within the local party are as destructive as the ongoing assault on the environment and habitat.

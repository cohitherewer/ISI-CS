 DESCENT BEGINS

 More than the truth or otherwise that lies behind the various allegations hurled against Pratibha Patil what is significant is the level to which the campaign for the presidency has descended. The descent began, of course, with the Congresss decision to pick a complete non-entity to become its candidate for the race to reside in Rashtrapati Bhavan. The Congress chose not to arrive at a consensus with the other political parties, and put forward its own candidate who nobody had heard of before, and those who had heard of her hardly saw her as a potential presidential candidate. This bizarre choice on the part of the Congress started the ball rolling for a dirty campaign that serves only to demean the highest office of the Indian State. It goes without saying that the president of the country should have an untarnished image and an untainted past. These two conditions have not always been met in equal measure for all previous presidents, but such lapses need to be taken as exceptions rather than as the rule. The problem lies in the fact that there is no existing system which checks the background and the record of a person who is being proposed as a candidate for a very high office. Such a check only saves future embarrassment. When the high office is that of the president of the country, one easy way to avoid such checks is to pick a person who is known to be above controversy and whose integrity is unimpeachable. This would mean selecting a person who is not a politician. Under the present circumstances in India, such a choice is unimaginable since todays politicians prefer pliability to dignity when they pick their candidate to be president.

 The fact that Ms Patil is the subject of a vicious campaign is a function of the failure of politicians to choose someone who deserves to be president, and also of the lack of a systematic check into the background of candidates. It is too much to expect that Ms Patil, out of her own freewill, will refuse to become the president since she is not above suspicion and controversy. Her will may not be her own. Thus the problem remains and there is the danger that the election this time, its mud-slinging and the level of the candidates, will serve as precedence in the future. In India, the moral highground in politics has become a meaningless concept. The office of the head of State will inevitably be affected by that amorality. The downward slide has started.

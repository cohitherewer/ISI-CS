The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 PLAYING THE MUSCLEMAN

 The Indian government is strangely Janus-faced. When it looks at the economy it is reformist; but when it looks at other spheres it is completely statist. A powerful and interfering state pursuing a policy of liberalization and economic reforms is a contradiction that the government refuses to recognize. The most glaring and the most recent example of this is the manner in which the government is trying to ensure that cricket matches are shown on Doordarshan. Not satisfied with the arrangement that the matches would be shown on DD seven minutes after it was shown on the private channel that had won the rights to telecast the match live, the government has now decided to pass an ordinance that will make it mandatory for the private channel to share the live telecast with DD. The information and broadcasting minister, Mr Priya Ranjan Das Munshi announced that the ordinance had become absolutely necessary since the World Cup was round the corner.

 Mr Das Munshis reasoning passeth understanding. Why should the coming of the World Cup matches justify an ordinance? Unless, of course, the minister believes that the State-owned television channel has some special privileges that allow it to have rights to show the live telecast of cricket matches. It has no moral obligation either to show cricket matches. In fact, the argument, based on necessity, is no more than a ruse to cover hard and cold monetary calculations. Cricket, given its popularity in India, fetches huge advertisement revenue. The minister knows that, without cricket, DD will lose massive amounts of money. Lacking other instruments to access the revenue, the government wants to show and use its muscle. This is as bad an act of State interference and oppression as has been seen in independent India. It is nobodys case that DD should not make money. But it should make that money by participating in an open and competitive market. The fact of the matter is that DD does not have the rights to telecast the matches live. It cannot now claim that right merely because it is owned by the State. This strikes at the very root of the policy of allowing private companies to own and run television channels. Today it is cricket, tomorrow it might be films, and the day after, news.

 It is obvious that despite more than a decade of liberalization, the Indian State has not been able to junk the socialist baggage. The socialist mindset persists. This is what allows the present cabinet to even entertain the proposal that it can interfere anywhere and whenever it wants. The government uses its power to protect what it thinks are the States interests. The State actually should not have any interests except the preservation of law and order. But the government sees itself cast permanently in the role of the big brother. Mr Manmohan Singh took off the socialist scaffolding from the Indian economy. Why can he not do the same with the Indian government?

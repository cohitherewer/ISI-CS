The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 THE COOKIE CRUMBLES

 The last post was sounded on Friday to signal the end of Indias participation in the 2007 World Cup. Die-hard optimists will hope that Bangladesh will lose to Bermuda and thus enable India to stay on in the competition. Given the proverbial glorious uncertainty of cricket, it is entirely possible that the match between Bermuda and Bangladesh might produce a freak result. Cynics will be prone to suspect that the punters will ensure that Bangladesh loses to Bermuda so that India remains in the World Cup. If there is an upset in the Bermuda-Bangladesh encounter, then Indias chances in the World Cup will survive because of sheer luck (or what is worse, because of reasons totally extraneous to cricket), not because India has played well in the qualifying rounds. In fact, Indias showing, like that of Pakistan, has been pathetic. The departure of India and Pakistan, two of the biggest draws of the World Cup, is not without a silver lining. It highlights the fact that countries that were considered also-rans in international cricket Bangladesh, Ireland, and so on are playing well enough to challenge teams like India and Pakistan. Competition has opened up the World Cup. The Davids of the cricketing world are taking on and defeating the Goliaths. Notwithstanding the disappointment of the millions of cricket fans in India and Pakistan, it needs to be said that the exit of the Indian and the Pakistani elevens from the World Cup will probably do the teams some good. Cricketers in India and Pakistan have traded on their star value rather than on their performance. Hard practice at the nets and work-outs in the fitness sessions had become less important for the players than endorsements, sponsorships and other means of making more money. Cricket has become more professionalized, and this is good for the game and the players. But professionalism cannot be at the expense of the basic skills that go towards the making of a good cricketer. One of the demands on a competent player is that he performs on a day that he is expected to perform. The match against Sri Lanka was one such occasion, and the stars failed to deliver. There can be no excuses for this just as there can be no excuse for losing to a team like Bangladesh, which on paper is vastly inferior to the Indian side. 

 Indians are prone to looking for scapegoats. There will be an immediate baying for Greg Chappells blood. Very few will pause to consider that Chappell, when he started off, wanted to build a team for the future. That project fell victim to various vested interests and the coach was landed with a team in which experience prevailed over the needs of team-building. It is now clear that the experienced players failed to deliver. Indian cricket must forget recriminations and look to the future. The World Cup upset will also result in a reduction of fan frenzy which will be all for the good of the game and the players.

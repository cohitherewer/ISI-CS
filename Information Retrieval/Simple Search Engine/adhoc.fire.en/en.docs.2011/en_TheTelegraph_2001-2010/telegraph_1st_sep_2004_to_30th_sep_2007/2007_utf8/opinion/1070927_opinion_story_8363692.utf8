 YOUTH AND AGE

 The most convenient and the most facile interpretation that can be made of Rahul Gandhis appointment as general secretary of the Congress is that it is the continuation of the dynastic principle. This may well be true, but it diverts attention from some issues relating to context and timing. Mr Gandhis elevation comes as part of an overall package of changes within the party. One of the significant features of those changes is the number of young people who have been made members of crucial decision-making bodies within the party. Mr Gandhis debut as general secretary must be seen in the context of Jyotiraditya Scinidias appointment to the working committee as a special invitee, of Sachin Pilots membership of the future group and of the appointment of persons like Priya Dutt and Jitin Prasada to important positions and bodies. This context is not without significance. It is a sign that the Congress, while unwilling to completely abandon the old guard, is eager to infuse fresh, young talent into the organizational structure and strategy-planning cells of the party. There is a clear recognition that the future belongs to the youth. In this context, Mr Gandhi can only claim to be primus inter pares because of his family background.

 The other issue is timing, which cannot, of course, be separated from the context. It is becoming clear, as the brouhaha of the Left over the Indo-US nuclear deal intensifies, that the Congress would prefer to go in for early elections to enable it to shake off its dependence on the comrades. Early elections, a section of the Congress seems to think, are elections worth taking provided the organization is ready and charged. To guarantee this required new energy, youth has been brought into the party. The young men and women who have been inducted under the helmsmanship of Mr Gandhi will, it is hoped, be able to make an appeal to the young voters. It is worth noting that as general secretary, Mr Gandhi will be in charge of the Youth Congress and the National Students Union of India. General elections are also signalled by the creation of a manifesto committee in which there is a preponderance of old warhorses. This suggests that there is an attempt to balance youth with experience. The Congress is beginning to change, but is yet to come out completely from its chrysalis. The pull of the past may be the Congresss principal obstacle in meeting the challenges of the future.

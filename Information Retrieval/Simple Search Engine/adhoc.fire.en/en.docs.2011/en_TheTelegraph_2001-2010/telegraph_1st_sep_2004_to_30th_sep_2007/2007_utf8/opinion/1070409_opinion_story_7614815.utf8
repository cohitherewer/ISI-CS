The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 WITHOUT LOGIC

 The government introduces an incentive to promote a policy objective. It then makes rules to ensure that whoever obtains the concession promotes the objective. It attracts a flood of applicants for the concessions. To limit their number, it introduces minimum qualifications. It then finds that the advance of its concessionaires hurts some others. So it makes rules to make the lucky compensate the unlucky. It finds itself overwhelmed by the task of ensuring that all who deserve are compensated. So it makes rules to limit the maximum damage the concessionaires can inflict. This is the all-too-dreary course of policy-making in India. That was the story of industrial licensing and import licensing. Both grew to be dragons the government could no longer control; finally a crisis made the government put them down. That is the story of exchange control and environmental control, both of which continue. And that story is still being written for special economic zones.

 SEZs were progressing quite well until West Bengal got interested in them. Then the people rose against the peoples government, which wanted to modernize them replace their muddy rice fields by spanking offices and shopping malls. The communists are never wrong. So they blamed it all on the Central government, that it had not made enough rules. Much obliged to the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Centres Empowered Group of Ministers has introduced new rules, namely a limit of 5,000 hectares, a job guarantee for one person from every displaced family, and end of compulsory land acquisition by governments for privately set-up SEZs. The limit makes no sense. It affects only four SEZs proposed by three companies. At least two have advanced far in land acquisition, and will lobby the government for reversal. It ought to, but will not for fear of political consequences. A job guarantee, unmindful of the displaced families lack of skills as well as of the displacing businesss needs, makes forced marriages that the businessmen will do their best to get out of. A cash guarantee would have been better, but it would encourage many to claim falsely that they were displaced. And if governments are not going to sequester land, there does not have to be any restriction on the size, only a stipulation of fairness and lack of coercion.

 But even if the GOMs errors are rectified, the question should be asked: why have SEZs at all? If it is for export promotion, the country does not need exports; rather, it would be better off importing more. If it is for investment in infrastructure, such investment can be, and is being, promoted by tax concessions; there is every reason why such investment should not be diverted to a handful of SEZs. The West Bengal government persists in the folly of SEZs out of pride; the Centre persists out of pusillanimity. Both should give economic rationality a chance instead.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 Can there be smoke without fire? The Congress MP from Tezpur, Mani Kumar Subba, believes there can. He is being hounded by his political rivals for no fault of his. However, the party high command, after the apex court directive to the Central Bureau of Investigation to resolve the controversy over Subbas nationality, is no longer ready to take the MPs words at face value. His candidature in 1999 had been strongly contested by the Nagaland CM, SC Jamir. It was Ajit Jogi who had prevailed on 10 Janpath then. Now the party, its image already sullied by developments in Jharkhand, is not willing to take chances. Madam is supposed to have referred the case to the AICC ethic committee, headed by none other than the PM himself. Other members include heavyweights like AK Antony, Ahmad Patel and Margaret Alva. The coming elections in several states will give the team very little time. Another unenviable job for the good doctor.

 Perhaps madam should not be suspected of cosying up to Mayavati with a phone call on the latters birthday. It is a habit with Congressmen to felicitate leaders on such days. Things have come to such a pass now that even leaders aides are given the same treatment. Take the case of Vincent George, madams PA. Motorists travelling on the Delhi-Chandigarh highway cannot but notice the banner put up in a popular eatery in Karnal, wishing George Saheb a long and prosperous life on his birthday. The banner duly carries the names of the three Haryana MLAs of the party who are much concerned about Georges well-being. It has been a few weeks since that important day, but the banner continues to flutter.

 No one can accuse the Naxalites of lacking a sense of humour. This was evident from the rent contract some of them had signed in Bhopal with house-owners while they discreetly worked in an arms factory. One named Shivraj Patil, the Union home minister, as his father. When their cover was busted, the Maoist was asked why he had named Patil as his father. He referred to Patils recent statement in which he is supposed to have referred to Naxals as his misguided sons. Will the father bail out his sons?

 From lovers to neighbours. Aishwarya Rais first love, Salman Khan, was reported to be under the weather while Ash got engaged to Bachchan Jr. More drama seems to be in the offing. If things go right, the beauty queen and the tragic hero may be living three blocks away from each other on Mumbais posh Carter Road. Big B reportedly bought a bungalow at a huge, undisclosed sum for his son when he was engaged to Karishma Kapoor. The house has apparently been done up for the pair. As luck would have it, Sallu too has purchased a bungalow a stones throw away. Seems like it is going to be a case of being near, yet so far.

 The one-upmanship between a raja and a maharajah is in full swing in Madhya Pradesh. There is no love lost between Digvijay Singh and Jyotiraditya Scindia, who insists on being addressed as the Maharajah of Gwalior. While madams tin soldiers fight it out, the ruling BJP is sitting pretty. The two feuding royals came face-to-face at a gathering. Diggy Raja was quick to do a ceremonial bow towards Scindia. The latter returned the gesture by garlanding Digvijay. Scindias supporters are beside themselves with joy. Diggy had apparently vowed not to accept a garland till the Congress returns to power in the state. The maharajah has now managed to belittle the raja.

 Is the Union minister for textile, Shankersinh Vaghela, planning to quit the Congress and return to his parent party? And soon, because the elections in Gujarat are due for December this year? Vaghela is reportedly feeling suffocated in his adopted party. He has, seemingly, been in touch with the RSS and leaders close to Narendra Modi. Jumping boats is always such high art!

 DN Sahay, the Tripura governor, kicked up a storm at the Bhopal airport when CRPF jawans sought to question the identity of his wife, who was walking behind him. The VVIP took it as an affront. A probe has been ordered, naturally. 

 If one were to look more carefully, it would be possible to spot Swami Ashutoshnandji on the banks of the Ganga. Actor Ashutosh Rana, who played villain in Dushman and several other Bollywood flicks, is supposed to be in saintly robes these days on the confluence of the Yamuna and the Ganga. Some say it is difficult to miss him at the makeshift ashram of his guru, praying fervently or cleaning the place. However, Rana is not the only one to have gone the spiritual way lately. There is Mahant Tejaswini Giri, a law graduate and a trained pilot from Bangalore. She has chosen to become a Naga sanyasin and is presently one of the 3,500 of her kind in her akhara. Tejaswini still wants to fly a helicopter, but only to spread sanatan dharma across the globe. This daughter of an armyman would also like to go back to the court room, but only to take up the cudgels on behalf of those who have no money to seek justice. Wonder what Ranas plans are?

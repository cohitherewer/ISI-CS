 Letters to Editor

 Inconsistent comrades

 Sir The reaction of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) to the police firing in Khammam seems to be in variance with its spirited defence of the killings in Nandigram (Andhra spark lights Bengal fire, July 30). On the one hand, the leftists are busy justifying the police action in Nandigram. On the other, they are protesting against the firing in Khammam and demanding the Andhra Pradesh chief ministers resignation. The CPI(M)s logic is, of course, simple and built to serve the partys interests. Since it is in power in Bengal, the leftists have no option but to support Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his policies on industrialization. But since Andhra Pradesh is ruled by the Congress, it is easy for the Left to bay for Y.S. Rajshekhar Reddys blood. The CPI(M) was once known for its lofty ideals and moral standards. Unfortunately, decades in power in Bengal have corrupted the partys rank and file. Given its myopic political vision, arrogance and hypocrisy, the CPI(M)s popularity will decline further. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 A.S. Mehta,

 Sir The Marxists have expectedly criticized the Andhra Pradesh government over the Khammam firing and demanded the chief ministers resignation. Of course, the political alignment at the Centre means that Reddy will not have to resign. However, what matters is the fact that the Andhra Pradesh government has immediately announced compensation packages and also taken action against the errant police officers. All of this is in sharp contrast to what happened in Nandigram. In Bengal, the Congress has not pressurized the Left enough to compensate the victims families. This goes to show, once again, that the Congress will partner the Left in the next general elections so that the United Progressive Alliance can hold on to its seat of power. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 A.K. Das Sharma,

 Sir There are important differences between Nandigram and Khammam. The farmers in Nandigram, unlike their counterparts in Khammam, are not landless people who have secured farmlands by force. They were protesting the forcible acquisition of land for an industrial project; they were not demanding land or land reforms. Secondly, in Khammam, it was the police that resorted to firing while in Nandigram, CPI(M) cadre, masquerading as policemen, fired at their adversaries. Thirdly, the Andhra government has announced a judicial inquiry into the firing, suspended police officials and offered compensation packages to victims kin. The West Bengal government, by contrast, has steadfastly refused to do either of these. Finally, nobody resorted to rape and murder in Andhra Pradesh unlike the Tapasi Malik incident in Singur. The CPI(M) has adopted the old Marxist strategy of diverting attention from its own heinous deeds. However, Y.S.R. Reddy, the Andhra Pradesh chief minister, may find himself in a tight spot because of the political equations at the Centre. Sooner or later, Sonia Gandhi will broker a deal with the Left to save the Union government and sacrifice Reddy.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The editorial Friends in 

 deed, (July 31) states, Ostensibly, the partys agitation 

 in Andhra Pradesh is aimed at forcing the government to 

 distribute land to the landless. However, the ostensible 

 aim of the Marxists deserves further comment. Marxists 

 in Bengal are saying that the best use of land is not in 

 agriculture but in industry. If this Marxist argument were 

 accepted, the CPI(M) would have no moral right to demand 

 that the Andhra Pradesh government distribute land to the 

 landless, and not earmark it for industry. Besides, will 

 those agitating for land in Khammam be able to farm if merely 

 some land were given to them? Where would they acquire the 

 technical expertise and the money to invest in agriculture? 

 Instead of bowing to the demand of the Left and redistributing 

 the land, the state government should sell the land at a 

 good price and use the proceeds to help the poor. As for 

 the Marxists, they excel at doublespeak and falsehood. One 

 could begin by asking why the Bengal government is not distributing 

 government land to the landless but selling it to industrialists 

 at throwaway prices. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Asoke C. Banerjee, 

 Calcutta 

 Sir It is ridiculous to see the CPI(M) snatching land from farmers in one state while fanning dissent against land acquisition in another. Obviously, the party high command has no problems in speaking in two voices. It has been playing this cruel and cynical political game for a long time now. However, the Centres reaction to the two incidents is surprising. In the Nandigram incident, it remained a mute spectator but in the case of Khammam, it has decided to placate the CPI(M) and order an inquiry into the incident. This could only point out to an ominous nexus between the Congress and the CPI(M). 

 Yours faithfully, 

 P. Bandyopadhyay,

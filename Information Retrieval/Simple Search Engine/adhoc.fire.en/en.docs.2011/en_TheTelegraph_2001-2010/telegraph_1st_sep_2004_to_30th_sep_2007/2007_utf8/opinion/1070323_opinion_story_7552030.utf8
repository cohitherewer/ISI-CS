 REALITY CHECK

 The changing realities of the working place in India perhaps find their best reflection in the changing scope of the sexual harassment bill. Since it was first drafted in 2005, the document has undergone several reviews at the ministerial level, and now awaits its introduction in the budget session of parliament. Together with the guidelines provided by the Supreme Court on the issue in 1997, the sexual harassment of women in workplaces (prevention, prohibition and redressal) bill, 2006, could serve as a powerful tool to address the injustice perpetrated on a vulnerable section of workers by employers and male employees. The legal import that complaints of sexual harassment would henceforth automatically bear would now make it imperative for both the unorganized sector and the private sector to heed the guidelines to which they had so long paid only cursory attention. The bill seems to assure women a fair hearing, through the gendered structure of internal complaints committees, and fair play, by removing inquiry proceedings and trials from the public arena. The document specifies that the identities of complainants, witnesses, the details of the cases progress or follow-ups by employers would not be amenable to the exercise of the Right to Information Act. In doing so, it betrays the states paternalistic attitude towards women that has encouraged the framing of a gendered law of sexual harassment. The very fact that such a bill is being contemplated for women alone implies the non-recognition of the possibility of the other sex being the victim of similar violations in the workplace. Although it can be argued that the legislation acknowledges a social reality, just as those against dowry and domestic violence do, one cannot deny the fact that law, by definition, has to be non-discriminatory and impartial. By putting in place a sexual harassment law for women, and then cloaking its use in a thick shroud of secrecy, could prove to be counter-productive in the long run for those who are in dire need of help and protection.

 There can be no doubt that the privacy and safety of complainants and witnesses have to be guaranteed. But the blocking out of information, which actually bares the states deep discomfort in dealing with the matter, does not necessarily assure that. The absence of transparency in such sensitive cases would not only encourage misinterpretation of the law, but also promote its abuse.

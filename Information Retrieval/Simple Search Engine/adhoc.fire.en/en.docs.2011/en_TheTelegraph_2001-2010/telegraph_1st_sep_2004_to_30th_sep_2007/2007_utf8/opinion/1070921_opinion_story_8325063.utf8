 Rescuing the god

 Sir Secularism in India, unlike the Western concept, is not based on the negation of religion (Bridge too far, Sept 14). The secular character of India, as enshrined in the Constitution, promotes inclusiveness, not rejection, of religious practices. The controversial affidavit challenging the existence of Ram made a mockery of this principle by trying to become aggressively secular that is denying people the right to hold certain religious beliefs. Besides, only a portion of the Ramar Sethu may have to make way for the proposed Ram Canal, without requiring the entire structure to be demolished. The government needs to persuade the court as also the people with concrete proposals for the maintenance of marine ecology in the remaining stretch of water.

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

 Sir The United Progressive Alliance government has got itself involved in a needless controversy over the historical truth of Rams existence (Hey Ram! God save the govt, Sept 13). Expectedly, the National Democratic Alliance, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, has seized its chance. The timing could not have been better, what with the possibility of mid-term polls. It goes without saying that the UPA had adopted a foolhardy position on the issue. Thankfully, it has backtracked. Hinduism is one of the oldest religions in the world. Naturally, the beliefs and values associated with it have evolved over centuries. The Centre should be more sensitive to the feelings of Hindus and pay more attention to the possibility of seriously damaging the environment.

 Yours faithfully, 

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir Could the Archaeological Survey of India, and its political masters, give scientific evidence of the existence of all gods? If not, then the officials should have thought twice before coming up with their ingenious theory on the non-existence of Ram. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

 Sir Scientifically, the Ramar Sethu is not a man-made structure, but is composed of small, patch reefs lying in a linear pattern with reef crest, sand cays and intermittent deep channels. However, this is no excuse for the ASI to go all out against Ram. Understandably, the BJP has already started to play the communal card around this issue. But they seem to have forgotten that the Sethusamudram project had been started during the NDA regime. Why had the custodians of Hinduism remained silent at that time?

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir Need the government be reminded that religion is purely a matter of faith and above all arguments that may try to rationalize it? Instead of giving the NDA an occasion to cause trouble, the government should have found a better way to deal with the opposition to Sethusamudram. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur 

 Sir In the wake of the growing dissidence against Narendra Modi in Gujarat and internal disputes within the party, the BJP has seized upon the Ramar Sethu controversy to bolster popular support. However, it needs to remember that the religious sentiments of Hindus are not so vulnerable as to be waylaid by an ASI affidavit. Surely, a development project cannot be stalled for mythological reasons. But the government cannot go ahead with a project that is dangerous for marine life. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sayan Bhattacharya, Calcutta

 Sir It was only expected that the ignorant saffron brigade would create much fuss around the affidavit filed by the ASI, which dared to call a spade a spade. There is no doubt that Ram was the hero of an epic but there is no evidence that he ever existed or that the events described in the Ramayan actually happened. The demolition of the Ramar Sethu for creating a shipping route is essential. It would be better if the people who have inflicted enough damage on the country did not create further complications. It is shameful that the government is not taking a firm stand on this issue and is trying its best to save its skin. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta 

 Sir It is not surprising that on the eve of a prospective mid-term poll, the BJP has started playing the Hindutva card. The party has always used religion for political mobilization. The benefits of the Sethusamudram project are obvious. But if Hindu mythology can still bring the BJP votes, it would not think twice in choosing the path of unreason.

 Yours faithfully,

Rangeet Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir The controversy over the Sethusamudram project should have been a matter of scholarly debate instead of the political game it has become. C. Rajagopalachari wrote in the preface to the second edition of his retelling of the Ramayan: The Ramayana is not history or biography. It is a part of Hindu mythology one cannot understand Hindu dharma unless one knows Rama and Seeta, Bharata, Lakshmana, Ravana, Kumbhakarna and Hanuman.... The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leaders, who have fought for the Sethusamudram project, have the reputation for being not just agnostics but confirmed atheists. They should be asked to read the Ramayan first. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Kangayam R. Rangaswamy,Waunakee, USA 

 Sir Most Hindus would rather believe in the events described in the Ramayan than in the works of corrupt government historians. 

 Yours faithfully,

Anand Gupta, Harrow, UK

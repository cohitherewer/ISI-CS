The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 A MATTER OF CHOICE

 FIFTH COLUMN - SUMANTA SEN

 Newspaper reports have stated that the Forward Bloc is going to oppose the entry of big companies in the retail market for consumer goods. Even as one was going through the report, a publicity brochure of one such company arrived, announcing the opening of another retail outlet in the neighbourhood. 

 In this publicity material, the company gave the names of places where it had launched its outlets. Most of the outlets were located in the fringes of the city, dominated by the middle and the lower-middle-classes. By no means can these people be considered a part of the affluent section of society. Yet, they appear to be patronizing a trend which is supposed to symbolize the lifestyle of a chosen few. That is the argument of Left politicians, an argument which does not seem to stand up to scrutiny. The times are changing, and companies running retail business chains have taken note of the change. They appear to be a step ahead of political parties that are supposed to be close to the masses.

 This is where the problem lies. Everybody talks of the people, but very few politicians are aware of the aspirations of those they claim to represent. In this particular case, if the people turn their faces away from a newly-opened retail store, then it is the company which would have to retreat for fear of losing money. That clearly has not happened. So, are the people now to be blamed for not dancing to the tune of their saviours? 

 Perhaps aware that people are not interested in the warning against big businesses entering the retail market, it is now being alleged that the sharks will devour small traders and many petty businessmen will lose their means of livelihood. One cannot say with any measure of certainty that such a possibility does not exist. But the question is whether the threat to small traders is real. In other cities, retail outlets have also come up, but have the kirana shops closed down because of these stores? 

 Power to the people

 While buying her haldi or vegetables, the lady of the house is unlikely to severe her ties with the neighbourhood shop. But, in all probability, she will also make trips to the newly-opened retail stores to see what they have to offer. Traders seldom lose clientele because of competition. Particularly when there is no drop in the volume of money in circulation. The small-time traders know this, and they have the means of survival at their disposal. 

 The concern that is being currently expressed by the leaders of the Forward Bloc is more an academic exercise than anything else. It would have sounded genuine if they were able to force the government to control the burgeoning retail market. But that has not not come to pass thus far. 

 Spare a thought for the consumer as well. He knows that there is a department for agriculture marketing, he reads of regulated markets, but when he goes to buy onions, he has to shell out Rs 18 for one kilogram. A beginning was made with the launch of samavayikas, but nothing much has happened since then. Has Benfish been of any help to the harassed Bengali who finds most varieties of fish out of his reach? This despite the fact that Bengal continues to top fish production? The Haringhata dairy is in poor shape and efforts are being made to allow private players in this sector. Even Tantuja is dying a slow death.

 The protests against big companies entering the retail trade are unacceptable. The Forward Bloc or any other partner in the Left Front may have its own reasons for shedding tears for small traders but the consumer cannot be bothered. In fact, when spending his own money, he will be happy to be given a choice. It matters little whether the seller is a smart shop assistant or a lalaji. Just as it does not matter to the grower as to who is selling his produce.

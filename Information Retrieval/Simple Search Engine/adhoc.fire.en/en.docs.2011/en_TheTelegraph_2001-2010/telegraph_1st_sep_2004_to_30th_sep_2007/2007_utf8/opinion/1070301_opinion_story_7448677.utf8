The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Goodness of the heart

 Sir The report, So far, so Goody (Feb 27), was reassuring to read. It was very graceful of Jade Goody to travel incognito on her own to New Delhi, instead of accepting the open offer from Indian tourism office in London to visit the country at the states expense. This gesture has revealed Goody as a humble person, and one whose greed for money is not as overpowering as that of Shilpa Shetty, who made her own little pile of millions by flaunting her victimhood to the world.

 Yours faithfully,

 A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Loving care

 Sir In her article, A paper tiger (Feb 21), Shibani Chattopadhyay has sensitively analyzed the various aspects of the proposed Senior Citizens (Maintenance, Protection and Welfare) Bill, 2006. This bill, by its mere enactment, may not be as effective in bringing about social reform as has been assumed. These days, the aged parents and grandparents are most often unable to continue living with their children and grandchildren, and are expected to move into old-age homes. But Section 6(1) of the proposed bill which lays down that the central government shall establish and maintain a sufficient number of senior citizens homes at conspicuous places in the country is not going to be of much help. This might make matters worse, given the reputation of government-run homes and orphanages. It is likely that, sent to these state-run institutions, the old people will find themselves thrown from the frying pan into the fire. Only the homes managed privately or by responsible NGOs are sensitive to the needs of the old, but they are too few in number. It should be ensured that the lodging expenses of the old and infirm are borne by the younger generations. 

 In case they are deserted by their families, it is rarely possible for the old to go to court. Expensive litigations and the enormous time taken by the judiciary to settle cases leave these people with little options. It will be hard for senior citizens to afford the legal expenses in the first place, and still harder to stay alive till the court delivers the final verdict. And those who can overcome these obstacles on their own will hardly need the assistance of this bill. Hence, legal help should be provided free of cost, and fast-track courts must be set up to hear these cases within a fortnight of receiving the application.

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 Sir The parliament is trying to enact a law to protect senior citizens by ruling that their children or heirs have to take care of them in their old age. It would have been better if the government passed a law to the effect that it would pay to each senior citizen a fixed monthly stipend. It should be ensured that a bank account is opened in their names so that the amount can go there directly at the end of the month. This would bring about a social change quicker than any law ever could.

 Yours faithfully,

 Parting shot

 Sir It was interesting to read the report, Online attack on Fakes (Feb 25). The Darjeeling Tea Association, along with the Tea Board of India, seems to have finally woken up to a long-standing demand of the tea industry in Darjeeling to safeguard a product widely revered across the world. The introduction of softwares to detect fake tea such as Nepal Tea and Dooars Tea selling as Darjeeling tea in shops will prevent frauds from duping gullible foreigners and domestic tourists to Darjeeling who are invariably lured into buying tea.

 Yours faithfully,

Vijay Sarda, Darjeeling

 CLOSED DOORS

 Everyone can object to his private life being laid bare before the public. The problem, of course, has to do with the definition of private life or privacy, especially for public personalities. It may be wildly exciting to travel with a girlfriend while pretending to all the world that she is the wife. This is thrillingly private, but do the issues get a bit mixed up if the amorous traveller is a minister using the ministerial privilege of free travel for his spouse to satisfy his girlfriends wanderlust? It now seems that the Right to Information Act will not be allowed to impinge on such ambiguous territory. The Central Information Commission has stated that inquiries into the sexual life, ethnic or racial origin, political opinions, religious belief, membership of trade union, involvement in a criminal case, and physical and mental health will be considered outside the purview of the RTI Act, all of them being sensitive personal data. While a question about someones sexual life may seem prurient or vengeful, the rest of the list seems, in the Indian context, rather over-polite. The British law it is based on has a similar list, and in the present dynamics of British society, the list makes more sense than it does here. Besides, the British Data Protection Act makes exceptions. Such data can be asked for when needed in legal or medical proceedings.

 The anxiety to set up fences is not, then, limited to Indians alone. The United Kingdom has recently gone a step further. It formulated its Freedom of Information Act in 2000, but a freedom of information act (amendment) bill has been introduced in the House of Commons this year. The intention is to protect the correspondence of members of parliament from scrutiny. Even though the justification being offered is that this will cut down on trivial inquiries and so cut costs, it is more than likely, as the leader of the Liberal Democrats has said, that parliament has something to hide. Given the exposures the law has helped make false claims of taxi fare by ministers and MPs, rapes and murders by foreign diplomats in Britain, criminal records of 74 officers in the police and others in the same vein that would not be surprising. The Indian RTI Act has so far achieved some nudges in the direction of transparency of public processes. Even this might be too much. The new British bill might inspire the Indian parliament to clamp down further on the law.

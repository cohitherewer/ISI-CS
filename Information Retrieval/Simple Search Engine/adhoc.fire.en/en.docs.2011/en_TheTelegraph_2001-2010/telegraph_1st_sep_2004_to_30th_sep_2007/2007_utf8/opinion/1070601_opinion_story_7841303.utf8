 Desperate measures

 Sir The lynching of the extortionist and criminal, Pradip Mullick, by the women of Chetla on his return to his home turf after being released on bail, is a comment on the ineffectuality of the police (Ladies brigade lynches criminal, May 27). The women took law into their own hands because their complaints to the police had gone unheeded for a very long time. After Pradips death, the police have reportedly said that he used to rule over parts of Tollygunge, New Alipore and Chetla before his arrest and was trying to reclaim his former fief. This only shows that the police knew all about the activities of this notorious criminal, but had still allowed him to be released on bail after six years in prison. Wasnt it the duty of the police to keep an eye on Pradip after he was set free on bail? Given the history of police indifference, it was but natural for the people to react violently to Pradips reappearance, especially since he had picked up local women and raped one of them in the past. The locals knew that handing Pradip over to the police would serve no purpose at all and he would return to torment them again in no time. Criminals like Pradip continue to thrive because the law fails to punish them. While one should not support what the women did, it is difficult not to sympathize with their desperate action. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The Chetla lynching is a welcome development and will act as a deterrent to prospective crime lords. It is futile to sermonize on the undesirability of what the women of Chetla did to Pradip Mullick. Everyone has the right to self-defence, and when law-keepers refuse to look after the taxpayers in spite of being fed by their money, someone has to perform their duty. Even if death for a death is the roughest kind of justice possible, it is justice nonetheless. Gandhigiri cannot work with the most hardened of criminals. The women of Chetla have every right to rejoice over their deed.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

 Sir The women of an insignificant Chetla slum have empowered themselves collectively by punishing the man who had tortured them for a long time. In a country where criminal cases take years to get solved, people have to do something to ensure their own security. The women who lynched Pradip Mullick do not deserve to be punished since they were only acting in self-defence. They should, in fact, be felicitated for doing the polices job for them. However, the show of combined strength by the women reveals the men of the locality in a poor light. They should now try to help the police to nab the three accomplices of Pradip who had managed to escape. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir It is unclear how the people who had silently endured the violent ways of Pradip Mullick for years could suddenly muster the courage to lynch him. However, one fact remains the police had dozed through Pradips reign of terror and they remained that way when he was lynched.

 Yours faithfully,

Manoj Kumar Sinha, Barasat

 Denied in death

 Sir The incident that took place at the Malda district hospital is a pointer to the unfortunate erosion of human values today (Last rites without body after morgue demands bribe, May 27). The employees of the morgue in the district hospital of Malda were so avaricious that they refused to release the body of Mani Maddi when her teenaged sons failed to pay the sum demanded as bribe. Bablu and Gopal Tudu had no option but to perform the last rites without their mothers body. The state healthcare system has proved itself a failure not only in providing the minimum service to the poor but even in ensuring respect to the dead. The assurance offered by the districts chief medical officer of health, that an enquiry will be conducted into the affair, is a vague consolation. Instead of making insubstantial promises, he should sack the employees rightaway. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jayantabishnu Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir The heartrending report on the disgraceful behaviour of the morgue hands at the Malda district hospital reminds one of Saratchandra Chattopadhyays short story, Abhagir Swarga. As in the story, so in real life, the poor are denied dignity even in death. How could the morgue employees demand bribe from two boys who had just lost their mother? However, their conduct is not surprising since employees of district hospitals have made it a habit to have their palms greased before performing even the smallest duty. It is appalling that the practice has been allowed to flourish unchecked for all these years.

 Yours faithfully,

G.C. Biswas, Barasat

 Sir Cases of bribery which actually affect the common man usually go unregarded by the media since they do not involve the rich and the famous. The Telegraph should be congratulated for highlighting one such case. Perhaps it is because of this news report that the superintendent of the Malda district hospital has hastened to undo the damage (Promise to hand over body, May 29).

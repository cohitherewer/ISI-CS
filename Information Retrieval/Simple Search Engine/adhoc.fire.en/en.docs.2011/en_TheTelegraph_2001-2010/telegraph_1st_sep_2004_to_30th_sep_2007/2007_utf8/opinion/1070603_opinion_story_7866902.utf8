 Trite family sagas

 Sir M.R. Venkateshs The family and other animals (May 31) was interesting, but had hardly any new insights. Rivalries, as within the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, are not new in Indian politics. DMK members who had the clout to challenge the supremacy of M. Karunanidhi and his sons had met with Dayanidhi Marans fate earlier as well. The DMK is one of many Indian parties reduced to a one-person affair. It is one frightful instance of the extent to which Indias democratic polity has been compromised.

 Yours faithfully,

 Old bottle, and wine

 Sir The prime minister has rightly requested chief ministers to control power transmission and power theft, and to better manage the distribution of losses (Pledge to plug power theft, May 29). However, since power theft occurs with the connivance of officials, it will not be easy to determine the exact volume of such loss in each state. Thus, transmission and distribution losses has become an euphemism for power theft. Besides, none but the honest pay their bills regularly. 

 The Centre should, therefore, look for alternatives to electricity, such as solar energy, ideal for domestic and some industrial consumption. Loans may be offered at low rates for solar energy equipment, and all new buildings, especially residential ones, should be made to use them. The resultant electricity surplus could be used for industrial purposes. This would help the state electricity boards to cut their losses too.

 Sir Manmohan Singhs appeal to chief ministers with regard to the problems of the power sector refers to the same four essential themes: high volume of losses, the need to accelerate capacity-addition, conservation of energy and rural electrification. Each of these themes has been talked about for long and several prescriptions have been offered for each. But the lack of political will has prevented India from taking action. 

 Losses in transmission and distribution, mainly through theft, are significant restraints on the addition of power-generating capacity. The hardest hit is the distribution sector, which witnesses most of the theft. However, these losses occur with the knowledge of the political establishment. The prime minister should, therefore, have prescribed discipline and efficiency among power-sector employees. The government also needs to extend the reach of the law with regard to corrupt officials. Besides, since government-owned electricity companies have persisted with their old infrastructure in the name of reforms, perhaps the time has come to privatize as many of them as possible.

 Sir Manmohan Singhs sermon to chief ministers is another instance of political rhetoric. The power sector has never achieved its targets and it has consistently made losses. This has now resulted in a very serious power deficit throughout the country. Indians are always assured that the shortage is minimal and will be overcome within a few years. But, it seems that Singh needs to personally review the sector every month and pull up errant states. He may also have to look into projects and the transmission and distribution networks. Since this is a tall order for a busy prime minister, the power crisis in India is not likely to be over in a hurry. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Letters to Editor

 Hold your tongue

 Sir Rahul Gandhi, a member of parliament from Amethi, obviously has no understanding of the political drama being played out by various political parties in Uttar Pradesh (Future fine, past tense, April 16). The scion of the Nehru-Gandhi family created an unwanted diplomatic row by claiming that his family was instrumental in the division of Pakistan, which led to the birth of Bangladesh in 1971. The remark is being perceived by Pakistans foreign office as an interference in the internal matters of the country. If trouble erupts in Baluchistan, Karachi or elsewhere in Pakistan in the future, India is likely to be blamed more vociferously for it. Sonia Gandhi must realize that Rahul Gandhi needs more grooming before he takes on the party leadership.

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Sir Speeches made by Rahul Gandhi while campaigning in Ut- tar Pradesh have been controversial as well as contradictory. He is trying to attract votes by riding high on the achievements of his family. It is known to all that India strongly supported Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the Mukti Bahini in the creation of Bangladesh, but the intention was not to destabilize Pakistan. Such an irresponsible remark from the top Congress leadership might derail the newly-initiated peace process with Pakistan. Moreover, his argument is likely to be contested by both the opposition and his own party. Instead of slo- ganeering, he should concentrate more on finding ways to strengthen the position of his party in UP. After all, the fate of his party is likely to be determined by its promises of progress and prosperity, and not by its past records. 

 Yours faithfully,

B. Srinivasan, Pune

 Sir In his youthful exuberance, Rahul Gandhi admitted in public that his grandmother, Indira Gandhi, divided Pakistan. Sending troops to liberate East Pakistan cannot be interpreted in any way but as Indias attempt at political interference. It goes without saying that this single act further embittered Indias relations with its neighbour. Things could get worse if Rahul Gandhi is not advised to restrain himself. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The editorial, Missing link (April 17), has exposed the clever strategy behind the puerile observations of Rahul Gandhi. He is no more than a novice in politics. His only qualification seems to be his lineage. While mentioning the demolition of the Babri Masjid to garner Muslim votes, he should have known that the community is unlikely to forget the exploits of Sanjay Gandhi, namely, his forcible family planning measures. Rahul Gandhis claim that the Bangladesh war was fought with the object of bifurcating Pakistan brings little satisfaction to Hindus. The birth of Bangladesh did nothing to improve relations between Bengalis on either side of the divide. Perhaps he should have been more aware of his familys responsibility in the Kashmir imbroglio. The Nehru-Gandhis failed to arrest the migration of Hindus from Kashmir. If Rahul Gandhi thinks he can appease voters by recalling the past alone, he is being nave. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Rahul Gandhis contro- versial remark is a clever tactic to counter-balance an earlier statement. If his remark on the Babri Masjid demolition was aimed at the Muslim vote-bank, his remark on Bangladesh is aimed to reach out to the Hindu electorate. Pakistan-bashing, he presumes, is good anytime. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir A hostile neighbour is considerably weakened if its territory is divided. The division of Pakis- tan was to Indias national interests. Keeping this in mind, Rahul Gandhi is right in claiming credit for his family for defeating Pakistan in the 1971 war. The Bharatiya Janata Party is not willing to look at its own follies while criticizing Rahul Gandhi. It is difficult to forget how, after the parliament attack in 2001, the ruling BJP deployed the Indian army on the borders in full might and made it wait for a whole year in anticipation of a war with Pakistan. Operation Parakram, as it was called, considerably drained the exchequer without any tangi- ble gain. Jingoism is not a characteristic of the Nehru-Gandhis alone. 

 Yours faithfully,

Lingayath Krishna Rajesh, Chennai

 Sir The recent comment made by Rahul Gandhi on his familys role in the creation of Bangladesh is not only an insult to the sacrifice made by the Bangladeshi revolutionaries but also an attempt to undermine the role of the Indian defence forces in the Bangladesh war. If his statement is correct, Rahul Gandhi should also admit his familys responsibility for Partition. The family can also be directly blamed for the Sino-Indian conflict of the Sixties, the Bofors scam, and much of the malaise India has faced in the first fifty years since Independence. As an economist, Manmohan Singh knows all too well that his governments half-hearted economic reforms and reservation policy will not bring votes to the Congress. Which is why he is endorsing Rahul Gandhi. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

 Sir The Indian armys intervention cannot overshadow the role of the Mukti Bahini. By overlooking this historical truth, Rahul Gandhi has only exposed his ignorance. 

 Yours faithfully,

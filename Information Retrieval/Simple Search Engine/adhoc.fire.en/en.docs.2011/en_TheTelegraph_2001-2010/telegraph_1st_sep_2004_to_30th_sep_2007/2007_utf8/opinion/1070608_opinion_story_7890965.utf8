The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 LOST ACROSS CULTURES 

 GOODBYE CALCUTTA By Keron Bhattacharya, Jay, Rs 295

 The idea was quite good really. With a deceptively grammatical little prelude, about the beginning not being at the beginning but somewhere in the middle, Keron Bhattacharya starts off with an explosion in Calcutta being reported in London in 1986. Joya Banerji, once the Indian Olympics athlete Joya Thadani and now the star correspondent of Londons Daily News, is asked by her boss to fly to her home city to investigate. She refuses, not only because she is overworked, but also because she has promised someone she will never set foot in the city again. 

 The reader is then plunged into Joyas past. It is a determinedly cross-cultural novel. At least seven couples most of the characters, that is are married to women from overseas and are all equally unhappy in unequal ways. Joyas past returns the reader first to Calcutta, 1969, then to London, 1971, to Bombay, 1977, then back to London through the seasons, July 1986, autumn, 1986 and February, 1987. This is a comfortably baggy time-span, including Naxalites and anti-multinational terrorists, Nehru and Mujibur Rahman, the Mexico Olympics and a Bhopal-style explosion. 

 It could have been breathless the idea was really not bad at all but Bhattacharya does mess it up rather. And he does so on several levels. One of the pleasures expected of a novel in English, since fiction is for pleasure after all, is that the English will be readable, or at least correct. Maybe the errors are supposed to be the fault of a careless copy-editor as, for example, when a husbands face left no illusion to his wife that he would not be readily succumbed to any rash suggestions. Again, the copy-editor should have known, even if the author did not, that there is nothing called a jostic, and cast is not the same thing as caste. There is no need to go on. 

 There is a very impressive list of characters in the beginning the real beginning, not the middle-beginning. But Bhattacharyas third-person omniscient narration constantly loses its way in the characters minds. All his women wander, and all his men either tyrannize or mewl. And the Sixties generation of men are all corporate types educated in England in the same year when they all lived in digs at Belsize Park. The handsome anti-hero lover-villain, Vishy, is pure cardboard. And Subho, Joyas ex-husband and the cause of her tragic separation from her son, has two facets: lover of mother-in-law and torturer of wife. These facets forget to meet. But sometimes the business-journalist and management-consultant facets of Bhattacharya get the better of his aspiring-novelist facet: he analyses insider trading with rather more acuity than he does his characters.

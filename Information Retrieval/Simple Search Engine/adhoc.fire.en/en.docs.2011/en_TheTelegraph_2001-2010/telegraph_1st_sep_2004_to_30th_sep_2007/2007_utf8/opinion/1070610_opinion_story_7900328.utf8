The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 Pranab Mukherjee, one hears, has missed the presidential bus. Sonia Gandhi recently summoned the Union minister to let him know that he cannot be spared for the presidency, considering his importance to the government. Instead, she asked him to reason with the stubborn leftists to get them to support a Congress candidate for the post. Party insiders, however, have given a different spin to the tale. Madam, it seems, does not trust Mukherjee entirely. She hasnt forgotten how he had once fallen out with her husband, and Pranabdas proximity to PV Narasimha Rao. Other Congressmen feel that Mukherjee is too much his own man to don the role of a rubber stamp president. Mukherjee is not returning empty-handed from the show. Someone gifted the number 2 man in the party a book BK Nehrus Nice Guys Finish Second. Surely, that is one title Mukherjee will hold close to his heart. 

 The presidential elections have not only set the political kettle on the boil in India, it has also created a stir in far-off lands. When the leader of the opposition, LK Advani, called upon the visiting Brazilian president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the prez surprised him by his interest in the presidential race. For instance, Lula wanted to know how the presidential polls are conducted in India and what were the prospects of the incumbent, APJ Abdul Kalam, getting a second term in office. Lula even appeared to be aware of the backroom deliberations. After his encounter with Lula, Advani was left wondering if Indian politicians knew half as much about the political scene in Brazil. Now isnt this a perfect case for a few more bilateral visits by Mr Advani? 

 The BJP may have lost UP but the party gen-sec, Arun Jaitley, has not lost his sense of humour. When it came to Jaitleys attention that Congressmen had not stopped showering praise on Rahul Gandhi despite the partys miserable poll performance, the irrepressible Jaitley quipped that for the Congresswallahs, UP is a case where nothing succeeded like failure. Jaitley also reserved some of his witty barbs for his party colleagues. A week after taking charge, Jaitley was heard comparing the bhaiyas in UP with those in Bihar. Apparently, UPs bhaiyas, in Jaitleys opinion, were hamhanded and far less professional than their Bihari counterparts because they insisted on meeting him at home rather than at his office on Ashoka Road!

 It is time for the rains down south and it looks like it will be a stormy season for Dayanidhi Maran. The DMK supremo, M Karunanidhi, is furious with him and has reportedly turned down all offers to patch up with his grand nephew. Karunanidhi decided against attending the valaikappu ceremony of his pregnant sister and even pulled up MK Stalins daughter for attending the ceremony. Meanwhile, A Raja, who has succeeded Maran to the post, has been busy digging up old files that were cleared by his predecessor. 

 Apparently, the chief minister has declared that Maran must tender an unconditional apology to his son, MK Azhagiri, whom the Maran-family owned Sun TV held responsible for triggering the violence and the deaths after the Dinakaran survey. Perhaps, Maran would be better off issuing the apology. That would not only bring back peace in the clan but also help the former Union minister recover the political ground that he has lost in recent times.

 One more name has been added to the list of Indias burgeoning population of the homeless. Former UP CM, ND Tiwari, one learns, has been left without a home, and is now living in a guest house in Dehradun. Tiwari is entitled to guest accommodation in UP Bhawan in the capital but he is unwilling to trade places. This is because he has his eyes set firmly on a Raj Bhavan address. Unfortunately, the Congress president turned a deaf ear to his pleas for governorship, forcing poor Tiwari to lobby for a stint at the Rashtrapati Bhawan. But here, too, he was rebuffed. With the chips firmly down, Tiwari followers are now praying that he does not lose his guest accommodation at least.

 Rajiv Pratap Rudi, who was the saffron in charge of the polls in Goa, could not deliver and the BJP lost the turf. Now, Rudi has been busy meddling in Rajasthan, pitching for Jaswant Singh as the CM. Senior leaders are worried that with Rudi around, Rajasthan, too, would go Goas way. Is Rajnath Singh listening?

 Which is the surest way to Madams heart? Ask PV Bhide. He would know. Bhide, who beat all competition to become the revenue secretary, had one advantage over his rivals his French-knowing sister-in-law. Bhides wife, Sheila, an additional secretary in the external affairs ministry, has a sister who teaches French at Jawaharlal Nehru University.

 According to the grapevine, the Congress president holds JNU teachers in great esteem. And if they happen to be fluent in either French or Italian, chances are that Madam could even strike up a friendship with them.

 Those who have been despairing because of their failure to get access to the lady at 10 Janpath need not lose heart. Bhides success story carries an important lesson for them. Instead of sitting and sulking, they should spend their time taking lessons in French and Italian. A teaching job at JNU could also brighten their prospects of meeting the Congress president.

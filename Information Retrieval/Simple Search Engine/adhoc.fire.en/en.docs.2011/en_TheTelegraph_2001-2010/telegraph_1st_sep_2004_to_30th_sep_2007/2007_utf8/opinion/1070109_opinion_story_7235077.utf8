 TERROR TACTICS

 There is something rotten in the state of West Bengal. Nothing else can explain why the state so completely and so devastatingly abdicated its responsibility in Nandigram. The absence of the police on Sunday is only a part, although a very important part, of the story. But even earlier, the police had failed to stop the violence that had occurred on Wednesday and on Thursday. Either the police had no intelligence that villagers and Maoists had armed themselves or they did not act on the intelligence. Subsequently, when activists of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) began to build camps in the neighbourhood, the administration stood by and watched, as if innocent that the camps were a pretext to an armed confrontation. When that confrontation came on Sunday morning, the police had conveniently disappeared. There can be no excuse for this failure on the part of the law and order machinery to perform its basic duty. One of the principal reasons for the existence of the state is the preservation of law and order. The state of West Bengal has failed to deliver in this sphere. It has allowed activists of various political parties to disrupt the peace of an area. The fact that CPI(M) activists were heavily implicated in Sundays violence would suggest that the state had connived with the ruling party.

 The activists of the CPI(M) were given the license to use violence by irresponsible statements made by senior leaders like Mr Benoy Konar who seem to believe that politics in a democracy can be conducted on the basis of Hammurabis code of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. The CPI(M) allowed its cadre to retaliate against the partys rivals in Nandigram. It thus reduced the entire issue of industrialization of West Bengal into a petty turf battle. By escalating the level of violence and by totally disregarding law and order, the CPI(M) has seriously damaged the image of West Bengal. The incident in Nandigram has conveyed to all investors that the muscle power of the CPI(M) cadre is still an integral part of West Bengals political reality, and that power can be unleashed whenever it suits the partys interests. The idea that West Bengal is a safe and peaceful haven for investment is turning out to be a chimera. The project to industrialize West Bengal is too vital to be left to the cadre of the CPI(M) and its belief in the politics of terror.

 CASTE FIRES

 The greedy lay traps that threaten to snare them in the end. Politicians, greedy for votes and for victory, single-mindedly cultivate forms of division slotting this caste into that reserved category, giving its rival another quota with greater benefits, throwing down one and pulling up another. They play this game tirelessly, till they themselves and the caste-groups they are playing with are all in a complete whirl with benefits given and promises broken, rivalries sharpened and betrayals exposed. If politics in northern and western India had not been dominated by this game, there need not have been 14 dead in Dausa in Rajasthan. The scale of the Gujjar protest against the Vasundhara Raje governments broken promise of granting them scheduled tribe status was so completely unforeseen that politicians and the administration were both left fumbling. Policemen, predictably, reacted in sheer panic, and actually managed to kill three of their own in the melee. Hundreds of people had begun to gather at a single point since early morning. Apparently, no one knew what was about to happen. In Rajasthan, the peoples pulse has obviously slipped the grip of the Bharatiya Janata Party governments finger. 

 But the confusion and violence of the Dausa episode represent also, in a different way, the indiscipline and opportunism that rule the heart of the reservations policy. Politicians have uncorked the dangerous genie of caste benefits with no reference to constitutional safeguards. Now who is going to address the Gujjars demand? Considered STs in Jammu and Kashmir and in Himachal Pradesh, where they are chiefly grazers, the Gujjars are in the other backward classes category elsewhere, including in Rajasthan, where they are cultivators. But the BJP gave the Jats OBC status when the Congress hesitated and so lost their vote, and the Jats have dominated the OBC scene in Rajasthan since then. And the ST scene there is dominated by the ancient Meenas, who are fiercely possessive of their tribal status and now quite well-established in the police service, for example. The Gujjars, who consider themselves quite a prize in the backwardness competition, are not willing to wait any longer for a promise made in 2003. Any change in status has to be made from Delhi with the states input. That is, both the Congress and the BJP, their fingers still burning, must address the Gujjars demand together. That would be instructive.
